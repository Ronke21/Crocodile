==Early life and education==
Zwick was born on October 8, 1952, into a Jewish family in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Ruth Ellen (&quot;née&quot; Reich) and Allen Zwick. He attended New Trier High School, received a B.A. at Harvard in 1974, and attended the AFI Conservatory, graduating with a Master of Fine Arts degree in 1975.

Despite sharing a surname and profession, Edward is unrelated to fellow director Joel Zwick. He has been married to actress Liberty Godshall since 1982, and they have two grown children.

==Career==
His films include &quot;Glory&quot; (1989), &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; (1994), &quot;The Siege&quot; (1998), &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; (2003), &quot;Blood Diamond&quot; (2006), and &quot;Defiance&quot; (2008). Along with Marshall Herskovitz, Zwick runs a film production company called The Bedford Falls Company (inspired by the name of the town featured in Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;). This company has produced such films as &quot;Traffic&quot; and &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; and the TV shows &quot;thirtysomething&quot;, &quot;Relativity&quot;, &quot;Once and Again&quot;, and &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;.

Zwick&#x27;s body of work has earned numerous accolades, including an Academy Award and BAFTA Award for Best Picture as a producer, and Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Writing in a Limited Series, and Outstanding Dramatic Special.

<text>F.E.A.R. First Encounter Assault Recon is a 2005 first-person shooter psychological horror video game for Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. Developed by Monolith Productions and published by Vivendi Universal Games, the Windows version was released worldwide in October 2005. The Xbox and PlayStation versions were ported by Day 1 Studios and released in October 2006 and April 2007, respectively. Two standalone expansion packs were released for the Windows and Xbox 360 versions of the game, both developed by TimeGate Studios; &quot;F.E.A.R. Extraction Point&quot; (2006) and &quot;F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate&quot; (2007). Released on Windows in March 2007, &quot;F.E.A.R. Gold Edition&quot; includes all the content from the &quot;Director&#x27;s Edition&quot; plus &quot;Extraction Point&quot;, while &quot;F.E.A.R. Platinum Collection&quot;, released for Windows in November 2007, includes the &quot;Director&#x27;s Edition&quot;, &quot;Extraction Point&quot;, and &quot;Perseus Mandate&quot;. Neither expansion is now considered canon, as the Monolith-developed &quot;F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin&quot; ignores the events of both.

The game&#x27;s story revolves around the fictional F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) unit, an elite group in the United States Army tasked with investigating supernatural phenomena. When a mysterious paramilitary force infiltrates a multi-billion dollar aerospace compound, taking hostages but issuing no demands, the government responds by sending in a Special Forces team only to have them obliterated. Live footage of the massacre shows an inexplicable wave of destruction tearing the soldiers apart. With no other recourse, the elite F.E.A.R. team is assembled to deal with the extraordinary circumstances. They are given one simple mission: evaluate the threat and eliminate the intruders at any cost. The player takes on the role of the unit&#x27;s newest recruit, Point Man, a man with a dark past and extremely short reaction time, leading the character through countless firefights and witnessing paranormal manifestations conjured up by a mysterious little girl dressed in red.

Although the atmosphere of the game was heavily influenced by Japanese horror, Monolith&#x27;s primary goal with &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; was to make the player feel like the hero of an action film. To this end, they combined a slow-motion technique called &quot;reflex time&quot;, a semi-destructible environment, and a highly detailed particle system in an attempt to create as immersive an environment as possible. Another vital element in this is the game&#x27;s AI, with Monolith employing a never-before-used technique to give hostile NPCs an unusually broad range of actions in response to what the player is doing. This results in NPCs who can also work as a team, such as performing flanking maneuvers, laying down suppressive fire, and attempting to retreat when under heavy fire.

Upon its initial Windows release, &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; was very well received, with the AI garnering especial praise. Critics also lauded the graphics, atmosphere, sound design, music, and combat mechanics. Common points of criticism were a lack of enemy variety, a weak plot, and repetitive level design. The Xbox 360 version was also well received, but the PlayStation 3 version met with mixed reviews, with many critics unimpressed with the port&#x27;s technical issues and graphical inferiority. It was a commercial success, selling over three million units worldwide across all three systems.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; is a first-person shooter in which the player&#x27;s arsenal includes handguns (which the player can dual wield), an assault rifle, submachine gun, shotgun, sniper rifle, nail gun, repeating cannon, rocket launcher, and particle beam. Each weapon differs in terms of accuracy, range, rate of fire, damage, and weight. The latter characteristic is important, as the more powerful weapons (rocket launcher, cannon, and particle beam) tend to be more cumbersome and slow the player&#x27;s movement and reaction speed. Only three different firearms can be carried at any one time. The player also has access to three different types of explosive - frag grenades, proximity grenades, and remote bombs. The player can carry five of each type and can carry all three at once (allowing for up to 15 explosives), but only one type may be equipped at any one time. Additionally, when using the remote bombs, the player must holster their weapon.

Compared to other shooters where melee combat is often a last resort, &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot;″s melee system is a viable combat alternative. The butts of all firearms can be used in close combat; lighter weapons, although less powerful, allow the player to move around more quickly and increase the chances of a successful melee attack. Movement speed is maximized if a player holsters their weapon, which allows them to engage in hand-to-hand combat. As well as the basic melee attack, players can also perform a jumping kick and a sliding tackle, both of which, if landed correctly, instantly kill regular enemies.
A prominent gameplay element in &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; is &quot;reflex time&quot;; an ability which slows down the game world while still allowing the player to aim and react at normal speeds. This effect is used to simulate the player character&#x27;s superhuman reflexes, and is represented by stylized visual effects, such as bullets in flight that cause air distortion or interact with the game&#x27;s particle system. The duration which reflex time lasts is limited, determined by a meter which slowly fills up automatically when the ability is not being used. The player can permanently increase the size of the reflex meter by picking up reflex boosters. Other pickups available during the game include medkits (of which the player can store ten), protective armor (reduces the amount of damage the player takes during combat), and health boosters (permanently increase the player&#x27;s health meter).

Reflex time is an important element of the game&#x27;s combat mechanics insofar as &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot;″s artificial intelligence allows hostile NPCs an unusually large range of action; enemies can duck to travel under crawlspaces, jump through windows, vault over railings, climb ladders, and push over large objects to create cover, all in reaction to what the player is doing at any given moment. Various opponents may also act as a team, taking back routes to flank the player, using suppressive fire, taking cover and often falling back if under fire, alerting one another as to the player&#x27;s location, and giving one another orders (which may, or may not, be followed).

=== Multiplayer ===
The game&#x27;s multiplayer can support up to 16 players, and initially featured deathmatch, team deathmatch, elimination, team elimination, and capture the flag. &quot;Control&quot; and &quot;Conquer All&quot; games were added later as free downloadable content. Also added at a later date were game types specifically designed to allow players to use reflex time; SlowMo deathmatch, team SlowMo deathmatch, and SlowMo capture the flag. These game types feature a reflex time power-up, which only one player can carry at a time, and when it is fully charged (it charges when it is being carried) that player can activate it and give themselves (and the rest of their team, if applicable) a considerable speed advantage over opposing players. However, whoever is carrying the power-up will have a bluish glow and will be permanently visible on all players&#x27; mini-maps. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game feature the same modes as the PC version (with both &quot;Control&quot; and &quot;Conquer All&quot; added after release). Multiple new maps were made available for the Xbox 360 version throughout 2007, with the release of three major map packs; Nightmare, Synchronicity, and Bonus.

In August 2006, &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot;″s multiplayer component was re-released on PC as a free download under the name &quot;F.E.A.R. Combat&quot;. Incorporating the latest multiplayer patches, all ten gameplay modes, and all nineteen maps, &quot;F.E.A.R. Combat&quot; was compatible with the original PC retail edition&#x27;s multiplayer, meaning those with only the download could play with those who own the full game.

==Plot==
In 2002, the elite United States Army unit F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) was founded to &quot;combat paranormal threats to national security&quot;. The game is set in 2025 in the fictional city of Fairport and begins as the unit is joined by a newly assigned Sergeant (referred to only as Point Man). At a facility owned by Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC), a psychic operative named Paxton Fettel has gone rogue. Officially an aerospace manufacturer and medical research company, in reality, ATC are a hugely powerful private military company dabbling in cryogenics, nuclear technology, cloning, and telepathy. They were attempting to develop a unit of telepathically controlled clone soldiers (known as Replicas), and Fettel was their commander. However, he has now used the Replicas to seize control of the facility. The mission of the three-person F.E.A.R. team (Point Man, 1LT. Spencer Jankowski, and CTO Jin Sun-Kwon) is to eliminate Fettel, which will automatically shut down the Replicas.

As soon as the mission begins, Point Man starts to have powerful hallucinations – Fettel asking him &quot;what&#x27;s the first thing you remember?&quot;; a woman screaming, &quot;where are you taking him?&quot;; a man telling him, &quot;you will be a god among men&quot;; a baby crying; and, most frequently, a young girl in a red dress. In one particular hallucination, he sees Fettel interrogating a worker, demanding to know where &quot;Alma&quot; is. Shortly thereafter, Point Man finds the mutilated worker, who manages to say, &quot;Alma. If Fettel finds her...Origin&quot; before he dies. Despite Jankowski disappearing, F.E.A.R. is deployed to ATC headquarters, where a Delta Force recon team has dropped out of contact.

Point Man learns that Fettel&#x27;s brain waves during his revolt were identical to those during the &quot;first synchronicity event&quot;, which happened when he was ten and resulted in the termination of &quot;Project Origin&quot;. This time, however, Fettel is infinitely more dangerous. Meanwhile, Point Man finds that the Delta recon team have been massacred. He then encounters an ATC survivor, Aldus Bishop, who tells F.E.A.R. that the Replicas were looking for Harlan Wade, a senior ATC researcher. A Delta Force team led by Sgt. Douglas Holiday is sent in to extract Bishop. They get him to a helicopter, but as he is boarding, he is shot by ATC security. Point Man subsequently learns that Fettel was the &quot;second prototype&quot; resulting from Project Origin. Shortly thereafter, Fettel tells Point Man &quot;a war is coming. I&#x27;ve seen it in my dreams. Fires sweeping over the earth. Bodies in the streets. Cities turned to dust. Retaliation.&quot;

Point Man subsequently learns that the prototypes were created from the genetic code of a female psychic named Alma, who gave physical birth to both prototypes from within an induced coma. He also learns about the &quot;synchronicity event&quot; – despite being in a coma, Alma formed a telepathic link with Fettel, and began influencing his actions, leading to several deaths. In the Origin facility, Point Man discovers that Alma was only eight when she was brought into Origin, 15 when the first prototype was born, and she is the girl in the red dress. He also learns that Wade is planning on freeing Alma from stasis in the Origin facility, even though she officially died in 2005. After her death, the facility was sealed until 2025, when it was reopened (over Wade&#x27;s objections) with an eye to possibly restarting the project. Moments later, Fettel experienced the second synchronicity event. Point Man then has an hallucination in which Fettel tells him that they are brothers, both born of Alma – Point Man is the first prototype. Finding Fettel, he shoots him in the head, rendering the Replicas dormant. He then witnesses Wade, who is revealed to be Alma&#x27;s father, releasing her from stasis. She immediately kills him, and Point Man heads to the facility&#x27;s nuclear reactor core, overloading it.

As the facility explodes, Point Man escapes and is picked up by a Delta Force helicopter, on board of which are Holiday and Jin. As it flies over the mushroom cloud, the helicopter loses power, and Alma pulls herself up into the cabin. The game then cuts to black. After the credits, we hear a phone call between an unnamed senator and Genevieve Aristide, president of ATC. She assures him that Project Origin is secure and Fettel has been neutralised. As he complains about how indiscreet the cleanup has been, she points out, &quot;there is some good news, however. The first prototype was a complete success.&quot;

==Development==
===Conception===
Although it was known from late 2003 that Monolith Productions was working with Vivendi on a new title, nothing was officially revealed until May 2004, when a single screenshot from the new game was published in Vivendi&#x27;s weekly newsletter. Written above the picture was, &quot;They say bullets taste like chicken,&quot; and written below was, &quot;Hope you&#x27;re hungry.&quot; Vivendi promised that more would be revealed in a few days, at the upcoming E3. &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; was formally announced at E3, with the reveal of the game&#x27;s title, a trailer, a brief plot outline, the genre (first-person shooter), the platform (PC), the release date (fourth quarter of 2005), and the probable rating (M). The following day, a non-playable demo was made available to journalists.

Development had begun with the game tentatively titled &quot;Signal&quot;. Writer, director, and lead designer Craig Hubbard stated that the game &quot;evolved out of a concept we started developing right after &quot;&quot;&quot;. Kevin Stephens, Monolith&#x27;s director of technology and one of the game&#x27;s lead programmers, later elaborated that the concept was to make the player feel like the hero of an action film. It was this ambition which led to the development of reflex time; Hubbard said he wanted &quot;to make combat as intense as the tea house shootout at the beginning of John Woo&#x27;s &quot;Hard Boiled&quot;&quot;, and defeating &quot;enemies with style&quot; was crucial to this. In a 2008 interview with &quot;IGN&quot; promoting &quot;F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin&quot;, he explained,

Another key influence was the Wachowskis&#x27; &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999). In particular, the lobby scene was the team&#x27;s initial point of reference for how the game&#x27;s combat should look and feel. With these influences in mind, and wanting to create as immersive an experience as possible, reflex time came to play a key role in the game&#x27;s combat mechanics.

To further the sense of immersion, Monolith also employed stylistic elements such as a silent, nameless protagonist with an unknown background, and allowing the player to see the protagonist&#x27;s body when looking down or sideways. Hubbard states, &quot;it was a conscious decision not to give the player an identity. We wanted players to be able to &quot;become&quot; the protagonist without any reminders that they&#x27;re supposed to be someone else.&quot;

===Atmosphere===
As well as its core first-person shooter gameplay, &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; is also a psychological horror, and was specifically influenced by Japanese horror, with Stephens citing films such as Hideo Nakata&#x27;s &quot;Ringu&quot; (1998), the Pang brothers&#x27; &quot;The Eye&quot; (2002), Takashi Shimizu&#x27;s &quot;Ju-On: The Grudge&quot; (2002), and Nakata&#x27;s &quot;Dark Water&quot; (2002). Hubbard also cites &quot;Ringu&quot; and &quot;The Eye&quot; as well as Katsuhiro Otomo&#x27;s &quot;Akira&quot; (1988), Kim Tae-yong and Min Kyu-dong&#x27;s &quot;Memento Mori&quot; (1999), Kiyoshi Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Kairo&quot; (2001), and Koji Suzuki&#x27;s 1991 novel &quot;Ringu&quot; (on which Nakata&#x27;s film was based).

Hubbard has said that his goal with &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot;″s horror elements was to achieve &quot;a subtle and cerebral type of dread, emphasising suspense and the shadows.&quot; Believing that a scare &quot;always works best when you&#x27;re not expecting it&quot;, Monolith attempted to keep the &quot;psychology of the encounter&quot; in the player&#x27;s mind at all times, in order to &quot;get under [the player&#x27;s] skin&quot;. Thus, they shunned the &quot;in your face &#x27;monsters jumping out of closets&#x27; approach&quot;. Lead level designer John Mulkey states that &quot;creating expectation and then messing with that expectation is extremely important&quot;. Similarly, Hubbard explains that &quot;horror is extremely fragile [...] you can kill it by spelling things out too clearly and you can undermine it with too much ambiguity&quot;. With this in mind, he attempted to strike a balance with the narrative elements of &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot;, giving players &quot;enough clues so that [they] can form [their] own theories about what&#x27;s going on, but ideally [they will] be left with some uncertainty&quot;. Speaking to &quot;Rock Paper Shotgun&quot; in 2013, he reiterated this point; &quot;you want to see something just enough that you can evoke it in your mind and kind of picture it a little bit, but not enough that you can really understand it.&quot;
The main source of the game&#x27;s horror is Alma Wade. In terms of influences, she is often assumed to have been inspired by Samara from &quot;The Ring&quot; (the American remake of &quot;Ringu&quot;). Hubbard, however, explains that Alma &quot;was born out of a tradition of eerie, faceless female ghosts&quot; and not &quot;as an answer to any specific movie character&quot;. Although he does acknowledge that Alma &quot;bears some visual resemblance to the ghosts in &quot;Dark Water&quot; or &quot;Séance&quot;&quot;, he points out that &quot;creepy little girls have been freaking [him] out since &quot;The Shining&quot;&quot;. Alma was named after Alma Mobley from Peter Straub&#x27;s novel &quot;Ghost Story&quot; (1979).

In relation to the game&#x27;s villain, Paxton Fettel, producer Craig Hewitt has explained that initially there were two villains, but they were ultimately merged. Originally, Fettel was a supporting villain, with the game&#x27;s main antagonist (aside from Alma) being Conrad Krige. Krige&#x27;s name was a tribute to actress Alice Krige, who had portrayed Alma Mobley in John Irvin&#x27;s 1981 adaptation of Straub&#x27;s novel. Initially, Fettel, Point Man, and Krige were all prototypes, with Point Man and Fettel considered failures. Krige, a perfect soldier, would use Fettel as his interrogator, with Fettel able to consume a person&#x27;s flesh to learn the truth about any given subject. Hubbard explains that &quot;we ended up consolidating [Fettel and Krige] just because there wasn&#x27;t enough storytelling real estate.&quot;

===Engine===

&quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; was the first game developed using the &quot;Jupiter EX&quot; iteration of LithTech, Monolith&#x27;s own game engine. Driven by a DirectX 9 renderer, &quot;Jupiter EX&quot; has major advancements over its direct precursor, &quot;Jupiter&quot;, and features both Havok physics and the Havok &quot;Vehicle Kit&quot;, which adds support for common vehicle behavior (a feature which goes unused in &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot;, as no vehicles appear outside of scripted sequences). Originally, the game opened in the middle of a car chase, which the team had spent two months working on. However, they couldn&#x27;t get it to work the way they wanted and so they ultimately decided to drop it altogether.

Graphically, &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; uses normal mapping, bump mapping, and parallax mapping to give textures a more realistic appearance; the latter is used extensively to give the appearance of depth to flat bullet hole sprites on walls. It also uses volumetric lighting, lightmapping, and a per-pixel lighting model, which allows for complex lighting effects. Vertex, pixel, and high-level shaders are also featured in the game. Cutscenes were built using Havok and Bink Video.

===AI===
The game&#x27;s AI was the culmination of work which Monolith had begun with &quot;The Operative: No One Lives Forever&quot; (2000) and &quot;No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.&#x27;s Way&quot; (2002). In developing the AI routines, the team&#x27;s main goal was to try to match the NPCs&#x27; intelligence with the player&#x27;s skill level. According to Jeff Orkin, senior AI engineer, &quot;our goal is not to have the players dominated by the AI, but we want them to learn to respect the AI so much that even the easy kills provide a sense of accomplishment.&quot;

To accomplish this, &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; was the first video game to use &quot;GOAP&quot; (Goal Oriented Action Planning). GOAP is a STRIPS-based architecture that allows NPCs more autonomy than simply reacting to the player. Instead, they decide on a goal from a list of options and plan how best to reach that goal. To do so, the game uses two standard AI components – A* and a Finite-state machine (FSM) – but it uses them in unconventional ways. Usually, the FSM controls all NPC behavior by way of a list of possible states, with A* planning the paths. In &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot;, however, the FSM has only three states (&quot;GoTo&quot;, &quot;Animate&quot;, and &quot;UseSmartObject&quot;), and A* is used to plan sequences of action as well as to plan paths. In essence, this means that A* navigates the FSM, selects the state, selects when to initiate a state transition, and selects what parameters to fulfil in each state (e.g. it doesn&#x27;t just initiate a transition into the GoTo state, it also specifies a location and, upon reaching that location, it specifies to transition to the animation state and what animation to play).

The logic determining when to transition from one state to another usually has to be specified manually by a programmer, meaning goals have a hard-coded and unalterable plan. In &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot;, however, GOAP handles this, with the planning system deciding how best to achieve any of the 70 available goals, using any combination of the 120 actions encoded in the game. Orkin explains that &quot;with a planning system, we can just toss in goals and actions. We never have to manually specify the transitions between these behaviors. The AI figures out the dependencies themselves at run-time based on the goal state and the preconditions and effects of actions.&quot; This is manifested in the gameplay insofar as,

The AI must make these decisions almost instantly, as GOAP is designed so that each choice is complete by the time the next frame starts. When the AI is searching through the available actions within the state-space, it must constantly reevaluate this process based on what is happening in the game world. To do this, separate sensors are used to gather information, with world-knowledge cached locally so the AI always has information immediately available. Because of this, the AI is constantly changing its plan based upon what the player is doing – if the player throws a grenade, the NPCs will flee; if the player is being very aggressive, they&#x27;ll be defensive; if the player is hiding, they&#x27;ll be offensive and try to flush him out. An important part of this is the AI&#x27;s freedom of movement within the game world. According to Orkin,

In relation to squad behavior, Orkin explains that &quot;AI have goals to respond to orders, and it is up to the AI to prioritize following those orders versus satisfying other goals.&quot; When a character seems to respond to a verbal command (for example, when a character is told to flank), what is happening is that the AI has decided to flank the player, reasoning that a flanking maneuvre is the best way to fulfil its goal. This decision then triggers the nearest character to play the audio &quot;flank&quot;, followed by the original character beginning to move to the location, thus making it appear as if the NPC is responding to the command. In actuality, it&#x27;s the command that is responding to the NPC, but it gives the illusion of verbal orders being followed.

The game&#x27;s AI was universally lauded upon the original PC release. It went on to win &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s &quot;2005 Best AI Award&quot;, and earned the #2 ranking on AIGameDev&#x27;s &quot;Most Influential AI Games&quot; in 2007. The GOAP system went on to be used in games such as &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl&quot; (2007), &quot;Just Cause 2&quot; (2010), &quot;&quot; (2010), &quot;F.E.A.R. 3&quot; (2011), and &quot;Deus Ex: Human Revolution&quot; (2011), as well as subsequent Monolith games, such as &quot;Condemned 2: Bloodshot&quot; (2008), &quot;F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin&quot; (2009), &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&quot; (2014), and &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of War&quot; (2017).

===Audio and music===
In keeping with &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot;″s tonal influences, the sound design and music were designed in the style of Japanese horror films, particularly their tendency to produce tension from ambient sound. The audio engineers used inexpensive equipment to create crude sound effects, employing methods such as dragging metal across different surfaces and recording pump sounds. Composer Nathan Grigg says of the sound design, &quot;sometimes the absence of sound is the best sound. The blank spaces are some of the most disturbing parts of the game. They allow players to fill in the space, which lets their imagination create their own personal horror.&quot;

In relation to the music, Grigg acknowledges that &quot;sound and music blurred a little bit.&quot; He wanted the score to be &quot;more cerebral and tailored to each individual event&quot;, pointing out that &quot;sometimes the music is used to ratchet up the tension to toy with players ... [it] will build to a terrifying crescendo before cutting off without a corresponding event, only to later have the silence shattered by Alma, when players least expect it&quot;.

===Promotion===
In 2005, &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; made playable appearances at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the Game Developers Conference (GDC), and E3, all of which were well received. A week after the CES show in January, game journalists were allowed to play the game&#x27;s multiplayer component for the first time. The game&#x27;s showing at E3 garnered it the Game Critics Award for &quot;Best Action Game&quot;. A single-player demo was released to the public in August. The following week, Vivendi allowed journalists to play through the first four levels of the game, unabridged, which generated even more positive reaction than their previous hands-on experiences. A multiplayer demo was released in September. A week before release, Vivendi had film director John Carpenter attend a number of media events, giving his thoughts on the game, of which he said, it was &quot;as close as I&#x27;ve ever come to playing a movie.&quot;

====&quot;P.A.N.I.C.S.&quot;====
In the lead-up to the game&#x27;s release in October 2005, episodes were released online of a comedy miniseries created by Rooster Teeth and distributed by BeSeen Communications. P.A.N.I.C.S. (&quot;People Acting Normal In Crazy-Ass Situations&quot;) is a parody of &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot;, produced primarily by way of the machinima technique of synchronizing footage created by a game engine (in this case, the LithTech Jupiter EX) to pre-recorded dialogue and audio effects. Vivendi commissioned Rooster Teeth and BeSeen to make the series as a viral marketing campaign, with Lori Inman, Vivendi&#x27;s Senior Brand Manager, stating, &quot;with &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; we knew we had a very special title combining a cutting edge FPS engine with a spine-tingling storyline. We liked the idea of creating a humorous viral machinima series that would entertain fans and showcase the spectacular visuals and character animations offered in the game.&quot;

The mini-series consists of five episodes, each running between three and four minutes. Four episodes were released in the weeks prior to the game&#x27;s launch (&quot;Enter Frank&quot; on September 30, &quot;Who Wants the Wing?&quot; on October 1, &quot;The Writing on the Walls&quot; on October 10, and &quot;All Things Must Come to an End...&quot; on October 19). A fifth episode – Episode #0, set moments before &quot;Enter Frank&quot; – was included with &quot;F.E.A.R. Director&#x27;s Edition&quot;. The story centers on Frank, a new recruit into Bravo Team, a special military group formed to battle supernatural enemies. As the series begins, Bravo Team has been sent into a military facility to investigate reports of paranormal activity. As team members start dying in horrific fashion, Frank is incredulous to learn his teammates don&#x27;t believe in the paranormal and keep coming up with increasingly ridiculous explanations for what is happening.

====Alma Interview and comic====
Included with the &quot;Director&#x27;s Edition&quot; of the game were the Alma Interview prequel and the Dark Horse comic prequel.

&quot;Alma Interview&quot; is a series of four snippets from an interview between ATC employee Dr. Green and the seven-year-old Alma in the lead-up to her being placed in Project Origin. In the first clip, as Wade observes from behind a one-way mirror, Green tries to strike up a rapport with Alma by telling her about her own daughter and telling her she&#x27;s pretty, but Alma refuses to speak. In the second clip, Green is distracted by a voice seemingly coming from a vent, and when she turns around, Alma disappears. Green sees Alma&#x27;s reflection in the mirror, and when she turns around again, Alma is back in the room. In the third clip, Green tries threatening Alma, telling her that if she doesn&#x27;t cooperate, she will be placed back in her cell. Alma responds by telepathically forcing Green to draw a disturbing picture of a child surrounded by blackness. In the fourth clip, Alma asks Green, &quot;do you like to play games?&quot; When Green says no, Alma says, &quot;I have a game&quot;, and Green finds herself suddenly trapped in a vent. When she just as quickly finds herself back in the room, she demands that Wade let her out, but he ignores her. Alma then asks Green, &quot;Who are they? I see them when I close my eyes. They say they know you. They say you made them. They say you&#x27;re going to kill me.&quot; As a terrified Green tries frantically to open the door, Alma dances around her, before sitting back down. In the observation room, Wade doesn&#x27;t react to anything he sees.

Written by Alden Freewater with art by Edwin David, the Dark Horse comic takes place moments before the game begins and expands on the game&#x27;s opening cutscene. At ATC headquarters, as Alma telepathically contacts Fettel, a new recruit to the security detail is learning about Fettel and the Replicas. One of the employees explains that ATC is worried about a second synchronicity event; in the previous one, Fettel&#x27;s &quot;brainwaves changed, like someone else had entered his mind.&quot; The team then see Alma in the corridor near Fettel&#x27;s room and send the new recruit to investigate. Meanwhile, Fettel promises Alma that he&#x27;ll find her no matter what, and the door to his cell blasts open. When the recruit arrives, Alma kills him as Fettel leaves his cell. The Replicas then activate and open fire, killing everyone they encounter. Fettel approaches an employee and demands to know where Alma is. When the man says he doesn&#x27;t know, Fettel replies, &quot;your tongue can lie, but your flesh will tell me everything.&quot; He then takes out a knife and begins to cut and consume part of the man.

===Ports===
The Xbox 360 port was announced in May 2006. Vivendi revealed that the game would be shown later that month at E3 and that the port was being handled by Day 1 Studios rather than original developers Monolith, who were now owned by Warner Bros. New to this version of the game was an &quot;Instant Action&quot; mode for single-player. In this mode, players are dropped into a modified level and must get to a designated point as quickly as possible while simultaneously killing as many enemies as possible and being as accurate as possible. At the end of the level, the game uploads players&#x27; stats to a global leaderboard on Xbox Live. Graphically, the Xbox 360 version was equivalent to the PC version on maximum settings and Day 1 also increased the native resolution to 720p and added high dynamic range lighting, an advanced particle system, and HD textures. The Xbox version also features an exclusive bonus level not found in the PC original, which depicts Holiday&#x27;s attempt to extract Bishop from ATC headquarters. This version also features a new weapon – dual wielded automatic handguns.

The PlayStation 3 port was announced in August 2006, with Vivendi revealing it would be one of the console&#x27;s launch titles, scheduled for North American release on November 17. Like the Xbox 360 version, the PlayStation 3 port was developed by Day 1 Studios. This port features the same Instant Action mode from the Xbox 360 version. It also has its own exclusive additional weapon (a street sweeper shotgun) and bonus mission, which depicts the Delta Force recon team&#x27;s journey through ATC headquarters prior to encountering Alma. Like the Xbox version, the game&#x27;s native resolution was 720p, but the other enhancements were removed for this version. In early November, Sierra announced that the PlayStation 3 port had been pushed back to February 2007. In February, they announced it had been pushed back to April.

In relation to the additional content in the two ports, and why it differed from system to system, producer Rob Loftus explained, &quot;we wanted everybody to feel like they got something special. But at the same time, we didn&#x27;t want to put more content in one version and have the other version suffer for it.&quot;

Monolith themselves were unhappy with the ports, specifically the difference in quality from the original, especially on the PlayStation 3. In December 2008, &quot;Project Origin&quot;″s lead artist, Dave Matthews, told &quot;CVG&quot; that for the sequel, &quot;we&#x27;re handling all three versions, we&#x27;ve changed our development structure to develop all three SKUs simultaneously and there&#x27;s no lead platform.&quot; The following month, he reiterated, &quot;the two ports were done outside of Monolith and from a Monolith perspective we feel they didn&#x27;t do everything that they could of achieved.&quot;

==Reception==
The initial PC release received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;, and holds a score of 88 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 57 reviews.

&quot;IGN&quot;″s Tom McNamara scored it 9.2 out of 10, praising the atmosphere and weapon variety. Although he was critical of the repetitive environments and cliched plot, he called the game &quot;one of the best shooters this year&quot;, finding it to be the best first-person shooter since &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; (2004). &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Jason Ocampo scored it 9.1 out of 10, arguing that it &quot;elevates the genre to a whole new level of intensity.&quot; He especially praised the combat mechanics (&quot;some of the greatest gunplay available&quot;), the implementation of slow-motion, and the AI (&quot;the smartest, most aggressive, most tactically oriented AI opponents that we&#x27;ve ever encountered&quot;). His criticisms focused on a lack of enemy variety, repetitive environments, and a weak plot.

&quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Tom Bramwell scored the game 9 out of 10. He too praised the implementation of slow-motion (which he found superior to the &quot;Max Payne&quot; series) and the combat mechanics (which he found superior to both &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; and &quot;Doom 3&quot;). He also praised the AI, especially at higher difficulties. Although he was critical of the environments and weak plot, he concluded that the game felt &quot;fresh and compelling.&quot; &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Adam Biessener also scored it 9 out of 10. He too was critical of the plot and level design, but he argued that the gameplay was so good as to make up for these problems. He especially praised the AI (&quot;hands down the smartest AI-controlled opponents I&#x27;ve ever faced&quot;) and the combat mechanics (&quot;intense almost to the point of sensory overload&quot;).

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Shawn Elliott scored it 4 out of 5. Although he was critical of the plot and the game&#x27;s horror element (citing &quot;treadmill scare tactics&quot;), he praised the combat mechanics, AI, and implementation of slow motion. Charles Herold of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found it to be &quot;as thrilling and involving as &quot;Half-Life&quot;, but [lacking] its narrative panache.&quot; He also criticised the characterisation, and felt that the encounters with Alma were &quot;disconnected from the rest of the game.&quot;

;Xbox 360

Like the PC version, the Xbox 360 port received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;, and holds a score of 85 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 44 reviews.

&quot;IGN&quot;″s Eric Brudvig scored it 9.1 out of 10, praising the atmosphere, combat mechanics, AI, graphics, and instant action mode, but criticising the story and level design. He was also impressed with the quality of the port itself; &quot;&quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; has made it from the PC to 360 with everything that made it an outstanding experience.&quot; &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Kristen Reed scored it 9 out of 10, calling it the most exciting game since &quot;Burnout 2: Point of Impact&quot; (2001). He especially praised the combat mechanics, AI, and implementation of slow motion. Although he was critical of the environments, lack of enemy variety, and the &quot;unengaging&quot; plot, he concluded, &quot;it gets the core of the experience so absolutely spot-on.&quot;

&quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Jason Ocampo scored it 8.6 out of 10. As with many others, he was critical of the lack of enemy variety, the repetitive level design, and the plot. However, he praised the combat mechanics, implementation of slow-motion, AI, multiplayer, and graphics, calling it &quot;easily one of the most intense and atmospheric games on the Xbox 360.&quot; The UK edition of &quot;Official Xbox Magazine&quot; scored it 8 out of 10, praising the AI and slow motion, but criticising the level design and plot.

;PlayStation 3

The PlayStation 3 port received &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;, with a score of 72 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on, 31 reviews.

&quot;IGN&quot;″s Greg Miller scored it 8.1 out of 10, and was unimpressed with the graphics and the loading times, which he clocked at up to one minute. Although he wrote that &quot;the PS3 doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to the visuals found in the Xbox 360 version&quot;, he argued that the game is &quot;still one of the best experiences I&#x27;ve had on a PS3,&quot; praising the combat mechanics and multiplayer. &quot;PSM3&quot;″s Tim Edwards scored it 7.2 out of 10, and was critical of the game&#x27;s pace, the graphics, and the complex controls, although he was impressed with multiplayer and instant action mode.

&quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Jason Ocampo scored it 7.1 out of 10, arguing that it &quot;lacks the level of polish and atmosphere seen in the previous two versions.&quot; He especially criticised the load times and the &quot;erratic frame rate&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; scored it 5 out of 10, with Joe Rybicki calling it &quot;a tragedy&quot; and citing &quot;inexcusable technical issues&quot;, such as stuttering graphics, a delay when pressing fire, and sound coming from everywhere instead of being localised. He praised the atmosphere and the AI, but called it &quot;one of the most reprehensible ports in recent memory.&quot;

===Sales and awards===
The game was a commercial success. The PC version received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 units in the United Kingdom. By the time the game was released on PlayStation 3 in April 2007, the combined worldwide sales of the PC and Xbox 360 versions was over two million units. The PlayStation 3 version itself was the console&#x27;s best selling title in April, moving 45,864 units in North America.

&quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; won &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot;″s 2005 &quot;Best Sound Effects&quot; award, and was a runner-up for their list of the year&#x27;s 10 best PC games. It won 2005&#x27;s &quot;Best Action Game&quot; from both the Game Critics Awards and &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;. &quot;GameSpy&quot; awarded it their 2005 &quot;Best Story&quot; award. In &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s 2005 annual awards, it won &quot;Best AI&quot; and &quot;Best Graphics (Technical)&quot;. At the 4th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards in 2006, it shared the &quot;Best Use of Multi-Channel Surround&quot; with &quot;Call of Duty 2&quot;. At the 9th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, it was nominated for Computer Game of the Year, First-Person Action Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design, and Outstanding Achievement in Visual Engineering.

==Editions and expansions==
===&quot;Director&#x27;s Edition&quot;===
&quot;F.E.A.R. Director&#x27;s Edition&quot; was announced a few weeks prior to the release of the game and was released alongside it. Accompanying the basic CD-ROM version of the game was a DVD version, which also contains the Dark Horse comic prequel, &quot;Alma Interview&quot;, a &quot;Making of &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot;&quot; documentary, a one-hour &quot;Developers&#x27; commentary&quot; (featuring writer/director/designer Craig Hubbard, artist David Longo, producer Chris Hewitt, programmer Kevin Stephens, and lead level designer John Mulkey), and &quot;Episode #0&quot; of &quot;P.A.N.I.C.S.&quot;

===&quot;Extraction Point&quot;===

The first standalone expansion, &quot;F.E.A.R. Extraction Point&quot;, was announced for PC in early May 2006. The expansion was being developed by TimeGate Studios. Because of rights issues (Monolith, who had been purchased by Warner in 2004, owned the rights to the IP and characters, but Vivendi still owned the name &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot;), it was clarified in a press release that the plot for &quot;Extraction Point&quot; had been approved by Monolith and was in line with their own plans for a full sequel, which had been announced in February. The game was first shown at E3 2006.

===&quot;Perseus Mandate&quot;===

Also developed by TimeGate, the second standalone expansion, &quot;F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate&quot;, was announced for PC in July 2007 and first shown at E3 that year. It is not a narrative a sequel to &quot;Extraction Point&quot;, but is instead a sidequel to both the base game and the first expansion, focusing on a different three-man F.E.A.R. squad.

===&quot;F.E.A.R. Files&quot;===
&quot;F.E.A.R. Files&quot; was announced for Xbox 360 in July 2007, containing both &quot;Extraction Point&quot; (which had hitherto only been available for PC) and &quot;Perseus Mandate&quot;. Originally, the plan was to release it on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but the PlayStation version was cancelled. As well as the two standalone expansions, &quot;F.E.A.R. Files&quot; also includes seven new instant action maps and five new multiplayer maps.

===&quot;Gold Edition&quot; and &quot;Platinum Collection&quot;===
Released on Windows in March 2007, &quot;F.E.A.R. Gold Edition&quot; includes all the content from the &quot;Director&#x27;s Edition&quot; plus &quot;Extraction Point&quot;. &quot;F.E.A.R. Platinum Collection&quot; was released for Windows in November 2007, and includes the &quot;Director&#x27;s Edition&quot;, &quot;Extraction Point&quot;, and &quot;Perseus Mandate&quot;. The complete &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; series was released on Steam in July 2012, with the &quot;Platinum Collection&quot; only available as part of the bundle. The &quot;Platinum Collection&quot; was released on GOG.com in February 2015. In November 2021, the &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; franchise was added to Microsoft&#x27;s backward compatibility program, making the games playable on the Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.

==Sequel and canonicity==

In February 2006, Monolith confirmed they would be making a sequel to the original game, explaining that because Vivendi owned the rights to the &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; name, the sequel would come under a different title. Up to September 2008, the sequel was to be called simply &quot;Project Origin&quot;, but that month, Monolith and Warner regained the rights to the &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; name, allowing them to name the game &quot;F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin&quot;. In December 2008, it was confirmed that despite initial reports that Monolith had approved the story for the two expansions and that that story was in line with their plans for a sequel, &quot;Project Origin&quot; would in fact ignore the events of both &quot;Extraction Point&quot; and &quot;Perseus Mandate&quot; and instead serve as a direct sequel to the original game. &quot;Project Origin&quot;″s lead artist, Dave Matthews, explained that the expansions

<text>Erling Norvik (9 April 1928 – 31 December 1998) was a Norwegian politician from the Conservative Party.

Norvik was born in Vadsø, the son of Erling Johannes Norvik, who served in the Norwegian parliament (&quot;Stortinget&quot;) from 1949 to 1961. The younger Norvik started his professional career as a journalist for the regional paper Finnmarken when he was 12 years old and was elected to Stortinget in 1961 from his native county, Finnmark, succeeding his father.

Norvik was seated in the legislature for three successive periods, from 1961 to 1973 and then resigned to become the leader of the Conservative Party, a post he held from 1974–1980 and 1984–1986. He turned down a ministerial post in 1981, choosing instead to work in the prime minister office&#x27;s of his party colleague Kåre Willoch.

In 1986 he was appointed Governor (&quot;Fylkesmann&quot;) of Østfold county, as which he served for 12 years.

<text>This Beautiful Mess is the second studio album by American band Sixpence None the Richer, released in 1995 (see 1995 in music). The recording was produced by Armand John Petri, who also managed the band from 1993 to 1997. &quot;This Beautiful Mess&quot; surpassed 50,000 copies sold during its first year of release and laid the foundation for Sixpence&#x27;s self-titled breakout album two years later. &quot;This Beautiful Mess&quot; won the 1996 Dove Award for &quot;Alternative/Modern Rock Album of the Year.&quot; The songs &quot;Within a Room Somewhere&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot; were both minor hits on the Christian music charts.

Two bands named after this album exist. The first originated in Colorado Springs, Colorado in 1996 and went on to become OneRepublic. The second, formed in 1997, is the Dutch rock quintet from the Netherlands.

==Critical reception==
At the time of the album&#x27;s release, Sixpence None the Richer were stereotyped as both an indie band and a Christian band, which led to &quot;This Beautiful Mess&quot; receiving relatively little in the way of attention from the secular or &quot;mainstream&quot; music industries — the band&#x27;s lead vocalist, Leigh Nash, stated during a 1999 interview, &quot;we really knocked ourselves out for [&quot;This Beautiful Mess&quot;] and it didn’t really go anywhere.&quot; — although the attention it did receive was generally positive. The magazine &quot;Cross Rhythms&quot; highly praised it, saying &quot;This, their second (proper) album, has been eagerly awaited and does not disappoint.&quot;, and AllMusic gave a moderately favorable review with particular praise going to the songs &quot;Within a Room, Somewhere&quot;, calling it &quot;one of the strongest songs of the album,&quot; and &quot;Melting Alone,&quot; which &quot;keenly expresses the pain of loneliness.&quot;

However, following the release of their eponymous album in 1997 and the explosion in popularity of the song &quot;Kiss Me&quot; in 1999, the band began to gather a much larger following outside of the Christian music industry. Accordingly, in the years since, &quot;This Beautiful Mess&quot; has also received more, mostly positive, attention. Alan Parish penned an opinion piece for the online blog Medium, in which he detailed the profound impact the album had on his life, writing, &quot;It was the best complete album I had ever heard, and to this day I consider it my favorite album of all time. [...] The internal emotions and thoughts this album spurred in me gave me a confidence and self-worth I had never before experienced.&quot; Jesus Freak Hideout noted that the album was a step up from their previous work and that the addition of three new members since then made Sixpence None the Richer &quot;a full band,&quot; and ultimately summarized the album as &quot;a must for fans of 90s alternative rock, and jangle pop, and those digging deeper into the history of Contemporary Christian Music.&quot;

<doc id="1192797" wikidata="Q5166838" url="?curid=1192797" title="Cooee">
<text>Cooee! () is a shout that originated in Australia to attract attention, find missing people, or to indicate one&#x27;s own location. When done correctly—loudly and shrilly—a call of &quot;cooee&quot; can carry over a considerable distance. The distance one&#x27;s cooee call travels can be a matter of competitive pride. It is also known as a call of help, distinct amongst the natural sounds of the bush.

The word &quot;cooee&quot; originates from the Dharug language of Aboriginal Australians in the Sydney area. The call was used by Aboriginal people to communicate with another person at a distance. &#x27;Coo-ee&#x27; was typically expressed as a long loud call ending on a shrill rising inflection on the &#x27;ee&#x27;. The call was later adopted by the colonial settlers and was widely used as a signal, especially in the bush. It means &quot;come here&quot; and has now become widely used in Australia as a call over distances.

== History and usage ==

As cooee is of Aboriginal origin, it is likely to have been in used by some Aboriginal peoples, for many thousands of years.

The first recorded reference to the Aboriginal &#x27;coo-ee&#x27; call is in the papers of Daniel Southwell, an officer of the Royal Navy and member of the crew of HMS &quot;Sirius&quot; that sailed with the First Fleet to Australia. He kept a journal and corresponded with his mother and uncle during his period in Sydney from 1788 to March 1791. Southwell&#x27;s letters had many references to the Aboriginal people of the Port Jackson district and included a brief vocabulary of their language. In his papers Southwell listed the verb &#x27;to come&#x27; as &quot;Coo-sé, Cō-cé, Cō-eé, Cō-é&quot;.

Francis Barrallier, during his expedition in 1802, recorded the local Aboriginal people using the &#x27;cooee&#x27; call near what is now Oakdale, New South Wales.

The explorer Thomas Mitchell, recording an incident in 1832 where one of his men came unexpectedly upon a native camp, wrote that &quot;his debut [was] outrageously opposed to their ideas of etiquette, which imperatively required that loud cooeys should have announced his approach before he came within a mile of their fires.&quot; He further explained in a footnote, that a &quot;cooey&quot; was &quot;The natives&#x27; mode of hailing each other when at a distance in the woods. It is so much more convenient than our own holla, or halloo, that it is universally adopted by the colonists of New South Wales.&quot;

Mitchell&#x27;s observation indicates that the use of Cooee was not confined to the coast and mountains near Sydney, but was used more widely, by Aboriginal peoples, and by the 1830s was also widely used by the settler colonists.

Author and missionary to Tasmania, Reverend John West, reported in 1852 that &quot;cooey&quot; was &quot;not unknown in certain neighbourhoods of the metropolis&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot;, London). In 1864, an English slang dictionary reported: &quot;Cooey, the Australian bush-call, now not unfrequently heard in the streets of London&quot;. One of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes mysteries hinges on the use of &quot;cooee&quot;. &quot;The Boscombe Valley Mystery&quot;, first published in 1891, is solved partly because, unlike everyone else, Holmes recognises the call as one commonly used among Australians. In 1917, the Anglo-Welsh poet Edward Thomas used &quot;coo-ee&quot; as the parting word with his wife Helen, on leaving for the Western Front from which he never returned; a fact commemorated at a 2014 Remembrance service in Glasgow.

The expression &quot;within cooee&quot; has developed within Australian as slang for &quot;within a manageable distance&quot;. It is often used in the negative sense (i.e., &quot;you&#x27;re not even within cooee&quot;, meaning not close to or, a long way off). Another example would be: &quot;They realised they were lost and there was no-one within cooee&quot;. It is also use in the abstract (e.g., &quot;How much do you think they spent redoing this place?&quot; &quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t know, five thousand dollars?&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re not even within &quot;cooee&quot;—twenty-five thousand!&quot;).

The word &quot;cooee&quot; has become a name of many organisations, places and even events. Perhaps the most historic of these was the Cooee March during the First World War. It was staged by 35 men from Gilgandra, New South Wales, northwest of Sydney, as a recruiting drive after enthusiasm for the war waned in 1915 with the first casualty lists. They marched to Sydney calling &quot;Cooee!&quot; to encourage others to come and enlist. A poster read &quot;Coo-ee – Won&#x27;t you come?&quot;. When they reached Sydney on 12 December, the group had grown to 277. To this day, Gilgandra holds a yearly Cooee Festival in October to commemorate the event. Other Cooee Festivals occur across Australia.

Richard White indicates the important means of demonstrating Australian nationality with the call taking on a consciously nationalistic meaning. He also documents its spread through the Empire, to New Zealand and South Africa.

<doc id="1192801" wikidata="Q5451255" url="?curid=1192801" title="Fire-Eaters">
<text>In American history, the Fire-Eaters were a loosely aligned group of radical pro-secession Democrats in the antebellum South who urged the separation of the slave states into a new nation, in which chattel slavery and a distinctive &quot;Southern civilization&quot; would be preserved. Some sought to revive American participation in the Atlantic slave trade, which had been illegal since 1808. After eleven southern states declared independence from the United States in 1861, several Fire-Eaters were outspoken critics of the new Confederate government during the American Civil War.

==Impact==
Dubbed “Fire-Eaters” by critics, the group was not a cohesive political faction but a collection of radical democrats well known for their extreme rhetoric and nationalist demands for an independent southern nation. Among the best known Fire-Eaters were Edmund Ruffin, Robert Rhett, Louis T. Wigfall, and William Lowndes Yancey. By urging secession in the South, the Fire-Eaters aggravated the growth of divisive sectionalism in the U.S., and they materially contributed to the outbreak of the Civil War (1861–1865). 

At an 1850 convention in Nashville, Tennessee, Fire-Eaters urged Southern secession, citing what they called irreconcilable differences between the North and the South, and they inflamed passions by using propaganda against the North. However, the Compromise of 1850 and other concessions isolated the Fire-Eaters for a while.

In the latter half of the 1850s, the group reemerged. During the election of 1856, Fire-Eaters used threats of secession to persuade Northerners, who generally valued saving the Union over fighting slavery, to vote for James Buchanan. They used several recent events for propaganda, among them &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; and the caning of Charles Sumner, to accuse the North of trying to abolish slavery immediately. Using effective propaganda against 1860 presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln, the nominee of the anti-slavery Republican Party, the Fire-Eaters were able to convince many Southerners of this. However, Lincoln, despite abolitionist sentiment within the party, had promised not to abolish slavery in the Southern states, but only to prevent its expansion into the Western territories. They first targeted South Carolina, which passed an Ordinance of Secession in December 1860. Wigfall, for one, actively encouraged an attack on Fort Sumter to prompt Virginia and other upper Southern States to secede as well. The Fire-Eaters helped to unleash a chain reaction that led directly to the formation of the Confederate States of America and the Civil War. Their influence waned quickly after the start of major fighting.

<text>The first USS &quot;Weehawken&quot; was a ironclad monitor in the United States Navy during the American Civil War. She was named after Weehawken, New Jersey.
==History==
&quot;Weehawken&quot; was launched on 5 November 1862 at Jersey City, New Jersey by Zeno Secor &amp; Company; sponsored by Ms. Nellie Cornstock; and commissioned on 18 January 1863, Captain John Rodgers in command.

&quot;Weehawken&quot; was an improved and enlarged version of . Accompanied by and towed by , she departed New York on 18 January 1863, bound for Port Royal, South Carolina, and duty with the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. The three vessels encountered gale-force winds and high seas off the New Jersey coast on 20 January. &quot;Iroquois&quot; and &quot;Boardman&quot; headed for sheltered waters; but Rodgers pressed on in &quot;Weehawken&quot;. The &quot;Passaic&quot; ironclads differed from the original &quot;Monitor&quot; in having less deck overhang and a rounded lower hull. This enabled &quot;Weehawken&quot; – unlike her famous prototype – to ride out a heavy sea with relative ease. Rodgers reported that &quot;the behavior of the vessel was easy, buoyant, and indicative of thorough safety.&quot; &quot;Weehawken&quot; put into Norfolk for minor repairs, leaving on 1 February in tow of screw steamer . She arrived at Port Royal on 5 February, and deployed in the blockade off Charleston, South Carolina.

On 7 April, &quot;Weehawken&quot; led the Union fleet in the first major naval assault against Confederate installations in Charleston harbor. The attack failed miserably, and the fleet withdrew after only 40 minutes. During the action, &quot;Weehawken&quot; took 59 hits and had a torpedo (naval mine) explode beneath her keel without suffering serious damage. Shortly after the attack, Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren replaced Rear Admiral Samuel Francis DuPont as commander of the squadron.

After repairs, &quot;Weehawken&quot; proceeded to Wassaw Sound, Georgia, on 10 June to block the expected sortie of ironclad . The Confederate ram and two escort steamers showed themselves early on the morning of 17 June. &quot;Weehawken&quot; and weighed anchor to meet &quot;Atlanta&quot; which ran hard aground only moments after entering the sound. &quot;Weehawken&quot; commenced firing at 05:15 and ceased a quarter of an hour later when the Confederate vessel surrendered. With only five shots, Rodgers blew the roof off &quot;Atlanta&quot;″s pilothouse and pierced the grounded ram&#x27;s casemate, putting two gun crews out of action. Capt. Rodgers became a national hero and received commendations from Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, President Abraham Lincoln, and Congress. He was promoted to commodore and ordered north to command the new ironclad . Both &quot;Weehawken&quot; and &quot;Atlanta&quot; returned to Port Royal.
&quot;Weehawken&quot; resumed operations against Confederate strongholds in and around Charleston harbor. On 10–11 July, Union ironclads , , &quot;Nahant&quot;, and &quot;Weehawken&quot; shelled Confederate batteries at Fort Wagner on Morris Island, South Carolina, to cover an Army amphibious landing under Brigadier General Quincy A. Gillmore. Despite additional bombardments on 18 and 24 July, the monitors failed to silence the fort, leaving General Gillmore&#x27;s troops pinned down on the beach caught between a murderous hail of cross fire. Fort Wagner was finally reduced during a naval bombardment of Forts Gregg, Sumter, and Moultrie on 17 August.

&quot;Weehawken&quot;, &quot;Montauk&quot;, &quot;Nahant&quot;, , and now took aim at Fort Sumter, pounding it to rubble during two separate bombardments on 23 August and 1–2 September. Admiral Dahlgren demanded Sumter&#x27;s surrender on 7 September and ordered &quot;Weehawken&quot; to deploy in a narrow channel between the fort and Cumming&#x27;s Point on Morris Island. There, &quot;Weehawken&quot; grounded, taking concentrated gunfire from Fort Moultrie and Sullivan&#x27;s and James Island. The vessel was refloated with the help of tugs on 8 September, and received a &quot;Well done!&quot; from Admiral Dahlgren for outstanding defensive gunnery while aground. &quot;Weehawken&quot; repaired at Port Royal until 4 October, then returned to Charleston for routine patrol duty in the harbor.

The next two months were uneventful, and &quot;Weehawken&quot; lay anchored off Morris Island during a moderate gale early on the morning of 6 December. Suddenly, the ironclad signalled for assistance and appeared to observers ashore to be sinking. Attempts to beach the vessel failed, and she sank bow first five minutes later in of water. A court of inquiry found that &quot;Weehawken&quot; had recently taken on a considerable amount of heavy ammunition in her forward compartments. This change excessively reduced her forward freeboard, causing water to rush down an open hawsepipe and hatch during the storm. As the bow sank, and the stern rose, water could not flow aft to the pumps and the vessel foundered.

Four officers and 27 enlisted men drowned aboard &quot;Weehawken&quot;.

<doc id="1192805" wikidata="Q1777563" url="?curid=1192805" title="White coat hypertension">
<text>White coat hypertension (WHT), also known as white coat syndrome, is a form of labile hypertension in which people exhibit a blood pressure level above the normal range in a clinical setting, although they do not exhibit it in other settings. It is believed that the phenomenon is due to anxiety experienced during a clinic visit. The patient&#x27;s daytime ambulatory blood pressure is used as a reference as it takes into account ordinary levels of daily stress.

Masked hypertension (MH) is the contrasting phenomenon, whereby a patient&#x27;s blood pressure is above the normal range during daily living but not in a clinic setting.

==Diagnosis==
In studies, white coat hypertension can be defined as the presence of a defined hypertensive average blood pressure in a clinic setting, although it isn&#x27;t present when the patient is at home.

Diagnosis is made difficult as a result of the unreliable measures taken from the conventional methods of detection. These methods often involve an interface with health care professionals and frequently results are tarnished by a list of factors including variability in the individual&#x27;s blood pressure, technical inaccuracies, anxiety of the patient, inadequate cuff size of the instrument (sphygmomanometer) used to measure blood pressure, recent ingestion of pressor substances, and talking, amongst many other factors. Automated blood pressure measurements over 15 to 20 minutes in a quiet part of the office or clinic can reduce (but not eliminate) incorrect blood pressure measures.

People with white coat hypertension do not exhibit the signs indicative of trepidation and their increased blood pressure is often not accompanied by tachycardia. This is supported by studies that repeatedly indicate that 15%–30% of those thought to have mild hypertension as a result of clinic or office recordings display normal blood pressure and no unusual response to pressure stimulus. These persons did not show any specific characteristics such as age that may be indicative of a higher susceptibility to white coat hypertension.

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and patient self-measurement using a home blood pressure monitoring device is being increasingly used to differentiate those with white coat hypertension or experiencing the white coat effect from those with chronic hypertension. This does not mean that these methods are without fault. Daytime ambulatory values, despite taking into account stresses of everyday life when taken during the patient&#x27;s daily routine, are still susceptible to the effects of daily variables such as physical activity, stress and duration of sleep. Ambulatory monitoring has been found to be the more practical and reliable method in detecting patients with white coat hypertension and for the prediction of target organ damage. Even as such, the diagnosis and treatment of white coat hypertension remains controversial.

A 2006 study of 98 patients showed that home blood pressure monitoring is as accurate as a 24-hour ambulatory monitoring in determining blood pressure levels.

Use of breathing patterns has been proposed as a technique for identifying white coat hypertension.

In one Turkish study of 438 consecutive patients, 38% were normotensive, 43% had white coat hypertension, 2% had masked hypertension, and 15% had sustained hypertension. Even patients taking medication for sustained hypertension who are normotensive at home may exhibit white coat hypertension in the office setting.

==Implications for treatment==
When blood pressure is measured only in a clinic setting, an incorrect diagnosis of hypertension may be made whereas the person actually has white coat hypertension. In general, individuals with white coat hypertension have lower morbidity than patients with sustained hypertension, but higher morbidity than the clinically normotensive.

<doc id="1192806" wikidata="Q464782" url="?curid=1192806" title="American Gothic">
<text>American Gothic is a 1930 oil on beaverwood painting by the American Regionalist artist Grant Wood. Depicting a Midwestern farmer and his daughter standing in front of their Carpenter Gothic style home, &quot;American Gothic&quot; is one of the most famous American paintings of the 20th century and is frequently referenced in popular culture.

Wood was inspired to paint what is now known as the &quot;American Gothic&quot; House in Eldon, Iowa, along with &quot;the kind of people [he] fancied should live in that house&quot;. 

The figures were modeled after Wood&#x27;s sister Nan Wood Graham and Byron McKeeby, the Wood family&#x27;s dentist. The woman is dressed in a colonial print apron evoking 20th-century rural Americana while the man is adorned in overalls covered by a suit jacket and carries a pitchfork. The plants on the porch of the house are mother-in-law&#x27;s tongue and beefsteak begonia, which also appear in Wood&#x27;s 1929 portrait of his mother, &quot;Woman with Plants&quot;.

From 2016 to 2017, the painting was displayed in Paris at the Musée de l&#x27;Orangerie and in London at the Royal Academy of Arts, in its first showings outside the United States. The painting is currently displayed at the Art Institute of Chicago. 

==Creation==
In August 1930, Grant Wood, an American painter with European training, was driven around Eldon, Iowa, by a young local painter named John Sharp. Looking for inspiration, he noticed the Dibble House, a small white house built in the Carpenter Gothic architectural style. Sharp&#x27;s brother suggested in 1973 that it was on this drive that Wood first sketched the house on the back of an envelope. Wood&#x27;s earliest biographer, Darrell Garwood, noted that Wood &quot;thought it a form of borrowed pretentiousness, a structural absurdity, to put a Gothic-style window in such a flimsy frame house&quot;.

At the time, Wood classified it as one of the &quot;cardboardy frame houses on Iowa farms&quot; and considered it &quot;very paintable&quot;. After obtaining permission from the house&#x27;s owners, Selma Jones-Johnston and her family, Wood made a sketch the next day in oil paint on paperboard from the front yard. This sketch depicted a steeper roof and a longer window with a more pronounced ogive than on the actual house – features which eventually adorned the final work.

Wood decided to paint the house along with, in his words, &quot;the kind of people [he] fancied should live in that house&quot;. He recruited his sister, Nan (1899–1990), to be the model for the daughter, dressing her in a colonial-print apron mimicking 20th-century rural Americana. While preparing for the painting, Wood requested that she make the apron herself and include rickrack trim to better reflect the time period. As rickrack was no longer available in stores, Nan removed trim from their mother Hattie&#x27;s old dresses to apply to the apron. The model for the father was the Wood family&#x27;s dentist, Dr. Byron McKeeby (1867–1950) from Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Nan told people that her brother had envisioned the pair as father and daughter, not husband and wife, which Wood himself confirmed in his letter to a Mrs. Nellie Sudduth in 1941: &quot;The prim lady with him is his grown-up daughter.&quot;

Elements of the painting stress the &quot;vertical&quot; that is associated with Gothic architecture. The upright, three-pronged pitchfork is echoed in the stitching of the man&#x27;s overalls and shirt, the Gothic pointed-arch window of the house under the steeped roof, and the structure of the man&#x27;s face. However, Wood did not add figures to his sketch until he returned to his studio in Cedar Rapids. Moreover, he would not return to Eldon again, although he did request a photograph of the home to complete his painting.

==Reception and interpretation==

Wood entered the painting in a competition at the Art Institute of Chicago. One judge deemed it a &quot;comic valentine&quot;, but a museum patron persuaded the jury to award the painting the bronze medal and a $300 cash prize. The same patron also persuaded the Art Institute to buy the painting, and it remains part of the Chicago museum&#x27;s collection. The image soon began to be reproduced in newspapers, first by the &quot;Chicago Evening Post&quot;, and then in New York, Boston, Kansas City, and Indianapolis. However, when the image finally appeared in the &quot;Cedar Rapids Gazette&quot;, there was a backlash. Iowans were furious at their depiction as &quot;pinched, grim-faced, puritanical Bible-thumpers&quot;. Wood protested, saying that he had not painted a caricature of Iowans, but rather a depiction of his &quot;appreciation&quot;, stating &quot;I had to go to France to appreciate Iowa.&quot; In a 1941 letter, Wood said that, &quot;In general, I have found, the people who resent the painting are those who feel that they themselves resemble the portrayal.&quot;

Art critics who had favorable opinions about the painting, such as Gertrude Stein and Christopher Morley, similarly assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of rural small-town life. It was thus seen as part of the trend toward increasingly critical depictions of rural America along the lines of, in literature, Sherwood Anderson&#x27;s 1919 novel &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;, Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s 1920 &quot;Main Street&quot;, and Carl Van Vechten&#x27;s 1924 &quot;The Tattooed Countess&quot;.

However, with the deepening of the Great Depression not too long after the painting was made, &quot;American Gothic&quot; came to be seen as a depiction of the steadfast American pioneer spirit. Wood assisted this interpretive transition by renouncing his bohemian youth in Paris and grouping himself with populist Midwestern painters such as John Steuart Curry and Thomas Hart Benton, who revolted against the dominance of East Coast art circles. Wood was quoted in this period as stating, &quot;All the good ideas I&#x27;ve ever had came to me while I was milking a cow.&quot; Wood intended the painting to depict the farmer and his daughter as survivors, to pay homage to the strength of the rural community, and to provide reassurance in a time of great economic upset. 

American art historian Wanda M. Corn thinks that Wood was not painting a modern couple, but rather one of the past, pointing to the fact that Wood directed the models to wear old-fashioned clothing which he found inspiration for by consulting his family photo album. Wood even posed the figures in a way that resembled long-exposure photographs of Midwestern families that dated before World War I.

Art historian Tripp Evans interpreted it in 2010 as an &quot;old-fashioned mourning portrait ... Tellingly, the curtains hanging in the windows of the house, both upstairs and down, are pulled closed in the middle of the day, a mourning custom in Victorian America. The woman wears a black dress beneath her apron, and glances away as if holding back tears. One imagines she is grieving for the man beside her.&quot; Wood had been only 10 when his father died, and later he lived for a decade &quot;above a garage reserved for hearses&quot;, so death was probably on his mind.

In 2019, culture writer Kelly Grovier described the painting as a portrait of Pluto and Proserpina, the Roman gods of the underworld (a comparison made earlier by American writer Guy Davenport in his analysis of the painting in a 1978 lecture, &quot;The Geography of the Imagination&quot; .) Grovier suggests the small globe on the weather vane at the very top of the painting represents the dwarf planet Pluto (the planet was famously discovered in 1930 around the time of the painting&#x27;s creation). Grovier interprets the pitchfork-wielding farmer as the guardian of the gates of hell, Pluto, and points to the woman&#x27;s cameo brooch, containing a classical representation of the mythological goddess, Proserpina, and the dangling strand of hair by the woman&#x27;s right ear as representing the ravishing in the goddess&#x27;s myth. Davenport took the inspiration back even further, while seeing similarities to Northern Renaissance paintings of married couples, according to Davenport, &quot;American Gothic&quot; recalls, &quot;the Egyptian prince Rahotep, holding the flail of Osiris, beside his wife Nufrit—strict with pious rectitude, poised in absolute dignity, mediators between heaven and earth, givers of grain, obedient to the gods.&quot;

==Parodies and other cultural references==

The Depression-era understanding of the painting as depicting an authentically American scene prompted the first well-known parody, a 1942 photo by Gordon Parks taken in Washington, D.C. of cleaning woman Ella Watson.

&quot;American Gothic&quot; is a frequently parodied image. It has been lampooned in Broadway shows such as &quot;The Music Man&quot;, movies such as &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, and television shows such as &quot;Green Acres&quot; (in the final scene of the opening credits), &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; episode &quot;The Masterpiece&quot;, &quot;Pee-Wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; episode &quot;Miss Yvonne&#x27;s Visit,&quot; &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Bart Gets an Elephant&quot;, various &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; episodes, and the opening sequence of &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. It has also been parodied in marketing campaigns, pornography, and by couples who recreate the image photographically by facing a camera in the same way, one of them holding a pitchfork or other object in its place. The painting famously appears in the opening titles of the television show &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; (2004–2012).

In 2023, Google released a commercial for their smartphone depicting a father and daughter recreating the scene at the original house. It also includes similar poses in numerous other settings, including in wet suits, dressed as skeletons, camping and in ski suits.

A parody of the painting by illustrator Chris Riddell appeared in &quot;The Observer&quot; on 19 January 2025 depicting Elon Musk as the father and Donald Trump as the daughter wearing a MAGA broach, a distressed Statue of Liberty can be seen through the Gothic window.

<text>Jacques Jean Lhermitte () (20 January 1877 – 24 January 1959) was a French neurologist and neuropsychiatrist.

==Early life and education==
Lhermitte was born in Mont-Saint-Père, Aisne, son of Léon Augustin Lhermitte, a French realist painter. Following his early education at Saint-Etienne, he studied in Paris and graduated in medicine in 1907. He specialised in neurology and became &quot;Chef-de-clinique&quot; (resident) for nervous diseases in 1908, &quot;Chef de laboratoire&quot; in 1910, and &quot;professeur agrégé&quot; for psychiatry 1922. 

==Career==
Lhermitte became head of the Dejerine Foundation, sponsored by Joseph Jules Dejerine, and clinical director at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital.

During World War I, Lhermitte studied spinal injuries and became interested in neuropsychiatry. This led to publications on visual hallucinations of the self. A deeply religious man, he explored the common territory between theology and medicine, and this led him to interesting studies on demonic possession and stigmatisation.

== Medical eponyms ==
Lhermitte was a clinical neurologist. A number of medical eponyms bear his name:

* Lhermitte-Cornil-Quesnel syndrome: A slowly progressive pyramidopallidal degeneration
* Lhermitte-Duclos syndrome: A rare pathologic entity with hypertrophy chiefly of the stratum granulosum of the cerebellum
* Lhermitte-Lévy syndrome: A syndrome of slowly progressing paralysis after a stroke
* Lhermitte-McAlpine syndrome: A combined pyramidal and extrapyramidal tract syndrome in middle-aged and elderly persons.
* Lhermitte peduncular hallucinosis: Purely visual hallucinations recognized as unreal, abnormal phenomena (preserved insight).
* Lhermitte sign: Flexion of the neck in patients with multiple sclerosis produces electric shock-like sensations that extend down the spine and may shoot into the limbs
* Lhermitte syndrome: A rare syndrome of ocular palsy with nystagmus and paralysis of adduction during attempted lateral deviation of the eyes
* Lhermitte-Trelles syndrome&#x27; A syndrome characterized by lymphoblastic infiltration of the peripheral nervous system, associated with paralysis and amyotrophy

<text>The RPK (, English: &quot;Kalashnikov&#x27;s hand-held machine gun&quot;), sometimes inaccurately termed the RPK-47, is a Soviet 7.62×39mm light machine gun that was developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov in the early 1960s, in parallel with the AKM assault rifle. It was created to standardize the small arms inventory of the Soviet Army, where it replaced the 7.62×39mm RPD machine gun. The RPK continues to be used by the military of the post-Soviet states and several African and Asian nations. The RPK is also manufactured in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Serbia.

==Design details==
===Operating mechanism===
The RPK functions identically to the AK-47. It also uses the same 7.62×39mm ammunition. It has a similar design layout to the Kalashnikov series of rifles, with modifications to increase the RPK&#x27;s effective range and accuracy, enhance its sustained fire capability, and strengthen the receiver.

===Features===
The RPK features a thicker and longer barrel than the AKM. This allows for it to be fired for longer without permanent loss in accuracy due to the barrel heating up. The chrome-lined barrel is permanently fixed to the receiver and cannot be replaced in the field. It is fitted with a new front sight base, and the gas block lacks both a bayonet lug and an under-barrel cleaning rod guide. The barrel also features a folding bipod mounted near the muzzle, and a front sight base with a lug that limits the bipod&#x27;s rotation around the axis of the barrel. The barrel has a threaded muzzle, enabling the use of muzzle devices such as flash hiders, compensators, and blank-firing adapters. When a muzzle device is not being used, the threads on the muzzle can be covered by a thread protector. The barrel is pinned to the receiver in a modified trunnion, reinforced by ribbing, and is slightly wider than the trunnion used on the standard AKM type rifles. Symmetrical bulges on both sides of the front trunnion ensure a proper fit inside the receiver.

The U-shaped receiver is stamped from a smooth sheet of steel compared to the sheet metal receiver used on the standard AKM rifles. It uses a modified AKM recoil spring assembly that consists of a rear spring guide rod from the AK and a new forward flat guide rod and coil spring. It features a thick laminated wood foregrip and a fixed laminated wood &quot;club-foot&quot; buttstock similar to the stock used on the RPD, which is designed to allow the user to fire from the prone position more comfortably. It uses a standard AKM pistol grip and can also use standard AKM detachable box magazines, but it is most commonly used with a 40-round box magazine or a 75-round drum magazine. Interchangeability of parts between the RPK and AKM are moderate.

====Sights====
The weapon&#x27;s rear sight leaf is elevation adjustable, and graduated for ranges of 100 to 1,000 meters in 100 m increments. The rear sight leaf also features a windage adjustment knob unique to the RPK series of rifles.

====Accessories====
Supplied with the RPK are: spare magazines, a cleaning rod, cleaning kit (stored in a hollowed compartment in the buttstock), a sling, oil bottle, and magazine pouches (a single-pocket pouch for a drum magazine or a 4-pocket pouch for box magazines).

==Variants==
=== RPK ===
The RPK light machine gun chambered in 7.62×39mm cartridge, is essentially a Russian equivalent to a squad automatic weapon. It was adopted by the former Soviet Union, and was issued mainly to motorized units. It was later adopted by several military agencies around the world.

====RPKS====
The RPKS (&quot;S&quot; — Skladnoy (Russian: складной) means &quot;folding&quot; [stock]) is a variant of the RPK with a side-folding wooden stock was intended primarily for the paratroopers. Changes to the design of the RPKS are limited only to the shoulder stock mounting, at the rear of the receiver. It uses a trunnion riveted to both receiver walls that has a socket and tang, allowing the stock to hinge on a pivot pin. The trunnion has a cut-out on the right side which is designed to engage the stock catch and lock it in place when folded. The wooden stock is mounted in a pivoting hull, which contains a catch that secures the buttstock in the extended position. The rear sling loop was moved from the left side of the stock body to the right side of the stock frame.

===RPK-74===

The RPK-74 (РПК-74) was introduced in 1974 together with the AK-74 assault rifle and chambered for the new 5.45×39mm intermediate cartridge. It was derived from the AK-74 rifle, with modifications that mirror those made to the AKM to create the RPK.

The RPK-74 also uses a longer and heavier chrome-plated barrel, which has a new gas block with a gas channel at a 90° angle to the bore axis, and a ring for the cleaning rod. It is also equipped with a folding bipod and a different front sight tower. The muzzle is threaded for a flash suppressor or blank-firing device.

The rear stock trunnion was strengthened and the magazine well was reinforced with steel inserts.

Additionally, the RPK-74 has a modified return mechanism compared to the AK-74, which uses a new type of metal spring guide rod and recoil spring. The rear sight assembly, forward handguard and receiver dust cover were all retained from the RPK.

The RPK-74 feeds from a 45-round steel or polymer box magazine, interchangeable with magazines from the AK-74, and is designed to be charged from stripper clips. Drum magazines similar to those used on the previous RPK models were tested during its development phase, but were discontinued in favor of the 45-round box magazine. However, recently the production of a 97-round drum has started. This drum was designed to be used with the AK-107 but can also be used in any 5.45×39mm weapon with compatible magazines, such as the RPK-74 and RPK-74M. They were also testing with experimental conventional drums, a prototype 100-round belt fed drum magazine was also created. It attaches into the regular magazine well, but the cartridges are stored on a 100-round belt inside a box. A feed system removes them from the belt and puts them in a position where they can be loaded through the regular magazine well. This system is actuated by a lever from the magazine that clips around the charging handle. It is unknown if this ever went into service.

Standard equipment includes: eight magazines, six stripper clips (15 rounds per clip), a speedloader guide, cleaning rod, cleaning kit, sling, oil bottle and two magazine pouches. Some variants do not come with the cleaning kit option.

It is in widespread use by member states of the former Soviet Union, as well as Bulgaria.

====RPKS-74====
The RPKS-74 is the paratrooper variant of the RPK-74, equipped with a wooden folding stock from the RPKS.

====RPK-74M====
The RPK-74M (&quot;Modernizirovannij&quot; &quot;Modernized&quot;) is an updated variant of the RPK-74 developed during the mid-&#x27;90s. In line with the AK-74M assault rifle variant, the RPK-74M lower handguard, gas tube cover, pistol grip, and new synthetic stock are made from a black, glass-filled polyamide. The stock is shaped like the RPK-74 fixed stock, but also side-folds like the RPKS-74. The stock additionally has an easier to use release mechanism, replacing the bullet press release from the RPKS and RPKS-74. Each RPK-74M is fitted standard with a side-rail bracket for mounting optics. It also includes most of the 74M economic changes, such as the dimpled on barrel hardware, omission of lightening cuts from the front sight block and piston and stamped gas tube release lever. Updated magazines were produced by Molot with horizontal ribs going up the sides of the magazines.

===RPK-201 and RPK-203===
An export variant chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO was also introduced, designated as the RPK-201. A modernised export variant of the RPK was also developed, designated as the RPK-203. They both uses the same polymer construction as the RPK-74M.

===RPKN and RPK-74N===
The RPK family of light machine guns are also available in a night fighting configuration. These variants are designated as the RPKN, RPKSN, RPK-74N, and RPKS-74N. They have a side rail mounting on the left side of the receiver that accepts a NSP-3, NSPU, or NSPUM night vision sight. Models designated RPKN-1, RPKSN-1, RPK-74N and RPKS-74N can mount the multi-model night vision scope NSPU-3 (1PN51) while RPKN2, RPKSN2, RPK-74N2 and RPKS-74N2 can mount the multi-model night vision scope NSPUM (1PN58).

===RPK-16===
The RPK-16 light machine gun (the number 16 indicates the year 2016, when the development first started) is Kalashnikov&#x27;s response to the &quot;Tokar-2&quot; program, where it competed against Degtyaryov&#x27;s submission. In 2018, the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation have signed a contract concerning the procurement of the RPK-16, and is expected to take over the role of the RPK-74 in the Russian Armed Forces.

The RPK-16 is chambered in 5.45×39mm which features the traditional Kalashnikov gas-operated long-stroke piston system, and shares several novel technical and ergonomic features derived from the AK-12 program. Such as a Picatinny rail on the top of the receiver for mounting various optical sights and on the bottom of the handguard to mount the Picatinny rail mounted detachable bipod instead of the fixed bipod of the RPK-74, an ergonomic pistol grip and a folding buttstock, and two main barrel lengths; a long barrel (when it is applied or configured for the light machine gun role) and a short barrel (when it is applied or configured for the assault rifle role). Its design enables it to have an interchangeable barrels that can easily be removed, and the ability to quickly attach a detachable suppressor. It has a combat weight of , a full-length of , a cyclic rate of fire of 700 rounds per minute, an accuracy range of . It primarily uses a 95-round drum magazine and is backwards compatible with box magazines from the AK-74, AK-12 and RPK-74.

After receiving feedback on the performance of the weapon, the Kalashnikov Concern has begun development on the RPL-20 (20 indicating 2020) belt-fed light machine gun also chambered in 5.45×39mm and with a very similar rate of fire. Kalashnikov Concern has so far created at least one functional prototype. If adopted, the gun will become the first light machine gun to be used by Russian forces since the RPD that isn&#x27;t magazine-fed or of the standard Kalashnikov pattern.

==Molot Vepr==


A series of semi-automatic rifles and shotguns based on the heavy RPK receiver are manufactured by the Molot factory in Vyatskiye Polyany, Russia. These rifles are known as the Vepr (&quot;Vepr&quot; &gt; &quot;Wild Boar&quot;). They are offered in several chamberings, including: .223 Remington, 7.62×39mm, 5.45×39mm, 6.5mm Grendel, 7.62×54mmR, .308 Winchester, .30-06 Springfield and Vepr shotguns in 12 gauge, 20 gauge, and .410 bore.
The hallmark of Vepr rifles is their heavy RPK receiver and barrel. The barrel, gas block, and bore are chrome lined throughout.
They are intended for the civilian market, and are marketed as high quality hunting rifles. Due to this designation, they lack features seen on most AK type rifles. Vepr rifles do not include a bayonet lug, integrated cleaning rods or tool kits, can not accept standard AK magazines, and have wooden thumb-hole stocks. Some buy these rifles to &quot;convert&quot; into a traditional style AK rifle, installing new pistol-grip stocks and adding tactical accessories.

Early generations of the Vepr rifle were manufactured with slant-back receivers, making them incompatible with most AK furniture sets without a converter. The receivers were changed to straight-back in the second generation. Subsequent versions of the rifle reverted to slant-back.
Due to this rapid change between designs, it is not uncommon to find some second generation Vepr rifles with rough, incomplete stocks that have not been sanded or painted.

His cartoons typically presented progressive viewpoints. Similar to Oliphant&#x27;s use of his character Punk, Toles also tended to include a small doodle, usually a small caricature of himself at his desk, in the margin of his strip.

== Biography ==
Toles wrote for &quot;The Buffalo Courier-Express&quot;, &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. He left &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; in 2002, accepting an offer from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; to replace their cartoonist Herblock, and is under contract by Universal Press Syndicate. Part of his acceptance of his new job required him to give up his United Feature-distributed daily and Sunday cartoon panel &quot;Randolph Itch 2 AM&quot;, a cartoon based on Toles&#x27; thoughts while battling insomnia. Toles was replaced at the &quot;Buffalo News&quot; by Adam Zyglis. In addition to &quot;Randolph Itch 2 AM&quot;, Toles also created a daily and Sunday comic strip about small children called &quot;Curious Avenue&quot;. It ran 1992-1994 through his future editorial cartooning syndicate, Universal Press Syndicate. A collection of the strip was published in 1993 through the publisher Andrews McMeel Publishing.

Toles&#x27; cartoons appeared in more than 200 newspapers throughout the country. He received the National Cartoonist Society Editorial Cartoon Award for 2003 and the Herblock Prize for 2011.

In 2016, he co-authored with Michael E. Mann &quot;The Madhouse Effect&quot;, describing the global warming controversy.

On October 30, 2020, Toles retired from political cartooning after serving 18 years as a Washington Post political cartoonist. In his last political cartoon of his career, titled &quot;Tom Toles’s final cartoon&quot;, he advocated for voting against Donald Trump in the 2020 United States presidential election, warned about climate change and the disruptive power of artificial intelligence.

==Personal life==
Toles graduated magna cum laude from the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York. He married Gretchen Saarnijoki in 1973; together they have two children, Amanda and Seth.

In 2008, Toles began performing with the rock band Suspicious Package at venues around Washington, D.C. The band consists of Toles on drums, former HUD senior official Bryan Greene on guitar, Josh Meyer of the &quot;L.A. Times&quot; on lead guitar, Tim Burger of Bloomberg News on bass, and Office of the U.S. Trade Representative senior official Christina Sevilla on keyboard. The band debuted May 30, 2008 at The Red and the Black in Northeast D.C. Toles endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

==Pulitzer Prize==
Toles was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in editorial cartooning in 1990. He was one of two finalists for the prize in 1985, and was one of three finalists for the prize in 1996.

==Controversy==
A cartoon published January 29, 2006 attracted the ire of the Pentagon in the form of a protest letter signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. With regard to some recent assessments of the United States Army, the cartoon depicted the Army as a quadruple amputee soldier with a doctor resembling Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, declaring the Army &quot;battle hardened&quot;. The Joint Chiefs of Staff stated, &quot;Using the likeness of a service member who has lost his arms and legs in war as the central theme of a cartoon [is] beyond tasteless.&quot; Toles was quoted responding, &quot;I think it&#x27;s a little bit unfair in their reading of the cartoon to imply that is what it&#x27;s about.&quot; On February 7, 2006 Tom Tomorrow published a cartoon comparing the reactions to the Muhammad cartoons to the Tom Toles cartoons, alleging a double standard.

==Other appearances==
In March 2010, Toles appeared in the twelfth episode of &quot;The Real World: Washington, DC&quot;, in which cast member Andrew Woods, an aspiring cartoonist, met with him at &quot;The Washington Post&quot; to seek career advice.

<doc id="1192835" wikidata="Q4115300" url="?curid=1192835" title="Beany and Cecil">
<text>Beany and Cecil is an American animated television series created by Bob Clampett for the American Broadcasting Company. The cartoon was based on the television puppet show &quot;Time for Beany&quot;, which Clampett produced for Paramount Pictures company and its Paramount Television Network beginning 1949. The series was broadcast first as part of the series &quot;Matty&#x27;s Funnies&quot; during 1962, later renamed &quot;Beany and Cecil&quot;. A short-lived revival, &quot;The New Adventures of Beany and Cecil&quot;, was produced in 1988.

Although a children&#x27;s show, it incorporated satirical references to current events and personalities that adults found entertaining, and the show also attracted adult viewers. Some of the plots and remarks were recognizable as lampoons of current political issues.

Along with &quot;The Jetsons&quot; and &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, it was one of the first three color television series by the ABC television network (the initial season, though, was originally shown in black and white, as ABC was unable to broadcast color programs until September 1962).

==History==
&quot;Beany and Cecil&quot; was created by animator Bob Clampett after he quit Warner Bros., where he had been directing short cartoon movies. Clampett is said to have originated the idea for Cecil when he was a boy after seeing the top half of the dinosaur swimming from the water at the end of the 1925 movie &quot;The Lost World&quot;.

Clampett originally created the idea as a television series named &quot;Time for Beany&quot;, which was broadcast from February 28, 1949, to 1955. &quot;Time for Beany&quot;, a puppet show, featured the talents of veteran voice actors Stan Freberg as Cecil and Dishonest John, and Daws Butler as Beany and Uncle Captain.

Clampett revived the series in theatrical animated form, though Freberg and Butler did not reprise their roles. On 11 October 1959, the animated series was introduced as &quot;Matty&#x27;s Funday Funnies&quot;, named for &quot;Matty Mattel&quot; the animated spokesperson for its primary sponsor Mattel Toys company. However, the series at that time featured old Paramount theatrical cartoons. The new Beany and Cecil cartoon series took over Matty&#x27;s Funnies (sans &quot;Funday&quot;) in January 1962 and was broadcast prime time Saturdays during the remainder of the 1961-62 television season, by the ABC Television Network. The newer cartoons replaced the Famous Studios cartoons of &quot;Casper the Friendly Ghost&quot; and &quot;Little Audrey&quot; among other parts of &quot;Matty&#x27;s Funday Funnies&quot;. The program was later retitled &quot;The Beany and Cecil Show&quot;.
After 1962, the 26 shows (including 78 cartoons) were repeated during Saturday mornings for the next two years and on Sunday mornings for three more. The cartoon featured characters Beany, a boy, and Cecil the Sea-Sick Sea Serpent embarking on a series of adventures, often to discover ancient civilizations and artifacts. These escapades were rife with cartoon slapstick and puns.

Before the animated series, but concurrent with the puppet show, Clampett created a comic-book series of &quot;Beany and Cecil&quot; adventures for Dell Comics. The artwork for this series of comics, published from 1951 to 1954, was drawn by Jack Bradbury.

In 1988, the show was revived as &quot;The New Adventures of Beany and Cecil&quot; by DiC Entertainment. Only eight episodes were made, and only five episodes broadcast. This version of the show was produced and directed by John Kricfalusi, who would later create &quot;The Ren and Stimpy Show&quot;, and made use of voices from Billy West, who also did voices for the characters Ren (for season 3 and later) and Stimpy.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
* Beany Boy – a young, cupid-faced boy with a propeller beanie cap that allows him to fly (the &quot;Beanycopter&quot;, complete with helmet and propeller, became a popularly marketed novelty). Beany is a good-hearted lad. In most episodes, Beany would be kidnapped by a villain or get caught in a rough situation, crying &quot;Help, Cecil! Help!&quot; to which Cecil would reply &quot;I&#x27;m a-comin&#x27;, Beany-boy!&quot; as he raced to the rescue. This has become something of a catchphrase. Beany was originally voiced by Jim MacGeorge for the 1960s series and by Mark Hildreth for the 1980s series.

* Cecil (or &quot;Cecil the Seasick Sea Serpent&quot;) – a large green sea serpent with a slight lisp. He is fiercely loyal to Beany, but he is not very clever. Cecil&#x27;s trusting good nature invariably results in him being taken advantage of by the bad people, and he often suffers a great amount of physical abuse (getting smashed flat, losing his head, having his skin burned off, being shattered to pieces), examples of cartoon physics. The end of Cecil&#x27;s tail was never seen in most episodes; it always extended off-screen or was hidden behind an obstacle. This is likely a joking reference to the original Cecil, a hand puppet whose tail was likewise hidden (because it didn&#x27;t exist). His neck often showed folds and creases like that of a sock puppet as well, another reference to the original Cecil. Cecil&#x27;s tail did appear in &quot;Beany and the Jackstalk&quot; when his entire body became wound into the tension spring of a giant cuckoo clock. Cecil also has a superhero alter-ego known as Super-Cecil. In this guise, he wears a modified Superman shirt (complete with cape). It was Cecil who yodels &quot;A Bob Clam-pett car-tooooooo-OOOOOOOOON!&quot; at the end of the opening song of each episode. Cecil was voiced originally by Irv Shoemaker for the 1960s cartoon and by Billy West for the 1980s cartoon.
* Captain Horatio Huffenpuff – also called &quot;Uncle Captain&quot;, he is Beany&#x27;s kindly uncle and the captain of the ship &quot;Leakin&#x27; Lena&quot;, which takes the pals from one destination to the other. The Captain is always willing to instruct Beany and Cecil on their latest assignment, but is rather cowardly and refuses to put himself in any personal jeopardy, locking himself below the deck or under a box labeled &quot;Capt. Huffenpuff&#x27;s Hiding Box&quot; for most of the episodes. Uncle Captain was voiced by Jim MacGeorge for both series.
* Crowy – the navigator of the ship Leakin&#x27; Lena. He is a crow, and unsurprisingly spends most of his time in the ship&#x27;s crow&#x27;s nest. He speaks with a squawky voice and tends to faint whenever the ship encounters some sort of hazard. Crowy was voiced by Jim MacGeorge (though Don Messick did so in one episode).
* Dishonest John (or &quot;D.J.&quot;) – a mobster villain and the main antagonist of the show. He is dressed formally like a Simon Legree character, and he is constantly scheming to foil Beany and Cecil&#x27;s adventures. His catchphrase is his sinister laugh, &quot;Nya-ah-ãhh!&quot;, and he occasionally refers to Cecil as a &quot;tall toad&quot;, &quot;worm&quot; or &quot;big salami&quot; (referring to his big, limbless body). Whenever Dishonest John&#x27;s schemes are revealed to the heroes, Cecil tends to respond with an aghast &quot;What the heck! D.J., you dirty guy!&quot;. When Dishonest John receives his inevitable defeat, it is usually just as painful as the abuse Cecil has endured during the rest of the episode. Dishonest John also has a supervillain alter-ego known as The Bilious Beetle. In this guise, he can fly by his power and has a painful stinger. &quot;D.J.&quot; also appeared disguised on occasion as the mechanical robotic octopus &quot;Billy The Squid&quot; usually in haphazard attempts to simulate sea storms to scare away the crew of the Leakin&#x27; Lena when on a treasure hunt. Dishonest John carried a business card that read: &quot;Dirty deeds done dirt cheap. Special rates for Sundays and holidays&quot;. This was the inspiration for the AC/DC song &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot;. In the 1980s series, one episode revealed that DJ is a member of a club called the Brotherhood of B.L.E.C.H. (short for Bad Guys, Losers, Evildoers, Crooks, and Horrible People). DJ was originally voiced by Irv Shoemaker for the 1960s series and by Maurice LaMarche for the 1980s series.

===Minor characters===
* Cecilia McCoy - a she-serpent and Cecil&#x27;s girlfriend. In the two-episode arc, &quot;Beany Blows His Top&quot; &amp; &quot;Beany Flips His Lid&quot;, Dishonest John attempts to sabotage their relationship by disguising himself as another sea serpent named Rex.
* Davey Cricket – a cricket with a coonskin cap who lives in the backwoods of Eight-Nine-Tennessee. The character is a parody of Walt Disney&#x27;s wildly popular segments on the &quot;Disneyland&quot; television show based on the life of American frontiersman Davy Crockett. In Cricket&#x27;s self-titled episode, Dishonest John tries unsuccessfully to sign Davey to a lucrative Hollywood movie contract. He appeared in the episodes: &quot;Davey Cricket&quot; &amp; &quot;Davey Cricket&#x27;s Leading Ladybug&quot;.
* Go Man Van Gogh – a stereotypical cartoon beatnik/wild man who lives in the jungles of Wildsville on the Hungry I-Land. He often paints various things with his paintbrush, including paintings, vines to swing on, and fake backdrops to fool enemies (ala Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner). He also often plays a set of bongo drums, does scat singing, and speaks with various beatnik stereotype slang. Though he did not appear in many episodes, he was somewhat recurring. He was voiced originally by Lord Buckley in &quot;The Wildman of Wildsville&quot; (a 1959 short movie that was later broadcast as part of the television series) and then by Scatman Crothers after Buckley&#x27;s death in 1960.
* Harecules Hare - a rabbit with superior intelligence. Hare had a computerized Thinking Cap and built a &quot;Guided Muscle&quot;, a guided missile with a nose-cone in the form of a giant fist. His name could be a pun on &quot;Hercules&quot;. He appeared in the episodes &quot;Ben Hare&quot; and &quot;Harecules Hare and the Golden Fleecing&quot;.
* Ben Hare - a rabbit and father to Harecules. He was a muscular health nut who believed that brawn was more important than brains and wished that his son would feel the same way. His name could be a pun on &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. He appeared in the episodes &quot;Ben Hare&quot; and &quot;Harecules Hare and the Golden Fleecing&quot;.
* Jacques the Knife (or &quot;Jack the Knife&quot;) – a friendly, jazz-singing sawfish with a heavy French accent. His name was an obvious spoof of Bobby Darin&#x27;s 1959 hit song &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;. His sawlike nose is used as a sword to help Cecil defeat Dishonest John in the episode &quot;Hero by Trade&quot;. He spoke only in song, to a rendition of &quot;Oh My Darling, Clementine&quot; done in the styling Bobby Darin&#x27;s version of the song. He also comes to Cecil&#x27;s aid in the episode &quot;The Monstrous Monster&quot;.
* Little Ace From Outer Space – an astronaut mouse. In his self-titled episode, he was used by the people at Cape Banana Peel to discover &quot;whether or whether there was any weather&quot;. Cecil and Dishonest John competed to get Little Ace back to the cape for a cash reward. In the episode &quot;Rat Race From Space&quot;, he was sent in a rocket to be the first mouse on the moon only to end up in the ocean. He was voiced by Paul Frees.
* The Dreaded Three-Headed Threep
* Tear-A-Long the Dotted Lion – a muscle-bound lion obsessed with exercise and vitamins, a possible parody of fitness guru Jack La Lanne, who had a popular television exercise show about the same time as &quot;Beany and Cecil&quot;. His name is a pun of the phrase &quot;Tear along the dotted line&quot;, but Tear-A-Long himself wasn&#x27;t spotted. He spoke with a Southern U.S. accent similar to the Warner Brothers animated character Foghorn Leghorn. He was one of the original characters on the &quot;Time for Beany&quot; puppet show.
* Careless the Mexican Hairless – Cecil&#x27;s jovial pet Chihuahua, introduced in the episode &quot;Cecil Gets Careless&quot; and so named because of his tendency to knock things over when he happily jumps and dances. He sings to the tune of the Mexican folk song &quot;El Jarabe Tapatio&quot;. He is called a Mexican Hairless for comic effect; the actual breed aka Xoloitzcuintli is much larger.
* William Shakespeare Wolf – a starving out-of-work wolf and actor who was a foil for Rin Tin Can (a robot dog whose rise to fame coincided with the demise of his own acting career) as well as Harecules Hare and a duck named Graham Quacker, both of whom he attempted to eat.
* Beepin&#x27; Tom – a diminutive alien who flew about in an open-top flying saucer. He is named for his habit of making beeping sounds. When he spoke, he would hum the first line of &quot;The Alphabet Song&quot; and then sing his phrase to the tune of the next line. A high pitched, accelerated voice similar to the Chipmunks was used for the character and the words he sang/spoke appeared as a rebus in a word balloon over his head. He appeared in the episodes &quot;Ain&#x27;t I a Little Stinger?&quot; and &quot;Strange Objects&quot;.
* Hopalong Catskill – a frog wearing a cowboy hat who walked with a limp similar to that of Dennis Weaver&#x27;s &quot;Chester&quot; on the TV show &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and spoke with a Yiddish accent. His catchphrase was &quot;Hey Shmendrick! Would you like a cup of coffee?&quot; The character was voiced by Yiddish comedy singer Mickey Katz.
* Peking Tom – a Siamese alley cat who sang about being a &quot;very hungry guy; I&#x27;ve got to get some food &#x27;cause I&#x27;m too egg-foo-young to die&quot;.
* Cora the Clinging Vine (aka Flora) – a voluptuous vine who has a crush on Cecil (who does not reciprocate her advances). She sings &quot;groovy&quot; and Jazz scats to Cecil as he tries to escape from her. She appeared in the episodes &quot;Wildman From Wildsville&quot; and &quot;Capture of the Three-Headed Threep&quot;.
* Venus the Meanest and Venice the Menace – two space robots from Venus who at first were reported to be invading Earth but came down for a picnic. Venice the Menace&#x27;s name is a play on Dennis the Menace (both the British and American versions), and acts like Linus Van Pelt from Peanuts including his thumb sucking and &quot;dirty old&quot; blanket. Venus the Meanest was voiced by Arlene Harris, using her Chatterbox bit, where she speaks on the phone with an unseen Maisey about her troubles with Venice&#x27;s mother.
* The Robot Ants – a group of ants brought by Venus the Meanest to be part of her picnic on Earth. They sing a march based on the children&#x27;s song &quot;This Old Man&quot; that is shown in a speech bubble.
* The Boo Birds – a gang of mischievous ghost birds that haunt an abandoned castle where Cecil stayed. They sing a tune &quot;Filet of Soul (Sole)&quot; based on the song &quot;When the Saints Come Marching In&quot;. Their catchphrase was &quot;Whyyyy not?&quot;
* Edgar Allen Po&#x27;s Shadow – a shadow man who owns the Haunted Retreat Mansion in the episode &quot;Beany and Cecil meets the Invisible Man&quot;. He is based on Alfred Hitchcock and speaks with an accent like that of the cartoon character Elmer Fudd.
* So What and the Seven What-Knots – a dixie jazz band who performed in a jazz club in Las Vegas, Nevada to the tune of &quot;When the Saints Come Marching In&quot;. They are based on the fairy tale, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. The names of the &#x27;What-Knots&#x27; all spoofed on musicians &amp; actors of the day, such as $tash-do (Satchmo), Elfis (Elvis Presley), Dizzy R. Nez (Desi Arnaz), Harpsie McChord (Harpo Marx), Fred McFurry (Fred MacMurray), Screw-Loose Lautrec (Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec) &amp; Loverachi (Liberace).
* Stogie Bear – a detective bear who Beany and Cecil helped to arrest the gangster bears in the episode, &quot;The Warring 20&#x27;s&quot;.
* Double Trouble Bubble Beast – a weird underwater creature who appeared in &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Cork in the Snorkel&quot; and &quot;Make a Sea-Serpent Sore!&quot;
* Dinah Saur, The Singing Dinosaur - a dinosaur named and patterned after Dinah Shore who lived on the island of No Bikini Atoll &amp; sang to the tune of &quot;When the Saints Come Marching In&quot;. 
* Gigi - a French poodle. Featured in the episode &quot;DJ The DJ&quot;, she repeatedly thought she was being summoned by Cecil each time he would utter the &quot;R-A-G-G&quot; portion of the song &quot;Rag Mop&quot;.
* Baby Ruthy - Beany&#x27;s girlfriend, appears in &quot;Beany Blows His Top&quot; &amp; &quot;Beany Flips His Lid&quot;. As he leaves to meet her, Huffenpuff tells him &quot;You dine ashore...&quot; (yet another Dinah Shore reference).
* Bridget the Crow - Crowy&#x27;s girlfriend, she appears in &quot;Beany Blows His Top&quot;.
* U.S. Male - a postal ship, boyfriend of the Leakin&#x27; Lena, appears in &quot;Beany Blows His Top&quot;.
* Ida - Sweet as apple cider. Huffenpuff&#x27;s girlfriend, she appears in just one episode, but is referenced in others.
* The Fleastone Kops - they assisted Detective Fido Vance when The Pincher kidnapped actress Bridgette Bow Wow.
* Snorky - a mischievous serpent tied to many dubious historical events.

==Music==
Cecil often sang the Ames Brothers&#x27; song &quot;Rag Mop&quot; throughout the series. One episode (&quot;Beanyland&quot;) featured Tchaikovsky&#x27;s well-known celesta piece, &quot;Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy&quot;, from &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;. Other famed pieces of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; were used in the series as musical interludes such as the &quot;Chinese Dance&quot; and &quot;Dance of the Reed-Flutes&quot;. Many other well-known classical music pieces were featured in the show as well, including &quot;The William Tell Overture&quot; (in the episodes &quot;Beanyland&quot; and &quot;The Phantom of the Horse Opera&quot;), &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot; and &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot;. Some of the background music was also recycled from &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, as well as some early Walter Lantz cartoons and incidental music from &quot;The Alvin Show&quot;. &quot;The Can Can&quot; was used in the episode &quot;Harecules Hare &amp; The Golden Fleecing&quot; as the music for the Guided Muscle. The tune of &quot;When The Saints Come Marching In&quot; was used in several episodes, by the Singing Dinosaur, So What &amp; The Seven What-Knots &amp; the Boo Birds.

==Influence==
The AC/DC song &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot; is titled after the business cards of character Dishonest John, which read &quot;Dirty deeds done dirt cheap. Holidays, Sundays and special rates&quot;.

Bob Dylan painted Beany in his 2017 Beaten Path painting &quot;Hamburger Stand, Long Beach&quot;, based on a home movie of Beany&#x27;s Drive-in Restaurant in 1952.

Marvel Comics has a minor character code-named Warstar who is two separate aliens named &quot;B&#x27;nee&quot; and &quot;C&#x27;cil&quot;.

The puppet origins and the form of Cecil inspired the famous science fiction author Larry Niven to invent an important extraterrestrial race called Pierson&#x27;s Puppeteer as part of his Known Space series of novels and short stories (as originally stated in the story &quot;The Soft Weapon&quot;. &quot;Beany and Cecil&quot; was also an inspiration for Joel Hodgson to create the show &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

The credits of the series did not show traditional job titles, but pictorial symbols indicating their jobs. Bob Clampett&#x27;s writing credit was indicated by a typewriter typing out the words &quot;...by Bob Clampett&quot;, for instance. Clampett also made sure to include his name in the lyrics of the often-repeated B&amp;C theme song to gain more recognition with viewers and from the animation industry. Clampett finally got the rights from ABC to market his Beany and Cecil cartoons by video during the 1980s.

<text>Garson Kanin (November 24, 1912 – March 13, 1999) was an American writer and director of plays and films.

== Early life ==
Garson Kanin was born in Rochester, New York; his Jewish family later relocated to Detroit then to New York City. He attended James Madison High School in Brooklyn, dropping out to take up a career on the theatre stage. He subsequently became a professional saxophone player and leader of his own band that went by the name Garson Kanin and His Red Hot Peppers. During this period, he attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts pursuing an acting career. 

==Career==
===Stage===
Garson Kanin began his show-business career as a jazz musician, burlesque comedian, and actor. He graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City and made his Broadway debut in &quot;Little Ol&#x27; Boy&quot; (1933). In 1935, Kanin was cast in a George Abbott play and soon became Abbott&#x27;s assistant. Kanin made his Broadway debut as a director in 1936, at the age of 24, with &quot;Hitch Your Wagon&quot;.

In 1945, Kanin directed Spencer Tracy in Tracy&#x27;s first play in 15 years. Tracy had been through a dark patch personally, culminating with a stay in hospital, and Katharine Hepburn felt that a play would help restore his focus. Tracy told a journalist in April, &quot;I&#x27;m coming back to Broadway to see if I can still act.&quot; The play was &quot;The Rugged Path&quot; by Robert E. Sherwood, which first previewed in Providence, Rhode Island, on September 28, to a sold-out crowd and tepid response.

&quot;The Rugged Path&quot; was a difficult production, with Kanin later writing, &quot;In the ten days prior to the New York opening, all the important relationships had deteriorated. Spencer was tense and unbending, could not, or would not, take direction&quot;. Tracy considered leaving the show before it even opened on Broadway, and lasted there just six weeks before announcing his intention to close the show. It closed on January 19, 1946, after 81 performances. Tracy later explained to a friend: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t say those goddamn lines over and over and over again every night ... At least every day is a new day for me in films ... But this thing—every day, every day, over and over again.&quot;

Kanin&#x27;s 1946 play &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;, which he also directed, ran for 1,642 performances. After the draft turned in by the credited screenwriter, Albert Mannheimer proved unworkable an uncredited Kanin was brought in by Harry Cohn to adapt his play into the script used to shoot the 1950 film adaptation.
His other stage work includes directing &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1955), which ran for 717 performances, and the musical &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (1964), which ran for 1,348 performances. Kanin wrote and directed his last play, &quot;Peccadillo&quot;, in 1985, the same year he was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

===Film===
His first film as a director was &quot;A Man to Remember&quot; (1938), which &quot;The New York Times&quot; considered one of the 10 best films of 1938. Kanin was 26 at the time. His other directing credits include &quot;Bachelor Mother&quot; (1939), &quot;The Great Man Votes&quot; (1939), &quot;My Favorite Wife&quot; (1940), &quot;They Knew What They Wanted&quot; (1940), and &quot;Tom, Dick, and Harry&quot; (1941).

Kanin&#x27;s Hollywood career was interrupted by the draft. He served in the United States Army from 1941 to 1945. During this time, Kanin and Carol Reed co-directed General Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s official record of the Allied invasion, the Academy Award-winning documentary &quot;The True Glory&quot; (1945). During this time, he began writing what would become regarded by many as his greatest play, &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;.

Kanin&#x27;s best-remembered screenplays, however, were written in collaboration with his wife, actress Ruth Gordon, whom he married in 1942. Together, they wrote many screenplays, including six that were directed by George Cukor. These included the Spencer Tracy - Katharine Hepburn film comedies &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot; (1949) and &quot;Pat and Mike&quot; (1952), as well as &quot;A Double Life&quot; (1947), starring Ronald Colman.

===Television===
In the 1950s through the 1980s, Kanin adapted several of his stories and plays for television, most notably &quot;Mr. Broadway&quot; (1964), and &quot;Moviola&quot; (1980).

Kanin&#x27;s best-selling novel &quot;Smash&quot; (1980), about the pre-Broadway tryout of a musical comedy, was inspired by his experience directing the 1964 musical &quot;Funny Girl&quot; and was adapted into the 2012 television series &quot;Smash&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kanin was married to his frequent collaborator, Academy Award-winning actress Ruth Gordon from 1942 to her death in 1985. In 1990, he married stage actress Marian Seldes. Kanin died in 1999, age 86, of undisclosed causes.

===Acquaintances and memorable sayings===
He was a colleague of Thornton Wilder, who mentored him, and an admirer of the work of Frank Capra. Kanin said, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be Capra than God, if there is a Capra.&quot; Kanin and Katharine Hepburn were the only witnesses to Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh&#x27;s wedding in California on August 31, 1940. In 1941, Hepburn and he worked with his brother Michael Kanin and Ring Lardner, Jr., on the early drafts of what became &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; right before Garson enlisted in the army. He is also quoted as saying, &quot;When your work speaks for itself, don&#x27;t interrupt.&quot;

His most famous quote, from his hit play &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;, is on a New York City Public Library plaque on a 41st Street sidewalk: &quot;I want everyone to be smart. As smart as they can be. A world of ignorant people is too dangerous to live in.&quot;

<doc id="1192840" wikidata="Q5354953" url="?curid=1192840" title="Electoral-vote.com">
<text>Electoral-vote.com is a website created by computer scientist Andrew S. Tanenbaum. The site&#x27;s primary content was originally poll analysis to project election outcomes. Since the 2016 elections, the site also has featured daily commentary on political news stories.

The site was created during the lead-up to the 2004 U.S. Presidential election to predict the winner. The site tries to improve on national polls usually reported in the media, by instead analyzing the most recent polls on the state level, thus simulating the process by which Electoral College votes are determined in the actual election. Updated throughout the campaign, visitors can see who is &quot;ahead&quot; at any time.

On weekends the site focuses more on interacting with readers, with Tanenbaum and co-author Christopher Bates answering reader questions on Saturdays and posting a mailbag of reader letters on Sundays.

Political commentators, such as Chris Weigant, have noted the helpfulness of the website in aggregating polls state by state in order to predict the outcomes of elections. 

== Staff ==
The content is produced by Andrew Tanenbaum and Christopher Bates. Tanenbaum is a member of Democrats Abroad (he is a long-time resident of the Netherlands) and generally supports Democratic candidates for office. For the first few months of the websites existence Tanenbaum went by the alias &quot;the Votemaster&quot;, keeping his identity a secret. He revealed his identity on November 1, 2004, as well as stating his reasons and qualifications for running the website. 

In 2015, Tanenbaum was joined by Christopher Bates, who contributes to the site under the name Zenger, chosen in honor of John Peter Zenger. Their respective contributions are differentiated by (V) and (Z). In December 2024, they were joined by Alison Regan, who contributes under the name Lockwood, or (L), in honor of Belva Ann Bennett Lockwood.

== History ==

=== 2004 Presidential election ===
The site began operating on May 24, 2004 with a simple map and a few links to other pages. During the months leading up to the 2004 U.S. Presidential election, the site was updated daily to reflect new state polls. The site was the most popular election site in the country, in the top 1,000 Web sites in the world, and in the top 10 blogs in the world. In November 2004, the website had more than 650,000 hits per day.

The main page consisted of a map of the United States with the individual states colored varying shades of red or blue, based on the polls for that state. For instance, Illinois, a state that was polling strongly for Democrat John Kerry was colored dark blue, whereas Michigan where Kerry&#x27;s lead polled by a small margin was colored light blue. Analogously, Texas was dark red during the whole campaign, indicating Bush&#x27;s strong lead there. All of the polling data were provided in multiple formats, including HTML, Excel, and .csv for downloading. Other features included historical data on previous elections, charts and animations showing the polls over the course of time, cartograms, and links to hundreds of other pages and external Websites with tables, charts, graphs, and other election data and information.

The main algorithm just used the most recent poll(s) in every state. If two polls came out on the same day, they were averaged. This algorithm used all published polls, including those by partisan pollsters such as Strategic Vision (R) and Hart Research (D). A second algorithm used only nonpartisan polls and averaged all polls during the past three days. A third algorithm used historical data to predict how undecided voters would break. Maps for each of the algorithms were given every day, but the first one got most of the publicity since it was on the main page.

The site&#x27;s final tracking using algorithm 1 posted on Election Day, November 2 gave 262 electoral votes to John Kerry and 261 to George W. Bush, with 15 tossups. The second algorithm (averaging 3 days worth of nonpartisan polls) gave Kerry 245 and Bush 278 with 15 tossups. The third algorithm (predicting the undecideds) predicted 281 for Kerry and 257 for Bush.

The actual vote gave Kerry 252 to Bush&#x27;s 286.

=== 2006 Senate and House elections ===
On September 6, 2006, the site began tracking the 2006 Congressional elections in the Senate. Shortly thereafter, the House of Representatives was added. The map on the site&#x27;s front page displayed polling for the 2006 Senate races. For House races, the site featured a &quot;Hot House Races&quot; page with links to Wikipedia articles on the candidates, links to the candidates&#x27; official websites, and notes on the races. The relatively small number of House election polls as well as 2004&#x27;s House vote totals were used to project the makeup of the House on the site&#x27;s front page. The site correctly predicted the winners in all 33 Senate races.

=== 2008 Presidential, Senate, and House elections ===
In late December 2006, the site began its 2008 coverage, which included the presidential race, all 33 Senate races, and about 40 House races that had been close in 2006 and were expected to be highly contested in 2008. For each of the known presidential, senatorial and House candidates, a photo was given, linked to the candidate&#x27;s Wikipedia entry, along with a brief description of the candidate and race. The site also had four new maps: one showing the 2004 presidential election, one showing the governors by state, one showing the senate by state and finally one showing the House delegations by state. Polling data was presented daily beginning in December 2007 with data from the primaries.

Polling data was presented daily on the likely outcome of the primaries as well as upcoming trends.

The site&#x27;s electoral vote prediction for the 2008 election was very close to the actual outcome, correctly projecting the winner of every state except for Indiana, and showing Missouri (won by John McCain by only 0.13% of the vote) as a pure tossup. The Senate projection was also close to the actual outcome, predicting 34 of the 35 decided states correctly, including correctly showing a Democratic pickup in Alaska and incorrectly showing the Republican Senator Norm Coleman holding his seat in Minnesota. The Senate results of the Minnesota election was so close that it was contested until the state supreme court ruled in favor of Al Franken on June 30, 2009.

=== 2010 Senate and House elections ===
In 2010 the site projected 51 seats held by Democrats, 48 by Republicans, and 1 by Lisa Murkowski (a Republican running a write-in campaign). It was incorrect about Colorado and Nevada, which instead went to Democrats. It projected 202 House seats held by Democrats, 216 seats held by Republicans, with 17 too close to call. The actual outcome was 195 Democrats and 240 Republicans.

===2012 Presidential and Senate elections===
In 2012 the site projected the electoral votes for Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, and the Senate. Its final analysis predicted 303 electoral votes for Obama, and 220 for Romney, with 15 votes (North Carolina&#x27;s) too close to call. The actual outcome was 332 to 206; North Carolina went to Romney, but Florida instead went to Obama. Its final projection for the Senate was 51 seats held by Democrats, 45 by Republicans, 1 by independent Angus King (an ally of the Democrats), and 3 too close to call (Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota); Montana and North Dakota elected Democrats.

===2014 Senate elections===
In 2014 the site projected 47 Senate seats held by Democrats, 52 by Republicans, and 1 too close to call (Kansas). The actual outcome was 46 Democrats and 54 Republicans, with Kansas and North Carolina instead going to Republicans.

===2016 Presidential election ===
Tanenbaum resumed updating the site in 2015 with daily commentary on the presidential candidates, joined in September by UCLA-trained historian Christopher Bates. During the primaries, the site tracked the leading candidates&#x27; expected delegate counts, and progress toward nomination. After the primaries, it began projections based on the polling to date. The site projected that Hillary Clinton would receive 317 electoral votes, and Donald Trump would receive 215, compared to the actual &quot;upset&quot; result: 232 for Clinton and 306 for Trump. Following the election, Tanenbaum and Bates updated the site with daily links to news items and commentary about them. Years later, they noted that Trump&#x27;s victory was the most shocking upset in their experience following politics.

=== 2018 Senate elections ===
In early September 2018 the site began tracking polling information for Senate races. The site projected 48 Senate seats held by Democrats, 50 by Republicans, and 2 too close to call (Arizona and Missouri). The actual outcome was 47 Democrats and 53 Republicans, with Florida and Indiana instead going to Republicans.

===2020 Presidential and Senate elections===
In 2020 the site projected the electoral votes for Joe Biden and Donald Trump, and the Senate. Its final analysis predicted 350 electoral votes for Biden, and 170 for Trump, with 18 votes (Ohio&#x27;s) too close to call. Bates predicted that Trump would carry Ohio but Biden would receive one of Nebraska&#x27;s votes for a final tally of 351-187; Tanenbaum was more cautious about predicting the outcome in toss-up states but did predict a Biden victory. The actual outcome was 306 to 232; North Carolina and Florida both went to Trump rather than Biden along with one of Maine&#x27;s votes. 

The website&#x27;s final projection for the Senate was 54 seats held by Democrats, 46 by Republicans. The actual outcome was a 50-50 senate because 4 states (Montana, Iowa, North Carolina, and Maine) elected Republicans rather than Democrats.

=== 2022 Senate elections===
On the morning of election day 2022, the site predicted 49 Senate seats held by Democrats and 50 by Republicans, with one, Georgia, too close to call. The site&#x27;s predictions were correct except for Nevada, which went instead to the Democrats. A month later, Georgia held a runoff election, and the Democrats won this seat too, giving a final total of 51 Democrats (including independents who caucus with them) and 49 Republicans.

===2024 Presidential and Senate elections===
In the presidential election of 2024, the site predicted the electoral votes of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The final prediction on the morning of Election Day showed Harris winning the swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nevada, and Trump winning the swing states of North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona, giving a total of 276 electoral votes for Harris and 262 for Trump. Tanenbaum affirmed these predictions, while Bates predicted that Harris would win North Carolina but Trump would win Nevada, a 286-252 margin for Harris. In the election, Trump won all the swing states, giving him 312 electoral votes to Harris&#x27; 226. Tanenbaum&#x27;s observation that &quot;most of the swing states go the same way&quot; proved to be correct.

In the Senate, the site predicted that the Republicans would win easily in West Virginia and narrowly in Montana and Ohio, giving them 52 seats in the next Congress, while the Democrats would hold their other vulnerable seats but not gain any. They got all the states right except Pennsylvania, where David McCormick narrowly defeated incumbent Bob Casey Jr., giving the Republicans 53 seats.

<text>The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (or IRB; , CISR), established in 1989 by an Act of Parliament, is an independent administrative tribunal that is responsible for making decisions on immigration and refugee matters. As one of their responsibilities, the IRB decides on applications for refugee protection made by individuals. The IRB reports to Parliament through the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship (IRCC), but remains independent from both the IRCC and the Minister.

== Governance ==

=== Governing documents ===

Matters concerning the IRB are governed under the &quot;Immigration and Refugee Protection Act&quot; (&quot;IRPA&quot;). In addition, IRB follows Canada&#x27;s &quot;Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations&quot;, the &quot;Immigration Division Rules&quot;, the &quot;Immigration Appeals Division Rules&quot;, and the &quot;Refugee Protection Division Rules&quot;.

=== Chairperson ===
The chairperson of the IRB is Manon Brassard, who was appointed to the position 23 July 2023. Past chairs include:

* Richard Wex (2018-2023)
* Mario Dion (2013–2018)
* Brian Goodman (2007–2013)
* Jean-Guy Fleury (2002–2007)
* Peter Showler (1999–2002)
* Nurjehan Mawani (1992–1999)
* Gordon Fairweather (1989–1992)

==Divisions of the board==

The IRB consists of four divisions:

# Immigration
# Immigration Appeals
# Refugee Protection
# Refugee Appeals.

=== Immigration and Immigration Appeals Divisions ===

The Immigration Division (ID) consists of two main functions: to conduct admissibility hearings and to conduct detention reviews. If the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) believes an individual has not followed or contravenes IRPA, they will ask the IRB to conduct an admissibility hearing—which will determine if the individual remain or enter Canada. If an individual is detained or held for immigration purposes, the Immigration Division will conduct detention reviews, which are done within certain time frames, set forth by IRPA. A member of the Division, or of the CBSA, will determine if an individual shall be released from detention.

The Immigration Appeals Division (IAD) hears appeals of immigration matters. These immigration matters are related to: sponsorships, removal orders, residency obligations or appeals made by (on behalf of) the Minister.

=== Refugee Protection and Refugee Appeals Divisions ===

The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) makes determinations for individuals in Canada seeking protection. For individuals residing outside of Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) makes the decision.

The Refugee Appeals Division (RAD) hears appeals of refugee matters, in accordance to the conventions of the United Nations that Canada is a signatory of:

* &quot;Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees&quot; (1951)
* &quot;Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees&quot; (1967)
* &quot;Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment&quot; (1984)

A claim for refugee protection can be made inland (IRCC or CBSA office) or at a port of entry (airport, border crossing). The IRB will grant protection to an individual who is a convention refugee or a person in need of protection. A convention refugee is an individual who has a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.

====Eligibility====
A claim is not eligible if an individual
# has already been granted refugee protection in Canada or another country;
# has previously been refused refugee protection in Canada;
# has previously made a claim in a country that has an information sharing agreement with Canada for the purposes of administering it&#x27;s immigration and citizenship laws;
# has come to Canada from/through a designated safe third country in which a claim for protection was sought; 
#has committed a crime against peace, war crime or crime against humanity, a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge, or acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.

<doc id="1192866" wikidata="Q419793" url="?curid=1192866" title="Accommodation (vertebrate eye)">
<text>Accommodation is the process by which the vertebrate eye changes optical power to maintain a clear image or focus on an object as its distance varies. In this, distances vary for individuals from the far point—the maximum distance from the eye for which a clear image of an object can be seen, to the near point—the minimum distance for a clear image.
Accommodation usually acts like a reflex, including part of the accommodation-convergence reflex, but it can also be consciously controlled.

The main ways animals may change focus are:
* Changing the shape of the lens.
* Changing the position of the lens relative to the retina.
* Changing the axial length of the eyeball.
* Changing the shape of the cornea.

==Focusing mechanisms==
 Focusing the light scattered by objects in a three dimensional environment into a two dimensional collection of individual bright points of light requires the light to be bent. To get a good image of these points of light on a defined area requires a precise systematic bending of light called refraction. The real image formed from millions of these points of light is what animals see using their retinas. Very even systematic curvature of parts of the cornea and lens produces this systematic bending of light onto the retina. Due to the nature of optics the focused image on the retina is always inverted relative to the object.

Different animals live in different environments having different refractive indexes involving water, air and often both. The eyes are therefor required to bend light different amounts leading to different mechanisms of focus being used in different environments. The air/cornea interface involves a larger difference in refractive index than hydrated structures within the eye. As a result, animals living in air have most of the bending of light achieved at the air/cornea interface with the lens being involved in finer focus of the image. Generally mammals, birds and reptiles living in air vary their eyes&#x27; optical power by subtly and precisely changing the shape of the elastic lens using the ciliary body.

The small difference in refractive index between water and the hydrated cornea means fish and amphibians need to bend the light more using the internal structures of the eye. Therefore, eyes evolved in water have a mechanism involving changing the distance between a rigid rounder more refractive lens and the retina using less uniform muscles rather than subtly changing the shape of the lens itself using circularly arranged muscles.

===Land based animals and the shape changing lens===
Varying forms of direct experimental proof outlined in this article show that most non-aquatic vertebrates achieve focus, at least in part, by changing the shapes of their lenses.

What is less well understood is how the subtle, precise and very quick changes in lens shape are made. Direct experimental proof of any lens model is necessarily difficult as the vertebrate lens is transparent and only functions well in the living animals. When considering vertebrates, aspects of all models may play varying roles in lens focus. The models can be broadly divided into two camps. Those models that stress the importance of external forces acting on a more passively elastic lens and other models that include forces that may be generated by the lens internally.

==== External forces ====
The model of a shape changing lens of humans was proposed by Thomas Young in a lecture on the 27th Nov 1800. Others such as Hermann von Helmholtz and Thomas Henry Huxley refined the model in the mid-1800s explaining how the ciliary muscle contracts rounding the lens to focus near. The model may be summarized like this. Normally the lens is held under tension by its suspending ligaments and capsule being pulled tight by the pressure of the eyeball. At short focal distance the ciliary muscle contracts, stretching the ciliary body and relieving some of the tension on the suspensory ligaments, allowing the elastic lens to become more spherical, increasing refractive power. Changing focus to an object at a greater distance requires a thinner less curved lens. This is achieved by relaxing some of the sphincter-like ciliary muscles allowing the ciliarly body to spring back, pulling harder on the lens making it less curved and thinner, so increasing the focal distance. There is a problem with the Helmholtz model in that despite mathematical models being tried none has come close enough to working using only the Helmholtz mechanisms.
In 1992, Ronald Schachar proposed a model for land based vertebrates that was not well received. The theory allows mathematical modeling to more accurately reflect the way the lens focuses while also taking into account the complexities in the suspensory ligaments and the presence of radial as well as circular muscles in the ciliary body. In this model the ligaments may pull to varying degrees on the lens at the equator using the radial muscles, while the ligaments offset from the equator to the front and back are relaxed to varying degrees by contracting the circular muscles. These multiple actions operating on the elastic lens allows it to change lens shape at the front more subtly. Not only changing focus, but also correcting for lens aberrations that might otherwise result from the changing shape while better fitting mathematical modeling.

The &quot;catenary&quot; model of lens focus proposed by Coleman demands less tension on the ligaments suspending the lens. Rather than the lens as a whole being stretched thinner for distance vision and allowed to relax for near focus, contraction of the circular ciliary muscles results in the lens having less hydrostatic pressure against its front. The lens front can then reform its shape between the suspensory ligaments in a similar way to a slack chain hanging between two poles might change its curve when the poles are moved closer together. This model requires precise fluid movement of the lens front only rather than trying to change the shape of the lens as a whole. While this concept may be involved in the focusing it has been shown by Scheimpflug photography that the rear of the lens also changes shape in the living eye.

==== Internal forces ====
 When Thomas Young proposed the changing of the human lens&#x27;s shape as the mechanism for focal accommodation in 1801 he thought the lens may be a muscle capable of contraction. This type of model is termed intracapsular accommodation as it relies on activity within the lens. In a 1911 Nobel lecture Allvar Gullstrand spoke on &quot;How I found the intracapsular mechanism of accommodation&quot; and this aspect of lens focusing continues to be investigated. Young spent time searching for the nerves that could stimulate the lens to contract without success. Since that time it has become clear the lens is not a simple muscle stimulated by a nerve so the 1909 Helmholtz model took precedence. Pre-twentieth century investigators did not have the benefit of many later discoveries and techniques. Membrane proteins such as aquaporins which allow water to flow into and out of cells are the most abundant membrane protein in the lens. Connexins which allow electrical coupling of cells are also prevalent. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescent microscopy show fiber cells to be highly variable in structure and composition. Magnetic resonance imaging confirms a layering in the lens that may allow for different refractive plans within it. The refractive index of human lens varies from approximately 1.406 in the central layers down to 1.386 in less dense layers of the lens. This index gradient enhances the optical power of the lens. As more is learned about mammalian lens structure from &quot;in situ&quot; Scheimpflug photography, MRI and physiological investigations it is becoming apparent the lens itself is not responding entirely passively to the surrounding ciliary muscle but may be able to change its overall refractive index through mechanisms involving water dynamics in the lens still to be clarified. The accompanying micrograph shows wrinkled fibers from a relaxed sheep lens after it is removed from the animal indicating shortening of the lens fibers during near focus accommodation. The age related changes in the human lens may also be related to changes in the water dynamics in the lens.

====Human eyes====

 The young human eye can change focus from distance (infinity) to as near as 6.5 cm from the eye. This dramatic change in focal power of the eye of approximately 15 dioptres (the reciprocal of focal length in metres) occurs as a consequence of a reduction in zonular tension induced by ciliary muscle contraction. This process can occur in as little as 224 ± 30 milliseconds in bright light. The amplitude of accommodation declines with age. By the fifth decade of life the accommodative amplitude can decline so that the near point of the eye is more remote than the reading distance. When this occurs the patient is presbyopic. Once presbyopia occurs, those who are emmetropic (i.e., do not require optical correction for distance vision) will need an optical aid for near vision; those who are myopic (nearsighted and require an optical correction for distance or far vision), will find that they see better at near without their distance correction; and those who are hyperopic (farsighted) will find that they may need a correction for both distance and near vision. Note that these effects are most noticeable when the pupil is large; i.e. in dim light. The age-related decline in accommodation occurs almost universally to less than 2 dioptres by the time a person reaches 45 to 50 years, by which time most of the population will have noticed a decrease in their ability to focus on close objects and hence require glasses for reading or bifocal lenses. Accommodation decreases to about 1 dioptre at the age of 70 years. The dependency of accommodation amplitude on age is graphically summarized by Duane&#x27;s classical curves.

=====Amplitude of accommodation=====
The amplitude of accommodation is a clinical measurement that describes the maximum potential increase in optical power that an eye can achieve in adjusting its focus. It refers to a certain range of object distances for which the retinal image is as sharply focused as possible. Amplitude of accommodation is measured during routine eye-examination. The closest that a normal eye can focus is typically about 10 cm for a child or young adult. Accommodation then decreases gradually with age, effectively finishing just after age fifty. The average amplitude of accommodation, in diopters, for a patient of a given age was estimated by Hofstetter in 1950 to be 18.5 − (0.30 × patient age in years) with the minimum amplitude of accommodation as 15 − (0.25 × age in years), and the maximum as 25 − (0.40 × age in years). However, Hofstetter&#x27;s work was based on data from two early surveys which, although widely cited, used methodology with considerable inherent error. (Donders, Sheard, Duane, Turner for reference)

=====Theories on how humans focus=====
* Helmholtz—The most widely held theory of accommodation is that proposed by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1855. When viewing a far object, the circularly arranged ciliary muscle relaxes allowing the lens zonules and suspensory ligaments to pull on the lens, flattening it. The source of the tension is the pressure that the vitreous and aqueous humours exert outwards onto the sclera. When viewing a near object, the ciliary muscles contract (resisting the outward pressure on the sclera) causing the lens zonules to slacken which allows the lens to spring back into a thicker, more convex, form.
* Schachar—Ronald A. Schachar proposed in 1992 what has been called a &quot;rather bizarre geometric theory&quot; which claims that focus by the human lens is associated with increased tension on the lens via the equatorial zonules; that when the ciliary muscle contracts, equatorial zonular tension is increased, causing the central surfaces of the crystalline lens to steepen, the central thickness of the lens to increase (anterior-posterior diameter), and the peripheral surfaces of the lens to flatten. While the tension on equatorial zonules is increased during accommodation, the anterior and posterior zonules are simultaneously relaxing. The increased equatorial zonular tension keeps the lens stable and flattens the peripheral lens surface during accommodation. As a consequence, gravity does not affect the amplitude of accommodation and primary spherical aberration shifts in the negative direction during accommodation. The theory has not found much independent support.
* Catenary—D. Jackson Coleman proposes that the lens, zonule and anterior vitreous comprise a diaphragm between the anterior and vitreous chambers of the eye. Ciliary muscle contraction initiates a pressure gradient between the vitreous and aqueous compartments that support the anterior lens shape. It is in this lens shape that the mechanically reproducible state of a steep radius of curvature in the center of the lens with slight flattening of the peripheral anterior lens, i.e. the shape, in cross section, of a catenary occurs. The anterior capsule and the zonule form a trampoline shape or hammock shaped surface that is totally reproducible depending on the circular dimensions, i.e. the diameter of the ciliary body (Müeller&#x27;s muscle). The ciliary body thus directs the shape like the pylons of a suspension bridge, but does not need to support an equatorial traction force to flatten the lens.

=====Induced effects of accommodation=====
When humans accommodate to a near object, they also converge their eyes and constrict their pupils. The combination of these three movements (accommodation, convergence and miosis) is under the control of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and is referred to as the &quot;near triad&quot;, or accommodation reflex. While it is well understood that proper convergence is necessary to prevent diplopia, the functional role of the pupillary constriction remains less clear. Arguably, it may increase the depth of field by reducing the aperture of the eye, and thus reduce the amount of accommodation needed to bring the image in focus on the retina.

There is a measurable ratio (Matthiessen&#x27;s ratio) between how much convergence takes place because of accommodation (AC/A ratio, CA/C ratio). Abnormalities with this can lead to binocular vision problems.

=====Anomalies of accommodation described in humans=====
There are many types of accommodation anomalies. It can be broadly classified into two, decreased accommodation and increased accommodation. Decreased accommodation may occur due to physiological (presbyopia), pharmacological (cycloplegia) or pathological. Excessive accommodation and spasm of accommodation are types of increased accommodation.

=====Presbyopia=====
Presbyopia, physiological insufficiency of accommodation due to age related changes in lens (decreased elasticity and increased hardness) and ciliary muscle power is the commonest form of accommodative dysfunction. It will cause gradual decrease in near vision.

=====Accommodative insufficiency=====
Accommodative insufficiency is the condition where amplitude of accommodation of a person is lesser compared to physiological limits for their age. Premature sclerosis of lens or ciliary muscle weaknesses due to systemic or local cases may cause accommodative insufficiency.
Accommodative insufficiency is further categorised into different categories.

=====Ill-sustained accommodation=====
Ill-sustained accommodation is a condition similar to accommodative insufficiency. In this, range of accommodation will be normal, but after excessive near work accommodative power will decrease.

=====Paralysis of accommodation=====
In paralysis of accommodation, amplitude of accommodation is either markedly reduced or completely absent (cycloplegia). It may occur due to ciliary muscle paralysis or occulomotor nerve paralysis. Parasympatholytic drugs like atropine will also cause paralysis of accommodation.

=====Unequal accommodation=====
If there is amplitude of accommodation between the eyes differ 0.5 dioptre or more, it is considered as unequal. Organic diseases, head trauma or functional amblyopia may be responsible for unequal accommodation.

=====Accommodative infacility=====
Accommodative infacility is also known as accommodative inertia. In this condition there will be difficulty in changing accommodation from one point to other. There may be difficulty in adjusting focus from distance from near. It is a comparatively rare condition.

=====Spasm of accommodation=====
Spasm of accommodation also known as ciliary spasm is a condition of abnormally excessive accommodation which is out of voluntary control of the person. Vision may be blurred due to induced pseudomyopia.

=====Accommodative excess=====
Accommodative excess occurs when an individual uses more than normal accommodation for performing certain near work. Modern definitions simply regard it as an inability to relax accommodation readily.

===Aquatic animals===
 Aquatic animals include some that also thrive in the air so focusing mechanisms vary more than in those that are only land based. Some whales and seals are able to focus above and below water having two areas of retina with high numbers of rods and cones rather than one as in humans. Having two high resolution area of retina presumably allows two axis of vision one for above and one for below water. In reptiles and birds, the ciliary body which supports the lens via suspensory ligaments also touches the lens with a number of pads on its inner surface. These pads compress and release the lens to modify its shape while focusing on objects at different distances; the suspensory ligaments usually perform this function in mammals. With vision in fish and amphibians, the lens is fixed in shape, and focusing is instead achieved by moving the lens forwards or backwards within the eye using a muscle called the retractor lentus.

In cartilaginous fish, the suspensory ligaments are replaced by a membrane, including a small muscle at the underside of the lens. This muscle pulls the lens forward from its relaxed position when focusing on nearby objects. In teleosts, by contrast, a muscle projects from a vascular structure in the floor of the eye, called the &quot;falciform process&quot;, and serves to pull the lens backwards from the relaxed position to focus on distant objects. While amphibians move the lens forward, as do cartilaginous fish, the muscles involved are not similar in either type of animal. In frogs, there are two muscles, one above and one below the lens, while other amphibians have only the lower muscle.

In the simplest vertebrates, the lampreys and hagfish, the lens is not attached to the outer surface of the eyeball at all. There is no aqueous humor in these fish, and the vitreous body simply presses the lens against the surface of the cornea. To focus its eyes, a lamprey flattens the cornea using muscles outside of the eye and pushes the lens backwards.

While not vertebrate, brief mention is made here of the convergent evolution of vertebrate and Molluscan eyes. The most complex Molluscan eye is the Cephalopod eye which is superficially similar structure and function to a vertebrate eye, including accommodation, while differing in basic ways such as having a two part lens and no cornea. The fundamental requirements of optics must be filled by all eyes with lenses using the tissues at their disposal so superficially eyes all tend to look similar. It is the way optical requirements are met using different cell types and structural mechanisms that varies among animals.

<text>Robert O&#x27;Reilly (born March 25, 1950) is an American film, stage, and television actor who has appeared in a variety of roles. He appeared in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise for over ten years, primarily in his recurring role on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; as Chancellor Gowron, the leader of the Klingon Empire. He has also appeared in over 100 films and television episodes, and has acted on Broadway and at Carnegie Hall. His links with the Colony Theatre Company resulted in his receiving a Drama-Logue Award in 1981 for directing the play &quot;Getting Out&quot;.

==Career==
O&#x27;Reilly has appeared in over a hundred films and television episodes, primarily as either the antagonist or as a villain. The television series he has appeared in include &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;Darkroom&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;, &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot;, &quot;MacGyver&quot;, &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, and twice in &quot;Dallas&quot;. His film appearances include the Jim Carrey film &quot;The Mask&quot;. He has retired from acting.

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===

O&#x27;Reilly made his first appearance in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise with an appearance in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Manhunt&quot;. The character he played in that episode has been referred to both as &quot;Tough guy&quot; and &quot;Scarface&quot;. He was then cast as the Klingon Gowron in the episode &quot;Reunion&quot; which saw the character become the new Chancellor of the Klingon Empire. O&#x27;Reilly had just finished appearing on stage as Edmund in &quot;King Lear&quot; and saw similarities between the two characters which resulted in him basing Gowron upon the Shakespearian character. The episode was directed by &quot;TNG&quot; cast member Jonathan Frakes, and O&#x27;Reilly later said that he thought he was hired both for the sense of curiosity he brought to the role and a piercing, unsettling gaze he and others referred to as &quot;that crazy loon eyeball thing&quot;.

He went on to appear as Gowron over the course of the next decade in several further episodes of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, as well as &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. He also filmed segments for the video game &quot;Star Trek: Klingon&quot;, which was also directed by Frakes. The game was the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; game to use real actors, and was awarded the Sci-Fi Universe Reader&#x27;s Choice Universe Award for Best Achievement in Genre Multi-Media. At the time of filming the game, he had heard a rumour that Michael Dorn was joining the cast of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. Given the relationship between Gowron and Dorn&#x27;s character, Worf, O&#x27;Reilly thought that this might lead to his return to a &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series too. Both Dorn and O&#x27;Reilly reprised their characters together in the series four opening episode &quot;The Way of the Warrior&quot;. O&#x27;Reilly also appeared as a different Klingon in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation Interactive VCR Board Game&quot;, a video cassette-based board game. His likeness was used for three action figures, a life-size poster and several lithographs.

After the end of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, O&#x27;Reilly made one further appearance in &quot;Star Trek&quot; as the character Kago-Darr in the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;Bounty&quot;. He was thankful for the role, as he felt that the writers and producers of the show had created it for him specifically as his family was trying to adapt following the birth of his triplets. After his retirement from acting, he continues to attend &quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions, including performing in character as Gowron alongside J. G. Hertzler as fellow Klingon Martok. In 2020, he reprised the voice of Gowron and the Klingon Aakar, an ancestor of Gowron&#x27;s, in the video game &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;.

===Theatre===
O&#x27;Reilly has appeared on Broadway in the revival of &quot;The Tavern&quot;, and also appeared off-Broadway in &quot;The Promise&quot; and at Carnegie Hall in &quot;/&quot; by Nam June Paik. He is currently associated with the Colony Theatre Company as an actor and director. He first became involved with the theatre company about a year after its founding. Amongst these was &quot;Getting Out&quot; by Marsha Norman, for which he was awarded a Drama-Logue Award and nominated for an award by the Los Angeles Drama Critics&#x27; Circle in 1981. He directed &quot;Generations&quot; by Dennis Clontz, which was runner up to the American Theatre Critics&#x27; Association award for best new play outside of New York.

<text>The Canadian Health Network (CHN) was established in 1999 as a national, bilingual health promotion service operated by the Public Health Agency of Canada and major health organizations across Canada. It was an on-line collaborative service and includes health information providers such as national and provincial/territorial non-profit organizations, as well as universities, hospitals, libraries and community organizations.

The CHN offered dependable, up-to-date information on health promotion and disease and injury prevention, to help individuals and communities make healthy choices that improve the quality of their life. It was known to be of the most comprehensive networks of its kind in the world. It was a called a &#x27;network&#x27; since the information was amalgamated from a variety of Canadian health organizations.

In November 2007, the Public Health Agency of Canada announced that the service would end, and on April 1, 2008, the website was replaced with a redirect notice.

<text>Ron Rude (born 24 October 1956) is a rock and roll musician in Melbourne, Australia. He was one of the first Australian indie musicians to self record and release their own material, which he did with the release of his first album &quot;The Borders of Disgrace&quot; in 1979 and is considered to be a pioneer of DIY recording. Rude was also part of the post punk &quot;little band scene&quot; that flourished in Melbourne in the late 1970s to 1980s, and is probably best known (to the general public) for staging a hunger strike in the window of local record shop Missing Link, and the demand that local radio station 3XY play his records, threatening to drown himself in a bucket of water if they did not.

From the years 2001 to 2003, the hunger strike was the subject of a play called &quot;3XY Or I Die.&quot; Since 2001, Rude has been performing new material with a new band called the Ron Rude Renaissance.

<doc id="1192891" wikidata="Q917533" url="?curid=1192891" title="Western Highway (Victoria)">
<text>Western Highway is a major arterial route in western Victoria with a length of approximately of single carriageway, then of dual carriageway known as Western Freeway, linking the western suburbs of Melbourne to the border with South Australia at Serviceton. It is the Victorian part of the principal route linking the Australian cities of Melbourne and Adelaide, and is a part of the National Highway network, designated routes A8 and M8. The western end continues into South Australia as Dukes Highway, the next section of the Melbourne–Adelaide National Highway.

Western Highway is the second-busiest national highway in Australia, in terms of freight movements, with over five million tonnes annually, and provides the link between the eastern seaboard and South Australia and Western Australia.

==Route==

Western Highway commences at the state border with South Australia as a continuation of Dukes Highway at Victoria and heads in a south-easterly direction as a two-lane, single carriageway rural highway with numerous overtaking lanes and passes through the agricultural centres of Nhill, Horsham, Stawell and Ararat. Just west of Buangor, Western Highway becomes Western Freeway and widens to a four-lane, dual-carriageway road, and begins bypassing most of the towns the old alignment of the highway used to serve, passing Ballarat, Ballan and Bacchus Marsh, before reaching the western fringes of suburban Melbourne outside Melton; major intersecting roads are grade-separated, however there remain minor intersections at-grade, and cycling is permitted on the sealed shoulder along most of the freeway. The freeway continues through the suburbs of Rockbank and Ravenhall, before eventually terminating at the interchange with Western Ring Road in Derrimut. 

Plans are underway for the end of this freeway to be extended from the current terminus just after the Buangor bypass westward towards and eventually to Stawell.

==History==
The passing of the &quot;Country Roads Act of 1912&quot; through the Parliament of Victoria provided for the establishment of the Country Roads Board (later VicRoads) and their ability to declare Main Roads, taking responsibility for the management, construction and care of the state&#x27;s major roads from local municipalities. (Main) Ballarat Road was declared a Main Road, from Footscray via Braybrook to Melton on 30 December 1913, and from Melton via Bacchus Marsh, Ballan and Bungaree to Ballarat East on 24 August 1914; Horsham (-Dimboola) Road from Horsham to Dimboola, (Dimboola-) Nhill Road between Dimboola and Nhill and Nhill-Kaniva-Border Road between Nhill through Kaniva to the South Australian border, were declared as Main Roads on 17 March 1915; Ballarat-(Ararat-)Stawell Road between Ballarat West through Beaufort and Ararat to Stawell was declared a Main Road on 31 May 1915.

The passing of the &quot;Highways and Vehicles Act of 1924&quot; provided for the declaration of State Highways, roads two-thirds financed by the State government through the Country Roads Board. Western Highway was declared a State Highway on 1 July 1925, cobbled from a collection of roads from Melbourne through Ballarat, Ararat, Stawell, Horsham, and Dimboola to the interstate border at Serviceton (for a total of 244 miles), subsuming the original declarations of Main Ballarat Road, Ballarat-Stawell Road, Horsham-Dimboola Road, Dimboola-Nhill Road, and Nhill-Kaniva-Border Road as Main Roads. Western By-pass Road was opened in 1969 through Pykes Creek Reservoir, but this was being referred to as Western Freeway by the time the Gordon and Bacchus Marsh bypasses were completed in 1972.

The Whitlam government introduced the federal &quot;National Roads Act 1974&quot;, where roads declared as a National Highway were still the responsibility of the states for road construction and maintenance, but were fully compensated by the Federal government for money spent on approved projects. As an important interstate link between the capitals of Victoria and South Australia, Western Highway was declared a National Highway in 1974.

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: in 2004, VicRoads re-declared the road as Western Highway (Arterial #6520) between the border with South Australia at Serviceton and Buangor, and as Western Freeway (Freeway #1520) between Buangor and Western Ring Road, Derrimut.

Western Highway was signed as National Route 8 in 1955, then as National Highway 8 when upgraded to a National Highway in 1974. With Victoria&#x27;s conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in the late 1990s, the section between Burrumbeet and Ardeer (where it met the Western Ring Road) was re-signed as National Highway M8, and between Burrumbeet and the border as National Highway A8; it was left as National Highway 8 east of the ring road along its original alignment into central Melbourne. Once the Deer Park bypass was opened in 2009, National Route M8 was re-routed onto the new bypass and the old alignment of Western Highway between Ravenhall and Footscray was re-declared as Ballarat Road and replaced with Metropolitan Route 8; VicRoads altered National Highway M8 to route M8 and National Highway A8 to route A8 in 2013, bringing their design in line with the rest of the state. Route M8 was extended further west when the next section of converted freeway to Buangor opened in 2016. Former alignments of Western Highway are generally designated sequentially from route C801 to C805, or as Metropolitan Route 8 (within suburban Melbourne).

The newest sections of freeway-standard dual carriageway opened on 6 March 2015 for the Ballarat to Beaufort section (running in length), and on 17 April 2016 for the Beaufort to Buangor section (running in length). The first section runs between the end of the Ballarat bypass between a new interchange with the Avenue of Remembrance (route C805) in Burrumbeet to just outside the eastern side Beaufort (including a bypass of Trawalla) providing of freeway standard road between Melbourne and Beaufort. The second section runs between just outside the western side of Beaufort to just after the Buangor bypass, where it becomes a single carriageway again running all the way to Ararat, providing a further of freeway standard between Beaufort and just beyond Buangor.

The Melbourne section of Western Highway is shown in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan as part of the F12 Freeway corridor.

*2016 – Beaufort to Buangor opened to traffic in April 2016 adding a further of dual carriageway to the existing freeway, which includes the Buangor bypass.

===Deer Park Bypass===
The Deer Park Bypass opened on 5 April 2009 in the western suburbs of Melbourne. The freeway links Western Freeway at Ravenhall and the Western Ring Road in Derrimut. This 9.3 kilometre freeway was estimated to cost which also includes a grade separated (or &quot;full diamond&quot;) interchange at Leakes Road in Rockbank.

The purpose of the freeway bypass is to move traffic off Ballarat Road, which leads to the Western Ring Road. Due to the strong population growth of about 8.7 per cent and subdivision in Deer Park and Sunshine, the surrounding suburbs and the seven traffic signals between the Western Ring Road and the start of Western Freeway, substantial long and very frustrating delays were created for the 70,000 vehicles per day with 10 per cent of this consisting of heavy vehicles.

The bypass had been proposed since the completion of the Western Ring Road, the project stalled due to funding quarrels between the Federal and State Governments. In 2004, the Federal government announced that the Deer Park Bypass would be built as part of a $1.4 billion project &quot;package grant&quot; to Victoria. It was anticipated that more than 15 min of travel time would be saved when travelling through Deer Park, via Ballarat Road. Construction started on the Deer Park bypass in August 2006, work being carried out as a joint venture by Leighton Contractors and VicRoads, in construction with two contracts. The first stage, allowing westbound traffic over the new bridge at the Ravenhall end of the new freeway, opened in December 2007.

It was announced on 4 March 2009 that the Deer Park Bypass would open in early April 2009, with the new freeway link on track to open more than eight months ahead of schedule. On that day, Roads and Ports Minister Tim Pallas and Federal Member for Gorton Brendan O&#x27;Connor MP inspected works from the new bridge over the Ring Road at Sunshine West and Tim Pallas announced that the $331 million Deer Park Bypass would open to the public on Sunday 5 April 2009.

===Anthony&#x27;s Cutting realignment===
The section of road through Anthony&#x27;s Cutting between Bacchus Marsh and Melton was one of the most dangerous sections of the route, and was not of modern freeway standard. The steep hills and tight curves along the 5 kilometre long stretch of road resulted in 21 serious crashes in the five years to 2010. More than 29,000 vehicles, including more than 4000 freight vehicles, travelled the highway section daily. The new route opened to traffic on 27 June 2011, nine months ahead of schedule.

The project included:
* Extension of Woolpack Road north from Bacchus Marsh Road to a new interchange on Western Freeway, including a bridge over the Lerderderg River.
* An overpass carrying Bulmans Road over the existing Western Freeway.
* An overpass taking Hopetoun Park Road across the new freeway, with Melbourne-bound on and off ramps.
* Freeway bridges spanning Djerriwarrh Creek, and Cowans Road / Pyrites Creek.

The original project scope included a diamond interchange at Bulmans Road that has not been built, while the ramps at Hopetoun Park Road were not included but was later added. The extension of Woolpack Road has been delayed due to controversy over need to clear trees in the heritage listed Avenue of Honour at Bacchus Marsh.

Realignment of the road through this section had been proposed far back as 2001, when a group of 10 local councils said the realignment could cost just $65 million to build. By 2006 the cost was estimated to be $85 million, with federal Roads Minister Jim Lloyd stating that the project would receive serious consideration for funding in the 2009 AusLink document, subject to support from the State Government. Construction commenced in February 2010, funded by $160 million from the Australian Government and $40 million from the Victorian Government.

===Armstrong deviation===
In 2001 work started on a 4.2 kilometre long deviation at Armstrong (on the Adelaide side of Ararat), involving 200,000 cubic metres of earthworks and a new bridge over the main Melbourne–Adelaide railway. Previously high vehicles could not travel under the rail overpass and were forced to detour around it, in addition the poor road conditions led to a number of accidents and fatalities. Costing $6.1 million the work was completed by 2003.

== Future upgrades ==
, several at-grade intersections remained on the &quot;freeway&quot;, particularly in the areas near Rockbank and at Woodmans Hill just to the east of Ballarat.
* Proposed upgrade and safety improvements Rockbank to Melton, to be funded by Auslink 2 (2009–2014).
* Proposed extension west from the current freeway terminus in the Melbourne side of Beaufort West through to Ararat and eventually to Stawell, also part of Auslink 2. Beaufort to Buangor was completed in April 2016. Buangor Bypass completed in mid-2016, and Buangor to Ararat was expected to start in early 2017.

Duplication of Western Highway between Ballarat and Stawell was proposed to be completed between 2009 and 2014, to be funded by Auslink 2. At the end of 2016, some parts were still in early planning, including the bypasses at Beaufort and Ararat.

The clearing of wide swathes of the ancient red gums by VicRoads near Beaufort resulted in expressions of community concern, including public meetings. In 2015, two women chained themselves to a red gum tree for 4½ hours near Buangor, west of Ballarat, to draw attention to the issue. Isabel Mackenzie, a long-term resident of the area, said she was concerned at the environmental impact of removing trees that are hundreds of years old. Helen Lewers said that VicRoads should reroute the highway between Buangor and Stawell to preserve the native roadside vegetation.

<text>The first USS &quot;Miami&quot; was a side-wheel steamer, double-ender gunboat in the United States Navy during the American Civil War.

&quot;Miami&quot; was launched by Philadelphia Navy Yard on November 16, 1861, and commissioned there on January 29, 1862, Lieutenant Abram Davis Harrell in command.

== Service history ==
===Battle of New Orleans===
The wooden-hulled gunboat was ordered February 5, 1862, to proceed to Ship Island, Mississippi for duty in the Mortar Flotilla organized to neutralize Confederate riverside forts during Admiral David Farragut&#x27;s impending attack on New Orleans, Louisiana. &quot;Miami&quot; reached Ship Island on March 19 and headed for Pass a l&#x27;Outre where she entered the Mississippi River to join Commander David Dixon Porter&#x27;s flotilla.

During the next few weeks she was busy preparing for the assault. On April 13, &quot;Miami&quot; joined , , , and and steamed upstream. A Confederate steamer exchanged fire with Union ships before scurrying upriver to safety. Early in the morning, five days later, &quot;Miami&quot; towed three mortar schooners to predesignated positions below Fort St. Philip and Fort Jackson when the Union ships bombarded the Confederate works which guarded the approach to New Orleans. The shelling continued intermittently until it reached crescendo before dawn on April 24 as Admiral Farragut led his deep draft, salt water fleet up the Mississippi in a daring dash past the forts.

&quot;Miami&quot; remained below with the mortar schooners providing covering fire for Farragut&#x27;s ships as they ran the gauntlet. When the Federal vessels had reached safety, &quot;Miami&quot; turned to transporting U.S. Army troops to positions for launching an attack on the forts by land, and continued the task until the forts surrendered to the Navy on April 28.

Farragut ordered the Mortar Flotilla to Ship Island on May 1 to prepare for action against Mobile, Alabama. Porter left Ship Island with his steamers and 
 on May 7 for Mobile Bay to prepare for an attack. After planting buoys to mark safe channels for Farragut&#x27;s deep-draft ships, the steamers returned to Ship Island. On May 10 Porter, who had remained off Mobile on blockade duty, reoccupied Pensacola, Florida after it bad been burned and abandoned by Confederate troops. Although most military and naval installations in the area had been destroyed or severely damaged by thorough Southern demolition work, Porter recognized the strategic advantages of Pensacola as a naval base and shifted his flotilla there from Ship Island.

===Vicksburg Campaign===
Meanwhile, Farragut, upon returning from a daring expedition up the Mississippi River to Vicksburg, Mississippi had received &quot;stringent orders to send a large force up the river&quot; to join forces with Admiral Charles Henry Davis&#x27; western flotilla in clearing the entire Mississippi Valley. He accordingly sent for Porter&#x27;s mortar schooners to shell the heights of Vicksburg which could not be reached by his flotilla&#x27;s guns.

&quot;Miami&quot; reached New Orleans on June 7 and spent the following fortnight towing schooners upriver. She reached Vicksburg on June 21 for a week&#x27;s service moving schooners in and out of firing positions and shelling the cliffside batteries herself. On June 28 her guns engaged the Confederate cannon while Farragut&#x27;s ships ran by the Vicksburg batteries to join the armed riverboats of Admiral Davis&#x27; Western Flotilla. The joining of the salt water and fresh water squadrons buoyed morale throughout the North, but the strategic potential of the feat was largely nullified by a lack of ground forces to take and hold key points along the river. Farragut returned to the lower river on July 15.

&quot;Miami&quot; departed Ship Island on September 1 and arrived at Fort Monroe on September 9. After two months devoted to reconnaissance duty up the James River, blockade duty in Hampton Roads, and refitting, &quot;Miami&quot; got underway from Norfolk, Virginia on November 9 and entered the North Carolina sounds the following day. There she helped enforce the blockade, deterred Confederate military activity and gathered intelligence.

===Action against CSS &quot;Albemarle&quot;===
In an effort to counter the effect of Union naval superiority in the sounds, the Confederacy constructed a number of ironclads in North Carolina. One, CSS &quot;Albemarle&quot;, built at Scotland Neck, North Carolina, afforded &quot;Miami&quot; the highlight of her service in the sounds. On April 17, 1864, Confederate troops launched a sustained attack on Plymouth, North Carolina. Union gunboats moved to support their troops ashore and were promptly taken under fire by the Southern batteries. Next day, the fighting at Plymouth intensified as the Confederates pressed the assault. Union Army steamer USS &quot;Bombshell&quot; was sunk during the engagement, but by 9:00 PM, the Southern advance had been halted.

Lieutenant Commander Charles W. Flusser reported: &quot;The and &quot;Miami&quot; took part and the general says our firing was admirable.&quot; The southern attack required naval support in order to achieve success, and Flusser added meaningfully: &quot;The ram will be down tonight or tomorrow.&quot;

Confederate ironclad &quot;Albemarle&quot; had departed Hamilton, North Carolina on the evening of April 17, and anchored above Plymouth the following night. Shortly after midnight on April 19, &quot;Albemarle&quot; weighed anchor and stood down to engage. Meanwhile, anticipating an attack by the ram, Lieutenant Commander Flusser lashed &quot;Miami&quot; and &quot;Southfield&quot; together for mutual protection and concentration of firepower. As &quot;Albemarle&quot; appeared, he gallantly headed the two light wooden ships directly at the southern ram, firing as they approached. &quot;Albemarle&quot; struck &quot;Southfield&quot; a devastating blow with her ram. It was reported that she &quot;tore a hole clear through to the boiler&quot; and &quot;Albemarle&quot;&#x27;s captain stated that his ship plunged 10 feet into the side of the wooden gunboat. Though backing immediately after the impact, &quot;Albemarle&quot; could not at once wrench herself free from the sinking &quot;Southfield&quot;, and thus could not reply effectively to the fire poured into her by &quot;Miami&quot;. At last her prow was freed as &quot;Southfield&quot; sank, and &quot;Albemarle&quot; forced Flusser&#x27;s ship to withdraw under a heavy cannonade. Small steamer and tinclad moved downriver also. The shot of the Union ships had been ineffective against the heavily plated, sloping sides of the ram.

Early in the engagement, Lieutenant Commander Flusser had been killed. Brigadier General Henry Walton Wessels, commanding Union troops at Plymouth, noted: &quot;In the death of this accomplished sailor the Navy has lost one of its brightest ornaments...&quot;

&quot;Albemarle&quot; now controlled the water approaches to Plymouth and rendered invaluable support to Confederate States Army moves ashore, giving the South a taste of the priceless advantage Union armies enjoyed in all theaters throughout the war. On April 20, Plymouth fell to the southern attack. On May 5, &quot;Miami&quot; and other Union ships engaged &quot;Albemarle&quot; again at the Battle of Albemarle Sound. The battle was inconclusive; the &quot;Albemarle&quot; and USS &quot;Sassacus&quot; were both damaged, and the CSS &quot;Bombshell&quot; (the former USS &quot;Bombshell&quot;) was captured. &quot;Albemarle&quot;&#x27;s threat to Union naval supremacy in North Carolina waters was ended October 27 when Lieutenant William B. Cushing exploded a spar torpedo under the ironclad&#x27;s overhanging armor, tearing a hole in her wooden hull.

===The drive on Richmond===
Shifting to the James River to support General Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s drive on Richmond, Virginia, &quot;Miami&quot; engaged Confederate batteries at Wilcox&#x27;s Landing, Virginia. Proceeding toward heavy firing, &quot;Miami&quot; had discovered batteries at Wilcox&#x27;s Landing firing on Union transports. She immediately open a brisk cannonade, and after an hour the Confederates withdrew. Next day, &quot;Miami&quot;, accompanied by , drove off batteries which were firing on another group of transports near Harrison&#x27;s Landing, Virginia on the James River. Throughout the embattled South, Union gunboats kept communications and supply lines open despite the efforts of the Confederates to sever them.

For the remainder of the war, &quot;Miami&quot; operated in the James River now commanded by Lt. George W Graves, playing an important role in the naval effort, assisting Grant&#x27;s unrelenting pressures on the Confederate capitol which finally forced Lee to surrender at Appomattox Courthouse, Virginia on April 9, 1865.

The double-ender decommissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on May 22, 1865, and was sold at auction in Philadelphia on August 10, 1865. &quot;Miami&quot; served American commerce until 1869.

<text>Tiffany &amp; Co. (colloquially known as Tiffany&#x27;s) is an American luxury jewelry and specialty design house headquartered on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Tiffany is known for its luxury goods, particularly its sterling silver and diamond jewelry. These goods are sold at Tiffany stores, online, and through corporate merchandising. Its name and branding are licensed to Coty for fragrances and to Luxottica for eyewear.

Tiffany &amp; Co. was founded in 1837 by the jeweler Charles Lewis Tiffany and became famous in the early 20th century under the artistic direction of his son Louis Comfort Tiffany. In 2018, net sales totaled US$4.44 billion. , Tiffany operated over 300 stores globally, in many countries including the United States, Japan, and Canada, as well as Europe, Latin America, and the collective Asia-Pacific region, and is exploring opportunities in Africa. The company&#x27;s product line features fine jewelry, sterling silver, watches, porcelain, crystal, stationery, fragrance and personal accessories, and leather goods.

On January 7, 2021, French conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton acquired a majority stake in Tiffany &amp; Co. for US$15.8 billion and delisted Tiffany&#x27;s stock from the New York Stock Exchange. It remains headquartered in New York City.

==History==

===Establishment===
Tiffany &amp; Co. was founded in 1837 by Charles Lewis Tiffany and John B. Young, in New York City, as a &quot;stationery and fancy goods emporium&quot;, with the help of Charles Tiffany&#x27;s father, who financed the store for only $1,000 with profits from a cotton mill. The store initially sold a wide variety of stationery items and, as of 1837, operated as &quot;Tiffany, Young and Ellis&quot; at 259 Broadway in Lower Manhattan. The name was shortened to Tiffany &amp; Company in 1853, when Charles Tiffany took control and established the firm&#x27;s emphasis on jewelry. The company has since opened stores in major cities worldwide. Unlike other stores at the time in the 1830s, Tiffany clearly marked the prices on its goods to forestall any haggling over prices. In addition, against the social norm at the time, Tiffany only accepted cash payments, and did not allow purchases on credit. Such practices (fixed prices for ready money) had first been introduced in 1750 by Palmer&#x27;s of London Bridge.

===&quot;Blue Book&quot; and the Civil War===
The first Tiffany mail order catalog, known as the &quot;Blue Book&quot;, was published in 1845 in the United States (U.S.), and publishing of the catalog continues in the 21st century. In 1862, Tiffany supplied the Union Army with swords (Model 1840 Cavalry Saber), flags and surgical implements. In 1867, Tiffany was the first U.S. firm to win an award for excellence in silverware at the &quot;Exposition Universelle&quot; in Paris. In 1868, Tiffany was incorporated.

===&quot;Gilded Age&quot;===
In 1870, the company built a new store building at 15 Union Square West, Manhattan, which was designed by John Kellum and cost US$500,000. It was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a &quot;palace of jewels.&quot; Tiffany stayed at this site until 1906.

In 1877, an insignia that would become the New York Yankees &quot;NY&quot; logo was struck on a police medal of honor by Tiffany; the Yankees adopted the logo in 1909. In 1878, Tiffany won the gold medal for jewelry and a grand prize for silverware at the Paris Exposition. In 1879, Tiffany purchased one of the world&#x27;s largest yellow diamonds which became known as the Tiffany Diamond. The Tiffany Diamond has only been worn by four people, one of whom was Audrey Hepburn for the promotion of &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;. In 1887, Tiffany bought a number of pieces at the auction of part of the French Crown Jewels, which attracted publicity and further solidified the Tiffany brand&#x27;s association with high-quality diamonds. The company revised the Great Seal of the United States in 1885.

===20th century===

In 1902, after the death of Charles Lewis Tiffany, his son, Louis Comfort Tiffany, became the company&#x27;s first official design director. 

Renowned for his innovations in stained glass, Louis Comfort Tiffany also made significant contributions to Art Nouveau jewelry. His pioneering work with iridescent glass, opals, and enamel introduced new techniques in jewelry design, blending organic forms with vibrant colors. Tiffany’s innovative use of glass, enamel, and opals became a hallmark of his style, creating pieces that shimmered with light and color, adding depth and vibrancy. These materials were key elements in creating unique jewelry that enhanced Tiffany &amp; Co.&#x27;s reputation during the Art Nouveau period. 

In 1905, the Manhattan flagship store was relocated to the corner of 37th Street and Fifth Avenue, where it would remain for 35 years.

In 1919, the company made a revision to the Medal of Honor on behalf of the United States Department of the Navy. This &quot;Tiffany Cross&quot; version was rare because it was awarded only for combat, using the previous design for non-combat awards. In 1942, the Navy established the Tiffany version for &quot;non&quot;-combat heroism as well but, in August 1942, the Navy subsequently eliminated the Tiffany Cross and the two-medal system.

The company moved its flagship store to its present-day 727 Fifth Avenue building in 1940; the building was designed by Cross &amp; Cross. In 1956, legendary designer Jean Schlumberger joined Tiffany, and Andy Warhol collaborated with the company to create Tiffany holiday cards (circa 1956–1962). Schlumberger&#x27;s designs, such as the Bird on a Rock brooch, became synonymous with the company&#x27;s post-war jewelry innovations. His ability to blend nature and fantasy in high jewelry remains iconic today. In 1968, Lady Bird Johnson, First Lady of the U.S. at the time, commissioned Tiffany to design a White House china-service that featured 90 flowers.

In November 1978, Tiffany &amp; Co. was sold to Avon Products, Inc for about US$104 million in stock. However, in a 1984 &quot;Newsweek&quot; article, the Fifth Avenue Tiffany store was likened to the Macy&#x27;s department store during a white sale, due to the high number of inexpensive items on sale; furthermore, customers complained about declining quality and service. In August 1984, Avon sold Tiffany to an investor group led by William R. Chaney for $135.5 million in cash. Tiffany went public again in 1987 and raised about $103.5 million from the sale of 4.5 million shares of common stock.

Due to the 1990–1991 recession in the United States, Tiffany commenced an emphasis upon mass merchandising. A new campaign was launched that stressed how Tiffany could be affordable for all; for example, the company advertised that the price of diamond engagement rings started at $850. &quot;How to Buy a Diamond&quot; brochures were sent to 40,000 people, who called a toll-free number specifically set up to target the broader population. However, to maintain its image as a luxury goods company, high-style images remained on display in Tiffany stores.

On September 4, 1994, a jewelry heist occurred at the store in New York City, in which six men stole $1.9 million of jewelry. During the incident, no shots were fired and no vandalism occurred. Two weeks after the robbery, the six men were arrested and the jewelry was recovered.

Tiffany &amp; Co. trademarked their signature Tiffany Blue color in 1998. Three years later they partnered with Pantone to standardize the color as &quot;1837 Blue&quot;.

===2000s===

The Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation was established in 2000 to provide grants to nonprofit organizations working in the areas of the environment and the arts. In June 2004, Tiffany sued eBay, claiming that the latter was making profits from the sale of counterfeit Tiffany products; however, Tiffany lost both at trial and on appeal.

Tiffany &amp; Co. established their subsidiary Laurelton Diamonds in 2002 to manage Tiffany&#x27;s worldwide diamond supply chain.

In 2009, a collaboration between the Japanese mobile-phone operator SoftBank and Tiffany &amp; Co. was announced. The two companies designed a cellphone, limited to ten copies, and containing more than 400 diamonds, totaling more than . Each cellphone cost more than 100 million yen (£781,824).

Also in 2009, the company launched their Tiffany Keys collection.

===2010s and 2020s===
In early July 2013, former Tiffany &amp; Co. vice president Ingrid Lederhaas-Okun was arrested and charged with stealing and re-selling more than $1.3 million of diamond bracelets, drop earrings, and other jewelry. Lederhaas-Okun quickly pleaded guilty to theft and was later sentenced to one year in federal prison.

The company&#x27;s Francesca Amfitheatrof-designed Tiffany T collection debuted in 2014.

In February 2017, the company announced that CEO Frédéric Cuménal was out of a job, effective immediately, after only 22 months, blaming weak sales results. He was replaced on an interim basis by the company&#x27;s longtime former CEO, Michael Kowalski. Shortly before his abrupt departure, Cuménal had appointed former Coach designer Reed Krakoff as the company&#x27;s new chief artistic officer. Although Krakoff had had no previous experience with jewellery design, his previous success with Coach and &quot;deep understanding of iconic American design&quot; led to his appointment, with the hopes that Krakoff would be able to refresh the image of the brand.

In April 2017, the company launched their Tiffany HardWear collection.

In July 2017, it was announced that Bulgari veteran Alessandro Bogliolo would be taking over as CEO. Under his leadership, it was hoped that Tiffany &amp; Co. could turn around slumping sales and capture a younger audience.

Tiffany &amp; Co. opened the Blue Box Cafe in New York City in November 2017. Also in November 2017, the company launched their Home &amp; Accessories line.

In March 2018, the company opened the Jewelry Design and Innovation Workshop, a new 17,000-square-foot atelier.

In May 2018, Tiffany launched their Paper Flowers Collection, designed by Reed Krakoff.

In September 2018, Tiffany launched their Paper Flowers collection in Asia. That same month, the company debuted a new proprietary engagement ring design called the Tiffany True.

In August 2019, Tiffany launched their first men&#x27;s jewelry collection in October of the same year. The line was developed by Reed Krakoff.

In October 2019, Tiffany opened a new brand exhibition in Shanghai, China called &quot;Vision &amp; Virtuosity&quot;.

Tiffany opened its first store in New Delhi, India on 3 February 2020.

After the start of Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the brand announced that it was stopping purchasing diamonds from Russia. However, it was later revealed that they continued to purchase through intermediaries, including the UAE.

==== Acquisition by LVMH ====
In November 2019, LVMH announced its purchase of Tiffany &amp; Co for $16.2 billion, $135 per share. LVMH cancelled the pending purchase in September 2020, with Tiffany filing a lawsuit asking the court to compel the purchase or to assess damages against LVMH. The same month, &quot;Forbes&quot; reported that LVMH had cancelled the deal because Tiffany was paying millions in dividends to shareholders despite financial losses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some US$70 million had already been paid by Tiffany, with an additional US$70 million to be paid in November 2020. LVMH filed a counterclaim against Tiffany for its mismanagement during the pandemic.

The case was set aside after LVMH agreed to purchase Tiffany at a reduced price of almost $16 billion in October 2020. The $15.8 billion deal was approved by shareholders in December 2020. Tiffany was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange when the deal closed in January 2021. After LVMH&#x27;s acquisition, several of Tiffany&#x27;s senior leaders were replaced with executives from other sectors of LVMH. Alexandre Arnault was given the role of executive vice president.

==Stores==

Since 1940, Tiffany&#x27;s flagship store has operated at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street in Manhattan, New York City. The polished granite exterior is well known for its window displays, and the store has been the location for a number of films, including &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, starring Audrey Hepburn, and &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;, starring Reese Witherspoon. Beginning in 2019, the store underwent an extensive renovation, concluding in 2023 and reopening to the public on April 27. The project was designed by American architect Peter Marino.

The former Tiffany and Company Building on 37th Street is on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

When it opened in 1990, the Tiffany &amp; Co. store at Fairfax Square in Tysons Corner, Virginia, became the largest outside of New York City, with of retail space.

In France, Tiffany stores are located in Rue de la Paix and the Avenue des Champs Elysées (the largest European store) in Paris.

In Australia, Tiffany&#x27;s flagship store is located on Collins Street in Melbourne, first established in 1996. Tiffany has since opened a further eight stores in Australia, located in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide and the Gold Coast. 

On March 8, 2001, Tiffany launched its first Latin American store in São Paulo, Brazil, located in the Iguatemi São Paulo shopping center. The company opened a second store in the city on October 20, 2003, near the famous Oscar Freire Street.

In 2004, Tiffany created &quot;Iridesse&quot;, a chain of stores dedicated to pearl-only jewelry. The company operated 16 stores in Florida, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Virginia. However, the chain operated at a loss since its founding and the company announced in early 2009 that, despite its continued belief in the concept, it would discontinue Iridesse due to the Great Recession.

As of 2018, Tiffany operated 93 stores in the US and 321 stores worldwide, including (as of 31 January 2017) 55 locations in Japan and 85 in the Asia-Pacific region. Net sales in 2018 totaled US$4.44 billion.

In December 2023, Tiffany opened a store in Shanghai Taikoo Li Qiantan, with the facade designed by MVRDV. This opening followed earlier work between the two companies at Singapore&#x27;s Changi Airport for which MVRDV created a 3-D printed facade using recycled ocean plastic.

In April 2024, Tiffany &amp; Co. opened their newest store at QueensPlaza in Brisbane.

==Advertising==

After the initial publication of the &quot;Blue Book&quot; Tiffany catalog in 1845, Tiffany continued to use its catalog as part of its advertisement strategy. The Tiffany catalog, one of the first catalogs printed in full color, remained free until 1972. Tiffany&#x27;s mail-order catalogs reached 15 million people in 1994. Tiffany also produces a corporate-gift catalog each year, and corporate customers purchase Tiffany products for business gift-giving, employee-service and achievement-recognition awards, and for customer incentives. As of 2013 Tiffany still produces a catalog for subscribers, but its advertisement strategy no longer focuses primarily on its catalog.

In addition to the mail-order catalog, Tiffany displays its advertisements in many locations, including at bus stops, in magazines and newspapers, and online. With the advent of new technologies, Tiffany placed banner advertisements in the &quot;New York Times&quot;&#x27; mobile app for the iPhone, whereby the user can download the Tiffany app. In January 2015, Tiffany launched its first ever same-sex couple campaign.

In 2017, Tiffany partnered with American pop star Lady Gaga for an ad campaign promoting the company&#x27;s HardWear collection. The announcement came as a Super Bowl ad prior to Lady Gaga&#x27;s Super Bowl LI halftime show performance.

In May 2018, Tiffany partnered with Spotify for the launch of Tiffany&#x27;s &quot;Believe in Dreams&quot; campaign and Paper Flowers collection, releasing a cover of the song &quot;Moon River&quot; by Elle Fanning and rapper A$AP Ferg on the music streaming service.

In 2019, Tiffany partnered with American celebrity Kendall Jenner to promote the company&#x27;s spring fashion line.

In 2021, Tiffany partnered with American singer Beyoncé and rapper Jay-Z to promote the company&#x27;s &quot;About Love&quot; campaign. Beyoncé became the fourth woman, and first Black woman, to wear the Tiffany Yellow Diamond. The campaign incorporated Tiffany&#x27;s recently acquired robin egg blue painting, &quot;Equals Pi&quot; (1982), by American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.

In 2022, Tiffany partnered with Curtis Kulig while retaining his original &quot;Love Me&quot; concept, Kulig also created other love-themed messages such as: &quot;Dare Me,&quot; &quot;Know Me,&quot; and &quot;Kiss Me&quot; to be displayed alongside the Tiffany HardWear, Tiffany Knot and Tiffany T collections.

In 2023, actress Anya Taylor-Joy became the face of Tiffany&#x27;s fine jewelry campaign. She features prominently in the 2023 Blue Book collection.

==Products==

===Diamonds===

Tiffany is known for its luxury goods, particularly its diamond and sterling silver jewelry.

George Frederick Kunz (1856–1932), a Tiffany gemologist, became instrumental in the international adoption of the metric carat as a weight standard for gems. The Tiffany Yellow Diamond () is usually on display in the New York City flagship store.

In 1886, founder Charles Tiffany conceived of the Tiffany Setting ring design, in which six prongs hold the diamond off of the band, in order to better accentuate the diamond.

Like other similar diamond retailers, Tiffany enacts a strict policy against the repurchasing of diamonds sold from its stores. In 1978, a woman in New York City was denied after she attempted to sell back a diamond ring she had bought from Tiffany two years earlier for $100,000.

In 2019, Tiffany CEO Alessandro Bogliolo announced that in 2020 the company would become transparent regarding the country or region of origin of the company&#x27;s newly sourced and individually registered diamonds.

===Colored gemstones===
Tiffany offers jewelry incorporating a wide variety of colored gemstones, including gems it played a role in popularizing, such as tsavorite, kunzite, and morganite. In February 2015 a turquoise and aquamarine bib designed by Francesca Amfitheatrof, Tiffany&#x27;s design director, and worn by Cate Blanchett at the 2015 Academy Awards, contrasted favorably with the white–diamond encrusted jewelry worn by other stars.

===Fragrances===

In the late 1980s, Tiffany &amp; Co. ventured into the fragrance business. &quot;Tiffany&quot; for women was launched in 1987, a floral perfume for women by perfumer François Demachy. At $220 per ounce, &quot;Tiffany&quot; was successfully marketed by major department stores across the United States. Two years later, &quot;Tiffany for Men&quot; was launched in 1989 and developed by perfumer Jacques Polge. The bottles for both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s fragrance were designed by Pierre Dinand. In 1995, Tiffany launched &quot;Trueste&quot; perfume for women, which was later discontinued.

In October 2019, Tiffany launched a new fragrance line, Tiffany &amp; Love.

In 2021, Tiffany &amp; Co. joined the LCK sponsorship team after noticing the league&#x27;s rapid growth. Tiffany &amp; Co. would award championship rings to the winners of the LCK finals for the next three years beginning with the Summer Split of 2021. In LPL, a trophy was designed by Tiffany and Co. for the new Silver Dragon Cup to commemorate LoL&#x27;s tenth anniversary in China.

From the 2022 League of Legends World Championship onwards, Tiffany &amp; Co. are the official makers of the newly redesigned Summoner&#x27;s Cup, which was first awarded to DRX after their 3-2 victory over T1.

Since 2023, Tiffany &amp; Co. has manufactured the NBA Cup and Cup MVP trophies, awarded to the winning team and most valuable player of the NBA&#x27;s annual In-Season Tournament.

==Philanthropy==
In 2000, The Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation awarded its first grant to support coral and marine conservation. To date, the foundation has awarded over $20 million in grant money to coral and marine conservation causes. Tiffany launched their Save the Wild Collection in 2017, a line at promoting endangered wildlife conservation. Save the Wild debuted as part of the #KnotOnMyPlanet wildlife conservation campaign. In 2018, Tiffany announced a commitment of approximately $1.4 million to Australia for efforts to protect and conserve the Great Barrier Reef.

==Corporate sustainability efforts==
Tiffany has bought ethically mined gold since 1992. The company also abides by the Kimberley certification process when sourcing diamonds.

Tiffany discontinued sales of coral jewelry in 2004 due to declining oceanic health. In 2005, Tiffany joined Earthwork&#x27;s No Dirty Gold campaign, becoming the first jewelry company to apply the Earthwork&#x27;s Golden Rules for responsible mining.

In 2006, Tiffany &amp; Co. joined Microsoft, IdustriALL Global Union, United Steelworkers along with others in founding the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance, known as IRMA.

In 2011, Tiffany joined the United Nations Global Compact initiative in efforts to align company operations with the non-binding global sustainability and human rights goals.

In 2015, Anisa Costa was appointed Tiffany&#x27;s first-ever Chief Sustainability Officer. That same year, Tiffany pledged to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The company also advocated for the U.S. to remain in the Paris Agreement along with other companies.

==In popular culture==
The retailer has been mentioned in various works, most notably in the title of the 1958 Truman Capote novella &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, adapted as the 1961 film starring Audrey Hepburn.

<text>This Picture were a UK alternative rock band that was formed in 1989 in Cheltenham, England and broke up in 1995, after releasing two albums.

==History==
The band consisted of lead singer Symon Bye, Duncan Forrester (drums), Robert Forrester (guitar), and Austen Rowley, who replaced original bass player Steve Hughes in 1991. The band released two albums, the Kevin Moloney-produced &quot;A Violent Impression&quot; (1991) and &quot;City of Sin&quot; (1994), both issued by RCA Records in the U.S. and Dedicated Records in the UK.

Tom Demalon drew comparisons to U2 and Hothouse Flowers in his review of the album &quot;Violent Impression&quot;. Demalon gave the album 2 stars in the review for AllMusic. In an interview for the online music magazine Perfect Sound Forever, Forrester described the thinking behind the change of bass player and also talks about the troubled second album and eventual band split.

Bye and Duncan Forrester kept in touch and continued to write and record, eventually signing a deal with EMI Publishing. Symon was also a member of a band called &#x27;d tone &amp; Me&#x27; and four of his songs are featured in a movie directed by E D Maytum, called &quot;Blind&quot; (2007).

Robert and Duncan Forrester started a new band with Steve Whitfield (ex Belljar) called &#x27;Western Electric Sound System&#x27; is writing and recording material.

<text>Divine Discontent is the fourth studio album by American band Sixpence None the Richer, released on October 29, 2002.

== Background ==
Lead singer Leigh Nash has described her understanding of the album title as being that &quot;sometimes your pain and the bad things you go through in life can be good if they bring you to a better place, a stronger place in your life,&quot; that is, &quot;discontent can be divine.&quot; The album&#x27;s completion and release was delayed due to a protracted struggle with their prior record label which Nash has described as being a low point for her, but that the process had made her emotionally stronger. In press notes, lead songwriter Matt Slocum said that there is &quot;spiritual content&quot; in many of his songs which come from &quot;trying to be honest about the issues of life,&quot; while adding that &quot;it also comes more in the form of asking questions than giving answers.&quot;

The cover of Crowded House&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It&#x27;s Over&quot; was one of the later songs to be selected for the album, as it was a request by the label. However, the band was an admirer of Neil Finn and so did not mind.

Nash and Slocum parted ways in early 2004 before reuniting to record the &quot;My Dear Machine&quot; EP in 2008.

== Critical reception ==
Nikki Tranter of &quot;PopMatters&quot; praised &quot;Divine Discontent&quot; as &quot;an expertly written, musically tight, effortlessly executed ride, proving that, as musical partners, Nash and Slocum are a force to be reckoned with.&quot;

In 2003, the song &quot;Breathe Your Name&quot; won the GMA Dove Award for Modern Rock/Alternative Recorded Song of the Year.

<text>Ultimate Spider-Man is a superhero comic book series that was published by Marvel Comics from 2000 to 2011. The series is a modernized re-imagining of Marvel&#x27;s long-running Spider-Man comic book franchise as part of the company&#x27;s Ultimate Marvel imprint. Ultimate Spider-Man exists alongside other revamped Marvel characters in Ultimate Marvel titles including &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;, &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot; and &quot;The Ultimates&quot; in the fictional setting of Earth-1610.

Orphaned at the age of six, Peter Parker is an outcast and withdrawn teenaged science prodigy, who lives in Queens, New York. While attending a field trip to a scientific corporation, he is bitten by a genetically-modified spider and as a result, begins to develop spider-like superpowers, including enhanced strength, speed, agility, stamina, durability and reflexes, along with the ability to crawl solid surfaces and a sixth sense, which warns him of imminent danger, all of which he decides to utilize for personal gain. When an armed thief, whom Peter had encountered earlier and refused to stop out of spite, later murders his foster father/uncle in a robbery, a guilt-ridden Peter is later driven to use his abilities to atone for his partial responsibility in his uncle&#x27;s murder, as the costumed vigilante Spider-Man. Now equipped with a responsibility to do good and help others under his Spider-Man alter-ego, Peter struggles to balance high school life and studies, his job as a web designer for the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;, his relationship with his girlfriend Mary-Jane Watson, his family life with his widowed aunt, and his double life as Spider-Man, as he faces off against both superhuman and criminal threats to his home of New York City and contends with the hostility of the general public and the police authorities.

&quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; first saw print in 2000 under veteran Spider-Man artist Mark Bagley and writer Brian Michael Bendis, who expanded the original 11-page origin story into a 180-page, seven-issue story arc. This duo continued to collaborate until issue #111, when Mark Bagley left the book and was replaced by Stuart Immonen.

The series was an unexpected commercial success, selling roughly 20 million copies worldwide and received critical acclaim from readers and critics, with specific praise to Bendis’s writing, Bagley&#x27;s and Immonen&#x27;s artwork, and the updated re-imagining of the classic Spider-Man mythos. Bendis and Bagley&#x27;s run on &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; set the record for the longest continual run on a Marvel Comics series by two people, an honor previously held by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby on &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. After issue #133, the series was relaunched, still written by Bendis with art by David Lafuente, though this relaunch was short-lived. It resumed the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; title with issue #3 and continued with the original numbering with the 16th issue (#150) before the series was again cancelled with #160. It relaunched as &quot;Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man&quot; and features Miles Morales and a new artist named Sara Pichelli. The direct edition of &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #1 is a highly sought after comic book and considered to be one of the most valuable comic books of the Modern Age. The &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; branding would later be re-used in 2024 for a new unrelated comic book series set on Earth-6160, written by Jonathan Hickman and drawn by Marco Checchetto.

==History==
===Creation and development===

&quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; was the first series to be published in the Ultimate Marvel line. Publisher Bill Jemas wanted to re-invent the Marvel Universe because he felt that, with over 40 years of backstory, it had become inaccessible to new readers, and he wanted to start with a re-invented Spider-Man. Initially, Marvel Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada was skeptical because 1998&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man: Chapter One&quot;, a previous attempt at re-envisioning Spider-Man&#x27;s early adventures, had failed both critically and commercially.

Though Spider-Man&#x27;s original origin story in &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 was only 11 pages long, Bendis&#x27; retelling of Spider-Man&#x27;s origin was seven issues long. Bagley was at first wary of Bendis&#x27; notoriously slow pace in advancing plot, describing it as a &quot;real shock&quot; at first. Jemas originally intended the comic to feature single-issue stories only, but Bendis chose to make each story roughly six issues long.

The first several issues were greeted with enthusiasm from fans and critics, sold well, and gave Ultimate Marvel a boost in credibility. After the release of &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; (along with &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;), Quesada and Jemas broadened the Ultimate Marvel line with &quot;The Ultimates&quot; (a re-imagining of the Avengers) and &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot;. &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #1 was voted the &quot;ninth-greatest Marvel Comic of All Time&quot; in 2001 by readers of &quot;Wizard: The Guide to Comics&quot;. In addition to critical success, &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; grew to outsell the flagship Spider-Man title, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. Bendis would later describe issue #13, in which Peter tells Mary Jane his secret identity, as his favorite issue because it showed the trust that the Marvel editorial staff had in him.

As the series progressed within the next two years, reception and sales stayed strong, helped by the fact that Bendis and Bagley quickly found chemistry and enjoyed working together. Over the years, many &#x27;mainstream&#x27; characters were introduced, often with different origins, costumes, and/or personalities.

Mark Bagley left the book as of &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #110 in August 2006. Bagley and writer Brian Michael Bendis had worked on the series together since it began. Artist Stuart Immonen, already familiar with the Ultimate Universe from his work on &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot; and &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;, took over after Bagley. Issue #111, named &quot;The Talk&quot;, featured Immonen&#x27;s art for the first time. The issue was divided into two parts, with Bagley covering the art for one section, and Immonen doing the other. Issue #133 was the final issue of the series before a two-issue follow-up entitled &quot;Ultimatum: Spider-Man Requiem&quot; was released, revealing the status of the title&#x27;s characters after the events of the &quot;Ultimatum&quot; storyline. Despite the book&#x27;s apparent cancellation, in August 2009 &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; was relaunched with Brian Michael Bendis returning as writer and David Lafuente as artist. The book finished its run with #160 and subsequently was relaunched as &quot;Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man&quot; with art by Sara Pichelli.

===Story arcs, issue numbering, and collected editions===

The renumbering for Vol 2 #16/#150 was confusing to many readers. The letter page for Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man (2011) #8 mentions that issue 0.5 (1/2) was included in the total.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
* Peter Parker / Spider-Man – A shy, withdrawn and academically-gifted high school student, who lives in Forest Hills, Queens, New York City, with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May Parker, who is 15 years old and was orphaned when he was a child, after his parents were killed in a plane crash. Bookish, introverted, quiet and reserved, Peter was a lonely outcast among his high school peers, but was a good-humoured, bright and well-meaning young man, with a keen scientific intellect and was the brightest student in his class. On a science field trip to Oscorp Industries, a mutated spider exposed to the drug OZ, bites Peter in his hand. Instead of dying as expected, Peter begins to manifest various superhuman, arachnid-like powers, such as super-strength, speed, agility, stamina, reflexes and durability, along with the ability to crawl solid surfaces and a precognitive sixth sense, which detects and warns him of unseen danger. During a fight at his school, Peter blocks a punch from Flash Thompson, and this thrust of the punch accidentally breaks Flash&#x27;s hand. He earns money to pay off the resulting medical bill by wrestling professionally in a red-blue costume provided by the wrestling promoters, until he was later fired from wrestling, due to being suspected of robbing the wrestling promoters&#x27; money. On his way home, Peter crosses a market. While he walks through, an armed burglar runs toward him from the market, having robbed a nearby store. When faced with the choice of stopping the armed robber or not, a spiteful Peter refuses to stop him and ignores the robber, since he was still angry from being fired from his wrestling job. The burglar later kills his Uncle Ben in an attempted home invasion. Wracked with guilt, he managed to apprehend his uncle&#x27;s killer. Driven by his uncle&#x27;s motto that &quot;with great power comes great responsibility&quot;, he modifies his wrestling costume and decides to use his powers under the name &quot;Spider-Man&quot; to do good and help others in a bid to atone for his partial responsibility in his uncle&#x27;s death. He manages to complete his father&#x27;s research on adhesives, creating a formula used to create artificial spider webbing and utilizes the formula, as a crime-fighting tool, through the use of special wrist-worn mechanical devices called &quot;web-shooters&quot;, which fire out strands of the artificial webbing. As he struggles from his innate guilt over his role in his uncle&#x27;s death, Peter tries to balance studies, a job, a girlfriend, his family life with Aunt May and his dual life as the super-human vigilante Spider-Man, which more often than not, proves to be very difficult for him and in which he manages to barely succeed. Peter is killed in &#x27;The Death of Spider-Man&#x27; storyline, in a battle against the Green Goblin, although he is later revealed to have survived his death, thanks to his immortality, as the result of the same OZ compound that gave him his powers in the first place. Many years after the second Secret War is over where the Ultimate Universe is one of the few universes that has been restored, Peter returned to the role of Spider-Man, and is a member of the Ultimates.
* Mary Jane Watson – Peter&#x27;s girlfriend and next-door neighbor. She is the first person Peter reveals his secret identity to, and the one who often fixes his costume and treats his injuries. Although Peter and Mary Jane love each other, Peter&#x27;s life as Spider-Man is often a burden on their relationship. She was once transformed into the Demogoblin after being kidnapped from her bedroom by a facially disfigured clone of Peter Parker, who is determined to give her powers so that she is no longer in danger from his enemies. He pumps in her bloodstream an unquantified amount of OZ, the drug responsible for the creation of the Green Goblin, the Hobgoblin and also Spider-Man. Upon learning this, she becomes very angry and transforms into a huge, hairy, horned, red goblin-type creature. When the real Peter Parker and Spider-Woman show up, she calms down and resumes her original form, just in time for Peter (her ex) to render his evil clone unconscious. MJ is taken to the Fantastic Four&#x27;s Baxter Building and when she wakes up, she is afraid and angry, causing another transformation. When she spots the Peter clone who was in the building, she calms down once again and reverts to her normal self. She is then given by Reed Richards what is believed to be a cure to the effects of the OZ formula, yet the ordeal has left her badly traumatized, and she is shown to be affected by panic issues and haunted by the scarred visage of Peter&#x27;s disfigured clone.
* May Parker – Peter&#x27;s independent aunt, who is in her 50s working as a secretary and regularly sees a therapist to deal with the death of her husband Ben. May used to hate Spider-Man because she believed he had no regard for innocent bystanders and hid his face behind a mask. In &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #99, she learns Peter&#x27;s secret identity, something that initially makes her angry, but after some time she accepts it. Aunt May seems to be scared of the idea of Peter risking his life on a constant basis, but supports him anyway. After the death of her nephew, she and Gwen Stacy emigrate to France. Writer Brian Michael Bendis based his depiction of Aunt May on his mother.
* Gwen Stacy – A street-wise girl who befriends Peter and Mary Jane. Mark Bagley&#x27;s rendition of Ultimate Gwen Stacy was inspired by an early-career Madonna. Mary Jane is initially jealous of Gwen for the time she spends with Peter, but Gwen ultimately reveals that she loves Peter only as a surrogate brother. Her father is NYPD Captain John Stacy. He is killed by a criminal in a Spider-Man suit, and she blames the real Spider-Man for his death because he became someone criminals could copy in order to hide their identities. Aunt May opens her and Peter&#x27;s home to Gwen after her mother refuses to take her. While living with the Parkers, Gwen is killed by Carnage, which instills in Peter even more guilt. In &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #98, Gwen Stacy appears again mysteriously, alive and well, and in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #100, she is revealed, in a hideous twist of fate, to be the new Carnage, her mind having been preserved within the symbiote before getting a new clone body. In &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #128, the Carnage symbiote is absorbed back into Venom (Eddie Brock) and an examination of Gwen by Tony Stark reveals that Gwen is a &#x27;molecular copy&#x27; and is the real Gwen come back to life rather than being a simple clone. The examination also reveals no trace of the symbiote.
* Harry Osborn – The troubled son of Norman Osborn, who is Peter&#x27;s best friend and one of the few friends he ever had in school, who helps him out from being picked on by the school bullies and has known him since they were children. Having witnessed the accident that turned his father into the Green Goblin, he was trained by a psychiatrist to repress these memories. Disturbed by recurring images of his past, Harry develops hallucinations of a man named Shaw, who serves as Harry&#x27;s guide to avenge his father&#x27;s downfall. After being exposed to the OZ formula during his father&#x27;s first transformation accident at Oscorp a few months prior, Harry becomes the Hobgoblin during a verbal confrontation with Peter, turning his skin orange with the ability to produce fire. After reverting to his regular form, Harry is detained by S.H.I.E.L.D, much to the dismay of Peter. As the Hobgoblin, his powers are similar to the Green Goblin&#x27;s. When he first transformed, he was much larger than his father&#x27;s original form; when he returns in issue #116 he is much smaller. He is seemingly murdered by his father in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #117. However, as revealed by a revived Green Goblin that the OZ makes him and Spider-Man immortal, it is possible that Harry might be alive somewhere.
* Liz Allan – Mary Jane&#x27;s best friend. For the majority of the series, she is mutant-phobic. It was recently revealed that she herself is a mutant due to her mother being impregnated by the Blob. She eventually becomes Firestar. Shortly after that, Peter revealed to Liz that he was Spider-Man.
* Fred &quot;Flash&quot; Thompson – A bully who torments Peter Parker, and apparently had a crush on Gwen Stacy. He was the last of the recurring characters to discover Peter&#x27;s identity as Spider-Man (after his death).
* Kenny &quot;Kong&quot; McFarlane – A former bully of Peter, who now has an on-and-off friendship with him. Initially a big fan of Spider-Man, Kong eventually figured out that Peter is secretly Spider-Man. Although he dated Kitty Pryde for a short period, they have ostensibly broken up. Kong has not been seen for a number of issues and may have moved out to the Midwest.
* Kitty Pryde – A member of the X-Men who dates Peter after he breaks up with Mary Jane. As her identity is public, Kitty wears a green and yellow masked costume when she fights alongside Spider-Man to avoid giving away his identity. Their relationship is hard, as they live quite far away from each other. Their relationship is silently torn apart when Kitty sees Peter kissing Mary Jane. In &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #106, at the end of the issue, Kitty turns up as the new student at Midtown High, following her leaving the Xavier Institute in the wake of Professor Xavier&#x27;s death. Despite her breakup with Peter, she still retains strong feelings for him. After Peter&#x27;s death, Kitty leaves with Bobby Drake (the Iceman) and Johnny Storm (the Human Torch) to join Karen Grant (Jean Grey) in her new X-Men group.
* Johnny Storm / Human Torch – A member of the Fantastic Four and Susan Storm&#x27;s younger brother. After the events of the Ultimatum wave, he moves in with Peter Parker. He also dyes his hair black to avoid exposing his secret identity.
* Bobby Drake / Iceman – The youngest founding member of the X-Men who had the ability to form ice around him. After the events of the Ultimatum wave, Bobby Drake is kicked out of his home for being a mutant. With nowhere else to go, Kitty suggests to Peter Parkers&#x27; Aunt May that he move in with her, Peter, Gwen Stacy, and Johnny Storm (who also recently moved in their household). Aunt May agrees and enrolls Bobby at Midtown High under the guise of Bobby Parker, one of Peters&#x27; cousins and shaves his hair off to help keep his, Peter&#x27;s and Johnny&#x27;s secret identities safe.
* J. Jonah Jameson – The editor-in-chief of the Daily Bugle, who hates Spider-Man and runs a smear campaign against him, which stems from the death of his son John a year prior to Spider-Man&#x27;s existence. His most important employees are his right-hand man Robbie Robertson, and his best reporter Ben Urich whose articles helped to take down the Kingpin. Other members include Peter Parker working as a freelance photographer and web designer (who unbeknownst to Jameson is actually Spider-Man), Betty Brant, who works as one of the main secretaries, and Ned Leeds, also working as a reporter.
* Nick Fury – The tough, powerful, and connected head of S.H.I.E.L.D., who wants Peter to join the Ultimates when he is an adult. In &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #27, he tells Peter that he becomes the property of S.H.I.E.L.D. when he turns 18 whether he likes it or not, but later replies that he will work with the Ultimates when that happens. It is unknown whether Fury will hold on to his promise, as the Ultimates have broken off from S.H.I.E.L.D. At the end of the &quot;Hobgoblin&quot; arc, he personally told one of his subordinates that he wanted everything figured out about OZ, and after witnessing him angrily responding to Harry becoming the Hobgoblin, Fury says &quot;I think it&#x27;s about time Peter Parker loses those Spider powers&quot;. During the &quot;Ultimate Clone Saga&quot;, it is revealed that Fury had the Tinkerer create the Spider Slayers that were created to &#x27;handle&#x27; Peter if he lost it. After the &quot;Ultimate Clone Saga&quot;, Nick Fury has become more supportive of Peter. However, in &quot;Ultimate Power&quot;, he was taken to another universe, removing him from Peter Parker&#x27;s universe. He later returned during the events of &quot;Ultimatum&quot;, to finish off Magneto with the help of the X-Men.
* Ben Parker – Peter&#x27;s kindly, understanding and avuncular uncle/father-figure, who is closely bonded with his nephew and along with his wife: May Parker, raised Peter like his own son and tries to teach him to be a good person, while also encouraging his academic pursuits and his rapport with Mary Jane. He is later killed by an armed robber early on in the series, which serves as a constant source of guilt and torment for Peter, due to his partial role in his uncle&#x27;s murder, but not before he imparts Peter with the motto that &quot;with great power comes great responsibility&quot;, which inspires Peter to use his powers for the greater good and to undertake his Spider-Man vigilante alter-ego.
* Richard Parker – Peter&#x27;s late father. A brilliant biochemist, he was selected to be part of Nick Fury&#x27;s team to redevelop Captain America&#x27;s lost Super-Soldier Serum. He and Mary were injured in a related lab accident when Peter was an infant, which led to his adamant refusal to allow his and Edward Brock Sr.&#x27;s anti-cancer super-suit to be weaponized by Trask Industries later in life. It was during the legal battle with Trask when Richard, Mary, Edward Brock, Sr. and Edward&#x27;s wife died in a plane crash. Recently, Richard resurfaced; allegedly back from the dead, claiming he did not get on the plane because he did not want involvement in the Venom (anti-cancer) project anymore. Since that time, he has been working as an underground scientist for the CIA to combat Nick Fury when and if he one day got out of control. After Gwen Stacy returns to the Parker&#x27;s old house, he reappears to try to clear everything up. In &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #103, Sue Storm tests Richard&#x27;s DNA to confirm that he is really an aged clone of Peter. He is last seen in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #104 aging more rapidly and dying. Before he died from old age, &quot;Richard&quot; requested Sue Storm and the rest of the Fantastic Four to look after Peter. The real Richard Parker is still deceased. Richard was also the source of Spider-Man&#x27;s &quot;web fluid&quot;. Before his death, Richard was working on a &quot;molecular adhesive&quot;. Peter finished the formula after becoming Spider-Man and uses it to fight crime (see Powers and abilities).
* Mary Parker – May Parker&#x27;s sister-in-law, and Peter&#x27;s mother. She died in the plane crash with her husband while Peter was a child.
* Dr. Curt Connors – A professor at Empire State University who sponsors Eddie Brock&#x27;s Venom project. He tries to re-grow the arm he lost in the Vietnam War with lizard DNA, accidentally becoming the Lizard. Using a sample of Peter&#x27;s blood, he inadvertently creates Carnage, which resulted in the deaths of many people. Connors later turns himself in to the police afterward for his creation of Carnage.
* Jessica Drew / Spider-Woman – A female clone of Peter Parker. In &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #98, while investigating Mary Jane Watson&#x27;s disappearance, Spider-Man encounters a mysterious masked woman who knocks him unconscious. The character is able to shoot organic webbing out of her fingertips, without the need of web-shooters. During a panel discussion at the New York Comic Con 2006, writer Brian Michael Bendis mentioned that the Ultimate version of Spider-Woman would make an appearance during the &quot;Ultimate Clone Saga&quot;, which ran in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #97 – 104. In &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #102, she rescues Peter from being arrested, and reveals that she is Peter&#x27;s female clone, called Jessica Drew, but still retained all of his memories. She leads Peter to an Oscorp building in an effort to find MJ, where they end up finding the truth about Peter&#x27;s clones. Jessica also discovers, much to her disgust, that her creator is none other than Otto Octavius. Together, they manage to defeat him. However, whereas Peter is ready to turn himself in to Nick Fury, Jessica promptly leaves to escape incarceration. Peter eventually finds her again, who tells him she has finally decided to embrace her Jessica Drew identity. After Peter updates her on MJ, Nick Fury, and Aunt May, and she gives him &quot;the most awkward hug in the history of the planet&quot;. In &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #129, she made her public debut as a superhero. At the conclusion of the Ultimate Doom story arc, she enlists in S.H.I.E.L.D. as an agent.
* Felicia Hardy / Black Cat – A cat burglar who blames her father&#x27;s death on the Kingpin. Taking revenge, she steals a priceless artifact that he was going to use on his comatose wife. Hardy is interested in Spider-Man romantically, but in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #85, when she sees that he is a 15-year-old boy, she vomits on his costume out of embarrassment.
* Jean DeWolff – A captain in the NYPD. She offers support and comfort to Spider-Man whenever the strain of being a crime-fighter becomes too much for him. She was secretly working for the Kingpin, and was rumored to have been his lover as well. Punisher killed her in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man Annual&quot; #2.

===Villains===
* Norman Osborn / Green Goblin – The unscrupulous CEO of Oscorp, an industrialist and scientist and the arch-enemy of Spider-Man. He develops an experimental drug called &quot;OZ&quot;. After witnessing Peter&#x27;s spider bite and seeing the resulting effects that OZ has on him, Osborn injects OZ into his body, and is changed into an insane, powerful, green-skinned monster. He has a physical structure similar to the Hulk&#x27;s and has the ability to generate fireball projectiles from his hands. He is a scientific genius, especially in genetics. He knows Peter&#x27;s secret identity, and uses that against him on several occasions. He is killed by Carol Danvers after he requested it, due to feelings of guilt over killing his own son, but is later revealed that he survived, and that neither Danvers nor S.H.I.E.L.D ever figured out a way to actually kill him after that. He eventually escapes and breaks out the Sinister Six for one final vengeful assault on Peter Parker&#x27;s home, which ends with both he and Peter killing each other. This seems to be one of the first (if not the first) version of him where he does not wear a costume, but his body is actually mutated into a monster to be the Green Goblin. He is responsible for the death of Spider-Man in the Ultimate universe, prior to his revival. Like Spider-Man, the Green Goblin&#x27;s OZ also gives him immortality. Brian Michael Bendis instructed artist Mark Bagley to pattern Osborn&#x27;s appearance after that of actor Brian Dennehy.
* Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus – One of Osborn&#x27;s scientists and an industrial spy. He is described as &quot;scary smart&quot; by Harry. The four cybernetic arms he uses to manipulate hazardous matter were permanently melded to his flesh in the explosion that turns Osborn into the Green Goblin. He has been shown to have good fighting abilities, and once even managed to capture Spider-Man. In &quot;Hollywood&quot;, he says that all he wanted was &quot;a decent life&quot;. In the same story, he captures, unmasks, humiliates and tortures Peter for recent defeats and for ruining his life. During the &quot;Ultimate Clone Saga&quot;, Doctor Octavius reveals that he played a huge role in the creation of the clones. Also during the saga, he reveals that he in fact controls metal, similar to Magneto, and does not need actual &quot;arms&quot;, but he has become good at using his mechanical &quot;arms&quot;. Octavius was murdered by Norman Osborn in the &quot;Death of Spider-Man&quot; story arc, because Octavius had decided that he no longer bore a grudge against Peter nor wished to continue being a criminal, and tried to back out as well as asking Norman to do the same and give up his vendetta.
* Eddie Brock / Venom – A childhood friend of Peter Parker who goes to college and works as a lab assistant for Dr. Connors. Their late fathers were lab partners who were at the second stage of developing a genetically created &quot;suit&quot; designed as a cure for terminal malady, meant to bond to the user and protect them from internal and external harm. The suit is tailored for a specific DNA, and the person to whom it belongs can control the suit more easily. If, however, someone uses a suit designed for somebody else, they are constantly damaged by the suit which requires nourishment, gained by feeding on organic flesh, to function. If bonded to an incompatible host, the Venom suit begins consuming them almost immediately, forcing them to feed to sustain it or die themselves. When taking a host, the organic matter that comprises the suit completely envelops the host, regardless of resistance, temporarily blinding it, before encasing itself in a hard, purple casing, similar to a pupa, as it bonds further with the host. When the host emerges, the suit then shifts its appearance and function to assist its host, such as creating eyes for it to see through, or tries to take it over, inducing a homicidal rage and attempting to feed itself if bonded with an incompatible host. When bonded with a host and forcibly removed, the Venom suit leaves trace amounts of itself in their bloodstream, which attracts other samples of Venom to itself, and can overload Peter&#x27;s spider-sense. In the 2005 video game adaptation, it is revealed that absorbing the trace amounts in Peter&#x27;s blood allowed Eddie to take complete control of the suit, gaining a greater ability to talk and a spider symbol on his chest. He was captured by the Beetle and delivered to Latveria, after which he has a cameo in &quot;The Ultimates 3&quot; attacking the team. The whole &quot;Ultimates 3&quot; and &quot;Ultimatum&quot; scenarios, including Venom&#x27;s attack on the Ultimates, has all been orchestrated by Doctor Doom.
* Wilson Fisk / Kingpin – The head of New York organized crime. Fisk&#x27;s wife is in a coma. He carried on an affair with police officer Jeanne De Wolfe, who he used to control Spider-Man. He knows Spider-Man is a teenager, but he does not know his name. The Kingpin was later murdered by Mysterio.
* Max Dillon / Electro – One of the Kingpin&#x27;s hit men. Dillon gained his powers from a genetic tampering experiment orchestrated by Justin Hammer. During his final battle against Peter Parker, Electro was shot in the chest by May Parker, defending her nephew, and causing Electro to short out. He survived and fought Miles Morales twice.
* Flint Marko / Sandman – A ruthless criminal who gained the power to turn his body into a malleable sand-like material when he underwent a genetic tampering experiment which was orchestrated by Justin Hammer.
* Sergei Kravinoff / Kraven the Hunter – The Russian-Australian host of an action reality show. He wants to kill Spider-Man to boost his ratings. After his defeat, he briefly tampers with his DNA that enables him to assume a gruesome animalistc-like appearance.
* Herman Shultz / Shocker – A common criminal who wears devices on his hands that shoot sonic vibrations. He has no fighting skills and is nothing more than an annoyance to Spider-Man, whom he has fought against on at least five separate occasions. In &quot;The Worst Day Of Peter Parker&#x27;s Life&quot;, however, he manages to capture Spider-Man. He unmasks Peter and tortures him until Peter is saved by M.J. and Kitty.
* Alex O&#x27; Hirn / R.H.I.N.O. – A man wearing an impenetrable armor who has appeared several times to battle both Spider-Man and Iron Man, causing a lot of damage in the process.
* Blackie Drago / Vulture – A disgruntled former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who has been hired by the Tinkerer. Drago&#x27;s mission is to kill Donald Roxxon. Brian Michael Bendis instructed Mark Bagley to pattern the Vulture&#x27;s appearance after that of actor Jason Statham.
* Mysterio – A mysterious magician who can create special effects and illusions with his advanced technology. It was later revealed that this Mysterio was an android sent by the Earth-616 Mysterio to subjugate the Ultimate Universe.
* Carnage – A vampiric organism created when Dr. Curt Connors experiments on his own blood, Peter&#x27;s blood, and some of the material from the creation of Venom. Needing to feed on others constantly to repair his damaged DNA, he kills Gwen Stacy. In &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #100, an over-stressed Gwen Stacy clone transforms into Carnage when she panics. It is later revealed that this Carnage was cloned by Ben Reilly and Doctor Octopus as part of a government super-soldier program and later escaped after awakening prematurely. In the &quot;War of the Symbiotes&quot; arc, Venom absorbs the Carnage symbiote, leaving a completely human Gwen Stacy. This Carnage was referred to as &#x27;the Stacy Project&#x27;.
* Enforcers – A group of three henchmen that includes whip-wielding &quot;Montana&quot; Bale, strongman Bruno &quot;Ox&quot; Sanchez and gunslinger &quot;Fancy Dan&quot; Crenshaw. Their secondary leader after Kingpin was Mr. Big, who was scheming to overthrow him by using Spider-Man as a secret weapon. When the plan backfired and Kingpin discovered that Mr. Big was responsible for Spider-Man&#x27;s assault on his office, he crushed the mobster&#x27;s head while having him wear Spider-Man&#x27;s mask (which was removed from Peter after he was knocked unconscious and thrown out a window during the assault the night before). Another Frederick Foswell also exists in the Ultimate Universe. His name is seen on a byline in &quot;The Daily Bugle&quot; in a published story on the death of Spider-Man.
* Elektra – The Kingpin&#x27;s right-hand assassin. She later ended up in a coma when Moon Knight threw one of his crescent blades at her, embedding it in the back of her head when she was about to kill Black Cat. She was then thrown out a window by Black Cat and landed on a police car, but was mentioned by Jean DeWolff to have survived.
* Silver Sablinova / Silver Sable – A trained mercenary who leads a group called the Wild Pack. Sable had a troubled childhood, ignored by her father and abused by her alcoholic mother. Her father hunted Nazis and she forgave him at his deathbed and decided to follow in his footsteps. She has fought Spider-Man when hired by Roxxon, and manages to capture and unmask him for Roxxon.
* Beetle – An agent of the Latverians who was sent to New York City to retrieve a symbiote sample from Roxxon who debuted in the &quot;War of the Symbiotes&quot; storyline. During and before his theft, he was approached by Spider-Man. At first, the Beetle tried to avoid having to fight him. Ultimately, Spider-Man&#x27;s interference foiled the Beetle&#x27;s theft by inadvertently causing him to drop the symbiote sample, and making it worthless to retrieve.
* Elijah Stern / Tinkerer – A mechanic who used the Vulture, Killer Shrike, and Omega Red to attack his former employer Donald Roxxon. Brian Michael Bendis instructed Mark Bagley to pattern the Tinkerer&#x27;s appearance after that of actor Paul Giamatti.
* Deadpool – A disfigured cyborg and anti-mutant extremist who hunts mutants for sport on a reality TV show, at one point capturing the X-Men and Spider-Man. While this version of Deadpool appears in the 2010 video game &quot;Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions&quot; in the Ultimate Universe, that version acts like the Deadpool from the main Marvel Universe. It is unknown if Ultimate Deadpool can break the 4th wall like his main universe counterpart.
* Kaine Parker#Ultimate Marvel – A flawed clone of Peter Parker, amongst many others created by Doctor Octopus after being liberated from jail to secretly produce super-soldiers for the CIA and FBI. Needing a superhuman genetic template for his experiments, Octavius delighted in using Parker&#x27;s DNA to desecrate the life of his foe. Kaine was mentally unstable, possessed a disfigured face, a sightless eye, and incomplete skin development. Believing himself to be the true Spider-Man, he kidnapped Parker&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson, and took her to the abandoned Oscorp lab in New Jersey. Thinking he would enable her to defend herself from super-powered threats, he exposed her to the mutagenic &quot;Oz&quot; formula he obtained from Dr. Octopus. He is later killed during the end of the &quot;Ultimate Clone Saga&quot; by Nick Fury&#x27;s Spider Slayers while trying to protect Mary Jane from being taken into S.H.E.I.L.D. custody.
* Arkady Gregorivich Rossovich / Omega Red – A mutant with a hatred for humans. He at some point became a hired thug and was hired to attack a cargo boat belonging to Roxxon Industries in a conspiracy against the head of the company, Donald Roxxon. After his fight with Spider-Man at Roxxon industries he was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D., but escaped when the Green Goblin caused a mass prison break.
* Ringer – appeared, but ended up defeated by both Spider-Man and Shadowcat. He was handed over to the police. He would not again appear until the 150th issue where Spider-Man is fighting him after he stole $11,000 worth of diamonds. During the battle, the two caused millions of dollars in damages. Spider-Man beats him and he is again taken off to jail. He later appears attempting to rob a bank, until stopped by the new Spider-Man.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Before &quot;Spider-Man: The New Animated Series&quot; became a loose continuation of Sam Raimi&#x27;s 2002 &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film, the series was originally going to be a direct adaptation of the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; comics. Brian Michael Bendis also worked as a producer on the series.
* &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; animated series took many elements from the Ultimate comics, such as Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy, Harry Osborn, and Mary Jane Watson remaining as teenagers in high school during the majority of the series, the introduction of Kenny McFarlane into animated medium, Eddie Brock&#x27;s personal relationship with Peter while working as a lab assistant for Dr. Curt Connors at Empire State University, Rhino&#x27;s real name being Alex O&#x27;Hirn, Dr. Octavius working as an Oscorp scientist until his electromagnetic accident, both Spider-Man and later Eddie bonding with the Symbiote being kept in a secured lab, Venom&#x27;s body being more monstrous in both size and shape, and Kraven the Hunter having his own DNA by Miles Warren which transformed him into a black-maned lion-like creature with elements of leopard and cheetah DNA.
* An unrelated animated series of the same name aired in the United States on Disney XD from April 2012 to January 2017. The four-part episode &quot;The Spider-Verse&quot; also featured a variation of the show&#x27;s Ultimate universe, which confirmed that Ultimate Peter Parker had died fighting an unspecified threat while his mantle was long since taken up by a guilt-ridden Miles Morales. This series&#x27; Peter Parker is modeled after his appearance in the comics. Also in this series, Harry Osborn is the host for Venom instead of Eddie Brock and takes the form of Spider-Man&#x27;s black suit, as Spider-Man&#x27;s suit does not bond with the symbiote.
* In the 2017 Spider-Man series, there was also a season one episode with the same name and that this show&#x27;s Kraven the Hunter had TV show-hosting traits of his Ultimate Marvel version.

* Sam Raimi&#x27;s 2002 &quot;Spider-Man &quot; film uses many elements from the Ultimate comics, such as Peter Parker going to high school with Harry Osborn and Mary Jane Watson (who much like her Ultimate counterpart remains indecisive about dating Harry at first and lives with her abusive father and depressed mother), Peter being bitten by a genetically-altered spider during a school field trip, Norman Osborn working on developing a serum to create super soldiers and later injecting himself with the same serum to become Green Goblin (albeit only as an alternate personality and not a complete transformation), Flash Thompson fighting Peter for humiliating him at school, Peter letting a burglar escape after a bad experience from participating in a wrestling exhibit using his powers, Green Goblin threatening to drop Mary Jane from the Queensboro Bridge as opposed to Gwen Stacy in the mainstream universe, and Green Goblin&#x27;s obsession with Spider-Man at wanting to form an alliance.
* The 2004 sequel &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, also adapts similar ideas from the Ultimate comics, such as Peter Parker not being in a relationship with Mary Jane Watson due to his responsibilities as Spider-Man (though the only difference being that he hasn&#x27;t confessed his identity to her by that point), and Dr. Octavius working on behalf of Oscorp to fund his experiments, who also has a wife named Roselita (Rosie for short in the film). Doc Ock also sports a brown trench coat, which he wore for some issues in the Ultimate comics. In addition, an unused concept from earlier versions of the film&#x27;s script reveal that Dr. Octavius is the creator of one of the genetically-altered spiders from the first film, and at one point also provides Peter with an antidote should he ever consider removing his own powers.
* The 2007 sequel &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; uses minor elements from the Ultimate comics Venom arc, such as Spider-Man&#x27;s anger being fueled by the death of his Uncle Ben while wearing the Black Suit, Mary Jane&#x27;s jealousy over Peter spending time with Gwen Stacy, Eddie Brock being much like his Ultimate incarnation, who loves Gwen and expects to always lead a successful life while trying to get into relationships too quickly, and Venom&#x27;s apparent death within an explosion being similar to Ultimate Venom&#x27;s defeat after accidentally being electrocuted. Furthermore, an alternate climax scene that was filmed but ultimately cut from the film featured Eddie seemingly dying after the Symbiote drains the life out of his body from being permanently bonded for too long, which could also serve as an homage to Ultimate Venom.
* Marc Webb&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; adapts several elements and aesthetics from the Ultimate comics, such as Peter Parker&#x27;s personality, being bitten by a genetically-altered spider at Oscorp, Flash Thompson being a basketball player over football, Peter furiously leaving from a conversation with his Uncle Ben about his father and the importance of responsibility, Peter letting a thief steal from a convenience store, Gwen and Peter dating during high school with her even defending Peter from Flash albeit non-violently and Lizard and Police Captain George Stacy being visually inspired by their Ultimate incarnations.
* The 2014 sequel &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot; once again adapts several elements from the Ultimate comics, such as Richard Parker being a scientist working on a cure for diseases and Peter discovering old recordings of his father that explain why he had to leave Peter at a very young age, fearing that his research will fall into the wrong hands. Harry Osborn and friendship with Peter was borrowed from the one shared between Ultimate Peter and Eddie Brock Jr. His transformation in the Green Goblin is similar to his father in the Ultimate comics (with the Cross-Species spider venom being inspired by the OZ serum), and Electro and Rhino are modeled after their Ultimate incarnations.
* The 2017 Marvel Studios film &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; adapts several elements from the Ultimate comics, such as a more conventionally youthful Peter Parker and Aunt May, Tony Stark playing the role of Parker&#x27;s mentor where here it extends to a father-son figure relationship while wearing an armor similar to his Ultimate incarnation, Flash initially not being a fan of Spider-Man but rather curious about the hero, Ned Leeds being inspired by the Ultimate comics character Ganke Lee, and Miles Morales&#x27; uncle Aaron Davis&#x27; being involved in illegal activities. The bank robbery scene featuring criminals wearing plastic masks of the Avengers members is based on one of the panels of issue #42 (titled &quot;Temptations) of the Ultimate comics. A building in the background of one of the film&#x27;s scenes has graffiti with the name Bagley written on it, referencing Mark Bagley, the penciller for the first 111 issues of the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; comics.
* In the 2018 film &quot;&quot;, Peter is killed at the mere age of 16, much like his Ultimate Comics counterpart despite drastically different circumstances.
* In the 2019 film &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot;, Peter and Nick Fury&#x27;s interactions are inspired by their relationship from the Ultimate Comics, although Fury is a lot less warmer to Peter unlike in the comics. A twist in the post-credits revealed that this Nick Fury was actually Talos the Untamed in disguise.
* In the 2021 film &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot;, The Raimiverse&#x27;s Sandman has a completely different form similar to his Ultimate counterpart due to being covered in sand. The Webbverse&#x27;s Electro stays in his Ultimate form from &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot; until he gets a different source of power during a fight MCU Spider-Man and Sandman due to being in the MCU.

====Animation====
* A version of the Ultimate universe appears as the setting in the 2018 Sony animated film &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot;. Unlike the comics, the film&#x27;s version of Ultimate Peter Parker is blond, lived into his mid &#x27;20s, married Mary Jane Watson, and licensed his likeness to merchandising to provide funds for his superheroics, allowing him to build an underground lair beneath his house to fashion tools and spare costumes. The rest of the movie is loosely inspired by Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man. Peter Parker is not explicitly killed by Green Goblin, but Green Goblin is a pivotal part of the showdown that leads up to his death. Miles purchases a Spider-Man Halloween costume like in the comics, but it is not given to him by Ganke (who plays an overtly minor role but still appears and is Miles’ roommate). Ganke is also a fan of Spider-Man like in the comics. Miles creates his own suit which loosely resembles his red-and-black one, but it is given to him by Aunt May instead of S.H.I.E.L.D. Aunt May plays a role similar to the comics and also gives Miles his web shooters. Prowler is in his Aaron Davis incarnation and has a relationship with Miles adapted directly from the comics. Jefferson and Rio Morales are very similar to their comic appearances, though Jefferson does not resemble his comic incarnation physically. Kingpin does not play a role in the Miles Morales comics, but has his personality adapted from the Learning Curve storyline of the original comics. Scorpion is Latino like the Ultimate comics version, but also has weaponry similar to that of his original incarnation. Green Goblin heavily resembles his Ultimate incarnation, but borrows some elements from his original and MC2 incarnations.
** In the 2023 sequel &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot;, a band poster referencing the first issue of &quot;Ultimate Fallout&quot;, under which Gwen Stacy is mostly positioned, can be seen in her room while she speaks with her father in the beginning.

===Video games===
* A video game adaptation also titled &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; was released in 2005 for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS, and Game Boy Advance. The game serves as a non-canon continuation of the Venom storyline, with an original story and cutscenes also provided by Ultimate comics creators Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley. The game&#x27;s plot would eventually be loosely recreated during issues #123-128 of the &quot;War of the Symbiotes&quot; arc in the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; comics.
* In &quot;&quot; Venom has his Ultimate universe costume.
* A handheld prequel to the 2005 &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; game titled &quot;Spider-Man: Battle for New York&quot;, was released in 2006 for the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance. The game features an alternate retelling of Ultimate Spider-Man&#x27;s first encounter with Green Goblin and features both as playable characters.
* A mobile game loosely based on the Ultimate comics titled &quot;Spider-Man: Toxic City&quot; was released in 2009.
* Ultimate Peter Parker/Spider-Man appears as a playable character in &quot;Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions&quot;, voiced by Josh Keaton. In the game, Madame Web grants him his symbiote costume and uses her telepathic powers to keep it from taking over so he can retrieve fragments of the Tablet of Order and Chaos from his universe&#x27;s versions of Electro, Deadpool, and Carnage more effectively. This section is not included in the Nintendo DS version.
* Another mobile game loosely based on the Ultimate comics titled &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man: Total Mayhem&quot;, was released in 2011.
* The Ultimate incarnation of Venom appears as a playable character in the 2013 game &quot;Lego Marvel Super Heroes&quot;.
* Minor elements of the Ultimate comics were incorporated into the 2018 &quot;Spider-Man&quot; game, such as Peter Parker, Mary Jane Watson, and Harry Osborn having known each other since childhood and Spider-Man and Kingpin&#x27;s long standing enmity, with the former trying to take down the latter ever since he became the superhero and Mary Jane&#x27;s job as a reporter, an idea that was inspired by Ultimate MJ&#x27;s aspirations to become a reporter. The follow-up game &quot;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&quot; is also visually inspired by the Ultimate universe and the main storyline incorporates Tinkerer&#x27;s vendetta due to a family tragedy against Roxxon Energy Corporation, an organisation that plays a significant role in the Ultimate comics.
* &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2&quot; the 2023 video game also uses elements from Ultimate comics, such as Peter Parker having a similar hairstyle to his Ultimate counterpart during his high school years with Harry Osborn. The Venom symbiote is also used as a cure to heal the world from any disease or illness and Peter losing control over the Venom Suit.

===Attractions===
* An interactive attraction based on the Ultimate and mainstream Marvel universes was built in Niagara Falls as part of Marvel Superhero Adventure City. The ride has guests help Spider-Man stop different villains by shooting them with lasers. Spider-Man&#x27;s look is based on his Ultimate version, but he is more experienced like his mainstream Marvel counterpart.

<text>Charles Lewis Tiffany (February 15, 1812 – February 18, 1902) was an American businessman and jeweler who founded New York City&#x27;s Tiffany &amp; Co. in 1837. Known for his jewelry expertise, Tiffany created the country&#x27;s first retail catalog and introduced the English standard of sterling silver in imported jewelry in 1851.

==Biography==
Tiffany was born on February 15, 1812, in Killingly, Connecticut, the son of Chloe (Draper) and Comfort Tiffany. Tiffany was educated at a district school and an academy in Plainfield, Connecticut. Starting at the age of fifteen, he helped manage a small general store founded by his father, the owner of a cotton-manufacturing company. He later worked at the office of his father&#x27;s mill. The Tiffany family descended from the immigrant Squire Humphrey Tiffany (England, 1630 – Swansea, Massachusetts, 1685), who had lived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony since 1660.

In 1837, with $1,000 borrowed from his father, Tiffany and a school friend, John B. Young, set up a small stationery and gift shop in New York City. Their first day in business brought only $4.98 in sales, but two years later they were still in business, selling glassware, porcelain, cutlery, clocks, and jewelry. The store expanded in 1841, when the owners changed its name to Tiffany, Young, and Ellis. The store established a reputation for selling only the finest goods and specialized in Bohemian glass and porcelain. It also began manufacturing its own jewelry. Tiffany pioneered several retail innovations, including the introduction of the first retail catalog in the United States in 1845, known as the Blue Book, which is considered the first direct-mail catalog to bring fine jewelry to American doorsteps. In 1848, when political unrest in Europe depreciated the market in precious stones, Tiffany invested heavily in diamonds, which were sold at a great profit a few years later.

In 1851, Tiffany played a key role in adopting the English standard of sterling silver in the United States, making Tiffany &amp; Co. the first American firm to use the British silver standard of 92.5% purity. This standard later became the benchmark for the U.S. Sterling Standard. 

In 1853, the company was reorganized under the name Tiffany and Company, and opened branches in Paris (1850) and London (1868). The store also relocated uptown to a Fifth Avenue site in that decade. At the beginning of the American Civil War, foreseeing that the jewelry business would suffer, Tiffany turned most of his capital to the manufacture of swords, medals, and other war materials.

Charles Lewis Tiffany is credited with introducing the six-prong &quot;Tiffany Setting&quot; engagement ring in 1886, designed to enhance the visibility and brilliance of the diamond. He also introduced the &quot;Tiffany Blue Box,&quot; which became widely recognized as a symbol of the company. He served a diverse clientele that included U.S. presidents such as Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy, as well as prominent American families.

Tiffany was publicly embarrassed in an 1872 diamond and gemstone hoax perpetrated by Philip Arnold that cost investors more than half a million dollars.

As Broadway shows became more popular, Tiffany collaborated with Thomas Edison on footlights and other devices for theater lighting.

The firm acquired and sold some of the French Crown Jewels in 1887, solidifying its reputation as merchants of high quality.

Charles Tiffany died at his home in Manhattan on February 18, 1902, at age ninety. At the time of his death, his company was capitalized at more than $2 million and was acknowledged as the most prominent jewelry company in North America.

==Personal life==
On November 30, 1841, Tiffany married John B. Young&#x27;s sister, Harriet Olivia Avery Young (1817–1897), with whom he had six children: Charles Lewis Tiffany Jr. (1842–1847), Annie Olivia Tiffany Mitchell (1844–1937; grandmother of Hiram Bingham IV through her daughter Alfreda Mitchell; she was the first wife of Hiram Bingham III, one of the first explorers to Machu Picchu, Peru), Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848–1933), Louise Harriet Tiffany (1856–1937), Henry Charles Tiffany (1858–1859), and Burnett Young Tiffany (1860–1945).

Tiffany was a patron of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and one of the founders of the New York Society of Fine Arts.

==Honors==
Tiffany was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1878.

<text>Leonid Alekseyevich Kulik (Russian: Леонид Алексеевич Кулик; 19 August 1883 – 14 or 24 April 1942) was a Soviet mineralogist who is noted for his research into meteorites.
==Russo-Japanese War and World War I==
He was born in Dorpat, (now Tartu, Tartu County, Estonia), and was educated at the Imperial Forestry Institute in Saint Petersburg and the Kazan University. He served in the Russian military during the Russo-Japanese War, then spent some time in jail for revolutionary political activities. He then served with the Russian military during World War I.
==Mineralogy teacher==

Following the war he became an instructor, teaching mineralogy in Tomsk. In 1920 he was offered a job at the Mineralogical Museum in St. Petersburg.
==Investigation of the Tunguska event==
In 1927, he led the first Soviet research expedition to investigate the Tunguska event, the largest impact event in recorded history, which had occurred on 30 June 1908. He made a reconnaissance trip to the region, accompanied by Nikolay Ivanovich Fedorov and others, and interviewed local witnesses. He circled the region where the trees had been felled and became convinced that they were all turned with their roots to the center. However he did not find any meteorite fragments from the impact.

==World War II service and death==
During World War II he again fought for his country, this time in a paramilitary militia. He was captured by the German army and died in a prisoner of war camp of typhus.

<text>Helmuth Otto Ludwig Weidling (2 November 1891 – 17 November 1955) was a German three-star general during the Second World War. He was the last commander of the Berlin Defence Area during the Battle of Berlin, led the defence of the city against Soviet forces and finally surrendered just before the end of World War II in Europe.

==Military career==
Born in Halberstadt in 1891, Weidling entered the military in 1911 and served as a lieutenant in the First World War. He remained in the reduced army of the Weimar Republic after the war. As an artillery officer, he took part in the invasion of Poland and the Battle of France and during the early stages of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. 

In January 1942, still on the Eastern Front, Weidling was appointed commander of the 86th Infantry Division.

===Corps commander===
On 15 October 1943, Weidling became the commander of the XLI Panzer Corps, a position he held until 10 April 1945 with a short break in his command from 19 June 1944 to 1 July 1944. During this break, Generalleutnant Edmund Hoffmeister took over during the first stages of Soviet Operation Bagration. Hoffmeister was in command when most of the German 9th Army, along with the XLI Panzer Corps, was encircled during the Bobruysk Offensive.

While Weidling was in command, XLI Panzer Corps was responsible for an atrocity committed by the Wehrmacht in the Soviet Union during the war. Up to 50,000 civilians were deliberately infected with typhus, and placed in a &quot;typhus camp&quot; in the area of Parichi, Belorussia, in the path of oncoming Red Army forces, in the hopes that would cause a massive outbreak of typhus among the Red Army soldiers. That was noted by the commander of the 65th Soviet Army, General Pavel Batov, months later when it found itself facing the same corps in the Battle of Berlin.

The XLI Panzer Corps was rebuilt as part of the German 4th Army. The 4th Army, under the command of General Friedrich Hoßbach, was given the task of holding the borders of East Prussia. On 10 April 1945, Weidling was relieved of his command. He was thereafter appointed as commander of the LVI Panzer Corps.

The LVI Panzer Corps was part of Gotthard Heinrici&#x27;s Army Group Vistula. As commander of that corps, Weidling began his involvement with the Battle of Berlin. 

On 16 April 1945, Weidling prepared to take part in the Battle of the Seelow Heights, which was part of the broader Battle of the Oder-Neisse. Weidling&#x27;s LVI Panzer Corps was in the centre, flanked by the CI Army Corps to his left and the XI SS Panzer Corps to his right. All three corps were part of General Theodor Busse&#x27;s 9th Army, which was defending the heights above the River Oder. While all three corps were in generally good defensive positions, they were conspicuously short of tanks. Weidling&#x27;s commander, Heinrici, recognised the shortage earlier in the day, as Hitler had ordered the transfer of three panzer divisions from Army Group Vistula to the command of recently promoted Field Marshal Ferdinand Schörner. 

During the middle of the Battle of Berlin, the leader of the Hitler Youth, Artur Axmann, visited Weidling&#x27;s headquarters and told him that the youngsters of the Hitler Youth were ready to fight and were even now manning the roads in the 56th rear. Weidling argued it was futile for the teenage boys to be thrown into the battle. He told Axmann that it was &quot;the sacrifice of children for an already doomed cause&quot;. Axmann did not withdraw them from the battle.

By 19 April, with Schörner&#x27;s Army Group Centre collapsing, Weidling&#x27;s corps was forced to retreat west into Berlin. The German forces&#x27;s retreat from Seelow Heights during the 19th and 20th left no front line remaining.

===Commander of the Berlin Defence Area===
On 22 April, Hitler ordered for Weidling to be executed by firing squad on receiving a report that he had retreated in the face of advancing Soviet Army forces, which was in defiance of standing orders to the contrary. Weidling had not actually retreated, and the sentence was called off after he appeared at the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; to clear up the misunderstanding.

On 23 April, Hitler appointed Weidling as the commander of the Berlin Defence Area. Weidling replaced Lieutenant General (&quot;Generalleutnant&quot;) Helmuth Reymann, Colonel (&quot;Oberst&quot;) Ernst Kaether, and Hitler himself. Reymann had held the position only since March.

The forces available to Weidling for the city&#x27;s defence included roughly 45,000 soldiers in several severely-depleted German Army and Waffen-SS divisions. These divisions were supplemented by the police force, boys in the compulsory Hitler Youth, and 40,000 men of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; (militia). The commander of the central government district was SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Wilhelm Mohnke. Mohnke had been appointed to his position by Hitler and had over 2,000 men under his direct command. His core group were the 800 men of the &quot;Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler&quot; (LSSAH) SS battalion (assigned to guard Hitler). The Soviet command later estimated the number of defenders in Berlin at 180,000, but that was based on the number of German prisoners that they captured. The prisoners included many unarmed men in uniform, such as railway officials and members of the Reich Labour Service (&quot;Reichsarbeitsdienst&quot;).

Weidling organised the defences into eight sectors designated &quot;A&quot; through to &quot;H&quot;. Each sector was commanded by a colonel or a general, but most of the colonels and generals had no combat experience. To the west of the city was the &quot;20th Panzergrenadier&quot; Division. To the north was the &quot;9th Fallschirmjäger&quot; Division, to the north-east the Panzer Division &quot;Müncheberg&quot;. To the south-east of the city and to the east of Tempelhof Airport was the SS-&quot;Nordland Panzergrenadier&quot; Division composed mainly of foreign volunteers. Weidling&#x27;s reserve, the &quot;18th Panzergrenadier&quot; Division was in Berlin&#x27;s central district.

====Bendlerblock headquarters====
Sometime around 26 April, Weidling chose as his base of operations the old army headquarters on the Bendlerstrasse, the Bendlerblock. The location had well-equipped air-raid shelters and was close to the Reich Chancellery. In the depths of the Bendlerblock, Weidling&#x27;s staff did not know whether it was day or night.

Around noon on 26 April, Weidling relieved Colonel Hans-Oscar Wöhlermann of command, and Major General Werner Mummert was reinstated as commander of the &quot;Müncheberg&quot; Panzer Division. Later that evening, Weidling presented Hitler with a detailed proposal for a breakout from Berlin. When Weidling finished, Hitler shook his head and said: &quot;Your proposal is perfectly all right. But what is the point of it all? I have no intentions of wandering around in the woods. I am staying here and I will fall at the head of my troops. You, for your part, will carry on with your defence.&quot;

By the end of the day on 27 April, the encirclement of Berlin had been completed. The Soviet Information Bureau announced that Soviet troops of the 1st Belorussian Front had broken through strong German defences around Berlin and, approaching from the east and from the south, had linked up in Berlin and northwest of Potsdam and that the troops of the 1st Belorussian Front took Gartenstadt, Siemenstadt and the Goerlitzer Railway Station in eastern Berlin. 

When Weidling discovered that a major part of the last line of the German defences in Berlin were manned by Hitler Youth, he ordered Artur Axmann to disband the Hitler Youth combat formations in the city. However, in the confusion, his order was never carried out.

====Soviet advance====
On 29 April, the Soviet Information Bureau announced that troops of the 1st Belorussian Front continued to clear the streets of Berlin, occupied the northwest sector of Charlottenburg as far as Bismarck Street, the west half of Moabit, and the eastern part of Schoeneberg. Soviet troops of the 1st Ukrainian Front occupied Friedenau and Grunewald in north and west Berlin.

During the evening of 29 April, Weidling&#x27;s headquarters in the Bendlerblock was now within metres of the front line. Weidling discussed with his divisional commanders the possibility of breaking out to the southwest to link up with General Walther Wenck&#x27;s 12th Army. Wenck&#x27;s spearhead had reached the village of Ferch on the banks of the Schwielowsee near Potsdam. The breakout was planned to start the next night at 22:00.

On 30 April, the Soviet Information Bureau announced that Soviet troops of the 1st Belorussian Front had captured Moabit, Anhalter Railway Station, Joachimsthal to the north of Berlin, and Neukölln, Marienwerder and Liebenwalde. Troops of the 1st Ukrainian Front occupied the southern part of Wilmersdorf, Hohenzollerndamm and Halensee Railway Station.

====The &quot;Führerbunker&quot;====
Late in the morning of 30 April, with the Soviets less than 500 m from the bunker, Hitler had a meeting with Weidling, who informed him that the Berlin garrison would probably run out of ammunition that night. Weidling asked Hitler for permission to break out, a request that he had earlier made unsuccessfully. Hitler did not answer at first, and Weidling went back to his headquarters in the Bendlerblock, where at about 13:00, he received Hitler&#x27;s permission to try a breakout that night.

After Hitler and Braun&#x27;s suicides, Weidling reached the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; and was met by Joseph Goebbels, &quot;Reichsleiter&quot; Martin Bormann and General Hans Krebs. They took him to Hitler&#x27;s room, where the couple had committed suicide. They told him that their bodies had been burned and buried in a shell crater in the Reich Chancellery garden above. Weidling was forced to swear that he would not repeat this news to anybody. The only person in the outside world who was to be informed was Joseph Stalin. An attempt would be made that night to arrange an armistice, and General Krebs would inform the Soviet commander so that he could inform the Kremlin.

Weidling soon rang Colonel Hans Refior, his civil chief-of-staff, in the Bendlerblock headquarters soon afterward. Weidling said that he could not tell him what had happened, but he needed various members of his staff to join him immediately, including Colonel Theodor von Dufving, his military chief-of-staff.

The meeting on 1 May between Krebs, who had been sent by Goebbels, and Soviet Lieutenant General Vasily Chuikov ended with no agreement. According to Hitler&#x27;s personal secretary Traudl Junge, Krebs returned to the bunker complex looking &quot;worn out, exhausted&quot;. The surrender of Berlin was thus delayed until Goebbels committed suicide, after which it was then left up to Weidling to negotiate with the Soviets.

===Surrender to Chuikov===

On 2 May, Weidling had his Chief-of-Staff, Theodor von Dufving, arrange a meeting with Chuikov. Weidling told the Soviets about the suicides of Hitler and Goebbels, and Chuikov demanded complete capitulation.

Pursuant to Chuikov and Vasily Sokolovsky&#x27;s direction, Weidling put his surrender order in writing. The document, written by Weidling, read as follows:

The meeting between Weidling and Chuikov ended at 8:23 am on 2 May 1945.

==Post-war==
The Soviet forces took Weidling into custody and flew him to the Soviet Union. Initially, he was held in the Butyrka and Lefortovo Prisons in Moscow. On 27 February 1952, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union sentenced him to 25 years&#x27; imprisonment for war crimes committed in the occupied Soviet Union. Weidling died on 17 November 1955 in the custody of the KGB in Vladimir of an apparent heart attack. He was buried in an unmarked grave at the prison cemetery. On 16 April 1996, the Chief Military Prosecutor&#x27;s Office of the Russian Federation declared Weidling non-rehabilitative.

<text>The Combined Scottish Universities was a three-member university constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1918 until 1950. It was created by merging the single-member constituencies of Glasgow and Aberdeen Universities and Edinburgh and St Andrews Universities.

==Boundaries==
The constituency was not a physical area but was rather elected by the graduates of the Scottish Universities of St Andrews, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen.

The constituency returned three Members of Parliament to Westminster, elected by Single Transferable Vote. The by-elections used the first past the post voting system.

This University constituency was created by the Representation of the People Act 1918 and abolished in 1950 by the Representation of the People Act 1948.

<text>Abies pinsapo, Spanish fir, is a species of tree in the family Pinaceae, native to southern Spain and northern Morocco. Related to other species of Mediterranean firs, it appears at altitudes of in the Sierra de Grazalema in the Province of Cádiz and the Sierra de las Nieves and Sierra Bermeja, both near Ronda in the province of Málaga. In Morocco, it is limited to the Rif Mountains at altitudes of on Jebel Tissouka and Jebel Tazaot.

==Description==
&quot;Abies pinsapo&quot; is an evergreen conifer growing to 20–30 m tall, with a conic crown, sometimes becoming irregular with age. The leaves are 1.5–2 cm long, arranged radially all round the shoots, and are strongly glaucous pale blue-green, with broad bands of whitish wax on both sides. The cones are cylindrical, measuring 9–18  cm long. They are greenish-pink to purple before maturity, and smooth surfaces, with short bract scales that do not protrude. When mature, they disintegrate to release the winged seeds.

The Moroccan variety, Abies pinsapo&quot; var. &quot;marocana or the Moroccan fir, differs in the leaves being less strongly glaucous and the cones slightly longer, 11–20 cm long.

The cultivars &quot;A. pinsapo&quot; &#x27;Aurea&#x27; (to 8m, with golden new growth)
and &quot;A. pinsapo&quot; &#x27;Glauca&#x27; (to 12m plus, with grey-green leaves)
have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Conservation==
Spanish fir, despite the best conservation and reforestation efforts that have greatly increased its abundance, still has several threats such as fires, urban projects, erosion, excessive visitors and tourists, etc.

<text>Charles Williamson Flusser (September 27, 1832 – April 19, 1864) was an officer in the United States Navy during the American Civil War.

==Biography==
Born at Annapolis, Maryland, Flusser entered the United States Naval Academy in 1847 and graduated with the Class of 1853 with the rank of passed midshipman. He received promotion to master and then lieutenant on September 15 and 16, 1855, while serving in the South American Squadron. In early 1861, Flusser was appointed to the Naval Academy in Annapolis, and oversaw its relocation to Fort Adams in Newport, Rhode Island.

Flusser served on blockade duty off the coast of Georgia in late 1861, before being appointed commander of the gunboat for the Burnside Expedition, taking part in the victory at the Battle of Elizabeth City in February 1862.

Flusser was promoted to lieutenant commander in July 1862, also assuming command of all Union gunboats in Albemarle Sound. He took part in the expedition against Franklin, Virginia, in October 1862, with his ship only narrowly escaping capture.

Flusser was killed in action on April 19, 1864, during the Battle of Plymouth, commanding the Union naval forces present. In the engagement between the and against the Confederate ironclad . In that action, Flusser personally fired a cannon shell at the Confederate ironclad. The shell, with a 10-second fuse, bounced off the &quot;Albemarle&#x27;s&quot; armor and landed back on the deck of the &quot;Miami&quot;, where its explosion killed him. Brigadier General Henry W. Wessells, commanding the garrison at Plymouth, North Carolina, noted: &quot;In the death of this accomplished sailor the Navy has lost one of its brightest ornaments...&quot;

Flusser was interred at the military cemetery in New Bern, but in 1868 his remains were transferred to the Naval Academy Cemetery.

==Namesakes==
Four United States Navy ships have been named in his honor.

<doc id="1192943" wikidata="Q3977950" url="?curid=1192943" title="Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane">
<text>Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane is an American comic book series published monthly by DC Comics. The series focusing on the adventures of Lois Lane began publication with a March/April 1958 cover date and ended its run in September/October 1974, with 137 regular issues and two 80-page Annuals. Following the similar themed &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot;, &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend Lois Lane&quot; was the second comic series based on a Superman supporting character.

At the peak of its popularity in 1962, &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot; was the third best-selling comic book in the United States, surpassed only by &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Superboy&quot; in sales.

==Publication history==
Following a tryout in &quot;Showcase&quot;, DC decided to give Lois Lane her own ongoing series. The comic series focus on Lois&#x27; solo adventures, and sometimes with stories centered on Lois&#x27; romantic interest in Superman and her attempts to maneuver him into marriage, only to fail due to a comic plot twist. In the early 1960s, Lana Lang made regular guest appearances, generally as Lois&#x27; romantic rival. Artist Kurt Schaffenberger drew most of the stories for the first 81 issues of the series, missing only issue #29. Schaffenberger&#x27;s rendition of Lois Lane became cited by many as the &quot;definitive&quot; version of the character. Singer Pat Boone appeared in issue #9 (May 1959) before starring in his own comic book series. &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Paw&quot;, a story from issue #42 (July 1963), featured a one-panel appearance, with his costume miscolored, by the defunct Fawcett Comics&#x27; Captain Marvel, who was not yet a DC character. The letters page of #113 (October 1971) described it as &quot;strictly a private joke&quot; on the part of former Captain Marvel artist Schaffenberger. The story was reprinted in #104 (October 1970) with the costume coloring corrected. The Catwoman made her first Silver Age appearance in #70 (November 1966). In issue #80 (January 1968), Lois&#x27; fashions were updated to a more contemporary look.

By the 1970s, the stories began to reflect growing social awareness: Lois became less fixated on romance and more on current issues. In the controversial story &quot;I Am Curious (Black)!&quot; in #106 (November 1970), Lois uses a machine that allows her to experience racism firsthand as an African American woman. The series saw the debut of the Silver Age heroine &quot;Rose &amp; The Thorn&quot; in a backup feature that ran from #105 (October 1970) through #130 (April 1973). Editor E. Nelson Bridwell had several characters and plot concepts from Jack Kirby&#x27;s &quot;Fourth World&quot; appear in issues #111–119 (July 1971 – February 1972). Lois&#x27; sister, Lucy Lane, was believed to have died in issue #120 (March 1972) but the character was later revived.

In 1974, the title ended, as &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot; had earlier that year. Both would be merged into &quot;The Superman Family&quot;, which chronologically continued from the elder title, premiering with issue #164 (April–May 1974). The release of the last issue of &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot; was delayed for several months due to a nationwide paper shortage.

Both of these books remain in print. The word vorticity was invented by Lamb in 1916.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Lamb was born in Stockport, Cheshire, the son of John Lamb and his wife Elizabeth, &quot;née&quot; Rangeley. John Lamb was a foreman in a cotton mill who had gained some distinction by the invention of an improvement to spinning machines, he died when his son was a child. Lamb&#x27;s mother married again, and soon afterwards Horace went to live with his strict maternal aunt, Mrs. Holland. He studied at Stockport Grammar School, where he made the acquaintance of a wise and kindly headmaster in the Rev. Charles Hamilton, and a graduate of classics, Frederic Slaney Poole, who in his final year became a good friend. It was from these two tutors that Lamb acquired his interest in mathematics and, to a somewhat lesser extent, classical literature.

In 1867, he gained a classical scholarship at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge. Since Lamb&#x27;s inclination, however, was to pursue a career in engineering, he chose to decline the offer, and instead worked for a year at the Owens College in nearby Manchester, as a means of developing his mathematical proficiency further.

At that time, the Chair of Pure Mathematics at Owens College was held by Thomas Barker, an eminent Scottish mathematician, who graduated as Senior Wrangler and first Smith&#x27;s prizeman from the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos in 1862. An acknowledged lecturer of high quality, Lamb prospered under the guidance of Barker, and was elected to a minor scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge.

At Trinity, he was Second Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos, 2nd Smith&#x27;s prizeman and elected fellow in 1872. Among his professors were James Clerk Maxwell and George Gabriel Stokes. He was soon elected both a Fellow and a tutor in the college.

===University of Cambridge, 1872–75===
By 1874, Lamb had become thoroughly invested in his work at Trinity, preparing there an innovative and original series of lectures on the subject of hydrodynamics for third-year students. Richard Glazebrook, a final-year student at the time, wrote of them that they were &#x27;a revelation&#x27;, and praised Lamb for his lucid presentation of the properties of liquids in rotational motion. However, Lamb soon became romantically involved with Elizabeth Foot, sister-in-law to his former headmaster, and, since the conditions of his position at Trinity stipulated that he should hold it only so long as he was unmarried, he was compelled, in 1875, to resign and continue his work elsewhere.

===University of Adelaide, 1876–1885===
Lamb&#x27;s acquaintance from Stockport, Frederic Slaney Poole, had by now for some years lived in South Australia; hearing of his engagement, Poole suggested in a letter that he should apply for the chair at the recently founded University of Adelaide. In 1875, he was appointed the first (Sir Thomas) Elder Professor of Mathematics there, and took up the chair in March, 1876. Lamb was instrumental in the establishment of the academic and administrative structure of the university, and lectured in pure and applied mathematics, also giving practical demonstrations in physics. For the next ten years the average number of students enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts course at Adelaide was fewer than twelve; though Lamb also gave some public lectures in the evenings, his workload was relatively light. His deftly rendered and original &quot;A Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of the Motions of Fluids&quot; (which would later be reprinted as &quot;Hydrodynamics&quot; in 1895) was first published in 1878.

In 1883, Lamb published a paper in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot; applying Maxwell&#x27;s equations to the problem of oscillatory current flow in spherical conductors, an early examination of what was later to be known as the skin effect. Lamb was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1884.

===University of Manchester, 1885–1920===

Lamb was appointed to the Chair of Mathematics at Owens College, Manchester, in 1885 and which became the Beyer Chair in 1888, a position Lamb held until retirement in 1920 (Owens College was merged with the Victoria University of Manchester in 1904). His &quot;Hydrodynamics&quot; appeared in 1895 (6th ed. 1933), and other works included &quot;An Elementary Course of Infinitesimal Calculus&quot; (1897, 3rd ed. 1919), &quot;Propagation of Tremors over the Surface of an Elastic Solid&quot; (1904), &quot;The Dynamical Theory of Sound&quot; (1910, 2nd ed. 1925), &quot;Statics&quot; (1912, 3rd ed. 1928), &quot;Dynamics&quot; (1914), &quot;Higher Mechanics&quot; (1920) and &quot;The Evolution of Mathematical Physics&quot; (1924).

===Later years, 1920–1934===

In 1932 Lamb, in an address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, wittily expressed on the difficulty of explaining and studying turbulence in fluids.
He reportedly said, &quot;I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former I am rather optimistic.&quot;

Lamb is also known for description of special waves in thin solid layers. These are now known as Lamb waves.

==Family==
Lamb married Elizabeth Foot (1845−1930), his former headmaster&#x27;s sister-in-law, in 1875 and had seven children, including the classicist Walter Lamb, the painter Henry Lamb and the archaeologist Dorothy Lamb. His son Ernest, a professor of engineering at Queen Mary College in London, was the father of the climatologist Hubert Lamb and the grandfather of the Liberal Democrat politician Norman Lamb.

Lamb died in 1934 and was buried at the Ascension Parish Burial Ground in Cambridge, with his wife.

==Honours and awards==
Lamb was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1884, was twice vice-president, received its Royal Medal in 1902 and, its highest honour, the Copley Medal in 1924. He was president of the London Mathematical Society 1902–1904, president of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, and president of the British Association in 1925. He was knighted in 1931. A room in the Alan Turing Building at the University of Manchester is named in his honour and in 2013 the Sir Horace Lamb Chair was created at Manchester. A building at the University of Adelaide also bears his name.

<doc id="1192945" wikidata="Q267209" url="?curid=1192945" title="Martín Luis Guzmán">
<text>Martín Luis Guzmán Franco (October 6, 1887 – December 22, 1976) was a Mexican novelist and journalist. Along with Mariano Azuela and Nellie Campobello, he is considered a pioneer of the revolutionary novel, a genre inspired by the experiences of the Mexican Revolution of 1910. He spent periods in exile in the United States and Spain. He founded newspapers, weekly magazines, and publishing companies. In 1958, he was awarded Mexico&#x27;s National Prize in Literature.

==Life==
Guzmán was born in Chihuahua, Chihuahua, the son of a colonel in the Federal Army, who was attached to the Mexican consulate in Phoenix, Arizona. His father was killed in one of the early skirmishes of the Mexican Revolution and Guzmán left for Mexico City.

For several months in 1914, he was under the direct orders of General Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa, later writing a five-volume biography of Villa, &quot;Memorias de Pancho Villa&quot; (1936-1951). On Villa&#x27;s orders, Guzmán witnessed the entry of Venustiano Carranza&#x27;s Constitutionalist Army to Mexico City, following the fall of Victoriano Huerta&#x27;s government in July 1914. Carranza had him jailed, since as an adherent of Villa, formerly a Constitutionalist general who had broken with Carranza, Guzmán was a political enemy. He was released during the factional dispute between the Constitutionalists and the Army of the Convention, led by Villa. Guzmán went abroad to Paris and Madrid in 1914, where he began writing articles for the Spanish weekly magazine, &quot;España&quot;, founded by José Ortega y Gasset and became part of the circle of Spanish intellectuals. His first published work, &quot;La querella de México&quot;, his assessment of Mexico&#x27;s problems and limitations. Leaving Spain for the United States, he represented &quot;España&quot; and taught a short course at University of Minnesota, returning to Mexico briefly, where he worked at Mexican newspapers. Following the ouster of Carranza in 1920 by Sonoran generals Alvaro Obregón, Plutarco Elías Calles, and Adolfo de la Huerta, Guzmán returned to Mexico and became the private secretary to Alberto J. Pani, President Obregón&#x27;s minister of foreign affairs. Guzmán was involved in the 1921 centenary of the achievement of Mexico&#x27;s independence. He subsequently ran afoul of Obregón&#x27;s government when Obregon sought to impose Calles as his successor. Guzmán backed Adolfo de la Huerta&#x27;s 1923 unsuccessful rebellion against Obregón and Calles, and was forced into exile to Spain for a decade, becoming a Spanish citizen. He again became involved in journalism, but his largest contribution to writing was his work of revolutionary fiction, &quot;El águila y la serpiente&quot;. With the presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas (1934–40), who had turned against his political patron Calles, Guzmán was invited to return to Mexico, where he returned to journalism and began writing &quot;Memorias de Pancho Villa&quot;.

Martin Luis Guzmán was a public figure in Mexico, serving as a senator from 1969 to 1976. He died suddenly on December 22, 1976 in Mexico City due an acute myocardial infarction. His widow Ana West died seven years after him, on October 21, 1983. She was 95 years old when, after being hospitalized for some days due to an acute bilateral pneumonia, she suffered a cardiac arrest and died.

==Works==
His novels &quot;La sombra del caudillo&quot; (1929) and &quot;El águila y la serpiente&quot; (1928) depict the Mexican Revolution and its political aftermath, with both of which the author was familiar, having contributed both to revolutionary agitation and to the formation of the new revolutionary government.

<text>The Colorado Trail is a long-distance trail running for from the mouth of Waterton Canyon southwest of Denver to Durango in Colorado, United States. Its highest point is above sea level, and most of the trail is above . Despite its high elevation, the trail often dips below the alpine timberline to provide refuge from the exposed, storm-prone regions above.

The Colorado Trail was built and is currently maintained by the non-profit Colorado Trail Foundation and the United States Forest Service, and was connected in 1987.

==Description==

The Colorado Trail is an established, marked, and mostly non-motorized trail open to hikers, horse riders, and bicyclists. From the eastern terminus at Waterton Canyon, southwest of Denver, the trail winds its way for through the state&#x27;s most mountainous regions, ending about north of Durango. Along the way, it passes through eight mountain ranges, six National Forests, and six wilderness areas.

Trail elevations range from a low of about at the Denver end of the trail to a high of on the slopes of Coney in the San Juan Mountains. The trail rises and falls dramatically. A hiker traversing the entire length of the trail will gain (and lose) about 89,000 vertical feet. The trail passes through what is considered to be some of the state&#x27;s most beautiful country. Wildlife abounds and wildflowers, in season, are abundant. While much of the trail passes through forests, a good portion of it reaches above timberline, where trees are unable to grow and views are breathtaking.

The trail passes through historic mining towns, along ancient Native American trails, and through a modern, world-class ski resort. Other sections appear much as they would have 500 years ago. The western half of The Colorado Trail, between Monarch Pass and Durango, has less human influence, greater vistas and a display of spectacular wildflowers.

For , The Colorado Trail runs concurrent with the Continental Divide Trail along the Collegiate East route. On the Collegiate West route, the Colorado Trail follows the Continental Divide Trail for more.
==Weather==
Summer days are warm with cool nights, but unpredictable mountain weather can threaten snow any month of the year. Violent thunder and lightning storms may ravage the afternoon sky, then quickly give way to warm sunshine and cloudless skies. The trail has a stretch of 35 miles between Spring Creek and the top of the Elk Creek drainage that is above tree line and unprotected from thunderstorms.

The practical season for the entire Colorado Trail is roughly July, August and September, though low elevation portions near Denver are often accessible April through June. In the winter, large parts of it are prohibitively difficult because of deep snow.

==Thru-hiking==

The majority of thru-hikers (those who hike the entire trail in one trip) hike from east to west. This choice of direction is preferred partly because snow typically melts earlier in the year on the eastern portion of the trail than on the higher western portion. In addition, the east-to-west hike allows a thru-hiker to start with more gradual elevation gains and build up to the more rugged terrain of the western portion of the trail in the San Juan Mountains.

The time required for a thru-hiker to complete the Colorado Trail varies greatly. While some supported trail runners can finish it in less than 10 days (the unsupported fastest-known time is 9 days, 8 hours and 18 minutes by Jeff Garmire), most thru-hikers spend about 4 to 6 weeks (28 to 42 days) on the trail.

==Mountain biking==

The Colorado Trail is one of the few major long trails that allow mountain biking. Mountain bikes are permitted along most of the trail, but there are six wilderness areas where it is against federal regulations even to possess a bicycle. As a whole, the trail is of interest to bicyclists from beginners on up. Top cyclists consider it to be a world-class long-distance trail.

==Colorado Trail Foundation==
The Colorado Trail Foundation, based in Golden, Colorado, is a nonprofit organization that operates and maintains the Colorado Trail. Assisted by 600 volunteers and 3,000 donors each year, the CTF maintains over 500 miles of trail. Each summer, its trail crews work for about 12 weeks and six weekends clearing trees, working on erosion controls, and maintaining signage along the trail. The trail crews work on major projects that are beyond the scope of its sister &quot;Adopt-A-Trail&quot; program. That program lets interested volunteers &quot;adopt&quot; one of 78 maintenance sections along the trail, each averaging about eight miles long.

Every summer, the CTF offers week-long supported treks on the Trail, providing hikers with guides and the services of the trekking staff.

The Foundation maintains an extensive web site with information about the trail, and publishes a series of books and trail guides for hikers.

===Governance===
The CTF is governed by a twelve-person board. There is a full-time Executive Director and one administrative staff member. Its total revenues in 2013 were just over $400,000.

==History==
The Colorado Trail was conceived in 1973 by the Roundup Riders of the Rockies, but not connected end-to-end until 1987. The Colorado Trail Foundation (CTF) evolved out of cooperative efforts by the United States Forest Service, the Colorado Mountain Trails Foundation, and individual volunteers from the Colorado Mountain Club and the Friends of the Colorado Trail. In 2005, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the CTF and Forest Service, detailing their respective roles in the future development of the trail.

<text>Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC; ; ) is a department of the Government of Canada responsible for social programs and the labour market at the federal level. The department delivers a number of federal government programs and services including Employment Insurance (EI), Service Canada centres, Canada Student Loan Program (CSLP), Canada Pension Plan (CPP), issuing social insurance numbers (SIN) and the federal Labour Program among other things.

Employment and Social Development Canada is part of the membership of the Inter-American Conference on Social Security, a technical and specialized international organization, which has the objective of promoting the development of social protection and security in America.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The Department of Human Resources and Skills Development was created in December 2003, when Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC) was split into two separate departments: Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) and Social Development Canada (SDC). Though they continued to share many common services and operations, Human Resources and Skills Development Canada was to focus on workforce-related aspects of the former HRDC portfolio, while SDC was to focus on social support programs for children, families and seniors. The split was given formal legal effect when the &quot;Department of Human Resources and Skills Development Act&quot; and the &quot;Department of Social Development Act&quot; were enacted in July 2005.

=== Recombined ===
Upon taking office in February 2006, the Conservative government of Stephen Harper announced it would recombine the two departments, and through a series of orders in council, Social Development Canada was folded into HRSDC.

From 2006 to 2008, Social Development&#x27;s preceding role was reflected by styling the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development as the &quot;Minister of Human Resources and Social Development&quot;, and by changing the department&#x27;s applied title to &quot;Human Resources and Social Development Canada&quot;. This practice ended in late 2008 when the title was changed to &quot;Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development.&quot; The post was later referred to as &quot;Minister of Employment and Social Development&quot; when the department was renamed.

On November 4, 2015, the department underwent machinery of government changes which saw the employment responsibilities transfer to the Labour Minister resulting in the newly re-titled Minister of Employment, Workforce and Labour. The Social Development aspects were then shaped into the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development. The Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion is now tasked with handling the file on persons with disabilities.

==Sub-agencies, programs and activities ==
Sub-agencies of ESDC include:
*Service Canada
**Service Canada Centres for Youth
*Canada Student Loans Program
*Canada Employment Insurance Commission
*Canada Pension Plan
*National Seniors Council
*Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program
*Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service
*Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation
*Canada Industrial Relations Board

ESDC delivers $87 billion in programs and services and has approximately 24,000 employees. Approximately 19,000 of those employees work under the Service Canada banner.

== Officials and structure ==
 Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour – Steven MacKinnon
** Deputy Minister of Employment and Social Development – Paul Thompson
** Senior Associate Deputy Minister of Employment and Social Development – Kristina Namiesniowski
** Business Lead, Benefits Delivery Modernization - John Ostrander
* Minister of Citizens&#x27; Services - Terry Beech

== Controversies ==

=== 2012/2013 privacy breach ===

On January 11, 2013, Minister Diane Finley announced that a hard drive containing information of 583,000 student loan borrowers had been lost from a Canada Student Loans Program (CSLP)/HRSDC office in Gatineau, Quebec. Borrowers who registered a loan between 2000 and 2006 were potentially affected. The information on the hard drive contained full names, social insurance numbers, contact information, and loan balances. The hard drive also contained information on 250 HRSDC employees. Concerns of privacy breaches and identity theft led to the filing of three class-action suits against the federal government on behalf of the affected students.

On January 18, 2013, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada stated that a formal investigation had been launched. The stated outcome of this investigation was to provide information to organizations and individuals to improve privacy protection.

The RCMP was notified but is waiting for the outcome of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada&#x27;s investigation to do their own investigation.

This incident has become known as &quot;1 in 60&quot;, representing the ratio of affected individuals to the Canadian population as a whole.

=== Canada Summer Jobs program ===
In 2018, the government of Justin Trudeau introduced a new mandatory criteria for eligible employers and projects of the Canada Summer Jobs program, for which &quot;the core mandate of the organization must respect individual human rights in Canada, including the values underlying the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Charter) as well as other rights&quot; like the &quot;reproductive rights and the right to be free from discrimination&quot;. After facing nine ongoing Federal Court challenges and the complaints of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops in union with the Canadian Council of Christian Charities, the requirement was rewritten and became a mandatory point for eligible projects and job activities, which must not &quot;actively work to undermine or restrict a woman&#x27;s access to sexual and reproductive health services&quot;.

<doc id="1192959" wikidata="Q1200239" url="?curid=1192959" title="Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans">
<text>Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare locally aggressive malignant cutaneous soft-tissue sarcoma. DFSP develops in the connective tissue cells in the middle layer of the skin (dermis). Estimates of the overall occurrence of DFSP in the United States are 0.8 to 4.5 cases per million persons per year. In the United States, DFSP accounts for between 1 and 6 percent of all soft-tissue sarcomas and 18 percent of all cutaneous soft-tissue sarcomas. In the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) tumor registry from 1992 through 2004, DFSP was second only to Kaposi sarcoma. 

==Presentation==
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans begins as a minor firm area of skin most commonly about to 1 to 5 cm in diameter. It can resemble a bruise, birthmark, or pimple. It is a slow-growing tumor and is usually found on the torso but can occur anywhere on the body. About 90% of DFSPs are low-grade sarcomas. About 10% are mixed, containing a high-grade sarcomatous component (DFSP-FS); therefore, they are considered to be intermediate-grade sarcomas. DFSPs rarely lead to a metastasis (fewer than 5% metastasize), but DFSPs can recur locally. DFSPs most often arise in patients who are in their thirties but this may be due to diagnostic delay.

=== Location ===
Commonly located on the chest and shoulders, the following is the site distribution of DFPS as was observed in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 2000 and 2010.

* Trunk/torso – 42%
* Lower extremity – 21%
* Upper extremity – 21%
* Head and neck – 13%
* Genitals – 1%

== Variants ==
The World Health Organization in 2020 classified the fibro sarcomatous DFSP (DFSP-FS) variant (also termed dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, fibro sarcomatous) of the dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans as a specific form of the intermediate (rarely metastasizing) fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors and other variants of this disorder as a specific form of the intermediate (locally aggressive) fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors.
=== Bednar tumors ===
Bednar, or pigmented DFSP, is distinguished by the dispersal of melanin-rich dendritic cells of the skin. It represents 1–5 percent of all DFSP occurring in people rich in melanin pigments. Bednar is characterized by a dermal spindle cell proliferation like DFSP but distinguished by the additional presence of melanocytic dendritic cells. It occurs at the same rate as DFSP on fairer skin and should be considered to have the same chances of metastasis.

=== Myxoid DFSP ===
Myxoid DFSP has areas of myxoid degeneration in the stroma.

=== Giant cell fibroblastoma ===

Giant cell fibroblastoma contains giant cells, and is also known as juvenile DFSP. Giant cell fibroblastomas are skin and soft-tissue tumors that usually arise in childhood. They are sometimes seen in association with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP, hybrid lesions) or may transform or recur as DFSP.

=== Atrophic DFSP ===
Atrophic DFSP resemble other benign lesions such as morphea, idiopathic atrophoderma, atrophic scar, anetoderma or lipoatrophy. It behaves like classic DFSP. It commonly favours young to middle-aged adults. It has a slow infiltrative growth and a high rate of local recurrence if not completely excised.

=== Sclerosing DFSP ===
Sclerosing DFSP is a variant in which the cellularity is low, and the tumor consists of uniform bundles of collagen interspersed with more typical DFSP cells.

Granular cell variant is a rare type in which spindle cells are mingled with richly granular cells, the granules being lysosomal, with prominent nucleoli.

=== Fibrosarcomatous DFSP (DFSP-FS) ===

Fibrosarcomatous DFSP is a rare variant of DFSP involving greater aggression, high rates of local occurrences, and higher metastatic potential. DFSP-FS are considered to be intermediate-grade sarcomas, although they rarely metastasize (fewer than 5 percent of cases).

==Pathophysiology==
More than 90% of DFSP tumors have the chromosomal translocation t(17;22). The translocation fuses the collagen gene (COL1A1) with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) gene. The fibroblast, the cell of origin of this tumor, expresses the fusion gene in the belief that it codes for collagen. However, the resulting fusion protein is processed into a mature platelet-derived growth factor which is a potent growth factor. Fibroblasts contain the receptor for this growth factor. Thus the cell &quot;thinks&quot; it is producing a structural protein, but it creates a self-stimulatory growth signal. The cell divides rapidly and tumor forms.

The tissue is often positive for CD34.

==Diagnosis==

DFSP is a malignant tumor diagnosed with a biopsy, when a portion of the tumor is removed for examination. In order to ensure that enough tissue is removed to make an accurate diagnosis, the initial biopsy of a suspected DFSP is usually done with a core needle or a surgical incision.

Clinical palpation is not entirely reliable for ascertaining the depth of a DFSP infiltration. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive addressing the depth of the invasion on some types of DFSP, particularly large or recurring tumors, though MRI is less accurate for identifying infiltration to head and neck tumors.

== Diagnostic delay and misdiagnosis ==
Due to the rarity, initial presentation of flat plaque (skin hardening) and the slow-growing nature of DFSP, it may be months to years without a protuberance (bump). The dissonance between the name of the neoplasm and its clinical presentations may cause a majority of patients to experience a diagnostic delay. A 2019 research study found out of 214 patients a range between less than a year to 42 years before diagnosis (median, four years) from patients noticing a symptom to diagnosis.

Currently, a majority of patients (53%) receive a misdiagnosis by health care providers. The most frequent prebiopsy clinical suspicion included cyst (101 [47.2%]), lipoma (30 [14.0%]), and scar (17 [7.9%]).

It has been suggested an alternative term for DFSP should be &quot;dermatofibrosarcoma, often protuberant.&quot;

== Pregnancy ==
It is suggested that DFSPs may enlarge more rapidly during pregnancy. Immunohistochemical stains for CD34, S-100 protein, factor XIIIa, and estrogen and progesterone receptors were performed on biopsy specimens. The tumors showed the expression of the progesterone receptor. As with many other stromal neoplasms, DFSPs appear to express low levels of hormone receptors, which may be one factor that accounts for their accelerated growth during pregnancy.

==Treatment==

Treatment is primarily surgical, with chemotherapy and radiation therapy used if clear resection margins are not acquired.

=== Surgical treatment ===
The type of surgical treatment chosen is dependent on the location of the DFSP occurrence and possible size.

==== Mohs surgery ====
Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) has a high cure rate and lowers the recurrence reduction of DFSP if negative resection margins are achieved.

==== Wide local excision ====
Wide local excision (WLE) was the gold standard for treating DFSP but is currently under reevaluation. Presently in the United States, WLE may be suggested after the recurrence of MMS. Larger resection margins are suggested for WLE than MMS. Recurrence rate with WLE is about 8.5% with a lower recurrence rate related to wider excision.

=== Resection margin ===
DFSP characteristic features are its capacity to invade surrounding tissues, to a considerable distance from the central focus of the tumor in a &quot;tentacle-like&quot; fashion. This fact, coupled with diagnostic delay, may lead to inadequate initial resection. Inadequate initial treatment results in larger, deeper recurrent lesions, but these can be managed by appropriate wide excision.

=== Radiation therapy ===
DFSP is a radioresponsive tumor; radiation therapy (RT) is not used as the first choice for treatment. Conservative resection through MMS or WLE is attempted first. If clear margins are not achieved RT, or chemotherapy is recommended.

=== Chemotherapy ===
DFSP was previously regarded and nonresponsive to standard chemotherapy. In 2006 the US FDA approved (imatinib mesylate) for the treatment of DFSP. As is true for all medicinal drugs with name ending in &quot;ib,&quot; imatinib is a small molecular pathway inhibitor; imatinib inhibits tyrosine kinase. It may be able to induce tumor regression in patients with recurrent DFSP, unresectable DFSP, or metastatic DFSP. There is clinical evidence that imatinib, which inhibits PDGF-receptors, may be effective for tumors positive for the t(17;22) translocation. It is suggested that imatinib may be a treatment for challenging, locally advanced disease and in the rare metastatic cases. It was approved for use by adult patients with unresectable, recurrent and/or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP).

== Metastatic disease ==
Distant hematogenous metastases are extremely rare. Metastases to regional lymph nodes are rarer and are most likely in patients who have had multiple local recurrences after inadequate surgical resection. Repeatedly recurring tumors have an increased risk for transformation into a more malignant form (DFSP-FS). The lungs are most frequently affected, but metastases to the brain, bone, and other soft tissues are reported.

== Studies ==
DFSP is not extensively studied due to its rarity and low mortality. The majority of studies are small size case studies or meta-analysis.

The most extensive research study to date was &quot;Perspectives of Patients With Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans on Diagnostic Delays, Surgical Outcomes, and Nonprotuberance&quot;. The lead researcher, Jerad Gardner, spoke at a TED Talk in February 2020 on the topic.

== History ==
R. W. Taylor, in 1890, first identified DFSP as a keloid sarcoma. Later in 1924, Ferdinand-Jean Darier and Ferrand identified it as a progressive recurrent dermatofibroma. In 1925, E. Hoffmann coined the term &quot;dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans&quot;. Bednar tumor was first described by Bednar in 1957.

== ICD coding ==
The following are the ICD-10 medical codes:
* ICD-0: 8832/3 – dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, NOS
* ICD-0: 8833/3 – pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans
* ICD-0: 8834/1 – giant cell fibroblastoma
* Fibrosarcomatous dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: no distinct coding identified

<doc id="1192971" wikidata="Q2891260" url="?curid=1192971" title="Wicked problem">
<text>In planning and policy, a wicked problem is a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize. It refers to an idea or problem that cannot be fixed, where there is no single solution to the problem; and &quot;wicked&quot; denotes resistance to resolution, rather than evil. Another definition is &quot;a problem whose social complexity means that it has no determinable stopping point&quot;. Moreover, because of complex interdependencies, the effort to solve one aspect of a wicked problem may reveal or create other problems. Due to their complexity, wicked problems are often characterized by organized irresponsibility.

The phrase was originally used in social planning. Its modern sense was introduced in 1967 by C. West Churchman in a guest editorial he wrote in the journal &quot;Management Science&quot;. He explains that &quot;The adjective &quot;wicked&quot; is supposed to describe the mischievous and even evil quality of these problems, where proposed &quot;solutions&quot; often turn out to be worse than the symptoms.&quot; In the editorial, he credits Horst Rittel with first describing wicked problems, though it may have been Churchman himself who coined the term. Churchman discussed the moral responsibility of operations research &quot;to inform the manager in what respect our &#x27;solutions&#x27; have failed to tame his wicked problems.&quot; Rittel and Melvin M. Webber formally described the concept of wicked problems in a 1973 treatise, contrasting &quot;wicked&quot; problems with relatively &quot;tame&quot;, solvable problems in mathematics, chess, or puzzle solving.

== Characteristics ==
Rittel and Webber&#x27;s 1973 formulation of wicked problems in social policy planning specified ten characteristics:

# There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem.
# Wicked problems have no stopping rule.
# Solutions to wicked problems are not true-or-false, but better or worse.
# There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem.
# Every solution to a wicked problem is a &quot;one-shot operation&quot;; because there is no opportunity to learn by trial and error, every attempt counts significantly.
# Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or an exhaustively describable) set of potential solutions, nor is there a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan.
# Every wicked problem is essentially unique.
# Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem.
# The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways. The choice of explanation determines the nature of the problem&#x27;s resolution.
# The social planner has no right to be wrong (i.e., planners are liable for the consequences of the actions they generate).

Conklin later generalized the concept of problem wickedness to areas other than planning and policy; Conklin&#x27;s defining characteristics are:

# The problem is not understood until after the formulation of a solution.
# Wicked problems have no stopping rule.
# Solutions to wicked problems are not right or wrong.
# Every wicked problem is essentially novel and unique.
# Every solution to a wicked problem is a &quot;one shot operation&quot;.
# Wicked problems have no given alternative solutions.

== Examples ==
Classic examples of wicked problems include economic, environmental, and political issues. A problem whose solution requires a great number of people to change their mindsets and behavior is likely to be a wicked problem. Therefore, many standard examples of wicked problems come from the areas of public planning and policy. These include global climate change, natural hazards, healthcare, the AIDS epidemic, pandemic influenza, international drug trafficking, nuclear weapons, homelessness, and social injustice.

In recent years, problems in many areas have been identified as exhibiting elements of wickedness; examples range from aspects of design decision making and knowledge management to business strategy to space debris.

== Background ==
Rittel and Webber coined the term in the context of problems of social policy, an arena in which a purely scientific-engineering approach cannot be applied because of the lack of a clear problem definition and differing perspectives of stakeholders. In their words, 

Thus wicked problems are also characterised by the following:

# The solution depends on how the problem is framed and vice versa (i.e., the problem definition depends on the solution)
# Stakeholders have radically different world views and different frames for understanding the problem.
# The constraints that the problem is subject to and the resources needed to solve it change over time.
# The problem is never solved definitively.

Although Rittel and Webber framed the concept in terms of social policy and planning, wicked problems occur in any domain involving stakeholders with differing perspectives. Recognising this, Rittel and Kunz developed a technique called Issue-Based Information System (IBIS), which facilitates documentation of the rationale behind a group decision in an objective manner.

A recurring theme in research and industry literature is the connection between wicked problems and design. Design problems are typically wicked because they are often ill-defined (no prescribed way forward), involve stakeholders with different perspectives, and have no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;optimal&quot; solution. Thus wicked problems cannot be solved by the application of standard (or known) methods; they demand creative solutions.

== Strategies to tackle wicked problems ==
Wicked problems cannot be tackled by the traditional approach in which problems are defined, analysed and solved in sequential steps. The main reason for this is that there is no clear problem definition of wicked problems. Ultimately, the solution to ‘Wicked’ problems requires additional research to understand the gaps in information pertaining these issues. Governments must invest in more evidence-informed science to address the full scope of these problems. Broader thinking into the appropriate options will allow for more innovation within this process. 

In a paper published in 2000, Nancy Roberts identified the following strategies to cope with wicked problems:

;Authoritative
:These strategies seek to tame wicked problems by vesting the responsibility for solving the problems in the hands of a few people. The reduction in the number of stakeholders reduces problem complexity, as many competing points of view are eliminated at the start. The disadvantage is that authorities and experts charged with solving the problem may not have an appreciation of all the perspectives needed to tackle the problem.
;Competitive
:These strategies attempt to solve wicked problems by pitting opposing points of view against each other, requiring parties that hold these views to come up with their preferred solutions. The advantage of this approach is that different solutions can be weighed up against each other and the best one chosen. The disadvantage is that this adversarial approach creates a confrontational environment in which knowledge sharing is discouraged. Consequently, the parties involved may not have an incentive to come up with their best possible solution.
;Collaborative
:These strategies aim to engage all stakeholders in order to find the best possible solution for all stakeholders. Typically these approaches involve meetings in which issues and ideas are discussed and a common, agreed approach is formulated. A significant advantage of this approach is the creation of a strong information sharing environment. The main problem is the risk that certain ideas, while integral to finding a possible solution, may be too controversial to accept by other involved parties. By enhancing the collaborative processes between researchers, this allows for wider coordination of roles within this research. With the inclusion of diverse perspectives into this process, it enhances the potential options and figures considered. The commitment to collaboration in addressing a Wicked problem will likely result in further understanding of the underlying factors and could enhance the means of addressing it. 

In his 1972 paper, Rittel hints at a collaborative approach; one which attempts &quot;to make those people who are being affected into participants of the planning process. They are not merely asked but actively involved in the planning process.&quot; A disadvantage of this approach is that achieving a shared understanding and commitment to solving a wicked problem is a time-consuming process. Another difficulty is that, in some matters, at least one group of people may hold an absolute belief that necessarily contradicts other absolute beliefs held by other groups. Collaboration then becomes impossible until one set of beliefs is relativized or abandoned entirely.

Research over the last two decades has shown the value of computer-assisted argumentation techniques in improving the effectiveness of cross-stakeholder communication. The technique of dialogue mapping has been used in tackling wicked problems in organizations using a collaborative approach. More recently, in a four-year study of interorganizational collaboration across public, private, and voluntary sectors, steering by government was found to perversely undermine a successful collaboration, producing an organizational crisis which led to the collapse of a national initiative.

In &quot;Wholesome Design for Wicked Problems&quot;, Robert Knapp stated that there are ways forward in dealing with wicked problems: 

Examining networks designed to tackle wicked problems in health care, such as caring for older people or reducing sexually transmitted infections, Ferlie and colleagues suggest that managed networks may be the &quot;least bad&quot; way of &quot;making wicked problems governable&quot;.

==Communication of wicked problems==
=== Problem structuring methods ===

A range of approaches called &quot;problem structuring methods&quot; (PSMs) have been developed in operations research since the 1970s to address problems involving complexity, uncertainty and conflict. PSMs are usually used by a group of people in collaboration (rather than by a solitary individual) to create a consensus about, or at least to facilitate negotiations about, what needs to change. Some widely adopted PSMs include soft systems methodology, the strategic choice approach, and strategic options development and analysis (SODA).

== Related concepts ==

=== Messes and social messes ===
Russell L. Ackoff wrote about complex problems as messes: &quot;Every problem interacts with other problems and is therefore part of a set of interrelated problems, a system of problems... I choose to call such a system a mess.&quot;

Extending Ackoff, Robert Horn says that &quot;a Social Mess is a set of interrelated problems and other messes. Complexity—systems of systems—is among the factors that makes Social Messes so resistant to analysis and, more importantly, to resolution.&quot;

According to Horn, the defining characteristics of a social mess are:
# No unique &quot;correct&quot; view of the problem;
# Different views of the problem and contradictory solutions;
# Most problems are connected to other problems;
# Data are often uncertain or missing;
# Multiple value conflicts;
# Ideological and cultural constraints;
# Political constraints;
# Economic constraints;
# Often a-logical or illogical or multi-valued thinking;
# Numerous possible intervention points;
# Consequences difficult to imagine;
# Considerable uncertainty, ambiguity;
# Great resistance to change; and,
# Problem solver(s) out of contact with the problems and potential solutions.

=== Divergent and convergent problems ===
E. F. Schumacher distinguishes between &quot;divergent and convergent problems&quot; in his book &quot;A Guide for the Perplexed&quot;. Convergent problems are those for which attempted solutions gradually converge on one solution or answer. Divergent problems are those for which different answers appear to increasingly contradict each other all the more they are elaborated, requiring a different approach involving faculties of a higher order like love and empathy.

=== Wicked problems in software development ===
In 1990, DeGrace and Stahl introduced the concept of wicked problems to software development. In the last decade, other computer scientists have pointed out that software development shares many properties with other design practices (particularly that people-, process-, and technology-problems have to be considered equally), and have incorporated Rittel&#x27;s concepts into their software design methodologies. The design and integration of complex software-defined services that use the Web (web services) can be construed as an evolution from previous models of software design, and therefore becomes a wicked problem also.

=== Super wicked problems ===

Kelly Levin, Benjamin Cashore, Graeme Auld and Steven Bernstein introduced the distinction between &quot;wicked problems&quot; and &quot;super wicked problems&quot; in a 2007 conference paper, which was followed by a 2012 journal article in &quot;Policy Sciences&quot;. In their discussion of global climate change, they define super wicked problems as having the following additional characteristics:

# There is a significant time deadline on finding the solution
# There is no central authority dedicated to finding a solution
# Those seeking to solve the problem are also causing it
# Certain policies irrationally impede future progress

While the items that define a wicked problem relate to the problem itself, the items that define a super wicked problem relate to the agent trying to solve it. Global warming is a super wicked problem, and the need to intervene to tend to our longer term interests has also been taken up by others, including Richard Lazarus.

<text>Ian Russell (born August 30, 1975) is an American soccer coach and former player. He is currently interim head coach of MLS club San Jose Earthquakes.

== Career ==
Russell attended the University of Washington on a soccer scholarship and was a three-time (1994, 1996–97) All-Mountain Pacific Sports Federation first team selection. He then played for the Seattle Sounders of the USL First Division in 1998 and 1999. He won the offensive MVP award in 1999.

=== Professional playing ===
After being drafted by the Seattle Sounders in 1998, Russell played for two seasons in the USL First Division. In 2000, Russell moved to Polish side Lech Poznań along with compatriots Jimmy Conrad and Wojtek Krakowiak. He then moved back to the United States to play for Major League Soccer, and he joined the San Jose Earthquakes; Russell appeared in 131 games. A pacy midfielder, he scored five goals and 20 assists, helping the Quakes win two MLS Cups, in 2001 and 2003. He is tied for first in club history in playoff appearances with 14. His best season with San Jose came in 2001, when he scored three goals and nine assists, while starting all 26 regular season games and all six playoffs games. Russell was selected to the 2001 MLS All Star Game, but was later replaced due to injury.

Russell also played three games in 2007 with the Los Angeles Galaxy, under the management of Frank Yallop.

=== Coaching ===
Russell began coaching while playing for the Seattle Sounders and continued coaching while playing for the San Jose Earthquakes.

Russell returned to the San Jose Earthquakes in 2008, as assistant coach. During his first year with the club, Russell helped the team make a very successful return to MLS. This included the team&#x27;s posting the best record for any expansion team since 1998 with eight wins, 33 points and 32 goals scored. The Quakes also posted a nine-game unbeaten streak from July 12 – Sep 27, which was the longest unbeaten streak in the league in 2008 and the second longest ever by an expansion team.

In the offseason, Russell successfully completed the U.S. Soccer Federation &quot;A&quot; coaching license course.

For the last two games of the 2014 regular season, Russell became interim head coach. Dominic Kinnear eventually took over after the season.

On November 22, 2016, Russell was named the first Head Coach of 2017 USL Expansion Team: Reno 1868 FC.

In his first year under the helm; Russell has guided Reno 1868 FC to a playoff berth, as well as setting some new Records in the USL: Single Season Goals (69*), largest margin of victory in USL history (9). Russell&#x27;s Reno 1868 team scored more goals over a 4-year period than any team in USL. Russell guided Reno 1868 to the playoffs all 4 years and was named Coach Of The Year in 2020 and Coach Of The Year Finalist in 2017 and 2019

On January 3, 2023, San Jose announced that Russell would return as an assistant coach under the new technical staff of head coach Luchi Gonzalez. When the team parted ways with head coach Gonzalez on June 24, 2024, Russell was once again named as interim head coach of the San Jose Earthquakes. Bruce Arena was hired over the offseason.

<text>KBEM-FM (88.5 FM, &quot;Jazz88&quot;) is a public radio station broadcasting a jazz format based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, the station serves the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The station is operated by the Minneapolis Public Schools system and has been partnering since 1989 with the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT), providing traffic congestion reports for commuters in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. KBEM also broadcasts live headliner performances from the Twin Cities Jazz Festival each June. KBEM is a member of Minnesota&#x27;s AMPERS network.

KBEM&#x27;s studios are located on James Avenue North in Minneapolis, while its transmitter is located in Falcon Heights.

==History==
KBEM first took to the air in October 1970. Its broadcast studios were originally in Vocational High School in downtown Minneapolis (since converted to an office building) and has, since 1983, been located at North Community High School. The current jazz format began in 1985. Students assist with the station&#x27;s operations during the day, delivering news reports and other programming. Minneapolis School Board meetings and Minneapolis City Council meetings were carried live for over 20 years.

Graduates of KBEM&#x27;s broadcast instructional program have gone on to work at WCCO, KQRS-FM, KFAI, Minnesota Public Radio, KDWB, KTCZ, KPCC in Los Angeles, KQED in San Francisco, Sirius Satellite Radio, XM Satellite Radio, WHYI in Miami, WWZZ in Washington, D.C., KHMX in Houston and other media such as the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; and &quot;City Pages&quot;.

Minnesota Public Radio had attempted to purchase the station in 1979 as part of an attempt to split its growing network into classical music and talk radio components, but the deal fell through. Instead, the organization acquired WLOL 1330 AM in 1980. A decade later, it purchased WLOL 99.5 FM (now KSJN).

In late 2004, it was announced that Mn/DOT would be cutting its funding of the station as a cost-saving measure. This funding amounted to $418,000 annually at the time, although the contract extended until March 2005. The money accounted for roughly half of the station&#x27;s budget, so KBEM launched an emergency fundraising drive. By January 2005, the drive had gathered $45,000 from the public toward a goal of $138,000 to cover the station until the end of its fiscal year (mid-2005). The school system hoped to roughly double membership from 4,000 to 8,000. In a surprise move, Clear Channel Communications donated $25,000 to the station and ran fundraising announcements on the company&#x27;s local stations, including Cities 97 and its former smooth jazz outlet KJZI (now KFXN-FM). Sufficient public opposition to the proposed end of the MnDOT partnership caused the agency to continue the relationship, but at a reduced rate. KBEM is the only all-jazz radio station in the Twin Cities.

<text>KFAI (90.3 FM) is a community radio station located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States; broadcasting to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area; colloquially referred to as the Twin Cities.

The station broadcasts a wide variety of music, and also airs programming catering to many of the diverse ethnic groups of the region. KFAI has frequently been honored by local media outlets for its variety of spoken-word content and musical diversity (former local alternative weekly &quot;City Pages&quot; frequently included it in their annual &quot;Best of the Twin Cities&quot; awards).

The station offers weekly public access services through mentorship and resource-sharing. KFAI is part of Minnesota&#x27;s AMPERS network. Because KFAI&#x27;s multi-format programming covers the largest range of identities making up the region, it is considered by many to be AMPERS&#x27; flagship station. The call sign stands for &quot;&#x27;Fresh Air, Inc.&quot;, the founding nonprofit organization that operates KFAI.

KFAI&#x27;s studios are located on Riverside Avenue in Minneapolis, while its transmitter is located atop the IDS Center in downtown Minneapolis.

==History==
The station first went on the air with a 10-watt signal on May 1, 1978, after drawn-out deliberations with the Federal Communications Commission, which was licensing a few low-power FM stations at the time. The first home was in the belfry of the Walker Community Church in South Minneapolis.
In 1984, the primary transmitter was moved from the roof of the Seward Co-op to the top of the Foshay Tower in downtown Minneapolis and upgraded to 125 watts. The studios moved from the church two years later, when it moved to the second floor of a Butler Drug store on Lake Street. In 1991, studios were built especially for Fresh Air Radio at Cedar-Riverside near the University of Minnesota, where it remains today. A 170-watt West St. Paul translator station went up in 1994 and was sold to Hmong Radio Broadcast, LLC in May 2020.

In March 2007, KFAI&#x27;s main transmitter moved to IDS Center, after the new owner of Foshay Tower evicted all current tenants of the building as part of a redevelopment plan to turn it into a hotel. Since November 6, 2007, the station has been operating with an upgraded effective radiated power of 900 Watts and an IDS Center tower height of above ground level. This upgrade allows the station to have a stronger signal from the IDS Center, which extends the station&#x27;s coverage deeper into St. Paul and the southeast suburbs.

Due to KFAI&#x27;s limited signal power, programming is targeted to the Twin Cities communities. Three other IPR stations exist in Minneapolis-St. Paul: KBEM-FM (jazz), KMOJ (urban), and KUOM (college/eclectic). KVSC, another college station in St. Cloud, Minnesota, can also be received by some area residents. The station had major plans for expansion into HD radio by the end of 2008. As part of this expansion, on November 16, 2008, the station switched over to a new 900-watt transmitter and directional antenna for its 90.3 FM signal, significantly increasing the broadcast coverage area.

In mid-2010, KFAI changed its weekday programming schedule to institute an all-news format from 6-10 a.m. The change included the scheduling of &quot;The Takeaway&quot;, a three-hour syndicated show from Public Radio International (PRI). Some long-time listeners and programmers were upset with the change, charging the station with abandoning its volunteer programming model. &quot;The Takeaway&quot; was dropped two years later, after PRI announced the decision to reduce it to a one-hour show.

During 2016, KFAI became the only known radio station in the United States to broadcast the song Ready &#x27;n&#x27; Steady by D.A. and the Dukes. In 2017, the station again revamped its programming lineup to essentially become &quot;a different radio station every hour.&quot;

Today, KFAI&#x27;s community-powered 24/7/365 broadcast is known for its eclectic entertainment and public affairs programming that features 89 programs in nine languages, with 84 programs produced locally and in-house. Only a handful of weekly programs are produced by the following affiliates Democracy Now, Counter Stories &amp; Native Lights (AMPERS), The Conversation with Al McFarlane (Insight News), and rotating features from two area LPFM stations.

==Programming==
People of color, the LGBTQIA+ community, and many intersectional identities lead more than 50% of the programs on the broadcast schedule, making KFAI one of Minnesota&#x27;s most culturally, generationally, and socio-economically diverse broadcast media outlets.

KFAI&#x27;s immediate neighborhood is home to the largest Somali community in the United States and Minnesota&#x27;s most culturally diverse neighborhood: Cedar-Riverside/West Bank. Beyond the broadcast, KFAI supports community building through developing, hosting, presenting, and sponsoring arts, entertainment, and cultural events across the Twin Cities.

KFAI is home to Fresh Fruit, the longest-running LGBTQIA+ radio program in the Nation.

Languages spoken on-air at KFAI include Amharic, Bulgarian, English, Filipino, French, Oromo, Spanish, Tigrinya, Somali, and Vietnamese.

As a multi-format radio station, KFAI embodies the spirit of eclecticism. For example, one might find an Blues program followed by an hour of news about LGBT issues, or a Reggae program followed by an hour of Somali public affairs programming, and so on. Although programs almost always occupy the same blocks from week to week, programs often have little or nothing to do with what precedes or follows them.

Some of the station&#x27;s programming is carried on other radio stations. Crap from the Past, Radio Pocho,&quot; and Womenfolk,&quot; air on several stations across North America, and one affiliate in New Zealand.

In 2024, the station&#x27;s HD broadcast added a new HD sub-channel, known as FA-2 (Fresh Air 2). Programming for this sub-channel was previously heard online only. Now, listeners can hear KFAI&#x27;s FM broadcast on HD1 and FA-2 on HD2.

<text>KMOJ (89.9 MHz) is a community-oriented noncommercial FM radio station in Minneapolis, Minnesota, airing a predominantly urban adult contemporary radio format. KMOJ&#x27;s radio studios are on West Broadway Avenue in Minneapolis, and its transmitter is in Arden Hills.

KMOJ features soul, blues, urban gospel, reggae, jazz, hip-hop, spoken word, and talk shows aimed at African American listeners. It is owned and operated by the nonprofit Center for Communications and Development (CCD), on Minneapolis&#x27;s north side. KMOJ is a member of AMPERS, Minnesota&#x27;s independent public radio network.

==History==
KMOJ began in 1976 as WMOJ, a very low-power AM station at 1200 kHz that reached only a few blocks from its studios and transmitter in the Sumner-Olson and Glenwood-Lyndale public housing developments. The station expanded its reach with a move to FM in September 1978, becoming KMOJ at 89.7 FM with 10 watts of power from its transmitter and antenna atop a highrise near its studios at 810 5th Avenue North. A frequency change to 89.9 in 1984 was necessitated for a power increase to 1,000 watts; the transmitter site remained the same. In 1985, the studio moved to a newly built facility in an existing building across the street at 501 Bryant Avenue North.

The station has struggled with internal tension and lack of funds, among other things, since its inception. KMOJ was forced to move from its Girard Terrace studios in January 2007 after severe structural damage was discovered and the building was condemned and subsequently razed. The studios moved to a temporary location in the Uptown area of Minneapolis in March 2007 until a permanent location could be established. The station worked with the City of Minneapolis and moved to a building at West Broadway and Penn Avenue in 2010.

In 2011, KMOJ moved its transmitting facility from its longtime original site to a new facility in the northern suburb of Arden Hills and increased power to 6,200 watts. The old transmitter was given to a radio station in Nigeria on the same frequency.

==HD Radio==
KMOJ broadcasts its signal in HD Radio, and has two HD sub-channels. Its HD2 channel carries a hip hop format branded as &quot;The Ice&quot;, while its HD3 channel carries KVSC, a college radio station from St. Cloud State University.

<doc id="1193013" wikidata="Q6847159" url="?curid=1193013" title="Mike Hatch">
<text>Michael Alan Hatch (born November 12, 1948) is an American politician and lawyer. He was the Attorney General of Minnesota from 1999 to 2007, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Commerce from 1983 to 1989, and chair of the Minnesota DFL Party from 1980 to 1983.

== Early life and career ==
Hatch is a 1966 graduate of East High School in Duluth. In the 1960s, he attended the University of Minnesota, Duluth before dropping out and serving 18 months in the Merchant Marine. There he earned $1.91 an hour shoveling coal into the engines of ore boats crossing the Great Lakes, and made stops in the ports of Rust Belt cities along the shores of the Great Lakes. He was in port in South Chicago during the riots after Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in 1968 and witnessed the clashes between Vietnam War protesters and police during the 1968 Democratic convention. He got mugged at a port in Milwaukee. Hatch later said of this time in his life, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t political at the time, but I was awakening to this stuff.&quot; He got into a scuffle with a ship&#x27;s officer who made a derogatory comment about Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s defense of African Americans. &quot;And that is when I became a Democrat,&quot; Hatch said. He hitchhiked to Cleveland, called his father for money to return to Minnesota, and returned to the University of Minnesota Duluth to finish his degree with honors. Of the problems in the Rust Belt cities he saw while working the boats, Hatch has said, &quot;There was despair. I took an interest. I thought, &#x27;you know what, I&#x27;m going to do something about it.&#x27;&quot;

Hatch earned a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1973. He was a trial lawyer in private practice in the 1970s and became chair of the state DFL Party in 1980. In 1983, Governor Rudy Perpich appointed Hatch commissioner of the state Department of Commerce, a position he served in until 1989. In 1998, he was elected state attorney general, a position to which he was reelected in 2002, receiving more votes than any previous candidate for any statewide office.

== State Democratic chairman (1980–1983) ==
In 1976, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) was Minnesota&#x27;s dominant political party. It held two U.S. Senate seats, the governor&#x27;s office, four of eight Congressional seats, 104 of 134 seats in the Minnesota House of Representatives and 49 of 67 seats in the Minnesota Senate. In 1978, the DFL suffered devastating losses in what is known as the &quot;Minnesota Massacre.&quot; The two U.S. Senate seats and governorship went Republican, Republicans picked up an additional Congressional seat, and the DFL lost its majority in the state House, ending up with a 67–67 tie. (The Minnesota Senate was not up for election in 1978.)

The DFL party chair was elected at the state party convention, conducted in June of each election year. In 1980, the prevailing issue was how the DFL could recover from the devastating loss in 1978. There were six candidates for chair, all but one of whom had significant interest groups or officeholders supporting them. Hatch, the one candidate without significant support from an interest group, ran a geographically based campaign focused primarily on the support of county and congressional district chairs. The convention was tumultuous, with various interest groups opposed to each other over abortion, labor, and farm issues. Hatch, who had the least amount of political experience, campaigned as a centrist who focused on economic issues and promised to elect more Democrats in the 1980 election. He was elected chair on the third ballot. 

At the time of his victory in June 1980, the mortgage on the party headquarters was in default and the party had no campaign funds for the 1980 election. Under Hatch, the DFL became the first state Democratic party to acquire a computer and jet printer. He published a monthly newspaper that was printed on the computer and mailed to each contributor of a &quot;Sustaining Fund.&quot; In spring 1981, Hatch invited Vice President Mondale and Senator Ted Kennedy, the likely Democratic presidential candidates in the 1984 election, to a &quot;Jefferson-Jackson Day&quot; dinner. The invitation to Kennedy to a dinner in Mondale&#x27;s home state was controversial, but the dinner, with 5,000 in attendance, was the largest and most profitable in the history of the DFL Party.

In 1980, the DFL Party was deeply divided over issues ranging from abortion to gay rights to gun control. The party rules encouraged division by requiring delegates to be elected from &quot;sub-caucuses&quot; organized around specific issues or interest groups. In 1981, Hatch printed political buttons, posters and letterhead under the name &quot;The Centrists,&quot; promoting the notion that the party had to stand for more than just a conglomeration of interest groups. Feminists, pro-lifers, gun control organizations, and gay rights supporters opposed the &quot;Centrists,&quot; who tried to end the sub-caucus system but were defeated by a united coalition of pro-life and pro-choice activists. 

Hatch &quot;ran the party with a focus on winning elections and an intense dislike of its internal squabbles.&quot; By 1982 the &quot;Centrists&quot; began exerting influence on party affairs, and the interest groups turned their focus on Hatch for organizing the group. Nonetheless, the &quot;Centrists&quot; remained an influence in the 1982 elections, stifling the intraparty fights between the interest groups during an important election campaign.

A longtime political reporter said of Hatch&#x27;s tenure as chair: &quot;He worked to rebuild the bitterly divided, debt-ridden DFL Party after its disastrous 1978 election losses. He showed his prowess, both at raising money and organization building. He raised $50,000 to pay off the mortgage and head off the foreclosure on the party headquarters in south Minneapolis, scrounged up another $50,000 to buy a state-of-the-art, 5-megabyte computer the size of a piano, and raised a total of $1.2 million. The DFL is believed to be the first Democratic Party in the country to use the technology of computers, direct mail and telemarketing.&quot;

The DFL had a banner year in 1982. It won two additional Congressional seats (5 out of eight), the House of Representatives (77 of 134 seats), the State Senate (42 out of 67) and the governorship. In September 1982 Hatch was instrumental in getting the DFL Party to endorse Rudy Perpich, who defeated DFL-endorsed candidate Warren Spannaus for governor in the primary election. It was the first time that the DFL endorsed a candidate for statewide office who had defeated the convention-endorsed candidate.

In January 1983, Perpich appointed Hatch commissioner of Securities and Real Estate.

== Commissioner of Commerce ==
On December 7, 1982, Governor Perpich appointed Hatch commissioner of the Department of Securities and Real Estate. Hatch&#x27;s first task was to reorganize the Department of Insurance, the Department of Banking, and the Department of Securities and Real Estate into one Minnesota Department of Commerce. The reorganization was completed in July 1983.

=== Insurance company accountability ===
The Minnesota insurance industry was largely unregulated in 1983. The Associated Press wrote that &quot;Hatch vigorously embraced the role of consumer advocate.&quot; One of his first actions as commissioner was to create an enforcement division that eventually handled 40,000 complaints a year from the public. Hatch proposed a series of regulations to provide protections for insurance policyholders. He got enacted into law several dozen new standards to provide fair processing of insurance claims for policyholders. These provisions are collectively called the Unfair Claims Practices Act. He also got enacted legislation to provide that an insurance agent and company must not sell a policy that is not suitable for the policyholder. To limit the arbitrary cancellation of automobile policies, Hatch established a point system to determine when an automobile policy may be cancelled by an insurer. He also implemented a set of regulations to stop misleading statements in insurance solicitations. Hatch adopted rules that made agents holding themselves out as &quot;financial planners&quot; owe their clients a fiduciary duty. President Barack Obama proposed a similar provision over 30 years later at the federal level. Hatch also proposed that commercial insurers must give 30 days&#x27; notice of any change in the terms of a commercial policy or increase in rates.

=== Farm crisis ===
Hatch was commerce commissioner during the farm crisis of the mid-1980s. In 1983 Minnesota had over 430 banks and savings and loan associations. Most were in rural areas and depended on the success of the rural economy. Interest rates were at record levels, with a few banks paying up to 15% annual interest on some deposits. The combination of volatile interest rates and the failure of rural farms affected the banking industry. Farmers couldn&#x27;t pay back the loans, falling grain and land prices shrank the value of collateral, and double-digit interest rates on deposits put banks in an impossible squeeze. Bank examiners forced banks to write down the value of the loan collateral, which resulted in more banks being labeled insolvent and subject to liquidation. This accelerated foreclosures. The depth of the rural recession resulted in few buyers willing to buy used equipment or land at auction, causing further depreciation of farm assets.

Hatch helped enact several laws to help farmers. One was the mandatory Farmer-Lender Mediation Act of 1986, which required a lender to offer mediation with the farmer before instituting a foreclosure proceeding. Hatch also created an &quot;Interest Buydown Program&quot; in 1985 to pay a portion of the farmer&#x27;s interest on farm loans. To lessen the regulatory pressure from bank examiners, Hatch directed them to allow banks to value collateral at the appraisal made at the time of the loan. Minnesota also established a rural farm advocate program to assist farmers through the loan process and instituted a voluntary mortgage foreclosure moratorium.

Despite these programs, the Commerce Department shuttered over 25 financially unstable Minnesota banks between 1984 and 1989.

=== Commercial insurance ===
The 1980s financial crisis also affected insurance companies, with commercial insurers doubling and tripling rates to make up for &quot;cash flow&quot; underwriting in the late 1970s. In cash flow underwriting, an insurer undercuts premiums, expecting to make substantial profit on an anticipated investment return of 15% to 20%. The problem was that when the rate of return lowered from 20% in 1980 to 8% in 1984, the loss in anticipated investment profit could not sustain the outflow of cash necessary to pay insurance claims.

The losses sustained by cash flow underwriting were particularly hard on commercial insurers that expected to earn a high profit for many years until claims came due. This created problems for policyholders in securing coverage, because few insurers specialized in certain fields of commerce. In 1984, Minnesota had only one liquor liability insurer, two medical malpractice insurers, and few insurers that concentrated coverage in specific areas, such as foster parents or psychologists.

Hatch responded to the doubling and tripling of rates on two fronts. First, he established a Joint Underwriting Association (JUA), which could issue policies to keep an industry operational if there was a shortage of insurers in a particular field, since some industries could not operate without insurance coverage. Second, he undertook several studies of whether the increased premiums had anything to do with increased claims. The St. Paul Companies, based in St. Paul and the primary issuer of medical malpractice policies, argued that Hatch&#x27;s studies were flawed. The dispute between Hatch and the insurer ended up on ABC Nightline on February 14, 1989. The televised debate resulted in insurance hearings around the country, with St. Paul Companies dropping its premiums for medical malpractice insurance by 25% on April 15, 1989.

=== Drought insurance ===
In 1988, rural Minnesota experienced a fierce drought. At the time, Chubb Insurance was selling &quot;rain insurance&quot;, which paid a farmer if the rain gauge nearest their farm had accumulated less than a certain amount of rain between June 1 and August 31. Chubb&#x27;s agents were selling the coverage as late as July 15 that summer, halfway through the drought. Farmers stood in line outside insurance agencies to buy the coverage in July.

When farmers filed claims for their losses due to the drought, Chubb responded that it would not pay on the policy, claiming it was essentially a gambling contract having nothing to do with the success or failure of the farmer&#x27;s crop. The company also disavowed any responsibility for the actions of the agents who sold the coverage. Hatch said that the insurer was responsible for its agents&#x27; actions and that it had to pay on the policies.

The dispute between Chubb and Hatch ended up in federal court in Cincinnati, Ohio, with one issue being whether Hatch could suspend Chubb&#x27;s insurance license if it didn&#x27;t pay on the policies. The court ruled for Hatch, and he was allowed to proceed with a hearing to determine whether Chubb&#x27;s license should be revoked. Shortly before the hearing, Chubb paid the farmers under the policies.

=== Corporate takeover hearings ===
One of Hatch&#x27;s early focal points was the regulation of corporate takeovers. The 1980s was a time of high-profile corporate raids around the nation, in which leveraged buyout artists made bids that often resulted in the closure or liquidation of the target company. In 1984, several Minnesota public companies secured enactment of a law that empowered the commerce commissioner to delay a tender offer to acquire securities of a Minnesota public company if the offer did not fully disclose the consequences of the takeover. In September 1984, just two months after the law became effective, Hatch issued the first in a series of orders that scheduled hearings designed to slow down the takeover of local companies, including Scientific Computers, Conwed, Dayton Hudson Corporation, St. Paul Companies, Pillsbury Companies, and Northwest Airlines. The hearings were controversial, with several takeovers thwarted by the hearing and testimony process, including bids for Scientific Computers, Dayton Hudson, St. Paul Companies, and Northwest Airlines. It became apparent over time that the hearings were interfering with shareholders&#x27; rights and simply serving to raise the bid on the stock being acquired. The takeover hearings largely stopped by 1989.

=== Health insurance ===
As insurance commissioner, Hatch liquidated several HMOs and self-insured health trusts that were insufficiently financed. Insolvent insurers and HMOs included the Duluth Employee Benefit Program, the Minnesota Real Estate Benefit Trust and Plan, More HMO of Virginia, and the LTV Self Insured Trust.

Only a handful of major insurers and HMOs dominated the Minnesota health insurance market in 1987. Blue Cross, PHP and HealthPartners were the dominant players, and all had HMOs that were poorly reserved. PHP, an HMO with 400,000 enrollees, was on the brink of insolvency. PHP had 4,600 medical providers on its panel, over one-third of whom joined a &quot;PHP Oversight Committee&quot; whose goal was to take over the organization. If PHP became insolvent, the other HMOs were not in a position to offer coverage to its enrollees. PHP and the Oversight Committee were engaged in a court fight in Hennepin County District Court, and, to break the logjam, the parties asked Governor Perpich to intervene. On August 15, 1987, Perpich agreed to intervene and appointed Hatch and Health Commissioner Mary Ashton as mediators. Over the next week, the two conducted marathon negotiation sessions culminating in a verbal settlement at 4:00 a.m. the following Friday. The PHP settlement involved a change in the composition of its board of directors.

A Minnesota political reporter wrote that Hatch was &quot;a zealous consumer watchdog in the regulation of banks, insurance companies, securities and real estate firms.&quot;

== Attorney general of Minnesota (1999–2006) ==
=== Campaign ===
As an attorney in private practice with his own Minneapolis law firm, Hatch represented over 50 women pro bono in lawsuits to receive coverage from their HMOs for breast cancer treatment. The experience led Hatch to run for attorney general in 1998. He ran as a populist who promised to tackle problems in the health care system and malfeasance by large corporations. His campaign featured TV ads with testimonials from some of the breast cancer patients he had represented. Hatch quickly made health care reform one of his top priorities as attorney general.

=== First six months ===
As attorney general Hatch got off to a quick start in implementing his campaign promises. He had pledged to be an active attorney general who would be the &quot;people&#x27;s lawyer,&quot; not just represent state agencies. A former insurance regulator, Hatch brought complex, heavily litigated lawsuits against major corporations and health care companies throughout his tenure. In March 1999 he filed suit against American Family Mutual for failing to pay for repairs after storms. American Family had initially sued Hatch to keep him from investigating it, so Hatch ended his investigation and sued the company instead. He alleged that the company violated the law when it paid only for the portion of a consumer&#x27;s roof or siding that was damaged by hail or wind, leaving homeowners with mismatched roofs and siding when the replacement siding or shingles did not match those on the rest of the house. American Family challenged Hatch&#x27;s standing to file the suit, claiming that only the state Commerce Department could bring such actions. In April 2000, the Minnesota Court of Appeals upheld Hatch&#x27;s standing to bring the suit. In October 2000, Hatch prevailed in the lawsuit, securing a court order requiring American Family to pay for both the damaged portion of the roofing and siding and the undamaged portion if matching shingles and siding were no longer available.

On June 9, 1999, Hatch drew national attention when he became the first state official in the country to file a lawsuit against a national bank for violating customers&#x27; privacy. Hatch sued U.S. Bank, one of the largest banking systems in Minnesota, for entering into a &quot;joint marketing agreement&quot; with 15 telemarketing companies and disclosing to them the names, addresses, account numbers, Social Security numbers, and credit histories of almost one million customers. The lawsuit was resolved on June 30, 1999, with US Bank agreeing to stop the sale of customer data to marketing companies and to pay $3 million. A number of other large banks, including Bank of America and Wells Fargo, quickly announced they would end similar agreements. Editorial boards praised Hatch&#x27;s lawsuit, with one noting that &quot;the attorney general&#x27;s action has already had sweeping effect. Bank customers nationwide—and not just U.S. Bancorp depositors—who value the privacy of their accounts and other information are the potential beneficiaries.&quot; Hatch later testified in Congress, asking it to strengthen consumer privacy protections. When he tried to enact state legislation to protect consumers’ privacy, 118 lobbyists showed up to oppose his bill. Hatch stayed active in privacy lawsuits. In December 2000, he brought the first case in the country against a mortgage lender (Fleet Mortgage) for selling customer account information to telemarketers.

=== Health care ===
The month before he took office, Hatch announced the formation of a hotline to take complaints from patients with problems with HMOs. In his first month in office, he announced an HMO bill of rights to give patients greater protection from abusive health insurance practices, such as paying bonuses to doctors who limit the number of referrals given to patients.

One of Hatch&#x27;s most cited accomplishments as attorney general was his lawsuit against Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota. In October 2000, he filed suit against Blue Cross, the state&#x27;s largest health insurer, alleging that it routinely refused to pay for treatment for children and young adults suffering from mental illness, eating disorders, and chemical dependency. The suit alleged that Blue Cross told some patients who asked the insurance company to pay for treatment for their mentally ill children that they should instead relinquish their children to the juvenile justice system or foster care. Blue Cross vehemently denied the allegations. When Hatch filed the suit, only six families were willing to be named in it because of privacy concerns for their children. Hatch later expanded the lawsuit to include testimony from many more families and from former Blue Cross employees who said they intentionally declined coverage simply to save the insurer money.

Hatch eventually secured a legal settlement with Blue Cross that created a three-judge panel to automatically review any decision by the insurer to deny mental health care for children. Blue Cross also paid $8 million to reimburse the state for the cost of shifting care onto the state that the insurer should have paid. The settlement required Blue Cross to reimburse families for treatment it had refused to pay, to process urgent claims within 24 hours, to process appeals within one day, to pay for court-ordered treatment, and to cover 28-day inpatient treatment for chemical dependency and eating disorders. At the time of the settlement, Blue Cross said that &quot;we&#x27;ve failed these families in some important ways&quot; and credited Hatch&#x27;s lawsuit as a wake-up call that forced the company to change its practices.

Mental health experts praised the settlement as a &quot;major step forward in terms of people being able to access the services they need.&quot; Hatch soon expanded the settlement terms to apply to HealthPartners and Medica, the state&#x27;s other two leading health insurance companies.

In 2000, Hatch launched a year-long compliance review of Allina Health System, the state&#x27;s largest hospital system. Allina at the time owned Medica Health Plans, one of the state&#x27;s largest HMOs. Allina and Medica are nonprofit organizations. Hatch launched his probe under the nonprofit laws after the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found that an unnamed Minnesota nonprofit HMO had spent Medicare premium revenue on sports tickets and other lavish perks for executives. When Allina refused to cooperate with the compliance review, Hatch sued it to gain access to its books and records. He ultimately issued a multi-volume compliance report with hundreds of adverse findings against the organization. Among other things, the review found that top executives at the company spent tens of millions of dollars on golf trips, parties, beachfront condominiums, maid service for executives, spas, image consultants, executive enrichment and unearned executive bonuses, foreign travel, consultants, and gifts. Hatch issued a report stating that conflicts of interest within the organization resulted in Medica HMO&#x27;s premium dollars being diverted to shore up the financial position of Allina&#x27;s corporate headquarters, resulting in higher premiums for policyholders. 

Hatch urged Allina to split into two companies, separating Medica, an HMO with one million members, from Allina, which ran 19 hospitals and 48 clinics. Three days later, Allina announced that it would split off HMO Medica from its hospitals and clinics. The CEOs of Allina and Medica soon departed. The new Allina chairman agreed that the lavish spending and executive perks were wrong for a nonprofit health care system. Allina and Medica then entered into a regulatory agreement with Hatch to curb conflicts of interest and inappropriate expenditures.

The &quot;Rochester Post Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;Mike Hatch is performing a genuine public service in giving people an insight into some of the spending habits and accounting practices of Allina Health System.&quot; The &quot;Canby News&quot; wrote, &quot;Attorney General Mike Hatch was absolutely within his rights to go after Allina Health System on grounds that golf trips, $800,000 consultant fees, health spas and so on are way outside the lines of delivering health care.&quot; The &quot;Star Tribune&quot; noted that &quot;Hatch has changed the rules of the game for an industry used to a quiet, low-key scrutiny.&quot;

Hatch then launched a compliance review of HealthPartners, another nonprofit HMO, in 2001. The yearlong compliance review found that executives ate lavish meals, traveled the world, gave gifts of Waterford crystal, and engaged in inappropriate entertainment spending inconsistent with the mission of an HMO. A &quot;Star Tribune&quot; editorial from the time said, &quot;It is remarkable that HealthPartners would spend money on exotic foreign travel…or overtly political opinion polling at a time when executives knew that their industry was under scrutiny, and it is imperative that health-care executives understand that Minnesotans expect a higher standard of stewardship.&quot; The &quot;Rochester Post-Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;The business practices he cites would be wrong in any company, but they are particularly objectionable in a non-profit company in the health care field.&quot; HealthPartners agreed to new spending restrictions and the appointment of a third-party advisor to its board to remedy the deficiencies found in the review.

Hatch then launched a probe of Fairview Health Systems, another hospital system, finding that it aggressively collected debts from patients too poor to pay their bills and did not offer charity care, in violation of its mission as a nonprofit hospital. Hatch obtained a first-in-the-country settlement with Fairview in which it was required to stop using aggressive debt collection tactics, to expand its charity care for poor patients, to give discounts to middle-income families, and to give a third-party monitor appointed by Hatch broad authority to oversee the company&#x27;s collection practices.

Another oft-cited accomplishment of Hatch&#x27;s was the 2005 agreement he reached with every hospital in Minnesota over their billing and collection practices. Under the agreement, the hospitals agreed to charged uninsured patients with household incomes less than $125,000, the same discounted prices their largest insurance company got. Before the agreement, hospitals charged uninsured patients up to four times more than they charged insurance companies. The hospitals also agreed to change their debt-collection practices to offer more charity care and give patients greater rights to negotiate payment terms. In a May 9, 2005 editorial, the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; wrote, &quot;It is good to see Minnesota Attorney General Mike Hatch adopting the uninsured, the orphans of the health care system, and getting them a better deal.&quot;

In 2005 and 2006, Hatch conducted a compliance review of Blue Cross, the state&#x27;s largest health insurer, which found that it had amassed more than $1 billion in financial reserves while raising premiums and shifting costs to consumers. Hatch said at the time, &quot;The obligation of Blue Cross is to provide affordable health care. Their statutory purpose is not to become the wealthiest nonprofit.&quot;

Hatch was active in protecting vulnerable patients in care facilities from abuse. In March 2000 he filed a lawsuit against Alterra, a Wisconsin-based assisted living facility, for misrepresenting that it was qualified to take care of memory-impaired patients. The suit was featured in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article about abuses at assisted-living facilities. Alterra charged patients up to $4,000 per month, but family members reported patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s lying in their own feces and urine-soaked garments for hours, and local police frequently discovered dementia patients wandering the streets in the cold. Hatch noted at the time that assisted-living facilities were &quot;essentially unregulated nursing homes,&quot; and called for them to be licensed. The state legislature did not act on his proposal, and in 2017 the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; ran a multi-part investigative special report exposing abuses of patients in such facilities. One of the major legislative proposals following the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; exposé was that the state license assisted-living facilities.

Hatch also took on pharmaceutical companies. In 2002, he filed a lawsuit against Pharmacia Corporation, making Minnesota one of the first states to sue a drug company for defrauding patients and Medical Assistance by quoting &quot;average wholesale prices&quot; that did not reflect the prices insurers actually paid the pharmaceutical company for its drugs. In 2003, he filed lawsuits against several more drug companies alleging that they misrepresented the prices of inhalers for asthma patients by up to seven times the true cost.

=== 2000–2006 ===
Hatch took on other causes on behalf of the vulnerable. In 2000, he drafted and got enacted the Safe Place for Newborns Act, which allows mothers to take unwanted babies to any hospital for adoption. After 15 people were arrested in multi-million-dollar rings spanning 24 states that solicited young girls for prostitution, Hatch formed a task force to recommend legislative improvements. He secured $6 million in legislative funding for shelters for teenage runaways and prostitutes and drafted legislation that increased penalties for sex offenders.

Hatch wielded the antitrust and regulatory powers of the office to promote market competition and regulate markets that were dominated by monopolies. In August 2000, he was an early opponent of the movement to deregulate electricity, issuing a several-hundred-page report claiming it would lead to higher prices for consumers. The year after Hatch issued this report, California experienced widespread power blackouts and 800 percent rate hikes after it deregulated electricity markets. In 2005, Allina Health System dropped its efforts to buy two cardiology practices after Hatch filed a lawsuit claiming that its proposal would give it a monopoly in local cardiac care.

Hatch handled many constitutional cases as attorney general. In 2001, Minnesota state government nearly shut down when Governor Jesse Ventura and legislative leaders reached an impasse in budget negotiations. Hatch filed a petition to ask a court to order that essential state government services be funded in the event of a shutdown. The court granted Hatch&#x27;s request, the first time that a Minnesota court had issued an order to authorize the government to continue to operate in the absence of a legislative appropriation. Hatch obtained a similar court order in 2005 requiring the state to continue to fund essential government services during a partial government shutdown that year.

Hatch was an advocate for utility ratepayers. In 2001 he petitioned the Public Utilities Commission to put the brakes on a &quot;no surprise bill&quot; program by Reliant Energy Minnegasco that was marketed as a way for consumers to bring predictability to their home heating costs but resulted in customers paying as much as 20 percent more on natural gas. In 2005 he issued a scathing report faulting CenterPoint Energy for deliberately violating the law designed to protect low-income people from having their heat turned off in the winter. &quot;They violated the law and every standard of human decency,&quot; Hatch said at the time. He got the company to reconnect power to 5,000 people. In 2006 he asked the Public Utilities Commission to roll back a rate hike proposed by Xcel Energy after discovering that it was asking for higher rates to collect taxes it would never pay and saddling residents with larger rate hikes than businesses.

Hatch was active in protecting consumers in other sales transactions. In 2002 he won sweeping concessions from several automobile dealers that sold optional warranties and financial products, requiring them to tape-record all sales transactions in which they sold such products. In 2001 he obtained a settlement with US Bancorp requiring the bank to make refunds to customers (one-third of whom were over 80 years old) who were misled into buying long-term 10- and 20-year brokered certificates of deposit, thinking they were regular, short-term bank CDs. He sued the nation&#x27;s largest maker of bulletproof vests for police officers, claiming the company continued to sell vests it knew would degrade in light. The company later filed bankruptcy.

In October 2002, an airplane carrying Senator Paul Wellstone crashed in northern Minnesota, killing Wellstone 11 days before the state general election. Hatch, a Democrat, worked closely with the state&#x27;s Republican secretary of state to ensure that people who already voted for Wellstone on absentee ballots would get another chance to vote. 

Hatch was reelected to a second term as attorney general on November 5, 2002. Republicans won every other constitutional office that year. Hatch won more votes in that election than any candidate in any previous race for constitutional office in Minnesota history.

After learning that the legislature had appropriated only $10,000 to Governor-elect Tim Pawlenty&#x27;s transition office in 2003, Hatch voluntarily transferred $250,000 of his budget to help fund the transition. In his inaugural address in 2002, Hatch called for the state not to forget that &quot;there are children who don&#x27;t always have enough to eat and too many families without health insurance.&quot; An editorial noted of his inaugural remarks that &quot;Since Sen. Paul Wellstone&#x27;s death, Hatch is one of the few voices speaking out on behalf of those who have not shared in the nation&#x27;s prosperity.&quot;

Hatch took action against unlawful bill collection practices. In 2003 he filed a lawsuit against Cross Country Bank for selling subprime credit cards with low balance limits to poor people and then harassing them with debt-collection calls. The suit alleged that the bank called some consumers as many as 60 times a week, including on holidays, using profanities and racist epithets. The bank fought the lawsuit to the Minnesota Court of Appeals, but Hatch prevailed, resulting in a precedent-setting ruling that arbitration clauses in consumer contracts do not apply to a lawsuit by the attorney general. In 2004, Hatch sued AT&amp;T for attempting to collect bills from people who did not owe the money. Later that year, he sued two more debt collection agencies, including one that threatened to sue people for debts that were too old to be collected and another that made relentless telephone calls.

Hatch was an early leader in taking to task illegal practices in the real estate and mortgage industries. In 2001 he filed a lawsuit against Countrywide Mortgage for not notifying borrowers of their right to cancel mortgage insurance that cost some homeowners hundreds of dollars per year. In 2003 he filed a lawsuit against a company that engaged in an equity-stripping scheme. The company purchased homes in foreclosure, promising to lease the homes back to the people who, when they couldn&#x27;t afford the rent, would lose their home equity to the company. Hatch secured a court order barring the company from buying foreclosed homes. In 2005, he launched a probe of Ameriquest for aggressive mortgage lending to people with subprime credit histories. He then reached a settlement with the company requiring it to pay money to 22,000 Minnesota borrowers who were defrauded by aggressive sales practices.

In 2004 and 2005, Hatch challenged Minnesota&#x27;s efforts to release sex offenders into the public rather than civilly commit them to a security hospital. In 2004 he sued a nursing home that locked vulnerable patients in a ward with sex offenders, some of whom assaulted patients. The Minnesota Department of Corrections sent the patients to live in the nursing home, where they were housed with regular patients amid rat and roach infestations. Employees were instructed to tell residents the rats were &quot;bunnies.&quot; The nursing home was shut down.

In 2005 Hatch appeared in court to argue that an insurance company should pay the claim of two little girls who survived an airplane crash that killed their mother in northern Minnesota. One of his former chief deputies said of Hatch&#x27;s tenure as attorney general: &quot;You could expect his light to be on before eight in the morning and you could expect that he was going to go late into the night.&quot;

==2006 gubernatorial campaign==
Hatch was endorsed in June at the DFL state convention in Rochester, Minnesota. The endorsement was not binding. In the battle for the endorsement, Hatch defeated state senators Steve Kelley and Becky Lourey. Kelley conceded, but Lourey said she would run in the September primary. Hatch selected former state auditor Judi Dutcher (who had left the Republican party in 2000) as his lieutenant governor candidate, and won the September primary.

On November 7, 2006, Hatch lost the general election by less than 1% to the Republican incumbent, Tim Pawlenty, in a four-way race that included Independence Party nominee Peter Hutchinson and Green Party nominee Ken Pentel.

Hatch returned to private law practice after his term ended in January 2007. In 2019 he and his successor as attorney general Lori Swanson co-founded Swanson Hatch, P.A., a Minnesota law firm.

<text>KMSU (89.7 FM, &quot;The Maverick&quot;) is a radio station operated by Minnesota State University in Mankato, Minnesota, United States, that carries a mixed news, talk, and music format. A repeater station, KMSK (91.3 FM), serves the city of Austin; a translator station, K220AR (91.9 FM), serves the city of Albert Lea. It is part of Minnesota&#x27;s AMPERS network.

==History==
Radio activity at MSU Mankato began with an educational broadcasting program called the Radio Workshop for communications students at what was then Mankato State Teachers College. Until 1959, radio shows were broadcast on local commercial station KYSM.

On December 14, 1961, the then-Mankato State College filed to build a 10-watt noncommercial radio station in Mankato, approved for 90.5 MHz on May 17, 1962. The station began broadcasting on January 7, 1963. The studios were located on the fourth floor of the administration building, with the transmitter and antenna on the fourth floor of the D-wing of Crawford Center. It broadcast for eight hours a day, airing classical music and taped educational programs, and was staffed by students who could earn a credit hour for working 12 hours a week at the station. It was said that &quot;on a good day,&quot; the station reached St. Peter away. Broadcasting time slowly extended until KMSU was on the air 18 hours a day by 1973. KMSU became the second-oldest college radio station in the state (and the oldest in the state system), behind KUOM at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. The station moved in 1980 from the administration building to the Centennial Student Union.

The late 1970s brought the first threat to the station&#x27;s existence. A change in policy by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) left 10-watt noncommercial educational stations like KMSU vulnerable and unprotected against future improvements, which encouraged many to increase power and invest in equipment and facilities. On January 20, 1982, KMSU became a 3,000-watt station on its present frequency of 89.7 MHz, with a $25,000 federal grant helping to defray the costs of the upgrade.

In July 1983, KMSU aligned with National Public Radio (NPR), a change in its orientation, and achieved authorization from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which required studio renovations and the first full-time station staff in its history. It also prepared to build translators, including the one at Albert Lea, to extend public radio service. The expanding station moved out of the student union facility, which had become cramped due to the shift from student-run to professional operation, to the Warren Street Building in 1989.

KMSU&#x27;s future was put at risk again in 1995 due to budget cuts. The university proposed transferring KMSU to Minnesota Public Radio outright, ending student involvement in the station. The university backtracked on the proposal, citing the potential increased value of the facility with the impending Telecommunications Act of 1996, but staffing was cut from five to two full-time employees, so the possibility was raised of dropping NPR programming. During this time, the station had a parallel student-run station on carrier current and cable, known variously as KGMA and KRNR, which offered to take over KMSU. KRNR and KMSU effected a merger of sorts that fall: classical music and NPR programming was dropped for adult album alternative, and several KRNR student programs were added to the KMSU lineup as public radio programming was de-emphasized. News was provided through a student organization, the Southern Minnesota News Project. Allegations of MSU interference in its operations emerged in November 2003 when the university asked for a story to be pulled, with some saying it was because the story was negative to the institution; several checks and balances were added to the news operation.

KMSK in Austin became part of the KMSU family in 1993. It had previously been a separate station, KAVT-FM, from 1981 to 1992 before its owner, Independent School District No. 492, transferred the station to MSU Mankato in exchange for underwriting announcements.

<text>KQAL (89.5 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a Variety format. Licensed to Winona, Minnesota, United States. The station is currently owned by Winona State University and features local programming, plus programs from other educational and community-based radio stations.

==History==
KQAL-FM at Winona State University in Winona, Minnesota went on the air in December 1975 as a ten watt station. An alternative independent radio station from the beginning, broadcasting began from the roof of the Performing Arts Center. KQAL was started by faculty members Jacque Reidelberger and Brice Wilkinson and student manager, the late Bruce Hittner. A laboratory for the Speech Department at WSU, KQAL has been staffed primarily by students from its inception.

In 1980 KQAL, Winona&#x27;s alternative music radio, was placed under the jurisdiction of the newly created Mass Communication Department at WSU. KQAL increased its power output to 1,100 watts in 1981 and it became a member of the Associated Press.

In 1989, the power output was increased to 1,800 watts and the transmitter moved from the roof of the Performing Arts Center to a 400-foot tower leased from KWNO (AM) on Garvin Heights. Also in &#x27;89 two satellite receiving dishes were installed at the Performing Arts Center.

The entire studio complex was remodeled in 1991 with new equipment and computers.

In 1995, the station&#x27;s website went online and computer based digital audio editing equipment was installed.

KQAL continued the transition to the digital era in 1998 when computer based, hard drive audio storage and automation was introduced, virtually eliminating the use of tape at the station. The original system was replaced in 2002 with a new, more robust and reliable system.

In 2009 KQAL began a move from the Performing Arts Center to Phelps Hall which was extensively remodeled and new radio and TV studios were constructed. KQAL began broadcasting from these new studios in 2010.

<text>KSRQ (90.1 FM) is a 24,000-watt community radio station licensed to Northland Community &amp; Technical College. The station serves the Thief River Falls, Minnesota area with rimshot coverage in Grand Forks, North Dakota.

Branded as Pioneer 90.1, KSRQ is a member of Minnesota&#x27;s AMPERS network, an association of 17 independent community stations across the state. The station&#x27;s program schedule includes a wide variety of programs, including Adult Album Alternative (AAA), Americana, Folk, Country, Classic Rock, Latino, and Polka, among other genres.

In addition to locally- and regionally-produced shows hosted by volunteers, the station carries public radio programming distributed by Public Radio Exchange, such as American Routes, eTown, and Folk Alley.

== History ==
10-watt KAVS-FM (89.5) signed on at the Thief River Falls Area Vocational School in 1971, three years after the school&#x27;s radio announcing program was launched. Regularly-scheduled programming began in 1972.

A move to 90.1 FM and a power increase to 1,800 watts followed in 1977. The station&#x27;s call letters changed to KSRQ in 1983. The station&#x27;s transmitter was relocated to a taller tower and effective power was increased to 24,000 watts in 1989.

Starting around 2003, the station&#x27;s management started recruiting community volunteer hosts. In August 2004, the station&#x27;s format changed from daily segments of country, soft rock, and metal to adult album alternative as &quot;Pioneer 90.1.&quot;

== Digital broadcasting ==
Digital broadcasts began in 2009, with the addition of an HD digital signal. Multi-casting of HD-2 and HD-3 signals began in December 2010.

KSRQ HD-2 is the Pioneer PolkaCast, featuring recordings from Minnesota and other Midwestern Polka bands.

KSRQ HD-3 is Neon 90, which features pop, rock, soul, and country music of the late 1950s through 1970s.

, Pioneer 90.1 is the only station in northwest Minnesota to offer HD Radio subchannels.

<text>KUMM (89.7 FM, &quot;U-90&quot;) is an American non-commercial educational radio station licensed to serve the community of Morris, the county seat of Stevens County, Minnesota. Established in 1970, the station is owned and operated by the University of Minnesota Morris.

==Programming==
KUMM broadcasts a college radio/alternative rock music format to the greater Stevens County area. The station is a member of AMPERS, the state&#x27;s network of independent community radio stations. The station also airs programming produced by local volunteers as well as the university&#x27;s students.

==History==
KUMM began licensed broadcast operations on September 17, 1972, with 10 watts of effective radiated power (ERP) from an antenna in height above average terrain. The station was assigned the call sign &quot;KUMM&quot; by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

In May 1981, KUMM was granted a construction permit to increase power to 223 watts and lower its antenna to . The station began licensed operation at the new parameters on December 15, 1983.

In September 2002, KUMM applied for a new construction permit to further expand the station&#x27;s coverage area. The application sought to raise the antenna to and increase the ERP to 3,000 watts. A 2009 amendment to that application reduced the requested power to 700 watts. KUMM began licensed operation at these new parameters on October 15, 2009.

<text>WDSE-FM (103.3 MHz) is a 95,000-watt public radio station in Duluth, Minnesota, operated by the Duluth–Superior Area Educational Television Corporation, which primarily carries an adult alternative radio format but also has a number of programs focusing on jazz, blues, and other genres. It is part of Minnesota&#x27;s Independent Public Radio network. Programming from national sources includes &quot;World Cafe&quot; and &quot;American Routes&quot;.

==History==
The station was founded by students at the University of Minnesota Duluth in 1957 as KUMD, a 10-watt AM station in the basement of what was then Washburn Hall dormitory on the old main campus in a residential neighborhood of Duluth. The first station manager was student Bruce Elving, and the first chief engineer was Douglas Hedin. Hedin also built the station&#x27;s first transmitter. The station was closed down several times by the FCC in its early days due to out-of-compliance technical standards.

KUMD went through a series of changes and fits and starts in its early days, including station managers, due to the student-run nature of the college radio station. In 1962, stronger faculty advisors were appointed as the station converted to 250 watts FM as KUMD-FM. The dean of UMD&#x27;s School of Humanities, R. Dale Miller, also became involved at this time and became a major supporter of expansion of the station. The last of these &quot;stronger&quot; advisors was Joe Zesbaugh, who helped professionalize the operation. Zesbaugh left in the summer of 1969 to run public television at Arizona State University. His short-term successor left under unclear circumstances, at which time student broadcasters regained control of the station. Station managers during this period included Michael (Mickey) Dean, Frank Noviello, Phil Glende, Dave Tuenge, and Tom Livingston. Programming matured dramatically, featuring locally produced public affairs programming, a news operation, and music including jazz, classical, folk, and other &quot;alternative&quot; music not otherwise available in the Duluth/Superior radio market. KUMD also experimented with live sportscasting during this time including several remote broadcasts of the University basketball games. these broadcasts were anchored by Eric Eskola, who subsequently worked as announcer for Duluth&#x27;s CBS radio affiliate (KDAL) and eventually moved to WCCO radio in Minneapolis as its legislative and political reporter, and the co-host of Twin Cities Public Television&#x27;s weekly &quot;Almanac&quot; public affairs program. KUMD&#x27;s bedrock programming philosophy was to offer only programming that was not available on other Twin Ports radio stations. The station was almost totally staffed by student volunteers, who at the time often numbered around 100 at any given time. There were some part-time paid staff who led the volunteers and who were also students.

Livingston eventually convinced the university to take over a defunct commercial 100,000-watt station (WDTH) and to affiliate with National Public Radio. He also introduced the concept of listener support and began on-air fund drives to help fund the station&#x27;s operations. The station became known as WDTH for several years before reclaiming its KUMD-FM call letters. Livingston served as the station manager for eight years. He was succeeded by Paul Schmitz, who was eventually succeeded (again) by Michael (Mickey) Dean, who was succeeded by Vicky Jacoba.

The station was sold to the Duluth–Superior Area Educational Television Corporation on December 1, 2021, for $175,000, and took the callsign WDSE-FM.

<text>KVSC (88.1 FM) in Saint Cloud, Minnesota is part of Minnesota&#x27;s Independent Public Radio network. It is operated by St. Cloud State University and broadcasts a freeform radio format. KVSC-FM is a non-commercial educational public broadcasting radio station that is a student-run college radio station and operates 365 days per year, nearly 24 hours a day.

==Coverage==
KVSC-FM has a power of 16,500 watts with a listening radius of about 70 miles. The station&#x27;s frequency is 88.1 MHz, &quot;farthest left on your FM dial.&quot; Its transmitter is located near Highway 15 and Interstate 94 south of St. Cloud proper. KVSC also broadcasts to the Minneapolis-St.Paul area via KMOJ 89.9-HD3.

==Programming==
KVSC offers a blend of progressive rock, jazz, folk, reggae, world, blues, Minnesota music, and much more. KVSC has a wide variety of news programming, which includes coverage of university, local &amp; statewide events, and live broadcasts of St. Cloud State University sporting events.
The station carries an HD-subchannel, KVSC 88.1 HD-2 that rebroadcasts sister station Radio X. KVSC 88.1 HD-3 is primarily jazz music. KVSC 88.1 HD-4 is a rebroadcast of &quot;The Ice&quot;, which is also aired on KMOJ 89.9 HD-2 in the twin cities. KVSC has also aired special programming prepared outside of St. Cloud, including a docudrama program regarding the Duluth lynchings in the 1920s.

==History==
KVSC first began operations as a 10-watt, Class D broadcast facility on May 10, 1967, broadcasting at 88.5 MHz. For ten years prior to this, students interested in radio broadcasting had no live-air broadcasting opportunities. The students would pre-produce all their programming in the university studios, which would then be aired on WJON (AM1240) radio. This meant that all programs produced would have to fit in with WJON&#x27;s format or they would not get on the air. It was soon decided that St. Cloud State University had a need for its own radio broadcast facility, and thus KVSC was developed.

The station initially broadcast with limited hours and only when school was in session.

The call letters were selected to signify that the station would serve as the &quot;Voice of Saint Cloud&quot;. The station was run exclusively by volunteers from the university student population and was financed by the student activity fees and the Mass Communications department. The music format was predominantly classical music, with a smaller percentage of folk and rock music sprinkled in. The overall operation was small and required minimal funding, outside of the need for equipment acquisition and repair.

In 1969, the Higher Education Coordination Board formed a subcommittee to organize and work with communications programs in Minnesota higher-education institutions. KVSC&#x27;s adviser was instrumental in developing this committee. In 1972, the HECB subcommittee was disbanded in favor of a new organization. The Association of Minnesota Public and Educational Radio Stations (AMPERS), a non-profit corporation, was officially registered on July 26, 1977. It comprised the same member stations which had been involved in the HECB committee. KVSC is a charter member of AMPERS and two of its managers have served terms as president.

On numerous occasions throughout the 1970s, KVSC sought approval to increase its broadcast power, with the final approval coming in November 1981. KVSC officially moved down the dial to 88.1 MHz at 6 a.m. on February 8, 1983, and increased power to 5,200 watts. KVSC was amended to a radio class C2 operation, and licensed to operate 20 hours per day. Unfortunately, broadcast at this new level caused interference with local television reception. Experimentation with antennae filters and transmitter dampers did little to alleviate the interference problems. In early April 1983, just over one month after the long-awaited increase, St. Cloud State University voluntarily elected to reduce KVSC&#x27;s output power to 1,300 watts until a more permanent solution to this interference could be found.

Funding and permits were granted, allowing KVSC to erect a new antenna, away from the campus area (formerly located on top of Sherburne Hall).

The new transmitter site was built near the intersection of Highway 15 and Interstate-94, where high-power broadcasts would be less likely to interfere with the St. Cloud residents. The power increase was finalized on September 24, 1992. KVSC now broadcasts with an operating power of 16,500 watts, covering a 70-mile broadcast radius with a potential audience of nearly two million listeners in the central Minnesota region.

In November 1993 KVSC&#x27;s sports department adopted the policy of not broadcasting Indian team mascot names in stories and within KVSC play-by-play coverage. This policy was put in place to recognize and respect Native Americans and Indigenous people&#x27;s perspective on team mascot names.

KVSC began broadcasting 24 hours a day in September 1994. KVSC maintains a 24-hour schedule except during semester and holiday breaks at the university. After several years of planning, KVSC began broadcasting its radio signal on the Internet in October 1999. (This Web site was established in 1995). KVSC established a solid relationship with Cloudnet, a local internet supplier. The station began with fifteen stereo Real Audio streams located at kvsc.org.
KVSC&#x27;s programming format has not always featured alternative and progressive music. For a brief period, starting in June 1984, student directors elected to change KVSC to a Top 40 &quot;hit radio&quot; format. During this period, KVSC lost its unique listener appeal. The programming was similar to most other Top 40 formats, and the program quality was considered poor. In the spring of 1985, university administration made the decision to override the student directors&#x27; decision and change KVSC&#x27;s format back to the alternative and progressive format for which it is best known.

During the summer of 1986, the university administration approved the institution of KVSC&#x27;s first full-time paid staff position. Kevin Ridley (known as Captain Science on the air) was a graduate of the Mass Communications program and long-time KVSC staff member. He took on the position of Station Manager, acting as a full-time liaison between the university administration and the KVSC staff and student directors. The position of Station Manager is currently held by Jo McMullen, also a graduate of the Mass Communications program at SCSU. KVSC also has two graduate student positions appointed annually to assist with station operations.

In May 2007 KVSC celebrated 40 Years of Broadcasting. With the presence of alumni from 1967 to present, volunteers (and those from the guild prior to the F.C.C. license issued on May 10, 1967) were there to celebrate. KVSC celebrated with four events - representing four decades of non-commercial, educational radio. More than 800 people enjoyed two concerts, social time and a backyard barbecue. 
KVSC operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. In its role as &quot;Your Sound Alternative&quot; (an official slogan since 1983), KVSC provides programming which is unique within its market. KVSC has received acclaim for outstanding efforts in the areas of public affairs, programming, news and sports coverage, pre-produced features and live music coverage. Notable alumni include Jill Riley of 89.3 The Current, and City Pages music critic Rob Callahan.
In 2017, the station celebrated 50 years of broadcasting.

In 2019, the station celebrated 40 years of a long running tradition known as Trivia Weekend. The contest began in 1980, as a way to entertain students in the residence halls on campus.

==Trivia Weekend==
KVSC is well known in central Minnesota for its annual 50-hour trivia marathon. The first &quot;Trivia Weekend&quot; took place in 1980, with 25 participating teams. In 2007, 80 teams participated, setting an all-time record. The contest begins at 5 p.m. on the second Friday in February, and ends at 7 p.m. on the following Sunday. During each of the 50 intervening hours, DJs read nine or more trivia questions over the air. Teams are to call in with the correct answer before the time limit on the question expires. Question values have ranged from 10 to 500 points (in the 2008 and 2009 contests, instead of a single 500-point question for which teams had two hours, four 250-point questions were asked, one at the top of each of the last four hours), and any team that answers a question correctly in the allotted time (generally ranging from 5 to 30 minutes) is awarded the value of that question. The team with the most points at the end of the contest wins, and is the owner for a year of the chipped vase known as The Minnesota Masters of Trivia Traveling Trophy. The contest is staffed by volunteers and sponsored by local businesses.

==History==
===Sulu Royal Family===
The King of Sulu Paduka Pahala from the first royal family on Sulu before the Hashemites went on a tribute mission to the Ming dynasty Yongle Emperor. He died of natural causes in China and his two sons and wife were left in the care of Hui Muslims in Dezhou, Shandong. The two families descended from the two sons were given the surnames An and Wen by the Ming Emperors. They lived through the Ming and Qing dynasties and still live in Dezhou today.

The Kingdom of Sulu was converted to Islam, and the Hashemite Sharif ul-Hāshim of Sulu arrived in Sulu and married a princess of the previous non-Hashemite royal family, founding the Sulu Sultanate.

Tausug delegations from Sulu have visited Dezhou to see the descendants of the previous royal family.

===Death of Empress Xiaoxianchun===

Qianlong&#x27;s first empress, Empress Xiaoxianchun, died on the 8th day of the 3rd month of the 13th year of Qianlong at the age of 37, on board a boat in Dezhou under circumstances that were not well documented by historical sources.

==Tourism==

Dezhou&#x27;s biggest historical attraction is the tomb of Sultan Paduka Pahala of Sulu (Philippines), who died in Dezhou on his return journey from a visit to the Yongle Emperor in 1417. The tomb is well preserved and has been declared a national heritage site. Descendants of the sultan&#x27;s Muslim followers still live in Dezhou today, and are classified as the Hui minority.

One of Dezhou&#x27;s county Lingxian used to be a big county in China in history, when it was called Pingyuan County. Now part of the ancient city wall of Tang Dynasty still exists in the south of the region. Before the Three Kingdoms formed, one of the three emperors Liu Bei used to be the chief of the county, together with his fellows Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. In addition, it is the hometown of Dongfang Shuo, the most well-known adviser during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han. In the Tang Dynasty, a major figure of Chinese calligraphy, Yan Zhenqing, once took office as the administrator of the county. Today, a memorial hall for the two historic figures is built in the People&#x27;s Park of Lingxian, where a lot of materials of Dongfang Shuo and stone inscriptions of Yan Zhenqing are preserved.

<doc id="1193051" wikidata="Q2035670" url="?curid=1193051" title="Lynn Strait">
<text>James Lynn Strait (August 7, 1968 – December 11, 1998) was an American singer. He was the lead vocalist and lyricist for the nu metal band Snot.

== Biography ==
Strait was born on August 7, 1968, in Manhasset, New York. His father was in the US Armed Forces, and the Strait family moved around the country throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, before deciding to settle down in Santa Barbara, California, when Lynn was 10 years old. Although he was not diagnosed with it until he was an adult, Strait had Tourette&#x27;s syndrome.

As a teenager, Strait embraced the &#x27;SoCal&#x27; punk scene. Prior to his work with Snot, Strait had played bass in Goleta-based thrash metal band Lethal Dose, but he had never sung in a band. &quot;I always wanted to because it seemed like a lot of fun. But I wasn&#x27;t into what most bands were playing&quot;. Starting from scratch was an advantage for Strait: &quot;There&#x27;s nobody to emulate. I won&#x27;t say what I do is groundbreaking, but some of it is original; there are weird patterns in my vocals, because I got to make up my style as I went along&quot;.

Strait was friends with Tairrie B, and Snot played their first show in 1995 opening for Manhole (later known as Tura Satana). He later appeared as a guest vocalist on Manhole&#x27;s debut album &quot;All Is Not Well&quot; (1996), performing a duet with Tairrie B on the song &quot;Down&quot;. Landing a recording contract was a dream come true for some of his friends, but Strait was underwhelmed by the development. His response: &quot;Now I can order cheese on my Whopper&quot;. While his bandmates were signing the contracts, Strait was completing a month-long sentence in the county jail, where he had spent a year in the early 1990s.

== Death and legacy ==
On December 11, 1998, Strait was traveling from Santa Barbara, California to Los Angeles and was killed in a two-car crash. The crash occurred on a highway off-ramp. Only one other driver, David Redderson, was injured in the crash and he was released from Saint Francis Hospital in Santa Barbara. Also killed in the accident was Strait&#x27;s dog, Dobbs, who was on the cover of the band&#x27;s 1997 debut album &quot;Get Some&quot;, and served as the group&#x27;s mascot.

The band Sevendust paid tribute to Strait with the song &quot;Angel&#x27;s Son&quot;. A tribute album entitled &quot;Strait Up&quot; was released on November 7, 2000, on Virgin Records/Immortal Records, compiled with the help of members of Limp Bizkit, Korn, Slipknot, Sevendust, Hed PE, Coal Chamber, Sugar Ray, System of a Down, Soulfly, Incubus, Ozzy Osbourne, and others. The album contains tributes to Strait with backing from the remaining band. Also on the record was a remixed version of Strait&#x27;s last recording with Snot, a song titled &quot;Absent&quot;, the original version of which was included on the &quot;Strangeland&quot; soundtrack.

On August 7, 1999, fans were encouraged to buy copies of Snot&#x27;s debut CD &quot;Get Some&quot; in an attempt to cause a jump in the charts on what would have been Strait&#x27;s 31st birthday. The band My Ruin fronted by Tairrie B paid tribute to him with a song called &quot;Rockstar&quot;. The band NOFX mentions Strait and Dobbs in their song &quot;Doornails&quot;, in which they pay tribute to deceased punk band members. Strait had previously provided backing vocals on their song &quot;The Brews&quot;. Punk Rock band Lagwagon would pay tribute to Lynn with the song “Narrow Straits” in 1999 as the members of the band were all from Goleta and were friends with him. British band Reuben paid tribute to him and Kurt Cobain in their song &quot;Push&quot;.

<text>Joanna Pettet (born Joanna Jane Salmon; 16 November 1942) is a British-born Canadian former actress.

==Early life==
Pettet was born in London, England, daughter of Harold Nigel Egerton Salmon and Cecily J. Tremaine, who were married in Chelsea, London in 1940. Her father, a British Royal Air Force pilot, was killed in the Second World War in 1943. After the war, her mother remarried and settled in Montréal, where Joanna was adopted by her stepfather and assumed his surname of &quot;Pettet&quot;.

When Pettet was 16, she moved to New York City.

==Career==

Pettet studied with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre, as well as at the Lincoln Center, and made her debut, aged 19, on Broadway in &quot;Take Her, She&#x27;s Mine&quot; (December 21, 1961-December 8, 1962). She also appeared on Broadway in &quot;The Chinese Prime Minister&quot;, and &quot;Poor Richard&quot;. 

Beginning in 1964 with an episode of &quot;Route 66&quot;, she began making guest appearances in several US dramatic television series of the mid-sixties, including &quot;The Doctors&quot;, &quot;The Nurses&quot;, &quot;The Trials of O&#x27;Brien&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;A Man Called Shenandoah&quot;, and &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;.

In 1966, she was cast in writer/producer Sidney Buchman&#x27;s 1966 adaptation of Mary McCarthy&#x27;s novel &quot;The Group&quot;. The success of that film launched a film career that included roles in &quot;The Night of the Generals&quot; (1967), as Mata Bond in the James Bond spoof &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967), Peter Yates&#x27;s &quot;Robbery&quot; (1967) with Stanley Baker, &quot;Blue&quot; (1968) with Terence Stamp, and the Victorian period comedy &quot;The Best House in London&quot; (1969).

In the 1970s, Pettet&#x27;s feature film appearances became sporadic and included roles in the cult horror films &quot;Welcome to Arrow Beach&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Evil&quot; (1978). Pettet re-emerged as the star of over a dozen television movies, including &quot;The Weekend Nun&quot; (1972), &quot;Footsteps&quot; (1972), &quot;Pioneer Woman&quot; (1973), &quot;A Cry in the Wilderness&quot; (1974), &quot;The Desperate Miles&quot; (1975), &quot;The Hancocks&quot; (1976), &quot;Sex and the Married Woman&quot; (1977), &quot;Cry of the Innocent&quot; (1980) with Rod Taylor, and &quot;The Return of Frank Cannon&quot; (1980). 

Also in the 1970s, Pettet guest-starred four times on the classic Rod Serling anthology series &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, appearing with her then-husband Alex Cord in the episode &quot;Keep in Touch - We&#x27;ll Think of Something&quot;. She also guest-starred in two episodes of the Brian Clemens anthology series &quot;Thriller&quot; in the UK. Pettet starred in the NBC miniseries &quot;Captains and the Kings&quot; (1976), starred in the episode &quot;You&#x27;re Not Alone&quot; from the 1977 NBC anthology series &quot;Quinn Martin&#x27;s Tales of the Unexpected&quot; (known in the United Kingdom as &quot;Twist in the Tale&quot;), was a guest on both &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; and &quot;The Love Boat&quot; (appearing three times on each series), and had a recurring role on &quot;Knots Landing&quot; in 1983 as Janet Baines, an LAPD homicide detective investigating the murder of singer Ciji Dunne (played by Lisa Hartman).

Through the 1970s and 1980s, Pettet made appearances on the television series Harry O, &quot;Banacek&quot;, &quot;McCloud&quot;, &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;Police Woman&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; (the UK series) and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. In 1984, she appeared as herself in a James Bond tribute episode of &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; with ex-Bond girls Britt Ekland and Lana Wood.

Her final role was in the 1990 thriller &quot;Terror in Paradise&quot;, after which she retired from acting, still in her 40s.

==Personal life==
On 8 August 1969, Pettet had lunch at the home of actress Sharon Tate, just hours before the crimes that would be committed at that residence by members of the Manson Family. This event is illustrated in the fictional/alternate-reality 2019 film &quot;Once Upon a Time...In Hollywood&quot;, in which Pettet is portrayed by Rumer Willis.

Actor Sir Alan Bates bequeathed Pettet £95,000 () upon his death in December 2003. The two had been friends since 1964, and Pettet provided support and companionship during his final months after he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in February 2003. Pettet was quoted as saying: &quot;It was a very touching gesture because he had done everything while he was in hospital to make sure I would be looked after following his death.&quot;

In August 2021, Pettet became trapped under a boulder for three hours in high desert near Anza, California. As a result, she needed surgery to replace her shoulder and rotator cuff.

==Recognition==
Pettet won a Theatre World Award for 1964–1965 for her work in &quot;Poor Richard&quot;.

<doc id="1193060" wikidata="Q7016133" url="?curid=1193060" title="1943 New Zealand general election">
<text>The 1943 New Zealand general election was a nationwide vote to determine the shape of the New Zealand Parliament&#x27;s 27th term. With the onset of World War II, elections were initially postponed, but it was eventually decided to hold a general election in September 1943, around two years after it would normally have occurred. The election saw the governing Labour Party re-elected by a comfortable margin, although the party nevertheless lost considerable ground to the expanding National Party.

==Background==
The Labour Party had formed its first government after its resounding victory in the 1935 elections and had been re-elected by a substantial margin in the 1938 elections. Michael Joseph Savage, the first Labour Prime Minister, died in 1940; he was replaced by Peter Fraser, who was widely viewed as competent even if he was less popular than Savage. In the same year as Fraser took power, however, the opposition National Party had replaced the ineffectual Adam Hamilton with Sidney Holland, and was beginning to overcome the internal divisions that had plagued Hamilton&#x27;s time as leader.

As World War II continued, the issues surrounding it naturally came to dominate political debate. Shortages appeared, prompting a certain amount of dissatisfaction with the government. The matter of conscription was also contentious — although both Labour and National supported it, many traditional followers of Labour were angry at their party&#x27;s stance. Many early Labour leaders, including Fraser, had been jailed for opposing conscription in World War I, and were branded hypocrites for later introducing it; Fraser justified his change of position by saying that World War I was a pointless war but that World War II was necessary. A faction of Labour, dissatisfied with the mainstream party&#x27;s economic and conscription policies, followed dissident MP John A. Lee to his new Democratic Labour Party.

A general election was due to be held in 1941, but Fraser, who held a tight rein over the coalition war cabinet, persuaded Parliament to postpone it due to the war.

===MPs retiring in 1943===
Five National MPs, two Labour MPs and two independent MPs intended to retire at the end of the Parliament.

Bill Endean also left parliament at the election. He intended to stand again in but was deselected as a candidate by the National Party.

== By-elections ==
During April and May 1943, there were three deaths of sitting members:
* Paraire Karaka Paikea – – died on 6 April
* Alfred Ransom – – died on 22 May
* Gordon Coates – – died on 27 May

This would have required three by-elections in a year where the government was planning to hold a general election, and in fact, the writ for the Northern Maori by-election was issued on 19 May. On 11 June, the government announced that a general election would be held in September, and at the same time they introduced legislation that postponed the three by-elections. The By-elections Postponement Act 1943 was passed, and amongst other things it revoked the writ issued for the Northern Maori by-election. This was the first time that legislation had been used to postpone by-elections (it happened once more in 1969).

==The election==
The date for the main 1943 election was 25 September, a Saturday. The election to the four Māori electorates was held the day before. 1,021,034 civilians and an uncertain number of serving military personnel were registered to vote — special legislation provided voting rights to all serving members of the armed forces regardless of age, and they voted over several days prior to 25 September. Among the civilian population, there was a turnout of 82.8%. The number of seats in Parliament was 80, a number that had been fixed since 1902.

There were three minor movements participating with 45 candidates: the People&#x27;s Movement or Independent People&#x27;s Group (25), the Real Democracy Movement (17) and the Fighting Forces League (3). However these groups got only 12,867 votes (provisional count: PM or IPG 7,389 (0.89%); RDM 4,421 (0.53%); others or FFL 1,057 (0.13%)). Two of the three Fighting Forces League candidates were also supported by the Real Democracy Movement, which had been formed by the Social Credit Association.

Two seats were uncontested: Awarua and Matarura. Both seats were held for the National Party by serving officers; James Hargest (Awarua) was interned in Switzerland, and Tom Macdonald (Mataura) had just been invalided home. Labour did not contest those two electorates or where Harry Atmore stood. National did not contest three electorates: and where Independent Nationalists stood, or . 1943 was the last general election when some candidates were elected unopposed.

With seamen&#x27;s and servicemen&#x27;s votes taking time to come in, it took until mid-October before all results were finalised. Initially, the outcome in at least ten electorates was in doubt: , , , , , , , , , and . In its 27 September edition, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; posted profiles of new members of parliament. This included National&#x27;s T. R. Beatty, a building contractor from Oamaru who had supposedly beaten Arnold Nordmeyer, a sitting cabinet minister. In initial results, Beatty had a majority of just six votes, but incumbents had strong support by military staff, and Nordmeyer had a final majority of 125 votes.

==Election results==

The 1943 election saw the governing Labour Party retain office by a ten-seat margin, winning forty-five seats to the National Party&#x27;s thirty-four, with one independent. The popular vote was considerably closer — Labour won 47.6%, while National won 42.8%. Holland was stunned by the result, and called for a Commission of Inquiry to look at the servicemens&#x27; vote, but was answered by a report from the Chief Electoral Officer. The Labour vote dropped, particularly in rural areas where the now more prosperous farmers returned to their normal political allegiance. There were strikes by the miners, and resentment at wartime restrictions. Lee&#x27;s &quot;Democratic Soldier Labour&quot; party took votes in closely contested seats, and there was a &quot;vast and weird variety of miscellaneous candidates under strange labels&quot;. However the forces vote favoured both Labour and Democratic Soldier Labour, see table below. And 22 seats were won on a minority vote. 

On the morning of election day, overseas counts from London, Ottawa and the Middle East indicated a majority for Labour, but domestic results coming in during the evening suggested to several government officials and even to Walter Nash thal Labour would lose. By 10.30 pm only 35 of the 80 seats were certain for Labour, with Barclay (Marsden) defeated and even Nordmeyer (Oamaru) uncertain. But with 73,000 servicemens&#x27; votes that came in during the day, Lowry (Otaki), Hodgens (Palmerston North) and Roberts (Wairarapa) scraped in. Over subsequent days with 60,000 special votes plus over 20,000 more servicemens&#x27; votes, both Nordmeyer and Anderton (Eden) also scraped in. Fraser, who had campaigned among the troops, quipped that &quot;it was not only North Africa that the Second Division had saved&quot;. By 7 October, National&#x27;s lead in four seats had been overturned by the services votes, and by 12 October, it was apparent that the result in six seats (Eden, Nelson, Oamaru, Otaki, Palmerston North and Wairarapa) had been overturned by the services vote.

John A. Lee&#x27;s new Democratic Labour Party won only 4.3% of the vote, and no seats. Bill Barnard and Colin Scrimgeour were formerly on the Labour left. Barnard had left the Labour Party with John A. Lee but had fallen out with him and left Lee&#x27;s Democratic Labour Party, standing as an independent. Scrimgeour stood as an independent against Prime Minister Peter Fraser in and polled well, reducing Fraser&#x27;s majority so that Fraser &quot;only sneaked back on a minority vote&quot;.

Albert Davy the organiser of the Independent People&#x27;s Group (IPG) or People&#x27;s Movement complained that the election was decided on &quot;strictly party&quot; lines, and said that the effect of the Democratic Labour Party standing was to give six seats to the National Party.
Two defeated Labour MPs, James Barclay and Charles Boswell, were appointed to diplomatic posts in Australia and Russia, respectively.

The election was also notable for the defeat of Āpirana Ngata a renowned Māori statesman and member for Eastern Maori after 38 years in parliament, by Rātana–Labour candidate Tiaki Omana. Labour now held all four Māori electorates and would continue to do so until 1993.

One independent was re-elected: Harry Atmore from Nelson — this was the last electoral victory by a candidate not from the major parties until the 1966 election. Atmore had the tactical support of Labour who (as in 1935 and 1938) did not stand a candidate against him, and he generally voted with Labour. The slight margin to National in Nelson on civilian votes was reversed by the service votes.

<doc id="1193070" wikidata="Q1569387" url="?curid=1193070" title="List of recently extinct mammals">
<text>Recently extinct mammals are defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as any mammals that have become extinct since the year 1500 CE. Since then, roughly 80 mammal species have become extinct.

Extinction of taxa is difficult to confirm, as a long gap without a sighting is not definitive, but before 1995 a threshold of 50 years without a sighting was used to declare extinction.

One study found that extinction from habitat loss is the hardest to detect, as this might only fragment populations to the point of concealment from humans. Some mammals declared as extinct may very well reappear. For example, a study found that 36% of purported mammalian extinction had been resolved, while the rest either had validity issues (insufficient evidence) or had been rediscovered.

As of June 2023, the IUCN listed 233 mammalian species as &quot;critically endangered&quot;, while 27% of all mammalian species were threatened with extinction.

==Conventions==
All species listed here as &quot;extinct&quot; (no known individuals remaining) are designated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Species which are &quot;extinct in the wild&quot; only reside in captivity. Species listed as &quot;possibly extinct&quot; are classified as being critically endangered, as it is unknown whether or not these species are extinct. Extinct subspecies such as the Javan tiger (&quot;Panthera tigris sondaica&quot;) are not listed here as the species, in this case &quot;Panthera tigris&quot;, is still extant. The IUCN Redlist classification for each species serves as a citation, and the superscripted &quot;IUCN&quot; by the date is a link to that species&#x27; page. A range map is provided where available, and a description of their former or current range is given if a range map is not available.

== Causes of extinction ==
Anthropogenic (human caused) habitat degradation is the main cause of species extinctions now. The main cause of habitat degradation worldwide is agriculture, with urban sprawl, logging, mining and some fishing practices close behind. The physical destruction of a habitat, both directly (deforestation for land development or lumber) and indirectly (burning fossil fuels), is an example of this.

Also, increasing toxicity, through media such as pesticides, can kill off a species very rapidly, by killing all living members through contamination or sterilizing them. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs), for example, can bioaccumulate to hazardous levels, getting increasingly dangerous further up the food chain.

Disease can also be a factor: white nose syndrome in bats, for example, is causing a substantial decline in their populations and may even lead to the extinction of some species.

Overhunting also has an impact. Terrestrial mammals, such as the tiger and deer, are mainly hunted for their pelts and in some cases meat, and marine mammals can be hunted for their oil and leather. Specific targeting of one species can be problematic to the ecosystem because the sudden demise of one species can inadvertently lead to the demise of another (coextinction) especially if the targeted species is a keystone species. Sea otters, for example, were hunted in the maritime fur trade, and their drop in population led to the rise in sea urchins—their main food source—which decreased the population of kelp—the sea urchin&#x27;s and Steller&#x27;s sea cow&#x27;s main food source—leading to the extinction of the Steller&#x27;s sea cow. The hunting of an already limited species can easily lead to its extinction, as with the bluebuck whose range was confined to and which was hunted into extinction soon after discovery by European settlers.

== Australia ==
Island creatures are usually endemic to only that island, and that limited range and small population can leave them vulnerable to sudden changes. While Australia is a continent and not an island, due to its geographical isolation, its unique fauna has suffered an extreme decline in mammal species, 10% of its 273 terrestrial mammals, since European settlement (a loss of one to two species per decade); in contrast, only one species in North America has become extinct since European settlement. Furthermore, 21% of Australia&#x27;s mammals are threatened, and unlike in most other continents, the main cause is predation by feral species, such as cats.

==Extinct species==

A species is declared extinct after exhaustive surveys of all potential habitats eliminate all reasonable doubt that the last individual of a species, whether in the wild or in captivity, has died. Recently extinct species are defined by the IUCN as becoming extinct after 1500 CE.

==Extinct subspecies==
==Extinct in the wild==
A species that is extinct in the wild is one which has been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as only known by living members kept in captivity or as a naturalized population outside its historic range due to massive habitat loss. A species is declared extinct in the wild after thorough surveys have inspected its historic range and failed to find evidence of a surviving individual.

==Possibly extinct==
Extinction of taxa is difficult to detect, as a long gap without a sighting is not definitive. Some mammals declared as extinct may very well reappear. For example, a study found that 36% of purported mammalian extinction had been resolved, while the rest either had validity issues (insufficient evidence) or had been rediscovered. As of December 2015, the IUCN listed 30 mammalian species as &quot;critically endangered (possibly extinct)&quot;.

<doc id="1193091" wikidata="Q3562735" url="?curid=1193091" title="Volcano Disaster Assistance Program">
<text>The Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) was founded by the U.S. Geological Survey and the United States Agency for International Development&#x27;s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance after the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz (Colombia) in 1985. The volcanic eruption melted a glacier triggering a lahar that killed 25,000 people. It was determined that increased monitoring and enhanced communications between scientists and civil authorities would make it easier to evacuate local populations and save lives. Today the program responds to volcanic crises around the world. The aim of the program is to assist in saving lives and property, to reduce economic losses, and to prevent a natural hazard becoming a natural disaster. VDAP staff members are based at the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory, in Vancouver, Washington. VDAP channels its energy into four main activities: response to natural disaster, capacity building, training, and volcanological research. In 2024, VDAP received the American Geophysical Union&#x27;s International Award for its sustained effort in volcanic disaster risk reduction.

==Response==
VDAP responds primarily to ‘non-domestic’ eruptions outside the United States. Since 1986, the team has responded to over 70 major events around the world. Scores of other remote responses involve consultations with the relevant local observatories. A subset of foreign responses are listed in the following table and on the map.
==Preparation and Monitoring==

Capacity building involves the development of education and monitoring in hazardous areas. VDAP staff install equipment, teach field methods, train on eruption forecasting methods and assess hazards in volcanically active areas. The work is a major focus for VDAP staff and is undertaken around the world.

==Training==

VDAP holds workshops and training courses around the world. These include volcano seismology, geodesy, remote sensing and Geographic information system (GIS) modelling. VDAP funds and assists the 8-week annual international field course run by the University of Hawaii&#x27;s CSAV (Center for the Study of Active Volcanism) in Hilo, Hawaii and Vancouver, WA. The students include geologists, geochemists and geophysicists, who receive training in the science behind volcano monitoring.

==Research==

VDAP supports projects which improve the forecasting of eruptions or better characterize the effects of previous eruptions. Examples of this include research at Pinatubo and Chaitén Volcano, Chile.

<text>Sixth Street is a historic street and entertainment district in Austin, Texas, located within the city&#x27;s urban core in downtown Austin. Sixth Street was formerly named Pecan Street under Austin&#x27;s older naming convention, which had east–west streets named after trees and north–south streets named after Texas rivers (the latter convention remains in place).

The nine-block area of West Sixth Street roughly between Lavaca Street to the west and Interstate 35 to the east is recognized as the Sixth Street Historic District and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on December 30, 1975. Developed as one of Austin&#x27;s trade and commercial districts in the late 1800s, the predominant building style are two- or three-story masonry Victorian commercial architecture. Most structures in the area had already been built by the 1880s, though a few notable exceptions include the Driskill Hotel (1886), the Scarbrough Building (1910), and the Littlefield Building.

The area around nearby 4th Street and 6th Street has been a major entertainment district since the 1970s. Many bars, clubs, music venues, and shopping destinations are located on West 6th Street between Congress Avenue and Interstate 35, and many offer live music at one time or another during the week. Traffic is generally blocked on East 6th Street and most crossroads from I-35 to Brazos Street on weekend evenings, and football home games (depending on pedestrian traffic), as well as holidays and special events, to allow the crowds to walk unfettered to the many venues that line the street.

East Sixth Street (known locally as Dirty Sixth) plays host to a wide variety of events each year, ranging from music and film festivals (such as South by Southwest) to biker rallies (such as The Republic of Texas Biker Rally) and the Pecan Street Festival.

The area of Sixth Street west of Lavaca is known as the West 6th Street District. Recently, a movement has been growing to develop this area as an entertainment district of its own, geared toward the live-music crowd.

==History==
Austin was planned on a 15-block grid plan developed by Edwin Waller that was bisected by Congress Avenue running north–south. The Bastrop Highway linking the town to earlier settlements in East Texas was charted in 1839 and chose the route into Austin along Pecan Street. The stagecoach followed this route when it arrived in Austin in 1840, and used the Bullock Hotel at the northwest corner of Pecan and Congress as the stage stop. The Bullock, built in 1839 by Richard Bullock, was a complex of log building which served as the quasiformal and informal meeting place in Austin for several years. That particular intersection quickly became the focal point of town life.

The town grew like a cross up and down Congress and Pecan. Pecan had an obvious advantage for development. The street was far enough from the river to escape flooding, which occasionally spread as far as Cypress Street (3rd Street), and it was the last east–west street flat enough for wagons and pedestrians to travel comfortably. Following an explosive growth in town population between 1850 and 1860, Pecan soon contained not only log and frame houses, but also was lined with wagon yards, livery stables, and saloons to meet the needs of travelers. Austin&#x27;s first bridge was built to carry Pecan Street across Shoal Creek in 1865, though the narrow iron footbridge, built by the United States Army, could not carry wagon traffic.

While the Civil War interrupted Sixth Street&#x27;s growth in the 1860s, the following years were the height of Sixth Street&#x27;s importance as a commercial center. The arrival of the railroad in 1871 was very much to Sixth Street&#x27;s benefit, as some of Austin&#x27;s most prestigious business enterprises were located here to be near the railroad depot. Lots along the street were in great demand and fine two- and three-story limestone Victorian commercial structures began to line the streets where one-story frame buildings or vacant lots had been. In 1887, a new, larger bridge across Shoal Creek was built to match the full width of Sixth Street and permit wagons to cross; this West Sixth Street Bridge is still in use today, and has since been added to the National Register of Historic Places.

During the late 1880s, however, Congress Avenue began to pre-empt Sixth Street as the most fashionable shopping destination in the city. The new Capitol building was being built at the head of Congress and most businesses catering to city-dwellers and/or a state government clientele moved to a Congress location. Sixth Street, though, continued to function as a site for offices, warehouses, and showrooms of businesses using the railroad, as well as to businesses catering to farmers or other travelers. In 1886, the famous four-story Driskill Hotel was completed at 122 E. 6th Street. Called &quot;the finest hotel south of St. Louis&quot;, the hotel was built in a Romanesque Revival style by Jesse Driskill, a cattleman who spent his fortune constructing it.

Scarbrough and Hicks department store, founded on the southwest corner of 6th and Congress in 1893, decided to remain in this same location in 1909 when it undertook the construction of Austin&#x27;s first modern skyscraper; the Scarbrough Building is an eight-story brick building in the Commercial style. George Littlefield chose the northeast corner of that intersection in 1911 for a 9-story brick and limestone building to be built to house his American Bank.

A biracial character was evident along Sixth Street during this period of development, although it became more pronounced in the 1890s and early 1900s. For example, a black physician had an office in the 300 block of East Sixth, and several businesses on the north side of the 400 and 500 blocks were operated by blacks and catered to Austin&#x27;s black community. By the early 20th century, racial and ethnic diversity had become one of Sixth Street&#x27;s most striking characteristics. Lebanese businesses also began to appear on 6th Street in the 1890s. One of the first Lebanese immigrants to Austin, Cater Joseph, opened a confectionery on Congress in the 1880s. The Joseph family still maintains a business on East 6th Street, as do several other Lebanese and Syrian families who founded businesses there in the early 20th century. By 1940, businesses on 6th Street were owned by blacks, Jewish, German, Chinese, and Mexican-Americans, as well.

A steady erosion of the commercial importance of the East 6th Street area occurred in the 1940s and particularly accelerated after World War II. A proliferation of second-hand stores, chain and discount stores catered to a lower-income clientele, followed by an increasing number of vacated buildings. A skid-row atmosphere was fostered in the 1950s and 1960s by the multiplying number of pawn shops, loan companies, and bars in the area. However, a number of owner-operated businesses kept the area alive for commercial activity.

One of the last residents on Sixth Street was local architect David Graeber. Graeber purchased the building at 410 E. 6th Street and made it his family&#x27;s residence until he died in 2010. The building is notable as the last building on Sixth Street to be used exclusively as a primary residence. The building&#x27;s interior was modern for the time, including an indoor swimming pool, and substantial sound mitigation.

The Ritz, a historic theater, open its doors on 320 E. 6th Street in 1929. Throughout its history, the Ritz was used as a movie theater, music hall, club, comedy house, and more. It reopened after renovations in fall 2007 as the new downtown location for the Alamo Drafthouse. On March 20, 2007, the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema announced that they would be relocating their downtown cinema, which was the original theater opened in 1997, to the Ritz. They began construction on April 1, 2007, to revive the Ritz as a movie theater.

Since May 2014, a parking ban is enforced from Thursday evening to Saturday night inside the entertainment district (Interstate 35 to San Jacinto Street) which ends at 2 a.m. past midnight which is defined as a Sunday based on the 24 hour clock) - plans to make the Sixth Street district vehicle free was considered prior to a SXSW &#x27;14 drunk driving incident back in March where several pedestrians were struck.

==Pecan Street Festival==
Until the 1970s, Sixth Street was in decline and downtown was scarcely populated, with abandoned buildings scattered about. A pioneering group of Austinites, including Dr. Emma Lou Linn, known as the Old Pecan Street Association, was instrumental in reclaiming the downtown space and starting renovation of the old buildings. The association needed adequate funding for restoration costs and bringing a street fair to life was a solution to their problems.

In 1978, the Pecan Street Festival was started and included local food and art vendors along with bands from the surrounding area, establishing a community event for cultural preservation and creativity. Due to the festival&#x27;s positive turnout, the celebration became a biannual spring and fall tradition, honoring 6th Street&#x27;s original name, Pecan Street. In the past, the event has attracted more than 300,000 people, generating an economic impact around $43 million in 2010.

<text>The Order of Polonia Restituta (, ) is a Polish state order established 4 February 1921. It is conferred on both military and civilians as well as on foreigners for outstanding achievements in the fields of education, science, sport, culture, art, economics, national defense, social work, civil service, or for furthering good relations between countries. It is Poland&#x27;s second-highest civilian state award in the order of precedence, behind the Order of the White Eagle.

The Order of Polonia Restituta is sometimes regarded as Poland&#x27;s successor to the &quot;Order of the Knights of Saint Stanislaus, Bishop and Martyr&quot;, known as the Order of Saint Stanislaus, established in 1765 by Stanisław August Poniatowski, the last King of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, to honor supporters of the Polish crown.

== History ==
When Poland regained its independence from the German Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Russian Empire in 1918, the new Polish government abolished the activities of the Order of Saint Stanislaus (Imperial House of Romanov) in the country, due to the claimed abuses of its initial rules by the Russians, who often awarded their version to those who – according to the dominant view in newly independent Poland – had been responsible for the destruction of Poland and Polish culture.

Instead, the Order of Polonia Restituta was established on 4 February 1921 with Marshal Józef Piłsudski as first Grand Master, with the proclaimed aim of once again rewarding the noble values that it originally stood for. The Marshal awarded the first recipients on 13 July 1921. The order became Poland&#x27;s main honour bestowed on foreigners, awarded by the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

After World War II both the Polish government-in-exile and the Communist People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, aligned with the Warsaw Pact, awarded the order, though the versions differed slightly. Despite communist control, the order&#x27;s prestige remained safe and it was even given to many people who were hardly model communists. The order was saved from abuse as it was simply passed over in favor of more traditional communist awards. During this time, the Order of Merit of Poland became the favored award for foreigners.

On 22 December 1990 the Polish government-in-exile returned the rights to its version of the order to the new Polish state. Invalid awards have been revoked, and today the remaining communist versions of the order hold the same status as any other issues.

=== Succession debate ===
Founded by the Polish Republic on 4 February 1921 as a secondary award to the Order of the White Eagle, the Order of Polonia Restituta, or the Order of the Restored Poland, has been alleged as an intended Polish successor to the Polish Order of Saint Stanislaus. The new Polonia Restituta order use the same ribbon as the old Saint Stanislaus order and their decorations are very similar. The goal was to preserve the tradition of the Order of Saint Stanislaus and its association with Polish history while changing the name which had become associated with Poland&#x27;s oppression under the Russian Emperors.

== Organisation ==
Among Polish civilian awards, the Order is second only to the rarely awarded Order of the White Eagle. Historically, the order entitled its recipient to a state pension. As such, nominees for the award are evaluated by a special committee responsible for upholding the honour of the order.

The Chapter () of Polonia Restituta is composed of a Grand Master and eight members appointed by the Grand Master, who serve five-year terms. Upon becoming elected the President of Poland, the office-holder is automatically awarded the order and becomes the Grand Master of the Order Chapter. The names of new recipients are published in the , a publication required to provide announcements of legal decisions to the public.

The Order of Polonia Restituta () has five classes, categorized according to the Constitution of Poland, Article 138, as follows:

=== Grand Cross ===
Order of Polonia Restituta First Class, , the Grand Cross, referred to as the Grand Cordon. 

=== Commander&#x27;s Cross with Star ===
Order of Polonia Restituta Second Class, , the Commander&#x27;s Cross with Star. 

=== Commander&#x27;s Cross ===
Order of Polonia Restituta Third Class, , the Commander&#x27;s Cross. 

=== Officer&#x27;s Cross ===
Order of Polonia Restituta Fourth Class, , the Officer&#x27;s Cross. 

=== Knight&#x27;s Cross ===
Order of Polonia Restituta Fifth Class, , the Knight&#x27;s Cross. 

== Insignia ==
The badge of the order is a gold Maltese cross enamelled in white. The obverse central disc bears a white eagle on red background, the Coat of Arms of Poland, surrounded by a blue ring bearing the words &quot;Polonia Restituta&quot;. The reverse central disc bears the year 1918 (for the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland version: 1944). It is worn on a ribbon, red with a white stripe near the edges, as a sash on the right shoulder for Grand Cross, around the neck for Commander with Star and Commander, on the left chest with rosette for Officer, and on the left chest without rosette for Knight.

The star of the order is an eight-pointed silver star with straight rays. The central disc is in white enamel, bearing the monogram &quot;RP&quot; (Republic of Poland) (for the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, &quot;PRL&quot;) and surrounded by a blue ring bearing the Latin words &quot;Polonia Restituta&quot;.

<text>The 1946 New Zealand general election was a nationwide vote to determine the shape of the New Zealand Parliament&#x27;s 28th term. It saw the governing Labour Party re-elected, but by a substantially narrower margin than in the three previous elections. The National Party continued its gradual rise.

==Background==
The Labour Party had been in government since winning the 1935 elections, and had been re-elected twice. However, the National Party had managed to overcome the internal problems which had once troubled it, and now presented a credible threat to Labour. National&#x27;s leader, Sidney Holland, was proving more effective than his predecessor, while the Prime Minister, Peter Fraser, was weary and in poor health. The after-effects of World War II, including ongoing shortages, were affecting the government&#x27;s popularity.

The next New Zealand census was scheduled for 1946, but having had to postpone the 1941 census due to WWII, the government brought it forward. The 1945 census was held on Tuesday, 25 September, so that the results could be used for the 1946 electoral redistribution prior to the planned 1946 election. In August 1945, there was a first hint that the government considered abolishing the country quota through the &quot;Electoral Amendment Act, 1945&quot;. The amendment bill was introduced on 18 October 1945 and proposed the complete abolition of the country quota and that electorates be based on adult, as opposed to total, population. The &quot;Electoral Amendment Act, 1945&quot; was given royal assent on 12 November and it reduced the number and increased the size of rural electorates. None of the existing electorates remained unchanged, 26 electorates were abolished, 19 electorates were created for the first time, and six former electorates were re-established. The 1946 electoral redistribution had to take ten years of population growth and movements into account. The North Island gained a further two electorates from the South Island due to faster population growth.

===MPs retiring in 1946===
Five Labour MPs and one National MP intended to retire at the end of the Parliament.

==Date of election==
The election should have been held earlier. The 27th parliament &quot;forgot to mark the calendar, forgot the previous election had been earlier than usual and accidentally ran for two extra months&quot;.

==The election==
The date for the main 1946 elections was 27 November, a Wednesday. Elections to the four Māori electorates were held the day before. 1,081,898 people were registered to vote, and there was a turnout of 93.5%. This turnout was the highest ever recorded at this point. The number of seats being contested was 80, a number which had been fixed since 1902.

==Election results==

===Party standings===
The 1946 election saw the governing Labour Party retain office by a four-seat margin, winning forty-two seats to the National Party&#x27;s thirty-eight. In the popular vote — Labour won 51.3% and National won 48.4%. The election was a straight fight between the two main parties (unlike the ), and only 8 of the 76 European electorates had more than two candidates. The Democratic Labour Party did not take part, and National absorbed many of the miscellaneous candidates and splinter movements. The European electorates divided equally and the Maori seats decided the issue. 

No other parties won any significant share of the vote, and no independents were elected — only 0.3% of voters did not support one of the two major parties. After Harry Atmore of Nelson died, no candidate who was not from the two main parties managed to enter Parliament until the 1966 elections, when the Social Credit Party won its first seat.

<doc id="1193132" wikidata="Q2251108" url="?curid=1193132" title="Lives of the Mayfair Witches">
<text>Lives of the Mayfair Witches is a trilogy of supernatural horror/fantasy novels by American novelist Anne Rice. It centers on a family of witches whose fortunes have been guided for generations by a spirit named Lasher. The series began in 1990 with The Witching Hour, which was followed by the sequels Lasher (1993) and Taltos (1994). All three novels debuted at No. 2 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

Some characters from the trilogy cross over to Rice&#x27;s &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot;, a series of gothic horror novels featuring the vampire Lestat de Lioncourt, specifically in &quot;Merrick&quot; (2000), &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; (2002), and &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; (2003).

A television series adaptation, &quot;Mayfair Witches&quot;, debuted on AMC and AMC+ in January 2023.
==Overview==
Susan Ferraro of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;The Witching Hour&quot; as &quot;a ghost story about an evil spirit called Lasher who is so permeated with foreboding and evil that themes like abortion and incest are merely secondary. There is Christian symbolism straight and skewed, rough sex and necrophilia.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;Rice plumbs a rich vein of witchcraft lore, conjuring ... the decayed antebellum mansion where incest rules, dolls are made of human bone and hair, and violent storms sweep the skies each time a witch dies and the power passes on.&quot; The publication called &quot;Lasher&quot; &quot;another vast, transcontinental saga of witchcraft and demonism in the tradition of Gothic melodrama.&quot; &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; described the series as &quot;half narrative, half exposition of the entire family tree&quot;. The website also noted the &quot;overuse of incest&quot; and casual treatment of horror and violence, which &quot;permeates the Gothic atmosphere.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;cutting-edge gene mapping intertwines with ancient mysteries&quot; in &quot;Taltos&quot;. Alexander Theroux of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called &quot;Taltos&quot; &quot;a dark and intimidating mystery&quot; and wrote that Rice &quot;continues the dark epic of the Mayfair witches, her saga of the occult ... that takes us on temporal and spatial journeys back through the centuries, probing plots of corruption and innocence, mortality and immortality, good and evil. The genre goes back to the Gothic novels of Ann Radcliffe and Horace Walpole, the kind of books, with their creaking armor, salivating monks and thunderstorms, satirized by Thomas Love Peacock in his &quot;Crotchet Castle&quot;.&quot;

==Characters==
Upon the death of her estranged biological mother Deirdre, California neurosurgeon Rowan Mayfair is shocked to find herself named the new designee of the Mayfair family fortune. Rowan revives drowned contractor Michael Curry, who finds that the near-death experience grants him unwanted extrasensory powers.

Michael is also one of very few people who has seen the mysterious Lasher, a ghost who haunts the Mayfairs. Lasher is described as &quot;a slim, pale, elegant figure with dark eyes and dark hair and a hypnotically seductive power over any [of the Mayfairs] reckless enough to entertain him.&quot; Lasher, whom &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; describes as &quot;devil, seducer, spirit&quot;, is a demon linked to the Mayfairs for generations. Summoned by Scottish witch Suzanne Mayfair in the 1600s, Lasher &quot;goes on to bedevil her descendants down to the present day, seeing in them the means of fulfilling his ghastly and unnatural ambitions.&quot; Under Lasher&#x27;s influence, the Mayfairs become an enormously wealthy family of witches, able to &quot;attract and manipulate unseen forces.&quot; The demon seduces each new designee and orchestrates incestuous unions among the family, with ulterior motives. Rowan is the 13th such Mayfair designee, who Lasher believes will give him his chance to rejoin the living. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called Lasher &quot;both child and man at the same time&quot;, and Patrick McGrath suggested that Lasher is actually the protagonist of &quot;The Witching Hour&quot;.

Lasher&#x27;s plan comes to fruition at the end of &quot;The Witching Hour&quot; when he invades Rowan&#x27;s unborn fetus and is reborn. The baby is genetically a non-human, ancient species called the Taltos, which is &quot;the superhuman result of the crossbreeding of two human witches who possess an extra chromosome&quot;. The infant Lasher immediately grows to adulthood, and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; describes the creature as &quot;almost a monster ... capable of beastly behavior fueled by an extraordinary sex drive.&quot; He rapes Rowan repeatedly in &quot;Lasher&quot; to create more Taltos, but the attempts end in violent miscarriages. Rowan finally conceives and gives birth to a Taltos daughter, Emaleth, but ultimately kills her. Michael fathers another Taltos with Rowan&#x27;s cousin Mona Mayfair, a daughter she names Morrigan, in &quot;Taltos&quot;.

Theroux wrote, &quot;The Mayfair witches are easily the largest dysfunctional family on earth, and yet, perhaps not surprisingly, face the same soap-opera problems of any other extended family—jealousy, sex, drink, rape, revenge, inexplicable pregnancy, sudden death, crazed children and occasional murder.&quot; Of the extended Mayfair family, McGrath noted, &quot;Mayfairs often come to bad ends, generally either burning to death or falling from high places, and we meet many members of many generations of them&quot;. Notable Mayfairs include: Julien, &quot;the genial dandy who can be in two places at once and start fires with his mind&quot; and who &quot;movingly recalls his male lovers&quot;; Stella, &quot;the flapper, wildly dancing the Charleston, the witch who just wants to have fun&quot;; her granddaughter Deirdre, &quot;whose sexual passion for Lasher is so intense that terrible old Aunt Carlotta keeps her doped to the eyeballs on Thorazine all her adult life&quot;; and Mona, the &quot;young feminist witch with sharklike business instincts&quot; who has also been described as Rowan&#x27;s &quot;13-year-old sexpot niece ... who is herself the most powerful witch of the Mayfair clan.&quot; Red haired, green eyed Mona is the &quot;ascendant character&quot; of &quot;Taltos&quot;. The novel also introduces Ashlar, an ancient Taltos living in New York, whom Theroux described as a &quot;mild seven-foot mysterioso who ... fears flying, has no soul and has a white streak of hair coming from his left temple, [and] has a brain twice the size of that of a human.&quot; Having not seen another of his kind in centuries, Ashlar is &quot;driven essentially to the job of revealing the riddle of not only who and what he is but what he wants.&quot;

==Works==

===&quot;The Witching Hour&quot; (1990)===

&quot;The Witching Hour&quot; is the first novel in Rice&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Mayfair Witches&quot; trilogy. It was published by Knopf in 1990. The Mayfairs&#x27; First Street house is based on Rice&#x27;s own antebellum mansion in New Orleans, with fictional events written as if taking place in specific locations in the real-world house. Rice bought the mansion with the advance for &quot;The Witching Hour&quot;. She called &quot;The Witching Hour&quot; &quot;a Gothic epic&quot;, and said, &quot;&quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; is a wonderful haunting novel [but it is] just the beginning. I want &quot;The Witching Hour&quot; to be as great or greater than Henry James.&quot;

====Plot====
Dr. Rowan Mayfair is a gifted neurosurgeon in San Francisco, California. When her estranged birth mother Deirdre Mayfair dies in New Orleans, she begins to learn about the old Southern family to which she belongs. Michael Curry is a contractor who specializes in the restoration of old homes while dreaming of his childhood in New Orleans and yearning to return there. Rowan gradually realizes that she has the psychic power to either save or take lives. Michael drowns but she revives him, the near-death experience triggering a new and unwanted clairvoyant ability within him. Michael and Rowan fall in love, and when he decides to return to New Orleans, she follows him to learn the secrets of her past.

Aaron Lightner, a psychic scholar and member of the Talamasca, has studied the Mayfairs from afar for decades. The matriarchal family—known to the Talamasca as the &quot;Mayfair Witches&quot;—have a long and sordid history. Among the supernatural events surrounding them is a mysterious man, seen by Michael in his childhood and by other members of the family over time. Michael is revealed to be a Mayfair cousin, he and Rowan sharing lines of descent from the male witch Julien Mayfair. Rowan and Michael marry and conceive a child. As the designee of the Mayfair legacy, Rowan assumes control of the family&#x27;s affairs. Soon the mysterious man reveals himself to her: he is Lasher, a spirit with wicked motives who has plagued the Mayfairs for centuries. His wish is to be made flesh so that he may walk the earth again in the permanent physical form of a human being, and he sets about slowly seducing Rowan.

Secretly thinking that she can outwit Lasher, Rowan sends Michael away from the house on Christmas Eve. Her plan is to bind Lasher to &quot;weak matter&quot; which she can destroy with her mental killing power, but this backfires. Lasher enters her womb and makes himself at home in the fetus. Rowan immediately goes into labor, which is violent and bloody, and Lasher enters the world as a human infant. But the hybrid baby immediately grows into a full-sized, intelligent man. Michael returns and tries to kill the creature, but Lasher is too strong and nearly drowns Michael in the pool. During this second near-death experience, Michael ends up losing the unwanted psychic sensitivity in his hands. Fearing for Michael&#x27;s life, Rowan flees to Europe with Lasher.

====Reception====
&quot;The Witching Hour&quot; debuted at No. 2 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, and remained in that position for four weeks, spending a total of 22 weeks on the list. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Patrick McGrath found Lasher&#x27;s origins &quot;intriguing&quot;, and described the many characters in the extended Mayfair family as &quot;all vividly sketched, all gloriously weird.&quot; He noted the novel&#x27;s &quot;tireless narrative energy&quot; and &quot;relentless inventiveness&quot;, but also called it &quot;bloated&quot; with repetitive storytelling. McGrath also criticized the characterization of central human characters Rowan and Michael, writing that &quot;they have both been so constructed that they hardly for a moment live or breathe except as structural elements serving specific design functions in the grand scheme.&quot; According to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, &quot;This massive tome repeatedly slows, then speeds when Rice casts off the Talamasca&#x27;s pretentious, scholarly tones and goes for the jugular with morbid delights, sexually charged passages and wicked, wild tragedy.&quot; Susan Ferraro of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the novel &quot;unquestionably absorbing&quot; but noted, &quot;At the end, it seems to stumble ... because the fiercely protective Michael does something completely out of character to make way for the denouement; ultimately what creaks loudest is not the haunted house but the plot.&quot;

===&quot;Lasher&quot; (1993)===

&quot;Lasher&quot; is the second novel in Rice&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Mayfair Witches&quot; trilogy. It was published by Knopf in 1993.

====Plot====
Rowan has disappeared and Michael, feeling betrayed by her, has sunk into a depression, helped along by the useless drugs prescribed to him after his near-drowning. The sexually adventurous Mona Mayfair, a precocious teenage cousin also descended from Julien, is a powerful witch. She seduces Michael, who snaps out of his stupor and commits himself to finding Rowan, who he is now convinced did not leave willingly. Rowan, meanwhile, is essentially Lasher&#x27;s prisoner. His first two attempts at impregnating her are failures ending in miscarriage, but he is successful the third time. Traveling with Lasher throughout Europe, Rowan manages to send DNA samples to colleagues in San Francisco. They discover that Lasher is a completely different species, later identified as a Taltos. Rowan herself has a genetic abnormality, polyploidy, or 92 chromosomes, which is probably what made Lasher&#x27;s quasi-supernatural birth at all possible in the first place.

In the past, Julien finds himself to be the only known male Mayfair witch, and learns how to manipulate the spirit Lasher. Julien impregnates numerous Mayfair women as part of Lasher&#x27;s scheme of inbreeding, which Julien believes is a means to keep power in the family but is actually the way by which Lasher hopes to resurrect himself in flesh. Rowan returns to America with Lasher, who sets out to impregnate other female members of the Mayfair family. All attempts are unsuccessful as the women immediately miscarry and hemorrhage to death. Rowan manages to escape Lasher, and after hitchhiking to Louisiana, she collapses in a field and gives birth to Emaleth, a female Taltos. Rowan&#x27;s last words to Emaleth are to find Michael, which she sets out to do, thinking that Rowan has died. Rowan is found and is rushed to a nearby hospital in a state of toxic shock. An emergency hysterectomy is performed to save her life, eliminating any chance of her ever giving birth again. She is taken home to Michael, where she remains in a deep coma.

Lasher tells Michael and Aaron his story of his past life. Born to Anne Boleyn, the second wife of Henry VIII of England, and a man from Donnelaith, Scotland, Lasher is believed to be a saint known as Ashlar. He is quickly taken away by his father, who is the son of the Earl of Donnelaith, and from there he is sent to Italy to become a priest. Lasher returns to Scotland after Elizabeth I takes the throne, and is killed there while performing Christmas Mass by followers of the Protestant reformer John Knox. His next memory is the summoning of his spirit by the witch Suzanne Mayfair in Donnelaith. When Lasher&#x27;s story is complete, Michael kills him and buries him under the great oak in the yard. Michael discovers Emaleth in Rowan&#x27;s room, feeding her mother the highly nutritious milk from her breasts. Rowan is revived, but upon seeing Emaleth before her, panics and screams at Michael to kill her. Michael refuses to, so Rowan grabs a gun and shoots her daughter in the head. Rowan immediately realizes what she has done, and crying for her daughter, insists that she be the one to bury her alongside Lasher.

====Reception====
&quot;Lasher&quot; debuted at No. 2 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, and remained in that position for three weeks, spending a total of 17 weeks on the list. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; noted of the novel, &quot;Long sections ramble without a compelling point of view, and are dampened by stock elements: clichéd wind storms, sexy witches, the endless supply of money the Talamasca has at its disposal. At times, Lasher is too much in evidence (rattling the china, gnashing his teeth) to be frightening. But embedded in this antique demonism is a contemporary tale of incest and family abuse that achieves resonance.&quot; The publication added that &quot;Rice&#x27;s characters rise above the more wooden plot machinations with an ironic and modern complexity&quot;, and that &quot;the novel is compelling through its exhaustive monumentality.

===&quot;Taltos&quot; (1994)===

&quot;Taltos&quot; is the third novel in Rice&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Mayfair Witches&quot; trilogy. It was published by Knopf in 1994.

====Plot====
Ashlar, the founder of a multi-million dollar toy corporation based in New York City, believes himself to be the last living Taltos. He is shocked to learn from his friend Samuel that a male Taltos has been seen in the glen of Donnelaith. Having buried Emaleth, Rowan exists in a semi-catatonic state. She walks, she bathes, she eats, but she does not speak and does not respond to those around her. Rowan is awakened by the news that Aaron, now excommunicated from the Talamasca and recently married into the Mayfair family, has been deliberately run over by a car. She makes plans with Michael to seek revenge on the Talamasca, who she believes are responsible for Aaron&#x27;s death. Mona discovers that she is pregnant by Michael and, after Rowan gives her blessing, ecstatically shares the news with the family. Mona later discovers that her unborn child is a Taltos, a female she names Morrigan. She runs off with Mayfair cousin Mary Jane to Fontevrault, an old plantation sunken into the marsh that has been owned by a separate branch of the Mayfair family for generations. Mary Jane&#x27;s grandmother, Dolly Jean, helps deliver the new Taltos. Mona names Morrigan the designee of the Mayfair legacy, and she and Mary Jane make plans for the future in case Rowan and Michael try to kill Morrigan.

In London, Michael and Rowan meet up with Yuri Stefano, a pupil and friend of Aaron who has also been excommunicated by the Talamasca. Through Yuri they meet the other Ashlar and his friend Samuel, who is one of the Little People of Donnelaith, dwarf-like Taltos who never fed on their mother&#x27;s milk and were subsequently stunted. Ashlar kills Anton Marcus, the Superior General of the Talamasca, for his part in Aaron&#x27;s death. Another Talamasca Scholar, Stuart Gordon, has been plotting with his pupils Marklin and Tommy to unite Ashlar with a female Taltos he has acquired. The excommunications of Aaron and Yuri, as well as Aaron&#x27;s death, were a ruse perpetrated by Stuart to keep the men from interfering with his plans. Ashlar meets the female Taltos, Tessa, and disappoints Stuart with the news that Tessa is too advanced in age to bear children. Rowan uses her strong telepathic abilities to cause Stuart to have a fatal stroke. Yuri takes Tessa to the Talamasca, who welcome Tessa with open arms and punish Marklin and Tommy by burying them alive.

In New York, Ashlar tells Rowan and Michael the story of his long life. He explains that the Taltos once thrived peacefully on a tropical island north of the British Isles, where they had been since &quot;The Time Before the Moon&quot;. The island&#x27;s semi-active volcano reawakens, forcing the Taltos to flee south to the bitter cold of Scotland. They become hunter-gatherers, and occasionally see early humans, whom they sometimes keep as pets. The Taltos break off into different tribes and the largest of them, led by Ashlar, goes south to Somerset where they settle. Their peace is often disrupted by Celtic raids on the land. To adapt and live peacefully among humans, the Taltos become the Picts, and Ashlar their king. When Christianity comes to them in the form of St Columba, Ashlar converts with more than half his tribe. But there is a conflict between the Christians and non-Christians, and war ensues. Soon only five Taltos males are left, and they all become priests, including Ashlar. Several years later, he attempts to tell his story to a fellow priest, who believes the story is blasphemy. Ashlar is disillusioned, and goes on a pilgrimage, leaving Donnelaith forever.

Rowan and Michael return to New Orleans, where Michael is introduced to his daughter, Morrigan. He and Rowan accept Mona&#x27;s decision to make Morrigan the designee. A frenzied Morrigan smells Ashlar on the gifts he has sent, just as he comes to the First Street house to visit. Morrigan rushes into his arms, and they run away together.

====Reception====
&quot;Taltos&quot; debuted at No. 2 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, and remained in that position for five weeks, spending a total of 16 weeks on the list. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;Pulsing with a persistent sense of foreboding, the novel is soggy with meandering, atmospheric prose that verges on softcore porn.&quot; Alexander Theroux of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote, &quot;because this is a novel that is empty of style and color, it is turgid with story. It is a cat&#x27;s cradle of unrealized characters, 25 or so stick figures who say things and disappear and not only are never vivid but also are never described.&quot;

==Crossovers==

Some &quot;Mayfair Witches&quot; characters cross over to Rice&#x27;s &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot;, specifically in the novels &quot;Merrick&quot; (2000), &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; (2002), and &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; (2003). &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; is a series of gothic horror novels featuring the vampire Lestat de Lioncourt. In the crossover novels, former Talamasca leader David Talbot seeks out Merrick Mayfair, an octoroon descendant of Julien Mayfair, on behalf of the vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac. Mona and Rowan Mayfair are later brought into the narrative.

===&quot;Merrick&quot; (2000)===

With the help of former Talamasca leader-turned-vampire David Talbot, Louis de Pointe du Lac asks the beautiful witch Merrick Mayfair to use her spiritual powers to contact the spirit of Claudia, a child who, like Louis, had been turned into a vampire by Lestat but was destroyed long ago. Merrick is also a former agent of the Talamasca, and shared many adventures with David in the past. Flashbacks introduce Merrick&#x27;s malevolent sister, Honey Isabella or Honey in the Sunshine; Merrick&#x27;s mother, Cold Sandra; and the Great Nananne, a powerful witch whose very presence is enough to frighten and instill respect in David. Merrick and David recall their journey to a cave in Central America which contained malevolent spirit protecting an ancient jade mask, which allows people to see spirits as if they were corporeal. Merrick retrieves Claudia&#x27;s diary from the Talamasca vaults, and makes it possible for Louis to speak with Claudia. After being made a vampire, Merrick reveals that from the beginning, she used her magic to lure David and Louis to her in hopes of receiving the Dark Gift of vampirism.

The novel introduces Merrick Mayfair, a powerful witch who is a cousin of the Mayfairs in the &quot;Mayfair Witches&quot; series.

Published on October 17, 2000, &quot;Merrick&quot; debuted at No. 2 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

===&quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; (2002)===

Tarquin &quot;Quinn&quot; Blackwood, heir to a powerful old family in New Orleans, asks for Lestat&#x27;s help to get rid of Goblin, an increasingly malevolent spirit who has plagued Quinn for his entire life. Quinn recalls his youth, his family, and his forced transformation into a vampire by Petronia. His stories allow Lestat to better understand the reach and power of Goblin, and clue in Lestat to the fact that Quinn is connected to the Mayfair family of witches. After his own failure defeating Goblin, Lestat asks Merrick for assistance. Meanwhile, Quinn has fallen in love with heiress Mona Mayfair, and the ghost of their mutual ancestor Julien Mayfair warns him against making Mona a vampire. Goblin is revealed to be the spirit of Quinn&#x27;s twin Gawain, who died days after being born. He is bound to Quinn, and is relentlessly jealous to experience whatever Quinn does. Merrick performs a ritual using Gawain&#x27;s corpse to exorcise Goblin. She sacrifices herself by carrying the child&#x27;s spirit into the hereafter with her, and Lestat is heartbroken.

The novel brings &quot;Mayfair Witches&quot; character Mona Mayfair into &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot;.

Published on October 29, 2002, &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; debuted at No. 4 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

===&quot;Blood Canticle&quot; (2003)===

Mona is slowly dying, afflicted with a mysterious disease brought on by the birth of Morrigan. Over time, Mona and Rowan reveal more and more about the powerful genetic plague that has haunted the Mayfairs for generations: their connection to the Taltos, an advanced species of human to which both women have given birth. Lestat turns a dying Mona into a vampire so that she and Quinn can be together forever. While trying to prevent Mona&#x27;s family from discovering her transformation, Lestat falls in love with the married Rowan, and she secretly pines for him as well. Mona adjusts to her new power. Lestat, Quinn and Mona arrive at the remote island colony of the Taltos, but instead of finding a secluded utopia, they discover that years of criminal intrigue and civil war have taken their toll. The remaining Taltos join the Mayfair clan in New Orleans. Mona and Quinn are instructed in the proper ways of vampirism by the ancient vampire Maharet and her twin Mekare. Rowan seeks out Lestat, half in love with him but torn by her love for her husband Michael. Exhausted by her life, she requests that he make her a vampire. Lestat declines, pained though he is, because she is a guiding force for the Mayfair family and he cannot take her away from it.

Rowan and Mona are major characters in the novel, and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; &quot;the complete unification of the Mayfair witch saga with that of the Vampire Chronicles&quot;. The publication added that &quot;the vampirization of young Mona, a true child of our times, gives Rice a dynamic new vampire personality with whom to play.&quot;

Published on October 28, 2003, &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; debuted at No. 5 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

==Adaptations==

===Audiobooks===
Random House Audio originally released abridged audiobook adaptations of all three &quot;Mayfair Witches&quot; novels on audio cassette, with narrators Lindsay Crouse (&quot;The Witching Hour&quot;), Joe Morton (&quot;Lasher&quot;), and Tim Curry (&quot;Taltos&quot;). They were re-released as a three-book &quot;Value Collection&quot; on CD in 2005, and digitally in 2013. In 2015, new unabridged audiobook adaptations were released digitally by Random House Audio for all three novels in the trilogy, performed by Kate Reading.

===Television===

Development rights to &quot;The Lives of the Mayfair Witches&quot; were still held by Warner Bros in December 2019, when Rice began shopping a package combining film and TV rights to both &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Mayfair Witches&quot;. Rice was reportedly asking around $30 to $40 million, plus a $2.5 million buyout of Warner Bros.&#x27; rights, and the new owner would hold the rights in perpetuity, not just as an option. In May 2020, it was announced that AMC had acquired the rights to &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Lives of the Mayfair Witches&quot; for developing film and television projects. Anne and Christopher Rice serve as executive producers on any projects developed. Rice said, &quot;It&#x27;s always been my dream to see the worlds of my two biggest series united under a single roof so that filmmakers could explore the expansive and interconnected universe of my vampires and witches. That dream is now a reality, and the result is one of the most significant and thrilling deals of my long career.&quot;

In December 2021, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that &quot;Anne Rice&#x27;s Mayfair Witches&quot; had been given an eight-episode series order by AMC, with another Rice series, &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, already in production at the network as part of their new Immortal Universe franchise. &quot;Mayfair Witches&quot; is written and executive produced by Esta Spalding and Michelle Ashford, and executive produced by Mark Johnson. The series stars Alexandra Daddario as Rowan Mayfair, Harry Hamlin as Cortland Mayfair, Tongayi Chirisa as Ciprien Grieve, and Jack Huston as Lasher. Recurring roles include Annabeth Gish as Deirdre Mayfair, Beth Grant as Carlotta Mayfair, Erica Gimpel as Ellie Mayfair and Jen Richards as Jojo Mayfair. The series debuted on AMC and AMC+ on January 8, 2023.

<text>Texture memory is a type of digital storage that makes texture data readily available to video rendering processors (also known as GPUs), typically 3D graphics hardware. It was sometimes implemented as specialized RAM (TRAM) that is designed for rapid reading and writing, enabling the graphics hardware increased performance in rendering 3D imagery. Modern GPUs have one kind of RAM for all kinds of buffers, although textures might still have a dedicated cache.

Larger amounts of texture memory allow for more detailed scenes.</text><links>

<doc id="1193178" wikidata="Q5370641" url="?curid=1193178" title="Emergency Rations (EP)">
<text>Emergency Rations is the second EP by American rapper Mr. Lif, released on June 25, 2002, by Definitive Jux. It was recorded at Bandulero Sound in Berlin, Boston Butta Beats in Boston, and The Pool Room in New York City.

The song &quot;Phantom&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to the 2003 video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot;.

== Music and lyrics ==
&quot;Emergency Rations&quot; is a concept album whose premise centers around Mr. Lif&#x27;s fictional kidnapping presumably by government agents. It showcases his defiant perspective on themes such as civil rights, censorship, and U.S. foreign policy. He also raps about societal ills such as gender socialization, the vapid state of pop culture, and the dehumanizing effects of capitalism. Lif&#x27;s thoughtful, confrontational lyrics are backed by Akrobatik and El-P&#x27;s dissonant production, which evokes feelings of paranoia and alienation.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Emergency Rations&quot; received positive reviews from critics. In &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Nathan Rabin highlighted the EP&#x27;s &quot;solid blast of social consciousness&quot; and wrote that it possessed &quot;a raw, unfinished quality that more than lives up to the urgency of its title&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Martin Woodside called Lif &quot;a thoughtful, often incendiary lyricist&quot;, while calling &quot;Emergency Rations&quot; &quot;a provocative, well-crafted album that proves hard to ignore.&quot; Robert Christgau from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; found Mr. Lif &quot;funny&quot; and an &quot;angry guy&quot;. According to him, Lif used the EP as both a set up for his subsequent concept album, &quot;I Phantom&quot; (2002), and as &quot;an excuse to drop random science about the place of hip hop in the military-industrial complex.&quot;

<text>Hayır Bey (sometimes spelled Kha&#x27;ir Bey or Kha&#x27;ir Beg) or Khayrbak (died 1522) ruled Egypt in the name of the Ottoman Empire from 1517 until his death in 1522. He was granted the position of governor by sultan Selim I of the Ottoman Empire for his help in the conquest of Egypt.

Being of Abkhazian origin, he was the former Mamluk governor of Aleppo who contributed to the Ottoman victory at the Battle of Marj Dabiq. After the Ottoman conquest of the Mamluks and the end of the Mamluk Sultanate, the grand vizier Yunus Pasha was made the governor of Egypt. However, after Ottoman sultan Selim I found out about Yunus Pasha&#x27;s corruption in governing, consisting of bribery and extortion, Hayır Bey was entrusted with the governorship of Egypt.

His residence was the Amir Alin Aq Palace and he built the Amir Khayrbak Funerary Complex.

He married Miṣirbāy (d. 1522), widow of sultan An-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qaitbay (r. 1496-1498) and sultan Abu Sa&#x27;id Qansuh (r. 1498-1500); according to contemporary sources, he abused her so severely that she almost died, and the couple separated.

<text>Ōpunake () is a small urban area in the North Island of New Zealand, located within the Taranaki region and governed by the South Taranaki District Council. Positioned along State Highway 45, it lies between Hāwera to the south and New Plymouth to the north. According to the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage, the Māori meaning of Ōpunake is &quot;the place of where the springs have always been&quot;.

== History ==
=== Pre-European history ===
In 1833 local chief Wiremu Kīngi Moki Te Matakātea held off a war party from Waikato for several weeks with a single musket, and eventually triumphed. The site of Te Namu Pā is along the coast, just north of the town.

=== European settlement ===
The town was first settled by Europeans in the 1860s, when British army soldiers landed at Ōpunake in April 1865 in the Second Taranaki War. By May, soldiers had constructed the Ōpunake Redoubt, where 350 soldiers were stationed. In May 1867, the redoubt was gifted to Wiremu Kīngi Moki Te Matakātea&#x27;s people, and the area became a location for flax mills, outside European influence. British soldiers re-established a presence at the redoubt in 1875, and the area became a rallying point for soldiers during the invasion of Parihaka. By circa 1887, the redoubt was abandoned. Ōpunake was intended to be a major port but, other than a jetty constructed in 1891, little else was completed.

=== Marae ===
Ōpunake has two marae.

* Ōeo Marae and Tipua Horonuku and Tipua Hororangi meeting houses are affiliated with the Ngāruahine hapū of Ngāti Tamaahuroa me Tītahi.
* Ōrimupiko Marae and Ōhinetuhirau meeting house are a meeting place for the Taranaki hapū of Ngāti Haumia, Ngāti Tamarongo and Ngāti Kahumate.

In October 2020, the Government committed $153,419 from the Provincial Growth Fund to seal the driveway of the marae and paint the outside of all buildings, creating 12 jobs.

=== Pā ===
Ōpunake is home to two pā.

* Te Namu Pā in the North West along the Otahi Stream and Te Namu road.
* As well as another pā in the South East which can be found along Park Pl near the Constabulary Cemetery by the lake. The condition of these pā vary, Te Namu Pā is mostly held up, the village and trenches no longer exist. However little remains of the pā in the South East.

==== History of Te Namu Pā ====
Wiremu Kīngi Moki Te Matakātea led 120 men in a battle at Te Namu Pā against a Waikato contingent numbering approximately 800. The Waikato raid was unsuccessful and eventually retreated; those who were left behind were cremated in front of the pā. Wiremu Kīngi Moki Te Matakātea and his men won the battle partly because of the Geography and because of the singular musket that they had. The only entrance to the pā was accessible by following the Otahi stream around the back of it along a narrow walkway. The pā was attacked 5 times by Waikato forces with no success. Te Namu Pā is also rumoured to be named &#x27;Kaiaia&#x27;.

The village that was made at Te Namu Pā in 1833 was destroyed by an landing party from HMS Alligator of 1834. The site is now considered a Urupa (Burial ground).&quot;Greg O&#x27;Brien, poet, painter, editor and journalist, remembers Te Namu&#x27;s association with Parihaka. He wrote: &quot;my mother recalls an elderly aunt&#x27;s recollection of the Parihaka siege—her description of a line of women singing, surrounding the settlement as the troops approached.) What escapes us, the land, kumara-pitted, remembers—adze heads recovered from among boulders, the faded shadows that were trenches around Te Namu pa. The site of the first fighting between British infantry—the 50th Regiment, &#x27;the Dirty Half Hundred&#x27;— and Maori.&quot;&quot;

<doc id="1193185" wikidata="Q5978711" url="?curid=1193185" title="I Phantom">
<text>I Phantom is the debut studio album by American rapper Mr. Lif. It was produced mostly by alternative hip hop artist El-P, among others, at Boston Butta Beats in Boston and the New York City-based Steel Acres, The Danger Room, and Def Jux Studios. Mr. Lif composed &quot;I Phantom&quot; as a concept album about the working life of an African American who is pressured into pursuing the dubious rewards of the American dream.

The album was released on September 16, 2002, by Definitive Jux. A widespread critical success, it was acclaimed for El-P&#x27;s sparse hip hop production and Lif&#x27;s incisive, everyman lyrics.

== Music and lyrics ==

&quot;I Phantom&quot; is a concept album described as &quot;an exploration of the dynamics of everyday life, and the pursuit of our dreams, in a rapidly decaying society.&quot; The narrative begins with death (&quot;A Glimpse at the Struggle&quot;) and resurrection (&quot;Return of the B-Boy&quot;) and ends with nuclear holocaust (&quot;Earthcrusher&quot;, &quot;Post-Mortem&quot;). The liner notes provide instructions on how the story should be followed. Mr. Lif recorded the album at Boston Butta Beats in Boston and the New York City studios Steel Acres, The Danger Room, and Def Jux Studios, in the same sessions that produced his debut extended play &quot;Emergency Rations&quot; (2002). The album features beats made by alternative hip hop producers such as Edan, DJ Fakts One, and El-P, as well as guest raps performed by Aesop Rock, Jean Grae, and Akrobatik.

&quot;I Phantom&quot; expands on the everyman persona that he debuted on &quot;Emergency Rations&quot;, of which he said in an interview for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;: &quot;We&#x27;re wasting time if we&#x27;re not talking about issues that affect us and the planet in our music. I grew up in an era when Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy and Eric B. and Rakim were dropping serious science on their records. They didn&#x27;t ignore what was going on around them at the time, and neither should we. We&#x27;re talking with each other through this music.&quot; While his debut EP was an intensely political diatribe on U.S. foreign policy and the Bush administration, &quot;I Phantom&quot; focuses more on working class black America.

== Release and reception ==

&quot;I Phantom&quot; was released by Definitive Jux on September 16, 2002, in the United Kingdom and on September 17 in the United States, where Mr. Lif had begun a national tour on September 14 to promote the record.

&quot;I Phantom&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on 12 reviews. Moira McCormick of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it &quot;a heady, lyrically dazzling, unsparing&quot; hip hop concept album told &quot;with humor, heart and a sorcerer&#x27;s way with words&quot;, while &quot;Blender&quot; deemed the record&#x27;s funk-influenced beats &quot;innovative&quot; and Lif&#x27;s rhymes &quot;engaging ... [He] brilliantly avoids the pitfalls of vacuous bling-drones and &#x27;real hip-hop&#x27; whiners alike.&quot; In &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Nathan Rabin called it &quot;really audacious and ambitious&quot;, writing that it mixes El-P&#x27;s &quot;icy B-boy futurism with Lif&#x27;s nasal-everyman flow, to powerful effect.&quot; &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau said &quot;I Phantom&quot; showed an ambitious concept, specific insight into life working and raising a family, and a critique comparable to Boots Riley. He said the &quot;musically pleasurable&quot; album &quot;fleshes out its cohesive narrative and cogent ideas with beats that respect the spare antipop ethos without abjuring such wayward rhythm elements as femme chorus, bass-drum-whoop jam, and $20 synth loop&quot;.

For the annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, Christgau voted &quot;I Phantom&quot; as the 15th best album of 2002. &quot;Kludge&quot; ranked it at number seven on the magazine&#x27;s list of the year&#x27;s 100 best records.

<text>East Gloucestershire, formally the Eastern division of Gloucestershire and often referred to as Gloucestershire Eastern, was a parliamentary constituency in Gloucestershire, represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elected two Members of Parliament (MPs) using the bloc vote system.

The constituency was created when the Great Reform Act split Gloucestershire into eastern and western divisions, with effect from the 1832 general election.

Under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, East Gloucestershire was abolished from the 1885 election, when the former eastern and western divisions were replaced by five new single-seat county constituencies: Cirencester, Forest of Dean, Stroud, Tewkesbury, and Thornbury.

== Boundaries ==
1832–1885: The Hundreds of Crowthorne and Minety, Brightwell&#x27;s Barrow, Bradley, Rapsgate, Bisley, Longtree, Whitstone, Kiftsgate, Westminster, Deerhurst, Slaughter, Cheltenham, Cleeve, Tibaldston, Tewkesbury, and Dudstone and King&#x27;s Barton, and also the City and County of Gloucester and the Borough of Cirencester.

The constituency was the eastern division of the historic county of Gloucestershire, in South West England.

The place of election was at Gloucester. This was where the hustings were situated and electors voted by spoken declaration in public, before the secret ballot was introduced in 1872.

The qualification to vote in county elections, in the period when this constituency operated, was to be a 40 shilling freeholder.

The parliamentary borough constituencies of Cheltenham, Cirencester, Gloucester, Stroud, and Tewkesbury were all located in East Gloucestershire. Qualified freeholders from those boroughs could vote in the county division. Bristol was a &quot;county of itself&quot;, so its freeholders qualified to vote in the borough, not in any county division.

<doc id="1193200" wikidata="Q918747" url="?curid=1193200" title="Louisville and Nashville Railroad">
<text>The Louisville and Nashville Railroad , commonly called the L&amp;N, was a Class I railroad that operated freight and passenger services in the southeast United States.

Chartered by the Commonwealth of Kentucky in 1850, the road grew into one of the great success stories of American business. Operating under one name continuously for 132 years, it survived civil war and economic depression and several waves of social and technological change. Under Milton H. Smith, president of the company for 30 years, the L&amp;N grew from a road with less than of track to a system serving fourteen states. As one of the premier Southern railroads, the L&amp;N extended its reach far beyond its namesake cities, stretching to St. Louis, Memphis, Atlanta, and New Orleans. The railroad was economically strong throughout its lifetime, operating freight and passenger trains in a manner that earned it the nickname, &quot;The Old Reliable&quot;.

Growth of the railroad continued until its purchase and the tumultuous rail consolidations of the 1980s which led to continual successors. By the end of 1970, L&amp;N operated of road on of track, not including the Carrollton Railroad.

In 1971 the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, successor to the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, purchased the remainder of the L&amp;N shares it did not already own, and the company became a subsidiary. By 1982, the Seaboard Coast Line had absorbed the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad entirely. Then in 1986, the Seaboard System merged with the C&amp;O and B&amp;O (known as the Chessie System) and the combined company became CSX Transportation (CSX), which now owns and operates all of the former Louisville and Nashville lines.

==Early history and Civil War==
Its first line extended barely south of Louisville, Kentucky, and it took until 1859 to span the 180-odd miles () to its second namesake city of Nashville. There were about of track in the system by the outbreak of the Civil War, and its strategic location, spanning the Union/Confederate lines, made it of great interest to both governments.

During the Civil War, different parts of the network were pressed into service by both armies at various times, and considerable damage from wear, battle, and sabotage occurred. (For example, during the Battle of Lebanon in July 1863, the company&#x27;s depot in Lebanon, Kentucky, was used as a stronghold by outnumbered Union troops). However, the company benefited from being based in Kentucky, a southern border state that initially had competing Unionist and Confederate state governments, but with Bowling Green (the latter&#x27;s capital) and Nashville falling to Union forces within the first year of the war, remaining in their hands for the war&#x27;s duration. The company profited from Northern haulage contracts for troops and supplies, paid in sound Federal greenbacks, as opposed to the rapidly depreciating Confederate dollars. After the war, other railroads in the South were devastated to the point of collapse, and the general economic depression meant that labor and materials to repair its roads could be had fairly cheaply.

Buoyed by these fortunate circumstances, the firm began an expansion that never really stopped. Within 30 years the network reached from Ohio and Missouri to Louisiana and Florida. By 1884, the firm had such importance that it was included in the Dow Jones Transportation Average, the first American stock market index. It was such a large customer of the Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works, the country&#x27;s second-largest locomotive maker, that in 1879 the firm presented L&amp;N with a free locomotive as a thank-you bonus.

Beginning in 1858 and continuing throughout its history, the primary repair shops for rolling stock were located in Louisville, Kentucky. The first shops were acquired from the Kentucky Locomotive Works in 1858. However, this location could not be expanded, so a new tract of land was purchased in 1904 at the south side of the city. The new shops featured a central, 920-foot long transfer table that connected the main buildings. From that year until the 1920s, the South Louisville Shop built many of its own locomotives as well as repairing them. The shops in Decatur, Alabama were used to build most of the system&#x27;s freight cars. The only other significant shops were located in Howell, Indiana, built in 1889.

==Coal and capital in the Gilded Age==
Since all locomotives of the time were steam-powered, many railroads had favored coal as their engines&#x27; fuel source after wood-burning models were found unsatisfactory. The L&amp;N guaranteed not only its own fuel sources but a steady revenue stream by pushing its lines into the difficult but coal-rich terrain of eastern Kentucky, and also well into northern Alabama. There the small town of Birmingham had recently been founded amidst undeveloped deposits of coal, iron ore and limestone, the basic ingredients of steel production. The arrival of L&amp;N transport and investment capital helped create a great industrial city and the South&#x27;s first postwar urban success story. The railroad&#x27;s access to good coal enabled it to claim for a few years starting in 1940 the nation&#x27;s longest unrefuelled run, about from Louisville to Montgomery, Alabama.

In the Gilded Age of the late 19th century there were no such things as anti-trust or fair-competition laws and very little financial regulation. Business was a keen and mean affair, and the L&amp;N was a formidable competitor. It would exclude upstarts like the Tennessee Central Railway Company from critical infrastructure like urban stations. Where that wasn&#x27;t possible, as with the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway (which was older than the L&amp;N), it simply used its financial muscle—in 1880 it acquired a controlling interest in its chief competitor. A public outcry convinced the L&amp;N directors that there were limits to their power. They discreetly continued the NC&amp;StL as a separate subsidiary, but now working with, instead of in competition with, the L&amp;N.

Ironically, in 1902 financial speculations by financier J.P. Morgan delivered control of the L&amp;N to its rival Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, but that company did not attempt to control L&amp;N operations, and for many decades there were no consequences of this change.

The L&amp;N also attempted an expansion into foreign trade, through investments into the Export Coal Company, and the creation of a wholly owned subsidiary the &quot;Gulf Transit Company&quot; in 1895. This operated three ships, the SS &quot;Pensacola&quot;, the SS &quot;August Belmont&quot;, and the SS &quot;E. O. Saltmarsh&quot;. The venture ended with the sale of the &quot;Pensacola&quot; in 1906 and the selling off of the remaining assets in 1915.

==20th century==

The World Wars placed heavy demand on the L&amp;N. Its widespread and robust network coped well with the demands of war transport and production, and the resulting profits harked back to the boost it had received from the Civil War. In the postwar period, the line shifted gradually to diesel power, and the new streamlined engines pulled some of the most elegant passenger trains of the last great age of passenger rail, such as the &quot;Dixie Flyer&quot;, the &quot;Humming Bird&quot;, and the &quot;Pan-American&quot;.

Though well past its 100th anniversary, the line was still growing. The railroad retired its last steam locomotive, a J-4 class 2-8-2 Mikado #1882, from active service on January 28, 1957. Also in that year, the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis was finally fully merged. In the 1960s, acquisitions in Illinois allowed a long-sought entry into the premier railroad of Chicago, and some of the battered remains of the old rival, the Tennessee Central, were sold to the L&amp;N as well.

In 1971 the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, successor to the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, purchased the remainder of the L&amp;N shares it did not already own, and the company became a subsidiary. Prior to the purchase, the L&amp;N, like other railroads, had curtailed passenger service in response to dwindling ridership. Amtrak, the government-formed passenger railway service, took over the few remaining L&amp;N passenger trains in 1971. In 1979, amid great lamentations in the press, the last passenger service over L&amp;N rails ceased when Amtrak discontinued &quot;The Floridian&quot;, which had connected Louisville with Nashville and continued to Florida via Birmingham.

By 1982, as the railroad industry consolidated, the Seaboard Coast Line absorbed the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad entirely. The merged company was known as &quot;SCL/L&amp;N&quot;, &quot;Family Lines&quot;, and was depicted as such on the railroad&#x27;s rolling stock. During the next few years several smaller acquisitions resulted in the creation of the Seaboard System Railroad. Yet more consolidation was ahead, and in 1986, the Seaboard System merged into the C&amp;O/B&amp;O combined system known as the Chessie System. The combined company became CSX Transportation (CSX), which now owns and operates all of the former Louisville and Nashville lines, except for some routes abandoned or sold off.

==Legacy==
Several historical groups and publications devoted to the line exist, and L&amp;N equipment is well represented in the model railroading hobby. The L&amp;N Railroad is mentioned by country music pioneer Jimmie Rodgers in his &quot;Blue Yodel #7&quot;. It is also the subject of the 2003 Rhonda Vincent bluegrass song &quot;Kentucky Borderline&quot;, as well as &quot;The L&amp;N Don&#x27;t Stop Here Anymore&quot; by Jean Ritchie and individually performed by Michelle Shocked, Johnny Cash, Billy Bragg &amp; Joe Henry, and Kathy Mattea. Dutch blues/rock band The Bintangs had a hit in the Dutch charts in the late 1960s with &quot;Ridin&#x27; on the L&amp;N&quot; (a cover from the Dan Burley/Lionel Hampton composition from 1946). This composition also was covered by John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers. The L&amp;N is also mentioned in the Lost Dog Street Band song “Last Train”, written by Benjamin Tod, from their 2024 album &quot;Survived&quot;.

In 1926 the L&amp;N turned over approximately 137 acres to the Kentucky State Park Commission, making possible the creation of the state&#x27;s Natural Bridge State Park.

==Passenger operations==

The &quot;Humming Bird&quot; and &quot;Pan-American&quot;, both from Cincinnati to New Orleans and Memphis, were two of the L&amp;N&#x27;s most popular passenger trains that ran entirely on its own lines. However, the Humming Bird later added a Chicago to New Orleans section in conjunction with the Chicago &amp; Eastern Illinois Railroad utilizing the &quot;Georgian&quot; north of Nashville. (The Official Guide of the Railroads, February 1952) The railroad also hosted other named trains, including:

* &quot;Azalean&quot; (Cincinnati – New Orleans) (had through Pullman Company Sleeping Cars between Cincinnati and New York over the Pennsylvania Railroad) ran combined with the &quot;Washington – Atlanta – New Orleans Express&quot; (New York – New Orleans in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Railroad, Southern Railway and the West Point Route); these trains combined south of Montgomery.
* Pre-Amtrak &quot;Crescent&quot; (New York – New Orleans in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Railroad, Southern Railway and the West Point Route)
* &quot;Dixie Flagler&quot; (Chicago – Miami in conjunction with the Chicago &amp; Eastern Illinois Railroad, Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway, Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and the Florida East Coast Railway)
* &quot;Dixie Flyer and Dixie Limited&quot; (Chicago and St. Louis to Jacksonville in conjunction with the Chicago &amp; Eastern Illinois Railroad, Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway, Central of Georgia Railway and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad)
* &quot;Dixieland&quot; (Chicago – Miami in conjunction with the Chicago &amp; Eastern Illinois Railroad, Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway, Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and the Florida East Coast Railway)
* &quot;Dixiana&quot; (Chicago – Miami in conjunction with the Chicago &amp; Eastern Illinois Railroad, Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway, Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and the Florida East Coast Railway)
* &quot;Flamingo&quot; (Cincinnati – Jacksonville in conjunction with the Central of Georgia Railway, Atlantic Coast Line)
* &quot;Florida Arrow&quot; (seasonal train, Chicago – Louisville – Birmingham – Miami in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Railroad, Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and the Florida East Coast Railway) 

* &quot;Georgian&quot; (Originally St. Louis – Atlanta, later changed to Chicago-Atlanta in conjunction with the Chicago &amp; Eastern Illinois Railroad and the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway)
* &quot;Gulf Wind&quot; (New Orleans – Jacksonville in conjunction with the Seaboard Air Line Railroad)
* &quot;Piedmont Limited&quot; (New York – New Orleans in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Railroad, Southern Railway and the West Point Route)
* &quot;Southland&quot; (Chicago – St. Petersburg, Tampa and Miami in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Railroad, Central of Georgia Railway and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. The Wabash Railroad had a connection in Fort Wayne, for trips from Detroit.)
* &quot;South Wind&quot; (Chicago – Miami in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Railroad, Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and the Florida East Coast Railway)

The L&amp;N was one of few railroads to discontinue a passenger train that was en route. On January 9, 1969, as soon as a judge lifted the injunction preventing its discontinuance, the L&amp;N discontinued its southbound &quot;Humming Bird&quot; at Birmingham, in mid-run from Cincinnati to New Orleans. The 14 passengers continuing south did so by bus.

==Preservation==
There are several preservation organizations of L&amp;N equipment and L&amp;N lines, such as the Kentucky Railway Museum, The Historic Railpark and Train Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and the L&amp;N Historical Society.

The city of Atlanta, Georgia, is home to the General and the Texas, two 4-4-0 locomotives originally built for the Western and Atlantic Railroad, which was later leased to L&amp;N predecessor Nashville, Chattanooga, and St. Louis. The lease of the W&amp;A was passed to, and renewed by, L&amp;N and its successors. The General and the Texas became famous for being participants in The Great Locomotive Chase during the Civil War. The General had been placed on display in the railroad&#x27;s Union Depot in Chattanooga in 1901. In 1957, the L&amp;N removed the engine and restored it to operating condition. The engine pulled the railroad&#x27;s wooden center-door Jim Crow combine coach No. 665 as it traveled throughout the eastern U.S. as part of the observance of the Civil War Centennial, including a visit to the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Between 1966 and 1971, a legal battle ensued between the railroad and the city of Chattanooga as the former had planned to send the engine to Georgia, while the latter claimed to be the owners of the engine. After the dispute was settled, the engine was formally presented to the state of Georgia in 1971. The engine currently resides at the Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History in Kennesaw, Georgia, while the Texas is currently at the North Carolina Transportation Museum in Spencer, North Carolina undergoing restoration for inclusion into an addition to house it and the cyclorama painting of the battle of Atlanta. The Texas should return to Georgia in late 2016.

The Kentucky Railway Museum consists of many pieces of L&amp;N equipment, as well as a portion of the Lebanon Branch. The museum owns the following L&amp;N equipment: K2A Light Pacific 4-6-2 No. 152, a steam locomotive; heavyweight coaches Nos. 2572 and 2554; an observation car; heavyweight combine No. 1603; combine coach No. 665; sleeper the &quot;Pearl River&quot;, the Pullman heavyweight 10 section sleeper-lounge &quot;Mt. Broderick&quot; which was assigned to the L&amp;N but owned and operated by Pullman; several baggage cars; a steam-powered crane; and E-6 diesel locomotive No. 770. All of the last seven pieces of equipment listed need restoration.

The Historic Railpark and Train Museum owns or operates several pieces of L&amp;N equipment, including an E-8 diesel locomotive, a Railway Post Office car, dining car No. 2799, a sleeping car, an observation car, along with a Jim Crow combine in need of major overhaul.

Several other museums own L&amp;N equipment, including the Bluegrass Railroad Museum.

L&amp;N 2132, a South Louisville Shops steam locomotive, is also on static display in Corbin, Kentucky. 2132 was moved from Bainbridge, Georgia to Corbin and underwent a full cosmetic restoration. Along with 2132 and her tender is L&amp;N caboose 1056.

The &quot;Wilderness Road Trail&quot; is a rail trail built on the ROW from Cumberland Gap National Historical Park to Ewing, Virginia.

<text>Hāwera is the second-largest centre in the Taranaki region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, with a population of . It is near the coast of the South Taranaki Bight. The origins of the town lie in a government military base that was established in 1866, and the town of Hāwera grew up around a blockhouse in the early 1870s.

Hāwera is 75 kilometres south of New Plymouth on State Highway 3 and 30 minutes&#x27; drive from Mount Taranaki. It is located on State Highway 45, known as Surf Highway 45 for its numerous surf beaches. State Highway 45 passes through Manaia, Ōpunake and Oakura en route to New Plymouth. Kaponga is a 20-minute drive to the north-west. The Marton–New Plymouth Line railway passes through Hāwera and has served the town since 1 August 1881, though it has been freight-only since the cancellation of the last railcar passenger service between Wellington and New Plymouth on 30 July 1977.

==History==

===Pre-European history===

The Māori-language name means &quot;burnt place&quot;; it arose as a result of fighting between two local sub-tribes, which culminated in the setting ablaze of the sleeping whare (house) of the tribe under attack. An older Māori name was , referring to the patatē or seven-finger tree &quot;Schefflera digitata&quot;. Spelled &quot;Hawera&quot; for most of its European history, a macron was added to the official name by the New Zealand Geographic Board in June 2019.

===European settlement===

The town&#x27;s name meaning &quot;burnt place&quot; became apt when the town suffered extensive blazes in 1884, 1888, and 1912.

For this reason a large water tower was built in the centre of town to increase water pressure; and this became one of Taranaki&#x27;s best-known landmarks (appearing, for example, on the cover of the 1974 telephone directory). After falling into disrepair the tower was closed to the public in 2001, but after an extensive restoration programme it opened again in 2004.

===Marae===

There are four marae in the Hāwera area:

* Ngātiki Pa, is affiliated with Taanga’oe Hapū of Hāmua and Hawe.
* Te Rangatapu Marae and its Aorangi meeting house are affiliated with the Ngāruahine hapū of Kanihi-Umutahi and Ōkahu-Inuāwai.
* Taiporohēnui Marae and its Whareroa meeting house are affiliated with the Ngāti Ruanui hapū of Hāmua and Hāpōtiki.
* Wharepuni Marae and its Tūpaia meeting house are affiliated with the Ngāti Ruanui hapū of Ngāti Tānewai and Ngāti Tūpaea.

In October 2020, the Government committed $1,479,479 from the Provincial Growth Fund to renovate Meremere Marae, Ketemarae Pā, Pariroa Marae and Taiporohēnui Marae, creating 35 jobs.

<text>Satawan Atoll is an atoll located about southeast of Chuuk Lagoon proper.
Geographically it is part of the Nomoi or Mortlock Islands in the Carolines and administratively it is part of Chuuk State in the Federated States of Micronesia. About 3,000 people live on a land area of .

A Japanese airfield was located on the atoll during World War II.

==Administrative divisions==
Satawan Atoll administratively consists of four of the 40 municipalities of Chuuk State, named after the principal islets:
*Satowan (Satawan) (east)
*Ta (south)
*Kuttu (Kutu) (west)
*Moch (More) (north)

Satowan and Ta municipalities are statistically grouped with the &quot;Lower Mortlocks&quot;, and Kuttu and Moch municipalities with the &quot;Mid Mortlocks&quot;.

Satawan Atoll had a population of 2,935 . Satawan Atoll is located at and has a total area of (including the lagoon), but a land area of only .

==History==
Captain James Mortlock was sailing from Port Jackson to Whampoa in &quot;Young William&quot; when he rediscovered two sets of islands on 19 and 27 November 1795. Confusingly, both were later called Mortlock Islands.

During World War II the Japanese garrison on the Mortlock Islands, under the command of Colonel Masatake Tobita, consisted of 753 IJA men including a company of six medium tanks and 257 IJN men including air base crew. Some World War II relics left by the Japanese can be found on Satawan. These include tanks (which may be seen on the main road), a few small planes, (the island was at one point home to a Japanese airstrip), and stone look-out posts along the north east coast. One can walk from Satawan to Ta via the reef at low tide. Near the end that is towards the island called Ta is a large cannon left over from the Japanese that points out into the ocean.

== Description ==
There are an elementary school and a high school that serve the islanders. There is no regular electricity, running water. Solar electricity is available at the local high school, Mortlock High School. Satowan now also has a satellite internet connection available. Until May 2010, the only transportation to this island was a fishing boat carrying freight called the Nomasepi. About once a month it did a six-day circuit around the Mortlocks from Weno, but for now has been stopped. The cost of the six-day round trip was 40 dollars. Now there are a few more travel options to and from Satowan. The Micronesian Navigator and Carolina Voyager are large cargo/passenger ships that sail to and from Pohnpei and Weno, Chuuk, stopping along the Mortlock Islands as well. The fee for regular passengers is $12 one way from Satowan to Weno. There are smaller, local cargo ships named Queen and Midas Neuvich that sail to Satowan much more regularly. Midas is the most regular, usually stopping by Satowan every two weeks or so. As far as air travel, one could fly to the neighboring island of Ta from Weno, Chuuk or Pohnpei. Caroline Islands Air is the only airline service in the area. The airline lands at Mortlock Islands Airfield on a concrete runway next to Ta Village along the south side of Satawan. Upon arrival one would have to ride a motorboat for about twenty minutes to reach Satowan. Currently, flights from Weno to Ta cost $190 while flights from Pohnpei to Ta cost $240. Additionally, about three gallons of fuel is needed to reach Satowan from Ta. Or one could simply walk to Satowan from Ta during low tide, which takes anywhere from 1.5 to 3 hours. Each island has its own local constitution which currently allows for a Mayor and Deputy Mayor. The only taxes are a 5 dollar fee per year for owning a dog. According to local estimates as of May 2010, the population is between 400 and 700.
