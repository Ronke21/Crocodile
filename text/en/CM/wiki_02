<text>In physics, the electric displacement field (denoted by D), also called electric flux density, is a vector field that appears in Maxwell&#x27;s equations. It accounts for the electromagnetic effects of polarization and that of an electric field, combining the two in an auxiliary field. It plays a major role in the physics of phenomena such as the capacitance of a material, the response of dielectrics to an electric field, how shapes can change due to electric fields in piezoelectricity or flexoelectricity as well as the creation of voltages and charge transfer due to elastic strains.
In any material, if there is an inversion center then the charge at, for instance, formula_1 and formula_2 are the same. This means that there is no dipole. If an electric field is applied to an insulator, then (for instance) the negative charges can move slightly towards the positive side of the field, and the positive charges in the other direction. This leads to an induced dipole which is described as a polarization. There can be slightly different movements of the negative electrons and positive nuclei in molecules, or different displacements of the atoms in an ionic compound. Materials which do not have an inversion center display piezoelectricity and always have a polarization; in others spatially varying strains can break the inversion symmetry and lead to polarization, the flexoelectric effect. Other stimuli such as magnetic fields can lead to polarization in some materials, this being called the magnetoelectric effect.

== Definition ==

The electric displacement field &quot;D&quot; is defined asformula_3where formula_4 is the vacuum permittivity (also called permittivity of free space), E is the electric field, and P is the (macroscopic) density of the permanent and induced electric dipole moments in the material, called the polarization density.

The displacement field satisfies Gauss&#x27;s law in a dielectric:
formula_5 

In this equation, formula_6 is the number of free charges per unit volume. These charges are the ones that have made the volume non-neutral, and they are sometimes referred to as the space charge. This equation says, in effect, that the flux lines of D must begin and end on the free charges. In contrast formula_7, which is called the bound charge, is an effective density of the charges that are part of a dipole. In the example of an insulating dielectric between metal capacitor plates, the only free charges are on the metal plates and dielectric contains only dipoles. The net, unbalanced bound charge at the metal/dielectric interface balances the charge on the metal plate. If the dielectric is replaced by a doped semiconductor or an ionised gas, etc, then electrons move relative to the ions, and if the system is finite they both contribute to formula_6 at the edges.

D is not determined exclusively by the free charge. As E has a curl of zero in electrostatic situations, it follows that
formula_9

The effect of this equation can be seen in the case of an object with a &quot;frozen in&quot; polarization like a bar electret, the electric analogue to a bar magnet. There is no free charge in such a material, but the inherent polarization gives rise to an electric field, demonstrating that the D field is not determined entirely by the free charge. The electric field is determined by using the above relation along with other boundary conditions on the polarization density to yield the bound charges, which will, in turn, yield the electric field.

In a linear, homogeneous, isotropic dielectric with instantaneous response to changes in the electric field, P depends linearly on the electric field,
formula_10
where the constant of proportionality formula_11 is called the electric susceptibility of the material. Thus
formula_12
where is the relative permittivity of the material, and is the permittivity.

In linear, homogeneous, isotropic media, &quot;ε&quot; is a constant. However, in linear anisotropic media it is a tensor, and in nonhomogeneous media it is a function of position inside the medium. It may also depend upon the electric field (nonlinear materials) and have a time dependent response. Explicit time dependence can arise if the materials are physically moving or changing in time (e.g. reflections off a moving interface give rise to Doppler shifts). A different form of time dependence can arise in a time-invariant medium, as there can be a time delay between the imposition of the electric field and the resulting polarization of the material. In this case, P is a convolution of the impulse response susceptibility &quot;χ&quot; and the electric field E. Such a convolution takes on a simpler form in the frequency domain: by Fourier transforming the relationship and applying the convolution theorem, one obtains the following relation for a linear time-invariant medium:
formula_13
where formula_14 is the frequency of the applied field. The constraint of causality leads to the Kramers–Kronig relations, which place limitations upon the form of the frequency dependence. The phenomenon of a frequency-dependent permittivity is an example of material dispersion. In fact, all physical materials have some material dispersion because they cannot respond instantaneously to applied fields, but for many problems (those concerned with a narrow enough bandwidth) the frequency-dependence of &quot;ε&quot; can be neglected.

At a boundary, formula_15, where &quot;σ&quot;f is the free charge density and the unit normal formula_16 points in the direction from medium 2 to medium 1.

== History ==

The earliest known use of the term is from the year 1864, in James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s paper &quot;A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field&quot;. Maxwell introduced the term D, specific capacity of electric induction, in a form different from the modern and familiar notations.

It was Oliver Heaviside who reformulated the complicated Maxwell&#x27;s equations to the modern form. It wasn&#x27;t until 1884 that Heaviside, concurrently with Willard Gibbs and Heinrich Hertz, grouped the equations together into a distinct set. This group of four equations was known variously as the Hertz–Heaviside equations and the Maxwell–Hertz equations, and is sometimes still known as the Maxwell–Heaviside equations; hence, it was probably Heaviside who lent D the present significance it now has.

== Example: Displacement field in a capacitor ==
Consider an infinite parallel plate capacitor where the space between the plates is empty or contains a neutral, insulating medium. In both cases, the free charges are only on the metal capacitor plates. Since the flux lines D end on free charges, and there are the same number of uniformly distributed charges of opposite sign on both plates, then the flux lines must all simply traverse the capacitor from one side to the other. In SI units, the charge density on the plates is proportional to the value of the D field between the plates. This follows directly from Gauss&#x27;s law, by integrating over a small rectangular box straddling one plate of the capacitor:

On the sides of the box, dA is perpendicular to the field, so the integral over this section is zero, as is the integral on the face that is outside the capacitor where D is zero. The only surface that contributes to the integral is therefore the surface of the box inside the capacitor, and hence
formula_17
where &quot;A&quot; is the surface area of the top face of the box and formula_18 is the free surface charge density on the positive plate. If the space between the capacitor plates is filled with a linear homogeneous isotropic dielectric with permittivity formula_19, then there is a polarization induced in the medium, formula_20 and so the voltage difference between the plates is
formula_21
where &quot;d&quot; is their separation.

Introducing the dielectric increases &quot;ε&quot; by a factor formula_22 and either the voltage difference between the plates will be smaller by this factor, or the charge must be higher. The partial cancellation of fields in the dielectric allows a larger amount of free charge to dwell on the two plates of the capacitor per unit of potential drop than would be possible if the plates were separated by vacuum.

If the distance &quot;d&quot; between the plates of a &quot;finite&quot; parallel plate capacitor is much smaller than its lateral dimensions
we can approximate it using the infinite case and obtain its capacitance as
formula_23

<text>Corporal Theodore William Henry Veale VC (11 November 1892 – 6 November 1980) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Veale was 23 years old, and a private in the 8th (Service) Battalion, Devonshire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 20 July 1916 east of High Wood, France, Private Veale, hearing that a wounded officer (one Lt Eric Humphrey Savill) was lying in the open within 50 yards of the enemy, went out and dragged him into a shell hole and then took him water. As he could not carry the officer by himself, he fetched volunteers, one of whom was killed almost at once, and heavy fire necessitated leaving the wounded man in a shell hole until dusk when Private Veale went out again with volunteers. When an enemy patrol approached, he went back for a Lewis gun with which he covered the party while the officer was carried to safety.

He later achieved the rank of corporal. His VC is displayed at The Keep Military Museum, Dorchester, Dorset.

<text>Warkworth Hermitage is a chapel and priest&#x27;s house built onto and within a cliff-face on the north bank of the River Coquet in Northumberland, England, close to Warkworth Castle and the village of Warkworth.

The hermitage consists of an outer portion built of stone and an inner portion hewn from the sandstone cliff above the river. This inner part comprises a chapel and a smaller chamber, each having an altar. There is an altar-tomb with a female effigy in the chapel.

From the window between the inner chamber and the chapel, and from other details, the date of the work is placed in the latter part of the fourteenth century, the characteristics being late Decorated. The traditional story of the origin of the hermitage, attributing it to one of the Bertrams of Bothal Castle in this county, is told in Bishop Percy&#x27;s 1771 ballad &quot;The Hermit of Warkworth&quot;. The ballad is fiction as the chapel was built as a chantry and occupied by a series of clergy from 1489 to 1536; since that time it has remained as it is today.

The carving in the window is a nativity scene; the female is Mary with the newborn child at her breast. The item at her feet is the head of a bull, and the figure at her shoulder is an angel.

Warkworth Hermitage is in the care of English Heritage, who provide its only public access, a ferry boat from the riverside path below the castle. The ferry point is about upstream from the castle. The hermitage, which English Heritage manages together with the castle, is open to the public during the summer season.

==In Art and Literature==
Besides Bishop Percy&#x27;s ballad mentioned above, the hermitage is the subject of Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poetical illustration &quot;Warkworth Hermitage&quot; to an engraving of a painting by Thomas Allom, published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1836.

<text>Marie Odee Johnson (July 23, 1897 – September 25, 2004) was an American who was one of the last surviving female veterans from the First World War. As a Yeoman (F), Johnson was among the first group of women to serve in the United States Navy in a non-nursing capacity.

== Biography ==
Marie Odee Johnson was born in Quincy, Illinois, but her family moved to Dallas, Texas, when she was an infant. She was serving as a secretary with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in Dallas when the United States entered World War I. Two of her brothers joined the Armed Forces and her sister was a Red Cross Nurse. The Navy recruiting office was near her office and the men who worked there convinced her that she would have a better job in the Navy. Johnson joined up at age 20. She didn&#x27;t tell her &quot;single parent father&quot; that she joined at first. However, when she told her father that &quot;he&#x27;d have to put a fourth star in the window&quot; he congratulated her.

Johnson was one of 12,000 women (other than nurses) who worked for the Navy &quot;handling clerical duties in the United States to free men for fighting.&quot; Johnson was stationed in New York City and Washington, D. C. during the war. She recalls that there were no facilities or barracks for women in the Navy at the time and so she and the other Yeomen were given $90 a month for room and board on top of their $30 a month salary.

She returned to her job with the FBI in Dallas afterwards. In 1926, she married Edward C. Johnson, a World War I veteran of the Army, and they had one daughter, Marilyn, together. Edward Johnson died in 1948. In 1997, she was interviewed for &quot;Life Magazine&quot;.

Johnson moved into the Transitional Care Unit in the Dallas Veterans Affairs Medical Center in 1998. She was &quot;the acknowledged &#x27;queen bee&#x27; of the veterans&#x27; facility. Johnson died in her sleep in at the age of 107. She was the last female World War I Veterans in North Texas when she died.

<text>Colonel Sir Charles Geoffrey Vickers, VC (13 October 1894 – 16 March 1982) was an English lawyer, administrator, writer and pioneering systems scientist. He had varied interests with roles at different times with the London Passenger Transport Board, Law Society, Medical Research Council and Mental Health Research Fund. In the later years he wrote and lectured on social systems analysis and the complex patterns of social organisation. The Sir Geoffrey Vickers Memorial Award has been presented by the International Society for the Systems Sciences since 1987 in his memory.

He was awarded the Victoria Cross in World War I while serving in The Sherwood Foresters, and was knighted following World War II, during which he served as Deputy Director General at the Ministry of Economic Warfare, in charge of economic intelligence and as a member of the Joint Intelligence Committee.

==Biography ==

===Early life===
Geoffrey Vickers was born and grew up in Nottingham, where his father Charles Henry Vickers ran a successful lace business, Vickers &amp; Hine Ltd. He described his first day of school as &quot;school introduced me to the anguish reserved both for the non-conformist who wishes to conform and the awkward who long to excel in dexterity&quot;. He attended Bramcote, a preparatory school near Scarborough and then Oundle School; a public school before entering Merton College, Oxford where he briefly studied Classics from 1913 until the start of war.

He later described his home as &quot;a place of unalloyed happiness. The only stresses of the time came from the external world of school or the internal world of awakening conflict and confusion ... I remember nothing desired that was satisfied by spending money of mine and nothing that was denied for lack of money ... we moved by bicycle and bus, played in each other&#x27;s gardens and stayed in farmhouses&quot;. He described his father as &quot;the best and most lovable man I ever knew; and he seemed to combine the two superlatives without the slightest effort&quot;.

===World War I===


His education was interrupted by World War I. He and his brother William Burnell Vickers volunteered for service in the army. Geoffrey joined the Sherwood Foresters (7th Robin Hood Battalion) and was in France before the end of 1914 first as a second lieutenant, promoted to temporary captain in 1915 and then to major and as second in command, 1 Bn, The Lincolnshire Regiment in 1918. Explaining his thoughts about going to war, he later wrote

He was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) for action in October 1915 and the Croix de Guerre (Belgium) in 1918. The citation for his VC, appearing in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; in November 1915, reads as follows:

His brother Burnell was killed in action on 21 June 1917 while serving with the 184th Siege Battery of the Royal Garrison Artillery.

In June 1918 he commanded a composite battalion in the Second Battle of the Marne for which he was awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre.

===Inter-war years===
After the war he returned to Oxford and took a pass degree in French, European history and law in 1919. He qualified as a solicitor in 1923 and by 1926 he was a partner in the leading London law firm of Slaughter and May. He specialised in the legal aspects of large financial operations, many of which had international dimensions. In 1930 he was one of the first to take the five-day Imperial Airways commercial flight from the UK to India and during the 1930s he was also involved in negotiating the extension of the German debt.

In 1938 he established and chaired the &#x27;Association for Service and Reconstruction. The above initiative put him in touch with a number of people who met regularly in a group called &#x27;The Moot&#x27; that also included Joe Oldham, Karl Mannheim, Reinhard Niebuhr, Paul Tillich, John Middleton Murry, T. S. Eliot, Michael Polanyi, Sir Walter Moberly and Adolph Lowe. The Moot itself grew out of a conference on Church, Community and State held in Oxford in 1937.

===World War II===
Vickers served in World War II; he was re-commissioned as a colonel, and was seconded as Deputy Director General at the Ministry of Economic Warfare, in charge of economic intelligence. From 1941 to 1945 he was a member of the Joint Intelligence Committee of the Chiefs of Staff.

He was also a member of the London Passenger Transport Board (1942–46) and of the Council of Law Society (1938–50).

===Afterwards===
After the war, Vickers had a successful career in management and administration before becoming a prolific writer and speaker on the subject of social systems analysis and the complex patterns of social organisation. He wrote many books including The &quot;Art of Judgement&quot;, &quot;Freedom in a rocking Boat&quot; and &quot;Human Systems are Different&quot;. He introduced the concept of &#x27;Appreciative Systems&#x27; to describe human activity. His work was taken up by researchers at the Open University in particular.

From 1946 to 1948 he was also first Legal Advisor to the National Coal Board. At the time of creation on 1 January 1947 when some 750,000 workers from 800 different private companies became part of the largest employer in the western world where he worked alongside E. F. Schumacher. Afterwards he became a member of National Coal Board in charge of manpower, training, education, health and welfare (1948–55).

From 1952 until 1960 he was member of the Medical Research Council and was chairman of the Research Committee of Mental Health Research Fund from 1951 to 1967. In 1977 he was president of the Society for General Systems Research, now the International Society for the Systems Sciences.

Between 1955 and 1958 he took part in the &#x27;Round Table on Man and Industry&#x27;, a project sponsored by the School of Social Work at the University of Toronto, the conclusions of which were published in &quot;The Undirected society&quot;. On the inside jacket cover he muses &#x27;The Industrial band-wagon rolls ever faster onwards, remaking the world we live in and with it ourselves. Are we in the driving seat or merely passengers – or even under the wheels? What part does human decision making play in directing or controlling the process?&#x27;.

His second wife, and close companion, died in 1972. His manuscripts for &#x27;Western Culture and Systems Thinking&#x27; and &#x27;Autonomy and Responsibility&#x27; were constantly rejected for publication.

In 1977 he moved to a retirement home, on the same street in Goring-on-Thames on which he had lived for many years.
Geoffrey died in 1982; however, the influence for his work is still alive. The International Society for the Systems Sciences presents the Sir Geoffrey Vickers Memorial Award each year in his memory. His military medals were left to the Sherwood Foresters Collection and are on display in Nottingham Castle. His papers relating to systems thinking are archived at the Open University.

==Systems practice==
In the later years Vickers wrote and lectured on the subject of social systems analysis and the complex patterns of social organisation. His work was taken up by researchers at the Open University in particular. Vickers is regarded as a systems practitioner rather than an academic. He introduced the concept of appreciative systems to describe human activity. He recognised that appreciation of systems requires the participation of not only the observer, but also that of the subject.

===Appreciative systems and appreciative behaviour ===
Much of his work is devoted to the analysis of judgement in terms of what he called &#x27;appreciative behaviour&#x27;: this is described most effectively in &quot;The Art of Judgement&quot; (1965). He believed that social institutions are best analysed as systems, and his published work, notably &quot;Human Systems are Different&quot; (1983), made far-reaching contributions to systems thinking in its applications to human society.

Vickers coined the term &quot;appreciative system&quot; in his 1968 article &quot;Science and the Appreciative System&quot; to refer to &quot;the activity of attaching meaning to communication or the code by which we do so&quot;. In &quot;Human Systems are Different&quot; (1983) Vickers explained: 
I find it surprising that we have no accepted word to describe the activity of attaching meaning to communication or the code by which we do so, a code which is constantly confirmed, developed or changed by use. I have for many years referred to this mental activity as &quot;appreciation&#x27;; and to the code which it uses, as its &quot;appreciative system&#x27;; and to the state of that code at any time as its &quot;appreciative setting&#x27;. I call it a system because, although tolerant of ambiguity and even inconsistency, it is sensitive to them and tries to reconcile them.

In a 1978 interview Vickers added: 
I&#x27;m interested in Systems from the personal up to the very large, human, social systems, I&#x27;m also interested in systems of concepts and values through which we see all the others which I call appreciative systems.

A response by Peter Checkland in his &quot;Systems Thinking Systems Practice&quot;: 
Vickers argues that our human experience develops within us &#x27;readiness to notice particular aspects of our situation, to discriminate them in particular ways and to measure them against particular standards of comparison...&#x27; These readinesses are organized into an appreciative system which creates for all of us, individually and socially, our appreciated world...The appreciative settings condition new experience but are modified by the new experience. Such circular relations Vickers takes to be the common facts of social life, but we fail to see this clearly, he argues, because of the concentration in our science-based culture on linear causal chains and on the notion of goal-seeking. Vickers suggests replacing the goal-setting and goal-seeking with feedback models in which personal, institutional or cultural activity consists in maintaining desired relationships and eluding undesired ones. The process is a cyclical one which operates like this: Our previous experiences have created for us certain &#x27;standards&#x27; or &#x27;norms&#x27;, usually &#x27;tacit&#x27; (and also, at a more general level, &#x27;values&#x27;, more general concepts of what is humanly good and bad); the standards, norms and/or values lead to readiness to notice only certain features of our situations, they determine what &#x27;facts&#x27; are relevant; the facts noticed are evaluated against the norms, a process which leads to our taking regulatory action and modifies the norms or standards, so that future experiences will be evaluated differently.

Geoffrey Vickers continued corresponding with Peter Checkland in the years before Vickers&#x27; death and discussed the relationship between systems ideas and real-world experience. From those discussions Checkland created the model of the appreciative process, that may be used as a basis for making sense of the world we live in. Checkland (2004) worked on numerous examples to demonstrate the way in which the model may be applied in very different situations.

=== Moral and political philosophy ===
Geoffrey Vickers&#x27; perspectives on moral and political philosophy can be presented through three key terms: 
* Our human capacity to respond aptly to our situation;
* The analysis of modern society in terms of institutions; and
* The moral importance of responsibility to the maintenance of human culture and cooperation

<doc id="1191151" wikidata="Q805708" url="?curid=1191151" title="Baltic Exchange">
<text>The Baltic Exchange (incorporated as The Baltic Exchange Limited) is a membership organisation for the maritime industry, and freight market information provider for the trading and settlement of physical and derivative contracts.

Situated since Edwardian times at 24-28 St Mary Axe, London EC3, the building was destroyed by a bomb in 1992. The Baltic Exchange then relocated to 38 St Mary Axe on 15 May 1995, before establishing its headquarters at 77 Leadenhall Street in the City of London as well as further offices in Europe, across Asia, and in the United States.

== Overview ==
Its international community of 650 member companies encompasses the majority of world shipping interests and commits to a code of business conduct overseen by the Baltic Exchange: its members are responsible for a large proportion of all dry cargo and tanker fixtures as well as the sale and purchase of merchant vessels.

The Baltic Exchange traces its roots back to 1744 at the &quot;Virginia and Baltick Coffee House&quot; on Threadneedle Street, near the Royal Exchange. With the rapid expansion of Britain&#x27;s network of global trade, London&#x27;s mercantile coffee houses operated as a maritime commercial node for communication and business. As British influence in trade to Virginia began to wane after American Independence, focus shifted to Russian Empire and other emerging markets.

Incorporated as a private limited company with shares owned by its members on 17 January 1900, the Baltic Exchange was acquired in November 2016 by the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and remains headquartered in London.

The exchange provides daily freight market prices and maritime shipping cost indices which are used to guide freight traders as to the current level of various global shipping markets, as well as being used to set freight contract rates and settle freight futures (known as Forward Freight Agreements or FFAs). Historically operating on its trading floor, Baltic members&#x27; transactions are nowadays primarily conducted via other means of communication (&quot;eg&quot;. telephone, e-mail, instant messaging &quot;etc&quot;), although face-to-face client meetings remain integral to building trust.

The exchange is the source of market-wide information and publishes seven daily indices made up from a suite of wet and dry bench-marked time-charter and voyage routes:
* Baltic Dry Index (BDI)
* Baltic Panamax Index (BPI)
* Baltic Capesize Index (BCI)
* Baltic Supramax Index (BSI)
* Baltic Handysize Index (BHSI)
* Baltic Dirty Tanker Index (BDTI)
* Baltic Clean Tanker Index (BCTI)
* Baltic LNG Tanker Index (BLNG)

In April 2018, the Baltic Exchange announced a global container index called the Freightos Baltic Index (FBX) in partnership with Freightos. Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) assessments launched in 2019.

The exchange also provides forward curves, a dry cargo fixture list, sale and purchase values, LPG &amp; LNG assessments, daily market news, and the market settlement data for freight derivative contracts.

===BIFFEX===
BIFFEX, the Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange, was a London-based exchange for trading ocean freight futures contracts with settlement based on the Baltic Freight Index. It started trading dry cargo freight futures contracts in 1985, and was modestly successful for some years. All contracts were cleared by the ICCH (International Commodities Clearing House), later renamed London Clearing House and now LCH.Clearnet. A tanker freight futures contract was introduced in 1986, but never became popular and was suspended indefinitely the same year. Volumes in the dry cargo contracts dwindled over the years, and the contracts ceased trading due to lack of liquidity in 2001.

==Baltic Exchange management==

As of 2023, the Baltic Exchange&#x27;s management comprises:
* Chairman: Guy Hindley
* Chief Executive: Mark Jackson
* Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary: Mark Read
* Chief Commercial Officer: Janet Sykes
* Communications Manager: Bill Lines.

==Premises==

The exchange was historically located at 24–28 St Mary Axe in the City of London until it was destroyed in 1992 by a terrorist bomb attack.

The grandeur of the Baltic&#x27;s interior is depicted by Finnemore&#x27;s engraving in 1918 of its Exchange Hall (&quot;ie.&quot; trading floor).

Now based at 77 Leadenhall Street, London EC3, the Baltic Exchange has further offices in Europe, Asia, and the United States.

Past chairmen include:
*Frank Emil Fehr (1937-1939)

<text>Major-General William John Vousden, (20 September 1848 – 12 November 1902) was a Scottish officer in the Indian Army, and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==

Vousden was born in Perth, Scotland the son of Captain Vousden, and was educated at Kings School Canterbury.

He trained at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned into the 35th (Royal Sussex) Regiment of Foot in 1864. Promoted to lieutenant in 1867, and to captain in 1876, he transferred to the 5th Punjab Cavalry where he served in the Jowaki Expedition 1877–78.

===Victoria cross===
He was 34 years old, and a captain in the 5th Punjab Cavalry, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War when the following deed took place on 14 December 1879 on the Koh Asmai Heights, near Kabul, Afghanistan, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross:
===Further military service===
He continued to serve in the 5th Punjab Cavalry, was promoted to major in 1884, and took part in further fighting on the North-West Frontier region, for which he was mentioned in despatches on 8 June 1891 and 26 January 1898. He was promoted to the brevet rank of colonel in July 1894 and the substantive rank of Colonel of the Indian Staff Corps in January 1899. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1900.

In April 1901 he took a command in the Punjab Frontier Force with the temporary rank of brigadier-general, and shortly thereafter he was granted the local rank of major general.

He was appointed to act as Inspector General of Cavalry in India from October 1901, in the absence in South Africa of Colonel Edward Locke Elliot, and received the temporary rank of major general while officiating as such. Following the end of the war in South Africa, Elliott returned in late 1902, and Vousden stepped down.

He retired from the army on 1 November 1902, and died in India of dysentery only two weeks later, on 12 November 1902 at the age of 54.

==Family==
Vousden married, in 1891, a daughter of Major-General Drummond.

<doc id="1191164" wikidata="Q2025703" url="?curid=1191164" title="Crick, Northamptonshire">
<text>Crick is a village in West Northamptonshire in England. It is close to the border with Warwickshire, east of Rugby and northwest of Northampton. The villages of Crick and West Haddon were by-passed by the A428 main road from Rugby to Northampton when the Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal (DIRFT) was built in 1996. The terminal is a short distance east of junction 18 of the M1 motorway, which is next to Crick. Crick&#x27;s population in the 2001 census was 1,460, increasing to 1,886 at the 2011 census.

==History==
Crick takes its name from the Brittonic Celtic word for &quot;hill&quot;, &quot;cruc&quot;. There are many similar examples across Wales, for example Crughywel, Crug Mawr and Crickadarn. Crack&#x27;s Hill () is about northeast of the village, next to the canal, and gives good views of Crick, Yelvertoft, West Haddon and Rugby from the top. Kilsby and Crick railway station was located west of the village between 1881 and 1960.

==Notable buildings==
The Historic England website contains details of a total of 48 listed buildings in the parish of Crick, all of which are Grade II except for St Margaret&#x27;s Church which is Grade I. Details of some of these are as follows:

===St Margaret’s Church, Church Street===
This building was erected in a perpendicular style in the 14th and 15th centuries, incorporating some 12th-century work. It includes a nave, two aisles, north sacristy, south porch and west tower. The walls are constructed of coursed ironstone and limestone rubble, with coursed ironstone and sandstone in the tower. The roofs are of tile and lead. There is a Romanesque sandstone font, whose base consists of three crouching figures. It was restored in 1840 by RC Hussey, and thus contains a number of elements from that era.

===Ex-Servicemen&#x27;s Club, Church Street===
This property was built in a Gothic Revival style in 1847 as a school with an attached teacher&#x27;s house. The walls are of red and blue brick with ironstone dressings. The octagonal bell turret has a small spire.

===Vyntner&#x27;s Manor, Watford Road===
This house has a datestone which may read 1694. It is built of coursed squared ironwork, with a tile roof and brick and stone stacks. The bay window on the left-hand side has a datestone reading 1925, when extensions and internal remodelling took place.

==Facilities==
Crick has a Post Office and a Co-Op. There are three public houses, the &#x27;Royal Oak&#x27;, the &#x27;Wheatsheaf&#x27; and the &#x27;Red Lion&#x27;. The Ex-Servicemen&#x27;s Club is a members-only club. Currently the nearest railway station is at Rugby, away. However the proposed Rugby Parkway will be nearer, east.

==Canal==

The Leicester Line of the Grand Union Canal passes just east of Crick, and the village is well known for its canal marina and annual Crick Boat Show.

Crick canal tunnel is close to the south-east of the village and is long.

== Schools ==
Crick Primary School is on Main Road and most clearly visible from Bury Dyke. Details of a series of reports on the school can be found in the relevant section of the Ofsted website. There were 143 pupils on the roll at the time of the inspection in October 2011.

Secondary school children living in the village generally attend Guilsborough School in Guilsborough, Lawrence Sheriff School for Boys, Rugby High School for Girls or Rugby School.

<text>Almarian William Decker (born 1852, Ohio; d. Aug. 1893, Sierra Madre, California; interred Sierra Madre Pioneer Cemetery) was an American pioneer of electrical engineering involved in the early development of three-phase electrical power. In 1892 he was hired by H. H. Sinclair and Henry Fisher of the Redlands Electric Light and Power Company, a Californian generating company, to design a new three-phase generator for the Mill Creek No. 1 hydroelectric plant. The plant opened in 1893 and is still in operation today (2004). This was the first commercial application of three-phase electrical power in the United States and probably the world. Its success led to the widespread adoption of three-phase power, in preference to single-phase and direct current.

Decker was also hired by Prof. Thaddeus Lowe of the Mount Lowe Railway which opened in Altadena, California in 1893. Decker was responsible for the daily supervision of the electrical installations on the railway, and had also computed the electrical requirements for the Great Incline operating system, even considering a series of rechargeable batteries since there was such a lack of resources for hydroelectric generation. Decker suffered from tuberculosis which left him so weak that he had to be ferried out to the work sites in a wheelbarrow daily to oversee the electrical installations. He died a little more than a month after the railroad opened.

Many of Decker&#x27;s theories of electrical methodology were underestimated during his life, and it wasn&#x27;t until after his death that his theories were put to test and proved applicable.

<text>Sir Walter James Womersley, 1st Baronet (5 February 1878 – 15 March 1961) was a British Conservative Party politician who served as Minister of Pensions during the Second World War.

He was born in Marley Street, Bradford, Yorkshire, the son of a carter. His working life started in mill as a 10-year-old, working half-time. He became a senior partner in a Grimsby firm of jewellers and merchants. He became Mayor of the town in 1922.

At the 1924 general election Womersley was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Grimsby constituency. He served as a Junior Lord of the Treasury and Parliamentary Private Secretary to Sir Kingsley Wood. He was Assistant Postmaster General from 1935 until 1939. He was known as &quot;Fish Womersley&quot; for his championing of fishermen.

As Minister of Pensions from 1939, he was the only government minister to hold the same office throughout World War II, but lost his seat in the 1945 general election and was the last Conservative MP for the constituency of Grimsby constituency, until the General Election of 12 December 2019, when Lia Nici was elected as a Conservative. He was knighted in 1934 and received a baronetcy in the 1945 resignation honours. In 1946 he was awarded the Order of the Dannebrog for services to the Danish fishing industry and fishermen, especially during the War.

His daughter, Dorothy Moseley (1911–2003), was also active in politics, at a local government level in Market Harborough, Leicestershire.

<doc id="1191172" wikidata="Q5216183" url="?curid=1191172" title="Dangling bond">
<text>In chemistry, a dangling bond is an unsatisfied valence on an immobilized atom. An atom with a dangling bond is also referred to as an immobilized free radical or an immobilized radical, a reference to its structural and chemical similarity to a free radical.

When speaking of a dangling bond, one is generally referring to the state described above, containing one electron and thus leading to a neutrally charged atom. There are also dangling bond defects containing two or no electrons. These are negatively and positively charged respectively. Dangling bonds with two electrons have an energy close to the valence band of the material and those with none have an energy that is closer to the conduction band.

== Properties ==
In order to gain enough electrons to fill their valence shells (see also octet rule), many atoms will form covalent bonds with other atoms. In the simplest case, that of a single bond, two atoms each contribute one unpaired electron, and the resulting pair of electrons is shared between them. Atoms that possess too few bonding partners to satisfy their valences and that possess unpaired electrons are termed &quot;free radicals&quot;; so, often, are molecules containing such atoms. When a free radical exists in an immobilized environment (for example, a solid), it is referred to as an &quot;immobilized free radical&quot; or a &quot;dangling bond&quot;.
A dangling bond in (bulk) crystalline silicon is often pictured as a single unbound hybrid sp3 orbital on the silicon atom, with the other three sp3 orbitals facing away from the unbound orbital. In reality, the dangling bond unbound orbital is better described by having more than half of the dangling bond wave function localized on the silicon nucleus, with delocalized electron density around the three bonding orbitals, comparable to a p-orbital with more electron density localized on the silicon nucleus. The three remaining bonds tend to shift to a more planar configuration. It has also been found in experiments that Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra of amorphous hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H) do not differ significantly from the deuterated counterpart, a-Si:D, suggesting that there is hardly any backbonding to the silicon from hydrogen on a dangling bond. It also appeared that the Si-Si and Si-H bonds are about equally strong.

=== Reactivity ===
Both free and immobilized radicals display very different chemical characteristics from atoms and molecules containing only complete bonds. Generally, they are extremely reactive. Immobilized free radicals, like their mobile counterparts, are highly unstable, but they gain some kinetic stability because of limited mobility and steric hindrance. While free radicals are usually short-lived, immobilized free radicals often exhibit a longer lifetime because of this reduction in reactivity.

=== Magnetic ===
The presence of dangling bonds can lead to ferromagnetism in materials that are normally magnetically inactive, such as polymers and hydrogenated graphitic materials. A dangling bond contains/consists of an electron and can thus contribute its own net (para)magnetic moment. This only happens when the dangling bond electron does not pair its spin to that of another electron. 
Ferromagnetic properties in various carbon nanostructures can be described using dangling bonds and may be used to create metal-free organic spintronics and polymeric ferromagnetic materials (see Applications). Creating dangling bonds with unpaired electrons can, for example, be achieved by cutting or putting large mechanical strain on a polymer. In this process, covalent bonds between carbon atoms are broken. One electron can end up on each of the carbon atoms that originally contributed to the bond, leading to two unpaired dangling bonds.

=== Optical ===

A dangling bond adds an extra energy level between the valence band and conduction band of a lattice. This allows for absorption and emission at longer wavelengths, because electrons can take smaller energy steps by moving to and from this extra level. The energy of the photons absorbed by or emitted from this level is not exactly equal to the energy difference between the bottom of the conduction band and the dangling bond or the top of the valence band and the dangling bond. This is due to lattice relaxation which causes a Franck-Condon shift in the energy. This shift accounts for the difference between a tight-binding calculation of these energy differences and the experimentally measured energies.

Another way in which the presence of dangling bonds affects the optical properties of a material is via polarization. For a material with dangling bonds, the absorption intensity depends on the polarization of the absorbed light. This is an effect of the symmetry in which the dangling bonds are distributed over the surface of the material. The dependence only occurs up to the energy at which an electron can be excited to the level of the gap but not to the valence band. This effect along with the polarization dependence disappearing after the dangling bonds have been annealed, shows that it is an effect of the dangling bonds and not just of the general symmetry of the material.

== Induced ==
In hydrogenated silicon, dangling bonds can be induced by (long) exposure to light. This causes a decrease in the photoconductivity of the material. (This is the most named explanation for the so-called Staebler-Wronski effect.) The mechanism of this is thought to be as follows: The photon energy is transferred to the system which causes the weak Si-Si bonds to break, leading to the formation of two bound radicals. The free electrons being localized and being very close together is an unstable state, so hydrogen atoms “move” to the site of the breakage. This causes the electrons to be delocalized further apart which is a more stable state. For a hydrogen content of around 10%, the dangling bonds from only a very small fraction of displaced hydrogen atoms can lead to observable EPR signal increases. The diffusion of hydrogen plays a key role in the process and explains why long illumination is required. It has been found that illumination under increased temperatures increases the rate at which light-induced dangling bonds form. This can be explained by the increased hydrogen diffusion.

It is thought that the formation mechanism of intrinsic dangling bonds (in hydrogenated silicon) is very similar to that of light induced dangling bonds, except that the energy source is heat rather than photons. This explains why the intrinsic dangling bond density is negligible at room temperature. 

Light can also induce dangling bond formation in materials with intimately related valence alternation pairs (IVAP), such as &quot;a&quot;-As2S3. These IVAP defects consist of a dangling bond containing two electrons (D−) and a dangling bond containing no electrons (D+). When one of these pairs is illuminated, it can capture an electron or an electron hole resulting in the following reactions:

&quot;D+D− + e− → D0D−&quot;

&quot;D+D− + h+ → D+D0&quot;

Here, D0 is an uncharged dangling bond.

== Surface ==

Surfaces of silicon, germanium, graphite (carbon) and germanium-silicide are active in EPR measurements. 
Mainly group 14 (formerly group IV) elements show EPR signals from a surface after crushing. Crystals of elements from groups 13 to 15 prefer to have the (110) plane exposed as a surface. On this surface, an atom of group 13 has 3/4 dangling bond, and an atom of group 15 has 5/4 dangling bond. Because of dehybridization of surface orbitals (caused by the decreased number of nearest neighbor atoms around the surface atom), a group 13 atom will have a largely unfilled dangling orbital since it has valence 3 and makes three bonds, while a group 15 atom will have a fully occupied dangling orbital at the surface. In that case, there is hardly any unpaired electron density, which results in a weak EPR signal for such materials. 
Clean cleaved surfaces of such materials form paired electron localized states on alternate sites resulting in a very weak to no EPR signal. Not well-cleaved surfaces and microcracks obtained from crushing, cleaving, abrading, neutron or high-energy ion irradiation or heating and rapid cooling in vacuum give a measurable EPR signal (a characteristic signal in Si at g = 2,0055). The presence of oxygen and hydrogen gas affects the EPR signal from microcracks by affecting the single electron spin centers. The gas molecules can get trapped and, when staying close to a spin center, affect the EPR signal. When a microcrack is sufficiently small, the wave functions of the dangling bond states extend beyond the surface and can overlap with wave functions from the opposite surface. This can create shear forces in the crystal surface, causing atom layers to realign while creating dangling bonds in the process.

Due to the reactivity of dangling bonds, the semiconductor native oxide will form due to adsorption of gas molecules, the only remaining dangling bonds are located at oxygen vacancies. Dangling bonds form an sp3-hybridized bond with the adsorbed molecule, which have a metallic character. They are often the only defect sites present on atomic semiconductors, which provide such &quot;soft centers&quot; for molecules to adsorb to. When no gas adsorption is possible (for example for clean surfaces in vacuum), the surface energy can be reduced by reorganizing bonding electrons, creating lattice strain in the process. In case of the (001) surface plane of silicon, a single dangling bond on each atom will be formed, while pairing the other electron with a neighboring atom. 
Removal of dangling bond surface states on the silicon (001) surface from the band gap can be achieved by treatment of the surface with a monolayer of selenium (alternatively, sulfur was proposed). Selenium can attach to the silicon (001) surface and can bind to surface dangling bonds, bridging between silicon atoms. This releases the strain in the silicon surface and terminates the dangling bonds, covering them from the outside environment. 
When exposed, dangling bonds can act as surface states in electronic processes.

== In semiconductors ==
Some allotropes of silicon, such as amorphous silicon, display a high concentration of dangling bonds. Besides being of fundamental interest, these dangling bonds are important in modern semiconductor device operation. Hydrogen introduced to the silicon during the synthesis process is well known to saturate most dangling bonds, as are other elements such as oxygen, making the material suitable for applications (see semiconductor devices).

The dangling bond states have wave functions that extend beyond the surface and can occupy states above the valence band. The resulting difference in surface and bulk Fermi level causes surface band bending and the abundancy of surface states pins the Fermi level.

For the compound semiconductor GaAs, stronger electron pairing is observed at the surface, making for almost filled orbitals in arsenic and almost empty orbitals for gallium. Consequently, the dangling bond density at the surface is much lower and no Fermi level pinning occurs.

In doped semiconductors, surface properties are still dependent on the dangling bonds, since they occur in a number density of around 1013 per square centimeter, compared to dopant electrons or holes with a number density of 1014 to 1018 per cubic centimeter which are thus much less abundant on the material surface.

== Passivation (silicon photovoltaics) ==

By definition, passivation is a treatment process of the surface of the layers to reduce the effects of the surrounding environment. In photovoltaics (PV) technology, passivation is the surface treatment of the wafer or thin film in order to reduce the surface and some of the bulk recombination of the minority carriers. There are two main ways to passivate the surface of the silicon wafer in order to saturate the dangling bonds: field-effect passivation of the surface with a dielectric layer of SiOx, also known as \Atalla passivation&quot;, and hydrogen passivation, which is one of the chemical methods used for passivation.

=== Hydrogen passivation ===

Hydrogen passivation is one way to saturate these dangling bonds. This passivation process is carried out by one of the following mechanisms: deposition of a thin film from silicon nitride SiNx on the top of the polycrystalline silicon layer, or passivation by remote plasma hydrogen passivation (RPHP). In the latter method, hydrogen, oxygen, and argon gases react inside the chamber, then, the hydrogen is dissociating to the atomic hydrogen under the plasma condition to diffuse into the silicon interface to saturate the dangling bonds. This saturation reduces the interface defect state, where the recombination takes place.

=== Dielectric layer passivation ===

Passivation by a dielectric layer on the top of crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafer, also called &quot;tunnel passivation&quot; is one of the passivation techniques used most widely in PV technology. This technique combines both chemical passivation and field-effect passivation. This strategy is based on the formation of a dielectric layer (mostly silicon dioxide SiO2, aluminum oxide Al2O3, or silicon nitride (SiNx) on the top of the c-Si substrate be the mean of thermal oxidation or other deposition techniques such as atomic layer deposition (ALD). In the case of the formation of SiOx by thermal oxidation, the process acts as chemical passivation since, on the one hand, the formation of the oxide layer reacts with the dangling bonds on the surface wherein it reduces the defects states at the interface. On the other hand, since there are fixed charges (Qf) in the dielectric film, these fixed charges establish an electric field that repels one type of charge carrier and accumulates the other type at the interface. This repletion assures reducing one type of the charge carriers concentration at the interface wherein the recombination decreases.

== Applications ==

=== Catalysis ===
In experiments by Yunteng Qu et al., dangling bonds on graphene oxide were used to bind single metal atoms (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) for applications in catalysis. Metal atoms were adsorbed by oxidizing metal from a foam and coordinating the metal ions to the dangling bonds on the oxygen of the graphene oxide. The resulting catalyst had a high density of catalytic centers and showed high activity, comparable to other non-noble metal catalysts in oxygen reduction reactions while maintaining stability in a wide range of electrochemical potential, comparable to Pt/C electrodes.

=== Ferromagnetic polymers ===
An example of an organic ferromagnetic polymer is presented in an article by Yuwei Ma et al.: by cutting with ceramic scissors or stretching a piece of Teflon tape, a network of strongly coupling dangling bonds arises on surfaces where the polymer was broken (from cutting or in strain-induced cavities). In the case of weak structural deformation, where only very few dangling bonds are formed, the coupling is very weak and a paramagnetic signal is measured in EPR analysis. 
Annealing Teflon under an argon atmosphere at 100 °C to 200 °C results also in ferromagnetic properties. However, annealing close to the melting temperature of Teflon makes the ferromagnetism disappear. 
Under longer air exposure, the magnetization is reduced due to adsorbed water molecules. It also appeared that no ferromagnetism would develop under annealing Teflon under water steam or cutting in a H2 environment.

=== Computational chemistry ===
In computational chemistry, a dangling bond generally represents an error in structure creation, in which an atom is inadvertently drawn with too few bonding partners, or a bond is mistakenly drawn with an atom at only one end.

<text>Arthingworth is a civil parish and village in the West Northamptonshire area of the county of Northamptonshire, England. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 238.

The villages name probably means, &#x27;enclosure connected with Earn(a)&#x27;.

==Location and communications==
The nearest towns are Market Harborough about north and Kettering east via the A14 road which connects the town to the M1, M6 and M11 motorways.

Between 1859 and 1960 the village was served by Kelmarsh railway station about 1 mile south-west of the village and running trains between Northampton in the south and Market Harborough in the north.

==Administration==
The village has its own Parish Council.

==Notable buildings==
The Historic England website contains details of a total of eight listed buildings in the parish of Arthingworth, all of which are Grade II apart from St Andrew&#x27;s Church, which is Grade II*. They include:
*St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Braybrooke Road
*Arthingworth Lodge, Kelmarsh Road
*Arthingworth Manor. This was left as a shell in 1967 revealing walls probably from an older house. A stable block remains, now converted to a house but incorporating the Manor House staircase.
*Bosworth House
*Glebe House, Kelmarsh Road
*Hall Farmhouse, Oxendon Road

<text>Captain Edward Unwin, (20 April 1864 – 19 April 1950) was a Royal Navy officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Born in Fawley, Hampshire on 20 April 1864, Unwin joined the merchant navy at the age of 16 and spent 15 years serving on clippers with P&amp;O. He trained at and joined the Royal Navy on 16 October 1895 (part of the &quot;Hungry Hundred&quot;, merchant mariners recruited to the Navy to fill a shortage of junior officers) and served in the Benin Expedition and the Second Boer War. In November 1901 he was appointed to to serve in HMS &quot;Forth&quot;, but only five months later he was transferred in April 1902 to , serving in the South Pacific. He was lent to for service on that ship during the voyage to South Africa where the &quot;Monarch&quot; was stationed.

Unwin retired in 1909 with the rank of commander. He was recalled to the service on 29 July 1914, shortly before the outbreak of the First World War.

==First World War==
Initially Unwin served aboard on the staff of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe but in February 1915 he took command of the torpedo gunboat which had operated as a despatch vessel for the Commander in Chief, Mediterranean and was now a minesweeper.

In 1915, when planning began for the amphibious landing on the Gallipoli peninsula, Unwin proposed beaching the 4,000 ton collier SS &quot;River Clyde&quot; on the narrow beach beneath Sedd el Bahr at Cape Helles, known as V Beach, thereby allowing 2,000 troops to be landed together. At the age of 51, Unwin was promoted to acting Captain and given command of the &quot;River Clyde&quot; for the operation.

The &quot;River Clyde&quot; beached at 06:22 on 25 April 1915, and the plan called for a steam hopper to form a bridge from the ship to the shore. However, the Dardanelles current swept the hopper away so Unwin, accompanied by Able Seaman William Charles Williams, who had served under him on the &quot;Hussar&quot; and had been ordered to stay by his side, dived overboard and manhandled two lighters into position, lashing them together to form the bridge. All the while Unwin was under fire from the Turkish defenders. When Williams was mortally wounded, Unwin went to his aid and the lighter he was holding was swept away.

Unwin collapsed from cold and exhaustion, his place being taken by other men. After an hour of rest, he returned to the lighters until he was wounded and collapsed again. Once the attempts to land had ceased, Unwin went out a third time to attempt to recover wounded from the beach; according to one account he retrieved seven men. For his actions, he was awarded the Victoria Cross. The citation read:

In August, when a new landing was to be made by the British IX Corps at Suvla as part of the Battle of Sari Bair, Unwin was given command of the landing boats, known as &quot;Beetles&quot;. He was the first to report on the landing to the corps commander, Lieutenant General Sir Frederick Stopford, and advised against landing further troops inside Suvla Bay due to the darkness and reefs.

Unwin was back at Suvla as Naval Transport Officer for the evacuation in December – he was aboard the last boat to leave the beach. When a soldier fell overboard, Unwin dived in to rescue him. Observing this act, Lieutenant General Sir Julian Byng, the new IX Corps commander, remarked to Commodore Roger Keyes:

In 1916 Unwin took command of and in 1917 became Naval Transport Officer, Egypt. He later achieved the rank of commodore.

==Later life==

Between 1937-1939, Unwin was a member of the national council of The Link, a pro-Nazi organisation. Unwin played little active part in the affairs of The Link, and instead provided prestige to the group, which presented itself as an organisation that all patriotic British people should rally to. Unwin died on 19 April 1950 and is buried in Grayshott, Surrey. His Victoria Cross has been loaned by his family to the Imperial War Museum, London, where it is on display.

A memorial to Edward Unwin was unveiled in Hythe, Hampshire (close to his birthplace) on 11 May 2015 with details of the action in which he was awarded his VC.

<doc id="1191182" wikidata="Q522233" url="?curid=1191182" title="Emotion Engine">
<text>The Emotion Engine is a central processing unit developed and manufactured by Sony Computer Entertainment and Toshiba for use in the PlayStation 2 video game console. It was also used in early PlayStation 3 models sold in Japan and North America (Model Numbers CECHAxx &amp; CECHBxx) to provide PlayStation 2 game support. Mass production of the Emotion Engine began in 1999 and ended in late 2012 with the discontinuation of the PlayStation 2.

== Description ==
The Emotion Engine consists of eight separate &quot;units&quot;, each performing a specific task, integrated onto the same die. These units are: a CPU core, two Vector Processing Units (VPU), a 10-channel DMA unit, a memory controller, and an Image Processing Unit (IPU). There are three interfaces: an input output interface to the I/O processor, a graphics interface (GIF) to the graphics synthesizer, and a memory interface to the system memory.

The CPU core is tightly coupled to the first VPU, VPU0. Together, they are responsible for executing game code and high-level modeling computations. The second VPU, VPU1, is dedicated to geometry-transformations and lighting and operates independently, parallel to the CPU core, controlled by microcode. VPU0, when not utilized, can also be used for geometry-transformations. Display lists generated by CPU/VPU0 and VPU1 are sent to the GIF, which prioritizes them before dispatching them to the Graphics Synthesizer for rendering.

=== CPU core ===
The CPU core is a two-way superscalar in-order RISC processor. Based on the MIPS R5900, it implements the MIPS-III instruction set architecture (ISA) and much of MIPS-IV, in addition to a custom instruction set developed by Sony which operated on 128-bit wide groups of either 32-bit, 16-bit, or 8-bit integers in single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) fashion (e.g. four 32-bit integers could be added to four others using a single instruction). Instructions defined include: add, subtract, multiply, divide, min/max, shift, logical, leading-zero count, 128-bit load/store and 256-bit to 128-bit funnel shift in addition to some not described by Sony for competitive reasons. Contrary to some misconceptions, these SIMD capabilities did not amount to the processor being &quot;128-bit&quot;, as neither the memory addresses nor the integers themselves were 128-bit, only the shared SIMD/integer registers. For comparison, 128-bit wide registers and SIMD instructions had been present in the 32-bit x86 architecture since 1999, with the introduction of SSE. However the internal data paths were 128-bit wide, and its processors were capable of operating on 4x32bit quantities in parallel in single registers.

It has a 6-stage integer pipeline and a 15-stage floating-point (FP) pipeline. Its assortment of registers consists of 32 128-bit VLIW SIMD registers (naming/renaming), one 64-bit accumulator and two 64-bit general data registers, 8 16-bit fix function registers, 16 8-bit controller registers. The processor also has two 64-bit integer arithmetic logic units (ALUs), a 128-bit load–store unit (LSU), a Branch Execution Unit (BXU), and a 32-bit VU1 floating-point unit (FPU) coprocessor (which acted as a sync controller for the VPU0/VPU1) containing a MIPS base processor core with 32 64-bit FP registers and 15 32-bit integer registers. The ALUs are 64-bit, with a 32-bit FPU that isn&#x27;t IEEE 754 compliant. The custom instruction set 107 MMI (Multimedia Extensions) was implemented by grouping the two 64-bit integer ALUs. Both the integer and floating-point pipelines are six stages long.

To feed the execution units with instructions and data, there is a 16 KB two-way set associative instruction cache, an 8 KB two-way set associative non blocking data cache and a 16 KB scratchpad RAM. Both the instruction and data caches are virtually indexed and physically tagged while the scratchpad RAM exists in a separate memory space. A combined 48 double entry instruction and data translation lookaside buffer is provided for translating virtual addresses. Branch prediction is achieved by a 64-entry branch target address cache and a branch history table that is integrated into the instruction cache. The branch misprediction penalty is three cycles due to the short six stage pipeline.

=== Vector processing units ===
The majority of the Emotion Engine&#x27;s floating point performance is provided by two vector processing units (VPU), designated VPU0 and VPU1. These were essentially DSPs tailored for 3D math, and the forerunner to hardware vertex shader pipelines. Each VPU features 32 128-bit vector SIMD registers (holding 4D vector data), 16 16-bit fixed-point registers, four floating point multiply-accumulate (FMAC) units, a floating point divide (FDIV) unit and a local data memory. The data memory for VPU0 is 4 KB in size, while VPU1 features a 16 KB data memory.

To achieve high bandwidth, the VPU&#x27;s data memory is connected directly to the GIF, and both of the data memories can be read directly by the DMA unit. A single vector instruction consists of four 32-bit single-precision floating-point values which are distributed to the four single-precision (32-bit) FMAC units for processing. This scheme is similar to the SSEx extensions by Intel.

The FMAC units take four cycles to execute one instruction, but as the units have a six-stage pipeline, they have a throughput of one instruction per cycle. The FDIV unit has a nine-stage pipeline and can execute one instruction every seven cycles.

===Image Processing Unit (IPU)===

The IPU allowed MPEG-2 compressed image decoding, allowing playback of DVDs and game FMV. It also allowed vector quantization for 2D graphics data.

===DMA, DRAM and Memory Management Unit (MMU)===

The memory management unit, RDRAM controller and DMA controller handle memory access within the system.

=== Internal data bus ===
Communications between the MIPS core, the two VPUs, GIF, memory controller and other units is handled by a 128-bit wide internal data bus running at half the clock frequency of the Emotion Engine but, to offer greater bandwidth, there is also a 128-bit dedicated path between the CPU and VPU0 and a 128-bit dedicated path between VPU1 and GIF. At 150 MHz, the internal data bus provides a maximum theoretical bandwidth of 2.4 GB/s.

=== External interface ===
Communication between the Emotion Engine and RAM occurs through two channels of DRDRAM (Direct Rambus Dynamic Random Access Memory) and the memory controller, which interfaces to the internal data bus. Each channel is 16 bits wide and operates at 400 MHz DDR (Double Data Rate). Combined, the two channels of DRDRAM have a maximum theoretical bandwidth of 25.6 Gbit/s (3.2 GB/s), about 33% more bandwidth than the internal data bus. Because of this, the memory controller buffers data sent from the DRDRAM channels so the extra bandwidth can be utilised by the CPU.

The Emotion Engine interfaces directly to the Graphics Synthesizer via the GIF with a dedicated 64-bit, 150 MHz bus that has a maximum theoretical bandwidth of 1.2 GB/s.

To provide communications between the Emotion Engine and the Input Output Processor (IOP), the input output interface interfaces a 32-bit wide, 37.5 MHz input output bus with a maximum theoretical bandwidth of 150 MB/s to the internal data bus. The interface provides enough bandwidth for the PCMCIA extension connector which was used for the network adapter with built-in P-ATA interface for faster data access and online functionality. An advantage of the high bandwidth was that it could be easily used to introduce hardware extensions like the Network Adapter with built-in IDE HDD support or other extensions to extend functionality and product lifecycle which can be seen as a competitive advantage. In newer variants (like the slim edition), the interface would however, offer vastly more bandwidth than what is required by the PlayStation&#x27;s input output devices as the HDD support was removed and the PCMCIA connector design was abandoned in favor of a slimmer design.

== Fabrication ==
The Emotion Engine contained 13.5 million metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) transistors, on an integrated circuit (IC) die measuring 240 mm2. It was fabricated by Sony and Toshiba in a 0.25 μm (0.18 μm effective LG) complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) process with four levels of interconnect.

== Packaging ==
The Emotion Engine was packaged in a 540-contact plastic ball grid array (PBGA).

== Uses ==
The primary use of the Emotion Engine was to serve as the PlayStation 2&#x27;s CPU.

The first PlayStation 3 revisions produced also featured an Emotion Engine on the motherboard to achieve backwards compatibility with PlayStation 2 games. However, the second revisions of the PlayStation 3 lacked a physical Emotion Engine in order to lower costs, performing all of its functions using software emulation performed by the Cell Broadband Processor, coupled with a hardware Graphics Synthesizer still present to achieve PlayStation 2 backwards compatibility. In all subsequent revisions, the Graphics Synthesizer was removed; however, a PlayStation 2 software emulator is available in later system software revisions for use with Sony&#x27;s PS2 Classics titles available for purchase on the Sony Entertainment Network.

The Emotion Engine was also used in the PSX (digital video recorder) as well as the HDTV television models Sony WEGA HVX (Model Numbers KDE-xxxHVX/KDL-xxxHVX) and Sony BRAVIA KDL22PX300, all of which used PlayStation 2 hardware.

<text>Ashby St Ledgers is a village in the West Northamptonshire district of Northamptonshire, England. The post town is Rugby in Warwickshire. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 173. The Manor House is famous for being a location for the planning of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605. As of 2023, the property had been restored and could be rented for a fee.

==Location==
The nearest large towns are Rugby, north west, and Daventry, south. The A5 road, following the course of the Roman Watling Street, passes about a mile east. Rugby has the nearest railway station on the West Coast Main Line, with trains to London Euston and several other parts of the country. It is about north via the A5 to the M1 London to Yorkshire motorway junction 18 and about south to junction 16.

==History==
Ashby St Ledgers was first mentioned in the Domesday Book, which gave the place name as Ascebi (&quot;ash tree settlement&quot;). In Norman times, a church was erected on the site, dedicated to Saint Leodegarius, from whom the modern-day name is derived.

==Notable buildings==

===Manor House===
The manor was given as a gift to Hugh de Grandmesnil by William the Conqueror and passed to various other occupants until 1375, when it passed into the Catesby family and became their principal residence.

The manor was briefly confiscated after the attainder and execution of William Catesby, one of Richard III&#x27;s counsellors, after the defeat at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, but was later returned to his son, George. It passed down the male line to Robert Catesby&#x27;s father, Sir William Catesby, who managed to hold on to the property in spite of massive debts caused by recusancy fines and years of imprisonment for his brave adherence to the Roman Catholic faith.

The manor&#x27;s central location was convenient to the houses of the Catesbys&#x27; many friends and relations, which supposedly made Ashby St Ledgers a type of &#x27;Command Centre&#x27; during the planning of the Gunpowder Plot. In the room above the Gatehouse, with its privacy from the main house and clear view of the surrounding area, Robert Catesby, his servant Thomas Bates and the other conspirators are said to have planned a great deal of the Gunpowder Plot. Catesby was killed with some other plotters at Holbeche House, whereas his servant was executed in the following January.

Following Robert Catesby&#x27;s death in 1605, the manor was confiscated by the crown as the property of a traitor. However, Lady Anne Catesby had a life interest in a large portion of the property, given her by her husband at their marriage. This preserved a portion of the estate from alienation, and though an attempt was made in 1618 to reverse that, the settlement remained. In 1612, it was purchased by Bryan I&#x27;Anson (1560-1634), Sheriff of the City of London. He was the father of Sir Bryan I&#x27;Anson, 1st Bt., of Ashby St Ledgers; Gentleman of the Bedchamber to Charles I of England. In 1703, Esther I&#x27;Anson (Sir Bryan&#x27;s elder brother John&#x27;s great-granddaughter) sold the manor to Joseph Ashley, a London draper. When his great nephew, also called Joseph Ashley, died in 1798, the manor passed to his daughter, Mary, who was the wife of Sir Joseph Senhouse. Their daughter, Elizabeth, married Joseph Pocklington in 1835, and the manor remained in their family until 1903, when it was sold to Ivor Guest, 1st Viscount Wimborne, who had previously rented it for hunting.

Viscount Wimborne&#x27;s grandson and namesake, Ivor Guest, 3rd Viscount Wimborne, sold the estate in 1976. It passed through a series of owners, including the British Airways Pension Fund, who separated the manor house from the rest of the estate. In 1998 the 3rd Viscount&#x27;s son Ivor Guest, 4th Viscount Wimborne, bought the house, which had fallen into neglect, and restored it over two years. It was purchased by his cousin, Henry Guest, and his wife Nova.

The original medieval manor house was gradually replaced by later buildings, starting with a new range probably erected by the Catesbys in the early Tudor period. The I&#x27;Ansons created the main façade and an adjacent tower in the first half of the 17th century, together with another freestanding building across the court from the surviving medieval building. After being widowed in 1828, Mary Senhouse took up residence in the manor and expanded it in Jacobean revival style; a lifesize oil painting on the cellar door of a &quot;Herculean&quot; figure brandishing a club dates to this period and presumably alludes to the Guy Fawkes association of the house. The house was further expanded throughout the 19th century and then under the ownership of the Wimborns extensively remodelled by Edwin Lutyens, who worked on it for 40 years, the longest commission of his career, while also carrying out other commissions in the village. He created a new garden façade and a new range with its own tower, and behind the Jacobean façade, new Edwardian rooms with the floor lowered to give added height to the interiors. Rubble stone was used for the new building to blend with the original cut stone; some salvaged antique building elements were also used, including a complete medieval house from Ipswich that had been on exhibit in London in 1908. Lutyens&#x27; interiors were partially modified in the late 20th century, including demolition of the north wing, but the house was restored by the 4th Viscount Wimborne at the start of the 21st century.

The Baker family bought the Ashby St Ledgers estate from the British Airways Pension Fund in 1982. It includes an organic dairy farm, a country sports centre and Chapel Farm, which 150 years ago was the home of Thomas Arnold, the headmaster of Rugby School. The Bakers sold the estate to The Crown Estate in 2005. It will continue to be run as an agricultural business, but governed by its Rural Directorate.

===Other buildings===
The church is dedicated to Saint Leodegarius and has wall paintings showing the Passion of Christ &quot;&quot; 1500, with 18 scenes, and the flagellation of St Margaret, &quot;ca.&quot; 1325.

The village has a pub, the Olde Coach House Inn which closed in 2021.

Ashby Lodge, a house built by Londoner George Arnold in the early 1720s on the edge of the manor estate, was demolished in the 1920s.

<text>Image resolution is the level of detail of an image. The term applies to digital images, film images, and other types of images. &quot;Higher resolution&quot; means more image detail.
Image resolution can be measured in various ways. Resolution quantifies how close lines can be to each other and still be visibly &quot;resolved&quot;. Resolution units can be tied to physical sizes (e.g. lines per mm, lines per inch), to the overall size of a picture (lines per picture height, also known simply as lines, TV lines, or TVL), or to angular subtense. Instead of single lines, line pairs are often used, composed of a dark line and an adjacent light line; for example, a resolution of 10 lines per millimeter means 5 dark lines alternating with 5 light lines, or 5 line pairs per millimeter (5 LP/mm). Photographic lens are most often quoted in line pairs per millimeter.

==Types==

The resolution of digital cameras can be described in many different ways.

===Pixel count===
The term &quot;resolution&quot; is often considered equivalent to pixel count in digital imaging, though international standards in the digital camera field specify it should instead be called &quot;Number of Total Pixels&quot; in relation to image sensors, and as &quot;Number of Recorded Pixels&quot; for what is fully captured. Hence, CIPA DCG-001 calls for notation such as &quot;Number of Recorded Pixels 1000 × 1500&quot;. According to the same standards, the &quot;Number of Effective Pixels&quot; that an image sensor or digital camera has is the count of pixel sensors that contribute to the final image (including pixels not in said image but nevertheless support the image filtering process), as opposed to the number of &quot;total pixels&quot;, which includes unused or light-shielded pixels around the edges.

An image of N pixels height by M pixels wide can have any resolution less than N lines per picture height, or N TV lines. But when the pixel counts are referred to as &quot;resolution&quot;, the convention is to describe the &quot;pixel resolution&quot; with the set of two positive integer numbers, where the first number is the number of pixel columns (width) and the second is the number of pixel rows (height), for example as &quot;7680 × 6876&quot;. Another popular convention is to cite resolution as the total number of pixels in the image, typically given as number of megapixels, which can be calculated by multiplying pixel columns by pixel rows and dividing by one million. Other conventions include describing pixels per length unit or pixels per area unit, such as pixels per inch or per square inch. None of these &quot;pixel resolutions&quot; are true resolutions, but they are widely referred to as such; they serve as upper bounds on image resolution.

Below is an illustration of how the same image might appear at different pixel resolutions, if the pixels were poorly rendered as sharp squares (normally, a smooth image reconstruction from pixels would be preferred, but for illustration of pixels, the sharp squares make the point better).

An image that is 2048 pixels in width and 1536 pixels in height has a total of 2048×1536 = 3,145,728 pixels or 3.1 megapixels. One could refer to it as 2048 by 1536 or a 3.1-megapixel image. The image would be a very low quality image (72ppi) if printed at about 28.5 inches wide, but a very good quality (300ppi) image if printed at about 7 inches wide.

The number of photodiodes in a color digital camera image sensor is often a multiple of the number of pixels in the image it produces, because information from an array of color image sensors is used to reconstruct the color of a single pixel. The image has to be interpolated or demosaiced to produce all three colors for each output pixel.

===Spatial resolution===

The terms blurriness and sharpness are used for digital images but other descriptors are used to reference the hardware capturing and displaying the images.

Spatial resolution in radiology is the ability of the imaging modality to differentiate two objects. Low spatial resolution techniques will be unable to differentiate between two objects that are relatively close together.

The measure of how closely lines can be resolved in an image is called spatial resolution, and it depends on properties of the system creating the image, not just the pixel resolution in pixels per inch (ppi). For practical purposes the clarity of the image is decided by its spatial resolution, not the number of pixels in an image. In effect, spatial resolution is the number of &quot;independent&quot; pixel values per unit length.

The spatial resolution of consumer displays ranges from 50 to 800 pixel lines per inch. With scanners, optical resolution is sometimes used to distinguish spatial resolution from the number of pixels per inch.

In remote sensing, spatial resolution is typically limited by diffraction, as well as by aberrations, imperfect focus, and atmospheric distortion. The ground sample distance (GSD) of an image, the pixel spacing on the Earth&#x27;s surface, is typically considerably smaller than the resolvable spot size.

In astronomy, one often measures spatial resolution in data points per arcsecond subtended at the point of observation, because the physical distance between objects in the image depends on their distance away and this varies widely with the object of interest. On the other hand, in electron microscopy, line or fringe resolution is the minimum separation detectable between adjacent parallel lines (e.g. between planes of atoms), whereas point resolution is instead the minimum separation between adjacent points that can be both detected &quot;and interpreted&quot; e.g. as adjacent columns of atoms, for instance. The former often helps one detect periodicity in specimens, whereas the latter (although more difficult to achieve) is key to visualizing how individual atoms interact.

In Stereoscopic 3D images, spatial resolution could be defined as the spatial information recorded or captured by two viewpoints of a stereo camera (left and right camera).

===Spectral resolution===

Pixel encoding limits the information stored in a digital image, and the term color profile is used for digital images but other descriptors are used to reference the hardware capturing and displaying the images.

Spectral resolution is the ability to resolve spectral features and bands into their separate components. Color images distinguish light of different spectra. Multispectral images can resolve even finer differences of spectrum or wavelength by measuring and storing more than the traditional 3 of common RGB color images.

===Temporal resolution===

Temporal resolution (TR) is the precision of a measurement with respect to time.

Movie cameras and high-speed cameras can resolve events at different points in time. The time resolution used for movies is usually 24 to 48 frames per second (frames/s), whereas high-speed cameras may resolve 50 to 300 frames/s, or even more.

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle describes the fundamental limit on the maximum spatial resolution of information about a particle&#x27;s coordinates imposed by the measurement or existence of information regarding its momentum to any degree of precision.

This fundamental limitation can, in turn, be a factor in the maximum imaging resolution at subatomic scales, as can be encountered using scanning electron microscopes.

===Radiometric resolution===

Radiometric resolution determines how finely a system can represent or distinguish differences of intensity, and is usually expressed as a number of levels or a number of bits, for example 8 bits or 256 levels that is typical of computer image files. The higher the radiometric resolution, the better subtle differences of intensity or reflectivity can be represented, at least in theory. In practice, the effective radiometric resolution is typically limited by the noise level, rather than by the number of bits of representation.

==Resolution in various media==
This is a list of traditional, analogue horizontal resolutions for various media. The list only includes popular formats, not rare formats, and all values are approximate, because the actual quality can vary machine-to-machine or tape-to-tape. For ease-of-comparison, all values are for the NTSC system. (For PAL systems, replace 480 with 576.) Analog formats usually had less chroma resolution.

** IMAX, including IMAX HD and OMNIMAX: approximately 10,000×7,000 (7,000 lines) resolution. It is about 70 MP, which is currently highest-resolution single-sensor digital cinema camera (as of January 2012).
* Film
** 35 mm film is scanned for release on DVD at 1080 or 2000 lines as of 2005.
** The actual resolution of 35 mm original camera negatives is the subject of much debate. Measured resolutions of negative film have ranged from 25–200 LP/mm, which equates to a range of 325 lines for 2-perf, to (theoretically) over 2300 lines for 4-perf shot on T-Max 100. Kodak states that 35 mm film has the equivalent of 6K resolution horizontally according to a Senior Vice President of IMAX.

<text>Corporal James Upton VC (3 May 1888 − 10 August 1949) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was 27 years old, and a corporal in the 1st Battalion, The Sherwood Foresters (The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment), British Army during the First World War at the battle of Aubers Ridge when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 9 May 1915 at Rouges Bancs, France, Corporal Upton rescued the wounded while exposed to rifle and artillery fire, going close to the enemy&#x27;s parapet. One wounded man was killed by a shell while the corporal was carrying him. When not actually carrying the wounded, he was engaged in dressing and bandaging the serious cases in front of our parapet.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Sherwood Foresters Museum, The Castle, Nottingham, England.

<text>Badby is a village and a rural parish of about in West Northamptonshire, England.

==Location==
Badby is about 2 miles (3 km) south of Daventry, on the A361 Daventry to Banbury road, which still follows the route of the Lutterworth-Daventry-Banbury turnpike as approved in 1765. The parish is bisected west to east, at about above sea level, by the upper reaches of the River Nene. The village is mainly south of the river, where the land rises to Badby Down at .

==Demographics==
Its population has fluctuated between 450 and 625 from 1801 to 1971, with a low point of 410 in 1901, then to a high of 720 in 1991. It was 645 in 2001, 632 in 2011 and up to 701 in the 2021 census.

==Name==
The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;Badda&#x27;s fortification&#x27;. the second element was replaced with early Old Norse &#x27;by&#x27;, meaning &#x27;farm/settlement&#x27;.

Badby is spelt in various ways since Saxon times, through the Norman period, until printing stabilised it in the present form. Badby, Badbye, Baddebi, Baddeby, Badebi and Badeby are all found. Baddanbyrg or Baddan Byrig were used in the 944 AD charter, but these more likely refer specifically to Arbury Hill (see below).

==History==
There are several mediaeval charters referring to the area around Badby, but some are suspect. The land around Badby and Newnham changed hands frequently as the swirling forces of Mercia and the invading Danes ebbed and flowed across middle England.

Badby and Newnham manors were treated as one until the Knightleys sold Newnham manor to the Thorntons of Brockhall in 1634. The church benefice has always been Badby with Newnham (or Badby-cum-Newnham), Newnham being a chapel of the parent church at Badby in the initial times, but for a few years was recorded as the main church. The shared rector or vicar arrangement goes back 750 years.

===Saxon===
Charters record that the land was given by a Saxon sheriff (or shire reeve), Norman, to the Abbey of Croyland (or Crowland) around the year 726. To fund defence against the invading Danes around 871, Beorred seized it back and gave it to his army officers to secure their services.

In a charter dated 944, King Edmund I of England gave an estate comprising Dodford, Everdon and all of Badby with Newnham to Bishop Aelfric of Hereford. After Edmund&#x27;s murder in 946, the estate was returned in 948 to Croyland by his brother, King Edred (or Aedred, Ædred, Edric) on the advice of Turketul (or Turketulus), his chancellor. Abbot Godric II of Croyland, to buy protection against the threatening Danes, leased Badby in 1006 for 100 years to Norman (or Northman), son of Leofwine, Earl of Leicester (and Chester), a great military officer under King Edred.

The Danes attacked and prevailed in 1013 under their King Sweyn (or Sveyn), who died in 1014. He was eventually succeeded by his son Canute (or Cnut, Knud, Knut). In 1016 Norman was killed and in 1017 Edred was executed by King Canute. Canute thus acquired Badby and later transferred it to Norman&#x27;s brother, the Earl Leofric of Mercia, who had supported Canute and was married to the famous Godiva (or Godgifu). In turn, Earl Leofric gave the lordship of the manor of Badby and Newnham to the Benedictine Abbey of Evesham, for the remainder of the 100-year lease supposedly granted by Abbot Godric II of Croyland. This was ratified by King Canute in 1018. The Anglo-Saxons and the Danes began to settle together.

===Norman===
Then the Normans arrived. In their Domesday Book of 1086, Badby is listed under the lands owned by Croyland Abbey, ignoring the lease to Evesham. Around 1124, as the lease had ended, elderly Abbot Joffrid of Croyland set about resolving with Evesham the ownership of Badby. The fire that burned down Croyland Abbey in 1091 destroyed any deeds, if they existed. Abbot Reginald of Evesham convinced Joffrid that Croyland had no claim. The retention by Evesham was confirmed in 1246 in a charter by King Henry III and again in 1330 by King Edward III after a court hearing.

Evesham Abbey built a moated grange or farm headquarters 500 yards north-east of the church. The house was built by the notorious Abbot Roger Norreys in 1189. He was a well known womaniser who was exiled to the small and distant priory of Penwortham in 1213. In 1246 King Henry III granted free warren within Badby Wood and authorised the formation of a deer park for hunting and food. The enclosing embankments and ditches of the deer park still exist to the east of the village. Archeological excavations of the grange site in 1965-69 identified work from the 13th to 16th centuries. Three bakehouses were added in the 1350s; its hall and chapel were renovated in the 1380s. It continued in a variety of uses after the dissolution of the abbey during the Protestant Reformation. The grange finally tumbled down in 1722. Its remains lie hidden in a thicket at 52.227734, -1.177539 which unfortunately developed after the excavations ended.

In 1316, there was no Abbot in post, so King Edward II appointed Thomas de Evesham, one of his Chancery clerks, as rector of the benefice. The licence, which moved more control of, and finance from, Badby and Newnham to the Abbot of Evesham, was effected through Pope John XXII with Henry Berghersh, Bishop of Lincoln. It was in 1343 that the endowment for a vicar was laid down in a Lincoln diocesan document &quot;Ordinacio Vicarie in Ecclesia de Baddeby; 1343&quot;, and Reginald Musard became the first vicar.

===Ecclesiastical===
Since its foundation in 709, Evesham Abbey had successfully developed an independent existence. It could not avoid being dissolved in November 1539, during the Protestant Reformation and founding of the Church of England.

In the 9th century, the parish was in the Diocese of Dorchester (Oxon), a safer location adopted by an earlier Bishop of Leicester to avoid the invading Danes. The seat was moved to Lincoln in 1073 by Remigius. Lincoln Diocese was itself split on 4 September 1541 and Badby church, in Daventry deanery, came within the new but poorly endowed Diocese of Peterborough, in which it remains. It is now closer to six other cathedrals of the Church of England, which are, in order of distance: Coventry, Leicester, Oxford, Birmingham, Lichfield and Worcester.

===Later times===
King Henry VIII granted the manors of Badby and Newnham in 1542 to Sir Edmund Knightley and his wife Ursula and their heirs. The dower house in Fawsley Park, last inhabited in 1704, is now in ruins. It was built for Lady Ursula after Sir Edmund died. There was considerable unrest in the parish in the last 20 years of the 16th century, when Valentine Knightley attempted to transfer much area of arable to pasture and to restrict tenants’ rights to woodland. Several tenant families, despite being Puritans like Knightley, used aggressive action as well as national legal arbitration to protect their rights. The manor lands and courts were dissolved in the early 20th century.

In 1546 the rectorship and patronage of Badby and Newnham were passed to Christ Church, Oxford. It remained with Christ Church, Oxford, except for disruption by the Commonwealth, until 1919, when the Bishop of Peterborough became the patron.

===The Root(e) family===
The Root(e) family is listed as one of the early settlers in “A Genealogical Dictionary of the First Settlers of New England, before 1692”. We often receive enquiries, especially from America about the family.

There are no monuments, gravestones nor descendants of the family that we can identify in Badby village today. The 17th century parish records record births, baptisms, marriages and burials of a few members of the family. The records are now housed at the Northamptonshire Records Office.

Below are the results of research by former resident Cristine Orr. Thomas Roote married in Milton Malsor. This Thomas had a field and house in Badby in 1597, but gave it up in 1606. His son John was born in Milton Malsor probably in 1570. Badby registers show:
*27 July 1600 - John Roote married Ann Rushall at Badby. The Rushall name also appears as Russall and later as Russell in different entries
*21 December 1600 - Marie, daughter of John &amp; Ann Roote was baptized (Most records indicate her name was Mary, but the actual parish records are very illegible).
*18 October 1603 - Susanna, daughter of John &amp; Ann Roote was baptised
*16 January 1605 - Thomas, son of John &amp; Ann Roote was baptised. Thomas went to U.S.A. in 1637
*26 February 1608 - John, son of John &amp; Ann Roote. John also went to U.S.A. in 1637. 
*5 April 1609 - Thomas Roote was buried on 5 April 1609 in Badby.

NOTE: Arthur Louis Finnell, CGRS, of the National Huguenot Society states this about Thomas and Ann Routes (Roote)&#x27;s son: &quot;JOHN b. 1575; m 1600 Badby, England to Mary Russell. Listed in 1598 as an alien in London.&quot; To be a bonafide Huguenot, a person must have left France after 10 Dec 1520 and before 28 Nov 1787, suggesting Thomas Routtes was born in France, likely in 1555, and fled to Badby to escape Catholic persecution.

NOTE2: The above Huguenot origins are in question. It is now being considered that Thomas was a son of Lawrence Roote of Milton Malsor and evidence to this is currently being researched.

==Notable buildings==
===St Mary&#x27;s Church===
The church, dedicated to St Mary, was mostly built in the early 14th century with a very fine continuous clerestory added in the 15th century and the tower rebuilt in 1707–09. The building was restored in 1880-81 by Edmund Francis Law and is a Grade II* listed building. The parish is part of the united benefice of &quot;The Knightley Parishes&quot; of the Church of England.

Four of the chest tombs in the churchyard were separately listed as Grade II in 1987 (English Heritage ID 360661 and 360662).

===Badby House===

Badby House&gt; was built in 1826 by Charles William Watkins, whose arms are listed in Burke&#x27;s General Armory (1884) as: &quot;Azure, a fess vair between three leopard&#x27;s faces jessant-de-lys or&quot;. From 1964 Badby House had extensions carried out for use by passionist contemplative nuns, when it also became known as Our Lady of Passion Monastery. It was listed Grade II in January 1968, (English Heritage ID 360650). In 2009 the monastery additions were replaced with extensions suitable for its use as a care home, with comprehensive facilities dedicated to neurological illnesses and disorders. It now operates as Badby Park.

===Lantern House===
The Lantern House, an early 19th century building so named because of its octagonal tower shape, was completely restored and extended to provide modern living accommodation in 1981–82.

===Other houses===
There were 29 houses listed in 1987 under the Town and Country Planning Acts as having special architectural or historic importance. Many very valuable features in other buildings went unrecorded. The core of the village was designated a Conservation Area in 1993 by Daventry District Council.

One of the 17th century cottages in the village was the only thatched youth hostel in England and Wales. After being closed in 2005, it was modernised. Originally built in 1686 in the same year as Stuart Cottage on the opposite side of the green overlooking the church, it is now a single-family residence and thatched again in 2012. The adjacent former warden&#x27;s cottage was sold separately. Its old corrugated iron roof was replaced by thatch in 2009. A house in the conservation area, which had a deteriorating thatch covered with corrugated iron in the 1920-30s, was reclad with new corrugated iron sheeting in 2016, because the owners were not permitted to re-thatch using longer-lasting reed thatch instead of straw.

==Schools==
The first school in Badby was a charity school supported by the Knightleys of Fawsley and built in 1812 from a design by Wyatt in a Gothic and cruciform shape. Baker&#x27;s states that the school was erected by the Lady Mary Knightley, daughter of John Baines Esq. and niece of the Bishop of Worcester, who married Sir John Knightley in 1779.

The Lady Knightley, whose name the school bore, provided everything for the education of twelve poor girls. The six younger girls were boarded and had clothing provided, including boots, shawls and bonnets. They were known as Sir Charles&#x27; Girls and were taught chiefly domestic work by a person from the village; this included the spinning and weaving of sheets. The six older girls were taught in much the same way and were known as Lady Knightley Girls.

The older girls went to Fawsley each day to be taught by the housekeeper how to cook and clean, make beds, set tables, feed fowl, etc. They, too, were provided with all their clothes and at the age of twelve took a Labour Certificate examination. If they passed they could leave school, starting in situations with a good knowledge of household work. Otherwise, they stayed until they were fourteen. The school building was used in later years from 1870 as an infant school, supported by the Knightleys, until the County Council took over the education of the village children. It has now been listed as a building of historic interest.

The National School was started by Mrs Mary Green, second wife of the Rev. Thomas Green, who was vicar from 1816 to 1871. It was used by the older children and controlled by church managers for about sixty years. 

Initially, Mrs Green gathered a number of church-going girls in the vicarage on Sunday afternoons to learn poetry and hymns. She began to teach the girls to read and write and then decided to take a cottage for the purpose. The parish had formerly kept its own poor in a workhouse opposite the vicarage, but this building was later converted into three cottages to be disposed of by the vicar at his discretion; when one of these cottages became vacant the school for girls was started.

As soon as the next cottage became vacant it was taken for a school for boys and the poor were repaid for the loss of the cottages by so much coal each year. The third cottage was finally added to the school. When repairs were needed to bring the buildings up to acceptable standards; insufficient money could be found to do these; the school was therefore closed and the present school was built by the council, opened in January 1913 on the site already used by the school children for gardening lessons and duly celebrated its centenary in 2013.

The National School building was used for Sunday school and Mothers&#x27; Union meetings for several years. A harvest festival sale was also held there until 1965. The Sunday school then moved to the church and after about 1955 the Mothers&#x27; Union meetings were held in the Lady Mary School building which had become the village hall. In 1966 the National School building was finally declared unsafe and was pulled down; the site is now used for car parking.

For some years the county council had the meadow behind the Hollies earmarked for a school playing field. When the Hollies was sold in 1965 the council purchased the field and the playing area adjacent to the 1913 building was completed in 1967.

A highlight of the school year has for many years been the Rose Day event when the elected May King and May Queen are crowned at a ceremony incorporating maypole dances.

On 1 July 2014 the school officially converted to academy status. It became part of the Innovate Multi-Academy Trust together with Weedon Bec, Woodford Halse and Kilsby Schools.

==Morris dancing==
Up to about the mid-19th century, a number of villages in south Northamptonshire had Morris dance teams who performed each spring and early summer as part of their local customs. This ancient English tradition, considered to be very old even at the time of Elizabeth I, was common throughout the area of the Cotswolds and into Northamptonshire. The changes brought about by the enclosures, industrialisation and the railways all changed rural life dramatically. Many of the traditional Morris dance teams just stopped dancing, and their dances were forgotten and lost for ever.

Badby had a tradition of Morris dancing, and village men still danced till about the 1870s. They too broke up about then, some moving off to find work. Without new recruits, the dancing stopped. The dances of Badby might have been lost too, but about 1911 the folk song and dance collector Cecil Sharp visited the Daventry area with George Butterworth, the composer, who was a fellow collector and a dancer himself. They sought older villagers who could remember the Morris and the names of those men involved in it. The team costume was described as all white with pleated shirts with epaulettes and decorated with red, white and blue rosettes, two white silk scarves were worn crossed over shoulders to opposite waist side over the shirts. They wore bells on their legs and a &quot;scotch&quot; glengarry type of hat with ribbons at the back.

The dances are particularly energetic and flowing in style, with beautiful tunes. Most current Morris teams dance at least one Badby dance, usually &quot;Beauxs of London City&quot;. The local team Moulton Morris Men have revived the whole Badby dance tradition, as they specialise in Northamptonshire Morris dances. Badby is fortunate to have such a valuable history of local folklore and its own village folk music tunes.

==Rural bus challenge==
Bus services through the village had always been minimal and just met the demand to and from Daventry. The village is located in the unprofitable fringes between big bus company areas. United Counties Omnibus Company withdrew the remaining service in 1980 when Northamptonshire County Council withdrew financial support. After that, infrequent services were provided by K W Coaches Ltd of Daventry, a company registered on 16 December 1936 and its name was changed to Geoff Amos Coaches Ltd on 18 April 1983 upon a change of ownership and its base moved to Eydon. 
The Government&#x27;s Rural Bus Challenge led to the formation of the Great Central ConneXion quality bus partnership between Geoff Amos Coaches, Warwickshire, Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire County Councils. From 4 September 2000 the village was provided with a bus service better than ever experienced before when an hourly service began from Banbury via Byfield, Woodford Halse, back to Byfield, through Badby and Staverton to Daventry and thence through Braunston, HM Prison Onley and Dunchurch to Rugby railway station. The service was operated with a fleet of five new easy access yellow buses calling at a series of newly marked bus stops, many equipped with new bus shelters. Journeys to Rugby were given a service number GA01 and to Banbury GA02 (Buses in Dunchurch, Onley, Braunston and between Byfield and Woodford Halse used the same road in the same direction to both termini!). However, this distinction became blurred in later years.

The service continued until Friday 5 August 2011 when the company suddenly collapsed. Some journeys were covered that day by Stagecoach from Banbury and Rugby garages and the full timetable was operated soon afterwards. To make the service viable, Stagecoach rationalised the routes from 5 September 2011. Banbury to Daventry became service 200, operated from Banbury, omitting Staverton; and Daventry to Rugby reformed, with other subsidised journeys, into two services 10 and 12 operated from Rugby. In 2017 the services were linked so as to provide a service through Daventry between Northampton and Rugby via Kilsby and DIRFT, numbered D1 (via Barby) and D2 (via Braunston).

There are those who hope that the entrepreneurial spirit of the company will ensure viability of this service, started by the initiative of former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, while funding of bus services by national governments through local government seriously falters.

The coronavirus pandemic led to service 200 being reduced from hourly to 2 hourly from March 23, 2020 until June 29, 2020, and to similar halving of services D1, D2 and D3 from April 5, 2020.

==Badby Wood==

Badby Wood is owned by the Fawsley Estate. This estate belonged to the Knightley family from 1416 and passed through the female line to the Gage family of Firle, Sussex in 1938 when the male line died out. Most of the wood is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and the citation states:
Early 2007 saw the start of work undertaken by Fawsley Estate under a Forestry Commission Woodland Grant Scheme Agreement, running from 2006 to 2011. Natural England was involved and supports the works undertaken. A large number of sycamore and some larch were felled and removed to allow for native species, and the edges of the rides cleared in the first stage. In the second stage, more and larger larch were removed. A ring of horse chestnut trees, marking the start of the path to the stone arch into the cherry tree avenue, declined over ten years. The last ones fell over or were felled by the end of 2008. Fawsley Estate erected new gates and fencing here in 2009.

From autumn 2014, thinning operations took place in Badby Wood to improve the health and quality of the habitat in addition to producing timber and firewood as a sustainable carbon lean product. The work represented sustainable use of the growing natural resource and demonstrated best forestry practice in woodland SSSI management. This is part of a carefully designed programme fully consulted with the Forestry Commission and Natural England and now approved within a long term Woodland Management Plan.

The thinning process removed predominantly sweet chestnut, sycamore, European larch and Scots pine and opened back around the mature oak. In areas worked no more than 20-25% of standing volume was removed. This opened areas of the canopy as appropriate to allow light penetration and thus encourage natural regeneration of tree seedlings and ground flora. Through encouraging structural diversity, a wider variety of wildlife is supported, and areas of non-SSSI woodland with high biodiversity potential improved, to fulfil this potential in the long-term.
The work was specified and contracted by a Chartered Forester and was fully managed and supervised throughout. It was carried out by competent and insured forestry contractors who were aware of the ecological importance of the woodland and have good experience of working on sensitive sites. The proceeds of timber sales was invested into the long-term management of the valued woodland resource to ensure its sustainable upkeep for future generations.

==Footpaths==
There are several off-road rights of way within the village and to nearby villages.

Knightley Way was the first of the longer off-road footpaths designated as a County Path in Northamptonshire. It was created through 12 miles of attractive countryside formerly owned by the Knightley family of Fawsley Hall. It initially joined the two Youth Hostels that existed at Badby and Greens Norton. It is the only right of way through Badby Woods and passes through Fawsley, Preston Capes, Farthingstone and Grimscote.

Nene Way is a more modern County Path extending 110 miles from Badby through Northamptonshire, Cambridgeshire and ending at Sutton Bridge in Lincolnshire. Its route is well marked.

==Arbury Hill and earthworks==
Arbury Hill at is the highest point in Northamptonshire and due west of the church tower. There is a single-rampart Iron Age square-shaped Hill Fort with sides about long. The hill has a motocross track and is used about four times a year by local clubs.

A tumulus about north along the Daventry road is much spread by ploughing and is all that remains of a group which lay north of the village. .

<text>Barby is a village and civil parish about north of Daventry in Northamptonshire, England. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 2,336. Barby is located right off the M45 motorway a short spur from the M1 motorway to the A45 Trunk Road.

To the northwest and southwest the parish boundary forms part of the county boundary with Warwickshire, and the village is only about southeast of Rugby. Rains Brook, a tributary of the River Leam, forms the parish and county boundary northwest of the village.

The village is near the top of a hill that rises to above sea level south of the village. Barby&#x27;s toponym comes from the Old Norse &quot;Bergbýr&quot;, meaning &quot;hill dwelling&quot;.

==Archaeology==
North of the village is a Norman motte and earthworks but no bailey. It is called Barby Castle but is really the site of an early fortified manor house. The abandoned village of Onley is in the north-west of the parish.

==Parish church==
The oldest part of the Church of England parish church of St Mary is a Saxon window west of the south doorway. The windows in the north wall of the chancel were inserted about 1300, which is when the west tower was built. The church is a Grade II* listed building.

The tower has a ring of five bells. The third bell was cast at Leicester in about 1599. Hugh II Watts, who had foundries at Leicester and Bedford, cast the second bell in 1622. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the treble bell in about 1871. John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough cast the fourth and tenor bells in 1922. At the same time Taylor&#x27;s also cast the sanctus bell.

Barby Rectory was built in 1869. St Mary&#x27;s is part of a single benefice with St Faith&#x27;s, Kilsby.

==Economic and social history==

The Oxford Canal was dug through the parish in the early 1770s, passing about west of the village. In 1774 it opened from Bedworth in Warwickshire as far south as Napton-on-the-Hill. The nearest wharf was outside Willoughby, about southwest of Barby. The canal reached Oxford at the end of 1789.

South of Barby village is an early 19th-century former tower mill, which has been converted into a private home.

The Great Central Main Line from to London Marylebone was built through the west of the parish in the 1890s and opened in 1899. Its nearest railway station was at Willoughby Wharf. The railway station was renamed twice, the second time in 1938 when the London and North Eastern Railway renamed it .

British Railways closed Braunston and Willoughby railway station in 1957. The M45 motorway was built through the parish in the late 1950s and opened in 1959, passing about north of the village. In 1963 &quot;The Reshaping of British Railways&quot; report recommended that British Railways close the railway, which it did in 1966.

==Amenities==

The village has a Church of England primary school. There are a general shop and post office, a garden centre, a village hall and a children&#x27;s play area.

Barby Cricket Ground is in Longdown Lane opposite the windmill. The club plays in the Warwickshire League and has men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and junior sides.

Stagecoach in Warwickshire bus route 10 runs hourly between Rugby and Daventry via Barby. It also has a pub, the Arnold Arms.

==Twin village==
Since 1995, the village has been twinned with Vulaines-sur-Seine in France.

<doc id="1191197" wikidata="Q2388605" url="?curid=1191197" title="Boughton, Northamptonshire">
<text>Boughton is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire, England. It is situated approximately from Northampton town centre along the A508 road between Northampton and Market Harborough.

The parish area straddles both sides of the road, but the main part of the village is to the east. Boughton is on the northern fringe of the Northampton urban area and, together with the neighbouring village of Moulton, is an area for the expansion of the town.

== History ==
=== Etymology ===

Boughton has been recorded under various names, including &quot;Buchenho&quot;, &quot;Buchetone&quot;, &quot;Buchedone&quot; and &quot;Bochetone&quot; during the 11th century. This evolved into &quot;Boketon&quot;, &quot;Buketone&quot; and &quot;Buckton&quot; between the 12th and 15th centuries.

The name is reportedly derived from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Bucca&quot; meaning &#x27;he-goat&#x27; farm, presumably referencing farming practices that once existed in the village. However, there is also evidence of Prehistoric and Roman settlements close to the modern centre of the village and in the surrounding area.

=== Historical ===
A Bronze Age bowl barrow was found to the west of the A508 and the site is a Scheduled Monument. Archaeological finds in the south of the adjacent field have yielded both pottery and worked flints of Bronze Age type. An unscheduled barrow exists at Bunkers Hill to the north east of the village, within Boughton parish.

In the Domesday Book of 1086, Boughton was described as a village comprising 39 households in the hundred of Spelhoe; the landlord of the estate following the Norman Conquest was Countess Judith of Lens, niece of William the Conqueror. While there has been little physical evidence, the Northamptonshire Historic Environment Record documents the presence of a possible Norman Motte-and-bailey castle within the current Pocket Park, although it is unlikely to have been maintained long after the 11th century.

===Medieval===

During the medieval period, an early settlement existed around the now deserted Boughton Green to the east of the parish. A concentration of Neolithic arrowheads and Iron Age pottery has also been found around Boughton Green. The surviving fragments of St John&#x27;s Church are to the north of the Green. The church has been in ruins since at least 1757, and was significantly damaged further in 1784 when the spire collapsed.

Boughton Green was also once the site of a substantial three-day annual fair dating from at least 1353 when, to this end, Sir Henry Greene was granted a royal charter by Edward III. The fair was popular into the 19th century. It was also the site of the last robbery attempted by the infamous highwayman George Catherall (or ‘Captain Slash’) who was caught, tried and hanged in Northampton in 1826.

In the centre of Boughton stands the chapel of St John the Baptist which now serves as the parish church. The tower, dating from the 15th century, is the oldest surviving structural element of the chapel and the village core. The church was extended and restored during the 19th century. The church has a monument to Mary Tillemont (d.1706).

The oldest surviving non-ecclesiastical buildings in Boughton date from the 17th century. These properties are grouped around Butchers Lane and Church Street; The Old Bakehouse and Obelisk Farm are described in their listing descriptions as early-17th century whilst Merewater, formerly the Lion Pub, has a date-stone giving the year 1634. There are three other examples of 17th century buildings on Church Street: the Old Griffin (numbers 3 and 4), Griffin Cottage and Number 15 were all built in the mid- to late 17th century.

===Boughton Hall, park and follies===
A manor has been recorded in Boughton since at least the Norman period. The de Boughton family held the manor under Edward I, which passed through to Sir John Briscoe and Lord Ashburnham in the late 17th century. References to the latter manor stipulate that it was situated near the current Boughton Hall.

In the 1720s, the Hall was described as &#x27;pleasantly situated upon rising ground which commands a very extensive prospect&#x27;. However, by 1808, the Hall lay deserted and ruined. In 1844, it was demolished and rebuilt by Gen. R. W. H. Howard-Vyse to the west of the old site in a Victorian style. Recently, the Hall was subdivided into two units and the associated stables and coach houses act as private dwellings.

The gardens to the south west of the Hall are surrounded by a large stone retaining wall that dates from the early 18th century. These formal gardens are presumed to have been laid out in their current form by Sir John Briscoe in the 1690s and form the oldest surviving element of the Hall and Park.

The parkland, which lies mainly to the north of the village, but previously stretched eastwards also, was largely redesigned in the 18th century by William Wentworth, 2nd Earl of Strafford (1722–1791), a friend of Horace Walpole.

Wentworth also installed a collection of follies which still stand, including The Spectacles (twin towers with a Gothic arch), Bunkers Hill Farm (1776), New Park Barn (1770) which resembles a fortified castle (now called Fox Covert Hall and converted into a house) and the castellated Hawking Tower (1756 or earlier), the main gate lodge on east side of the A508 main road. There is also a grotto north of the house and an obelisk to the south (1764) near Obelisk Rise, a large 1960s housing estate in Kingsthorpe.

Boughton Park contains Northamptonshire&#x27;s largest collection of 18th century follies and other landscape structures. However, the Park&#x27;s history was never properly documented until the publication of &quot;The Follies of Boughton Park&quot; by Simon Scott in 1995. A new edition, titled &quot;The Follies of Boughton Park Revisited&quot; was published in 2011, much expanded from the original. In 2022 a limited edition reprint of the 2011 book was published to mark the 300th anniversary of the birth of William Wentworth, Earl Strafford – the person responsible for the landscape and almost all the associated follies.

===Modern===

During the 18th century, the village grew alongside the Hall. Surviving 18th century developments include the Rectory, Honeysuckle Cottage and Numbers 12, 13 and 14 Church Street.

In the 19th century, the Methodist Chapel on Moulton Lane was established as well as The Whyte Melville public house, which is named after the poet of the same name who once lived in the building. Two terraced rows of cottages were also erected on Moulton Lane and on Humfrey Lane. The earliest example is a surveyor&#x27;s map of Northamptonshire in 1813, where Boughton&#x27;s historic layout is clearly visible. Boughton Primary School opened in 1841.

During the 20th century, more residential development took place. Most of these buildings are found on Butchers Lane; Spring Close, Moulton Lane, the southern side of Humfrey Lane, a 1960s housing estate along Howard Lane and a row of detached housing leading out of the village on Vyse Road.

The 13th Lord of Boughton is Bernardo Espinosa de los Monteros. 

==Demographics==
The 2011 census indicated a population of 1,112, an increase from 951 in 2001. Historic figures: population in 1801 was 344; in 1831, 360; in 1841, 389; in 1851, 369; in 1861, 372 ; in 1871, 339.

==Governance==
Boughton Parish Council has 11 members elected every 4 years. The local authority is West Northamptonshire Council, but prior to local government reform, was Daventry District Council and Northamptonshire County Council.

==Buckton Fields==
In 2007, proposals were submitted to build a large housing development on Buckton Fields, land which sits within the Boughton parish to the south west of the village. An archaeological survey of the land in 2013 identified features associated with post-medieval agriculture, an early World War II searchlight battery and a mid 20th century rubbish pit.

After some revisions and public consultations to the original proposals, the planning application was approved by Daventry District Council in 2013 and work commenced on Phase 1 (&quot;Buckton Fields East&quot;) in 2015 in a joint venture between Martin Grant Homes and Bloor Homes. By 2020, Phase 1 was mostly built out and occupied, closely followed by the start of Phase 2 (&quot;Buckton Fields West&quot;) which was still in development as of 2024. Plans for Phase 3 were submitted by Taylor Wimpey in 2021 and work commenced in 2022.

Buckton Fields Primary School opened in September 2021. Like two other schools built from prefabricated modules by Caledonian Modular (Sir Frederick Gibberd College in Harlow and Haygrove School in Bridgwater), it was forced to close in August 2023 amid fears that the building might collapse in extreme weather. Education minister Nick Gibb said Department for Education (DfE) inspectors had &quot;identified issues that related to the structural integrity of the buildings, weakening its ability for example to withstand extreme events such as high winds or a big snowfall or indeed a collision from a vehicle.&quot; The school had been designed by architects Stride Treglown but the DfE blamed poor workmanship, saying the school had not been built in accordance with the design. In December 2023, the DfE confirmed that the school would be demolished and rebuilt.

<text>John David Crow Sr. (July 8, 1935 – June 17, 2015) was an American football player, coach, and college athletics administrator. He won the Heisman Trophy in 1957 as a halfback playing for the Texas A&amp;M Aggies. After college, he played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Chicago / St. Louis Cardinals and the San Francisco 49ers from 1958 to 1968.

After his playing career, Crow became an assistant football coach for the Alabama Crimson Tide football team of the University of Alabama, serving under coach Bear Bryant from 1969 to 1971 He moved to the NFL as an assistant with the Cleveland Browns in 1972, and then the San Diego Chargers in 1974. In December 1975, Crow was hired as head football coach and athletic director at Northeast Louisiana University—now the University of Louisiana at Monroe. He coached the football team for five seasons, from 1976 to 1980, compiling a record of 20–34–1. He remained as athletic director until 1981. Crow returned to his alma mater, Texas A&amp;M, in 1983 as an assistant athletic director. He was promoted to athletic director in 1988 and served in that capacity until 1993.

Crow was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1976. A street on the campus of Texas A&amp;M University adjacent to Kyle Field is named after him.

In 2009 Erle and Alice Nye commissioned a twice life size bronze statue of Crow, and donated the $250,000 monument to Texas A&amp;M University, sculpted by Steven Whyte.

==Early life==
A native of Marion in Union Parish in North Louisiana, Crow was reared to the west in Springhill in northern Webster Parish near the Arkansas state line. He graduated in 1954 from Springhill High School.

==College career==
Under coach Bear Bryant at Texas A&amp;M, Crow was not one of the &quot;Junction Boys,&quot; since he was a freshman in 1954, Bryant&#x27;s first season, and was thus ineligible to play on the varsity under NCAA rules at the time. In 1956, Crow was part of the first Aggie football team to beat the University of Texas at Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium.

In Crow&#x27;s senior season in 1957, the Aggies opened with eight wins and were ranked first in the AP poll. The Aggies lost their last three games after uncertainty over whether head coach Bear Bryant would be leaving. Although injured early in the season, Crow was able to play in seven games in his senior season. He rushed for 562 yards on 129 carries, with six touchdowns. Crow also caught two passes and passed for five touchdowns. While playing on defense, he intercepted the ball five times. During the 1957 season, Bryant famously quipped, &quot;If John David Crow doesn&#x27;t win the Heisman Trophy, they ought to stop giving it.&quot;

Crow was named am All-American, and won the Heisman Trophy on December 3 over runner-up Iowa tackle Alex Karras, followed by Michigan State halfback Walt Kowalczyk. Crow claims not to have understood the importance of the award until sponsors flew his family and him to New York City for the presentation. He was the first Aggie to win the Heisman, and he was the only one of Bryant&#x27;s players to win. Bryant then left for Alabama shortly after Crow received the Heisman.

==Professional career==
In the 1958 NFL draft, Crow was the second overall pick, selected by the Chicago Cardinals. He played eleven seasons in the NFL and appeared in four Pro Bowls. 

In his first season, he played in seven games and rushed 52 times for 221 yards while catching twenty passes for 362 yards; he scored five total touchdowns. He also returned six kicks for 145 yards. Crow&#x27;s first touchdown occurred in his first game on September 28 when he recovered a fumble in the end zone. The following year, he would improve by playing in twelve games while recording a total of 994 scrimmage yards (666 rushing, 328 receiving) with seven total touchdowns and a Pro Bowl selection. 

Crow followed the team to St. Louis in 1960. That year, he had his first and only 1,000 yard rushing season with 1,071 yards on 183 carries; he led the league in yards per carry (5.9), yards from scrimmage (1,533), and fumbles (eleven). On December 18, 1960, he rushed for his only 200-yard game when he ran for 203 yards on 24 carries in a 38–7 victory over Pittsburgh. He was named to the Pro Bowl again while also receiving votes for MVP within UPI. However, he could not maintain his highs in 1961. He played in eight games and rushed for just 192 yards with 306 receiving yards that year. 

The next year, Crow saw action in 14 games and rushed for 751 yards on 192 carries while catching 23 passes for 246 yards; he scored a career high seventeen touchdowns while dubiously leading the league in fumbles (fourteen). Crow&#x27;s best game came on December 12, 1962, when he recorded 21 carries for 95 yards with three touchdowns before adding another on his lone reception from sixteen yards out as the Cardinals won 45–35 over the Philadelphia Eagles. It was the only time he had four touchdowns in a game and the only time he rushed for three touchdowns. Crow would be hindered by injuries in 1963, playing just three games (week 5–7), although he did record one touchdown on a ten-yard pass that helped in a 24–23 victory over Pittsburgh. 

He played in thirteen games the following year, rushing for 554 yards on 163 carries while catching 23 passes for 257 yards. It would be his final season with the Cardinals.

Crow was traded to the San Francisco 49ers ahead of the 1965 season for veteran defensive back Abe Woodson, he played fourteen games and rushed for 514 yards with 132 carries while catching 28 passes for 493 yards; he made his fourth and final Pro Bowl while receiving votes for Comeback Player of the Year. He rushed for over 475 yards with receiving yards of over 300 in each of the next two seasons while playing in all fourteen games. Crow finished his career with the San Francisco 49ers. Crow received the annual Len Eshmont Award twice, in 1966 and 1967, voted by the players and given to the 49er who best exemplifies the &quot;inspirational and courageous play&quot; of Len Eshmont. In his final season in 1968, he primarily played tight end, and he caught 31 passes for 531 yards with five touchdowns.

In total, Crow scored 74 touchdowns over his career (38 rushing, 35 receiving, one fumble recovery) while also throwing five touchdown passes. His 74 touchdowns were 13th best all-time in football history upon his retirement. In 125 games, he rushed for 4,963 yards on 1,157 carries while catching 258 passes for 3,699 yards.

==NFL career statistics==


==Coaching career==
When his playing career ended, Crow became a coach. In 1969, he was named the offensive backfield coach under Bryant at Alabama, a position he retained until 1971. He was personally close to Bryant, under whom Crow&#x27;s son, John David &quot;Johnny&quot; Crow Jr., played at Alabama.

He later worked as an assistant coach with the Cleveland Browns and the San Diego Chargers.

===Northeast Louisiana===
Crow was the sixth head football coach for Northeast Louisiana University—now the University of Louisiana at Monroe—and he held that position for five seasons, from 1976 until 1980, with a record of .

==Athletic director==
Crow became the athletic director and head football coach at Northeast Louisiana University in 1975. He remained there until 1981, when he left to pursue private business opportunities.

In 1983, he became assistant athletic director at Texas A&amp;M under Jackie Sherrill, who served as both athletic director and head coach of the football team. Crow handled most duties for all sports except football, which Sherrill oversaw. He was promoted to athletic director at the end of the 1988 football season when Sherrill resigned in the midst of a scandal. Texas A&amp;M President William Mobley hired R. C. Slocum, Sherrill&#x27;s defensive coordinator, as the new head football coach. In a press conference the day after his appointment, Crow announced, &quot;I want to reaffirm my commitment to full compliance with the NCAA, Southwest Conference, and Texas A&amp;M University regulations in our athletic department.&quot;

After a public row in January 1990, Crow fired long-time Aggies basketball coach Shelby Metcalf, who had coached at Texas A&amp;M for 32 years, with five Southwest Conference championships. The relationship between the men had often been described as bitter, and Crow cited &quot;uncalled-for criticism&quot; in his firing of Metcalf, who was not given the opportunity to say goodbye to his players. When asked by the media what happened between the two, Metcalf remarked, &quot;I made a comment that I didn&#x27;t think John David was all that bright. And I thought I was being generous.&quot; Crow appointed Kermit Davis to replace Metcalf.

Later that year, after Arkansas left the Southwest Conference, Crow and DeLoss Dodds, the athletic director at the University of Texas, met with officials from the Pac-10 Conference about aligning with that conference. The two later cancelled a similar meeting with officials from the Southeastern Conference.

Crow resigned from his position as athletic director in April 1993 to invest as a limited partner in a greyhound racetrack. At the time of his resignation, the Texas A&amp;M football program was embroiled in a scandal over students accepting money from boosters for jobs they had not performed. He was succeeded as athletic director by Wally Groff. As a result of the scandal, the Texas A&amp;M football program was placed on five years probation and was banned from television or postseason appearances for one year.
He then took a job as the fundraiser for the university until 2001, when he retired.

==Awards and later life==
Crow was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1976. In 2004, Crow was awarded the PriceWaterhouseCoopers Doak Walker Legends Award, presented annually by the SMU Athletic Forum. The award is given to former college football running backs who had excellent college careers and later became leaders in their community. In 1976, he was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in Natchitoches.

Crow retired in College Station, Texas. In an interview with the &quot;Bryan-College Station Eagle&quot;, Crow said, &quot;I tell everybody that A&amp;M is my true love and that I want us to win everything that we do, but Alabama is a close second because of the ties I had with Coach Bryant, and with my son playing over there.

He died at a hospice in Bryan, Texas, on June 17, 2015; he was 79 years old, three weeks shy of his 80th birthday. In addition to their son, Crow and his high school sweetheart and wife of more than 60 years, the former Carolyn Gilliam, have two surviving daughters, Annalisa Stenklyft and husband, Jay, and Jeannie Pietrowiak and husband, Ken; daughter-in-law, Janice Crow, and seven grandchildren. He was cremated. A public reception was held in his memory on June 23 at Reed Arena in College Station.

<doc id="1191199" wikidata="Q2240700" url="?curid=1191199" title="Woodford Halse">
<text>Woodford Halse is a village about south of Daventry in Northamptonshire. It is in the civil parish of Woodford cum Membris, which includes also village of Hinton and hamlet of West Farndon. Hinton and Woodford Halse are separated by the infant River Cherwell and the former course of the Great Central Main Line railway. The village was formerly served by the Great Central Railway, which provided significant local employment, including Woodford Halse railway station which opened in 1899 and closed in 1966.

==Churches==
The earliest parts of the Church of England parish church of Saint Mary the Virgin include the chancel, west tower and south doorway, which date from about 1300. The arcade of the south aisle is 14th or 15th century.

St Mary&#x27;s has a ring of six bells plus a sanctus bell. One of the Watts family of bell-founders, who had foundries in Bedford and Leicester, cast four of the bells including the tenor in 1613. John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough cast a fifth in 1909 and the present treble in 1976.

St. Mary&#x27;s parish is a member of the Benefice of Woodford Halse with Eydon, Byfield, Northamptonshire, Aston Le Walls and Boddington, Northamptonshire.

Woodford Halse has also a Moravian Church.

==Economic history==

A flight of four lynchets survive south of the village: a rare survival in Northamptonshire. In 1758 the open field system of farming around Woodford Halse was ended by enclosure. The ridge and furrow pattern of the common fields is visible in parts of the parish, and especially just south of the village. Allotments northeast of the village are laid out along the ridges and furrows, and follow their uneven widths and reverse S-curve.

In 1848 Woodford Halse&#x27;s principal landowners included Sir Henry E.L. Dryden, 7th Baronet and Sir Charles Knightley, 2nd Baronet.

===Railway===

In July 1873 the East and West Junction Railway (later part of the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway) was opened through the parish. The line passed just over south of the village but the nearest station on the line was at almost away.

On 15 March 1899 the Great Central Railway (GCR) opened its main line from to London Marylebone through the parish, using the valley of the River Cherwell to pass between Woodford Halse and Hinton. The GCR established a new station called Woodford &amp; Hinton, a four-way railway junction, a major locomotive depot and extensive marshalling yards. A plan to build carriage sheds here was not implemented, but between the old village and the new railway several rows of terraced houses for railway workers were built, together with a street of shops.

The Railway Hotel was built in 1900. By 1973 it had become Woodford Halse Social Club.

The parish&#x27;s population eventually peaked at just under 2,000, at which time the village had its own cinema. The GCR main line was at times a busy route and the depot and yards at Woodford Halse were very active.

British Railways renamed the station Woodford Halse on 1 November 1948. Following the 1963 &quot;The Reshaping of British Railways&quot; report, BR closed the station, the main line and the Banbury branch of the former GCR on 5 September 1966. All tracks and most railway buildings were dismantled. The population fell sharply as former railway workers left the parish, but new developments in later decades have since increased it. Where the GCR&#x27;s line, depot and yards were sited is now a tree plantation which was acquired by the Parish Council in 2016 as a public amenity space and a small modern industrial estate, but evidence of the railway is still visible.

Currently, public transport serving Woodford Halse consists of an hourly bus between Banbury and Daventry, operated by Stagecoach Oxfordshire.

==Amenities==

Woodford Halse Church of England Primary School serves the parish. The school has one of the largest playing fields of any Northamptonshire school and holds an annual cross-country race, attracting over 700 competitors from more than thirty schools. The village has several shops and businesses. Northamptonshire Fire and Rescue Service has a fire station at Woodford Halse, staffed by retained firefighters. The village&#x27;s regular social events include the Annual Christmas Street Fair and Summer Boat Races.

==Media==
Television signals in the village are received from the local relay transmitter which is transmitted via the Sutton Coldfield transmitter. However, signals can also be received from the Sandy Heath and Oxford transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Northampton, Heart East, Inspiration FM and Connect Radio.

The local weekly newspaper serving the village is the &quot;Daventry Express&quot;.

==Sport and leisure==
Woodford Halse has a non-League football club, Woodford United F.C., which plays at Byfield Road.

<text>Thomas Hamilton (11 January 1784 – 24 February 1858) was a Scottish architect, based in Edinburgh where he designed many of that city&#x27;s prominent buildings. Born in Glasgow, his works include: the Burns Monument in Alloway; the Royal High School on the south side of Calton Hill (long considered as a possible home for the Scottish Parliament); the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh; the George IV Bridge, which spans the Cowgate; the Dean Orphan Hospital, now the Dean Gallery; the New North Road Free Church, now the Bedlam Theatre; Cumstoun, a private house in Dumfries and Galloway; and the Scottish Political Martyrs&#x27; Monument in Old Calton Cemetery, Edinburgh.

He was one of the leading Greek Revivalists in Scotland, &quot;more imaginative than his peers and more refined in his detailing&quot;. He was a favourite of the church for his Gothic designs, being commissioned to design many Free Churches after the Disruption of 1843. He also designed shops and banks, many of which survive.

Hamilton was born on 11 January 1784 in Glasgow to Jean Stevenson and Thomas Hamilton (1754–1824), a carpenter (wright) and cabinet-maker who also worked as an architect, His mother and father were married at the Canongate Church in 1783. His father returned to Edinburgh after his birth and was most notable for remodelling the north-west corner of St Giles&#x27; Cathedral in 1796. He was presumably watched by Hamilton who was then 12 years old.

In 1791 his father, working from premises on Brodies Close, substantially altered a building at the head of Old Assembly Close on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh to make it their family home (now known as 166 High Street). It is notable for its arched windows on the first floor, all visible from the street and unlike the other rectangular windows in the block. The Hamiltons occupied all three upper floors, the ground floor being occupied by William Vair, a stocking maker.

Hamilton&#x27;s father received many City commissions between 1796 and 1803 allowing Hamilton to attend the old High School in High School Yards from 1800 to 1801. The rector at the time was Alexander Adam.

In 1803 the family moved to a newly built house of 47 Princes Street in Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town. His father (listed as a &quot;wright&quot;) still retained a workshop at Allan&#x27;s Close on the Royal Mile in the Old Town. Hamilton was by then apprenticed to his father. His mother Jean died approximately at the time of this move or shortly before.

In 1804 his father remarried: to Margaret McAra. By this time young Thomas seems largely to have been working under the wing of his uncle. John Hamilton (d.1812), a builder living and operating from 4 Dundas Street in the New Town, helping with building projects such as Heriot Row. During this time he acquired considerable knowledge of stone masonry.

In 1812 his uncle John died and left the bulk of his estate to Hamilton who was 28 years old. This included several houses on Heriot Row and Dundas Street, built by them both. 

Since the move to Princes Street, however, his father&#x27;s affairs had been in disarray, with Hamilton possibly supporting him to some degree. In 1813 his uncle James Hamilton of Springhill agreed to pay £40 towards his father&#x27;s debts to fend off creditors, but this was never paid. His father was then pursued through the courts from 1818-1822, resulting in the poinding of his goods. His father removed to Currie where he died in June 1824.

Hamilton&#x27;s earliest known architectural drawing, dated 1813, is a plan requested by the Dean of Guild for a scheme by Robert Burn (architect) (1752–1815) to remodel a house on St Andrew Street.

Hamilton was a founding member of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1826.

In the 1830s he is listed as living at 57 York Place, on the eastern edge of the Edinburgh New Town.

He trained John Henderson in the 1820s. The architect John Starforth trained under Hamilton in the 1830s.

In 1852, he submitted a design for improving the Bank of Scotland&#x27;s Head Office, which was unpopular and described as a &quot;prominent deformity&quot; by Lord Cockburn in 1849. The design was of Greek neo-classical style, and he received 200 guineas (£12000 in today&#x27;s terms).

In his final years he was living at 41 York Place. Interestingly, in deference to his father, he is still referred to as &quot;Thomas Hamilton Junior, architect&quot;.

He died at 9 Howe Street (an office) on 24 February 1858. He is buried in John Hamilton&#x27;s vault in Old Calton Cemetery, a few yards south of the Martyrs Monument. Originally unmarked, the pupils of the Royal High School placed a commemorative wall plaque inside the vault in 1929 (to mark the school&#x27;s centenary).

==The Martyrs&#x27; Monument==

The Scottish Political Martyrs&#x27; Monument is a tall obelisk which is a prominent feature on the Edinburgh sky-line. It was funded by public subscription raised by the radical MP Joseph Hume. The monument bears the following inscription:

To The Memory Of Thomas Muir, Thomas Fyshe Palmer, William Skirving, Maurice Margarot and Joseph Gerrald. Erected by the Friends of Parliamentary Reform in England and Scotland, 1844.

It includes the following quotation:

&quot;I have devoted myself to the cause of The People. It is a good cause - it shall ultimately prevail - it shall finally triumph.&quot; (Speech of Thomas Muir in the Court of Judiciary on 30 August 1793.)

Hamilton also designed the Doric column for the statue of John Knox (1825) in the Glasgow Necropolis (see Glasgow&#x27;s public statues).

==Burns Monuments (Edinburgh and Alloway)==

The building of a mausoleum on the grave of Robert Burns in Dumfries in 1815 was followed by a general move to erect memorials and statues of the bard in other Scottish towns and cities. In October 1817 a competition was announced in Ayrshire seeking designs for a monument at Burns&#x27; birthplace at Alloway. Hamilton had been working on just such a project. His design is based on the Monument to Lysicrates in Athens, Greece, a form often associated with poets and poetry. Hamilton won the competition and the foundation stone was laid in 1820, but the project was shelved and debated for years. It was resumed in 1825 and completed in 1828. A bust of Burns by Patrick Park was added in the memorial in 1854. This was replaced in 1884 by a bust donated by the prominent Scots sculptor Sir John Steell.

Following a large subscription in 1817 from Scottish expatriates in India a monument in Edinburgh was funded and after a debate lasting over a decade Thomas Hamilton won this commission in 1831. While largely repeating the design of the Alloway monument, he designed the Edinburgh monument to contain a full sized statue of Burns by John Flaxman. The statue was later removed to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery where it remains on display.

Whilst the Alloway monument is accessible all the year round, the Edinburgh monument is accessible only on special occasions such as Doors Open Day (usually one weekend in late October in Edinburgh). As part of the Edinburgh Art Festival it was opened daily between 28 July 2016 and 28 August 2016.

<doc id="1191210" wikidata="Q2973551" url="?curid=1191210" title="Division of Dickson">
<text>The Division of Dickson is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. The incumbent MP is Peter Dutton, who has been leader of the Liberal Party and leader of the opposition since 2022.

Dickson includes the suburbs of Kurwongbah, Petrie, Strathpine, Albany Creek, Ferny Hills, Everton Hills, Murrumba Downs and parts of Kallangur. The electorate also includes Lake Samsonvale and Lake Kurwongbah and covers 724 square kilometres.

==History== 

The division was formed in 1992 and is named after Sir James Dickson, a leading advocate in Australian Federation, Premier of Queensland and Minister for Defence in the first Australian ministry. 

===1993 election===
There was an unusual circumstance at the 1993 election. The seat had been carved out of most of the Brisbane portion of the Sunshine Coast-based seat of Fisher, making it a natural choice for that seat&#x27;s Labor MP, Michael Lavarch, to transfer ahead of the 1993 election.

However, one of the candidates, an independent, died very shortly before the election, making it necessary to hold a standalone supplementary election on 17 April (the rest of the country had already voted on 13 March). Following Labor&#x27;s reelection, the Prime Minister Paul Keating announced the makeup of the Second Keating ministry to be sworn in on 24 March, but kept the portfolio of Attorney-General open for Lavarch subject to him winning Dickson on 17 April. He won the seat, and was appointed to the ministry on 27 April.

==Boundaries==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

The division is located in the outer north-western suburbs of Brisbane, including Albany Creek, Kallangur and Strathpine. The 2006 redistribution added the Shire of Esk to and removed part of Kallangur from the seat. It has historically been a marginal seat, changing hands between the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party.

<text>James Edward Tait (27 May 1888 – 11 August 1918), was a Scottish/Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background==
Tait was born on 27 May 1888 in Maxwelltown (Dumfries), Scotland to James Bryden Tait and Mary Johnstone. He married Jessie Spiers Aitken from California. He joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force in February 1916.

==World War I==
Tait was 30 years old, and a lieutenant in the 78th (Winnipeg Grenadiers) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force, during the First World War.

He died in action on 11 August 1918 in Amiens, France. He was awarded the VC for his actions that day.

===VC citation===
Lieutenant James Edward Tait was also awarded the Military Cross at the Battle of Vimy Ridge. The citation for this award is as follows:
&quot;For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. Early in an assault he was wounded, and all the other officers killed or wounded, but he led his company with great fearlessness and determination through intense fire to the objective, and, although unable to walk, supervised its consolidation, finally crawling back alone, to leave for others the four bearers.&quot;

Due to his previous work with the Hudson Bay Railway survey, a siding south of Lynn Lake, Manitoba was named Jetait in his honour. Lieutenant Tait also has an island named after him in the Winnipeg River, Manitoba between the Pinawa Marina and the Pinawa Sailing Club.

Tait is buried at Fouquescourt British Cemetery which is located 16 miles south of Albert, France (special memorial, grave 8). His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Glenbow Museum in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

<text>The Colwich rail crash occurred on the evening of Friday 19 September 1986 at Colwich Junction, Staffordshire, England. It was significant in that it was a high-speed collision between two packed express trains. One driver was killed, but no passengers died because of the great strength of the rolling stock involved, which included Mk1, Mk2 and Mk3 coaches.

== Background ==

Colwich Junction lies between Rugeley and Stafford and is where the four-track West Coast Main Line from London splits into two routes. Approaching from the south, two tracks go to Manchester via Stoke-on-Trent and two tracks go to Stafford and Crewe. In the middle of the layout, two of the lines cross each other at a diamond crossing.

In August 1986, the signalling was altered so that drivers of northbound trains taking the Stoke line would see flashing yellow signals on approach. The rulebook meaning of this was:

&quot;A flashing yellow aspect means facing points at a junction ahead are set for a diverging route and the speed of the train must be reduced&quot;.

This sequence of signalling was designed for use at higher-speed turnouts as a replacement for &quot;approach release&quot;, where the junction signal is held at red until the train is near to it.

Over the next few years, flashing yellows were also installed at locations where trains cross over between different tracks travelling in the same direction, e.g. from a &quot;fast&quot; line to a &quot;slow&quot; line. While not &quot;junctions&quot; in the traditional sense, the signalling sequence was identical to that given at a &quot;diverging&quot; route.

== The accident ==
On 19 September 1986, the signalman at Colwich saw that the 17:00 express train from London Euston to Manchester Piccadilly was approaching the junction at roughly the same time as the 17:20 express from Liverpool to Euston. He decided to give precedence to the latter and so the Manchester train might need to wait its turn over the junction.

The Manchester train needed to cross from the Down Fast to the Down Slow line before turning off towards Stoke. The signals presented to its driver were as follows:

After passing over the crossover he saw that CH23 was still red. Having interpreted the flashing yellows to mean that the route was set all the way over the junction to Stoke, he was expecting this signal to clear as he approached it (as under the approach release system). But as he got nearer he realised it had not.

The driver made an emergency brake application but the train did not stop before reaching the diamond crossing. At that moment he saw the Liverpool train approaching at high speed and shouted a warning to a trainee driver who was also in the cab. They both jumped from the locomotive almost immediately before the Liverpool train collided with it.

The locomotive of the Liverpool train was 86211 &quot;City of Milton Keynes&quot;. It hit the other locomotive 86429 &quot;The Times&quot; side-on, which finished up in the wreckage with its body twisted and split open. The passenger coaches were scattered in all directions and some had their ends badly damaged. Eric Goode, the driver of no. 86211, was killed. It was also reported that Nicaragua&#x27;s ambassador to Britain, Francisco d&#x27;Escoto, was one of the injured passengers.

== Investigation ==

After the accident, the driver went to the signal box and told the signalman &quot;You had double flashing yellows and the route was set for Stoke&quot;. With &quot;traditional&quot; junction layouts in mind, flashing yellows would have meant that the route was set for him right through the junction, with at worst, the red signal on the far side. It was not; at Colwich the signalling system was designed for the &#x27;diverging route&#x27; to be only the crossover from the Down Fast to the Down Slow, and the driver was not expecting to see a red signal before taking the Stoke line. In this respect railway nomenclature had unwittingly set a trap; he had after all seen a &#x27;Junction Indicator&#x27; illuminated and thus assumed that his train had been routed across the junction.

The public inquiry centred on whether the driver had had adequate training on the recently introduced flashing yellow signals and the implications at multiple junctions. The driver admitting to signing for, but not actually reading, the Notice that referred to the installation of flashing yellows at Colwich the previous month.

A contributory factor was the lack of &quot;flank protection&quot; given the layout at Colwich Junction. The accident would not have happened if the points had been set to route the train away from the diamond crossing, rather than head-on into the Liverpool train&#x27;s path, as would have been normal practice in an older manual installation. This feature was not included in the junction design because it would have prevented a parallel movement from being signalled on the down fast line, even though in this particular case the train had approached on the down fast line anyway.

This lesson was not learnt; lack of flank protection would again prove a significant factor in a head-on collision, at the Ladbroke Grove rail crash in 1999. 

== Recommendations ==

The Inspector&#x27;s report recommended changing the signalling system so that a flashing yellow sequence could only occur when the route was set across the &quot;whole&quot; junction, as the driver was expecting. A second recommendation was to inhibit wheel slide protection (WSP) during an emergency brake application – practical tests suggested the train could then have stopped before fouling the junction. The latter recommendation was not implemented.

== Memorial ==

Local resident Alf Taylor created a memorial to Eric Goode at the site of the accident, which he looked after until his death in 1997. On 17 September 2006, the Sunday before the 20th anniversary of the accident, the garden was re-dedicated.

In 2010 a new road in Crewe, where Eric Goode was based was named after him. The road is on the site of the railway bingo club he frequented.

<doc id="1191222" wikidata="Q2460531" url="?curid=1191222" title="Laura Palmer">
<text>Laura Palmer is a fictional character in the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; franchise and the primary focus of the series. She is portrayed by Sheryl Lee and was created by the series creators David Lynch and Mark Frost. She first appears in the ABC original series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. A high school student whose death is the catalyst for the events of the series, Palmer is the protagonist in Lynch&#x27;s prequel film &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; (1992), which depicts the final week of her life leading up to her murder. Laura also appears in the novels, &quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot; (2017), and a variety of merchandise based on the series.

==Appearances==
===In television===

==== 1990–1991 original series ====
Laura (played by Sheryl Lee, who also played her cousin Maddy Ferguson) was well known and loved in Twin Peaks; she volunteered at Meals on Wheels, was her school&#x27;s Homecoming Queen, and was (apparently) the darling of her parents, Sarah (Grace Zabriskie) and Leland (Ray Wise). However, the series gradually revealed that Laura led a double life: she was a cocaine addict, a victim of child sexual abuse, a fetish model and, briefly, a sex worker at One Eyed Jacks, a casino/brothel just north of the Canada–US border. Officially involved with Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook), the high school football team captain, she was also engaged in a secret relationship with James Hurley (James Marshall). She also had sexual encounters with other Twin Peaks citizens, such as businessman Ben Horne (Richard Beymer) and trucker/drug dealer Leo Johnson (Eric Da Re).

The discovery of Laura&#x27;s body in the pilot episode of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; brings Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) to investigate her death. Her murder and its effect on those around her propel the first season and the first eight episodes of the second season. Laura remains a prominent character afterward, as her death exposes many secrets related to her, and also, in some cases, unrelated, such as the Packard mill conspiracy. Laura also appears in Cooper&#x27;s dreams, offering cryptic clues as to the identity of her killer.

Laura&#x27;s first diary is uncovered in the first episode, but her 2nd secret diary is not recovered until later. The secret diary contains passages suggesting that she had been sexually abused by a malevolent entity named Bob (Frank Silva) since she was a child. In her diary she referred to Bob as a friend of her father&#x27;s.

In the prequel/sequel &quot;Fire Walk with Me&quot;, Laura&#x27;s spirit makes the transition to the afterlife when an angel appears to her, showing that her nightmare is finally over.

During the second season, the identity of her murderer was revealed: her father, Leland, who had sexually abused her for years while being possessed by Bob. Before his death in police custody, Leland tells Cooper and the others that he had not been aware of his own actions during the times Bob possessed him. As Leland dies, Laura appears before him in a vision, and it is implied that she forgives him and welcomes him to the afterlife.

Laura appears inside the Black Lodge during the series finale, as both herself and an evil doppelgänger version.

====2017 revival series====

Sheryl Lee reprised her role as Laura in the 2017 revival. In &quot;Part 2&quot;, Laura Palmer removes her face to reveal a mysterious white light emanating from within her body. She is shortly whisked away by an unseen force. In &quot;Part 8&quot;, a glowing orb containing Laura&#x27;s portrait is sent to Earth in 1945 by Senorita Dido, shortly after the creation of Bob during the testing of the first nuclear bomb.

In Part 17, Agent Cooper is sent back in time by Special Agent Phillip Jeffries and saves Laura on the night of her murder; the opening scenes of the first season are revisited thereafter, but Laura&#x27;s iconic plastic-wrapped body is nowhere to be found. Laura herself disappears soon after, vanishing from Cooper&#x27;s grasp as they stroll through the woods of Twin Peaks.

In the series finale, Cooper discovers that Carrie Page, a middle-aged woman who looks just like Laura Palmer, is living in an alternative reality in Odessa, Texas. Though skeptical of Cooper&#x27;s claims of her past life as Laura, Carrie is eager to flee town, as there is a dead man in her living room with a bullet hole in his head. She accompanies Cooper to Washington state. Once they arrive at the Palmer residence, Carrie does not seem to recognize her supposed former home, and Cooper is shocked to find the &quot;Tremond&quot; family living there, having purchased the home from the previous owners, the Chalfonts. As Cooper begins to question the current year, Sarah Palmer&#x27;s voice calls out &quot;Laura&quot; from the Palmer residence, and Carrie screams in horror.

===In film===
Laura is the protagonist of the prequel film &quot;Fire Walk With Me&quot;. The film depicts the last week of her life and the events leading up to her murder.

Laura is the high school homecoming queen and is best friends with Donna Hayward (Moira Kelly). Laura is addicted to cocaine and is cheating on her boyfriend, Bobby Briggs, with the biker James Hurley. After Laura realizes pages are missing from her secret diary, she gives the rest of the diary to Harold Smith (Lenny Von Dohlen), her agoraphobic friend.

She has a dream about entering the Black Lodge. Cooper and the Man from Another Place (Michael J. Anderson) appear in her dream. The Man from Another Place tells Cooper that he is &quot;the arm&quot; and offers Teresa&#x27;s ring to Laura, but Cooper tells her not to take it. Laura finds Annie Blackburn (Heather Graham) next to her in bed, covered in blood. Annie tells Laura to write in her diary that &quot;the good Dale&quot; is trapped in the Lodge and cannot leave. When she wakes up, Laura sees the ring in her hand.

The next evening, Laura goes to the Bang Bang Bar to meet her drug connections and have sex with strangers. Unexpectedly, the normally chaste Donna shows up. They all go to the Pink Room. When she sees a topless Donna making out with a stranger, a distraught Laura takes her home and begs her friend to not become like her. The next morning, Leland drives Laura home. On the way home, Philip Gerard/Mike (Al Strobel), a one-armed man who is also possessed by a demon, pulls up alongside Leland&#x27;s car and shouts at Leland that &quot;the thread will be torn&quot;. He shows Teresa&#x27;s ring to Laura, but she and Leland become frightened and drive away.

The next night, Bob comes through Laura&#x27;s window and begins raping her, only to transform into Leland. The next morning she warns Leland to stay away from her. Upset, Laura uses more cocaine and has trouble concentrating at school. When Bobby realizes Laura was only using him to score cocaine, he breaks off their relationship. Subsequently, Laura breaks up with James, then goes to a cabin in the woods to have an orgy with Leo, One-Eyed Jack&#x27;s poker dealer Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz), and prostitute Ronette Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine). Leland has followed her there; he attacks Jacques, leaving him incapacitated. Leo finds Jacques and promptly leaves. Both girls, having been tied up during their trysts with Jacques and Leo, are taken from the cabin by Leland to an abandoned train car. Laura asks Leland if he is going to kill her, but Bob appears and tells Laura he intends to possess her. Mike has tracked Leland/Bob to the train, but when Ronette tries to let him in, Leland beats her unconscious. Mike manages to throw in Teresa&#x27;s ring. Laura puts it on, which prevents Bob from possessing her. Enraged, Leland/Bob stabs Laura to death. Leland/Bob places Laura&#x27;s body in the lake. As her corpse drifts away, Leland/Bob enters the Red Room, where he encounters Mike and the Man from Another Place, who announce they want their share of &quot;garmonbozia&quot;, a supernatural substance generated by pain and fear.

As Laura&#x27;s body is found by the Sheriff&#x27;s department, Cooper comforts her spirit in the Black Lodge.

Laura is the protagonist of the 2014 film, &quot;Twin Peaks: The Missing Pieces&quot;, which features deleted scenes from &quot;Fire Walk With Me&quot;, pieced together to make a feature-length film.

===In literature===
====&quot;The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer&quot;====

==Development==

===Conception===
Laura&#x27;s murder was possibly inspired by the unsolved death of Hazel Irene Drew, who was found dead in Teal&#x27;s Pond in Sand Lake, New York and the story of which Mark Frost was told by his grandmother Betty Calhoun. This story is told in David Bushman and Mark T. Givens&#x27; &quot;Murder at Teal&#x27;s Pond: Hazel Drew and the Mystery That Inspired Twin Peaks&quot; (2022) which includes an introduction by Frost explaining the connection.

===Casting===
Due to budget constraints, Lynch intended to cast a local girl from Seattle, reportedly &quot;just to play a dead girl&quot;. The local girl ended up being Sheryl Lee. Lynch stated &quot;But no one—not Mark, me, anyone—had any idea that she could act, or that she was going to be so powerful just being dead.&quot; And then, while Lynch shot the home movie that James takes of Donna and Laura, he realized that Lee had something special. &quot;She did do another scene—the video with Donna on the picnic—and it was that scene that did it.&quot; As a result, Sheryl Lee became a semi-regular addition to the cast, appearing in flashbacks as Laura, as well as Laura&#x27;s cousin, Maddy Ferguson.

<text>John Philips (30 December 1676 – 15 February 1709) was an 18th-century English poet.

== Early life and education ==
Philips was born at Bampton, Oxfordshire, the son of Rev. Stephen Philips, later archdeacon of Salop, and his wife Mary Wood. He was at first taught by his father and then went to Winchester College. He suffered from delicate health but became a proficient classical scholar. He was treated with special indulgence because of his personal popularity and delicate health. He had long hair, and when others were at play, he liked to stay in his room reading Milton while someone combed his locks. He was then at Christ Church, Oxford under Dean Aldred, where Edmund Smith was his greatest friend. He intended to become a physician, but devoted himself to literature instead.

== Poetical works ==
Philips was loath to publish his verse but his &quot;Splendid Shilling&quot; was included, without his consent, in a &quot;Collection of Poems&quot; published by David Brown and Benjamin Tooke in 1701. When another false copy appeared early in 1705, he printed a correct folio edition in February of that year. The &quot;Splendid Shilling&quot;, a burlesque in Miltonic blank verse, was described by Joseph Addison as &quot;the finest burlesque poem in the English language&quot;. It depicted the miseries of a debtor without a shilling in his purse with which to buy tobacco, wine, food and clothes. As a result of this work Philips was introduced to Robert Harley and employed to write &quot;Blenheim&quot; (1705) as a counterblast to Addison&#x27;s celebration of the Battle of Blenheim in &quot;The Campaign&quot;. The piece imitates Milton&#x27;s verse, and the warfare is similar to that of the Iliad or Aeniad. In 1706 &quot;Cerealia; an imitation of Milton&quot; was published by Thomas Bennet, the bookseller who issued &quot;Blenheim&quot;. This has been believed to be by Philips, but it was not included in the early editions of his works, and his authorship has been questioned. In January 1707-8 Fenton published in his &quot;Oxford and Cambridge Miscellany Poems&quot;, a short &quot;Bacchanalian Song&quot; by Philips.

In 1708 Philips issued &quot;Cyder&quot;, his chief work, which is an imitation of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot;. Tonson agreed to pay Philips forty guineas for it in two books, with ten guineas for a second edition. Philips also received one hundred large-paper copies, and two dedication copies bound in goatskin. He signed a receipt for the forty guineas and the books on 24 January 1707-8 and the poem was published on the 29th (Daily Courant). It has some fine descriptive passages with an exact account of the culture of the apple tree and the manufacture of cider. It has many local allusions to Herefordshire, the County of his ancestors. Philip Miller the botanist told Johnson that &quot;there were many books written on the same subject in prose which do not contain so much truth as that poem&quot;. Samuel Johnson objected that the blank verse of Milton, which Philips imitated, &quot;could not `be sustained by images which at most can rise only to elegance&quot;. Pope said that Philips succeeded extremely well in his imitation of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, but was quite wrong in endeavouring to imitate it on such a subject.

Philip&#x27;s minor productions include a clever Latin &quot;Ode ad Henricum S John&quot; written in acknowledgement of a present of wine and tobacco, which was translated by Thomas Newcomb. Philips also contemplated a poem on the &quot;Last Day&quot;, but his health grew worse. After a visit to Bath, Somerset he died aged 33 of tuberculosis at his mother&#x27;s house in Hereford.

== Memorials and testimonials ==
Thomas Tickell in his &quot;Oxford&quot; (1707) had compared Philips with Milton, saying he &quot;equals the poet, and excels the man&quot;. After the poet&#x27;s death, a monument in his memory was erected in 1710 by Simon Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt in Westminster Abbey, between the monuments to Chaucer and Drayton, with the motto &quot;Honos erit huic quoque pomo&quot; from the title page of &quot;Cyder&quot;.

In February 1710 Edmund Smith printed a &quot;Poem to the Memory of Mr John Philips&quot; which was later described by Samuel Johnson as &quot;a poem, which justice must place among the best elegies which our language can shew&quot;. In the same year Leonard Welsted published &quot;A Poem to the Memory of the Incomparable Mr Philips&quot; with a dedication to St John. In 1713, William Diaper paid his tribute by including the episode of Pomona mourning Thyrsis near the beginning of his &quot;Dryades; or, the Nymphs Prophecy&quot; (1713).

<text>John Pierpont (April 6, 1785 – August 27, 1866) was an American poet, who was also successively a teacher, lawyer, merchant, and Unitarian minister. His poem &quot;The Airs of Palestine&quot; made him one of the best-known poets in the U.S. in his day. He was the grandfather of J. P. Morgan.

==Early life==
Born in 1785 in the South Farms section of Litchfield, Connecticut later incorporated as the town of Morris. He was the son of Elizabeth ( Collins) Pierpont and James Pierpont (1761–1840).

He graduated in 1804 from Yale College, and later from Litchfield Law School.

==Career==

In 1814 he started a dry goods business with his brother in-law, Joseph Lord, and lifelong friend, John Neal. After a stint in debtor&#x27;s prison as a result of the failure of the &quot;Pierpont, Lord, and Neal&quot; dry goods store chain in 1815, Pierpont sent his wife and children to live with her family in Connecticut, pawned the family silver, and isolated himself in Baltimore until he had produced &quot;The Airs of Palestine&quot;. This poem made him one of America&#x27;s best-known poets in 1816, the same year he cofounded a literary society called the Delphian Club. Selling the poem&#x27;s copyright paid for his move to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Neal gave the poem a poor review in his 1824–25 critical work &quot;American Writers&quot; and the two men stopped corresponding for a year afterward.

Pierpont began his religious work as a theology student in 1816, first in Baltimore and then at Harvard, afterwards accepting an appointment as pastor at the Hollis Street Church in Boston (1819-1845). During his tenure, Pierpont was instrumental in establishing Boston&#x27;s English Classical School in 1821 and gained national recognition as an educator. He published two of the better-known early school readers in the United States, &quot;The American First Class Book&quot; (1823) and &quot;The National Reader&quot; (1827). However, Pierpont&#x27;s latter years at the Hollis Street Church were characterized by controversy. His social activism for temperance and abolition angered some parishioners, and after a long public battle, he resigned in 1845.

After his resignation, Pierpont served as pastor of a Unitarian church in Troy, New York from 1845 to 1849, and then led the First Parish Church (Unitarian), Medford, Massachusetts from 1849 to 1856. He ran for Massachusetts governor during the 1840s as a Liberty Party candidate, and in 1850 as a Free Soil Party candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives.
On September 12, 1861, during the Civil War, 76-year-old Pierpont enlisted as the Chaplain of the 22nd Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry at Camp Schouler. He was commissioned on the staff of the regiment on October 8, and they moved by train to Washington. Pierpont and the 22nd Massachusetts served on duty at Hall&#x27;s Hill, Virginia, as part of the Defenses of Washington. He resigned his commission on November 5, 1861 due to poor health, and was given an appointment in the Treasury Department in Washington, which he held from the end of 1861 until his death.

===Literary works===

Pierpont gained a literary reputation with his book &quot;Airs of Palestine: A Poem&quot; (1816), re-published in an anthology by the same name in 1840. He also published moral literature, such as &quot;Cold Water Melodies&quot; and &quot;Washingtonian Songster&quot; (comp. 1842). In addition, he is probably the anonymous &quot;gentleman&quot; who co-authored &quot;The Drunkard; or, The Fallen Saved&quot; (1844), attributed to W. H. Smith, an actor and stage manager at Moses Kimball&#x27;s Boston Museum (theatre). &quot;The Drunkard&quot; quickly became one of the most popular temperance plays in America.

Pierpont&#x27;s many published sermons include, among others, &quot;The Burning of the Ephesian Letters&quot; (1833), &quot;Jesus Christ Not a Literal Sacrifice&quot; (1834), &quot;New Heavens and a New Earth&quot; (1837), &quot;Moral Rule of Political Action&quot; (1839), &quot;National Humiliation&quot; (1840), and &quot;A Discourse on the Covenant with Judas&quot; (1842). With publication of &quot;Phrenology and the Scriptures&quot; (1850), Pierpont became known not only as a reform lecturer, but also as an expert on phrenology and spiritualism.

Pierpont was an important influence on reform-minded antebellum poets. Along with John Greenleaf Whittier’s verse, Pierpont’s poems were frequently recited at public antislavery meetings. Oliver Johnson, a leading antislavery publisher and Garrison associate, published Pierpont’s &quot;Anti-Slavery Poems&quot; in 1843. The collection contains poems that had appeared mostly in the poetry columns of &quot;The Liberator&quot; and &quot;The National Anti-Slavery Standard&quot;. Pierpont’s writings were also anthologized widely in antislavery poetry collections, such as William Allen’s &quot;Autographs of Freedom&quot; (1853).

John Pierpont did not write the song &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; as erroneously claimed by Robert Fulghum in his collection of essays It Was on Fire When I Lay Down on It (1989). &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; was composed by his son James Lord Pierpont, who lived in Savannah, Georgia, and who was a Confederate soldier during the Civil War, composing songs for the Confederate States of America, including &quot;Our Battle Flag&quot;, &quot;Strike for the South&quot;, and &quot;We Conquer or Die.&quot; He did, however, compose a hymn for the 250th anniversary of the incorporation of the town of Dedham, Massachusetts.

===Activism===
Pierpont may be called &quot;the poet of the abolition movement&quot;. His poem &quot;The Tocsin&quot;, written just after the destruction of Pennsylvania Hall (Philadelphia), was published in &quot;The Liberator&quot;, the country&#x27;s leading anti-slavery paper.

Pierpont was also involved in women&#x27;s rights issues and spoke about women&#x27;s suffrage.

==Personal life==
In 1810, Pierpont was married to Mary Sheldon Lord (1787–1855), a daughter of Mary ( Lyman) Lord and Lynde Lord. Together, they had six children, including:

* William Alston Pierpont (1811–1860), who married Mary Cecelia Ridgeway and Sara Turelle.
* Mary Elizabeth Pierpont (1812–1857), who died unmarried.
* Juliet Pierpont (1816–1884), who married Junius Spencer Morgan, and was the mother of financier John Pierpont Morgan.
* John Pierpont Jr. (1820–1879), who married Joanna LeBaron Sibley (1820–1852), a daughter of Jonas Leonard Sibley, in 1844.
* James Lord Pierpont (1822–1893), a songwriter who married Millicent Cowee in 1846. After her death, he married Eliza Jane Purse in 1857.
* Caroline Augusta Pierpont (1823–1881), who married merchant Joseph Moody Boardman.

After the death of his first wife in 1855, he remarried in 1857 to Harriet Louise ( Campbell) Fowler, the widow of George Warren Fowler and a daughter of Archibald Campbell.

He died at Medford, Massachusetts in 1866. Pierpont&#x27;s sixteen-page obituary on the front page of the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; was written by John Neal, his ex-business partner of fifty years earlier who later became an influential critic, writer, and lecturer, and who had named his second-oldest son (John Pierpont Neal) after Pierpont in 1847.

<text>Oscar Stanton De Priest (March 9, 1871 – May 12, 1951) was an American politician and civil rights advocate from Chicago. A member of the Illinois Republican Party, he served as a U.S. Representative from Illinois&#x27;s 1st congressional district from 1929 to 1935. He was the first African American to be elected to Congress in the 20th century. During his three terms, he was the only African American serving in Congress. He was also the first African-American U.S. Representative from outside the southern states.

Born in Alabama to freedmen parents, De Priest was raised in Dayton, Ohio. He studied business and made a fortune in Chicago as a contractor, and in real estate and the stock market before the Crash. A successful local politician, he was elected an alderman to the Chicago City Council in 1914, the first African American to hold that office.

In Congress in the early 1930s, he spoke out against racial discrimination, including at speaking events in the South; tried to integrate the House public restaurant; gained passage of an amendment to desegregate the Civilian Conservation Corps, one of the work programs under President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal; and introduced anti-lynching legislation to the House (it was not passed because of the Solid South Democratic opposition). In 1934, De Priest was defeated by Arthur W. Mitchell, the first African American to be elected as a Democrat to Congress. De Priest returned to Chicago and his successful business ventures, eventually returning to politics, when he was again elected an alderman in the 1940s.

==Early life==
De Priest was born in 1871 in Florence, Alabama, to freedmen, former slaves of mixed race. He had a brother named Robert. His mother, Martha Karsner, worked part-time as a laundress, and his father Neander was a teamster, associated with the Exodusters movement. After the Civil War, thousands of blacks left continued oppression by whites in the South by moving to other states that offered promises of freedom and greater economic opportunities, such as Kansas. Others moved later in the century.

In 1878, the year after Reconstruction had ended and federal troops been withdrawn from the region, the De Priests left Alabama for Salina, Kansas. Violence had increased in Alabama as whites were restoring white supremacy: the elder De Priest had to save his friend, former U.S. Representative James T. Rapier, from a lynch mob, and a black man was killed on their doorstep. The boy Oscar attended local schools in Salina.

==Career==

===Business===
De Priest studied bookkeeping at the Salina Normal School, established also for the training of teachers. In 1889, he moved to Chicago, Illinois, which had been booming as an industrial city. He worked first as an apprentice plasterer, house painter, and decorator. He became a successful contractor and real estate broker. He built a fortune in the stock market and in real estate by helping black families move into formerly all-white neighborhoods, often ones formerly occupied by ethnic white immigrants and their descendants. There was population succession in many neighborhoods under the pressure of new migrants.

===Politics===
From 1904 to 1908, De Priest was a member of the board of commissioners of Cook County, Illinois.

De Priest was elected in 1914 to the Chicago City Council, serving from 1915 to 1917 as alderman from the 2nd ward, on the South Side. He was Chicago&#x27;s first black alderman. In 1917 De Priest was indicted for alleged graft and resigned from the City Council. He hired nationally known Clarence Darrow as his defense attorney and was acquitted. He was succeeded in office by Louis B. Anderson.

In 1919, De Priest ran unsuccessfully for alderman as a member of the People&#x27;s Movement Club, a political organization he founded. In a few years, De Priest&#x27;s black political organization became the most powerful of many in Chicago, and he became the top black politician under Chicago Republican mayor William Hale Thompson.

In 1928, when Republican congressman Martin B. Madden died, Mayor Thompson selected De Priest to replace him on the ballot. He was the first African American elected to Congress outside the South and the first to be elected in the 20th century. He represented the 1st Congressional District of Illinois (which included The Loop and part of the South Side of Chicago) as a Republican. During the 1930 election, De Priest was challenged in the primary by noted African-American spokesperson, orator, and Republican Roscoe Conkling Simmons. De Priest defeated Simmons&#x27; primary challenge and won the general election afterward. During De Priest&#x27;s three consecutive terms (1929–1935), he was the only black representative in Congress. He introduced several anti-discrimination bills during these years of the Great Depression.

DePriest&#x27;s 1933 amendment barring discrimination in the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), a program of the New Deal to employ people across the country in building infrastructure, was passed by the Senate and signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. His anti-lynching bill (House Joint Resolution 171, in 1933) failed due to opposition by the white Democrats of the Solid South, although it would not have made lynching a federal crime. (Previous anti-lynching bills had also failed to pass the Senate, which was dominated by the South since its disenfranchisement of blacks at the turn of the century.) He presented the legislation with a long and detailed speech in which he read newspaper reports and legal opinions: he included the names of victims of lynchings from 1927 on, and provided graphic details of these murders. A third proposal, a bill to permit a transfer of jurisdiction if a defendant believed he or she could not get a fair trial because of race or religion, was passed by a later Congress.

Civil rights activists criticized De Priest for opposing federal aid to the poor, although they nevertheless applauded him for making public speeches in the South despite death threats. They also praised De Priest for telling an Alabama senator he was not big enough to prevent him from dining in the private Senate restaurant. (Some Congressmen ate in the Senate restaurant to avoid De Priest, who usually ate in the Members Dining Room designated for Congressmen.) The public areas of the House and Senate restaurants were segregated. The House accepted that De Priest sometimes brought black staff or visitors to the Members Dining Room, but objected when he entertained mixed groups there.

De Priest defended the right of students of Howard University, a historically black college in Washington, D.C., to eat in the public section of the House restaurant and not be restricted to a section in the basement near the kitchen, used mostly by black employees and visitors. He took this issue of discrimination against the students (and other black visitors) to a special bipartisan House committee. In a three-month-long heated debate, the Republican political minority argued that the restaurant&#x27;s discriminatory practice violated Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal access. The Democratic majority skirted the issue by claiming that the restaurant was a private facility and not open to the public. The House restaurant remained segregated through much of the 1940s and maybe as late as 1952.

Mostly aligned with the political right, De Priest generally opposed liberal federal programs under the New Deal, instead favoring increased initiatives on the state or local level. He also was vocal in his denunciation of communism, fearing that its influence would spread to disgruntled blacks. He unsuccessfully pushed to enact a special committee that would investigate the Communist Party of the United States.

In 1929, De Priest made national news when First Lady Lou Hoover invited his wife, Jessie De Priest, to a traditional tea for congressional wives at the White House.

De Priest appointed Benjamin O. Davis Jr. to the United States Military Academy at a time when the only African-American line officer in the Army was Davis&#x27;s father.

By the early 1930s, De Priest&#x27;s popularity waned because he continued to oppose higher taxes on the rich and fought Depression-era federal relief programs under President Roosevelt. De Priest was defeated in the 1934 United States House of Representatives elections by Republican-turned-Democrat African-American Arthur W. Mitchell, who campaigned on support for the New Deal. After returning to his businesses and political life in Chicago, De Priest was elected again to the Chicago City Council in 1943 as alderman of the 3rd Ward, serving until 1947. He died in Chicago at 80 and is buried in Graceland Cemetery.

==Personal life==
De Priest married the former Jessie L. Williams (September 3, 1870 – March 31, 1961). They had two sons together: Laurence W. (1899 – July 28, 1916), who died at the age of 16. and Oscar Stanton De Priest Jr. (May 24, 1906 – November 8, 1983) A great-grandson of Oscar De Priest Jr., Philip R. DePriest, became the administrator of his estate after his grandmother&#x27;s death in 1992. This included his great-grandfather&#x27;s Oscar Stanton De Priest House, now a National Historic Landmark, which still held his locked political office. This had not been touched since about 1951. This great-grandson has been working to restore the office and house, and assessing the political archives—&quot;a veritable treasure trove.&quot;

<text>James Robinson Planché (27 February 1796 – 30 May 1880) was a British dramatist, antiquary and officer of arms. Over a period of approximately 60 years he wrote, adapted, or collaborated on 176 plays in a wide range of genres including extravaganza, farce, comedy, burletta, melodrama and opera. Planché was responsible for introducing historically accurate costume into nineteenth century British theatre, and subsequently became an acknowledged expert on historical costume, publishing a number of works on the topic.

Planché&#x27;s interest in historical costume led to other antiquarian research, including heraldry and genealogy. He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1829, and was influential in the foundation of the British Archaeological Association in 1843. Appointed Rouge Croix Pursuivant in 1854 and promoted to Somerset Herald in 1866, Planché undertook heraldic and ceremonial duties as a member of the College of Arms. These included proclaiming peace at the end of the Crimean War and investing foreign monarchs with the Order of the Garter.

==Early and personal life==
James Robinson Planché was born in Old Burlington St, Piccadilly, London in 1796 to Jacques Planché and Catherine Emily Planché. His parents were first cousins and descendants of Huguenot refugees who had fled to England in 1685 following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Jacques Planché was a moderately prosperous watchmaker, a trade he had learned in Geneva, and was personally known to King George III. His name was pronounced &quot;plank&quot; or &quot;planky&quot; for the beginning of his life, but he added, or rather re-added, the accent to his name, restoring the French pronunciation. However, after doing this, editors would sometimes jab at Planché writing &quot;that a particular work of &#x27;Mr. Plank&#x27; was &#x27;wooden.

Planché was educated at home until the age of eight by his mother (who had written a treatise on education). He did not continue his home education, as his mother took ill and died when Planché was nine years old. He was then sent to boarding school where, in his words: &quot;&quot;I was &quot;im&quot;perfected, and &quot;un&quot;taught the French I spoke fluently as a child.&quot;&quot; In 1808 he was apprenticed to a French landscape painter, Monsieur de Court, where he studied perspective and geometry, which would later help him in his theatre endeavours. However this apprenticeship was curtailed by de Court&#x27;s death two years later. Planché was then articled as an apprentice to a bookseller, with the hope that this would also give him the opportunity to sell some of his own writings. This is where Planché considered his &quot;theatrical propensities&quot; began to develop.

During this period he joined an amateur theatre company, in which he acted and wrote plays. The manuscript of one of these early plays, &quot;Amoroso, King of Little Britain&quot;, was by chance seen by the comic actor John Pritt Harley, who, recognising its potential, brought about (and acted in) its performance at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Its favourable reception launched Planché on his theatrical career.

==Marriage and family==
On 26 April 1821, Planché married Elizabeth St George, a playwright. She wrote &quot;The Welsh Girl&quot; for the Olympic Theatre shortly after its opening in 1831 and, emboldened by its successful reception, continued to write for the stage. Among her more successful plays were &quot;A Handsome Husband&quot; and &quot;A Pleasant Neighbour&quot;, both at the Olympic, and &quot;The Sledge Driver&quot; and &quot;The Ransom&quot;, both produced at the Haymarket Theatre. From viewing their plays, it&#x27;s thought that they collaborated, as he excelled in &quot;playful dialog&quot;, and she excelled in &quot;sentimental and melodramatic scenes&quot;. Elizabeth Planché died in 1846 after a long illness. The couple had two daughters, Katherine Frances, born in 1823, and Matilda Anne, born in 1825. Katherine married William Curteis Whelan of Heronden Hall, Tenterden, Kent in 1851.

Matilda achieved success as an author of children&#x27;s books (using the pen name Susie Sunbeam), beginning in 1849 with &quot;A Trap to Catch a Sunbeam&quot;, which subsequently went through 42 editions. She married the Rev. Henry Mackarness in 1852, and with him had eleven children, four of whom did not survive infancy. Taking after her father in terms of writing output, Matilda Mackarness produced an average of one book a year until her death, most of them under her married name. Her husband&#x27;s death in 1868 left her with little means of supporting her family, as the books did not produce much income. She and her children moved in with her father.

==Life==
Despite his large number of successful plays, Planché was never particularly wealthy, and he felt pressure from needing to support his grandchildren. Circumstances improved when in 1871 he was awarded a civil list pension of £100 per annum &#x27;in recognition of his literary services&#x27;. Planché died at his home in Chelsea on 30 May 1880 at the age of 84. His wealth at the time of his death was under £1000.

Planché &quot;greatly enjoyed moving in society and meeting the well-known&quot;. He was a regular attender at &quot;conversaziones&quot;, breakfasts and &quot;soireés&quot; where he &quot;met and was introduced to most of the notabilities then living in London&quot;. In 1831 he was a founding member of the Garrick Club. His autobiography contains many anecdotes of his acquaintances in theatrical and literary circles. Planché was also much esteemed in private life.

==Theatrical career==

===Early career and libretti===

Planché&#x27;s career as a playwright began, as already mentioned, in 1818 when &quot;Amoroso, King of Little Britain&quot;, a play he had written for an amateur performance at a private theatre, was seen by John Pritt Harley and subsequently performed at Drury Lane. The play was a success and Harley, along with Stephen Kemble and Robert William Elliston, encouraged Planché to take up play-writing full-time. Planché did so; his next play to be performed was a pantomime at Christmas of that same year. A further six of his plays were performed in 1819, the same number in 1820, and eleven in 1821, most of these at the Adelphi Theatre, but also including some at the Lyceum, the Olympic and Sadler&#x27;s Wells. Planché&#x27;s early works were &quot;generally unremarkable&quot;, one exception in this period being &quot;The Vampire, or, The Bride of the Isles&quot;, produced at the Lyceum in August 1820, an adaptation of Charles Nodier&#x27;s &quot;Le Vampire&quot; (this was a dramatisation of John Polidori&#x27;s novel &quot;The Vampyre&quot;). The play featured the innovative &quot;vampire trap&quot;, a trapdoor in the stage which allowed an actor to disappear (or appear) almost instantly. &quot;Kenilworth Castle, or, the Days of Queen Bess&quot;, produced 8 February 1821, was also very successful. Planché wrote a total of 176 plays.

Planché held the position of stock author (in-house writer) at the Adelphi for a short period in 1821, before moving to a similar position at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden. In 1822 he wrote the libretto (and some of the music) for his first full-scale opera, &quot;Maid Marian; or, the Huntress of Arlingford&quot;. In 1826 he wrote the libretto for another opera, &quot;Oberon, or the Elf-King&#x27;s Oath&quot;, the final work of composer Carl Maria von Weber, who died a few months after its completion. While this opera was a commercial success and received a favourable critical response at the time, subsequent critics have not appreciated Planché&#x27;s libretto.

In 1838 Planché was to collaborate on an opera with another notable composer, Felix Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn originally approved of Planché&#x27;s choice of topic, Edward III&#x27;s siege of Calais in the Hundred Years War, and responded positively to the first two acts of the libretto. But, after Mendelssohn received the final act, he expressed doubts about the subject, asked Planché to start work on a completely new libretto, and eventually stopped replying to Planché&#x27;s letters. The opera never came to production.

===Historical costume, dramatic copyright, tableaux vivants===

In August 1823, in an issue of &quot;The Album&quot;, he published an article saying that more attention should be paid to the time period of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, especially when it comes to costumes. In the same year, a casual conversation led to one of Planché&#x27;s more lasting effects on British theatre. He observed to Charles Kemble, the manager of Covent Garden, that &quot;while a thousand pounds were frequently lavished upon a Christmas pantomime or an Easter spectacle, the plays of Shakespeare were put upon the stage with makeshift scenery, and, at the best, a new dress or two for the principal characters&quot;. Kemble &quot;saw the possible advantage of correct appliances catching the taste of the town&quot;, and agreed to give Planché control of the costuming for the upcoming production of &quot;King John&quot;, if he would carry out the research, design the costumes and superintend the production. Planché had little experience in this area and sought the help of antiquaries such as Francis Douce and Sir Samuel Meyrick. The research involved sparked Planché&#x27;s latent antiquarian interests; these came to occupy an increasing amount of his time later in life.

Despite the actors&#x27; reservations, &quot;King John&quot; was a success and led to a number of similarly costumed Shakespeare productions by Kemble and Planché (&quot;Henry IV, Part I&quot;, &quot;As You Like It&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;). The designs and renderings of &quot;King John&quot;, &quot;Henry IV&quot;, &quot;As You Like It&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Merchant of Venice&quot; were published, though there is no evidence that &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Merchant of Venice&quot; were ever produced with Planché&#x27;s historically accurate costume designs. Planché also wrote a number of plays or adaptations which were staged with historically accurate costumes (&quot;Cortez&quot;, &quot;The Woman Never Vext&quot;, &quot;The Merchant&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, &quot;Charles XII&quot;, &quot;The Partisans&quot;, &quot;The Brigand Chief&quot;, and &quot;Hofer&quot;). After 1830, although he still used period costume, he no longer claimed historical accuracy for his work in plays. His work in &quot;King John&quot; had brought about a &quot;revolution in nineteenth-century stage practice&quot;, which lasted for almost a century.

In 1828 Planché left Covent Garden and went to work for Stephen Price at Drury Lane. His first play during this period, &quot;Charles XII&quot;, was staged in December of that year and was a great success. Prior to its publication (which would have allowed any theatre to produce it without charge), Planché received an enquiry from Murray, the manager of the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh who wished to stage the piece. Planché named a &quot;modest sum&quot; of £10 for the privilege which Murray said he could not pay, citing the poor financial situation of his theatre. But he acquired a manuscript copy of the play and staged it without permission.

This prompted Planché to begin campaigning for copyright to be extended to dramatic works. He gathered a group of dramatists (including John Poole, James Kenney, Joseph Lunn and Richard Brinsley Peak) who prevailed upon writer and MP George Lamb to introduce a bill in Parliament; but the bill did not pass its third reading. In 1832 Edward Bulwer-Lytton, a novelist and MP, was successful in getting a select committee set up to consider dramatic copyright, as well as theatrical censorship and the monopoly of the patent theatres on drama. Planché gave evidence before the select committee; the following year the Dramatic Copyright Act 1833 (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. 15) was passed.

In the production of his &quot;The Brigand&quot;, Planché created &quot;tableaux vivants&quot; of three recent paintings by Charles Eastlake: &quot;An Italian Brigand Chief Reposing&quot;, &quot;The Wife of a Brigand Chief Watching the Result of a Battle&quot;, and &quot;The Dying Brigand&quot;. This feature was a success and widely copied. Paintings inspired his work in a number of other plays. For &quot;The Golden Branch&quot; (1847) and &quot;Love and Fortune&quot; (1859), he created costumes based on the paintings of Watteau. The latter play, which was subtitled &quot;A Dramatic Tableau (in Watteau Colours)&quot;, also included a &quot;tableau&quot; from Watteau&#x27;s &quot;Noces de Village&quot;.

===Extravaganzas and revues===
After a brief period as acting-manager of the Adelphi Theatre, Planché moved to the Olympic Theatre when Lucia Vestris took over the management in 1831. He provided the first play which she produced, &quot;Olympic Revels, or, Prometheus and Pandora&quot;. This began a professional relationship which lasted over two decades. Planché went with Vestris and her husband, Charles Mathews, when they took over management of Covent Garden in 1839, then with them to Drury Lane in 1842. From 1843 he spent four years at the Haymarket with Benjamin Webster, before returning to Vestris and Matthews at the Lyceum, where he stayed until leaving London in 1852. During his time with Vestris, he undertook the roles of &quot;playwright, librettist, general advisor and superintendent of the decorative departments&quot;.
&quot;Olympic Revels&quot; was Planché&#x27;s first example of &quot;that form of travestie which is commonly described as &#x27;classical&#x27;—which deals with the characteristics and adventures of gods and goddesses, heroes and heroines, of the Greek and Latin mythology and fable&quot;, a genre of which he was later credited as originator. Planché used costume for comedic effect, not by the costumes being comic, but by the incongruity of realistic historical dress being juxtaposed with the actions of the actors. For example, &quot;Olympic Revels&quot; opens with the gods of Olympus in classical Greek dress playing whist. By 1836 these classical burlesques had become so popular that other writers were copying them.

Feeling the need to do something different, Planché turned to a translation of the &quot;féerie folie&quot; (French: fairy tale) &quot;Riquet à la Houppe&quot;, which he had written some years earlier. The play was a success, and became the first of 23 &quot;fairy extravaganzas&quot;, most of which were based on the fairy tales of Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy. Planché&#x27;s fascination with her work led the press to refer to him as Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy&#x27;s &quot;preux chevalier&quot; (French: devoted knight) and similar epithets. Planché&#x27;s coined the term &quot;extravaganza&quot;, defining it as &quot;the whimsical treatment of a poetical subject&quot;.

In 1879 two of his friends published his extravaganzas, together with some of his other works, as a five-volume set, entitled &quot;The Extravaganzas of J. R. Planché, esq., (Somerset Herald) 1825–1871&quot;. The fairy tales were not originally children&#x27;s stories, but sophisticated works intended for an adult audience. Planché&#x27;s scholarly approach was exhibited in this area as well; he &quot;translated two volumes of fairy tales by Mme D&#x27;Aulnoy, Perrault, and others, which were for the first time given in their integrity with biographical and historical notes and dissertations.&quot;

Borrowing from the French again, Planché introduced the revue to British theatre, as a commentary on recent events, particularly events in the theatre. His first revue, &quot;Success; or, a hit if you like it&quot;, was produced in 1825. He wrote another seven over the next 30 years, a peak of four in the years 1853–1855.

As an example of the style of these works, &quot;Mr Buckstone&#x27;s Voyage Round the Globe&quot; (1854), which played at the Haymarket Theatre, includes the words:

===Retirement and legacy===
Planché semi-retired from the theatre in 1852 and went to live in Kent with his younger daughter (although he returned to London two years later on his appointment as Rouge Croix Pursuivant). He continued to write occasionally for the theatre, but only produced 16 more pieces between 1852 and 1871.

Critics writing at the end of the nineteenth century praised Planché with sentiments such as &quot;[Planché] raised theatrical extravaganza and burlesque to the dignity of a fine art, and wrote verses to be sung on the stage which could be read with pleasure in the study.&quot; and &quot;I am quite certain that such masters of lyrical writing as W. S. Gilbert ... would confirm me in my opinion that the songs and lyrics in the extravaganzas of Planché were as faultless in tone, tact and taste as they were rhythmically perfect&quot;. (The converse was also true; Planché approved of, and strongly influenced Gilbert&#x27;s works) Planché&#x27;s dramatic reputation was already fading before his death, and continued to do so in the twentieth century. He is still remembered for his influence on and contributions to British theatre over a long career.

==Antiquarian career==

Planché&#x27;s research to determine historically accurate costume for the 1823 production of &quot;King John&quot; led to his developing a strong interest in the subject. When he published his first major work in 1834, &quot;History of British Costume from the Earliest Period to the Close of the 18th Century&quot;, Planché described it as &quot;the result of ten years&#x27; diligent devotion to its study of every leisure hour left me by my professional engagements&quot;. Prior to this Planché had published his costume designs for &quot;King John&quot; and the other Shakespeare plays, with &quot;biographical, critical and explanatory notices&quot;. After travelling twice to the Continent, he wrote about his journeys in &quot;Lays and Legends of the Rhine&quot; (1826) and &quot;Descent of the Danube&quot; (1827).

Planché&#x27;s scholarship was recognised in his election in 1829 as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He was a regular attendee at the Society&#x27;s meetings and contributed to its journal, &quot;Archaeologia&quot;. However, he became dissatisfied with its management, complaining of &quot;the lethargy into which the Society of Antiquaries had fallen, the dreariness of its meetings, the want of interest in its communications and the reluctance of its council to listen to any suggestions for its improvement&quot;. In 1843–4 Planché was involved in the foundation of the British Archaeological Association, of which he was later Vice-President, and for more than twenty years the Secretary. Planché resigned his membership of the Society of Antiquaries in 1852, in which year he also moved to Kent to live with his younger daughter.

Besides his &quot;History of British Costume&quot;, Planché contributed to a number of other works on costume. He wrote an article on &quot;The History of Stage Costume&quot; in &quot;The Book of Table Talk&quot;, edited by Charles MacFarlane, in 1836. He also provided the chapters on costume and furniture for &quot;The Pictorial History of England&quot; by MacFarlane and George Craik, as well as an introduction on costume for most of the plays in &quot;The Pictorial Edition of the Works of Shakespeare&quot; by Charles Knight. In 1842–43 Planché edited &quot;Regal and Ecclesiastical Antiquities of England&quot; and &quot;A Complete View of the Dresses and Habits of the People of England&quot; by Joseph Strutt. In 1848 he contributed &quot;Remarks on some of his sketches for Masques and dramas&quot; to Peter Cunningham&#x27;s &quot;Inigo Jones: A Life of the Architect&quot;. In 1879 Planché completed his most ambitious work on costume history, &quot;A Cyclopedia of Costume, or, Dictionary of Dress&quot;, two volumes totalling almost 1000 pages.

Planché&#x27;s expertise in historical dress was not only of interest to his fellow antiquarians. During her reign Queen Victoria held a number of &quot;bals costumés&quot; at which the attendees had to wear costume of a specified era. Planché&#x27;s advice was much in demand in the periods leading up to these balls as invited guests had costumes made.

His antiquarian interests also included armour. In 1834 he published &quot;A Catalogue of the Collection of Ancient Arms and Armour, the property of Bernard Brocas, with a prefatory notice&quot;. In 1857 Planché was invited to arrange the collection of armour formerly belonging to his friend Sir Samuel Meyrick for the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester, a task which he repeated in South Kensington in 1868. Concerned by the state of the armour in the Tower of London, Planché wrote several reports on the subject between 1855 and 1869. In that year, the War Office invited him to rearrange the collection in chronological order, which was one of the things for which he had been campaigning.

Among his works on other topics were two with royal connections—&quot;Regal Records, or a Chronicle of the Coronation of the Queens Regnant of England,&quot; prompted by the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1837, and &quot;The Conqueror and his Companions&quot;, published in two volumes in 1874.

Planché&#x27;s personal life inspired two works. In 1864 he published &quot;A Corner of Kent, or some account of the parish of Ash-next-Sandwich&quot;, the result of three years&#x27; work on what was originally intended as a short guidebook to antiquities within the parish of his son-in-law, the Rev. Henry Mackarness. In 1872 he published his autobiography, a two-volume work entitled &quot;The Recollections and Reflections of J. R. Planché (Somerset Herald): a professional biography&quot;, containing many anecdotes of his life in the theatre.

In addition, Planché produced over 100 papers and articles on a wide range of topics. His obituary in the &quot;Journal of the British Archaeological Association&quot; mentions in passing such topics as the following:

Naval uniforms of Great Britain, early armorial bearings, processional weapons, horn-shaped headdresses of the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the clarion, the Stanley crest, ancient and medieval tapestries, armorials of Ferres and Peverel, the Cokayne monuments at Ashbourne, the tilting and other helmets, the family of Giffard, the Earls of Strigul (the Lords of Chepstow), relics of Charles I, the Earls and Dukes of Somerset, the statuary of the west front of Wells Cathedral, various effigies, brasses and portraits, the first Earl of Norfolk, the family of Fettiplace, monuments in Shrewsbury Abbey, the Neville monuments, the Earls of Sussex, of Gloucester and of Hereford, and the Fairford windows.
==Heraldic career==
His antiquarian studies led Planché to take an interest in heraldry. He had published several papers on heraldic topics in the &quot;Journal of the British Archaeological Association&quot; before publishing in 1852 &quot;The Pursuivant of Arms, or, Heraldry founded upon facts&quot;. As indicated by the subtitle, Planché was concerned with verifiable facts, as opposed to the unfounded theories perpetuated by many earlier heraldic writers. In the view of eminent herald Sir Anthony Wagner, Planché rewrote the early history of heraldry.

Two years later a vacancy occurred at the College of Arms, the office responsible for administering English heraldic affairs. Planché was offered, and accepted, the position of &quot;Rouge Croix Pursuivant&quot;, one of the four junior-most officers of arms. Some years previously he had indicated his interest in becoming an officer of arms, should a vacancy arise, to the Duke of Norfolk, who as Earl Marshal is responsible for the College of Arms. Planché was also an acquaintance of Charles Young, Garter King of Arms, the principal officer of arms at the college.

Planché moved back to London on becoming &quot;Rouge Croix&quot;. For three years from the end of 1856, he focused on the duties of his new office and his scholarly pursuits. Planché&#x27;s new office also carried with it ceremonial duties. On four occasions he was part of diplomatic missions to invest foreign monarchs with the Order of the Garter: to King Pedro V of Portugal in 1858, and his successor King Luis in 1865, to Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria in 1867 and to King Umberto I of Italy in 1878. Planché also participated in state ceremonial within England; in 1856 he and other officers of arms proclaimed peace following the conclusion of the Crimean War. This was supposed to take place &quot;according to precedent&quot;, but the &#x27;stage management&#x27; of the event left something to be desired; among other things the gates at Temple Bar, where the officers of arms customarily demand entry to the City of London, were left open.

In 1866 Planché was promoted to the office of Somerset Herald. For most of that year he was engaged in editing &quot;Clarke&#x27;s Introduction to Heraldry&quot;. During his heraldic duties, Planché came across a hitherto-neglected manuscript in the collections of the College of Arms; this became known as &quot;Planché&#x27;s Roll&quot;, since he was the first to draw attention to it. He also left another heraldic legacy; Ursula Cull, the wife of future Garter King of Arms Sir George Bellew, was a descendant of Planché&#x27;s daughter Matilda.

===Coat of arms===

Planché was granted arms in 1857, a few years after his appointment as Rouge Croix pursuivant. These are blazoned:
* (Arms) &quot;Vert a Tower Proper between three Roundels Argent each charged with a Cross Gules&quot;.
* (Crest) &quot;A Demi-Lion rampant guardant Argent billetty Gules holding between the paws a silver Roundel charged as in the arms&quot;
* (Motto) &quot;En poursuivant la vérité&quot;

The &quot;Roundels Argent charged with a Cross Gules&quot; (white circles with a red cross) allude to the badge of office of Rouge Croix. Planché used his coat of arms on his bookplate, and the crest alone on his writing paper. When he was promoted to Somerset Herald, Planché surrounded the crest on his writing paper with a collar of Esses. While he was entitled to the collar by his appointment as herald, its inclusion in his armorial bearings was considered somewhat unusual.

<doc id="1191247" wikidata="Q3116545" url="?curid=1191247" title="Gretsch 6120">
<text>The Gretsch 6120 is a hollow body electric guitar with f-holes, manufactured by Gretsch and first appearing in the mid-1950s with the endorsement of Chet Atkins. It was quickly adopted by rockabilly artists Eddie Cochran, Duane Eddy, and later by Eric Clapton, Brian Setzer, Reverend Horton Heat, and many others. Pete Townshend received one as a gift from Joe Walsh in 1970, which he would later use on recordings for &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;. It has been Manu Chao’s preferred electric guitar to play live since 2002. Poison Ivy Rorschach of The Cramps notably played a 1958 Gretsch 6120, which she bought in 1985. She said it was her favourite guitar to play. 
After George Harrison played Gretsch Country Gentleman and Tennessean models (which, like the 6120, were developed with and endorsed by Chet Atkins), Gretsch found that they could scarcely keep up with demand.

==Production history==
The 6120 was the first in the line of &quot;Chet Atkins&quot; signature Gretsch Guitars. The prototype for the 6120 was first presented to Chet Atkins in 1954 and was labeled as a Streamliner Special with the serial number 13753. A second prototype was made, adding a vibrato tailpiece and a metal nut. Both prototypes had an unbound headstock, which didn&#x27;t carry over to the production models of the 6120 when it debuted in 1955.

Originally priced at $385, the 6120 was quite expensive compared to models from other companies, such as Gibson&#x27;s Les Paul Goldtop which retailed at $225 or Fender&#x27;s Telecaster at $189.50.

In 1958, the thumbnail &quot;neoclassic&quot; fret markers were introduced. The DeArmond pickups were discontinued, with Gretsch using their own Filter&#x27;Tron humbuckers.

Due to changes in musical tastes and changes in Gretsch company ownership in the late 1960s resulting in deteriorating quality, production of the 6120 ceased in the late 1970s. Values of the existing instruments soared when rockabilly artist Brian Setzer of the Stray Cats was seen playing an old 6120 in his early 1980s music videos. Gretsch subsequently went back into the guitar business and new 6120 guitars are widely available.

Today, a wide range of 6120 models are available, including an assortment of Brian Setzer signature models and faithful reissues of 1950s classics. Like most Gretsch guitars, production is now based in Japan at the Terada factory, although custom-shop American-made 6120s are also available.

==Variants==
Note that in the mid-1960s, the proper name of the 6120 changed from &quot;6120 Chet Atkins Hollow Body&quot; to &quot;6120 Nashville&quot;, but the original name is again in use, although a Brian Setzer signature model is called the &quot;Brian Setzer Nashville&quot; (another 6120 is called the Brian Setzer Hot Rod).

<text>Gerhard Mennen &quot;Soapy&quot; Williams (February 23, 1911 – February 2, 1988) was an American politician who served as the 41st governor of Michigan, elected in 1948 and serving six two-year terms in office. He later served as Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and as chief justice of the Michigan Supreme Court.

Williams advocated for civil rights, racial equality, and justice for the poor. As assistant secretary of state, his remark that &quot;what we want for the Africans is what they want for themselves&quot;, reported in the press as &quot;Africa for the Africans&quot;, sparked controversy at the time.

A staunch liberal, Williams was described by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; as a political reformer who &quot;helped forge the alliance between Democrats, blacks and union voters in the late 1940s that began a strong liberal tradition in Michigan.&quot;

== Personal life and early career==
Williams was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Henry P. Williams and Elma Mennen. His mother came from a prominent family; her father, Gerhard Heinrich Mennen, was the founder of the Mennen brand of men&#x27;s personal care products. Because of this, Williams acquired the popular nickname &quot;Soapy&quot;.

Williams attended the Salisbury School in Connecticut, an exclusive Episcopal preparatory school. He graduated from Princeton University with an A.B. in history in 1933 after completing a senior thesis titled &quot;Social Significance of Henry Ford&quot;. At Princeton, Williams was a member of the Quadrangle Club. He then received a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Michigan Law School. While at law school, Williams became affiliated with the Democratic Party, departing from his family&#x27;s strong ties to the Republican Party.

Williams met Nancy Quirk on a blind date while attending the university. She was the daughter of D. L. Quirk and Julia (Trowbridge) Quirk, a prominent Ypsilanti family involved in banking and paper milling. Her brother, Daniel Quirk, was later mayor of Ypsilanti. The couple married in 1937 and had three children; a son, G. Mennen Williams Jr., and two daughters, Nancy Ketterer III and Wendy Stock Williams.

He worked with the law firm Griffiths, Williams and Griffiths from 1936 to 1941. Law firm partners included Hicks Griffiths and Martha Griffiths, later elected a member of Congress and lieutenant governor of Michigan.

During World War II, he served four years in the United States Navy as an air combat intelligence officer in the South Pacific. He achieved the rank of lieutenant commander and earned ten battle stars. He later served as the deputy director of the Office of Price Administration from 1946 to 1947, and was named to the Michigan Liquor Control Commission in 1947.

== Governor of Michigan ==

On November 2, 1948, Williams was elected governor of Michigan, defeating Governor Kim Sigler with the support of labor unions and dissident Republicans. He was elected to a record six two-year terms in that post. Among his accomplishments was the construction of the Mackinac Bridge. He appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; September 15, 1952, issue, sporting his signature green bow tie with white polka dots.

Williams believed the Michigan Department of Corrections was underfunded and outdated, and that the state&#x27;s prisons were dangerously overcrowded. While visiting Marquette Branch Prison in July 1950, Williams was attacked and briefly held hostage by a group of three inmates hoping to escape. The governor had a knife held to his throat, but his attackers were soon overpowered by his bodyguard and prison employees. One of his attackers was shot dead. Williams was unharmed and mostly unshaken, choosing to continue on with his tour of the Upper Peninsula. He used the attack to his political advantage, blaming it on budget cuts made by the Republican-controlled Michigan Legislature. Later in the same year, Williams gained prominence for his refusal to extradite Haywood Patterson, one of the Scottsboro Boys, who had escaped from prison in Alabama in 1948 and hidden in Detroit for two years.

Also during Williams&#x27;s 12 years in office, a farm-marketing program was sanctioned, teachers&#x27; salaries, school facilities and educational programs were improved and there were also commissions formed to research problems related to aging, sex offenders and adolescent behavior.

Williams named the first woman judge in the state&#x27;s history as well as the first black judge. As a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1956, he unsuccessfully sought the vice-presidential nomination. At the 1952, 1956 and 1960 conventions he fought for insertion of a strong civil rights plank in the party platform. He strongly opposed the selection of Lyndon Baines Johnson as vice president in 1960, feeling that Johnson was &quot;ideologically wrong on civil rights&quot;. Williams made public his opposition, shouting &quot;No&quot; when a call was made for Johnson&#x27;s nomination to be made unanimous. He was the only delegate to publicly oppose Johnson&#x27;s nomination.

His final term in office was marked by high-profile struggles with the Republican-controlled state legislature and a near-shutdown of the state government. He therefore chose not to seek reelection in 1960. Williams left office on January 1, 1961.

== Post-gubernatorial years ==

After leaving office in 1961, Williams assumed the post of Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs in the administration of President John F. Kennedy. His remark at a press conference that &quot;what we want for the Africans is what they want for themselves&quot;, reported in the press as &quot;Africa for the Africans&quot;, sparked controversy. Whites in South Africa and Rhodesia, and in the British and Portuguese colonies contended that Williams wanted them expelled from the continent. Williams defended his remarks, saying that he included white Africans as Africans. Williams was defended by Kennedy at a press conference, saying that &quot;Africa for the Africans does not seem to me to be an unreasonable statement.&quot; Kennedy said that Williams made it clear he was referring to Africans of all colors, and &quot;I don&#x27;t know who else Africa should be for.&quot;

He served in this post until early 1966, when he resigned to unsuccessfully challenge Republican US senator Robert P. Griffin. Two years later, he was named by President Lyndon B. Johnson to be U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, where he served less than a year.

In 1969 he wrote a book on the emergence of modern Africa, &quot;Africa for the Africans&quot;.

== Michigan Supreme Court ==
Williams was elected to the Michigan Supreme Court in 1970 and was named chief justice in 1983, serving in that capacity through 1986. Thus, like William Howard Taft in the federal government, he occupied the highest executive and judicial offices in Michigan government.

== Retirement and death ==
Williams left the court on January 1, 1987, and died the following year in Detroit at the age of 76, three weeks before his 77th birthday. He was temporarily entombed at Evergreen Cemetery in Detroit and there was a formal military funeral for him. After winter his remains were interred at the Protestant Cemetery on Mackinac Island. His &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary said of Williams&#x27;s diplomatic service: &quot;Traveling widely, he studied the needs of countries in the birth pangs of independence and brought their pleas for American investment and trust to Washington.&quot;

== Honors ==

The state government&#x27;s law building, G. Mennen Williams State Office Building in Lansing, constructed in 1967, was dedicated in Williams&#x27;s honor on June 1, 1997.

A G. Mennen Williams dinner is an annual event held by the Ionia County Democratic Party each July at the World&#x27;s Largest Free Fair in Ionia, Michigan. Originally called the Democratic Tent Dinner at its start in the mid-40s, it was renamed after Soapy in 1988 as a way to pay homage to the man that paved the way for dinners to be held at the fair. The Ionia Republican Party had held dinners at the fairgrounds during the 1940s, but the Democrats could not until Soapy stepped up and gained the party equal access in 1949.

A portion of Interstate 75 in Cheboygan County is known as the G. Mennen Williams Highway.

At the University of Detroit Mercy School of Law, the Moot Court Board of Advocates hosts the annual G. Mennen Williams Moot Court Competition for all first-year students through their Applied Legal Theory and Analysis course. First year students draft a dispositive motion and brief in support as part of their writing course, and argue their position before a mock tribunal.

<text>Robert Pollok (19 October 1798 – 15 September 1827) was a Scottish poet best known for his work, &quot;The Course of Time&quot;, published in the year of his death.

==Biography==
Pollok was born at North Moorhouse Farm, Loganswell, Renfrewshire, Scotland (now East Renfrewshire). Sources differ on the exact year of his birth, some giving 1789, some 1798, and some 1799. He studied at the University of Glasgow for the ministry of the United Secession Church. During this time, he anonymously published three poems: &quot;Helen of the Glen&quot;, &quot;The Persecuted Family&quot;, and &quot;Ralph Gemmell&quot;. After Pollok&#x27;s death, these would be published together under his name as &quot;Tales of the Covenanters&quot;.

In 1827, shortly before leaving the university, Pollok published what was to be his final and most famous work, &quot;The Course of Time&quot;, a ten-book poem in blank verse. By its fourth edition, &quot;The Course of Time&quot; had sold 78,000 copies and was popular as far away as North America.

Later that year, suffering from tuberculosis, Pollok was advised by his doctors to travel to Italy. He left Scotland with this intention, but his health worsened rapidly, and he died at Shirley (now a part of Southampton), England on 15 September.

He was buried in the nearby churchyard of St Nicholas, Millbrook. When the church was demolished, his memorial obelisk was removed and now stands in the grounds of Holy Trinity Church, Millbrook. Another monument to Pollok stands south of Newton Mearns, at his birthplace of Loganswell, Scotland, at the junction of the Glasgow/Ayr Road and the old Mearns Road. It was unveiled on 24 September 1900, and bears the inscription &quot;Robert Pollok, Author of &#x27;The Course of Time&#x27; / Born 1798 Died 1827 / He soared untrodden heights and seemed at home&quot;.

<doc id="1191253" wikidata="Q2531228" url="?curid=1191253" title="Euskadiko Ezkerra">
<text>Euskadiko Ezkerra (EE; ) was a Basque socialist political organisation. It was founded as a coalition of Euskal Iraultzarako Alderdia (EIA, &quot;Basque Party for Revolution&quot; or &quot;Party for Basque Revolution&quot;) and other Basque Marxist forces in 1977 to present lists for the Spanish general elections in the constituencies of Biscay, Gipuzkoa and Álava, while Navarrese Left Union (UNAI), an allied coalition, was to present a list in the constituency of Navarre.

==History==

EE&#x27;s list in Gipuzkoa won one seat in the Spanish Congress for Francisco Letamendia, one in the Senate for Juan María Bandrés, a lawyer for ETA members, and none in the other constituencies. Many prominent members of EE eventually separated from the coalition and integrated into Herri Batasuna (HB). EE called for &quot;no&quot; in the Referendum for Spanish Constitution in 1978.
Several of the members of ETA (pm) joined peaceful political action in EE after they abandoned violence and negotiated pardons from the Spanish government.

In 1982, it merged with some sectors of PCE-EPK (the Basque branch of PCE) and became a party under the name EE-IPS, &quot;Euskadiko Ezkerra-Izquierda para el Socialismo&quot; (&quot;Left for Socialism&quot;), while often using the simpler name Euskadiko Ezkerra. Its general secretary in this period was Mario Onaindia, a former ETA member during the Franco era, later replaced by Kepa Aulestia.

EE called for a &quot;no&quot; on the membership of Spain in NATO in the referendum held in 1986. While the &quot;yes&quot; vote won nationally, the &quot;no&quot; campaign triumphed in the Basque Autonomous Community.

After the split of the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) and the creation of Eusko Alkartasuna (EA) in 1987, EE established several coalitions with the latter. In 1991 EE entered in the government of the Basque Autonomous Community in coalition with both PNV and EA.

Later, in 1991, a majority of party affiliates approved a merger with Socialist Party of the Basque Country (PSE), the branch of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) for the Basque Autonomous Community. The resulting party is the current PSE-EE.

However, a section of Euskadiko Ezkerra disagreed with the PSE merger, and, since the Euskadiko Ezkerra name was retained by the majority of members who approved the merger with the PSE, the remaining faction went on to create a new party, Euskal Ezkerra (EuE, &quot;Basque Left&quot;) which, in turn, merged soon after with Eusko Alkartasuna.

<text>John Pomfret (1667–1702) was an English poet and clergyman.

==Early life and education==
John Pomfret was the son of Thomas Pomfret, vicar of Luton, and was educated at Bedford School. His mother was Catherine Dobson, the only surviving daughter of English Civil War painter, William Dobson. After graduating from Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge Pomfret was appointed rector of Maulden in Bedfordshire in 1695.

==Poetry==
He published a number of poems, and was regarded as significant enough in his time to be included by Samuel Johnson in his &quot;Lives of the Poets.&quot; &#x27;The Choice&#x27; is the poem for which Pomfret is now probably most remembered, especially as it was chosen by Roger Lonsdale as the first poem in &quot;The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth Century Verse&quot;. It is a poem which celebrates an ideal life of genteel moderation in the country. 

==Personal life==
Although Pomfret was married, &#x27;The Choice&#x27; suggests the ideal life to be that of a bachelor, who can spend his days among the classics in his library and drinking (moderately) with two &#x27;brave, gen&#x27;rous and witty&#x27; friends. However, he would also like there to be a &#x27;witty nymph&#x27; living nearby whose &#x27;conversation&#x27; would give his life a keen edge. Unfortunately for Pomfret this last sentiment led indirectly to his death at the young age of 35. 

He had travelled to London to seek preferment from Dr. Henry Compton, Bishop of London, but the bishop had been informed that in &#x27;The Choice&#x27; Pomfret had advocated the keeping of a mistress. He therefore kept Pomfret waiting in London. It was here that Pomfret caught the smallpox which killed him. 

It was once believed by some critics that he was a follower of Albaudism but this appears to have been the result of a misinterpretation of his poetry.

Pomfret&#x27;s son Richard (1702-1751) served as Rouge Croix Pursuivant at the College of Arms.

<text>Lilium bulbiferum, common names orange lily, fire lily, Jimmy&#x27;s Bane, tiger lily and St. John&#x27;s Lily, is a herbaceous European lily with underground bulbs, belonging to the Liliaceae.

The Latin name &quot;bulbiferum&quot; of this species, meaning &quot;bearing bulbs&quot;, refers to the secondary bulbs on the stem of the nominal subspecies.

==Description==
&quot;Lilium bulbiferum&quot; reaches on average of height, with a maximum of . The bulbs are ovoid, with whitish large and pointed scales and can reach about of diameter. The stem is erect, the leaves are lanceolate, up to 10 centimeters long. The inflorescence has one to five short-haired flowers. They are hermaphroditic and scentless, have six upright tepals, the outer are slightly narrower than the inner ones. The flowers can reach 4–6 centimeters in length and are bright yellow-orange with reddish-brown dots. The stamens are erect, about half as long as the tepals, with red anthers. The style is orange, of height. The flowering period extends from May through July.

There are two varieties, &quot;L. b.&quot; var. &quot;croceum&quot; in the western part of the range, and &quot;L. b.&quot; var. &quot;bulbiferum&quot; in its eastern part. Only the last one always produces secondary aerial bulbs (&quot;bulbils&quot;) in the axils of the upper leaves. These &quot;bulbils&quot; fall to the ground and mature after two to three years. When manually separated from the stem they can easily be used for propagating the plant.

The dwarf plants from the Maritime Alps, formerly described as var. &quot;chaixii&quot; , and the large plants from the region of Naples, formerly described as var. &quot;giganteum&quot; , are now considered as local variants of var. &quot;croceum&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;L. bulbiferum&quot; is widely distributed in much of Europe from Spain to Finland and Ukraine. It grows in mountain meadows and on hillsides. They prefer calcareous soils in warm, sunny places, but also grow on slightly acid soils. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level.

==In culture==
The orange lily has long been recognised as a symbol of the Orange Order in Northern Ireland.

==Toxicity==

===Cats===
Cats are extremely sensitive to lily toxicity and ingestion is often fatal; households and gardens which are visited by cats are strongly advised against keeping this plant or placing dried flowers where a cat may brush against them and become dusted with pollen which they then consume while cleaning. Suspected cases require urgent veterinary attention. Rapid treatment with activated charcoal or induced vomiting can reduce the amount of toxin absorbed (this is time-sensitive so in some cases veterinarians may advise doing it at home), and large amounts of fluid by IV can reduce damage to kidneys to increase the chances of survival.

<doc id="1191260" wikidata="Q128535" url="?curid=1191260" title="Norway Debate">
<text>The Norway Debate, sometimes called the Narvik Debate, was a momentous debate in the British House of Commons from 7 to 9 May 1940, during the Second World War. The official title of the debate, as held in the &quot;Hansard&quot; parliamentary archive, is Conduct of the War. The debate was initiated by an adjournment motion enabling the Commons to freely discuss the progress of the Norwegian campaign. The debate quickly brought to a head widespread dissatisfaction with the conduct of the war by Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s government.

At the end of the second day, there was a division of the House for the members to hold a no confidence motion. The vote was won by the government but by a drastically reduced majority. That led on 10 May to Chamberlain resigning as prime minister and the replacement of his war ministry by a broadly based coalition government, which, under Winston Churchill, governed the United Kingdom until after the end of the war in Europe in May 1945.

Chamberlain&#x27;s government was criticised not only by the Opposition but also by respected members of his own Conservative Party. The Opposition forced the vote of no confidence, in which over a quarter of Conservative members voted with the Opposition or abstained, despite a three-line whip. There were calls for national unity to be established by formation of an all-party coalition but it was not possible for Chamberlain to reach agreement with the opposition Labour and Liberal parties. They refused to serve under him, although they were willing to accept another Conservative as prime minister. After Chamberlain resigned as prime minister (he remained Conservative Party leader until October 1940), they agreed to serve under Churchill.

== Background ==
In 1937, Neville Chamberlain, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, succeeded Stanley Baldwin as prime minister, leading a National Government overwhelmingly composed of Conservatives but supported by small National Labour and Liberal National parties. It was opposed by the Labour and Liberal parties. Since assuming power in Germany in 1933, the Nazi Party had pushed an irredentist foreign policy. Chamberlain initially attempted to avert war by a policy of appeasement, culminating in the Munich Agreement. This policy was abandoned after Germany ceased the use of diplomatic means to avert war, and became more overtly expansionist with the occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939.

One of the strongest critics of both appeasement and German aggression was Conservative backbencher Winston Churchill who, although he was one of the country&#x27;s most prominent political figures, had last held government office in 1929. After Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany two days later. Chamberlain thereupon created a war cabinet into which he appointed Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty. It was at this point that a government supporter (possibly David Margesson, the Government Chief Whip) noted privately:

Once Germany had rapidly overrun Poland in September 1939, there was a sustained period of military inactivity for over six months dubbed the &quot;Phoney War&quot;. On 3 April 1940, Chamberlain said in an address to the Conservative National Union that Adolf Hitler, the German dictator, &quot;had missed the bus&quot;. Only six days later, on 9 April, Germany launched an attack in overwhelming force on neutral and unprepared Norway after swiftly occupying Denmark. In response, Britain deployed military forces to assist the Norwegians.

Churchill, as First Lord of the Admiralty, had direct responsibility for the conduct of naval operations in the Norwegian campaign. Before the German invasion, he had pressed the Cabinet to ignore Norway&#x27;s neutrality, mine its territorial waters and be prepared to seize Narvik, in both cases to disrupt the export of Swedish iron ore to Germany during winter months, when the Baltic Sea was frozen. He had, however, advised that a major landing in Norway was not realistically within Germany&#x27;s powers. Apart from the naval victory in the Battles of Narvik, the Norwegian campaign went badly for the British forces, generally because of poor planning and organisation but essentially because military supplies were inadequate and, from 27 April, the Anglo-French forces were obliged to evacuate.

When the House of Commons met on Thursday, 2 May, Labour leader Clement Attlee asked: &quot;Is the Prime Minister now able to make a statement on the position in Norway?&quot; Chamberlain was reluctant to discuss the military situation because of the security factors involved but did express a hope that he and Churchill would be able to say much more next week. He went on to make an interim statement of affairs but was not forthcoming about &quot;certain operations (that) are in progress (as) we must do nothing which might jeopardise the lives of those engaged in them&quot;. He asked the House to defer comment and question until next week. Attlee agreed and so did Liberal leader Archibald Sinclair, except that he requested a debate on Norway lasting more than a single day.

Attlee then presented Chamberlain with a private notice in which he requested a schedule for next week&#x27;s Commons business. Chamberlain announced that a debate on the general conduct of the war would commence on Tuesday, 7 May. The debate was keenly anticipated in both Parliament and the country. In his diary entry for Monday, 6 May, Chamberlain&#x27;s Assistant Private Secretary John Colville wrote that all interest centred on the debate. Obviously, he thought, the government would win through but after facing some very awkward points about Norway. Some of Colville&#x27;s colleagues including Lord Dunglass, who was Chamberlain&#x27;s Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) at the time, considered the government position to be sound politically, but less so in other respects. Colville worried that &quot;the confidence of the country may be somewhat shaken&quot;.

== 7 May: first day of the debate ==

=== Preamble and other business ===
The Commons sitting on Tuesday, 7 May 1940, began at 14:45 with Speaker Edward FitzRoy in the Chair. There followed some private business matters and numerous oral answers to questions raised, many of those being about the British Army.

With these matters completed, the debate on the Norwegian campaign began with a routine adjournment motion (i.e., &quot;that this house do now adjourn&quot;). Under Westminster rules in debates like this, wide-ranging discussions of a variety of topics are allowed, and the motion is not usually put to a vote.

At 15:48, Captain David Margesson, the Government Chief Whip, made the adjournment motion. The House proceeded to openly discuss &quot;Conduct of the War&quot;, specifically the progress of the Norwegian campaign, and Chamberlain rose to make his opening statement.

=== Chamberlain&#x27;s opening speech ===

Chamberlain began by reminding the House of his statement on Thursday, 2 May, five days earlier, when it was known that British forces had been withdrawn from Åndalsnes. He was now able to confirm that they had also been withdrawn from Namsos to complete the evacuation of Allied forces from central and southern Norway (the campaign in northern Norway continued). Chamberlain attempted to treat the Allied losses as unimportant and claimed that British soldiers &quot;man for man (were) superior to their foes&quot;. He praised the &quot;splendid gallantry and dash&quot; of the British forces but acknowledged they were &quot;exposed ... to superior forces with superior equipment&quot;.

Chamberlain then said he proposed &quot;to present a picture of the situation&quot; and to &quot;consider certain criticisms of the government&quot;. He stated that &quot;no doubt&quot; the withdrawal had created a shock in both the House and the country. At this point, the interruptions began as a Labour member, Ben Smith shouted: &quot;And abroad&quot;, and an unnamed member added: &quot;All over the world&quot;.

Chamberlain sarcastically responded that &quot;ministers, of course, must be expected to be blamed for everything&quot;. This provoked a heated reaction with several members derisively shouting: &quot;They missed the bus!&quot; The Speaker had to call on members not to interrupt, but they continued to repeat the phrase throughout Chamberlain&#x27;s speech and he reacted with what has been described as &quot;a rather feminine gesture of irritation&quot;. He was eventually forced to defend the original usage of the phrase directly, claiming that he would have expected a German attack on the Allies at the outbreak of war when the difference in armed power was at its greatest.

Chamberlain&#x27;s speech has been widely criticised. Roy Jenkins called it &quot;a tired, defensive speech which impressed nobody&quot;. Liberal MP Henry Morris-Jones said Chamberlain looked &quot;a shattered man&quot; and spoke without his customary self-assurance. When Chamberlain insisted that &quot;the balance of advantage lay on our side&quot;, Liberal MP Dingle Foot could not believe what he was hearing and said Chamberlain was denying the fact that Britain had suffered a major defeat. The backbench Conservative MP Leo Amery said Chamberlain&#x27;s speech left the House in a restive and depressed, though not yet mutinous, state of mind. Amery believed that Chamberlain was &quot;obviously satisfied with things as they stood&quot; and, in the government camp, the mood was actually positive as they believed they were, in John Colville&#x27;s words, &quot;going to get away with it&quot;.

=== Attlee&#x27;s response to Chamberlain ===
Clement Attlee responded as Leader of the Opposition. He quoted some of Chamberlain&#x27;s and Churchill&#x27;s recent confident assertions about the likely victory of the British. Ministers&#x27; statements and, even more so, the press, guided (or deliberately left uncorrected) by the government, had painted far too optimistic a picture of the Norwegian campaign. Given the level of confidence created, the setback had generated widespread disappointment. Attlee now raised the issue of government planning which would be revisited by several later speakers:


Chamberlain had announced additional powers being granted to Churchill which amounted to him having direction of the Chiefs of Staff. Attlee seized on this as an example of government incompetence, though without blaming Churchill, by saying:

Attlee struck a theme here that would recur throughout the debate – that the government was incompetent but not Churchill himself, even though he was part of it, as he had suffered from what Jenkins calls a misdirection of his talents. Jenkins remarks that Churchill&#x27;s potential had not been fully utilised and, most importantly, he was clean of the stain of appeasement.

Chamberlain had been heckled during his speech for having &quot;missed the bus&quot; and he made his case worse by desperately trying, and failing, to excuse his use of that expression a month earlier. In doing so, he provided Attlee with an opportunity. During the conclusion of his response, Attlee said:

Attlee&#x27;s closing words were a direct attack on all Conservative members, blaming them for shoring up ministers whom they knew to be failures:

Leo Amery said later that Attlee&#x27;s restraint, in not calling for a division of the House (i.e., a vote), was of greater consequence than all his criticisms because, Amery believed, it made it much easier for Conservative members to be influenced by the debate&#x27;s opening day.

=== Sinclair&#x27;s response to Chamberlain ===

Sir Archibald Sinclair, the leader of the Liberals, then spoke. He too was critical and began by comparing military and naval staff efficiency, which he considered proven, with political inefficiency:

He drew from Chamberlain the admission that whilst troops had been held in readiness to be sent to Norway, no troopships had been retained to send them in. Sinclair gave instances of inadequate and defective equipment and of disorganisation reported to him by servicemen returning from Norway. Chamberlain had suggested that Allied plans had failed because the Norwegians had not put up the expected resistance to the Germans. Sinclair reported that the servicemen &quot;paid a high tribute to the courage and determination with which the Norwegians fought alongside them. They paid a particular tribute to the Norwegian ski patrols. Norwegians at Lillehammer for seven days held up with rifles only a German force with tanks, armoured cars, bombing aeroplanes and all the paraphernalia of modern war&quot;.

He concluded his speech by calling for Parliament to &quot;speak out (and say) we must have done with half-measures (to promote) a policy for the more vigorous conduct of the war&quot;.

=== No longer an ordinary debate ===
The rest of the first day&#x27;s debate saw speeches both supporting and criticising the Chamberlain government. Sinclair was followed by two ex-soldiers, Brigadier Henry Page Croft for the Conservatives and Colonel Josiah Wedgwood for Labour. Derided by Labour, Croft made an unconvincing case in support of Chamberlain and described the press as &quot;the biggest dictator of all&quot;.

Wedgwood denounced Croft for his &quot;facile optimism, that saps the morale of the whole country&quot;. Wedgwood warned of the dangers inherent in trying to negotiate with Hitler and urged prosecution of the war by &quot;a government which can take this war seriously&quot;.

Attending the debate was National Labour MP Harold Nicolson who was arguably the pre-eminent diarist of British politics in the twentieth century. He took special notice of a comment made by Wedgwood which, in Nicolson&#x27;s view, transformed &quot;an ordinary debate (into) a tremendous conflict of wills&quot;. Wedgwood had asked if the government was preparing any plan to prevent an invasion of Great Britain. A Conservative MP, Vice Admiral Ernest Taylor, interrupted and asked him if he had forgotten the Royal Navy. Wedgwood countered that with:

Moments later, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes, the Conservative Member for Portsmouth North, arrived in the chamber and caused a stir because he was resplendent in his uniform with gold braid and six rows of medal ribbons. He squeezed into a bench just behind Nicolson who passed him a piece of paper with Wedgwood&#x27;s remark scribbled on it. Keyes went to the Speaker and asked to be called next as the honour of the navy was at stake, though he had really come to the House with the intention of criticising the Chamberlain government.

=== Keyes: &quot;I speak for the fighting Navy&quot; ===
When Wedgwood sat down, the Speaker called Keyes, who began by denouncing Wedgwood&#x27;s comment as &quot;a damned insult&quot;. The House, especially David Lloyd George, &quot;roared its applause&quot;. Keyes quickly moved on and became the debate&#x27;s first Tory rebel. As Jenkins puts it, Keyes &quot;turned his guns on Chamberlain&quot; but with the proviso that he was longing to see &quot;proper use made of Churchill&#x27;s great abilities&quot;.

Keyes was a hero of the First World War representing a naval town and an Admiral of the Fleet (though no longer on the active list). He spoke mostly on the conduct of naval operations, particularly the abortive operations to retake Trondheim. Keyes told the House:

As the House listened in silence, Keyes finished by quoting Horatio Nelson:

It was 19:30 when Keyes sat down to &quot;thunderous applause&quot;. Nicolson wrote that Keyes&#x27; speech was the most dramatic he had ever heard, and the debate from that point on was no longer an investigation of the Norwegian campaign but &quot;a criticism of the government&#x27;s whole war effort&quot;.

=== Jones and Bellenger ===
The next two speakers were National Liberal Lewis Jones and Labour&#x27;s Frederick Bellenger, who was still a serving army officer and was evacuated from France only a month later. Jones, who supported Chamberlain, was unimpressive and was afterwards accused of introducing party politics into the debate. There was a general exodus from the chamber as Jones was speaking. Bellenger, who repeated much of Attlee&#x27;s earlier message, called &quot;in the public interest&quot; for a government &quot;of a different character and a different nature&quot;.

=== Amery: &quot;In the name of God, go!&quot; ===

When Bellenger sat down, it was 20:03 and the Deputy Speaker, Dennis Herbert, called on Leo Amery, who had been trying for several hours to gain the Speaker&#x27;s attention. Amery later remarked that there were &quot;barely a dozen&quot; members present (Nicolson was among them) as he began to speak. Nicolson, who expected a powerfully critical speech from Amery, wrote that the temperature continued to rise as Amery began and his speech soon &quot;raised it far beyond the fever point&quot;.

Amery had an ally in Clement Davies, chairman of the All Party Action Group which included some sixty MPs. Davies had been a National Liberal subject to the National Government whip but, in protest against Chamberlain, he had resigned it in December 1939 and crossed the floor of the House to rejoin the Liberals in opposition. Like many other members, Davies had gone to eat when Jones began speaking but, on hearing that Amery had been called, he rushed back to the chamber. Seeing that it was nearly empty, Davies approached Amery and urged him to deliver his full speech both to state his full case against the government and also to give Davies time to collect a large audience. Very soon, even though it was the dinner hour, the House began filling rapidly.

Amery&#x27;s speech is one of the most famous in parliamentary history. As Davies had requested, he played for time until the chamber was nearly full. For much of the speech, the most notable absentee was Chamberlain himself, who was at Buckingham Palace for an audience with the King. Amery began by criticising the government&#x27;s planning and execution of the Norway campaign, especially their unpreparedness for it despite intelligence warning of likely German intervention and the clear possibility of some such response to the planned British infraction of Norwegian neutrality by the mining of Norwegian territorial waters. He gave an analogy from his own experience which illustrated the government&#x27;s lack of initiative:

As tension increased in the House and Amery found himself speaking to a &quot;crescendo of applause&quot;, Edward Spears thought he was hurling huge stones at the government glasshouse with &quot;the effect of a series of deafening explosions&quot;. Amery widened his scope to criticise the government&#x27;s whole conduct of the war to date. He moved towards his conclusion by calling for the formation of a &quot;real&quot; National Government in which the Trades Union Congress must be involved to &quot;reinforce the strength of the national effort from inside&quot;.

Although sources are somewhat divided on the point, there is a consensus among them that Chamberlain had arrived back in the chamber to hear Amery&#x27;s conclusion. Nicolson recorded Chamberlain as sitting on a &quot;glum and anxious front bench&quot;. Amery said:

Amery delivered the last six words in a near whisper, pointing at Chamberlain as he did so. He sat down and the government&#x27;s opponents cheered him.

Afterwards, Lloyd George told Amery that his ending was the most dramatic climax he had heard to any speech. Amery himself said he thought he had helped push the Labour Party into forcing a division next day. Harold Macmillan said later that Amery&#x27;s speech &quot;effectively destroyed the Chamberlain government&quot;.

===Later speeches===
It was 20:44 when Amery sat down and the debate continued until 23:30. The next speech was by Sir Archibald Southby, who tried to defend Chamberlain.
He declared that Amery&#x27;s speech would &quot;certainly give great satisfaction in Berlin&quot; and he was shouted down. Bob Boothby interrupted and said that &quot;it will give greater satisfaction in this country&quot;.

Southby was followed by Labour&#x27;s James Milner who expressed the profound dissatisfaction with recent events of the majority of his constituents in Leeds. He called for &quot;drastic change&quot; to be made if Great Britain was to win the war. Edward Turnour, 6th Earl Winterton spoke next, commencing at 21:28. Although a Conservative, he began by saying that there was a great deal in Milner&#x27;s speech with which he was in agreement, but almost nothing in Southby&#x27;s with which he could agree.

The next speaker was Arthur Greenwood, the Labour deputy leader. He gave what Jenkins calls &quot;a robust Labour wind-up&quot;. In his conclusion, Greenwood called for &quot;an active, vigorous, imaginative direction of the war&quot; which had so far been lacking as the government was passive and on the defensive because &quot;(as) the world must know, we have never taken the initiative in this war&quot;. Summing up for the government was Oliver Stanley, the Secretary of State for War, whose reply to Greenwood has been described as ineffective.

== 8 May: second day and division ==
=== Morrison: &quot;We must divide the House&quot; ===
It is generally understood that Labour did not intend a division before the debate began but Attlee, after hearing the speeches by Keyes and Amery, realised that discontent within Tory ranks was far deeper than they had thought. A meeting of the party&#x27;s Parliamentary Executive was held on Wednesday morning and Attlee proposed forcing a division at the end of the debate that day. There were a handful of dissenters, including Hugh Dalton, but they were outvoted at a second meeting later on.

As a result, when Herbert Morrison reopened the debate just after 16:00, he announced that:

Jenkins says the Labour decision to divide turned the routine adjournment motion into &quot;the equivalent of a vote of censure&quot;. Earlier in his opening address, Morrison had focused his criticism on Chamberlain, John Simon and Samuel Hoare who were the three ministers most readily associated with appeasement.

=== Chamberlain: &quot;I have friends in the House&quot; ===
Hoare, the Secretary of State for Air, was scheduled to speak next but Chamberlain insisted on replying to Morrison and made an ill-judged and disastrous intervention. Chamberlain appealed not for national unity but for the support of his friends in the House:

That shocked many present who regarded it as divisive to be so explicit in relying on whipped support from his own party. Bob Boothby, a Conservative MP who was a strong critic of Chamberlain, called out: &quot;Not I&quot;; and received a withering glare from Chamberlain. The stress on &quot;friends&quot; was considered partisan and divisive, reducing politics at a time of crisis from national level to personal level.

Hoare followed Chamberlain and struggled to cope with many of the questions being fired at him about the air force, at one point failing to realise the difference between the Royal Air Force and the Fleet Air Arm. He sat down at 17:37 and was succeeded by David Lloyd George.

=== Lloyd George: &quot;the worst strategic position in which this country has ever been placed&quot; ===

Lloyd George had been prime minister during the last two years of the First World War. He was now 77, and it was to be his last major contribution to debate in the House in which he had sat for 50 years. There was personal animosity between Lloyd George and Chamberlain. The latter&#x27;s appeal to friends gave Lloyd George the opportunity for retribution. First, he attacked the conduct of the campaign and began by dismissing Hoare&#x27;s entire speech in a single sentence:

Lloyd George then began his main attack on the government by focusing on the lack of planning and preparation:

Emphasising the gravity of the situation, he argued that Britain was in the worst position strategically that it had ever been as a result of foreign policy failures, which he began to review from the 1938 Munich agreement onwards. Interrupted at this point, he retorted:

Lloyd George went on to say that British prestige had been greatly impaired, especially in America. Before the events in Norway, he claimed, the Americans had been in no doubt that the Allies would win the war, but now they were saying it would be up to them to defend democracy. After dealing with some interruptions, Lloyd George criticised the rate of re-armament pre-war and to date:

=== Churchill and Chamberlain intervene in Lloyd George&#x27;s speech ===
Dealing with an intervention at this point, Lloyd George said, in passing, that he did not think that the First Lord was entirely responsible for all the things that happened in Norway. Churchill intervened and said:

In answer, Lloyd George said:

Jenkins calls this &quot;a brilliant metaphor&quot; but wonders if it was spontaneous. It produced laughter throughout the House, except on the government front bench where, with one exception, all the faces were stony. A spectator in the gallery, Baba Metcalfe, recorded that the exception was Churchill himself. She recalled him swinging his legs and trying hard not to laugh. When things calmed down, Lloyd George resumed and now turned his fire onto Chamberlain personally:

Chamberlain stood and, leaning over the despatch box, demanded:

=== Lloyd George: Chamberlain &quot;should sacrifice the seals of office&quot; ===
Lloyd George responded to that intervention with a direct call for Chamberlain to resign:

There was silence as Lloyd George sat down and one observer said that all the frustrations of the past eight months had been released. Chamberlain was deeply perturbed and, two days later, told a friend that he had never heard anything like it in Parliament. Churchill was overheard saying to Kingsley Wood that it was going to be &quot;damned difficult&quot; for him (Churchill) doing his summary later on. Jenkins says the speech recalled Lloyd George in his prime. It was his best of many years, and his last of any real impact.

===Other speakers===
It was 18:10 when Lloyd George concluded and some four hours later that Churchill began his summary to wind up the government&#x27;s case ahead of the division. In the interim, several speakers were called to argue both for and against the government. They included long-serving Liberal National George Lambert, Sir Stafford Cripps, Alfred Duff Cooper, George Hicks, George Courthope, Robert Bower, Alfred Edwards, and Henry Brooke. The last of these, Brooke, finished at 21:14 and gave way to A. V. Alexander who wound up for Labour and put forward certain questions that Churchill as First Lord might answer. His final point, however, was to criticise Chamberlain for his appeal to friendship:

Jenkins describes Alexander as someone who tried, despite being completely different in character and personality, to make of himself a &quot;mini-Churchill&quot;. On this occasion, he did present Churchill with some awkward questions about Norway but, as with other speakers before him, it was done with genuine respect amidst severe criticism of Chamberlain, Hoare, Simon and Stanley in particular. There was some embarrassment for Churchill in that he was late in returning to the House for Alexander&#x27;s speech and Chamberlain had to excuse his absence. He arrived just in time for Alexander&#x27;s questions about Norway.

=== Churchill winds up for the Government ===

Churchill was called to speak at 22:11, the first time in eleven years that he had wound up a debate on behalf of the government. Many members believed that it was the most difficult speech of his career because he had to defend a reverse without damaging his own prestige. It was widely felt that he achieved it because, as Nicolson described it, he said not one word against Chamberlain&#x27;s government and yet, by means of his manner and his skill as an orator, he created the impression of being nothing to do with them.

The first part of Churchill&#x27;s speech was, as he said it would be, about the Norwegian campaign. The second part, concerning the vote of censure which he called a new issue that had been sprung upon the House at five o&#x27;clock, he said he would deal with in due course.

Churchill proceeded to defend the conduct of the Norwegian campaign with some robustness, although there were several omissions such as his insistence that Narvik be blocked off with a minefield. He explained that even the successful use of the battleship at Narvik had put her at risk from many hazards. Had any come to pass, the operation, now hailed as an example of what should have been done elsewhere, would have been condemned as foolhardy:

As for the lack of action at Trondheim, Churchill said it was not because of any perceived danger, but because it was thought unnecessary. He reminded the House that the campaign continued in northern Norway, at Narvik in particular but he would not be drawn into giving any predictions about it. Instead, he attacked the government&#x27;s critics by deploring what he called a cataract of unworthy suggestions and actual falsehoods during the last few days:

Churchill then had to deal with interruptions and an intervention by Arthur Greenwood who wanted to know if the war cabinet had delayed action at Trondheim. Churchill denied that and advised Greenwood to dismiss such delusions. Soon afterwards, he reacted to a comment by Labour MP Manny Shinwell:

This produced a general uproar led by the veteran Scottish Labour member Neil Maclean, said to be the worse for drink, who demanded withdrawal of the word &quot;skulks&quot;. The Speaker would not rule on the matter and Churchill defiantly refused to withdraw the comment, adding that:

Having defended the conduct of the naval operations in the Norwegian campaign at some length, Churchill now said little about the proposed vote, other than to complain about such short notice:

He concluded by saying:

Churchill sat down but the rowdiness continued with catcalls from both sides of the House and Chips Channon later wrote that it was &quot;like &quot;. Labour&#x27;s Hugh Dalton wrote that a good deal of riot developed, some of it rather stupid, towards the end of the speech.

===Division===
At 23:00, the Speaker rose to put the question &quot;that this House do now adjourn&quot;. There was minimal dissent and he announced the division, calling for the Lobby to be cleared. The division was in effect a no confidence motion or, as Churchill called it in his closing speech, a vote of censure. Of the total 615 members, it has been estimated that more than 550 were present when the division was called but only 481 voted.

The government&#x27;s notional majority was 213, but 41 members who normally supported the government voted with the Opposition while an estimated 60 other Conservatives deliberately abstained. The government still won the vote by 281 to 200, but their majority was reduced to 81. Jenkins says that would have been perfectly sustainable in most circumstances, but not when Britain was losing the war and it was clear that unity and leadership were so obviously lacking. In these circumstances, the reversal was devastating and Chamberlain left the chamber pale and grim.

Among the Conservatives, Chips Channon and other Chamberlain supporters shouted &quot;Quislings&quot; and &quot;Rats&quot; at the rebels, who replied with taunts of &quot;Yes-men&quot;. Labour&#x27;s Josiah Wedgwood led the singing of &quot;Rule Britannia&quot;, joined by Conservative rebel Harold Macmillan of the Noes; that gave way to cries of &quot;Go!&quot; as Chamberlain left the Chamber. Amery, Keyes, Macmillan and Boothby were among the rebels voting with Labour. Others were Nancy Astor, John Profumo, Quintin Hogg, Leslie Hore-Belisha and Edward Spears but not some expected dissidents such as Duncan Sandys, who abstained, and Brendan Bracken who, in Jenkins&#x27; words, &quot;followed [Churchill&#x27;s] example rather than his interest and voted with the government&quot;. Colville in his diary said the government were &quot;fairly satisfied&quot; but acknowledged that reconstruction of the Cabinet was necessary. He wrote that &quot;the shock they have received may be a healthy one&quot;.

== 9 May: third day and conclusion ==
The debate continued into a third day but, with the division having been held at the end of the second day, the final day was really a matter of wrapping up. Starting at 15:18, there were only four speakers and the last of them was Lloyd George who spoke mostly about his own time as prime minister in the First World War and at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. He concluded by blaming the democracies for not carrying out the pledges made at that time with the result that Nazism had arisen in Germany. When he finished, shortly before 16:00, the question &quot;that this House do now adjourn&quot; was raised and agreed to, thus concluding the Norway Debate.

==Aftermath==

On 9 and 10 May, Chamberlain attempted to form a coalition government with Labour and Liberal participation. They indicated an unwillingness to serve under him but said they probably would join the government if another Conservative became prime minister. When Germany began its western offensive on the morning of 10 May, Chamberlain seriously considered staying on but, after receiving final confirmation from Labour that they required his resignation, he decided to stand down and advised the King to send for Churchill as his successor.

Gaining the support of both Labour and the Liberals, Churchill formed a coalition government. His war cabinet at first consisted of himself, Attlee, Greenwood, Chamberlain and Halifax. The coalition lasted until the defeat of Nazi Germany in May 1945. On 23 May 1945, Labour left the coalition to begin their general election campaign and Churchill resigned as prime minister. The King asked him to form a new government, known as the Churchill caretaker ministry, until the election was held in July. Churchill agreed and his new ministry, essentially a Conservative one, held office for the next two months until it was replaced by the first Attlee ministry after Labour&#x27;s election victory.

== Place in parliamentary culture ==
The Norway debate is regarded as a high point in British parliamentary history, coming as it did at a time when Great Britain faced its gravest danger. The former prime minister, David Lloyd George, said the debate was the most momentous in the history of Parliament. The future prime minister, Harold Macmillan, believed that the debate changed British history, perhaps world history.

In his biography of Churchill, Roy Jenkins describes the debate as &quot;by a clear head both the most dramatic and the most far-reaching in its consequences of any parliamentary debate of the twentieth century&quot;. He compares it with &quot;its nineteenth-century rivals&quot; (e.g., the Don Pacifico debate of 1850) and concludes that &quot;even more followed from the 1940 debate&quot; as it transformed the history of the next five years.

Andrew Marr wrote that the debate was &quot;one of the greatest parliamentary moments ever and little about it was inevitable&quot;. The plotters against Chamberlain succeeded despite being deprived of their natural leader, since Churchill was in the cabinet and obliged to defend it. Marr notes the irony of Amery&#x27;s closing words which were originally directed &quot;against&quot; Parliament by Cromwell, who was speaking &quot;for&quot; military dictatorship.

When asked to choose the most historic and memorable speech for a volume commemorating the centenary of &quot;Hansard&quot; as an official report of the House of Commons, former Speaker Betty Boothroyd chose Amery&#x27;s speech in the debate, &quot;Amery, by elevating patriotism above party, showed the backbencher&#x27;s power to help change the course of history&quot;.

<text>Samuel Pordage (1633 – c. 1691) was a 17th-century English poet. He is best known by his &quot;Azaria and Hushai&quot; (1682), a reply to John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot;.

==Life==
Samuel was the eldest son of John Pordage, a clergyman from Bradfield in Berkshire, who married the widow, Mary Pordage (born Lane) on 17 January 1633. Samuel baptised at St Dionis Backchurch, London, on 29 December 1633. He was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School from 1644, and studied law at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. At the trial of his father ten years later he appears to have been one of the witnesses. In his title-pages he described himself as ‘of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn’ and ‘a student of physick.’ He was at one time chief steward to Philip Herbert, 5th Earl of Pembroke.

Roger L&#x27;Estrange attacked Pordage in the ‘Observator’ for 5 April 1682 on account of ‘A brief History of all the Papists&#x27; bloudy Persecutions,’ calling him ‘limping Pordage, a son of the famous Familist about Reading and the author of several libels,’ one against L&#x27;Estrange. Dryden, in the second part of ‘Absalom and Achitophel,’ published in November, described Pordage as

Lame Mephibosheth, the wizard&#x27;s son.

==Works==
He made various translations, wrote poems, and laid claim to two tragedies, &quot;Herod and Mariamne&quot; (1673), and &quot;The Siege of Babylon&quot; (1678), and a romance, &quot;Eliana&quot;.

While living with his father at the parsonage of Bradfield in 1660 he published a translation from Seneca the Younger, with notes, called ‘Troades Englished.’ About the same time he published ‘Poems upon Several Occasions, by S. P., gent.,’ a little volume which included panegyrics on Charles II and General George Monck, but which consisted for the most part of poems in the style of Robert Herrick.

In 1661 a volume appeared called ‘Mundorum Explicatio, or the explanation of an Hieroglyphical Figure. … Being a Sacred Poem, written by S. P., Armig.’ This book, which was reissued in 1663, is attributed to Samuel Pordage, though it has been suggested that the real author was Pordage&#x27;s father, a professed follower of Jacob Boehme. White Kennett, writing in 1728, attributed the work to Samuel.

In 1661 Samuel Pordage published a pamphlet, ‘Heroick Stanzas on his Maiesties Coronation.’ In 1673 his &quot;Herod and Mariamne&quot; a tragedy, was acted at the Duke&#x27;s Theatre, and was published anonymously. Elkanah Settle signed the dedication to the Duchess of Albemarle. The plot was borrowed from Josephus and the romance of ‘Cleopatra.’ In 1678 appeared ‘&quot;The Siege of Babylon&quot;, by Samuel Pordage of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, Esq., author of the tragedy of “Herod and Mariamne.”’ This play had been licensed by Roger L&#x27;Estrange on 2 November 1677, and acted at the Duke&#x27;s Theatre not long after the production at the Theatre Royal of Nathaniel Lee&#x27;s ‘Rival Queens;’ and Statira and Roxana, the ‘rival queens,’ were principal characters in Pordage&#x27;s rhymed tragedy. The story is based upon ‘Cassandra’ and other romances of the day.

Pordage brought out in 1679 the sixth edition of John Reynolds&#x27;s ‘Triumphs of God&#x27;s Revenge against the sin of Murther;’ he prefixed to it a dedication to the Earl of Shaftesbury. In 1681, at the time when the Popish Plot scare was ebbing out, he wrote a single folio sheet, ‘A new Apparition of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey&#x27;s Ghost to the E. of D—— in the Tower;’ the printer was obliged to make a public apology for the reflections on the Earl of Danby which it contained. Between 1681 and 1684 he issued ‘The Remaining Medical Works of … Dr. Thomas Willis … Englished by S. P., Esq.’ There is a general dedication to Sir Theophilus Biddulph, signed by Pordage; and verses ‘On the author&#x27;s Medico-philosophical Discourses’ precede the first part.

Dryden&#x27;s ‘Absalom and Achitophel’ appeared in November 1681, and among the answers to it was Pordage&#x27;s ‘Azaria and Hushai, a Poem,’ 1682. In this piece Azaria was the Duke of Monmouth, Amazia the king, Hushai Shaftesbury, and Shimei Dryden. Some lines were devoted to L&#x27;Estrange, who was called Bibbai. On 15 March 1682 Dryden brought out ‘The Medal, a Satire against Sedition,’ an attack on Shaftesbury, and on 31 March Pordage published ‘The Medal revers&#x27;d, a Satyre against Persecution,’ with an epistle, addressed, in imitation of Dryden, to his enemies, the Tories. Pordage said he did not believe that the authors of ‘Absalom and Achitophel’ and ‘The Medal’ were the same, yet, as they desired to be thought so, each must bear the reproaches of the other.

In May John Oldham, in his ‘Imitation of the Third Satire of Juvenal,’ had ridiculed Pordage, and in another ‘Satire’ mentioned Pordage among the authors who had ‘grown contemptible, and slighted since.’ Besides the pieces already mentioned, Pordage is stated to have written a romance called ‘Eliana.’

<doc id="1191276" wikidata="Q1155476" url="?curid=1191276" title="Necklacing">
<text>Necklacing is a method of extrajudicial summary execution and torture carried out by forcing a rubber tire drenched with petrol around a victim&#x27;s chest and arms, and setting it on fire. The term &quot;necklace&quot; originated in the 1980s in black townships of apartheid South Africa where suspected apartheid collaborators were publicly executed in this fashion.

==South Africa==
Necklacing was used by the black community to punish its members who were perceived as collaborators with the apartheid government. Necklacing was primarily used on black police informants; the practice was often carried out in the name of the struggle, although the executive body of the African National Congress (ANC), the most broadly supported South African opposition movement, condemned it. In 1986, Winnie Mandela, then-wife of the imprisoned Nelson Mandela, and who herself had endured torture and four imprisonments to a total of two years, stated, &quot;With our boxes of matches, and our necklaces, we shall liberate this country&quot;, which was widely seen as an explicit endorsement of necklacing. This caused the ANC to initially distance itself from her, although she later took on a number of official positions within the party.

The first victim of necklacing, according to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, was a young black woman, Maki Skosana of Duduza, on 20 July 1985:
Photojournalist Kevin Carter was the first to photograph a public execution by necklacing in South Africa in the mid-1980s. He later spoke of the images: 

Author Lynda Schuster writes: 

Some commentators have noted that the practice of necklacing served to escalate the levels of violence during the township wars of the 1980s and early 1990s as security force members became brutalized and afraid that they might fall victim to the practice.

==Other countries==

=== Haiti ===
This form of lynching was used in Haiti, where it was known as &quot;Pé Lebrun,&quot; or &quot;Père Lebrun&quot; (French), after a tire advertisement showing a man with a tire around his neck. It was used prominently by mobs allied with Jean-Bertrand Aristide to assassinate political enemies. Aristide himself allegedly showed strong support for this practice, calling it a &quot;beautiful tool&quot; that &quot;smells good&quot;, encouraging his Lavalas supporters to use it against wealthy people as well as members of the Lavalas party who were not as strong in their fervor.

=== Sri Lanka and India ===
During the 1983 Black July riot against Sri Lankan Tamils, Sinhalese rioters used necklacing. Necklacing was also widely used against Sinhalese youth by government supported paramilitary forces in the second armed insurrection led by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. A graphic description of one such necklacing appears in the book &quot;The Island of Blood&quot; by journalist Anita Pratap. 

This technique was widely used against Sikhs during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, which took place throughout northern India after the erstwhile Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi, having presided over Operation Blue Star earlier that year, was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards.

=== Ivory Coast and Nigeria ===
In the early 1990s, university students in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, were plagued by burglars stealing from their dormitories. The students took matters into their own hands by capturing the alleged thieves, and then executed them by placing tyres around their necks and setting the tyres on fire. Ivorian police, powerless to stop these necklacings, could do nothing but stand by and watch.

In 2006, at least one person died in Nigeria by necklacing in the deadly Muslim protests over satirical cartoon drawings of Muhammad.

=== Brazil ===
A form of necklacing where victims are forced inside a stack of tyres doused with petrol and set on fire is widely used by drug dealers in Brazil, notably in Rio de Janeiro, where it is called &quot;micro-ondas,&quot; or &quot;microwave&quot; in Portuguese. Journalist Tim Lopes was a notable victim.

<text>The Division of Fadden is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland, covering most of the northern Gold Coast, including Coomera, Labrador, Ormeau, Pimpama and Runaway Bay. The current MP is Cameron Caldwell of the Liberal Party.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

The division was created in 1977 and is named after Sir Arthur Fadden, Prime Minister of Australia in 1941. When it was created it included a large area south of Brisbane, from the far south of the city to the Gold Coast hinterland, and was a marginal seat that changed hands between the Liberal Party and Australian Labor Party. A 1984 redistribution pushed it further into Brisbane, and it remained a marginal Liberal seat for most of the 1980s. A 1996 redistribution pushed it into the Gold Coast, and since then it has been a comfortably safe Liberal seat.

By 2004, it had moved almost clear of its original boundaries to become an exclusively Gold Coast seat.

<text>The Division of Fairfax is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. The current MP is Ted O&#x27;Brien of the Liberal Party.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History== 

The division was created in 1984 and is named after Ruth Fairfax, founder of the Country Women&#x27;s Association. It is located in the Sunshine Coast region north of Brisbane and includes the towns of Coolum, Yaroomba, Marcoola, Mudjimba, Maroochydore, Buderim, Woombye, Bli Bli, Yandina, Nambour, Mapleton, Kenilworth and Eumundi.

While the Sunshine Coast is traditionally a conservative area, Fairfax is located in a particularly conservative portion of the Sunshine Coast, and so has always been held by a centre-right party. Originally a safe seat for the National Party, demographic change has made it equally safe for the Liberal Party. 

The electorate came to national attention at the 2013 federal election, when Clive Palmer, the founder of the Palmer United Party, narrowly won it by 53 votes. Before then, the Coalition&#x27;s hold on the seat had only been seriously threatened twice, in 1998 and 2007. At all other times, it was a safe, or fairly safe, Coalition seat. 

Palmer did not run for re-election, and it was widely expected that the seat would revert to the merged Liberal National Party because, in 2013, LNP would have retained it easily in a &quot;traditional&quot; two-party-preferred vote contest with Labor. As expected, Palmer&#x27;s 2013 opponent, Ted O&#x27;Brien, won the seat resoundingly at the 2016 federal election and has held it without serious difficulty since.

<text>Wes Hart (born September 14, 1977, in Hollister, California) is an American soccer coach, and the current head coach of the Alabama Crimson Tide women&#x27;s soccer team. Hart played six season in Major League Soccer as a defender with the Colorado Rapids and San Jose Earthquakes.

Hart grew up in Littleton, Colorado, attending Columbine High School where he was a Parade Magazine and NSCAA High School All American soccer player. He was also a highly successful high school wrestler, qualifying for the state tournament. He then entered the University of Wisconsin–Madison (1996–1997) and at the University of Washington (1998–1999). He was a 1998 third-team and 1999 second-team All-American. Hart was selected seventh overall in the 2000 MLS SuperDraft by the Colorado Rapids. In his first two years with the Rapids, Hart missed the beginning of each season due to injuries. The team did send him on loan with the MLS Project 40 team in 2000. However, the following two seasons saw Hart return from injury where he was able to play a more substantial role with team. Before the beginning of the 2004 season, Hart was traded to the San Jose Earthquakes from the Rapids for a conditional pick in the 2005 MLS SuperDraft. Hart saw a more limited role with the Quakes, appearing in less than half the games. After appearing in seven games in 2005, he was released on August 4, 2005.

<text>The Division of Fisher is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. The current MP is Andrew Wallace of the Liberal Party.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

The division was created in 1949 and is named after Andrew Fisher, Prime Minister of Australia on three non-consecutive occasions within the first two decades following Federation. It is located in the Sunshine Coast area north of Brisbane and includes the towns of Caloundra, Mooloolaba, Beerwah, Maleny, Woodford and Kilcoy.

As originally created, it extended as far inland as Kingaroy, but gradually moved eastward from the 1960s onward to become an entirely Sunshine Coast-based seat. It was a safe seat for the National Party until the 1980s. However, some of its more conservative territory was shifted to the new seat of Fairfax in 1984, replaced by some more marginal territory in the outer northern suburbs of Brisbane. On these boundaries, Labor took the seat in 1987.

The Brisbane portion was removed in 1993 (mostly going to the new seat of Dickson), erasing Labor&#x27;s majority and making Fisher notionally Liberal. The Liberals took the seat in 1993, and have held it for all but two years since then without much difficulty. To date, it is the last time Labor has held a Sunshine Coast seat.

Its most prominent members have been Sir Charles Adermann, who was Deputy Leader of the Country Party 1964–66, and Peter Slipper, who served as Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives from 2011 to 2012. Following the resignation of Harry Jenkins as Speaker in the 43rd Parliament, Peter Slipper was nominated unopposed and installed as Speaker on 24 November 2011. Slipper resigned from the Liberal National Party on taking the Speaker&#x27;s seat and continued in parliament as an independent member and resigned as speaker and went to the cross bench on 9 October 2012. On 11 May 2013, he joined businessman Clive Palmer&#x27;s recently formed Palmer United Party, becoming its first member in federal parliament. However, a matter of hours later his membership of the party was revoked and Slipper returned to being an independent.

<text>Prince Jeremi Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki, nicknamed Hammer on the Cossacks (), was a notable member of the aristocracy of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Prince of Vyshnivets, Lubny and Khorol in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the father of the future King of Poland, Michael I.

A notable magnate and military commander with Ruthenian and Moldavian origin, Wiśniowiecki was heir of one of the biggest fortunes of the state and rose to several notable dignities, including the position of voivode of the Ruthenian Voivodship (today Poland and Ukraine) in 1646. His conversion from Eastern Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism caused much dissent in Ruthenian lands (part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). Wiśniowiecki was a successful military leader as well as one of the wealthiest magnates of Poland, ruling over lands inhabited by 230,000 people.

==Biography==

===Youth===

Jeremi Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki was born in 1612; neither the exact date nor the place of his birth are known. His father, Michał Wiśniowiecki, of the Ruthenian Wiśniowiecki family, died soon after Jeremi&#x27;s birth, in 1616. His mother, Regina Mohyła (Raina Mohylanka) was a Moldavian-born noble woman of the Movilești family, daughter of the Moldavian Prince Ieremia Movilă, Jeremy&#x27;s namesake; she died in 1619. Both of his parents were of the Eastern Orthodox Church rite; Jeremy&#x27;s uncle was the influential Orthodox theologian Petro Mohyla, and his great-uncle was Gheorghe Movilă, the Metropolitan of Moldavia.

Orphaned at the age of seven, Wiśniowiecki was raised by his uncle, Konstanty Wiśniowiecki, whose branch of the family were Roman Catholics. Jeremi attended a Jesuit college in Lviv and later, in 1629, he traveled to Italy, where he briefly attended the University of Bologna. He also acquired some military experience in the Netherlands. The upbringing by his uncle and the trips abroad polonized him, and turned him into one of the youngest magnates of Poland and Lithuania.

In 1631 Wiśniowiecki returned to the Commonwealth and took over from his uncle the management of his father&#x27;s huge estate, which included a large part of what is now Ukraine. In 1632 he converted from Eastern Orthodoxy to Catholicism, an action that caused much concern in Ukraine. His decision has been analyzed by historians, and often criticized, particularly in Ukrainian historiography. The Orthodox Church feared losing a powerful protector, and Isaiah Kopinsky, metropolitan bishop of Kyiv and a friend of his mother, unsuccessfully pleaded with him to change his mind. Jeremi would not budge although he remained on decent terms with the Orthodox Church, avoiding provocative actions, and supported his uncle and Orthodox bishop Petro Mohyla and his Orthodox Church collegium.

===Later life===
Wiśniowiecki&#x27;s courtier and first biographer, Michał Kałyszowski, counted that Jeremi participated in nine wars in his lifetime. The first of those was the Smolensk Campaign of 1633–34 against the Tsardom of Russia. In that war he accompanied castellan Aleksander Piaseczyński&#x27;s southern army and took part in several battles, among them the unsuccessful siege of Putyvl; later that year they took Rylsk and Sevsk before retreating. The following year he worked with Adam Kisiel and Łukasz Żółkiewski, commanding his own private army of 4,000. As his troops formed 2/3 of their army (not counting supporting Cossack elements), Jeremi, despite being the most junior of commanders, had much influence over their campaign. Lacking in artillery, they failed to take any major towns, but ravaged the countryside near Sevsk and Kursk. The war ended soon afterward, and in May 1634 he returned to Lubny. For his service, he received a commendation from the King of Poland, Władysław IV Vasa, and the castellany of Kyiv.

After the war Wiśniowiecki engaged in a number of conflicts with neighbouring magnates and nobles. Jeremi was able to afford a sizable private army of several thousands, and through the threat of it he was often able to force his neighbours to a favourable settlement of disputes. Soon after his return from the Russian front, he participated on the side of the Dowmont family in the quarrel over the estate of Dowmontów against another magnate, Samuel Łaszcz, located on his lands; soon after the victorious battle against Łaszcz he bought the lands from the Dowmonts and incorporated them into his estates.

Around 1636 the Sejm (Polish parliament) opposed the marriage of King Władysław IV Waza to Wiśniowiecki&#x27;s sister, Anna. Following this, Jeremi distanced himself from the royal court, although he periodically returned to Warsaw, usually as one of the deputies to the Sejm from the Ruthenian Voivodeship (today Ukraine). Soon afterward, Jeremi himself married Gryzelda Zamoyska, daughter of Chancellor Tomasz Zamoyski, on 27 February 1639, Gryzelda&#x27;s 16th birthday.

At that time Wiśniowiecki also engaged in a political conflict over nobility titles, in particular, the title of prince (kniaź). The nobility in the Commonwealth was officially equal, and used different and non-hereditary titles than those found in rest of the world (see officials of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth); the gist of the conflict, which took much of the Sejm&#x27;s time around 1638–41, revolved around whether old prince titles (awarded to families before their lands were incorporated into the Commonwealth in the 1569 Union of Lublin), and the new titles, awarded more recently by some foreign courts, should be recognized. Wiśniowiecki was one of the chief participants in this debate, successfully defending the old titles, including that of his own family, and succeeding in abolishing the new titles, which gained him the enmity of another powerful magnate, Jerzy Ossoliński. Other than this conflict, in his years as a deputy (1635–46), Jeremi wasn&#x27;t involved in any major political issues, and only twice (in 1640 and 1642) he served in the minor function of a commissar for investigating the eastern and southern border disputes.

In 1637 Wiśniowiecki might have fought under Hetman Mikołaj Potocki against the Cossack rebellion of Pavlo Pavliuk (the Pawluk Uprising); Jan Widacki notes that historians are not certain whether he did and in either case, no detailed accounts of his possible participation survive. A year later, returning from the Sejm and from the engagement ceremony with Gryzelda, he gathered a 4,000 strong division that participated in putting down of the Ostrzanin Uprising and arrived at the region affected by the unrest in June that year. Together with Hetman Potocki he defeated the insurgents at the Battle of Żownin, which turned into a rather difficult siege of the Cossack camp that lasted from 13 June till the Cossack relief forces were defeated on 4 August, and the Cossacks capitulated on 7 August.

===Final years===
In 1641, after the death of his uncle Konstanty Wiśniowiecki, Jeremi became the last adult male of the Wiśniowiecki family and inherited all the remaining estates of the clan, despite a brief conflict with Aleksander Ludwik Radziwiłł who also claimed the inherited land. The conflict stemmed from the fact that Konstanty asked Jeremi to take care of his grandchildren, but their mother, Katarzyna Eugenia Tyszkiewicz, married Aleksander, who declared himself able and willing to take care of her children – and their estates. A year later, Katarzyna Eugenia decided to divorce Aleksander, and the matter was settled in favor of Jeremi.

Wiśniowiecki also fought against the Tatars in 1640–46, whose raids on the south-east frontier of the Commonwealth endangered his holdings. In 1644 together with Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski he took part in the victorious Battle of Ochmatów, in which they crushed forces of Crimean Tatars led by Toğay bey (Tuhaj Bej).

In 1644, after the false news of the death of Adam Kazanowski, Wiśniowiecki took over his disputed estate of Rumno by subterfuge. For this he was at first sentenced to exile, but due to his influence, even the King could not realistically expect to enforce this ruling without a civil war. Eventually after more discussions at local sejmiks and then in the Sejm, he won the case and was granted the right for Rumno. In 1646, after the death of Koniecpolski, he became the voivode of Ruthenia. He invaded and took over the town of Hadiach which was also being claimed by a son of Koniecpolski, Aleksander Koniecpolski, but a year later, in 1647, he lost that case and was forced to return the town.

On 4 April 1646 Wiśniowiecki received the office of the voivode of Ruthenia, which granted him a seat in the Senate of Poland. He was the third member of the Wiśniowiecki family to gain that privilege. Soon afterward, however, he refused to support King Władysław&#x27;s plan for a war against the Ottoman Empire, even though the King offered him the rank of a Field Crown Hetman.

Then the autumn of 1646, Wiśniowiecki invaded and took over the starostwo kaniowskie vacated recently by banished Samuel Łaszcz. He did so without any legal justifications, which caused a court ruling against him; a ruling that was however never enforced. Later that year, he raised a large private army of about 25,000 for a purpose unknown, as noted by Widacki, who writes that the army, which Jeremi raised with an immense cost for a short time, did not participate in any engagement, nor did it have any clear purpose. He notes that such an army might have been useful in provoking the Ottomans, but as Jeremi was opposed to the war with them up to the point of refusing the hetman office, his actions are puzzling even for the modern historians.

===Khmelnytsky uprising===

Wiśniowiecki fought against the Cossacks again during the Khmelnytsky Uprising in 1648–51. He received information about a growing unrest, and began mobilizing his troops, and in early May learned about the Cossack victory at the Battle of Zhovti Vody. Receiving no orders from Hetmans Mikołaj Potocki and Marcin Kalinowski, he began moving on his own, soon learning about the second Cossack victory at Battle of Korsuń, which meant that his troops (about 6,000 strong) were the only Polish forces in Transdnieper at that moment. After taking in the situation, he began retreating towards Chernihiv; his army soon became a focal point for various refugees. Passing Chernihiv, he continued through Liubech to Brahin. He continued to Mazyr, Zhytomir, and Pohrebyshche, stopping briefly in Zhytomir for the local sejmik. After some skirmishes near Nemyriv, Makhnivka and Starokostiantyniv (Battle of Starokostiantyniv) against the Cossack forces, by July he would arrive near Zbarazh.
Wiśniowiecki&#x27;s fighting retreat had a major impact on the course of the war. In the words of the historian Władysław Konopczyński, &quot;he was neither defeated, nor victorious, and thus he made the peace more difficult.&quot; Politicians in safe Warsaw tried to negotiate with the Cossacks, who in turn used Wiśniowiecki&#x27;s actions as an excuse to delay any serious negotiations.

Around late August or early September, Wiśniowiecki met with the army regimentarzs Władysław Dominik Zasławski-Ostrogski, Mikołaj Ostroróg and Aleksander Koniecpolski. He was not on overly friendly terms with them, as he resented being passed in military nominations, but after short negotiations, he agreed to follow their orders, and thus reduced to a junior commander status which had little impact over the next phase of the campaign. On 23 September, their forces were, however, defeated at the Battle of Pyliavtsi; near the end of the battle some accounts suggest Wiśniowiecki was offered the hetman&#x27;s position, but refused. On 28 September in Lviv, Wiśniowiecki, with popular support, was given a field regimentarz nomination; about a week later this nomination was confirmed by the Sejm. To the anger of Lviv&#x27;s townfolk, he decided to focus on retreating towards the key fortress in Zamość instead of Lviv; he would leave garrisons on both towns, and keep his army in the field. In the end, the cities were not captured by the Cossacks, who in the light of the coming winter decided to retreat, after being paid a ransom by both town councils; no other large field battle took place that year.

Meanwhile, the convocation sejm of 1648 had elected a new king, Jan Kazimierz II Vasa. Wiśniowiecki supported other candidates, such as George I Rákóczi and Karol Ferdynand Vasa (Jan Kazimierz&#x27;s brother). Due to the opposition from Jeremi&#x27;s detractors, he was not granted a hetman position, although after a full two days of debate on the subject he was granted a document that stated he had a &quot;power equal to that of a hetman.&quot; Wiśniowiecki faction, arguing for an increase in army size, was once again marginalized by the faction that hoped for a peaceful resolution. In the end, the King and most of the szlachta were lulled into a false sense of security, and the military was not reinforced significantly. To add an insult to an injury, the coronation sejm of January–February 1649, held in Kraków, revoked Wiśniowieck&#x27;s regimentarz rank.

In the first half of 1649, the negotiations with the Cossacks fell through, and the Polish–Lithuanian military began gathering near the borders with Ukraine. A major camp was in Zbarazh, where Wiśniowiecki would arrive as well in late June, after gathering a new army of 3,000 in Wiśnicz, which was all he was able to afford at that time, due to most of his estates being overrun by the Cossacks. Wiśniowiecki&#x27;s arrival raised the morale of the royal army, and despite having no official rank, both the common soldiers and the new regimentarz promised to take his advice, and even offered him the official command (which he refused). During the siege of Zbarazh, Wiśniowiecki was thus not the official commander (role was taken by regimentarz Andrzej Firlej) but most historians agree he was the real, if unofficial, commander of the Polish–Lithuanian army. The siege would last until the ceasefire of the Treaty of Zboriv. Wiśniowiecki&#x27;s command during the siege was seen as phenomenal, and his popularity among the troops and nobility rose again, however the King, still not fond of him, gave him a relatively small reward (the land grant of &quot;starostwo przasnyskie&quot;, much less when compared to several others he distributed around that time). Needing Wiśniowiecki&#x27;s support in December that year, the King granted him once again a temporary hetman nomination, and several more land grants. In April 1650, Wiśniowiecki had to return his temporary hetman office to Mikołaj Potocki, recently released from Cossack&#x27;s captivity. During December that year, in light of the growing tensions with Muscovy, Wiśniowiecki&#x27;s military faction succeeded in convincing the Sejm to pass a resolution increasing the size of the army to 51,000, the largest army since the Cossack unrest began two years earlier.

The truce of Zboriv did not last long, and in the spring of 1651 Khmelnytsky&#x27;s Cossacks began advancing west again. On 1 June 1651 Wiśniowiecki brought his private army to face the Cossacks in Sokal. He commanded the left wing of the Polish–Lithuanian army in the victorious Battle of Berestechko on 28–30 June . The Polish–Lithuanian army advanced after the retreating Cossacks, but on 17 July the King &quot;left the whole army to Potocki ... and having given the order that the army march into Ukraine, the King himself parted ... to Warsaw to celebrate his victories over the Cossacks.&quot; Later that year, on 14 August, Wiśniowiecki suddenly fell ill while in a camp near the village of Pawołocz, and died on 20 August 1651, at the age of only 39. His cause of death was never known, while some (even contemporaries) speculated he was poisoned, but no conclusive evidence to support such a claim have ever been found. Based on sparse descriptions of his illness and subsequent investigations, some medical historians suggest the cause of death might have been a disease related to cholera. However, one account states, &quot;following a cheerful conversation with other officers who had congregated for a military council in his tent on Sunday 13 August N.S. he had eaten some cucumbers with zest and washed them down with mead, and from that contracted dysentery. After lying ill for a week, he died there, at Pavoloch&quot;. He was given a &quot;ceremonial funeral with the entire army present. On 22 August Wiśniowiecki&#x27;s body was seen off with the utmost pomp on its journey to his residence&quot;.

Wiśniowiecki&#x27;s indebted family was not able to provide him with a funeral his rank and fame deserved. In the end, he never received the large funeral and the temporary location of his body, the monastery of the Holy Cross at Łysa Góra, became his final resting place. His body was believed lost in a fire at the end of the 18th century, which would prevent a modern reexamination of the cause of his death, although a body purported to be his had been discovered by Oblates in 1936. In the interwar period, the authenticity was questioned by the magnate&#x27;s biographer, , who argued that the body had been burned in a fire in 1777. Forensic examination in 1980 showed that the body belonged to another person, who was taller and died at a more advanced age than Wiśniowiecki. No traces of the autopsy performed in the 17th century were found; however, it is likely that this person lived in the same historical period and their corpse was kept on display in the monastery as Wiśniowiecki.

== Wealth ==
The majority of the Wiśniowiecki family estates were found on the eastern side of the Dnieper River (Volhynian, Ruthenian and Kyiv Voivodships), and most of them were acquired by Jeremi&#x27;s grandfather, Aleksander Wiśniowiecki, in the 16th century. The capital of his estate was located at a fortified manor at Lubny, where his father rebuilt an old castle; the population of the town itself could be estimated at 1,000. Wiśniowiecki inherited lands inhabited, according to an estimate from 1628, by about 4,500 people, of which Lubny was the largest town. Smaller towns in his lands included Khorol, Pyriatyn and Pryluky. By 1646 his lands were inhabited by 230,000 people. The number of towns on his lands rose from several to about thirty, and their population increased as well. The prosperity of those lands reflected Wiśniowiecki&#x27;s skills in economic management, and the income from his territories (estimated at 600,000 złotys yearly) made him one of the wealthiest magnates in the Commonwealth. Because of its size and relatively consistent borders, Wiśniowiecki&#x27;s estate was often named &quot;Wiśniowieczczyzna&quot; (&quot;Wiśniowieckiland&quot;).

Despite his wealth, he was not known for a lavish life. His court of about a hundred people was not known for being overly extravagant, he built no luxurious residences and did not even have a single portrait of himself made during his life. It is uncertain how Wiśniowiecki looked, although a number of portraits and other works depicting him exist. Jan Widacki notes that much of the historiography concerning Wiśniowiecki focuses on the military and political aspects of his life, and few of his critics discuss his successes in the economic development of his estates.

== Remembrance and popular culture ==
Wiśniowiecki was widely popular among the noble class, who saw in him a defender of tradition, a patriot and an able military commander. He was praised by many of his contemporaries, including a poet, Samuel Twardowski, as well as numerous diary writers and early historians. For his protection of civilian population, including Jews, during the Uprising, Wiśniowiecki has been commended by early Jewish historians. Until the 19th century, he has been idolized as the legendary, perfect &quot;knight of the borderlands&quot;, his sculpture is among the twenty sculpture of famous historical personas in the 18th century &quot;Knight Room&quot; of the royal Warsaw Castle.

In the 19th century this image started to waver, as a new wave in historiography began to reinterpret his life, and as the era of positivism in Poland put more value on builders, and less on warriors. Further, at that time the Polish historians began to question the traditional view of the &quot;Ukrainian problem&quot;, and the way that the Polish noble class had dealt with the Cossacks. Slowly, Wiśniowiecki&#x27;s image as a hero began to waver, with various aspects of his life and personality being questioned and criticized in the work of historians such as Karol Szajnocha and Józef Szujski.

While Wiśniowiecki&#x27;s portrayal (as a major secondary character) in the first part of Henryk Sienkiewicz&#x27;s trilogy, &quot;With Fire and Sword&quot; which describes the history of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth during the Uprising, was rather positive, criticism of his persona intensified, in particular from Sienkiewicz detractors such as Zygmunt Kaczkowski and Olgierd Górka. The 1930s saw a first modern historical work about Wiśniowiecki, by . In the era of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, the Communist Party&#x27;s ideology dictated that all historians present him as an &quot;enemy of the people&quot;, although this began to be relaxed after 1965. Widacki, analyzing the work of other historians notes that Władysław Czapliński was rather sympathetic to Wiśniowiecki, while Paweł Jasienica was critical of him. Andrzej Seweryn played Jeremi Wiśniowiecki in the 1999 film &quot;With Fire and Sword&quot;.

Wiśniowiecki was the main subject of one of Jacek Kaczmarski&#x27;s 1993 songs &quot;Kniazia Jaremy nawrócenie&quot; (&quot;The Conversion of Knyaz Jarema&quot;).

<text>Mike Nelson&#x27;s Movie Megacheese is the first book by Michael J. Nelson, published in 2000 by HarperEntertainment, an imprint of HarperCollins publishers.

The book is a series of essays about &quot;cheesy&quot; films. Some of the essays originally appeared in Home Theater and Entertainment@Home magazines. Prior to the book, Nelson was head writer of Mystery Science Theater 3000 for ten years, as well as starring as Mike Nelson for the final five-and-a-half seasons the show. He has published two follow-up books, &quot;Mike Nelson&#x27;s Mind Over Matters&quot; and &quot;Mike Nelson&#x27;s Death Rat!&quot;.

==Sections==
The book is separated into nine sections:

===Annnnd Action!===
This covers brainless action films, including &quot;Volcano&quot;, &quot;Action Jackson&quot;, &quot;Independence Day&quot;, and the works of Jean-Claude Van Damme.

===Wild Thangs===
This one chooses films vaguely tied together by an animal of some sort: &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot;, &quot;Anaconda&quot;, the Batman films, and the Matt LeBlanc opus &quot;Ed&quot;.

===TeeVee===
The aptly titled “TeeVee” section covers, well, TV: &quot;Baywatch&quot;, &quot;Judge Judy&quot;, the Food Network, &quot;&quot;, and the Matt LeBlanc opus &quot;Friends&quot;.

===Science Friction===
Everything from &quot;Star Trek&quot; to &quot;The Postman&quot; to the Matt LeBlanc opus &quot;Lost In Space&quot;. The chapter also heavily discusses in a tongue-in-cheek manner (as a running commentary throughout the various sections) the then-relatively new DVD technology.

===The Five Families (Plus Two)===
A whole chapter devoted to Hollywood&#x27;s movers and shakers: The Arquettes (David, Patricia, Rosanna, and Alexis), The Baldwins, The Culkins (Macaulay and Kieran), The Dillon Brothers (Matt and Kevin), The Sheen/Estevez (Martin, Charlie, Joe and Emilio), The Penn Brothers (Sean and Chris), and, of course, The Wayans. Matt LeBlanc does not make an appearance in this chapter.

===Chik Flix===
In a particularly amusing chapter, Nelson dresses in drag to rent &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, as well as &quot;Her Alibi&quot;, &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot;, &quot;Stepmom&quot;, &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot;, and the Nora Ephron/Meg Ryan canon.

===The Legends===
Brando. Joe Eszterhas. Andrew McCarthy. Bruce Willis. And Top. Carrot Top. These are The Legends.

===Very Odds ‘n’ Ends===
A catch-all chapter documenting &quot;The Craft&quot;, &quot;Date with an Angel&quot;, &quot;My Demon Lover&quot;, &quot;Patch Adams&quot;, &quot;Spring Break&quot;, &quot;Ishtar&quot;, and &quot;Waterworld&quot;.

===Mega-Megacheese===
The final chapter only has two entries: &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; and &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie&quot;.

<text>Conseil représentatif des institutions juives de France (CRIF) () is an umbrella organization of other groups representing the interests of French Jews.

==Overview==

It is the official French affiliate of the World Jewish Congress (WJC), the world-wide umbrella organization of Jewish communities, and of the European Jewish Congress. It opposes antisemitism and antisemitic policies. It generally supports Zionism and the state of Israel, although in 2004 CRIF refuted Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon&#x27;s characterization of antisemitism in France and his calls for French Jews to emigrate to Israel.

On 20 November 2004, CRIF accused the French government of failing to protect citizens from broadcasts by Hezbollah&#x27;s al-Manar TV, which includes films that CRIF asserts are antisemitic and incite Muslims to attack Jews. Al-Manar was blocked by the CSA. It has opposed the beatification of Pope Pius XII, stating that a majority of historians disagreed with the position that Pius worked ceaselessly to save Jews.

French neo-Nazis planned an attack on the CRIF headquarters in 2023. Kalashnikovs and a laboratory for producing explosives were discovered at a suspect&#x27;s home. In chat messages they wrote that they wanted to carry out an attack “worse than Bataclan”.

<doc id="1191317" wikidata="Q899706" url="?curid=1191317" title="Peru–Bolivian Confederation">
<text>The Peru–Bolivian Confederation () was a short-lived state that existed in South America between 1836 and 1839. The country was a loose confederation made up of three states: North Peru and South Peru—states that arose from the division of the Peruvian Republic due to the civil wars of 1834 and 1835 to 1836—as well as the Bolivian State.

The geographical limits of the Confederation varied over time, with Bolivia occupying and incorporating the disputed territories in northern Argentina in 1838. It also possessed &quot;de facto&quot; autonomous indigenous territories, such as Iquicha, all under the supreme command of Marshal Andrés de Santa Cruz, who assumed the position of Supreme Protector in 1836, while he was president of Bolivia.

Although its institutional creation arose on May 1, 1837, with the , its &quot;de facto&quot; establishment dated from October 28, 1836—with the end of the war between Salaverry and Santa Cruz—until August 25, 1839, with its dissolution proclaimed by General Agustín Gamarra, the Peruvian &quot;restorationist&quot; president who declared war against the Confederation, supported by the United Restoration Army headed by himself and Chilean Manuel Bulnes—formerly the Restoration Army of Peru—made up of Peruvian and Bolivian opponents of the Confederation, as well as the governments and armies of Chile and Argentina. Both Chile and Argentina opposed the Confederation as a potential military and economic threat, and for its support for dissidents in exile.

Argentina and Bolivia reached an agreement after their war over Tarija, and the Confederate Army was ultimately defeated by the United Restoration Army in the 1839 Battle of Yungay, which put an end to the War of the Confederation. Historian Jorge Basadre frames the confederation as part of a period of &quot;determination of the nationalities&quot; in western South America.

==History==
===Background===

At the beginning of the 19th century, Simón Bolívar postulated the idea of creating a great nation, coinciding with Andrés de Santa Cruz, who thought of uniting Peru and Bolivia in a single country, the latter colloquially known as Upper Peru. The idea of uniting both countries was the general idea of several influential political leaders in Peru—including Francisco Xavier de Luna Pizarro, , , Agustín Gamarra, among others—who sought to reintegrate the two Perus, disagreeing only in the form of the “union”: confederation or merger. An important factor in the desire to unite these two states were the historical ties between both regions, even after independence.

After political instability and a coup d&#x27;état in 1835, a civil war broke out between newly self-declared president Felipe Santiago Salaverry and constitutional president Luis José de Orbegoso, who allowed Bolivian president Andrés de Santa Cruz to send his troops through the Peruvian border. After the latter&#x27;s triumph in 1836, assemblies were soon established to make way for the creation of the Confederation.

===Prelude===
Two constituent congresses were established in each of the three founding states of the confederation, in the cities of Huaura (North Peru), Sicuani (South-Peru) and (Bolivia). Immediately, the representatives of the three states promised to celebrate the union pact of the Peru–Bolivian Confederation as soon as possible.

The Sicuani Assembly was established on March 16, 1836, and closed on March 22. It featured representatives from Ayacucho, Arequipa, Cuzco, Puno and Tacna. On April 10, Orbegoso recognized South Peru as an independent state through a decree, and a Supreme Court was installed in Cuzco on August 24. The assembly also created the country&#x27;s flag and currency. Fines were put in place to prevent the (now North) Peruvian flag from being flown.

The Huaura Assembly lasted from August 3 to 24, 1836, and featured representatives from La Libertad, Lima, Huaylas, Maynas and Junín. On August 11, North Peru was officially established through the promulgation of its constitution by the then President Orbegoso, naming Santa Cruz—who triumphantly entered Lima on August 15—as the Supreme Protector of the state. Orbegoso also presented his resignation, but it was not approved by the assembly, who named him provisional president. The assembly also established the new territorial divisions of the country. Unlike its new southern neighbour, North Peru maintained the national symbols of its predecessor.

In the case of Bolivia, a special session of the had previously been held on June 21, 1836, which authorized Santa Cruz to complete the confederation project to which Bolivia had already adhered with the Law of July 22, 1835. Around that time, Santa Cruz received the diploma and insignia of Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour, with which the King of France honored him. He also received a communication from Pope Gregory XVI and a rosary with his medal, blessed by the Pope himself.

===Establishment===
Provided, then, with all the legal elements granted by the assemblies of the three states, Santa Cruz decreed the establishment of the Peru–Bolivian Confederation, by decree given in Lima on October 28, 1836. A congress known today as the Congress of Tacna () was ordered to meet in Tacna to establish the foundations of the confederation. A customs office was also opened in Arica, which employed both South Peruvians and Bolivians.

During the meeting, Santa Cruz arranged for each state to send a priest, a soldier and a lawyer as delegates before, and consequently, three religious, three lawyers and three soldiers marched to Tacna. The nine delegates were as follows:
*Representing North Peru
**, bishop of Trujillo
**, lawyer and member of the Supreme Court
**, colonel
*Representing South Peru
**, bishop of Arequipa
**Pedro José Flórez, lawyer and judge of Ayacucho
**Juan José Larrea, colonel
*Representing Bolivia
**José María Mendizábal, bishop of La Plata
**Pedro Buitrago, lawyer and member of the Supreme Court
**Miguel María de Aguirre, colonel

Initially, January 24, 1837, was chosen as the congress&#x27; date, but it had to be postponed. Santa Cruz decided to accompany the plenipotentiaries of the North-Peruvian State, for which reason he left Lima and embarked on the frigate &quot;Flora&quot; on February 9, but instead of disembarking in Islay, he went to Arica, where he arrived on February 27. The congress was postponed to April 18; Meanwhile, Santa Cruz remained in Arica, but on March 2 he headed for Tacna, where he was received with much fanfare. From Tacna he went to Viacha on March 10, arriving in La Paz the following day. There, together with the Bolivian plenipotentiaries Aguirre and Buitrago, and Bolivian Vice President Mariano Enrique Calvo, he agreed on the project that should be discussed and approved in Tacna. Then, in the first days of April, he went down to Tacna again.

On April 18, 1837, the Tacna Congress was inaugurated, with the presence of the nine delegates. The Pact of Tacna () was signed without debate during the congress. It established the legal framework through which the state would operate, and also included the design of the flag. Reactions to the pact were mixed event among its signatories, and disagreements led to the establishment of one constituent congress per member state. The act was later promulgated in 1837.

===Political instability and wars===

Like Orbegoso, Santa Cruz also had many opponents and enemies born in the frequent caudillo clashes of the early years of Peru&#x27;s republican history. Among those enemies were powerful characters such as Agustín Gamarra and Ramón Castilla, who at the time were exiled in Chile.

The rivalry that existed between the ports of Callao and Valparaíso worsened as a result of the establishment of the Confederation. A tariff war soon began between both states, and Orbegoso supported Ramón Freire&#x27;s failed expedition against Diego Portales. The Congress of Chile approved the declaration of war on December 26, 1836, claiming that Santa Cruz&#x27;s rule over Peru was illegitimate, and that his influence threatened the integrity of other South American nations, as seen by Orbegoso&#x27;s support for the attempted invasion of Chile by Freire, specifically pointing out the attempt on Portales.

A territorial dispute between Argentina and Bolivia over the territory of Tarija escalated, as Bolivia occupied and annexed the territory and Juan Manuel de Rosas then declared war on the Confederation on May 19, 1837, accusing Santa Cruz of harboring supporters of the Unitarian Party. The accusations ended up being true, as Santa Cruz had financially supported the émigrés.

Portales was assassinated in Valparaíso after a mutiny broke out in Quillota, leading to preparations for the invasion of South Peru. Thus, the first &quot;Restorative Expedition&quot; left Valparaíso on September 15, 1837, landing in Quilca, and occupying Arequipa on October 12, establishing a local government on October 17. The Confederate Navy captured the Juan Fernández Islands on November 14.

On November 17, after the Chileans were surrounded by Peruvian troops, the Treaty of Paucarpata was signed by Manuel Blanco Encalada under the guarantee of Great Britain, through which the occupation was undone six days later and the Peruvian ships captured by Chile were to be returned. After Blanco Encalada&#x27;s troops arrived in Valparaíso, he was met with hostile demonstrations and the Chilean government repudiated the treaty of Paucarpata. A second expedition headed by Manuel Bulnes was organized, which left for Peru on July 19, 1838.

===Dissolution===
Around the same time, North Peru seceded from the Confederation on July 30, but was nevertheless attacked and defeated by the United Restoration Army in the Battle of Portada de Guías of August 21. Meanwhile, Confederate troops in Callao were besieged by the same army.

During this time, the Confederation&#x27;s stability collapsed, as by September, Peru (i.e. North and South Peru) was under the &quot;de jure&quot; control of seven different presidents at one time: Santa Cruz, who was the Supreme Protector; Gamara, the restorationist president; Orbegoso, leader of the secessionist North Peruvian state; José de la Riva Agüero, who replaced Orbegoso, being appointed by Santa Cruz; Pío de Tristán, president of South Peru; Domingo Nieto, in the north; and Juan Francisco de Vidal in Huaylas.

Santa Cruz occupied Lima on November 10, ending the siege in Callao, but left for the north, where the restaurateurs were located. He was defeated in the Battle of Yungay on January 20, 1839, and thus, the Confederation was dissolved, with Gamarra announcing its dissolution on August 25. The Confederate defeat led to the exile of Santa Cruz, first to Guayaquil, in Ecuador, then to Chile, and finally to Europe, where he died.

After the Confederation was defeated, loyalists such as Antonio Huachaca kept fighting against the new Peruvian government, being also defeated in November 1839.

==Government and politics==
According to the Fundamental law of the Peru–Bolivian Confederation () signed on April 18, 1837, in each of the Confederation&#x27;s states, there was, from 1837 until the dissolution, a “provisional president” under Marshal Andrés de Santa Cruz, who was styled the “supreme protector” and was also president of Bolivia.

*Bolivia
:*President: General José Miguel de Velasco

*North Peru (also known as &quot;Republic of the North of Peru&quot;, or &quot;North-Peruvian Republic&quot;)
:*First President: General Luis Orbegoso (August 21, 1837 – July 30, 1838)
:*Second President: General José de la Riva Agüero (August 1, 1838 – January 24, 1839)

*South Peru (also known as &quot;Republic of the South of Peru&quot;, or &quot;South-Peruvian Republic&quot;)
:*First President: General Ramón Herrera y Rodado (September 17, 1837 – October 12, 1838)
:*Second President: Juan Pío de Tristán y Moscoso (October 12, 1838 – February 23, 1839)

This was in accordance to the constitution&#x27;s stating that each of the three republics would have its own government, with equal rights between the three, but they were subject to the authority of a General Government, whose three powers would have the following characteristics:

*The Central Executive Power would be in the hands of Santa Cruz with the title of Protector of the Confederation, with a term of 10 years and the possibility of being re-elected, although the latter was not applicable if he had been removed from office by the Senate. The general customs and the general postal administration depended on him, as well as all diplomatic, military and naval appointments. He was also Generalissimo of the sea and land forces of the confederate republics. He exercised the executive power of the state in which he was found. He appointed and removed the ministers of State and other public employees, being able to create new ministries. He chose the presidents of the confederate states, the senators of the General Congress and the ministers of the three supreme courts from among those proposed by their respective senates. He presented to the apostolic chair the archbishops and bishops of the three republics. He could dissolve the General Congress when a spirit of disorder manifestly seized the chambers, threatening the internal peace of the confederation.
*The General Legislative Power would be made up of two Chambers: one of Senators, with 15 members (five per State), and another of Representatives, with 21 members (7 per State). They met every two years for fifty days, and may be extended at the discretion of the Executive. He could be summoned extraordinarily by the government, having to deal exclusively with the matters imposed by it. All this made him a kind of caricature of legislative power.
:*The senators had to be appointed by the Protector from among those proposed by the Electoral Colleges of each department. Their functions were similar to those of the censors mentioned in the Lifetime Constitution of 1826.
:*The representatives had to be chosen by the General Congress of the confederation, from among those proposed by the Electoral Colleges of each of the confederate republics.
*The Judicial Power would be constituted on the basis of the Supreme Courts of the three Confederate Republics.

In addition to the above, the constitution also defined the flag of the confederation.

===Administrative divisions===


===Foreign relations===
*: after Bolivia occupied and annexed the disputed territory of Tarija, Argentina declared war on the Confederation on May 19, 1837. After the war ended, Argentina negotiated with the new Bolivian state over the territories, and Tarija ultimately remained in Bolivia.
*: Brazilian diplomat Duarte da Ponte Ribeiro was appointed as the Brazilian chargé d&#x27;affaires to Peru in 1829, and continued his functions after the establishment of the Confederation in 1836. After the state&#x27;s dissolution, he remained as the representative to Peru, signing a border treaty in 1841.
*: Morazán and Andrés de Santa Cruz never met, due to political circumstances.
* Chile: relations soured quickly after the establishment of the Confederation as Chile wanted to maintain its hegemony over trade in the South Pacific. Peruvian support for a failed naval invasion led to the declaration of war in 1836, which led to a Chilean-backed naval invasion in South Peru, through which relations were reestablished via the 1837 Treaty of Paucarpata.
* Ecuador: Vicente Rocafuerte, then president of Ecuador, presented a neutral position despite repeated attempts by Chile to get Ecuador to join the conflict, offering instead to act as a mediator. Despite this, according to J.P. Roldán, then Consul in Guayaquil, supporters of Juan José Flores were eager to join Chile in its war effort. Santa Cruz&#x27;s government favoured Ecuador by sending subversive leaders José María Urvina and Juan Otamendi to Jauja, as well as interning subversive Ecuadorians to the &quot;Sierra&quot;. Ecuador had signed a treaty with the three member states of the Confederation, which was annulled by the Ecuadorian Congress in 1837 under Flores&#x27; influence. When the Confederation ceased to exist, its consulate in Guayaquil was transferred to the new Peruvian government.
*: The French King Louis Philippe I has cordial relations with Andrés de Santa Cruz. The French government has given Andrés de Santa Cruz asylum after his exile after the dissolution of the confederation. 
*: The British government acted as guarantor of the Treaty of Paucarpata of 1837. When the treaty was annulled, the Consul General notified the Chilean government of Queen Victoria&#x27;s disapproval of the continuation of the war. Then chargé d&#x27;affaires Belford Hinton Wilson made demands to guarantee the safety of British goods in Lima, which were later moved to Callao.
*: The Government of José Justo Corro has diplomatic relations with both Peru and Bolivia. 
*: When pressed by Chilean minister Ventura Lavalle to join the conflict, then president Francisco de Paula Santander expressed his belief that, despite him agreeing with Chile over the threat the state posed to the region (and his personal disliking of Santa Cruz&#x27;s government and person), the state was doomed due to its dysfunctionality between Santa Cruz&#x27;s government and Peruvian elements in Bolivia, and recommended that he accept the Ecuadorian mediation so that the war could end.
*: the government of José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia did not have establish relations with Andrés de Santa Cruz due to political circumstances.
* Spain: Spain did not have diplomatic relations with the confederation, because it had not recognized either Peru or Bolivia, largely due to the skirmishes caused by the wars of independence.
*: The Confederation was recognized by the U.S. on March 16, 1837, and James B. Thornton was appointed as chargé d&#x27;affaires to the new state. After the country&#x27;s dissolution in 1839, the U.S. did not recognize Bolivia as a separate state until 1848.
*: Manuel Oribe and Andrés de Santa Cruz never met due to political circumstances.

==Legacy==
In 2011, President Ollanta Humala of Peru proposed Bolivian president Evo Morales to reunite the countries in a confederation. The Cabinets of the two countries have held joint meetings.

<text>A boat race is a drinking game where teams, usually of equal numbers, race to finish their drinks in sequence. 
One theory on the name is that it is acronym for &quot;beer on a table&quot;, an alternative explanation may come from the Australian term for drinking a full beer in one continuous motion i.e. &quot;to skull&quot; or &quot;skulling&quot; and that term&#x27;s homonym in the single crewed rowing race &quot;sculling&quot; &amp; hence a boat race.

&quot;The Concise Macquarie Dictionary&quot;  has this entry for &quot;boatrace&quot; : Colloq: A competition between teams of beer drinkers to see which team can drink its beer the fastest; a drinking competition.

Common rules include those regulating the number and gender of drinkers, the vessels from which the liquid must be consumed and punishments for spilling. The game appeared in the 2006 Broken Lizard movie, &quot;Beerfest&quot;.

A race begins with all competitors placing their drinks on a mutual table. When a referee begins the race, the first drinker on each team is allowed to pick up their drink and begin drinking. Once a beverage is consumed, the drinker must invert the empty vessel on their head. This is done to ensure no cheating occurs. The next team mate cannot touch their own drink until this has occurred. Empty vessels must be kept on the competitors&#x27; heads until the race is over.

The game is a long-established tradition amongst many Australian amateur Rugby Union leagues. Players receiving points for their on field performance then become the participants for the boat race after, but may sub out for injury. The game is played in Germany as a team version of &quot;Bierjunge&quot; (). &quot;Bierjunge&quot; is a superior fraternity century-long traditional &quot;game&quot; from Germany. The size ranges from 0.25 to 1l (inferior fraternities obviously restrains to lower sizes, but extremes ranges up to a beer crate of about 20 beer bottles; 10l).

<doc id="1191344" wikidata="Q5123269" url="?curid=1191344" title="City Lights (1984 TV series)">
<text>City Lights is a Scottish television sitcom made by BBC Scotland and set in Glasgow. It ran from 1984 to 1991 (networked 1987 to 1991) and was written by Bob Black. Two stage shows, featuring the original cast, toured Scotland.

==Premise==
It starred Gerard Kelly as Willie Melvin, a bank-teller at the fictional Strathclyde Savings Bank (whose logo was very similar to the TSB), with dreams of becoming a novelist. Most of the plots revolved around his attempts to get his book, the autobiographical &quot;My Childhood Up A Close&quot;, published, however his efforts are continually thwarted by both his own incompetence and overall gullibility. He frequently gets led astray by best friend Chancer Andy Gray, who has a penchant for get-rich-quick schemes and various dodgy dealings that backfire, with Willie getting caught up in the resulting mess. None of this ingratiates Willie with his long suffering boss and bank manager McLelland (who is always looking for an excuse to fire him), and constantly exasperates his mother, played by Jan Wilson.

==Cast and characters==
He was held back in this by his own incompetence, the dodgy dealings of his best friend Chancer (Andy Gray), and the lack of support he gained from his mother (Jan Wilson), the bank&#x27;s manager Adam McLelland (Dave Anderson) and his obsequious fellow teller, Brian (Jonathan Watson). Other recurring characters included Chancer&#x27;s friend Tam (Iain McColl), Willie&#x27;s classmate from a creative writing class Irene (Elaine C. Smith) and his love interests, Janice (Elaine Collins, Series 1 and 2) and Fiona (Ann Bryson, Series 4 and 5).

Billy Connolly guest-starred in one episode.

<doc id="1191347" wikidata="Q641479" url="?curid=1191347" title="Khmelnytsky Uprising">
<text>The Khmelnytsky Uprising, also known as the Cossack–Polish War, or the Khmelnytsky insurrection, was a Cossack rebellion that took place between 1648 and 1657 in the eastern territories of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which led to the creation of a Cossack Hetmanate in Ukraine. Under the command of hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, the Zaporozhian Cossacks, allied with the Crimean Tatars and local Ukrainian peasantry, fought against Commonwealth&#x27;s forces. The insurgency was accompanied by mass atrocities committed by Cossacks against prisoners of war and the civilian population, especially Poles, Jews and Roman Catholic and Ruthenian Uniate clergy, as well as savage reprisals by loyalist Jeremi Wiśniowiecki, the &quot;voivode&quot; of Ruthenian descent (military governor) of the Ruthenian Voivodeship.

The uprising has a symbolic meaning in the history of Ukraine&#x27;s relationship with Poland and Russia. It ended the Polish Catholic &quot;szlachta&quot;′s domination over the Ukrainian Orthodox population; at the same time, it led to the eventual incorporation of eastern Ukraine into the Tsardom of Russia initiated by the 1654 Pereiaslav Agreement, whereby the Cossacks would swear allegiance to the tsar while retaining a wide degree of autonomy. The event triggered a period of political turbulence and infighting in the Hetmanate known as the Ruin. The success of the anti-Polish rebellion, along with internal conflicts in Poland and concurrent wars waged by the Poles against Russia and Sweden, ended the Polish Golden Age and caused a secular decline of Polish power during the period known as &quot;the Deluge&quot;.

In Jewish history, the Uprising is known for the atrocities against the Jews who, in their capacity as leaseholders (&quot;arendators&quot;), were seen by the peasants as their immediate oppressors and became the subject of antisemitic violence. The Jews consider this event &quot;the biggest national catastrophe since the destruction of Solomon&#x27;s Temple.&quot;

== Background ==

In 1569 the Union of Lublin granted the southern Lithuanian-controlled Ruthenian voivodeships of Volhynia, Podolia, Bracław and Kiev—to the Crown of Poland under the agreement forming the new Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (&quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot;). The Kingdom of Poland already controlled several Ruthenian lands which formed the voivodeships of Lviv and Belz. The combined lands would be formed into the Lesser Poland Province, Crown of the Kingdom of Poland.

Although the local nobility were formally granted full rights within the Rzeczpospolita by a 1572 royal decree, this was often ignored by city councils, and both the nobility and city burgers were under enormous pressure to convert to Roman Catholicism and use of the Polish language. This assimilation of Polish culture on the part of the Ruthenian nobility alienated them from the lower classes, and most especially to the Cossacks, who proved stubbornly resistant to Catholicism and Polonization. It was especially important in regard to powerful and traditionally influential great princely families of Ruthenian origins, among them Wiśniowiecki, Czartoryski, Ostrogski, Sanguszko, Zbaraski, Korecki and Zasławski, which acquired even more power and were able to gather more lands, creating huge latifundia. This &quot;szlachta&quot;, along with the actions of the upper-class Polish magnates, oppressed the lower-class Ruthenians, with the introduction of Counter-Reformation missionary practices and the use of Jewish arendators to manage their estates.

Local Orthodox traditions were also affected from the assumption of ecclesiastical power by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1448. The growing Russian state in the north sought to acquire the southern lands of Kievan Rus&#x27;, and with the fall of Constantinople it began this process by insisting that the Metropolitan of Moscow and All Rus′ was now the primate of the Russian Church.

The pressure of Catholic expansionism culminated with the Union of Brest in 1596, which attempted to retain the autonomy of the Eastern Orthodox churches in present-day Ukraine, Poland and Belarus by aligning themselves with the Bishop of Rome. Many Cossacks were also against the Uniate Church. While all of the people did not unite under one church, the concepts of autonomy were implanted into consciousness of the area and came out in force during the military campaign of Bohdan Khmelnytsky.

== Khmelnytsky&#x27;s role ==
Born to a noble family, Bohdan Khmelnytsky attended a Jesuit school, probably in Lviv. At the age of 22, he joined his father in the service of the Commonwealth, battling against the Ottoman Empire in the Moldavian Magnate Wars. After being held captive in Constantinople, he returned home as a Registered Cossack, settling in his &quot;khutor&quot; Subotiv with a wife and several children. He participated in campaigns for Grand Crown Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski, led delegations to King Władysław IV Vasa in Warsaw and generally was well respected within the Cossack ranks. The course of his life was altered, however, when Aleksander Koniecpolski, heir to hetman Koniecpolski&#x27;s magnate estate, attempted to seize Khmelnytsky&#x27;s land. In 1647 Chyhyryn deputy of starosta (head of the local royal administration) Daniel Czapliński openly started to harass Khmelnytsky on behalf of the younger Koniecpolski in an attempt to force him off the land. On two occasions raids were made to Subotiv, during which considerable property damage was done and his son Yurii was badly beaten, until Khmelnytsky moved his family to a relative&#x27;s house in Chyhyryn. He twice sought assistance from the king by traveling to Warsaw, only to find him either unwilling or powerless to confront the will of a magnate.

Having received no support from Polish officials, Khmelnytsky turned to his Cossack friends and subordinates. The case of a Cossack being unfairly treated by the Poles found a lot of support not only in his regiment but also throughout the Sich. All through the autumn of 1647, Khmelnytsky travelled from one regiment to another and had numerous consultations with different Cossack leaders throughout Ukraine. His activity raised the suspicions of Polish authorities already used to Cossack revolts, and he was promptly arrested. Polkovnyk (colonel) Mykhailo Krychevsky assisted Khmelnytsky in his escape, and with a group of supporters he headed for the Zaporozhian Sich.

The Cossacks were already on the brink of a new rebellion as plans for the new war with the Ottoman Empire advanced by the Polish king Władysław IV Vasa were cancelled by the Sejm. Cossacks were gearing up to resume their traditional and lucrative attacks on the Ottoman Empire (in the first quarter of the 17th century they raided the Black Sea shores almost annually), as they greatly resented being prevented from the pirate activities by the peace treaties between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire. Rumors about the emerging hostilities with &quot;the infidels&quot; were greeted with joy, and the news that there was to be no raiding after all was explosive in itself.

However, the Cossack rebellion might have fizzled in the same manner as the great rebellions of 1637–1638 but for the strategies of Khmelnytsky. Having taken part in the 1637 rebellion, he realized that Cossacks, while having an excellent infantry, could not hope to match the Polish cavalry, which was possibly the best in Europe at the time. However, combining Cossack infantry with Crimean Tatar cavalry could provide a balanced military force and give the Cossacks a chance to beat the Polish army.

== Beginning ==

On January 25, 1648, Khmelnytsky brought a contingent of 400–500 Cossacks to the Zaporizhian Sich and quickly killed the guards assigned by the Commonwealth to protect the entrance. Once at the Sich, his oratory and diplomatic skills struck a nerve with oppressed Ruthenians. As his men repelled an attempt by Commonwealth forces to retake the Sich, more recruits joined his cause. The Cossack Rada elected him Hetman by the end of the month. Khmelnytsky threw most of his resources into recruiting more fighters. He sent emissaries to Crimea, enjoining the Tatars to join him in a potential assault against their shared enemy, the Commonwealth.

By April 1648 word of an uprising had spread throughout the Commonwealth. Either because they underestimated the size of the uprising, or because they wanted to act quickly to prevent it from spreading, the Commonwealth&#x27;s Grand Crown Hetman Mikołaj Potocki and Field Crown Hetman Marcin Kalinowski sent 3,000 soldiers under the command of Potocki&#x27;s son, Stefan, towards Khmelnytsky, without waiting to gather additional forces from Prince Jeremi Wiśniowiecki. Khmelnytsky marshalled his forces and met his enemy at the Battle of Zhovti Vody, which saw a considerable number of defections on the field of battle by Registered Cossacks, who changed their allegiance from the Commonwealth to Khmelnytsky. The victory was quickly followed by rout of the Commonwealth&#x27;s armies at the Battle of Korsuń, which saw both the elder Potocki and Kalinowski captured and imprisoned by the Tatars.

In addition to the loss of significant forces and military leadership, the Polish state also lost King Władysław IV Vasa, who died in 1648, leaving the Crown of Poland leaderless and in disarray at a time of rebellion. The szlachta was on the run from its peasants, their palaces and estates in flames. All the while, Khmelnytsky&#x27;s army marched westward.

Khmelnytsky stopped his forces at Bila Tserkva and issued a list of demands to the Polish Crown, including raising the number of Registered Cossacks, returning churches taken from the Orthodox faithful and paying the Cossacks for wages, which had been withheld for five years.

News of the peasant uprisings now troubled a nobleman such as Khmelnytsky; however, after discussing information gathered across the country with his advisers, the Cossack leadership soon realized the potential for autonomy was there for the taking. Although Khmelnytsky&#x27;s personal resentment of the szlachta and the magnates influenced his transformation into a revolutionary, it was his ambition to become the ruler of a Ruthenian nation that expanded the uprising from a simple rebellion into a national movement. Khmelnytsky had his forces join a peasant revolt at the Battle of Pyliavtsi, striking another terrible blow to weakened and depleted Polish forces.

Khmelnytsky was persuaded not to lay siege to Lviv, in exchange for 200,000 red guldens, according to some sources, but Hrushevsky stated that Khmelnytsky did indeed lay siege to the town, for about two weeks. After obtaining the ransom, he moved to besiege Zamość, when he finally heard about the election of the new Polish King, John Casimir II, whom Khmelnytsky favored. According to Hrushevsky John Casimir II sent him a letter in which he informed the Cossack leader about his election and assured him that he would grant Cossacks and all of the Orthodox faith various privileges. He requested for Khmelnytsky to stop his campaign and await the royal delegation. Khmelnytsky answered that he would comply with his monarch&#x27;s request and then turned back. He made a triumphant entry into Kiev on Christmas Day in 1648, and he was hailed as &quot;the Moses, savior, redeemer, and liberator of the people from Polish captivity... the illustrious ruler of Rus&quot;.

In February 1649, during negotiations with a Polish delegation headed by nobleman Adam Kysil in Pereiaslav, Khmelnytsky declared that he was &quot;the sole autocrat of Rus&quot; and that he had &quot;enough power in Ukraine, Podolia, and Volhynia... in his land and principality stretching as far as Lviv, Chełm, and Halych&quot;. It became clear to the Polish envoys that Khmelnytsky had positioned himself no longer as simply a leader of the Zaporozhian Cossacks but as that of an independent state and stated his claims to the heritage of the Rus&#x27;.

A Vilnius panegyric in Khmelnytsky&#x27;s honour (1650–1651) explained it: &quot;While in Poland it is King Jan II Casimir Vasa, in Rus it is Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky&quot;.

Following the Battles of Zbarazh and Zboriv, Khmelnytsky gained numerous privileges for the Cossacks under the Treaty of Zboriv. When hostilities resumed, however, his forces suffered a massive defeat in 1651 at the Battle of Berestechko, considered to be one of the largest land battles of the 17th century, and they were abandoned by their former allies, the Crimean Tatars. They were forced at Bila Tserkva to accept the Treaty of Bila Tserkva. A year later, in 1652, the Cossacks had their revenge at the Battle of Batih, where Khmelnytsky ordered Cossacks to kill all Polish prisoners and paid Tatars for possession of the prisoners, an event known as the Batih massacre.

However, the enormous casualties suffered by the Cossacks at Berestechko made the idea of creating an independent state impossible to implement. Khmelnytsky had to decide whether to stay under Polish–Lithuanian influence or ally with the Muscovites.

== Tatars&#x27; role ==

The Tatars of the Crimean Khanate, then a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, participated in the insurrection, seeing it as a source of captives to be sold. Slave raiding sent a large influx of captives to slave markets in Crimea at the time of the Uprising. Ottoman Jews collected funds to mount a concerted ransom effort to gain the freedom of their people.

== Aftermath ==

Within a few months almost all Polish nobles, officials and priests had been wiped out or driven from the lands of present-day Ukraine. The Commonwealth population losses in the uprising exceeded one million. In addition, Jews suffered substantial losses because they were the most numerous and accessible representatives of the &quot;szlachta&quot; regime.

The uprising began a period in Polish history known as The Deluge (which included the Swedish invasion of the Commonwealth during the Second Northern War of 1655–1660), that temporarily freed the Ukrainians from Polish domination but in a short time subjected them to Russian domination. Weakened by wars, in 1654 Khmelnytsky persuaded the Cossacks to ally with the Russian tsar in the Treaty of Pereyaslav, which led to the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667). When Poland–Lithuania and Russia signed the Truce of Vilna and agreed on an anti-Swedish alliance in 1657, Khmelnytsky&#x27;s Cossacks supported the invasion of the Commonwealth by Sweden&#x27;s Transylvanian allies instead. Although the Commonwealth tried to regain its influence over the Cossacks (note the Treaty of Hadiach of 1658), the new Cossack subjects became even more dominated by Russia. The Hetmanate entered a new political situation which was far different than in the Commonwealth, and the church was much more subordinate to the tsar there. Russia had a traditional practice of imprisoning as well as executing Orthodox officials, which was foreign to people from the Commonwealth. With the Commonwealth becoming increasingly weak, Cossacks became more and more integrated into the Russian Empire, with their autonomy and privileges eroded. The remnants of these privileges were gradually abolished in the aftermath of the Great Northern War (1700–1721), in which hetman Ivan Mazepa sided with Sweden. By the time that the last of the partitions of Poland ended the existence of the Commonwealth in 1795, many Cossacks had already left Ukraine to colonise the Kuban and, in process, were russified.

Sources vary as to when the uprising ended. Russian and some Polish sources give the end-date of the uprising as 1654, pointing to the Treaty of Pereyaslav as ending the war; Ukrainian sources give the date as Khmelnytsky&#x27;s death in 1657; and few Polish sources give the date as 1655 and the Battle of Jezierna or Jeziorna (November 1655). There is some overlap between the last phase of the uprising and the beginning of the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667), as Cossack and Russian forces became allied.

== Casualties ==

Estimates of the death tolls of the Khmelnytsky uprising vary, as do many others from the eras analyzed by historical demography. As better sources and methodology are becoming available, such estimates are subject to continuing revision. Population losses of the entire Commonwealth population in the years 1648–1667 (a period which includes the Uprising, but also the Polish-Russian War and the Swedish invasion) are estimated at 4 million (roughly a decrease from 11 to 12 million to 7–8 million).

=== Massacres ===

Before the Khmelnytsky uprising, magnates had sold and leased certain privileges to arendators, many of whom were Jewish, who earned money from the collections they made for the magnates by receiving a percentage of an estate&#x27;s revenue. By not supervising their estates directly, the magnates left it to the leaseholders and collectors to become objects of hatred to the oppressed and long-suffering peasants. Khmelnytsky told the people that the Poles had sold them as slaves &quot;into the hands of the accursed Jews.&quot; With this as their battle cry, Cossacks and the peasantry massacred numerous Jewish and Polish–Lithuanian townsfolk, as well as during the years 1648–1649. &quot;Yeven Mezulah,&quot; the contemporary 17th-century chronicle by Nathan ben Moses Hannover, an eyewitness, states:
Wherever they found the , royal officials or Jews, they [Cossacks] killed them all, sparing neither women nor children. They pillaged the estates of the Jews and nobles, burned churches and killed their priests, leaving nothing whole. It was a rare individual in those days who had not soaked his hands in blood ...

=== Jews ===


Most Jewish communities in the rebellious Hetmanate were devastated by the uprising and ensuing massacres, though occasionally a Jewish population was spared, notably after the capture of the town of Brody (the population of which was 70% Jewish). According to the book known as &quot;History of the Rus&quot;, Khmelnytsky&#x27;s rationale was largely mercantile and the Jews of Brody, which was a major trading centre, were judged to be useful &quot;for turnovers and profits&quot; and thus they were only required to pay &quot;moderate indemnities&quot; in kind. One estimate (1996) reports that 15,000–30,000 Jews were killed or taken captive, and that 300 Jewish communities were completely destroyed. A 2014 estimate puts the number of Jews that died during the national uprising of Ukrainians to 18,000–20,000 people between the years 1648–1649; of these, 3,000–6,000 Jews were killed by Cossacks in Nemirov in May 1648 and 1,500 in Tulczyn in July 1648.

In Jewish circles, this massacre became known as Gzeyres Takh Vetat, sometimes shortened to Takh Vetat (spelled in multiple ways in English. In ). This translates to &quot;the (evil) decrees of (years) 408 and 409&quot; referring to the years 5408 and 5409 on the Jewish calendar, which corresponds to the years 1648 and 1649 on the non-Jewish calendar.

Due to the widespread murders, Jewish elders at the Council of Vilna banned merrymaking by a decree on July 3, 1661: they set limitations on wedding celebrations, public drinking, fire dances, masquerades, and Jewish comic entertainers. Stories about massacre victims who had been buried alive, cut to pieces, or forced to kill one another spread throughout Europe and beyond. These stories filled many with despair, led others to identify Sabbatai Zevi as the Messiah, and contributed in later years to growing interest in Hasidism.

The accounts of contemporary Jewish chroniclers of the events tended to emphasize large casualty figures, but since the end of the 20th century they have been re-evaluated downwards. Early 20th-century estimates of Jewish deaths were based on the accounts of the Jewish chroniclers of the time, and tended to be high, ranging from 100,000 to 500,000 or more; in 1916 Simon Dubnow stated:
The losses inflicted on the Jews of Poland during the fatal decade 1648–1658 were appalling. In the reports of the chroniclers, the number of Jewish victims varies between one hundred thousand and five hundred thousand. But even if we accept the lower figure, the number of victims still remains colossal, even exceeding the catastrophes of the Crusades and the Black Death in Western Europe. Some seven hundred Jewish communities in Poland had suffered massacre and pillage. In the Ukrainian cities situated on the left banks of the Dnieper, the region populated by Cossacks ... the Jewish communities had disappeared almost completely. In the localities on the right shore of the Dnieper or in the Polish part of Ukraine as well as those of Volhynia and Podolia, wherever Cossacks had made their appearance, only about one tenth of the Jewish population survived.

From the 1960s to the 1980s historians still considered 100,000 a reasonable estimate of the Jews killed and, according to Edward Flannery, many considered it &quot;a minimum&quot;. Max Dimont in &quot;Jews, God, and History&quot;, first published in 1962, writes &quot;Perhaps as many as 100,000 Jews perished in the decade of this revolution.&quot; Edward Flannery, writing in &quot;The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism&quot;, first published in 1965, also gives figures of 100,000 to 500,000, stating &quot;Many historians consider the second figure exaggerated and the first a minimum.&quot; Martin Gilbert in his &quot;Jewish History Atlas&quot; published in 1976 states, &quot;Over 100,000 Jews were killed; many more were tortured or ill-treated, others fled ...&quot; Many other sources of the time give similar figures.

Although many modern sources still give estimates of Jews killed in the uprising at 100,000 or more, others put the numbers killed at between 40,000 and 100,000, and recent academic studies have argued fatalities were even lower. Modern historiographic methods, particularly from the realm of historical demography, became more widely adopted and tended to result in lower fatality numbers. Newer studies of the Jewish population of the affected areas of Ukraine in that period estimate it to be 50,000. According to Orest Subtelny:
Weinryb cites the calculations of indicating that about 50,000 Jews lived in the area where the uprising occurred. See B. Weinryb, &quot;The Hebrew Chronicles on Bohdan Khmelnytsky and the Cossack-Polish War&quot;, &quot;Harvard Ukrainian Studies&quot; 1 (1977): 153–77. While many of them were killed, Jewish losses did not reach the hair-raising figures that are often associated with the uprising. In the words of Weinryb (&quot;The Jews of Poland&quot;, 193–4), &quot;The fragmentary information of the period—and to a great extent information from subsequent years, including reports of recovery—clearly indicate that the catastrophe may have not been as great as has been assumed.&quot;

A 2003 study by Israeli demographer Shaul Stampfer of Hebrew University dedicated solely to the issue of Jewish casualties in the uprising concludes that 18,000–20,000 Jews died out of a total population of 40,000. He attributes many of these deaths to disease and famine. Paul Robert Magocsi states that Jewish chroniclers of the 17th century &quot;provide invariably inflated figures with respect to the loss of life among the Jewish population of Ukraine. The numbers range from 60,000–80,000 (Nathan Hannover) to 100,000 (Sabbatai Cohen), but that &quot;[t]he Israeli scholars Shmuel Ettinger and Bernard D. Weinryb speak instead of the &#x27;annihilation of tens of thousands of Jewish lives&#x27;, and the Ukrainian-American historian Jaroslaw Pelenski narrows the number of Jewish deaths to between 6,000 and 14,000&quot;. Orest Subtelny concludes:
Between 1648 and 1656, tens of thousands of Jews—given the lack of reliable data, it is impossible to establish more accurate figures—were killed by the rebels, and to this day the Khmelnytsky uprising is considered by Jews to be one of the most traumatic events in their history.

In the two decades following the uprising the Commonwealth suffered two more major wars (The Deluge and Russo-Polish War (1654–67); during that period total Jewish casualties are estimated at another 20,000 to 30,000.

=== Ukrainian population ===

While the Cossacks and peasants (known as &quot;pospolity&quot;) were in many cases the perpetrators of massacres of Polish szlachta members and their collaborators, they also suffered the horrendous loss of life resulting from Polish reprisals, Tatar raids, famine, plague and general destruction due to war.

At the initial stages of the uprising, armies of the magnate Jeremi Wiśniowiecki, on their retreat westward inflicted terrible retribution on the civilian population, leaving behind them a trail of burned towns and villages. In addition, Khmelnytsky&#x27;s Tatar allies often continued their raids against the civilian population, in spite of protests from the Cossacks. After the Cossacks&#x27; alliance with Tsardom of Russia was enacted, the Tatar raids became unrestrained; coupled with the onset of famine, they led to a virtual depopulation of whole areas of the country. The extent of the tragedy can be exemplified by a report of a Polish officer of the time, describing the devastation:
I estimate that the number of infants alone who were found dead along the roads and in the castles reached 10,000. I ordered them to be buried in the fields and one grave alone contained over 270 bodies... All the infants were less than a year old since the older ones were driven off into captivity. The surviving peasants wander about in groups, bewailing their misfortune.
== In popular culture ==

The rebellion had a major effect on Poland and Ukraine. &quot;With Fire and Sword&quot; is a historical fiction novel, set in the 17th century in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth during the Khmelnytsky Uprising.

&quot;With Fire and Sword&quot; is also a Polish historical drama film directed by Jerzy Hoffman. The film is based on the novel &quot;With Fire and Sword&quot;, the first part in Henryk Sienkiewicz&#x27;s The Trilogy.

<text>The Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic (TDFR; 22 April – 28 May 1918) was a short-lived state in the Caucasus that included most of the territory of the present-day Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, as well as parts of Russia and Turkey. The state lasted only for a month before Georgia declared independence, followed shortly after by Armenia and Azerbaijan.

The region that formed the TDFR had been part of the Russian Empire. As the empire dissolved during the 1917 February Revolution and a provisional government took over, a similar body, called the Special Transcaucasian Committee (Ozakom), did the same in the Caucasus. After the October Revolution and rise of the Bolsheviks in Russia, the Transcaucasian Commissariat replaced the Ozakom. In March 1918, as the First World War continued, the Commissariat initiated peace talks with the Ottoman Empire, which had invaded the region, but the talks broke down quickly as the Ottomans refused to accept the authority of the Commissariat. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which ended Russia&#x27;s involvement in the war, conceded parts of the Transcaucasus to the Ottoman Empire, which pursued its invasion to take control of the territory. Faced with this imminent threat, on 22 April 1918 the Commissariat dissolved itself and established the TDFR as an independent state. A legislature, the Seim, was formed to direct negotiations with the Ottoman Empire, which had immediately recognized the state.

Diverging goals of the three major groups (Armenians, Azerbaijanis, and Georgians) quickly jeopardized the TDFR&#x27;s existence. Peace talks again broke down and, facing a renewed Ottoman offensive in May 1918, Georgian delegates in the Seim announced that the TDFR was unable to continue, and declared the Democratic Republic of Georgia independent on 26 May. With the Georgians no longer part of the TDFR, the Republic of Armenia and Azerbaijan Democratic Republic each declared themselves independent on 28 May, ending the federation. Owing to its short existence, the TDFR has been largely ignored in the national historiographies of the region and has been given consideration only as the first stage towards independent states.

==History==
===Background===
Most of the South Caucasus had been absorbed by the Russian Empire in the first half of the nineteenth century. A Caucasian Viceroyalty had originally been established in 1801 to allow for direct Russian rule, and over the next several decades local autonomy was reduced and Russian control was further consolidated, the Viceroyalty gaining greater power in 1845. Tiflis (now Tbilisi), which had been the capital of the Georgian Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti, became the seat of the viceroy and the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the region. The South Caucasus was overwhelmingly rural: aside from Tiflis the only other city of significance was Baku, which grew in the late nineteenth century as the region began exporting oil and became a major economic hub. Ethnically the region was highly diverse. The three major local groups were Armenians, Azerbaijanis, and Georgians; Russians had also established themselves after the Russian Empire absorbed the area.

With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the Caucasus became a major theatre, the Russian and Ottoman Empires fighting each other in the region. The Russians won several battles and penetrated deep into Ottoman territory. However, they were concerned that the local population, who were mostly Muslims, would continue to follow the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed V and disrupt the Russian forces, as he was also the caliph, the spiritual leader of Islam. Both sides also wanted to use the Armenian population, who lived across the border, to their advantage and foment uprisings. After military defeats, the Ottoman government turned against the Armenians, and initiated a genocide by 1915, in which around 1 million Armenians were killed.

The 1917 February Revolution saw the demise of the Russian Empire and the establishment of a provisional government in Russia. The Viceroy of the Caucasus, Grand Duke Nicholas, initially expressed his support for the new government, yet he was forced to resign his post as imperial power eroded. The provisional government created a new temporary authority, the Special Transcaucasian Committee (known by its Russian abbreviation, Ozakom) on . It was composed of Caucasian representatives to the Duma (Russian legislature) and other local leaders, it was meant to serve as a &quot;collective viceroyalty&quot;, and had representatives from the ethnic groups of the region. Much like in Petrograd, a dual power system was established, the Ozakom competing with soviets. With little support from the government in Petrograd, the Ozakom had trouble establishing its authority over the soviets, most prominently the Tiflis Soviet.

===Transcaucasian Commissariat===
News of the October Revolution, which brought the Bolsheviks to power in Petrograd on , reached the Caucasus the following day. The Tiflis Soviet met and declared their opposition to the Bolsheviks. Three days later the idea of an autonomous local government was first expressed by Noe Jordania, a Georgian Menshevik, who argued that the Bolshevik seizure of power was illegal and that the Caucasus should not follow their directives, and wait until order was restored. A further meeting of representatives from the Tiflis Soviet, the Ozakom, and other groups on decided to end the Ozakom and replace it with a new body, the Transcaucasian Commissariat, which would not be subservient to the Bolsheviks. Composed of representatives from the four major ethnic groups in the region (Armenians, Azerbaijanis, Georgians, and Russians) it replaced the Ozakom as the government of the South Caucasus, and was set to serve in that role until the Russian Constituent Assembly could meet in January 1918. Evgeni Gegechkori, a Georgian, was named the president and Commissar of External Affairs of the Commissariat. The other commissariats were split between Armenians, Azerbaijanis, Georgians, and Russians. Formed with the express purpose of being a caretaker government, the Commissariat was not able to govern strongly: it was dependent on national councils, formed around the same time and based on ethnic lines, for military support and was effectively powerless to enforce any laws it passed.

With Russian and Ottoman forces still nominally engaged in the region, a temporary ceasefire, the Armistice of Erzincan, was signed on . With the fighting paused, on , Ottoman diplomats invited the Commissariat to join the peace talks in Brest-Litovsk, where the Bolsheviks were negotiating an end to the war with the Central Powers. As the Commissariat did not want to act independently of Russia, they did not answer the invitation and thus did not participate in the peace talks there. Two days later, on , the Constituent Assembly had its first and only meeting, broken up by the Bolsheviks, thereby effectively consolidating their power in Russia. This confirmed for the Commissariat that they would not be able to work with the Bolsheviks in any serious capacity, and so they began to form a more formal government. The ceasefire between the Ottoman Empire and the Commissariat lasted until , when the Ottoman army launched a new offensive into the Caucasus, claiming it was to retaliate against sporadic attacks by Armenian militias on the Muslim population in occupied Ottoman territory. With Russian forces largely withdrawn from the front, the Commissariat realized that they would not be able to resist a full-scale advance by the Ottoman forces, and so on 23 February agreed to start a new round of peace talks.

===Seim===

The idea to establish a Transcaucasian legislative body had been discussed since November 1917, though it had not been acted on at that time. With the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly in January, it became apparent to the leaders of the Commissariat that ties with Russia had been all but severed. With no desire to follow the lead of the Bolsheviks, the Commissariat agreed to establish their own legislative body so that the Transcaucasus could have a legitimate government and negotiate with the Ottoman Empire more properly. Thus on 23 February they established the &quot;Seim&quot; (&quot;legislature&quot;) in Tiflis.

No election was held for the deputies; instead, the results for the Constituent Assembly election were used, the electoral threshold being lowered to one-third of that used for the Constituent Assembly to allow more members to join, which allowed smaller parties to be represented. Nikolai Chkheidze, a Georgian Menshevik, was named the chairman. Ultimately the Seim comprised ten different parties. Three dominated, each representing one major ethnic group: the Georgian Mensheviks and Azerbaijani Musavat party each had 30 members, and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutyun) had 27 members. The Bolsheviks boycotted the Seim, asserting that the only legitimate government for Russia (including Transcaucasia) was the Bolshevik-controlled Council of People&#x27;s Commissars (known by its Russian acronym, Sovnarkom).

From the outset, the Seim faced challenges to its authority. With a diverse ethnic and political makeup and no clear status to its authority, there was conflict both within its chambers and outside. It was largely dependent on national councils, represented by the three main ethnic groups, and was unable to proceed without their consent. Thus the Ottoman offer to renew peace talks and a willingness to meet in Tiflis, where the Seim was based, was refused, as the Seim felt it would only showcase the internal disagreements taking place. Instead they agreed to travel to Trabzon, in northeast Anatolia.

===Trabzon peace conference===
A delegation representing the Seim was scheduled to depart for Trabzon on 2 March, but that day it was announced that the peace talks at Brest-Litovsk had concluded, and the Russians would sign a peace treaty. Contained within the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was the agreement that the Russians would give up large swaths of land to the Ottoman Empire, including major regions in the Transcaucasus: the territories of Ardahan, Batum Oblast, and Kars Oblast, all of which had been annexed by Russia after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. With this sudden development, the delegation postponed leaving as they had to reconsider their stance. As the Transcaucasus had not been part of the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, they sent messages to several governments around the world, stating as they were not a party in the peace talks they would not honor the treaty and would not evacuate the territories. The delegation would finally depart on 7 March and arrive at Trabzon the next day. On arrival, the delegation, comprising ten delegates and another fifty guards, was held up as the guards were asked to disarm. The unusually large delegation was made up of individuals selected to represent the diverse ethnic groups and political factions that composed the Seim; on their arrival an Ottoman official quipped that &quot;[i]f this was the entire population of Transcaucasia, it was indeed very small; if, however, it was only a delegation, it was much too large.&quot;

While the delegates waited for the conference in Trabzon to begin, the head of the Ottoman Third Army, Vehib Pasha, sent a request on 10 March to , a former Russian general who had begun to follow orders from the Commissariat, to evacuate the Ardahan, Batum, and Kars areas, as stipulated by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Vehib also told Ilia Odishelidze, who was also taking orders from the Commissariat, that in light of attacks by Armenian forces on the population near Erzurum, Ottoman forces would have to advance to keep the peace, warning that any hostile reply would be met with force. These requests were replied to directly by Chkheidze as Chairman of the Seim, who noted that the Transcaucasus had sent a delegation to Trabzon to negotiate peace, and that as the Seim no longer recognized Russian authority they would not acknowledge the provisions of Brest-Litovsk. On 11 March the Ottoman army began their attack on Erzurum and with little hope for success, the mostly Armenian defenders evacuated less than twenty-four hours later.

The Trabzon Peace Conference opened on 14 March. At the first session, the lead Ottoman delegate, Rauf Bey, asked the Transcaucasian delegation whom they represented. Akaki Chkhenkeli, the head of the Transcaucasian delegation, was unable to give a proper response as it was not clear to him or his associates who they represented. When the question was repeated two days later, Rauf also asked Chkhenkeli to clarify the make-up of their state, to determine if it qualified as one under international law. Chkhenkeli clarified that since the October Revolution, the central authority had ceased to exist in Transcaucasia. An independent government had been formed and that since it had acted like a state when it discussed the invitation to the Brest-Litovsk peace talks, it qualified as a sovereign state, even if independence had not been explicitly proclaimed. Rauf refuted the argument, asserting that the Sovnarkom had authority over all of Russia and even though Ottoman representatives had sent messages to the Commissariat to join the talks at Brest-Litovsk, that did not confer recognition. Finally, Rauf stated that the Ottoman delegation was at Trabzon only to resolve some economic and commercial issues that had not been settled at Brest-Litovsk. Chkhenkeli and his fellow delegates had little option but to request a short recess so they could message the Seim and determine how to proceed.

==Formation==
===Renewed Ottoman invasion===
During the recess at Trabzon, the Ottoman forces continued their advance into the Transcaucasian territory, crossing the 1914 border with the Russian Empire by the end of March. The Seim debated the best course of action; a majority of the delegates favored a political solution. On 20 March the Ottoman delegates offered that the Seim could only return to negotiations if they declared independence, thereby confirming that Transcaucasus was no longer part of Russia. The idea of independence had arisen before, the Georgians having discussed it in depth in preceding years; it was decided against as the Georgian leadership felt the Russians would not approve it and the Menshevik political ideology leaned away from nationalism.

By 5 April, Chkhenkeli accepted the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk as a basis for further negotiations and urged the Transcaucasian Seim to accept this position. He initially asked that Batum remain part of the Transcaucasus, arguing that as the major port in the region it was an economic necessity. The Ottomans refused the proposal, making it clear that they would only accept the terms of Brest-Litovsk, to which Chkhenkeli conceded. Acting on his own accord, on 9 April Chkhenkeli agreed to negotiate further based on the terms set out, though requested that representatives from the other Central Powers participate in the talks. Rauf replied that such a request could only be considered if the Transcaucasus were an independent state.

Tired of fruitless negotiations and realizing that the contested territories could be occupied by force, Ottoman officials issued an ultimatum to the defenders in Batum, ordering it evacuated by 13 April. While Chkhenkeli was receptive to the loss of Batum, recognizing its importance but accepting that it was part of the terms at Brest-Litovsk, the Georgian members of the Seim were adamant about keeping the city, Gegechkori noting that it could be defended quite easily. Irakli Tsereteli, a Georgian Menshevik, gave an impassioned speech calling for the defense of the city and asked the Seim to denounce the Brest-Litovsk treaty altogether. Armenian delegates had long been in support of fighting the Ottoman Empire, a response to the 1915 genocide and continued attacks on Armenian civilians, while only the Azerbaijanis resisted going to war, as they were reluctant to fight fellow Muslims. Azerbaijanis were outvoted and on 14 April the Seim declared war on the Ottoman Empire. Immediately after the voting finished, Tsereteli and Jordania left to join the defense of Batum, while the delegation in Trabzon was ordered to return to Tiflis immediately. Some Azerbaijani delegates defied this order and remained there, seeking potential negotiation, though nothing came of this.

===Establishment===
The military superiority of the Ottoman forces became apparent right away. They occupied Batum on 14 April, with little resistance. They also attacked Kars, but a force of 3,000 Armenian soldiers, with artillery support, held the city until it was evacuated on 25 April. Having captured most of their claimed territory and unwilling to lose more soldiers, the Ottoman delegates offered another truce on 22 April and waited for the Transcaucasians to reply.

In the face of Ottoman military superiority, the Georgian National Council decided that the only option was for Transcaucasia to declare itself an independent state. The idea was debated in the Seim on 22 April, the Georgians leading the debate, noting that the Ottoman representatives had agreed to resume peace talks provided that the Transcaucasus would meet them as an independent state. The choice to move forward was not unanimous initially: the mostly Armenian Dashnaks felt that the best option at the time was to stop the Ottoman military&#x27;s advance, though they were reluctant to give up so much territory, while the Musavats, who represented Azerbaijani interests, were still hesitant to fight fellow Muslims, but conceded that independence was the only way to ensure the region would not be divided by foreign states. The only major opposition came from the Socialist Revolutionary Party, when one of their representatives, , argued that the people of Transcaucasia did not support such an action. He also argued that while the Musavats claimed their driving force was &quot;conscience not fear&quot;, it was in reality &quot;fear and not conscience&quot;. He concluded that they would all regret this act.

When the debate finished, Davit Oniashvili, an ethnic Georgian Menshevik, proposed the motion for the Seim &quot;to proclaim Transcaucasia an independent democratic federative republic&quot;. Some deputies left the chamber as they did not want to vote in favor of the matter, so the motion passed with few dissents. The new republic, the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic (TDFR), immediately sent a message to Vehib Pasha announcing this development and expressing their will to accept the provisions of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, and surrendered Kars to the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Empire recognized the TDFR on 28 April. Despite this recognition, the Ottomans continued their advance into Transcaucasian territory and shortly after occupied both Erzerum and Kars.

===Independence===

Upon its establishment, the TDFR had no cabinet to lead the new government. The Commissariat had been dissolved when independence was declared, and Gegechkori refused to continue in a leadership position, feeling he had lost support to do so. Though it had been agreed during the Seim debates that Chkhenkeli would take up the role of prime minister, he refused to serve in a caretaker position until a new cabinet could be formed. The cabinet was not finalized until 26 April, so for three days the TDFR effectively had no executive. With pressing needs to attend to, Chkhenkeli took up his role as prime minister. He ordered the Armenian forces to cease fighting and also requested Vehib to meet him for peace negotiations in Batum, the location deliberately chosen so that he could travel to Tiflis if necessary, something that was not possible from Trabzon.

Upset at Chkhenkeli&#x27;s actions over the previous days, namely the evacuation of Kars, the Dashnaks initially refused to join the cabinet. They negotiated with the Mensheviks but relented when the latter warned they would only support Chkhenkeli or Hovhannes Kajaznuni, an Armenian. The Mensheviks knew that electing Kajaznuni would give the perception that the TDFR intended to keep fighting to defend Armenian territory, and it was feared that this would see the Azerbaijanis leave the federation and make it easier for Ottoman forces to threaten the rest of Armenia, a proposition the Dashnaks were not eager to endorse. The cabinet was confirmed by the Seim on 26 April, consisting of thirteen members. Chkhenkeli, aside from being prime minister, assumed foreign minister&#x27;s office, the remaining positions being split among Armenians (four), Azerbaijanis (five), and Georgians (three). Azerbaijanis and Georgians took up the leading positions in the cabinet, an act that historian Firuz Kazemzadeh said revealed as &quot;the relationship of forces in Transcaucasia&quot; at the time. In his inaugural address to the Seim, Chkhenkeli announced that he would work to ensure all citizens had equality and to establish borders for the TDFR that were based on agreement with their neighbors. He further laid out a platform with five main points: write a constitution; delineate borders; end the war; combat counter-revolution and anarchy; and land reform.

A new peace conference was convened at Batum on 11 May, with both Chkhenkeli and Vehib in attendance. Before the conference, Chkhenkeli repeated his request to have the other Central Powers present, which the Ottoman delegates ignored. Both sides invited observers: the TDFR brought a small German contingent, led by General Otto von Lossow, while the Ottoman delegates had representatives from the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus, an unrecognized state they were backing. Chkhenkeli wished to proceed on the basis of the Brest-Litovsk terms, but this was refused by the Ottoman delegation, led by Halil Bey, the Ottoman minister of justice. Halil Bey argued that as the two states were in conflict, the Ottoman would no longer recognize Brest-Litovsk and instead presented Chkhenkeli with a duly prepared draft treaty.

The treaty contained twelve articles which called for the Ottoman Empire to be ceded not only the &quot;oblasts&quot; of Kars and Batum, but also the &quot;uezds&quot; of Akhalkalaki, Akhaltsikhe, Surmalu, and large parts of the Alexandropol, Erivan, and Etchmiadzin, mainly along the course of the Kars–Julfa railway. The territory named would effectively bring all of Armenia into the Ottoman Empire. The railway was desired as the Ottoman forces sought a fast route to North Persia, where they were fighting the British forces in the Persian Campaign, though historian Richard G. Hovannisian has suggested that the real reason was to allow them a means to reach Baku and access the oil production around the city.

Giving the TDFR several days to consider their options, the Ottoman forces resumed their military advances into Armenia on 21 May. They engaged the Armenians at the battles of Bash Abaran, Sardarapat and Kara Killisse, but could not defeat the Armenians decisively. As a result, their advance slowed down, and eventually, they were forced to retreat.

==Dissolution==
===German intervention===
By 22 May the Ottoman forces, split into two groups, were from Erevan and from Tiflis. With this threat, the TDFR reached out to Von Lossow and the Germans in hopes of securing their help and protection. Von Lossow had previously offered to mediate between the TDFR and the Ottoman Empire on 19 May, though this had not led to any progress. While the German and Ottoman Empires were nominally allies, the relationship had deteriorated in the preceding months, as the German public had not approved of reports that the Ottoman government was massacring Christians, nor did the German government appreciate the Ottoman army&#x27;s advance into territory not agreed to at Brest-Litovsk. The Germans also had their own strategic interests in the Caucasus: they wanted both a potential path to attack British India and access to raw materials in the region, both of which could be blocked by the Ottomans.

With the Armenians fighting the Ottoman forces and the Azerbaijanis having their own issues with Bolsheviks controlling Baku, the Georgians concluded that they had no future in the TDFR. On 14 May Jordania went to Batum to request German assistance to help secure Georgian independence. He returned to Tiflis on 21 May and expressed confidence that Georgia could become independent. The Armenian, Azerbaijani, and Georgian representatives from the Seim met on 21 May to discuss the future of the TDFR and agreed that it was not likely to last much longer. The next day the Georgians met alone and resolved that independence was their only logical choice. Jordania and Zurab Avalishvili drafted a declaration of independence on 22 May, before Jordania left again for Batum to meet Von Lossow. On 24 May Von Lossow replied that he was only authorized to work with the TDFR as a whole; as it was becoming apparent that it would not last long, he would have to leave Trabzon and consult with his government on how to proceed further.

===Break-up===

On 26 May Tsereteli gave two speeches in the Seim. In the first, he explained that the TDFR was unable to continue as there was a lack of unity among the people and that ethnic strife led to a division of action in regards to the Ottoman invasion. In his second speech, Tsereteli blamed the Azerbaijanis for failing to support the defense of the TDFR and declared that as the federation had failed it was time for Georgia to proclaim itself independent. At 15:00 the motion was passed: &quot;Because on the questions of war and peace there arose basic differences among the peoples who had created the Transcaucasian Republic, and because it became impossible to establish one authoritative order speaking in the name of all Transcaucasia, the Seim certifies the fact of the dissolution of Transcaucasia and lays down its powers.&quot; Most delegates left the chamber, leaving only the Georgians, who were shortly joined by members of the Georgian National Council. Jordania then read the Georgian declaration of independence and proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Georgia. This was followed two days later with an Armenian declaration of independence, followed quickly by Azerbaijan doing the same, creating the Republic of Armenia and Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, respectively. All three newly independent states signed a peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire on 4 June, effectively ending that conflict. Armenia then later engaged in brief wars with both Azerbaijan (1918–1920) and Georgia (December 1918) to determine its final borders.

==Legacy==
As the TDFR lasted only a month, it has had a limited legacy, and the historical scholarship on the topic is limited. Historians Adrian Brisku and Timothy K. Blauvelt have noted that it &quot;seemed both to the actors at the time and to later scholars of the region to be unique, contingent, and certainly unrepeatable.&quot; Stephen F. Jones stated it was &quot;the first and last attempt at an independent Transcaucasian union&quot;, while Hovannisian noted that the actions of the TDFR during its short existence demonstrated that it &quot;was not independent, democratic, federative, or a republic&quot;.

Under Bolshevik rule, the three successor states would be forcibly reunited within the Soviet Union as the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. This state lasted from 1922 to 1936 before being broken up again into three union republics: the Armenian, Azerbaijani, and Georgian Soviet Socialist Republics. Within the modern states of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, the TDFR is largely ignored in their respective national historiography, given consideration only as the first stage towards their own independent states.

<text>John Taylor, (c. 1822 – 25 February 1857) was a sailor in the Royal Navy and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Royal Navy==
Taylor was about 33 years old, and a captain of the forecastle in the Royal Navy, serving in the Naval Brigade, during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC).

On 18 June 1855 on the Crimean Peninsula, immediately after the assault on Sebastopol, a soldier of the 57th Regiment, who had been wounded in both legs, was observed sitting up and calling for help. At once the second-in-command, Henry James Raby, of the scaling party, another seaman, Henry Curtis, and Captain of the Forecastle Taylor left the shelter of their battery works and ran forward a distance of 70 yards, across open ground, through heavy gunfire and succeeded in carrying the wounded man to safety.

==Later life and legacy==
John Taylor&#x27;s Cross is held in the Sheesh Mahal Collection in Patiala, India. The group formed part of the Maharaja Bhupendra Singh&#x27;s collection, which was bequeathed to the Museum on the death of the Maharajah&#x27;s son in 1947, and consists of the VC, Conspicuous Gallantry Medal, China War Medal 1842, India General Service Medal 1854 clasp Pegu, Crimea Medal with clasps Inkermann and Sebastopol, Legion of Honour and Turkish Crimea Medal.

Taylor was buried in Woolwich cemetery in southeast London.

<doc id="1191363" wikidata="Q1142248" url="?curid=1191363" title="Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations">
<text>The Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations was a World&#x27;s Fair held in 1853 in what is now Bryant Park in New York City, in the wake of the highly successful 1851 Great Exhibition in London. It aimed to showcase the new industrial achievements of the world and also to demonstrate the nationalistic pride of a relatively young nation and all that she stood for. Jacob Aaron Westervelt, at that time Mayor of New York, was the President of the exhibition-committee. The general superintendent was Admiral Du Pont.

Opening on July 14, 1853 with newly sworn President Franklin Pierce in attendance, the fair was seen by over 1.1 million visitors before it closed on November 14, 1854. The fair featured its own glass and iron exhibition building – the New York Crystal Palace – directly inspired by London&#x27;s. The Palace was destroyed by fire on October 5, 1858.

Walt Whitman, an American poet, wrote &quot;The Song of the Exposition&quot;:

... a Palace,&lt;br&gt;
Lofter, fairer, ampler than any yet,&lt;br&gt;
Earth&#x27;s modern wonder, History&#x27;s Seven out stripping,&lt;br&gt;
High rising tier on tier, with glass and iron facades,&lt;br&gt;
Gladdening the sun and sky - enhued in the cheerfulest hues,&lt;br&gt;
Bronze, lilac, robin&#x27;s-egg, marine and crimson&lt;br&gt;
Over whose golden roof shall flaunt, beneath thy banner, Freedom.
Adjoining the Crystal Palace was the Latting Observatory, a wooden tower high, which allowed visitors to see into Queens, Staten Island and New Jersey. The tower, taller than the spire of Trinity Church at , was the tallest structure in New York City from the time it was constructed in 1853 until it burnt down on August 30, 1856.

The exhibition was not financially successful. After a delayed opening due to construction delays, the fair lost $100,000 in its first year. Showman P. T. Barnum was brought in to turn things around, but when the fair closed in November 1854, total losses amounted to $340,000.

Today, the expo is also remembered as the place where Elisha Otis demonstrated an elevator equipped with a device called a safety, which would kick in if the hoisting rope broke. This addressed a major public concern regarding the safety of elevators. Three years later, Otis installed the first passenger elevator in the United States in a New York City store.

==Notable exhibits==
* Elisha Otis demonstrated an elevator equipped with a device called a safety brake, which revolutionized the industry completely
* David Alter displayed a method to manufacture and purify bromine from salt wells, highly useful in the iron industry
* The world&#x27;s first pedal quadracycle was shown

<text>Pasquino or Pasquin (; Latin: &quot;Pasquinus, Pasquillus&quot;) is the name used by Romans since the early modern period to describe a battered Hellenistic-style statue perhaps dating to the third century BC, which was unearthed in the Parione district of Rome in the fifteenth century. It is located in a piazza of the same name on the northwest corner of the Palazzo Braschi (Museo di Roma); near the site where it was unearthed.

The statue is known as the first of the talking statues of Rome, because of the tradition of attaching anonymous criticisms to its base. The satirical literary form pasquinade (or &quot;pasquil&quot;) takes its name from this tradition.

The actual subject of the sculpture is &quot;Menelaus supporting the body of Patroclus&quot;, and the subject, or the composition applied to other figures as in the Sperlonga sculptures, occurs a number of times in classical sculpture, where it is now known as a &quot;Pasquino group&quot;. The actual identification of the sculptural subject was made in the eighteenth century by the antiquarian Ennio Quirino Visconti, who identified it as the torso of Menelaus supporting the dying Patroclus; the more famous of two Medici versions of this is in the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence, Italy. The &quot;Pasquino&quot; is more recently characterized as a Hellenistic sculpture of the third century BC, or a Roman copy.

==History==

The statue&#x27;s fame dates to the early sixteenth century, when Cardinal Oliviero Carafa draped the marble torso of the statue in a toga and decorated it with Latin epigrams on the occasion of the Feast of Saint Mark.

The Cardinal&#x27;s actions led to a custom of criticizing the pope or his government by the writing of satirical poems in broad Roman dialect—called &quot;pasquinades&quot;, from the Italian &quot;pasquinate&quot;—and attaching them to the Pasquino. Thus Pasquino became the first &quot;talking statue&quot; of Rome. He spoke out about the people&#x27;s dissatisfaction, denounced injustice, and assaulted misgovernment by members of the Church. From this tradition are derived the English-language terms pasquinade and pasquil, which refer to an anonymous lampoon in verse or prose.

==Etymological origins==

The origin of the name, &quot;Pasquino&quot;, remains obscure. By the mid-sixteenth century it was reported that the name &quot;Pasquino&quot; derived from a nearby tailor who was renowned for his wit and intellect; speculation had it that his legacy was carried on through the statue, in &quot;the honor and everlasting remembrance of the poor tailor&quot;.

==Tradition of wit==
Before long, other statues appeared on the scene, forming a kind of public salon or academy, the &quot;Congress of the Wits&quot; (&quot;Congresso degli Arguti&quot;), with Pasquino always the leader, and the sculptures that Romans called Marphurius, Abbot Luigi, Il Facchino, Madama Lucrezia, and Il Babbuino as his outspoken colleagues. The &quot;cartelli&quot; (translated as posters, placards, boards; probably the equivalent of pamphlet) on which the epigrams were written were quickly passed around, and copies were made, too numerous to suppress. These poems were collected and published annually by the Roman printer Giacomo Mazzocchi as early as 1509, as &quot;Carmina apposita Pasquino&quot;, and became well known all over Europe.

The lampooning tradition was ancient among Romans. For a first-century versified lampoon, see Domus Aurea.

<doc id="1191378" wikidata="Q257052" url="?curid=1191378" title="Ringway, Manchester">
<text>Ringway is a civil parish on the southern border of Manchester, England. Historically in Cheshire, it is the only civil parish in the city of Manchester. The population at the 2011 census was 103. Ringway is home to Manchester Airport.

==History==
The name appears to come from the Old English (Anglo-Saxon) &quot;Hringhæg&quot; meaning &quot;circular or enclosing hedged enclosure&quot;.

Ringway Chapel is on Wilmslow Old Road near the south edge of Manchester Airport. 
*1173: First mention of Ullerwood Castle, which is now in Ringway parish. It is a shell keep; at that time it was owned by Hamon de Massey.
*1515: First mention of &#x27;Ringey Chapel&#x27;, a chapel of ease in Bowdon parish.
* English Civil War (1642–1651): Dissenters started using the Ringway Chapel.
*1721 or shortly before: John Crewe of Crewe Hall inherited the Lordship of Ringway.
*1721 Dissenters were ejected from the chapel, and moved to a barn, and in 1723 re-established themselves at Hale.
*About 1736: Ringway Chapel was demolished, and replaced by a new plain red brick building. According to the St Wilfrid&#x27;s Mobberley Christening Records Abraham Johnson was baptised on 24 October 1736 &quot;the first Sunday after it was finished by me, Faithful Meaykin (curate of St Wilfrid&#x27;s) who preached the first sermon&quot;
*1741: The chapel&#x27;s bell was recast or replaced.
*1751: Record of baptisms began.
*1821: Record of burials began: previous burials were at Bowdon.
*1863: Ringway parish (including all or part of what is now Halebarns) was split off Bowdon parish. Ringway chapel became Ringway parish&#x27;s parish church dedicated to All Saints.
*1894: Ringway church was demolished and rebuilt.
*20 April 1895: Ringway church was consecrated by the Bishop of Chester.
*November 1967: A new parish church (dedicated to All Saints) was consecrated in Ringway Parish&#x27;s Halebarns end, because urban spread from Altrincham into Halebarns, and loss of farms near Ringway due to road and airport extensions, had changed the centre of gravity of the parish.
*December 1970: Ringway Church declared redundant by an Order in Council and closed. It became a storeroom.
*1974: Part of Ringway ecclesiastical parish was brought into the city of Manchester as Ringway civil parish, to bring most of the terminal and hangar areas of Manchester Airport (previously known as Manchester (Ringway) Airport, built during 1935/38, and the location between 1940 and 1957 of RAF Ringway) within the city boundaries. The parish had previously been in the Bucklow Rural District of Cheshire.
*1997: Ringway Chapel was restored and converted for use as a design studio.
*2001: According to a census Ringway civil parish had a population of 106.
*2011: Ringway chapel started to be used by the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

==Governance==
Ringway Parish Council had nominally consisted of eight Councillors, but none had been elected and the parish council was not performing its statutory obligations. In a 2009 review of local governance arrangements in Manchester 35 (40%) of the 88 electors in the parish (100% of respondents) indicated the desire to retain the parish council. From 2010 the number of parish Councillors has been reduced to five, and the elections scheduled for 2011 were brought forward. Of the five Councillors nominally in the role since 2011, only four have lived in the parish. A further review of local arrangements is planned by Manchester City Council. The area is within the Manchester City Council Ward of Woodhouse Park (Wythenshawe); so does have effective representation from the three Ward (City) Councillors.

==Demography==
At the 2001 UK census, Ringway civil parish had a total population of 106, of which 50 were female and 56 male. The average household size was 2.59. Of those aged 16–74 in Ringway, 38 (= 43.7%) had no academic qualifications, significantly higher than the 28.9% for all of England. According to the census, none were unemployed and 28 were economically inactive. Of the residents of Ringway parish, 16 were under the age of 16 and 3 were aged 75 and over; the mean age of the people of Ringway was 37.47. 84 of them described their health as &#x27;good&#x27;.

<doc id="1191380" wikidata="Q839825" url="?curid=1191380" title="Wilde (film)">
<text>Wilde is a 1997 British biographical romantic drama film directed by Brian Gilbert. The screenplay, written by Julian Mitchell, is based on Richard Ellmann&#x27;s 1987 biography of Oscar Wilde. It stars Stephen Fry in the title role, with Jude Law, Vanessa Redgrave, Jennifer Ehle, Gemma Jones, Judy Parfitt, Michael Sheen, Zoë Wanamaker, and Tom Wilkinson in supporting roles.

The film premiered at the 54th Venice International Film Festival on 1 September 1997, and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 17 October 1997, by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. It was praised for the performances of the cast, particularly that of Fry, who received critical acclaim and a Best Actor nomination at the 56th Golden Globe Awards. Ehle and Wanamaker were both nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role at the 51st British Academy Film Awards.

==Plot==
In 1882, during his lecture tour of the United States, Oscar Wilde visits Leadville, Colorado. Despite his flamboyant personality and urbane wit, he proves to be a success with the local silver miners as he regales them with tales of Renaissance silversmith Benvenuto Cellini.

Wilde returns to London and weds Constance Lloyd. They have two sons in quick succession. While their second child is still an infant, the couple hosts a young Canadian named Robbie Ross, who seduces Wilde. Ross&#x27;s love for Wilde endures. On the opening night of his play &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;, Wilde is re-introduced to the dashingly handsome and foppish poet Lord Alfred &quot;Bosie&quot; Douglas, whom he had met briefly the year before. The two fall into a passionate and tempestuous relationship. The hedonistic Bosie is not content to remain monogamous and frequently engages in sexual activity with rent boys while his older lover plays the role of voyeur.

Bosie&#x27;s father, the Marquess of Queensberry, a violent and cruel man, objects to his son&#x27;s relationship with Wilde and demeans the playwright shortly after the opening of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;. When Wilde sues the Marquess for criminal libel, his homosexuality is publicly exposed. He is eventually tried for gross indecency and sentenced to two years&#x27; hard labour. Constance is advised by friends to go abroad and change her name to protect the children.

Prison life is grueling; the penal treadmill permanently wrecks Wilde&#x27;s health. Bosie tells Robbie he will look after Wilde in some pleasant sunny place when he is released. Constance visits him in prison. She is sending Cyril to school in Germany, and she may need back surgery. He tells her he has always loved her, and that he did not know himself in the beginning. She tells him she does not want a divorce. The children love him and he is welcome to visit as long as he never sees Bosie again.

Loyal friend Ada Leverson meets Wilde when he is released from prison in May 1897, carrying the manuscript of &quot;De Profundis&quot;. He goes straight into exile, to continental Europe. He puts flowers on Constance&#x27;s grave. Since she died (in April 1898) he is no longer allowed to see his children. He eventually meets with Douglas. A printed epilogue notes that they parted after three months and describes Wilde&#x27;s death in Paris in November 1900 at age 46 and the fates of Bosie and Ross.

Portions of the beloved Wilde story &quot;The Selfish Giant&quot; are woven throughout the film, beginning when Wilde tells the story to his children, then as Constance reads the book to them and so on until Wilde almost finishes the story in a voice-over as the film nears its end.

==Cast==
==Production==
In a featurette on the film&#x27;s DVD release, producer Marc Samuelson confesses casting Stephen Fry in the title role was both a blessing and a problem. Everyone agreed he was physically perfect for the part and more than capable of carrying it off, but the fact he was not a major presence in films made it difficult for them to obtain financing for the project.

In the DVD commentary, Fry, who is gay, admitted he was nervous about the love scenes with his heterosexual co-stars. He says Jude Law, Michael Sheen, and Ioan Gruffudd were quick to put him at ease. Orlando Bloom made his film debut in this film, with a brief appearance as a rentboy.

Scenes were filmed at Knebworth House in Hertfordshire; Lulworth Cove, Studland Bay, and Swanage Pier in Dorset; Houghton Lodge in Hampshire; Luton Hoo in Bedfordshire; Magdalen College in Oxford; Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in Holborn and Somerset House in the Strand.

Brothers Marc and Peter Samuelson produced the film in association with Dove International, NDF International, Pony Canyon, Pandora Film, Capitol Films, and BBC Films.

==Release==
&quot;Wilde&quot; had its world premiere at the 54th Venice International Film Festival on 1 September 1997, and was released in the United Kingdom by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment on 17 October 1997. In February 1998, it was announced that Sony Pictures Classics acquired North American distribution rights to the film, and set it for a 1 May 1998 release.

===Home media===
Altitude Film Distribution released the film on Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on 14 December 2015. Sony Pictures later released it on Blu-ray in the United States on 14 June 2022.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a broad but effectively intimate portrait&quot; and lauded Fry&#x27;s performance, writing that he &quot;looks uncannily like Wilde and presents a mixture of superciliousness and vulnerability. Though the film suffers a case of quip-lash thanks to its tireless Wildean witticisms, Mr. Fry&#x27;s warmly sympathetic performance finds the gentleness beneath the wit.&quot; Maslin concluded her review by stating, &quot;&quot;Wilde&quot; and Mr. Fry fare better at shaping an arch, vivid impersonation than in telling a cautionary tale.&quot;

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; opined that &quot;&quot;Wilde&quot; has found a perfect Oscar in the formidably talented Stephen Fry, who brings an uncanny physical resemblance to the Victorian playwright along with a profound grasp of the great wit&#x27;s psyche&quot; and described the film as &quot;a lustrous period piece with a high degree of authenticity in decor and costume.&quot; Thomas also stated, &quot;A work of superior craftsmanship, &quot;Wilde&quot; moves quite briskly, and the idea of approaching an unconventional life with a traditional narrative style pays off.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said the film &quot;has the good fortune to star Stephen Fry, a British author, actor and comedian who looks a lot like Wilde and has many of the same attributes: He is very tall, he is somewhat plump, he is gay, he is funny and he makes his conversation into an art. That he is also a fine actor is important, because the film requires him to show many conflicting aspects of Wilde&#x27;s life ... [He] brings a depth and gentleness to the role.&quot;

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;a sympathetic and, for the most part, nicely realized look into the private life of the flamboyant author&quot; and commented, &quot;Stephen Fry has the title role, and it&#x27;s hard to imagine a more appropriate actor ... In the last third, the film derails somewhat by turning preachy ... While [it] captures its subject&#x27;s singular charm, it ultimately doesn&#x27;t do justice to his complexity.&quot;

In the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, David Armstrong said the film &quot;benefits from its lush period costumes and settings but gains even more from an accomplished cast of British film and stage actors ... Stephen Fry ... slips right under the skin of the title character [and] presents a multidimensional portrait of a complex man ... However, &quot;Wilde&quot;, like Wilde, is flawed. Gilbert&#x27;s direction is sturdy but uninspired, and Ehle&#x27;s part is underwritten. To her credit, Ehle movingly conveys the sad frustration that Wilde implanted in his lonely wife; but Ehle has to do the work, playing her feelings on her face, with little help from Julian Mitchell&#x27;s screenplay.&quot;

Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; observed, &quot;Brian Gilbert, till now only a journeyman director, brings to the picture most of the qualities that were memorably absent in his previous costumer, &quot;Tom &amp; Viv&quot; – visual fluency, deep-seated emotion and first rate playing from his cast.&quot;

In the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, Alexander Walker called the film &quot;an impressive and touching work of intelligence, compassion and tragic stature&quot; and said Stephen Fry &quot;returns to the top of the class with a dominating screen performance.&quot;

In his review in &quot;Time Out New York&quot;, Andrew Johnston observed that &quot;The first hour – filled with sharp humor and steamy gay sex – delivers a thoroughly modern portrait of Wilde, and Fry (who in costume bears an astonishing resemblance to the writer) plays him with a pitch-perfect combination of smugness and warmth.&quot;

===Box office===
The film opened on 15 screens in the United Kingdom and grossed £146,495 ($237,128) in its opening weekend for a per-screen average of £9,766 ($15,803). It grossed $2,158,755 in the United States and Canada.

<text>Major General Sir Christopher Charles Teesdale (1 June 1833 – 1 December 1893) was the first South African-born recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==

Christopher Charles Teesdale was born in Grahamstown, Cape of Good Hope, to Lieutenant-General Henry George Teesdale of the Royal Artillery who was stationed there. He joined the Royal Artillery as a gentleman cadet on 29 April 1848. His first posting was to Corfu and he was promoted to second lieutenant on 22 March 1853 and left Corfu in April 1853.

==Crimea==

Teesdale was 22 years old, and a lieutenant in the Royal Regiment of Artillery, British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 29 September 1855 at Kars, Turkey, Lieutenant Teesdale volunteered to take command of the force engaged in the defence of the most advanced part of the works. He threw himself into the midst of the enemy and encouraged the garrison to make an attack so vigorous that the Russians were driven out. During the hottest part of the action he induced the Turkish artillerymen to return to their post from which they had been driven by enemy fire and after the final victorious charge he saved from the fury of the Turks a considerable number of the enemy wounded – an action gratefully acknowledged by the Russian Staff.

Teesdale was wounded at the siege of Kars, taken prisoner and held in Russia until he was released in 1856. He was awarded the Légion d&#x27;honneur and made an Honorary CB in the same year. A talented water colourist, he was responsible for illustrations in book on Battle of Kars by Humphry Sandwith, MD, the regiment&#x27;s doctor at Kars. The illustrations were possibly done whilst Teesdale was in captivity.

He was decorated with the VC by Queen Victoria in the quadrangle of Windsor Castle on 21 November 1857 along with James Craig, George Symons and Joseph Malone.

==Later life==

He was appointed as Master of The Ceremonies and Extra Equerry to The Prince of Wales on 9 November 1858, positions he held until his death and was also made aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria on 1 October 1877. Promoted to major-general in March 1887, he was made Knight Commander of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee honours on 8 July 1887. He retired on 22 March 1892 and was buried in his family tomb in South Bersted, Sussex. His VC is part of the Lord Ashcroft VC Collection at the Imperial War Museum.

<doc id="1191397" wikidata="Q317894" url="?curid=1191397" title="Galeazzo Maria Sforza">
<text>Galeazzo Maria Sforza (24 January 1444 – 26 December 1476) was the fifth Duke of Milan from 1466 until 1476. 

He was born to Francesco Sforza, a popular condottiero and ally of Cosimo de&#x27; Medici who would gain the Duchy of Milan in 1450, and Bianca Maria Visconti. 

He married into the Gonzaga family; on the death of his first wife Dorotea Gonzaga, he married Bona of Savoy. Cruel and vengeful, he was &quot;a man who did great follies and dishonest things not to write&quot;.

==Life==
Galeazzo Maria Sforza was born in Fermo, near the family&#x27;s castle of Girifalco. He was the first son of Francesco Sforza and Bianca Maria Visconti. At the death of his father on 8 March 1466, Sforza was in France heading a military expedition to help King Louis XI against Charles I of Burgundy. Called back home by his mother, Sforza returned to Italy under a false name. The false identity was necessary as he had to pass by the territories of the family&#x27;s enemy, the Duke of Savoy, who made an unsuccessful attempt on Sforza&#x27;s life. He entered Milan on 20 March 1466, and was acclaimed by the populace.

In his first years, Sforza and his mother ruled jointly, but he later ousted her from Milan.

==Patronage==
Sforza was famous as a patron of music. Under his direction, financial backing and encouragement, his chapel grew into one of the most famous and historically significant musical ensembles in Europe. Composers from the north, especially the Franco-Flemish composers from the present-day Low Countries, came to sing in his chapel and write masses, motets and secular music for him. Some of the figures associated with the Sforza chapel include Alexander Agricola, Johannes Martini, Loyset Compère, and Gaspar van Weerbeke. However, most of the singers at the Sforza chapel fled after Sforza&#x27;s murder and took positions elsewhere; as a result, there was soon a rise in musical standards in other cities such as Ferrara.

==Assassination==

There were three principal assassins involved in Sforza&#x27;s death: Carlo Visconti, Gerolamo Olgiati, and Giovanni Andrea Lampugnani, all fairly high-ranking officials at the Milanese court.

Lampugnani, descended from Milanese nobility, is recognized as the leader of the conspiracy. His motives were based primarily on a land dispute, in which Sforza had failed to intervene in a matter which saw the Lampugnani family lose considerable properties. Visconti and Olgiati also bore the duke enmity—Olgiati was a Republican idealist, whereas Visconti believed Sforza to have taken his sister&#x27;s virginity.
After carefully studying Sforza&#x27;s movements, the conspirators made their move on the day after Christmas, 1476, feast day of Saint Stephen, patron saint of Santo Stefano, the church where the deed was to be committed. Supported by about thirty friends, the three men waited in the church for the duke to arrive for mass. When Galeazzo Sforza arrived, Lampugnani knelt before him; after some words were exchanged, Lampugnani rose suddenly and stabbed Sforza in the groin and breast. Olgiati and Visconti soon joined in, as did a servant of Lampugnani&#x27;s.

Sforza was dead within a matter of seconds. All the assassins quickly escaped in the ensuing mayhem save for Lampugnani, who became entangled in some of the church&#x27;s cloth and was killed by a guard. His body soon fell into the hands of a mob, which dragged the corpse through the streets, slashing and beating at it; finally, they hung the body upside-down outside Lampugnani&#x27;s house. The beheaded corpse was cut down the next day and, in an act of symbolism, the &quot;sinning&quot; right hand was removed, burnt, and put on display.

===Aftermath of assassination===
Despite the initial public reaction, the government brought swift justice, soon encouraged by the public as well.

The conspirators had given little thought to the repercussions of their crime, and were apprehended within days. Visconti and Olgiati were soon found and executed, as was the servant of Lampugnani who had participated in the slaying. The executions took place in a public ceremony that culminated in the display of their corpses as a warning to others.

Evidence from the conspirators&#x27; confessions indicated that the assassins had been encouraged by the humanist Cola Montano, who had left Milan some months before, and who bore malice against the duke for a public whipping some years before. While being tortured, Olgiati also uttered the famous words, &quot;Mors acerba, fama perpetua, stabit vetus memoria facti&quot; (Death is bitter, but glory is eternal, the memory of my deed will endure).

Similar elements indicate that this assassination was likely influential in the Pazzi conspiracy, a subsequent attempt to dethrone the Medici family in Florence and to replace them with Girolamo Riario.

==Issue==

<text>Reginald Francis Lewis (December 7, 1942 – January 19, 1993), was an American businessman. He was one of the richest Black American men in the 1980s, and the first African-American to build a billion-dollar company: TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc.

In 1993, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed Lewis among the 400 richest Americans, with a net worth estimated at $400 million.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Born in Baltimore, Maryland to Carolyn and Clinton Lewis, Reginald Lewis grew up in a middle-class neighborhood. He won a football scholarship to Virginia State University (VSU) and joined the Alpha Phi chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi while an undergraduate student. After graduating from VSU with a degree in political science in 1965, he took part in a summer program at Harvard set up by the Rockefeller Foundation that introduced African Americans to the study of law. While there, he made such an impression that Harvard invited him to attend school that fall. At the time, this made him the only person in the 148-year history of Harvard Law School to be accepted before even applying. He completed his Juris Doctor at Harvard Law in 1968.

=== Career ===

Recruited to top New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP immediately after law school, Lewis left to start his own firm two years later. After 15 years as a corporate lawyer with his own practice, he moved to the other side of the table by creating TLC Group L.P., a private equity firm, in 1983.

His first major deal was the purchase of the McCall Pattern Company, a home sewing pattern business, for $22.5 million. Lewis had learned from an article in &quot;Fortune&quot; that the Esmark holding company, which recently purchased Norton Simon, planned to divest from the McCall Pattern Company, a maker of home sewing patterns founded in 1870. With fewer people sewing at home, McCall was seemingly on the decline—but it had posted profits of $6 million in 1983 on sales of $51.9 million. At the time, McCall was number two in its industry, holding 29.7 percent of the market, compared to industry leader Simplicity Patterns with 39.4 percent.

He managed to negotiate the price down, then raised $1 million from family and friends and borrowed the rest from institutional investors and investment banking firm First Boston Corp.

Within a year, he turned the company around by freeing capital tied in fixed assets, such as buildings and machinery, and finding a new use for machinery during downtime by manufacturing greeting cards. He then started to recruit managers from rival companies. He strengthened McCall by containing costs, improving quality, beginning to export to China, and emphasizing new product introductions. This combination led to the company&#x27;s most profitable year in its history. With the addition of McCall real estate worth an estimated $6 million that the company retained ownership, he later sold McCall at a 90-1 return, resulting in a tremendous profit for investors. Lewis&#x27;s share was 81.7 percent of the $90 million.

In 1987, Lewis bought Beatrice International Foods from Beatrice Companies for $985 million, renaming it TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc., a snack food, beverage, and grocery store conglomerate that was the largest African-American owned and managed business in the U.S. The deal partly was financed through Mike Milken of the maverick investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert. In order to reduce the amount needed to finance the leveraged buyout, Lewis planned to sell some of the division&#x27;s assets simultaneous with the takeover.

When TLC Beatrice reported revenue of $1.8 billion in 1987, it became the first black-owned company to have more than $1 billion in annual sales. At its peak in 1996, TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc. had sales of $2.2 billion and was number 512 on &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of 1,000 largest companies.

=== Philanthropy ===
In 1987, Lewis established the Reginald F. Lewis Foundation, which funded grants of approximately $10 million to various non-profit programs and organizations while he was alive. His first major grant was an unsolicited $1 million to Howard University in 1988; the federal government matched the grant, making the gift $2 million, which was used to fund an endowment for scholarships, fellowships, and faculty sabbaticals.

In 1992, Lewis donated $3 million to Harvard Law School, the largest grant at the time in the school&#x27;s history. The school renamed its International Law Center the Reginald F. Lewis International Law Center, the first major facility at Harvard named in honor of an African American.

While alive, Lewis made known his desire to support a museum of African-American culture. In 2005, the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History &amp; Culture opened in Baltimore with the support of a $5 million grant from his foundation. It is the East Coast&#x27;s largest African-American museum occupying an 82,000 square-foot facility with permanent and special exhibition space, interactive learning environments, auditorium, resource center, oral history recording studio, museum shop, café, classrooms, meeting rooms, outside terrace, and reception areas. It highlights the history and accomplishments of African Americans with a special focus on Maryland&#x27;s African-American community. The museum is also a Smithsonian affiliate.

Lewis was counsel to the New York-based Commission for Racial Injustice.

=== Death ===
On January 19, 1993, Lewis died at age 50 from brain cancer. His wife Loida Nicolas Lewis took over the company a year after his death and sold it in 1999.

==Personal life==
Lewis was married to Loida Nicolas Lewis, a Filipina lawyer. They had two daughters, Leslie and Christina. Lewis was Catholic.

<text>Packard&#x27;s Corner is located in Boston, Massachusetts at the intersection of Commonwealth Avenue and Brighton Avenue. Packard&#x27;s Corner is serviced by the Packards Corner stop on the B branch of the MBTA&#x27;s Green Line, a light rail line that runs mostly above ground.

According to the Brighton Allston Historical Society, the name comes from a livery yard, Packard&#x27;s Sales Stable and Riding School, which existed in the area from 1885 through 1920, and was perpetuated by a Packard automobile dealership that was built by Alvan T. Fuller circa 1910.

The former A branch once forked with the B line at Packard&#x27;s Corner where the A line continued onto Brighton Avenue towards Allston&#x27;s Union Square.

<text>Zimnicea () is a town in Teleorman County, Romania (in the historic region of Muntenia), a port on the Danube opposite the Bulgarian city of Svishtov.

==Geography==
Zimnicea is situated on the left bank of the Danube river. It is the southernmost place in Romania and a harbour on the Danube river. The distance between the Zimnicea and Bucharest is , and the distance to Alexandria (capital of Teleorman County) is about .

Zimnicea is served around the clock by the Svishtov–Zimnicea ferry – a regularly scheduled Roll-on/roll-off ferry across the Danube between Zimnicea and Svishtov, Bulgaria. The ferry shortens the road path to and from Turkey to Central and Western Europe by when compared to the traditional route over the Danube Bridge at Ruse-Giurgiu and allows a time gain of nearly four hours thus avoiding the traffic in and around the city of Bucharest.

==History==
Zimnicea developed near a Geto-Dacian fortress (about west of town centre). Traditional agriculture, fishing, iron processing, carpentry, pottery, tissue exchange of products were the occupations of the people throughout the town&#x27;s existence. The natives of Zimnicea sold grain, cattle, sheep, fish, butter, salt, honey, wax, timber and bought cloth, oriental fabric, carpets, and spices.
In 1838, the settlement Zimnicea was passed in the fairs, with the general population census of that year 551 families and 3,046 inhabitants. In the years 1837–1839 Zimnicea became the capital of Teleorman County.

Near Zimnicea there are ruins of several ancient fortresses and fortifications from the 4th to the 1st century BC. The oldest are believed by some scholars to have been built to defend the town from Alexander the Great&#x27;s general, Lysimachus.

The name of the town was first mentioned in 1385 in the travel logs of Christian pilgrims on their way home from their trip to Jerusalem. The Byzantines called it &quot;Demnitzikos&quot; and later on &quot;Dzimnikes&quot; or &quot;Dzimnikos&quot;. The town flourished as a trade post on the trade routes that linked Central Europe to the Balkans.

In 1835, it had 531 households, being the twelfth largest market town in Wallachia. For a short time in 1837 to 1838, it was the capital of Teleorman County, but due to internal dissent between the landowners and merchants, it was replaced by Alexandria.

During the Romanian War of Independence of 1877–1878, Zimnicea was the headquarters of the Russian Empire troops fighting in Bulgaria against the Ottoman Empire. During World War I, German Empire troops crossed the Danube in the Zimnicea sector, effectively bringing down the Romanian front in Muntenia.

During the 1977 Vrancea earthquake, there were allegedly not many buildings destroyed by the earthquake itself. Most of the destruction is said to have actually been done after the natural disaster by bulldozer, being ordered by local authorities, in order to receive financial allowances from the central government to create a new town from scratch on a new design. In the next period, a new town hall, the House of Culture, a new hospital (with Austrian funding), a new high school (with funds allocated by the Swiss government), and numerous blocks of flats were built, but many other projects remained abandoned after the fall of the communist regime, amid declining local industry, and by a subsequent decline in population.

==Natives==
* Răzvan Grădinaru (born 1995), footballer 
* Florea Opriș (born 1956), rugby union football player, referee, and coach

<text>An entrepôt ( ; ) or transshipment port is a port, city, or trading post where merchandise may be imported, stored, or traded, usually to be exported again. Such cities often sprang up and such ports and trading posts often developed into commercial cities due to the growth and expansion of long-distance trade. These places played a critical role in trade during the days of wind-powered shipping. In modern times customs areas have largely made entrepôts obsolete, but the term is still used to refer to duty-free ports with a high volume of re-export trade. &quot;Entrepôt&quot; also means &#x27;warehouse&#x27; in modern French, and is derived from the Latin roots &#x27;between&#x27; + &#x27;position&#x27;, literally &#x27;that which is placed between&#x27;.

Entrepôts had an important role in the early modern period, when mercantile shipping flourished between Europe and its colonial empires in the Americas and Asia. For example, the spice trade to Europe, which necessitated long trade routes, featured a much higher market price than the original buying price. Traders often did not want to travel the whole route, and thus used the entrepôts on the way to sell their goods. This could conceivably lead to more attractive profits for those who were suited to traveling the entire route. The 17th-century Amsterdam Entrepôt is an early modern example.

<doc id="1191433" wikidata="Q7275773" url="?curid=1191433" title="RAND Health Insurance Experiment">
<text>The RAND Health Insurance Experiment (RAND HIE) was an experimental study from 1974 to 1982 of health care costs, utilization and outcomes in the United States, which assigned people randomly to different kinds of plans and followed their behavior. Because it was a randomized controlled trial, it provided stronger evidence than the more common observational studies and concluded that cost sharing reduced &quot;inappropriate or unnecessary&quot; medical care (overutilization) but also reduced &quot;appropriate or needed&quot; medical care. 

==Methods==
The RAND HIE was begun in 1971 by a group led by health economist Joseph Newhouse and including health service researchers Robert Brook and John Ware; health economists Willard Manning, Emmett Keeler, Arleen Leibowitz, and Susan Marquis; and statisticians Carl Morris and Naihua Duan. The group set out to answer this question (among others): &quot;Does free medical care lead to better health than insurance plans that require the patient to shoulder part of the cost?&quot;

The team established an insurance company using funding from the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The company randomly assigned 5809 people to insurance plans that had no cost sharing, 25%, 50% or 95% coinsurance rates with a maximum annual payment of $1000. It also randomly assigned 1,149 persons to a staff model health maintenance organization (HMO), the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound. That group faced no cost sharing and was compared with those in the fee-for-service system with no cost sharing as well as an additional 733 members of the Cooperative who were already enrolled in it.

==Findings==
An early paper with interim results from the RAND HIE concluded that health insurance without coinsurance &quot;leads to more people using services and to more services per user,&quot; referring to both outpatient and inpatient services. Subsequent RAND HIE publications &quot;rule[d] out all but a minimal influence, favorable or adverse, of free care for the average participant&quot; but determined that a &quot;low income initially sick group assigned to the HMO . . . [had a] greater risk of dying&quot; than those assigned to fee-for-service (FFS) care. The experiment also demonstrated that cost-sharing reduced &quot;appropriate or needed&quot; medical care as well as &quot;inappropriate or unnecessary&quot; medical care. Studies of specific conditions and diseases in the RAND HIE data found, for example, that the decrease in use of medical services had adverse effects on visual acuity and on blood pressure control. A RAND summary said, &quot;The projected effect was about a 10 percent reduction in mortality for those with hypertension.&quot; Newhouse, summarizing the RAND HIE in 2004, wrote, &quot;For most people enrolled in the RAND experiment, who were typical of Americans covered by employment-based insurance, the variation in use across the plans appeared to have minimal to no effects on health status. By contrast, for those who were both poor and sick—people who might be found among those covered by Medicaid or lacking insurance—the reduction in use was harmful, on average.&quot;

==Criticisms and legacy==
The RAND Health Insurance Experiment is considered &quot;one of the best experimental social science studies ever conducted&quot;. 
However, several criticisms of the study have been suggested.
* Some authors questioned the generalizability of comparisons of HMO and FFS care since data on the former were based on a &quot;single, relatively small but well-managed&quot; HMO in Seattle.
* One 2007 article suggested that the &quot;large number of participants who voluntarily dropped out of the costsharing arms of the experiment&quot; could have invalidated the RAND HIE&#x27;s findings. In response, Newhouse and colleagues described the argument as &quot;implausible&quot;.
* The RAND HIE did not study people without health insurance and so could not determine how the presence or absence of health insurance affects health.

Nevertheless, the study opened the way for increased cost sharing for medical care in the 1980s and 1990s.

The RAND HIE is still referenced in the academic literature as a &quot;gold standard&quot; study in research on the effects of health insurance. For example, in 2007 RAND researchers reviewed the literature published between 1985 and 2006 on prescription drug cost sharing, which included co-payments, tiering, coinsurance, pharmacy benefit caps or monthly prescription limits, formulary restrictions, and reference pricing. In summarizing 132 articles, they found that the RAND HIE provided the only relevant experimental data; all other studies they reviewed were observational. They concluded: 

Increased cost sharing is associated with lower rates of drug treatment, worse adherence among existing users, and more frequent discontinuation of therapy. For each 10% increase in cost sharing, prescription drug spending decreases by 2% to 6%, depending on class of drug and condition of the patient. The reduction in use associated with a benefit cap, which limits either the coverage amount or the number of covered prescriptions, is consistent with other cost-sharing features. For some chronic conditions, higher cost sharing is associated with increased use of medical services, at least for patients with congestive heart failure, lipid disorders, diabetes, and schizophrenia. While low-income groups may be more sensitive to increased cost sharing, there is little evidence to support this contention.
Furthermore, the RAND HIE is mentioned regularly in the newsmedia:
* &quot;Evidence from the RAND Experiment indicates that most of the expenditure-reducing effects of health-plan deductibles occur at low levels of deductibles.&quot;
* &quot;A classic experiment by RAND researchers from 1974 to 1982 found that people who had to pay almost all of their own medical bills spent 30 percent less on health care than those whose insurance covered all their costs, with little or no difference in health outcomes. The one exception was low-income people in poor health, who went without care they needed.&quot;
* &quot;The RAND health insurance experiment found that patients cut back equally on both superfluous and necessary visits when asked for small co-payments.&quot;

==Oregon Health Study==
In 2008, for reasons of cost, Oregon&#x27;s Medicaid agency accepted 10,000 uninsured low-income adults into its insurance program based on a lottery with 89,824 applicants. In the Oregon Health Study, Newhouse and others tracked the effects on those who were accepted and rejected. They found that health insurance improved people&#x27;s perceptions of health, but people spent more money on health care and their physical health had not improved.

According to economist Katherine Baicker, the study &quot;put to rest two incorrect arguments&quot; related to Medicaid: 
that Medicaid is not beneficial and that Medicaid coverage saves money.

New data regarding the Oregon experiment shows that while it was effective to reduce out-of-pocket payment by the beneficiaries and increase their financial security, it did not lead to objective improvements in blood sugar, blood pressure, or some other metrics. The findings contradicted the earlier results, which had shown greater effects upon people&#x27;s health. However, these results are based on two years of data, and longer follow-up might reveal different results. The study did indicate a significant improvement in rates of depression in the two-year window.

<text>American Ninja is a 1985 American martial arts action film produced by Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus&#x27;s Cannon Films. Directed by Sam Firstenberg, who specialized in this genre in the 1980s, the film stars Michael Dudikoff in the title role and is the first installment in the &quot;American Ninja&quot; franchise, followed by &quot;American Ninja 2: The Confrontation&quot; (1987). It had a mixed reception, but it was a financial success, and since then, it has been considered a cult film.

==Plot==
As an alternative to prison, young American Joe Armstrong is conscripted into the U.S. Army by a judge. Joe ends up fighting off the Black Star Order of ninjas while stationed in the Philippines. Following an attempted highjacking of the convoy transporting equipment. Joe and his platoon fight off the highjackers and saves the life of Patricia Hickockdaughter of Colonel William Hickock, Joe&#x27;s commanding officerBut when the rest of Joe&#x27;s platoon is wiped out by the Black Star ninjas, Joe&#x27;s popularity with his fellow GIs takes a nosedive even as he is targeted for revenge by the Black Star Master who directs the ninja order.

While they are performing chores on the base, Corporal Curtis Jackson goads Joe into a fight. Jackson proves no match for Joe&#x27;s ninjitsu expertise, which greatly impresses him and their fellow soldiers. Shortly thereafter, Jackson discovers that Joe is an amnesiac; he remembers very little of his past, other than running with various street gangs and mastering several exotic martial arts. The grateful Patricia organizes a date for herself with Joe. Jackson and another soldier, Charley Madison, sneak Joe off the base. Joe and Patricia are caught during dinner by First Sergeant Rinaldo. Rinaldo is in the middle of a meeting with black marketer Victor Ortega, whose payroll the sergeant is on. To get Joe out of the way, Rinaldo leads him to an abandoned warehouse, ostensibly for dropping off supplies. There Joe is ambushed by ninjas but defeats all of them. Then Joe&#x27;s truck is stolen, and he gives chase using a motorcycle. The truck driver runs Joe off the road; thinking Joe dead, he brings the truck to Ortega.

Joe, however, hides under the truck. He is brought to the heart of Ortega&#x27;s operation, which encompasses the Black Star ninja training camp. Ortega is paying the Black Star Order for weapons stolen from the Army, which he then resells to the highest bidder. Joe is discovered but escapes with the aid of Ortega&#x27;s servant Shinyuki. Returning to the base, Joe is promptly arrested by military police under Rinaldo&#x27;s false accusation that Joe himself is fencing the arms. Jackson realizes that Joe has been set up, but his protests are wasted on Rinaldo. The Black Star Master infiltrates the base that night and slaughters the on-duty MPs. He then tries to kill Joe, but is thwarted by the sudden arrival of MP reinforcements, none of whom see the Black Star Master fleeing the scene. One of the dead MPs is found with a throwing star lodged in his head, further implicating Joe.

Only Jackson, Charley, and Patricia believe that Joe is innocent of the charges he now faces. They tell Hickock everything they know about the hijacking and murders, but he scoffs at their story. After briskly dismissing them, Colonel Hickock meets Rinaldo privately, revealing that the colonel himself is Ortega&#x27;s accomplice. Even as Hickock orders Rinaldo to finish off Joe, the Black Star Master kidnaps Patricia since her father is becoming a less-than-reliable partner. Rinaldo attempts to run Joe off the road, only to be killed himself.

Joe returns to Ortega&#x27;s mansion, where he is reunited with Shinyuki. It is revealed that Shinyuki, a former Japanese holdout soldier, adopted Joe at birth after the boy&#x27;s parents died. He trained Joe in the ways of ninjitsu until a bomb blast separated the two; each has believed the other to be dead for years. Now Shinyuki completes Joe&#x27;s training, and they launch a surprise attack on the Black Star training camp. Shinyuki sacrifices his life to help Joe defeat the Black Star Master; meanwhile, Hickock leads his own assault on Ortega&#x27;s villa to rescue his daughter and to wipe out &quot;loose ends&quot; connecting him with Ortega&#x27;s weapon-trafficking. Ortega flees by helicopter, with Patricia as his hostage, after gunning down her father. Joe, however, boards Ortega&#x27;s chopper; he and Patricia jump to safety just before Jackson shoots down the helicopter, killing Ortega.

===Casting===
Originally the studio wanted Chuck Norris to star. Some sources stated he did not want to have to cover up his face. Michael Dudikoff was cast, but had no martial arts experience. He was, however, already very athletic. Fight choreographer Mike Stone, who was an accomplished martial arts expert, assured the producers that he would pick up the moves.

===Post-production===
The film was initially called &quot;American Warrior&quot; and was released in UK cinemas under that title, but was changed to &quot;American Ninja&quot; for all other releases. The trailer (included on the DVD) contains the original title. In Germany, however, the film was released under the title &quot;American Fighter&quot;.
It was also the first of three films pairing Michael Dudikoff and Steve James, the other two being &quot;Avenging Force&quot; (1986) and &quot;American Ninja 2: The Confrontation&quot; (1987).

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;American Ninja&quot; received a mixed-to-negative reception with critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 0% based on 7 reviews, with an average rating of 3.2/10. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 20 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

In Germany, this initiative is especially targeted at government organizations, where public accountability is of special concern. Similar processes are being developed in many American corporations to aid compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

The implementation of any e-administration solution should be customer centric rather than organization centric, should remove dependence on specific individuals, and should introduce transparent systems of working. Examples of e-administration include, online timesheets and expense account. These can be used to help reduce costs to an organization.

<text>Force dynamics is a semantic category that describes the way in which entities interact with reference to force. Force Dynamics gained a good deal of attention in cognitive linguistics due to its claims of psychological plausibility and the elegance with which it generalizes ideas not usually considered in the same context.
The semantic category of force dynamics pervades language on several levels. Not only does it apply to expressions in the physical domain like &quot;leaning on&quot; or &quot;dragging&quot;, but it also plays an important role in expressions involving psychological forces (e.g. &quot;wanting&quot; or &quot;being urged&quot;). 
Furthermore, the concept of force dynamics can be extended to discourse. For example, the situation in which speakers A and B argue, after which speaker A gives in to speaker B, exhibits a force dynamic pattern.

==Context==
Introduced by cognitive linguist Leonard Talmy in 1981, force dynamics started out as a generalization of the traditional notion of the causative, dividing &quot;causation&quot; into finer primitives and considering the notions of &quot;letting&quot;, &quot;hindering&quot;, and &quot;helping&quot;. Talmy further developed the field in his 1985, 1988 and 2000 works. 

Talmy places force dynamics within the broader context of cognitive semantics. In his view, a general idea underlying this discipline is the existence of a fundamental distinction in language between closed-class (grammatical) and open-class (lexical) categories. This distinction is motivated by the fact that language uses certain categories of notions to structure and organize meaning, while other categories are excluded from this function. For example, Talmy remarks that many languages mark the number of nouns in a systematic way, but that nouns are not marked in the same way for &quot;color&quot;. Force Dynamics is considered to be one of the closed-class notional categories, together with such generally recognized categories as number, aspect, mood, and evidentiality.

Aspects of force dynamics have been incorporated into the theoretical frameworks of Mark Johnson (1987), Steven Pinker (1997) and Ray Jackendoff (1990) (see Deane 1996 for a critical review of Jackendoff’s version of Force Dynamics). Force dynamics plays an important role in several recent accounts of modal verbs in various languages (including Brandt 1992, Achard 1996, Boye 2001, and Vandenberghe 2002). Other applications of force dynamics include use in discourse analysis (Talmy 1988, 2000), lexical semantics (Deane 1992, Da Silva 2003) and morphosyntactical analysis (Chun &amp; Zubin 1990, Langacker 1999:352-4).

==Theoretical outline==
===Basic concepts===
Expressions can exhibit a force dynamic pattern or can be force-dynamically neutral. A sentence like &quot;The door is closed&quot; is force-dynamically neutral, because there are no forces opposing each other. The sentence &quot;The door cannot open&quot;, on the other hand, exhibits a force dynamic pattern: apparently the door has some tendency toward opening, but there is some other force preventing it from being opened (e.g., it may be jammed).

A basic feature of a force-dynamic expression is the presence of two force-exerting elements. Languages make a distinction between these two forces based on their roles. The force entity that is in focus is called the &quot;agonist&quot; and the force entity opposing it is the &quot;Antagonist&quot; (see &quot;a, figure 1&quot;). In the example, the &quot;door&quot; is the agonist and the force preventing the door from being opened is the Antagonist.

Force entities have an &quot;intrinsic force tendency&quot;, either toward action or toward rest. For the agonist, this tendency is marked with an arrowhead (action) or with a large dot (rest) (see &quot;b, figure 1&quot;). Since the antagonist by definition has an opposing tendency, it need not be marked. In the example, the door has a tendency toward action.

A third relevant factor is the balance between the two forces. The forces are out of balance by definition; if the two forces are equally strong, the situation is not interesting from a force-dynamic point of view. One force is therefore stronger or weaker than the other. A stronger force is marked with a &quot;plus&quot; sign, a weaker force with a &quot;minus&quot; sign (&quot;c, figure 1&quot;). In the example, the Antagonist is stronger, since it actually holds back the door.

The outcome of the Force-Dynamic scenario depends on both the intrinsic tendency and the balance between the forces. The result is represented by a line beneath Agonist and Antagonist. The line has an arrowhead if the outcome is action and a large dot if the outcome is rest (&quot;d, figure 1&quot;). In the example, the door stays closed; the Antagonist succeeds in preventing it from being opened. The sentence &#x27;The door cannot open&#x27; can be Force-Dynamically represented by the diagram at the top of this page.

Using these basic concepts, several generalizations can be made. The force dynamic situations in which the Agonist is stronger are expressed in sentences like ‘X happened &quot;despite&quot; Y’, while situations in which the Antagonist is stronger are expressed in the form of ‘X happened &quot;because of&quot; Y’. In the latter, a form of causation that Talmy termed &quot;extended causation&quot; is captured.

===More complexity===

More possibilities arise when another variable is introduced: &quot;change over time&quot;. This variable is exemplified by such expressions as &quot;A gust of wind made the pages of my book turn&quot;. In force dynamic terms, the situation can be described as the entering of an antagonist (the wind) that is stronger in force than the agonist (the pages) and changes the force tendency of the pages from a state of rest to a state of action (turning). In force dynamic diagrams, this motion (‘change over time’) of the Antagonist is represented by an arrow.

The diagrams in &quot;Figure 2&quot; to the right combine a shifting antagonist with agonists of varying force tendencies. The following sentences are examples for these patterns:
:a. &quot;A gust of wind made the pages of my book turn.&quot; 
:b. &quot;The appearance of the headmaster made the pupils calm down.&quot; 
:c. &quot;The breaking of the dam let the water flow from the storage lake.&quot;
:d. &quot;The abating of the wind let the sailboat slow down.&quot;

In this series of scenarios, various kinds of causation are described. Furthermore, a basic relationship between the concepts of ‘causing something to happen’ and ‘letting something happen’ emerges, definable in terms of the balance between the force entities and the resultants of the interaction.

Force entities do not have to be physical entities. Force dynamics is directly applicable to terms involving psychological forces like &quot;to persuade&quot; and &quot;to urge&quot;. The force dynamic aspect of the sentence &quot;Herbie did not succeed in persuading Diana to sing another song&quot; can be graphically represented as easily as the earlier example sentence &quot;The door cannot open&quot; (and, incidentally, by the same diagram).

In addition, force entities do not have to be physically separate. A case in point is &quot;reflexive&quot; force dynamic constructions of the type &quot;Chet was dragging himself instead of walking&quot;. It is perfectly possible to represent this in a Force Dynamic diagram (representing Chet’s will as the Agonist keeping the body — the Antagonist — in motion). Thus, even though Chet is one person, his will and his body are conceptualized separately.

===Psychological basis===
The key elements of force dynamics are very basic to human cognition. Deane (1996:56) commented that “[f]rom a cognitive perspective, Talmy’s theory is a striking example of a psychologically plausible theory of causation. Its key elements are such concepts as the (amount of) force exerted by an entity, the balance between two such forces, and the force vector which results from their interaction. Such concepts have an obvious base in ordinary motor activities: the brain must be able to calculate the force vector produced by muscular exertion, and calculate the probable outcome when that force is exerted against an object in the outside world.”

In cognitive linguistic terms, force dynamic expressions reflect a &quot;conceptual archetype&quot; because of their conceptual basality (Langacker 1999:24). In this view, expressions involving psychological forces reflect an extension of the category of force dynamics from the physical domain to the psychological domain.

==Limitations and criticism==
From the perspective of lexical semantics, some people have argued that force dynamics fails to be explanatory. For example, Goddard (1998:262–266) raised the objection that &quot;a visual representation cannot — in and of itself — convey a meaning. (…) From a semiotic point of view, a diagram never stands alone; it always depends on a system of verbal captions, whether these are explicit or implied.&quot; He goes on to attack the verbal definition of causation Talmy provides, claiming that it is circular and obscure. Furthermore, Goddard objects to the use of the &quot;semantically obscure concept of force&quot;. However, Goddard&#x27;s objections lose some of their strength in light of the fact that Force Dynamics does not present itself as a complete semantic description of the constructions involving Force Dynamic concepts. 

Another objection regarding force dynamics is the question, raised by Goddard (1998:81), of how different representational devices are supposed to interact with one another. As the field of cognitive linguistics is still in a state of theoretical flux, no systematic account addresses this issue yet. However, it is an objection many cognitive linguists are aware of. Some cognitive linguists have replied to such objections by pointing out that the goal of Cognitive Linguistics is not to construct a formal system in which theorems are proved, but rather to better understand the cognitive basis of language (cf. Newman 1996:xii). 

Jackendoff (1990, 1996:120–3), in the process of incorporating aspects of force dynamics into his theory of conceptual semantics, has proposed a reconfiguration of some of its basic notions. In Jackendoff’s view, this reconfiguration &quot;conforms better to the syntax of force-dynamic verbs&quot; (1996:121).

<text>Kingsbridge is a residential neighborhood in the northwest portion of the Bronx, New York City. Kingsbridge&#x27;s boundaries are Manhattan College Parkway to the north, the Major Deegan Expressway or Bailey Avenue to the east, West 230th Street to the south, and Irwin Avenue to the west.

The neighborhood is part of Bronx Community Board 8 and its ZIP Code is 10463. Kingsbridge is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 50th Precinct.

==Land use and terrain==
Kingsbridge has detached, semi detached, and attached homes, and apartment buildings. Streets connecting Riverdale and Kingsbridge include &quot;step streets&quot;, with stairways of as many as 160 steps climbing the slope. The neighborhood is also part of a business improvement district that is home to 200 merchants, and is one of the largest retail shopping districts in the Bronx. River Plaza Shopping Center is located nearby (in Marble Hill, Manhattan) but it is not part of the business improvement district. During the past several years there have been significant improvements in the infrastructure of the community. For example, the parks have been improved significantly and there are new elementary schools on 230th Street.

On 233rd and Bailey Avenue, there is a baseball field that is run by Kingsbridge Little League. The field has lights, dugouts, stands, and a small food court.

==History==

The neighborhood is named for the King&#x27;s Bridge, likely erected by enslaved Africans in 1693 and owned by Frederick Philipse, a local lord loyal to the British monarch. The bridge spanned a now-filled-in section of Spuyten Duyvil Creek, roughly parallel to today&#x27;s 230th Street. The King&#x27;s Bridge was part of Boston Post Road, connecting southern Westchester County (which later became the Bronx) with Marble Hill, once part of Manhattan Island and still part of the borough of Manhattan. The bridge is said to still be in place, having been buried when the creek bed was filled in. The creek&#x27;s water flow was redirected to the new and deeper shipping canal, south of Marble Hill.

Until the later part of the 19th century Riverdale, Kingsbridge, and other areas now in the northwest Bronx were part of the Town of Yonkers. The areas that are inside the modern-day New York city line broke off to form the Town of Kingsbridge. In 1874, the City of New York annexed three towns that later became the western half of The Bronx, including the Town of Kingsbridge. As the trains to Manhattan were built in the 20th century, a stop in the northwest Bronx along the Hudson River called Riverdale-on-Hudson, now Riverdale, was created. This gave rise to the Riverdale neighborhood. The remainder of the old Town of Kingsbridge developed into the modern-day Kingsbridge neighborhood.
Historical documents reveal that the Black population of Kingsbridge was proportionally much higher in the distant past than it is today, due to the number of Africans enslaved by local landowners from the late 1600s to mid 1800s. In more recent history, it became a neighborhood of predominately Irish immigrants. From the late 1970s the Irish population has decreased significantly, being replaced by large numbers of African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Albanians, and Greeks. According to an account by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the largest Hispanic group in Kingsbridge today are Dominicans, replacing the earlier Puerto Ricans and Cubans, who were the first Hispanics to settle in the neighborhood in the 1970s. There still is a strong Irish population centered on Bailey Avenue and Tibbett Avenue. The Dominicans predominantly live along Broadway and adjacent side streets, with a predominantly mixed ethnic area east and west of Broadway.

The Irish legacy can still be seen in the Roman Catholic churches and schools that serve the current residents, such as the St. John&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church on Kingsbridge Avenue near 231st Street, and its two schools; the elementary school on Godwin Terrace (just south of 231st Street), and the junior high school on Kingsbridge Avenue just a block north of 231st Street. In northern Kingsbridge the Visitation Roman Catholic Church and School is located on West 239th street. To the east, on Sedgwick Avenue is Our Lady of Angels Church and School. For recreation Gaelic Park, (now operated by Manhattan University), is located on 240th Street &amp; Broadway and is the venue for a variety of sports including Gaelic football and hurling. The neighborhood is also home to Manhattan University.

The area is patrolled by the 50th Precinct located at 3450 Kingsbridge Avenue. NYCHA property in the area is patrolled by P.S.A. 8 at 2794 Randall Avenue in the Throggs Neck section of the Bronx.

Kingsbridge was home to the 77-year-old Stella D&#x27;Oro factory, which was relocated to Ashland, Ohio when Stella D&#x27;Oro was sold to Lance after labor unrest in 2009.

<text>Pi Studios was a video game developer founded in 2002 by Robert Erwin, John Faulkenbury, Rob Heironimus, Dan Kramer and Peter Mack whose first commercial work can be found in Activision&#x27;s &quot;Call of Duty: United Offensive&quot;. The company originated in Plano, Texas and relocated to Houston, Texas in January, 2005.

In November, 2005, Pi Studios released &quot;Call of Duty 2: Big Red One&quot; for the PlayStation 2, the Xbox, and the GameCube. Work on that project was done jointly with Activision&#x27;s internal studio, Treyarch. This led to work on &quot;Call of Duty 3&quot; in October 2006, developed jointly with Treyarch. Pi&#x27;s work on the Call of Duty franchise continued with the &quot;Call of Duty 3 Bravo Map Pack&quot; (downloadable via Xbox Live Arcade) followed by &quot;Call of Duty: World at War&quot;, in which they assisted Treyarch in creating the single player mission &quot;Blowtorch and Corkscrew&quot;.

Pi Studios helped develop the &quot;Halo 2 Vista&quot; editing toolset and exclusive multiplayer map content, which was included with the game.

Pi Studios also developed &quot;Mercenaries 2: World in Flames&quot; on PlayStation 2 which was released in the United States on August 31, 2008, and in Europe on September 5, 2008.

Pi Studios is responsible for the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions of &quot;Rock Band&quot;, which shipped December 18, 2007 and June 22, 2008, respectively. These were developed in conjunction with Harmonix. Pi Studios also worked with Harmonix to produce four Rock Band Track Packs for the Wii and PlayStation 2. The two companies&#x27; final collaborative effort was on &quot;The Beatles: Rock Band&quot; for the (Wii), released in 2009.
&quot;Bomberman Live: Battlefest&quot; for Xbox Live Arcade, released in December 2010.

Pi Studios was developing &quot;&quot; for release on Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation 3 and Wii but it was cancelled.

In March 2011, it was announced that Pi Studios was closed as former employees have now formed a new development team called Category 6 Studios, which currently has around 15 members including co-founder and industry veteran Kenn Hoekstra.

<doc id="1191474" wikidata="Q921472" url="?curid=1191474" title="Brixworth">
<text>Brixworth is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire, England. The 2001 census recorded a parish population of 5,162, increasing to 5,228 at the 2011 census. The village&#x27;s All Saints&#x27; Church is of Anglo-Saxon origin. 

==Location==
The village is about north of Northampton next to the A508 road, which now by-passes the village. It is about south of Market Harborough. About north of the village is a junction with the A14 road that runs between the M1 and M6 motorway interchange at Catthorpe east to Cambridge and the east coast port of Felixstowe.

The village is popular with commuters to Leicester, Peterborough, Birmingham and London. The nearest railway stations for London are at Northampton, for London (Euston) (EUS), and Kettering for London (St Pancras) (STP) and for Leicester (LEI) at Market Harborough. Trains for Northampton also go to Coventry and Birmingham.

==History==

The place-name &#x27;Brixworth&#x27; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Briclesworde&quot;. The name means &#x27;Beorhtel&#x27;s or Beorhthelm&#x27;s homestead or enclosure&#x27;.

A lengthy article about the history of the parish appears in the Victoria County History for Northamptonshire, volume 4, which was published in 1937. Its text can be consulted at British History Online.

The main road from Northampton to Market Harborough passed through the village, where a number of inns served the needs of travellers for refreshment, lodging and a change of horses. The buildings of two present-day pubs in the village date back to the era of horse-drawn transport:
* &quot;The George Inn&quot;
* &quot;The Coach and Horses&quot;

In 1819 Sir Charles Knightley purchased land between Spratton Road and Kennel Terrace, where the Pytchley Hunt then erected kennels, providing a fresh source of local employment at a time of agricultural depression. The Hunt remained in the village until 1966, after which the site was developed for housing.

===The church===
All Saints&#x27; Church is one of the oldest, largest and most complete Anglo-Saxon churches in the country. It was founded circa 680 AD and was called &quot;the finest Romanesque church north of the Alps&quot; by Sir Alfred Clapham.

===Chartism===
In June 1839, Brixworth was the scene of a notable public meeting addressed by the Chartist Robert George Gammage of Northampton. Before the meeting took place, Gammage and his two companions attended a service in the parish church where the vicar Charles Frederic Watkins rebuked them and threatened the three with arrest if the meeting proceeded. Despite this, Gammage recalled that attendance at the roadside assembly later that day amounted to several hundreds and Watkins&#x27; efforts to persuade the constable to arrest those who addressed it were unsuccessful.

===Poor Law Union===
Brixworth Poor Law Union was established in 1835 and a workhouse erected on the south side of Spratton Road soon afterwards. Only the entrance block, including some later side extensions to it, remains; these premises are now used for business purposes. The activities of the Brixworth Poor Law Union attracted controversy, particularly in the latter part of the 19th century, because of its reluctance to provide relief to poor people unless they agreed to enter the Workhouse. Brixworth is the focus of a substantial work on the political, social and personal implications of welfare policies during the period. The Workhouse was closed in 1935.

===The railway===
The Northampton and Market Harborough railway through the parish was opened in 1859, passing west of the village. British Railways closed Brixworth railway station to passenger traffic in 1960 and closed the line to freight traffic in 1981. The trackbed of the former railway was reopened in 1993 as the Brampton Valley Way.

=== Iron ore quarrying ===
At various times iron ore quarrying has been carried out on the north, east and south sides of the village. The ore was taken in various ways to the railway for transport to ironworks. The first quarry can still be seen west of the church at a place called Stonepit Close. It is now allotments. Quarrying began in 1863 and finished about 1874. It is not clear if the ore was taken away by tramway or by horse and road wagon to the station. In about 1873 another quarry was opened nearby, to the north of the church. This was connected by gauge tramway to sidings at the station. When this was worked out the same tramway served later quarries further east to the north and south of Scaldwell Road, finishing in 1936 south of Scaldwell Road and in 1947 further north. The later quarries in this system were to the east of the A508.

Another quarry began in 1873 to the south of the village connected with the railway by gauge tramway. This was firstly to the west of the main road in the area to the south of Foxhill Crescent and later to the east of the main road in the vicinity of what is now Ashway. Quarrying finished here in about 1912.

A new pit was begun in 1939, operating until 1949. This was operated by the Staveley Coal and Iron Company and was connected to their quarrying operation at Scaldwell by an extension of their gauge tramway. The ore was transported from Scaldwell to sidings near Hanging Houghton via an aerial ropeway. The aerial ropeway was replaced in 1954 by a standard gauge branch line.

Another quarry began operation in 1880 west of Station Road, opposite Stonepit Close. It had its own tramway to the sidings at Brixworth Station and ceased operation in 1896.

The gauge tramways were worked by horse at first but the first steam locomotive was in use by 1879. Quarrying was done by hand at first. The first steam quarrying machine was in use by 1917, and the first diesel machine in 1935. Close to the south and east of the village most of the quarried area has had housing and an industrial estate built on it. In the industrial estate the street names Ironstone Way, Quarry Road, Ferro Fields and Staveley Way commemorate the quarries. Apart from Stonepit Close the visible remains of the quarrying are in the form of ground levels being below the roads and surrounding fields. The industrial estate and part of the churchyard are lower than the original landscape, due to the quarrying activity.

===Village development===
From the 1960s onwards, a large amount of new housing has been built at Brixworth, mainly on fields to the south of the original village. A by-pass on the east side has diverted traffic travelling between Northampton and Market Harborough away from the built-up area. Another major change has been the creation of Pitsford Water (a reservoir) and Brixworth Country Park, which are a short distance from the village.

==Notable buildings==
The Historic England website contains details of a total of 17 listed buildings in the parish of Brixworth, all of which are Grade II apart from All Saints&#x27; Church, which is Grade I. They include:

==Brixworth Hall==
Brixworth Hall was near the church, surrounded by a park and close to the centre of the historic settlement of Brixworth. The hall was built in the Tudor period by the Saunders family who were part owners of the manor of Brixworth from 1532. The house was owned by four generations of the Saunders family until the early 18th century. It was extended in the 18th century, incorporating parts of the original building. The house was offered for sale by auction in 1801 at which time it was described as being a spacious stone mansion with coach house, stabling, gardens, canals and fish-ponds. In 1900, Richard Lee Bevan was the owner of the Hall at the time of his death. He was a partner in Barclay, Bevan and co. the historic core of the Barclays group. The hall was demolished in 1954.

==Churches==
The churches that currently worship at Brixworth are:
*All Saints&#x27; Parish Church
*Brixworth Christian Fellowship

A Wesleyan Methodist (later Methodist) chapel was opened in Church Street in 1811 and enlarged in 1860. The chapel closed in the 1970s and the building is now in residential use.

==School==
The primary school at Brixworth is Brixworth Church of England Voluntary Controlled Primary School. Details of a series of reports on the school can be found in the relevant section of the Ofsted website. 450 pupils were on the roll at the time of the inspection in September 2011.

==Clubs and amenities==
Brixworth Juniors Football Club is a football club that encourages children of all ages to be active and play sport. It has produced successful footballers, including AFC Rushden &amp; Diamonds&#x27; Liam Dolman and Derby County&#x27;s Jack Marriot. The adults&#x27; team, Brixworth All Saints, are in Division One of the Northamptonshire Football Combination, which is at level 8 of the National League System. It plays its home games on the village&#x27;s St David&#x27;s Recreation Ground.

Brixworth Cricket Club plays on the ground at Haywards Barn, which was opened in 2008, as well as on St David&#x27;s playing field for third team and junior games. The 1st team play in the premier division of the Northants Cricket League and the 2nd and 3rd team play in Divisions 5 and 13. They run 4 junior teams between ages 9 and 17 who play on both grounds.

The Drama Society stages 2–3 productions annually – including a pantomime.

The village is home to an historical re-enactment society, Sir William Harrington&#x27;s Companye, who recreate life as it would have been for the 15th-century inhabitants of Brixworth.
There is a free village newspaper, the &quot;Brixworth Bulletin&quot;.

Brampton Valley Way passes west of the village, Pitsford Reservoir is about to the southeast and the Northampton &amp; Lamport Railway is to the south at Pitsford and Brampton railway station.

==Wind farm==
In 2008, the Mercedes-Benz HighPerformanceEngines (HPP) premises in Brixworth planned to build two high wind turbines. Lancaster-based Wind Direct has submitted a planning application to Daventry District Council to install the two turbines and Mercedes-Benz HPP plans to use 92 per cent of the electricity generated, with the rest being exported to the National Grid. The plans are controversial with opposition from some, but not all local residents.

<doc id="1191481" wikidata="Q1427237" url="?curid=1191481" title="Canister shot">
<text>Canister shot is a kind of anti-personnel artillery ammunition. It has been used since the advent of gunpowder-firing artillery in Western armies, and saw particularly frequent use on land and at sea in the various wars of the 18th and 19th century. Canister is still used today in modern artillery.

== Description ==

Canister shot consists of a closed metal cylinder typically loosely filled with round lead or iron balls packed with sawdust to add more solidity and cohesion to the mass and to prevent the balls from crowding each other when the round was fired. The canister itself was usually made of tin, often dipped in a lacquer of beeswax diluted with turpentine to prevent corrosion of the metal. Iron was substituted for tin for larger-caliber guns. The ends of the canister were closed with wooden or metal disks.

A cloth cartridge bag containing the round&#x27;s gunpowder used to fire the canister from the gun barrel could be attached to the back of the metal canister for smaller caliber cannon. A sabot of wood, metal, or similar material was sometimes used to help the round during firing from the cannon.

Various types of canister were devised for specific models of artillery field pieces. In 1753, the &quot;secret howitzer&quot;, a special gun with an oval bore—intended to spread shot even wider—was briefly introduced into Russian service, but ultimately proved unsuccessful. The Royal Artillery Museum at Woolwich, London, holds examples of two early 18th century experimental French wide bore cannon—flattened tubes intended to scatter canister wide but in one horizontal plane.

The United States Army developed a canister round, the M1028, for the M1 Abrams&#x27; 120 mm smoothbore gun in time for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The effect is to turn a large-caliber gun on an armored fighting vehicle into a giant shotgun. This can be used against enemy infantry even when in proximity to friendly armoured vehicles, as the projectiles do not penetrate armour. In addition it can be used to create entry points to buildings, reduce wire obstacles and clear heavy vegetation, as well as strike low flying aircraft and helicopters.

== Langrage ==

At times when the supply of balls were limited, nails, scrap iron or lead, wire, and other similar metal objects were included. The projectile had been known since at least the 16th century and was known by various nicknames in the 17th century such as hailshot or partridge shot. Rounds recovered from Henry VIII&#x27;s warship &quot;Mary Rose&quot; (sunk 1545) were wooden cylinders filled with broken flint flakes. When filled with rubbish or scrap (rather than round bullets) the round could be known as scrapshot or langrage. In 1718 Blackbeard armed his guns with a range of makeshift weaponry including langrage. Several of his cannons, still loaded with spikes and shot, have been recovered from the wreck site of his flagship, the &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. Archaeologists have also retrieved conglomerations of lead shot, nails, spikes and glass from the site. Langrage was also found among the artifact assemblage of the &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; shipwreck, 4000 ft (1219 m) deep in the Gulf of Mexico.

== Effectiveness ==
When fired, the canister disintegrates and its shards and projectiles spread out in a conical formation, causing a wide swath of destruction. It was particularly effective during the Napoleonic Wars and the American Civil War, where massed troops at close range (usually less than 400 yards) could be broken up by artillery batteries firing canister. At times, particularly at very close range, artillery crews would fire extremely lethal &quot;double canister,&quot; where two rounds were loaded into the gun tube and fired simultaneously using a single charge. At the Battle of Waterloo, in 1815, Mercer&#x27;s Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, fired a roundshot and a canister from each gun as a double-shot. The roundshot was loaded first with the canister on top. Canister played a key role for Union forces during their defeat of Confederate troops in Pickett&#x27;s Charge during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. In 1864 at the Battle of Brice&#x27;s Cross Roads the Confederates used this method.

At times, trained artillerists would fire the canister shot towards the ground in front of advancing enemy troops, causing the conical pattern to flatten out as the balls ricocheted and skipped off the terrain. This in effect widened the killing zone. An example of this tactic was on the first day of Gettysburg, where Lt. James Stewart&#x27;s Battery B, 4th U.S. Artillery on Seminary Ridge skipped canister shot at Alfred M. Scales&#x27;s approaching Confederate infantry, breaking up their attack and forcing them to take cover in a depression.

Canister shot was also used to good effect by U.S. Marine 37 mm anti-tank guns in World War II to break up Japanese banzai charges.

During the Korean War United Nations tanks experienced close-range massed infantry attacks from Communist forces. As a consequence a canister-type tank round was introduced to &quot;sweep&quot; enemy infantry off friendly tanks without harming friendly tank crews, who were behind canister-proof armor. UK weapons known to have fielded a canister round are the 76 mm and 105 mm tank guns and the 120 mm MOBAT and WOMBAT recoilless anti-tank guns.

== Similar multi-projectile ammunition ==
Shrapnel shells—named for the inventor, British artillery officer Henry Shrapnel—were developed from canister during the Napoleonic Wars and were intended to deliver the same canister effect, but at much longer ranges. As a result, its early designation was &quot;spherical case shot&quot;. Instead of a tin can filled with metal balls, the shrapnel shells carry a small powder charge to break open the case and disperse the shrapnel.

Grapeshot was a geometric arrangement of round shot packed tightly into a canvas bag and separated from the gunpowder charge by a metal disk of full bore diameter. Grapeshot used fewer but larger projectiles than were contained within canister or shrapnel shells.

Case shot broadly describes any multi-projectile artillery ammunition. The canister round is known as a case, so canister was sometimes called case shot and the term has confusingly become generic for grapeshot and shrapnel shells. However, the term case shot is also used to describe a hollow ball containing a powder charge and bullets. After firing the iron ball the powder would explode, scattering the bullets.

<text>Brockhall is a civil parish and village in West Northamptonshire in England. Brockhall, like many estate villages, is a small settlement that has developed around its eponymous hall. The village - Brocole in Old English - was recorded in the Domesday Book. Brocole means &quot;Badger hole&quot;. The name is derived from &quot;broc&quot; (&quot;badger&quot; in Old English) and &quot;hol&quot; (&quot;hollow&quot; in Old English). The population is included in the civil parish of Norton.

The parish church, St Peter &amp; St Paul, is part of the Benefice of Heyford with Stowe IX Churches and Flore with Brockhall.

==Notable buildings==
Brockhall Hall was originally built by Edward Eyton. In 1625, Eyton sold the house to Thomas Thornton of Newnham. Thornton was a lawyer and also the Recorder of Daventry. In 1634 Thomas Thornton bought Newnham manor from the Knightleys of Fawsley who had held it jointly with Badby manor since 1542. Mr Thornton supported Oliver Cromwell and was later pardoned by King Charles II. 
Since the Civil War, five Thorntons have held the position of High Sheriff of Northamptonshire. The first was John Thornton who assumed the post in 1672; the last was Colonel Thornton who held the position in 1946.
During World War II, the hall and its grounds were used by the American Office of Strategic Studies, an early predecessor of the CIA. Saboteurs were airlifted to Europe from nearby Harrington airfield where the Carpetbagger Museum commemorates their contributions to the war effort.
The Thornton family lived at Brockhall Hall until 1969 when it was sold to Peter Lee after the death of the last male heir. Brockhall Hall is now divided up into a number of residential flats.

A descendant of the original owner, Thomas Reeve Thornton (d. 1862), married Susannah Fremeaux, the heiress of her grandfather James Fremeaux of Kingsthorpe (d. 1799). Fremeaux was a Huguenot merchant who had been naturalised as a British citizen in 1752 and had through marriage acquired the Cooke estate at Kingsthorpe in 1762. The Thorntons remained at Brockhall until 1969. In 1978, upon the death of Col. Thomas Anson Thornton, the male line became extinct.

The house is reputed to be haunted by a white lady - this might be an owner&#x27;s wife who committed suicide in the 1780s.

St Peter and St Paul church is c.1200. The chancel was rebuilt in 1874 by Edmund Francis Law. The church has several monuments to the Thorntons.

The Manor House is dated 1617.

<text>Modjeska Monteith Simkins (December 5, 1899 – April 5, 1992) was an important leader of African-American public health reform, social reform and the Civil Rights Movement in South Carolina.

==Early life==
Modjeska Monteith was born on December 5, 1899, in Columbia, South Carolina. Her father, Henry Clarence Montieth, worked as a brick mason, and her mother was Rachel Evelyn Hall. Modjeska lived on a farm near Columbia and attended elementary school, high school and Benedict College, receiving a bachelor of arts degree in 1921. The same year, she began teaching at Booker T. Washington High School. Because public schools in Columbia did not allow married women to teach, she was asked to resign when she married Andrew Whitfield Simkins in December 1929.

In 1931, Simkins entered the field of public health as the Director of Negro Work for the South Carolina Tuberculosis Association, and became the state&#x27;s only full-time, statewide African-American public health worker. For decades prior to the 1930s, southern racism and poverty had created an alarming increase in deaths among African Americans due to tuberculosis, pellagra and other illnesses. By creating alliances with influential white and African-American groups and raising funds, Simkins made a substantial impact on the health of African Americans in South Carolina.

==Civil rights advocate==
In 1942, Simkins lost her position with the Tuberculosis Association, partly due to her increasing involvement with the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People). In 1939, when the South Carolina NAACP was formed, Simkins was already a member of the executive board of the local Columbia NAACP branch and the chair of its program committee. Simkins became one of the founders of the state conference, elected to the first executive board, and the first chair of the state programs committee. In 1941, she was elected Secretary of the state conference, the only woman to serve as an officer.

During her tenure as Secretary (1941–57), her work helped the state move towards racial equality. From 1943 to 1945, she was instrumental in gaining teacher approval and support for teacher equalization lawsuits in Sumter, South Carolina, and Columbia, South Carolina. Perhaps her most significant work took place in 1950 with the South Carolina federal court case of &quot;Briggs v. Elliott&quot;.

Simkins was involved in Republican Party politics until 1952, when she switched to the Democratic Party and voted for Adlai Stevenson.

Working with the Reverend Joseph DeLaine, president of the Clarendon County, South Carolina NAACP, she helped write the declaration for the school lawsuit that asked for the equalization of Clarendon County black and white schools. The Clarendon County case was eventually reworked to become one of several individual cases set up to directly challenge the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine in the Supreme Court of the United States case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; in Topeka in 1954.

Because her activism was at times controversial, her life and home became targets of violence. An unknown person shot at her house during the time she was active with the NAACP. In the late 1950s, many began to accuse Simkins of being a communist. Some of her friends were members of the American Communist Party, and she was accused of subversive activities by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the House Un-American Activities Committee. Furthermore, accusations against civil rights activists for being communists intensified after the &quot;Brown&quot; decision was passed down.

In 1957, Simkins was not nominated as a candidate for secretary by the Nominations Committee of the South Carolina NAACP. It was the first time in sixteen years that she did not get nominated. Some NAACP officials have suggested that her associations with communists and supposedly subversive groups were the cause of this. She remained active for many years in the Southern Conference Educational Fund (SCEF), a southwide interracial civil rights organization, working with James Dombrowski and Carl and Anne Braden.

Simkins was able to serve in leadership positions that were traditionally unavailable to women in the Civil Rights Movement. In 1981, she was honored by a coalition of civil rights groups, who established an endowment in her name to provide income for activists working for the causes of the underprivileged. Hundreds of people attended a memorial service following her death on April 5, 1992, and Judge Matthew J. Perry stated:

She probably will be remembered as a woman who challenged everyone. She challenged the white political leadership of the state to do what was fair and equitable among all people and she challenged black citizens to stand up and demand their rightful place in the state and the nation.

==Death and legacy==
Simkins died in Columbia, South Carolina on April 5, 1992, an event recognized by the South Carolina legislature. Simkins was interred at the Palmetto Cemetery in Columbia. Her portrait by Larry Francis Lebby, initiated by legislation sponsored by Representative Alma W. Byrd, hangs in the South Carolina State House. Her residence was restored and placed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Modjeska Monteith Simkins House. The house was noted among the historic sites that made Richland County, South Carolina the municipality with the highest number of preserved sites honoring Black women in the United States.

<text>In mathematics, a pairing is an &quot;R&quot;-bilinear map from the Cartesian product of two &quot;R&quot;-modules, where the underlying ring &quot;R&quot; is commutative.

==Definition==
Let &quot;R&quot; be a commutative ring with unit, and let &quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot; and &quot;L&quot; be &quot;R&quot;-modules.

A pairing is any &quot;R&quot;-bilinear map formula_1. That is, it satisfies

:formula_2,

:formula_3 and formula_4

for any formula_5 and any formula_6 and any formula_7. Equivalently, a pairing is an &quot;R&quot;-linear map

:formula_8

where formula_9 denotes the tensor product of &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot;.

A pairing can also be considered as an &quot;R&quot;-linear map
formula_10, which matches the first definition by setting
formula_11.

A pairing is called perfect if the above map formula_12 is an isomorphism of &quot;R&quot;-modules and the other evaluation map formula_13 is an isomorphism also. In nice cases, it suffices that just one of these be an isomorphism, e.g. when &quot; R&quot; is a field, &quot;M,N&quot; are finite dimensional vector spaces and &quot;L=R&quot;.

A pairing is called non-degenerate on the right if for the above map we have that formula_14 for all formula_15 implies formula_16; similarly, formula_17 is called non-degenerate on the left if formula_14 for all formula_19 implies formula_20.

A pairing is called alternating if formula_21 and formula_22 for all &quot;m&quot;. In particular, this implies formula_23, while bilinearity shows formula_24. Thus, for an alternating pairing, formula_25.

==Examples==
Any scalar product on a real vector space &quot;V&quot; is a pairing (set , in the above definitions).

The determinant map (2 × 2 matrices over &quot;k&quot;) → &quot;k&quot; can be seen as a pairing formula_26.

The Hopf map formula_27 written as formula_28 is an example of a pairing. For instance, Hardie et al. present an explicit construction of the map using poset models.

==Pairings in cryptography==

In cryptography, often the following specialized definition is used:

Let formula_29 be additive groups and formula_30 a multiplicative group, all of prime order formula_31. Let formula_32 be generators of formula_33 and formula_34 respectively.

A pairing is a map: formula_35

for which the following holds:
# Bilinearity: formula_36
# Non-degeneracy: formula_37
# For practical purposes, formula_38 has to be computable in an efficient manner

Note that it is also common in cryptographic literature for all groups to be written in multiplicative notation. 

In cases when formula_39, the pairing is called symmetric. As formula_40 is cyclic, the map formula_41 will be commutative; that is, for any formula_42, we have formula_43. This is because for a generator formula_44, there exist integers formula_45, formula_46 such that formula_47 and formula_48. Therefore formula_49.

The Weil pairing is an important concept in elliptic curve cryptography; e.g., it may be used to attack certain elliptic curves (see MOV attack). It and other pairings have been used to develop identity-based encryption schemes.

==Slightly different usages of the notion of pairing==
Scalar products on complex vector spaces are sometimes called pairings, although they are not bilinear.
For example, in representation theory, one has a scalar product on the characters of complex representations of a finite group which is frequently called character pairing.

<doc id="1191502" wikidata="Q1892959" url="?curid=1191502" title="Ferrari America">
<text>Ferrari America is a series of flagship grand touring Ferrari models primarily built for the North American market in the 1950s and 1960s. The America models were equipped with large V12 engines and often had custom bodywork done by famous coachbuilders in Italy. All America models used a live axle in the rear, were front-engined, and had worm and sector steering.

Two models from the series, the 410 and the 400, were called &quot;Superamerica&quot; with the final model, the 500 being called the superfast. The America series also includes the 365 California.


==340 America==

The first America cars were called the 340 and were produced between 1950 and 1952. The new Lampredi V12 developed for Formula One racing was rated at . Originally only 23 units were built: 11 by Vignale, eight by Touring, and four by Ghia. Giovanni Michelotti was tasked with the design work for the cars produced by Vignale. The first two Americas were converted from the 275 S. In 1951, 340 America Vignale Berlinetta won Mille Miglia race driven by Luigi Villoresi. Three Touring barchettas were also entered that year but did not finish.

The 340 America was succeeded by the 375 America.

==342 America==

Only six road cars were made: Vignale Cabriolet (designed by Giovanni Michelotti), two Pinin Farina Cabriolets and three Pinin Farina Coupés. Using the same Lampredi-designed engine as in 340 America with a different carburettor air filter arrangement and thus was detuned to . Last example, the Pinin Farina Cabriolet s/n 0248AL presented at 1953 New York Auto show, was upgraded to 4.5 L engine. Both 340/342 Americas used even chassis numbering of a race cars, while 375 America and later used odd chassis numbering of a road cars. A Black Pinin Farina Cabriolet was owned by King Leopold III of Belgium.

==375 America==

The 375 America was introduced in 1953 and a Pinin Farina bodied example was shown at that year&#x27;s Paris Salon. Built as a successor to the 342 America, The 375 used the new &quot;long block&quot; Lampredi designed V12 engine that was rated at at 6,300 rpm, with three Weber 40DCF (or DCZ) carburettors. The stated performance figures were a 0- acceleration time in under seven seconds and a top speed of almost . The 375 began the tradition of using the off chassis numbers of road cars contrary to its predecessors which used even chassis numbers pertaining to race cars. The expensive and exclusive 375 was only built from late 1953 through 1954 and 12 cars were made, with ten being original 375s and two being 250 Europas that were subsequently converted to 375 specifications (the 250 Europa and the 375 had a nearly identical wheelbase, chassis and mechanicals). The majority of 375s had either three or five-window coupe bodies by Pinin Farina, though Vignale bodied around three Coupés and one convertible.

==410 Superamerica==

The 410 Superamerica was introduced in 1955 and used the engine based on a single plug 410 S powerplant. The engine had an increased displacement up to and was rated at at 6,000 rpm thanks to three Weber 40DCF carburettors. The 410 Superamerica had a new chassis, featuring independent coil spring front suspension and was the first Ferrari road car to use a five speed gearbox. The car had a listed top speed of and was recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the world&#x27;s fastest production car. In 1957, the carburetors were upgraded for Weber 46DCF3 units which resulted in an increased power output of . This uprated engine was fitted to the Series III 410 Superamerica and marked the final development for the &#x27;long-block&#x27; Lampredi V12.

Each 410 Superamerica had custom bodywork, with a few by Boano and Ghia but most by Ferrari stalwart, Pinin Farina. The price was extremely high—at US$16,800, the 410 Superamerica offered at the New York Auto Show by importer Luigi Chinetti was more than twice as expensive as the Mercedes-Benz 300SL &quot;Gullwing&quot; exhibited by Max Hoffman. Due to its high price tag, the car was a sales disappointment. Just 35 units were built when production ended in 1959. First 2 series of Pinin Farina coupés were very similar with only 3rd series radically redesigned with non-panoramic rear window, different side-line, lower front grille and more recessed headlights with the headlights in some cars being covered. While the Series III, introduced in 1959, had 3 louvres behind side-windows, some have this space covered with glass. 

===410 Superfast Pinin Farina Speciale===

The 410 Superfast was also known as &quot;Superfast I&quot; and was based on the on 410 Superamerica chassis with 24-plug racing engine from 410 S, prominent tailfins and bi-coloured body. It was unveiled at the 1956 Paris Auto Show. The car had a shorter wheelbase of .

===4.9 Superfast===

The 4.9 Superfast was a one-off based on the 410 Superamerica chassis and engine. Presented in Paris in 1957, this car was an evolution of 410 Superfast but without the prominent rear fins. Also the colours were similar but with dark blue-green full body and white roof.
==400 Superamerica==
The 400 Superamerica debuted in 1959 as the production of the 410 ended, and was available as a coupe, spider, or cabriolet with custom Pinin Farina bodywork. It had the smaller &quot;Colombo&quot; engine, which had similar power output as its predecessor at at 7,000 rpm. Four-wheel disc brakes were a new addition. 47 units of the 400 Superamerica been built in two series of which 32 were the coupé aerodinamico variant. The Series I coupés aerodinamico had open hood air scoop while series II cars had covered scoop and slightly longer wheelbase. Production of the 400 Superamerica ended in 1964.

===400 Superamerica Pinin Farina Coupé Speciale===
A special one-off version of the 400 Superamerica, s/n 1517SA, was built in 1959 for Gianni Agnelli. This car was also the very first of the 400 Superamericas. A very similar body with its characteristic square grille, was used on Maserati 5000 GT that was also built for Agnelli.

===400 Superamerica Superfast II–IV===
Originally built as a Series I Ferrari 400 Superamerica Aerodinamico Pinin Farina Coupé, chassis no. 2207SA, was re-bodied and presented as &quot;Superfast II&quot; at the Torino Motor Show in 1960 and 1961. It was used by Battista &quot;Pinin&quot; Farina as his personal car. In 1961, the car was re-bodied into the &quot;Superfast III&quot; and presented at 1962 Geneva Motor Show and went through another final redesign final as the &quot;Superfast IV&quot;. It was a styling concept for the upcoming 500 Superfast model. Currently this show car can be seen on various events with its first styling.


==500 Superfast==

The final model in the flagship America series was the 500 Superfast, first unveiled at the 1964 Geneva Motor Show. During development these cars were to be called &quot;Superamerica&quot;, but the decision was made at the last moment to use &quot;Superfast&quot; instead.

The engine was a unique Ferrari Colombo V12 engine, which had the same 108 mm bore center dimensions as the Lampredi &quot;long-block&quot; engines of the 410 Superamerica, otherwise the design was based on the original Colombo &quot;short block&quot;. Breathing through six twin-choke Weber 40DCZ/6 carburettors, the V12 produced up to at 6,500 rpm and could push the car to . The chassis was very similar in construction to the contemporary 330 GT 2+2, and bodywork was now done by Pininfarina, with the cars being assembled in Turin. When leaving the factory the 500 Superfast originally fitted Pirelli Cinturato CN72 205 VR15 tyres. Depending on options, each car took 4 to 6 months to complete.

36 cars were made from 1964 to 1966, including 12 improved Series II models with a 5-speed transmission in place of the earlier 4-speed plus overdrive. The Series II cars can be recognized by having a triple louvre exhaust vent behind the front wheels, rather than the earlier 11-slot grilles. Unlike its predecessors, the 500 Superfast was only produced in the 2+2 coupe body style. The production total excludes a one-off 330 GT 2+2 produced with a Superfast-style body for Prince Bernhard of The Netherlands. This one-off was sold at the Bonhams&#x27; December 2003 Geneva auction for CHF 422,100 including premium. Famous owners of the car include Prince Karim Aga Khan who bought the first 500 Superfast and the Shah of Iran who owned two.


==365 California==

The 365 California replaced the 500 Superfast in 1966 and was built on the same ethos as the 250GT Spyder. It was the first model in the 365 series of cars, with its V12 based on the 330&#x27;s 4.0 L &quot;Colombo&quot; unit but with an 81 mm bore. The 365 California used the same chassis as the 500 Superfast but with an evolutionary cabriolet body by Pininfarina. Debuting at the Geneva Motor Show in 1966, just 14 examples were produced (including 2 in right hand drive) before production ended in 1967. Whilst the prototype was built on a 330 GT 2+2 type 571 chassis, production cars featured the type 598 chassis. The chassis were sent to Pininfarina&#x27;s Grugliasco plant to be bodied and trimmed and were then returned to Ferrari for fitment of the mechanical components. Desirable performance components like power steering and Borrani wire wheels were standard-equipment on the 365 California.

<text>EP Daily (formerly The Electric Playground) is a daily news television show that covers video games, movies, TV shows, comic books, collectibles and gadgets. Created and executive produced by host Victor Lucas, and his Vancouver, British Columbia production company EP Media Ltd (formerly Greedy Productions Ltd), &quot;EP Daily&quot; was a staple on airwaves since its debut in September 1997. The show continues to produce and publish content on the Electric Playground Network&#x27;s YouTube channel.

==Synopsis==

The show featured previews of upcoming video games, video game industry news, and interviews with celebrity gamers and people in the video game industry; as well as segments that look at the latest toys, games, comics, and gadgets. EP&#x27;s hosts travel the world bringing viewers behind the scenes of the global game business to meet the planet&#x27;s most respected video game creators. The show featured daily coverage from Vancouver, Toronto, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

==Cast/hosts==
Current cast and correspondents include: Victor Lucas, guest correspondent Johnny Millenium of Happy Console Gamer

Former cast, crew and correspondents have included: Tommy Tallarico, Julie Stoffer, Jade Raymond, Geoff Keighley, Jose &quot;Fubar&quot; Sanchez, Ben Silverman, Steve Tilley, Donna Mei-Ling Park, Kelly Benson, Briana McIvor, Shaun Hatton, Miri Jedeikin, Scott C. Jones, Marissa Roberto, Raju Mudhar, Zoe Flower and Evangeline Lilly.

&quot;The Electric Playground&quot; began its life as online news magazine founded by Victor Lucas, John Shaw and Torben Rolfsen before it was brought to television when the team was joined by Scott Barrett in 1997 – who remained with the show to direct the first two seasons. At the end of the second season, Scott accepted an offer to join Shiny Entertainment, so Victor took on triple duty as the show&#x27;s producer, director and host.

== History ==
&quot;EP Daily&quot; aired on G4 Canada and City. The show had previously been aired in Canada on Space, Razer, A Channel, and OMNI.1, and in the United States on The Science Channel and G4.

The Electric Playground began as a website (elecplay.com) in 1995. In September 1997 the show premiered in Canada and along the US west coast in a 30-minute weekly format.

In 2002, the reviews segment of the show, &quot;Reviews on the Run&quot;, was spun off into its own show. It was known as &quot;Judgment Day&quot; in the United States and &quot;Reviews on the Run&quot; in Canada. The final airing of Judgment Day on G4 was in December 2005. In 2010 &quot;Reviews on the Run&quot; was expanded out to a daily format. The show&#x27;s website was &quot;reviewsontherun.com&quot;. Reviews on the Run ended in 2014 after 13 seasons.

On December 31, 2006, Lucas announced on the &quot;EP Daily&quot; forums that Greedy Productions had cancelled its contract with CHUM television, which had broadcast &quot;Electric Playground&quot; and &quot;Reviews on the Run&quot; on SPACE and A-Channel, and signed a two-year exclusive deal with Rogers Communications, to broadcast the shows on G4 Canada and then additionally on other Rogers owned TV stations. &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; aired only once on OMNI.1, on September 3, 2007.

On December 15, 2007, the series premiered on City Toronto and City Vancouver, airing episodes that had aired on G4 Canada.

In August 2008, EP Daily premiered in a daily format. The Electric Playground remained weekly, wrapping up the week in video games, technology, and entertainment.

Beginning on December 1, 2010, EP Daily airs every weeknight at 8pm on SCI FI Channel Australia. This ceased on December 31, 2013, when SFTV Australia was closed after the owners of the channel failed to reach an agreement with Foxtel, and has now been replaced by NBC Universal&#x27;s Syfy Australia 

In September 2010, the show returned to America on ABC stations in select cities in the United States. It featured two specials that aired on Sunday, January 16, 2011: &quot;Everythings Cool Awards&quot; and &quot;Cool Things For 2011&quot;. Weekly episodes began airing in September 2011. Each episode is an hour split into two parts, either airing back to back or at separate times, depending on the station that&#x27;s airing the show. Daily episodes began airing on select stations on September 3, 2012. As of January 2015, none of the USA broadcasters including Reelz and Youtoo channels were continuing to broadcast EP Daily in the US markets. Some of the American stations replaced &quot;EP Daily&quot; with televised versions of &quot;Q&quot; starting in September 2014.

The show was known as &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; until July 2012, at which point the name was changed to &quot;EP Daily&quot;.

Late in 2014, Shaun Hatton left the series and Reelz has decided not to renew the series on the network. The show went on hiatus in 2015.

As of 2016, &quot;EP Daily&quot; no longer airs on G4 and City. The show continues to produce content, such as daily Rundown segments and interviews, on the Electric Playground Network&#x27;s YouTube channel. Since then, Victor Lucas has been looking for new partners to support the show.

==Details==
The project was started by Jacques Gélinas. It is now maintained by Herbert Pötzl. It is not related to the Linux Virtual Server project, which implements network load balancing.

Linux-VServer is a jail mechanism in that it can be used to securely partition resources on a computer system (such as the file system, CPU time, network addresses and memory) in such a way that processes cannot mount a denial-of-service attack on anything outside their partition.

Each partition is called a &quot;security context&quot;, and the virtualized system within it is the &quot;virtual private server&quot;. A chroot-like utility for descending into security contexts is provided. Booting a virtual private server is then simply a matter of kickstarting init in a new security context; likewise, shutting it down simply entails killing all processes with that security context. The contexts themselves are robust enough to boot many Linux distributions unmodified, including Debian and Fedora.

Virtual private servers are commonly used in web hosting services, where they are useful for segregating customer accounts, pooling resources and containing any potential security breaches. To save space on such installations, each virtual server&#x27;s file system can be created as a tree of copy-on-write hard links to a &quot;template&quot; file system. The hard link is marked with a special filesystem attribute and when modified, is securely and transparently replaced with a real copy of the file.

Linux-VServer provides two branches, stable (2.2.x), and devel (2.3.x) for 2.6-series kernels and a single stable branch for 2.4-series. A separate stable branch integrating the grsecurity patch set is also available.

==Advantages==
* Virtual servers share the same system call interface and do not have any emulation overhead.
* Virtual servers do not have to be backed by opaque disk images, but can share a common file system and common sets of files (through copy-on-write hard links). This makes it easier to back up a system and to pool disk space amongst virtual servers.
* Processes within the virtual server run as regular processes on the host system. This is somewhat more memory-efficient and I/O-efficient than whole-system emulation, although memory ballooning and modern VMs allow returning unused memory and sharing disk cache with the host and other virtual servers.
* Processes within the virtual server are queued on the same scheduler as on the host, allowing guest&#x27;s processes to run concurrently on SMP systems. This is not trivial to implement with whole-system emulation.
* Networking is based on isolation rather than virtualization, so there is no additional overhead for packets.
* Smaller plane for security bugs. Only one kernel with small additional code-base compared to 2+ kernels and large interfaces between them.
* Rich Linux scheduling features such as real-time priorities.

==Disadvantages==
* Requires that the host kernel be patched.
* No clustering or process migration capability is included, so the host kernel and host computer is still a single point of failure for all virtual servers.
* Networking is based on isolation, not virtualization. This prevents each virtual server from creating its own internal routing or firewalling setup.
* Some system calls (mostly hardware-related: e.g. real-time clock) and parts of the /proc and /sys filesystems are left unvirtualized.
* Does not allow disk I/O bandwidth to be allocated on a per-virtual server basis.

<doc id="1191528" wikidata="Q2270077" url="?curid=1191528" title="Wolf Lake">
<text>Wolf Lake is an American supernatural drama television series that originally aired on CBS from September 19 to October 24, 2001. Nine episodes were produced, but only five aired before the series was canceled by CBS. The full series, including the four unaired episodes, was later picked up and broadcast on UPN in April–May 2002. &quot;Wolf Lake&quot; depicts a pack of werewolves living in a Seattle suburb.

==Summary==
Seattle policeman John Kanin proposes marriage to his girlfriend, Ruby Wilder, and she accepts. However, as she gets into her car, she is attacked. The only thing Kanin finds of his now fiancee, is a severed hand. He travels to her hometown of Wolf Lake to find some answers. However, his experiences there raise even more questions. What John doesn&#x27;t know is that some of the inhabitants of Wolf Lake are actually werewolves. The werewolves, or the ones who survive the change, live on the &quot;Hill&quot; and enjoy special treatment, separated from the normal humans.

==Episodes==
The first five episodes of &quot;Wolf Lake&quot; aired on CBS in September–October 2001, before CBS pulled the series from the air. The series later was reaired on UPN, with the final four episodes debuting on UPN in April–May 2002.

==Broadcast==
ITV bought the rights to show the series in the United Kingdom. In August 2006, the Sci Fi Channel bought the syndication rights to reair the series in the United States.

==Home media==
The series was made available on DVD in 2012.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an aggregated score of 20% based on 2 positive and 8 negative critic reviews. The website’s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Wolf Lake&quot;&#x27;s ill-defined story and uninvolving sense of mystery make it a yawn-inducing watch.&quot;

While Ron Wertheimer of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said it was &quot;a promisingly quirky pilot&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot;″s Michael Speier remarked that it &quot;sometimes works as high drama but sometimes comes off as extremely silly&quot;.

While the series was poorly rated, it received two Emmy nominations, for Outstanding Main Title Design and Outstanding Main Title Theme Music.
