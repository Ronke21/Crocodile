<text>This is a list of Sixth-rate, corvette, and sloop classes of the Royal Navy.

During the Age of Sail, warships were divided into ranks or classes. The English Royal Navy adopted a scheme of six classes or &quot;rates&quot; in 1626. This system was in place until the 1840s, when steam power was introduced. The vessels classed as &quot;Sixth-rates&quot; were used in trade protection and at times could be used as scouts for the fleet (a task normally associated with &quot;Fifth-rates&quot;). In 1626, a &quot;Sixth-rate&quot; was defined as a ship having a crew of 40 to 50 men. In 1653, this was changed, to from 40 up to 79 men. After the Restoration in 1660, a &quot;Sixth-rate&quot; carried up to 24 guns, though 18 to 20 was more common. By the end of the 1600s, the crew size had grown to over 100 men, with a flush deck battery of six pound guns. By the 1750s, a &quot;Sixth-rate&quot; would carry up to 28 guns. In the mid 18th-century, the definition was formally established based on ship size, armament, and crew size.

With the advent of steam assisted and steam powered vessels, the term &quot;Sixth-rate&quot; was replaced by &quot;Sloop&quot; as an official type of ship in the Royal Navy. The term &quot;Corvette&quot;, adopted from the French, was not adopted as an official ship type until 1862. This only lasted until 1888 when it was replaced by the term &quot;Third Class Cruiser&quot;. The term sloop returned during World War I for vessels dedicated to convoy escort. It remained in use until the 1960s. The term corvette did not reappear as an official ship type until just before the start of World War II, as a convoy escort vessel, and is still used in some navies today.

Note that vessels captured from other countries and incorporated into the Royal Navy were rated in accordance with the ship rating classification.

=== World War II corvettes ===

After more than half a century, the category of corvette was revived during World War II to designate a smaller form of escort vessel than the existing sloops. It was thus not comparable with the pre-1887 corvettes in the Royal Navy. Two classes of wartime corvette were designed and built in considerable numbers (see separate articles):

* – 267 ships, 1939–1945
* – 44 ships, 1943–1944

== Sloop classes ==

=== Sloops (early single-masted type)===

Note that early sloops were single-masted, including (initially) the &quot;Swift&quot;, &quot;Jamaica&quot;, and &quot;Hazard&quot; groups listed below for 1700–1711; however, all surviving sloops by 1716 had been re-rigged as two-masted, and all new sloops continued to be two-masted until the 1750s, when three-masted – ship-rigged – sloops were introduced.
* &quot;Swift&quot; group – 3 vessels, 1704
** &quot;Swift&quot; (1704) – sold 1719.

** &quot;Happy&quot; (1711) – rebuilt 1724–25.

=== Two-masted sloops (to 1732) ===

All early two-masted sloops were mainly either ketch-rigged or snow-rigged.

* &quot;Drake&quot; – 1 brig-rigged vessel, 1705 – rebuilt 1728
* &quot;Trial&quot; – 1 vessel, 1719 (rebuilt from 1709 vessel) – BU 1731.

===Two-masted sloops (1739 to 1745)===

From the outbreak of the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear in 1739, the Navy recognised that there was a growing need for smaller vessels for amphibious operations, as escorts for commercial traffic, and for minor combatant roles. Over the next six years, some 36 specialist vessels were procured (34 designed by the Navy and 2 purchased on the stocks where builders had begun them as speculative ventures), as listed below; of these, the first four were essentially repeats of the previous group of 200-ton sloops of 1732, while the later vessels were progressively enlarged. In addition, a small number were captured from the Spanish during this era, and a dozen bomb vessels of similar construction supplemented the purpose-built sloops in a cruising role.
* &quot;Drake&quot; class – 3 vessels, 1741
** &quot;Drake&quot; (1741) – wrecked 1742.

<text>Martin O&#x27;Meara, VC (6 November 1885 – 20 December 1935) was an Irish-born Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==

O&#x27;Meara was born at Lorrha, County Tipperary. He spent his early years in County Tipperary and by 1911 had moved to County Kilkenny where he was working as a wood cutter.

He arrived in South Australia in 1912, where he initially worked as a labourer at Wild Horse Plains. He then travelled to Port Augusta where he worked as a labourer on railway construction projects, and then to the McLaren Vale area south of Adelaide where he was, again, a railway construction worker.

He travelled to Western Australia in 1914 and worked as a labourer in the Pinjarra area before making his way to the Collie area.

He was working as a sleeper cutter near Collie before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force on 19 August 1915.

==First World War==
Assigned to 16th Battalion as a private, O&#x27;Meara sailed from Fremantle on the troopship &quot;Ajana&quot; on 22 December 1915. He arrived at Port Suez in Egypt on 13 January 1916. He initially served with the 16th Battalion in Egypt as an infantryman and as a machine gunner with the 4th Machine Gun Company before arriving in France on 7 June 1916.

In late June 1916 he joined the 16th Battalion&#x27;s newly formed Scouting Section in northern France and served as a scout, observer and sniper during his time on the Western Front in Belgium and France.

Between 9 and 12 August 1916 at Mouquet Farm, Pozières, during four days of very heavy fighting, Private O&#x27;Meara repeatedly went out and brought in wounded officers and men from &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot; under intense artillery and machine-gun fire. He also volunteered and carried up ammunition and bombs through a heavy barrage to a portion of the trenches which was being heavily shelled at the time.

O&#x27;Meara was wounded three times during the war: near Mouquet farm in August 1916, near Bullecourt in April 1917 and near Messines in August 1917.

He was presented with his Victoria Cross medal by King George V at Buckingham Palace on 21 July 1917.

In mid-1918 he was selected to join a group of Australian Victoria Cross recipients to return to Australia to assist with recruiting. He was promoted to Sergeant in late August 1918 and left England on 17 September 1918 on the troopship &quot;Arawa&quot;, arriving at Fremantle in Western Australia on 6 November 1918. On 7 November 1918 the &quot;Arawa&quot; passengers were quarantined at Woodman&#x27;s Point south of Perth because of a suspected influenza outbreak.

==Later life==
O&#x27;Meara had a mental breakdown in November 1918 at the Woodman&#x27;s Point Quarantine Station south of Perth, shortly after arriving in Western Australia. On 13 November 1918 he was transported to the 24th Australian Auxiliary Hospital, Stromness, where he was diagnosed on 19 December 1918 as:
O&#x27;Meara was transferred to the Claremont Hospital for the Insane on 3 January 1919, and to the newly constructed Lemnos Soldier&#x27;s Hospital on 20 September 1926. He remained at Lemnos until returning to the Claremont hospital shortly before his death in December 1935 at the age of 50 years. His body was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery, Perth, Western Australia.

==The medal==
O&#x27;Meara&#x27;s Victoria Cross is held in the collections of the Army Museum of Western Australia in Fremantle. In July 2019 it was loaned by the Australian government to the National Museum of Ireland, where it will be on public display for twelve months. The loan required an amendment to the &quot;Protection of Moveable Cultural Heritage Act&quot; (1986) to allow for the &quot;temporary export of important cultural artefacts&quot;.

<text>John Ripley VC (20 August 1867 – 14 August 1933) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to members of British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Ripley was born in Keith, Banffshire, Scotland on 20 August 1867. On leaving school he had a number of jobs, finally becoming a slater, settling in St Andrews, Fife. In June 1895, he married Jane Laing, a domestic servant. They had a son, Alexander, who served in the 7th Battalion, Black Watch during the First World War.

In 1884, Ripley joined the part-time Volunteer Force. He served for many years in the 6th Volunteer Battalion, Black Watch, becoming a sergeant and one of his company&#x27;s best shots. He received the Volunteer Long Service Medal in January 1909, and retired in 1912.

On the outbreak of the First World War in the summer of 1914, he volunteered as a recruiting sergeant, before enlisting for active service on 25 September 1914. He went to France with the 1st Battalion, Black Watch in mid-February 1915, with the rank of corporal.

==VC action==
He was 47 years old, and a corporal in the 1st Battalion, The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment), British Army at the battle of Aubers Ridge when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

On 9 May 1915 at Rue du Bois, France, Corporal Ripley led his section on the right of the platoon in the assault and was the first man of the battalion to climb the enemy&#x27;s parapet. From there he directed those following him to the gaps in the German wire entanglements. He then led his section through a breach in the parapet to a second line of trench. With seven or eight men he established himself, blocking other flanks, and continued to hold the position until all his men had fallen and he himself was badly wounded in the head.

The VC was presented to him by King George V at Buckingham Palace on 12 July 1915.

At 47, Ripley was the oldest recipient to win the VC during the First World War.

==Later life==
Recovering from his wounds, Ripley was appointed acting sergeant in July 1915 and undertook recruiting duties in Edinburgh. Discharged from the army in March 1919, he returned to work as a slater, also sweeping chimneys and serving in the town&#x27;s fire brigade. He was later given the Freedom of St Andrews.

While working as a slater in August 1933, Ripley fell from a ladder and seriously injured his spine. He died shortly after admission to hospital, aged 65. He was buried in Upper Largo Cemetery, Fife.

His medals are currently held privately.

<doc id="1220281" wikidata="Q7679410" url="?curid=1220281" title="Tales of the South Pacific">
<text>Tales of the South Pacific is a Pulitzer Prize-winning collection of sequentially related short stories by James A. Michener about the Pacific campaign in World War II. The stories are based on observations and anecdotes he collected while stationed as a lieutenant commander in the US Navy at the Espiritu Santo Naval Base on the island of Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides Islands (now known as Vanuatu).
Written in 1946 and published in 1947, the book was loosely adapted in 1949 as the Broadway musical &quot;South Pacific&quot;, which itself formed the basis of two films dating from 1958 and 2001.

==Book==
The stories take place in the environs of the Coral Sea and the Solomon Islands. Michener as narrator gives a first-person voice to several of the stories as an unnamed &quot;Commander&quot;, performing duties similar to those that he himself performed during World War II. Two stories are narrated by a named Navy pilot.

The stories are interconnected by recurring characters and several loose plot lines. One plot line in particular is the preparation for and execution of a fictitious amphibious invasion, code-named &quot;Alligator&quot;. The focus of the stories is, however, the interactions between Americans and a variety of colonial, immigrant, and indigenous characters.

The chronology of the stories begins with the building of an airfield on Norfolk Island before the Battle of the Coral Sea, in 1942, and goes through the early 1944 invasion of one of Michener&#x27;s fictional islands. Although the stories are primarily about the U.S. Navy, most of the action is shore-based, and none of the stories concerns ships larger than a Landing Craft Infantry.

=== Structure ===
Tales of the South Pacific comprises nineteen stories, which are thematically linked in pairs: the first and final stories are reflective, the second and eighteenth involve battle, the third and seventeenth involve preparation for battle, and so on. 
=== Recurring Characters ===
The following characters appear in more than 2 stories:

Tony Fry (Navy): Stories 3, 5, 12 and 13. 

Bus Adams (Navy pilot): Stories 6, 13, 14 and 15. 

Luther Billis (SeaBee): Stories 9, 12 and 14.

==Adaptations==

===Musical ===
The highly successful musical play &quot;South Pacific&quot; by Rodgers and Hammerstein, which opened on Broadway on April 7, 1949, was based on the stories in &quot;Tales of the South Pacific.&quot; In particular, the stories used were &quot;Fo&#x27; Dolla&#x27;&quot;, about Bloody Mary, Liat, and Lieutenant Joe Cable; and &quot;Our Heroine&quot;, about Nellie Forbush and Emile de Becque. Characters from other stories, such as Bill Harbison, Bus Adams, and Luther Billis, play minor or supporting roles.

Some of the characters from the stories were merged and simplified to serve the format of the musical. For example, the coastwatcher in the musical is an American Marine (Lt. Cable) assisted by an expatriate French plantation owner (Emile de Becque). In Michener&#x27;s short story &quot;The Cave&quot; the coastwatcher is an English expatriate assisted by native islanders, and is a disembodied voice on a short-wave radio identifying himself only as &quot;The Remittance Man&quot;. He is never seen by the other characters in Michener&#x27;s short story until a search-and-rescue party finds his head impaled on a stake. The character of Liat, Cable&#x27;s lover in the film, is a much more sophisticated and intelligent young woman in the book, but is reduced to a childlike caricature in the movie. The character of Emile de Becque in Michener&#x27;s short story has eight mixed-race daughters by four different women, none of whom he married, when he meets the nurse Ensign Nellie Forbush; in the musical, he has two children (one daughter and one son) by a Polynesian woman whom he had married but who had died.

====Films of the musical====
The Rodgers and Hammerstein musical &quot;South Pacific&quot; was made into a feature film in 1958 with scenes shot on Kauai. It was adapted as a made-for television film 2001 filmed in Queensland and Moorea.

===Television===
American television producer Bob Mann wanted Michener to co-create a weekly television anthology series from &quot;Tales of the South Pacific,&quot; with Michener as narrator. Rodgers and Hammerstein, however, owned all dramatic rights to the novel and did not give up ownership. Michener did lend his name as the creator of a different and unrelated television series, &quot;Adventures in Paradise,&quot; in 1959. The series had nothing to do with World War II, but rather followed the fictional adventures of a current-day schooner sailing around the South Pacific.

<text>Jeffrey Steven Franklin (born January 21, 1955) is an American screenwriter, director and producer. He is best known for being the creator of the ABC sitcom &quot;Full House&quot; and its Netflix sequel &quot;Fuller House&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Franklin was born in Inglewood, California, and raised in a Jewish family. In 1976 Franklin graduated from Raymond College at the University of the Pacific. He studied media production at UCLA while working as a substitute teacher in his hometown, before becoming a writer.

== Career ==
Franklin began his television career as a writer and producer for &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; and &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot;. Franklin pitched his own show to ABC called &quot;House of Comics&quot; which featured three comics living together. ABC was looking for a family sitcom, so Franklin added children and the idea evolved into the show &quot;Full House&quot;, which ran on the ABC network from 1987 to 1995.

During &quot;Full House&quot;, Franklin created &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot;, starring comedian Mark Curry. Franklin departed for &quot;Hanging with Mr. Cooper&quot; in September 1992. His other TV credits include both writing and production on shows such as, &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot;, and &quot;Malcolm &amp; Eddie&quot;. He also wrote, produced and directed the first Olsen twins movie, &quot;To Grandmother&#x27;s House We Go&quot;. By 1991, Jeff Franklin had received a deal with Lorimar, but the pact was terminated in 1993 so that he could become an independent producer. In 1997, he had signed a deal with Columbia TriStar Television.

Franklin&#x27;s most notable film writing credits include the teen comedies &quot;Just One of the Guys&quot; (1985) and &quot;Summer School&quot; (1987), starring Mark Harmon.

On April 20, 2015, Netflix announced the streaming service would pick up thirteen episodes of &quot;Fuller House&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Full House&quot;. Netflix also announced Franklin would oversee the production along with Robert L. Boyett and Thomas L. Miller. All 13 episodes of the first season premiered on February 26, 2016. The series ended in its fifth season on June 2, 2020, supposedly due to competition and an inability to grow its audience significantly.

=== Firing from Fuller House ===
In February 2018, Franklin was fired from the series &quot;Fuller House&quot;.

In June 2019, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; revealed details of a probe made by Warner Brothers that included interviews with eight &quot;Fuller House&quot; staffers who commented on Franklin&#x27;s alleged conduct. 

Jeff Franklin sued the showrunner, blaming the co-executive producer Bryan Behar for orchestrating a conspiracy aiming to get him kicked out of the show, to discredit Franklin and replace him. Franklin denied all the allegations of misconduct.

== Personal life ==
In 1994, Franklin bought 10050 Cielo Drive, the site of the Tate murders in 1969. The French country-style home was eventually demolished and replaced by a mansion designed by architect Richard Landry. In 2014, he listed for sale another house designed by Landry in the Hollywood Hills for US$30 million.

<doc id="1220289" wikidata="Q1403952" url="?curid=1220289" title="Rob Andrew">
<text>Christopher Robert Andrew (born 18 February 1963) is a former English rugby union player who as a fly-half played 71 Tests for England between 1985 and 1997. Since his retirement from playing he has held administration roles in both rugby and cricket. He was formerly the Director of Rugby of Newcastle Falcons and Professional Rugby Director at the RFU. He was Chief Executive of Sussex County Cricket Club before joining the England and Wales Cricket Board in 2024 as Managing Director of the professional game.

As a player, Andrew was assured in his kicking and defensive skills off both feet. Andrew also had a brief career in first-class cricket whilst at University and played for Yorkshire County Cricket Club&#x27;s Second XI.

Andrew was born in Richmond, North Yorkshire, England on 18 February 1963.

==Rugby career==

===Domestic===
Andrew attended Barnard Castle School, where he was contemporary with future teammate Rory Underwood and was captain of the school 1st XV in 1981. Whilst in the northeast, both Underwood and Andrew played their rugby at Middlesbrough RUFC. Andrew then attended St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and played for Cambridge University in the Varsity Match.

He joined Nottingham for one season in 1985/86 and then joined Wasps FC where he was first choice fly-half throughout most of the eight seasons he spent with the north London club. At Wasps FC he won the English League in 1990, eventually leaving to join Newcastle Gosforth in 1995 as both a player and as director of rugby.

The club had just been bought out by Sir John Hall in the lead-up to the game turning professional; they became the Falcons of today. During his time in charge of Newcastle Falcons he is credited with discovering Jonny Wilkinson. In 1991 he joined the famous Stade Toulousain (France) for one season. He was an ever-present when Newcastle Falcons won the 1997-98 Premiership.
His playing career was ended in 1999 after an injury in training.

===International===
Andrew was fly-half for England during the Will Carling era, making a winning debut in January 1985 against Romania at Twickenham. For the next 10 years he was England&#x27;s regular fly-half earning 70 caps, including 2 as captain. He was briefly dropped in 1993 as England tried out Bath RFC&#x27;s Stuart Barnes for the fly-half&#x27;s position, but regained it after two matches. After England finished 4th in the 1995 Rugby World Cup, he saw out his contract at Wasps and moved to the Newcastle Falcons. He made his final appearance for England after an absence of almost two years when he was called off the bench as a try scoring replacement against Wales in March 1997. In total, he scored 396 international points, won the Grand Slam with England 3 times and held the English record for the most points scored in an international - 30, scored against Canada in 1994.

Critics of the England side blamed him for kicking the ball too much rather than passing - perhaps unfairly since England three times broke the Five Nations records for tries scored, and points scored, with Andrew as fly-half (in 1990 despite not even winning the tournament, and again in 1992 and 1995): however it was undeniable that England&#x27;s game plan was based very much more around their forwards than their backs, with kicking for territory and competing to win line-outs and rucks in opposition territory being a major part of the tactic. England did, however, enjoy a great deal of success with him as their Number 10.

Inconsistent early in his career as a place-kicker for penalties and conversions, and often ceding that duty to fullbacks Webb and Hodgkinson (only to have to take some kicks anyway, when Webb also proved inconsistent early in his own career), Andrew improved that aspect of his game greatly, until by the end of his career he was among the best in the world at it, as well as being a reliable source of dropped-goals.

He played in 3 Rugby World Cup competitions; 1987 (making 2 appearances), 1991 and 1995. Curiously, just as Wilkinson had beaten Australia in the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final with a drop goal, the last time Australia lost in the same competition was in 1995. In that year, it was Andrew who nailed a drop goal on the stroke of full-time to beat the Wallabies 25–22. Four years before, it was another late drop-goal by Andrew, in the semi-final against Scotland, that took England to the final against Australia.

In 1989 he had the honour of captaining the British and Irish Lions against France in a rare &quot;home&quot; match for the Lions. The game formed part of the celebrations of the bi-centennial of the French Revolution. In the final match, against ANZAC, of the Lions&#x27; victorious &#x27;89 tour to Australia, Andrew came on at inside center as a substitute for the injured Brendan Mullen. Andrew also toured to New Zealand with the Lions in 1993, starting at flyhalf over his England rival Barnes. The Lions lost the test series to New Zealand 2–1.

===Post playing===
Andrew remained as director of rugby at Newcastle Falcons after the injury that ended his playing career until on
18 August 2006 he was appointed by the RFU to undertake the post of Director of Elite Rugby to oversee all aspects of representative rugby in England, from the regional academies to the full senior side.

On 6 January 2011, Andrew&#x27;s role as director of elite rugby at the Rugby Football Union was scrapped in an overhaul of the organisation&#x27;s structure. It was reported that Andrew was invited to apply for one of the new roles created by this process, that of operations director. At a press conference on 16 November 2011 Andrew&#x27;s position was described as Director of Elite Rugby and he reportedly took several attempts to (inconclusively) describe his responsibilities. He resigned as the RFU&#x27;s director of professional rugby in February 2016.

On 10 November 2017, Andrew was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame at a ceremony held in the Hall&#x27;s facility in Rugby.

==Cricket career==
Andrew was also a talented cricketer, gaining a Cambridge blue for that sport as well, and he made 17 first-class cricket appearances for the university cricket team in 1984 and 1985, as well as playing five times for Combined Universities in one-day cricket. A left-handed batsman and right arm off-break bowler, he made one first-class century, scoring 101 not out against Nottinghamshire in July 1984. Andrew also made a few appearances for the Yorkshire Second XI, and on one occasion dismissed future England captain Mike Atherton (then aged 17) for a duck.

In November 2016, Andrew was appointed chief executive of Sussex County Cricket Club. After seven years in the role he joined the England and Wales Cricket Board as Managing Director of the professional game.

==Off the field==
Andrew is an Honorary President of the rugby charity Wooden Spoon, which raises funds for disadvantaged children and young people in the UK and Ireland.

<text>William Norman VC (1832 – 13 March 1896) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was born in Warrington, Lancashire and enlisted as a private in the 7th Regiment of Foot (later the Royal Fusiliers) of the British Army on 15 May 1854. During the Crimean War the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 19 December 1854 at Sebastopol, in the Crimea, Private Norman was placed on single sentry duty some distance in front of the advanced sentries of an outlying picquet in the White Horse Ravine, a post of much danger and requiring great vigilance. The Russian picquet was posted about 300 yards in front of him, and three Russians came reconnoitring under cover of the brushwood. Private Norman single-handedly took two of them prisoner without alarming the Russian picquet. He was decorated by Queen Victoria in Hyde Park on 26 June 1857.
He later served in the Umbeyla Campaign on the North-West Frontier in 1863 and achieved the rank of corporal. He left the Army in 1865.

He died on 13 March 1896 in Salford, Lancashire and is buried in a common grave at Weaste Cemetery, Salford. He was married with three children. His Victoria Cross and other medals are displayed at the Royal Fusiliers Museum in the Tower of London, England.

<text>James Ockendon VC, MM (10 December 1890 – 29 August 1966) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early years==
He was one of nine children born to Alfred and Mary Ockendon at 56, Alfred Street, Landport. He attended St Agatha&#x27;s School, following which he worked for Chalcraft&#x27;s, a draper in Russell Street, Portsmouth. After working here for five years he joined the Royal Dublin Fusiliers in 1909 as a private. After completing his basic training at the Victoria Barracks in Southsea he served in India. During World War I Ockendon saw action in Turkey during the Gallipoli Campaign where, on 24 April 1915, he landed with his battalion on ‘V’ beach and received a bullet wound to his forehead.

Following his recuperation he served in Egypt. While on leave he married Caroline (&quot;Carrie&quot;) Anne at St Luke&#x27;s Church in Portsmouth on 20 August 1917. They had four children. Soon after his marriage he joined the First Battalion at the Western Front in France where he was awarded the Military Medal for bravery on 28 September 1917 during the opening stages of the Third Battle of Ypres.

==Citation==
Ockendon was 26 years old and a sergeant in the 1st Battalion, The Royal Dublin Fusiliers, British Army when the following deed led to the award of the Victoria Cross. On 4 October 1917 east of Langemarck, Belgium, Sergeant Ockendon was acting as company sergeant-major. Seeing the platoon on the right held up by an enemy machine-gun, he immediately rushed the gun and captured it, killing the crew. He then led a section to the attack on a farm, where under very heavy fire he rushed forward and called on the garrison to surrender. As the enemy continued to fire on him he opened fire, killing four, whereupon the remaining 16 surrendered.

==Later life==
The awarding of his Victoria Cross was published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 5th November 1917 and he was presented with the award by George V at Buckingham Palace on 5th December 1917. In April 1918, he was awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre, and in the same month he was honourably discharged from the army on medical grounds.

After the war, he was employed in the dockyard as a crane driver and after he retired from such employment, he worked as a school caretaker and then at No3 Training Battalion, Royal Army Ordnance Corps in Hilsea. During World War II Ockendon served in the Portsmouth Division of the Home Guard. His portrait by the artist Eric Kennington was reproduced in &quot;Britain&#x27;s Home Guard&quot; written by John Brophy and published in 1945.

He died in his home at Southsea on 29 August 1966 and his funeral took place at Portchester on 1 September. His ashes were scattered in the Garden of Remembrance. In 1962 Ockendon Close was named in his honour.

==Medals==
Ockendon&#x27;s medals are: Victoria Cross, Military Medal, 1914 Star, British War Medal, Victory Medal with MiD Oakleaf, Defence Medal (1939–45), King George VI Coronation Medal (1937), Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal (1953), Croix de Guerre (Belgium). The medals, still in the possession of his granddaughter, were shown and discussed on the BBC Television programme &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; in May 2022.

<text>Sergeant Edward John Mott VC DCM (4 July 1893 – 20 October 1967) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in Drayton he enlisted in The Border Regiment in 1910, and in 1915, took part in the ill-fated Dardanelles Expedition, after which he served in Egypt and then on the Western Front.

He was 23 years old and a Sergeant in the 1st Battalion, The Border Regiment, British Army when he was awarded the VC.

On 27 January 1917 south of Le Transloy, France, an attack by Sergeant Mott&#x27;s company was held up at a strong-point by machine-gun fire. Although severely wounded in the eye, Sergeant Mott made a rush for the gun and after a fierce struggle seized the gunner and took him prisoner, capturing the gun. It was due to the dash and initiative of this NCO that the left flank attack succeeded.

==The Medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.

<doc id="1220298" wikidata="Q1683939" url="?curid=1220298" title="Jason Leonard">
<text>Jason Leonard (born 14 August 1968) is an English former rugby union player. He won a then-record 114 caps for England men’s rugby team during a 14-year international career.

A prop, Leonard played club rugby for Barking RFC, Saracens and Harlequins. He played in England teams which won four Grand Slams (1991, 1992, 1995 and 2003) and the 2003 Rugby World Cup, and played for the British &amp; Irish Lions on three tours, winning five more caps. He was part of the Lions squad that won the test series during their 1997 tour of South Africa.

He was awarded the MBE for services to rugby in 2002, and an OBE after England&#x27;s Rugby World Cup success. He was also inducted to the World Rugby Hall of Fame in 2014.

Since his retirement in 2004, Leonard has been active in the governance of rugby. He was President of the RFU (2015–2016), and Chairman of the British &amp; Irish Lions (2019–2022), succeeded by Ieuan Evans.

In 2008, Leonard joined Besso Group, and has since worked as a senior advisor for the established Lloyd&#x27;s broker. Leonard has launched his own special event service, the FunBus.

==Club rugby==
Leonard&#x27;s lengthy career straddled both the amateur and professional eras and he had a job as a carpenter. He began playing for his home club, Barking and his school teams as a youth, and as his playing talents became recognised, interest was shown by London club Saracens, where he moved in 1989. Following a year at Saracens, he moved to Harlequins, where he stayed until his professional retirement in May 2004, making a total of 290 appearances for the team.

==England career==

===1990–1993===
Leonard won his first cap on 28 July 1990, against Argentina in Buenos Aires. At the age of 22 he was the youngest prop forward to ever play for England (until 24/10/24 when Asher Opoko-Forjour won his first cap for England as Tight-Head, coming on in the 54th minute at 20 years of age). The visitors were made to feel unwelcome, however, as the game was played on the 8th anniversary of the Falklands War. Leonard describes in his autobiography that the crowd were throwing oranges (among other things) at the England players. The most interesting object he saw on the pitch was a bathroom tap. England eventually won the game 25–12; it proved a baptism of fire for the young Leonard.

Leonard played his whole England career in a largely dominant pack and in his early career played with established forwards such as Brian Moore, Wade Dooley, Dean Richards, Mick Skinner, Mike Teague and Peter Winterbottom. The England pack of this era helped England Rugby win much success, often playing a limited 10-man game that suited the large and physical England forwards.

During this period, England won back-to-back Grand Slams in 1991 and 1992. Despite losing the opening pool match to New Zealand 18–12, England made it to the Rugby World Cup Final in 1991, losing 12–6 to pre-tournament favourites Australia. In that game, England played open rugby, like they had in the Five Nations in 1990, although it was the forward-dominated 10-man game which earlier in 1991 had won them the Five Nations Grand Slam, as well as the quarter-final against France and semi-final against Scotland.

Against Wales in 1992, Leonard suffered a neck injury: he experienced a numbing sensation in his right arm, but had no idea he had ruptured a vertebra in his neck, so played out the remainder of the match. Later, he required emergency surgery, where bone from his hip had to be grafted into his neck. Leonard&#x27;s career was in grave doubt, after only 10 tests. Due to brilliant surgery and his rehabilitation regime, however, he made a full recovery, winning his 11th cap against Canada at Twickenham that autumn without missing an England test.

In 1993, Leonard was selected for his first British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand.

===1995–1997===
With Dick Best no longer England head coach, the RFU appointed well-known and highly successful Bath coach Jack Rowell as his replacement. There was much speculation amongst many established England players as to what changes the new coach would bring to the England setup, particularly one with such close ties to a successful Bath Rugby Club. Rowell claimed he would rid England of the cautious, forward-dominated 10-man game which had done so well for them earlier in the decade, and play running rugby more similar to Bath&#x27;s. Leonard kept his place in the England team, which now included several new players such as Mike Catt, Ben Clarke, Victor Ubogu, Steve Ojomoh (all Bath players) and Tim Rodber. In the 1995 Five Nations, Leonard won a record (for a prop) 38th cap for England, playing against Scotland, and the victory meant his third Grand Slam.

England held high hopes for the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa. At the World Cup, England were drawn in Pool B, generally regarded as one of the easier groups in the competition. However, England experienced setbacks, gaining only narrow victories over Argentina (24–18) and Italy (27–20). In England&#x27;s final pool match against Western Samoa, Leonard was rested and his record of 40 consecutive England caps ended. England won that match 44–22 and also won the subsequent quarter-final against Australia 25–22, before losing the semi-final to New Zealand 29–45 and finishing the tournament in fourth place.

In November 1996, Leonard skippered England for the first time, against Argentina at Twickenham. The game was very close, with Argentina taking a narrow lead close to full-time. From a rolling maul, Leonard scored a try to level the scores, and a Mike Catt penalty won the game 20–18. The try remains Leonard&#x27;s only score for England.

In the 1996–1997 season, Leonard began to play for England at tighthead prop (number 3) to make room for Leicester Tigers loosehead prop (number 1), Graham Rowntree, and in 1997, Leonard was selected for his second British and Irish Lions tour, this time to South Africa.

In September 1997, the RFU appointed Clive Woodward as head coach. The Autumn internationals saw England playing Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Against Australia, Leonard found himself selected at loosehead prop again, with Wasps&#x27; Will Green winning his first cap at tighthead. For the remaining two tests, Leonard was moved back to tighthead. The ability to scrummage effectively on either side of the scrum proved to be one of Leonard&#x27;s great assets.

===1998–2003===
Leonard continued to be an England regular under Woodward. In 1999, England competed in the Rugby World Cup, hosted this time by Wales. World Cup matches were also played throughout the rest of the British Isles and in France. England had shown signs of improvement under Woodward, who had been looking to play a more expansive game, but were denied a Grand Slam prior to the World Cup due to Neil Jenkins&#x27; boot and a last-minute try by Scott Gibbs. This, however, was to be the first of four consecutive near-misses.

In the 1999 World Cup, England were drawn in Pool 2 with New Zealand, Italy and Tonga, but were knocked out of the tournament at the quarter-final stage by South Africa.

The new Millennium saw Leonard break several records; he surpassed Rory Underwood as England&#x27;s most capped player with his 86th cap against Argentina in November 2000. 12 months later against Romania he overtook former New Zealand captain Sean Fitzpatrick as the world&#x27;s most-capped forward in his 93rd appearance.

For the 2000 Autumn internationals, Leonard was dropped to the bench and replaced by Graham Rowntree. In 2001, although England had scored 28 tries in their first four Six Nations matches, they lost the fifth to Ireland after the match had been rescheduled. 2001 also saw a tour of the British and Irish Lions, coached by Graham Henry, to Australia. The Wallabies won the Test series 2–1, though the Lions had convincingly won the first Test and were in the driving seat at half-time during the second Test in Melbourne. After this, England began to notch up regular victories against the big guns of the Southern Hemisphere (New Zealand, South Africa and Australia), culminating in the 2003 World Cup.

On 15 February 2003, Jason Leonard became the first-ever forward to make 100 international appearances, when he started against France in a Six Nations clash. He was also the first Englishman and overall third player (after Philippe Sella and David Campese) to achieve this feat.

In March, Leonard played a key role in securing England&#x27;s Grand Slam with a win over Ireland at Lansdowne Road. In August he captained England for the second time in World Cup warm-up match, crushing Wales 43–9 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. It was Leonard&#x27;s proven ability to play both loose-head and tight-head and experience which earned him a spot in England&#x27;s World Cup Squad. During the tournament, he made appearances in all seven matches of the 2003 World Cup, including the semi-final against France where he overtook Phillipe Sella as the world&#x27;s most-capped player. During the 2003 tournament, Leonard appeared in his second World Cup final as a second-half substitute for tight-head prop Phil Vickery, playing a vital role in reducing England&#x27;s high penalty count at the scrum. The then coach Clive Woodward later wrote in his autobiography that Leonard&#x27;s introduction was the key substitution which helped England to win the match.

Leonard played one more match for England in the 2004 Six Nations Championship against Italy before announcing his retirement as the (then) most-capped player of all time with 114 caps for England and five for the British and Irish Lions. Overall, Leonard made 23 appearances for the British Lions over 3 tours including 5 test appearances without scoring any points.

== Charity ==
Leonard has worked with and supported numerous charities throughout his career. He has been holding Annual Dinners since 2004, which have to date raised over £2 million for charities and good causes.

In 2014, he founded The Atlas Foundation, which exists to help deprived children around the world work towards a better future through rugby communities and initiatives. So far over £1 million has been raised, and over 50,000 children have been supported.

Jason spends an enormous amount of time working on behalf of many other charities to support fundraising and raise awareness for their causes.

<doc id="1220300" wikidata="Q220749" url="?curid=1220300" title="Whitney Houston (album)">
<text>Whitney Houston is the debut studio album by American singer Whitney Houston, released on February 14, 1985, by Arista Records. &quot;Whitney Houston&quot; initially had a slow commercial response, but began getting more popular in mid-1985. It eventually topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for 14 weeks in 1986, generating three number-one singles—&quot;Saving All My Love for You&quot;, &quot;How Will I Know&quot; and &quot;Greatest Love of All&quot;—on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, which made it both the first debut album and the first album by a solo female artist to produce three number-one singles in the United States.

The album topped the albums charts in many countries, including Canada, Australia, Norway, and Sweden, while peaking at number 2 in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Switzerland. The album was certified diamond for shipments of 10 million units or more on March 16, 1999, and later 14× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on January 27, 2023. The album is the best-selling debut album by a solo artist, as well as one of the best selling albums of all time, with sales of over 30 million copies worldwide.

In 1986, at the 28th Grammy Awards, &quot;Whitney Houston&quot; received four nominations, including Album of the Year, and won one, Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female, for &quot;Saving All My Love for You&quot;. For the 29th Grammy Awards of 1987, the album earned one nomination for Record of the Year for &quot;Greatest Love of All&quot;. &quot;Whitney Houston&quot; was the first album by a female artist to be top the &quot;Billboard Year End Albums Charts&quot; of 1986. The album has also been ranked on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in all three editions.

In honor of its 25th anniversary, the album was reissued as &quot;Whitney Houston – The Deluxe Anniversary Edition&quot; on January 26, 2010, an expanded edition with five bonus tracks including the a cappella version of &quot;How Will I Know&quot; and the original 12-inch remixes of songs from the album, a booklet on the history of the original album, along with a DVD of live performances and interviews by Whitney Houston and Clive Davis. On June 30, 2020, after the 35th anniversary celebration in February 2020, the album re-issued as a double vinyl including the singles from &quot;Whitney Dancin&#x27; Special&quot;. Also, they released a box set including the 40-page hard cover photo and lyric book.

==Background==

After seeing Houston perform in a New York City nightclub, Clive Davis believed the singer had the potential to crossover and be the next big superstar. He signed her in 1983 and the two began work on her debut album. Initially Davis had a hard time finding songs for her. Even after elaborate showcases in New York and Los Angeles, many producers turned down the chance to work with her. It took a year and a half for Jerry Griffith (then Arista&#x27;s head of A&amp;R and the one who had recommended Houston to Davis) and Davis to gather suitable songs for the album. Finally the songwriter-producer Kashif offered to produce &quot;You Give Good Love&quot;. Jermaine Jackson produced three songs. Narada Michael Walden revised and then produced &quot;How Will I Know&quot;. Michael Masser covered the pop side of the tracks, producing four of his own compositions, including &quot;Saving All My Love for You&quot; and &quot;Greatest Love of All&quot;, which had originally been recorded in 1977 by George Benson as &quot;The Greatest Love of All&quot;, and was the main theme of the 1977 Muhammad Ali biopic &quot;The Greatest&quot;. After two years of recording, the album was ready for release. Budgeted at $200,000, it ultimately cost almost $400,000.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Whitney Houston&quot; received critical acclaim upon release. In a positive review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden wrote, &quot;along with an appealing romantic innocence, [Houston] projects the commanding dignity and elegance of someone far more mature.&quot; Liam Lacey of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; said the &quot;arrangements frequently border on formulaic but such ballads as &quot;Saving All My Love for You&quot;, &quot;Greatest Love of All,&quot; and &quot;Hold Me&quot; are some of the loveliest pop singing on vinyl since the glory days of Dionne Warwick.&quot; Lacey added, &quot;Houston has a silky, rich, vibrant voice that moves between steely edges, or curls sensuously around the notes.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; complimented Houston on her excellent vocal ability, writing, &quot;neither the frequently listless arrangements nor the sometimes mediocre material of this debut LP hides the fact that Houston is a singer with enormous power and potential.&quot;

Don Shewey of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described her as &quot;one of the most exciting new voices in years&quot; and stated that: &quot;Because she has a technically polished voice like Patti Austin&#x27;s, [...] her interpretive approach is what sets her apart&quot; and &quot;Whitney Houston is obviously headed for stardom, and if nothing else, her album is an exciting preview of coming attractions.&quot; But he expressed a little disappointment about undistinguished pop-soul tunes, commenting &quot;many of the songs here are so featureless they could be sung by anyone. They make what could have been a stunning debut merely promising.&quot; In his consumer guide for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau complimented Houston&#x27;s &quot;sweet, statuesque voice&quot;, but called the songs &quot;schlock&quot; and believed &quot;only one of the four producers puts any zip in—Narada Michael Walden, who goes one for one.&quot;

Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic defined &quot;Whitney Houston&quot; as &quot;the foundation of diva-pop&quot; and stated that certainly, the ballads such as &quot;Greatest Love of All&quot; and &quot;Saving All My Love for You&quot;, provided &quot;the blueprint for decades of divas&quot;. However, he gave higher marks to the lighter tracks like &quot;How Will I Know&quot; and &quot;Thinking About You&quot;, commenting these tracks &quot;are what really impresses some 20-plus years on&quot; and &quot;turns the album into a fully rounded record, the rare debut that manages to telegraph every aspect of an artist&#x27;s career in a mere ten songs.&quot; Brad Wete, on a feature article to celebrate for &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine&#x27;s 15th anniversary in September 2008, wrote &quot;never before has an African-American woman earned such crossover appeal so early in her career. [...] [Houston] had an explosive solo debut&quot; and commented &quot;Whitney&#x27;s prodigious pop set [...] was a fresh serving of precocious talent compared to 1985&#x27;s mildly flavored R&amp;B buffet.&quot; Allison Stewart from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that the album &quot;provided a blueprint for the pop/dance/R&amp;B-melding careers of Mariah Carey and others, and introduced the world to &quot;The Voice&quot;, an octave-spanning, gravity-defying melismatic marvel.&quot; In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), music journalist J. D. Considine gave the album three out of five stars and stated, &quot;Although utterly calculating, &quot;Whitney Houston&quot; does have its moments, particularly when Houston leans toward R&amp;B, as on &#x27;You Give Good Love.&#x27;&quot;

==Commercial performance==
Released on February 14, 1985, &quot;Whitney Houston&quot; debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Albums Chart the week of March 30, 1985, at number 166. Sales were low initially. However, with the success of the first single &quot;You Give Good Love&quot;, the album began climbing the charts and finally reached the number one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Black Albums chart in June and the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (formerly &quot;Top Pop Albums&quot;) in August 1985. After 55 weeks, successive hit singles and Grammy wins led to the album eventually topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart in March 1986. It was the slowest climb to the top of the charts since &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; took 58 weeks to reach the top in 1976.

&quot;Whitney Houston&quot; spent 14 non-consecutive weeks at the top of &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart from March until late June 1986, which was short of one week for Carole King&#x27;s record of 15 weeks for the longest running No. 1 album by a female artist at the time. It was the second-longest running No.1 album among the debut albums in &quot;Billboard&quot; history, behind Men at Work&#x27;s &quot;Business as Usual&quot;, which had 15 weeks on top in 1982–83. The album remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for 162 weeks. It also spent 46 weeks in the top 10, equaling Carole King&#x27;s record with &quot;Tapestry&quot;; this record was broken in the 1990s. Houston&#x27;s debut was the best-selling album of 1986 in the United States and the No. 1 album of the year on 1986 &quot;Billboard&quot; year-end charts, making her the first female artist to earn that distinction. She became also the number 1 pop artist of the year, according to &quot;Billboard&quot;. The RIAA certified it Diamond on March 16, 1999, and later 14× platinum on January 27, 2023, for shipments of 14,000,000 copies of the album in United States.

The album was successful worldwide. In the United Kingdom, it peaked at number two on the albums chart, spending 119 weeks on the chart. It was certified 4× platinum for shipments of 1,200,000 units of the album by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), becoming the fifth best-selling album of 1986. In Canada, the album reached the top spot on the albums chart and remained there for 17 weeks, becoming the longest stay at the summit by a female artist. On March 31, 1987, it was certified 10× platinum for sales of over one million copies, making it the best-selling album of 1986, and later Diamond by the Canadian Recording Industry Association(CRIA). &quot;Whitney Houston&quot; was also the best-selling album of 1986 in Australia, staying at number one on the Kent Music Report albums chart for 11 weeks, the longest stay by a female artist at the time. It was additionally the first number one album by a Black female artist there. In Japan, the album was the second best-selling album of 1986 by a foreign artist, selling a total of 450,000 units, only behind Madonna&#x27;s &quot;True Blue&quot;. In addition, the album reached number one on the albums chart in Norway for ten weeks, Sweden for six weeks and South Africa for five weeks, number two in Germany, Switzerland, and number three in Austria and New Zealand. Worldwide, &quot;Whitney Houston&quot; has sold over 30 million copies, becoming one of the best selling albums of the 1980s. According to the Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales data in 1991, as of 2009, the album sold over 1,038,000 copies in the United States. The week ending of February 25, 2012, following Houston&#x27;s death on February 11, the album re-charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 72 with 8,000 copies sold.

==Legacy==
&quot;Whitney Houston&quot; was the first album by a female artist to be number 1 on the &quot;Billboard Year End Albums Charts&quot; of 1986. According to Consequence of Sound, the album reached a massive level of cross-over that was unprecedented at the time for a black female music artist. It was the first album by a black female artist to reach No. 1 in Australia when it topped the charts for 11 consecutive weeks. &quot;Billboard&quot; picked the enormous success of her debut album release on the charts as one of 110 Musical Milestones in its history. It was also the first album by a black female artist to top the year-end charts in Australia and Canada and only the second to top the year-end chart in Switzerland after Tina Turner&#x27;s &quot;Private Dancer&quot;, and, at 30 million copies worldwide, remains the best-selling studio album by a black female artist of all time and the best-selling debut album by a female artist.

==Accolades==

At the 28th Grammy Awards in 1986, &quot;Whitney Houston&quot; received four nominations—Album of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;Saving All My Love for You&quot;, Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance for &quot;You Give Good Love&quot; and Best Rhythm &amp; Blues Song for &quot;You Give Good Love&quot;—and won Houston&#x27;s first Grammy, Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female. In addition, the album earned one nomination for Record of the Year in 1987 for &quot;Greatest Love of All&quot;, a cover of &quot;The Greatest Love of All&quot;, originally recorded by George Benson in 1977, ten years before and was the main theme of the boxer Muhammad Ali biopic &quot;The Greatest&quot; in the same year.

The album received good response from major publications. Three major critics of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; listed the album on their year end critics list. The album ranked No. 79 on Robert Hilburn&#x27;s list, No. 2 on Paul Grein&#x27;s list and No. 5 on Dennis Hunt&#x27;s list. In November 2003, the album was ranked No. 254 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s publication of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and 257 in a 2012 revised list. Then ranked 249 in a 2020 revised list It also ranked No. 46 on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;Definitive 200 List&quot; in 2007. In addition, ranked No. 71 on &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Women Who Rock The World&quot; in 2002 and No. 15 on Yahoo! Music&#x27;s 30 Most Significant Albums In Black Music History list in 2010, with Brandy&#x27;s comments on the album; &quot;The first Whitney Houston CD was genius. That CD introduced the world to her angelic yet powerful voice. Without Whitney many of this generation of singers wouldn&#x27;t be singing.&quot; In 2013, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2018, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed &quot;Whitney Houston&quot; at number 117 on their newly revised list of &quot;200 Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;.

===Best New Artist controversy===
Although the album was nominated in four categories at the 28th Grammy Awards, Houston was not nominated for Best New Artist that year due to National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) regulations, which caused some controversy. Although &quot;Whitney Houston&quot; was Houston&#x27;s debut album, she was disqualified as a new artist because she had been credited in 1984 as a guest vocalist on the Jermaine Jackson album &quot;Dynamite&quot; as well as the Teddy Pendergrass album &quot;Love Language&quot;. Per NARAS rules, any previous album credit disqualifies an artist from the Best New Artist award.

Clive Davis, then the president of Arista Records, sent a letter of complaint to NARAS president Michael Greene disputing the disqualification. He also wrote to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, noting that the rule had been applied much less strictly in previous years. According to Davis, artists including Cyndi Lauper, Luther Vandross, the Power Station, Carly Simon, and Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, had already received credits on other albums or been previously well known as a member of other acts prior to their nominations for the Best New Artist award. He referred to the disqualification as &quot;a conspicuous injustice&quot;.

Despite the criticism, NARAS did not back down from the disqualification. Greene, in a statement, said that &quot;The determination of eligibility or ineligibility in the best new artist category is not made capriciously or taken lightly.&quot; He also noted that the duets with Jackson and Pendergrass had been submitted for consideration for the 27th Grammy Awards, which he said &quot;was sufficient to make her ineligible this year for best new artist according to academy criteria.&quot; The 1986 award eventually went to British band Sade.

American singer Richard Marx was similarly ruled ineligible for nomination as Best New Artist in 1988. In an interview with &quot;Orange Coast&quot; magazine, he referred to the Houston controversy, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t have a lot of respect for N.A.R.A.S., the Grammy people&#x27;s ruling system, because it&#x27;s so inconsistent. They deemed me and Whitney Houston ineligible, and yet they nominated Jody Watley, who made records with Shalamar.&quot; In 2000, Geoff Mayfield of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine also criticized NARAS for inconsistency with the Best New Artist rules, specifically referencing their disqualification of Houston and nomination of Watley.

==Singles==
The label, wanting Houston to have a solid urban fanbase first, released &quot;You Give Good Love&quot; as the first single. The soulful ballad would top the R&amp;B chart and surprise the label by crossing over and reaching number three on the pop chart while the singer was playing at nightclubs in the United States. The jazzy-pop &quot;Saving All My Love for You&quot; (originally a minor hit for Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr. in 1978 on their album &quot;Marilyn &amp; Billy&quot;) was released next and really put her on the map. The single was an even bigger success hitting number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. It would reach number one in the United Kingdom and was successful around the world. With her first number one, Houston began appearing on high-profile talk shows and became the opening act for Jeffrey Osborne and Luther Vandross. &quot;Thinking About You&quot; was released as the single only to R&amp;B-oriented radio stations. It peaked at number 10 on the Hot Black Singles chart and at number 24 on the Hot Dance/Disco Club Play chart.

At the end of 1985, &quot;How Will I Know&quot; was released as the official third single. With its colorful and energetic video, the song brought the singer to the teen audience and MTV, which black artists had found tough to crack. It became another number one single for Houston, topping both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Singles chart and Hot Black Singles chart. The final single, &quot;Greatest Love of All&quot;, a cover of &quot;The Greatest Love of All&quot;, originally recorded in 1977 by George Benson, become the biggest hit off the album with a three-week stay atop the Hot 100. As a result, the parent album became the first debut album—and the first album by a female artist—ever to generate three number one singles. With &quot;Greatest Love of All&quot; and Houston&#x27;s debut album both at No. 1 on the singles and albums chart respectively, she became the first female artist to have the number one pop single and album simultaneously since Kim Carnes in 1981 with &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; and &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot;. &quot;All at Once&quot; was released only to Adult Contemporary and Urban AC stations as a radio airplay-only single later in 1986. It received heavy airplay and can still be heard on AC stations. However, the single received an official release in Japan and many European countries. &quot;Take Good Care of my Heart&quot; (as a duet with Jermaine Jackson) was also released as a radio-airplay single in Panama, becoming a success in the country, reaching No. 2.

==Promotion and appearances==
===Tours===
To further promote her debut album and first US top 5 Pop and No.1 R&amp;B single &quot;You Give Good Love&quot;, Houston went on tour performing at clubs, theaters, and festivals. By August 1985, she was featured as a support act on selected dates by singers Luther Vandross and Jeffrey Osborne on individual tours. The following summer of 1986, her album generated three US Hot 100 chart toppers; Houston embarked on The Greatest Love Tour performing shows in North America, Europe, and Japan.

<doc id="1220301" wikidata="Q4582319" url="?curid=1220301" title="Stasiland">
<text>Stasiland by Anna Funder is a book first published in Australia by Text Publishing in 2002 about individuals who resisted the East German regime, and others who worked for its secret police, the Stasi. It tells the story of what it was like to work for the Stasi, and describes how those who did so now come to terms, or do not, with their pasts.

Funder, an Australian, found that Germans often resorted to stereotypes in describing the Ossis, the German nickname for those who lived in East Germany, dismissing questions about civil resistance. She used classified ads to reach former members of the Stasi and anti-Stasi organizations and interviewed them extensively.

== Publication ==
A German-language version was published by Europäische Verlagsanstalt in 2004. The association GBM () obtained an interim injunction in Germany against the publication. In 2006, S. Fischer Verlag republished the book in German without the offending passages.

== Reception ==
Chris Mitchell of &quot;Spike Magazine&quot; called it &quot;an essential insight into the totalitarian regime&quot;. Giles MacDonogh wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that the culture of informants and moral capitulations &quot;comes wonderfully to life in Funder&#x27;s racy account&quot;.

&quot;Stasiland&quot; has been published in sixty nine countries and translated into a dozen languages. It was shortlisted for many awards in the UK and Australia, among them The Age Book of the Year Awards, the Queensland Premier&#x27;s Literary Awards, the Guardian First Book Award 2003, the South Australian Festival Awards for Literature (Innovation in Writing) 2004, the Index Freedom of Expression Awards 2004, and the W.H. Heinemann Award 2004. In June 2004 it was awarded the Samuel Johnson Prize.

&quot;Stasiland&quot; is being developed for the stage by The National Theatre in London.

<text>Moana-Nui-a-Kiwa Ngarimu VC (7 April 1918 – 27 March 1943) was a New Zealand soldier and posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the first Māori person to be awarded the VC while serving with New Zealand forces. He was killed in action during Operation Supercharge II; part of the Tunisian campaign of World War II.

==Early life==
A Māori of Ngāti Porou and Te Whānau-ā-Apanui descent, Moana-Nui-a-Kiwa Ngārimu was born on 7 April 1918 in Whareponga in the East Coast region. He was one of ten children of Hāmuera Meketū Ngārimu, and his wife Maraea. The prominent tribal leader Materoa Reedy was his aunt. Arnold Reedy, a tribal leader and captain in the Māori Battalion in World War II, was Ngarimu&#x27;s cousin and served alongside him in the war. Ngarimu was initially educated at Whareponga Native School but when the family moved to Pōhatukura, near Ruatoria, he attended Hiruhārama Native School. From 1933 to 1934, he went Te Aute College at Poukawa in Hawkes Bay, becoming well regarded at rugby. After completing his fourth form year, he worked as a shepherd on his father&#x27;s sheep farm.

==Second World War==
Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Ngarimu joined the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force on 11 February 1940, volunteering for the 28th (Māori) Battalion. The battalion, which embarked in May 1940 as part of the second echelon of the 2nd New Zealand Division was destined for the Middle East to join the first echelon, but instead was diverted to England in May 1940 where it formed part of the island&#x27;s defence against a possible German invasion. The battalion eventually arrived in Egypt in March 1941.

Ngarimu served through the battles of Greece and Crete after which he participated with the battalion during the North African Campaign. Commissioned in April 1942, he served for a time as an intelligence officer before being given command of his own platoon.

By March 1943, the campaign in Africa had moved to Tunisia. The 2nd Division, of which the Māori battalion was part, was tasked with the capture of the Tebaga Gap, which disrupted otherwise mountainous terrain. Several hills overlooked the gap, which itself was forced relatively easy, although several hills remained in German hands. One such hill was Point 209, held by the 2nd Battalion, 433 Panzer Grenadier Regiment of the 164th Light Division. Ngarimu&#x27;s company was allocated the objective of the capture of Point 209. On the afternoon of 26 March, he led his men up the slope and captured what was believed to be the top of Point 209, although it transpired to be a false summit and a feature lower on the slopes of Point 209. Fierce fighting transpired as the Germans attempted to drive Ngarimu&#x27;s forces off the hill. Twice wounded, he and his men defended their position from several counter-attacks during the night. His position reinforced the following morning, he was killed during the next counter-attack.

The false summit remained in the hands of Ngarimu&#x27;s company, and the Germans still on Point 209 itself surrendered the same day once artillery support had been brought to bear on Point 209. Ngarimu is buried in Sfax War Cemetery, Tunisia.

===Victoria Cross citation===
The citation for Ngarimu&#x27;s VC was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; and read:
==The medal==
The medal was presented to his parents by the Governor General of New Zealand, Sir Cyril 
Newall, at a hui at Ruatoria on 6 October 1943 attended by government leaders, diplomatic representatives and local people. The first of only two Victoria Crosses awarded to Māori, it was displayed in Gisborne in the Tairawhiti Museum’s Price of Citizenship Gallery. He is commemorated by a scholarship promoting education of Māori, and also in the World War II Hall of Memories at the Auckland War Memorial Museum. There is also a plaque honouring him in Queen&#x27;s Garden in Dunedin.

<text>Private Samuel Needham VC (16 August 1885 − 4 November 1918) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 33 years old, and a private in the 1/5th Battalion, The Bedfordshire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 10/11 September 1918 at Kefr Kasim, Palestine, one of our patrols was attacked by the enemy in considerable force, supported by very heavy fire. At a critical moment Private Needham ran back, turned to face a fresh body of the enemy which was approaching and fired rapidly at about 40 Turks at only 30 yards range. This action checked the enemy and just gave the patrol commander time to get his men together again. Half of the patrol were casualties but they managed to get back all their wounded. Private Needham&#x27;s action in standing up to the enemy all alone did much to inspire the men and undoubtedly saved the situation.

He took his own life, being killed by a self inflicted wound (ref: Mick Brand) at Kantara, Egypt on 4 November 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Death Certificate 

His VC is displayed at the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regimental Collection at the Wardown Park Museum, Luton, Bedfordshire.

<text>Major General Hamilton Lyster Reed, , (23 May 1869 – 7 March 1931) was an Irish British Army officer, and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Early life ==
Born in Dublin, he was the son of Sir Andrew Reed, a senior police official. He was educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and gazetted into the Royal Field Artillery as a second lieutenant on 17 February 1888.

==Military career==
Reed was promoted to lieutenant on 17 February 1891, and to captain on 14 September 1898. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899, he went to South Africa on active service. He took part in the Ladysmith Relief Force, including the Battle of Colenso on 15 December 1899, where he was wounded.

===Details on Victoria Cross===
He was a 30 years old captain in 7th Battery, Royal Field Artillery during the battle of Colenso on 15 December 1899. The detachments serving the guns of the 14th and 66th Batteries, Royal Field Artillery, had all been either killed, wounded, or driven from their guns by Infantry fire at close range, and the guns were deserted. His citation mentions the following deed, for which he was awarded the VC:
==Second Boer War==
After the end of regular warfare, the war turned into a guerrilla war in late 1900. During the later part of the war, Reed, a divisional adjutant in March 1900, served as a staff officer, in the position of deputy assistant adjutant general for intelligence from 12 June 1901.

The war ended in June 1902. Reed left Cape Town in the SS &quot;Dilwara&quot; in late July, and arrived in Southampton the following month. He returned to the Royal Artillery as a regular officer in January 1903. In September 1906 he was seconded for service on the staff and made a staff captain at headquarters.

==Further military service==
In September 1910 he served as a general staff officer, grade 2 (GSO2) and was granted the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel while holding this appointment. Reed was a temporary military attaché, for which he was once again promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel, with the Turkish Army during the Balkan Wars of 1912–13. In September 1913 he was made a GSO2. He was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel in February 1914, while serving as a GSO2 with Eastern Command.

He served with the British Army throughout the First World War, becoming GSO1 of the 27th Division in November 1914. In June 1915 he was promoted to temporary brigadier general and became brigadier general, general staff (BGGS) of IX Corps, which he served with in the Gallipoli campaign. He later received the brevet rank of colonel in March 1916 for his role in the evacuation of Allied forces at Gallipoli. In April he was promoted again to temporary brigadier general. In October 1917 he became a temporary major general and became general officer commanding (GOC) 15th (Scottish) Division from 1917 to 1919. 

He then received a permanent promotion to major general in June 1919 and succeeded Major General Sir Philip Robertson as GOC 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division in June 1923, a post he held until he retired from the army in June 1928.

He died at the age of 61 in London on 7 March 1931.

<text>Julius Pollux (, &quot;Ioulios Polydeukes&quot;; fl. 2nd century) was a Greek scholar and rhetorician from Naucratis, Ancient Egypt.
Emperor Commodus appointed him a professor-chair of rhetoric in Athens at the Academy — on account of his melodious voice, according to Philostratus&#x27; &quot;Lives of the Sophists.&quot;

== Works ==
Pollux was the author of the &quot;Onomasticon&quot; (), a Greek thesaurus or dictionary of Attic synonyms and phrases, in ten books, each prefaced with a dedication to the emperor Commodus. The work forms part of the Atticist movement of the Second Sophistic, and was intended to provide a full catalogue of the Greek vocabulary derived from classical texts that an accomplished orator could deploy. Within this movement, Pollux shows himself &quot;a liberal and inclusive Atticist,&quot; willing to admit vocabulary from classical authors in non-Attic dialects (like Herodotus), from post-classical works (such as New Comedy and Hellenistic historiography), and from contemporary spoken Greek. The entries in the work are arranged not alphabetically but according to subject-matter. Pollux claims that the exact order of subjects is random, but contemporary scholarship has discerned organisational patterns based on &quot;the paradigmatic relationships at the heart of Romano-Greek society.&quot; For example, Book 5 is divided into two halves, the first of which deals with words relating to hunting and the second half of which Pollux calls &quot;eclectic&quot; (e.g. the entries in 5.148-5.152 are: &quot;proischesthai&quot; &quot;to hold forth&quot;, &quot;grammata en stelais&quot; &quot;writing on steles&quot;, &quot;diakores&quot; &quot;satiated&quot;, &quot;anamphibolon&quot; &quot;unambiguous&quot;), but, within this eclecticism, Zadorojnyi nevertheless notes a tendency to focus on binary oppositions like love and hate, praise and denunciation.

It supplies much rare and valuable information on many points of classical antiquity — objects in daily life, the theater, politics – and quotes numerous fragments of lost works. Thus, Julius Pollux became invaluable for William Smith&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities&quot;, 1842, etc.

Nothing of his rhetorical works has survived, except some of their titles (in the &quot;Suda&quot;).

== Contemporary reception ==
Pollux was probably the person satirized by Lucian as a worthless and ignorant person who gains a reputation as an orator by sheer effrontery, and pilloried in his &quot;Lexiphanes&quot;, a satire upon the affectation of obscure and obsolete words.

* 1900–1967, ed. E. Bethe, Leipzig (Teubner). Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3.

== Translations ==
A Latin translation made by Rudolf Gwalther was published in Basel at 1541 and made Julius Pollux more available to Renaissance antiquaries and scholars, and anatomists, who adopted obscure Greek words for parts of the body.

<text>General Sir Dighton Macnaghten Probyn, (21 January 1833 – 20 June 1924) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early career==
The son of Captain George Probyn and Alicia Workman, daughter of Sir Francis Workman Macnaghten, 1st Baronet, Dighton Probyn entered the light cavalry arm of the East India Company&#x27;s Bengal Army as a cornet in 1849, being posted into the 6th Light Cavalry. In 1852, he was appointed adjutant of the newly raised 2nd Punjab Cavalry which formed part of the 11,000 strong Punjab Irregular Force responsible for policing the Trans-Indus Frontier.

At the time of the outbreak of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, on 10 May 1857, Dighton Probyn was at Jullundur, the station of the 6th Bengal Light Cavalry. Probyn&#x27;s squadron of the 2nd Punjab Cavalry fought throughout the uprising, with Probyn being &#x27;Mentioned in Despatches&#x27; many times for his actions.

By the end of 1857 the squadron of 2nd Punjab Cavalry which Probyn commanded was frequently referred to as Probyn&#x27;s Horse, as Lieutenant E. H. Verney, RN, records in &quot;The Shannon&#x27;s Brigade in India&quot;:

During the final days of the fall of Lucknow in early 1858, the 2nd Punjab Cavalry was constantly engaged in patrolling and was frequently sent short distances in pursuit of fleeing mutineers and rebels. By this time, Probyn, worn down by the rigours of continual campaigning, was invalided back to England on 18 March 1858. By now a captain, he was brevetted to major in the regular army on 24 March 1858. Probyn was brevetted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Bengal Army on 15 February 1861. He was brevetted to colonel on 15 February 1866 and to major-general on 25 July 1870.

==Victoria Cross==

Probyn was 24 years old, and a captain in the 2nd Punjab Cavalry, Bengal Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deeds took place for which he was awarded the VC:
His VC sold at auction on 24 September 2005 for £160,000.

==Royal courtier==
On 4 March 1872, the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, appointed him as one of his equerries. He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI) on 7 March 1876, and was brevetted to lieutenant-general on 1 October 1877. He was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Bengal Cavalry on 1 April 1881, and was transferred to the unemployed list on 1 July 1882. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, Civil Division (KCB) in the 1887 Golden Jubilee Honours. On 1 December 1888, he was promoted to the local rank of general in the British Indian Army while unemployed, and was promoted to the substantive rank of colonel in the Bengal Cavalry on 1 April 1893. He was appointed one of the first Knights Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) on 26 May 1896.

He was a councillor of the Oxford Military College in Cowley, Oxfordshire from 1876 to 1896, and was appointed a member of the Privy Council on 9 February 1901. He was promoted to a Knight Grand Cross of the (civil division) Order of the Bath (GCB) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and was invested by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 8 August 1902. He was appointed a Companion of the Imperial Service Order (ISO) on 22 July 1903. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, Military Division (KCB (Mil.)) on 20 October 1909.

He was in later life an ornament of the Victorian age, being Keeper of the Privy Purse, a court sinecure position as well as Secretary to the Prince of Wales and Comptroller of the Household. This was an important position as the Prince and Princess were both profligate in spending and Probyn had a hard job to keep them solvent. Testimony to his success was the fact that, when the Prince acceded at last in 1901, he was in credit at the bank. Probyn had difficulty hiding the King&#x27;s extravagance, which the minister Charles Hobhouse refused to defend in the Commons.

Probyn continued in this role throughout the King&#x27;s rule and right up to his death. He was appointed an Extra Equerry to King Edward VII in 1902.

Probyn was totally devoted to the Princess, then Queen-Empress, building gardens for her at Windsor Castle and Sandringham House. The Queen returned the devotion, carrying round a knife with her to cut open his collar when he occasionally had seizures.

In 1915 Probyn gave an engraved wristwatch to Captain Frank Beck, the officer who led the Sandringham Volunteers in the First World War. After he was killed during the Gallipoli Campaign, it was bought from a Turkish officer after the war and returned to Beck&#x27;s family in 1922.

Probyn had an impressive appearance in old age with a very long white beard reaching down to his navel which concealed his VC on ceremonial occasions.

==Death==
Probyn died on 20 June 1924.

==Family==
Probyn married, in 1872, Letitia Maria Thellusson, daughter of Thomas Robarts Thellusson. Lady Probyn died at Park House, Sandringham, Norfolk, on 17 January 1900.

==Legacy==
The 5th King Edward&#x27;s Own Probyn&#x27;s Horse popularly called Probyn&#x27;s Horse, a regiment of the British Indian Army, was named after him; it is now part of the Pakistan Army and officially designated as 5 Horse.

Probynabad, a town in Punjab province of Pakistan with large farmlands owned by the regiment is also named after him.

An &quot;Iris iberica&quot; hybrid was named &#x27;Sir Dighton Probyn&#x27; in 1909 by Professor M. Foster.

<text>Carmen Blanche Silvera (2 June 1922 – 3 August 2002) was a British comic actress. Born in Canada of Spanish descent, she moved to Coventry, England, with her family when she was a child. She appeared on television regularly in the 1960s, and achieved mainstream fame in the 1980s with her starring role in the British television programme, &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; as Edith Artois.

== Life and career ==
During World War II, Silvera was evacuated to Montreal and narrowly escaped death when, at the last minute, her name was taken off the passenger list of the liner that was sunk by the enemy shortly afterwards. In Canada, she took classes with the Ballets Russes and appeared in three of its productions. On her return to Britain, she felt called to acting and trained at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, before gaining experience in repertory theatre.

Silvera first made her name as a television actress in the 1960s British police drama &quot;Z-Cars&quot; in 1962, going on to appear as Camilla Hope in the BBC soap opera &quot;Compact&quot; from 1964 to 1965. She played Mrs Van Schuyler in &quot;Lillie&quot; in 1978, ITV&#x27;s drama series about the future Edward VII&#x27;s mistress, Lillie Langtry.

She appeared twice in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, in the serials &quot;The Celestial Toymaker&quot; as Clara the Clown, Mrs. Wiggs, and the Queen of Hearts, and as Ruth in &quot;Invasion of the Dinosaurs&quot;. In 1970 she appeared in the &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; episode &quot;Mum&#x27;s Army&quot; as Fiona Gray, the love-interest for Captain Mainwaring, a role especially written for her by David Croft. She also had roles in British sex comedies, such as &quot;Clinic Exclusive&quot; (1971), &quot;On the Game&quot; (1974) and &quot;Keep It Up Downstairs&quot; (1976). Her longest-running role came as Edith, the antagonistic wife of opportunistic cafe owner Rene Artois, throughout the history of the &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; series from 1982 to 1992. Madame Edith was often heard singing to a piano accompaniment and when the show’s theme tune was released on LP in the 1980s Silvera sang the full song, starting “&quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo, we meet again&quot;”. 

She appeared with Ted Rogers at the New Wimbledon Theatre in 1997 in Jimmy Perry&#x27;s stage musical &quot;That&#x27;s Showbiz&quot;. Her West End stage appearances included roles in &quot;Waters of the Moon&quot;, starring Ingrid Bergman, &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; with Penelope Keith, &quot;A Coat of Varnish&quot; and &quot;School for Wives&quot;, which was directed by Peter Hall. She also played a grandmother in the 1997 film &quot;La Passione&quot;.

In 1991, she was the subject of a &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; television programme. She did charity work for the Grand Order of Lady Ratlings, the ladies&#x27; branch of the Grand Order of Water Rats.

== Personal life and death ==
Silvera was enthusiastic about horse racing after her grandfather took her to a race at Warwick. She won a bet on &quot;Light of Love&quot; at the race, which came in at 7/1.

In Coventry in 1949, Silvera married John Cunliffe, an actor she had met at repertory theatre in Tonbridge, Kent in 1941. She divorced following a miscarriage and never remarried. A heavy smoker, she died of lung cancer on 3 August 2002, aged 80, at the Denville Hall retirement home for actors.

== Family ==
Her Jamaican-born father, Roland Silvera (1895–1986), was a well-known flat-green bowls player and a member of Stoke Bowling Club, Coventry. After emigrating to Canada in 1910 and becoming a ship hand, Roland fought for the Canadian Expeditionary Force in World War I.

Roland married Dorothy White in Warwick in 1918 and returned to Canada, where Carmen and her brother Roger were born. They emigrated back to Warwickshire in 1924. Roland served as President of Warwickshire County Bowls Association in 1970, in which year the County side achieved their one and only success in the English Bowling Association Middleton Cup competition, beating Middlesex in the final. Coventry &amp; District Bowls Association runs an annual competition for the Silvera Shield.

<text>Unfabulous is an American teen sitcom that aired on Nickelodeon. The series is about an &quot;unfabulous&quot; middle schooler named Addie Singer, played by Emma Roberts. The show, which premiered on September 12, 2004, was one of the most-watched programs in the U.S. among children and teenagers between the ages of 10 and 16. It was created by Sue Rose, who previously created two animated series &quot;Pepper Ann&quot; (for Disney) and &quot;Angela Anaconda&quot;, and co-created the character Fido Dido with Joanna Ferrone. The series ended on December 16, 2007, with the final episode titled &quot;The Best Trip Ever&quot;.

Most of the episodes are narrated by Addie, and are told in flashbacks. The show&#x27;s theme song is performed by Jill Sobule, who also wrote the songs performed throughout the show.

==Premise==
&quot;Unfabulous&quot;″s main character is a teenage girl named Addie Singer (Emma Roberts), who writes songs about her life in middle school. Her best friends are Geena Fabiano (Malese Jow), who is interested in fashion and designs her own clothes, and the environmentally committed school basketball player Zack Carter-Schwartz (Jordan Calloway). They all attend Rocky Road Middle School in an unspecified East Coast city. However, in episode 34 &quot;The Birthday&quot; when Addie receives a letter from when she was 7 years old the address is listed as &quot;Pinecrest, PA&quot;. Addie&#x27;s older brother Ben (Tadhg Kelly) works at &quot;Juice!&quot;, a smoothie bar where Addie and her friends often hang out after school.

Throughout the first season, Addie obsesses about her crush on Jake Behari (Raja Fenske), who already has a girlfriend.

For the majority of the second season, however, Addie is dating Randy Klein (Evan Palmer). They break up towards the end of the season and Addie realizes that she still likes Jake. The made-for-TV movie &quot;Unfabulous: The Perfect Moment&quot; focused on Addie and Jake getting together although Jake will be gone for the rest of the summer in Canada.

In the third season, Addie and Jake finally begin dating and Geena and Zack begin to have feelings for each other.

<text>Andrew Moynihan, VC (1 January 1830 – 18 May 1867) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background==

He was born in the Saw Yard, Wakefield, Yorkshire on 1 January 1830, the son of Malachi and Ann (née Scott) and was baptised at the Catholic Church of St Austin in Wakefield on 14 March 1830. Andrew Moynihan married Ellen Anne (née Parkin) in 1853 in Ashton under Lyne, Lancashire. The widowed Ellen Moynihan returned to Yorkshire after the death of her husband and settled in Leeds where she raised her son and two daughters.

==Military career==

Moynihan joined the British Army aged 17. He was a 25-year-old sergeant in the 90th Foot, British Army during the Crimean War when his gallant action took place on 8 September 1855 at Sebastopol. Sergeant Moynihan, who was with the storming party at the assault on the Redan in the Crimea, personally encountered and killed five Russians, and while under heavy fire also rescued a wounded officer from near the Redan.

Moynihan served in India during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and in the Oudh Campaign of 1858-59. He was promoted to sergeant major and in 1856 was commissioned into the 8th (The King&#x27;s) Regiment of Foot. He was promoted lieutenant the following year and captain in 1863. Captain Moynihan disembarked with the 1st Battalion the 8th Regiment of Foot in Malta from Kingstown, Ireland on 20 Mar 1866; he would die on the island a little over a year later.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Cameronians Regimental Museum in Hamilton, Lanarkshire, Scotland.

==Death==

He died in Floriana after contracting Malta Fever, caused by drinking unsterilised goat&#x27;s milk. He is buried in Ta&#x27; Braxia Cemetery, near Valletta.

==Notable Relatives==

His son became a prominent surgeon being raised to the peerage as Berkeley Moynihan, 1st Baron Moynihan.

<text>Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (; in Córdoba – 1517 in Sancti Spíritus) was a Spanish &quot;conquistador&quot; from Córdoba, known for the ill-fated expedition he led in 1517, in the course of which the first European accounts of the Yucatán Peninsula were recorded. He died from wounds he suffered during the expedition after battling against Mayan Indians.

==1517 Expedition==

Together with some 110 discontented Spanish settlers in early colonial Cuba, Hernández de Córdoba petitioned the governor, Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, for permission to launch an expedition in search of new lands and exploitable resources. This permission was granted after some haggling over terms, and the expedition consisting of three ships under Hernández de Córdoba&#x27;s command left the harbor of Santiago de Cuba on February 8, 1517, to explore the shores of southern Mexico. The main pilot was Antón de Alaminos, the premiere navigator of the region who had accompanied Christopher Columbus on his initial voyages; The pilots of the other two ships were Juan Álvarez and Camacho de Triana.

During the course of this expedition many of Hernández&#x27; men were killed, most during a battle near the town of Champotón against a Maya army. He himself was injured, and died a few days after his return to Cuba. Bernal Díaz del Castillo was a member of the expedition and wrote about his journey. This was the Europeans&#x27; first encounter with what they considered an &quot;advanced civilization&quot; in the Americas, with solidly built buildings and a complex social organization which they recognized as being comparable to those of the Old World. They also had reason to expect that this new land would have gold.

Little is known of Córdoba&#x27;s life before his exploration of the Yucatán. A native of Spain, he was living in Cuba in 1517, indicating that he had participated in the conquest of the island. He was also quite wealthy, as he both owned a landed estate, including a native town, and financed his expedition to Mexico.

===Origin of Hernández&#x27;s expedition===
Bernal Díaz del Castillo is the chronicler who gives the most detail about the voyage of Hernández de Córdoba; his is also the only first-person account by someone who was present for the entire process. Also, Bernal declares in his chronicle that he had been himself a promoter of the project, together with another hundred or so Spaniards who said they had to &quot;occupy themselves&quot;. These soldiers and adventurers had been three years now in the newly settled territory of Cuba, many also having moved there from the colony of Castilla del Oro (Tierra Firme, present-day Panama) under its governor Pedrarias Dávila; they complained that &quot;they hadn&#x27;t done a single thing worth the telling&quot;.

From Bernal Díaz del Castillo&#x27;s narrative, it appears possible to deduce — possibly against the narrator&#x27;s own pretences because he would prefer to keep this hidden — that the original goal of the project was to capture Indians as slaves to increase or replace the manpower available to work the agricultural land or the mines of Cuba, and so that the Spaniards resident on the island who did not have Indians for their own exploitation of the land, such as Bernal himself, could establish themselves as &quot;hacendados&quot;. 

Bernal tells first how he, like the other restless 110 Spaniards who lived in Castilla del Oro, decided to ask permission of Pedrarias to travel to Cuba, and that Pedrarias granted this willingly, because in Tierra Firme &quot;there was nothing to conquer, that every thing was peaceful, that Vasco Núñez de Balboa, Pedrarias&#x27;s son-in-law, had conquered it&quot;.

Those Spaniards from Castilla del Oro presented themselves in Cuba to Diego Velázquez, the governor (and relative of Bernal Díaz del Castillo), who promised them &quot;...that he would give us Indians when some were available&quot;. Immediately after this allusion to the promise of Indians, Bernal writes, &quot;And as three years had already passed [...] and we haven&#x27;t done a single thing worth the telling, the 110 Spaniards who came from Darién and those who in the island of Cuba do not have Indians&quot; — again an allusion to the lack of Indians — they decided to join up with &quot;an &quot;hidalgo&quot; [a title of nobility or gentry, derived from &quot;hijo de algo&quot;, &quot;son of someone&quot;] known as Francisco Hernández de Córdoba [...] and that he was a rich man who had a village of Indians on this island [Cuba]&quot;, who had accepted to be their captain &quot;to go on our venture to discover new lands and in them to employ ourselves&quot;.

Bernal Díaz del Castillo barely tries to conceal that the much-repeated Indians had something to do with the project, although authors such as Salvador de Madariaga prefer to conclude that the objective was a much more noble one, &quot;to discover, to occupy ourselves and do things worthy of being told&quot;. But, in addition, governor Diego Velázquez himself wanted to participate in the project and he lent the money to build a boat, &quot;...with the condition that [...] we had to go with three boats to some little islets that are between the island of Cuba and Honduras, that are now known as the islands of Los Guanaxes [Guanajes], and we had to go in arms and fill up the boats with a cargo of Indians from those islets to serve as slaves&quot; (here Bernal uses the word &quot;esclavos&quot;, &quot;slaves&quot;, against Velázquez, whereas he had previously avoided speaking of the Indians whom Velázquez had promised to him). The chronicler immediately denied that he admits this pretension of Velázquez&#x27;s: &quot;we responded to him that what he said was not the command of God nor king, to make free men into slaves&quot;. If we are to believe Bernal, the governor sportingly admitted the denial and despite all this lent the money for the boat.

To evaluate the vague and even contradictory form in which Bernal treats the matter of kidnapping Indians as a possible objective of the voyage, one must take into account that he wrote his history of the conquest some fifty years after the occurrence of these events, and that at least in part his objective was to have his services and those of his fellow soldiers recognized by the Crown. It would have been difficult in these circumstances for him to have clearly stated that this had originally been a slaving expedition.

Most of his contemporaries, who also wrote earlier, are less evasive: in the letter sent to Queen Joanna and Emperor Charles V (Charles I of Spain) by the constable and town authorities of &quot;la Rica Villa de la Vera Cruz&quot;, Cortés&#x27;s captains narrate the origin of Hernández&#x27;s expedition saying: &quot;as it is the custom in those islands that in the name of your majesties are peopled with Spaniards to go for Indians to the islands that are not peopled with Spaniards, to obtain services from them [i.e. to obtain their forced labor], they sent the abovementioned... [Francisco Fernández de Córdoba and his associates Lope Ochoa de Caicedo and Cristobal Morante with]... two boats and a brigantine in order that from said islands they would bring Indians to the so-called Fernandina Island, and we think [...] that said Diego Velázquez [...] has the fourth part of said armada&quot;. In his &quot;Relación de las cosas de Yucatán&quot; (&quot;Relation of the Things of Yucatán&quot;), Fray Diego de Landa writes that Hernández de Córdoba went... &quot;to gather slaves for the mines, now that in Cuba the population is getting smaller&quot;, although a while later he adds, &quot;Others say that he left to discover land and that he brought Alaminos as a pilot...&quot; Bartolomé de Las Casas also says that even if the original intent was to kidnap and enslave Indians, at some point the objective was broadened to one of discovery, which justifies Alaminos.

The presence of Antón de Alaminos on the expedition is, in effect, one of the arguments against the hypothesis that the objective was exclusively one of slaving. This prestigious pilot, veteran of the voyages of Columbus and even, according to some, a man knowledgeable of places not published on the mariners&#x27; maps, would seem an excessive resource for a slaving expedition to the Guanajes islets.

There was another member of the expedition whose presence conforms still less to this hypothesis: the &quot;Veedor&quot; (&quot;Overseer&quot; or &quot;Supervisor&quot;) Bernardino Íñiguez. This public office had functions that we would now call fiscal and administrative. It was his job to count the treasure gathered by the expeditions, in metals and precious stones, in order to assure the correct allotment of the &quot;quinto real&quot; — the &quot;royal fifth&quot;: 20% of all treasure gained in the conquests was destined for the Spanish royal treasury, a fiscal norm that originated in the &quot;Reconquista&quot;, the re-conquest of Spain from the Muslims — and of other legal requisites, such as reading to the Indians, before attacking them, a declaration of intentions and a warning, to legalize the aggression in the face of possible future investigations. (Cortés was especially scrupulous with this formal requirement, useless when one lacked interpreters who could translate the message to the Indians). If the expedition went to Guanajes to kidnap Indians, the &quot;Veedor&quot;&#x27;s presence would have been downright inconvenient for them. Although, on the other hand, according to Bernal, Íñiguez was nothing but a soldier who carried out the role of &quot;veedor&quot;, his being so designated in advance indicates that there was at least some thought of the possibility of exploration.

In short, from the data in hand one could make the case that Hernández de Córdoba discovered Yucatán by accident, upon finding his expedition — initially headed on a shorter voyage to kidnap Indians for the &quot;haciendas&quot; of Cuba — driven from its course by a storm. Or one could suppose that after some evil thoughts by Diego Velázquez, promptly rebuked and found blameworthy by the other Spaniards, who furthermore were willing to continue without Indians in Cuba, the voyage was planned exclusively as one of discovery and conquest, and for that purpose they brought the &quot;Veedor&quot;, and such a good pilot. One could also believe, with Las Casas, that the project proceeded with both objectives in mind.

==Spanish exploration of Yucatán: the &quot;Gran Cairo&quot;==
Whether or not they were in search of Indians of the Guanajes islets, on February 8, 1517 they left Havana in two warships and a brigantine, crewed by over 100 men. The captain of the expedition was Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, the pilot Antón de Alaminos, from Palos. Camacho de Triana (the name suggests he was from Seville) and Joan Álvarez de Huelva (nicknamed &quot;el manquillo&quot;, which indicates that he was missing a limb), piloted the other two ships.

Until February 20 they followed the coast of &quot;Isla Fernandina&quot; (Cuba). At the point of Cape San Antonio, Cuba, they took to the open sea.

There followed two days and nights of furious storm, according to Bernal so strong as to endanger the ships, and in any case sufficient to consolidate the doubt about the objective of the expedition, because after the storm one may suspect that they did not know their location.

Later they had 21 days of fair weather and calm seas after which they spotted land and, quite near the coast and visible from the ships, the first large populated center seen by Europeans in the Americas, with the first solidly built buildings. The Spaniards, who evoked the Muslims in all that was developed but not Christian, spoke of this first city they discovered in America as &quot;El gran Cairo&quot;, as they later were to refer to pyramids or other religious buildings as &quot;mezquitas&quot;, &quot;mosques&quot;. &quot;This land was as yet undiscovered...from the ships we could see a large town, which appeared to lie six miles back from the coast, and as we had never seen one as large in Cuba or Hispaniola we named it the Great Cairo.&quot;

It is reasonable to designate this moment as the discovery of Yucatán—even &quot;of Mexico&quot;, if one uses &quot;Mexico&quot; in the sense of the borders of the modern nation state—but Hernández&#x27;s expeditionaries were not the first Spaniards to tread on Yucatán. In 1511 a ship of the fleet of Diego de Nicuesa, which was returning to Hispaniola, wrecked near the coast of Yucatán, and some of its occupants managed to save themselves. At the moment in which the soldiers of Hernández saw and named &quot;El gran Cairo&quot;, two of those shipwrecked sailors, Jerónimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero, were living in the area of Campeche, speaking the Mayan language of the area, and Gonzalo Guerrero even seems to have been governing an indigenous community. This does not remove the merit of Hernández as a discoverer: one may insist that merit of discovery ought to involve a voluntary act, not a shipwreck; Nicuesa&#x27;s shipwrecked sailors who were not sacrificed or worked to death by their Maya captors ended up enslaved.

The two ships of shallower draft went on ahead to investigate whether they could anchor securely near land. Bernal dates March 4, 1517 as the first encounter with the Indians of Yucatán, who approached those ships in ten large canoes (called &quot;pirogues&quot;), using both sails and oars. Making themselves understood by signs — the first interpreters, Julián and Melchior, were obtained by precisely this expedition — the Indians, always with &quot;smiling face and every appearance of friendliness&quot;, communicated to the Spaniards that the next day more pirogues would come to bring the recent arrivals to land.

==Supposed etymology of Yucatán, and the more probable etymology of Catoche==
This moment in which the Indians came up to the Spanish ships and accepted strings of green beads and other trifles fashioned for this purpose was one of the few peaceful contacts that Hernández&#x27;s group had with the Indians, and even these gestures of peace were feigned on the part of the Indians. These contacts of March 4 may have been the birth of the toponyms &quot;Yucatán&quot; and &quot;Catoche&quot;, whose surprising and amusing history — perhaps too amusing to be true — is often cited. Be it history or legend, the story is that the Spaniards asked the Indians for the name of the land they had just discovered and on hearing the predictable replies to the effect of &quot;I don&#x27;t understand what you said&quot;, &quot;those are our houses&quot; gave the land names based on what they had heard: &quot;Yucatán&quot;, meaning &quot;I don&#x27;t understand you&quot; for the whole &quot;province&quot; (or island, as they thought), and &quot;Catoche&quot;, meaning &quot;our houses&quot;, for the settlement and the cape where they had debarked.

Fray Diego de Landa dedicated the second chapter of his &quot;Relación de las cosas de Yucatán&quot; to &quot;Etymology of the name of this province. Its situation,&quot; and in it he confirms that &quot;Catoche&quot; derives from &quot;cotoch&quot;, &quot;our houses, our homeland&quot;, but does not confirm that &quot;Yucatán&quot; means &quot;I don&#x27;t understand&quot;.

Finally, Bernal Díaz del Castillo also takes up the matter. He confirms the etymology of &quot;Catoche&quot; as &quot;our houses&quot;, but for &quot;Yucatán&quot; he provides an even more surprising explanation than &quot;I don&#x27;t understand&quot;. According to his account, the Indians captured in the Battle of Catoche, Julian and Melchior, in their first conversations with the Spanish in Cuba, at which Diego Velázquez was present, had spoken of bread (Spanish: &quot;pan&quot;). The Spaniards explaining that their bread was made of &quot;yuca&quot; (cassava), the Maya Indians explaining that theirs was called &quot;tlati&quot;, and from the repetition of &quot;yuca&quot; (a Carib word, not a Mayan word) and &quot;tlati&quot; during this conversation the Spaniards falsely deduced that they had intended to teach the name of their land: &quot;Yuca-tán&quot;.

It is probable that the first narrator of the &quot;I don&#x27;t understand&quot; story was Fray Toribio de Benavente, a.k.a. &quot;Motolinia&quot;, who at the end of chapter 8 of the third book of his &quot;Historia de los indios de la Nueva España&quot; (&quot;History of the Indians of New Spain&quot;, written c. 1541) says: &quot;because speaking with those Indians of that coast, to that which the Spaniards asked the Indians responded: &quot;Tectetán, Tectetán&quot;, which means: &quot;I don&#x27;t understand you, I don&#x27;t understand you&quot;: the Christians corrupted the word, and not understanding what the Indians meant, said: &quot;Yucatán is the name of this land&quot;; and the same happened with a cape made by the land there, which they named the &quot;Cape of Cotoch&quot;, and &quot;Cotoch&quot; in that language means &quot;house&quot;.&quot;

A similar version is given by Francisco López de Gómara, writing about eleven years later in his biography of Cortés. However, there is no clear cognate in 16th century Yucatec which closely matches this phonology (although &quot;t&#x27;an&quot; or &quot;t&#x27;aan&quot; is a common Mayan root for &quot;language, speech&quot;); it has also been suggested that the derivation comes from the Chontal word &quot;yokatan&quot; meaning &quot;language&quot; or the region where the language is spoken.

The anecdote is so attractive that this story of the etymology of Yucatán (together with an exactly parallel, but apocryphal, story that &quot;kangaroo&quot; comes from some Aboriginal Australian&#x27;s expression for &quot;I don&#x27;t understand the question&quot;) is often repeated as trivia without much concern as to whether it is true.

==Battle of Catoche, exploration of the &quot;island&quot; of Yucatán, discovery of Lázaro (Campeche)==
The following day, as promised, the natives returned with more canoes, to transfer the Spaniards to land. They were alarmed that the shore was full of natives, and that consequently the landing might prove to be dangerous. Nonetheless, they landed as they were asked to by their until-now friendly host, the &quot;cacique&quot; (chief) of &quot;El gran Cairo&quot;, deciding however to land &quot;en masse&quot; using also their own launches as a precaution. It also appears they armed themselves with crossbows and muskets (&quot;escopetas&quot;); &quot;fifteen crossbows and ten muskets&quot;, if we credit the remarkably precise memory of Bernal Díaz del Castillo.

The Spaniards&#x27; fears were almost immediately confirmed. The chief had prepared an ambush for the Spaniards as they approached the town. They were attacked by a multitude of Indians, armed with pikes, bucklers, slings (Bernal says slings; Diego de Landa denies that the Indians of Yucatán were familiar with slings; he says they threw stones with their right hand, using the left to aim; but the sling was known in other parts of Mesoamerica, and the testimony of those at whom the stones were aimed seems worth crediting), arrows launched from a bow, and cotton armor. Only the surprise resulting from the effectiveness of the Spaniards&#x27; weapons — swords, crossbows, and firearms — put the more numerous Indians to flight, and allowed the Spaniards to re-embark, having suffered the first injuries of the expedition.

During this battle of Catoche two things occurred that were to greatly influence future events. The first was the capture of two Indians, taken back on board the Spanish ships. These individuals, who once baptized into the Roman Catholic faith received the names &quot;Julianillo&quot; and &quot;Melchorejo&quot; (anglicized, Julián and Melchior), would later become the first Maya language interpreters for the Spanish, on Grijalva&#x27;s subsequent expedition. The second originated from the curiosity and valor of the cleric González, chaplain of the group, who having landed with the soldiers, undertook to explore — and plunder — a pyramid and some &quot;adoratorios&quot; while his companions were trying to save their lives. González had the first view of Maya idols and he brought away with him pieces &quot;half of gold, and the rest copper&quot;, which in all ways would suffice to excite the covetousness of the Spaniards of Cuba upon the expedition&#x27;s return.

At least two soldiers died as a result of their injuries in this battle.

Returning in the ships, Antón de Alaminos imposed slow and vigilant navigation, moving only by day, because he was certain that Yucatán was an island. The travellers&#x27; greatest hardship, a scarcity of potable water aboard, added to their woes. The stores of water, casks and jugs were not of the quality required for long voyages (&quot;we were too poor to buy good ones&quot;, laments Bernal); the casks were constantly losing water and they also failed to keep it fresh, and so de Córdoba&#x27;s ships needed to replenish their supplies ashore. The Spaniards had already noted that the region seemed to be devoid of freshwater rivers.

Fifteen days after the battle at Catoche, the expedition landed to fill their water vessels near a Maya village they called Lázaro (after St Lazarus&#x27; Sunday, the day of their landing; &quot;The proper Indian name for it is &quot;Campeche&quot;&quot;, clarifies Bernal). Once again they were approached by Indians appearing to be peaceable, and the now-suspicious Spaniards maintained a heavy guard on their disembarked forces. During an uneasy meeting, the local Indians repeated a word (according to Bernal) that ought to have been enigmatic to the Spaniards: &quot;Castilan&quot;. This curious incident of the Indians apparently knowing the Spaniards&#x27; own word for themselves they later attributed the presence of the shipwrecked voyagers of de Nicuesa&#x27;s unfortunate 1511 fleet. Unbeknownst to de Córdoba&#x27;s men, the two remaining survivors, Jerónimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero, were living only several days&#x27; walk from the present site. The Spaniards would not learn of these two men until the expedition of Hernán Cortés, two years later.

The Spaniards found a solidly-built well the Indians used to provide themselves with fresh water from which the visitors filled their casks and jugs. The Indians, again with friendly aspect and manner, brought them to their village, where once more they could see solid constructions and many idols (Bernal alludes to the painted figures of serpents on the walls, so characteristic of Mesoamerica). They also met their first priests, with their white tunics and their long hair impregnated with human blood; this was the end of the Indians&#x27; friendly conduct: they convoked a great number of warriors and ordered them to burn some dry reeds, indicating to the Spaniards that if they weren&#x27;t gone before the fire went out, they would be attacked. Hernández&#x27;s men decided to retreat to the boats with their casks and jugs of water before the Indians could attack them, leaving safely behind them the discovery of Campeche.

==Champotón–Potonchán, and the &quot;Coast of the Evil Battle&quot;==
They sailed some six days in good weather and another four in a tempest that almost wrecked their ships. Their supply of good drinking water was now yet again exhausted, owing to the poor condition of the containers. Being now in an extreme situation, they stopped to gather water in a place that Bernal sometimes calls &quot;Potonchán&quot; and sometimes by its present-day name of &quot;Champotón&quot;, where the river of the same name meets the sea. When they had filled the jugs, they found themselves surrounded by great assemblies of Indians. They passed the night on land, with great precautions and wakeful vigilance.

This time the Spaniards decided not to take flight as in Lázaro-Campeche: they needed water, and any retreat, hindered by the Indians, seemed more dangerous than attack. They decided to stay and fight, but the outcome was bad for them: when dawn broke, they were evidently vastly outnumbered (by three hundred to one, claims Bernal), and only shortly into the ensuing battle Bernal speaks of eighty injured Spaniards. Keeping in mind that the original number of the expedition was about a hundred, not all soldiers, this suggests that at that moment the expedition was close to destruction. They soon discovered that the legions of Indians were being continually replenished by fresh reinforcements, and if good swords, crossbows, and muskets had astonished them at first, they had now overcome the surprise and maintained a certain distance from the Spaniards. At the cry of &quot;Calachuni&quot;, which the conquistadors soon learned was a word for &quot;chief&quot; or &quot;captain&quot;, the Indians were particularly merciless in attacking Hernández de Córdoba, who was hit by twelve arrows. The Spanish also learned the dedication of their opponents to capturing people alive: two were taken prisoner and certainly sacrificed afterwards; of one we know that his name was Alonso Boto, and of the other Bernal is only able to say of him that he was &quot;an old Portuguese&quot;.

Eventually, with only one Spanish soldier remaining unhurt, the captain practically unconscious, and the aggression of the Indians only increasing, they decided then that their only recourse was to form a close phalanx and break out of their encirclement in the direction of the launches, and to return to board them — leaving behind the water jugs — and get back to the ships. Fortunately for them, the Indians hadn&#x27;t concerned themselves to take away the boats or to render them useless, as they might easily have done. When attacking the retreating boats with arrows, stones, and pikes they made a particular effort to interfere with their balance by weight and impact, and ended up dumping some of the Spaniards into the water. The survivors of Hernández&#x27;s men had to get quickly out to their ships, half swimming and hanging onto the edges of the launches, but in the end they were recovered by the boat with the shallowest draught, and reached safety.

The Spaniards had lost 57 companions, including two who were taken alive. The survivors were badly injured, with the sole exception of a soldier named Berrio, who was surprisingly unscathed. Five died in the following days, the bodies being buried at sea.

The Spanish called the place the &quot;La Costa de Mala Pelea&quot; &quot;coast of the evil battle&quot;, a name it would have on maps for many years.

==Thirst, and return by way of Florida==
The expeditionaries had returned to the ships without the fresh water that had been the original reason to land. Furthermore, they saw their crew reduced by more than fifty men, many of them sailors, which combined with the great number of the seriously injured made it an impossibility to operate three ships. They broke up the ship of least draught burning it on the high sea, after having distributed to the others two its sails, anchors, and cables.

The thirst began to become intolerable. Bernal writes that their &quot;mouths and tongues were cracked&quot;, and of soldiers who were driven by desperation to drink brackish water at a place which they called &quot;El Estero de los Lagartos&quot;, because of the large alligators.

The pilots Alaminos, Camacho, and Álvarez decided, on the initiative of Alaminos, to navigate to Florida rather than head directly for Cuba. Alaminos remembered his exploration of Florida with Juan Ponce de León, and believed this to be the safest route, although promptly upon arriving in Florida he advised his companions of the bellicosity of the local Indians. In the event, the twenty people — among them, Bernal and the pilot Alaminos — who debarked in search of water were attacked by natives, although this time they came out victorious, with Bernal nonetheless receiving his third injury of the voyage, and Alaminos taking an arrow in the neck. A sentry - Berrio, the only soldier to escape from Champotón unscathed - disappeared. But the rest were able to return to the boat, and finally brought fresh water to alleviate the suffering of those who had remained with the boat, although one of them (according to Bernal) drank so much that he swelled up and died within a few days.

Now with fresh water, they headed to Havana in the two remaining ships, and not without difficulties — the boats were deteriorated and taking on water, and some mutinous sailors refused to work the pumps — they were able to complete their voyage and disembark in the port of Carenas (Havana).

Francisco Hernández de Córdoba barely reached Cuba; suffering from his mortal wounds, he expired within days of reaching the port, along with three other sailors.

==Consequences of the Spanish arrival at Yucatán==

The discovery of &quot;El Gran Cairo&quot;, in March 1517, was without a doubt a crucial moment in the Spanish perception of the natives of the Americas: until then, nothing had resembled the stories of Marco Polo, or the promises of Columbus, which prophesied Cathay, or even the Garden of Paradise, just past every cape or river. Even more than the later encounters with the Aztec and Inca cultures, &quot;El Gran Cairo&quot; resembled the conquistadors&#x27; dreams. When the news arrived in Cuba, the Spaniards gave new energy to their imaginations, creating again fantasies about the origin of the people they had encountered, whom they referred to as &quot;the Gentiles&quot; or imagined to be &quot;the Jews exiled from Jerusalem by Titus and Vespasian&quot;.

All of this encouraged two further expeditions: the first in 1518 under the command of Juan de Grijalva, and the second in 1519 under the command of Hernán Cortés, which led to the Spanish exploration, military invasion, and ultimately settlement and colonization known as the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire and subsequent Spanish colonization in present-day Mexico. Hernández did not live to see the continuation of his work; he died in 1517, the year of his expedition, as the result of the injuries and the extreme thirst suffered during the voyage and disappointed in the knowledge that Diego Velázquez had given precedence to Grijalva as the captain of the next expedition to Yucatán.

The importance given to the news, objects, and people that Hernández brought to Cuba can be gleaned from the speed with which the following expedition was prepared. The governor Diego Velázquez placed his relative Juan de Grijalva in charge of this second expedition, who had his entire confidence. The news that this &quot;island&quot; of Yucatán had gold, doubted by Bernal but enthusiastically maintained by Julianillo, the Maya prisoner taken at the battle of Catoche, fed the subsequent series of events that was to end with the Conquest of Mexico by the third flotilla sent, that of Hernán Cortés.

<text>John William Ormsby VC MM (10 January 1881 – 20 July 1952) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Ormsby was a career soldier first serving in the Second Boer War.

==Details==
He was 36 years old, and a sergeant in the 2nd Battalion, The King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 14 April 1917 at Fayet, France, during operations which culminated in the capture of an important position, Sergeant Ormsby, acting as company sergeant-major showed complete indifference to the heavy machine-gun and rifle fire and set a fine example. After clearing a village he pushed on and drove out many snipers from localities further forward. When the only surviving officer was wounded he took command of the company and led them forward under heavy fire for 400 yards to a new position, holding it until relieved.

==Medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry Museum, Doncaster, England.

<text>Arthur Poulter (16 December 1893 – 29 August 1956) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Poulter was 24 years old, and a private in the 1/4th Battalion, Duke of Wellington&#x27;s (West Riding) Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 10 April 1918, during Operation Georgette, the German II Bavarian Corps put pressure on 34 Division holding the salient around Armentieres. From 7.00am and through the morning, the Bavarians renewed their fierce attacks against 101 Brigade (plus the 11 Suffolks of 121 Brigade) that were holding the Fort Rompu-Erquinghem-Lys-Bois Grenier line. Although they broke through the British defences enough troops were scratched together to make a counter-attack that drove them out again. Although 101 Brigade was reinforced by 1/4 Duke of Wellingtons of 147 Brigade, 49 (West Riding) Division, 3rd Australian Tunnelling Company and F Special (Gas) Company of the Royal Engineers, their difficult tactical position and the numerical superior enemy put the Bavarians on the western edge of Erquinghem-Lys. A fierce rear guard action prevented the destruction of 101 Brigade. Orders to evacuate Armentieres were issued at 1050 hours but with communications cut, it was not until the afternoon that a fighting withdrawal could begin. Street fighting took place in the town held by the British since 1914. Fewer and fewer bridges remained. 102 Brigade, having received the orders first, crossed its entire force to the north side of the Lys by 6.20pm to defend Nieppe. 101 Brigade, the most heavily engaged unit, crossed the river but the 18/Northumberland Fusiliers and 1/4 Duke of Wellingtons took casualties. The Duke&#x27;s found themselves on the wrong side of the river and surrounded with no bridges left to cross. It was in this context that no. 24066 Private Arthur Poulter of the Duke&#x27;s won his Victoria Cross.

On 10 April 1918 at Erquinghem-Lys, France, Private Poulter, who was acting as a stretcher-bearer, on 10 occasions carried badly wounded men on his back through particularly heavy artillery and machine-gun fire. Two of the wounded were hit a second time whilst on his back. Again, after a withdrawal over the river had been ordered, Private Poulter returned in full view of the enemy and carried back another man who had been left behind wounded. He bandaged 40 men under fire and was seriously wounded when attempting another rescue in the face of the enemy.

==Further information==
* Before the war he was employed at the Timothy Taylor Brewery, Keighley, West Yorkshire.
* The Town of Erquinghem-Lys, France has erected a memorial to Pte Poulter, next to the railway line. In 2005 the keys to the town were presented to the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment (West Riding).

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross was donated, by his family (18 August 1999), to the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regimental Museum in Bankfield Museum, Halifax, West Yorkshire, England where it was on public display. The medal is now in a safe place; a replica is currently on display following an attempted burglary at the museum.

<text>Everard Aloysius Lisle Phillipps VC (28 May 1835 – 17 September 1857) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
After attending St Edmund&#x27;s College, Ware, in 1854 Everard Phillipps sailed for India to join the 11th Bengal Native Infantry. When the Indian Mutiny broke out in 1857, Phillipps&#x27; regiment was amongst the first to revolt. When the Queen&#x27;s proclamation against the insurgents came, he had to read it out as he could speak the native tongue. Riding boldly forward while the bullets whistled round him, he began to read the proclamation, but before he got to the end of the first sentence his horse was shot from under him, and he fell to the ground, himself wounded by a stray bullet. Undeterred, he sprang to his feet and read through the whole proclamation from beginning to end before taking cover. 

On the desertion of the Bengal Infantry, he then joined the 60th Rifles. He performed many gallant deeds, and in the months before his death he was wounded three times. At the Siege of Delhi, he captured the Water Bastion with a small party and was killed in the streets on 17 September 1857. His death was recorded in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 18 September.
Ensign Phillipps was awarded the Victoria Cross fifty years after his death. His citation reads:
His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<doc id="1220337" wikidata="Q670030" url="?curid=1220337" title="Issa Pliyev">
<text>Issa Alexandrovich Pliyev (also spelled as &quot;Pliev&quot;; ; ; — 6 February 1979) was a Soviet military commander. Pliyev rose to become the premier cavalry general of the Soviet Army. He became Army General (1962), twice Hero of the Soviet Union (16 April 1944 and 8 September 1945), Hero of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic (1971). 

During World War II, Pliyev commanded several mechanized cavalry units, ranging from regiments to army corps. The military historians David Glantz and Jonathan House described Pliyev as a &quot;great practitioner of cavalry operations in adverse terrain&quot;. However, Pliyev became known in the West largely for his involvement in the Cuban Missile Crisis.

==Early life and career==
Issa Pliyev started his military career in the Red Army in 1922, graduating from the Leningrad Cavalry school in 1926, from the Frunze Military Academy in 1933 and from the Soviet General Staff Academy. He joined the Communist party in 1926.

Upon graduation from the Red Army Frunze Military Academy he was appointed head of the operational department for the headquarters of the 5th Stavropol Cavalry Division named after M. F. Blinov in the Ukrainian Military District. Since June 1936 he was an instructor at the staff of the Joint Military School of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army in Ulaanbaatar. Since February 1939, he commanded the 48th Cavalry Regiment of the 6th Cavalry Division of the Belarusian Special Military District. At the head of the regiment, he took part in the campaign of the Red Army in Western Belarus in September 1939. 

==World War II==

At the start of the invasion of the Soviet Union, Pliyev commanded the 50th Cavalry Division (renamed 3rd Guards Cavalry Division). During early stages of operation Barbarossa the unit was sent under the command of the 30th army, being moved to the 22nd Army afterwards. He later participated in two raids on the rear of Army Group &quot;Center&quot; during the Battle of Smolensk, under the command of Dovator.

His unit participated in the Battle of Moscow and the Battle of Stalingrad. Pliyev served as 2nd in command under Lev Dovator who fought alongside Rokossovsky with the crucial 16th Army, holding the center defensive line of Moscow. In Soviet Union and Russia 28 Panfilov&#x27;s men became a symbol of defense for propaganda. The cavalrymen of Dovator were however mainly forgotten, even though they held their line alongside Panfilovs men. 

With Dovator killed in action and Belov promoted to army commander, Pliev was able to apply deep battle operations better than any other general, which would eventually make him the only Soviet cavalry personnel to be awarded two Heroes of the Soviet Union. His valuable experience serving directly under Lev Dovator while planning and fighting with the best especially in the early stages of the war made him stand out among others. When more tanks were added to the cavalry corps, Pliyev became the pioneer in the new cavalry mechanized groups who immediately proved themselves in battle, which made him well respected among his peers and soldiers. His forces, along with that of Pavel Belov, were considered the most successful cavalry units of the Battle of Moscow.

During the Battle of Stalingrad, the horsemen proved themselves once again, as Pliyev&#x27;s forces were the first to complete the encirclement of the German 6th Army, trapping 330,000 men inside the pocket. Issa would later command a cavalry-mechanized group consisting of 4th Guards Cavalry Corps and 4th Mechanized Corps during the Bereznegovatoye–Snigirevka Offensive along the Black Sea coast, as part of the 3rd Ukrainian Front under Army General Rodion Malinovsky.

Pliyev especially distinguished himself in the Bereznegovato-Snigireva and Odessa offensive operations conducted one after the other in March-April 1944. The mechanized cavalry group of General Pliev, introduced into the raid on the enemy&#x27;s rear in March 1944, ensured the encirclement and defeat of units from the 6th German Army. In April, the mechanized cavalry group forced the Southern Bug River, cut the enemy&#x27;s main communications and contributed to the capture of a number of large settlements by the front&#x27;s troops, including the city of Odessa. 

By the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR dated April 16, 1944, Lieutenant General Issa Alexandrovich Pliev was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union with the award of the Order of Lenin and the Gold Star medal for his skillful command of the troops, along with personal courage and heroism.

During Operation Bagration in the summer of 1944, part of the 1st Belorussian Front, Pliyev&#x27;s cavalry-mechanized group attacked towards Slutsk. According to Glantz and House, the unit was highly successful in exploiting the operational breakthrough. In the fall of 1944, he commanded a mechanized cavalry group consisting of two divisions during the Battle of Debrecen. The group was returned to the 3rd Ukrainian Front, where on October 3, 1944, General Pliyev was put in charge of the 4th and 6th Guards Cavalry Corps and the 7th Mechanized Corps, units created with the aim of a deep breakthrough into the enemy rear in the Debrecen operation on Hungarian territory. The breakthrough was successful, but once the enemy managed to cut the group&#x27;s communications, they spent over 10 days fighting in the enemy&#x27;s rear, dodging enemy tank attacks and delivering unexpected retaliatory strikes. Some occupied Hungarian cities had to be abandoned, but in the end the situation was turned in favor of the Soviet troops and Debrecen was taken.

The operations of Lieutenant General Pliev&#x27;s 1st Guards Cavalry Mechanized Group demonstrated the power of deep operations as it fought throughout Ukraine, Eastern Europe and into Germany. 

He ended the war in command of the Soviet-Mongolian Cavalry-Mechanized Group of the Transbaikal front in Manchuria, fighting against the Japanese Kwantung Army. For his success in defeating the Kwantung Army, he was awarded his second Gold Star Medal of the Hero of the Soviet Union.

==Post-war==
After the war, Pliyev continued his career in the military, and took command of the Stavropol Military District in February 1946. In June he became commander of the 9th Mechanized Army, stationed in Romania with the Southern Group of Forces, and he commanded 13th Army between February 1947 and 1949, in western Ukraine. Pliyev graduated from higher academic courses at the Military Academy of the General Staff in 1949, and in April took command of the 4th Army in the Transcaucasian Military District. In June 1955, he was appointed First Deputy commander of the North Caucasus Military District, succeeding to command of the district in April 1958.

On 27 April 1962 Pliyev was promoted to Army General. In June his troops took part in suppressing Novocherkassk riots. During the Cuban Missile Crisis he was the commander of a Group of Soviet forces as part of Operation Anadyr in Cuba from July 1962 to May 1963. After returning from Cuba, he assumed command of the North Caucasus Military District once more.

In June 1968, Pliyev became an advisor for the Ministry of Defense of the USSR&#x27;s Group of Inspectors General, a position for elderly senior officers. He lived in Rostov-on-Don and died on 6 February 1979 in Moscow. Pliyev was buried in the Walk of Fame in Vladikavkaz.

==Awards==
Pliyev was awarded five Orders of Lenin, three Orders of the Red Banner, two Orders of Suvorov (1st Class), Order of Kutuzov (1st Class), numerous medals and nine foreign orders. He was decorated twice Hero of the Soviet Union.

<doc id="1220338" wikidata="Q861935" url="?curid=1220338" title="Bill Beaumont">
<text>Sir William Blackledge Beaumont (born 9 March 1952) is an English former rugby union player, and was captain of the England rugby union team, earning 34 caps. His greatest moment as captain was the unexpected 1980 Grand Slam win. He played as a lock.

He is currently the interim chairman of the Rugby Football Union, having previously held the position from 2012 to 2016, and was chairman of World Rugby from July 2016 to November 2024.

==Early life and youth==

Beaumont was educated at Cressbrook School, Kirkby Lonsdale (also attended by another England and British Lions player, John Spencer) and Ellesmere College in Shropshire. He joined Fylde Rugby Club, Lancashire, in 1969 when he was 17 years old and stayed with the club until injury forced his retirement in 1982.

==Playing career==

Beaumont won 34 caps for England, then a record for a lock, and was captain 21 times. He made his international debut as a 22-year-old in Dublin in 1975 as a late replacement for Roger Uttley. He toured Australia in 1975, Japan, Fiji and Tonga in 1979, and Argentina in 1981 with England. He played 15 times for the Barbarians, including the match against the All Blacks in 1978.

Beaumont took part in the 1977 British Lions tour to New Zealand after being called up as a replacement when Nigel Horton broke his thumb, and played in the final three tests.

He took over as England captain in Paris in 1978. He was an inspiring captain of the North of England, whom he led to victory over the All Blacks in 1979, and also of England, who won their first Grand Slam for 23 years in 1980.

Beaumont then captained the 1980 British Lions tour to South Africa playing in 10 of the 18 matches. He was the first English captain of the Lions since Doug Prentice in 1930.

Beaumont retired from rugby in 1982 on medical advice from doctors, because of successive concussions.

==Media and business==

Beaumont became a regular contestant on the BBC quiz show &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;, eventually becoming the show&#x27;s second longest-serving captain (14 years in total), only being surpassed by fellow Rugby Union player Matt Dawson in 2018. The opposing captains were Willie Carson, Emlyn Hughes and Ian Botham. Beaumont hosted two episodes of the show in 1996 in the regular host David Coleman&#x27;s absence: Will Carling stood in as captain for Beaumont&#x27;s team.

He was the managing director of his family&#x27;s textile business in Lancashire, which is the only remaining textile manufacturer in Chorley, but resigned in May 2017.

==Rugby administration==
Beaumont has represented England since 1999 on the International Rugby Board (now World Rugby). He was the tour manager for the 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. In January 2012 he put his name forward to become the next Rugby Football Union (RFU) chairman, and was appointed as the chairman on 8 July 2012.
He then applied for the role of Chairman of World Rugby to replace Bernard Lapasset and on 11 May 2016 he was unanimously elected to the office, with his tenure beginning on 1 July 2016. Beaumont returned as interim chairman of the RFU in December 2024 after the resignation of Tom Ilube.

He is an Honorary President of the rugby charity Wooden Spoon that funds projects for disadvantaged children and young people in Britain and Ireland.

In 2007 the Rugby Football Union announced that the winners of the English County Championship would be awarded the Bill Beaumont Cup.

Already Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours He was knighted in the Queen&#x27;s New Years Honours list in 2019. and appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the 2024 New Year Honours for services to rugby football and charity.

He is a Deputy Lieutenant of Lancashire.

<text>Chief Petty Officer George Henry Prowse VC, DCM (29 August 1886 – 27 September 1918) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He served with the Royal Naval Division during the Gallipoli Campaign and in France on the Western Front where he was killed in action before the award of either of his decorations was announced.

== Naval service ==
According to his service record, which has been placed online by The National Archives, Prowse was born on 28 August 1896, however the Commonwealth War Graves Commission gives his age at death as 32, which would place his birth in 1886. Recent research in South Wales has unearthed a birth certificate that shows he was actually born on 29 August 1886 in Brynsion Terrace, Gilfach Goch, Llantrisant and a Blue plaque was placed on the house (Brynsion Terrace has since been renamed to be part of High Street) by the local council, Rhondda Cynon Taff on 21 October 2006. He enlisted in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve for the Royal Naval Division, on 26 February 1915. The details recorded in his service record show he was living in the Landore area of Swansea, Wales with his wife Sarah; he had been working as a collier, was tall, had grey eyes, brown hair and a &quot;fair&quot; complexion. At some time he relocated to Camerton in Somerset, probably to work in the coal mines there. In the churchyard at Camerton there is a war memorial with his name shown.

Prowse was initially rated Ordinary Seaman, on 5 May 1915 he was promoted to Able Seaman (rank). After completing training at Blandford, in September 1915 he was posted to the Drake Battalion, which was then engaged in the Gallipoli Campaign. It is not clear how much active service Prowse saw at this time as he spent significant periods hospitalised with first jaundice and then gastroenteritis, finally rejoining his battalion in Egypt on 9 January 1916. The division remained engaged in the Gallipoli Campaign until May 1916 when it was transferred to France. Prowse arrived at Marseilles on 7 June 1916, on 20 June he was promoted Petty Officer.

In November 1916 the Division was employed in the Battle of the Ancre, the final attempt to resolve the Battle of the Somme. Prowse received a gunshot wound in his left thigh on 13 November (the opening day of the battle) and after initial treatment in France was admitted to a hospital in Epsom on 17 November. Having been discharged from hospital, he went back to the base at Blandford on 9 January 1917, and eventually returned to his battalion in France on 28 March 1917.

In August 1918 Prowse was recommended for the award of the DCM. The citation, published posthumously in 1919 stated
Prowse was about 32 years old, and a Chief Petty Officer in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, (Drake Battalion, Royal Naval Division) during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 2 September 1918 at Pronville, France, Chief Petty Officer Prowse led a small party of men against an enemy strong-point, capturing it, together with 23 prisoners and 5 machine-guns. On three other occasions he displayed great heroism in dealing with difficult and dangerous situations, and at one time he dashed forward and attacked and captured two machine-gun posts, killing six of the enemy and taking 13 prisoners and two machine-guns. He was the only survivor of this gallant party, but his action enabled the battalion to push forward in comparative safety.

===Citation===
He was killed in action, Anneux, France, on 27 September 1918.

==Medal award==
Sarah Prowse was presented with her husband&#x27;s Victoria Cross by H.M. King George V at Buckingham Palace on 17 July 1919, after all the live recipients. She led the list of posthumous awards and was presented with the last VC with the blue naval ribbon.

Prowse&#x27;s Victoria Cross is in the Lord Ashcroft VC Collection at the Imperial War Museum.

<text>The Hungarian Workers&#x27; Party (, ) is a communist party in Hungary led by Gyula Thürmer. Established after the fall of the communist Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic, the party has yet to win a seat in the Hungarian parliament. Until May 2009, it was a member of the Party of the European Left. It was formed from, and considers itself the successor to, the former ruling Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party. Despite having run in every parliamentary election since 1990, the party has never won seats.

== History ==
The party was established as the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party on 17 December 1989 as a successor party of the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (MSZMP) by a small group of old MSZMP members who opposed its transformation into the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP). Among them was Károly Grósz, the last general secretary of the old MSZMP, who became the new party&#x27;s acting chairman

In the 1990 elections it received around 3% of the national vote, the largest share for a party that failed to win a seat.

In 1993 the party adopted the name Workers&#x27; Party, and in the same year a group of hard-liners broke away to form another Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party. In the 1994 elections, the party won a similar share of the vote, again emerging as the largest party without a seat. Despite increasing its vote share to around 4% in the 1998 elections, the party again remained seatless. In the 2002 elections, the party&#x27;s vote share fell to around 2%, and for the first time since 1990, not the largest party without parliamentary representation.

On 12 November 2005 it became the Hungarian Communist Workers&#x27; Party when a split led to the formation of the Workers&#x27; Party of Hungary 2006 led by János Fratanolo. In the 2006 elections the party received less than 0.5% of the national vote, whilst in the 2010 elections, its vote share fell to just 0.1%. On 11 May 2013 the party was renamed again, this time becoming the Hungarian Workers&#x27; Party due to a law passed the previous year banning the public use of names associated with &quot;authoritarian regimes of the 20th century.&quot; In the 2014 parliamentary election, the party received 0.56% of the votes, again the largest party without parliamentary seats.

Since the end of the 2010s, the supposedly left-wing party has been moving closer and closer to the policies of the ruling party, the right-wing populist Fidesz, and Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. In the 2022 elections, the party campaigned on a platform very similar to that of the governing party. And after Fidesz&#x27;s landslide victory, Gyula Thürmer said that Fidesz deserved to win.

==Ideology==
The party opposed Hungary joining NATO. In 1996 the party organised a countrywide collection of signatures for a referendum on NATO membership. This HCWP-led referendum drive failed, although another referendum on NATO membership was held in 1997, which resulted in a vote in favour. The party continues to oppose the country&#x27;s participation in NATO and other military organisations. It campaigns to have all Hungarian forces returned from abroad and to reduce the military budget. The party opposed NATO campaigns in Yugoslavia against Slobodan Milošević and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. 

On the question of the 2016 migrant quota referendum, the party called for a &quot;no&quot; vote, expressing opposition to what it perceives as &quot;EU aggression&quot; against Hungary.

Other foreign policies are in favour of
*a peaceful and just settlement of the Middle East crisis, in favour of the &quot;progressive&quot; Arab countries.
*a foreign policy based upon &quot;good relations&quot; with all parts of the world.

<doc id="1220345" wikidata="Q709272" url="?curid=1220345" title="EPSXe">
<text>ePSXe (&quot;enhanced PSX emulator&quot;) is a PlayStation video game console emulator for x86-based PC hardware with Microsoft Windows and Linux, as well as devices running Android. It was written by three authors, using the aliases &quot;calb&quot;, &quot;_Demo_&quot; and &quot;Galtor&quot;. ePSXe is closed source with the exception of the application programming interface (API) for its plug-ins.

== Development ==
For half a year, ePSXe was developed in private, with part of this initial development being carried out by _Demo_, previously known for his work on the Super Nintendo emulator ZSNES. When released on October 14, 2000, ePSXe was a revolution in the PlayStation emulation scene, boasting higher compatibility and performance than other emulators of the system at the time.

After ePSXe 1.6.0 was released on August 5, 2003, its development seemed to halt, with speculation that the source code had been lost due to a hard disk failure. However, on April 5, 2008, the developers of ePSXe made a public statement revealing that in the summer of 2007, they had decided to continue development of the emulator, due to encouragement from users. On May 24, 2008, ePSXe version 1.7.0 was released.

After another hiatus, the developers came back on August 30, 2012, announcing the release of ePSXe for Android, as well as stating that ePSXe for Windows was in testing of version 1.8.0. This version was released on November 9, 2012., being followed by 1.9.0 in 2013 and ePSXe 1.9.25 in 2015.

== Features ==
ePSXe was one of the early emulators to make use of plug-ins to emulate GPU, SPU (sound), and CD-ROM drive functions, a model first established in PSEmu Pro. Games can be loaded from the computer&#x27;s CD drive or from one of many types of CD images directly from the user&#x27;s hard drive.

A patching feature allows the user to apply game patches. Games that do not necessarily run properly, or even start at all, can be fixed and played via the use of ePSXe patch files in .ppf format. Not all games prone to bugs have ppf patches written for them.

Until version 1.9.25, ePSXe could only function with an image of an official Sony PlayStation BIOS. Since the various PlayStation BIOS images are copyrighted by Sony, it is illegal to distribute them. For this reason, ePSXe does not come bundled with any of the PlayStation BIOS images, requiring the user to provide one for the emulator. Version 1.9.25 added HLE BIOS support, allowing it to mimic the effect of the PlayStation&#x27;s BIOS, although compatibility is currently lower than an official BIOS.

=== Plug-ins ===
* GPU: Most GPU plug-ins run with either Direct3D, OpenGL, or the Glide API, and are available as freeware or open-source. Many GPU plugins require game-specific hacks to run games.
* SPU: The SPU plug-ins can emulate everything from music to sound effects, with varying degrees of success depending on the plug-in settings, and of course the plug-in being used
* CD-ROM: ePSXe comes with a core CD-ROM plug-in, but many others are available for freeware download and many can emulate up to seven different types of read modes
* Input: The core plug-in is sufficient, but there are others that allow for more functionality.

=== Compatibility ===
ePSXe is able to run most PlayStation games somewhat accurately. Few games run flawlessly without extensive configuration and trial by error testing. In the case that a game does not run successfully, patches written for the game in question can be used, though few games have patches available.

== Releases ==

=== For PC ===

=== For Android ===

== Reception ==
Retro Gamer called ePSXe &quot;the best free PlayStation emulator&quot;. Techtree stated &quot;ePSXe is the best free PlayStation emulator&quot;.

Pcnexus says &quot;the easiest PS1 emulator for android with downloadable cheat codes and great game compatibilty with PS1 roms&quot;.

<text>William Ratcliffe VC MM (18 January 1884 – 26 March 1963) was an English private of South Lancashire Regiment. He was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
William Ratcliffe was born on 18 January 1884 at 38 Newhall Street, Liverpool, Lancashire. His parents were William Ratcliffe and Mary Ann Kelly. He was baptised at St Vincent de Paul Roman Catholic Church on 21 January 1884. His birth was not registered by his mother until 31 March 1884. His mother gave his month of birth as February in order to avoid late registration of the birth. He was educated at St. Vincent de Paul&#x27;s Roman Catholic School in Norfolk Street, Liverpool. 

Ratcliffe worked on the Liverpool docks briefly after leaving school, then joined the British Army at the age of 17 and served in South Africa during the Second Boer War and in India. He initially served with the South Lancashire Regiment, 3rd Battalion and later transferred to the Durham Light Infantry. By 1914 he had left the army and was back working as a docker in Liverpool. When war was declared he quickly re-joined, enlisting with the South Lancashire Regiment in August 1914. He won the Military Medal and Victoria Cross at the Battle of Messines (1917).

In 1929 Victoria Cross winners were invited, by the Prince of Wales, to attend a dinner at the Royal Gallery of the House of Lords. Ratcliffe was reluctant to attend due to lack of funds. After a newspaper story was published about him, the people of Liverpool raised money to kit him out in a new suit suitable for the occasion. He worked on the Liverpool Docks until an industrial accident forced him into early retirement in the 1940s. In 1956 he attended the Centennial of the institution of the Victoria Cross in London&#x27;s Hyde Park, where the living holders were reviewed by Queen Elizabeth II. On this occasion the Victoria Cross Association paid for a new suit and accommodation. 

==Details==
Ratcliffe was 33 years old, and a private in the 2nd Battalion, the South Lancashire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place during the Battle of Messines for which he was awarded the VC.

On 14 June 1917 at Messines, Belgium, after an enemy trench had been captured, Private Ratcliffe located an enemy machine-gun which was firing on his comrades from the rear, and single-handed, on his own initiative, immediately rushed the machine-gun position and bayoneted the crew. He then brought the gun back into action in the front line. Private Ratcliffe had displayed similar gallantry and resource on previous occasions.

==The medal==
His VC is on loan to the Imperial War Museum in Lambeth Road, London.

<doc id="1220348" wikidata="Q1200237" url="?curid=1220348" title="Dermatofibroma">
<text>A dermatofibroma, or benign fibrous histiocytomas, is a benign nodule in the skin, typically on the legs, elbows or chest of an adult. It is usually painless.

It usually ranges from 0.2cm to 2cm in size but larger examples have been reported. It typically results from mild trauma such as an insect bite. Risk factors for developing multiple dermatofibromas include lupus, HIV, blood cancer and some medicines that weaken immunity.

It is usually diagnosed by its appearance, but a biopsy may be required. Other bumps such as granular cell tumor, melanoma, clear cell acanthoma and dermatofibrosis lenticularis disseminata may look similar. Usually no treatment is needed. It can remain unchanged for years but can resolve spontaneously.

==Signs and symptoms==
Dermatofibromas are hard solitary slow-growing papules (rounded bumps) that appear in a variety of colours, usually brownish to tan. They are often elevated or pedunculated. A dermatofibroma is associated with the dimple sign; by applying lateral pressure, there is a central depression of the dermatofibroma. Although typical dermatofibromas cause little or no discomfort, itching and tenderness can occur. Dermatofibromas can be found anywhere on the body, but most often they are found on the legs and arms. They occur more often in women; the male to female ratio is about 1:4. The age group in which they most commonly occur is 20 to 45 years.

Some physicians and researchers believe dermatofibromas form as a reaction to previous injuries such as insect bites or thorn pricks. They are composed of disordered collagen laid down by fibroblasts. Dermatofibromas are classed as benign skin lesions, meaning they are completely harmless, though they may be confused with a variety of subcutaneous tumours. Deep penetrating dermatofibromas may be difficult to distinguish, even histologically, from rare malignant fibrohistocytic tumours like dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.

Dermatofibromas typically have a positive &quot;buttonhole sign&quot;, or central dimpling in the center.

<text>Frampton Comes Alive! is a double live album by the English musician and songwriter Peter Frampton, released in 1976 by A&amp;M Records. Following four studio albums with little success and sales, &quot;Frampton Comes Alive!&quot; was a breakthrough for Frampton and is one of the best-selling live albums ever. &quot;Show Me the Way&quot;, &quot;Baby, I Love Your Way&quot;, and &quot;Do You Feel Like We Do&quot; were released as singles; all three reached the top 15 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and frequently receive airplay on classic rock radio stations. 

Released on 15 January 1976, &quot;Frampton Comes Alive!&quot; debuted on the charts at No. 191. It reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 the week ending 10 April 1976, spending 10 non-consecutive weeks in the top spot through October. It was the best-selling album of 1976 and has sold over 8,000,000 copies in the United States.

&quot;Frampton Comes Alive!&quot; was voted &quot;Album of the Year&quot; in a 1976 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers&#x27; poll. It stayed on the chart for 97 weeks and was still No. 14 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s 1977 year-end album chart. It was ranked No. 41 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;50 Greatest Live Albums of All Time&quot; list. Readers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it No. 3 in a 2012 poll of all-time favourite live albums.

In 2020, &quot;Frampton Comes Alive!&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Background and recording==
The album was recorded between June and November 1975, primarily at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco as well as Marin Veterans&#x27; Memorial Auditorium in San Rafael, California, Long Island Arena in Commack, New York, and a concert on the SUNY Plattsburgh campus in Plattsburgh, New York. The Winterland songs were recorded on a 24-track master recorder. Other concerts were captured on a 16-track recorder. Recordings from four shows were used for the original album. Master tapes were recorded at 15 inches per second using professional Dolby &quot;A&quot; noise reduction.

The live album had been intended to be a single LP disc, but at the suggestion of A&amp;M Records, additional shows were recorded, and the album expanded to two LPs for release. On the special features for the &quot;Live in Detroit&quot; concert DVD, Frampton commented that some difficulty was encountered in the mixing after the microphone cable to the bass drum microphone was inadvertently pulled, accidentally causing the microphone to face at a 90-degree angle from the drumhead. During the concerts, Frampton principally used a distinctive modified black 1954 Gibson Les Paul Custom electric guitar (with three Humbucker pick-ups as opposed to the usual P90 and AlNiCo Staple pickups). On &quot;In the Studio with Redbeard&quot;, Frampton said, &quot;The album is mostly live except for the first verse of &#x27;Something&#x27;s Happening&#x27;, the electric rhythm guitar on &#x27;Show Me the Way&#x27; (the talk-box came out but the engineer forgot to move the mic) and the intro piano on &#x27;I Wanna Go to the Sun&#x27; were fixed in the studio but the rest was all live (all the guitar solos, acoustic guitars, electric keyboards, drums, bass guitar and rest of vocals)&quot;.

==Release==
The double album was released in the U.S. at a reduced list price of $7.98, only $1.00 more than the standard $6.98 of most single-disc albums in 1976. It was pressed in &quot;automatic sequence,&quot; with sides one and four on one record and sides two and three on the other. This arrangement facilitated sequential listening on automatic record changers.

The album produced 3 hit singles: &quot;Baby, I Love Your Way,&quot; &quot;Do You Feel Like We Do,&quot; and &quot;Show Me the Way.&quot; The talk box guitar effect became closely associated with Frampton due to its use in the latter two singles. The single version of &quot;Do You Feel Like We Do&quot; was edited to 7:19 from the original 14:15 album version, making it one of the longest singles to reach the top 40, surpassing The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Hey Jude&quot; at 7:11. The B-side of &quot;Do You Feel Like We Do,&quot; the acoustic instrumental &quot;Penny for Your Thoughts,&quot; was the shortest track on &quot;Frampton Comes Alive,&quot; at 1:23.

In January 2001, a 25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition of the album was released. It featured 4 additional tracks not present in the original version, one recorded in a radio studio and not part of the main concert program. The track sequence was revised to more accurately reflect the original concert set list. Frampton produced the remixed and extended album and performed live with the original band at Tower Records in Los Angeles to promote the release.

<text>Private Jacob Rivers VC (17 November 1881 – 12 March 1915) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was posthumously awarded the VC during the First World War for his actions during the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March 1915.

==Early life==
Jacob Rivers&#x27; was born at Bridgegate in Derby, England, on 17 November 1881. Other than that he was one of seven children of Adeline Rivers, little is known of his formative years. He joined the British Army in June 1899, and was posted to the Royal Scots Fusiliers. A period of seven years service followed, mainly in British India and Burma. He was discharged in 1907 and was placed on the military reserve.

After service in the army, Rivers worked for the Midland Railway between/June 1911 and August 1914.

==First World War==
At the start of the First World War, which began for Britain in August 1914, Rivers was employed by the Midland Railway Company in Derby, working as labourer on a ballast train. He volunteered for the British Army and was posted to the 1st Battalion of The Sherwood Foresters (The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment). The regiment was serving on the Western Front by the end of the year as part of the 8th Division.

In early 1915, the division was assigned to an offensive designed to breach the German lines at Neuve Chapelle in France. For the start of the offensive, on 10 March 1915, Rivers&#x27; battalion was in reserve but was brought into action the following day when it had to advance towards the village of Pietre. The movement of the battalion was halted by machine-gun posts and they had to dig in. During a German counterattack the next day, the battalion was under considerable pressure on its right flank. Rivers cautiously approached the German position and threw several bombs on them, forcing the withdrawal of the garrison. Later in the day, he repeated the effort on another position but was killed. For his actions, he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation reads as follows:
He was buried in a battlefield grave which was later lost. He is commemorated on the Le Touret Memorial.

==The medal==
King George V presented Rivers&#x27; VC to his mother on 29 November 1916, in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. On his mother&#x27;s death in 1937, his VC was donated to his regiment. The VC is displayed at the Sherwood Foresters Museum in Nottingham.

In 2010, The Nottingham Castle Victoria Cross Memorial, which lists Rivers among the 20 VC recipients from Nottinghamshire, was unveiled at Nottingham Castle. On 12 March 2017, the 102nd anniversary of his death, a plaque commemorating Rivers was unveiled at platform 1 of Derby railway station.

<doc id="1220357" wikidata="Q3046393" url="?curid=1220357" title="That's Entertainment!">
<text>That&#x27;s Entertainment! is a 1974 American compilation film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to celebrate the studio&#x27;s 50th anniversary. The success of the retrospective prompted a 1976 sequel, the related 1985 film &quot;That&#x27;s Dancing!&quot;, and a third installment in 1994.

== Background ==
Compiled by its writer-producer-director, Jack Haley Jr., under the supervision of executive producer Daniel Melnick, the film turned the spotlight on MGM&#x27;s legacy of musical films from the 1920s through the 1950s, culling dozens of performances from the studio&#x27;s movies, and featuring archive footage of Judy Garland, Eleanor Powell, Lena Horne, Esther Williams, Ann Miller, Kathryn Grayson, Howard Keel, Jeanette MacDonald, Cyd Charisse, June Allyson, Clark Gable, Mario Lanza, William Warfield, and many others.

Various segments were hosted by a succession of the studio&#x27;s legendary stars: Frank Sinatra, Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Peter Lawford, Debbie Reynolds, Bing Crosby, James Stewart, Elizabeth Taylor, Mickey Rooney, Donald O&#x27;Connor, and Liza Minnelli, representing her mother Judy Garland.

The host segments for &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; constitute some of the final footage to be captured on the famous MGM backlot, which appears severely dilapidated in 1973, because MGM had sold the property to developers and the sets were about to be demolished. Several of the hosts, including Bing Crosby, remark on the backlot&#x27;s crumbling conditions during their segments; the most notable deterioration can be seen when Fred Astaire revisits the ruins of the train station set that had been used in several films including the opening of &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; 20 years earlier, and when Peter Lawford revisits exteriors used in his 1947 musical &quot;Good News&quot;.

The title of the film derives from the anthemic song &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot;, by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz, introduced in the 1953 MGM musical &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;. The film title is usually expressed with an exclamation mark, but in some contexts, the punctuation is dropped, as in the movie poster.

== Release ==
The film premiered at the Loew&#x27;s Beverly Theater in Beverly Hills on the evening of May 17, 1974. MGM billed it as their greatest premiere in a quarter century. There was a red carpet from the Loew&#x27;s Beverly Theater to the Beverly Wilshire Hotel for the post-screening dinner and dancing. Also promoted were the 100 movie stars in attendance. Anyone paying $100 per seat for the dinner could sit at a table with a movie star. The premiere also featured several live introductions to the various on-screen segments; it was co-hosted by Sammy Davis Jr. and Liza Minnelli and featured live stage appearances by Debbie Reynolds, Frank Sinatra, Gene Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor, and others. The premiere, as an event and a party, was a dazzling success. However, as a publicity event for MGM, it was completely overshadowed; the expected press were all across town covering the breaking news of the Symbionese Liberation Army shootout that night. The film had its New York premiere on May 23 and opened the following day at the Ziegfeld Theatre. The film opened nationwide in June 1974.

== Reception ==
The film grossed $25,600 in its first week in Los Angeles and did even better the following week with $45,000. Over the 4-day Memorial Day weekend at the Ziegfeld it grossed $71,164. The film was United Artists&#x27; highest-grossing film of the year. Adjusted for inflation, the film has grossed $19.1 million worldwide.

== Sequels ==
Despite statements made in the original theatrical trailer and promotional materials that such a production would never be repeated, &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; is one of the few documentaries to spawn official sequels.

&quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment, Part II&quot; was released in 1976. The use of multiple hosts was dropped for this production, instead Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly returned to co-host the retrospective, which expanded beyond musicals to pay tribute to MGM&#x27;s dramatic and comedy stars as well. The sequel would turn out to be the last time Astaire and Kelly danced together on film.

&quot;That&#x27;s Dancing!&quot; was released in 1985. Unlike the two prior &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; films, this documentary was not limited exclusively to MGM productions. The film is closely related to the &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; series, with shared studio and producers credits, but also since its opening credits contain a card with the title &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot; (not to be confused with the subsequent 1994 film).

&quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot; was released in 1994. The film featured more archival footage, with a distinct focus on previously unreleased (or rarely seen) material cut from the MGM films.

Gene Kelly is the only individual to host in all four films.

== Home media ==
All three &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; films were released to DVD in 2004. The box set collection of the films included a bonus DVD that included additional musical numbers that had been cut from MGM films as well as the first release of the complete performance of &quot;Mr. Monotony&quot; by Judy Garland (the version used in &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot; is truncated). &quot;That&#x27;s Dancing!&quot; received a separate DVD release in 2007. The MGM trilogy also received a Blu-ray release in the late 2000s; the bonus content of the DVD box set was spread among the three films rather than presented as a standalone disc. In January 2023, the film was added to MGM+ to celebrate the network and streaming platform&#x27;s rebranding from Epix; Judy Garland&#x27;s recording of the titular song would also serve as the music for the rebrand&#x27;s promotional trailer released at that time concurrently. It has since been removed from the service.

<text>That&#x27;s Entertainment! III is a 1994 American compilation film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to celebrate the studio&#x27;s 70th anniversary. It was the third and final series of retrospectives that began with the first &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; (1974) and &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment, Part II&quot; (1976).

Unlike the previous two films, the third installment &quot;focuses on outtakes, unfinished numbers and behind-the-scenes glimpses of the old musicals.&quot;

Hosts for the film were Gene Kelly (in his last film appearance), June Allyson, Cyd Charisse, Lena Horne, Howard Keel, Ann Miller, Debbie Reynolds, Mickey Rooney, and Esther Williams, making her first appearance in a theatrical film in more than 30 years. &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot; had a limited theatrical release in 1994. According to film historian Robert Osborne, writing for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; at the time, the film did &quot;pleasant business&quot; at New York&#x27;s &quot;Ziegfeld Theatre&quot;.

== Critical response ==
Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, film critic Caryn James called the film &quot;a lively and funny compilation of curiosities suggesting what might have been.&quot; James wrote that the &quot;one real problem&quot; with the film was that many of the clips were very short. &quot;Because these excerpts are so much weaker than the glorious musical numbers, excerpted at greater length in the first &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!,&quot; it makes some sense to cut them drastically. But over the course of a two-hour film, the effect is jarring, like stop-and-go driving in heavy traffic.&quot;

Critic Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars. He praised its focus on musical numbers that did not appear on screen due to any number of factors, including &quot;commerce, taste, race, sex and running time.&quot; He called it &quot;a genuinely fascinating film, one that may tell more about MGM musicals, and aspects of American society, than a film devoted to still more highlights from musical numbers that did make their way into films.&quot;

== DVD release ==
All three films were released to DVD in 2004. The box set collection of the films included a bonus DVD that included additional musical numbers that had been cut from MGM films as well as the first release of the complete performance of &quot;Mr. Monotony&quot; by Judy Garland (the version used in &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot; is truncated). The home video version of &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot; also contains several musical numbers not seen in the theatrical release. The film was later remastered for high-definition release on Blu-ray and HD DVD.

<text>That&#x27;s Dancing! is a 1985 American compilation film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer that looked back at the history of dancing in film. Unlike the &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; series, this film not only focuses specifically on MGM films, but also included films from other studios.

A highlight of the film was the first theatrical release of a complete dance routine by Ray Bolger for his &quot;If I Only Had a Brain&quot; number that had been shortened in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

== Summary ==
The hosts for this film are Gene Kelly (who also executive produced), Ray Bolger (his last film appearance before his death in 1987), Liza Minnelli, Sammy Davis Jr., and Mikhail Baryshnikov. Pop singer Kim Carnes was commissioned to sing an original song, &quot;Invitation to Dance&quot;, that plays over the closing credits.

This film is sometimes considered part of the &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; series, especially since its starting credits contain a card with the &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot; title (not to be confused with the 1994 film), but even though it shared studio and producers, it is considered a separate production. Jack Haley Jr., who wrote, produced and directed the first &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; film, also wrote and directed this one, co-producing with longtime friend David Niven Jr. Haley&#x27;s father, Jack Haley, had co-starred with Bolger in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

== Dedication ==
This film is dedicated to &quot;all&quot; dancers, especially those who devoted their lives to the development of their art long before there was a motion picture camera.

== Home media ==
&quot;That&#x27;s Dancing!&quot; was not included when the three &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; films were released on DVD in 2004; it was instead released on its own in 2007. The DVD includes several behind-the-scenes promotional featurettes from 1985 on the making of the film, as well as its accompanying music video featuring Kim Carnes singing &quot;Invitation to Dance&quot; although the DVD omits both the video and song itself.

<text>Rurik (Ric) Nordman (October 18, 1919 in Cypress River, Manitoba – July 29, 1996 in Winnipeg, Manitoba) was a businessman and politician in Manitoba, Canada.

Nordman served on Winnipeg City Council, representing the St. Charles Ward from 1974 until 1981.

In the provincial election of 1981 Nordman defeated NDP candidate Max Melnyk by over 1,000 votes to be elected a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba, representing the riding of Assiniboia for the Progressive Conservative Party. In the 1986 election, he faced Melnyk again and won by a greater margin. He was narrowly defeated by Liberal Ed Mandrake in the provincial election of 1988, ironically as the Progressive Conservatives won a minority government. He did not seek a return to politics before his death in 1996.

Nordman was generally respected by members on all sides of the house.

Nordman served in the Canadian Army from 1940 to 1945, reaching the rank of Captain.

Nordman worked as a restaurateur following the war, and eventually operated a number of successful businesses in Manitoba and California. Ric served two different terms as President of Kirkfield Park Community Club in the mid 1960s as well as being one of the founders of the St. James Canadians Jr. Hockey Club. He was also a founding member of Messiah Lutheran Church in Westwood, and a board member of the Rainbow Stage Theatre.

In 1992, Nordman was awarded the 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada Medal by Premier Gary Filmon in recognition of his service to the community.

Ric Nordman died in Winnipeg at the age of 77 and was survived by his wife, Kathleen (Kae) Nordman, and their two sons Grant and Greg.

Ric&#x27;s oldest son, Grant Nordman, was elected as the City Councillor for St. Charles Ward on October 25, 2006, 32 years after his father was first elected to that office. In 2011, his son Greg ran for city council in St. Vital Ward.

<doc id="1220388" wikidata="Q1053364" url="?curid=1220388" title="Cempoala">
<text>Cempoala or Zempoala (Nahuatl &quot;Cēmpoalātl&quot; &#x27;Place of Twenty Waters&#x27;) is an important Mesoamerican archaeological site located in the municipality of Úrsulo Galván in the Mexican state of Veracruz. The site was inhabited mainly by Totonacs, Chinantecas and Zapotecs. It was one of the most important Totonac settlements during the postclassical Mesoamerican period and the capital of the kingdom of Totonacapan. It is located one kilometer from the shore of the Actopan River and six kilometres from the coast.

Cempoala was the first urban settlement the Spaniards saw upon arrival on the American continent.

According to some sources, the city was founded at least 1,500 years before the Spanish arrival, and there is evidence of Olmec influence. Although not much is known about the Preclassical and Classic Era, the Preclassical town was built on mounds to protect it from floods. The Totonacs moved into the area during the Toltec Empire peak, having been forced out of their settlements on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental. The Totonacs ruled the area of Totonacapan which consisted of the northern part of Veracruz together with the Zacatlán district of Puebla with a total population of approximately 250,000 and some 50 towns. At its peak, Cempoala had a population of between 25,000 and 30,000.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;Cēmpoalli&quot; (from Nahuatl root &quot;Cēmpoal) means twenty and &quot;ā (tl)&quot;, means water, hence &quot;twenty waters&quot;. An alternative etymology suggests the name meant “Abundant Water”. Both versions imply that the city had many aqueducts which fed the numerous gardens and surrounding farmland fields. A third version conjectures that the name referred to commercial activities which, according to some sources, were performed every 20 days in pre-Hispanic times.

==History==
Research by Vincent H. Malmström (Dartmouth College) describes an interesting astronomical relationship between the three round rings found at Cempoala.

The Totonacs moved onto this coastal plain during the height of the Toltec Empire (A.D. 1000–1150). Archaeologists believe the Toltecs had pushed the Totonacs out of their settlements on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental and down to the coast.
Here, on 27 May 1520, a battle was fought between the forces of Pánfilo de Narváez and the forces of Hernán Cortés, the latter which were supported by a small number of indigenous soldiers. See: Battle of Cempoala.

Cempoala lies on the flat coastal plain about six kilometers from the Gulf and a little more than a kilometer from the banks of the Rio Actopan (also called the Rio Chachalacas).

==Alliance==
Cempoala and other coastal Veracruz locations were defeated by the Aztec armies of Moctezuma I (mid-15th century). They were heavily taxed (goods and sacrifice prisoners) and forced them to send hundreds of people as a tribute for sacrifices and as slaves. This 
treatment at the hands of the Aztecs created the situation which led up to the defeat of the Aztecs by Cortés in the 16th century.

When the Spaniards, led by Hernán Cortés, arrived in 1519 the Totonacs had been suffering Aztec domination for several years.

The Spaniards heard of a town on the way named Zempoala while at their malaria-ridden camp of San Juan de Ulua. They marched over and sent word of their arrival, and upon their arrival were met by 20 Zempoalan dignitaries.

In town, they met with &quot;Fat Chief&quot; Xicomecoatl, who fed them and gave them quarters. The Totonac presented Cortés with numerous gifts, including gold jewelry.

Xicomecoatl made many complaints against the Aztec Empire and the great Montezuma.

Cortés promised alleviate his concerns. At Quiahuiztlan, the Spaniards and Totonacs forged their alliance against the Aztecs.

Spaniards and Totonacs shared the same goal. In August 1519, Cortés and 40 Totonac captains, which by a lower estimate equates to around 8000 soldiers, and 400 porters left for Tenochtitlan. The effort ended with the fall of Tenochtitlan and Moctezuma II, the Aztec Tlatoani, as hostage.

==Site==

The Cempoala complex site is an assembly of impressive public spaces and fortress-like buildings surrounded by vegetation. The structures were built with stones from the nearby river, joined with mortar, and covered with lime made from burning shells and snails. This added a silver-like luster to their appearance when viewed from a distance.

As the political-religious center of the city, it included the &quot;Place of accounts&quot;, as it was referred by the Mexica rulers, because it was where taxes and tributes from the region were collected.

Structures with often overlooked historic importance are in the part of the site now known as walled system IV. It was here that Cortés successfully faced the forces of Pánfilo de Narváez, thus consolidating his leadership in the colonization of the Mexican territory.

==Structures==
The main structures at Cempoala, include the following:

*Templo del Sol or Great Pyramid
Or Sun Temple built on the same platform as the Templo Mayor, separated by an ample square. This is probably the most impressive structure on site. The great temple resembles the Sun Temple in Tenochtitlan. The Quetzalcoatl Temple, the Feathered Serpent God is a square platform, and the Ehécatl Temple, the wind God is round.

* Templo Mayor
The top part is surrounded by battlements.

* Templo de las Chimeneas
Or chimney temple, has a series of semicircular pillars 1.5 meters high, because of this peculiar shape, the building is named.

* El Pimiento
It has a three bodied structure, its most notable feature is its exterior decor based on skulls representations.

* Moctezuma&#x27;s Palace
No information

* Templo de la Cruz
Or cross temple, maintains some fresco mural sections with celestial motifs.

* Templo Las Caritas
The so-called Temple of Charity standing about 200 meters to the east is a two-tier structure decorated with fragments of stucco reliefs. It is named for the hundreds of stucco skulls that once adorned the facade of a small structure at the base of the temple&#x27;s staircase-archaeologists believe this complex was dedicated to the god of death.

It consists of two overlaid basements with top side elements, an open room, two decorative belts, the lower has murals depicting the sun, Moon and Venus, as early morning star, the higher section has a large amount of clay “little faces” or little skulls. The Structure is decorated with stucco faces on the walls and hieroglyphs painted in lower sections Gran Pirámide and the wind god Ehécatl worship altar.
* Other Mounds
There are other mounds, unexcavated, that cannot be visited, located within Cempoala current houses. Some of the structures there are probably built in the same style as were the residences of the prehispanic commoners.

==Astronomy in Cempoala==
Some research by Vincent H. Malmström of Dartmouth College describes an interesting astronomical relationship that exists because of the three round rings found at Zempoala. We will quote a part of his discussion concerning the Three Ceremonial Rings of Zempoala.

Beneath the massive pyramid (north eastern corner) in the central plaza of Zempoala, are three puzzling stone rings, each made from rounded beach cobbles jointed together to make small, stepped pillars. The largest rings has 40 stepped pillars, the middle ring has 28, and the smaller ring 13, around its circumference. It seems that three rings were used to calibrate different astronomical cycles, possibly by placing a marker or an idol from one pillar to the next, day after day.

The stone rings viewed from the top of the main pyramid, are surmounted by 13, 28, and 40 step like pillars, might have been counting devices to keep track of eclipse cycles, by Totonac priests.

It is possible that by using the rings, Totonacs priests were able to calibrate movements of the moon. There are reasons to believe these rings provide further evidence of the intellectual curiosity and architectural ingenuity of the early Mesoamericans.&quot;

==History after 1519==
Cempoala was a prosperous city, in which the Spaniards under Hernán Cortés arrived in Mexico and established alliances with some groups to go towards the capture of Tenochtitlan. The city of Cempoala then numbered approximately 20,000 inhabitants was the most important ceremonial and commercial center of the Aztec empire, more so than Tlatelolco. The Spaniards called it in Villa Viciosa, meaning fertile village by the many festivals and vast orchards and gardens available and festive and joyful inhabitants character. It was later known as new Seville for its resemblance, as per the spaniards, with the Iberian town.

Between 1575 and 1577 a smallpox (matlazahuatl) epidemic decimated the population, it is estimated that two million people lost their lives in Mesoamerica. The city was totally abandoned, and the few survivors moved to the city of Xalapa. The city was then lost to history until archeologist Francisco del Paso and Troncoso rediscovered it.

After the victory and conquest, the Cempoala Totonacs soon took their new destiny next to their foreign partners: were re-located and had to leave the city as they were Christianized, banned from practicing their ancient cults and were turned into slaves to work new Spanish sugar cane fields.

Cortés first arrived at Zempoala in 1519 with 500 conquistadores who then made a long trip up into the highlands using the same routes used to haul maize to Tenochtitlan. His was added by the lord of Cempoala, known by his extraordinary corpulence as the &quot;fat Cacique&quot;. The town was settled around walled perimeters delimiting temples and palaces; dating back to the 11th to 16th centuries.

<text>Alton Delmore (December 25, 1908 – June 9, 1964) and Rabon Delmore (December 3, 1916 – December 4, 1952), billed as The Delmore Brothers, were country music pioneer singer-songwriters and musicians who were stars of the Grand Ole Opry in the 1930s. The Delmore Brothers, together with other brother duos such as the Louvin Brothers, the Blue Sky Boys, the Monroe Brothers (Birch Monroe, Charlie Monroe and Bill Monroe), the McGee Brothers, and The Stanley Brothers, had a profound impact on the history of country music and American popular music. The duo performed extensively with old time fiddler Arthur Smith as the Arthur Smith Trio throughout the 1930s.

==Biography==
The brothers were born into poverty in Elkmont, Alabama, United States, as the sons of tenant farmers amid a rich tradition of gospel music and Appalachian folk. Their mother, Mollie Delmore, wrote and sang gospel songs for their church. The Delmores blended gospel-style harmonies with the quicker guitar work of traditional folk music and the blues to help create the still-emerging genre of country. In addition to the regular six-string acoustic guitar, the duo was one of the few to use the rare tenor guitar, a four-string instrument that had primarily been used previously in vaudeville shows.

In 1925, 16-year-old Alton wrote his first song (&quot;Bound for the Shore&quot;), which he co-wrote with his mother. It was published by Athens Music Co.

In 1930, the brothers entered a contest in Athens, Alabama and won first prize after almost being beaten by a comedy act in multiple rounds of tie breakers.

The Brothers did their first recording session for Columbia Records in 1931, recording &quot;Got The Kansas City Blues&quot; and &quot;Alabama Lullaby,&quot; which became their theme song. They signed a contract with Victor&#x27;s budget label Bluebird in 1933 and became regulars on the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;. Within three years, they had become the most popular act on the show. 

In 1934, Arthur Smith (later known as &quot;Fiddlin&#x27; Arthur Smith&quot; to distinguish him from Arthur &quot;Guitar Boogie&quot; Smith) began touring with The Delmore Brothers. The trio recorded together for the next three years and had played together on over 52 sides together under both The Delmore Brothers and The Arthur Smith Trio. Their first session together was in 1935 for Bluebird. Talent scouts were impressed with Arthur&#x27;s playing and recorded his first sides with Alton and Rabon backing him up. During a recording session in 1937 for Bluebird, Alton had a cold forcing him to sing lower which ended up damaging his vocal chords. After this, Alton was not able to sing as high ever again.

Disagreements with Opry management led to the brothers leaving the show in 1938. After leaving the Opry, the brothers moved to WPTF in Raleigh, North Carolina. While they continued to play and record music throughout the 1940s, they never achieved the same level of success they had with the Grand Ole Opry.

In 1941, their song &quot;When It&#x27;s Time for the Whippoorwill to Sing&quot; made the &quot;Billboard&quot; &quot;Hillbilly&quot; top three.

In 1942, the brothers were officially signed to King Records. However, many of the early King Records that predate this signing were released under pen names. &quot;Someday You&#x27;ll Pay,&quot; &quot;Remember I Feel Lonesome, Too,&quot; &quot;Going Back to the Blueridge Mountains,&quot; and &quot;The Last Old Shovel&quot; were released under Alton&#x27;s Pseudonym &quot;Jim Scott&quot;.

While a myth exists stating that all of the King sides were recorded in Cincinnati, this is untrue. The sides were recorded wherever the Delmores were living at the time. The brothers tended to move two to three times a year which meant there were a lot of places that were sites of the recordings. The sides were recorded in Indianapolis, Memphis, Chattanooga, Jackson, Mississippi, Athens, Alabama, Covington, Fort Smith, Del Rio, and Houston.

Their &quot;Freight Train Boogie&quot; (recorded for the King label in 1946) is regarded by some as the first rock and roll record. Their best-known song, &quot;Blues Stay Away From Me&quot; (also on King, 1949), was covered by Johnny Burnette and The Rock and Roll Trio, Gene Vincent and the Blue Caps, The Louvin Brothers, The Browns, Les Paul and Mary Ford, Doc Watson, The Notting Hillbillies, Marshall Chapman, and The Everly Brothers.

Over the course of their careers, the Delmores wrote more than one thousand songs. Some of the most popular were &quot;Brown&#x27;s Ferry Blues,&quot; &quot;Gonna Lay Down My Old Guitar&quot; and &quot;Fifteen Miles from Birmingham.&quot; Their guitar-based recordings were key in establishing the guitar as central in country and, later, rockabilly and rock and roll. A third instrument featured in many of their postwar records is the harmonica of Wayne Raney. 

Rabon died of lung cancer in 1952, a day after his 36th birthday. Following Rabon&#x27;s death, Alton suffered a heart attack, the loss of his father and his daughter Susan, all within a three-year period. He moved back to Huntsville, Alabama. He taught some guitar, did odd jobs, and devoted his creative energies to writing prose. He wrote a series of short stories and his autobiography, &quot;Truth is Stranger than Publicity&quot;, published posthumously in 1977 by the Country Music Foundation.

==Legacy==
The Delmore Brothers were inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in October 1971, as well as the Alabama Music Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001. Their pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.

The Brothers&#x27; later records with electric guitars and boogie beat landed them a spot on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s History of Rock n&#x27; Roll.

Bob Dylan was quoted in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, on November 10, 1985 as saying, &quot;The Delmore Brothers, God, I really loved them! I think they&#x27;ve influenced every harmony I&#x27;ve ever tried to sing.&quot;

The Brothers recorded over 200 sides with major labels as the Delmore Brothers, and many more under pseudonyms such as Alton&#x27;s most famous persona, &quot;Jim Scott&quot;. Alton wrote many songs that were never released.

<doc id="1220392" wikidata="Q1139652" url="?curid=1220392" title="Whitney (album)">
<text>Whitney is the second studio album by American singer Whitney Houston, released on June 1, 1987, by Arista Records as the follow-up to her debut album. &quot;Whitney&quot; is one of the best-selling albums of all time, with sales of over 20 million copies worldwide. The album features five top-10 hits on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, which also became international hits. The album&#x27;s first four singles—&quot;I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)&quot;, &quot;Didn&#x27;t We Almost Have It All&quot;, &quot;So Emotional&quot; and &quot;Where Do Broken Hearts Go&quot;—all peaked at number one on the US Hot 100, making her the first female act to achieve four number-one hits from one album.

Along with three straight number one singles from Houston&#x27;s previous album, this gave the singer an unprecedented seven consecutive number-one hits, surpassing the Beatles and the Bee Gees, who each had six number-one consecutive hits. None of Houston&#x27;s seven consecutive number-one singles were duets, and none were recorded with other major acts. The album &quot;Whitney&quot; also included the top-10 US hit &quot;Love Will Save the Day&quot;.

The album and the first single, &quot;I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)&quot;, were hits worldwide, peaking at number one in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and several countries throughout Europe. It also became a major hit in various other countries in Asia, South America, and Africa. The album was a global success, and it debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 Album Chart on June 27, 1987. This made Houston the first female artist to ever debut at number one in the United States. She additionally became the first solo Black female artist to have a number-one album in the United Kingdom. The album remained at the top for a record 11 consecutive weeks; it also spent 25 weeks at number one on the albums chart, the record for a female artist during the 1980s.

At the 30th Grammy Awards, it received three nominations including Album of the Year, with Houston winning Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female for &quot;I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)&quot;. On October 28, 2020, the album was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America, for sales of over 10 million copies in the United States.

== Production ==
The album had a more pop feel than the first album. Narada Michael Walden, who produced &quot;How Will I Know&quot; on the first album, produced seven of the &quot;Whitney&quot; album&#x27;s eleven tracks, three of which became number ones on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 Singles chart in 1987 and 1988. Kashif, the producer of &quot;You Give Good Love&quot;, contributed &quot;Where You Are&quot;. Michael Masser, who was responsible for several hits from Whitney&#x27;s debut album, contributed number 1 hit single &quot;Didn&#x27;t We Almost Have It All&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Still My Man&quot;. Finally, Jellybean Benitez produced the top ten hit &quot;Love Will Save the Day&quot;.

== Promotion and appearances ==

=== Singles ===
&quot;Whitney&quot; produced a then-record-equalling four number one singles from one album, making it the first album by a female artist, and overall only the second album by a solo artist, to achieve this, behind Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Bad,&quot; which yielded five number ones. The album is one of only seven albums in music history to generate at least four number one Hot 100 hits from the same album. This feat, with the three number ones from her debut album, also gave Houston seven consecutive number one songs; a record for the most consecutive number ones by any musical act. The most consecutive #1&#x27;s title was previously held by both The Beatles and the Bee Gees with six each.

The first single released from the album, &quot;I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)&quot;, made its debut at number 38, her highest debut at the time, on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, the issue dated May 16, 1987, and reached the top position in six weeks later, becoming her fourth number one hit. It also topped the Hot Adult Contemporary chart for three weeks. The single was a massive success globally, becoming one of her signature songs. In the United Kingdom, it entered the UK Singles Chart at number 10 on May 23, 1987, and reached the number one in two weeks later, staying there for two weeks. According to the Official Charts Company, it sold 760,000 copies and became her best-selling single in the country at the point. The single also peaked at number one of the singles charts in Australia for five weeks, Belgium for three weeks, Canada for a week, Germany for five weeks, Italy for one week, the Netherlands for four weeks, New Zealand for four weeks, Norway for seven weeks, Sweden for six weeks, and Switzerland for six weeks. Thanks to its strong sales and airplay across Europe, it went to top position of European Hot 100 Singles chart and remained at the summit for eight weeks. The single was certified Gold by the RIAA on July 28, 1987, for sales of one million more in the United States―the requirement for a Gold single prior to 1989, and re-certified Platinum for the same sales on February 13, 1989. In addition, it was certified Gold in the UK, Canada, and Sweden. The single sold 4.2 million copies worldwide.

The power ballad, &quot;Didn&#x27;t We Almost Have It All&quot;, was released as the album&#x27;s second single in August 1987. It peaked at number one on the Hot 100 chart on September 26, 1987, and stayed on the top for two weeks. It also topped the Hot Adult Contemporary chart for three weeks, becoming her fifth chart-topper. The single peaked at number two in Canada.

The album&#x27;s third and fourth singles, &quot;So Emotional&quot; and &quot;Where Do Broken Hearts Go&quot;, both reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Singles chart in 1988, becoming her sixth and seventh number one hits, respectively. The former became her second number one hit on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance/Club Play chart and was certified Gold for shipments of 500,000 copies by the RIAA on December 6, 1995. The latter peaked at number one &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Adult Contemporary chart for three weeks.

The fifth single to be released off the album, &quot;Love Will Save the Day&quot;, peaked at number nine on the Hot 100 Singles chart. All five singles were top 5 Hot Black Singles hits, though none of them reached number one. &quot;I Know Him So Well&quot; was released as the sixth and final single from the album exclusively in Australia, Germany, Netherlands, and Spain.
Whitney Houston covered the song &quot;For the Love of You&quot;, originally done by the Isley Brothers. Her cover version earned a nomination for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance at the 1988 Grammy Awards

Note
* &quot;I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)&quot; was certified Gold according to old criteria. In 1989, the sales thresholds for singles were reduced to 500,000 for Gold and 1,000,000 for Platinum, reflecting a decrease in sales of singles.

== Critical reception ==
Upon the album&#x27;s debut, the critical reception of &quot;Whitney&quot; was mixed. Most of critics admitted the commercial value of the album, but were critical because its standard pattern followed the predecessor&#x27;s winning formula and the materials failed to reveal Houston&#x27;s individuality. Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized something as formulaic on the album, stating that: &quot;&quot;Whitney&quot; plays everything safe. It uses three of the debut album&#x27;s producers. [...] There are bouncy, tinkly songs aimed at teen-agers, [...] and slow tunes aimed at sentimental adults, as before. Even the album title fits in with an Arista Records custom of separating female singers—&quot;Dionne,&quot; &quot;Aretha,&quot; &quot;Carly&quot;—from their last names.&quot; He was not positive of her vocals on it, commenting &quot;What&#x27;s more unsettling is that in the two years since &quot;Whitney Houston&quot; was released, the singer hasn&#x27;t gotten much more expressive. For too many songs, she takes the patched-together style of the debut album further [...] as if she were singing in a second language.&quot; He added that &quot;For all the passionate avowals of the lyrics, Ms. Houston and her producers keep emotion at bay.&quot;

Vince Aletti from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also gave an unfavorable review, stating &quot;the formula is more rigorously locked in than before, and the range so tightly circumscribed that Houston&#x27;s potential seems to have shrunk rather than expanded&quot; and the record is &quot;smug, repressive and ridiculously safe.&quot; Also, he made some sarcastic comments about the first single, &quot;I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)&quot;, calling it &quot;How Will I spoken at Hollywood&#x27;s blockbuster sequels. Robert Hilburn, in his review for &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, regarded the album as &quot;another commercial blockbuster&quot;, writing that the record is &quot;a series of highly accessible selections that will work on a variety of radio formats.&quot; However, he expressed his considerable disappointment that &quot;Whitney&quot; did precious little to define the singer&#x27;s vision, adding that she had a sensational voice but didn&#x27;t assert much vocal character on it. Dolores Barclay of the Associated Press complimented Houston on her vocal ability: &quot;Whitney Houston has a fine instrument and uses it well. Her voice takes us to places we know and to places we might want to forget and to places we dream about.&quot; But she, like other critics, was critical of the song material on the record, commenting &quot;There is no depth, and not much excitement. Nor does this talented song stylist and Grammy winner take risks and try something just a little daring.&quot; The &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; showed a favorable attitude toward her new album at large, stating &quot;[&quot;Whitney&quot;] is, first and foremost, a product. It has been carefully designed, manufactured and packaged. As such, it&#x27;s easy to be cynical about. But as products go, this is a pretty good one.&quot; They also praised her vocals: &quot;Houston&#x27;s voice sounds good, real good. [...] She&#x27;s firmer, more confident.&quot;

== Legacy and chart performance ==
With the highly anticipated release of her second album &quot;Whitney&quot;, Houston became the first female artist to debut at number one in the history of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart (formerly the &quot;Top Pop Albums&quot; chart). It made her the fourth artist to achieve that feat overall, behind Elton John with &quot;Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy&quot; and &quot;Rock of the Westies&quot;, Stevie Wonder with &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot; and Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band with &quot;Live/1975–85&quot;. On June 27, 1987, the album topped the chart and remained there for eleven consecutive weeks, the longest run among the releases that reached peak position of the year. It also debuted at number fourteen on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart (formerly the &quot;Top Black Albums&quot; chart) and peaked at the number two, staying on the chart for a total of seventy-five weeks. The album was Houston&#x27;s fastest-selling album in the United States at that time, with four million copies shipped within the first three months of its release. In 2020, it was certified Diamond (10× Platinum) in the US, for shipping/ selling over 10 million copies by the Recording Industry Association of America The album re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 the week of February 25, 2012, after Houston&#x27;s death, at number 122. It remained in the chart for 11 more weeks making 86 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 to date. The album has sold nearly 289,000 copies more since its reentry in 2012. It also sold 806,000 units at the BMG Music Club as of February 2003.

In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart on June 13, 1987, and remained there for six weeks. This made it the first number-one album by a solo Black female artist in the UK, as well as the first album to debut at number one in both the US and in the UK. It was 1987&#x27;s third best-.selling album in the UK, behind Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Bad&quot; and U2&#x27;s &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, and was ranked number six on list of &quot;The Best-Selling Albums of the 1980s in UK&quot;. With 1.2 million copies sold there, it would become the biggest selling album by a female artist in the UK, a record that has since been broken. With her debut also selling over a million copies, this would make Houston the first female artist to have two albums sell over a million copies in the UK. With current sales of over 2.2 million, the album was the first album by an African-American woman to sell over 2 million in the United Kingdom.

In Canada, the album topped the albums chart for eleven weeks. It remained at number one in the same weeks as it did in America. It being the third best-selling album in 1987, behind U2&#x27;s &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; and Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot;. In addition, it peaked at number one in Germany for eleven weeks, Italy for five weeks, Norway for eleven weeks, Netherlands for six weeks, Switzerland for eleven weeks, Austria for two weeks, Sweden for four weeks, Australia for three weeks, New Zealand for two weeks, Spain, Finland, Taiwan, and so on. As a result of massive popularity across Europe, the album topped the European Hot 100 Albums chart for eight weeks in 1987. In Japan, with sales of 384,000 copies combined of LP, CD and Compact Cassette, the album became the third best-selling international album of 1987, behind &quot;Top Gun Soundtrack Album&quot; and Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Bad&quot;. In 1988, &quot;Whitney&quot; was certified 6× Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and 7× Platinum for shipments of 700,000 copies of the album by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA), respectively. It was also certified Platinum in Germany, Netherlands and Finland, respectively, 2× Platinum in Switzerland, Austria and Sweden, respectively. In November 2006, &quot;Whitney&quot; was ranked number forty-seven for sales of 2.2 million, making it her biggest-selling album in the UK, on list of &quot;100 Best Selling Albums of All Time in the UK&quot; announced by The Official UK Charts Company. The album has sold over 20 million copies worldwide.

<text>Matt Walker is an American session musician, known for drumming with Filter, The Smashing Pumpkins and Morrissey, as well as being the regular fill-in to Butch Vig from Garbage on three of their tours (2002, 2016, 2019).

==Biography==
Walker began his career in Chicago in the mid-1980s, when he began playing drums for local Chicago bands and then joined Filter in 1994. Matt toured with Filter in support of the album, &quot;Short Bus&quot; until 1996. Filter toured with The Smashing Pumpkins in Europe and when Pumpkins drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was fired after a heroin overdose, Walker was hired to replace Chamberlin. He finished the &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; tour with the band (1996–1997) and all of their dates up until the beginning of the &quot;Adore&quot; tour. Walker also recorded the song &quot;The End Is the Beginning Is the End&quot; with the band on the official &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; movie soundtrack, as well as several tracks on The Smashing Pumpkins &quot;Adore&quot;. He also worked with Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan on the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Ransom&quot; and with Pumpkins guitarist James Iha on Iha&#x27;s solo album &quot;Let It Come Down&quot;.

In 1998, Walker&#x27;s own band, Cupcakes, was signed to DreamWorks Records and subsequently left the Pumpkins to record the Cupcakes album.

Walker was replaced by John Mellencamp&#x27;s drummer, Kenny Aronoff, for the Pumpkins &quot;Adore&quot; tour. Walker did, however, play with the Pumpkins again at their last show before their first break up, on December 2, 2000. He played percussion on an alternate version of the song &quot;Muzzle&quot; and drums on &quot;1979&quot;, while the original drummer Jimmy Chamberlin played acoustic guitar.

Walker has collaborated with many artists including Ashtar Command with former Filter member, Brian Liesegang, and Chris Holmes to which Sinéad O’Connor sang a track .

Matt co-created the band, Impossible Recording Machine with Jim Dinou.

In 2002, Matt filled in for an ailing Butch Vig during Garbage&#x27;s European tour.

In 2003, he release an album under the band, Beautiful Assassins, called Preamp on the label Positron! Records.

In 2005, he played on Garbage&#x27;s album, &quot;Bleed Like Me&quot;, and also recorded and toured with Billy Corgan to promote the solo album, &quot;TheFutureEmbrace&quot;.

Walker has played drums with Morrissey since 2006, appearing on his albums &quot;Years of Refusal&quot;, &quot;Swords&quot;, &quot;World Peace Is None of Your Business&quot;, &quot;Low in High School&quot; and &quot;I Am Not a Dog on a Chain&quot;.

Walker was also a member of the band the MDR (the Most Dangerous Race), which appeared on the 2007 MySpace/SPIN Smashing Pumpkins tribute album performing &quot;Signal to Noise,&quot; an unreleased Smashing Pumpkins song.

He rejoined the Pumpkins on percussion during the Chicago dates of their 20th anniversary tour in November and December 2008.

While on hiatus from Morrissey, Matt writes songs and performs under the name &quot;of1000faces&quot; with various singers and musicians. Under his own name in 2009, Walker co-wrote with Adam Ant and Morrissey/Ant guitarist Boz Boorer, as well as drummed on, the track Marrying The Gunner&#x27;s Daughter, the quasi-title track of Ant&#x27;s 2013 album&quot; Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

Walker performed with the Pumpkins at a benefit concert at the Metro in Chicago, in July 2010 for an encore of &quot;1979.

In 2016, Walker again filled in for Butch Vig during the first leg of Garbage&#x27;s European tour, as well as the entirety of the European leg of their 2019 tour.

== Drum setup ==
In a 2010 interview, Matt stated he uses all Zildjian cymbals. His drum kit varies on the material he is working on but has used a Gretsch USA Custom 6-piece kit.

== Personal life ==
Matt and Charlotte Walker live in a suburb of Chicago with their three children.

<doc id="1220400" wikidata="Q1376632" url="?curid=1220400" title="Povilas Plechavičius">
<text>Povilas Plechavičius (1 February 1890 – 19 December 1973) was a Lithuanian military officer and statesman. His military career began in the Imperial Russian Army as a yunker during World War I. Then, Plechavičius climbed the ranks of the interwar period Lithuanian Army from captain to lieutenant general.

He is best known for his actions during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence when the partisans he led fought against the Soviet invasion of northwest Lithuania, liberated Seda, Mažeikiai and Telšiai, and later forced out the Bermontians. He is also known for organizing the 1926 Lithuanian coup d&#x27;état and creating and leading the Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force during the German occupation of Lithuania.

==Early life==
Povilas Plechavičius was born on 1 February 1890, in the farmstead, in Židikai eldership, Mažeikiai district, to the Lithuanian farmer Ignas Plechavičius. His mother was Lithuanian noblewoman Konstancija Bukontaitė. Povilas Plechavičius was baptized in the Church of the Holy Trinity in Pikeliai. According to a list of languages made by Plechavičius himself, in addition to his native Lithuanian mother tongue, he also knew the Latvian, Russian, Polish and German languages, as well as some English and French. Plechavičius is also known to have spoken Samogitian.

Plechavičius graduated from a gymnasium in Moscow in 1908. Because Plechavičius was proud of his Samogitian background, he was disliked by the Russian teachers and thus suffered because of it. Later, he graduated from the Moscow Commercial Institute in 1911. Plechavičius then graduated from the on May 13, 1914.

==World War I==
During World War I, he fought in the 5th Cavalry Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army against the German Empire, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. During the war, he was wounded. The first time he was wounded was in the fights near Šiauliai. Some sources give the number of his wounds as three, but his biography claims that he was wounded as many as 29 times during the war. In one case, he was unconscious for three days after receiving an injury.

== Russian Revolution in 1917 ==
In October 1917, the Bolshevik coup began and the Russian army fell apart, including in the Caucasus where the Plechavičiai brothers were involved in the campaign against the Ottoman army.

While in southern Russia during the Russian Revolution, Plechavičius also fought against the Bolsheviks. On news of the outbreak of the Lithuanian–Soviet War, both brothers Povilas and Aleksandras left their regiments for Samogitia. The Plechavičiai brothers used this opportunity to return home to Lithuania.

==Lithuanian Wars of Independence==

=== 1918 ===

==== Summer ====
The situation in Lithuania in 1918 was chaotic due to the rampage of robbers as well as the requisitions and robberies by the Imperial German Army units. The robbers were mostly former Russian prisoners of war on their way to Russia, which included Bolsheviks, and local criminals. The robbers frequently engaged in brutality like beating people up, burning their soles, and even skinning live people, thereafter burning them with all their homesteads. A lot of those robbers ran rampant in the vicinity of Seda, Pikeliai, Židikai and Skuodas.

The German Empire had already signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Soviet Russia on March 3, 1918, thus ending the hostilities on the Eastern Front between the Russian and German armies. Germany had also recognized Lithuanian independence on March 23, but negotiations were still ongoing about the form of governance. Regardless, the German soldiers remained in Lithuania, looting and requisitioning from it.

On July 25, 1918, Povilas and Aleksandras returned to their farmstead, from where they had not heard from for a long time while serving in the Russian army. In August, the two brothers organized a (Lithuanian version of May Day) in to celebrate the Act of Independence of Lithuania. It was a mass gathering of the region&#x27;s locals, where patriotic speeches were made, Samogitian pipe orchestras played, people sang patriotic songs and danced. The celebrations were held in a garden. Several local communists disturbed the celebrations by firing shots. Plechavičius chose a couple of men, told them to catch those communists, spank them and let them go, which the men succeeded in doing. The people were calmed down and continued dancing. The May Day had a great significance for the local residents, as it strengthened their patriotism, united them and encouraged them to fight for freedom.

==== Autumn ====
In the autumn of 1918, Povilas Plechavičius went by train to Vilnius, where Council of Lithuania, the provisional government of Lithuania, was already located. Because the Germans still &quot;de facto&quot; occupying the country, the Council of Lithuania could not really do much even if it was functioning. The Council of Lithuania appointed Plechavičius as the Seda County Commander on November 15 and authorized him to organize the militia, military headquarters (), self-defence units and local administration in Samogitia and to strengthen the Lithuanian state there in all ways. After receiving the wide-ranging mandate from the Lithuanian government, Plechavičius started an uncompromising fight against the Bolsheviks, whose foremost enemy he became. On November 23, Plechavičius volunteered to join the Lithuanian army.

In November 1918, encouraged by the Council of Lithuania, self-government structures began to form throughout Lithuania, such as parish, district and county committees, militias, self-defence groups, military volunteers, and soon even town and district military headquarters began to be created. However, most of the government structures were unprotected and most of the militias lacked weapons.

==== Winter ====
The situation was worsened by the Soviet westward offensive of 1918–1919, when the Soviet Red Army was approaching Lithuania. Local Bolsheviks were emboldened by this and began creating Revolutionary committees, also known as Soviets. By the end of 1918, they had formed Soviets in Skuodas, Salantai, Ylakiai, Leckava, Tirkšliai, Viekšniai, Plungė and Židikai. The Bolshevik Soviets tried to consolidate their power through murder, terror and robbery, hoping to subjugate Lithuania to Soviet Russia.

When the Bolsheviks seized control in Seda in late 1918, the two militarily experienced brothers Povilas and Aleksandras, supported by the local population, began to organize a local partisan unit. Plechavičius began organizing the partisans after first receiving weapons from the inhabitants and, later on, also from the German military units in Latvia. Plechavičius taught military drill to the partisans and the militiamen that joined them. They also had basic shooting practice. Their activity centred on Skuodas. Plechavičius was assigned military commander of Skuodas and its surroundings by the Council of Lithuania.

=== 1919 ===
Plechavičius&#x27; organizational talent, awareness of his responsibility and duty, combined with the public support for him and his fighters, soon gave tangible achievements. Together with his brother Aleksandras, Plechavičius succeeded in creating volunteer partisan units. On February 9, the partisans of Skuodas swore an oath and paraded through its streets on February 16, the day of the restoration of Lithuanian independence.

In the first half of 1919, the threat posed by Bolshevism to Lithuania was huge, because the Red Army had invaded up to the line along Mažeikiai, Seda, Telšiai, Šiluva, Kėdainiai, Jonava, Kaišiadorys, Alytus and Merkinė. The Samogitian partisans stopped the Soviet invasions into Samogitia in the areas where there was no German military.

With the help of a German battalion and an artillery battery, the partisans liberated Seda and Mažeikiai by the end of February. The retreating Bolsheviks were being pursued until Kuršėnai, while in the north, they were followed in the direction of Laižuva and Žagarė until the Latvian border. Thus, in February 1919, Plechavičius was appointed the Commandant of Seda.

After reorganizing, the partisan headquarters moved to Seda. The nearby Telšiai received a military headquarters group for the town and its district from Kaunas. The commandant was the officer Bronius Zaleskis. Military headquarters were also established in Mažeikiai. The general situation throughout the war-torn lands was improving. The partisan self-defence squads had roughly 200 soldiers in them, while the local militia had a similar amount as well.

On February 27, the Samogitian partisans and German soldiers combined forces to liberate Luokė from the Bolsheviks. The Samogitian partisans were also involved in defeating the Soviet 30th Rifle Regiment near Tirkšliai and Mažeikiai on March 2.

The word about Plechavičius as a brave and fearless commander of Samogitian soldiers spread throughout the land and led to him being called the &quot;ruler of Samogitia&quot;. Due to Plechavičius&#x27; efforts, order was established throughout the Samogitian region.

On May 31, 1919, Plechavičius married Irena Grinbergaitė (1897–1983) in &#x27;s Catholic church. According to Rapolas Skipitis, she was of Baltic German descent and from Liepāja.

==== Bolshevik assassination attempts ====
Bolsheviks tried assassinating Plechavičius numerous times, but always failed. For example, once Plechavičius was riding a bike near Seda. Someone shot at him and the bullet made a hole in Plechavičius&#x27; hat, but Plechavičius was unscathed. Plechavičius guarded that hat as a souvenir. Another time, in the Ylakiai district, while riding in a carriage from Kivyliai to , someone threw a grenade into his carriage, but Plechavičius grabbed it and threw it away, with the grenade exploding and not harming anyone.

The Bolsheviks tried to murder Plechavičius in his bed while sleeping, by shooting through the wall, but this failed because the assassin missed. The Bolsheviks infiltrated a maid in Plechavičius&#x27; house, who was supposed to kill Plechavičius. Wherever Plechavičius and his partisans went, they encountered resistance, which led them to suspect the maid of being an informant. Feliksas Veitas discovered that the maid was a Bolshevik agent. The maid was arrested, sentenced to death by a court-martial and publicly shot in the middle of the town of Seda, for everyone to see.

After eliminating the danger of Bolshevism in Samogitia, a court case was fabricated against Plechavičius, allegedly for fighting his enemies too brutally. The Social Democrat , a member of the Seimas, supported the accusation in court. When the floor was given to the accused, Plechavičius laconically stated: &quot;Respected Court, if I had not been there at that time or another similar person, you would not be sitting here today.&quot; Plechavičius was acquitted.

In November 1919, Plechavičius was appointed the Commandant of Mažeikiai town and district.

=== 1920 ===

From January 1920, Plechavičius commanded a company and then a battalion of the 5th Infantry Regiment. As an officer in the Lithuanian Army, he participated in the Polish–Lithuanian War in the battle for Seinai, Augustavas and Varėna in late 1920. At the end of 1920, he served in the 1st and 2nd Cavalry Regiments.

== Interwar ==
From May 1921, Plechavičius was the acting commander of the 1st Cavalry Regiment. From March 1922, Plechavičius was the colonel commanding the 1st Cavalry Regiment. His regiment was renamed to the 1st Hussar Regiment in April 1922. In 1924, Plechavičius graduated from the Higher Officers&#x27; Courses in Kaunas, in which he later taught himself. In 1926, Plechavičius graduated from the War College in Prague.

=== 1926 Lithuanian coup d&#x27;état ===
After the Lithuanian parliamentary election in May 1926, the political regime in Lithuania softened and the communist movement became stronger. Convinced that it was necessary to protect Lithuania from a Bolshevik coup, Plechavičius, who was freed from prison, where he was serving a 20-day sentence for a fistfight with another officer, became one of the leaders of the military coup of December 17, 1926. The coup removed the democratically elected government, assumed power and then handed it to Antanas Smetona.

=== Smetona period ===
On January 1, 1927, he was appointed Chief Cavalry Inspector of the Army Headquarters, and at the same time held the position of Chief of the General Staff Board. In July 1927, he was appointed Chief of Cavalry. From August 1927, Plechavičius was the Chief of the General Staff of the Army. He wrote a textbook in 1928 called the (Cavalry service, Divisional Squadron and Mixed Reconnaissance Team). He was given the rank of lieutenant general in 1929. On February 13, 1929, Plechavičius was released to the reserve against his will. He lived as a farmer thereafter.

The Tiškevičiai noble family deeply respected Plechavičius. One of their family members, was a Senior Lieutenant in the 1st Hussar Regiment and also a member of the Lithuanian Riflemen&#x27;s Union.

== World War II ==
After the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, Plechavičius withdrew to Germany in June 1940. He returned to Lithuania in June 1941 after the Operation Barbarossa began, which was the start of the Eastern Front.

=== Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force ===

A Waffen-SS unit was never created in Lithuania due to a mass national boycott in 1943 by the Lithuanian anti-Nazi resistance. After German defeats on the Eastern Front and the Red Army approaching Lithuania, the German occupiers of Lithuania were more willing to accept Lithuanian demands for their own military units compared to before. Following protracted Lithuanian-German talks, Plechavičius agreed to form local Lithuanian military units called the Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force () in February 1944. Seeing the Germans weakening, the Lithuanian anti-Nazi resistance supported the creation of the LTDF because it would be a way to arm Lithuanians for their self-defence. The LTDF was a volunteer military unit led only by Lithuanian officers and was supposed to stay within the borders of Lithuania to defend the country against the Red Army. Plechavičius became commander of the LTDF.

The subject of the LTDF generates controversy between Lithuanian and Polish historians due to their incompatible views on its actions in the Vilnius Region in 1944. While Polish historians claim that the LTDF&#x27;s soldiers terrorized the local Polish-speaking population and fought only against the Polish Home Army (AK), Lithuanian historians point out that the AK also committed atrocities against Lithuanian civilians. In addition, while the Lithuanian side views eastern Lithuania as lands which Lithuanian military units had the right to defend, the Polish side thought it was rightfully their territory.

On Lithuanian Independence Day (February 16, 1944) Plechavičius made a radio appeal to the nation for volunteers. Some 19,500 men responded to the appeal. All Lithuanian political underground organizations supported Plechavičius. This was achieved through constant communication between Lithuanian commanders and resistance leaders. This was enormously successful: more volunteers came forward than was expected. The Germans were very surprised and deeply shocked by the number of volunteers since their own appeals went unheeded.

On March 22, 1944, SS Obergruppenführer and police general Friedrich Jeckeln called for 70–80,000 men for the Wehrmacht as Hiwis. Chief-of-Staff of Army Group North &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Walter Model demanded 15 battalions of men to protect the German military airports. Plechavičius rejected their demand on April 5. General Commissioner of Lithuania Adrian von Renteln demanded workers for Germany proper. Other German officials also voiced their demands. Finally, on April 6, the Germans ordered Plechavičius to mobilize the country. Plechavičius responded that the mobilization could not take place until the formation of the detachment was complete.

After the failed offensive against Polish Home Army due to the pre–emptive Polish surprise attack, Jeckeln ordered the detachment units in Vilnius to revert to his direct authority. All other units of the detachment were to come under the command of the regional German commissars. Furthermore, the detachment was to use the &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; greeting. Some soldiers of the LTDF committed crimes against civilian residents of the Vilnius region in April and May 1944. The most tragic incidents took place on May 4–6, in the villages of Pawłowo, Adamowszczyzna and Sienkowszczyzna, where a number of Lithuanian soldiers killed eleven people. They also beat or arrested many others, and also burned down dozens of farms and entire Adamowszczyzna.

In May 1944, the occupying Germans unsuccessfully tried to force the Lithuanian military units into the SS. The Lithuanian headquarters directed the Lithuanian units in the field to obey only the orders of the Lithuanian officers. It also ordered the LTDF Officers&#x27; School in Marijampolė to send the cadets home. Plechavičius issued a declaration for his men to disband and disappear into the forests with their weapons and uniforms. The majority of these soldiers became part of the underground resistance and formed the core of the armed anti-Soviet resistance in Lithuania for the next eight years. Instead of collaborating with the Germans, the Lithuanian units disbanded and Plechavičius and his staff were arrested by the Germans on May 15. Plechavičius and 52 other officers were deported to the Salaspils concentration camp in Latvia. Then he was taken to Gdańsk, then to Klaipėda. Plechavičius was released but remained under the supervision of the Gestapo. As the Soviet Red Army approached, Plechavičius left for Germany.

==After World War II==
In 1946, the NKVD demanded the extradition of Plechavičius from the British Zone of Occupation and accused him of being a &quot;war criminal&quot;, &quot;former Nazi-collaborator&quot; and leading &quot;the recruitment and deployment of paramilitary units which were involved in numerous actions against Jews and Soviet partisans&quot;. The British Foreign Office dismissed this, stonewalling the Soviet demands, and said that there were &quot;vital intelligence reasons which preclude the possibility of our handing him over to the Russians.&quot;

Although Plechavičius worked with MI6 for some time, he later opted to better work with the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIA helped Plechavičius with his emigration to the United States in 1949, where his sister and mother lived. He was the chairman of the Board of the Lithuanian Military Veterans&#x27; Union &quot;Ramovė&quot; in 1950–1959.

He died in Chicago on December 19, 1973, and was buried at Saint Casimir Catholic Cemetery. He had three children, who were daughter Irena and sons Povilas and Norbertas, and three grandchildren.

Plechavičius had five brothers and six sisters. Two of the sisters died young, two of the brothers, including Aleksandras, died in forced exile in Siberia, while the rest, including Povilas, ended up in the United States.

==Awards==

* Order of Vytis Cross, 5th Class in 1923
* Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas, 2nd Class in 1928

For his accomplishments in the Lithuanian Wars of Independence in defending Lithuania from invaders, Plechavičius was posthumously awarded the highest military Order of Lithuania - the Grand Cross of the Order of the Cross of Vytis - in 2004.

== Commemoration ==
There are many monuments and streets dedicated to Plechavičius across Lithuania. On 13 December 1991, the Automobilistai street in the Eiguliai eldership of Kaunas was renamed in Plechavičius&#x27; honour. Still, in Vilnius, the city councillors from the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania blocked the naming of one of its streets after Plechavičius in 1998. 

In 2001, a room-museum for Povilas Plechavičius was established in the Kaunas Garrison Officers&#x27; Club Building by the Soldiers&#x27; Union of the Lithuanian Territorial Defence Force (LVRKS). On the occasion of March 11, the day of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania in 1990, a bust of Povilas Plechavičius, sculpted by Merūnas Varnauskas, was ceremoniously unveiled there, which was later handed over to the Marijampolė Museum. A new bust of the general was created and donated by former LTDF volunteer sculptor Konstantinas Bogdanas. 

Povilas Plechavičius was awarded of the Grand Cross of the Order of the Cross of Vytis to Plechavičius posthumously by Lithuanian President Rolandas Paksas in 2004. According to the Polish sociologist , this sparked protests among Poles in Lithuania and concern in Poland. However, Waldemar Tomaszewski, the leader of the Electoral Action of Poles, said in 2008 that &quot;I personally look at these things in a Christian way&quot; and that &quot;he [Plechavičius] had many supporters and must be honored.&quot; 

In 2006, a memorial stone for Plechavičius was unveiled in the memorial park created by in . On 15 June 2008, a memorial rock was unveiled at the birthplace of the Plechavičiai family in Bukančiai and as many as 300 people came to the ceremony.

On 4 October 2008, due to the initiative and funds of the LVRKS, a monumental bust of Plechavičius was unveiled in the memorial park of Vytautas the Great War Museum (sculptor Juozas Šlivinskas, architect Kęstutis Linkus). This bust cost 70,000 Lithuanian litas. Among others, the unveiling ceremony of the bust was attended by Minister of National Defence Juozas Olekas and Kaunas Mayor . 

In 2009, the young soldier&#x27;s school in Kaunas was named after General Povilas Plechavičius. In 2012, a square in Panevėžys was named in Plechavičius&#x27; honour. In 2020, 6,600 trees were planted in Kaunas district in memory of Povilas Plechavičius. On August 27, 2022, in Stoties street, Mažeikiai, a memorial plaque, consecrated by priest Donatas Stulpinas of the , was unveiled on the wall of the former commandant&#x27;s office building, where Povilas Plechavičius worked when commanding the local military headquarters.

On 15 August 2023, memorial plaques commemorating Aleksandras and Povilas Plechavičius, consecrated by Remigijus Monstvilas, senior chaplain of the Military Ordinariate of Lithuania, were unveiled in Palanga in the presence of the retired general Arvydas Pocius.

<doc id="1220402" wikidata="Q523608" url="?curid=1220402" title="Hamburg Sea Devils (NFL Europe)">
<text>The Hamburg Sea Devils were an American football team that played in NFL Europe from 2005 to 2007. They played their home games at Hamburg&#x27;s Volksparkstadion (also home to the German association football team Hamburger SV). 

The franchise played its first game on 2 April 2005, losing 24–23 to the Cologne Centurions. The Sea Devils&#x27; first win came in Week 3 of the 2005 season, with a 31–24 home victory over the then-struggling Rhein Fire.

Their initial head coach was Jack Bicknell, previously head coach of the defunct Barcelona Dragons and Scottish Claymores. The Sea Devils had directly replaced the Claymores after the 2004 season.

On 1 April 2006, the Sea Devils recorded their first tie in franchise history. At home, they scored 17 points in the second quarter, against the Berlin Thunder. They had blown their 17-point lead before regulation ended. When no one scored in overtime, the game ended in a draw. This was only the second tie in the NFL Europa history. The previous tie came in the 1992 season between the Rhein Fire and the London Monarchs.

On 29 March 2007, Bicknell resigned, citing health issues as the reason. He was replaced by offensive coordinator Vince Martino.

On 23 June 2007, the Sea Devils won their first World Bowl championship with a 37–28 victory over the defending champion Frankfurt Galaxy. It was also their last, as NFL Europa disbanded almost immediately following the game. As a result, the Sea Devils are the last team to win a WLAF/NFL Europe/NFL Europa game ever.

Previously, Thomas Herrion, an offensive tackle allocated to the team by the San Francisco 49ers, died after a preseason game against the Denver Broncos in August 2005. 

An unrelated team of the same name has played since 2021 in the new European League of Football.

<text>A bridle is a piece of equipment used to direct a horse. As defined in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the &quot;bridle&quot; includes both the that holds a bit that goes in the mouth of a horse, and the reins that are attached to the bit. It provides additional control and communication through rein pressure (Oxford English Dictionary, n.d., para. 1).

Headgear without a bit that uses a noseband to control a horse is called a hackamore, or, in some areas, a bitless bridle. There are many different designs with many different name variations, but all use a noseband that is designed to exert pressure on sensitive areas of the animal&#x27;s face to provide direction and control.

The bridle was devised by Indo-European herders of the Pontic-Caspian steppes to control horses between 3000 BC and 2000 BC.

==Parts==

The bridle consists of the following elements:
* Crownpiece: The crownpiece, headstall (US) or headpiece (UK) goes over the horse&#x27;s head just behind the animal&#x27;s ears, at the poll. It is the main strap that holds the remaining parts of the bridle in place.
* Cheekpieces: On most bridles, two cheekpieces attach to either side of the crownpiece and run down the side of the horse&#x27;s face, along the cheekbone and attach to the bit rings. On some designs, the crownpiece is a longer strap that includes the right cheek and crownpiece as a single unit and only a left side cheekpiece is added.
* Throatlatch: the throatlatch (US) or throatlash (UK) is usually part of the same piece of leather as the crownpiece. It runs from the horse&#x27;s right ear, under the horse&#x27;s throatlatch, and attaches below the left ear. The main purpose of the throatlatch is to prevent the bridle from coming off over the horse&#x27;s head, which can occur if the horse rubs its head on an object, or if the bit is low in the horse&#x27;s mouth and tightened reins raise it up, loosening the cheeks.
* Browband: The crownpiece runs through the browband. The browband runs from just under one ear of the horse, across the forehead, to just under the other ear. It prevents the bridle from sliding behind the poll onto the upper neck, and holds multiple headstalls together when a cavesson or second bit is added, and holds the throatlatch in place on designs where it is a separate strap. In certain sports, such as dressage and saddle seat, decorative browbands are sometimes fashionable.
* Noseband: the noseband encircles the nose of the horse. It is often used to keep the animal&#x27;s mouth closed, or to attach other pieces or equipment, such as martingales. &quot;See also&quot; Noseband.
* Cavesson, also called Caveson or caves[s]on noseband, is a specific type of noseband used on English bridles wherein the noseband is attached to its own headstall, held onto the rest of the bridle by the browband. Because it has a separate headstall (also called sliphead), a cavesson can be adjusted with greater precision; a noseband that is simply attached to the same cheekpieces that hold the bit cannot be raised or lowered. In Saddle seat riding, the cavesson is often brightly colored and matches the browband. Variations on the standard English-style bridle are often named for their style of noseband. For use in polo, a gag bridle usually has a noseband plus a cavesson.
* Frentera, a strap running from the browband to the noseband, primarily seen on bridles of certain South American designs. 
* Fiador, a form of throatlatch, is used with a hackamore.
* Reins: The reins of a bridle attach to the bit, below the attachment for the cheekpieces. The reins are the rider&#x27;s link to the horse, and are seen on every bridle. Reins are often laced, braided, have stops, or are made of rubber or some other tacky material to provide extra grip.
* Bit: The bit goes into the horse&#x27;s mouth, resting on the sensitive interdental space between the horse&#x27;s teeth known as the &quot;bars&quot;.

On a double bridle, where the horse carries two bits (a curb and small snaffle, often called a &quot;bit and bradoon&quot;), a second, smaller headstall, known as a &#x27;bradoon hanger&#x27; or ‘slip head’ is used to attach the bradoon. A second set of reins is attached to the bradoon, and hence the rider carries four reins.

The bridle, depending on style, may also contain some of the following elements:
* Bit guards: Bit guards are optional fittings used on some bits.
* Curb strap or curb chain, used primarily on bridles with a curb bit, a small strap or chain, usually flat, that runs from one side of the bit to the other, and puts pressure on the chin groove when curb reins are tightened.
* Lip strap: a small strap used on a few curb bit designs, attaches between the bit shanks of a curb bit at the halfway point, used to keep the curb chain properly positioned and may prevent the horse from grabbing at the shanks with its lips.
* Bit hobble: basically, a curb strap used on the snaffle bit rings of a western bridle. Provides no leverage, but because open-faced bridles have no cavesson to prevent the horse from gaping its mouth open, it prevents the bit rings from being pulled through the mouth if strong pressure is applied.
* Shank hobble: A strap, bar or chain that connects the shanks of a curb bit at the bottom of the bit. Serves to stabilize the bit, prevent a lasso or other object from being caught on the shanks.
* Winkers or blinkers, also called &quot;blinders&quot;, are partial eye blocks used primarily on driving horses and some race horses that prevent the animal from seeing what is behind it.
* Overcheck, also called a bearing rein or &quot;check rein&quot;, is a specialty rein that runs from a snaffle bit, past the crownpiece, along the crest of the neck, and attaches to the front of a harness on a driving horse. It prevents the horse from dropping its head too low. Overchecks are also sometimes used on riding horses, especially ponies, to keep them from grazing while being ridden by a small child who may lack the physical strength or skill to raise the animal&#x27;s head up.
*Ornaments such as phalerae and sallongs.

==Types==

===&quot;English&quot; styles===

* Snaffle bridle: the &quot;English-type&quot; snaffle bridle is most commonly seen in English riding. It is a basic bridle that carries one bit and usually has one set of reins. Despite the name, a snaffle bridle may be used not only with a snaffle bit, but also with almost any other types of single rein bits, including Kimblewicks (US: Kimberwick), gag bits, and single curb bits. The English bridle is almost always used with some type of cavesson noseband.
*Pelham bridle: The Pelham is another English type bridle that carries a single bit, in this case a Pelham bit, but two sets of reins, one for snaffle action and one for curb action.
* Double bridle: Also called a &quot;Weymouth&quot; bridle, a double bridle uses two bits at once: a small snaffle called a &quot;bradoon&quot; and a curb or &quot;Weymouth&quot; bit. It requires the use of two sets of reins. Double bridles are usually only seen used in upper level dressage, in saddle seat riding, and for showing in certain other events that require formal attire and equipment.

===Stock horse and working styles===

* Western bridle: used for American-style western riding, this bridle usually does not have a noseband. Many western bridles also lack browbands, sometimes replaced by a &quot;one ear&quot; (variations called &quot;split ear&quot;, &quot;shaped ear&quot;, and &quot;slip ear&quot;) design where a small strap encircles one or both ears to provide extra security to keep the bridle on. Some horse show styles do not have a throatlatch, most working styles do.
* Barcoo bridle – an Australian stock horse bridle that usually does not have a noseband and is used at work and in competition. The crownpiece, browband and throatlatch are all sewn onto a ring near the horse&#x27;s ears on each side of the head. The cheek strap is single strap that loops through the bit and through the ring to a buckle on the outside of the cheek. Thus the cheek strap is doubled. Variations of this bridle include an &quot;extended head&quot; with the throatlatch further back than usual to prevent horses rubbing the bridle off. Other variations include a noseband and these styles may be used as a headcollar. A lighter variety used for racing has cheek strap billets sewn to the ring, and the attached cheek straps are similar to those of an English bridle. Most bits can be used with these bridles with various snaffles the most commonly used.

===Specialty styles===

* Gag bridle: a bridle with rounded cheekpieces that pass through the top and bottom holes in the bit ring of a gag bit and attach directly to the reins. Tension on the reins rotates the bit and slides it up the cheekpieces and into the corners of the lips. In some styles, the bit is sewn into the bridle and slides, but is not interchangeable, other styles have detachable cheekpieces that allow bits to be changed. Gag bridles have the potential for severe action. They are often seen in polo, rodeo speed events, and occasionally show jumping. They are not permitted in most other horse show competition. In polo, they are often used with double reins, in the same manner as a Pelham bridle.
* Halter bridle, also known as a &quot;trail bridle&quot; or &quot;endurance&quot; bridle, this design is a halter with additional quick release cheekpieces that hold a bit and reins. They are an alternative to using a bitted bridle over the top of a halter. During rest stops, instead of removing the bridle, the rider only needs to remove the bit and reins. Variations of this bridle are used by the Australian Light Horse, the Household Cavalry, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and some other mounted police units.

==Hackamores and bitless bridles==

A hackamore, put simply, is headgear that controls a horse via pressure points on the face, usually with a nosepiece instead of a bit. A hackamore is not the same thing as a halter, as a halter is primarily used for leading and tying up an animal. Bitless bridles are similar to hackamores, but some designs use different leverage principles for control. Hackamores and bitless bridles use a headstall with reins attached to some type of noseband or nosepiece. Various designs allow control and good communication to the horse and may, in some cases, be more comfortable to the horse, particularly a young animal or one with a mouth injury.

The &quot;jaquima&quot; or original &quot;bosal&quot; style hackamore is mostly seen on young horses being started under saddle in western riding disciplines. Bitless bridles and other types of hackamore are most often seen on horses used for endurance riding and trail riding. A design called the mechanical hackamore is sometimes seen at rodeos. Most horse show events do not allow bitless bridles of any kind. The exceptions are show jumping, where equipment rules are fairly generous, and in certain western horse show classes for &quot;junior&quot; horses, which permit use of bosal hackamore.

Besides the bosal hackamore, there are many other designs. A design that combines elements of the bosal hackamore is known as a &quot;sidepull,&quot; which acts mostly on the nose, and are popular with western riders and many trail riders. English riders sometimes use a &quot;jumping cavesson&quot; or &quot;jumping hackamore&quot; that is basically a leather sidepull noseband reinforced internally with a cable, with rein rings attached. The so-called &quot;mechanical hackamore&quot; or &quot;hackamore bit&quot; is basically a hybrid bridle/hackamore made up of a noseband with shanks and a curb strap or chain that can put considerable leverage on the jaw and poll.

Another design, called a bitless bridle is the &quot;cross-under&quot; or &quot;figure eight&quot; bridle. One common design connects the reins to a loop that passes from the noseband, under the jaw, and up around the poll, returning on the opposite side back under the jaw to the noseband and out to the other rein. This design directs pressure from one rein to the opposite side of the horse&#x27;s head, or pressure on both reins to the whole head. Other designs only cross under the jaw and do not go over the poll.

Some riders, not realizing that a horse&#x27;s head overall is a very sensitive area, use a noseband-based style of headgear without the same caution they might use with a bit, thus defeating any benefit that an apparently milder form of gear would otherwise provide. While many bitless designs are marketed as humane, and some are indeed quite mild, other designs can be remarkably harsh in the hands of a poor rider, particularly if they are improperly adjusted or have metal parts, a thin design, or rough surfaces.

==Harness bridles==
Bridles used for driving horses have some differences from most riding bridles. The most visible difference is that they usually include partial eye coverings called &quot;blinders, blinkers&quot; or &quot;winkers&quot; that restrict the horse&#x27;s peripheral vision. They are stitched into the cheekpieces of a driving bridle and sometimes bear a monogram or badge. Winkers may be square, dee-shaped, hatchet-shaped, or round, and are adjusted to fit clear of the center of the horse&#x27;s eye.

The noseband is fitted into the bridle so has a certain amount of action, and is not on a separate headstall (also called sliphead) as is a cavesson. Harness bridles may feature a fancy browband, rosettes, and other ornamentation. An overcheck or bearing reins are sometimes used to control a horse&#x27;s head carriage and may be used in conjunction with an overcheck bit.

The Liverpool curb bit is most commonly used for carriage driving. The reins can be attached in any of the three slots along the shanks, resulting in a snaffle or curb action as required. &quot;Wilson snaffle&quot; bits are commonly used with trade turnouts. These bits have four rings so that the inner two rings may be attached to the cheek pieces and the outer pair to the reins. This arrangement is designed to prevent rein pressure interfering with the position of the winkers. Other styles of bits are used for harness racing, fine harness, and coach driving.

==Fitting a bridle==

A bridle is individually fitted to a horse. Without properly fitting the bridle to the horses’ head, the horse may be uncomfortable, and poor fitting may also result in lack of control while riding or unclear communication. 
The length of each piece of the bridle needs to be individually adjusted to fit the horse&#x27;s head. Other parts of the bridle are adjustable in length, though there are limits to adjustment and thus many manufacturers offer two to six different basic sizes. The sizes may have different names, but in the US and Canada they are often called &quot;cob&quot; and &quot;horse&quot; for small and large animals, sometimes with &quot;pony&quot;, &quot;mini&quot;, &quot;warmblood&quot; and &quot;draft&quot; sizes in some designs.

The bit and browband are of set lengths and must be selected in the correct size. A too-narrow bit is uncomfortable and cannot be widened. One that is slightly too wide can be narrowed to some extent by adding a pair of bit guards. A browband that is too short causes the browband or crownpiece to rub the ears. The cheekpieces are adjusted not only so that the bit avoids the extremes of pulling the corners of the horse&#x27;s mouth or banging the horse&#x27;s incisors, but also so it hangs properly in the mouth for the specific riding discipline and bit design involved . The adjustment of the noseband depends on the type used, but needs to be snug enough to be effective, yet loose enough to avoid discomfort. The throatlatch is adjusted each time the bridle is put on the horse, loose enough to not interfere as the horse flexes at the poll. A standard throatlatch measurement is that the width of three or four fingers should be able to fit between the throatlatch and the horses’ cheek.

==Dangers of tying with a bridle==
It is unsafe to tie a horse using a bridle for two main, seemingly contradictory, reasons. First, if the tied animal pulls back on the bridle, the bit or controlling noseband (such as a bosal or mechanical hackamore) may cause considerable pain or even injury to the mouth, tongue, or other facial structures of the animal even if the bridle breaks. Second, compared to halters, most bridles are made of thin leather which will easily break under pressure. The end result can be both injury to the horse and broken equipment. Should a rider need to tie a horse, best practice is to either remove the bridle and put on a halter, or to put a halter on in addition to the bridle (under or over the bridle), and tie the horse using the halter only. In addition, tying with a slipknot that can be released by pulling on the end of the lead rope is a key safety tactic.

In western riding, some horses are taught to &quot;ground tie&quot; with a bridle, that is, to stand still when the reins are dropped on the ground. This can only be done with split reins, as a horse can easily put a foot through a pair of reins that are attached to one another. Even with split reins, a horse can still step on a rein, jerk its head up and both break the rein and injure its mouth. Historically, it was a useful skill if a rider had to momentarily dismount and perform a task that required both hands (such as removing brush or fixing a fence) in a remote area where tying was impracticable. In actual practice, just as with the &quot;stay&quot; command used in obedience work for dogs, even well-trained horses may not stay &quot;ground tied&quot; for long, especially if left unsupervised. Thus, ground tying today is usually seen in specific classes at horse shows such as the trail horse class, or as a useful short-term command: many horses are taught to stand still for a limited period of time on a &quot;whoa&quot; or &quot;stay&quot; command, with or without dropping the reins.

<text>Aubrey Cosens VC (21 May 1921 – 26 February 1945) was a Canadian soldier and posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military service==
Aubrey Cosens was born in Latchford, Ontario on May 21, 1921, the only son to Mr. and Mrs. Charles Cosens. Shortly afterwards his family moved near Porquis Junction and this is where Cosens remained until he left school at 17 and went to work as a section hand on the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway.

A year after taking this job, the Second World War broke out and Aubrey attempted to
join the RCAF and was rejected for being too young.

In 1940 he joined The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada as private and later transferred to The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada as a Corporal. He was promoted to sergeant while serving as part of the D-day reinforcements in Normandy, France.

He was 23 years old and a sergeant in The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada during his involvement as a Canadian Army soldier in the Second World War.

On the night of 25–26 February 1945 at Mooshof near Uedem, Germany, B and D Coys of The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada led a series of attacks on German strongholds. During the battle his Platoon Commander was killed-in-action and the platoon took heavy casualties. Sergeant Cosens assumed command of the four survivors of his platoon whom he placed in position to give him covering fire. Running forward alone to a tank, he took up an exposed position in front of the turret and directed its fire. When a further counter-attack had been repulsed, he ordered the tank to ram some farm buildings into which the Germans attackers had retreated. He went in alone, killing 22 of the defenders and taking the rest prisoners. He then dealt similarly with the occupants of two more buildings, but was shot by a sniper when he went to report back to superior officers.

==Legacy==
Aubrey Cosens was mentioned in Robert Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, albeit misspelled.

<text>Claud Charles Castleton, VC (12 April 1893 – 29 July 1916) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Claud Castleton was born in Kirkley, Lowestoft, England. Educated at a council school, he won a scholarship to the grammar school. In 1912 he set off on a long adventure, stopping first at Melbourne, Australia. He worked in various parts of Australia before heading to New Guinea, intending to earn funds for the return journey to England via New Zealand, India and Africa. Matters changed with the outbreak of the First World War; he joined the Australian force formed in New Guinea for the defence of the area in the face of German warship activities.

In March 1915 Castleton returned to Sydney and enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. He subsequently served at Gallipoli, where he earned promotion. He later transferred to the Australian Machine Gun Corps. He was 23 years old, and a sergeant in the 5th Machine Gun Company, 5th Brigade, 2nd Division when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

Castleton is buried at Pozières British Military Cemetery, Somme, France, 3 miles NE of Albert (Plot IV, Row L, Grave 43). The inscription on his gravestone reads: .

==Legacy==
Castleton&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. Castleton Crescent in the Canberra suburb of Gowrie was named in his honour. There is a brass plaque to him at the former South Cliff Congregational Church, now St Nicholas&#x27;s Catholic Church, in south Lowestoft.

<text>The Benko Gambit (or Volga Gambit) is a chess opening characterised by the move 3...b5 in the Benoni Defence arising after:
:1. 
:2. 
:3. 

Black sacrifices a pawn for enduring pressure. White can accept or decline the gambit pawn. 
== Origin and predecessors ==
The idea of sacrificing a pawn with ...b5 and ...a6 is quite old. Karel Opočenský applied the idea against, among others, Gideon Ståhlberg at Poděbrady 1936, Paul Keres at Pärnu 1937, Erich Eliskases at Prague 1937, and Theo van Scheltinga at the Buenos Aires Chess Olympiad 1939. Later, the game Mark Taimanov–David Bronstein at the Candidates Tournament, Zürich 1953, drew attention. Most of these games began as a King&#x27;s Indian, with Black only later playing ...c5 and ...b5. Possibly the first game using the now-standard 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5 was Thorvaldsson–Vaitonis, Munich Olympiad 1936.

In many countries, particularly in Eastern Europe, the opening is known as the Volga Gambit (). This name is derived from the Volga River after an article about 3...b5 by B. Argunow written in Kuibyshev (Samara since 1991), Russia, that was published in the second 1946 issue of the magazine &quot;Shakhmaty v SSSR&quot;.

Beginning in the late 1960s, this opening idea was also promoted by Hungarian-American grandmaster Pal Benko, who provided many new suggestions and published his book &quot;The Benko Gambit&quot; in 1974. The name &quot;Benko Gambit&quot; stuck and is particularly used in English-speaking countries.

In his 1974 book, Benko drew a distinction between the Benko Gambit and the Volga Gambit: &quot;Volga Gambit&quot; referred to the move 3...b5 (sometimes followed by an early ...e6), while the &quot;Benko Gambit&quot; consisted of the moves 3...b5 4.cxb5 a6, now considered the main line. Today the names are synonymous and are used interchangeably or combined as &quot;Volga-Benko Gambit&quot;.

== Benko Gambit Accepted ==
The main line continues 4.cxb5 a6 5.bxa6 Bxa6 followed by Black fianchettoing the f8-bishop. (Black players leery of the double-fianchetto system, where White plays g3 and b3 and fianchettos both bishops, have preferred 5...g6 intending 6.b3 Bg7 7.Bb2 Nxa6! The point is that it is awkward for White to meet the threat of ...Nb4, hitting d5 and a2, when Nc3 may often be met by ...Nfxd5 because of the latent pin down the . Another idea is 5...e6; after 6.Nc3 exd5 7.Nxd5 Be7 8.Nxe7 Qxe7 9.e3 0-0 10.Nf3 the move 10...Rxa6 is a strong exchange sacrifice giving Black enough compensation.) Black&#x27;s compensation for the pawn takes several forms. First, White, who is already behind in , must solve the problem of developing the f1-bishop. After 6.Nc3 d6, if White plays 7.e4, then Black will respond 7...Bxf1, and after recapturing with the king, White must spend time castling artificially with g3 and Kg2, as in the line 7...Bxf1 8.Kxf1 g6 9.g3 Bg7 10.Kg2. If White avoids this by fianchettoing the bishop, it will be in a rather passive position, being blocked by White&#x27;s own pawn on d5.

Apart from this, Black also obtains fast development, good control of the a1–h8 diagonal, and can exert pressure down the half-open a- and b-files whereby White&#x27;s a- and b-pawns can become vulnerable. These benefits can last well into the endgame and so, unusually for a gambit, Black does not generally mind if queens are exchanged; indeed, exchanging queens can often remove the sting from a attack by White. Also in the endgame, the black king can become active and reach the via the h8–a1 diagonal.

== Benko Gambit Declined ==
There are various alternatives that avoid some of the problems entailed in the main line. The simplest is to just decline the gambit with 4.Nf3. Other possible moves are 4.Nd2, 4.a4, 4.e3, and 4.Qc2. Another option, popular at the grandmaster level as of 2004 and considered safer for Black, is to accept the pawn with 4.cxb5 but then immediately return it with 4...a6 5.b6.

=== Sosonko Variation ===
After 4.a4, the Sosonko Variation, Black has three replies. The most popular line is 4...bxc4, the Sosonko Accepted, which often leads to and sacrificial lines for both sides. Such lines include the Poisoned Knight Variation where after 5.Nc3 e6 6.e4 exd5 and 7.e5, Black sacrifices a knight for a large central pawn majority and excellent advantage with good attacking chances; and the River Styx Attack, which continues 5.Nc3 Ba6 6.e4 d6 7.f4 g6 8.e5. This leads to a sharp and complicated pawn sacrifice by White, where White often delays or even prevents Black from castling, and has a solid grip over the kingside with the e6-pawn and Nf7 outpost combination. This line is named after the Greek mythological river that interconnects the Earth and the Underworld. These lines are diverse and complicated and are not well explored.

Other less common lines include 4...b4, the Advance Variation, leading to games with pseudo-Benoni structures; and the rare 4...Qa5+ which often transposes into an altered Advance Variation with White playing 5.Bd2 and Black responding 5...b4.

== Use ==
The gambit&#x27;s most notable practitioner was its eponym, Pal Benko. Many of the world&#x27;s strongest players have used it at one time or another, including former world champions Viswanathan Anand, Garry Kasparov, Veselin Topalov, Mikhail Tal, and Magnus Carlsen; and grandmasters Vasyl Ivanchuk, Michael Adams, Alexei Shirov, Boris Gelfand, and Evgeny Bareev. It is a popular opening at amateur level, where it is considered to offer Black good practical chances of playing for a win.

== &quot;ECO&quot; ==
The &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; has three codes for the Benko Gambit:
* A57 3...b5
* A58 3...b5 4.cxb5 a6 5.bxa6
* A59 3...b5 4.cxb5 a6 5.bxa6 Bxa6 6.Nc3 d6 7.e4

<doc id="1220426" wikidata="Q3375187" url="?curid=1220426" title="Percy Cherry">
<text>Percy Herbert Cherry, VC, MC (4 June 1895 – 27 March 1917) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. The award was granted posthumously for Cherry&#x27;s actions during an attack on the French village of Lagnicourt which was strongly defended by German forces.

Born in the Australian state of Victoria, Cherry moved to Tasmania at the age of seven when his family took up an apple orchard. Becoming an expert apple packer, he was also a skilled rifle shot and member of the Franklin rowing club. In 1913, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 93rd Infantry Regiment, Citizens Military Force, and served as a drill instructor at the outbreak of war. Enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in March 1915, he served at Gallipoli before transferring to the Western Front and fighting in the Battle of the Somme. In early March 1917 during the Battle of Arras, Cherry was decorated with the Military Cross following an attack on Malt Trench, in which he led a party in capturing two German machine gun posts. He was killed by a German shell the day following his Victoria Cross action.

==Early life==
Cherry was born on 4 June 1895 at Drysdale, Victoria, to John Gawley Cherry and his wife Elizabeth, née Russel. When he was seven years old, the family moved to Tasmania and took up an apple orchard near Cradoc. Cherry attended the local state school until he was thirteen, after which he received private tuition. He worked with his father and became an expert apple packer; at fourteen he won a local case-making competition at the Launceston Fruit Show by packing thirty-five cases of apples in an hour. Joining the Australian Army Cadets in 1908, Cherry soon became a sergeant and later a second lieutenant, where he used to drill cadets in four different districts. At the age of sixteen, he won the President&#x27;s Trophy and Gold Medal for being the best shot at the rifle range in Franklin. He also rowed with the Franklin rowing club, played the cornet in the Franklin brass band and sang in the Anglican church choir. In 1913, Cherry joined the Citizens Military Force and was commissioned into the 93rd Infantry Regiment as a second lieutenant.

==First World War==
===Enlistment, March 1915 to Western Front, March 1917===
At the outbreak of war, Cherry was sent to Claremont Camp and assumed duties as a drill instructor. On 5 March 1915, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and was allotted to the 26th Battalion, where he qualified as an infantry officer, but was considered too young for a commission in the Australian Imperial Force and was instead made a Quartermaster Sergeant. On 29 June, the battalion embarked from Brisbane for Egypt with Cherry aboard HMAT &quot;Aeneas&quot;. On arrival, the battalion spent several months training in the desert, where Cherry was promoted to company sergeant major in August. On 12 September, the battalion landed at Gallipoli and played a defensive role at Courtney’s and Steele’s Posts, and Russell’s Top.

On 1 December, injured by bomb wounds to his face and head, Cherry was evacuated to Egypt, where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 9 December. Three days later, the 26th Battalion was withdrawn from Gallipoli and evacuated to Egypt where Cherry rejoined them in preparation for service on the Western Front. Remaining in Egypt during this time, Cherry was selected to attend a machine gun course in March 1916. After completion of this, he was transferred to the 7th Machine Gun Company in France.

He commanded the company&#x27;s 1st Battery at Fleurbaix, Messines and on the Somme until 5 August, when he was wounded in a duel with a German officer at Pozières. He and a German officer—who was leading an attack against Cherry&#x27;s position—were exchanging shots from neighbouring shell-holes. Eventually, they both rose, firing simultaneously. The German officer hit Cherry in the neck but was mortally wounded by Cherry in return. Cherry approached the dying man, who pulled a package of letters from his pocket, and asked Cherry to have them censored and posted. Cherry promised to do so and the German handed over the letters, with the words; &quot;And so it ends&quot;. He died shortly afterwards. As a result of his wounds, Cherry was evacuated to England for treatment.

Promoted to lieutenant on 25 August 1916, Cherry returned to his unit on the Somme in November. The following month he was made a temporary captain and transferred back to the 26th Battalion as the commanding officer of C Company. His rank was confirmed on 14 February 1917, and on 1–2 March he was involved in the battalion&#x27;s actions around the village of Warlencourt. At 03:00 on 2 March, Cherry led his company in an attack on the German held position of Malt Trench, situated between the villages of Warlencourt and Bapaume. Artillery fire had failed to adequately cut the barbed wire lines for the advancing troops, and Cherry led a section of men along the wire until he found a break in it. Once through the gap, he rushed two machine gun posts, capturing one single-handed, and turned one on the fleeing Germans before being wounded himself. For his actions during the engagement, Cherry was awarded the Military Cross, the notification of which was published in a supplement of the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 26 April 1917.

===Victoria Cross===
On 26 March 1917, the 7th Brigade—of which the 26th Battalion was part—was tasked with the capture of Lagnicourt as part of the Battle of Arras. It was during this engagement where Cherry was to earn the Victoria Cross. An artillery barrage opened up on the village at 05:15 and continued for twenty minutes, allowing the infantry to close in. The plan was that Cherry&#x27;s company would storm the village itself while the battalion&#x27;s other companies encircled it. For the assault, Cherry split his company into two sections; he commanded one section himself and placed the other under Lieutenant William Frederick Joseph Hamilton.

The company was soon in action. Cherry&#x27;s section captured a large fortified farm on the edge of the village. As they entered the muddy main street, the Australians came under heavy fire from the houses lining the road and from an adjacent stable yard. Cherry &quot;rushed the stable yard&quot; and a fierce firefight developed, before the Germans surrendered. As Cherry and his men moved through Lagnicourt, they found the main resistance coming from a large chalky crater, &quot;spotted with white chalk&quot;, at the crossroads in the village centre. The Germans&#x27; stout defence was holding up the advance and Cherry sent a messenger back for more Stokes mortars. Becoming impatient at the delay, Cherry decided to rush the position under the cover of Lewis Gun and rifle grenade fire. Capturing the crater, he found Lieutenant Harold Hereward Bieske at the bottom wounded. Bieske had taken over command of the second section when Lieutenant Hamilton was wounded, and it had now been reduced to six men.

After capturing the crater, Cherry pushed on through the village, where his party emerged from among the buildings on the far side. Another stiff fight ensured with a group of Germans in dug-outs by the side of the road, before the company was able to meet up with its fellow units which had bypassed the village and were already established to the north and east of the area. Cherry&#x27;s orders were to fall back into reserve, but he disregarded them as he sensed a counter-attack was forthcoming. At 09:00 on 27 March, the Germans launched a very strong counter-attack under heavy artillery fire. At one point, Cherry noticed that the Germans were firing yellow flares to pinpoint Australian positions to their gunners. He found some of these flares, and fired them away from his position. The German attempts to retake Lagnicourt—at a cost to the 7th Brigade of 377 casualties—raged all day before they abandoned the counterattack.

===Death and legacy===
In the afternoon of 27 March 1917, a shell burst in a sunken road to the east of Lagnicourt, killing Cherry and several other men. He was buried in Quéant Road Cemetery, Buissy, Plot VIII, Row C, Grave 10. The full citation for Cherry&#x27;s posthumous award of the Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 11 May 1917, reading:

Cherry&#x27;s Victoria Cross was presented to his father by the Governor of Tasmania, Sir Francis Newdegate, in Hobart during October 1917. In 1932, a photograph of Cherry was unveiled at the headquarters of the 26th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force, at Annerley, Brisbane. His Victoria Cross is currently on display at the Australian War Memorial along with his other medals.

<text>Charles T. Birt (born May 27, 1942 in Winnipeg, Manitoba) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1984 to 1988, representing the riding of Fort Garry for the Progressive Conservative Party.

Birt grew up in East Kildonan, was educated at Miles Macdonell Collegiate and at the University of Manitoba, and worked as a lawyer before entering political life. From 1980 to 1984, he was a member of the Winnipeg City Council. He also was a member of the Children&#x27;s Aid Board of Winnipeg from 1980 to 1983, and served as a trustee for Victoria Hospital from 1980 to 1984.

He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by-election held on October 2, 1984, following the resignation of Bud Sherman in Fort Garry. He was elected by more than 1,500 votes over his nearest opponent, Liberal leader Sharon Carstairs; Progressive Party leader Sidney Green placed fourth. Birt was re-elected over Nora Losey of the governing New Democratic Party in the 1986 provincial election.

Birt was defeated by Liberal candidate Laurie Evans in the 1988 election, ironically as the Progressive Conservatives formed a minority government. He has not sought a return to provincial politics since this time.

Birt remained active in the Winnipeg community since his defeat. Along with former Mayor Bill Norrie, he has recently been involved in a project to restore the Elmwood Cemetery.

<text>John Collins VC, DCM (10 September 1880 – 3 September 1951) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in West Hatch, Somerset, his family moved to Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, when he was 10 years old.

He enlisted in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1895 and served in South Africa during the Boer War and was one of the first troops to enter Ladysmith with the relief column. He also saw service in India. Although his war records were destroyed during the London Blitz of 1940, it is likely that he left the Army in 1907, when he worked as a collier at the Bedlinog Colliery.

He enlisted in the newly formed Welsh Horse Yeomanry in 1915 and the regiment was sent to Gallipoli (it had been converted to an infantry regiment) and carried out mining and sapping duties in the area around Hill 60. They were evacuated to Egypt as part of the last British troops to leave the peninsula. The Welsh Horse provided part of the garrison in the Libyan desert until January 1917, when they were merged with the 1/1 Montgomeryshire Yeomanry and then formed the 25th Battalion, The Royal Welch Fusiliers, British Army. During the last week of October, the 25 RWF were positioned on the right of the 74 Division, in the centre of the line where, along with 24 RWF they were to be the brigade&#x27;s two attacking battalions. At this time, Collins was 37 years old, and an acting corporal when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 31 October 1917, during the Battle of Beersheba at Wadi Saba, Beersheba, Palestine, when, after deployment, prior to an attack, his battalion was forced to lie out in the open under heavy shell and machine-gun fire which caused many casualties. Corporal Collins repeatedly went out under heavy fire and brought back many wounded to cover, thus saving many lives. In subsequent operations throughout the day, he was conspicuous in rallying and leading his command. He led the final assault with the utmost skill in spite of heavy fire at close range and uncut wire. He bayoneted 15 of the enemy and with a Lewis gun section, pressed on beyond the objective and covered the reorganization and consolidation most effectively although isolated and under fire from snipers and guns.

He later achieved the rank of sergeant and was discharged in 1919.

He was decorated with the Victoria Cross by HM King George V at Buckingham Palace on 1 June 1918. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum, Caernarfon Castle, Gwynedd, Wales, where there is a plaque in the entrance to his memory. A painting of Collins by G Ethridge is on display at Cyfarthfa Castle Museum &amp; Art Gallery.

<text>Colonel William George Cubitt, (19 October 1835 – 25 January 1903) was a senior officer in the British Indian Army and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==
Cubitt was born in Calcutta, the son of Major W. Cubitt, an Indian Army officer. After an education in England, Cubitt entered the Indian Army as an ensign in the 13th Bengal Native Infantry, Bengal Army, on 26 July 1853. He first saw active service in the Santhal campaign of 1855.

Cubitt was 21 years old, and a lieutenant in the 13th Bengal Native Infantry when, during the Indian Mutiny, the following deed took place at the siege of Lucknow, for which he was awarded the VC.
After the Indian Mutiny, Cubitt continued to serve with the Indian Army. In 1875 he took part in the Duffla Expedition, for which he was mentioned in despatches, and in 1880 was with the Khyber line force during the Second Anglo-Afghan War. Promoted colonel in July 1883, he served with the Akha Expedition in 1883–84, and in the Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1886–87, during which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). At the time of his retirement in 1892 he was in command of the 43rd Gurkhas (later the 8th Gurkha Rifles).

His medals, including the VC, are on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

==Personal life==
In 1863 Cubitt married Charlotte Isabella Hills, daughter of James Hills, of Nischindipore, Bengal, and sister of Lieutenant-General Sir James Hills-Johnes VC. They had three sons and two daughters.

On retirement, Cubitt lived in Camberley, Surrey. He died on 25 January 1903, aged 67, and was buried in St. Peter&#x27;s Churchyard, Frimley, Surrey.

<text>David Vivian Currie, (8 July 1912 – 20 June 1986) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==

Currie was born in Sutherland, Saskatchewan, the only son and eldest child of David Henry Currie and his wife Mable Brimble. The elder Currie worked as an engineer for the Canadian Pacific Railroad. From 1913 to 1939 the family lived in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. D.V. Currie was educated at King George Public School, the Central Collegiate and Moose Jaw Technical School. He was trained as an automobile mechanic and welder.
==Military service==
In 1939 he joined the military, before joining the Regular Army the following year. He was commissioned as a lieutenant shortly afterward, before being promoted to captain in 1941. By 1944 he had reached the rank of major.

Currie was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in command of a battle group of tanks from The South Alberta Regiment, artillery, and infantry of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada at St. Lambert-sur-Dives in France, during the final actions to close the Falaise Gap. This was the only Victoria Cross awarded to a Canadian soldier during the Normandy campaign (6 June 1944 through to the end of August 1944), and the only VC ever awarded to a member of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps.

The then 32-year-old Currie was a Major in The South Alberta Regiment, Canadian Army during the Second World War. During the Battle of Falaise, Normandy, between 18–20 August 1944, Currie was in command of a small mixed force of tanks, self-propelled anti-tank guns, and infantry which had been ordered to cut off one of the Germans&#x27; main escape routes.

After Currie led the attack on the village of St. Lambert-sur-Dives and consolidated a position halfway inside it, his force repulsed repeated enemy attacks over the next day and a half. Despite heavy casualties, Major Currie&#x27;s small force destroyed seven enemy tanks, twelve 88 mm guns, and 40 vehicles, which led to the deaths of 300 German soldiers, 500 wounded, and 2,100 captured. The remnants of two German armies were denied an escape route.

On August 19, cameraman Jack Stollery filmed David Currie as the latter was overseeing the surrender of a group of German soldiers. This makes David Currie the only Victoria Cross recipient to have their action caught on film.

Currie later achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel. After his military career, he served as Sergeant at Arms in the House of Commons of Canada from 1960 to 1978. In this role, he also served as a production consultant on the politically-themed CBC Television drama series &quot;Quentin Durgens, M.P.&quot;.

He and his wife Isabel remained in Ottawa after his time in the Commons and died there in 1986 and both were buried in Isabel&#x27;s hometown of Owen Sound, Ontario at Greenwood Cemetery. An armory in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan has since been named the &quot;Lt. Colonel D.V. Currie Armoury&quot; in his honor and Currie Avenue in the Montgomery Place neighborhood of Saskatoon was named in his honor.

==Medals==
In August 2017, Currie&#x27;s VC and other medals were presented for auction by the British company of Dix Noonan Webb. The seller had purchased them from Currie&#x27;s widow in 1989, and they were being held by Canadian dealer Tanya Ursual. The sale price was £550,000 or slightly more than $916,000 Canadian dollars. Of the 16 Victoria Crosses awarded to Canadians in the Second World War, 12 were awarded to men serving in Canadian units. On 1 May 2018, the Canadian War Museum announced that it had acquired LCol. Currie&#x27;s medals through a concerted effort of the Department of Canadian Heritage, as well as several honorary members of the North Saskatchewan Regiment.

<text>There are two styles of gloves worn by ice hockey players. Skaters wear similar gloves on each hand, while goaltenders wear gloves of different types on each hand.

==Types of gloves==

===Skaters&#x27; gloves===
Skaters gloves help prevent the hands getting bruised and battered and stops them from getting burned from the ice. The top padding and shell thumb is designed to help protect the player from flying hockey pucks and opponents&#x27; ice hockey sticks.

In today&#x27;s hockey game, gloves will generally fall into two types of categories, the first being the traditional four-roll style. These types of gloves have more room on the inside, giving it a looser feel on the hand than the natural fit gloves. Hockey players who choose the four-roll style have less resistance in their fingers and hands, so wearing the gloves feels less noticeable. The other category of gloves are the tighter fitting, natural or anatomical fit glove. These have a much tighter fit than the four-roll gloves, and are designed to become an extension of the players&#x27; hand. The tapered gloves are tight on the hand, but ergonomically designed for better wrist mobility and range of motion. Hockey gloves also range in sizes, and are generally available in three categories: Youth size hockey gloves run , and ; Junior sizes are and ; and Senior sizes run , and .

===Goaltender&#x27;s gloves===
Goaltenders wear a different type of glove on each hand. While these gloves do offer the goaltender a measure of protection, their design is to aid the goaltender in performance of their duties. On the hand with which they carry their stick, often called the &quot;stick hand&quot;, the goaltender wears a blocker with a large pad across the back of the forearm, usually extending just beyond the wrist. National Hockey League rules mandate that the blocking glove may be no wider than and no longer than . The goaltender uses this blocker to deflect shots.

On the other hand, often called the &quot;glove hand&quot;, the goaltender wears a catching glove called a trapper, which is similar to a baseball glove. In addition to using it to catch shots, goaltenders can distribute caught pucks by tossing them from the catching glove. National Hockey League rules limit the perimeter of the catching glove to and the widest part of the glove may not exceed . Most goaltender&#x27;s glove hands are their non-dominant hand like in baseball, but exceptions do exist.

<doc id="1220456" wikidata="Q1428028" url="?curid=1220456" title="F3 (manga)">
<text>is a Japanese hentai manga series by Wanyan Aguda, which debuted in 1988 and spanned 5 volumes. The story centers on a 19-year-old girl named Hiroe Ogawa who has difficulty achieving orgasm. Three original video animations (&quot;OVAs&quot;) were produced by AIC and Pink Pineapple and were released in 1994. The OVAs originally released in North America by SoftCel Pictures, a division of ADV Films, and later re-released as &quot;F3: Ménage À Trois&quot;, an obvious group sex reference. Recently, &quot;F³&quot; had been re-licensed by Critical Mass under its original title when ADV Films closed their hentai line.

&quot;F³&quot; was followed by two sequels, and their translations into English highlight some of the difficulties faced in translating adult entertainment materials between two countries with very different laws and mores on the subject: in the first 25-minute episode, Hiroe&#x27;s attempts to achieve orgasm are assisted by her older sister Mayaka, and include an encounter with their mother, Yayoi. In the two sequels, translator&#x27;s notes insist that Mayaka and Yayoi are actually Hiroe&#x27;s neighbor and landlady, respectively, whom she just happens to have nicknamed &quot;Sis&quot; and &quot;Mom&quot;.

==Main characters==
*Hiroe Ogawa (小川広恵, &quot;Ogawa Hiroe&quot;) - The titular girl of the film and is a student at a nearby high school. She tries hard to achieve orgasm with her longtime boyfriend Sumio, but always fails. She usually resorts to hypnosis, masturbation, lesbian sex, and was once possessed by a horny incubus. Her blue hair often gets her mistaken for Ami Mizuno of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; fame. Voice Actress: (JP) Yumi Takada/(EN) Amanda Winn Lee, credited as Helen Bed in the original SoftCel dub/Whitney Thompson in the new Critical Mass DVD.
*Mayaka (真弥華) - Hiroe&#x27;s closest friend/older sister figure (younger of the neighbors) and a resident of the same boarding house that Hiroe lives at. Mayaka always tries to help Hiroe with her &quot;problem&quot; pulling out all the stops. During the first episode, she used hypnosis to help Hiroe achieve orgasm by simply touching her. That plan was later scrubbed for Episode 2. Voice Actress: (JP) Arisa Andō/(EN) Tiffany Grant, credited as Lucy Moralez in the original SoftCel dub/Kelly Benz in the new Critical Mass DVD.
*Yayoi (弥生) - Hiroe and Mayaka&#x27;s landlord whom they refer to as &quot;mother&quot; and is the owner of the boarding house that the girls reside in. She has a closet full of S &amp; M gear, whips and sexual toys. The kanji in Yayoi&#x27;s name is the same for the old archaic name of March on the Japanese calendar. Voice Actress: (JP) Miho Yoshida/(EN) Marcy Rae, credited as Verlinda Petme in the original SoftCel dub/Hentai Mona in the new Critical Mass DVD.
*Takami Oide (大出貴美, &quot;Oide Takami&quot;) - Hiroe&#x27;s misandronistic classmate from high school and an open lesbian. Takami appeared in episode 2 putting the moves on Hiroe underwater at the pool, then appeared at her house with two other lesbians. Takami also had a crush on Mayaka in episode 2 and was the first victim of rape in episode 3 from an incubus possessing Hiroe&#x27;s body. Voice Actress: (JP) Masami Toyoshima/ (EN) Bella Pussi in the Critical Mass DVD.
*Sumio (純雄) - Hiroe&#x27;s boyfriend from high school. Hiroe and Sumio have been going out for a long time and are sexually active when alone. Sumio&#x27;s not into sports as much as Hiroe is, but he loves to have a good time. Hiroe felt a little pain when she had sexual intercourse with Sumio six months ago, and vowed to finally achieve orgasm with him. Voice Actor: Christopher Bowen in the Critical Mass DVD.

==Minor characters==
*The Fortune-teller - Appeared in Episode 1. She was referred by Mayaka to help out Hiroe, but upon her reading, she felt spirits possessing her driving her insane with fear and lust. Voice Actress: (EN) Marcy Rae, credited as Verlinda Petme in the original SoftCel dub.
*The Professor - Appeared in Episode 1. He was a researcher at a top Japanese laboratory who was recently working on &quot;The Ultimate Sex Machine&quot; and used Hiroe as a test subject. To his dismay, Hiroe didn&#x27;t climax and the laboratory was in shambles leaving the professor severely injured in the blast.
*Takami&#x27;s Friends - Appeared in Episode 2. Neither of them had name but are both lesbians. They ganged up on Hiroe on Takami&#x27;s command, but were quickly disposed of by Yayoi using rapid-fire anal sex with a leather suit.
*Mia Chigusa 千草魅亜 - Appeared in Episode 3. The 24-hour exorcist who is a futanari. He/She dealt with the incubus trapped in Hiroe&#x27;s body while Yayoi electrocuted Hiroe with a super-charged vibrator in order to exorcise the demon. The incubus left Hiroe&#x27;s body and was sealed in a giant rubber blow-up doll.

==Episodes==
; Episode 1
: High school student Hiroe becomes depressed that she cannot reach orgasm when she tries masturbating, so Mayaka tries to help her out by performing cunnilingus on Hiroe, but to no avail. Mayaka then resorts to hypnotism, which turns out to be a bit too successful as Hiroe climaxes instantly whenever only Mayaka touches her. However, she is still unable to climax otherwise, so Mayaka tries some other methods, one of then turning out to be a crazy scientist. In the end though, only Mayaka&#x27;s touch is able to make Hiroe climax.
; Episode 2
: While on a date with Sumio at a water park, Hiroe is seduced by Takami into helping her get together with Mayaka, who she has a crush on. When Mayaka learns of her trick, she challenges Takami to a sex match, the winner being whoever can make Hiroe climax. They are stopped, however, by the landlady, Yayoi, before she joins in on the fun.
; Episode 3
: Hiroe is possessed by a perverted incubus who uses her body to rape the other residents. A futanari exorcist named Mia Chigusa is called to exorcise the succubus from Hiroe and trap it in a blow up doll.

<text>Emanuel Vincent Harris (26 June 1876 – 1 August 1971), often known as E. Vincent Harris, was an English architect who designed several important public buildings in traditional styles.

==Early life==
He was born in Devonport, Devon, and educated at Kingsbridge Grammar School. He was articled to the Plymouth architect James Harvey in 1893; in 1897 he moved to London, where he assisted E. Keynes Purchase, Leonard Stokes and Sir William Emerson. From 1901 to 1907 he worked for the London County Council before setting up in private practice.

He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1919 Birthday Honours.

==Work==
He was primarily a classicist; A. Stuart Gray wrote: &quot;Some of his buildings suggest the influence of Sir Edwin Lutyens, but are bolder, balder, and less subtle or more frank depending on one&#x27;s point of view.&quot; His work was often criticised by modernist architects. In his acceptance speech when he was awarded the RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 1951 Harris is reported to have said: &quot;Look, a lot of you here tonight don&#x27;t like what I do and I don&#x27;t like what a lot of you do ...&quot;.

He became an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1942. He died in Bath in 1971 and is buried in the village of Chaffcombe, Somerset.

<doc id="1220461" wikidata="Q2924966" url="?curid=1220461" title="Brian Moore (rugby union)">
<text>Brian Christopher Moore (born 11 January 1962) is an English former rugby union footballer. He played as a hooker, and is a rugby presenter and pundit for BBC Sport, Talksport and Love Sport Radio. He qualified as a Rugby Football Union referee in 2010.

==Early life==
Moore was born to single mother Rina Kirk in Birmingham. Abandoned by his father, his mother gave him up for adoption at 7 months old to Methodist lay preachers Ralph (deceased) and Dorothy Moore, of Halifax, West Yorkshire, where he lived in Illingworth and attended the Crossley and Porter School. He first played rugby union for the Old Crossleyans.

The shame he felt at being a victim of abuse made him keep silent about it until he visited the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre in London in 2008. He said the trauma made him ferociously competitive on the rugby field, and commented &quot;If you have been abused, you feel tainted by association with the awfulness of the crime.&quot;

==Education==
Moore studied law at the University of Nottingham gaining an LLB (Hons) degree in 1984, and was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Law on 14 July 2010. In 2023 he gained a Master&#x27;s degree in Psychology from the University of Westminster as well as diplomas in counselling and psychotherapy from Guildford College in 2016, 2017 and 2018.

==Rugby career==
Moore played as an amateur senior for Nottingham, the club where he made his name. During his time at Nottingham he won his first England caps and toured Australia with the British and Irish Lions. In 1990 he moved to London to train as a solicitor, and played for Harlequins. Moore ended his club career at Richmond.

Moore represented England, winning a total of 64 England caps between 1987 and 1995, making him the 13th most-capped Englishman (as of July 2007). Known for reading Shakespeare – in particular, parts of &quot;Henry V&quot; before a game in the dressing room to his teammates, Moore played in three Rugby World Cups including in 1991 where along with Jason Leonard and Jeff Probyn he was part of a destructive English front row as they reached the final, losing a tight match 12–6 to Australia at Twickenham. Moore was also a member of the England side which won Grand Slams in 1991, 1992 and 1995. In 1991, he was voted Rugby World Player of the Year, a decade before the sport&#x27;s governing body (the IRB), began its awards programme.

He went on two British and Irish Lions tours, winning five test caps. In Australia in 1989, the Lions won the series 2–1, and Moore was famously caught celebrating the morning after on Sydney Harbour Bridge, doing aeroplane impressions.

Having been a vocal critic of referees for many years, Moore took the Rugby Football Union&#x27;s Entry Level Referee Award course and qualified as a referee in 2010.

==Professional career==
Moore trained as a solicitor, and he was a partner in both Edward Lewis LLP, and later Memery Crystal LLP. Although still qualified to practise, he has not done so since 2003.

==Media career==
After retirement, Moore continued his legal career, and was asked regularly by the BBC to supplement their rugby commentary team. It is his full-time career, and he regularly commentated alongside Eddie Butler on the BBC&#x27;s rugby union coverage, including the English matches in the Six Nations Championship. Moore is known for his blunt and straight-talking style. in 2008, he was heard to yell &quot;They&#x27;ve kicked it away again, &quot;for God&#x27;s sake&quot;!&quot;, when England did not run the ball in Rome, and shouted &quot;You halfwit!&quot; when an England forward played a French restart which had fallen short of the required ten metres, causing England to lose possession when they would otherwise have been awarded a scrum. His 6 Nations broadcasting was, as part of the overall BBC coverage, shortlisted in the Sport category of the 2011 BAFTA Television Awards..

Moore covered the 2011 Rugby World Cup for TalkSport Radio as lead co-commentator. He commentated on this tournament alongside Michael Owen, Scott Quinnell, Gavin Hastings, Paul Wallace, Phil Vickery, John Taylor, Andrew McKenna and David Campese. The coverage was shortlisted in the Broadcast of the Year category in the 2011 Sports Journalists Awards. He returned to Talksport in 2013 for their exclusively live coverage of the British and Irish Lions Tour of Australia, he presented every tour match live with Mark Saggers and commentated on the 3 test matches live. He commentated with Andrew McKenna, David Campese, Shane Williams, Michael Lynagh, Sean Holley and Sir Ian McGeechan. He joined talksport permanently in 201314 and now hosts their rugby show, Full Contact, every Sunday from 8pm to 10pm. He also co-hosted the Sports Breakfast alongside Alan Brazil on Tuesday mornings from 6am to 10am before leaving the station in 2016.

Moore writes on rugby, with a Monday column for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, and was shortlisted for Sports Journalist of the Year in the 2009 British Press Awards. After meeting Richard Stott at a corporate dinner, he wrote a wine column in the &quot;Today&quot; newspaper, transferred to the &quot;Sun&quot; for four years. He was a judge at the IWSC awards in 2018 held at the Oval, London.

Moore has made other media appearances, including in November 2008 on &quot;Question Time.&quot;

Moore has had books published by Simon &amp; Schuster. His updated version of his autobiography, &quot;Beware of the Dog&quot; (2009), won the 2010 William Hill Sports Book of the Year award, among what was described as one of the strongest shortlists ever assembled. In 2011 it won the Best Autobiography award at the British Sports Book Awards. He has also published &quot;The Thoughts of chairman Moore&quot;, and &quot;More Thoughts of chairman Moore&quot; (2011).

He has been a regular invitee at leading UK literary festivals – including Hay, Keswick, Dartington Hall, Salisbury and Wimbledon.

Moore drew criticism for a comment he made during the 2020 Six Nations match between Ireland and France where he referenced bulimia when a player vomited at the side of the pitch during the match. Following criticism Moore apologised the next day, stating that he had meant the comment humorously but realised it was misjudged. The BBC later stated they had spoken to Moore about the comments and that the matter was now resolved.

===&quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;===
Moore was the guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on 24 February 2012 where he was interviewed at length by Kirsty Young. His music choices were Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart — Queen of the Night aria; Ian Dury and The Blockheads — &quot;Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick&quot;; Genesis — &quot;In the Cage&quot;; Samuel Barber — &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot;; Pink Floyd — &quot;Us and Them&quot;; The Stranglers — &quot;Always the Sun&quot;; Green Day — &quot;Jesus of Suburbia&quot;; Pietro Mascagni — The Intermezzo from &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot;. His choice of book was &quot;Germinal&quot; by Émile Zola and his luxury choice was a spherical football.

==Personal life==
Moore&#x27;s first marriage was to Penny and second marriage was to Lucy Thompson in 2000 in Kensington and Chelsea, London, by whom he had a daughter, Imogen. Both those marriages ended in divorce. His third wife is Belinda, who he married in 2008. They have three daughters including twins.

He is a supporter of, and season ticket holder at, Chelsea football club. In 2001 it was reported that he was a lifetime Labour Party voter. He left the Party after the decision to go to war in Iraq in 2003 and is now non-affiliated.

Moore attended the funeral of his birth mother in January 2020. He revealed afterwards on Twitter that he had discovered in so doing he was half Chinese, not half Malaysian as previously believed, and his grandfather had been a steelworker in Rotherham.

He, along with Prince Harry, both argued that in response to Black Lives Matter, the song &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot;, should no longer be sung in a rugby context.

<text>Hampden Zane Churchill Cockburn (19 November 1867 – 12 July 1913) was a Canadian soldier who won the Victoria Cross, the most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, for his actions during the Battle of Leliefontein during the Second Boer War.

==Early life==
Born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Cockburn was a graduate of Upper Canada College in Toronto. On 20 November 1891, Cockburn joined the Canadian Militia and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant with The Governor General&#x27;s Body Guard.

== Second Boer War ==
When the Second Boer War broke out in 1899, Cockburn, then a 32-year-old lieutenant, volunteered for service in The Royal Canadian Dragoons, Canadian Militia, and was posted to South Africa with the regiment, where the action took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 7 November 1900, during the Battle of Leliefontein near the Komati River, a large force of Boer commandos sought to encircle a retreating British column whose rearguard comprised two troops of Royal Canadian Dragoons and two 12-pounder guns of &quot;D&quot; Battery, Royal Canadian Field Artillery. Cockburn and Lieutenant Richard Turner commanded a small group of troopers who repulsed the Boers at close range, allowing the two field guns to escape capture. Sergeant Edward Holland of the Royal Canadian Dragoons, ably assisted them with good machine-gun work, finally fleeing in the face of superior Boer force with the machine gun under his arm to avoid its capture. All the men under Cockburn&#x27;s command were either killed, wounded or captured. Cockburn was also wounded during the action.

Following the battle, three men of the Royal Canadian Dragoons were awarded the Victoria Cross: Cockburn, Turner and Holland.

The citations were published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 23 April 1901. Cockburn&#x27;s read:

== Return to Canada ==
Following the Boer War, Cockburn returned to Canada, and eventually achieved the rank of major. He died in a horse-riding accident in Grayburn, Saskatchewan, in 1913, and was buried at St. James Cemetery, Toronto, Ontario, with a headstone at Hill A, Section S 1/2, Lot 11.

== Medal ==
Cockburn&#x27;s Victoria Cross and sword were, for many years, displayed in the lobby of his alma mater, Upper Canada College. In 1977, the school had a high-quality copy made for display, and moved the original to safe-keeping.

<doc id="1220475" wikidata="Q7529697" url="?curid=1220475" title="Sir William Montgomery-Cuninghame, 9th Baronet">
<text>Sir William James Montgomery-Cuninghame, 9th Baronet (20 May 1834 – 11 November 1897) was a British Army officer from Scotland, Conservative politician and Victoria Cross recipient.

==Early life==
Montgomery-Cuninghame was born in Ayr to Sir Thomas Montgomery-Cuninghame, 8th Baronet of Corsehill and Charlotte Niven Doig Hutcheson, the eldest of seven children. 

His paternal grandparents were Sir James Montgomery-Cuninghame, 6th Baronet and Janet Cuming (a daughter of Edinburgh banker Thomas Cuming, Esq., of Earnside, Nairnshire and Hatton, Cheshire). His mother was the only child of Hugh Hutcheson of Southfield, Renfrewshire.

Between April 1849 and 1851 he was educated at Harrow School.

==Career==
Montgomery-Cuninghame had a long and distinguished military career, which began in 1853 when, on 11 March 1853, he became ensign in the 1st Regiment (by purchase). By 29 April 1853 he had become a second lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade. 

===Crimean War===

In October 1853, the Crimean War broke out and he was present at the battles of Alma, Balaclava, Inkerman and the siege and fall of Sebastapol. He served in the Crimean War as a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion, The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own). On 20 November 1854 at Sebastopol, the Crimea, he, with another lieutenant (Claud Thomas Bourchier) was with a party detailed to drive the Russians from some rifle pits. Advancing on the pits after dark, they launched a surprise attack and drove the Russian riflemen from their cover, but, in the fierce fighting which ensued, the officer in command of the party was killed. The two lieutenants, however, maintained their advantage, withstood all attacks from the enemy during the night and held the position until relieved next day. For their actions they were subsequently awarded the Victoria Cross.

He was mentioned in Lord Raglan&#x27;s despatches and &quot;his bravery elicited the admiration of General Canrobert, who instantly published an order expressive of his approbation.&quot; Montgomery-Cuninghame was one of the earliest recipients of the Victoria Cross. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Green Jackets Museum, Winchester, England. During the Crimean conflict, he was also awarded the Order of the Medjidie 5th Class
and the Turkish Crimea Medal

===Later military career===
After the end of the Crimean War, on 22 November 1856, Montgomery-Cuninghame held the rank of captain and became an instructor of musketry at the Rifle Brigade He was still serving in the military when on 14 August 1867, he was promoted to major half pay by purchase

Nine months later, on 22 May 1868, he was appointed lieutenant colonel of the Inns of Court Rifle Volunteer Corps In 1877, he was a major with the Ayr and Wigtown Militia. 
On 9 August 1884, Major Montgomery Cuninghame was granted the honorary rank of lieutenant colonel in the 4th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers. On 17 October 1888 he was granted the rank of colonel in the Volunteer Force and placed in command of The Clyde Brigade. He also held the appointment of brigadier general of the Clyde Brigade and then of the Glasgow Brigade of the Volunteer Force.

In July 1897, he was expected to accompany the Volunteer Glasgow Infantry Brigade (which he had commanded since its inception) to Aldershot, where they were to perform duties akin to regular battalions stationed there. This was the first time in the history of the volunteer movement this was to occur. However, during the negotiations for this historic event, he resigned due to ill health.

===Political career===
On 28 August 1871 Montgomery-Cuninghame was commissioned as Deputy Lieutenant of Ayrshire.

He sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Ayr Burghs from 31 January 1874 to 31 March 1880.

He was a Justice of the Peace for the counties of Lanark and Wigtown.

<text>David Robert Blake (March 20, 1925 – February 25, 2008) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1971 to 1988, serving as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party.

Born on the family farm near Rapid City, Manitoba, Blake served in the Royal Canadian Air Force as a navigator from 1943 to 1945, and was in the Sixth Forward Regiment of the Royal Canadian Engineers from 1948 to 1964. He worked for the Royal Bank of Canada, retiring in 1988. Blake was also active in the Royal Canadian Legion, freemasonry and the Manitoba Wildlife Association.

Blake was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by-election on November 15, 1971, replacing former Progressive Conservative Premier Walter Weir in the rural riding of Minnedosa. He defeated his nearest opponent Emil Shellborn of the New Democratic Party, by over 1,000 votes. He was later re-elected in the provincial elections of 1973, 1977, 1981 and 1986, usually by about the same margin as in his initial victory.

In 1951, he married Gwen Bergman of Flin Flon and they had 5 children together.

<text>Arthur George Knight VC (26 June 1886 – 3 September 1918) was an English-Canadian soldier. Knight was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Knight was one of seven Canadian to be awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions on one single day, 2 September 1918, for actions across the 30 km long Drocourt-Quéant Line near Arras, France. The other six recipients were Bellenden Hutcheson, William Henry Metcalf, Claude Joseph Patrick Nunney, Cyrus Wesley Peck, Walter Leigh Rayfield and John Francis Young.

==Details==
Knight emigrated from England to Canada in 1911 and enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force in December 1914 at Regina, Saskatchewan. In November 1917, Knight was awarded the Croix de Guerre by his Majesty Leopold III, King of the Belgians, for his actions. Knight was 32 years old, and an acting sergeant in the 10th Battalion, CEF during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 2 September 1918 at Villers-les-Cagnicourt, France, when a bombing section which he was leading was held up, Sergeant Knight went forward alone, bayoneting several machine-gunners and trench mortar crews, and forcing the rest to retire. Then bringing forward a Lewis gun he directed his fire on the retreating enemy; his platoon went in pursuit and the sergeant, seeing about 30 of the enemy going into a tunnel leading off the trench, again went forward alone, killing an officer and two NCOs and taking 20 prisoners. After this, again single-handed, he routed another hostile party. Later he was fatally wounded.

==Further information==
Knight is buried at Dominion Cemetery in Hendecourt-les-Cagnicourt, Pas-de-Calais, France. The cemetery is roughly three kilometres northeast of the village (plot I, row F, grave 15). His Victoria Cross is on display in The Calgary Highlanders gallery at The Military Museums, on loan from the Glenbow Museum in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

A plaque commemorating Knight&#x27;s VC action was dedicated in Villers-les-Cagnicourt in April 2015 by a delegation of The Calgary Highlanders.

<doc id="1220499" wikidata="Q14946528" url="?curid=1220499" title="Conflation">
<text>Conflation is the merging of two or more sets of information, texts, ideas, or opinions into one, often in error. Conflation is defined as &#x27;fusing blending&#x27;, but is often used colloquially as &#x27;being equal to&#x27; - treating two similar but disparate concepts as the same. Merriam Webster suggested this shift in usage happened relatively recently, entering their dictionary in 1973. 

In logic, it is the practice of treating two distinct concepts as one, which produces errors or misunderstandings as a fusion of distinct subjects tends to obscure analysis of relationships which are emphasized by contrasts. However, if the distinctions between the two concepts may appear to be superficial, intentional conflation can be desirable for the sake of conciseness and recall.

==Communication and reasoning==
The result of conflating concepts may give rise to fallacies and ambiguity, including the fallacy of four terms in a categorical syllogism. For example, the word &quot;bat&quot; has at least two distinct meanings: a flying animal, and a piece of sporting equipment (such as a baseball bat or cricket bat). If these meanings are not distinguished, the result may be the following categorical syllogism, which may be seen as a joke (pun):

:#All bats are animals.
:#Some wooden objects are bats.
:#Therefore, some wooden objects are animals.

Using words with different meanings can help clarify, or can cause real confusion. English words with multiple (verb) meanings can be illustrated by instances in which a motion is merged with or a causation with manner, e.g. &quot;the bride floated towards her future.&quot; In this example, the bride may be married on a boat, airplane, or hot-air balloon, etc. She could be walking the aisle towards matrimony. The verb &quot;float&quot; has multiple meanings, and both verb meanings in the example may be proper uses of a bride &quot;floating&quot; toward a future. The &quot;manner&quot; of the scene, described by further context, would explain the true meaning of the sentence.

In an alternate illustrative example, &quot;respect&quot; is used both in the sense of recognizing a right and having high regard for someone or something. We can &quot;respect someone&#x27;s right&quot; to an opinion without &quot;holding this idea in high regard&quot;. But conflation of these two different concepts leads to the notion that all ideological ideas should be treated with respect, rather than just the right to hold these ideas. Conflation in logical terms is very similar to equivocation.

==Taxonomic conflation==
In linguistic, taxonomic conflation happens when a polysemic term is on two or more taxic levels. This presents a difficulty in translation. An example is &quot;sex-based conflation&quot;. For example, &quot;spokesman&quot;, depending on the context, may mean a &quot;spokesman who is man&quot; and a &quot;spokeswoman&quot;.

<text>Ruhnu (; ; ) is an Estonian island in the Gulf of Riga in the Baltic Sea. Its territory of is administratively part of Saare &quot;maakond&quot; (county). Ruhnu lies geographically closer to the coast of Courland on the mainland of Latvia than it is to any point in the rest of Estonia. With less than 150 official residents, the Ruhnu &quot;vald&quot; (parish) has the smallest population of Estonia&#x27;s 79 municipalities. Before 1944, it was for centuries populated by ethnic Swedes and traditional Swedish law was used.

==Important Bird Area==
The island has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant numbers of long-tailed ducks and velvet scoters, both wintering and on passage. 

== History ==

The first archaeological artifacts of human activity in Ruhnu, assumed to be related to seasonal seal hunting, date back to around 5000 BC. The time of arrival of the first ancient Scandinavians in Ruhnu and the beginning of a permanent Swedish-speaking settlement is not known. It probably did not precede the Northern Crusades at the beginning of the 13th century, when the indigenous peoples of all the lands surrounding the Gulf of Riga were converted to Christianity and subjugated to the Teutonic Order. The first documented record of the island of Ruhnu, and of its Swedish population, is a 1341 letter sent by the Bishop of Courland which confirmed the islanders&#x27; right to reside and manage their property in accordance with Swedish law.

Ruhnu was controlled by the Kingdom of Sweden (1621–1708, formally until 1721) and after that by the Russian Empire until World War I, when it was occupied by Imperial German armed forces (1915–1918).

Under the tsarist Russian rule in the 18th–19th century the island had &quot;de facto&quot; independence in most affairs, though designated as crown land. The island&#x27;s Lutheran clergyman served as &quot;gutsverwalter&quot; (estate custodian) in matters of state. In the middle of the 19th century, a majority of the islanders sought to leave Lutheranism and join the Russian Orthodox Church, and formal steps in this direction took place in 1866 with papers exchanged with the Orthodox dean of Saaremaa in anticipation of Orthodox chrismation. But the planned conversion did not proceed.

After World War I, despite some local initiatives to rejoin Sweden, and territorial claims by Latvia, the islanders agreed to become part of newly independent Estonia in 1919 (possibly due to the existence of a Swedish minority in Estonia). According to a census taken in 1934, Ruhnu had a population of 282: 277 ethnic Swedes and 5 ethnic Estonians.

During World War II, Ruhnu, along with the rest of Estonia, was first occupied by Soviet Union (1940–1941) and then Nazi Germany (1941–1944). In November 1943, the first group of about 75 islanders relocated to Sweden. In August 1944, shortly before the Red Army of the Soviet Union reoccupied Estonia, the remaining population of the island, except for two families, fled by ship to Sweden. The islanders in Sweden established an association, &quot;Runöbornas förening&quot;, to preserve the history and culture of Ruhnu&#x27;s original population.

During the period of Soviet occupation after 1944, the island was repopulated by Estonian civilians and also hosted a unit of the Soviet Air Defence Forces. The property of the former islanders was declared property of the state and a collective farm was established. In 1965 the first Ruhnu-Kihnu Games were held, this cultural and sports festival attracting attention throughout Estonia. Following a severe storm in 1969 and the closure of the local fishery collective in 1970, the population declined from 222 to only 58.

== Life on Ruhnu today ==

After Estonia regained independence in 1991, buildings, land, and other property on Ruhnu Island were returned to those with ownership claims that went back to before to the Soviet occupation of Estonia, or to their descendants. In case of Ruhnu, those descendants were mostly resident in Sweden. Most of them did not return to Ruhnu, but they still occasionally visit the land of their ancestors.

Ruhnu is served by the Ruhnu Airfield which has scheduled flights from Pärnu and Kuressaare from October to April. Passenger ferries operate from May to October from Pärnu, Roomassaare and Munalaid.

The island has a quadripod tower lighthouse, which stands on the highest point of the island, Haubjerre hill. It was prefabricated in France and shipped to Ruhnu for assembly in 1877. The structure is believed to have been designed by Gustave Eiffel.

The Ruhnu wooden church, built in 1644, is one of the oldest wood constructed buildings in Estonia. The church&#x27;s baroque-style tower was finished in 1755. The stone Lutheran church next to the wooden one was built in 1912 and is currently where services are held.

Limo beach is one of the island&#x27;s most popular and accessible beaches for tourists.

Geologically the island is the higher part of a submarine drumlin-like ridge.

Ruhnu is home to a rare native breed of sheep called the Estonian Ruhnu (). The breed numbers approximately 33 individuals and are used primarily for wool. A herd of fifty highland cattle were introduced to Ruhnu in 2013, in an attempt to restore the semi-natural coastal meadows in the southwestern part of the island.

In the spring of 2006, a brown bear arrived on Ruhnu via an ice floe across the Gulf of Riga from the mainland of Latvia, some away. The bear&#x27;s journey and resettlement on the island became a highly publicized media sensation in both the Estonian and Latvian press, as Ruhnu has been devoid of any large carnivores for many centuries. The bear continued to evade capture for months and environment ministry officials reported that tourists hoping to catch a glimpse of the elusive bear outnumbered permanent residents. The bear is believed by authorities to have since returned to Latvia.

<text>George Gristock VC (14 January 1905 – 16 June 1940) was a South African serving in the British Army and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Gristock was born and raised in Pretoria, South Africa but emigrated to the UK before the Second World War. He was 35 years old, and a Warrant Officer Class II holding the appointment of company sergeant major in 2nd Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment, British Army during the Second World War. During the Battle of Belgium the 2nd Battalion was part of the British Expeditionary Force.

On 21 May 1940 near the River Escaut, Belgium, south of Tournai. Company Sergeant-Major Gristock organized a party of eight riflemen and went forward to cover the company&#x27;s right flank, where the enemy had broken through. He then went on with one man under heavy fire and was severely wounded in both legs, but having gained his fire position undetected, he managed to put out of action a machine-gun which was inflicting heavy casualties and kill the crew of four. He then dragged himself back to the right flank position but refused to be evacuated until contact with the battalion had been established. He later died of his wounds. &quot;The Times&quot; later reported, &quot;By his gallant action the position of the company was secured, and many casualties prevented.&quot;

Gristock is buried at Bear Road Cemetery, Brighton, Sussex, England in the War Graves Section (Plot Z.G.L. Grave 28).

===Victoria Cross citation===
The announcement and accompanying citation for the decoration was published in supplement to the London Gazette on 23 August 1940.

==The medal==
Gristock&#x27;s Victoria Cross is in the collection of the Royal Norfolk Regimental Museum in Norwich Castle, England.

<text>I&#x27;m Your Baby Tonight is the third studio album by American singer Whitney Houston. It was released on November 6, 1990, by Arista Records. The album is one of the best-selling female albums of all time and has been certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

==Background==
By 1989, Whitney Houston had become one of the most successful musicians in the industry, with her last two albums—&quot;Whitney Houston&quot; (1985) and &quot;Whitney&quot; (1987)—having sold a combined 30 million copies at the time. Houston&#x27;s crossover blend of pop and R&amp;B had helped her to break barriers on pop radio and on MTV, which along with the commercial breakthrough of Michael Jackson, led to the music industry enjoying &quot;the best time for crossover artists since the height of disco in the mid-to-late &#x27;70s&quot;, according to journalist Frank Rizzo in 1987. Despite this, however, some black critics began to voice their disapproval of Houston&#x27;s music, especially with her sophomore release, &quot;Whitney&quot;, which included the number-one hits, the dance-pop hit &quot;I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)&quot; and, in particular, the rock song, &quot;So Emotional&quot;. These critics accused the singer of &quot;selling out&quot; by neglecting black musical influences in favor of music intended to appeal to white audiences. They also felt that her records lacked the soul of her live performances of the same songs. Houston&#x27;s name was jeered by some in the audience at both the 1988 and 1989 Soul Train Music Awards (where she first met future husband Bobby Brown) after she was announced as a nominee in a category. Houston defended herself against the criticism telling &quot;Essence&quot; magazine in 1990, &quot;If you&#x27;re gonna have a long career, there&#x27;s a certain way to do it and I did it that way. I&#x27;m not ashamed of it.&quot;

Still, both Houston and her label head Clive Davis agreed to go into a more urban direction as popular music was starting to embrace a new urban pop genre called new jack swing. Even as her sophomore album &quot;Whitney&quot; was blanketing airwaves in the spring of 1988, music industry insiders were speculating that &quot;[t]here is talk her next album will have a &#x27;black direction&#x27;.&quot; As the material on her previous albums had been picked by the label, Houston wanted more creative control over the album&#x27;s content. As a result, Houston would serve as an executive producer for the first time on an album. She recruited the new jack swing production team of L.A. Reid and Babyface, citing their work on Bobby Brown&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;, to help her with her new direction. The duo would present the songs &quot;I&#x27;m Your Baby Tonight&quot;, &quot;My Name Is Not Susan&quot;, their sole ballad &quot;Miracle&quot; and &quot;Anymore&quot;. Houston also recruited longtime idol Stevie Wonder on the album with the two collaborating on the Wonder-composed duet, &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Know&quot;, while longtime friend, singer Luther Vandross, penned the dance-pop song &quot;Who Do You Love&quot;.

Houston would also produce a song herself, &quot;I&#x27;m Knockin&#x27;&quot;, which was written for her by longtime musical collaborator and the musical director of her concert tours, Rickey Minor and BeBe Winans. Houston would co-produce and co-write another song with Winans titled &quot;Takin&#x27; a Chance&quot;. Houston and Davis kept previous producers Michael Masser and Narada Michael Walden. With Masser, Houston was received the soft rock song, &quot;After We Make Love&quot;, which would end up being their last collaboration together, while with Walden, Houston recorded the songs &quot;I Belong to You&quot;, &quot;Lover for Life&quot;, and the Linda Clifford ballad &quot;All the Man That I Need&quot;, the sole cover of the album. Houston and Walden also worked on songs such as &quot;Higher Love&quot;, &quot;Dancing on the Smooth Edge&quot; and &quot;Feels So Good&quot;. At the end, &quot;Takin&#x27; a Chance&quot; and the three latter Walden productions were left off the album&#x27;s final track list, except in Japan where &quot;Higher Love&quot; and &quot;Takin&#x27; a Chance&quot; were featured.

==Music==
&quot;I&#x27;m Your Baby Tonight&quot;″s Walden-produced songs are divided by contemporary dance-pop tracks and ornate ballads, while Reid and Babyface&#x27;s productions reappropriate 1970s black pop and danceable funk with aggressive 1980s dance rhythms. According to AllMusic&#x27;s Ashley S. Battel, Houston &quot;attempts to make a larger foray into dance music&quot; with this album, while David Browne observed light synthesizer flourishes, thumping drum beats, and &quot;dance-fever settings&quot; throughout. James Hunter of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the album as &quot;a case study in how much [Houston] can get out of her luscious and straightforward vocal gifts within a dancepop framework.&quot; J. D. Considine wrote that Houston&#x27;s singing on the album features &quot;sultry moans, note-bending asides, [and] window-rattling gospel shouts&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Jim Macnie said that the album &quot;displayed a slick R&amp;B edge&quot; and features &quot;funk-and-dance-driven pop&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
In the United States, &quot;I&#x27;m Your Baby Tonight&quot; debuted at number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, for the issue dated November 24, 1990. In its second week, it leapt to number five; the following week saw its peak position, at number three. The album spent 22 weeks in the top ten, and was on the chart for a total of 51 weeks. It also debuted at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B Albums chart, the issue date of December 1, 1990, and reached the number one position of that chart three weeks later. The record was at the top of the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart for eight non-consecutive weeks, and was present on that chart for a total of 53 weeks. Due to its great performance on the chart, it became the #1 R&amp;B album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; year-end charts for 1991. The album was certified 4× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on April 5, 1995, and since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales data in May 1991, it had sold (as of 2009) 1,728,000 copies in the United States; this numerical amount does not include copies sold in the initial months of the album&#x27;s release or its sales through mail-order sources such as Columbia House or BMG Music Club. This is not its sales total, as the biggest portion of the sales occurred in November 1990, before there was Nielsen SoundScan.

The album was a hit internationally (though its sales didn&#x27;t reach a level as high as the previous two albums), boosting Houston to global super-stardom. In Britain, it entered the UK Albums Chart at number 6 on November 17, 1990, and peaked at number 4, nine weeks later. The British Phonographic Industry certified the album Platinum, for shipments of 300,000 units, on November 1, 1990. In Germany, the album peaked at number three on the Media Control Albums Chart, receiving Platinum certification (for shipments of 500,000 copies), by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie, in 1991. It also reached the top five in other countries, such as Austria, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. To date, the album has sold approximately 10 million copies worldwide.

==Singles==
&quot;I&#x27;m Your Baby Tonight&quot; yielded four top-twenty singles on the Hot 100 Singles chart, and six top-twenty singles on the Hot R&amp;B Singles chart between 1990 and 1992. &quot;I&#x27;m Your Baby Tonight&quot; and &quot;All the Man That I Need&quot; both reached number 1. This success earned Houston a ranking of number 3 Pop singles artist and number 1 R&amp;B singles artist on the 1991 &quot;Billboard&quot; year-end charts.

The title track, &quot;I&#x27;m Your Baby Tonight&quot;, was released as the first single from the album in October 1990. While the L.A. Reid/Babyface mix version was released in the United States and Latin America, an alternate Yvonne Turner mix, labeled the international version or European version, was released in other countries. The single debuted at number forty-two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart in the week ending October 20, 1990. Six weeks later, in the issue dated December 1, 1990, it reached number one and stayed there for a week, becoming Houston&#x27;s eighth number-one single on the chart. It also peaked at number one in the same week on the Hot R&amp;B Singles chart and remained on the top for two weeks, making it her fourth R&amp;B chart topper. In addition, the song peaked at number seven on the Hot Adult Contemporary chart, spending a total of twenty-eight weeks on the chart. The single was certified Gold for shipments of 500,000 copies by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on November 27, 1990. Worldwide it was a big hit during her European promotion in November–December 1990. In Italy, it reached number one on the &quot;Musica e dischi&quot; singles chart in November 1990 and remained atop for five weeks. In the United Kingdom, the single entered the UK Singles Chart at number sixteen on October 20, 1990, and peaked at number five two weeks later, becoming her eighth top ten hit. It also reached the top five in many countries such as Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. It also went top ten in Australia and Ireland. Houston was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female with this track at the 33rd Grammy Awards of 1991.

Houston&#x27;s remake of a ballad, &quot;All the Man That I Need&quot; was the album&#x27;s second single, released in December 1990. The single achieved great success on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. It debuted at number fifty-three on the Hot 100 on December 22, 1990, and topped the chart nine weeks later, in the issue dated February 23, 1991. On March 2, 1991, when it reached the number one on the Hot R&amp;B Singles chart, the single enjoyed its second and third week at the top of the Hot 100 and Hot Adult Contemporary chart, respectively. As a result, it became her first single to top the Hot 100, Hot R&amp;B, and Hot Adult Contemporary chart simultaneously—which &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; also achieved for five weeks in 1992/93—and overall her third triple-crown hit, after 1985&#x27;s &quot;Saving All My Love for You&quot; and 1986&#x27;s &quot;How Will I Know&quot; both reached the top spot on those three charts in different weeks. The RIAA certified it Gold on March 21, 1991. Unlike the United States, it was a modest hit globally. It peaked at number one on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Top 100 Singles chart for one week and number ten on Belgian VRT Top 30 chart. However, it only reached the top twenty in Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. With this song, Houston received a nomination for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female at the 34th Grammy Awards in 1992, which was her fifth nomination in that category.

After the release of &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; single, &quot;Miracle&quot; was released as the third single from the album in April 1991. It peaked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on June 8, 1991, becoming her thirteenth top ten hit on the chart. It also reached number two and number four, on the Hot R&amp;B Singles and Adult Contemporary chart, respectively. The album&#x27;s fourth single &quot;My Name Is Not Susan&quot; was released in July 1991. In September, the song peaked at number twenty on the Hot 100 and number eight on the Hot R&amp;B, becoming her fifteenth R&amp;B top ten hit. A fifth single, &quot;I Belong to You&quot;, became a top ten R&amp;B single and garnered Houston a Grammy nomination for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance at the 35th Grammy Awards.

&quot;We Didn&#x27;t Know&quot;, a duet with Stevie Wonder, was the sixth and final single from the album, released exclusively for R&amp;B airplay in April 1992. It peaked at number twenty on the Hot R&amp;B Singles chart in the issue dated July 4, 1992. Included on the tracklisting of the album&#x27;s Japanese edition is a cover of Steve Winwood&#x27;s &quot;Higher Love&quot;, which was resurrected by Norwegian DJ Kygo in 2019, and &quot;Takin&#x27; a Chance&quot;; the latter became a success in the country.

<text>General Sir Collingwood Dickson (20 November 1817 – 28 November 1904) was a senior British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and career==
Collingwood Dickson was a son of Major General Sir Alexander Dickson, a Royal Artillery officer. He was educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and followed his father into the Royal Artillery in 1835. He served in the First Carlist War, in which the United Kingdom supported Queen Isabella II. After that war, Queen Isabella awarded him three Spanish decorations: the Order of Charles III, the Royal and Military Order of San Fernando and the Order of Isabella the Catholic.

==Victoria Cross action==
At the siege of Sebastopol during the Crimean War, Dickson was a lieutenant colonel on the staff of Lord Raglan. Following an incident during the siege, Dickson was awarded the VC:
Dickson was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1855, and in 1856, along with many other British soldiers, he was appointed &quot;Chevalier&quot; of the French Legion of Honour; shortly before the publication of his VC award in 1857 he was promoted to the next higher rank of the Legion, &quot;Officier&quot;.

==Later life==
From September 1855 till the end of the Crimean War Dickson was employed with the Turkish contingent, and the Sultan awarded him the Order of the Medjidie (third class).

Later in his army service Dickson was Inspector-General of Artillery 1870–75. He was made Colonel commandant of the Royal Artillery in 1875, and was promoted to full general in 1877. He officially retired in 1884, but remained Colonel Commandant until his death in 1904. His Victoria Cross and his many other medals are on display at the Royal Artillery Museum.

<text>Major Wilfred Edwards VC (16 February 1893 – 4 January 1972) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy by British and Commonwealth forces.

Edwards was born on 16 February 1893. He was 24 years old, and a private in the 7th Battalion, The King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, British Army during the First World War, and was awarded the VC for his actions on 16 August 1917 at Langemarck, Belgium:

Edwards was commissioned a second lieutenant in December 1917 and was demobilised in June 1919. He re-enlisted in the army when World War II broke out and rose to the rank of major.

He died in January 1972. His medals are displayed in the Kings Own Yorkshire Light Infantry Museum, Doncaster, England.

<text>The Oregon Historical Society (OHS) is an organization that encourages and promotes the study and understanding of the history of the State of Oregon, within the broader context of U.S. history. Incorporated in 1898, the Society collects, preserves, and makes available materials of historical character and interest, and collaborates with other groups and individuals with similar aims. The society operates the Oregon History Center that includes the Oregon Historical Society Museum in downtown Portland.

==History==
The Society was organized on December 17, 1898, in Portland at the Portland Library Building. Its mission, as expressed in the first volume of its &quot;Oregon Historical Quarterly&quot;, was to &quot;bring together in the most complete measure possible the data for the history of the commonwealth, and to stimulate the widest and highest use of them.&quot; The first president was Harvey W. Scott, with memberships totaling 370 in the first year. George H. Himes was appointed the Society&#x27;s first curator in 1899, a post he retained for four decades, until February 1939.

Shortly after its formation, the Society opened its first office and museum in Portland City Hall and began the development of a regional research library and a collection of historical artifacts. In 1900, the first issue of the &quot;Oregon Historical Quarterly&quot; was printed as the official publication of the organization. In 1913, the Society moved from city hall to the Tourny Building, at 2nd and Taylor streets, but remained there for only 4½ years, moving again in September 1917 into Portland&#x27;s then-new Public Auditorium (now Keller Auditorium). In 1966, the Society moved to its current location.

Thomas Vaughan stepped down from his 35-year directorship in 1989. Chet Orloff, who had left OHS in 1987 for the Ninth Judicial Circuit Historical Society in Pasadena, California, was considered by &quot;The Oregonian&quot; to be heir-apparent, but Bill Tramposch was brought in from Williamsburg, Virginia. Tramposch inherited a million-dollar deficit from the previous administration, and his three-year plan to eliminate the deficit, though supported by the board, was unpopular with many long-time staff members, who also criticized Tramposch&#x27;s management style. Tramposch resigned in 1991, and Orloff returned as executive director in 1992. He remained in the position for nine years, retiring at the end of 2000.

George L. Vogt, a former president of the American Association for State and Local History was appointed as the eighth Executive Director of OHS in November 2006. In July 2007, the Oregon Historical Society was awarded a $2.8 million biennial appropriation from the State of Oregon, though the organization is not a state entity. The $2.8 million given by the state over the two years equals 30% of the annual operating budget. In 2011, Vogt retired and was replaced by Kerry Tymchuk, who was named permanent director in October 2011. The Society sold the Sovereign Hotel in 2014.

==Funding==
In November 2010, Multnomah County voters approved a ballot initiative that included a five-year property tax levy to fund the institution and grant county residents free admission to the museum and research library. In 2011, the Oregon Legislative Assembly approved $2.5 million to assist the Society in paying off the mortgage on its temperature-controlled warehouse that preserves and protects the Society&#x27;s artifacts, maps, books, films, and other assets. At the end of 2011, the Society received a $2 million bequest from the late Fred Fields, a noted businessman and philanthropist in Oregon.

==Divisions==

The Society&#x27;s museum, archives and research library contains approximately 8.5 million feet of film and videotape, over 2.5 million photographs, 85,000 artifacts, 30,000 books, 25,000 maps, 16,000 rolls of microfilm, of documents, and oral history preserved in more than 8,400 hours of recordings covering over 2,100 interviews. The society has one of the largest collections of historic photographs in the United States.

OHS has published the &quot;Oregon Historical Quarterly&quot; continuously since 1900. Since 1929, the Oregon Historical Society Press has published over 150 books on Oregon history, politics, culture, and biographies, including &quot;Oregon Geographic Names&quot;. As of 2009, the press has suspended operations. University of Washington Press is handling all distribution of OHS Press books still in print. Publication of the &quot;Oregon Historical Quarterly&quot; will continue.

The OHS Museum Store is located in the lobby of the National Register of Historic Places-designated Sovereign Hotel. The building was added to the register in 1981.
From 1986 to 2001, the Society used the former Meier &amp; Frank Delivery Depot, in the Pearl District, to house its collection (except items on display at the museum at any given time) and for processing of new acquisitions. In 2000, after property values began rising due to redevelopment in the Pearl that started in the late 1990s, the Society sold that building, for $12.7 million. It moved its storage and processing to a warehouse in suburban Gresham over a four-month period in the first half of 2001. The Gresham warehouse was less conveniently located but had cost only $3.2 million to purchase, although modifications to that building were expected to raise the overall cost of the move to about $6 million.

==Legacy==
Noting that the four successive presidents after Harvey Scott were attorneys, historian E. Kimbark MacColl stated:

young Portland lawyers at the turn of the [20th] century ... rose to civic prominence, ... became actively involved in the Oregon Historical Society, and ... were instrumental in fabricating an &quot;Oregon Story&quot; that was heavily laden with mythology, hero worship and pioneer idolization. [Charles H.] Carey, Scott, and others, constituted a group of politician-writers who advised: Don&#x27;t hurt the party. Don&#x27;t divide up America into classes by denouncing the rich and exciting &quot;the envy and hatred of the poor.&quot; Spare the city&#x27;s reputation. ... Carey and Scott would never admit they had made mistakes or that the old system was rotten.

<doc id="1220522" wikidata="Q1149060" url="?curid=1220522" title="Smyth Report">
<text>The Smyth Report (officially Atomic Energy for Military Purposes) is the common name of an administrative history written by American physicist Henry DeWolf Smyth about the Manhattan Project, the Allied effort to develop atomic bombs during World War II. The subtitle of the report is A General Account of the Development of Methods of Using Atomic Energy for Military Purposes. It was released to the public on August 12, 1945, just days after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9.

Smyth was commissioned to write the report by Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project. The Smyth Report was the first official account of the development of the atomic bombs and the basic physical processes behind them. It also served as an indication as to what information was declassified; anything in the Smyth Report could be discussed openly. For this reason, the Smyth Report focused heavily on information, such as basic nuclear physics, which was either already widely known in the scientific community or easily deducible by a competent scientist, and omitted details about chemistry, metallurgy, and ordnance. This would ultimately give a false impression that the Manhattan Project was all about physics.

The Smyth Report sold almost 127,000 copies in its first eight printings, and was on &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-seller list from mid-October 1945 until late January 1946. It has been translated into over 40 languages.

== Background ==
Henry D. Smyth was a professor of physics and chairman of the physics department of Princeton University from 1935 to 1949. During World War II, he was involved in the Manhattan Project from early 1941, initially as a member of the National Defense Research Committee&#x27;s Committee on Uranium, and later as an associate director of the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. In late 1943, the President of Princeton University, Harold W. Dodds, began insisting that Smyth work part-time at Princeton, where there was a shortage of physicists because so many of them were engaged in war work. Princeton had commitments to teach army and navy personnel, and he needed physicists like Smyth to meet those commitments. Smyth therefore became a consultant at Chicago, where he was in charge of designing a nuclear reactor that used heavy water as a neutron moderator, and commuted from Princeton, working in Chicago on alternate weeks.

In early 1944, Smyth raised the possibility of producing an unclassified report for the general public on the achievements of the Manhattan Project. The director of the Metallurgical Laboratory, Arthur Compton, supported the idea. He arranged a meeting with James B. Conant, the President of Harvard University and one of the senior administrators of the Manhattan Project, who had similar thoughts. Conant took up the matter with the Manhattan Project&#x27;s director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr. In April, Smyth received a formal letter from Groves asking him to write such a report. Both the report and the choice of Smyth as its author were approved by the Manhattan Project&#x27;s governing body, the Military Policy Committee, in May 1944.

The Report was to serve two functions. First, it was to be the public and official U.S. government account of the development of the atomic bombs, outlining the development of the then-secret laboratories and production sites at Los Alamos, New Mexico, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington, and the basic physical processes responsible for the functioning of nuclear weapons, in particular nuclear fission and the nuclear chain reaction. Second, it served as a reference for other scientists as to what information was declassified—anything said in the Smyth Report could be said freely in open literature. For this reason, the Smyth Report focused heavily on information already available in declassified literature, such as much of the basic nuclear physics used in weapons, which was either already widely known in the scientific community or could have been easily deduced by a competent scientist.

Smyth stated the purpose of the Smyth Report in the Preface:
This contrasted somewhat with what Groves wrote in the foreword:

== Writing ==

Smyth possessed security clearances necessary to visit project sites, access documents and to discuss the work with the research personnel. Groves approved Smyth&#x27;s request to hire another Princeton physicist, Lincoln G. Smith, as a research assistant. A letter to the Manhattan Project&#x27;s senior managers, Kenneth Nichols, Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence, Harold Urey, and Franklin Matthias, explained:

Since Smyth still had his commitments at Princeton and Chicago, he could only work on the report part-time. He wrote the report in his office in Princeton&#x27;s Palmer Laboratory. Bars were installed on the windows of Smyth&#x27;s office and the one adjacent to it. The hallway door to his office was locked and blocked by a large safe so that the only access was through the adjacent office, where there was an armed guard. The guards worked in eight-hour shifts, and one was present around the clock. When Smyth sent papers to Groves in Washington, D.C., they went by military courier.

Smyth sent an outline and rough draft of the report to Groves for approval in August 1944, followed in February 1945 by drafts of the first twelve chapters, leaving only the final chapter to be completed. Groves and Conant reviewed the drafts, and made several criticisms. They felt that it was too technical for general readers, did not mention the names of enough participants, and dwelt too much on the activities at the Los Alamos Laboratory. Groves was particularly anxious that deserving people be mentioned, as he felt that this would lessen the danger of security breaches. After Smyth made a series of changes in response to this, Groves sent the manuscript to his scientific adviser, Richard Tolman. Tolman was assisted by two physicists who were working in his office at the National Defense Research Committee as technical aides, Paul C. Fine from the University of Texas, and William Shurcliff from Harvard University. They had the dual task of editing and censoring the manuscript.

Smyth and Tolman accepted a set of criteria, agreeing that information could be released under the conditions: 

Writing to Oppenheimer in April 1945, Smyth noted that 
Tolman and his assistants finished making their changes in July 1945, and Groves had copies sent out by courier to selected personnel. Each submitted a written report, which was returned with the courier and the manuscript. These were busy people who sometimes only had a few days or even hours to look at the manuscript. Many, but not all, merely signed a statement saying that they were happy with it. Nichols, the commander of the Manhattan District, sent back a detailed review. He had concerns about the amount of credit being given to different people and organizations, and recommended that &quot;full credit be given to H. D. Smyth for preparing it and that the statement be made that the Army has no responsibility for the report except for asking him to do it.&quot; Smyth was given credit, but no such statement was issued. To prepare the final draft for the printer, Groves brought typists with the required security clearances to Washington, D.C., from the Manhattan District&#x27;s headquarters in Oak Ridge.

Because the Manhattan Project was an Allied endeavor, Groves had to obtain permission from the British and American governments to publish the Smyth Report. A meeting was held on August 2, 1945, in the office of the Secretary of War, Henry Stimson. Accompanying Stimson were his two assistants, Harvey Bundy and George L. Harrison, and his military aide, Colonel William H. Kyle. Groves, Conant, and Tolman represented the Manhattan Project. James Chadwick, the head of the British scientific mission to the Manhattan Project, and Roger Makins from the British Embassy represented Britain. The meeting went on for two hours, as Groves and Conant sought to reassure Stimson that the report would not give vital secrets away to the Soviet Union.

For his part, Chadwick, who had not yet read the manuscript, could not fathom why the Americans wanted to publish such a document. When he did read it, he became quite alarmed. His concerns were addressed in a meeting with Groves and Conant, and he accepted their point of view. &quot;I am now convinced,&quot; he wrote, &quot;that the very special circumstances arising from the nature of the project, and of its organization, demand special treatment, and a report of this kind may well be necessary to maintain security of the really essential facts of the project.&quot;

== Publication ==
A thousand copies of the report were printed by lithography at the Pentagon, and deposited in Groves&#x27;s office in the New War Department Building in Washington, D.C., where they were kept securely locked away. Final approval was sought from the President, Harry S. Truman, in a meeting at the White House on August 9, 1945, three days after the bombing of Hiroshima. Stimson, Harrison, Groves, Conant, Vannevar Bush, and Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy presented their views, and Truman authorized the immediate release of the report. The War Department released the thousand copies of the report that had been kept in Groves&#x27;s office to the media for use by the radio broadcasters with an embargo time of 9:00 pm on August 11, 1945, and for the newspapers of August 12.
The original title of the report, before it was published in book form, was &quot;Nuclear Bombs: A General Account of the Development of Methods of Using Nuclear Energy for Military Purposes Under the Auspices of the United States Government, 1940–1945&quot;. The word &quot;nuclear&quot; was changed to &quot;atomic&quot; because while the former was favored by physicists, it was not in common use by the general public at that time. This was the title used on the copyright certificate. The book was copyrighted to Smyth but issued with the statement that &quot;reproduction in whole or in part is authorized and permitted&quot;. Groves had the report copyrighted by Smyth in order to prevent someone else from copyrighting it.

Groves was concerned about the security implications of the title, so instead of having &quot;Atomic Bombs&quot; on the cover, it was left blank, and a rubber stamp was made. The intention was for this to be used on each copy before it was distributed. This was done for the copyright deposit copies, but not those given to the press or the public. The lumbering subtitle therefore became the title. A side effect of this was that it became generally known as the &quot;Smyth Report&quot;. Over the years, the term &quot;nuclear&quot; gradually gained traction, and by 1960 it had become more common than &quot;atomic&quot;.

In mid-1945, Smyth approached Datus C. Smith, the director of Princeton University Press, about the possibility of renting his printing plant to the government during a two-week summer shutdown so that Smyth could produce 5,000 copies of a top secret report. Smith&#x27;s response was that he found it hard to imagine anyone needing to print 5,000 copies of a top secret report. He found it much easier to imagine delays due to unexpected printing problems, and his workers returning from summer vacation to find themselves locked out of a plant filled with top secret material. Under the circumstances, he felt that he could not risk this.

After the Smyth Report was officially released, Smith immediately offered to publish it. Smyth patiently explained that anyone was free to publish it, but Princeton University Press was only willing to do so on the understanding that this would be &quot;Smyth&#x27;s edition&quot;. Meanwhile, Smyth approached McGraw-Hill about publishing it. The editors at McGraw-Hill found the manuscript dull and somewhat technical for a general audience and suggested a rewrite. Smyth balked at this, as it would have meant going through the censorship process again. James S. Thompson, the president of McGraw-Hill, pointed out the U.S. Government Printing Office would be putting out an edition, probably more cheaply than he could, and there would likely be little profit in a McGraw-Hill edition. Smyth then turned back to Princeton University Press. He had only one condition: that he receive no royalties. Princeton University Press agreed, but added a stipulation of its own: that Groves&#x27;s approval be secured. Smyth obtained this in a letter dated August 25, 1945.
Princeton University Press received a copy of the typescript lithograph edition with hand corrections from Smyth on August 17, 1945. The typographers had already started work from another copy. Maple Press of York, Pennsylvania, was lined up to do the printing. Because of wartime shortages, one of a publisher&#x27;s biggest worries was finding adequate supplies of paper. Smith approached Manny and Leonard Relles from Central Paper, told them about the Smyth Report and its significance, and asked them if they could deliver of paper to Maple Press in twelve days. They found a carload of paper on a siding in New England and sent it to York, providing enough paper for 30,000 copies, only half what Princeton University Press wanted. The first edition of 30,000 copies was printing when word was received that paper had been found for another 30,000 copies. The presses were held for three hours while the train made its way to a siding in York, where the paper was unloaded and brought to the printing plant by trucks.

There were minor differences between the original text and the version published by Princeton. In the Princeton publication, first and middle names were added instead of the previous use of abbreviations. In response to public concerns about radioactivity, Groves had text added to paragraph 12.18 explaining how the height of the explosions over Hiroshima and Nagasaki reduced fallout and allowed fission products to be drawn up into the upper atmosphere. He also had a one-sentence allusion to a poisoning effect of fission products in the production reactors redacted.

Later editions also incorporated changes. Four typographical errors were found, and the word &quot;photon&quot; in paragraph 1.44 aroused so much correspondence from readers who mistakenly believed that it should be &quot;proton&quot; that it was decided to re-word the paragraph. The British government became concerned that the Smyth Report did not cover the British part in the project, and issued its own 40-page report, which was incorporated into the fifth printing in November 1945 as Appendix 7. A two-page report by the Canadian government was added as Appendix 8.

The Smyth Report was translated into over 40 different languages. In addition to Princeton University Press, it was also published by the Government Printing Office, the &quot;Infantry Journal&quot;, and His Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office, and was reprinted in the October 1945 issue of &quot;Reviews of Modern Physics&quot;.

== Reception ==
The first copies were delivered to bookstores on September 10. Many were wary of it, due to its technical nature, and feared that sales would be low. An exception was Scribner&#x27;s Bookstores, which placed large early orders. At Oak Ridge, the Manhattan Project&#x27;s major production site, 8,000 copies were sold through the employee welfare organization. Similar arrangements were made for Los Alamos and Richland, Washington, which were located in areas where bookstores were scarce.

The Smyth Report was on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list from October 14, 1945, until January 20, 1946. Between 1946 and when the Smyth Report went out of print in 1973, it went through eight printings, and Princeton University Press sold 62,612 paperback and 64,129 hardback copies.

Groves did not intend the Smyth Report to be the last word on the project. It formed an addendum to the &quot;Manhattan District History&quot;, the official history of the project. This eventually consisted of 35 volumes with 39 appendices or supplements. It was written in the immediate postwar years by the chemists, metallurgists, physicists, and administrators who had worked on the project. Since there were no security restrictions, it covered every aspect of the Manhattan Project, but was itself classified. Most of it was declassified in the 1960s and 1970s and became available to scholars, except for some technical details on the construction of the bombs.

In her 2008 PhD dissertation, Rebecca Schwartz argued that Smyth&#x27;s academic background and the Smyth Report&#x27;s security-driven focus on physics at the expense of chemistry, metallurgy, and ordnance promoted a public perception of the Manhattan Project as primarily the achievement of physics and physicists. According to Schwartz, postwar histories and popular writing tended to follow the Smyth Report in this regard, creating a lasting historiographical legacy. &quot;Ever since&quot;, wrote Jon Agar, &quot;the atomic bomb has been seen as an achievement of physics.&quot; In particular, the prominence given to Einstein&#x27;s mass–energy equivalence equation indelibly associated it with the Manhattan Project. The Smyth Report, wrote Robert P. Crease, &quot;more than any other single document made an emblem of atomic energy and weaponry.&quot;

Groves felt that:
==Russian translation==
The Soviet Union, eager to make progress on its own atomic weapon development and determined to follow the path that the Manhattan Project had found success with, commissioned a Russian translation of &quot;Atomic Energy for Military Purposes&quot;. It was in typeset form by mid-November 1945, and then was published by the State Railway Transportation Publishing House on January 30, 1946. Some 30,000 copies were printed and it was widely distributed to the many scientists and engineers working in the Soviet effort.

In a number of cases, the Soviets consulted the Smyth Report to see how they might deal with certain obstacles that had arisen in their project. The deletion between the original text and the Princeton version concerning the poisoning effect was soon noticed by the Russian translators, and only served to highlight its importance to the Soviet project.

As pioneering French nuclear weapons scientist Bertrand Goldschmidt later said,

Nonetheless, Goldschmidt believed, just as Chadwick had ultimately believed, that publication of the report was on balance wise, in that not revealing anything about the new weapon would lead to a public hunger for information and resultant leaks and unwarranted disclosures of information.

Not everyone would agree: in 1947, United States Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss would call publication of the Smyth Report &quot;a serious breach of security&quot;; and in late 1952, President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower would say the Smyth Report had given away too much information, including the exact locations of the atomic materials production plants.

<text>Sir Alfred Gilbert (12 August 18544 November 1934) was an English sculptor. He was born in London and studied sculpture under Joseph Boehm, Matthew Noble, Édouard Lantéri and Pierre-Jules Cavelier. His first work of importance was &quot;The Kiss of Victory&quot;, followed by the trilogy of &quot;Perseus Arming&quot;, &quot;Icarus&quot; and &quot;Comedy and Tragedy&quot;. His most creative years were from the late 1880s to the mid-1890s, when he produced several celebrated works such as a memorial for the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria and the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain Eros on Piccadilly Circus.

As well as sculpture, Gilbert explored other techniques such as goldsmithing and damascening. He painted watercolours and drew book illustrations. He was made a member of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1892, yet his personal life was beginning to unravel as he took on too many commissions and entered into debt, whilst at the same time his wife&#x27;s mental health deteriorated. Gilbert received a royal commission for the tomb of Prince Albert Victor in 1892, but was unable to finish it and the number of complaints from other dissatisfied clients grew. By the mid-1900s, Gilbert had been forced to declare himself bankrupt and to resign from the Royal Academy. He moved to Bruges in disgrace and separated from his wife. He later remarried, entering a period when he created few artworks.

In the 1920s, his career was rehabilitated with the help of journalist Isabel McAllister. He returned to England and finally completed the tomb of Prince Albert Victor, as well as taking on new commissions such as the Queen Alexandra Memorial. In 1932, Gilbert was reinstated as a member of the Royal Academy and was also knighted. He died in 1934, at the age of 80. Gilbert was a central inspiration for the New Sculpture movement and in the 21st-century is regarded as one of the foremost sculptors of the Victorian age.

==Early life==
Alfred Gilbert was born 12 August 1854 at 13 Berners Street, near Oxford Street in central London. He was the eldest child of Charlotte Cole and Alfred Gilbert, who were both musicians. Berners Street was at that time an area popular with artists and musicians: there were shops selling stained glass, carvings, printings and bronze artworks; Ford Madox Brown and Edward Hodges Baily had studios; Leigh&#x27;s Academy (run by James Mathews Leigh) was nearby, later becoming the Thomas J. Heatherley School of Art. Gilbert first attended William Kemshead&#x27;s Academy for a few months in 1863, which was a naval school near Portsmouth. He then went to the Mercers&#x27; School in the City of London, afterwards switching to Aldenham School in Hertfordshire, where his father taught music. Gilbert later commented that &quot;I always hated school&quot;. He enjoyed more spending time with his paternal grandfather, who taught him how to woodwork. At Aldenham, Gilbert began to make portraits of his schoolfellows with clay he took from ditches and the headmaster Alfred Leeman was encouraging, to the extent that Gilbert made a full-length seated portrait of him in 1872.

Gilbert&#x27;s father pushed him to become a surgeon, so he applied to the Royal College of Surgeons and was accepted in 1872. He then went for a scholarship at Middlesex Hospital to work as a surgeon and was rejected, allowing him to pursue his true interest of sculpture. Studying first at the Thomas J. Heatherley School from 1872 until 1873, afterwards he went to the Royal Academy Schools from 1873 until 1875. His fellow students included Frank Dicksee, Johnston Forbes-Robertson, John Macallan Swan, Hamo Thornycroft and J. W. Waterhouse. Eager to learn, he also worked in the studios of Sir Joseph Boehm, Matthew Noble, and William Gibbs Rogers. Gilbert later credited Boehm and his assistant Édouard Lantéri as his true teachers.

Gilbert travelled to Paris to study at the École des Beaux-Arts under Pierre-Jules Cavelier. He had fallen in love with his first cousin, Alice Jane Gilbert, and they were forced to elope. In Paris they lived first at the Hôtel l&#x27;Artesian at Place de la Madeleine and then at 17 rue Humboldt. Gilbert returned to England in April 1878 to be at the deathbed of his younger brother Gordon, who succumbed to tuberculosis at the age of 20. Later that year, Gilbert moved to Rome with his wife and two young children. They lived at 63 Vicolo de&#x27;Miracoli, experiencing money problems as Gilbert waited to be paid for commissions whilst also having to pay rent. By 1881, Gilbert was splitting his time between a new studio space at 18 Via San Basilio in Rome and Capri. He returned to England in 1884.

==Career==
===Early works===

Gilbert&#x27;s first work of importance was &quot;The Kiss of Victory&quot; (1878–1881), which depicted a Roman soldier dying in the arms of Victory. He moved with his family to Rome in order to create the sculpture in marble, attracted by famed sculptors of the Renaissance such as Cellini, Donatello, Giambologna and Verrocchio. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1882. 

&quot;Perseus Arming&quot; (1882) was inspired by a visit to Florence and influenced by Donatello&#x27;s &quot;David&quot; and Cellini&#x27;s &quot;Perseus with the Head of Medusa&quot;. It was Gilbert&#x27;s first statue made in bronze. The work was acclaimed and led Frederic Leighton to commission &quot;Icarus&quot; (1884), which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1884, along with &quot;Study of a Head&quot; (1882–83). Gilbert also created &quot;The Enchanted Chair&quot; (), only to destroy it again. He was commissioned by the Baroness von Fahnenberg to design a mausoleum in Spa, Belgium, Belgium but she died without having signed a final agreement, leading him to sue for compensation.

Gilbert later stated to Joseph Hatton that the bronze statues &quot;Perseus Arming&quot;, &quot;Icarus&quot; and &quot;Comedy and Tragedy&quot; (1891–92) formed a trilogy which referenced his own life. &quot;Perseus Arming&quot; had a huge impact on a new generation of artists, becoming a particular inspiration for the New Sculpture movement, since the method of casting (lost wax) was new to the English milieu and its height of 29 inches was innovative. It was larger than a bibelot, which might decorate a drawing room, yet smaller than a typical sculpture.

===Creative period===
Having returned to England, Gilbert took a studio in a complex off Fulham Road, where he built a foundry with Thomas Stirling Lee and Edward Onslow Ford. His next major work was again an innovation in terms of size; the Fawcett memorial (1885–87) featured a bronze bust of politician Henry Fawcett above seven small detailed figures of around fifteen inches, which individually represented Fawcett&#x27;s virtues. The memorial received praise from critics when it was unveiled at Westminster Abbey on 29 January 1887. By then Gilbert had been commissioned to produce another memorial, this time for Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria, which was placed in the Great Hall at Winchester Castle. From the late 1880s to the mid-1890s he was in his most creative period. He diversified into goldsmithing and damascening, making an epergne (1887–1890) given to Queen Victoria by officers of the British Army and a chain for the mayor of Preston (1888–1892). Gilbert produced medals, such as the cast bronze portrait of Matthew Ridley Corbet (1881) and the struck bronze medal marking 50 years of the Art Union of London (1887). He also created spoons, cups, dishes and jewellery; many of his designs can be seen in the collection of Stichting van Caloen on display at Loppem Castle in Belgium. Marion Spielmann, a contemporary art critic, wrote in 1901 &quot;his taste is so pure, his genius so exquisitely right, that he may give full rein to his fancy without danger where another man would run riot and come to grief&quot;.
Gilbert&#x27;s next work of note was the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain (1886–1893). The philanthropist Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, had died in late 1885 and it was swiftly decided to commemorate his life with two monuments, one at Westminster Abbey and another at Cambridge Circus, at the beginning of Shaftesbury Avenue (which was concurrently named after him). The memorial was commissioned in 1886 and officially opened at Piccadilly Circus in London in 1893. Gilbert had accepted the commission with assurances that he would be given used gunmetal to melt down and reuse, however the government did not supply him with it. He had already produced the casts, so he was forced to buy copper to use instead, which meant that he took a substantial financial hit; the fountain should have cost and in the end the figure was , with Gilbert being forced to make up the difference. It was only because he had been experimenting with different techniques that he was able to cast aluminium, a then new material which he used to create the statue which topped the sculpture. It is commonly believed that the statue depicts Eros, but it is actually his brother Anteros, the avenger of unrequited love. The fountain is now well-regarded and seen as a national treasure, but at the time it was controversial, with opinions on its value mixed. The mainstream media criticised the design of the fountain which led to passing flower girls being drenched in water and hooliganism meant it needed to be guarded for a year. Eight drinking cups on chains had been provided for pedestrians to quench their thirst and Gilbert stated that just one day after the opening, only two cups remained. He referred to the &quot;painful experience of witnessing the utter failure of my intention and design&quot;.

In this period, Gilbert made statues of Donald Mackay, 11th Lord Reay, and prison reformer John Howard. He produced memorials of the Duke of Clarence and of Lord Arthur Russell, and a memorial font for the son of the 4th Marquess of Bath. He produced busts of Cyril Flower, John R. Clayton (later broken up by the artist), George Frederic Watts, Henry Tate, George Birdwood, Richard Owen and George Grove. He also designed the statue of David Davies of Llandinam which stands in front of the Barry Docks offices.

Gilbert was made a member of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1892. He received many other honours, such as Royal Victorian Order of the fourth class (1897). He became a member of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers and in 1889 he won the Grand Prix at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. By the time of Boehm&#x27;s death in 1890, Gilbert had become England&#x27;s best known living sculptor. He was a member of the Athenaeum and Garrick clubs in London and was a well-known figure with his cape, sombrero and walking-stick. His friends included the artists Watts, Edward Burne-Jones, Frederic Leighton and James Abbott McNeill Whistler. Befriending Princess Louise had brought him into high society and he built a large house for his family with an attached studio in 16 Maida Vale, in north London. Gilbert&#x27;s generous and extravagant lifestyle was leading him into debt and as his fame grew, his private life began to fall apart. His wife Alice was not at ease in London society and preferred to stay in a rented house in Gomshall, Surrey; soon after the unveiling of the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain, she had a breakdown and was committed to an asylum. Without Boehm to advise him, Gilbert found it difficult to track his commissions. He almost never drew up contracts with clients and it was easy for disagreements to arise.
In 1892, Gilbert was asked by the Prince (later Edward VII) and Princess of Wales (Alexandra of Denmark) to build the tomb for their recently deceased eldest son Prince Albert Victor in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor. Prince Albert Victor had been heir to the throne and died of pneumonia resulting from contracting influenza during the 1889–1890 flu pandemic. The tomb has been described by a critic as &quot;the finest single example of late 19th-century sculpture in the British Isles&quot;. A recumbent effigy of the prince wearing a Hussar uniform lies above the tomb. Kneeling over him is an angel, holding a heavenly crown. The tomb is surrounded by an elaborate railing, with figures of saints. The perfectionist Gilbert spent too much time and money on the commission. Five of the saint figures were only completed with &quot;a greater roughness and pittedness of texture&quot; after his return to Britain in the 1920s.

Another 1892 commission which Gilbert struggled with was the &quot;Memorial Tablet to Edward Robert Bulwer-Lytton, First Earl of Lytton&quot; (1892–1902). Lady Lytton wished to remember her husband the politician Edward Bulwer-Lytton with a plaque in the crypt of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Having taken on the work, Gilbert never supplied the plaque, despite her frequent visits to his studio. Instead, she was forced to buy the bronze cast at a bankruptcy sale and to ask Edwin Lutyens (her son-in-law) to make a surrounding mould before it was eventually installed at St Paul&#x27;s in 1903.

===Disgrace===
By 1898, Gilbert was in debt and the number of complaints from clients asking for completed works was increasing. Instead of finishing the tomb for Prince Albert Victor, which only had seven of the twelve saints around it, Gilbert took another royal commission, namely building the mortuary chapel for Prince Henry of Battenberg. Ultimately, Gilbert was forced to file for bankruptcy in 1901. He sent his family before him to Bruges in Belgium and stayed behind to pack up his studio, destroying many casts in the process.

Edward VII offered Gilbert a studio at Windsor Castle where he could complete the tomb project but Gilbert only compounded his problems by asking the royal family for permission to publish photographs of the work in progress in &quot;The Art Journal&quot; and then proceeding to do so even though he was explicitly asked not to. To make matters worse, the photographs depicted the ivory and bronze statues which had been originally attached to the tomb and subsequently sold off by Gilbert in 1899. They had been replaced by the bronze casts which still sit on the tomb, but the king had paid for the originals and was angered, breaking off all communication with Gilbert.

By the mid-1900s, Gilbert was in serious problems. In 1904, he had separated from his wife. Dissatisfied clients had spoken to a gossip magazine called &quot;Truth&quot;, which released two well-circulated critical articles in 1906. The Duke of Rutland was driven to complain to the president of the Royal Academy (Edward Poynter) about an uncompleted order in 1908 and Gilbert was given the choice either to resign or to be expelled from the Academy. Poynter commented &quot;We have all come to the regretful conclusion that he is hopelessly incorrigible&quot;. Gilbert decided to quit, resigning his professorship and also his Royal Victorian Order. Things deteriorated further when he had an affair with a client, Eliza Macloghlin, and she demanded to have the funeral urn she had commissioned, &quot;Mr and Mrs Percy Plantagenet Macloghlin&quot; (1905–1909), also known as &quot;Mors Janua Vitae&quot;. Upon not receiving it, she threw stones at the windows of his studio in Bruges and wrote a demented letter to King Edward VII. Her handwriting was similar to Gilbert&#x27;s and it was believed he had written the screed, making his situation even more dire. When his son Francis went to see Gilbert in 1908, he found him hungry and lacking adequate clothes. In this period, Gilbert completed few works. He was able to finish &quot;A Dream of Joy during a Sleep of Sorrow&quot; (1908–1913), a bronze chimney piece commissioned by the Wilson family for their home in Leeds, yet instead of supplying an inset portrait of Mrs Wilson as requested, he included a watercolour painting of his second wife, Stéphanie Quaghebeur.

===Rehabilitation===

During World War I, Gilbert remained in Bruges. The three illustrations for Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s short story &quot;His Last Bow. The War Service of Sherlock Holmes&quot; published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in 1917 and in 1921 three more for &quot;The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone&quot;. were not, as has been previously believed, by Alfred Gilbert. They were the work of his contemporary, the oil painter, Albert Thomas Gilbert. Alfred married his housekeeper Stéphanie Quaghebeur on 1 March 1918 and they moved to Rome together in 1924. In the early 1920s, Gilbert had been largely forgotten in England and was assumed to have died, since he had fled to Europe decades before. However, he was still receiving a civil list pension and when the journalist Isabel McAllister took an interest in him, she was able to easily find him.

McAllister was a fan, commenting in 1932 &quot;One must be entirely loyal to him, and never admit faults to those who ... are always ready to look out for them&quot;. She decided to write his biography and campaigned for his re-acceptance in English high society. Writing to King George V and various dignitaries, she promoted Gilbert&#x27;s talents, arguing it was time for him to finish the tomb of Prince Albert Victor and also that he was the perfect person to take the commission to create a memorial to Queen Alexandra, who had died in 1925. The King was glad to hear news of his old acquaintance and Lady Helena Gleichen became Gilbert&#x27;s promoter, offering use of her studio at St James Palace if the funds could be raised to bring him from Italy.

Gilbert returned to England on 26 July 1926 and his mental state concerned Helena Gleichen; she said he was &quot;broken with nerves, and agitation&quot;. Friends rallied around him and Gilbert settled down. The King provided a stipend and Gilbert was permitted to use studios at St James&#x27;s Palace and later Kensington Palace. By March 1928 he had finally finished the five statues which completed the tomb of Prince Albert Victor (George&#x27;s older brother). In late 1926 Gilbert had won the commission to make the Queen Alexandra Memorial. This captured his imagination since he saw the major public artwork as his swan song. Furthermore, Alexandra had been a firm friend of his, supporting him financially even when he failed to complete the tomb of her eldest son. After he had fled England for the second time, she commissioned a portrait from him in 1903 (it is unknown if it was ever completed). In 1904 she sent him .

The sculpted fountain of the memorial blended art nouveau and gothic styles, and was built into the wall of Marlborough House. It was officially unveiled on 8 June 1932, which was announced as Alexandra Rose Day. It depicts three figures representing Faith, Hope, and Charity who are helping a maiden move across the stream of life. Gilbert was knighted the day afterwards and was also readmitted into the Royal Academy. His return to favour was complete.

==Personal life==

On 3 January 1876, Gilbert eloped to Paris with his first cousin, Alice Jane Gilbert (1847–1916), and they were married the same day. They had five children: George (born 9 May 1876), Mary (born 1877), Francis (born 1879), Alfredo (born 1880) and Charlotte Emily (born 1881). Charlotte was to become a notable suffragette under the name Caprina Fahey.

Gilbert&#x27;s wife Alice had a breakdown soon after the official opening of the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain in 1893 and spent time in a mental asylum. The family left England again in 1901 and settled in Bruges. The marriage broke down in 1904 and Alice was hospitalised again. She died in 1916. Gilbert remarried in 1918 with his housekeeper Stéphanie Quaghebeur, by which time he had already taken on responsibility for helping to raise her seven children from a previous marriage. They had stopped living together by 1926, with Quaghebeur remaining in Belgium when Gilbert moved back to England again, although he sent her monthly cheques to support the family until his death. At the end of his life, Gilbert was romantically linked with Georgina Becket Terrell.

==Death and legacy==
Gilbert died on 4 November 1934 at Cromwell Nursing Home in London. He had long been sick and refusing to eat. He was then cremated. At the time of his death, Gilbert was one of the most well-known figures in English society and there were plans to make a film about him. He was then disregarded for decades, until critic Richard Dorment published a biography of Gilbert in 1985, which was followed by a retrospective at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1986. Gilbert is now regarded as one of the foremost sculptors of the Victorian age.

In 2017, a bust of Queen Victoria by Gilbert worth £1.2 million was subject to an export ban, having been sold at Sotheby&#x27;s to a museum based in New York. Eventually, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge raised the funds to pay £1.01 million to keep the bust in the UK. The work of art was deemed to meet all three of the Waverley Criteria, namely that it was of national artistic importance, it was of outstanding aesthetic value and it was vital for the study of sculpture. The sum was raised through donations and a £267,600 grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund (NHMF).

<text>Walter Scott MacFarlane (1896–1979) was a Canadian soldier and bard who composed poetry and songs exploring faith, love, war and peace, the loss of comrades and loved ones and his love of Cape Breton. He was known as the &quot;Bard of Margaree.&quot;

He was born near the Margaree River of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada and lived in Inverness in his later life. He wrote songs and poetry in both Scottish Gaelic and English, although many of the Gaelic works have been lost. He fought in both World Wars, including the Battle of Vimy Ridge and this combined with his strong religious faith, is evident in much of his poetry. A collection of his work, entitled &quot;Songs of the Valley&quot; edited by Kay MacDonald and his son Pat MacFarlane was published in the 1980s.

Walter Scott MacFarlane was the grandfather of Canadian musicians Scott MacFarlane (Bassist - Sandbox, Crush, Kilt) and Kris MacFarlane (Drummer - Great Big Sea, Alan Doyle, Spirit of the West).

<text>John Bernard Croak VC (May 18, 1892 – August 8, 1918) was a soldier in the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War and posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He earned the award for events that occurred during the Battle of Amiens in August 1918. A park and elementary school was named in his memory at Glace Bay, Nova Scotia.

==Early life==
Croak was born in Little Bay in Newfoundland, on May 18, 1892, to James and Cecelia Croak. The family moved to Glace Bay, Nova Scotia when Croak was two years old. He attended school there and then, at the age of 14, began work as a coal miner.

==First World War==
In 1915, Croak enlisted in the Canadian Army and volunteered for service abroad with the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Posted to the 55th Battalion as a private, he embarked for Europe in November 1915. He soon transferred to the 13th Battalion, which was serving on the Western Front as part of 3rd Brigade, 1st Canadian Division. Through 1917 and the early part of 1918, Croak participated in several engagements as part of 13th Battalion; these included the Battles of Vimy Ridge, Hill 70 and Passchendaele. 
On 8 August 1918, the opening day of the Battle of Amiens, and the beginning of the Hundred Days Offensive, the 3rd Brigade, accompanied by a battalion of tanks, was at the forefront of the 1st Division&#x27;s advance. The 13th Battalion became held up by machine gun posts in the vicinity of Hangard Wood. Croak attacked a machine gun post and took several prisoners whom he escorted to his company headquarters. Ignoring instructions to seek medical treatment for a wound to his arm, he carried out an attack on another machine gun post nearby. He was wounded again, this time fatally, in the act, and died that same day. He was recognised for his actions with an award of the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for Croak&#x27;s VC read:

Croak is buried at Hangard Wood British Cemetery, which is located 12 miles south west of Albert. His VC, the first to be awarded to a soldier born in Newfoundland, was presented to his mother at Government House in Halifax by MacCallum Grant, the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, on 23 November 1918.

In Glace Bay, where Croak grew up, there is both a school and a Royal Canadian Legion named in his honor. There is also a park, located on the site of his former workplace, the Dominion No. 2 Colliery, named for him as well. In 1992, the park was the scene of the unveiling of a memorial plaque, made of Cape Breton rock, to Croak.

==The medal==
In 1972 Croak&#x27;s medals, which included the British War Medal and the Victory Medal in addition to the VC, were gifted by his nephew to the Army Museum at the Citadel in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The medals are now displayed at the Canadian War Museum.

<text>Alexander Edwards VC (4 November 1885 – 24 March 1918) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for valour in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
Edwards was born in Stotfield, Lossiemouth, Morayshire, the son of a fisherman, and became a cooper working in the herring fishery.

On 1 September 1914 he joined the 6th (Morayshire) Battalion, the Seaforth Highlanders, a part of the 51st (Highland) Division. After training in Bedford, the battalion travelled to France in May 1915.

===VC action===
Edwards, now a sergeant, demonstrated tremendous bravery and was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions at the Battle of Pilckem Ridge on 31 July 1917 on the first day of the Battle of Passchendaele.

The &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 14 September 1917 recorded:
Returning to Britain, Edwards received his Victoria Cross from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 26 September 1917. A week later he attended a reception in his honour at Lossiemouth, where he was presented with a gold watch and war bonds. He later returned to France and rejoined the 6th Seaforth.

===Killed in action===
On 21 March 1918 the Germans began their &quot;Kaiserschlacht&quot; (Spring Offensive). On 24 March Edwards was wounded and posted missing in action, presumed killed, at Bapaume Wood, east of Arras, France.
No body was ever identified, and Serjeant Edwards is commemorated at Bay 8 on the Arras Memorial.

The Moray Firth Golf Links at Lossiemouth have a sundial memorial to Edwards and his cousin, Captain G.E. Edwards , who also died while serving with the 6th Seaforth during the war. As boys, both had acted as Caddies at the golf course.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Highlanders Museum in Fort George, Inverness-shire, Scotland.

<doc id="1220560" wikidata="Q4666404" url="?curid=1220560" title="Abe Kovnats">
<text>Abe Kovnats (March 22, 1928 in St. Boniface, Manitoba – March 6, 1996) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1977 to 1988, serving as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party.

== Early Life and career ==
The son of Michael Kovnats and Mary Silverman, he was educated at the University of Manitoba. Before entering political life, he ran a company in the parking business and worked as a referee in the Canadian Football League. In 1956, he married Donna Catherine Maloney.

== Political Career ==
Kovnats first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1973, losing to New Democrat Harry Shafransky in the riding of Radisson by about 600 votes. In the provincial election of 1977, he defeated Shafransky by about 800 votes as the Progressive Conservatives formed a majority government under Sterling Lyon. Kovnats was not called to become a member of cabinet, but was named Deputy Speaker in 1978.

In the 1981 provincial election, Kovnats was re-elected over NDP candidate Lloyd Schreyer by about 700 votes in the redistributed riding of Niakwa. In 1983, he supported Gary Filmon&#x27;s bid to become party leader.

He was an opponent of the legal retrenchment of French language services in Manitoba in 1984, and was re-elected with an increased majority in the 1986 provincial election.

Kovnats was defeated by Liberal candidate Herold Driedger in the 1988 provincial election, ironically as the Progressive Conservatives formed a minority government. Had he been re-elected, he probably would have served as a cabinet minister in the government of Gary Filmon. He did not seek a return to political life before his death in 1996.

== Death ==
Kovnats died at his winter home in Lady Lake, Florida at the age of 67.

== Honours ==
In 2013, he was inducted into the Football Manitoba Hall of Fame as an official.

<text>Alfred George Drake VC (10 December 1893 – 23 November 1915) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Drake was born in December 1893 in Mile End, Stepney, London to Robert and Mary Ann Drake. He was 21 years old, and a corporal in the 8th Battalion, The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own), British Army during the First World War, and was awarded the VC for his actions on 23 November 1915, near La Brique, Belgium. He was killed in his VC action.

A striking mirrored memorial sculpture to Alfred George Drake has been installed at Ben Jonson Primary School, Stepney in his memory. There is also a stone memorial plaque to him in nearby Shandy Park.

==Citation==
&quot;The London Gazette&quot; No. 29447, 21 January 1916

He was interred in La Brique No 2 Military cemetery near Ypres.

His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

The officer rescued by Corporal Drake was Lieutenant Henry Tryon, also of the Rifle Brigade. After Tryon recovered from his wounds, he returned to his former unit and was killed in action at Flers-Courcelette on 15 September 1916.

<text>Mithridatism is the practice of protecting oneself against a poison by gradually self-administering non-lethal amounts. The word is derived from Mithridates VI, the king of Pontus, who so feared being poisoned that he regularly ingested small doses, aiming to develop immunity.

==Background==
Mithridates VI&#x27;s father, Mithridates V, was assassinated by poisoning by a conspiracy among his attendants. After this, Mithridates VI&#x27;s mother held regency over Pontus (a Hellenistic kingdom, 281 BC–62 AD) until a male heir came of age. Mithridates was in competition with his brother for the throne and his mother began to favor his brother. Supposedly, during his youth, he began to suspect plots against him at his own mother&#x27;s orders and was aware of her possible connection with his father&#x27;s death. He then began to notice pains in his stomach during his meals and suspected his mother had ordered small amounts of poison to be added to his food to slowly kill him off. With other assassination attempts, he fled into the wild.

While in the wild, it is said that he began ingesting non-lethal amounts of poisons and mixing many into a universal remedy to make him immune to all known poisons.

After Mithridates&#x27; death, many Roman physicians claimed to possess and improve the formula. In keeping with most medical practices of his era, Mithridates&#x27; anti-poison routines included a religious component, supervised by the &quot;Agari&quot;, a group of Scythian shamans who never left him.

It has been suggested that Russian mystic Rasputin&#x27;s survival of a poisoning attempt was due to mithridatism, but this has not been proven.

Indian epics talk about this practice as well. It has been said that, during the rule of the king Chandragupta Maurya (320–298 BC), there was a practice of selecting beautiful girls and administering poison in small amounts until they grew up, thus making them insensitive to poison. These maidens were called &quot;vishakanyas&quot; (visha &#x27;poison&#x27; + kanya &#x27;maiden&#x27;). It was believed that engaging in sexual activities with vishakanyas could result in the death of their partners, due to the exchange of poisonous body fluids. Vishakanyas were employed to kill enemies.

The emperor Bindusara was the son of the first Mauryan emperor Chandragupta Maurya and his queen Durdhara. According to the &quot;Rajavalikatha&quot;, a Jain work, the original name of this emperor was Simhasena. A legend mentioned in the Jain texts tells the story of how Chandragupta&#x27;s Guru and advisor Chanakya used to feed the emperor with small doses of poison to build his immunity against possible poisoning attempts by his enemies. One day, Chandragupta, unaware that his food contained poison, shared his food with his pregnant wife, Queen Durdhara, who was seven days away from delivery. The queen, who was not immune to the poison, collapsed and died within a few minutes. Chanakya entered the room at the moment she collapsed, and in order to save the child in the womb, he immediately cut open the dead queen&#x27;s belly and took the baby out. He was just in time; a drop of poison had already reached the baby and touched his head, leaving a permanent blueish spot (a &quot;bindu&quot;) on his forehead. Thus, the newborn was named &quot;Bindusara&quot;.

==In practice==
Mithridatism is not effective against all types of poison. Immunity is generally only possible with biologically complex types which the immune system can respond to. Depending on the toxin, the practice can lead to the lethal accumulation of a poison in the body. Results depend on how each poison is processed by the body, i.e. on how the toxic compound is metabolized or passed out of the body. 

However, in some cases, it is possible to build up a metabolic tolerance against specific non-biological poisons. This involves conditioning the liver to produce more of the particular enzymes that metabolize these poisons. For example, heavy drinkers develop a tolerance to the effects of alcohol. However, metabolic tolerance can also lead to accumulation of the less toxic metabolized compound which can slowly damage the liver. With alcohol this generally leads to conditions such as alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Metabolic tolerance is not effective on all types of non-biological poisons. Exposure to certain toxic substances, such as hydrofluoric acid and heavy metals, is either lethal or has little to no effect. A minor exception is cyanide, which can be metabolized by the liver. The enzyme rhodanese converts the cyanide into the much less toxic thiocyanate. This process allows humans to ingest small amounts of cyanide in food like apple seeds and survive small amounts of cyanide gas from fires and cigarettes. However, one cannot effectively condition the liver against cyanide, unlike alcohol. Relatively larger amounts of cyanide are still highly lethal because, while the body can produce more rhodanese, the process also requires large amounts of sulfur-containing substrates.

==In literature==
Mithridatism has been used as a plot device in fiction and on-screen; including the Indian fantasy series &quot;Chandrakanta&quot;, Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, Holly Black&#x27;s &quot;The Cruel Prince&quot;, Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;Rappaccini&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, Yoshiaki Kawajiri&#x27;s &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot;, Dorothy Sayers&#x27;s &quot;Strong Poison&quot;, Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Curtain&quot;, the manhwa Roxana, the manga/anime &quot;Spy x Family&quot;, the manga/anime/light novel series &quot;The Apothecary Diaries&quot;, William Goldman&#x27;s &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (as well as its film adaptation), and the American historical series &quot;The Borgias&quot;.

In Michael Curtis Ford&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Last King&quot;, on the life and conquests of Mithridates VI, the technique is used by Mithridates.
A. E. Housman&#x27;s &quot;Terence, this is stupid stuff&quot; (originally published in &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;) invokes mithridatism as a metaphor for the benefit that serious poetry brings to the reader. The final section is a poetic rendition of the Mithridates legend.

<text>Saint Mary&#x27;s College is a private Catholic women&#x27;s liberal arts college in Notre Dame, Indiana, United States. Founded in 1844 by the Sisters of the Holy Cross, the name of the school refers to the Virgin Mary.

==History==
In 1843, four Sisters of the Holy Cross came from Le Mans, France, to share in the apostolate of education under invitation of Edward Sorin, who together with his priests and brothers of the Congregation of Holy Cross had founded the University of Notre Dame. In 1844, the sisters opened their first school in Bertrand, Michigan, about six miles from Notre Dame; it was a boarding academy with pre-collegiate grades. In 1855 the school moved to its present site, under the leadership of Mother Angela Gillespie. The main building and a former blacksmith shop used as a office were drawn by oxen to the new location.

Ellen Ewing Sherman, wife of General William Tecumseh Sherman was a cousin of Mother Angela Gillespie, directress of Saint Mary&#x27;s Academy. In 1864, Ellen took up temporary residence in South Bend, Indiana, to have her young family educated at the University of Notre Dame and St. Mary&#x27;s. At the age of fifteen, Mary Ellen Quinlan, who later became the mother of playwright Eugene O&#x27;Neill, attended Saint Mary&#x27;s Academy and graduated with honors in music, playing Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Polonaise for piano,&quot; op. 22, at the commencement.

Saint Mary&#x27;s College eventually grew from the Academy. A typewriting course was introduced in 1886; students practiced on Remington typewriters. In 1915 a course in auto mechanics was offered in hopes that students would become &quot;intelligent&quot; drivers. It was taught by Miss Mary Callahan, who had taken a course at a Studebaker plant in Detroit, and John Seibert, the college chauffeur. Studebaker executive A.R. Erskine donated a vehicle for hands-on instruction.

In 1945 Saint Mary&#x27;s Academy moved to the former Erskine estate on the south side of South Bend. Saint Mary&#x27;s College is located across the street (Indiana 933) from the University of Notre Dame. Saint Mary&#x27;s was the first women&#x27;s college in the Great Lakes region.

Today the school offers five bachelor&#x27;s degrees and four master&#x27;s degrees (the master&#x27;s programs are co-educational). There are approximately 120,000 living alumnae. Proposals to merge with University of Notre Dame (then a men&#x27;s institution) in the early 1970s were rejected by Saint Mary&#x27;s College, and Notre Dame became coeducational on its own in 1972. The College resides within the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend.

In 2023, the board of trustees first agreed to admit transgender female students, later rescinding the decision because many members of the community considered it a &quot;threat to our Catholic identity.&quot;

==Campus==

The campus features buildings in a variety of architectural styles and periods. Highlights include the Le Mans and Holy Cross Halls. Dedicated in 1926, Le Mans Hall is the second oldest building on campus and serves as the administration building and a residence hall. Holy Cross Hall, also a residence hall, was dedicated in 1906 and is the oldest building on campus.

The Angela Athletic Facility houses tennis, basketball, and volleyball courts in a gym area with seating for 2,000. Racquetball courts and space for gymnastics and for fencing are adjacent to the main gym. Architect Helmut Jahn designed the building. The building was dedicated in 1977 and is named for Mother Angela Gillespie, CSC, the first American to head Saint Mary&#x27;s Academy, which became Saint Mary&#x27;s College. Mother Angela oversaw the school moving from Bertrand Township, Michigan, to its present location in 1855. It was dedicated in May 1892 and razed in 1975. Angela was renovated and completely remodeled in 2017.

Cushwa-Leighton Library, designed by architect Evans Woollen III, was dedicated in 1982 and is named for Margaret Hall Cushwa and Mary Lou Morris Leighton. The four-story, -square-foot building blends modern and Gothic styles and serves as a key campus landmark. It features study areas, library stacks at its core, and a decorative tower housing offices and meeting rooms. With seating for over 540, the library offers access to 268,000+ books, 900+ periodicals, and electronic resources. The lower level houses the Huisking Instructional Technology Center, and since 2016, it has also hosted ResNet, the Writing &amp; Tutoring Center, Accessibility Resources, and the Student Success Program, creating a campus learning commons.

==Madeleva Lecture==
The college hosts a lecture series named after Sr. Madeleva Wolff, CSC, who served as the college&#x27;s third president, to honor her establishment in 1943 of a School of Sacred Theology (since closed) that provided the first opportunity in the U.S. for women to pursue graduate studies in theology. The lecture series highlights the work of women in theology. In 2000, the lecturers to that date were invited back to campus to compose a &quot;Charter for Women of Faith in the New Millennium.&quot; Instead, they produced &quot;The Madeleva Manifesto: A Message of Hope and Courage&quot;.


==Women&#x27;s Choir==
The Saint Mary&#x27;s College Women&#x27;s Choir, a select 40-voice ensemble under the direction of Nancy Menk, regularly commissions and performs new works for women&#x27;s voices. In February 2005, the Choir appeared before the national convention of the American Choral Directors Association in Los Angeles, performing in the Wilshire Christian Church and the new Walt Disney Concert Hall. The Choir tours nationally every other year, and regularly performs with the University of Notre Dame Glee Club in joint performances of major works with the South Bend Symphony Orchestra. In March 2011, the choir traveled to China to sing at colleges and universities in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou. They have appeared in concert at Carnegie Hall in 1999 and 2001, and returned there in November 2005 to perform music by Gwyneth Walker for women&#x27;s voices and orchestra. The Women&#x27;s Choir has recorded four compact discs on the ProOrgano label: &quot;Ave, Ave!&quot;, recorded in 1997, &quot;Amazing Day!&quot;, recorded in 2002, &quot;Anima Mea!&quot;, recorded in 2004 and &quot;Across the Bar&quot;, recorded in 2007.

==Athletics==
The college, a National Collegiate Athletic Association Division III school, and a member of the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association, sponsors eight varsity teams: tennis, volleyball, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, golf, softball, and cross country.

Saint Mary&#x27;s women also may participate in the intramural program and/or clubs in a variety of sports. Its club sports program offers recreational opportunities through competition and instruction. The clubs are open to all Saint Mary&#x27;s students, although membership requirements vary with each club. Many offerings are coeducational with the University of Notre Dame. Saint Mary&#x27;s sponsored clubs are cheerleading, dance, and volleyball teams. Other clubs co-sponsored with the University of Notre Dame are equestrian, figure skating, gymnastics, skiing, water polo, field hockey, ice hockey, Ultimate, and cycling.

Angela Athletic Facility expands opportunities for campus-wide recreation activities. Indoor facilities include basketball/volleyball, and a fitness center with treadmills, stairmasters, spin bikes, and Cybex weight machines. Outdoor facilities include a six-court outdoor tennis facility; softball, lacrosse and soccer fields; volleyball and basketball courts, areas for cross-country skiing, and a nature trail for hiking or jogging.

The Saint Mary&#x27;s College athletic mascots are the Belles. In 1975, Saint Mary&#x27;s began to form intercollegiate varsity sports. They did not, however, begin &#x27;playing&#x27; until 1977 when the tennis team played to an 8-1 NAIA match victory. It was there that the college competitors unveiled new team T-shirts with &quot;Belles&quot; emblazoned across the front.

<text>Fray Tomás de Berlanga (1487 – 8 August 1551) was the fourth Bishop of Panamá.

==Biography==
Tomás de Berlanga was born in Berlanga de Duero in Soria, Spain. On February 11, 1534, Pope Clement VII appointed him Bishop of Panama. On May 17, 1534, he was consecrated bishop by Francisco Mendoza de Bobadilla, Bishop of Coria. Francisco Mendoza, Bishop of Palencia, was co-consecrator, with Father Francisco de Navarra y Hualde assisting.

In 1535, he sailed to Peru to settle a dispute between Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro over division of territory after the conquest of the Inca Empire. His ship stalled when the winds died and strong currents carried him out to the Galápagos Islands which he thus discovered on March 10, 1535. He sent an account of the adventure and discovery to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. Berlanga resigned his see in 1537.

When Tomás de Berlanga returned to the Berlanga de Duero from America, he brought with him a cayman from the Chagres River in Panama. This cayman measured 3 meters. It is currently on display in the Colegiata de Nuestra Señora del Mercado in Berlanga de Duero.
