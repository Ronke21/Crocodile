<text>Joi Lansing (born Joy Rae Brown; April 6, 1929 – August 7, 1972) was an American model, film and television actress, and nightclub singer. She was noted for her pin-up photos and roles in B-movies, as well as a prominent role in the famous opening &quot;tracking shot&quot; in Orson Welles&#x27; 1958 crime drama &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;.

Lansing was often cast in roles similar to those played by her contemporaries Jayne Mansfield and Mamie Van Doren. She frequently was clad in skimpy costumes and bikinis that accentuated her figure (34D bust), but she never posed nude.

==Early life==
Lansing was born at Salt Lake Regional Medical Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1929 to Jack Glen Brown (also known as Glen Jack Brown and Glenn Jack Brown), a shoe salesman and orchestra musician, and Virginia Grace (née Shupe) Brown, a housewife.

She was later known by her stepfathers&#x27; surnames, i.e. Wassmansdorff and Loveland. In 1940, her family moved to Los Angeles, where her siblings were born.

==Career==

She began modeling at the age of 14. Lansing was discovered at age 14 by Arthur Freed, the producer, and was signed to an MGM talent school contract. Lansing completed high school on the studio lot. While a student at the University of California, Los Angeles, a writer for &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot; spotted her, and a part was written into the show for her.

===Films===
Lansing&#x27;s film career began in 1948, and in 1952 she played an uncredited role in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;. She received top billing in &quot;Hot Cars&quot; (1956), a crime drama involving a stolen-car racket. In 1958, she appeared in the famous opening sequence of Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; as Zita, the dancer who dies in a car explosion at the end of the extended tracking shot after exclaiming to a border guard &quot;I keep hearing this ticking noise inside my head!&quot;

She had a brief role as an astronaut&#x27;s girlfriend in sci-fi parody &quot;Queen of Outer Space&quot; (1958) and had fourth billing in the science fiction feature &quot;The Atomic Submarine&quot; (1959). During the 1960s, she starred in short musical films for the Scopitone video-jukebox system. Her songs included &quot;The Web of Love&quot; and &quot;The Silencers&quot;.

In 1964, producer Stanley Todd discussed a film project with Lansing, tentatively titled &quot;Project 22&quot;, with location shooting planned in Yugoslavia, and with George Hamilton and Geraldine Chaplin named to the cast. The film never was made.

Lansing played &quot;Lola&quot; in the romantic comedy &quot;Marriage on the Rocks&quot; (1965), with a cast that included Frank Sinatra, Deborah Kerr, and Dean Martin. Lansing previously had appeared in Sinatra&#x27;s drama &quot;A Hole in the Head&quot; (1959) and in Martin&#x27;s comedy &quot;Who Was That Lady?&quot; (1960). She turned down the chance to replace Jayne Mansfield in &quot;The Ice House&quot; (a 1969 horror film), and instead appeared opposite Basil Rathbone (in his last film appearance) and John Carradine in &quot;Hillbillys in a Haunted House&quot; (1967), as Mamie Van Doren&#x27;s replacement. Her last film was &quot;Bigfoot&quot; (1970).

===Recordings===
Lansing started singing in nightclubs in the early 1960s, and her performances are documented in several trade magazines. She performed with the Xavier Cugat orchestra and briefly toured with Les Paul, but little is known about the songs she actually recorded. Apparently, while starring on &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot;, she recorded a 45 r.p.m. single on the small REO record label in 1957: &quot;Love Me/What&#x27;s It Gonna Be&quot; (REO #1007).

In 1962, she recorded six to eight sides at Que Recorders in Los Angeles. These turned up at auction and were acetates of four songs each (with two songs duplicated on the second acetate). It is unknown whether these tracks were released on an album. Both acetates list the same identifying number of #4-8351. The songs recorded on February 23, 1962, were &quot;Masquerade is Over&quot;, &quot;All of You&quot; (Cole Porter), &quot;The One I Love&quot; (which was most likely &quot;The One I Love (Belongs to Somebody Else)&quot;, and &quot;Who Cares?&quot; (George and Ira Gershwin). On April 30, 1962, the songs recorded were &quot;Feel So Young&quot; (which was probably &quot;You Make Me Feel So Young&quot;), &quot;Dream&quot;, &quot;Masquerade&quot;, and &quot;All of You&quot;.

It was reported in &quot;Cashbox&quot; magazine on April 17, 1965, that Lansing was recording an album for RCA records with Jimmie Haskell (and suggested that it should be titled &quot;Joi to the World of Jazz&quot;), but nothing further is known about this project.

===Television===

Lansing appeared in &quot;The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok&quot;; &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;; &quot;It&#x27;s a Great Life&quot;; &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;; &quot;Bat Masterson&quot;; &quot;Where&#x27;s Raymond?&quot;; &quot;State Trooper&quot;; &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice&quot;; &quot;Richard Diamond, Private Detective&quot;; &quot;The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour&quot;; &quot;Sugarfoot&quot;; &quot;This Man Dawson&quot;; &quot;Maverick&quot;; &quot;Perry Mason&quot;; &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;; &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;; &quot;The Mothers-in-Law&quot;; &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;; and &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;; and had a recurring role in &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. 

The biggest single break of Lansing&#x27;s career was from 1955 through 1959 as the character Shirley Swanson in roughly 125 episodes of the &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot;.

She named Ozzie Nelson as possessing the greatest sex appeal of any actor with whom she worked. The two played a love scene in a 1956 &quot;Fireside Theater&quot; drama titled &quot;Shoot the Moon&quot;.

Lansing appeared as herself in a 1956 &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; season 6 episode, &quot;Desert Island&quot;. In 1957, she played Vera Payson in the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; episode &quot;The Case of the Crimson Kiss&quot;. She achieved some distinction for beating out Lois Lane (Noel Neill) to marry Superman (George Reeves) as the title character in &quot;Superman&#x27;s Wife&quot;, a 1958 episode of &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;.

What was possibly Lansing&#x27;s best television role may have been her least-seen as the leading lady in &quot;The Fountain of Youth&quot;, a Peabody Award-winning unsold television pilot directed by Orson Welles for Desilu in 1956 and broadcast on the &quot;Colgate Theatre&quot; two years later. The half-hour film remains available for public viewing at the Paley Center for Media in New York City and Los Angeles.

She appeared in a 1960 episode of &quot;The Untouchables&quot; entitled “The Noise of Death,” playing a character named Georgina Jones. In the 1960–61 season of &quot;Klondike&quot;, Lansing appeared as Goldie with Ralph Taeger, James Coburn, and Mari Blanchard. In 1960, she appeared as Evelyn in the &quot;Election Bet&quot; episode of the &quot;Mr. Lucky&quot; TV series (season 1, episode 34). In May 1963, Lansing appeared in &quot;Falcon Frolics &#x27;63&quot;. The broadcast honored the men stationed at the Vandenberg Air Force Base.

She appeared in six episodes of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; in the role of Gladys Flatt, the glamorous wife of bluegrass musician Lester Flatt.

Lansing has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles for her contributions to television.

==Personal life==
In August 1960, she married Stanley Laurence Todd, who had been her business manager when she married him.&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages/1047951454&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;desertsun/77442772&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;filmweb.pl/103237&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Lansing died from breast cancer on August 7, 1972, at St. John&#x27;s Hospital, Santa Monica, California. She had been treated surgically for the disease two years earlier. She also suffered from severe anemia.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1972/lansing-dies&quot;&gt;
*&quot;Joi Lansing, Actress, Dies at 37; (sic) &#x27;Glamour Girl&#x27; of TV and Films&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, August 9, 1972.
&lt;/ref&gt; While some press accounts gave her age as 37, she was actually 43 years old.

==In popular culture==
A highly fictionalized version of Lansing appears in James Ellroy&#x27;s 2021 novel &quot;Widespread Panic&quot;.

Footage of Lansing appears in the Tex Avery animated short &quot;The House of Tomorrow&quot;, released in 1949.

<text>The Lausanne Covenant is a July 1974 religious manifesto promoting active worldwide Christian evangelism. One of the most influential documents in modern evangelicalism, it was written at the First International Congress on World Evangelization in Lausanne, Switzerland, where it was adopted by 2,300 evangelicals in attendance.

==History==
In July 1974, the original Lausanne conference brought together approximately 2,700 Christian religious leaders from over 150 countries and was called by a committee headed by the American evangelist Billy Graham. The drafting committee for the 15-point document was chaired by John Stott of the United Kingdom. In addition to the signing of the covenant, the conference also created the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization. The covenant is in the form of an ecumenical confession, in which the signatories profess their shame at having failed to spread the Gospel of Jesus. The covenant specifically affirms the beliefs in the Nicene Creed. The signatories express their intention to be more committed to spreading Christianity throughout the world.

The original document is in English and has been translated into at least twenty different languages. In 1989, fifteen years after the original Lausanne conference, the Second International Congress on World Evangelization (sometimes called &quot;Lausanne II&quot;) convened in Manila, Philippines, and adopted the Manila Manifesto, an elaboration of the Lausanne Covenant.

The introduction of the covenant is:

<doc id="1225714" wikidata="Q357104" url="?curid=1225714" title="Military exercise">
<text>A military exercise, training exercise, maneuver (manoeuvre), or war game is the employment of military resources in training for military operations. Military exercises are conducted to explore the effects of warfare or test tactics and strategies without actual combat. They also ensure the combat readiness of garrisoned or deployable forces prior to deployment from a home base.

While both war games and military exercises aim to simulate real conditions and scenarios for the purpose of preparing and analyzing those scenarios, the distinction between a war game and a military exercise is determined, primarily, by the involvement of actual military forces within the simulation, or lack thereof. Military exercises focus on the simulation of real, full-scale military operations in controlled hostile conditions in attempts to reproduce war time decisions and activities for training purposes or to analyze the outcome of possible war time decisions. War games, however, can be much smaller than full-scale military operations, do not typically include the use of functional military equipment, and decisions and actions are carried out by artificial players to simulate possible decisions and actions within an artificial scenario which usually represents a model of a real-world scenario. Additionally, mathematical modeling is used in the simulation of war games to provide a quantifiable method of deduction. However, it is rare that a war game is depended upon for quantitative results, and the use of war games is more often found in situations where qualitative factors of the simulated scenario are needed to be determined.

The actual use of war games and the results that they can provide are limited by possibilities. War games cannot be used to achieve predictive results, as the nature of war and the scenarios that war games aim to simulate are not deterministic. Therefore, war games are primarily used to consider multiple possible outcomes of any given decision, or number of decisions, made in the simulated scenario. These possible outcomes are analyzed and compared, and cause-and-effect relationships are typically sought for the unknown factors within the simulation. It is typically the relationships between visual aspects of the simulation that aid in the assessment of the problems that are simulated within war games, like geographic locations and positionings that would be difficult to discern or analyze at full-scale and for complex environments.

Military exercises involving multiple branches of the same military are known as joint exercises, while military exercises involving two or more countries are known as combined, coalition, bilateral, or multilateral exercises, depending on the nature of the relationship between the countries and the number of them involved. These exercises allow for better coordination between militaries and observation of enemy tactics, and serve as a visible show of strength and cooperation for the participating countries. According to a 2021 study, joint military exercises within well-defined alliances usually deter adversaries without producing a moral hazard because of the narrow scope of the alliance, while joint military exercises outside of an alliance (which are extremely rare) usually lead to conflict escalation.

Exercises in the 20th and 21st centuries have often been identified by a unique code name, such as Cobra Gold, in the same manner as military contingency operations and combat operations like Operation Phantom Fury.

Military exercises are sometimes used as cover for the build up to an actual invasion, as in the cases of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, or it can provoke opponents at peace to perceive it as such, as in the case of Able Archer 83.

==Types==
===Command post===

A Command Post Exercise (CPX) typically focuses on the battle readiness of staffs such as a particular Unified Combatant Command or one of its components at any level. It may run in parallel with an FTX or its equivalent, or as a stand-alone event for headquarters staff only with heavy emphasis on simulated events.

===Field===

Historical names for the field exercise, or the full-scale rehearsal of military maneuvers as practice for warfare in the military services of the British Commonwealth include &quot;schemes&quot;, while those of the military services United States are known as Field Training Exercises (FTX), or, in the case of naval forces, Fleet Exercises (FLEETEX). In a field exercise or fleet exercise, the two sides in the simulated battle are typically called &quot;red&quot; (simulating the enemy forces) and &quot;blue&quot;, to avoid naming a particular adversary. This naming convention originates with the inventors of the table-top war-game (the &quot;Kriegsspiel&quot;), the Prussian Georg von Reisswitz; their army wore Prussian blue, so friendly forces were depicted by the color blue.

===Multiple forces===

Several different armed forces of the same nation training together are described as having a joint exercise. Those involving forces of multiple nations are described as having a combined exercise or coalition exercise. These are called a bilateral exercise if based on security agreements between two nations, or a multilateral exercise if the agreement is between multiple nations.

===Simulation===
Other types of exercise include the Tactical Exercise Without Troops (TEWT), also known as a sand table, map, cloth model, or computer simulation exercise. These allow commanders to manipulate models through possible scenarios in military planning. This is also called warfare simulation, or in some instances a virtual battlefield, and in the past has been described as &quot;wargames&quot;. Such examples of modern military wargames include DARWARS, a serious game developed since 2003 by DARPA with BBN Technologies, a defense contractor which was involved in the development of packet switching, used for ARPANET, and which developed the first computer modem in 1963.

Military operations and training have included different scenarios a soldier might encounter with morals and different ethics. In one military operation soldiers are frequently asked to engage in combat, humanitarian, and stabilization roles. These increase the ambiguity of a role one may encounter and challenge of ethics. This will also lead the military personnel to have to make a difficult call in challenging circumstances. Even in difficult situations and conditions, military personnel still has to follow rules and regulations such as: 1) when the right thing to do is not immediately clear; 2) when two or more important principles or values support different actions, and 3) when some harm will result, regardless of the actions taken (Defense Ethics Program, Department of National Defense, 2012). These simulations involve crude living conditions, sleep deprivations, time limit, and either lack or ambiguous amount of information.

A subset of simulated exercises is the Table Top Exercise (TTX), typically limited to senior personnel stepping through the decision-making processes they would employ in a crisis, a contingency, or general warfare.

==History==

The use of military exercises and war games can be found to date back to as early as the early 19th century, wherein it was the officers of the Prussian Army who created the contemporary, tactical form of wargames that have since been more widely used and developed by other military conglomerations throughout the world. Non-tactical forms of wargames have existed for much longer, however, in the forms of tabletop games such as chess and Go.

The modern use of military exercises grew out of the military need to study warfare and to reenact old battles for learning purposes. During the age of &quot;Kabinettskriege&quot; (Cabinet wars), Frederick the Great, King of Prussia from 1740 to 1786, &quot;put together his armies as a well-oiled clockwork mechanism whose components were robot-like warriors. No individual initiative was allowed to Frederick&#x27;s soldiers; their only role was to cooperate in the creation of walls of projectiles through synchronized firepower.&quot; This was in the pursuit of a more effective army, and such practices made it easier to look at war from a top-down perspective. Disciplined troops should respond predictably, allowing study to be confined to maneuvers and command.

Prussia&#x27;s victory over the Second French Empire in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) is sometimes partly credited to the training of Prussian officers with the wargame &quot;Kriegsspiel&quot;, which was invented around 1811 and gained popularity with many officers in the Prussian army. These first wargames were played with dice which represented &quot;friction&quot;, or the intrusion of less than ideal circumstances during a real war (including morale, meteorology, the fog of war, etc.).

21st century militaries still use wargames to simulate future wars and model their reaction. According to Manuel de Landa, after World War II the Command, Control and Communications (C3) was transferred from the military staff to the RAND Corporation, the first think tank. Around the mid to late 20th century, computer simulated war games were created to replace traditional war gaming methods with the goal of optimizing and speeding up the process and making it possible to analyze more complex scenarios with greater ease. In 1958, the Naval War college installed a computer war game system where their traditional war gaming activities were held. The system was called the Navy Electronic Warfare System, and cost over $10 million to install. The change from traditional war gaming methods to electronic computer simulated ones meant that the value and accuracy of a war game simulation was less dependent on skill and individual experiences, and more dependent on quantitative data and complicated analysis methods.

Von Neumann was employed by the RAND Corporation, and his game theory was used in wargames to model nuclear dissuasion during the Cold War. Thus, the U.S. nuclear strategy was defined using wargames, &quot;SAM&quot; representing the U.S. and &quot;IVAN&quot; representing the Soviet Union.
Early game theory included only zero-sum games, which means that when one player won, the other automatically lost. The prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, which models the situation of two prisoners in which each one is given the choice to betray or not the other, gave three alternatives to the game:
*Neither prisoners betrays the other, and both are given short-term sentences
*One prisoner betrays the other, and is freed, while the other gets a long sentence
*Both prisoners betray each other, and both are given mid-sized sentences

This model gave the basis for the massive retaliation nuclear doctrine. The zero-sum fallacy and cooperative games would be theorized only later, while the evolution of nuclear technology and missiles made the massive retaliation nuclear strategy obsolete.

<text>Flavio Biondo (Latin Flavius Blondus) (1392 – June 4, 1463) was an Italian Renaissance humanist historian. He was one of the first historians to use a three-period division of history (Ancient, Medieval, Modern) and is known as one of the first archaeologists. 
Born in the capital city of Forlì, in the Romagna region, Flavio was well schooled from an early age, studying under Ballistario of Cremona. During a brief stay in Milan, he discovered and transcribed the unique manuscript of Cicero&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Brutus&quot;. He moved to Rome in 1433 where he began work on his writing career; he was appointed secretary to the Cancelleria under Eugene IV in 1444 and accompanied Eugene in his exile in Ferrara and Florence. After his patron&#x27;s death, Flavio was employed by his papal successors, Nicholas V, Callixtus III and the humanist Pius II.

==Archaeological works==
Flavio published three encyclopedic works that were systematic and documented guides to the ruins and topography of ancient Rome, for which he has been called one of the first archaeologists; subsequent antiquaries and historians built on the foundations laid down by Flavio and by his older contemporary, Poggio Bracciolini. At the time the ruins of ancient Rome were overgrown and unexplored. When in 1420 Bracciolini climbed the Capitol he saw only deserted fields. The Forum, buried in eroded topsoil, was grazed by cows—the &quot;Campo Vaccino&quot;—and pigs rooted in its unweeded vegetation. Flavio and fellow humanists like Leon Battista Alberti began to explore and document the architecture, topography and history of Rome, and in the process revived a vision of Rome&#x27;s former glory.

Flavio&#x27;s first work was &quot;De Roma instaurata&quot; (&quot;Rome Restored&quot;, 3 vols., 1444–1448), a reconstruction of ancient Roman topography. It was and remains a highly influential humanist vision of restoring Rome to its previous heights of grandeur by recreating what Rome used to look like based on the ruins which remained. This work was the first systematic and well documented guide to the ruins of Rome, or indeed any ancient ruins.

The second was the highly popular &quot;De Roma triumphante&quot; (&quot;Rome Triumphant&quot;, 1479) about pagan Rome as a model for contemporary governmental and military reforms. The book was highly influential in reviving Roman patriotism and respect for ancient Rome, while presenting the papacy as a continuation of the Roman Empire.

==Historical works==

Biondo&#x27;s greatest works were &quot;Italia illustrata&quot; (&quot;Italy Illuminated&quot;, written between 1448 and 1458, published 1474) and the &quot;Historiarum ab inclinatione Romanorum imperii decades&quot; (&quot;Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire&quot;, written from 1439 to 1453, published in 1483).

The &quot;Italia illustrata&quot; (1474) is a geography, based on the author&#x27;s personal travels, and history of fourteen Italian regions (regiones). Unlike medieval geographers, whose focus was regional, Biondo, taking Strabo for his model, reinstated the idea of &quot;Italy&quot; to include the whole of the peninsula. Through topography, he intended to link Antiquity with modern times, with descriptions of each location, the etymology of its toponym and its changes through time, with a synopsis of important events connected with each location. This first historical geography starts with the Roman Republic and Empire, through 400 years of barbarian invasions and an analysis of Charlemagne and later Holy Roman Emperors. He gives an excellent description of the humanist revival and restoration of the classics during the first half of the fifteenth century.

Flavio&#x27;s greatest work is the &quot;Historiarum ab Inclinatione Romanorum Imperii&quot; (Venice, 1483), a history of Europe in thirty-two books, from the plunder of Rome in 410 by the Visigoths to contemporary Italy (1442). Using only the most reliable and primary sources, it used a three-period framework, with Italy reviving in Biondo&#x27;s own time and breaking free of earlier trends. Leonardo Bruni also used a three-period framework in &quot;History of the Florentine People&quot;, written at about the same time as Biondo&#x27;s work.

<text>The Marwari or Marwadi (Devanagari: मारवाड़ी) are an Indo-Aryan ethno-linguistic group that originate from the Marwar region of Rajasthan, India. Their language, also called Marwari, comes under the umbrella of Rajasthani languages, which is part of the Western Zone of Indo-Aryan languages. Apart from India, they have sizeable presence in the neighbouring countries of Pakistan and Nepal. 

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Marwari&quot; once referred to the area encompassed by the former princely state of Marwar, also called the Jodhpur region of southwest Rajasthan in India. It formed from the two constituent words, Maru(region of Thar desert) and Wadi(enclosure), effectively indicating the western part of modern day Rajasthan. The Jodhpur region includes the present districts of Barmer, Jalore, Jodhpur, Nagaur, Churu, Pali and Sikar. It has evolved to be a designation for the Rajasthani people in general but it is used particularly with reference to certain jātis that fall within the Bania community. The most prominent among these communities, are the Agrawals, Khandelwals, Maheshwaris and Oswals. It is possible that the association of the &quot;Marwari&quot; term with Jodhpur owes more to the high status of that place in pre-independence India.

Dwijendra Tripathi believes that the term &quot;Marwari&quot; was probably used by the traders only when they were outside their home region; that is, by the diaspora. Anne Hardgrove also supports this argument, saying that the Marwari identity could only exist in the context of a diaspora who came &quot;from&quot; somewhere and that until they migrated they had no such designation.

==History==
===Early origins===
Marwari traders have historically been migratory in habit. The possible causes of this trait include the proximity of their homeland to the major Ganges - Yamuna trade route; movement to escape famine; and the encouragement given to them by various rulers of northern India who saw advantages in having their skills in banking and finance.

The pattern of Marwari migration became increasingly divergent following the decline in wars between Rajput kingdoms, which the Marwaris had helped to finance, and the decreasing influence of the community over the North Indian caravan trading routes that resulted from the British establishing themselves in the region. The changed focus of migration was also encouraged by the British, who established or patronised new trading routes and centres, as well as by the decline in the political significance of the Rajput courts whose famed conspicuous consumption had been supported by Marwari money. The community welcomed the relative safety that the British presence offered, as well as the commercial and legal frameworks that they provided and which were more favourable to Marwari activities than the systems prevalent during the earlier period of Mughal and Rajput rule.

The Marwari Jagat Seth family served as banker to the Nawab of Bengal.

===British era===
After the decline of Mughal authority, Marwari traders, bankers and financiers migrated to the growing British power in Calcutta. There were particularly significant population shifts to Bombay between 1835-1850 and Kolkata from the 1870s, as well as to Madras. 

Historian Medha M. Kudaisya has said that the Marwaris:
A considerable number of Marwari business groups made their fortune on speculative markets in the nineteenth and early twentieth century.

Although maintaining close and public ties with the British authorities, members of the Marwari business community were early financial supporters of the Indian National Congress, often in secret.

===Independent India===
In 1956, the All-India Marwari Federation opposed a linguistic organisation of states while buying up regional language newspapers in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Today, they control many of the country&#x27;s largest media groups.

The community&#x27;s influence over the Indian economy declined following the country&#x27;s 1991 economic reforms. From a peak of controlling 24 per cent of economic activity in 1990, it had fallen to less than 2 per cent in 2000. This reflects the growth of new industries outside of commodities trading and primary production. The figure for 2000 is considered to be lower than the position in 1939, when the community first began its resurgence.

==Language==
Marwari, or Marrubhasha, as it is referred to by Marwaris, is the traditional, historical, language of the Marwari ethnicity. The Marwari language is closely related to the Rajasthani language. The latter evolved from the Old Gujarati (also called &quot;Old Western Rajasthani&quot;, &quot;Gujjar Bhakha&quot; or &quot;Maru-Gurjar&quot;), language spoken by the people in Gujarat and Rajasthan. It has been noted that throughout the state of Rajasthan, people avoid identifying their language by name, preferring to identify themselves as speaking &quot;Rajasthani&quot; with Marwari literature being taught as Rajasthani until secondary level.

== Culture ==
Marwaris have been known for a tightly knit social solidarity, described by Selig Harrison in 1960 as &quot;indissoluble under the impact of the strongest regional solvents&quot;. According to Hardgrove, &quot;The main duty for Marwari women, it would seem, is to provide a stable household life for their husbands, sons and brothers-in-law&quot;, although she acknowledges that some such women have in recent years been attempting to carve out roles in the wider world through engagement in charitable ventures and even running their own businesses.

== Demographics outside India ==

=== Pakistan ===
Following the 1947 partition, many Marwari Muslims moved to the new state of Pakistan, mainly in Karachi with some in southern Punjab, and as of 2007 their numbers were estimated at around 500,000 in the country.

The Ghazdarabad neighbourhood of Karachi has a Marwari Muslim majority, numbering around 20,000 and having mostly moved from Jaisalmer in Rajasthan after the partition and earlier in the 19th century as well.

=== Nepal ===
The Central Bureau of Statistics of Nepal classifies the Marwaris (called Marwadis in the Nepal census) as a subgroup within the broader social group of &quot;Indian Nepalis&quot;. At the time of the Nepal census of 2011, 51,443 people (0.2% of the population of Nepal) were Marwadi. The frequency of Marwadis by province was as follows:
* Koshi Province (0.4%)
* Bagmati Province (0.3%)
* Madhesh Province (0.2%)
* Lumbini Province (0.1%)
* Gandaki Province (0.0%)
* Karnali Province (0.0%)
* Sudurpashchim Province (0.0%)

The frequency of Marwadis was higher than national average (0.2%) in the following districts:
* Morang (1.0%)
* Parsa (0.9%)
* Kathmandu (0.8%)
* Sunsari (0.6%)
* Jhapa (0.5%)
* Banke (0.3%)
* Kapilvastu (0.3%)
* Sarlahi (0.3%)

<doc id="1225751" wikidata="Q2129083" url="?curid=1225751" title="Rākino Island">
<text>Rākino Island is one of the many islands in the Hauraki Gulf / Tīkapa Moana, an arm of the Pacific Ocean to the northeast of Auckland, New Zealand.

Rākino is a small island north-east of Motutapu Island. The island is long and about wide and has an area of 1.5 km² (0.58 sq mi / 371 acres). The two most popular bays have public access, but three others also have access from the sea. There are smaller bays and beaches without public access. The public wharf is at the south end of Sandy Bay, and a barge access ramp is at the western end of Sanford Way in Home Bay. The hilly topography comprises a fertile layer of volcanic topsoil from Rangitoto Island that overlays a thick mantle of clay soil which in turn overlays greywacke rock. The island is mostly in pasture with pockets of coastal pōhutukawa.

There are around 76 dwellings on Rākino Island though the permanent population is only 21 as of 2019. Rākino, with its few permanent residents and its small size, and with a limited public ferry service, has little attraction for commuters. Residents welcome its isolation and privacy.

==History==
Sir George Grey, governor of New Zealand, bought Rākino in 1862. He ordered trees and started building a house in Home Bay but he lost interest when Kawau Island became available. During the 1860s the prisoners from the Invasion of the Waikato phase of the New Zealand Wars were brought to Auckland, some were housed in the hulks &quot;Marion&quot; and &quot;Manukau&quot; at anchor in the harbour and a small party was settled at Rākino, where a house and gardening supplies were provided. The experiment was a failure and soon abandoned. There is an entry in the Appendices to the House of Representatives Journal which says &quot;Ihaka did not thrive much on the island and died there, it is presumed of homesickness and a broken heart.&quot;

In 1874 Albert Sanford leased the island from Sir George Grey before his wife, Elizabeth Sanford, bought it in 1904. He and his family lived there for nearly 80 years. He was one of the founders of the Auckland commercial fishing fleet. His company started on Rākino Island in 1881, and he sold fish on the wharves at the bottom of Queen St. “Sanford Limited” was incorporated in 1904. The family home he built still stands in Home Bay. It was built of kauri logs rafted from Mercury Bay on the Coromandel Peninsula.

In 1963, the island was bought by Dr Maxwell Rickard, president of the UPO (United Peoples&#x27; Organisation (Worldwide) Incorporated), with the aim of setting up a philanthropic community. Rickard was a clinical psychologist and hypnotherapist and also owned an Auckland nightclub and toured as a professional hypnotherapist under the name &quot;The Great Ricardo&quot;. Plans for the island included a clinic for disturbed and nervous patients, an international orphanage, a refuge for unmarried mothers and homes for the elderly. However, these plans did not eventuate and the island was subdivided in 1965 into 25 blocks of and 125 smaller pieces of land which sold for between £2500 and £6000.

Communication on the island was a problem, so the world&#x27;s first solar-powered telephone was installed. While widespread use of mobile phones has reduced reliance on landlines, the phone is still in use and local calling to Auckland is free.

==Biodiversity==
In 2002 the invasive Norwegian rat was eradicated from Rākino Island.

<doc id="1225753" wikidata="Q7989278" url="?curid=1225753" title="Westmoreland County, Connecticut">
<text>Westmoreland County, Connecticut was a county established by the State of Connecticut in October 1776, encompassing the present-day area of Wyoming Valley, in northeastern Pennsylvania. Both colonies claimed this territory and the issue was further confused by the Six Nations selling the territory to both Connecticut in 1754 and again to Pennsylvania in 1768. The first of the Yankee-Pennamite Wars were fought in and around the County, from 1771 through 1775.

In December 1782 a court of arbitration appointed by the Continental Congress met in Trenton,
New Jersey, and made a unanimous decision in favor of Pennsylvania&#x27;s claim. In compensation, Connecticut received equivalent territory of 3,300,000 acres named the Western Reserve, in the future northeast of Ohio. Pennsylvania then refused to confirm the private land titles of the settlers, which caused the Second of the Yankee-Pennamite Wars. It briefly seceded to become the short-lived State of Westmoreland in 1784. Connecticut finally ceded it to Pennsylvania in 1786 after Pennsylvania confirmed the land titles and Westmoreland County was renamed to Luzerne County.

It has no relationship to the current Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, which is located on the western and opposite side of the state.

<doc id="1225755" wikidata="Q772102" url="?curid=1225755" title="Limb darkening">
<text>Limb darkening is an optical effect seen in stars (including the Sun) and planets, where the central part of the disk appears brighter than the edge, or &quot;&quot;. Its understanding offered early solar astronomers an opportunity to construct models with such gradients. This encouraged the development of the theory of radiative transfer.

== Basic theory ==

Optical depth, a measure of the opacity of an object or part of an object, combines with effective temperature gradients inside the star to produce limb darkening. The light seen is approximately the integral of all emission along the line of sight modulated by the optical depth to the viewer (i.e. 1/e times the emission at 1 optical depth, 1/e2 times the emission at 2 optical depths, etc.). Near the center of the star, optical depth is effectively infinite, causing approximately constant brightness. However, the effective optical depth decreases with increasing radius due to lower gas density and a shorter line of sight distance through the star, producing a gradual dimming, until it becomes zero at the apparent edge of the star.

The effective temperature of the photosphere also decreases with increasing distance from the center of the star. The radiation emitted from a gas is approximately black-body radiation, the intensity of which is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature. Therefore, even in line of sight directions where the optical depth is effectively infinite, the emitted energy comes from cooler parts of the photosphere, resulting in less total energy reaching the viewer.

The temperature in the atmosphere of a star does not always decrease with increasing height. For certain spectral lines, the optical depth is greatest in regions of increasing temperature. In this scenario, the phenomenon of &quot;limb brightening&quot; is seen instead. In the Sun, the existence of a temperature minimum region means that limb brightening should start to dominate at far-infrared or radio wavelengths. Above the lower atmosphere, and well above the temperature-minimum region, the Sun is surrounded by the million-kelvin solar corona.
For most wavelengths this region is optically thin, i.e. has small optical depth, and must, therefore, be limb-brightened if it is spherically symmetric.

== Calculation of limb darkening ==

In the figure shown here, as long as the observer at point P is outside the stellar atmosphere, the intensity seen in the direction θ will be a function only of the angle of incidence . This is most conveniently approximated as a polynomial in :
formula_1
where is the intensity seen at P along a line of sight forming angle with respect to the stellar radius, and is the central intensity. In order that the ratio be unity for , we must have
formula_2

For example, for a Lambertian radiator (no limb darkening) we will have all except . As another example, for the Sun at , the limb darkening is well expressed by &quot;N&quot; = 2 and
formula_3

The equation for limb darkening is sometimes more conveniently written as
formula_4
which now has independent coefficients rather than coefficients that must sum to unity.

The constants can be related to the constants. For ,
formula_5

For the Sun at 550 nm, we then have
formula_6

This model gives an intensity at the edge of the Sun&#x27;s disk of only 30% of the intensity at the center of the disk.

We can convert these formulas to functions of by using the substitution
formula_7
where is the angle from the observer to the limb of the star. For small we have
formula_8

We see that the derivative of cos ψ is infinite at the edge.

The above approximation can be used to derive an analytic expression for the ratio of the mean intensity to the central intensity. The mean intensity is the integral of the intensity over the disk of the star divided by the solid angle subtended by the disk:
formula_9

where is a solid angle element, and the integrals are over the disk: and . We may rewrite this as
formula_10

Although this equation can be solved analytically, it is rather cumbersome. However, for an observer at infinite distance from the star, formula_11 can be replaced by formula_12, so we have
formula_13
which gives
formula_14

For the Sun at 550 nm, this says that the average intensity is 80.5% of the intensity at the center.

<text>The NoHo Arts District is a community in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, that is home to contemporary theaters, art galleries, cafes, and shops. The community is generally bounded by Hatteras Street to the north, Cahuenga Boulevard to the east, Tujunga Avenue to the west, and Camarillo Street to the south. The area features more than twenty professional theaters, producing new work and classics, diverse art galleries, public art, and professional dance studios. The district also features the largest concentration of music recording venues west of the Mississippi. A Metro Rail station is located here, the North Hollywood station of the B Line and serves as the terminus of the Metro G Line busway.

Business and theater owners in the Universal City/North Hollywood Chamber of Commerce established a theater and arts district in 1992 with support from the Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs. They chose &quot;NoHo&quot;, a play off the well-known SoHo Arts District neighborhood of New York City.

The NoHo Arts District, in conjunction with greater North Hollywood, is being transformed into a regional center, in large part as a result of the construction of Metro Stations for the B Line and the G Line, two lines that have made the neighborhood into a regional hub for the San Fernando Valley. Medium- and high-density developments are being built around the Metro Station, making the Arts District a center of citywide development, with the intent of creating a walkable urban village. North Hollywood&#x27;s landscape (and the Art&#x27;s District as a result) has been transformed in recent years, with condominium towers (including a fifteen-story building on Lankershim Boulevard being built in the midst of older one-story bungalows and small apartment complexes.

The theater district includes two new large venues that expand upon existing theaters, the redesigned NoHo Arts Center (formerly the American Renegade Theatre) and the redesigned El Portal Theatre. They add to the existing 31 theaters located in and around the NoHo Arts District. NoHo Commons, developed by J.H. Snyder Company, is located near the NoHo Arts District&#x27;s commercial core and subway station. The $100-million, 292-unit loft apartment project by Snyder was the first segment to be completed of NoHo Commons, part of a &quot;transit village&quot; taking form at the terminus of the Metro B Line subway and the G Line busway. The NoHo Commons construction and development consisted of three phases, completing with the construction of a Laemmle Theatre. Phase III also consisted of the construction of an eight-story office on the corner of Lankershim Boulevard and Weddington in 2009. The building&#x27;s primary tenant is currently the Art Institute of California-Hollywood. NoHo 14, a 180-unit, fourteen-story apartment building, was built in 2004 as one of the first large-scale developments in the neighborhood.

The historic North Hollywood train depot at Lankershim and Chandler Boulevards was restored in 2014 for $3.6 million. It is a Southern Pacific Railroad standard design, a One Story Combination Depot No. 15 or 21. The train depot, dating to 1896, sits on land owned by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, across from the Metro B Line subway station and next to the terminus of the G Line bus line.

Currently the NoHo Arts District, in conjunction with the Community Redevelopment Agency-Los Angeles, is working on beautification efforts to make the area more appealing to businesses. The current focus is primarily on revamping store fronts on Lankershim Boulevard and Magnolia Boulevard with Burbank Boulevard to follow.

In the future, North Hollywood plans a $1 billion mixed-use development at Lankershim and Chandler, surrounding the Metro B and G line terminals. The project would re-develop with of commercial space and nearly 1500 residential units in three high-rise towers. The project was awarded to Trammell Crow Company and High Street Residential by the Los Angeles Metro board.

<text>The First International Congress on World Evangelization (ICOWE), also sometimes called the Lausanne Congress or Lausanne &#x27;74, was a Christian conference held from 16 to 25 July 1974 in Switzerland.

The conference is noted for producing the Lausanne Covenant, one of the major documents of modern evangelical Christianity. The drafting committee of the covenant was headed by John Stott of England.

The movement claims to follow in the footsteps of the 1910 World Missionary Conference.

==History==
The congress started as a plan announced by American evangelist Billy Graham in August 1972 to hold an international congress on evangelism as a follow-up to the 1966 World Congress on Evangelism held in Berlin, West Germany. The conference was called by a committee headed by Graham and brought together religious leaders from 150 nations. Lausanne was selected for the congress in October 1972. The congress office opened in April 1973. The theme of the congress was &quot;Let the earth hear His voice.&quot; 

Almost 2,700 evangelical Christian leaders attended the conference at the Palais de Beaulieu in Lausanne, Switzerland to discuss the progress, resources and methods of evangelizing the world. The reports and papers at the congress helped to illustrate the shift of Christianity&#x27;s center of gravity from Europe and North America to Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Millie Dienert chaired the prayer committee at the Lausanne conference. After the congress, the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization was established.

The conference was attended by, among others, Francis Schaeffer, journalist Malcolm Muggeridge and bishop Jack Dain.

==Legacy==

The Second International Congress on World Evangelization was held fifteen years later in Manila.

The Third International Congress on World Evangelization was held in Cape Town, South Africa, from 16 to 25 October 2010.

A fourth congress was held in Incheon, Seoul, South Korea in September 2024.

<text>George Wylie Henderson (June 14, 1904 – 1965) was an American writer of the Harlem Renaissance.

==Biography==
Henderson was born in 1904 in Warriorstand, Alabama, an unincorporated area of Macon County. He attended the limited and segregated rural school. He went to Tuskegee Institute, where he learned printing as a trade.

As a young man, Henderson moved to New York, joining the Great Migration of hundreds of thousands of blacks from the South to Northern and Midwestern industrial cities in the early part of the 20th century. He supported himself as a printer for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;.

He also worked as a writer, becoming associated with writers and artists of the Harlem Renaissance. Henderson lived in New York City until his death.

From 1932–33, he published nine stories in &quot;The New York Daily News&quot;, in its &quot;Daily Story from Real Life&quot; series. In addition, he became a regular contributor of short stories in &quot;Redbook Magazine,&quot; which had national distribution.

Henderson also published two novels, &quot;Ollie Miss&quot; (1935) and &quot;Jule&quot; (1946), which dealt with pressures on African Americans in the modernizing South. These novels were reprinted in 1989 and 1990, respectively, by the University of Alabama Press, with an introduction by Blyden Jackson. David Nicholls suggests that these expressed some of the &quot;individualist ethos&quot; of Booker T. Washington, president of the Tuskegee Institute which Henderson had attended. They also express contrasts, as &quot;Ollie Miss&quot; is about an African-American woman near Tuskegee who wants a farm where she can raise her child. &quot;Jule&quot;, by contrast, deals with a young man who leaves the South to go to the city in the North, similar to Henderson&#x27;s own journey of advancement, to an urban center that held the promise of autonomy.

<text>The Western Institute in Poznań (Polish: &quot;Instytut Zachodni&quot;, German &quot;West-Institut&quot;, French: &quot;L&#x27;Institut Occidental&quot;) is a scientific research society focusing on the Western provinces of Poland - Kresy Zachodnie (including Greater Poland, Silesia, Pomerania), history, economy and politics of Germany, and the Polish-German relations in history and today.

Established by professor Zygmunt Wojciechowski in 1944 in Warsaw, since 1945 based in Poznań. There were branches in Warsaw (1945–53), Wrocław (1948–49) and scientific posts in Kraków and Olsztyn.

Full name: &quot;Instytut Zachodni. Instytut Naukowo-Badawczy im. Zygmunta Wojciechowskiego w Poznaniu&quot;

==History==
The Western Institute was founded in 1944 and became the flagship of the Polish Research of the West.

==Mission==

The mission of the Institute is to conduct research projects within fields of political science, sociology, history, economics and law-especially focusing on Polish-German issues as well as European politics. It has been founded by a group of Poznań University professor in 1944, and incorporated with Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1992

==Praise==
Professor Władysław Bartoszewski, Polish survivor of Auschwitz, and renowned figure of Polish-Jewish and Polish-German reconciliation praised the work of the institute:
*&quot;I often used the archives of the Western Institute, when writing my works on the Nazi terror. They reliably researched Nazi atrocities. The series &quot;Documenta Occupationis&quot;-a collection of original documents concerning German policy in occupied Poland is a canon position. Many American, Israeli and German scholars use them to this day without reservations. They are part of scholarly literature and this is the greatest contribution of the Institute during its early years of existence&quot;

==Criticism==

The work of the Institute carried out while Poland was a communist country has been criticised by American historian Richard Blanke as having anti-German bias
Other criticism of work from this period have included allegations of propaganda and dullness while admitting that the Institute produced &quot;some good works on political sciences and legal systems&quot;

German historian Gregor Thum has written that the premise of the research concept of the Western Institute in the first decades was the idea of an eternal German-Polish antagonism and thus the Institute&#x27;s research, like its German counterpart, the Ostforschung, was based on explicit political objectives, active support of the territorial claims of the state and the distribution of research results by popular science.

After the fall of communism, the Institute has been one of the leading institutions in joint Polish-German scholarship and cooperation.

Officially founded in 1905 as the first comprehensive arts learning institution in the United States, CFA has educated outstanding artists, architects, designers, theater artists and musicians who have made important contributions to culture in the United States and the world for almost a century.

The College of Fine Arts concentrates on the education of professionals in the arts in the broader context of Carnegie Mellon University. Beyond their education in their chosen field, through required and elective course work, students are involved with other disciplines within CFA and within the other colleges of the University. Further, the college’s location in the Oakland District of Pittsburgh with its unique density of cultural resources (The Carnegie Museum of Art, The Carnegie Museum of Natural History, The Carnegie Library, the University of Pittsburgh, Hillman Library, the Frick Fine Arts Building, and Phipps Botanical Conservatory,) places CFA at the center of a premier cultural environment.

CFA also benefits from the presence of its Miller Institute for Contemporary Art (Miller ICA).

In addition, CFA actively promotes integrative and interdisciplinary practices throughout the Carnegie Mellon University campus, and currently offers the BXA Intercollege Degree Programs with Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, Mellon College of Science, and School of Computer Science. The undergraduate degrees are the Bachelor of Humanities and Arts (BHA), Bachelor of Science and Arts (BSA), and Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts (BCSA) respectively, and students are to be admitted to the two corresponding schools at CMU to be enrolled, where they will develop and experiment with their corresponding disciplines in the forms of major capstone projects.

CFA alumni have shaped the television, stage and film worlds; have created work collected in international museums; have composed for and are performing and conducting in major symphony orchestras, choruses and opera companies; have built notable buildings, designed building systems and architectural imaging systems; created significant innovations in graphic and industrial design; and are professors and deans in major arts institutions. These graduates have actively developed the innovations, inventions, techniques and information structures in their professional fields. They have also written, published and lectured extensively.

The educational and artistic life of the college is interwoven with a dense calendar of theatre performances, concert, exhibitions, film and media presentations and lectures by visiting artists, practitioners and scholars.

Notable alumni include Gabriel Macht, Christian Borle, Jonathan Borofsky, Philip Pearlstein, Steven Bochco, James Cromwell, Holly Hunter, Rob Marshall, Ricky Ian Gordon, Stephen Schwartz, Billy Porter (actor), Zachary Quinto, Ryan McGinness, Judith Light, Patrick Wilson, Ted Danson, Keith Lockhart, Matt Bomer, Josh Groban, Josh Gad, Leslie Odom, Jr. and Blair Underwood.

<doc id="1225812" wikidata="Q5681091" url="?curid=1225812" title="Hatchet (novel)">
<text>Hatchet is a 1987 young-adult wilderness survival novel written by American writer Gary Paulsen. It is the first novel of five in the &quot;Hatchet&quot; series. Other novels in the series include &quot;The River&quot; (1991), &quot;Brian&#x27;s Winter&quot; (1996), &quot;Brian&#x27;s Return&quot; (1999) and &quot;Brian&#x27;s Hunt&quot; (2003). It was first published in September 1987 by Bradbury Press, and the recipient of the Newbery Honor Award in 1988.

==Plot==
Brian Robeson is the 13-year-old son of divorced parents. As he travels from Hampton on a Cessna 406 bush plane to visit his father in the oil fields of Northern Canada for the summer, the pilot suddenly suffers a massive heart attack and dies. Brian assumes control of the plane and makes an effort to land, but he runs out of fuel in the process, forcing him to attempt a ditching, and as a result, crash-lands into an L-shaped lake in the middle of a vast forest. Brian survives the crash with only a few minor injuries.

Throughout the summer, Brian learns how to survive on his own in the vast wilderness, with nothing but his windbreaker and a hatchet—a gift his mother gave him shortly before his plane departed. He discovers how to prepare a fire with the hatchet, and eats whatever food he can find, from rabbits and ruffed grouse – which he nicknames “fool-birds” – to turtle eggs, fish and berries. Simultaneously, he deals with many of Nature&#x27;s dangers, including mosquitoes, a porcupine, two huge bears – one of which is a mother with her cubs, a pack of three wolves, a skunk, a bad-tempered female moose, and even a tornado.

Over time, Brian develops his survival skills and becomes a fine woodsman. He crafts a bow, some arrows, and a fishing spear to aid in his hunting. He also fashions a shelter out of the underside of a rock overhang. During his time alone, Brian struggles with memories of home as well as the bittersweet memory of his mother, whom Brian had caught cheating on his father before their divorce.

When a sudden tornado hits the area, it draws the tail of the plane toward the shore of the lake. This brings Brian to believe that there may be a survival pack of some description on the plane. He makes a raft from a few broken-off treetops to get to the plane, and when he cuts his way through the fuselage into the tail section, he drops his hatchet in the lake and dives in to get it. Once inside the plane, Brian finds a survival pack that includes an array of tools, additional food, an emergency transmitter, and a .22 AR-7 rifle.

Back on shore, Brian activates the transmitter, but not knowing how to use it, he believes it is broken from water damage and tosses it aside. However, the distress beacon was still functional, and the signal is picked up by the pilot of a passing airplane, which he is rescued by. The epilogue explains that Brian had spent the remainder of the summer with his father but did not disclose his mother&#x27;s affair, and how surviving on his own for a total of fifty-four days had a permanent effect on him for the better.

== Sequels ==
Paulsen continued the story of Brian Robeson with four more novels, beginning with &quot;The River&quot; in 1991, which sees Brian returning to the wilderness to show his survival strategies to the military.

&quot;Brian&#x27;s Winter&quot; was published in 1996 and narrates how Brian would have survived if he was not rescued by that plane and if he had to survive the winter.

&quot;Brian&#x27;s Return&quot; was published in 1999, in which Brian describes his life conflict after the plane crash.

&quot;Brian&#x27;s Hunt&quot; was released in 2003. In the novel, Brian is out canoeing and then senses danger nearby when he finds a wounded dog.

The series concludes with &quot;&quot;, which provides information about the behind-the-scene stories and how Brian Robeson got there.

==Film adaptation==
A film adaptation titled &quot;A Cry in the Wild&quot; was released in 1990.

==Reception==
&quot;Hatchet&quot; was a recipient of the 1988 Newbery Honor. In 2012, it was ranked number 23 on a list of the top 100 children&#x27;s novels published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;.

<doc id="1225833" wikidata="Q1141171" url="?curid=1225833" title="SsangYong Rexton">
<text>The KGM Rexton, formerly SsangYong Rexton (Korean: 쌍용 렉스턴), is a mid-size SUV manufactured by South Korean manufacturer SsangYong Motor (currently KG Mobility) since late 2001. The name Rexton is derived from the Latin title &#x27;rex&#x27; and the English word &#x27;tone&#x27;, which is intended to mean &quot;the ruler&#x27;s tone&quot;.

In 2017, the second generation Rexton debuted in Seoul 2017, and to the European market in Frankfurt 2017. The new generation Rexton features SsangYong&#x27;s new body-on-frame platform, which it shares with the Musso pick-up. Other improvements include active safety driving pack, increased towing capacity, and electric parking brake system with auto hold. The Rexton is offered with a choice of a new 2.0L petrol turbo or 2.2L diesel engine and available in two or four-wheel drive. It is equipped with Mercedes-Benz 7G-Tronic automatic or Aisin 6-speed automatic transmission or 6-speed manual transmission.


== First generation (Y200; 2001) ==


The Y200 series Rexton was produced from 2001 to 2006. The car&#x27;s design was styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro&#x27;s Italdesign studio. It was available only with four-wheel drive and one of four engines: a 2.3-liter 112 kW (150 hp) petrol engine, a 2.7-liter and common rail diesel, a 2.9-liter diesel and a 3.2-liter and petrol engine. The 2.7 XDi was based on the Mercedes-Benz OM612 CDI engine but was significantly re-engineered by SsangYong. The car was also available under a Daewoo badge in certain European markets such as France, without any technical or equipment changes. Production of the Daewoo Rexton stopped in early 2003 to make way for the car coming in as a Ssangyong instead.

In June 2003, the Rexton was introduced in Europe under the Ssangyong badge. It is based on a slightly extended chassis of the SsangYong Musso. Initially, it was only available with a choice of two engines: a 2.9-liter five-cylinder diesel and 3.2-liter six-cylinder gasoline engine. Both engines were borrowed from the Musso which were licensed from Mercedes-Benz.

The transmission options for the diesel model were originally either a five-speed manual with a gearbox from the American company Tremec or a four-speed automatic with a gearbox from the Australian company BTR Automotive. The petrol model was only offered with the automatic transmission. In 2004, with the introduction of the 2.7-liter &quot;XDi&quot; diesel engine, a five-speed Tiptronic gearbox (NAG 5G-Tronic provided by Mercedes-Benz) became an optional extra with that engine.

=== SsangYong Rexton II, first facelift (Y250; 2006–2012) ===
In early 2006, SsangYong unveiled an upgraded Rexton. The vehicle features numerous technologies to reduce carbon emissions, such as a catalyzed diesel particulate filter and a variable-geometry turbocharger. Based on these upgrades, the South Korean government classifies the 2008 Rexton as a low-emissions vehicle, making it eligible for an exemption from a quasi tax related to environmental standards for five years after the purchase of the vehicle. Other improvements include enhanced parking brake technology, a tire pressure monitoring system (as seen on the SsangYong WZ concept car), an electronic toll collection system and a forward collision warning and avoidance system.

In Malaysia, the Rexton was assembled starting in August 2006 by Competitive Supreme Sdn Bhd (CSSB), also the sole importer and distributor of SsangYong vehicles in Malaysia.

In 2008, Project Kahn, famous for tuning luxury and sports cars, presented a modified Rexton 270 SPR at the 2008 British International Motor Show. It was so well received that in 2009, it became part of the British SsangYong range. It features added kit, chrome highlights and a &quot;sportier&quot; interior, but unusually, in the initial models, it does not have a radio/CD player, as it is intended that those that potential customers would want to put their own sound system in. However, the R-Line later gained a Kenwood double-DIN touch screen navigation system with steering wheel-mounted controls. The R-Line also has a more powerful version of the 2.7-liter straight-five turbo diesel engine producing and torque at 2400 rpm.

=== SsangYong Rexton W, second facelift (Y290; 2012–early 2017) ===
A revision version called the Rexton W, was released worldwide at Busan Motor Show 2012. And it was the first facelift model with Mahindra &amp; Mahindra of which SsangYong is a subsidiary. SsangYong re-designed front grille with new headlights, rear combination lamp and retuned chassis. The car introduced the new 2.0-liter XDi diesel engine Euro 5 with standard DPF come from the Korando and the 3.2-liter petrol engine retuned for Euro 5 standard. And it is equipped with Mercedes-Benz 5G-Tronic automatic which the same gearbox with the previous model or manual gearbox.

At the end of 2015, SsangYong introduced to the European market the 2.2-liter &quot;e-XDi&quot; diesel engine with Euro 6 compliance. This engine improved power and torque than the previous 2.0-liter &quot;XDi&quot; diesel engine. This 2.2-liter diesel also comes with the Mercedes-Benz 7G-Tronic automatic gearbox.

===Chinese copy controversy===
In 2005, SG Automotive released the Huanghai Aurora which heavily resembled the Rexton. However, SsangYong chose not to sue SG Automotive, citing China&#x27;s lawsuit system which is favorable to their companies. SsangYong only informed SAIC, which was the largest shareholder at the time, of the copyright issue with SG Automotive.

== Second generation (Y400; 2017) ==


The Y400 series Rexton traces its roots to the SsangYong LIV-1 concept car and the SsangYong LIV-2 concept from Paris Motor Show 2016. In 2017, 2nd generation Rexton debuted to Korean market in Seoul Motor Show 2017, and to global market in International Motor Show Germany 2017. With the car&#x27;s design, SsangYong claims that the Rexton got the inspiration from the Greek temple Parthenon.

The new generation Rexton features SsangYong&#x27;s new body-on-frame platform using Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS), which shares with SsangYong Musso pick-up. Other improvements include safety driving equipments, increased towing capacity (up to 3,500 kg) in both manual and automatic forms, and electric parking brake system with auto hold.

The Rexton is offered with a choice of a new 2.0 L &quot;e-XGDI 200T&quot; petrol turbo engine or 181 horsepower 2.2 L &quot;e-XDI 220&quot; diesel engine and available in two-wheel or part-time four-wheel drive. It is equipped with Mercedes-Benz 7G-Tronic automatic or AISIN 6-speed automatic transmission or 6-speed manual transmission.

===Awards===
In Korea, the Rexton was chosen as the Best Ergonomic Design Award by the Ergonomics Society of Korea. It also received Award of the Prime Minister in Korean Good Design Award 2017. G4 Rexton has earned Best Value award for two consecutive years. It won three titles at last year&#x27;s awards including the Best Value Off-roader and 4x4 of the Year 2018. SsangYong Rexton named &#x27;Best Value 4x4 2023&#x27; by 4x4 Magazine for 6 consecutive years. SsangYong Motors has collected yet another award for its flagship Rexton, which has been named as the &#x27;Best Value&#x27; off-roader, for an unprecedented sixth year running in the &#x27;4x4 of the Year 2023&#x27; awards, sponsored by BFGoodrich.

===Safety===
The second generation Rexton equipped with 9 airbags, including a driver knee-airbag and second-row side airbags. It also features intelligent safety driving system including Autonomous Emergency Brake System (AEBS), Forward Collision Warning System (FCWS), Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS), High Beam Assist (HBA), Lane Change Assist (LCA), and Rear Cross-Traffic Alert (RCTA).

In Korean New Car Assessment Program (KNCAP) the SsangYong G4 Rexton received top safety rating of Grade1 (5 stars, 88.5 pts.) on a 2017 registration.

===Mahindra Alturas G4 (2018–2022)===
Mahindra revealed a rebadged version of the 2nd generation Rexton called the Alturas G4 at the 2018 Auto Expo, India. The SUV is slotted above the Mahindra XUV500.

During its lifespan, it was offered in both 2WD and 4WD drivetrains and it was the flagship model of the brand until it was discontinued in late 2022 due to poor sales and marketing.

The Alturas G4 was assembled in Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Chakan Plant in India between 2018 and 2022, by using CKD methods from SsangYong&#x27;s Pyeongtaek plant.

===First facelift (Y450; 2020–present)===
The facelifted Rexton was unveiled in September 2019 as the 2020 model.

<text>Dog training is a kind of animal training, the application of behavior analysis which uses the environmental events of antecedents (trigger for a behavior) and consequences to modify the dog behavior, either for it to assist in specific activities or undertake particular tasks, or for it to participate effectively in contemporary domestic life. While training dogs for specific roles dates back to Roman times at least, the training of dogs to be compatible household pets developed with suburbanization in the 1950s.

A dog learns from interactions it has with its environment. This can be through classical conditioning, where it forms an association between two stimuli; non-associative learning, where its behavior is modified through habituation or sensitisation; and operant conditioning, where it forms an association between an antecedent and its consequence.

Most working dogs are now trained using reward-based methods, sometimes referred to as positive reinforcement training. Other reward-based training methods include clicker training, model-rival training, and relationship-based training.

Training methods that emphasize punishment include the Koehler method, electronic (shock collar) training, dominance-based training, and balanced training. The use of punishment is controversial with both the humaneness and effectiveness questioned by many behaviorists. Furthermore, numerous scientific studies have found that reward-based training is more effective and less harmful to the dog-owner relationship than punishment-based methods.

==Definition==
Dog training is the act of teaching a dog particular skills or behaviors. Dog training includes teaching a dog to react to particular commands and cues as well as to act independently by deliberately changing their natural behavior.

Dogs have been trained to perform a large number of practical functions including search and rescue, herding livestock, guarding, explosive or drug detection, and disability assistance. Dogs have also been trained to perform recreational functions, including companionship and shooting assistance.

Dog training usually involves the basic obedience training to establish control over the animal and can then progress to more advanced specialist training. Basic obedience training includes teaching a dog:
* Recall – teaching the dog to come on command
* Sit – teaching the dog to sit on command
* Heeling – teaching the dog to walk on or off lead with the handler
* Stay – teaching the dog not to stray on command
* Socialising – neutrality or excitement when appropriate during a reaction with the outside world

==History==
Although research into how dogs learn and into cross-species communication has changed the approach to dog training in recent decades, understanding the role of early trainers and scientists contributes to an appreciation of how particular methods and techniques developed.

===Before 1900===
In around 127-116 B.C., a Roman farmer, Marcus Varro, recorded advice on raising and training puppies for herding livestock. His writings indicate that not only was dog training for specific tasks well established, but that the value of early training was recognized.

In 1848, W. N. Hutchinson published his book &quot;Dog Breaking: The Most Expeditious, Certain and Easy Method, Whether Great Excellence or Only Mediocrity Be Required, With Odds and Ends for Those Who Love the Dog and the Gun&quot;. Primarily concerned with training hunting dogs such as pointers and setters, the book advocates a form of reward-based training, commenting on men who have &quot;a strong arm and a hard heart to punish, but no temper and no head to instruct&quot; and suggesting &quot;Be to his virtues ever kind. Be to his faults a little blind.&quot; Stephen Hammond, a writer for &quot;Forest and Stream&quot; magazine, advocated in his 1882 book &quot;Practical Training&quot; that hunting dogs be praised and rewarded with meat for doing the correct behavior. One of the earliest training manuals for training dogs was published in 1910.

=== War years ===
Konrad Most began training dogs for police work in Germany, and was appointed principal of the State Breeding and Training Establishment for police dogs in Berlin, where he carried out original research into training dogs for a broad range of service tasks. At the outbreak of war in 1914 he was charged with organising and directing the use of dogs to further the war effort. He headed the Experimental Institute for Armed Forces&#x27; Dogs during the Second World War, and afterwards ran the German Dog Farm, a centre for the training of working dogs, including assistance dogs for the blind. He played a leading role in the formation of the German Canine Research Society and Society for Animal Psychology. His 1910 publication, &quot;Training Dogs: A Manual&quot;, emphasized using instinctive behavior such as the prey drive to train desired behaviors, advocated the use of compulsion and inducements, differentiated between primary and secondary reinforcers, and described shaping behaviors, chaining components of an activity, and the importance of timing rewards and punishments. The book demonstrated an understanding of the principles of operant conditioning almost thirty years before they were formally outlined by B.F. Skinner in &quot;The Behavior of Organisms&quot;. While publishers of the 2001 reprint warn that some of the &quot;compulsive inducements&quot; such as the switch, the spiked collar and the forced compliance are unnecessarily harsh for today&#x27;s pet dogs, the basic principles of Most&#x27;s methods are still used in police and military settings.

Marian Breland Bailey played a major role in developing empirically validated and humane animal training methods and in promoting their widespread implementation. Marian was a graduate student under B.F. Skinner. Her first husband Keller Breland also came to study with Skinner and they collaborated with him, training pigeons to guide bombs. The Brelands saw the commercial possibilities of operant training, founding Animal Behavior Enterprises (ABE). In 1955, they opened the &quot;I.Q. Zoo&quot; as both a training facility and a showcase of trained animals. They were among the first to use trained animals in television commercials, and the first to train dolphins and whales as entertainment, as well as for the navy. Keller died in 1965, and in 1976 Marian married Bob Bailey, who had been director of marine mammal training for the navy. They pioneered the use of the clicker as a conditioned reinforcer for training animals at a distance. ABE went on to train thousands of animals of more than 140 species. Their work had significant public exposure through press coverage of ABE-trained animals, bringing the principles of behavior analysis and operant conditioning to a wide audience.

Konrad Lorenz, an Austrian scientist who is regarded as developing the foundations of ethological research, further popularized animal behaviorism with his books, &quot;Man Meets Dog&quot; and &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Ring&quot;. Lorenz stated that there were three essential commands to teach a dog: &quot;lie down&quot; (stay where you are), &quot;basket&quot; (go over there) and &quot;heel&quot; (come with me).

In 1935, the American Kennel Club began obedience trials, and in the following years popular magazines raised public awareness of the benefits of having a trained pet dog, and of the recreational possibilities of dog training as a hobby. After WWII, the increasing complexities of suburban living demanded that for a pet dog&#x27;s own protection and its owner&#x27;s convenience, the dog should be obedient. William Koehler had served as principal trainer at the War Dog Training Center, in California, and after the war became chief trainer for the Orange Empire Dog Club—at the time, the largest dog club in the United States—instructor for a number of breed clubs, and a dog trainer for the Walt Disney Studios.

In 1962, Koehler published &quot;The Koehler Method of Dog Training&quot;, in which he is highly critical of what he calls &quot;tid-bit training techniques&quot; based in &quot;the prattle of &#x27;dog psychologists&#x27;&quot;. Amongst the training innovations attributed to Koehler is the use of a long line in conjunction with a complete absence of oral communication as a way of instilling attentiveness prior to any leash training. Koehler insisted that participants in his training classes used &quot;emphatic corrections&quot;, including leash jerks and throw chains, explaining that tentative, nagging corrections were cruel in that they caused emotional disturbance to the dog. Vicki Hearne, a disciple of Koehler&#x27;s, commented on the widespread criticism of his corrections, with the explanation that it was the emotionally loaded language used in the book that led to a number of court cases, and to the book being banned in Arizona for a time. Despite the controversy, his basic method forms the core of many contemporary training systems.

===Post WWII===

In the 1950s, Blanche Saunders was a staunch advocate of pet-dog training, travelling throughout the U.S. to promote obedience classes. In &quot;The Complete Book of Dog Obedience&quot;, she said, &quot;Dogs learn by associating their act with a pleasing or displeasing result. They must be disciplined when they do wrong, but they must also be rewarded when they do right.&quot; Negative reinforcement procedures played a key part in Saunders&#x27; method, primarily the jerking of the choke chain. The mantra taught to students was &quot;Command! Jerk! Praise!&quot; She felt that food should not be an ongoing reward, but that it was acceptable to use &quot;a tidbit now and then to overcome a problem&quot;. Saunders perhaps began the shift away from military and police training methods, stressing repeatedly the importance of reinforcement for good behavior in training—a move toward the positive training methods used today.

In 1965, John Paul Scott and John Fuller identified the critical periods for learning and social development in puppies, and published &quot;Genetics and the Social Behavior of the Dog&quot;, a landmark study of dog behavior.

The 1980 television series &quot;Training Dogs the Woodhouse Way&quot; made Barbara Woodhouse a household name in the UK, and the first international celebrity dog trainer. Known for her &quot;no bad dogs&quot; philosophy, Woodhouse was highly critical of &quot;bad owners&quot;, particularly those she saw as &quot;overly sentimental&quot;. She described the &quot;psychoanalyzing of dogs&quot; as &quot;a lot of rubbish&quot;. Her no-nonsense style made her a pop-culture icon, with her emphatic &quot;sit&quot; and catch cry of &quot;walkies&quot; becoming part of the popular vernacular.

The monks of New Skete, who were breeders and trainers of German Shepherds in Cambridge, New York, published &quot;How to Be Your Dog&#x27;s Best Friend: A Training Manual for Dog Owners&quot; in 1978 and it became an immediate best seller. Despite advocating a philosophy that &quot;understanding is the key to communication and compassion with your dog&quot;, they endorsed confrontational punishments which were later shown to elicit dangerously aggressive responses in many dogs.

In the 1980s, veterinarian and animal behaviorist Ian Dunbar discovered that despite evidence on the peak learning periods in animals, few dog trainers worked with puppies before they were six months old. Dunbar founded &quot;Sirius Dog Training&quot;, the first off-leash training program specifically for puppies, which emphasizes the importance of teaching bite inhibition, sociality, and other basic household manners, to dogs under six months of age. Dunbar has written numerous books, and is known for his international seminar presentations and award-winning videos on puppy and dog behavior and training.

Prior to the 1980s, Karen Pryor was a marine-mammal trainer who used Skinner&#x27;s operant principles to teach dolphins and develop marine-mammal shows. In 1984, she published her book, &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot the Dog: The New Art of Teaching and Training&quot;, an explanation of operant-conditioning procedures written for the general public. In the book, Pryor explains why punishment as a way to get people to change often fails, and describes specific positive methods for changing the behavior of husbands, children and pets. Pryor&#x27;s dog training materials and seminars showed how operant procedures can be used to provide training based on positive reinforcement of good behavior. Pryor and Gary Wilkes introduced clicker training to dog trainers with a series of seminars in 1992 and 1993. Wilkes used aversives as well as rewards, and the philosophical differences soon ended the partnership.

===21st century===

The 21st century has seen a dramatic increase in the adoption of reward-based training. The International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants, the APDT, BC SPCA in Canada, and in the UK the RSPCA, Dogs Trust Blue Cross and the APDT UK, PACT and the Pet Professional Guild now advocate this kind of training exclusively. Veterinarians are also switching to advocating reward-based training, and the 2015 AAHA Canine and Feline Behavior Management Guidelines include guidelines that state that trainers should only use positive methods.

Also, in the 21st century, many countries have adopted laws banning dog training methods using aversives such as the use of shock collars, prong collars and choke collars. Even where legal, &quot;Organizations advocating against the use of prong and choke collars include: CHS, RSPCA UK, RSPCA Australia, RSPCA South Australia, the Canadian Advisory Council on National Shelter Standards, CVMA, ACVB, ABTC, PACT, APDT UK, and APDT&quot;.

The 21st century has seen the proliferation of television programs and accompanying books that feature dog training and rehabilitation. &quot;Unfortunately, if dog owners decide to consult a book, some of the most popular – and enduring – dog training books include erroneous information&quot;.

21st century dog training TV shows that are primarily entertainment include Joel Silverman&#x27;s &quot;Good Dog U&quot;, &quot;Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Me or the Dog&quot; featuring Victoria Stillwell, &quot;The Underdog Show&quot;, &quot;Dogs in the City&quot;, and &quot;SuperFetch&quot;. The Association of Pet Dog Trainers advises that television programs are produced primarily for entertainment, and while all programs will have good and not-so-good points, the viewer should critically evaluate the information before deciding which training tips to adopt.

==How dogs learn==

===Operant conditioning===
Operant conditioning (or instrumental conditioning) is a form of learning in which an individual&#x27;s behavior is modified by its consequences. Two complementary motivations drive instrumental learning: the maximization of positive outcomes and minimization of aversive ones. There are two ways in which behavior is reinforced or strengthened: positive reinforcement occurs when a behavior is strengthened by producing some desirable consequence; negative reinforcement occurs when a behavior is strengthened by avoiding some undesirable consequence. There are two ways in which behavior is decreased or weakened: negative punishment occurs when a behavior is weakened by not producing a reinforcing consequence; and positive punishment occurs when a behavior is weakened by producing a consequence that is a disincentive. In combination, these basic reinforcing and punishing contingencies provide four ways for modifying behavior. Reinforcement increases the relative probability or frequency of the behavior it follows, while punishment decreases the relative probability or frequency of the behavior it follows.

Typical positive reinforcement events will satisfy some physiological or psychological need, so it can be food, a game, or a demonstration of affection. Different dogs will find different things reinforcing. Negative reinforcement occurs when a dog discovers that a particular response ends the presentation of an aversive stimulus. An aversive is anything that the dog does not like, such as verbal admonishment, or a tightened choke chain.

Punishment is operationally defined as an event that lowers the probability of the behavior that it follows. It is not &quot;punishment&quot; in the common sense of the word, and does not mean physical or psychological harm and most certainly does not mean abuse. Punishment simply involves the presentation of an undesired consequence (positive punishment) when the wrong behavior is performed, such as a snap of the leash, or the removal of a desired consequence (negative punishment) when the wrong behavior is performed, such as the trainer eating the cheese that would have been the reward. A behavior that has previously been developed may cease if reinforcement stops; this is called extinction. A dog that paws its owner for attention will eventually stop if it no longer receives attention.

===Classical conditioning===

Classical conditioning (or Pavlovian conditioning) is a form of learning in which one stimulus, the conditioned stimulus, comes to signal the occurrence of a second stimulus, the unconditioned stimulus. Classical conditioning is when a dog learns to associate things in its environment, or discovers some things just go together. A dog may become afraid of rain through an association with thunder and lightning, or it may respond to the owner putting on a particular pair of shoes by fetching its leash. Classical conditioning is used in dog training to help a dog make specific associations with a particular stimulus, particularly in overcoming fear of people and situations.

===Non-associative learning===

Non-associative learning is a change in a response to a stimulus that does not involve associating the presented stimulus with another stimulus or event such as reward or punishment. Habituation is non-associative learning. An example is where a dog that reacts excitedly to a door bell is subjected to repeated ringing without accompanying visitors, and stops reacting to the meaningless stimuli. It becomes habituated to the noise. On the other side of habituation is sensitization. Some dogs&#x27; reactions to the stimuli become stronger instead of them habituating to the repeated stimuli or event. Desensitization is the process of pairing positive experiences with an object, person, or situation that causes fear or anxiety. Consistent exposure to the feared object in conjunction with rewards allows the animal to become less stressed, thereby becoming desensitized in the process. This type of training can be effective for dogs who are fearful of fireworks.

Learned irrelevance is where dogs that are overexposed to a stimulus or cue learn the cue is irrelevant because the exposure has proven to be uneventful. So a dog owner who continually says &quot;Sit, sit&quot; without response or consequence, inadvertently teaches the dog to ignore the cue.

Learned helplessness occurs when a dog ceases to respond in a situation where it has no option to avoid a negative event. For learned helplessness to occur, the event must be both traumatic and outside the dog&#x27;s control. Family dogs that are exposed to unpredictable or uncontrolled punishment are at risk of developing disturbances associated with the learned helplessness disorder. Punishment which is poorly coordinated with identifiable avoidance cues or response options, such as when punishment takes place long after the event, meet the criteria of inescapable trauma.

===Observational learning===

Observational learning is the learning that occurs through observing the behavior of others. This form of learning does not need reinforcement to occur; instead, a model animal is required. While the model may not be intentionally trying to instill any particular behavior, many behaviors that are observed are remembered and imitated. The domestic dog is a social species and its social dependency makes it aware of the behavior of others, which contributes to its own behavior and learning abilities. There is, however, ongoing discussion about how much, and how, dogs can learn by interacting with each other and with people.

The term &quot;observational learning&quot; encompasses several closely related concepts: allelomimetic behavior or mimicking where, for example, puppies follow or copy others of their kind; social facilitation where the presence of another dog causes an increase in the intensity of a behavior; and local enhancement which includes pieces of social facilitation, mimicking, and trial-and-error learning, but is different from true observational learning in that the dog actively participates in the behavior in the presence of the other dog or other environmental cues. Four necessary conditions for observational learning are: attention, retention, motivation, and production. That is, the dog must pay attention to the dog or person performing the modelled behavior; retain the information gathered about the behavior during the observation; be motivated to reproduce the behavior in a time and place removed from the original; and finally, produce the behavior, or some reasonable facsimile thereof.

Pups between the ages of 9–12 weeks who were permitted to observe their narcotics-detecting mothers at work generally proved more capable at learning the same skills at six months of age than control puppies the same age who were not previously allowed to watch their mothers working. A 2001 study recorded the behavior of dogs in detour tests, in which a favorite toy or food was placed behind a V-shaped fence. The demonstration of the detour by humans significantly improved the dogs&#x27; performance in the trials. The experiments showed that dogs are able to rely on information provided by human action when confronted with a new task. Significantly, they did not copy the exact path of the human demonstrator, but adopted the detour behavior shown by humans to reach their goal. A 1977 experiment by Adler and Adler found that puppies who watched other puppies learn to pull a food cart into their cages by an attached ribbon proved considerably faster at the task when later given the opportunity themselves. At 38 days of age, the &quot;demonstrator&quot; puppies took an average of 697 seconds to succeed, while the observers succeeded in an average of 9 seconds.

===Cognitive learning===
Dogs are capable of cognitive learning, which is distinct from conditioning methods such as operant and classical conditioning. Cognitive learning is a process wherein dogs acquire and process information, rather than develop conditioned responses to stimuli.

One example of cognitive learning in dogs is the fast mapping inferential reasoning demonstrated by Chaser and Rico in controlled research environments. Both Rico and Chaser demonstrated the ability to infer the names of objects without conditioning and remember them indefinitely.

==Training methods==

===Positive reinforcement===
Positive reinforcement training is also known as humane training, force-free training, and reward-based training. Positive reinforcement training employs the use of rewards to reinforce wanted behavior. For unwanted behavior, this training method uses four other techniques: extinction (letting the behavior go away by itself); training an incompatible behavior; putting the behavior on cue (then almost never giving the cue); shaping the absence of the behavior (reinforcing everything that is not the undesired behavior); or changing the environment/motivation. It is based in Thorndike&#x27;s law of effect, which says that actions that produce rewards tend to increase in frequency and actions that do not produce rewards decrease in frequency.

Positive reinforcement (motivational) training has its roots in marine mammal training, where compulsion and corrections are both difficult and dangerous. Positive reinforcement training requires time and patience to control the rewards the dog receives for behavior, but has no side effects (such as fear or aggression).

Some activities such as jumping up or chasing squirrels are intrinsically rewarding, the activity is its own reward, and with some activities the environment may provide reinforcement such as when the response from a dog next door encourages barking. To change this kind of self-rewarding behavior, since punishment comes with side effects such as &quot;problematic behaviours such as fear and aggression&quot; and extinction does not work in these cases, positive trainers will either train an alternate incompatible behavior, train the opposite behavior (and then not cue it), or change the environment.

&quot;All of the animals used for commercials, TV shows, and movies are trained with positive reinforcement.&quot;

The majority of trainers of search-and-rescue dogs prefer to use positive reinforcement and most working dogs are now trained using reward-based methods. These include police dogs, military dogs, guide dogs, and drug detection dogs.

The movement of military dog training to positive reinforcement methods is partly because aversive methods cause &quot;fear or distress and poor performance in military working dogs&quot;. Military dogs trained with positive reinforcement &quot;demonstrated increased confidence and overall performance.&quot;

===Clicker training===
Clicker training is a type of positive reinforcement training. Like all positive reinforcement training, clicker training is based on operant conditioning, but it specifically uses a clicker device as a marker and bridge. Clicker training can also be referred to as marker training. The system uses secondary reinforcer (the clicker) as both a marker/signal and a bridge, to let the animal know that s/he performed the desired behavior correctly and therefore a reward is coming, and to avoid inadvertently reinforcing (rewarding) another behavior that may occur after the desired behavior occurs but before the reinforcer is delivered. Primary reinforcers are reinforcers that are required for life, such as food. Secondary reinforcers are things the animal being trained enjoys but that are not required for life, such as toys, praise, etc. The term &#x27;clicker&#x27; comes from a small metal cricket adapted from a child&#x27;s toy that the trainer uses to precisely mark the desired behavior. Positive reinforcement trainers that don&#x27;t use clickers still usually use some kind of a marker, such as a whistle, a word, or even a light as the secondary reinforcer, which becomes &quot;conditioned&quot; once the animal learns that its arrival signals the chance to earn a primary reinforcer. The trainer delivers a primary reinforcer, such as treat, after the noise or signal.

Critics of clicker training (and positive reinforcement training in general) claim that it is prone to the overjustification effect, although this is a term used in the context of humans, not animal training. It&#x27;s for this very reason (to prevent this effect) that it&#x27;s standard practice for trainers do the following: after initial training with a fixed ratio of reinforcement is completed, the reward ratio is switched to a variable ratio, which produces extremely resilient behavior.

Clicker training is so precise that it can be used to &quot;shape&quot; behavior. New trainers have used the precision possible with clickers to introduce techniques that dogs focus calmly, like the &quot;look at that game&quot; and &quot;click to calm&quot;.

===Model-rival training===

Based on the principles of social learning, model-rival training uses a model, or a rival for attention, to demonstrate the desired behavior. The method was used by Irene Pepperberg to train Alex the African Grey Parrot to label a large number of objects. McKinley and Young undertook a pilot study on the applicability of a modified version of the model-rival method to the training of domestic dogs, noting that the dog&#x27;s origins as a member of large and complex social groups promote observational learning. The model-rival training involved an interaction between the trainer, the dog, and a person acting as a model-rival, that is, a model for desired behavior and a rival for the trainer&#x27;s attention. In view of the dog, a dialogue concerning a particular toy commenced between the trainer and the model-rival. The trainer praised or scolded the model-rival depending on whether the model-rival had named the toy correctly. It was found that the performance times for completion of the task were similar for dogs trained with either operant conditioning or the model rival method. In addition, the total training time required for task completion was comparable for both methods.

===Relationship-based training===
Relationship-based training is built upon the ideas of symbolic interactionism. This approach takes advantage of the ways dogs and their trainers communicate, understand each other, and make necessary changes. Building on a positive relationship between them, the method sets out to achieve results that benefit both the dog and the trainer, while at the same time enhancing and strengthening their relationship. The basic principles include ensuring that the dog&#x27;s basic needs have been met before beginning a training session, finding out what motivates the dog and using it to elicit behaviors, interpreting the dog&#x27;s body language to improve communication between dog and trainer, using positive reinforcement to encourage desired behavior, training incompatible behaviors to replace unwanted behaviors, and controlling the dog&#x27;s environment to limit the possibility of unwanted behaviours. A relationship-based approach to dog training is not necessarily reliant on using particular training aids or treats but posits that the connection between dog and trainer is sufficiently powerful to achieve the training goals.

===Koehler method===
The Koehler method uses primarily punishment and negative reinforcement (the removing of an aversive) to train dogs. The 1962 book, &quot;Koehler Method of Dog Training&quot;, is the basis of the method taught in both class and private training formats. The method is based in the philosophy that a dog acts on its right to choose its actions and that a dog&#x27;s learned behavior is an act of choice based on its own learning experience. When those choices are influenced by the expectation of reward, the behavior will most likely be repeated (although the Koehler method uses very few rewards). When a dog&#x27;s choices are influenced by the anticipation of punishment, they will most likely cease. Once the dog has learned that its choices result in comfort or discomfort it can be taught to make the correct decisions.

In the Koehler method, one example is teaching a dog to lie down. The trainer pulls the dog&#x27;s front feet forward and pushes down on its back. Once the dog is on the ground, the trainer gives praise. After doing this many times, the dog learns that the trainer wants it to lie down by itself. At that point, if the dog doesn&#x27;t obey right away, the trainer sharply tugs on the choke collar.

Action→memory→desire encapsulates the learning pattern used by the method; the dog acts, remembers the consequences, and forms the desire to repeat or avoid those consequences. Adherents believe that once the behavior has been correctly taught, it should be performed, thus making any punishing correction, fair, reasonable, and expected.

While the Koehler method has been used since 1962, some (or all) of the punishment procedures described in the book are now considered not necessary, humane, or appropriate by many trainers. These punishers include the use of a throw chain (applying a sharp hit to the rear to surprise the dog without them knowing who hit them), electric shocks, slingshots, and suspending the dog off the ground.

===Shock collars (electronic training)===

Electronic training involves the use of an electronic device as an aversive, usually shock collars. This type of dog collar can be triggered remotely at the trainers discretion, or are triggered by barking, or fencing that activates when a dog crosses a buried wire. The most common form of electronic training is the shock collar, although there are also collars that use vibration, tone, or a spray of liquid, typically citronella when triggered. The use of electric shock aversives (shock collars) for training dogs is the subject of considerable controversy. Many European countries view shock collars as animal cruelty and have banned their use. Supporters claim that the use of shock collars allows training at a distance and the potential to eliminate self-rewarding behavior, and point out that properly used, they have less risk of stress and injury than mechanical devices, such as choke collars (illegal in some countries ) or prong collars (prong collars are also illegal in many countries). Opponents of shock collars cite the risks of physical and psychological trauma associated with incorrect or abusive use.

A 2017 meta-review of seventeen peer-reviewed studies found that, even when used correctly, &quot;The results show that using aversive training methods (e.g., positive punishment and negative reinforcement) can jeopardize both the physical and mental health of dogs.&quot;

Three of the seventeen studies are summarized here:

In a 2007 study, laboratory-bred Beagles were divided into three groups. Group A received an electric shock when the dogs touched the prey (a rabbit dummy fixed to a motion device). Group H received a shock when they did not obey a previously trained recall command during hunting. Dogs in group R received the electric shock arbitrarily, i.e. the shock was administered unpredictably and out of context. Group A did not show a significant rise in stress-indicating salivary cortisol levels, while group R and group H did show a significant rise. This led to the conclusion that animals which were able to clearly associate the electric stimulus with their action, i.e. touching the prey, and consequently were able to predict and control the stressor, did not show considerable or persistent stress indicators, while animals that were not able to control the situation to avoid the shock did show significant stress. The 2017 Ziv meta-review suggested that this 2007 study was flawed. &quot;In the first group, the predictability of the shock could have led to the relatively small increase in cortisol levels, but another explanation is possible. While an increase in the concentration of cortisol can represent an increase in stress&quot;, it can also represent the physical activity level of the dog. Indeed, elevation in cortisol concentration can occur as a result of both low-intensity and high-intensity exercise.

In 2004, a study was published that was based on the observation of a variety of breeds trained for protection work using shock collars, which showed that although using shock collars to train guard dogs can work, it can cause side effects of fear and aggression, indicating heightened uncertainty and reactivity. The study summarized by stating &quot;The conclusions, therefore are, that being trained is stressful, that receiving shocks is a painful experience to dogs, and that the S-dogs evidently have learned that the presence of their owner (or his commands) announces reception of shocks, even outside of the normal training context.&quot; In 2005, textbook author Stephen R. Lindsay gives his opinion of this study, writing &quot;Schilder and Van der Borg (2004) have published a report of disturbing findings regarding the short-term and long- term effects of shock used in the context of working dogs that is destined to become a source of significant controversy... The absence of reduced drive or behavioral suppression with respect to critical activities associated with shock (e.g., bite work) makes one skeptical about the lasting adverse effects the authors claim to document. Although they offer no substantive evidence of trauma or harm to dogs, they provide loads of speculation, anecdotes, insinuations of gender and educational inadequacies, and derogatory comments regarding the motivation and competence of IPO trainers in its place.&quot;

A 2009 study by Herron et al. suggest that aversives such as shock collars, as well as lesser aversives such as yelling, risk side effects of increasing behavior problems including aggression.

===Dominance-based training===
The concepts of &quot;pack&quot; and &quot;dominance&quot; in relation to dog training originated in the 1940s and were popularized by the Monks of New Skete in the 1970s. The model is based on a theory that &quot;dogs are wolves&quot; and since wolves live in hierarchical packs where an alpha male rules over everyone else, then humans must dominate dogs in order to modify their behavior. However, recent studies have shown that wolves in the wild actually live in nuclear families where the mother and father are both considered the pack leaders, and their offspring&#x27;s status depends on their birth order which does not involve fighting to attain a higher rank, because the young wolves naturally follow their parents&#x27; lead.

Animal behaviorists assert that using dominance to modify a behavior can suppress the behavior without addressing the underlying cause of the problem. It can exacerbate the problem and increase the dog&#x27;s fear, anxiety, and aggression. Dogs that are subjected to repeated threats and harsh methods such as the alpha roll may react with aggression not because they are trying to be dominant, but because they feel threatened and afraid.

Researchers have described several reasons why the dominance model is a poor choice for dog training. First, a relationship based on dominance is established to gain priority access to scarce resources, not to impose particular behaviors on the less dominant animal, so the dominance model is irrelevant for most of the behaviors that people want from their dogs, such as coming when called or walking calmly on a leash. Second dominance-submission relationships, once established, are constantly tested and must be regularly reinforced. Thus people, particularly children and the elderly, may not be able to retain their rank and are at risk of being injured if they attempt to do so. Third, dominant individuals gain priority access to resources, but only while they are present, establishing dominance over a dog does not guarantee its behavior when the dominant individual is distant or absent.

The idea of dominance is dogs is not disputed in peer-reviews papers, but rather, popular argument is over its definition and implications. &quot; Although dominance is correctly a property of relationships, it has been erroneously used to describe a supposed trait of individual dogs, even though there is little evidence that such a trait exists&quot;.

Defenders of dominance-based training argue that critics are motivated by political correctness. Portuguese author on the behavior of animals Roger Abrantes gives this argument and also argues that the term is poorly defined. Colin Tennant, who is the chairman of the Canine and Feline Behaviour Association, said: &quot;It is political correctness. If you treat a dog like a human it will treat you like a dog&quot;. Psychologist and dog trainer Stanley Coren in the 2001 book &quot;How to Speak Dog&quot; wrote, &quot;You are the alpha dog... You must communicate that you are the pack leader and dominant&quot;. Mexican-American dog trainer and author Cesar Millan wrote that, &quot;It&#x27;s essential that the humans be Pack Leaders, with the dog following. If a dog does not have strong pack leadership from its humans, it may become unbalanced, which can lead to confusion, anxiety, or aggression and behavior problems in the dog&quot;.

== Factors ==
Training can take as many forms as there are trainers, however a detailed study of animal trainers found common characteristics of successful methods: thoughtful interpretation of what the animal does prior to training, accurate timing, and consistent communication.

=== Communication ===

Dogs have become closely associated with humans through domestication and have also become sensitive to human communicative signals. Generally, they have a lot of exposure to human speech, especially during play, and are believed to have a good ability to recognize human speech. Two studies investigated the ability of a single dog that was believed to be exceptional in its understanding of language. Both studies revealed the potential for at least some dogs to develop an understanding of a large number of simple commands on the basis of just the sounds emitted by their owners. However, the studies suggested that visual cues from the owner may be important for the understanding of more complex spoken commands.

=== Understanding ===

Consistency of the owner&#x27;s application, their level of understanding, and training/behavior and level of engagement can influence the effectiveness of any technique.

===Innate characteristics===
In considering the natural behaviors of specific breeds of dogs, it is possible to train them to perform specialized, highly useful, tasks. For example, Labrador retrievers are the favored breed for the detection of explosives. This is because of a combination of factors including their food drive which enables them to keep focused on a task despite noise and other distractions.

Most working breeds of dogs like Dobermans are able to be trained to find people with their sense of smell (as opposed to their sense of sight).

Cocker Spaniels are able to be trained as part of a termite detection team. Their relatively small size enables them to fit into small spaces, and their light weight allows them to walk on areas of ceiling which would be dangerous to anything heavier. In fact, although unusual, termite detection dogs are much more reliable at detecting termites than humans who rely on a basic system of tapping and listening.

Because of their ability to learn signals by sight and for their energetic and athletic natures, German Shepherds are able to be trained for work alongside search and rescue teams and human apprehension teams.

== Individualized or class training ==
Individualized or one-to-one training is helpful for the trainer to focus on an individual dog&#x27;s abilities and needs, as well as address a specific owner&#x27;s preferences and circumstance. Any behaviour problems are best addressed by a dog behaviourist. Class training can be effective in encouraging socialization and play with a peer group. Classes are often offered at a more affordable rate and can cover both problem behaviors and teach new skills. Classes can range from puppy and beginner training to more advanced training and skill training such as performing tricks, preparing for dog sports such as agility or flyball, or therapy work.

== Specialized training ==

Dogs are also trained for special purposes such as CGC Certification; for dog sports, including but not limited to competition obedience, dog agility, herding, tracking, and flyball; and to undertake particular roles such as detection dogs, assistance dogs, hunting dogs, police dogs, SAR (search and rescue dogs) or guard dogs.

<text>A speech community is a group of people who share a set of linguistic norms and expectations regarding the use of language. The concept is mostly associated with sociolinguistics and anthropological linguistics.

Exactly how to define &quot;speech community&quot; is debated in the literature. Definitions of speech community tend to involve varying degrees of emphasis on the following:
* Shared community membership
* Shared linguistic communication

A typical speech community can be a small town, but sociolinguists such as William Labov claim that a large metropolitan area, for example New York City, can also be considered one single speech community.

Early definitions have tended to see speech communities as bounded and localized groups of people who live together and come to share the same linguistic norms because they belong to the same local community. It has also been assumed that within a community a homogeneous set of norms should exist. These assumptions have been challenged by later scholarship that has demonstrated that individuals generally participate in various speech communities simultaneously and at different times in their lives. Speech communities have different norms, which they tend to share only partially. Communities may be delocalized and unbounded, rather than local, and often comprise different sub-communities with differing speech norms. With the recognition of the fact that speakers actively use language to construct and manipulate social identities by signalling membership in particular speech communities, the idea of the bounded speech community with homogeneous speech norms has become largely abandoned for a model based on the speech community as a fluid community of practice.

A speech community comes to share a specific set of norms for language use through living and interacting together, and speech communities may therefore emerge among all groups that interact frequently and share certain norms and ideologies. Such groups can be villages, countries, political or professional communities, communities with shared interests, hobbies, lifestyles, or even just groups of friends. Speech communities may share both particular sets of vocabulary and grammatical conventions, as well as speech styles and genres and norms for how and when to speak in particular ways.

==History of definitions==
The adoption of the concept of the &quot;speech community&quot; as a unit of linguistic analysis emerged in the 1960s.

===John Gumperz===
John Gumperz described how dialectologists had taken issue with the dominant approach in historical linguistics that saw linguistic communities as homogeneous and localized entities in a way that allowed for drawing neat tree diagrams based on the principle of &quot;descent with modification&quot; and shared innovations.

Dialectologists realized that dialect traits spread through diffusion and that social factors were instead decisive in how that happened. They also realized that traits spread as waves from centers and that often several competing varieties would exist in some communities. This insight prompted Gumperz to problematize the notion of the linguistic community as the community that carries a single speech variant, and instead to seek a definition that could encompass heterogeneity. This could be done by focusing on the interactive aspect of language, because interaction in speech is the path along which diffused linguistic traits travel. Gumperz defined the community of speech:

Gumperz here identifies two important components of the speech community: members share both a set of linguistics forms and a set of social norms. Gumperz also sought to set up a typological framework for describing how linguistic systems can be in use within a single speech community. He introduced the concept of linguistic range, the degree to which the linguistic systems of the community differ so that speech communities can be multilingual, diglossic, multidialectal (including sociolectal stratification), or homogeneous, depending on the degree of difference among the different language systems used in the community. Secondly the notion of compartmentalization described the degree to which the use of different varieties are set off from each other as discrete systems in interaction (e.g. diglossia where varieties correspond to specific social contexts, or multilingualism where varieties correspond to discrete social groups within the community), or they are habitually mixed in interaction (e.g. code-switching, bilingualism, syncretic language).

===Noam Chomsky===
Gumperz&#x27;s formulation was, however, effectively overshadowed by Noam Chomsky&#x27;s redefinition of the scope of linguistics as being :
===William Labov===
Another influential conceptualization of the linguistic community was that of William Labov, which can be seen as a hybrid of the Chomskyan structural homogeneity and Gumperz&#x27;s focus on shared norms informing variable practices. Labov wrote:
Like that of Gumperz, Labov&#x27;s formulation stressed that a speech community was defined more by shared norms than by shared linguistic forms. However, like Chomsky, Labov also saw each of the formally distinguished linguistic varieties within a speech community as homogeneous, invariant and uniform. The model worked well for Labov&#x27;s purpose of showing that African American Vernacular English can be seen not as a structurally-degenerate form of English but rather as a well-defined linguistic code with its own particular structure.

==Critique==
Probably because of their considerable explanatory power, Labov&#x27;s and Chomsky&#x27;s understandings of the speech community became widely influential in linguistics. But gradually a number of problems with those models became apparent.

Firstly, it became increasingly clear that the assumption of homogeneity inherent in Chomsky and Labov&#x27;s models was untenable. The African American speech community, which Labov had seen as defined by the shared norms of African American Vernacular English (AAVE), was shown to be an illusion, as ideological disagreements about the status of AAVE among different groups of speakers attracted public attention.

Secondly, the concept of the speech community was large-scale communities. By extending the concept, Gumperz&#x27;s definition could no longer be evoked.

Thirdly, Chomsky&#x27;s and Labov&#x27;s models made it clear that intrapersonal variation is common. The choice of linguistic variant is often a choice made within a specific speech context.

The force of those critiques with the concept of &quot;speech communities&quot; appeared because of many contradictions. Some scholars recommended abandoning the concept altogether and instead conceptualizing it as &quot;the product of the communicative activities engaged in by a given group of people.&quot; Others acknowledged the community&#x27;s &quot;ad hoc&quot; status as &quot;some kind of social group whose speech characteristics are of interest and can be described in a coherent manner&quot;.

==Practice theory==
Practice theory, as developed by social thinkers such as Pierre Bourdieu, Anthony Giddens, and Michel de Certeau, and the notion of the community of practice as developed by Jean Lave and Étienne Wenger has been applied to the study of the language community by linguists William Hanks and Penelope Eckert.

Eckert aimed at an approach to sociolinguistic variation that did not include any social variable (e.g. class, gender, locality). Instead, she built a model that could locate variables that show significant issue to the group of individuals. For Eckert, the crucial defining characteristics of the community is persistent through time to comprehend together.

Hanks&#x27;s concept of the linguistic community is different from that of Eckert and Gumperz, and studies the ways that shared practice produces linguistic meaning. Hanks studies how linguistic practices are related to varieties, which are produced through shared practices.

==Language variation==
The notion of speech community is most generally used as a tool to define a unit of analysis within which to analyse language variation and change. Stylistic features differ among speech communities based on factors such as the group&#x27;s ethnicity and social status, common interests and the level of formality expected within the group and by its larger society.

Common interests and the level of formality also result in stylistic differences among speech communities. In Western culture, for example, employees at a law office would likely use more formal language than a group of teenage skateboarders because most Westerners expect more formality and professionalism from practitioners of law than from an informal circle of adolescent friends. This special use of language by certain professions for particular activities is known in linguistics as register; in some analyses, the group of speakers of a register is known as a discourse community, while the phrase &quot;speech community&quot; is reserved for varieties of a language or dialect that speakers inherit by birth or adoption.

<doc id="1225848" wikidata="Q5435071" url="?curid=1225848" title="Farfel the Dog">
<text>Farfel the Dog is a hound dog ventriloquist&#x27;s dummy created by Jimmy Nelson. The Farfel character is best known for television commercials for Nestlé&#x27;s Quik which ran from 1953 to 1965. An original talking Farfel can be seen at the Chocolate Experience Museum, located in Burlington, Wisconsin.

==Creation==
In 1950, while working a late show in a Wichita, Kansas nightclub with his human dummy Danny O&#x27;Day, ventriloquist Jimmy Nelson picked up a stuffed dog left by a patron on the piano, and improvised a low-pitched voice to make it talk. This gave him the idea for a new character which he commissioned from Chicago dummy maker Frank Marshall. Nelson named it &quot;Farfel&quot;, after the Jewish pasta dish he had seen on the menu of resorts in the Borscht Belt on his tour route. Farfel was an instant hit, and contributed to the rise in Nelson&#x27;s popularity as he began to transition from live performance touring to television. Farfel would frequently say: &quot;No, I wouldn&#x27;t say that&quot;, based on the Great Gildersleeve character Peavey the Druggist&#x27;s drawled catchphrase &quot;Well now I wouldn&#x27;t say that.&quot;

==Nestlé commercials==
Beginning in 1955, Farfel sang the last word of the Nestlé jingle, after the first two lines were sung by Nelson&#x27;s human dummy Danny O&#x27;Day:

Danny: &quot;N-E-S-T-L-E-S, Nestlé&#x27;s makes the very best...Farfel: Choc&#x27;-late

At the end, Farfel&#x27;s mouth would close with a distinctive clap, uncharacteristic of proper ventriloquist&#x27;s technique. The sound was the result of Nelson&#x27;s nervousness at his audition for the Nestlé executives; his hands sweated, resulting in his finger slipping off of the mouth control. The executives liked the effect so much, they insisted that Nelson keep it in. The commercials ran for 10 years from 1955 to 1965. Farfel made a brief comeback in the mid-1990s for a Nestlé&#x27;s candy Christmas promo, with a send-in offer for a stuffed Farfel doll.

==In popular culture==
Archie Bleyer of Cadence Records originally wanted Nelson to appear on the Everly Brothers&#x27; 1959 recording of &quot;Bird Dog&quot; and use the voice of Farfel on the choruses, but that idea fell through.

In the &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; episode &quot;The Consultant&quot;, Bailey Quarters sings the Nestle&#x27;s jingle, and places her hands together to imitate Farfel when singing the last word. She then says to the consultant, &quot;Farfel. Remember that guy? The dog.&quot;

In an episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, entitled &quot;The Dog&quot;, Farfel was also the name of the dog that Jerry ends up &quot;dogsitting&quot; after the dog&#x27;s owner suffers a heart attack while sitting next to Jerry on an airplane.

In the &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; episode “The Terrorist Attack”, Larry David sings the Nestle&#x27;s jingle whilst apologizing and ends his song with the distinctive clap.

<text>The Pelmorex Radio Network was a system of Canadian radio stations in Northern Ontario, owned and operated by Pelmorex.

==History== 
In 1989, Pierre Morrissette founded his own communications company, Pelmorex Media Inc., and acquired several French and English-language radio stations that were serving various small and medium-size markets in northern Ontario. Pelmorex acquired the first stations from Mid-Canada Radio in 1990. In 1991, the company created a regional radio network to transmit programs originating from Sudbury to its pelmorex-owned radio stations in northeastern Ontario and the Ottawa Valley. 

In 1992, Pelmorex also entered into one of Canada&#x27;s first local management agreements, taking over day-to-day management, but not formal ownership, of Telemedia&#x27;s CHAS-FM in Sault Ste. Marie.

Pelmorex became controversial as one of the first radio broadcast groups in Canada to centralize its operations as a cost-saving measure. Almost all local programming on the stations was discontinued, with only local morning shows remaining. This process began slowly in 1991 with a midday program after a satellite uplink was installed at the CHNO-CJMX studios in Sudbury. By 1994, most of the stations&#x27; programming was delivered by satellite from a facility in Mississauga, and the stations were reduced to storefronts with just a few staff members.

The controversy came to a head in 1995, when Environment Canada issued a severe weather warning in Sudbury during the Heat Wave of 1995 Derecho Series. The warning, issued barely ten minutes after the stations had switched to the central programming feed, was never broadcast on any of Pelmorex&#x27;s three stations in the city. Pelmorex, ironically, also owned Canada&#x27;s Weather Network.

Scott Jackson, a former program director with the company, has written on his website that Pelmorex often neglected necessary equipment and technology upgrades at the stations, and that the company had him simultaneously serve as program director of both the Sudbury and North Bay clusters, spending half of his working week in each city.

Pelmorex subsequently sold CKNR, CJNR and CKNS to North Channel Broadcasting in 1996. All three stations were merged by North Channel into a new FM station on 94.1 MHz in 1997, known as CKNR. 

Pelmorex also converted CHVR Pembroke, CHVR-1 Renfrew and CHVR-2 Arnprior to the FM band in 1996. All three stations were merged into a new single FM station on 96.7 MHz, known as CHVR-FM. Pelmorex converted CHUR North Bay to the FM band in 1997. 

In 1997 and 1998, staff at the stations in Sudbury were involved in a four-month strike, during which all programming on the stations aired exclusively from the Mississauga facility.

In 1998, after a change in CRTC ownership rules, Pelmorex sold CHUR, CHVR, CJMX in Sudbury and CJQM in Sault Ste. Marie to Telemedia. (Telemedia had previously been limited to one station on each of the AM and FM bands in each market; with the change, it could acquire two in one band and one in the other, so it added second FMs to its existing AM/FM combos in each city.)

The company (Pelmorex) announced in 1998, that it wants to exit the radio business to focus on its multimedia weather-related information services. 

Pelmorex sold the remaining stations to Haliburton Broadcasting Group in 1999. The company had received CRTC approval to convert CHNO, CHYC, CKOY, CHYK, CHOH and CKAP to the FM band as well, although the conversions were still in progress when the stations were sold to Haliburton.

<doc id="1225871" wikidata="Q1718869" url="?curid=1225871" title="Peachland">
<text>Peachland is a district municipality in the Okanagan Valley on the west side of Okanagan Lake in British Columbia, Canada. It was founded in 1899 by John Moore Robinson, although the region had long been home to the Okanagan people. Peachland is approximately half-an-hour&#x27;s drive south of the city of Kelowna and about a 20-minute drive north of Summerland. The Okanagan Valley is very narrow in the area and there are few terraces that mark former lake levels and the former lake bottom. As a result, the city is largely located on a steep sidehill. Like many other areas in the Okanagan, Peachland is rapidly growing, with new residents coming from all across Canada. Across the lake from Peachland is Rattlesnake Island, home of the legendary Ogopogo. Peachland is approximately 370 km from Vancouver, British Columbia, on the British Columbia south coast.

==History==

Peachland was founded on the site of a tiny community called Camp Hewett.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Peachland had a population of 5,789 living in 2,689 of its 2,936 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 5,428. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

=== Ethnicity ===
=== Religion ===
According to the 2021 census, religious groups in Peachland included:
*Irreligion (3,165 persons or 54.9%)
*Christianity (2,465 persons or 42.8%)
*Judaism (30 persons or 0.5%)
*Buddhism (15 persons or 0.3%)
*Indigenous Spirituality (15 persons or 0.3%)
*Sikhism (10 persons or 0.2%)
*Other (60 persons or 1.0%)

==Government==
Federally, Peachland is, since 2015, within the electoral district of Central Okanagan — Similkameen — Nicola. The current MP is Conservative Dan Albas, elected in the previous constituency of Okanagan—Coquihalla during the 2011 Canadian federal election, following former MP Stockwell Day&#x27;s retirement from public life. The local MLA for the area is Dan Ashton. The municipal government of Peachland consists of the mayor and six at-large councillors, elected to three-year terms.

One former councillor, Jean Fraser, was elected in 1995 and served several consecutive terms. In her last election she received the highest number of votes in the municipality&#x27;s history. Fraser retired from council on November 13, 2011, as she felt the work she could do on council was complete. The current mayor is Patrick Van Minsel who defeated Cindy Fortin by a landslide vote in the 2022 municipal election.

==Climate==

The climate of Peachland is very similar to that of neighboring Kelowna, but with a greater moderating influence from Okanagan Lake. This is partly due to its proximity to the water, as well as the greater width of the lake in this area (up to 5 kilometres). As most of the city is built into a mountainside, it is typically shielded from cold northerly winds and also has an overall southern exposure. This helps warm the area slightly during spring, summer, and fall, but particularly in winter. Proximity to the lake results in more moderation relative to Okanagan cities that are farther away from it. Average January high temperatures in Peachland are nearly 1.5 degrees warmer than in Kelowna, while the reverse is true in July.

The city&#x27;s southern orientation provides protection from winds from the north while also encouraging those from the south, which blow across the lake directly toward the city and can cause mild lake-effect snow. The steep mountainside on which Peachland is built can enhance this effect somewhat via the action of orographic lift. Ordinarily, precipitation in the Okanagan generally decreases from north to south, with the city of Vernon receiving approximately 4 more inches of rain and snow per year than the city of Penticton and 2 more inches than Kelowna.

==Events and industries==
Peachland is home to several events and industries. Hainle Vineyards, the first ice wine maker in North America, operates its organic winery in Peachland. Peachland is the location of the annual Peachland World of Wheels Car Show and the home of the legendary lake monster Ogopogo. Peachland is home to Zipzone Adventure Park, one of the highest zip lines in Canada and the world.

<doc id="1225873" wikidata="Q2344526" url="?curid=1225873" title="¡Ya basta!">
<text>is a phrase in Spanish roughly approximate to &quot;Enough is enough!&quot; or &quot;Enough already!&quot; in US English. It has been adopted by several Latin American insurgent groups as an expression of affront towards issues that sparked the original dissent. Its adoption by the EZLN in Mexico as the movement&#x27;s motto is exemplary of its popularity and ability to rally diverse ideologies under a common goal. 

==Linguistics and etymology==
Grammatically, there is little difference between and , and both are correct. The phrase, or its Italian equivalent, may be the source of the English nautical word &quot;Avast&quot;, which means &quot;Stop, cease or desist from whatever is being done&quot;.

==Examples of usage==
According to Thomas Oleson, there is a different website from the Ya Basta! Italian solidarity group. Ya Basta, which Justin Paulson launched in March 1994, was one of the first websites to feature EZLN content.

&quot;Ya Basta Association&quot; was the name of a major anti-capitalist activist network of groups in Italy which played a central role in the Anti-G8 protest in 2001. They are known for their adoption of sophisticated direct action tactics and for making suits of armor out of street garbage and recycled materials. Ya Basta Association is sometimes associated with the &quot;White Overalls&quot; who appear in many protests heavily padded. 

Another movement with a similar name is Spanish ¡Basta Ya!, an organization opposing the former Basque separatist organization ETA, which carried out attacks in the Basque Country to demand its independence from Spain and France. 

Rapper M-1 of the group Dead Prez endorsed the use of the phrase and the accompanying hand sign in the film &quot;Dave Chappelle&#x27;s Block Party&quot;. The phrase is the name of a French record label, and has been used as the title of works by various musicians, including Sonic Boom Six, GrimSkunk, Elida Reyna, and Ultra-red.

<text>Rosario Ferré Ramírez de Arellano (September 28, 1938 – February 18, 2016) was a Puerto Rican writer, poet, and essayist. Her father, Luis A. Ferré, was the third elected Governor of Puerto Rico and the founding father of the New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico. When her mother, Lorenza Ramírez de Arellano, died in 1970 during her father&#x27;s term as governor, Rosario fulfilled the duties of First Lady until 1972.

She was the recipient of the &quot;Liberatur Prix&quot; award from the Frankfurt Book Fair for &quot;Kristallzucker&quot;, the German translation of &quot;Maldito Amor&quot;.

==Early years==
Rosario Ferré (birth name: Rosario Ferré Ramírez de Arellano) was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, into one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s wealthiest families. Her parents were the former First Family of Puerto Rico Luis A. Ferré (Governor) and Lorenza Ramírez de Arellano She was the niece of the late Sor Isolina Ferré, recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Ferré received her primary education at Ponce, Puerto Rico. In 1951, she was sent to Wellesley, Massachusetts and attended Dana Hall School.

Ferré began writing professionally at age 14, publishing articles in Puerto Rico&#x27;s El Nuevo Día newspaper. In her youth, Ferré was an advocate of independence, despite the fact that her father was pro-statehood (and, later, she too became an advocate of statehood.) Upon graduating from high school she went to the United States where she gained her Bachelor of Arts degree in English and French from Manhattanville College. She was a member of Mu Alpha Phi sorority.

Ferré returned to Puerto Rico where in the 1970s she enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico to study for her master&#x27;s degree. During her time as a student, Ferré began her writing career as the founder, editor and publisher of the journal &quot;Zona de Carga y Descarga&quot; along with her cousin, Olga Nolla. The Journal was also published along with the poet Luis Cesar Rivera. In “Zona de Carga y Descarga”, Ferré published some of her own poetry along with short stories. The journal was devoted to publishing the works of new writers and to promoting the ideas of the independence movement. The journal ran for 9 issues, the first being published in 1972, and the last being published in 1975. Among the novelists and short story writers of Puerto Rico to share Ferré&#x27;s commitment to satire were Ana Lydia Vega and Giannina Braschi. Ferré also published poems and wrote a biography of her father. Upon earning her master&#x27;s degree, Ferré enrolled in the University of Maryland where she graduated with a PhD in Latin American Literature. Her doctoral thesis was titled: &quot;La filiación romántica de los cuentos de Julio Cortázar&quot; (&quot;The romantic link between the stories of Julio Cortázar&quot;).

==Career==
Ferré began her literary career writing in Spanish. In 1976, Ferré published her first collection of short stories, &quot;Papeles de Pandora.&quot; In 1977, she published a collection of her literary essays entitled &quot;Sitio a Eros&quot;, which promoted political and social themes. In 1986, she published her first book, &quot;Maldito Amor&quot;, which she self-translated into English as &quot;Sweet Diamond Dust.&quot; After publishing &quot;Maldito Amor&quot;, she began to write the first versions of her other books in English In 2002, she published a bilingual edition of poems &quot;Language Duel/Duelo del language.&quot; In order to write her novel, &quot;Memorias de Ponce. Autobiografía de Luis A. Ferré&quot;, she transcribed audio left by her father describing his childhood in Ponce, Puerto Rico.

Ferré worked as a Professor at the University of Puerto Rico and was a contributing editor for The San Juan Star, which was once Puerto Rico&#x27;s English language newspaper. Ferré has also been a visiting professor at Rutgers University and Johns Hopkins University.

==Honors==
Ferré won the first prize in a short story contest of the Ateneo Puertorriqueño in 1974.
In 1992, she was the recipient of the &quot;Liberatur Prix&quot; award from the Frankfurt Book Fair for &quot;Kristallzucker&quot;, the German translation of &quot;Maldito Amor&quot;. In 1997, she was also awarded an honorary doctorate from Brown University. Ferré was a Guggenheim Fellowship recipient in 2004. She is also recognized at Ponce&#x27;s Tricentennial Park for her contributions in the field of literature.

==Personal==
Upon finishing school, Ferré married Benigno Trigo González, a businessman, by whom she has three children: Rosario Lorenza, Benigno, and Luis Alfredo. They divorced ten years later.

While studying at the Department for Hispanic Studies of the University of Puerto Rico, she met her second husband, Jorge Aguilar Mora, a writer and Professor of Mexican literature; they divorced after a few years.

Ferré met her third husband, Agustín Costa Quintana, a Puerto Rican architect, while living in Washington, D.C. They later moved to Puerto Rico, where they resided. Ferré died of natural causes, surrounded by family on February 18, 2016, in her home in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

<text>Stillman College is a private historically black Presbyterian college in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. It awards Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in 22 programs housed within three academic schools (School of Arts and Sciences, School of Business Entrepreneurship and CIS, amend School of Education). The college has an average enrollment of 728 students and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

==History==


Stillman College was founded as Tuscaloosa Institute, when it was authorized by the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States in 1875, and held its first classes in 1876. It was chartered as a legal corporation by the State of Alabama in 1895. At that time, the name was changed from Tuscaloosa Institute to Stillman Institute. The institute was a concept initiated by Charles Allen Stillman, pastor of First Presbyterian Church of Tuscaloosa, &quot;for the training of colored men for the ministry&quot;. The mandate for the Institution expanded over the years and it acquired its present campus tract of over . A junior and senior high school was organized and the Institute established a junior college program, which was accredited in 1937. In addition, between 1930 and 1946, it operated a hospital and nurse training school.

Under the administration of Samuel Burney Hay (1948–1965), the school sought to expand into a senior liberal arts institution and in 1948 the name was officially changed to Stillman College. The following year, Stillman expanded into a four-year college and graduated its first baccalaureate class in 1951. The college was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1953. Under Hay, seven new buildings were constructed: a gymnasium, a library, an administration-classroom building, two women&#x27;s residence halls, a prayer chapel, and a student center.

When John Rice became the dean of students at Stillman College in 1966, he lived on campus with his wife, Angelena (née Ray) Rice, and their daughter, Condoleezza Rice, who later served as the 66th United States Secretary of State.
Harold N. Stinson (1967–1980) was the first African American to assume the presidency. Under his dynamic leadership, new programs designed to improve educational quality were instituted, and the physical plant was expanded with the addition of two men&#x27;s residence halls, faculty apartments, a maintenance building, and a mathematics-science center. Snedecor Hall, Batchelor Building, and Birthright Auditorium were renovated. During his presidency, the college graduated its first non-black student, Constance M. Rizzi, in 1978.
Under the leadership of the college&#x27;s fourth president, Cordell Wynn (1982–1997), the appearance of the campus improved dramatically; Winsborough and John Knox Halls were renovated; and the Marie Lundy Wynn Hall and Johnson/Robinson Student Health Center were erected. The enrollment grew beyond 1,000 students; the endowment increased significantly; and the educational program was broadened to include the Stillman Management Institute and a community-service component.
On July 1, 1997, Ernest McNealey (1997–2013) was named the fifth president. During his tenure, Stillman garnered national attention in the areas of technology, athletics and scholarly pursuits. One of the leaders in wireless computing, the college received the National Innovation in Technology Award by Apple Computers and continues to be on the cusp of technological innovations in higher education. The college&#x27;s football program and marching band were revitalized and the college experienced its largest enrollment in the history of the institution. In 2004 the college received its first-ever ranking among top-tier schools in U.S. News &amp; World Report. During McNealey&#x27;s tenure, four new structures were erected (School of Education building, Wynn Fine Arts Center, Roulhac Residence Hall, and the stadium with accompanying playing fields, buildings, and an NCAA regulation track). The sense of place was further manifested in the construction of the Thomas E. Lyle Band Center and NCAA regulation tennis complex.

On June 26, 2014, at a press conference in Birthright Alumni Hall, Stillman Board of Trustees named interim president Peter E. Millet the sixth president of the school. In August 2014, Stillman was awarded a donation of $2 million by an unknown donor to help with the long term stability of the college. On December 29, 2014, President Peter E. Millet announced via school email that tuition for the small liberal arts school would be reduced from $22,500 to $17,500 in an effort to boost enrollment and make college more affordable. On January 1, 2015, Stillman became a smoke-free campus in an effort to keep with its theme of promoting a healthier lifestyle. In December 2015, Stillman cut its current sports from 12 to 2. Currently, Stillman has six intercollegiate sports teams, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Basketball, Baseball, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Bowling, Softball, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Track and Field, and Volleyball. 

On December 14, 2016, the Stillman College Board of Trustees announced the appointment of Cynthia Warrick as the new Interim President for Stillman College. She took office on January 3, 2017. On April 24, 2017, Cynthia Warrick (2017–2023) was named the seventh president and the first female president of Stillman College. On July 1, 2023, Yolanda Page was named the 8th president and the second female president of Stillman College.

The school&#x27;s Tuscaloosa campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2021.

==Athletics==
The Stillman athletic teams are called the Tigers and Lady Tigers. The college is a member of the Division I level of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the HBCU Athletic Conference since the 2024–2025 academic year. The Tigers and Lady Tigers previously competed in the Southern States Athletic Conference (SSAC; formerly known as Georgia–Alabama–Carolina Conference (GACC) until after the 2003–04 school year) from the 2018–19 academic year to the 2023–24 academic year. The Tigers and Lady Tigers also previously competed as a member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SIAC) from 1978–79 to 1998–99, and again from 2002–03 to 2015–16, which is currently an NCAA Division II athletic conference; as a member of the Great South Athletic Conference (GSAC) of the NCAA Division III ranks from 1999–2000 to 2001–02; and as an NAIA Independent within the Association of Independent Institutions (AII) from 2016–17 to 2017–18.

Stillman currently competes in eight intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, softball and track &amp; field. Stillman formerly sponsored football from the 1999 fall season until the 2015 fall season, when the school eliminated all athletic teams, except for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, due to increased costs associated with the athletic program.

In fall 2018, the college added men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country and track and field. Stillman plans to bring back volleyball in the fall of 2022 and add women&#x27;s bowling in the fall of 2023.

<text>Horace Robert Martineau VC (31 October 1874 – 7 April 1916) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Military career ==
Born and educated in London, Martineau enlisted in the 11th Hussars in 1891. He served in Natal and in India before buying his discharge and returning to South Africa in 1895. The next year he served in Colonel Sir Robert Baden-Powell&#x27;s campaign against the Matebele, after which he joined the Cape Police.

===Second Boer War===
On the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899, Martineau joined the Protectorate Regiment (N.W. Cape Colony) as a sergeant. He was awarded the VC in an action near Mafeking. His citation in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; reads:
===World War I===
After the War Martineau took up employment with the African Boating Company in Durban, specialising in support to military forces. He joined the Durban Militia Reserve in 1903 attaining the rank of Captain before visiting New Zealand in 1914 when the First World War broke out. He immediately joined up as a territorial officer in the 14th (South Otago) Regiment, and enlisted as Lieutenant Martineau VC Battalion Transport Officer in the Otago Infantry Battalion, of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. He subsequently served in Suez and at Gallipoli with the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, New Zealand and Australian Division of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC).

After falling ill in the Gallipoli area of operations Martineau was evacuated to Egypt. After recovering he was visiting the &quot;Kursaal&quot; (public area of the town) in Alexandria on the evening of 17 September 1915, where in a cafe called the Pallotta Court he met Captain Hunt and Lieutenant King of the Royal Army Medical Corps. He became involved in an altercation with Captain Hunt which involved Martineau&#x27;s use of insubordinate language. After an investigation of the charge the Commandant of Base Headquarters Alexandria, Brigadier-General McGregor, sent a letter to General Headquarters at Mudros on 21 September 1915 recommending that as Martineau was in possession of the VC &quot;his services be dispensed with without trial and that he be sent back to New Zealand&quot;. While waiting for a verdict on his future Martineau once again fell ill and was admitted to No.2 Australian General Hospital at Ghezireh on 1 November with Colitis (inflammation of the gastrointestinal system). He was moved a week later to the New Zealand General Hospital at Pont de Kubba near Cairo and remained there until being discharged to board the Hospital Ship Maheno, which departed Suez for New Zealand on 29 November 1915. Martineau arrived back in New Zealand on New Year&#x27;s Day 1916 and was granted sick leave. But the leave pass he was issued was worthless because he was no longer a member of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. On 24 February 1916 the New Zealand Gazette issued an order under the authority of James Allen the Minister for Defence:

&quot;Lieutenant Horace Robert Martineau, V.C., attached to 14th (South Otago) Regiment is struck off the strength of the N.Z. Expeditionary Force, under the provisions of paragraph 11 (1), Expeditionary Force Act, 1915, with effect from 1st January, 1916.&quot;

As his health deteriorated Martineau remained in Dunedin instead of returning to South Africa. Serious stomach problems continued to afflict Martineau and contributed to his death just three months after returning from overseas service. He died in Dunedin Hospital on 7 April 1916 as a result of Gastritis and Haematemesis (the vomiting of blood due to prolonged erosion of the stomach lining) and was subsequently buried in Anderson&#x27;s Bay Cemetery, Dunedin among other returned servicemen. As the illness was a continuation of the sickness he first contracted while on Gallipoli, Martineau was categorised as having died after discharge from the NZEF from disease contracted while on active service, and was included in the roll of honour listing New Zealand&#x27;s war dead.

== Medal ==
Horace Martineau&#x27;s VC and other campaign medals were sold at auction by Spink of London for £90,000 on 9 May 2002. The VC was bought for Lord Ashcroft&#x27;s VC Collection and is on display at the Lord Ashcroft VC Gallery in the Imperial War Museum in London.

<text>Antoni Czubiński (22 November 1928 in Konin, Poland – 10 February 2003 in Poznań, Poland) was a Polish historian and director of the Western Institute (Instytut Zachodni) in Poznań from 1978 to 1990. He was the Polish-side Chairman of German-Polish Textbook Commission from 1984 to 1990.

He represented leftist views, and in his works consequently defended the role of the left in preserving Polish statehood in face of both Hitler and Stalin during 20th century. After 1989 he was a moderate defender of the previous system, underlining its achievements in regards to reducing poverty and increasing Polish independence from Soviet Union. He was convinced that in time People&#x27;s Republic of Poland will be seen in more neutral, and even positive light and up until his death he continued to hope that more historians will share his view. After his death in 2003 he was posthumously awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta for his contribution to Polish history.

<doc id="1225899" wikidata="Q5984748" url="?curid=1225899" title="Ibrahima Sylla">
<text>Ibrahima Sylla (2 April 1956 – 30 December 2013) was a Senegalese record producer born in Ivory Coast and founder of the African music label Syllart Records. He was a musician whose production and music direction defined popular African music. From West African dance, to Congolese Soukous (sung in Lingala), to melodic griot-led songs, Sylla&#x27;s signature as a music producer is unmistakable. He has demonstrated his familiarity with many contemporary African musical genres, and he has worked with most of Africa&#x27;s musical greats.

==Biography==
Sylla was born in the Ivory Coast, into a prominent family; his father was Guinean (French Guinea) and was an influential public figure who was well known in West Africa, and whose work took the family to Dakar in Senegal. Sylla developed his love for music whilst studying at a university in Paris, France. He released compilation albums of his favorite Salsa music, and from 1980 he embarked on record production work. He financed an album by Étoile de Dakar, featuring Youssou N&#x27;Dour and Orchestra Baobab. It was in Paris that Sylla developed working relationships with Africa&#x27;s upcoming musicians, many of whom were living there.

Sylla has worked with many of Africa&#x27;s contemporary musicians and he has demonstrated finesse in his production of their music. He worked with many of Zaire&#x27;s (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) greats, including: Les Quatre Etoiles - the renowned DRC group consisting of Soukous greats Bopol, Wuta Mayi, Syran and Nyboma; Pepe Kalle, Sam Mangwana, Tshala Muana, Mbilia Bel, and others. Sylla developed the Soukous concept of tingling, repeated, guitar melodies, adding orchestral harmonies, innovative key changes, and introducing tinges of Salsa music. An example of this can be experienced in his production of Nyboma&#x27;s groundbreaking solo album, &quot;Anicet&quot;.

Zairean Soukous music is highly popular across Africa, South America, and among World Music fans in the West. Sylla&#x27;s Soukous productions are still celebrated, and they continue to influence the shape and direction of African dance music.

Sylla&#x27;s production excellence is also demonstrated by his productions of West African dance music, such as in Oumou Dioubate&#x27;s albums, and in his direction of Malian and Senegalese griot-led songs. He has also worked with Baaba Maal, Bako Dagnon, Ismael Lo, Pape Seck, Oumou Sangare, Gnonnàs Pedro, Kouyate Sory Kandia, Bembeya Jazz, Fanta Damba, Cape Verde Show, Alpha Blondy, Africando, and Miriam Makeba.

A recent compilation of his work, the five-album &quot;20 Years History - The Very Best of Syllart Productions&quot; (Sono/Sterns), introduces new listeners to Sylla&#x27;s work.

<text>Michał Sczaniecki (born Stanisław Maria Michał Sczaniecki; 1910–1977) was a Polish historian of state and law, especially of Poland and France; professor of Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań from 1951 to 1965, and director of the Western Institute (Instytut Zachodni) in Poznań from 1961 to 1964, later professor at Warsaw University.

Sczaniecki hailed from a noble landowning family in Wielkopolska, who identified themselves with the Ossorya coat of arms. His father, Władysław Sczaniecki (1869-1942), was a colonel in the Polish Army, as well as a landowner and a prominent figure in social and economic activism in the dairy industry. Sczaniecki&#x27;s mother was Jadwiga, née Plucińska, who died in 1965.

After graduating from the Mary Magdalene Gymnasium in Poznań in 1927, he pursued a degree in law at the University of Poznań. During this time, Sczaniecki joined the Coronia &quot;Studentenverbindung&quot; and continued his studies at Jagiellonian University under the supervision of Zygmunt Wojciechowski. In 1937, he successfully defended his doctoral dissertation on the allocation of land to knights in Poland until the end of the 13th century. That same year, he travelled to France to further his studies with the Professor François Olivier-Martin at the University of Paris, who was an expert in both historical and legal sciences.

In August 1932, Sczaniecki enlisted for one year of military service. During the initial ten months, he attended the Artillery Reserve Cadet School in Wlodzimierz Wolynski, and then spent two months as an apprentice at the 11th Horse Artillery Squadron in Bydgoszcz. He was eventually promoted to the rank of second lieutenant, with seniority dating back to 1 January 1935, and ranked 112th among the artillery reserve officer corps.

He was enlisted in the Polish Army in France and served as an observation officer in the 2nd division of the 1st (101st) Vilnius Light Artillery Regiment during the French campaign. He received the Cross of Valour and the French Croix de Guerre for his bravery. He also played a crucial role in organizing Polish volunteer units in Brittany. Sczaniecki was wounded in battle and subsequently taken prisoner by the Germans. He spent the rest of the war in the German oflag in Edelbach. After his release, he co-organized an underground Law School for Polish officers affiliated with the Université de Captivité.

After his return to Poznań in 1946, Sczaniecki accomplished his habilitation at the University of Poznań. He was later appointed as an associate professor in 1954, followed by achieving the title of full professor in 1959. In 1955, he took the helm of the Chair of History of State and Law at the University of Poznań. He later moved to the University of Warsaw in 1965. He is the well-known author of a textbook on the history of state and law, favoured by students. Additionally, he was the co-founder of the scientific periodical &quot;Czasopismo Prawno-Historyczne&quot;, which he edited from 1953 to 1977. Sczaniecki was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Grenoble.

He is buried in the Powązki cemetery in Warsaw (cemetery section X, row 6, grave 20).

His elder brother was Józef Sczaniecki, a cavalry officer. His wife was Maria, née Ponikiewska, with whom he had two daughters, Teresa and Monika.

<text>Kazimierz Piwarski (19 February 1903 – 21 July 1968) was a Polish historian, professor of Jagiellonian University in Kraków since 1946 and Poznań University in years 1953-1955, member of Polish Academy of Skills (Polska Akademia Umiejętności, PAU) since 1945, and member of Polish Academy of Sciences (Polska Akademia Nauk, PAN) since 1958.

He researched in the history of the Polish provinces of Pomerania, Silesia, East Prussia and also the universal history of the 18th and 20th centuries. He was one of the most noteworthy Polish historians writing about history of Polish-Saxon relations in 18th century 

During World War II he was arrested by the Germans on 6 November 1940 in Sonderaktion Krakau, and then imprisoned in Sachsenhausen and Dachau concentration camps until late 1941. 

Kazimierz Piwarski was the director of the Western Institute (Instytut Zachodni) in Poznań in years 1956-1958.

<text>David MacKay VC (23 November 1831 – 18 November 1880) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to United Kingdom and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
Born at Alterwall, Howe, Lyth, Scotland, the son of a farm labourer, he enlisted in the 93rd Highlanders (which became the 93rd Sutherland Highlanders and ultimately the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) on 23 December 1850 and served in the Crimean War.

==The VC==
He was awarded the VC for an action at the Siege of Lucknow during the Indian Mutiny. His citation in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; dated 24 December 1858 reads:
===The medal===
The whereabouts of the VC is unknown, Mackay sold it while he was still alive and it was auctioned around 1910.

==Memorial==
Mackay was awarded the VC in 1857 but was buried in Lesmahagow cemetery in an unmarked grave. A ceremony was held at the cemetery on 14 November 1998 to unveil a marker erected near the grave.

<doc id="1225918" wikidata="Q10856115" url="?curid=1225918" title="Humid continental climate">
<text>A humid continental climate is a climatic region defined by Russo-German climatologist Wladimir Köppen in 1900, typified by four distinct seasons and large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers, and cold (sometimes severely cold in the northern areas) and snowy winters. Precipitation is usually distributed throughout the year, but often these regions do have dry seasons. The definition of this climate in terms of temperature is as follows: the mean temperature of the coldest month must be below or depending on the isotherm, and there must be at least four months whose mean temperatures are at or above . In addition, the location in question must not be semi-arid or arid. The cooler &quot;Dfb&quot;, &quot;Dwb&quot;, and &quot;Dsb&quot; subtypes are also known as hemiboreal climates. Although amount of snowfall is not a factor used in defining the humid continental climate, snow during the winter in this type of climate is almost a guarantee, either intermittently throughout the winter months near the southern or coastal margins, or persistently throughout the winter months elsewhere in the climate zone.

Humid continental climates are generally found between latitudes 40° N and 60° N, within the central and northeastern portions of North America, Europe, and Asia. Occasionally, they can also be found at higher elevations above other more temperate climate types. They are rare in the Southern Hemisphere, limited to isolated high altitude locations, due to the larger ocean area at that latitude, smaller land mass, and the consequent greater maritime moderation.

In the Northern Hemisphere, some of the humid continental climates, typically in around Hokkaido, Sakhalin Island, northeastern mainland Europe, Scandinavia, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland are closer to the sea and heavily maritime-influenced and comparable to oceanic climates, with relatively cool summers, significant year-round precipitation (including high amounts of snow) and winters being just below the freezing mark (too cold for such a classification). More extreme and inland humid continental climates, sometimes known as &quot;hyper-continental&quot; climates, are found in northeast China, southern Siberia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, most of the southern interior of Canada, and the Upper Midwest, where temperatures in the winter resemble those of adjacent subarctic climates (with long, drier, generally very cold winters) but have longer and generally warmer summers (in occasional cases, hot summers). A more moderate variety, found in places like Honshu, east-central China, the Korean Peninsula, parts of Eastern Europe, parts of southern Ontario, much of the American Midwest, and the Northeast US, the climate combines hotter summer maxima and greater humidity (similar to those found in adjacent humid subtropical climates) and moderately cold winters and more intermittent snow cover (averaging somewhat below freezing, too cold for a more temperate classification), and is less extreme than the most inland hyper-continental variety.

==Definition==

Using the Köppen climate classification, a climate is classified as humid continental when the temperature of the coldest month is below or and there must be at least four months whose mean temperatures are at or above . These temperatures were not arbitrary. In Europe, the average temperature isotherm (line of equal temperature) was near the southern extent of winter snowpack. In the United States, it is more common to use the isotherm instead. The average temperature was found to be roughly the minimum temperature necessary for tree reproduction and growth. Wide temperature ranges are common within this climate zone.

Second letter in the classification symbol defines seasonal rainfall as follows:
* &quot;s&quot;: A dry summer—the driest month in the high-sun half of the year (April to September in the Northern Hemisphere, October to March in the Southern Hemisphere) has less than / of rainfall and has exactly or less than the precipitation of the wettest month in the low-sun half of the year (October to March in the Northern Hemisphere, April to September in the Southern Hemisphere).
* &quot;w&quot;: A dry winter—the driest month in the low-sun half of the year has exactly or less than one‑tenth of the precipitation found in the wettest month in the summer half of the year.
* &quot;f&quot;: No dry season—does not meet either of the alternative specifications above; precipitation and humidity are often high year-round.
while the third letter denotes the extent of summer heat:
* &quot;a&quot;: Hot summer, warmest month averages at least ,
* &quot;b&quot;: Warm summer, warmest month averages below but at least four months averages above .

===Associated precipitation===
Within North America, moisture within this climate regime is supplied by the Great Lakes, Gulf of Mexico and adjacent western subtropical Atlantic. Precipitation is relatively well distributed year-round in many areas with this climate (&quot;f&quot;), while others may see a marked reduction in wintry precipitation, which increases the chances of a wintertime drought (&quot;w&quot;). Snowfall occurs in all areas with a humid continental climate and in many such places is more common than rain during the height of winter. In places with sufficient wintertime precipitation, the snow cover is often deep. Most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms, and in North America and Asia an occasional tropical cyclone (or the remnants thereof). Though humidity levels are often high in locations with humid continental climates, the &quot;humid&quot; designation means that the climate is not dry enough to be classified as semi-arid or arid.

===Vegetation===

By definition, forests thrive within this climate. Biomes within this climate regime include temperate woodlands, temperate grasslands, temperate deciduous or evergreen forests, coniferous forests, and coniferous swamps. Within wetter areas, maple, spruce, pine, fir, and oak can be found. Fall foliage is noted during the autumn of deciduous forests.

===Neighboring climates===
In the poleward direction, these climates transition into subarctic climates featuring short summers (and usually very cold winters) allowing only conifer trees. Moving equatorword, the hot-summer continental climates grade into humid subtropical climates (chiefly in North America and Asia) while the warm-summer continental climates grade into oceanic climates (chiefly in Europe), both of which have milder winters where average temperatures stay above 0°C (or -3°C). Some continental climates with lower precipitation (chiefly in Central Asia and the Western United States) grade into semi-arid climates with similar temperatures but low precipitation.
== Hot summer subtype ==

A hot summer version of a continental climate features an average temperature of at least 22 °C (71.6 °F) in its warmest month. Since these regimes are restricted to the Northern Hemisphere, the warmest month is usually July or August. High temperatures during the warmest month tend to be in the high 20s to low 30s °C (80s °F), while average January afternoon temperatures are near or well below freezing. Frost-free periods typically last 4 to 7 months in this climate regime. Within North America, this climate includes portions of the central and eastern United States from east of 100°W to south of about the 44°N to the Atlantic. Precipitation increases further eastward in this zone and is less seasonally uniform in the west. The western states of the western United States (namely Montana, Wyoming, parts of southern Idaho, most of Lincoln County in Eastern Washington, parts of Colorado, parts of Utah, isolated parts of northern New Mexico, western Nebraska, and parts of western North and South Dakota) have thermal regimes which fit the &quot;Dfa&quot; climate type, but are quite dry, and are generally grouped with the steppe (&quot;BSk&quot;) climates. In the eastern and Midwestern United States, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, southern New York, most of Connecticut and Rhode Island, and eastern Massachusetts fall into the hot-summer humid continental climate. In Canada, this climate type exists only over portions of Southern Ontario.

In the Eastern Hemisphere, this climate regime is found within interior Eurasia and east-central Asia. Within Europe, the &quot;Dfa&quot; climate type is present near the Black Sea in southern Ukraine, the Southern Federal District of Russia, southern Moldova, Serbia, parts of southern Romania, and Bulgaria, but tends to be drier and can be even semi-arid in these places. In East Asia, this climate exhibits a monsoonal tendency with much higher precipitation in summer than in winter, and due to the effects of the strong Siberian High much colder winter temperatures than similar latitudes around the world, however with lower snowfall, the exception being western Japan with its heavy snowfall. Tōhoku, between Tokyo and Hokkaidō and Western coast of Japan also has a climate with Köppen classification &quot;Dfa&quot;, but is wetter even than that part of North America with this climate type. A variant which has dry winters and hence relatively lower snowfall with monsoonal type summer rainfall is to be found in northern China including Manchuria and parts of North China, south-east Russia, and over much of the Korean Peninsula; it has the Köppen classification &quot;Dwa&quot;. Much of central Asia, northwestern China, and southern Mongolia has a thermal regime similar to that of the &quot;Dfa&quot; climate type, but these regions receive so little precipitation that they are more often classified as steppes (&quot;BSk&quot;) or deserts (&quot;BWk&quot;).

&quot;Dsa&quot; climates are rare; they are generally restricted to elevated areas adjacent to mid-latitude Mediterranean climate regions with a &quot;Csa&quot; climate well inland to ensure hot summers and cold winters. They are generally found in the highly elevated areas of south-eastern Turkey (Hakkâri), north-western Iran, northern Iraq, parts of Central Asia, parts of the High Atlas mountain range in central Morocco and very small parts of the Intermountain West in the United States.

This climate zone does not exist at all in the Southern Hemisphere, where the continents either do not penetrate low enough in latitude or taper too much to have any place that gets the combination of snowy winters and hot summers. Marine influences are very strong around 40°S and such preclude &quot;Dfa&quot;, &quot;Dwa&quot;, and &quot;Dsa&quot; climates from existing in the southern hemisphere.



== Warm summer subtype ==

Also known as hemiboreal climate, areas featuring this subtype of the continental climate have an average temperature in the warmest month below . Summer high temperatures in this zone typically average between during the daytime and the average temperatures in the coldest month are generally well or far below the (or ) isotherm. Frost-free periods typically last 3–5 months. Heat spells lasting over a week are rare.

The warm summer version of the humid continental climate covers a much larger area than the hot subtype. In North America, the climate zone covers from about 42°N to 50°N latitude mostly east of 100°W, including parts of Southern Ontario, the southern half of Quebec, The Maritimes, and Newfoundland, as well as the northern United States from eastern North Dakota east to Maine. However, it can be found as far north as 54°N, and further west in the Canadian Prairie Provinces and below 40°N in the high Appalachians. In Europe, this subtype reaches its most northerly latitude in Bodø at the 67°N.

High-altitude locations such as Flagstaff, Arizona, Aspen, Colorado and Los Alamos, New Mexico in the western United States exhibit local &quot;Dfb&quot; climates. The south-central and southwestern Prairie Provinces also fits the &quot;Dfb&quot; criteria from a thermal profile, but because of semi-arid precipitation portions of it are grouped into the &quot;BSk&quot; category.

In Europe, it is found in much of Central Europe: Germany (in the east and southeast part of the country), Austria (generally below ), Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary (generally above ), Croatia (mostly Slavonia region), in much of Eastern Europe: Ukraine (the whole country except the Black Sea coast), Belarus, Russia (mostly central part of European Russia), south and central parts of the Nordic countries not bathed by the Atlantic Ocean or North Sea: Sweden (historical regions of Svealand and Götaland), Denmark, Finland (south end, including the three largest cities), Norway (most populated area), all Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and also in parts of: Romania (generally above ), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Turkey and in the Cairngorm Mountains of Scotland, (generally above ). It has little warming or precipitation effects from the northern Atlantic. The cool summer subtype is marked by mild summers, long cold winters and less precipitation than the hot summer subtype; however, short periods of extreme heat are not uncommon. Northern Japan has a similar climate.

In Asia, this climate type is found in northern Kazakhstan, southern Siberia, parts of Mongolia, northern China, and highland elevations in the Koreas. Like its hot-summer counterpart, these climates are typically dry in the winter and bitterly cold due to the Siberian High (often with winter temperatures comparable to their nearby subarctic climates), while summers are warm and long enough to avoid classification as a subarctic climate.

In the Southern Hemisphere, it exists in well-defined areas only in the Southern Alps of New Zealand, in the Snowy Mountains of Australia in Kiandra, New South Wales and the Andes Mountains of Argentina and Chile.



==Use in climate modeling==
Since climate regimes tend to be dominated by vegetation of one region with relatively homogenous ecology, those that project climate change remap their results in the form of climate regimes as an alternative way to explain expected changes.

<text>Bruce Steel Kingsbury, VC (8 January 1918 – 29 August 1942) was an Australian soldier of the Second World War. Serving initially in the Middle East, he later gained renown for his actions during the Battle of Isurava, one of many battles forming the Kokoda Track Campaign in the south-east of the island of New Guinea, then part of the Australian Territory of Papua (now Papua New Guinea) . His bravery during the battle was recognised with the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. The first serviceman to receive the VC for actions on Australian territory, Kingsbury was a member of the 2/14th Infantry Battalion.

On 29 August 1942, during the Battle of Isurava, Kingsbury was one of the few survivors of a platoon that had been overrun by the Japanese. He immediately volunteered to join a different platoon, which had been ordered to counter-attack. Rushing forward and firing his Bren gun from the hip, he cleared a path through the enemy and inflicted several casualties. Kingsbury was then shot by a sniper and killed instantly. His actions, which delayed the Japanese long enough for the Australians to fortify their positions, were instrumental in saving his battalion&#x27;s headquarters and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result.

==Early life==
Born in the Melbourne suburb of Preston on 8 January 1918, Kingsbury was the second son of Philip Blencowe Kingsbury, an estate agent, and his wife Florence Annie (née Steel). Growing up in Prahran, Kingsbury became friends with Alan Richard Avery when he was five years old. The two often raced billy carts down the hilly streets, and would remain lifelong friends. Kingsbury attended Windsor State School as a child, and his results were good enough to earn a scholarship at Melbourne Technical College. Avery began an agricultural course in Longerenong. Although qualified as a printer, Kingsbury began working at his father&#x27;s real estate business, a job he disliked.

Unhappy in the estate agency, Kingsbury took up the position of caretaker on a farm at Boundary Bend, not far from where Avery was working. After three months, the pair decided that they would go on an adventure—walking through western Victoria and New South Wales. In February 1936, Kingsbury and Avery left their jobs and began travelling north, working on several farms and estates. The pair eventually arrived in Sydney several months later, and returned to Melbourne on the first train back. Kingsbury resumed working as a real estate agent, and Avery worked as a nurseryman. They spent their free time at dances and parties. During this time, Kingsbury and Avery met and became close to sisters Leila Edith Bradbury and Annie Margaret Bradbury. As the war in Europe escalated, Kingsbury and Avery made up their minds to enlist. Despite his parents&#x27; disapproval, Kingsbury signed up to the Australian Imperial Force on 29 May 1940.

==Second World War==
===Middle East===
Kingsbury was originally assigned to the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion, but requested a transfer to the 2/14th Infantry Battalion to join Avery who had, coincidentally, enlisted on the same day at a different recruitment centre. The pair undertook basic training at Puckapunyal, where they were assigned to the same section (7 Section of 9 Platoon) and were given drill instruction, rifle drill and mock battle training. After 7 Section learned they would be sent overseas, Kingsbury informed Avery that he planned to propose to Leila. The pair went to Melbourne to try to organise the wedding. Although Kingsbury gave Leila a wristwatch as an engagement present, they could not arrange a marriage licence before he left, and the marriage never took place.

Kingsbury, along with the rest of the 7th Division, was shipped to the Middle East in late 1940. Spending time in Tel Aviv and the surrounding areas, the 7th Division continued training and awaited further orders. On 9 April, the division was sent forward to Mersa Matruh in Egypt to support the Commonwealth force&#x27;s defences. It replaced a Scottish unit and took up positions in the garrison. On 23 May, Kingsbury&#x27;s brigade was sent back to Palestine, en route to battle in Syria and Lebanon. The 2/14th fought against the Vichy French on the Lebanese mountain ranges, as part of a three-pronged attack on Beirut. During this time, the division fought in many towns, including a major battle in Jezzine, where Avery was wounded by a grenade—which drove metal splinters into his spine—and awarded the Military Medal for his &quot;cool courage and devotion&quot;. As the war with the Vichy French was winding down, on 11 July Kingsbury and Avery were selected for a contingent to collect and bury the dead. The battalion stayed in Beirut for a few months, until setting up a semi-permanent camp at Hill 69, outside Jerusalem.

On 30 January 1942, the 7th Division left Egypt for Australia, sailing via Bombay, as the division was needed to fight against the Japanese. Kingsbury&#x27;s battalion made landfall at Adelaide and continued to Melbourne by rail. The battalion arrived on 16 March, and was given a week&#x27;s leave. After this, the battalion underwent training in Glen Innes, before camping in Yandina, Queensland. On 5 August, the battalion moved north to Brisbane, boarding a ship to Port Moresby to join the fighting in New Guinea, where a force of mostly Militia personnel were engaged in a desperate defensive action.

===Kokoda Track Campaign===

Following the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Japanese abandoned the attempt to capture Port Moresby from the sea and, on 21 July, landed ground forces at Buna in north-east Papua. After capturing the town of Kokoda for the second time on 9 August, the Japanese began advancing along the Kokoda Track towards Port Moresby. The 2,500-strong Japanese force met the 39th and 53rd Infantry Battalions, at the town of Isurava. As the battle was beginning to develop, on 26 August, members of the 2/14th, including Kingsbury, arrived at Isurava to reinforce the exhausted 39th Battalion.

====Battle of Isurava====
The two combined battalions began digging in around Isurava. A headquarters had been set up at the top of the hill, which was vital to the defence of the position. While the Australians dug themselves in, the Japanese, led by Japanese Major General Tomitarō Horii, prepared to attack. On 28 August, the Japanese launched their offensive. The Australians, who had initially been outnumbered but were now roughly equal in strength, resisted in the face of heavy machine-gun fire and hand-to-hand combat. On 29 August, the Japanese broke through the right flank, pushing the Australians back with heavy fire, threatening to cut off their headquarters. The Australians began to prepare a counter-offensive, and men volunteered to join an attack party. Kingsbury, one of the few survivors of his platoon, ran down the track with the group. Using a Bren gun he had taken from wounded Corporal Lindsay Bear, Kingsbury, alongside Avery and the rest of the group, engaged the nearby Japanese. The fire was so heavy that the undergrowth was completely destroyed within five minutes. It was then that Kingsbury, firing from his hip, charged straight at the Japanese.

His actions demoralised the Japanese, killing several and forcing others to find cover. The rest of the Australian group, inspired by Kingsbury&#x27;s actions, forced the Japanese further back into the jungle. Kingsbury was then shot and mortally wounded by a Japanese sniper. The sniper fired one shot before disappearing. Avery, who had been about from Kingsbury, briefly chased after the sniper but returned to carry Kingsbury to the regimental aid post; Kingsbury was dead by the time he arrived there.

==Legacy==

Kingsbury&#x27;s actions were a turning point in the battle. The Japanese had begun to gather momentum in their attack, and were threatening to overrun the 2/14th&#x27;s headquarters. His attack inflicted damage to the Japanese force, temporarily halting their advance. This allowed the Australian troops to stabilise their positions, eventually regaining control and defending the battalion&#x27;s headquarters. His act of bravery served as an inspiration to the troops. The battle ended in defeat for the Australians, elements of the 2/14th breaking during the afternoon of 29 August. The remainder of the battalion was able to withdraw during the night, but suffered heavy casualties and another defeat fighting the next day at positions around the Isurava Guest House.

Authors and military analysts have speculated that had Kingsbury not attacked, the Japanese might have destroyed the battalion. The Japanese had been attacking in waves, and had started to climb a steep hill to outflank the Australians, in an effort to win the battle. The Australians were low on supplies and the Japanese were on the verge of breaking through the Australian line. Had they broken through, they would have been able to isolate the battalion&#x27;s headquarters from the soldiers on the flanks. This would have prevented the Australians from retreating to Alola, allowing the Japanese to overrun them.

For his actions, Kingsbury was awarded the Victoria Cross, which was gazetted on 9 February 1943. His citation read:

Kingsbury was the first Australian soldier to be awarded the Victoria Cross for actions in the South Pacific and also the first on Australian territory. Kingsbury&#x27;s section remains the most highly decorated section in the British Empire, its members having received a Victoria Cross, one Distinguished Conduct Medal and four Military Medals by war&#x27;s end; the platoon also suffered the highest proportional losses in the Kokoda Campaign. Kingsbury&#x27;s platoon sergeant, Sergeant Robert Thompson, later commented that when he was recommending Kingsbury for the Victoria Cross, he was asked several times would he &quot;please write it up a bit more with a bit more action and such&quot; and

Kingsbury&#x27;s Rock, the rock next to which Kingsbury died, stands within sight of where the 2/14th Battalion&#x27;s headquarters had been established, and has been incorporated as part of the Isurava Memorial. His body now rests in the Bomana Cemetery, Port Moresby, and his Victoria Cross is on display at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra. The Melbourne suburb of Kingsbury was named in his honour, as was a rest area on the Remembrance Driveway and a street in the Canberra suburb of Gowrie. Kingsbury&#x27;s story was featured in the History Channel production &quot;For Valour&quot;.

<doc id="1225920" wikidata="Q2206375" url="?curid=1225920" title="Streamium">
<text>Streamium was a line of IP-enabled entertainment products by Dutch electronics multi-national Philips Consumer Electronics. Streamium products use Wi-Fi to stream multimedia content from desktop computers or Internet-based services to home entertainment devices. A Streamium device plugged into the local home network will be able to see multimedia files that are in different UPnP-enabled computers, PDAs and other networking devices that run UPnP AV MediaServer software.

Streamium products may also support internet radio, internet photo sharing and movie trailers services directly. Subscriptions to web-based services requiring subscriptions would be managed through the &#x27;Club Philips&#x27; portal.

In all cases, using a computer with RSS receiver together with a UPnP AV MediaServer, it is possible to play back audio/video podcast. Some of the popular feeds include BBC live, Geekbrief, Reuters, Metacafe, YouTube. Although in most cases this video podcaster uses codec formats not supported by Streamium, it&#x27;s still possible by using software codec transcoders on the PC to convert them to MPEG format.

Philips Media Manager, is—since SimpleCenter version 4— a free open source UPnP AV MediaServer for Windows and Macintosh that is bundled with Streamium. Version 3 of SimpleCenter, was initially developed for inclusion with the Streamium line of products. Since Streamium devices also support photos and videos, SimpleCenter ships with video and image support, under the name &#x27;Philips Media Manager&#x27; (PMM).

==History==
In 2000 Philips&#x27; consumer electronics division (business unit Audio) invented the Streamium brand for a &quot;Connected Home&quot;. A number of products were released between January 2000 and June 2003. In 2003 the &quot;Connected Home&quot; would be broadened to the &quot;Connected Planet&quot; accompanied by an attempt to steer product development and industrialization from Eindhoven and to include other business units. The &quot;Connected Planet&quot; was less successful, leaving a limited number of products.

===Products===
The FW-i1000, an audio mini-system including a CD-changer and AM/FM radio, and considered to be the precursor to the Streamium product line, first shipped in June 2001. It had been in development by Philips&#x27; audio business group in Sunnyvale (CA, USA) since May 2000. At the January 2001 Consumer Electronics Show they announced and demonstrated the first integrated audio device connecting to &quot;over a thousand internet radio stations&quot;.

The FW-i1000 was rapidly followed by a slew of other IP-enabled devices. The marketing name &quot;Streamium&quot; and the slogan &quot;Don&#x27;t dream it, stream-it&quot; was coined and globally registered by Ramon de la Fuente (now at Google) who replaced Tony Cher as a product manager in 2001.

January 2001
* FW-i1000, with iM-networks service offered by Sonicbox, an aggregator of Internet radio service. A limited number of UPnP compliant prototypes were also made for use in the testing of the UPnP AV specifications.

January 2002
* The MCi200, with Philips back-end, several internet based services (and my.philips.com user interface extension protected by a number of patents)
* The iPronto, with WiFi/UPnP, links to security camera and offering a web-based electronic program guide a.k.a. EPG.

January 2003
* The MCi250, an upgrade to the MCi200 with WiFi and UPnP-compliant

Announced at the same event:
* The SL300i and SL400i wireless multi-media adapters
* The MX6000i, with WiFi/UPnP, video, pictures and photo service, music services, 5 DVD changer
* The Streamium-TV, a 32&quot; LCD TV offering similar web-based services as the MX6000i
Both the Streamium-TV and MX6000i were capable of offering video content hosted by a web-based service, the precursor of net TV. 

August 2004
* The SL50i wireless PC audio receiver.

September 2004

January 2013

as of January 2013 Philips have abandoned the streamium line without explanation.

It seems that the Fidelio line is to fill the gap streamium left.

===Architecture===

Whereas the FW-i1000 used the iM-networks service (then known as &quot;SonicBox&quot;), the end-to-end &quot;Streamium&quot; system designed by Daniel Meirsman, included a Philips owned back-end service (the &quot;ECD-interface&quot;).

This back-end service allowed Streamium devices to connect to &quot;any number&quot; of web based content delivery services. The back-end would thereby function as a &quot;switch-board&quot; connecting the content delivery services with individual boxes. Moreover, the back-end service would allow Philips to build out an &quot;after-sales&quot; relationship with their customers through the web-based [UI]-extension and would stimulate some early form of web-based social networking with the streamium cafe web site that was set up by Mark Tuttle.

A navigation tree would be served to the Streamium-device from the Philips back-end, whereas the content itself would be directly streamed from the service to the Streamium-box subject to the site&#x27;s policy (subject to the compulsory licences...). By manipulating the navigation tree from the front panel of the Streamium-device users could select desired the service, genre, artist, album, track...

From the start, Streamium-devices contained provisions (i.e. an IEEE EUI-64 containing an OUI and a MAC-address, encryption keys, product and software version codes) used to protect streams and support identification mechanisms, as well as allowing downloading of software upgrades (for bug-fixes as well as enabling new features).

In most cases. Streamium functionality was provided by a module (a [PCB]) based on an NXP TriMedia PNX1300. This module implemented:

1. Connectivity to the home network as well as to the Internet (network stack, SAX as opposed to DOM XML-parser, UPnP-stack)

2. Decoding of compressed (audio, image, video) content

A user interface extension was available on the Streamium web-site (my.philips.com) that would allow users to manage their preferences, services and devices.

On the frontpanel or through the on-screen display (OSD) of the Streamium devices, users could mark their favorites or indicate they wanted to learn more about the song being played. The service would then send either an e-mail with more details, or post this info on my.philips.com with a click-through link (i.e. to Amazon.com for purchasing).

===Technology Concepts===
Under the direction of the Streamium team, Philips CE contributed significantly to both UPnP and Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) and other industry efforts. 

The Streamiums were extensively used to build advanced concepts, even at other divisions of Philips such as Philips Semiconductors (now NXP Semiconductors), Philips Research and Philips Medical. 

Philips Semiconductors would pick up on the vision of Philips Consumer Electronics and task the &quot;advanced system lab&quot; to prototype this vision (first demos end 2004).

Concepts (such as those used in the Connected Home demos) would then be shown by the Streamium team in the &quot;Philips-CE World Tour&quot;, an invitation only event at the yearly Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to a selected audience.

* Demonstration of a portable HDD-based and Wi-Fi enabled UPnP renderer (January 2002) for studies of portable entertainment.
* Demonstration of a fully-fledged UPnP enabled network (January 2003) with multiple renderers, servers and control points
* Bridging between UPnP and Zigbee was demonstrated to control lighting from a UPnP control point as well as a GPRS link that bridged to the UPnP network through a web server (January 2003), linking digital entertainment to home automation and &quot;ambiance control&quot;.
* Use cases illustrating the use of RFID in interactive marketing, identification and personalisation (January 2003).
* Tests with the Rhapsody as a UPnP AV-server streaming to an MCi200 (a bit what Sonos is currently offering) (2003).
* Running tests of Apple&#x27;s Rendezvous protocol on the MCi200 (2003).
* The first demonstration of the NFC smart poster concept with Visa (January 2004).
* Use cases illustrating interoperable DRM (Streamium was one of the devices used to demonstrate the principles underlying the activities of the Coral consortium (January 2004).
* Use cases illustrating the use of recommender technology (January 2004)
* Demonstration (~43 use cases) of a fully connected home including stationary as well as portable devices and mobile phones and executed at the &quot;CES2005 World Tour&quot; by a team of professional actors. (January 2005)
* Use cases in the area of fitness and well-being (January 2005)
* Use cases illustrating uses for UPnP printing (January 2005).
* Experiments with Java-based arcade games

===Services===
iM-networks was offered on the FW-i1000 from the start.

The Philips Streamium MX6000i provided traditional home entertainment alongside access to audio-video content from a PC, UPnP mediaserver or online entertainment service. Services included music videos, Web movies, and cinema trailers.

The Philips Streamium service partners were:

* Yahoo LAUNCHcast
* Yahoo! Movies - trailers only
* MP3.com
* Musicmatch Musicmatch Jukebox, Radio MX
* live365.com
* Radio Free Virgin
* Playhouse Radio
* Andante
* Bluebeat
* iFilm - previews and short movies
* Launch - music videos

There was no need to first download files to PC, or even to turn the PC on, to stream multimedia Internet content. (A broadband Internet connection is required.)

A wide array of Yahoo! services including on-demand music videos, movie trailers and clips and photo services was launched together with the Streamium range extension in Spring 2004.

Out of the box consumers would have access to free services. Additionally, a number of services would offer premium (subscription-based) online services allowing consumers to broaden and personalize their home entertainment experience.

==Results==
In his press conference during the CES2001, Guy Demuynck, then CEO of Philips CE, expressed his vision that the Internet would become as ubiquitous and accessible as the electric grid to devices other than the PC, and that people would increasingly rely on the Internet for information and entertainment.

&quot;The Internet has transformed the way we do business,&quot; Demuynck stated, referring not only to communications and promotions but to product design as well. &quot;We intend to put Internet capabilities into many products, making Internet content as accessible as pressing a single button on a TV remote. The Internet dominates all our thinking—it will expand from a browsing activity to an always-on, integral part of daily life,&quot; he said.
===Innovations===
The early Internet audio and Streamium devices had both constant broadband Internet connectivity and a back-end service provided by Philips to aggregate services for its users. In addition, a UI extension was offered (my.philips) that allowed consumers to manage their devices, external service subscriptions, favorites, as well as to add their own streams. 
The PC-based UI extension was part of the lean-forward/lean-backward approach to this potentially complicated product range:
* Lean backward functionality was accessible on the device directly
* Lean forward functionality was relegated to the PC
In essence, the Philips service offering was a walled garden; but the fact that consumers could add and access their own favorite streams made it more of an open system.
Although never published, Streamium relied on an XML-based API—not unlike the APIs we see today published by Web-service providers (YouTube, eBay...) -- and implemented XML-based APIs as offered by its service providers.

===Commercial impact===
Unfortunately the first Streamium generations lacked support for a number of important media formats such as those included in the Windows Media technologies which hampered their commercial success. 
Philips&#x27; legal team had issues with the non-assertion clause that Microsoft required potential licensees to sign without prior opportunity to check the IP involved. Since Philips did and still does own a substantial patent-portfolio, product management was not allowed to risk signing away rights on a substantial number of important patents.

===Consumer testing===
To some extent consumers were involved in some of the design of the Streamiums. Of course, the classical focus test groups were used to find out what features consumers would deem important. But also after the official announcement, a limited number of pre-production versions of the Streamiums would be made available to a limited number of volunteer beta-testers that could sign up via a Philips web-site.

<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, 0-10-2 represents the wheel arrangement of no leading wheels, ten powered and coupled driving wheels on five axles, and two trailing wheels on one axle (usually in a trailing truck).

Other equivalent classifications are:
UIC classification: E1 (also known as German classification and Italian classification)
French classification: 051
Turkish classification: 56
Swiss classification: 5/6

== United States ==
In the US, this type is known as the Union after the only US railroad to have new locomotives built in this arrangement. These were ten 0-10-2s built for the Union Railroad in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area. They were used as heavy duty transfer locomotives rather than switchers. In Greenville, Pennsylvania, one is on static display lettered for the Duluth Missabe and Iron Range Railway #604 (Upon dieselization, the Union RR sold all of theirs to the DM&amp;IR) .

The Chicago &amp; North Western Railway converted two 2-10-2 locomotives formerly owned by subsidiary Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha into 0-10-2 locomotives in 1944.
They were classified J-1 both before and after conversion. One was scrapped in 1950 and the other in 1953.

== Europe ==

In Germany, a number of narrow gauge tank locomotives were built with an 0-10-2 configuration. All used some form of articulated drive that allowed the outer driving axles to move sideways or radially to negotiate curves. An example was a group of locomotives built for the narrow gauge lines of Bosnia that utilised the Klose System for an articulated drive.

<text>The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa is New Zealand&#x27;s national museum and is located in Wellington. Usually known as Te Papa (Māori for &#x27;the treasure box&#x27;), it opened in 1998 after the merging of the National Museum of New Zealand and the National Art Gallery. An average of more than 1.1 million people visit every year, making it the 58th-most-visited art gallery in the world in 2023. Te Papa operates under a bicultural philosophy, and emphasises the living stories behind its cultural treasures.

==History==


=== Colonial Museum ===
The first predecessor to Te Papa was the Colonial Museum, founded in 1865, with Sir James Hector as founding director. The museum was built on Museum Street, roughly in the location of the present day Defence House Office Building. The museum prioritised scientific collections but also acquired a range of other items, often by donation, including prints and paintings, ethnographic curiosities, and items of antiquity. In 1907, the Colonial Museum was renamed the Dominion Museum and took on a broader focus. The idea of developing a public art gallery in Wellington was gathering support, and the Science and Art Act of 1913 paved the way for a national art gallery in the same building.

=== Co-location with National Art Gallery ===
Following the passing of the National Art Gallery and Dominion Museum Act in 1930, the two institutions shared a single board of trustees. In 1934, the National Art Gallery moved into the Dominion Museum building and incorporated the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts, which sold its land and donated the proceeds to the new organisation together with an initial collection. The early holding consisted largely of donations and bequests, including those from Harold Beauchamp, T. Lindsay Buick, Archdeacon Smythe, N. Chevalier, J. C. Richmond, William Swainson, Bishop Monrad, John Ilott and Rex Nan Kivell. In 1936, a new building to house both the collections opened in Buckle Street as a part of the newly built National War Memorial. In 1985 a temporary exhibition space venue was added to the National Art Gallery. Shed 11 the Temporary/Contemporary was situated on the Wellington waterfront in a converted industrial warehouse built in 1905 and exhibited contemporary art, both local and international, until 1992.

Eru D. Gore was secretary-manager from 1936 until his death in 1948 when Stewart Maclennan was appointed the first director. This was the first appointment in New Zealand of a full-time art gallery director. Other past directors of the gallery include:
*Stewart Maclennan (1948–68)
*Melvin Day (1968–78)
*Luit Bieringa (1979–89)
*Jenny Harper (1990–92)

=== Te Papa ===
Te Papa was established in 1992 by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa Act 1992. Part of the remit for Te Papa was to explore the national identity of New Zealand. translates literally to &#x27;container of treasures&#x27; or in full &#x27;container of treasured things and people that spring from mother Earth here in New Zealand&#x27;. The official opening took place on 14 February 1998, in a ceremony led by Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, Sir Peter Blake, and two children. Māori traditional instrumentalist Richard Nunns co-led the musicians at a dawn ceremony on opening day. The museum had one million visitors in the first five months of operation, and between 1 and 1.3 million visits have been made in each subsequent year. In 2004, more space was devoted to exhibiting works from the New Zealand art collection in a long-term exhibition called &quot;Toi Te Papa: Art of the Nation&quot;. Filmmakers Gaylene Preston and Anna Cottrell documented the development of Te Papa in their film &quot;Getting to Our Place&quot;.

=== Current building ===

The main Te Papa building is built on reclaimed land on Cable Street which formerly belonged to the Wellington Harbour Board. The site was previously occupied by a modern five-storey hotel. Over a five-month period in 1993, the hotel was jacked off its foundations onto numerous rail bogies and transported down and across the road to a new site, where it is now the Museum Hotel. Once the site was clear, the soft reclaimed land was compacted to a depth of 16 metres by dropping weights of up to 30 tonnes from a height of up to 30 metres in a criss-cross pattern on the site. Over 50,000 weights were dropped, causing noise and vibration problems for those in surrounding buildings.

Te Papa was designed by Jasmax Architects and built by Fletcher Construction. The building had cost NZ$300 million by its opening in 1998. Earthquake strengthening of the Cable Street building was achieved through the New Zealand-developed technology of base isolation. The building contains six floors of exhibitions, cafés and gift shops dedicated to New Zealand&#x27;s culture, history and environment. When it opened in 1998, the museum had a fine-dining restaurant called Icon, but this later closed. The museum also incorporates outdoor areas with artificial caves, native bushes and wetlands. A second building on Tory Street is a scientific research facility and storage area, and is not open to the public.

The design process of the building followed bicultural principles based on the Treaty of Waitangi. This process was led by Cliff Whiting working alongside Cheryll Sotheran and Ken Gorbey.

== Governance and leadership ==
The museum is run by a board appointed by the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage. Board members have included: Wira Gardiner, Fiona Campbell, Sue Piper, Judith Tizard, John Judge, Miria Pomare, Michael Bassett, Christopher Parkin, Sandra Lee, Ngātata Love, Ron Trotter, Glenys Coughlan, Judith Binney, Philip Carter, Wendy Lai and Api Mahuika.

Directors of the museum include:
* James Hector (1865–1903)
* Augustus Hamilton (1903–1913)
* James Allan Thomson (1914–1928)
* Walter Oliver (1928–1947)
* Robert Falla (1947–1966)

CEOs of Te Papa include:

* Cheryll Sotheran (1992–2002)
* Cliff Whiting (1995–1999) – joint CEO or Kaihautū 
* Seddon Bennington (2003 – July 2009)
* Michael Houlihan (Aug 2010 – May 2014)
* Rick Ellis (Nov 2014 – May 2017)
* Geraint Martin (May 2017 – 2019)
* Courtney Johnston (2019–present) and Arapata Hakiwai (Kaihautū, Māori co-leader) (2014–present).

==Collections==

The History Collection includes many dresses and textiles, the oldest of which date back to the sixteenth century. The History Collection also includes the New Zealand Post Archive with around 20,000 stamps and related objects, and the Pacific Collection with about 13,000 historic and contemporary items from the Pacific Islands.

There are significant collections of fossils and archaeozoology; a herbarium of about 250,000 dried specimens (&quot;Index Herbariorum&quot; code WELT); a collection of about 70,000 specimen of New Zealand birds; significant amphibians, reptiles and mammals.

The museum has the world&#x27;s largest specimen of the rare colossal squid (&quot;Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni&quot;). It weighs and is long. The squid arrived at the museum in March 2007 after being captured by New Zealand fishers in the Ross Sea off Antarctica. The cultural collections include collections on photography, Māori taonga (cultural treasures), and Pacific cultures.

The Museum of New Zealand is also home to the Elgar Collection, a valuable collection of English and French furniture and paintings, the oldest of which date back to the seventeenth century. In 1946 the Dominion Museum received a bequest of some of Fernside Homestead&#x27;s finest antiques from Ella Elgar&#x27;s will. Until 1992 these antiques were displayed in period rooms at the Dominion Museum, and objects from the Elgar Collection are currently exhibited throughout Te Papa.

==Archives==
The archives are located in a separate building on 169 Tory Street and are open for researchers by appointment. There are two categories of archive collections: the Museum Archive and the Collected Archives.

The Museum Archive goes back to the founding of the Colonial Museum in 1865 and comprises the archives of James Hector. The archives of the National Art Gallery of New Zealand are also part of these archives. The Collected Archives fall into two groups:
# Art-related records and other archival papers in specialist areas; for instance the archives of Toss Woollaston, Lois White and Leonard Mitchell
# A wide variety of archival material, that includes the diary of Felton Mathew, Surveyor General at the time of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, and battle plans and correspondences related to World War I; for instance the Gallipoli diary of Captain E.P. Cox.

==Exhibitions==

Te Papa&#x27;s exhibits range from long-term exhibitions on New Zealand&#x27;s natural environment and social history, to cultural spaces and touring/temporary exhibitions. Most are hands-on and interactive. The long term exhibitions of cultural objects focus on New Zealand history, Māori culture and New Zealand&#x27;s natural world. The hands-on and interactive exhibitions focus on engaging young visitors and include out-door areas built and planted for Te Papa. The key cultural space is the &quot;Rongomaraeroa&quot; marae with unusual whakairo in its wharenui, &quot;Te Hono ki Hawaiki&quot;.

Te Papa charges an entrance fee of $35 for international visitors (as of September 2024) however it remains free entry for all New Zealanders. Some temporary exhibitions are ticketed, but may have occasional free days.

In 2018, the &quot;Mountains to Sea&quot; and &quot;Awesome Forces&quot; exhibits were closed, with Te Taiao Nature taking their place. This new exhibit opened on 11 May 2019, with a 1,400 square-metre exhibition focusing on New Zealand&#x27;s natural environment. The exhibition retains several features of the old exhibits, such as an earthquake house simulation and a 495 kilogram (1,091 lb) Colossal squid.

In 2022, the &quot;Manu Rere Moana&quot; exhibition was renewed to reflect the developments in traditional navigation since its initial installation.

A full list of exhibitions can be found here.

==Library==
Te Aka Matua Library, previously a publicly accessible library, is now open only to researchers by appointment between 10am-5pm, Monday-Friday. The library is a major research and reference resource, with particular strengths in New Zealand, Māori, natural history, art, photography and museum studies. It is located on the fourth floor of the main building.

==Mahuki Innovation Accelerator==
Mahuki was Te Papa&#x27;s innovation accelerator. It was an in-residence programme in which 10 teams developed solutions to challenges facing cultural institutions.

==Controversies==
The museum has sometimes been the centre of controversy. The siting of significant collections at the water&#x27;s edge on reclaimed land next to one of the world&#x27;s most active faults has resulted in concern by some people. There has been criticism of the &quot;sideshow&quot; nature of some exhibits, primarily the Time Warp section, which has closed. There has also been criticism that some exhibits were not given due reverence. For example, a major work by Colin McCahon was at one stage juxtaposed with a 1950s refrigerator in a New Zealand culture exhibition.

The Māori name of the museum has caused controversy. In 1989 the Māori iwi Te Āti Awa, located near Wellington, requested that the Ngāti Whakaue iwi grant a name to the museum, which resulted in the Ngāti Whakaue bestowing the name &quot;Kuru Tongarerewa&quot;, an ancient ceremonial name important to the iwi evoking spiritual, historical, and cultural importance. However, the name eventually adopted by the museum caused offense by being a modification in the form of &quot;Te Papa Tongarewa&quot;. Meetings between the museum&#x27;s board and the Ngāti Whakaue led to promises that the name would be changed to &quot;Te Papa Kuru Tongererewa&quot;, but the change did not occur.

New Zealand art commentator Hamish Keith, a member of the board that set up the Museum of New Zealand and a member of its interim board, has been a consistent critic of Te Papa at different times referring to it as a &quot;theme park&quot;, the &quot;cultural equivalent to a fast-food outlet&quot; and &quot;not even a de facto national gallery&quot;, but seemed to moderate his opinion later when making a case for exhibition space on the Auckland waterfront.

Staff restructuring at Te Papa since 2012 has generated significant controversy. In October 2018, Te Papa management promised to review restructuring plans, indicating that plans would be scaled back. In February 2019, the Collection Manager of Fishes Andrew Stewart and the Collection Manager of Molluscs Bruce Marshall were made redundant. Numerous museum experts and scientists in New Zealand and worldwide criticised the move, with researchers including Steve O&#x27;Shea advocating a boycott. In March 2019, the redundancies were delayed. In April 2019, the museum reversed the decision for Andrew Stewart, offering him an alternative job. Between April and May 2019, Te Papa advertised a research position for a molluscan curator and awarded the job to an alternative candidate to Bruce Marshall. The advertisement and decision to not offer the job to Bruce Marshall was criticised harshly by outside experts, prompting moa expert Trevor Worthy to end his 30-year research association with the museum in protest. 

=== Virgin Mary artwork controversy ===
British artist Tania Kovats&#x27; exhibition, Pictura Britannica, particularly the piece &quot;Virgin in a Condom&quot;, infuriated many in the Christian community and sparked protests and counter protests a month after Te Papa opened its doors in 1998. A nationwide petition was circulated calling for the work&#x27;s removal. Protesters congregated on the forecourt outside, increasing in number after The Christian Action group took out a full-page advertisement in &quot;The Dominion&quot; newspaper inviting people to join their protest. They threatened to take Te Papa to court on the grounds of &quot;blasphemous libel&quot;, a 1961 Crimes Act offence against &quot;religion, morality and public welfare&quot;. Te Papa staff also became the target of abusive and threatening phone calls and letters. The exhibit was guarded after being physically attacked, and following that, a guard working at the site was assaulted.

Te Papa responded by refusing to remove the offending artwork. The museum welcomed protestors back, stating that the museum&#x27;s aim was not to offend, but to stimulate debate as a forum. However, they stipulated that debate would not concern the removal of the artwork, but only its meanings and interpretation, claiming that, &quot;the people of New Zealand would want the museum to take a strong position on this, not to succumb to intimidation as some other museums have&quot;. The move sought to align Te Papa with other art museums that have taken the side of artistic freedom in spite of well publicised protest (the statuette was banned in Adelaide, stolen in Sydney, and dropped from its British tour).

The leader of the Christian Heritage Party claimed that the sacrilegious display of the statuette was hypocritical, given that the museum is careful not to offend sensitivities about Māori spirituality. Strangely at no time did any of the protesters complain about the many images of Kovaks&#x27; Virgin in a Condom that were published in papers up and down the country. With the help of TV3 Te Papa organised a panel discussion including protesters to try and defuse the situation. Curator Ian Wedde also undertook to consider a more cautious approach with contemporary art exhibitions, ‘In future, we may have to say there&#x27;s a risk management factor to consider.&#x27;

=== Behind the scenes tour advice for women ===
Advice for pregnant and menstruating women to avoid a behind-the-scenes tour of some of Te Papa&#x27;s collections in 2010 had some questioning if this was appropriate inclusiveness for a national museum. A Te Papa spokeswoman at the time said the policy was in place because of Māori beliefs surrounding the taonga collection included in the tour &quot;for their own safety&quot;. This generated outrage, with claims that Te Papa was overbearing in terms of political correctness.

=== William Strutt painting dispute ===
Taranaki tribal elders raised objections to a 19th-century Te Papa-owned painting that the museum planned to lend to the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery in New Plymouth in 2019. Te Papa said it hoped the piece, &quot;View of Mt Egmont, Taranaki, New Zealand, taken from New Plymouth, with Maoris driving off settlers&#x27; cattle&quot;, painted by William Strutt, would spark a conversation about historical perspectives.

=== Te Taiao water quality falsification ===
In 2019, the museum faced criticism from farmers, and National Party MP Todd Muller over a container of brown dyed water which was part of a display in the museum&#x27;s Te Taiao Nature exhibition. This water was labelled as &quot;water from a typical farm stream&quot; with an image of a cow defecating in a waterway, and was classed as undrinkable. Te Papa spokeswoman Kate Camp also told Stuff that the bottles had been created for display purposes only and were not samples. Camp stated that, &quot;this display is about telling the story of New Zealand waterways. It&#x27;s based on robust research that shows that many waterways in New Zealand—in urban and rural areas—aren&#x27;t fit to drink or to swim in&quot;.

=== Exposure of adult content to children ===
In 2020, several children were exposed to mature content without sufficient warning messages. Te Papa head of art Charlotte Davy said the museum would be making warning signs more obvious and installing new ones.

=== Te Tiriti o Waitangi exhibition protest ===

On 11 December 2023, a wooden display panel showing an English version of the Treaty of Waitangi at the museum&#x27;s Signs of a Nation Te Tiriti o Waitangi exhibition was damaged and partially blacked out with spray paint and an angle grinder by protesters from a group calling itself Te Waka Hourua. The group had demanded the panel&#x27;s removal from display for allegedly misleading visitors into thinking that it was a translation of the document. Twelve people were arrested. Museum officials said that they acknowledged the group&#x27;s message and said that they were renewing the display, adding that the damaged panel would remain on display in its current form over the 2023–2024 summer.

<text>Lucky Philip Dube (pronounced &quot;duu-beh&quot;; 3 August 1964 – 18 October 2007) was a South African reggae musician and Rastafarian. His record sales across the world earned him the Best Selling African Musician prize at the 1996 World Music Awards. In his lyrics, Dube discussed issues affecting South Africans and Africans in general to a global audience. He recorded 22 albums in a 25-year period and was Africa&#x27;s best-selling reggae artist of all time. Dube was murdered in the Johannesburg suburb of Rosettenville on the evening of 18 October 2007.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Lucky Dube was born in Ermelo, Transvaal (now Mpumalanga), on 3 August 1964. His parents separated before his birth, and he was raised by his mother, who named him &quot;Lucky&quot; because she considered his birth fortunate after a number of failed pregnancies. Along with his two siblings, Thandi and Mandla, Dube spent much of his childhood with his grandmother, Sarah, while his mother relocated to work. In a 1999 interview, he described his grandmother as &quot;his greatest love&quot;, who &quot;multiplied many things to bring up this responsible individual that I am today&quot;.

===Musical beginnings===
Dube worked as a gardener in his younger years but later decided to go to school in order to improve his economic prospects. There, he joined a choir and with some friends, formed his first musical ensemble, the Skyway Band. While at school, he discovered the Rastafari movement. At the age of eighteen, Dube joined his cousin&#x27;s band, the Love Brothers, playing Zulu pop music known as mbaqanga. The band signed with Teal Record Company and recorded the album &quot;Lucky Dube and the Supersoul&quot;, and Dube began to learn English. In 1986, together with his cousin Richard Siluma, Dube released the Afrikaans album &quot;Die Kaapse Dans&quot;, followed by the EP &quot;Help My Krap&quot;, the same year, under the name Oom Hansie.

===Reggae===
On the release of his fifth album, Dave Segal (who became Dube&#x27;s sound engineer) encouraged him to drop the &quot;Supersoul&quot; element of the name. All subsequent albums were recorded as Lucky Dube. Around this time, the singer noticed that fans were responding positively to some reggae songs he played during concerts. Drawing inspiration from Jimmy Cliff and Peter Tosh, he felt the socio-political messages associated with Jamaican reggae were relevant to a South African audience in an institutionally racist society.

He decided to try the new musical genre, and in 1984, released the mini album &quot;Rastas Never Die&quot;. The record sold poorly—around 4,000 units—in comparison to the 30,000 units his mbaqanga records would sell. Keen to suppress anti-apartheid activism, the regime banned the album in 1985, because of its critical lyrics, such as in the song &quot;War and Crime&quot;. Dube was not discouraged, however, and continued to perform the reggae tracks live and wrote and produced a second reggae album, &quot;Think About the Children&quot;, in 1985. It achieved Platinum sales status and established Dube as a popular reggae artist in South Africa, in addition to attracting attention outside his homeland.

===Commercial and critical success===
Dube continued to release commercially successful albums. In 1989, he won four OKTV Awards for &quot;Prisoner&quot;, one for &quot;Captured Live&quot; the following year, and another two for &quot;House of Exile&quot;, the year after. His 1993 album, &quot;Victims&quot;, sold over one million copies worldwide. In 1995, he earned a worldwide recording contract with Motown. His 1995 album, &quot;Trinity&quot;, was the first release on Tabu Records after Motown&#x27;s acquisition of the label.

In 1996, he released the compilation album &quot;Serious Reggae Business&quot;, which led to him being named the &quot;Best Selling African Recording Artist&quot; at the World Music Awards and the &quot;International Artist of the Year&quot; at the Ghana Music Awards. His next three records each won South African Music Awards. His 2006 album, &quot;Respect&quot;, earned a European release through a deal with Warner Music. Dube toured internationally, sharing stages with artists such as Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Peter Gabriel, and Sting. He appeared at the 1991 Reggae Sunsplash (uniquely that year, he was invited back onstage for a 25-minute-long encore) and the 2005 Live 8 event in Johannesburg.

In addition to performing music, Dube was a sometime actor, appearing in the feature films &quot;Voice in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Getting Lucky&quot;, and &quot;Lucky Strikes Back&quot;.

Dube took reggae music and used it as a platform to promote racial equality within South Africa during apartheid. He used the musical genre to frame his arguments about colonialism and the African slave trade, and how he felt that Africa should be reclaimed by the black race.

===Death===
On 18 October 2007, Lucky Dube was killed by armed robbers in Rosettenville, a Johannesburg suburb, shortly after dropping two of his seven children off at their uncle&#x27;s house. Dube was driving his Chrysler 300C, which the assailants were after. Police reports suggest he was shot dead by carjackers who did not recognise him; a state witness additionally claimed that he was targeted under the false notion that he was Nigerian. Five men were arrested in connection with the murder; three were tried and found guilty on 31 March 2009. Two of the men attempted to escape and were caught. Dube&#x27;s convicted killers were sentenced to life in prison.

===Legacy===
On 21 October 2008, Rykodisc released a compilation album entitled &quot;Retrospective&quot;, which featured many of Dube&#x27;s most influential songs as well as tracks previously not released in the United States. The album celebrated Dube&#x27;s music and honored the contributions he made to South Africa.
The Roots Reggae Library has taken steps to store digital versions of the artist&#x27;s mbaqanga albums made in the 1980s. Five of the six albums have been retrieved; &quot;Ngikwethembe Na&quot; has yet to be found.

As one of the first artists to bring African reggae to the mainstream, Dube bridged cultural gaps within the African diaspora. What his music did was &quot;[present] a praxis of cross-culturality and visionary possibility&quot;. Dube gave Africa a voice and put its culture on the global stage by joining the global reggae community. Through taking Jamaican music back to its roots, he recontextualized the oppression and political struggles that reggae seeps itself in, bringing the basis of the diaspora back in conversation with the diaspora at large to allow for a more pan-African form of cultural expression. Dube&#x27;s roots reggae brought African people to the table in terms of conversation about the black diaspora by mimicking Caribbean artists&#x27; assertions of African authenticity.

On 22 September 2017, Gallo Records South Africa released a 25-track limited-edition commemorative album titled &quot;The Times We&#x27;ve Shared&quot;. The album features Dube&#x27;s biggest hits, exclusive performances, and three previously unreleased tracks.

In Australia, Dube&#x27;s music has found resonance in remote Aboriginal communities, and his popularity has led him to be called &quot;Bigger than the Beatles&quot; throughout much of central and northern Australia.

<text>Elizabeth Hitchcock Coit (August 23, 1843 – July 22, 1929) was a patron of San Francisco&#x27;s volunteer firefighters and the benefactor for the construction of the Coit Tower in San Francisco, California.

==Life==
Born in West Point, New York, in 1843, she moved to California from West Point with her parents—Charles, an Army doctor, and Martha Hitchcock.

&quot;Firebelle Lil&quot; Coit was considered eccentric, smoking cigars and wearing trousers long before it was socially acceptable for women to do so. She was an avid gambler and often dressed like a man in order to gamble in the male-only establishments that dotted North Beach.

Her father was successful and when he died he left a substantial inheritance. As a young woman, she traveled to Europe with her mother. After her return, she married Howard Coit, the &quot;caller&quot; of the San Francisco Stock Exchange during an economic boom. They separated in 1880, and he died in 1885 at age 47.

In 1903, Alexander Garrett, a distant cousin of Mrs. Coit, arrived at her Palace Hotel apartment armed with a gun to settle a business dispute. A friend of Mrs. Coit&#x27;s, Major McClung, who was present in order to deliver a message to her was shot and killed while reportedly protecting Coit. Toward the end of her life, Coit had a long stay in Europe but returned to San Francisco where she died in 1929.

== Firefighting ==
Coit was fascinated by firefighters from a young age. At age 15, in 1858, she reportedly witnessed the Knickerbocker Engine Co. No. 5 respond to a fire call on Telegraph Hill when they were shorthanded, and helped them get up the hill ahead of other competing engine companies. Sources differ on whether this happened while she was coming home from school or coming from a rehearsal for a wedding. She was thereafter treated as a &quot;mascot&quot; of the firefighters, and after her return from travel in Europe, in October 1863, she was made an honorary member of the engine company. She then rode along with the firefighters when they went to a fire or were in parades, and attended their annual banquets. When volunteer firefighters were ill, she visited the sickbed, and when they died, Coit sent flowers and attended the funerals. She continued this relationship with firefighting throughout her life, and after her death her ashes were placed into a mausoleum with a variety of firefighting-related memorials.

== Bequest ==

Coit left one-third of her estate to the City of San Francisco &quot;to be expended in an appropriate manner for the purpose of adding to the beauty of the city which I have always loved&quot;. The city used this bequest to build Coit Tower on Telegraph Hill.

The remainder of her bequest also sponsored another neighborhood landmark, a statue of three firefighters at the northwest corner of Washington Square Park.

<text>Prophets of Da City (POC) is a hip hop crew from Cape Town, South Africa. They are composed of about eight members, though the exact membership fluctuates frequently; these include Ishmael Morabe (vocals), Mark Heuvel (dance), Shaheen Ariefdien, Ramone and DJ Ready D. Their style uses elements of hip hop music, reggae and traditional African rhythms. Their albums include Our World (1990), Boom Style (1992), Age of Truth (1993), Phunk Phlow (1994), Universal Souljaz (1995), and Ghetto Code (1997). They are currently signed under the independent record label Ghetto Ruff.

==History==
===1988–1990: Early years === 
The group began in late 1988 when Shaheen and Ready D experimented in a small 8-track studio (owned by Shaheen&#x27;s father, Issy Ariefdien and Lance Stehr the current Ghetoruff CEO) and produced a demo that ultimately became &quot;Our World&quot; (1990), the first South African hip hop release. Although the production value was not exactly stellar it did attempt to interpret hiphop through their unique Cape Town influences and experiences (both musically and lyrically). The album had the first recorded Cape slang (local Afrikaans dialect) hip-hop song called &#x27;Dala Flat&#x27; (do it thoroughly). It also consisted of an uptempo goema inspired &#x27;Stop the Violence&#x27; and the hip house meets mbaqanga title track. It also featured the Abdullah Ibrahim inspired &quot;Roots&quot; that featured DJ A-ski on the turntables. Although POC was quite a novelty to the South African music scene, record labels were turned off by their social commentary and favoured a more party music approach. Lance, POC manager, set up Ku-shu shu Records and signed a distribution and marketing deal through Teal Trutone (Gallo subsidiary). In 1990 POC was nominated for the OKTV Award for Best New Group. They also embarked on an extensive 80-leg anti-drug school tour that reached an average of 70 000 students.

===1991–1992: &quot;Boom Style&quot; ===
The second release in late 1991 was &quot;Boom Style&quot; (referring to the hardhitting punch of a TR-808 drum machine kick drum or self-praise of the way the music is kicking – although often mistaken to mean &quot;tree style&quot; because &quot;boom&quot; means &quot;tree&quot; in Afrikaans). While the album had a scathing attack on the apartheid regime in the song &#x27;Ons Stem&#x27; (meaning our voice – as a response to the apartheid national anthem &#x27;die stem&#x27; – the voice) and the innovative Hard Time on Stage, the follow-up to &quot;Murder on Stage&quot; from &quot;Our World&quot;, it was less experimental. The lead single, &quot;Boom Style&quot;, like their first single, Our World, aimed to fuse contemporary US hiphop influenced dance music with mbaqanga styled guitar riffs. While Our World was rather innocent and daring for its time, Boom Style reflected the realities of operating within the music industry and the pressures of the market on POC. The censorship board sent a formal letter to the label to express their displeasure over the use of the Afrikaner national anthem in which POC not only mocked &#x27;Die Stem&#x27;, but also disrespected Afrikaner and other colonial political icons. Their live shows incorporated all aspects of hip hop culture and not only emceeing. Turntablism, Breakdancing and even aerosol art at times were used to not only present POC but represent hip hop culture and expose to parts of South Africa where people did not know what hip hop was. The video for &#x27;Kicking Non Stop&#x27; was censored because members of the crew put a portrait of the then president, P. W. Botha, in a fridge to chill. This year the POC social issues based tour covered another 45 schools.

In 1992 they were invited by Quincy Jones and Caiphus Semenya to perform at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. This year they embarked on a Namibian anti-drug campaign, covering 65 schools. They also got increasingly more involved in facilitating workshops on deejaying, b-boying and developing hip hop writing techniques. Leading up to the first democratically held election in South Africa, POC embarked on a national voter education campaign. Although Issy Ariefdien has been involved in group&#x27;s production since the first album, POC also brought former rival Patrick Hickey a.k.a. Caramel (then an emcee and producer with emcees from U.N.C.L.E.) on board as part of the production team for the Age of Truth album.

===1993 and beyond===
In late 1993 POC was invited to perform in Denmark at the Visions of Africa music festival and also embarked on a national voter education tour, covering high schools, community centres and universities. The aim was to explain the voting process to youth who never had the opportunity to vote in any national elections. The democratically held election marked an important moment in the history of South Africa, but also the history of hip hop in South Africa, because it was an acknowledgment of the popularity and power of hiphop as a pedagogical tool.

In 1994, POC performed at the inauguration of Nelson Mandela where they sang their song &quot;Excellent, finally black President&quot;. The fact that they were invited was extremely important to them. The members of Prophets of Da City grew up during apartheid and this truly meant a lot to the group. Mark Schwartz writes, &quot;Times were good until one day in 1985 when tanks rolled down the main drag of Mitchell&#x27;s Plain Township, and Ready and his homie Shaheen put down the vinyl and picked up bricks and gasoline bombs to hurl at apartheid&#x27;s army. For the next nine years, through a state of emergency, political upheaval, and economic turmoil, Ready, Shaheen and their posse Prophets of Da City persevered until finally they got to drop bombs at another revolution, as the only performers at the inauguration of South Africa&#x27;s president Nelson Mandella&quot;. This step for POC was not only major for racial barriers but for rap in South Africa. This has been considered the song that brought hip hop more into the mainstream of South Africa when previously, hip hop had been more of an underground movement whose fans consisted mainly of the poorer class in the urban areas of Cape Town.

In 2006 Sean Drummond and Dylan Valley, two student filmmakers, tracked down the whereabouts of the POC members. The documentary titled Lost Prophets was screened at various film festivals in South Africa.

POC celebrated 20 years since the release of South Africa&#x27;s first hip hop album, &#x27;Our World&#x27; in 2015.

==Inspiration==
Inspired by the production styles of the Bomb Squad (Public Enemy) and Boogiemen (Ice Cube), &quot;Age of Truth&quot; is arguably their most militant and musically daring album. This album is generally considered South Africa&#x27;s first hip hop classic album. Although Age of Truth won album of the year in various publications, the majority of the songs were banned.
The 1993 song Understand Where I&#x27;m Coming From provides background for some of the struggles about which POC raps by explaining many of the hardships faced in daily life. &quot;The song is about empowering yourself as an individual and moving forward as a community&quot; claims musician Ready D. &quot;Understand Where I&#x27;m Coming From&quot; also appeared on the Tommy Boy Planet Rap album which featured 12 hip hop crews from around the world. The album was recorded and mixed at Bop Studios in the then Bantustan, Bophutatswana. The head engineer at Bop Studios worked with POC before and offered them a deal to record an album at an extraordinary reduced rate. POC found out that the aim behind Bop Studios was to entice big music stars to record there to legitimise Bophutatswana as a sovereign state. When the group heard about this while they recorded there, they included the lines &quot;Fuck Mangope (Bophutatswana&#x27;s head of fake state) even if we record here&quot;. The head engineer confiscated all the mixed DATs and confronted the group about certain remarks made on the album. After a heated debate the group left with a &#x27;stolen&#x27; backup copy of the mixed album that eventually became the released version.

==Lyrical themes==
POC&#x27;s songs were often filled with socio-political messages about the state of South Africa&#x27;s social and economic issues in the urban areas, which were the most economically depressed. According to the article &quot;Globalization and Gangster Rap: Hip Hop in the Post-Apartheid City&quot;, their 1993 song &quot;Understand Where I&#x27;m Coming From&quot; was a &quot;lament about poverty and social dislocation in the ghetto, questioning the wisdom of patriotism in a class stratified society&quot;, as can be inferred from the opening of the song: &quot;Why should I fight for a country&#x27;s glory / When it ignores me? / Besides, the township&#x27;s already a war zone / So why complain or moan?&quot; The song also questions the degree to which this new post-Apartheid South Africa is actually new, since there are still racial and class inequalities throughout the communities. The music created as a result of these types of struggles takes the form of hip hop because &quot;young African and Coloured youth... see hip hop and its subcultures as the art form that best expresses their feelings of economic marginality and social dislocation&quot;. Many connections can be seen between POC&#x27;s style of hip hop and the broader American style of hip hop. In &quot;Understand where I&#x27;m Coming From&quot;, feelings of rebellion and separation from central government are rapped about just as they might be in politically conscious American hip hop; also, in the POC song &quot;Dallah Flet 2&quot;, &quot;negative and misogynistic attitudes towards single mothers&quot; are rapped about, something which author Zine Magubane claims is &quot;ubiquitous in American rap music&quot;. POC&#x27;s gender politics on &quot;Age of Truth&quot; was first analysed in a 2001 article titled “Black Thing: Hip-Hop Nationalism, ‘Race’ and Gender in Prophets of da City and Brasse vannie Kaap” by Adam Haupt, who argued that some of the gender-based problems on this album could partly be explained by the crew&#x27;s black nationalist politics. Black nationalism, like other forms of nationalism, tended to privilege patriarchal imperatives and marginalised female subjects. Hip-hop nationalism in the early 90s reflected some of these problems. As Haupt&#x27;s analysis of Cape hip-hop activism in the book &quot;Stealing Empire&quot; reveals, POC&#x27;s work is best compared to black nationalist US hip-hop of the late 80s and late 90s—and not gangsta rap, as suggested by “Globalization and Gangster Rap: Hip Hop in the Post-Apartheid City”. This is particularly significant in the light of their parody of gangsta rap on songs like &quot;Wack MCs&quot; off &quot;Phunk Phlow&quot;. &quot;Stealing Empire&quot; contends that the sometimes simplistic cultural imperialism thesis in some scholarship about hip-hop beyond the US is limited when considering the artistic and political agency of activists and artists who hope to use hip-hop as a means to engage youth critically about their lives in South African townships. By way of caution, Magubane&#x27;s article credits the Black Consciousness song &quot;Black Thing&quot; to Black Noise when it was, in fact, composed and recorded by POC.

==Notable co-performances==
The group has also performed around famous artists like James Brown, Public Enemy, The Fugees, Ice-T, Quincy Jones and more.

<text>Happy Families is a rural comedy drama written by Ben Elton which was a BBC series first broadcast in 1985. It recounts the tale of the dysfunctional Fuddle family. It stars Jennifer Saunders as Granny Fuddle, Dawn French as the Cook and Adrian Edmondson as her imbecilic grandson Guy.

==Premise==
The series centred on Guy&#x27;s attempts to find his four sisters – also played by Saunders – for a family reunion.

==Cast==

===Main===
*Jennifer Saunders as Granny, Cassie, Madeleine, Joyce and Roxanne Fuddle
*Adrian Edmondson as Guy Fuddle, Grandpa Harold Fuddle
*Dawn French as Cook
*Stephen Fry as Dr. De Quincy
*Helen Lederer as Flossie

*Jim Broadbent as Dalcroix
*Hugh Laurie as Jim
*Una Stubbs as Mother Superior
*Christine Edmunds as Maxine
*Ceri Jackson as Sister Ophelia
*Claudette Williams as Jill
*Rik Mayall as Nazi pastor
*Chris Barrie as Sammy

==Production and visual style==
Each sister&#x27;s story was shot in a different &quot;style&quot; of film; Cassie&#x27;s story was shot to make it appear to be a U.S. soap opera, Madelaine&#x27;s story was shot in soft focus to make it appear to be a French film, Roxanne&#x27;s story was filmed as though appearing in a gritty BBC documentary, and Joyce&#x27;s story was filmed like an Ealing comedy.

==Episodes==

=== Introduction (a.k.a. Edith) ===

The first episode focuses on Edith Fuddle (Saunders), who is told by her doctor De Quincy (Stephen Fry), that she has Corrington&#x27;s disease, and will die within nine months. Throughout the series de Quincy shows himself to be tactless, forgetful and almost negligent - he constantly forgets to inform Cook that she is pregnant, and at one stage injects himself with a dose of morphine intended for Edith. Although in a bitter feud with her grandson (Ade Edmondson), she enlists his help to go out into the world to find his four sisters, and to bring them back to her for a family reunion before she dies.

=== Cassie ===

The second eldest, Cassie, has become a huge star in Hollywood under the name Cassie Epris-Curtis. Pampered by everyone who surrounds her, Cassie has cut off all ties with her British heritage. Although, as Guy arrives, Cassie is revealed to be a stressed, spoiled actress who throws tantrums over tiny flaws, and after ruining a scene of the show where she has gained her fame, she is fired, and reluctantly takes up Guy&#x27;s offer to return to her grandmother.

=== Madeleine ===

In the third episode, the life of Madeleine, the second youngest granddaughter is revealed. Now living in the house of a renowned poet, Dalcroix (Jim Broadbent). Naive, and now with a French accent, Madeleine is loyal to her adopted housefather, unaware that he is a peeping tom. Guy arrives to the town where Dalcroix resides, and finds that the town (made up of Nazis) hates Dalcroix, and all that he stands for. Their anger finally bubbles over, after a postcard featuring Madeleine in a suggestive pose finds Guy, and led by their local priest (Rik Mayall) the town revolts and burns Dalcroix at the stake. Now, without purpose, Madeleine agrees with Guy&#x27;s proposals to return to her childhood home.

=== Joyce ===

Episode 4 sees the life of Joyce, the eldest, who is now a Catholic nun, after a miracle featuring the Madonna Mary, a tree and a conker. Joyce, who has been a novice for 19 years, is regularly punished by the sadistic Sister Prudence. Although she fancies herself as a jolly, upbeat joker, everyone who encounters Joyce finds her irritating and thick. However, Joyce proves to be a brilliant sleuth (unintentionally) and foils the Mother Superior&#x27;s (Una Stubbs) plan to take over England, and reinstate the Catholic Monarchy, with the help of Guy, who fools Joyce into leaving the nunnery and return home, disguised as the angel Gabriel. Joyce announces her plans to vacate the convent to all the other nuns, much to their delight.

=== Roxanne ===

The penultimate episode focuses on the youngest sister, Roxanne, who at 20 years old, is now in HMP Long Mangley serving 50 years for contributory negligence. Obsessed with the documentary &quot;On the Mangle&quot;, which focuses on the inmates of Long Mangley, Guy hatches a plan to spring Roxanne by using a giant chocolate box, which, surprisingly, works, although all the prisoners are released for a &quot;stroll&quot;. An emotional Guy and a bewildered Roxanne are finally able to go home.

=== Reunion ===

The final episode reunites all of the family together back in Fuddlewich—the four granddaughters return by various means of transport to their childhood home, and they all encounter one sister, although none of them recognise the other.

Joyce returns by train, and has a brief meeting with Madeleine, and they both leave the train station, neither recognising the other. Cassie has caught a cab from America, which is breaking down by the time it nears Fuddlewich. Roxanne, who has walked from her prison, is stopped by Cassie who notes that it is a coincidence that they both have double syllable Christian names (despite Roxanne stating that her name is Fuddle, the same as Cassie).

The granddaughters return to the home of their grandparents, and are placed in the dining room, and starved until Edith is ready to see them. They are then brought into the billiard room, where they all conference, and Edith tells them why she has brought them back together. Edith reveals that she has not brought them back out of love (as Guy first thought), she hates them all deeply. She reveals that Harold (her husband, who died nine months before), was a pervert and &quot;loved&quot; his granddaughters deeply. Not wanting to lose her husband, Edith called social services and reported the incident, which allowed Edith to get rid of the girls. She also reveals the fate of their mother, who died destitute in a ditch of a broken-heart, after being hit by a car (presumably driven by Edith).

Edith was left with her husband and Guy, who was hated even as a child. She also tells the girls that on the same day that Guy began his search, she had been told that she was suffering from Corrington&#x27;s Disease, which kills the victim in nine months. She reveals this as the reason she has brought the girls back. She tells her granddaughters, that the only cure is to get one organ from four donors of the same bloodline and gender, and offers to give them all one quarter of her entire estate, in order to get her vital operation. All of them agree, however just as the operation is about to begin, Flossy the maid barges in to tell them that Cook has died after turning blue (a symptom of Corringtons). Doctor De Quincy comes to the conclusion that he must have mixed up the urine samples, and that Edith must be pregnant (at nearly 80 years of age). Edith suddenly goes into labour, and shortly afterwards gives birth to a baby boy. Still bitter and resentful, she dismisses the girls to return to their pathetic existence. Cassie, however, challenges her, saying they still have the documents and want their inheritance now. Edith reluctantly agrees and also offers to give them her newborn as well. None of the girls want him but offer their grandmother a £50 per week allowance for the sake of their newborn uncle. The episode ends with Edith left in an empty house with Guy who is to be wed to Flossy.

<doc id="1225990" wikidata="Q3643103" url="?curid=1225990" title="Bles Bridges">
<text>Bles Bridges (22 July 1946, in Viljoensdrif, Orange Free State – 24 March 2000, near Bloemhof, North West), born Lawrence John Gabriel Bridges, was a South African singer. He became known as Bles Bridges, as his Irish grandfather called him &quot;Bles&quot; (meaning &quot;bald&quot; in Afrikaans), due to his very thin hair from an early age.

Married to Leonie Bridges from 1969 until his death on 24 March 2000, he also had a long-term relationship with Marietjie van Heerden in the 90s. 
He made his 1st album in 1972 under the nickname, Morné with a lady called Mini van Heerden (1938-2018), called, Adios, my skat.
He released his first solo album in 1982, &quot;Onbekende Weermagman&quot; (Unknown Soldier). His professional career began in 1984, with the release of his second album, &quot;Bles&quot;, which went gold in under a month (25,000 copies) and included &quot;Maggie&quot;, one of his better-known songs. The album had sold twice that by the time his third album was released. At the time of his death, Bles had sold more than 2.6 million albums (records and CDs). Up to 2016, he sold over 3 million records, making him the biggest selling male singer in the Afrikaans Music industry.

Soon Bles Bridges began alternating between Afrikaans and English language albums, to great acclaim. He also began working with Eurovision South Africa. In 2000, he began recording an album with his friends in the music industry. The first song - a duet with Patricia Lewis (and his last song as it turned out, as he died within a week of finishing it) - was &quot;The First Kiss Goodnight&quot; by Dennis East; it was recorded on 21 March 2000. His biggest hit was &quot;Ruiter van die Windjie&quot; (Rider of the Wind), which was released in 1986.

In the 1980s, he held a concert in support of the Volkshulpskema (People&#x27;s Help Scheme) of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, a far right paramilitary organisation, which raised R10,000.

He had cancer during the 1980s and gave generously to charity for cancer research after his recovery. His wife Leonie was his sound engineer and the composer and/or songwriter of most of his songs, including most of his biggest hits, including &quot;Maggie&quot; and &quot;I am the Eagle, you&#x27;re the Wind&quot;, among others. It was his custom to hand out roses to some of the female audience members in the front row at his concerts.. This was also the basis for a Leon Schuster skit, in the hit movie, Oh Schucks ... It&#x27;s Schuster! (1989). In the skit, Shuster, dressed as an Afrikaner lady, became irate when Bridges refused to give her a rose. Chaos ensued.

His career highlight was when he performed to a soldout 8,000-seater Super Bowl at Sun City, five times on one weekend, becoming the first and only artist to do so, as feature artist on 14 and 15 November 1987. He actually managed to draw a bigger crowd than Frank Sinatra did when he opened the Super Bowl in 1982.

Bles died in a motorcar accident on 24 March 2000, leaving behind his wife, Leonie, and children Sunette and Victor. More than 20,000 mourners turned up for his funeral.

On 26 January 2020, Bles was also inaugurated as a living legend in the South African Legends Museum. He was one of only 20 legends from whom a bust was also made.

<text>Josephus Maria Van der Veken (also spelled Vander Veken; 1872 – 1964) was a Belgian art restorer, copyist, and art forger who mastered the art of reproducing the works of early Netherlandish painters.

==Early life==
Jef Van der Veken was born in Antwerp, where his parents operated a crystal and porcelain ware business. From a young age, Van der Veken nourished artistic ambitions. While performing his compulsory military service, he attended drawing classes at the Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp. Here he learned the art of painting by copying photographs and making free adaptations of the old masters. He completed his academic training at the top of his class. Van der Veken then started to make pastiches on order and established himself as an antique dealer in Brussels in 1908. He became so skilled in mimicking the style of the old masters that his works were taken for originals and some were even sold as such. For instance, at the 1927 London exhibition on Flemish and Belgian Art between 1300 and 1900 a work by his hand was exhibited as an original old master. Van der Veken had to convince the organizers to remove the painting that he had made on the basis of a badly damaged original, provoking a scandal.

The start of World War I marked a change in his professional and artistic career as Van der Veken shifted his interest to restoration work and perfected his own restoration process, the &quot;hyperrestauration&quot;. This process consisted in the recovery of an old, damaged or modest work, which served as the support for a new creation. He was passionate about the Flemish Primitives, particularly Rogier van der Weyden and Jan van Eyck, and prided himself on having rediscovered the technique of painting with eggs which according to him had been used by early Netherlandish painters. It has been demonstrated since that the basis of the technique of early Netherlandish painters was not the use of eggs but the use of oil-based paint.

==Association with Renders==
Van der Veken&#x27;s association with started in the early 1920s. Renders was a wealthy banker and mecenas from Bruges who had the necessary funds to buy damaged or modest works which he asked Van der Veken to restore through the hyperrestoration process. Van der Veken restored 16 paintings acquired by Renders using this method. The works restored by Van der Veken thus accounted for an important portion of the collection of old masters that Renders built up and which was referred to as the &quot;Renders Collection&quot;. The Renders Collection came to be regarded as one of the principal private collections of Early Netherlandish paintings and had a prominent place in the 1927 London exhibition of Flemish old masters.

On the strength of the reputation of his collection, Renders profiled himself as an informed connoisseur of Flemish old masters. He published studies in which he cast doubt on the existence of Hubert van Eyck and identified the Master of Flémalle with Rogier van der Weyden (current scholarship identifies the Master of Flémalle with Robert Campin, the teacher of Rogier van der Weyden). These publications aroused lively polemics with reputed art historians.

At the 1935 World Exhibition in Brussels, three works, of which the visible surface had been executed mainly by Van der Veken, where exhibited under the name of Rogier van der Weyden: one as an original work by van der Weyden (the Madonna with Child or &#x27;Renders Madonna&#x27;, now in the Museum of Fine Arts in Tournai) and two as works by van der Weyden&#x27;s workshop.

==Recognition as restorer==
Van der Veken&#x27;s reputation as a restorer was such that internationally renowned art historians Leo van Puyvelde and Georges Hulin de Loo recommended him to the Royal Museum of Fine Arts of Belgium. He worked there for many years as a restorer using methods of restoration that were less controversial and more in line with contemporary ideas and insights in the field of restoration. He was soon recognized as a renowned expert and was invited to take on the restoration of the finest panels of Hans Memling held by the Old St. John&#x27;s Hospital and the Groeningemuseum in Bruges. Van der Veken considered his restoration of Jan van Eyck&#x27;s Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele in 1934 as his most honorable commission.

==Copy of &quot;The Just Judges&quot;==
In 1934 the panel of &quot;The Just Judges&quot;, which formed the lower left panel of the &quot;Ghent Altarpiece&quot;, by Jan van Eyck or his brother Hubert Van Eyck was stolen and had not been recovered. Van der Veken decided in 1939 to make a copy of the panel using a two centuries old closet shelf as the support. He made the copy of the missing painting on the basis of a copy that Michiel Coxie (1499-1592) had produced in the mid-sixteenth century for Philip II of Spain and was kept at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium. He interrupted his work during the Second World War and resumed work in 1945, this time in the Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent where the &quot;Ghent Altarpiece&quot; had been moved to the Vijdtkapel. In order to harmonize his copy with the appearance of the other panels of the &quot;Ghent Altarpiece&quot; he applied a layer of wax to create a similar patina. Van der Veken subtly indicated that his work was a copy by giving one of the horsemen the facial features of the then Belgian king Leopold III.

The local authority in charge of managing religious property, called the &#x27;Kerkfabriek&#x27;, had become interested in acquiring the copy to replace the stolen panel. The Kerkfabriek and Van der Veken were initially not able to agree on the fee payable. Van der Veken asked 300,000 Belgian francs for his work - a large sum in those days - but the Kerkfabriek did not agree to pay this fee. In the end after much discussion, an agreement was reached in 1957: the Kerkfabriek would pay 75,000 francs, the Belgian State 150,000 francs.

Following Van der Veken&#x27;s completion of the copy, there have been persistent rumours that the original of the work lies beneath his copy. Undeniably, the high quality of the copy plays a major role in this remarkable assertion. Technical research has shown that the copy was made out on a wooden carrier, which is entirely unrelated to that of the original.

==Legacy==
Van der Veken continued to work for the Central Laboratory of the Museums of Belgium after the Second World War. Despite the onset of blindness he remained active until the end of his life, and his son-in-law, Albert Philippot, who had been trained by Van der Veken, gradually took over his restoration tasks. It is Albert Philippot who commenced the restoration of the Ghent Altarpiece in 1950. Van der Veken died in Ixelles in 1964.

==Controversies surrounding the Renders Collection==
While during the Second World War, Van der Veken continued his restoration work for the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Renders took the opportunity to sell the 20 early Netherlandish paintings in the Renders Collection, including the hyperrestored works on which Van der Veken had worked, to the German Nazi leader Hermann Goering for the price of 300 kilograms of gold.

After the war, the Belgian state claimed the 20 works back as looted art. Only half of the works were recovered. Renders commenced judicial proceedings against the Belgian state claiming that he had never been paid for the paintings. The truth was, however, revealed when letters were discovered in the archive of Goering that showed that Renders had negotiated with Goering on the sale of his Gothic sculptures.

==More controversy and accusations of forgery==

The role played by Renders as an art collector and his relationship with Jef Van der Veken were finally questioned at the end of the 20th century. The discussion was initiated as a result of studies on three of the paintings that had belonged to the Renders Collection, had been sold to Goering and were subjected to modern scientific research decades after the war. The paintings are referred to as the &quot;Renders Magdalena&quot;, the &quot;Renders Madonna&quot; and the &quot;Renders Man of Sorrows&quot;.

===The Renders Magdalena===
The Renders Magdalena is a portrait of Mary Magdalene, that was claimed to be a copy of the right panel of the Braque Triptych by Rogier van der Weyden, the original of which hangs in The Louvre. The Renders Magdalena started as a bad old copy, which was acquired by a collector in Antwerp around 1885 and then bequeathed to the museum of Ghent in 1914. The museum refused the painting because of its mediocrity and put it up for sale in Ghent in 1920. It was bought by an antique dealer in Dendermonde from whom Renders acquired it. Renders asked Van der Veken to restore the painting. When the painting reappeared 6 years later at an exhibition in Bern, the painting had been drastically changed. What had appeared a mediocre copy had become a masterpiece that was attributed to the entourage of Hans Memling. However, not all contemporary art experts were impressed by this metamorphosis and they raised doubts about the work&#x27;s authenticity.
Acquired by Goering from Renders, the panel was brought to Spain by Alois Miedl, an agent of Goering, after World War II. In 1966 he sold the panel to a Scandinavian collector. When the collector died, his heirs wanted to have an expert opinion on its value and in 2004 they sent the panel to the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage in Brussels.

Based on its research findings, the institute concluded that the painting was painted on top of an older painting, which had been scraped off to the preparation layer. The institute also found that modern paints had been used in the restoration and that the restorer had made new underdrawings and used various techniques to recreate the craquelure of the painting. The institute also discovered that Van der Veken had made some minor changes to the back of the panel, probably in an attempt to make the work appear more similar to the original van der Weyden and increase its appearance of authenticity. All of these interventions by Van der Veken can be qualified as amounting to an intention to create a forgery.

The Renders Magdalena was not returned to the owners as it was claimed by the Belgian state.

===The Renders Madonna===

The second controversy involves the Renders Madonna which Renders had sold to Goering and after its return to Belgium has been part of the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts of Tournai where it is attributed to the &#x27;School of Rogier van der Weyden&#x27;.

Originally, the Renders Madonna panel had been part of a diptych attributed to Rogier van der Weyden. The other half is a portrait of the donor Jean Gros, which has been located in the Art Institute of Chicago since 1933. The diptych was probably separated in 1867, the year in which the portrait of Jean Gros was shown at an exhibition in Bruges, organized by the historian James Weale. It was probably the deplorable material condition of the Madonna which led to the decision to separate the two panels of the diptych. A German photo from World War I shows the battered state of the panel at that time.

When he was asked by Renders to restore the Madonna, Van der Veken endeavored to reconstruct all that had been irretrievably lost and damaged. He used his very &#x27;radical&#x27; hyperrestoration method. His intervention still determines the present condition of the painting, and there is no visible aging.

Research carried out in 1999–2000 by the Laboratoire d’étude des œuvres d’art par les méthodes scientifiques (French: &quot;Laboratory for the Scientific Examination of Artworks&quot;) of the Université Catholique de Louvain made it possible to determine the extent of the restoration and to describe the restoration process in detail. The research showed that Van der Veken had literally scraped off the bottom part of the painting, thereby removing the original painting in that area. He must have felt that it would be more efficient to start over than to preserve the remaining original paint residue. He proceeded in the same manner in other areas of the painting, especially in the image of the Child, where he entirely repainted the lower part of the face and shoulders. Van der Veken also painted several areas with new paint probably because they were worn. In addition, he painted over entire surfaces, rather than execute multiple, small retouches to integrate the whole picture. Like in the restoration of the Renders Magdalena, he again mimicked the craquelure through various methods. Radiographic recording showed how little is left of the original paint layers.

===The Renders Man of Sorrows===
Another painting of the Renders Collection, a 15th-century Man of Sorrows owned by the Metropolitan Museum in New York was submitted to testing in 1992. It had already been relegated to the museum&#x27;s storage in 1974 after experts from the Courtauld Institute of Art deemed it to be a completely modern forgery. The 1992 tests came to the conclusion that the painting was based on an original painting of the second half of the 15th century to which a later restorer deceptively had added new elements such as the background and the figure of the angel. The suspicion is that this restorer was Jef Van der Veken.

===Conclusion===
The conclusion of the recent scientific findings is that both Van der Veken and Renders appear to have engaged in intentional art forgery. Since these revelations, all the works that had belonged to the Renders Collection or had been handled by Van der Veken and even his son-in-law Albert Philippot, many of which hang in major museums in Belgium and abroad, are viewed with suspicion.

<text>Ernst Johannes Wigforss (24 January 1881–2 January 1977) was a Swedish politician and linguist (dialectologist), mostly known as a prominent member of the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party and Swedish Minister of Finance. Wigforss became one of the main theoreticians in the development of the Swedish Social Democratic movement&#x27;s revision of Marxism, from a revolutionary to a reformist organization. He was inspired and stood ideologically close to the ideas of the Fabian Society and guild socialism and inspired by people like R. H. Tawney, L.T. Hobhouse and J. A. Hobson. He made contributions in his early writings about industrial democracy and workers&#x27; self-management.

==Early life and education==
Born in the town of Halmstad in Halland in southwestern Sweden, Wigforss studied at Lund University from 1899, and published writings on political issues in this period. He completed a doctorate in 1913 with a dissertation on the dialect of south Halland, becoming docent in Scandinavian languages at the university the same year. He taught at the gymnasium in Lund (&quot;Lunds högre allmänna läroverk&quot;) 1911-1914 and as lecturer of German and Swedish at the Latin gymnasium in Gothenburg from 1914.

==Political career==
In 1919 Wigforss was elected as a Social Democratic member of the First Chamber of the Swedish Parliament, representing Gothenburg, and he became a member of various committees. He was appointed a member of the third cabinet of Hjalmar Branting in 1924, and after Branting&#x27;s resignation in January 1925, became a member of Rickard Sandler&#x27;s cabinet. He was made temporary Minister of Finance on 24 January 1925 when Fredrik Thorsson fell ill, and succeeded him on 8 May of the same year, following his death. The Sandler cabinet resigned on 7 June 1926.

He was again Minister of Finance in the cabinets of Per Albin Hansson and Tage Erlander from 1932 to 1949.

Wigforss became Gunnar Myrdal&#x27;s main political opponent with respect to the currency crisis of 1947. Swedish historians tend to interpret this crisis as Myrdal&#x27;s political failure, while the historian Orjan Appelqvist argue that it is Wigforss and Axel Gjöres who hold primary responsibility for this political fiasco.

Some say that Wigforss&#x27; economic policies were strongly influenced by John Maynard Keynes, but he may have anticipated Keynes, because he proposed counter-cyclical economic policy before becoming minister of finance in 1932. But it is perhaps most accurate to claim that his main economic influences came from Knut Wicksell. He inspired younger economists like Gunnar Myrdal and the Stockholm school, who worked in the same direction as Keynes at the same time. John Kenneth Galbraith writes that it &quot;would be more fair to say &#x27;The Swedish Economic Revolution&#x27; than the &#x27;Keynesian revolution&#x27; in economics, and that Wigforss was first in this transformation of thinking and practice about economy&quot;.

In his pamphlet &quot;Har vi råd att arbeta? (Can we afford to work?)&quot;, widely believed to have won the 1932 elections for the Social Democrats, he made fun of the Liberal theory that budget cuts are the proper remedy for economic downturns. Although he is considered the creator of the Swedish social democratic economy, controversies with Minister for Social Affairs Gustav Möller (who would have preferred graduated taxation to have been higher) prevented both from being elected party chairman and Prime Minister at the death of Hansson.

==Later life==
After his resignation, Wigforss continued until his death to write and speak on political issues and was considered one of the most innovative and daring Social Democratic politicians. He supported the anti-nuclear movement of the 1950s and contributed to the discontinuation of the Swedish nuclear arms programme in 1962.

==In popular culture==
In the Swedish television movie, &quot;Four Days that shook Sweden - The Midsummer Crisis 1941&quot;, from 1988, he is played by Swedish actor Helge Skoog.

<text>Century Garden () is one of the earliest housing development in Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia. The housing ranges from expensive bungalow houses built at the top of the valley to older, more modest single-storey terrace houses built in the 1960s. It was developed by a visionary and prominent Johor Bahru businessman, Yap Siew Cheng (1918–1970). Ambitious and daring at that time because its location was considered quite far out of Johor Bahru town and surrounded by rubber estates.

The Holiday Plaza shopping centre is in the estate. Its strategic location, close to the city&#x27;s central business district makes it a sought residential area with facilities and amenities and hotels close at hand. Other notable landmarks located in Taman Abad include Metropolis Tower, Menara MAA, New York Hotel and DNP plaza, all of which are located along Jalan Dato Suleiman.

It is also unique and notable for its neighbourhood watch program started in 1999 by long-term resident, Suzie Yap. The ongoing neighbourhood watch program is staffed and funded purely by the residents themselves on a voluntary basis and has succeeded in reducing crime in the area significantly. It was also noted that another old male resident helped to set up road blocks along Jalan Wijaya to control traffic inflow. However, such measures were ridiculed by some residents for there were few automobiles travelling along Jalan Wijaya long before the road blocks were set up.

==Accessibility==
Taman Abad is connected to Jalan Dato Abdullah Tahir and Jalan Dato Suleiman through Tebrau Highway.

<doc id="1226017" wikidata="Q1492171" url="?curid=1226017" title="Galician–Volhynian Chronicle">
<text>The Galician–Volhynian Chronicle (GVC) (, called &quot;Halicz-Wolyn Chronicle&quot; in Polish historiography), also known as Chronicle of Halych–Volhynia and by other names is a prominent work of Old Ruthenian literature and historiography covering 1201–1292 in the history of the Principality of Galicia–Volhynia (in modern Ukraine).

== Textual witnesses ==
The original chronicle completed in the late 13th century did not survive. The oldest known copy is part of the early 15th-century &quot;Hypatian Codex&quot;, discovered in the Hypatian Monastery of Kostroma by the Russian historian and essayist Nikolay Karamzin. He also found the second codex of the Galician–Volhynian Chronicle, the 16th-century &quot;Khlebnikov Codex&quot; (which is considered the principal one).

In 1973, five copies were known: Hypatian (Ipatiev), Khlebnikov (X), Pogodin (P), Cracow (C), and Ermolaev (E). As of 2022, seven codices/manuscripts that have been preserved are known to contain a paper copy of the &quot;Galician–Volhynian Chronicle&quot;.
* &quot;Hypatian Codex&quot; ( 1425) – contains a faulty chronology inserted by a later copyist
* &quot;Khlebnikov Codex&quot; ( 1575) / Ostroz&#x27;kyj – contains no chronology
* Pogodin/Chetvertyns&#x27;kyj text – contains no chronology
* Cracow text (late 18th century in Latin script) – poorly copied from the Pogodin text
* Bundur/Iarocki text
* Ermolaev (Yermolayev) text – similar to Khlebnikov, but greatly abbreviated and distorted

According to Raffensperger &amp; Ostrowski (2023), there were only four copies of the GVC; only the &quot;Hypatian&quot; and &quot;Khlebnikov&quot; were independent of each other, while the other two derived from &quot;Khlebnikov&quot;.

== Contents ==

The &quot;Galician–Volhynian Chronicle&quot; has two parts:
* The Galician section (1201–1260)
* The Volynian section (1261–1292)

The compiler of the &quot;Galician–Volhynian Chronicle&quot; explained Galicia&#x27;s claim to the Principality of Kiev. The first part of the chronicle (Daniel of Galicia chronicle) was written in Kholm, possibly by a boyar named Dionisiy Pavlovich. Several scholars think that the entire GVC could have been written by eleven unique authors, after which it was compiled together into a single text.

There is some disagreement between scholars where the &quot;Kievan Chronicle&quot; ends and the &quot;Galician–Volhynian Chronicle&quot; begins, as the texts themselves provide no such indication. Ultimately, the boundary between the two is somewhat arbitrary.

== Studies and translations ==
While the 1843, 1908 and 1962 editions of the GVC published in the &quot;Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles&quot; (PSRL) and the 1871 Archaeographical Commission edition were still primarily based on the &quot;Hypatian&quot; text and only included &quot;Khlebnikov&quot; for variant readings, A. Klevanov&#x27;s 1871 Russian paraphrase was the first work – albeit a very flawed one – to take the &quot;Khlebnikov&quot; text as the foundation for reconstructing the GVC. The first linguistic studies of the entire &quot;Hypatian Codex&quot; were published by Makarushka (1896) and Nikolskij (1899). Compared to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Kievan Chronicle&quot;, relatively little attention was given to the &quot;Galician–Volhynian Chronicle&quot; until the 1890s, when Ukrainian historian Mykhailo Hrushevsky stimulated historical and literary interest in it. Hrushevsky established the first reliable chronology of events in the GVC. He demonstrated that the faulty chronology found in the &quot;Hypatian&quot; GVC text was inserted by a later copyist. Although it was clear that the original author had intended to write his text in imitation of the events-based – rather than years-based (annalistic) – Greek chronographs, he never got around to dating the events he had been writing about, and so a later copyist inserted dates, albeit incorrectly. In addition, Hrushevsky translated certain passages from it with historical and literary commentary.

Panov published a modern Russian translation of the &quot;Galician–Volhynian Chronicle&quot; in 1936, which according to Daniel Clarke Waugh (1974) contained &quot;occasional blunders&quot;. Waugh suggested that Teofil Kostrub&#x27;s modern Ukrainian translation, also released in 1936, was &quot;more faithful to the original&quot; than the English one produced by Perfecky in 1973.

The first English translation of the &quot;Galician–Volhynian Chronicle&quot; was published with an index and annotations by La Salle professor George A. Perfecky in 1973. It was part of a large-scale project to produce critical editions of the entire &quot;Hypatian Codex&quot; in modern English under the guidance of professor Omeljan Pritsak (who founded the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute that same year). Perfecky sought to establish a &quot;free (but faithful) rather than a literal interpretation of the chronicle.&quot; Pritsak cautioned the reader &quot;that these are pioneer steps toward a comprehensive study of this work&quot;, and that a revised edition would be prepared &quot;upon the completion of the whole project, which is estimated to take at least ten years&quot;. Waugh reviewed this edition, pointing out some flaws in translation, saying it &quot;will need revision&quot;, and suggesting &quot;that its publication was a bit premature.&quot;

In 2006, Bulgarian historical linguist Daniela S. Hristova (1962–2010) demonstrated that there was a clear linguistic and stylistic boundary in the middle of column 848, between the end of the entry for the year 1260 (6768) and the year 1261 (6769). She concluded that this was where the Galician part ended, and the Volhynian part began. She and Petro Tolochko (2003) also supported the hypothesis of (1993) that the Galician part consisted of six different narratives by separate authors, and that the Volhynian part compiled five different narratives into one, so that the whole GVC was probably written by eleven different people.

<text>Jack Frasure Hyles (September 25, 1926 – February 6, 2001) was a leading figure in the Independent Baptist movement, having pastored the First Baptist Church of Hammond in Hammond, Indiana, from August 1959 until his death. He was well known for being an innovator of the church bus ministry that brought thousands of people each week from surrounding towns to Hammond for services. Hyles built First Baptist up from fewer than a thousand members to a membership of 100,000. In 1993 and again in 1994, it was reported that 20,000 people attended First Baptist every Sunday, making it the most attended Baptist church in the United States. In 2001, at the time of Hyles&#x27;s death, 20,000 people were attending church services and Sunday school each week.

==Biography==

===Early life and beginnings of ministry===
Hyles was born and raised in Italy, Texas, a small, low-income city in Ellis County, south of Dallas. Hyles often described his less-than-ideal upbringing which, he said, included a distant father. At the age of eighteen, Hyles enlisted in the United States Army and served as a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division during World War II. He and his wife, Beverly, were married during the war.

After the war was over, Hyles completed his college education at East Texas Baptist University (then College) in Marshall, the seat of Harrison County. After his graduation from East Texas, Hyles started preaching at several small Texas churches, whose memberships began to grow. These churches included: Marris Chapel Baptist Church, Bogata, Texas; Grange Hall Baptist Church, Marshall, Texas; and Southside Baptist Church, Henderson, Texas. After receiving his education Hyles pastored at the Miller Road Baptist Church in Garland in Dallas County for about six years. During this time the congregation grew from 44 to 4,000 members. It was during those days that Hyles left the Southern Baptist Convention and became an independent Baptist. Hyles then led Miller Road Baptist Church as an independent preacher for a while.

===The move to Hammond, Indiana===
In 1959, Hyles moved to the church-provided parsonage at 8232 Greenwood Avenue, Munster, Indiana, and became the pastor of First Baptist Church of Hammond. When he arrived, the church had a membership of about seven hundred, many from affluent backgrounds. About a third of the members left the church after hearing Hyles&#x27; preaching style, which was very different from that to which they had been accustomed. Hyles then led the church to its status as an independent Baptist church—freeing it from its ties with the American Baptists. Hyles started his bus ministry and soon shepherded the church from a congregation of several hundred to more than 20,000. In the early 1990s a national survey ranked First Baptist as the largest church in the nation, by average weekly attendance figures.

Beginning in 1969, and continuing for several years, First Baptist received recognition for the size of its Sunday School. In 1969, Elmer Towns wrote a book called &quot;The Ten Largest Sunday Schools and What Makes Them Grow&quot; which analyzed First Baptist&#x27;s Sunday School. Towns presented a plaque to Hyles in 1971, naming First Baptist Church of Hammond the nation&#x27;s largest Sunday school. In 1972, and for several years following, &quot;Christian Life Magazine&quot; proclaimed First Baptist Church of Hammond to have &quot;the world&#x27;s largest Sunday School&quot;.

In 1972, Jack Hyles and Russell Anderson founded Hyles–Anderson College, an unaccredited Bible college, to specialize in training Baptist ministers and Christian school teachers. Hyles–Anderson College never sought accreditation because Hyles insisted school accreditation would undermine his ability to control how the college ought to run.

===Ministry===
One of the most notable aspects of Hyles&#x27; work is his church bus ministry that he helped innovate. As early as 1975, &quot;Time&quot; magazine described the phenomenon in an article titled, &quot;Superchurch.&quot; The &quot;Time&quot; article notes that First Baptist Church of Hammond Sunday School, which regularly ran almost 14,000 people, pushed the church to a record attendance of 30,560 on March 16, 1975, thanks to a boisterous contest between two bus route teams. In that year, the First Baptist bus route ministry consisted of 1,000 workers using 230 buses to ferry as many as 10,000 people every Sunday. In 2001, a fleet of over 200 buses was regularly ferrying 7,000 to 15,000 people from all over the area.

Hyles spoke at &quot;The Sword of the Lord&quot; conferences with John R. Rice and his own annual &quot;Pastor&#x27;s School&quot;. The school continues to attract as many as seven thousand annual visitors to the Hammond area.

Hyles wrote approximately fifty works in his lifetime with over 14 million total copies in circulation, including the popular &quot;Is There A Hell?&quot;, based on a sermon he preached at a National Sword of the Lord Conference. Another work, &quot;Enemies of Soul Winning&quot; tackled many issues considered controversial in fundamentalist and evangelical circles, which include the doctrine of repentance, Lordship salvation, and the role of the church in soul winning. The &quot;Calvary Contender&quot; wrote, &quot;Hyles will be remembered as a one-of-a-kind, ever controversial leader whose ministry touched the lives of multitudes.&quot;

Hyles was better known as &quot;Brother Hyles&quot; to his tens of thousands of congregants.

Hyles often held nationwide speaking engagements. In 1984, for instance, he addressed a large gathering in the small city of Snyder, Texas, the seat of Scurry County, hosted by pastor Luther Wallace &quot;Buck&quot; Hatfield (1929–1995) of Faith Baptist Church. Independent Baptists from throughout the area, such as Ross J. Spencer from Bethany Baptist Church in Lubbock, organized bus trips to the convention hall in Snyder. Hatfield and Spencer also adapted the bus ministry approach for their congregations.

In his book, &quot;Enemies of Soulwinning&quot;, Hyles taught that one could not be born again unless the King James Version was used somewhere along the line in that person&#x27;s life. He did not teach Landmarkism/Baptist successionism (the belief that the Baptist church is the original church), but did teach that the church started in AD 31 when Christ was still alive (and not at Pentecost), and that the Catholic Church was started by the Emperor Constantine in AD 313.

===Death===
On January 30, 2001, Hyles suffered a heart attack; this was followed by a second on February 5, at the outset of more than eight hours of surgery at the University of Chicago Hospital, where Hyles underwent four heart bypasses and two heart valve replacements.

Hyles died on February 6, 2001; a funeral was held at First Baptist Church of Hammond on February 10. Hyles was survived by his wife Beverly, their four children, 11 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

==Legacy==
=== Honors, award, and praise ===
Hyles attracted praise, an honorary doctorate, and other accolades throughout the course of his life; he also was the subject of frequent criticism. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; compared the &quot;meek&quot; preaching style of Jerry Falwell to the &quot;spit and fire&quot; of Hyles. The Post suggested that after hearing a preacher like Hyles, &quot;you knew that you&#x27;d been preached to&quot;. Falwell said that &quot;Hyles will be remembered as a leader in evangelism through the local church.&quot; Falwell also said, &quot;He inspired me as a young pastor to win others to Christ through Sunday school, the pulpit, and personal witnessing. He made a great contribution to the cause of Christ&quot;.

Hyles received an honorary doctorate from Midwestern Baptist College, an unaccredited Bible college in Pontiac, Michigan.

The &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; wrote about Hyles on the occasion of his death, &quot;When he chose the interests of poor, inner-city kids over millionaire church members, they said he&#x27;d never keep the doors of his church open.&quot; However, Hyles &quot;proved them all wrong. In the process he built one of the largest congregations in the country, a college, six schools, and a vibrant ministry that will now have to survive without him.&quot;

Matthew Barnett, while discussing his work at an inner-city Los Angeles ministry, explained how he learned from Hyles. Barnett described Hyles as a tremendous soulwinner and a great influence throughout the Chicago area.

Hyles is honored in Founder&#x27;s Park at his college, where life-sized statues of Hyles and his widow have been erected.

== Controversies ==
Accusations of improper sexual behavior and financial and emotional abuse are elements of Hyles&#x27; legacy. In 1989, the paper &quot;The Biblical Evangelist&quot; published a story &quot;The Saddest Story We Ever Published&quot;, accusing Hyles of sexual scandals, financial misappropriation and doctrinal errors. These charges were denied by Hyles who deemed them &quot;lies&quot;. He was accused of a decade long affair with his secretary, Jennie Nischik, who happened to be the wife of a church deacon, Victor Nischik.

In 1991, a First Baptist Church of Hammond deacon named A.V. Ballenger molested a 7-year-old girl in her Hammond Sunday school class. During a Sunday school class &quot;a church worker reportedly witnessed the act and removed the girl from the room, police said.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in a 1991 article reported that Hyles was sued for $1 million by the parents of the girl. The paper reported the &quot;lawsuit claims Hyles and the church had not fulfilled their obligation to ensure that children were protected from harm during Sunday school.&quot; Furthermore, the lawsuit &quot;claims the minister told the child&#x27;s parents that Ballenger &#x27;just loved children,&#x27; and, &#x27;You don&#x27;t have a case.&#x27;&quot; The church settled the lawsuit out of court and the terms were not disclosed. At the criminal trial, three young women testified deacon Ballenger &quot;had fondled them years ago.&quot; One of those girls testified that she was molested on the Hammond church bus. A former security officer at the church testified he saw Ballenger fondle a young girl in 1978 or 1979 in a Sunday school room after being called to the room by a female teacher. In 1993, Ballenger was sentenced to five years in prison.

In 1993 WJBK aired &quot;Preying from the Pulpit&quot;, a news series. The theme of the series was that &quot;allegations of child molesting, abuse and sex scandals in several churches across the nation appear to be part of a pattern of such scandals among churches affiliated with the First Baptist Church of Hammond.&quot; It examined fresh claims of sex abuse in five different fundamentalist churches where church workers who molested children were traced back to Hyles–Anderson College. Besides the abuse, the program examined Hyles&#x27; teaching, including a 1990 sermon where &quot;Hyles pretended to pour poison into a glass and asked an associate pastor, Johnny Colsten, to drink from it. Colsten said he would.&quot; The report &quot;said the sermon has the &#x27;ring of Jonestown&#x27; to it—the mass suicide in Guyana in 1978 by followers of cult leader Jim Jones.&quot; Hyles called the program &quot;poor journalism&quot; and organized a national campaign to respond. &quot;The Times of Northwest Indiana&quot; also condemned WJBK&#x27;s series, calling it &quot;highly irresponsible&quot; and &quot;a monstrous overreach&quot;.

In October 1997, attorney Vernon Petria filed a lawsuit against First Baptist Church of Hammond, accusing the church and its pastor of allowing a woman with an intellectual disability to be sexually assaulted for six years. The civil suit filed in Lake Superior Court in Gary claims the woman was &quot;induced by agents&quot; of the church in 1991 to ride a bus to attend Sunday school at First Baptist and when she was in the care of the church she was sexually assaulted, molested, battered and raped more than once until 1996. Hyles was sued because he and his church &quot;failed in their duty to protect her,&quot; Petri said. The lawsuit alleged this was a pattern of assault that can be traced to a Sunday in 1991, when a First Baptist teacher saw someone abusing the woman and reported it to church leaders and police, but the parents were never told and she kept going to church, where she was threatened into silence. The sexual abuse ended when the woman &quot;developed a horrible infection and was taken to a doctor to find out what was wrong,&quot; Petri said. &quot;When the doctor couldn&#x27;t understand where the infection was coming from, she was admitted to a hospital where they found, embedded in her, a plastic object.&quot; The woman then told what happened, Petri said, recalling that a church program instructor led her to a room and served as a lookout while two to three males raped her.

In response, Hyles said he would have been the first one to want someone punished for such an act and the church told police about the teacher&#x27;s report in 1991. He went on to claim &quot;our records show no attendance since 1991&quot; and this &quot;is a total shock to me.&quot; The woman and the church eventually settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount.

==Family==
Jack and Beverly Hyles had four children: Dave, Cindy, Linda, and Becky.

After Hyles&#x27; death in 2001, Beverly Hyles moved to Texas and served as a Sunday School teacher in the Missions Minded Department Senior Women&#x27;s Class at the Southern Baptist-affiliated First Baptist Church of Dallas under Pastor Robert Jeffress. Beverly Hyles died at the age of 88 on August 30, 2017.

David Hyles served as the youth pastor at First Baptist in Hammond under the leadership of his father. Sources say that upon learning of his son&#x27;s affairs with multiple women, Hyles recommended David as pastor of his former church in Texas; by so doing, David was able to stay out of the public eye. David had multiple affairs with other women while pastoring the church in Texas, before moving to a different state, divorcing his wife, and leaving the ministry. For a time, he worked as an insurance agent in the Jacksonville, Florida, and has been accused of having multiple affairs spanning many years.

Hyles&#x27; daughter, Cindy Hyles, married Jack Schaap, who succeeded Hyles after his death as the senior pastor of First Baptist Church of Hammond. Schaap was embroiled in a major controversy, where he admitted having sexual intercourse with an underage girl and transporting her to do so, across state lines. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison and registered as a sex offender, after which Cindy divorced Jack.

Hyles&#x27; other daughter, Linda Hyles Murphrey, is a motivational speaker who presented her story titled &quot;From Cult to Courage&quot; at a TEDx event, discussing her hardships as a child of Jack Hyles. She has spoken out against the church Hyles led during his tenure and after his death.

<text>BuzzTracker is a news aggregator and blog tracking website that was acquired by Yahoo! on September 14, 2007 and merged into Yahoo! News. The website is owned by Participate Media, which was founded and based in Chicago, Illinois before moving to Sunnyvale, California after being acquired by Yahoo!. The website has been in beta since its inception, and it tracks about 110,000 content sources, which includes traditional media and blogs, and takes &quot;the pulse of what’s happening in various topic areas on the Net&quot;. After indexing new content, the website generates news pages for thousands of different topics, and it integrates information from Flickr and YouTube to provide related pictures and videos. In addition to the BuzzTracker website, the BuzzTracker software is used as a white-label software on other websites including TVWeek.com.

When Yahoo! acquired the company, BuzzTracker&#x27;s founder Alan Warms joined Yahoo! as the general manager and vice president of Yahoo! News. Yahoo! commented on BuzzTracker after the acquisition, saying, &quot;Alan and the folks at BuzzTracker have come up with a way to spotlight the hottest information and give users a tool that makes the information easily digestible.&quot; No price was disclosed for the acquisition, but it is believed to be in the single-digit millions, around US$5 million. After the acquisition, Forbes commented on Yahoo!&#x27;s rivalry with competing companies Google and Digg, saying, &quot;This will also move [Yahoo!] into Google News and Digg territory, while Google is trying to move into the human-editorial side with the AP/AFP/PA deal announced last month.&quot; Several months after Yahoo! acquired BuzzTracker, the website has still yet to be integrated into Yahoo! News.

<doc id="1226047" wikidata="Q2573526" url="?curid=1226047" title="Dessert spoon">
<text>A dessert spoon is a spoon designed specifically for eating dessert. Similar in size to a soup spoon (intermediate between a teaspoon and a tablespoon) but with an oval rather than round bowl, it typically has a capacity around twice that of a teaspoon. 

By extension, the term &quot;dessert spoon&quot; is used as a cooking measure of volume, usually of 10 millilitres (mL), US fl oz, or imp fl oz.

==Dining==
The use of dessert spoons around the world varies massively; in some areas they are very common, while in other places the use of the dessert spoon is almost unheard of—with diners using forks or teaspoons for their desserts as a default.

In most traditional table settings, the dessert spoon is placed above the plate or bowl, separated from the rest of the cutlery, or it may simply be brought in with the dessert.

==Culinary measure==
As a unit of culinary measure, in the United States, a level dessert spoon (&quot;dsp., dspn. or dstspn.&quot;) equals 2 US customary teaspoons, which is 2 US customary fluid drams ( of a US customary fluid ounce).

In the United Kingdom, a dessert spoon is traditionally 2 British imperial fluid drachms ( of a British imperial fluid ounce). 1 UK dessert spoon is the equivalence of UK tablespoon, 2 UK teaspoons, or 4 UK salt spoons.

A metric dessert spoon is 10mL, the equivalence of 2 metric teaspoons.

==Apothecary measure==
As a unit of Apothecary measure, the dessert-spoon was an unofficial but widely used unit of fluid measure equal to two fluid drams, or fluid ounce. However, even when approximated, its use was discouraged: &quot;Inasmuch as spoons vary greatly in capacity, and from their form are unfit for use in the dosage of medicine, it is desirable... to be measured with a suitable medicine measure.&quot;

In the United States and pre-1824 England, the fluid ounce was of a Queen Anne wine gallon (which was defined as exactly 231 cubic inches) thus making the dessert-spoon approximately . The post-1824 (British) imperial Apothecaries&#x27; dessert-spoon was also fluid ounce, but the ounce in question was of an imperial gallon, approximately 277.4 cubic inches, yielding a dessert-spoon of approximately .

In both the British and American variants of the Apothecaries&#x27; system, two tea-spoons make a dessert-spoon, while two dessert-spoons make a table-spoon. In pharmaceutical Latin, the Apothecaries&#x27; dessert-spoon is known as , abbreviated as or less frequently , as opposed to the tea-spoon ( or ) and table-spoon ( or ).

<text>The Remington M1867 is a rolling-block rifle that was produced in the second-half of the 19th century. It was the first rifle using metallic cartridges to be adopted by the Norwegian and Swedish armies. Nominally, it had a caliber of 4 decimal lines, but the actual caliber was 3.88 Norwegian decimal lines or 4.1 Swedish decimal lines (12.17 mm), and it fired a rimfire round with a 12.615 mm (.497 in) lead bullet. The 12.17 mm caliber was chosen because the Swedish army had approximately 30,000 new muzzle-loading M1860 and breech-loading M1864 rifles in 12.17 mm caliber in stock, rifles that were suitable for conversion to M1867 rolling-block rifles. With the exception of the first 10,000 rifles and 20,000 actions (for conversions of older rifles), which were made by Remington in the US, all Remington M1867 rifles and carbines were made under license in Norway and Sweden, by Kongsberg Vaapenfabrik in Norway, and by Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag and Carl Gustafs stads Gevärsfaktori in Sweden with the two Swedish manufacturers producing about 80% of the weapons.

==Birth of the M1867==

In the 1860s the Norwegian and Swedish armies realized that their standard rifles, both percussion lock breech-loading rifles and muzzle loaders, were rapidly becoming obsolete in the face of the new metal cartridge combining bullet, primer and propellant load. In early October 1866, a joint Swedish-Norwegian arms commission was established in order to select a suitable cartridge and rifle for the two nations.

Several different cartridges and rifles were considered by the commission. A partial list includes:
*Needle-guns
:*A &quot;Prussian needle gun&quot; designed in 1866.
:*&quot;Larsen&quot; and &quot;Steenstrup&quot; - two different modifications of the standard issue army rifle at the time.
:*A &quot;modified Swedish standard army rifle&quot;.
*Non-repeating rifles for metallic cartridges:
:*&quot;Peabody&quot; - American lever-action
:*&quot;Remington&quot; - American, rolling-block
:*&quot;Larsen&quot; - two related, but different Norwegian designs. One lever-action, one bolt action
*Repeating rifles for metallic cartridges:
:*&quot;Spencer&quot; - American design, removable magazine in the buttstock
:*&quot;Henry&quot; - American design, tubular magazine under the barrel
:*&quot;Larsen&quot; - Norwegian modification of the Henry
*Repeating rifles for paper cartridges:
:*&quot;Palmcrantz&quot; - Swedish design (See Helge Palmcrantz)
*Percussion rifles:
:*&quot;Burnside&quot; - American design with metallic cartridge
:*&quot;Sharps&quot; - American design using paper cartridges

After various tests, including repeated firings, it was clear that the needle guns were not particularly well-suited. These - along with the repeating rifles - were dropped from further testing. Further testing - which included test firing by previously untrained troops - showed that both the Peabody and the Remington was suitable for issuing to the field army. In the end, the commission based their decision on price and complexity. The Remington totalled a mere 25 parts to the Peabody&#x27;s 37, and it was approved for use by both the Norwegian and the Swedish armed forces, as their standard military rifle, on 22 November 1867.

==The M1867 in Norway==

A grand total of 58,450 Remington M1867 were delivered to the Norwegian Armed Forces from 1867 until 1883, when production was curtailed to make room for the Jarmann M1884. All production rifles were meant to be manufactured at Kongsberg Våpenfabrik in Norway, but since the factory needed to be upgraded with more modern machinery, 5000 of the first rifles delivered to the Norwegian Army were manufactured by Husqvarna Vapenfabrik in Sweden in 1871-72. The difference is minor, the Norwegian rifles have brass buttplates and head of the cleaning rod, and steel mounting bands, while Swedish rifles have iron furniture. For the first few years the barrels of the M1867 were made of iron, but after 1871, steel became the standardized material. The price for each barrel was slightly higher, but the better design reduced misfire damage and ultimately resulted in cost effectiveness. Additionally, the designers improved the lock by replacing two lockscrews with a lockplate.

From the early 1870s the Norwegian armed forces used the 12.17×44mm RF, which apart from the case length and overall length of the cartridge was identical to the original Norwegian-Swedish 12.17×42mm RF. In spite of the difference in length the two cartridges were interchangeable and could be chambered and fired in both Norwegian and Swedish rifles. The official military designation for the cartridge was &#x27;12mm Remington&#x27; from 1879.

The sight of the rifle was the last item to be standardized because no one could agree on which would be best. The early production rifles had an L-shaped sight that could be flipped over, but the final design was a unique combination of other ideas. Earlier models were supposed to be changed to this final design, but it is still possible to find M1867 with the original sights intact.

Each rifle was delivered with a sling, a long bayonet, a three-pronged screwdriver, an oil bottle, a cleaning rod, and a muzzle plug to stop moisture from getting into the barrel. Early muzzle plugs were a short, conical dowel made of wood, but soon a brass cup with a cut out for the front sight replaced it in service.

In 1880 Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk delivered 72 conversion kits for the rifles which allowed less expensive 22LR ammunition to be fired from the M1867 for training. These kits consisted simply of tubes to be inserted into the rifle from the breech, containing a chamber for the 22LR and a short barrel. The intention was to allow for cheaper training. Later, in 1884, several M1867 were permanently modified to fire 22LR with an improved model of this device.

After the Jarmann M1884 replaced the M1867 as the main rifle in the first lines of the Norwegian Army, the M1867 was delegated to rear units until at least the mid-1890s. Roughly 5,000 were modified in 1888 and 1891 into carbines, firing 8 mm rimmed centerfire ammunition. These remained in use until 1908, when they were finally replaced by Krag–Jørgensen carbines.

From 1900 onwards, the Norwegian Army sold the obsolete M1867 to the public for a nominal price. Many of these were converted into hunting rifles and shotguns, so that it has become difficult to find an M1867 in its original form.

The 8 mm carbine conversions were kept in reserve until World War II, when most of the estimated 4,900 units were destroyed by German forces.

Today, an unmodified M1867 in decent shape might be worth 4,000 - 6,000 Norwegian kroner (roughly 600 - 900 USD), while an M1867 in perfect condition might go for as much as 10,000 kroner (roughly 1,500 USD). However, as mentioned most of the M1867 were modified after they were sold to civilians, and most collectors seem to agree that the modified arms are worth a lot less.

==The M1867 in Sweden==
About 200,000-220,000 military rifles and 7,000 military carbines using the m/1867 action were manufactured as complete weapons in Sweden, 100,000-120,000 rifles and 4,000 carbines by Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori (a government owned arsenal) and 100,000 rifles and 3,000 carbines by Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag. In addition to that 10,000 complete rifles and 20,000 actions made in the US were bought from Remington. The standard rifle received the Swedish designation &quot;gevär m/1867&quot; (and a version with only minor differences the designation &quot;gevär m/1867-68&quot;). Approximately 30,000 Swedish muzzle-loading rifles m/1860 and breech-loading rifles m/1864 (some of which had been converted from m/1860, note that the Swedish breech-loading rifle m/1864 although being referred to as a &quot;kammarladdare&quot; was not the same rifle as the Norwegian Kammerlader) of the same caliber, rifles that were almost new and in most cases had never been used, were also converted to M1867s using rolling-block actions made both by Remington and in Sweden. The Swedish designations for the converted rifles were &quot;gevär m/1860-68&quot;, &quot;gevär m/1864-68&quot; and &quot;gevär m/1860-64-68&quot; depending on how many steps of conversion they had gone through (the two latter conversions are easily recognized by having the rear sight very far back, a result of the barrels being shortened from the breech end). About 7,000 short carbines with the Swedish designation &quot;karbin m/1870&quot; were also made, and in addition to that about 9,600 &quot;gevär m/1864-68&quot; were shortened to carbine length in 1886-87 and given the designation &quot;karbin m/1864-68-85&quot;. Other varieties were &quot;gevär m/1867-74&quot; with a new rear stock design and &quot;kammarskjutningsgevär m/1884&quot; and &quot;kammarskjutningskarbin m/1884&quot; in 10.15x61R Jarmann (rifles and carbines primarily used for gallery shooting, that is short range training).

Both M1867&#x27;s for civilian use and M1867&#x27;s used by the Swedish Frivilliga Skarpskytterörelsen (&quot;The Volunteer Sharpshooter Movement&quot;, patterned on the British Volunteer Force and numbering 40,000 men in 1865, all of them provided with military rifles and wearing military style uniforms by the Swedish armed forces) were made for, or converted to, centerfire 12.17×44mmR cartridges since, unlike the 12.17×42mm rimfire cartridges used in the military, the centerfire cartridges could be reloaded. One model of Swedish military M1867 rifles modified to use the 12.17×44mmR centerfire cartridge was the &quot;gevär m/1867-74&quot;.

A new Norwegian-Swedish arms commission set up in the 1880s suggested that the Norwegian M1884 Jarmann rifle should replace the m/1867 in both Norwegian and Swedish service but the Jarmann rifle was rejected by the Swedish Army since the 10.15x61mmR cartridge used by the Jarmann rifle was seen as being too little of an improvement over the 12.17 mm cartridge used in the M1867 rifles. So as a stop-gap measure rifles and carbines with rolling-block action were converted to a for that time period very modern centerfire cartridge, the 8×58mmR Danish Krag (bullet diameter .322 in/8.17mm, bullet weight 237 grains/15.29 grams, muzzle velocity 1,965 ft per second/600 m/s), with the designation &quot;gevär m/1867-89&quot; used for converted rifles and &quot;gevär m/1889&quot; used for new rifles. rolling-block rifles chambered for the 8×58mmR were shorter than the M1867 rifles, with an overall length of 1,240 mm (48.8 in) and a barrel length of 840 mm (33.1 in).

During the last years of the 19th century the M1867 in all its different guises was finally replaced in Swedish military service by Mauser bolt action repeating rifles and carbines (with a modified Mauser 1893 action), under the designations &quot;karbin m/1894&quot; and &quot;gevär m/1896&quot;, in caliber 6.5×55mm.

The M1867 rifle became very popular among civilian hunters in Sweden, particularly for moose hunting, which led to Husqvarna Vapenfabrik producing about 85,000 rifles with the M1867 rolling-block action for the civilian market, in addition to the more than 100,000 they made for the armed forces. Surplus military rifles were also sold to civilians, most them being converted to 12.17×44mmR centerfire cartridges.

<doc id="1226063" wikidata="Q7837705" url="?curid=1226063" title="Treenail">
<text>A treenail, also trenail, trennel, or trunnel, is a wooden peg, pin, or dowel used to fasten pieces of wood together, especially in timber frames, covered bridges, wooden shipbuilding and boat building. It is driven into a hole bored through two (or more) pieces of structural wood (mortise and tenon).

==History and general use==

The use of wood as a tenon can be traced back over 7,000 years, as archaeologist have found traces of wood nails in the excavation of early Germanic sites. Treenails are extremely economical and readily available, making them a common early building material. Black locust is a favorite wood when making treenails in shipbuilding in North America and English oak in Europe due to their strength and rot resistance, while red oak is typical in buildings.

Traditionally treenails and pegs were made by splitting bolts of wood with a froe and shaping them with a drawknife on a shaving horse. They can also be made with a tine-former, a hollow metal tube with a flaring flange on one end and a sharp edge on the other, usually mounted by the flange atop a low bench called a driving stool. Each roughly-shaped bolt of wood is placed above the sharp end of the pipe and hit with a wooden mallet, but not hard enough that the mallet hits the sharp edge of the pipe; the next billet drives the preceding one the rest of the way through, and it falls through a hole in the bench into a bucket.

Treenails are cut from a single piece of wood and perform well because of the natural grain. The grain of the treenail runs perpendicular to the grain of the receiving mortises which adds structural strength. Treenails are typically in diameter and are hand whittled with rough facets. The mortise is drilled smaller than the treenail to create a tight fit and take advantage of friction in the mortise. In cases where the treenail is or longer, the treenail should be shaped smaller than the other half. In the same case the mortise is drilled in two parts, with a smaller auger for the smaller part of the treenail and a typical auger for the standard part. Other treenails are tapered with the large end being longer than the mortise. After treenails are hammered into the mortise, they can be trimmed, split, and wedged with a small piece of oak that increases friction force. As an alternative to the wedge, the treenail can receive a plug or a punch to the center that expands the entire circumference. While this method prevents leaks by reducing gaps, plugs and punches are more likely to fall out in cold temperatures. Ideally, the nose of the treenail is driven 4–5 cm clear of the timber before being trimmed.

Unlike metal nails, treenails can not be removed (without great effort) or reused. As the wood shrinks or expand the fibers create a friction that interlocks it into the mortise snugly. If a treenail breaks or fails but the wood it is fastening remains intact the remaining treenail can be cut out and replaced with a larger treenail that fits snugly. In addition, treenails have the ability to move over time and retain structural integrity.

== Uses in building structures ==

Early mortise and tenon trusses with spans of less than used treenail fasteners. When used in a truss, the connecting mortises are drilled off center such that when the treenail is inserted it creates a tighter joint. Because of the large number of treenails required in a truss, the treenails can be turned on a lathe with a head and a tapered end, often kept extra-long for the tightest fit. The bottom chord often requires 2–3 pegs and is the weakest part of the truss. Hence the treenail can not prevent failure in spans of over . In cases where significant shrinkage may occur, it may be necessary to use iron U-straps or reinforcements.

== Uses in ships ==

Ancient shipbuilding used treenails to bind the boat together. They had the advantage of not giving rise to &quot;nail-sickness&quot;, a term for decay accelerated and concentrated around metal fasteners. Increased water content causes wood to expand, so that treenails gripped the planks tighter as they absorbed water. However, when the treenail was a different wood species from the planking, it usually caused rot. Treenails and iron nails were most common until the 1780s when copper nails over copper sheathing became more popular. As late as the 1870s, merchant ships used treenails and iron bolts, while higher quality ships used copper and yellow metal bolts and dumps. In the 1870s, treenails were typically used in a ratio of four treenails to one bolt, although sometimes more bolts were used. In later corvettes, the ratio was changed to two treenails to one bolt.

== Uses in railroads ==
Similar wooden treenail fastenings were used as alternatives to metal spikes to secure railroad rail-support &quot;chairs&quot; to wooden sleepers (ties) in early Victorian times. Treenails were extensively used constructing railways in North England.

<text>Roberto Alfredo Fontanarrosa, known popularly as &quot;El Negro&quot; Fontanarrosa (November 26, 1944 in Rosario – July 19, 2007), was an Argentine cartoonist, comics artist and writer. During his extended career, Fontanarrosa became one of the most acclaimed &quot;historieta&quot; artists of his country, as well as a respected fiction and short story writer. He created two hugely popular comic strips, as well as their parodic protagonists: &quot;Inodoro Pereyra&quot;, a gaucho, and &quot;Boogie, el aceitoso&quot;, a gun-for-hire. He also created the comic book &quot;Los Clásicos según Fontanarrosa&quot; (&quot;The Classics According to Fontanarrosa&quot;), which contained a selection of humorous parodies of universal literature mainstays originally published in the magazine &quot;Chaupinela&quot;, in the 1970s.

In 2013 an Argentine animated film directed by Juan José Campanella and loosely based on Fontanarrosa&#x27;s short story &quot;Memorias de un wing derecho&quot; was released to box office success.

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Fontanarrosa was born in Rosario, province of Santa Fe, and he lived and worked there until his death. He was widely known by the affectionate nickname &quot;El Negro&quot;.

===Career===
Fontanarrosa began his career writing and drawing comic strips and later branched out into writing narratives with short stories, especially about football (soccer). His most famous strips are &quot;Inodoro Pereyra&quot;, featuring a gaucho and his talking dog Mendieta, and the hitman &quot;Boogie el Aceitoso&quot;, which came to life as a &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; parody.

Simultaneously with his comic book career, Fontanarrosa went on to write three novels (&quot;Best Seller&quot;, &quot;El área 18&quot; and &quot;La Gansada&quot;) and seven books of short stories (&quot;Los trenes matan a los autos&quot;, &quot;El mundo ha vivido equivocado&quot;, &quot;No sé si he sido claro&quot;, &quot;Nada del otro mundo&quot;, &quot;El mayor de mis defectos&quot;, &quot;Uno nunca sabe&quot; and &quot;La mesa de los galanes&quot;), all of them filled with a combination of subtle and broad humor. There are also a number of book compilations of his newspapers&#x27; strips.

His work has been seen in different Latin American newspapers including Argentine &quot;Clarín&quot;, Colombian &quot;El tiempo&quot;, Uruguayan &quot;La República&quot;, and Mexican magazine &quot;Proceso&quot;. In 1977 he was approached by Les Luthiers (the famous Argentine humour/music group), who wanted him to collaborate on a script they were writing for a film starring the six group members; the film never bore fruit, but he instead became a creative partner, often writing jokes and situations for them, and most of their shows from 1979 onwards feature his input alongside Les Luthiers&#x27;.

He was granted the Platinum Konex Award in 1994, and the Konex Merit Diploma in 1992, 2004 and 2012 (posthumous).

In November 2007, a posthumous work of Fontanarrosa was made public: the animated film &quot;Fierro&quot; was released, for which he had co-written the script and designed all the characters shortly before his death.

===Illness===
In 2003 he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and was reliant on a wheelchair. He continued to work, and participated in the meetings of the Third International Congress of the Spanish Language, in 2004, where he gave a humorous lecture about taboo words and the final speech. On 26 April 2006, the Senate awarded him the Domingo Faustino Sarmiento Mention of Honour for his career and his contribution to Argentine culture.

On January 18, 2007, he announced that he would be no longer drawing his own strips because he had lost full control of his hand, but stated that he would go on writing the scripts for his characters.

===Death===
On 19 July 2007, Fontanarrosa suffered a respiratory failure, and was taken to a hospital. He died there about one hour later. His funeral service and the funeral procession on the next day were attended by thousands of common citizens, writers, actors, and political authorities. The procession stopped beside the Gigante de Arroyito stadium (home of Rosario Central, a team of which Fontanarrosa was possibly its most notable fan) and then continued north to the neighbouring city of Granadero Baigorria, where Fontanarrosa was buried at the &quot;Parque de la Eternidad&quot; cemetery.

The main national news services and printed media of Argentina devoted special segments to Fontanarrosa&#x27;s legacy and to the funeral service. The national government declared a Mourning Day for National Culture, and the municipal government of Rosario ordered flags to be flown at half mast.

<text>Good Morning Australia (or GMA) is an Australian breakfast television program that was broadcast on Network Ten. It aired from 23 February 1981 until 18 December 1992. It was seen as an Australian equivalent of ABC&#x27;s Good Morning America and ITV&#x27;s Good Morning Britain.

==History==
The original &quot;Good Morning Australia&quot; breakfast television program was a news and entertainment show broadcast by Network Ten on weekdays from 7:00 to 9:00am. It debuted on 23 February 1981 with Gordon Elliott and Sue Kellaway co-hosting and with Di Morrissey as the roving reporter. Kellaway departed shortly after the program began and was replaced by Kerri-Anne Kennerley, who stayed with the program until the end of 1991 when she was replaced by Sandra Sully, Joy Smithers and then Sandra Sully again.

The male co-host position on &quot;GMA&quot; was filled by Tim Webster, Mike Gibson, Terry Willesee, Webster again, Mike Hammond and Ron Wilson.

The breakfast program competed with the Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; (which launched in 1982 with Sue Kellaway, initial co-host of the Ten show) and usually placed second in the ratings behind &quot;Today&quot;.

In 1992, &quot;Good Morning Australia&quot; moved to the 6:30 to 8:30am timeslot, coinciding with the launch of &quot;The Morning Show&quot; with Bert Newton. &quot;Good Morning Australia&quot;, as a breakfast news program, was cancelled at the end of 1992. The name was taken over by Bert Newton&#x27;s morning program and became &quot;Good Morning Australia with Bert Newton&quot;, which ran until 2005.

Since the demise of the original &quot;Good Morning Australia&quot;, other breakfast programs have arisen such as &quot;Sunrise&quot; and &quot;ABC News Breakfast&quot;, &quot;Weekend Today&quot;, &quot;Weekend Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Weekend Breakfast&quot;.

==Life and career==

In 1972, she made her big-screen debut in the sex comedy &quot;The Sexpert&quot;. She later starred in the sexploitation thriller &quot;The Centerfold Girls&quot; (1974). She turned down seven-year contract with Universal Pictures in 1973 and chose a three-year contract with the CBS daytime soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. She played the role of Lorie Brooks from 1973 to 1982 with reprises in 1984, 2002, and 2018. In 1982, she had a cameo appearance in the comedy film &quot;Young Doctors in Love&quot;.

<doc id="1226109" wikidata="Q969977" url="?curid=1226109" title="Wayne LaPierre">
<text>Wayne Robert LaPierre Jr. (born November 8, 1949) is an American gun rights lobbyist who was the CEO and executive vice president of the National Rifle Association of America (NRA), a position he held between 1991 and 2024.

LaPierre has faced scrutiny over his career for what were perceived as controversial statements. In 1995, his criticism of federal agents after the Ruby Ridge and Waco incidents led to former President George H. W. Bush resigning his NRA membership. He criticized former President Bill Clinton’s approach to gun control measures and advocated for armed officers to be placed in schools after the Sandy Hook and Stoneman Douglas school shootings. 

LaPierre has advocated for increased funding for mental health programs and stricter punishment for gun related offenses. In addition, he supported restrictions on “bump-fire”-type rifle stocks after the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting.

On January 5, 2024, the NRA posted on X that LaPierre would resign from his position on January 31. The announcement came amid allegations of corruption and ahead of a civil trial in Manhattan.

==Personal background==
Wayne Robert LaPierre, Jr. was born on November 8, 1949, in Schenectady, New York, the eldest child of Hazel (Gordon) and Wayne Robert LaPierre, Sr. His father was an accountant for the local General Electric plant. The LaPierre family trace their patrilineal heritage to a 17th century French ancestor who emigrated from the Brittany region of France to New France (now Quebec, Canada). His family moved to Roanoke, Virginia, when LaPierre, Jr. was five years old, and he was raised in the Roman Catholic church. LaPierre first received a student deferment, then a medical deferment (the cause of which is still publicly unknown) and therefore was not drafted into military service during the Vietnam War.

After divorcing his first wife, LaPierre married Susan Znidorka in 1998.

==Career==
Wayne LaPierre has been a government activist and lobbyist since receiving his master&#x27;s degree in government and politics, including positions on the board of directors of the American Association of Political Consultants, the American Conservative Union, and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.

===National Rifle Association activity===
Since 1991, he served as EVP and chief executive of the NRA, the largest gun rights advocacy and firearms safety training/marksmanship organization in the United States. LaPierre joined the NRA in 1977 after working as a legislative aide to Democratic Virginia delegate and gun rights advocate Vic Thomas. LaPierre announced his forthcoming resignation from the NRA on January 5, 2024, to take effect January 31. In early 2024, Doug Hamelin was elected to replace LaPierre as Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer.

In 2014, NRA contributions totaled $103 million and LaPierre&#x27;s compensation was $985,885. In 2015, NRA contributions totaled $95 million. In that year, LaPierre received a $3.7 million deferred compensation distribution from his &quot;employee funded deferred compensation plan&quot;, which was required by federal law, and according to the NRA raised his total annual compensation to $5,110,985.

===Fraud and financial misconduct lawsuit===
On August 6, 2020, following 18 months of investigation, New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a civil lawsuit against the NRA and LaPierre, as well as treasurer Wilson Phillips, former chief of staff and current executive director of general operations Joshua Powell and general counsel and secretary John Frazer, alleging fraud, financial misconduct, and misuse of charitable funds, and calling for the dissolution of the association due to chronic fraudulent management. The NRA attempted to have the case moved to Texas and the dissolution lawsuit dismissed, but federal Judge Harlin Hale of the Northern District of Texas ruled that the effort was made in bad faith. LaPierre&#x27;s compensation and exorbitant corporate spending on personal items such as expensive suits, home landscaping and mosquito treatment, chartered jet flights, and a traveling &quot;glam squad&quot; for his wife, drew attention in the eleven-day hearing. In March 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Joel Cohen denied the claim to dissolve the NRA, while allowing the lawsuit against LaPierre and the organization to move forward.

On February 23, 2024 a six week-long civil trial concluded with the jury ordering LaPierre to repay the NRA $4,351,231 of the $5.4 million the jury found he had misspent. It also ordered the NRA’s retired finance chief, Wilson Phillips, to repay $2 million, found that the NRA omitted or misrepresented information in its tax filings, and violated New York law by failing to adopt a whistleblower policy.

==Views on gun rights==

LaPierre has called for the presence of &quot;armed, trained, qualified school security personnel&quot; at schools. At a press conference in the wake of the December 14, 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, LaPierre announced that Asa Hutchinson, former Arkansas congressman and DEA chief, would lead the NRA&#x27;s National School Shield Emergency Response Program, saying &quot;The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.&quot;

LaPierre blamed the Sandy Hook incident, and others like it, on &quot;lack of mental health reform and the prevalence of violent video games and movies&quot;.

LaPierre has stated his support for the following:
* Increasing funds for a stricter and more efficient mental health system, and reform of civil commitment laws to facilitate the institutionalization of the mentally ill when necessary.
* Creating a computerized universal mental health registry of those adjudicated to be legally incompetent, to help limit gun sales to the mentally ill.
* Increasing enforcement of federal laws against and incarceration of violent gang members or felons with guns.
* Project Exile and similar programs that mandate severe sentences for all gun crimes, especially illegal possession. LaPierre stated, &quot;By prosecuting them, they prevent the drug dealer, the gang member, and the felon from committing the next crime... Leave the good people alone and lock up the bad people and dramatically cut crime.&quot;
* Restriction on &quot;bump-fire&quot;-type rifle stocks, in the aftermath of the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting.
* Bans on fully automatic firearms.

==Criticism==
In 1995 in the aftermath of the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents, LaPierre wrote a fundraising letter describing federal agents as &quot;jack-booted government thugs&quot; who wear &quot;Nazi bucket helmets and black storm trooper uniforms to attack law-abiding citizens.&quot; The term &quot;jack-booted government thugs&quot; had been coined by United States Representative John David Dingell Jr., Democrat of Michigan, in 1981, referring to ATF agents, and came to be frequently repeated by the NRA. Former president George H. W. Bush was so outraged by the letter that he resigned his NRA life membership. In response to growing criticism, LaPierre apologized, saying he did not intend to &quot;paint all federal law-enforcement officials with the same broad brush&quot;.

In 2000, LaPierre said President Bill Clinton tolerated a certain amount of violence and killing to strengthen the case for gun control and to score points for his party. Clinton White House spokesman Joe Lockhart called it &quot;really sick rhetoric, and it should be repudiated by anyone who hears it&quot;. In 2004, citing Democratic candidate John Kerry&#x27;s history of authoring and supporting gun control legislation, LaPierre actively campaigned against the senator in the 2004 presidential elections.

In response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, he connected gun violence with &quot;gun-free zones&quot;, violent films and video games, the media, weak databases on mental illness and lax security, and called for armed officers at American schools in an effort to protect children from gun violence. Following the event, several in the media criticized LaPierre&#x27;s statements, including the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; editorial board and &quot;The Atlantic&quot;″s Jeffrey Goldberg. Others also criticized the NRA&#x27;s remarks, including Republican Party strategist and pollster Frank Luntz.

In response to the February 14, 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, LaPierre delivered a speech on February 22 at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) held in National Harbor, Maryland, in which he criticized the FBI, the media and gun control advocates. &quot;As usual, the opportunists wasted not one second to exploit tragedy for political gain. The elites do not care one whit about America&#x27;s school system and schoolchildren. If they truly cared, what they would do is they would protect them. For them it is not a safety issue, it is a political issue ... [Gun control advocates] don&#x27;t care if their laws work or not. They just want get more laws to get more control over people. But the NRA, the NRA does care.&quot; David Graham of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; questioned his reference to &quot;elites,&quot; since LaPierre earns millions from his work. LaPierre also argued that the constitutional right to keep and bear arms &quot;is not bestowed by man, but granted by God to all Americans as our American birthright.&quot;

On April 27, 2021, a video emerged of LaPierre shooting an African bush elephant at point-blank range on a 2013 hunting trip in Botswana, &quot;demonstrating that the nation&#x27;s foremost gun advocate could barely shoot.&quot; The video drew criticism from conservation groups.

<text>LeRoy Pope Walker (February 7, 1817 – August 23, 1884) was the first Confederate States Secretary of War.

==Early life and career==
Walker was born near Huntsville, Alabama in 1817, the son of John Williams Walker and Matilda Pope, and a grandson of LeRoy Pope. He was educated by private tutors, then attended universities in Alabama and Virginia. Before reaching the age of 21, he was admitted to the bar. He married Eliza Dickson Pickett on July 29, 1850. He held various offices in Alabama; in 1853, he resigned his position as a circuit court judge in order to focus on his legal practice. He actively promoted secession.

==Civil War==
Largely on the advice of several of Walker&#x27;s supporters, including his brother Richard, President Jefferson Davis appointed him to the post of Secretary of War, though Walker was not personally known to Davis. He was energetic and confident in support of the Confederacy, but had no military training. The stress and difficulties of his cabinet position seriously affected his health. In March 1861, the Southern states that had seceded from the Union appointed special commissioners to travel to those other Southern states that had yet to secede. Walker was chosen as the commissioner from Alabama to the Tennessee Secession Convention, where he publicly read Alabama&#x27;s Articles of Secession and tried to persuade Tennessee politicians to vote to do likewise.

In April 1861, shortly after the Civil War began with the bombardment of Fort Sumter by rebel forces, Walker predicted that Washington, D.C., and Boston would fall to the Confederacy before May 1 of that year. However, this never happened.

Starting in August 1861, Davis encouraged Walker to become a Confederate representative to Europe; Walker did not accept this, but on September 16 he resigned his post. Davis made him a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army, and he commanded the army garrisons in Mobile and Montgomery, Alabama, before resigning in March 1862. He returned to the army in April 1864 to serve as a military judge.

==Post-war==
After the war, Walker returned to his legal practice and continued to be interested in politics. He died in 1884 and was buried in Maple Hill Cemetery in Huntsville.

<doc id="1226134" wikidata="Q1686205" url="?curid=1226134" title="LeRoy Pope">
<text>LeRoy Pope (January 30, 1765 – June 17, 1844) was an American planter, lawyer, and early settler of Madison County, Alabama. He purchased much of the land on which downtown Huntsville, Alabama, now stands, and for his role in the establishment and early growth of that city, has been called the &quot;Father of Huntsville.&quot;

==Early life==
Pope was born on January 30, 1765, in Northumberland County, Virginia, the son of LeRoy Pope, Sr. and Elizabeth Mitchell. He was educated in his home state, and moved with his parents to Amherst County, Virginia. He is said to have served in the American Revolution, and was present at the siege and battle of Yorktown, but no official documentation of this service exists.

==Moving South==
In 1790, Pope and a host of friends and relatives removed to the town of Petersburg, in Elbert County, Georgia, where he was a tobacco planter. In 1809, was among the first wave of wealthy settlers to Madison County, Mississippi Territory (now Alabama). He acquired a large tract of land which included the highly sought-after Big Spring, where pioneer John Hunt had settled in 1805. Hunt, like many other squatters, could not afford to purchase his land.

Pope was successful in petitioning the territorial legislature to select his land as the site of Madison County&#x27;s seat of government. He named the new town Twickenham after the home in England of his distant relative Alexander Pope. In 1811, the town was renamed Huntsville in honor of the pioneer Hunt.

LeRoy Pope&#x27;s mansion, called Poplar Grove, was erected in 1814, in time to entertain General Andrew Jackson on his return home from the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. It was one of the earliest brick structures in Alabama, and remains a prominent Huntsville landmark atop Echols Hill in the Twickenham Historic District. It was restored in the early 21st century.

==Public life and civic leadership==
Pope was a wealthy and successful planter, and was active in the early government and civic leadership of Huntsville and Madison County. He presided as chief justice of the first county court, and was among the founders of the first Episcopal church in Huntsville, organized in 1830. He was named by the legislature as a commissioner for the Planters&#x27; and Merchants&#x27; Bank of Huntsville, Alabama&#x27;s first banking corporation, and for the Indian River Navigation Company.

He was married to Judith Sale, daughter of Cornelius Sale and Jane Dawson of Amherst County, Virginia. His daughter Matilda Pope married John Williams Walker, who became Alabama&#x27;s first senator, and was the mother of LeRoy Pope Walker, Confederate secretary of war and brigadier general; Richard Wilde Walker, Confederate States senator; Percy Walker, United States representative; and several other children. Another daughter, Maria Pope, married Thomas George Percy, Sr., and was the ancestor of such notables as Senator LeRoy Percy of Mississippi, the poet William Alexander Percy, Senator Charles H. Percy of Illinois, and the author Walker Percy.

Pope died in Huntsville on June 17, 1844, and is buried in Maple Hill Cemetery.

<text>Kjetil André Rekdal (born 6 November 1968) is a Norwegian football manager and a former player. He is the manager of Norwegian club Aalesund.

Rekdal began his playing career in Molde FK, playing afterwards for clubs in the Bundesliga, Ligue 1 and Belgian Pro League. Playing as a midfielder during his time as a player, his 83 caps with the Norway national team makes him the seventh most capped player in the team&#x27;s history.

Rekdal previously managed Vålerenga from 2000 to 2006, during which he won both the cup and league title. He has also been in charge of 1. FC Kaiserslautern, Lierse and Aalesund. During his time at Aalesund, the club earned two cup titles and saw a period of success previously unmatched in their history, which was attributed to Rekdal.

==Club career==
Born in Vestnes, Rekdal started playing football for the local club Fiksdal/Rekdal in 1979. Later as a 16-year-old he started his professional career with the local top flight club Molde FK, becoming the second-youngest player in the league. In 1988, he signed with the Bundesliga club Borussia Mönchengladbach and stayed with them for two years before moving to the Belgian Pro League side Lierse S.K. and remaining there until 1996, with the exception of the 1994 season which he spent on loan helping his former club Molde FK gaining promotion to Tippeligaen and winning the domestic Cup.

In 1996, he signed for Ligue 1 club Rennes. The highlight of his playing career was a highly successful spell at Hertha BSC in Germany between 1997 and 2000. His final years as a player and then player/manager was spent in Norwegian club Vålerenga, where he picked up another cup winner&#x27;s medal in 2002 before retiring in 2004. In the summer of 2007, Rekdal officially rejoined his youth club Fiksdal/Rekdal.

==International career==
Rekdal has 83 games for the Norway national team, after his debut against Italy in 1987, and played in two FIFA World Cups (1994 and 1998). He scored 17 goals for the national team, among those a long-range goal at Wembley against England in 1992, the only goal in the game as Norway beat Mexico in the 1994 World Cup, and a penalty in the 1998 World Cup against Brazil to win the game 2–1, prompting the commentator to say how &quot;the man with the yellow boots has hurt those wearing the yellow shirts...Delight for Egil Olsen&quot;. The two World Cup goals make him the highest scoring Norwegian in World Cup history, with one goal more than Arne Brustad, Dan Eggen, Håvard Flo and Tore André Flo.

==Managerial career==
===Vålerenga===
Rekdal has proven himself a successful coach, leading Vålerenga from relegation in 2001, and famously weeping as his team avoided relegation the following year and back into position as one of the dominating clubs in the Tippeligaen. In 2004, he led the team to second place, losing the first place on goal difference to Rosenborg, and in 2005, his team finally won the league for the first time in 21 years, ending Rosenborg&#x27;s 13-year reign as champions of Norway. along the way receiving legend-status in the club, partly due to the fact that he refused an offer of a six-digit coaching salary in order to help the club financially.

===Lierse===
Rekdal resigned as coach at Vålerenga on 21 August 2006, following a string of poor results. He was appointed manager of his former club Lierse on 21 November 2006. When he arrived at the club, Lierse lay bottom of the table with only two points in fifteen matches. At the end of the season, they ended up with 26 points and avoided direct relegation. In the play-offs, Lierse only managed to win three of their six matches and were relegated to the Second Division after all.

===1. FC Kaiserslautern===
In May 2007, Rekdal signed on to manage Kaiserslautern in the German 2. Bundesliga. He left the club in early February of the following year, the club lying in sixteenth place.

===Aalesund===
He joined forces with Norwegian top flight outfit Aalesund in 2008 after moving back to Norway. Joining the club mid-season, he found Aalesund lying in a relegation spot, but managed to get a relegation play-off spot, where Aalesund beat challengers Sogndal 7–2 on aggregate, thereby securing a new season in the Tippeligaen. In 2009, he led Aalesund to the club&#x27;s first victory in the Norwegian Cup, where they beat arch rivals Molde 3–2 after a penalty shootout in the final. In 2010, he led the club to the fourth place in Tippeligaen, the club&#x27;s best result ever. In 2011, he received wide praise when his club came close to the historic feat of qualifying for the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League, losing the last play-off game to the Dutch side AZ Alkmaar, having won the first leg 2–1. The same year he again led Aalesund to win the Norwegian Cup Final, thereby securing a UEFA Europa League qualification spot for the third consecutive year. His contract with Aalesund was terminated on 26 November 2012.
After he won his second Norwegian Cup with Aalesund in three years, he was once again said to take over as national team coach after Drillo.

On 26 November 2012, the board of directors of Aalesund announced the termination of Rekdal&#x27;s contract. The board stressed that it was not due to the season results, but rather as a result of a general review. Analysts noted that the sacking was likely a result of a power struggle within the club between Rekdal, the sports director and the chairman of the board.

===Return to Vålerenga===
Rekdal started his second tenure for Vålerenga, when he was appointed as head coach on 8 January 2013.

On 13 July 2016, it was announced he would end his tenure as head coach of Valerenga after the 2016 season and will move into the position as sporting director to make way for Ronny Deila whom will take over as head coach.
===Start===
Rekdal was appointed as head coach on 1 June 2018 after former head coach Mark Dempsey was sacked on 18 May 2018. Rekdal signed a two-year contract with Start.

Rekdal took over the team, after 12 games of the season had been played; during his spell, only six teams gathered more points, yet the team was relegated [at the end of that season].

That job ended; In an interview in 2020, he said that frequent visits to [places for betting/gambling or] one or more casinos, was not well-received by [his previous employer] Start.

==Personal life==
Born 6 November 1968 in Rekdal in Vestnes, into a family of six, including three younger siblings, his younger brother Sindre played also professional with Molde FK helping them win the domestic cup in 1994. Among his interests and hobbies is freshwater fishing and card-games such as Poker, having competed in amateur tournaments internationally.

Rekdal moved to Ottestad neighborhood in Hamar in 2013, with his wife and four children.

During his time at Lierse, Rekdal had a clause in his contract which allowed him to keep up to date with Leeds United results at half-time intervals, via BBC Radio. He is a fanatic supporter of the Yorkshire club.

Rekdal is highly superstitious. To avoid bad luck, he never appears on matchday without his locally produced trademark Pear-flavoured soft drink.

While coaching Aalesunds FK, he appeared in the home matches of tier five club Fiksdal/Rekdal as a player, stating that he wished to contribute to the club with which he started his career.

<text>The Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Precinct is a series of sports stadiums and venues, located in Melbourne, Victoria, in Australia. The precinct is situated around 3 km east of the Melbourne central business district, located in suburbs of Melbourne and Jolimont, near East Melbourne and Richmond.

It is considered to be Australia&#x27;s &quot;premier sports precinct&quot; and regularly hosts some of the biggest domestic and international sporting events, including the AFL Grand Final (Australian rules football), Australian Open (tennis) and Boxing Day Test (cricket). The venues have also previously hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics (for which the Precinct served as the Olympic Park) and 2006 Commonwealth Games.

The precinct comprises three areas: Olympic Park, Melbourne Park and Yarra Park.

==Sports venues and stadiums==
Of the three Park precincts; Olympic Park, Melbourne Park and Yarra Park, the Olympic and Melbourne Parks are jointly managed by the Melbourne &amp; Olympic Parks Trust, and Yarra Park is managed separately by the Melbourne Cricket Club. The precinct is bordered to the north by Wellington Parade, to the east by Punt Road, to the south by the Yarra River, and to the west by Batman Avenue.

=== Olympic Park ===

*AAMI Park (capacity 30,050; outdoor), the premier purpose-built venue for rectangular field sports (rugby league, rugby union and association football), and used for large outdoor stadium concerts.
*Melbourne Sports &amp; Entertainment Centre (indoor), a training facility used by the Collingwood Football Club, but formerly a 7,000 capacity stadium used originally for swimming, then later for basketball.

====Former venues====
*Eastern Sportsground (aka No. 2 Oval), the stadium that hosted the preliminary rounds of the field hockey competition at the 1956 Olympics. Afterward it was used for greyhound racing, then demolished for the first Collingwood training ground (Edwin Flack Field) in the precinct and later became the site of the southern section of AAMI Park. 
*Motordrome (capacity 32,000 for racing and 15,000 for football; outdoor), a former speedway and Australian rules football ground. Demolished in 1951 and replaced by Olympic Park Stadium.

*John Cain Arena (capacity 10,500; retractable roof), the premier venue for basketball and netball, the second largest court for tennis in Melbourne Park, and a venue for indoor stadium concerts. Can be converted to a velodrome for major track cycling events.
*Margaret Court Arena (capacity 7,500; retractable roof), the third-largest capacity tennis court in Melbourne Park. Also used for netball, basketball, music and other types of events.

*Melbourne Park Tennis Complex/National Tennis Centre, including two outdoor show courts (each with a 3,000 seating capacity), five indoor courts and twenty-eight outdoor Greenset courts, eight clay courts (which are not used professionally), all which are used for professional matches and available for public hire.

===Yarra Park===

*Melbourne Cricket Ground (capacity 100,000; outdoor), the premier venue for cricket and Australian rules football, and occasionally for other high-drawing field sports events.
*Punt Road Oval (capacity 2,800; outdoor), training facility for the Richmond Football Club, but formerly used for VFL/AFL Australian rules football matches and premier grade cricket.
*National Sports Museum, located at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

====Former venues====
*East Melbourne Cricket Ground, located in the north-western corner of Yarra Park, and used for Australian rules football and premier grade cricket. Demolished 1922 to make way for the Jolimont railyards.

==1956 Olympic Games==
For the 1956 Summer Olympics, several venues hosted Olympic events. The track cycling, field hockey, soccer, and the aquatic events.

==Access==
The precinct is located adjacent to both the Richmond and Jolimont railway stations; every train servicing the eastern side of Melbourne passes through one of these two stations. The precinct is also serviced by tram route 70 from the city centre. Three footbridges are provided to cross the railway lines which divide the northern and southern halves of the precinct. The area in Yarra Park surrounding the Melbourne Cricket Ground is made available for ticketed car parking during major events in the precinct; free parking in the surrounding streets is available but limited.

He has education from the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences. Sollied started his career as a manager in 1992 at Bodø/Glimt where he was player/manager in the 1. divisjon (second tier). Sollied and Bodø/Glimt won the league, and were thus promoted to the Tippeligaen. In 1993, Bodø/Glimt, as a newly promoted team, won silver in the Tippeligaen as well as winning the Norwegian Cup. After that season, Sollied retired as player and focused on the coaching job. Bodø/Glimt also finished third in the top division in 1995, and lost the cup final against Tromsø in 1996.

Sollied was dismissed from Bodø/Glimt after a disagreement with the players and the club board. He went on to Rosenborg where he served as the assistant manager under legendary coach Nils Arne Eggen in the 1997 season. That year Rosenborg won the championship. During the 1998 season Eggen took a year off, placing Sollied in the manager seat. With him in charge, Rosenborg  – once again – won the league and qualified for the UEFA Champions League.

In 1999, Sollied wanted a new challenge and therefore left the Norwegian League to try his luck in the Belgian League. His first team there was Gent. In 2000, he was offered a job at Club Brugge and stayed there until 2005. In six seasons, Sollied won everything: two championships (2003 and 2005), two cups (2002, 2004) and two Supercups (2002, 2004).

After the Norwegian national coach Nils Johan Semb retired in 2003, Sollied was mentioned as a replacement, but Sollied stated that he was only interested if he could combine the national team with his club position. This was not accepted by the Norwegian Football Association and Åge Hareide, Rosenborg coach at that time, became the new national manager.

In 2005, one year before the end of Sollied&#x27;s contract with Club Brugge, a video message was leaked to the Belgian press, in which Sollied stated that he left Brugge for Olympiacos. Sollied disputed that this video was released without his permission. It was only meant to be published after he had signed a contract, which was not yet the case according to him. In Belgium, this affair was seen as a trick to force Brugge to suspend his contract, to prevent Olympiacos from paying a hefty compensation. In a press release, Club Brugge stated that they had taken note of Sollied&#x27;s decision to suspend his contract. Sollied was officially presented by Olympiacos chairman Socrates Kokkalis as the club&#x27;s new manager. In his debut season, he won the league title and the Greek Cup, and was ranked ninth in Europe on UEFA&#x27;s list of top coaches in 2006. He also achieved winning the league title in three different countries. In December 2006, after two disappointing Champions League seasons, with Olympiakos finishing fourth (last) at group stage on both occasions, chairman Kokkalis decided to sack Sollied, despite the club being at the top of the table of Greek Super League. Former Skoda Xanthi manager, Panagiotis Lemonis, was his replacement, returning to the club after 4 years.

In June 2007, Gent confirmed the return (after seven years) of Sollied as club manager. He led the team to the Belgian cup final in 2008. On 15 March 2008, it was confirmed that Sollied had signed a two-year deal with Dutch club Heerenveen. As per 9 December 2008, the press stated that Sollied was a strong candidate to coach the national Norwegian team.
On 31 August 2009, Heerenveen announced Sollied&#x27;s dismissal.

On 19 November 2009, MKE Ankaragücü made an official statement that they hired the Norwegian manager however Sollied publicly stated that he has not signed a contract with the Turkish club.
Instead he signed for Al-Ahli, where he was fired after only three matches in 2010.
On 3 January 2011, Sollied signed a contract with the Belgian First Division-team Lierse to save the club from relegation. With one point against his old club, Club Brugge, in the decisive round, Lierse was saved from relegation.
On 6 June 2011, he announced that he had signed a contract in Gent once again, the third time in his career. He got fired from Gent on 23 October 2012, with the team positioned 7th in the league.

In June 2013, he was signed as manager for the Turkish Süper Lig side Elazığspor. With the team positioned in 16th place after nine matches, and five straight losses, Sollied resigned as manager in October 2013.

===Managerial style===
His preferred formation, 4–3–3, is not changed under almost any circumstances. He uses a zonal four-man defence, a holding midfielder behind two central midfielders, two wingers left and right and finally a powerful striker. He loves and adopts attacking football in all of his teams. This style is similar to that of Nils Arne Eggen.

<doc id="1226159" wikidata="Q2387077" url="?curid=1226159" title="Michael Malone (author)">
<text>Michael Christopher Malone (November 22, 1942 – August 19, 2022) was an American author and television writer. He was noted for his work on the ABC Daytime drama &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, as well as for his novels &quot;Handling Sin&quot; (1983), &quot;Foolscap&quot; (1991), and the murder mystery &quot;First Lady&quot; (2002).

==Early life==
Malone was born in Durham, North Carolina, on November 22, 1942. His father worked as a psychiatrist; his mother was a teacher who was deaf. His family relocated to Atlanta when he was six years old. He lived with his mother after his parents divorced. He studied English at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating in 1964. He then obtained a master&#x27;s degree from that institution two years later. Although he commenced a Doctor of Philosophy in English at Harvard University, he dropped out before finishing his thesis.

==Career==
Malone&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Painting the Roses Red&quot;, was inspired in part by his new wife and released in 1975. He recounted that he had authored the book in order to put off writing his doctoral thesis. He ultimately published 14 novels during his career. One of these, &quot;Handling Sin&quot; (1983), retold &quot;Don Quixote&quot; with the Southern United States as its setting. Another book, &quot;Foolscap&quot; (1991), was about a university professor tasked with authoring an old playwright&#x27;s biography, while &quot;First Lady&quot;, published in 2001, recounted a serial killer preying on women in a fictitious North Carolina town and became a bestseller. Malone set many of his stories in Piedmont, including &quot;First Lady&quot; and the other Justin &amp; Cuddy novels, in his region of North Carolina.

Outside of writing books, Malone became best known for his stint writing the soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. He was the serial&#x27;s head writer after being hired by Linda Gottlieb from 1991 to 1996 and garnered critical acclaim for his storylines, which included a tale involving the tight bond between an ostracized homosexual teenager and a preacher, the creation of villain/rapist Todd Manning and the character&#x27;s gang rape of Marty Saybrooke, as well as the subsequent rape trial. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that OLTL was &quot;airing some of the most literate drama ever to hit daytime – too good to be called &#x27;soap opera.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;One Life to Live&quot; was averaging 5 million viewers when Malone left in 1996. His next soap opera writing job was with &quot;Another World&quot; in 1997. He returned to write &quot;One Life to Live&quot; from 2003 to 2004. While writing &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, Malone wrote a novel called &quot;The Killing Club&quot;, which was tied into the show. For months, viewers watched character Marcie Walsh (Kathy Brier) write the book. The book was published in February 2005 with the authors listed as Marcie Walsh and Michael Malone. To explain this, Marcie said she took the book to &quot;Professor Malone&quot; at Llanview University, who helped her re-write it. After Malone&#x27;s departure from the show, Dena Higley continued this storyline, as a copycat killer murdered characters on the show exactly as had occurred in the book. In its first week of publication &quot;The Killing Club&quot; went to No. 16 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for Hardback Fiction. It later rose to No. 11.

==Personal life==
Malone was married to Maureen Quilligan, a professor of English at Duke University, for 47 years until his death. They met while he was studying at Harvard. Together, they had one child (Maggie). They resided in Hillsborough, North Carolina, from 2000, while maintaining a second home in Connecticut. Malone was a board member and a supporter of the Burwell School Historic Site.

Malone died on August 19, 2022, at his home in Clinton, Connecticut. He was 79, and suffered from pancreatic cancer for over a decade prior to his death.

<text>Kosheen are an Anglo-Welsh electronic music group based in Bristol. The group consist of singer-songwriter Sian Evans, songwriter-producer Ron Mcelroy and drummer Mitchell Glover. The name Kosheen derives from the name of a North American Apache warrior, Cochise. In Japan, it was discovered that a combination of the Japanese words for &quot;old&quot; (古, romanised transliteration &quot;ko&quot;) and &quot;new&quot; (新, &quot;shin&quot;) would make &quot;Kosheen&quot; in Japanese.

==History==
===&quot;Resist&quot; (1999–2002)===
Their first album, &quot;Resist&quot;, was released in September 2001 on Moksha Recordings/BMG and reached number eight in the UK album chart.

===&quot;Kokopelli&quot; (2003–2005)===
Their second album, &quot;Kokopelli&quot;—released in August 2003 on Moksha Recordings/Sony and named after a mythical Native American spirit—focused less on drum and bass beats and more on guitar riffs and darker-toned lyrics. It outperformed its predecessor in the UK album chart by reaching number seven, and the single &quot;All In My Head&quot; also reached number seven, but it did not sell as well as its predecessor.

===&quot;Damage&quot; (2007–2008)===
Their third album, &quot;Damage&quot;, was released in Europe via Moksha/Universal Germany in March 2007. The UK edition of &quot;Damage&quot;, featuring two new tracks—&quot;Analogue Street Dub&quot; and &quot;Professional Friend&quot; (not included on the European edition)—was released via Moksha Recordings in September 2007.

The first single from &quot;Damage&quot; was &quot;Overkill&quot;, released in March (Europe) and August (UK) 2007.

===&quot;Independence&quot; (2012–2013)===
In 2010, Kosheen set up their own label, Skeleton, with its first release, &quot;Warning&quot;, released on 27 September. On 19 December 2010, they posted the first track, &quot;Belladonna&quot;, from &quot;Independence&quot;, on their Facebook page, along with three more tracks (&quot;Waste&quot;, &quot;Enter&quot; and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Own Me&quot;) on their Soundcloud page.

On 25 October 2011, fresh from the success of Sian Evans collaboration with DJ Fresh &quot;Louder&quot; which had reached number 1 in the UK Singles Chart in July, Kosheen confirmed an album release in May 2012, and a single, titled &quot;Get a New One&quot;, on 13 February. The second single, &quot;Holding On&quot;, features Susie Ledge as the guest vocalist. An announcement was made by the band on their official website that &quot;Independence&quot; would be released at the end of September 2012. It was released on 1 October 2012. &quot;Mannequin&quot; was later released as the third single from the album. Other songs on the album include &quot;Waste&quot;, &quot;Spies&quot;, &quot;Addict&quot; and &quot;Tightly&quot;.

===&quot;Solitude&quot; (2013–2015)===
On 8 November 2013, Kosheen debuted a video for the song &quot;Harder They Fall&quot; as an introduction to their fifth studio album, &quot;Solitude&quot;. Four days later, the band uploaded the artwork to &quot;Solitude&quot; along with a release date of 25 November 2013.

===Reunion (2019–present)===
In 2019 the band reunited and started touring. No plans have been announced for new albums.

== Solo projects ==
In September 2015, Markee Ledge announced he was releasing a solo album, &quot;Elevate&quot;, featuring Susie Ledge on the title track.

<text>Proto Motors () was a South Korean sports car manufacturer and coachbuilder.

== History ==
Proto Motors was established in 1997 by the couple Han-chul Kim and Ji-sun Choi. The company has forged partnerships with Hyundai Motor Company, Kia Motors, and GM Daewoo. In 2001, the company custom-made a convertible limousine for Cheongwadae (the Equus), the South Korean presidential residence.

Proto Motors introduced the Spirra (a production model of PS-ll) at the 4th Seoul Motor Show. In 2006, Proto Motors was acquired by Oullim Motors and the development of the Spirra was continued, and in 2010 Proto Motors introduced the first Korea-made supercar. In 2014, the Oullim Motors Spirra EV, the electric version of the Spirra, was introduced.

Previously, the company specialized in redesigning existing models by developing electric cars or convertibles based on them. The company closed in 2017.

<doc id="1226218" wikidata="Q5495767" url="?curid=1226218" title="Fred Levin">
<text>Fredric Gerson Levin (March 29, 1937 – January 12, 2021) was an American plaintiffs&#x27; lawyer who served as chairman of Levin, Papantonio, Rafferty, Proctor, Buchanan, O&#x27;Brien, Barr, Mougey, P.A., a law firm in Northwest Florida. The Fredric G. Levin College of Law at the University of Florida is named for him because of a monetary donation he made to the school in 1999.

He was best known for rewriting Florida&#x27;s Medicaid Third-Party Recovery Act to allow the State of Florida to sue and recover billions of dollars from the tobacco industry for smoking-related illnesses. His flamboyant and brazen personality resulted in him being prosecuted by the Florida Bar two times, and investigated two additional times.

Levin&#x27;s life was summarized in the weekly medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot;. In its December 2014 edition, the author wrote: &quot;&quot;And Give Up Showbiz?&quot; explores the extraordinary life of a pioneering and often controversial lawyer. Seen as an inspiring innovator by some, and a flamboyant self-promoter by others, Levin&#x27;s work was not always met with a favourable outcome. Levin was accused of two murders, and often met with controversy because of his relentless fight for justice against big companies. His home life, while loving, was often neglected in his pursuit of business, and this is mentioned several times in the book—bringing a sense of balance to the stories.&quot;

==Personal life==
Levin was born in 1937, in Pensacola, Florida. He grew up in a conservative Jewish household, with his mother (Rose), father (Abe), and brothers (David, Herman, Stanley, Martin, and Allen). His father was a pawnbroker catering to the large military presence in the Pensacola area, and also ran the concessions at the Pensacola Greyhound Park and at a store on Pensacola Beach. Levin attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, as an undergraduate, but did not do well academically. Instead, he was known as a drinker, smoker, and gambler. He was a member of Pi Lambda Phi, one of two Jewish fraternities on campus. While attending the University of Florida, Levin met his future wife, Marilyn, who was a member of the Jewish sorority Alpha Epsilon Phi. The Levins were married for 51 years, when Marilyn died on February 6, 2011, survived by their four children, seven grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

Levin began law studies in 1958, as a student enrolled in the College of Law at the University of Florida. This was mostly due to his reluctance to leave behind the college party lifestyle, as well as the fact that his older brother David had established a small law firm where Levin could work. He attended summer classes to raise his Grade Point Average for law school admission, as his grade scores were below the required minimum 2.0 G.P.A. (Note: In 1958, virtually any white male could gain admittance to Florida public law school, where approximately one-third would graduate.)

In Levin&#x27;s first few weeks of law school, he received word that his brother Martin was rapidly succumbing to late stage leukemia, and his death was imminent. Levin approached the dean of the law school, asking for time off from school to attend his brother&#x27;s funeral. The dean looked at Levin&#x27;s undergraduate course records, said that he could take the days off, and added that he needn&#x27;t return to school, as he doubted Levin would make it through law school successfully.

Levin drove from Gainesville to Pensacola, but Martin died before he arrived at his brother&#x27;s bedside in Pensacola. Ignoring his dean&#x27;s advice, Levin returned to law school where he thrived, finishing third in his class. Post-graduation, his plans were to go back to Pensacola, spend one year in practice with his brother David&#x27;s law firm, and then go back to college to pursue a Master&#x27;s degree in tax law. At that point, he had never considered or intended on working as a trial lawyer, as he was terrified by public speaking.

On January 12, 2021, Levin died from COVID-19 complications.

==Legal career==
In 1961, Levin began practicing in the law firm of Levin &amp; Askew (now known as Levin Papantonio Rafferty) in Pensacola. The firm was founded by his brother David and Reubin Askew, who eventually would go on to become a two-term governor of Florida and candidate for President of the United States.

Levin began his legal career in family law, but once a client explained that her husband said he would kill her divorce lawyer, he chose to switch to general civil law. His first case involved an insurance dispute over a residential fire claim. The case ended up before a jury. Levin won the case and decided he wanted to become a trial lawyer.

In the late 1960s, Levin handled a case involving the wrongful death of a child who had taken the antibiotic Chloromycetin. Levin won the case. While the compensatory damages were not large, the judge allowed Levin to pursue a punitive damage claim which ended up playing a role in the drug being pulled from the market in the United States for most uses.

Levin received national attention with the case of &quot;Thorshov v. L&amp;N&quot;. On November 9, 1977, Dr. Jon Thorshov, a thirty-eight-year-old physician, his wife, his four-year-old daughter, and his one-year-old son were at their home in Pensacola when a freight train operated by L&amp;N derailed near their home and released anhydrous ammonia. The family attempted to escape their home, but were overcome by the fumes. Dr. and Ms. Thorshov died, and both children sustained serious physical injuries. In 1980, Levin received a jury verdict for the family in the amount of $18 million. As a result of the verdict, &quot;Us&quot; magazine did a story on Levin in its swimsuit preview issue. On the cover were Randi Oakes from &quot;CHiPs&quot;, Morgan Fairchild from &quot;Flamingo Road&quot;, and Donna Mills from &quot;Knots Landing&quot;. Inside was a half-page picture of Levin standing in front of an L&amp;N railcar under the headline, &quot;I&#x27;ll Sue&quot;.

Levin received more than thirty jury verdicts in excess of $1,000,000 (six in excess of $10,000,000). At various points in his career he held the national record for jury verdicts involving the wrongful death of a child, the wrongful death of a housewife, the wrongful death of a wage earner, and the largest personal injury verdict in the state of Florida. He was listed in every edition of &quot;Best Lawyers in America&quot;; was a member of the Inner Circle of Advocates; and was inducted into the National Trial Lawyers Hall of Fame in 2009.

==Tobacco litigation==
Levin played a significant role in the litigation brought by numerous states against the tobacco industry during the 1990s. Levin was at a trial lawyer conference when another attorney saw Levin drinking whiskey and smoking a cigarette. The attorney told Levin that smoking was going to kill him, and that he was working with the State of Mississippi to sue the tobacco industry for compensation for all the money Mississippi was spending in Medicaid dollars treating smoking related illnesses. Levin did not believe the legal theory would be successful, explaining that the tobacco industry had never paid a penny to anyone as a result of smoking injuries.

Levin returned to Pensacola and thought about the potential case, and went to the Florida statute allowing the state of Florida to recover against individuals and companies that harm someone where the State has to pay Medicaid. Levin thought that with a few changes in the statute&#x27;s language, he could rewrite the law so that the State could sue the tobacco industry without the tobacco industry being able to raise the numerous defenses it had relied upon in winning the cases against it.

Levin made the changes, and then approached a good friend who was the dean of the Florida Senate. The two then went to the Governor of Florida, who supported the concept. The dean of the Senate was able to get the law passed on the last day of session and at the last minute. The Senator made it part of another law that received unanimous support in the Senate, and Levin&#x27;s amendments passed. When the tobacco industry discovered the true intent of the law, it began donating money to Florida senators to repeal the statute. The Senate voted to repeal it, but the Governor vetoed the repeal. The Senate then came within one vote of overriding the Governor&#x27;s veto, but could not, and the law stood.

After the passage of the law, John French, a lobbyist for Philip Morris USA, stated, &quot;This is probably the single biggest issue to ever have been run through in the dead of the night.&quot; John Shebel, president of the pro-business organization Associated Industries of Florida, told the Orlando Sun-Sentinel, &quot;This law is probably one of the worst laws ever passed by any Legislature.&quot; Walker Merryman, vice president of the Tobacco Institute, said, &quot;It&#x27;s certainly creative, and it demonstrates how a government will try to impose a significant financial burden on one portion of the economy.&quot;

Gannett News Service wrote: &quot;What they engineered was a first-of-its-kind bill making it much easier for the state to recoup money it spends for treating cancer patients and others with smoking-related diseases. ... Its created such an uproar in Tallahassee that tobacco companies have pledged millions of dollars to fight the bill either by getting it vetoed or using the upcoming special session on health care to change or eliminate it.&quot;

&quot;I could say, I think without exaggerating, that the financial life of the tobacco industry is riding on [the veto of the bill]&quot;, said John Banahaf, executive director of Action on Smoking and Health. Professor Richard Daynard of Northeastern University called the bill: &quot;the single biggest blow against the tobacco industry and for the public health that&#x27;s ever been done in the United states.&quot;

Challenges to the law made it the United States Supreme Court, but was upheld. Immediately after jury selection, the tobacco industry settled with the State of Florida for a record $13 billion. Levin&#x27;s law firm would end up earning a fee of more than $300 million. Soon thereafter, Levin appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot; talking to reporter John Stossel. While interviewing him for the piece, Levin lit up a cigarette, which ABC highlighted in the segment. Next, he appeared on two full pages of &quot;George&quot; magazine, standing on his putting green in a tuxedo, drinking Crown Royal whiskey and smoking a cigarette. He was then highlighted in a &quot;Time&quot; article entitled: &quot;Are Lawyers Running America?&quot;

==Florida Bar==
Levin had a lengthy and hostile relationship with the Florida Bar whom he often and openly referred to as &quot;lily-white elitists, country club, men&quot;. He has been prosecuted by the Florida Bar on two occasions, and formally investigated on another two occasions. In the first investigation, Levin stated on his primetime, live, call-in, television show that doctors have &quot;this God-complex--they think they are above the law.&quot; The investigation did not result in bar charges. In the second investigation, and first prosecution, Levin admitted on his television show to gambling on football games, and said he found nothing wrong with it. He mocked law enforcement for arresting and prosecuting local bookies, as if they were an elite swat team fighting terrorism. He commented that the local law enforcement and prosecutors wouldn&#x27;t have the guts to go down to the high crime streets in Pensacola to arrest drug dealers and rapists because they would be scared to get shot. The Florida Bar charged Levin with ethics violation as he was admitting to violations of Florida law, and demeaning the legal profession. Levin was found guilty and a public reprimand was recommended. Levin challenged the decision to the United States Supreme Court, but in the end he received his public reprimand.

The third investigation, and second prosecution, involved Levin&#x27;s use of the word &quot;ridiculous&quot; to describe the defense in two separate civil cases. Levin won both cases and received large jury verdicts, but both verdicts were taken away on appeal because the appellate court believed Levin inflamed the jury by calling the defense ridiculous. The Florida Bar then brought charges against Levin alleging that his closing argument violated ethics rules because he was stating his personal opinion. This was the first time in U.S. history that a lawyer was charged by a bar disciplinary committee in a situation such as this. This time Levin was found innocent.

The fourth investigation occurred when a friend of Levin&#x27;s, the Senator who passed the tobacco legislation, was being prosecuted for violations of the Florida Sunshine Law. The key witness against the Senator (who now was a county commissioner) was another local county commissioner who claimed the now former Senator offered him a bribe to pass an item before him. When the former Senator was convicted of violation of the Sunshine Law, Levin made comments to the press calling the witness a &quot;rat fink&quot;. He then told the &quot;Pensacola News Journal&quot;, &quot;If [the witness] was on the &quot;Titanic&quot;, he would dress like a woman and jump on the first lifeboat.&quot; Levin called the judge&#x27;s ruling not to free the politician while he appealed &quot;unconscionable&quot;. He also assailed the judge. &quot;I have never been so embarrassed or ashamed of the legal profession&quot;, he told the paper. &quot;I believe the inmates have taken over the asylum.&quot; Asked what exactly he meant, Levin replied, &quot;That means the nuts are in charge.&quot;

Levin&#x27;s comments led to an ethics complaint being filed against Levin with the Florida Bar—the third in his career. Months later, the Florida Bar&#x27;s grievance committee ruled there was no cause to pursue a full investigation into the matter. However, the Florida Bar sent Levin a &quot;letter of advice&quot; as to how to act in the future. The letter said: &quot;While your conduct in this instance does not warrant formal discipline, the committee believes that it was not consistent with the high standards of our profession. The committee hopes that this letter will make you more aware of your obligation to uphold these professional standards, and that you will adjust your conduct accordingly.&quot;

==Death of Jake Horton==

On April 10, 1989, at approximately 1:00 p.m. C.S.T., a twin-engine Beechcraft King Air 200 crashed within minutes of takeoff from Pensacola Regional Airport, killing the two pilots and the single passenger, Jacob F. &quot;Jake&quot; Horton. The plane was owned by Southern Company, an American electric utility holding company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. The company is currently the 16th largest utility company in the world, and the fourth largest in the U.S.

Jake was a senior vice-president at Gulf Power Company, a subsidiary of Southern Company. The cause of the plane crash has never been solved, with theories including pilot error, poor maintenance, sabotage, and suicide. Levin became embroiled in the incident because he was one of the last people to speak with Jake, and he also was legal counsel for Gulf Power.

In the months before the plane crash, Southern Company was under a federal grand jury investigation for possible tax evasion and inappropriate political contributions. Gulf Power and Jake were at the center of the investigation, with Southern Company claiming that Jake was the primary responsible party. Between 9:30 a.m. and 11:15 a.m. C.S.T. on April 10, 1989, Jake met privately with Levin in his office. Levin&#x27;s law firm had been serving as private counsel for Gulf Power for many years, and Levin also was a close personal friend of Jake. Southern Company wanted Levin to convince Jake to resign, but Jake wished to remain employed and clear his name. Prior to leaving Levin&#x27;s office, Jake ordered a corporate plane to take him from Pensacola to Atlanta where he wished to meet with the president of Southern Company. Jake boarded the plane approximately 1.5 hours later, and within minutes the plane crashed, killing all on board. Within three hours after the crash, the Escambia County Sheriff&#x27;s Office received an anonymous call stating: &quot;You can stop investigating Gulf Power now. We took care of that.&quot; Within two weeks of the plane crash, and in protest to Southern Company blaming Jake, Levin quit as counsel for Gulf Power.

Over the next year, the federal grand jury investigation continued, and Levin eventually was called to testify. Southern Company took the position that Levin was not permitted to testify because his knowledge was subject to attorney–client privilege. Southern Company finally agreed to allow Levin to testify, but only on the limited subject of his conversation with Jake on the morning of the plane crash. Southern Company would not permit Levin to talk to the National Transportation Safety Board or the Escambia County Sheriff&#x27;s Office.

In the days before Levin was scheduled to testify, someone began leaving parakeets at his home and office with their necks broken. Also, someone called the FBI stating that Levin would be killed if he were to testify. Levin testified with U.S. Marshals escorting him to and from the hearing.

Despite numerous federal and state investigations, and multiple lawsuits, the cause of the plane crash has never been solved. Gulf Power ended up pleading guilty to illegal political contributions and other violations, and paid a $500,000 fine. Gulf Power blamed Horton for the illegal events.

==Career in boxing==
In 1989, Levin began managing the boxing career of Roy Jones Jr., who had just returned from Seoul, Korea, having earned a silver medal in the 1988 Olympic Games. The fact that Roy did not win the gold medal became an international issue after it was discovered that three of the judges had been subject to inappropriate contact, and yet awarded the gold medal to Roy&#x27;s opponent or ruled it a draw. Roy had dominated his opponent (Park Si-hun), landing almost three times as many punches. Although the three judges were suspended, with two being banned for life, Roy was not awarded the gold medal. He was, however, awarded the outstanding competitor in the games by the International Amateur Boxing Association.

The fact that Levin was chosen to help manage Roy&#x27;s career was controversial considering he had no experience in the boxing business. Roy had been courted by some of the biggest names in boxing, including Don King and Sugar Ray Leonard. Roy&#x27;s father, Roy Jones Sr., chose Levin to manage his son&#x27;s career because Jones Sr. no longer trusted the boxing establishment after the Olympic decision. Jones Sr. once stated: &quot;The boxing biz has stolen the medal from my son.&quot;

Levin negotiated a middleweight championship fight for Roy against James Toney. Roy won the fight, and then earned a multimillion-dollar long-term contract with HBO. Levin received the 1995 Al Buck Award from the Boxing Writers Association of America as boxing manager of the year; and received the Rocky Marciano Foundation President&#x27;s Award in 2001.

Levin managed Roy&#x27;s boxing career from 1989 to 2003. Levin&#x27;s last fight with Roy involved heavyweight champion John Ruiz on March 1, 2003. Ruiz had recently defeated Evander Holyfield for the championship. Jones officially weighed in at 193 pounds to Ruiz&#x27;s 226 pounds. Jones won by unanimous decision, becoming the first former middleweight title holder to win a heavyweight title in 106 years, the last being Bob Fitzsimmons in 1896. Jones also became the first fighter in history to start his career as a junior middleweight and become a heavyweight champion.

==Fighting racial injustice==

When Levin entered the University of Florida College of Law in 1958, George Starke, the first African American student to enter a public institution in the state of Florida, entered with Levin&#x27;s class. Levin described the first day as follows: &quot;They had all of us on one side of the auditorium and he was all by himself, except for all the Secret Service people. Up to that point, I had not thought much about racial issues. I looked over and my heart went out to him. Here were 350 white law students and this one black guy. He was dressed in a suit, and the rest of us were dressed like bums. They started shuffling him, which is rubbing your feet together on the floor like they do in prison. ... I always studied in the library, and I would look across at George because he always had to sit at a table by himself and everybody would shuffle their feet. It just tore me up. I wanted to go over and sit with him, but I didn&#x27;t have the guts.&quot;

After the first semester of law school, Levin approached George to become his study partner. The two remained friends for the next two years. Although Levin ended up graduating number three out of his graduating class, George failed to graduate.

In an oral history interview conducted by Samuel Proctor at the University of Florida, Levin described the final events leading to George leaving the University of Florida. &quot;We were going to study for the exam the next day, I told him to meet me at my apartment. I was running a little late, and I got there, and he&#x27;s sitting on the steps, we were an upstairs apartment. I said, &#x27;Why didn&#x27;t you go on in?&#x27; He said, &#x27;You don&#x27;t understand, a colored man doesn&#x27;t go into an apartment where a white woman is.&#x27; I said, &#x27;Oh the hell with it, come on.&#x27; So we came in, Marilyn cooked supper for us, and we studied all night long. I had these little flip cards that worked real well. All night long. He goes home, and I clean up and go to the exam, and he never shows up. He had gone home just to lay down for a second [snap of fingers], slept through the exam. They wouldn&#x27;t give him another exam, they flunked him.&quot;

When the law school was renamed to the Fredric G. Levin College of Law in 1999, George attended in support of Levin.

Shortly after becoming a lawyer in Pensacola, Levin nominated Nathaniel Dedmond to be the first African American as a member of the Escambia-Santa Rosa Counties Bar Association. Several lawyers in the association were offended by the nomination and had their wives call Marilyn, Levin&#x27;s wife. They asked Marilyn how she would like to be sitting next to Nathaniel Dedmond&#x27;s wife at a bar meeting. They were hoping to get Marilyn to go to Fred and have him drop the nomination. Instead, Marilyn replied: &quot;Oh, yes, that will be fine.&quot; Levin commented that he had never been more proud of Marilyn. When the nomination came up for vote, the association voted against Levin&#x27;s nomination.

In 1999, Levin received recognition for his support of the African American community by being named a chief of the country of Ghana, and receiving a citation from the U.S. Congressional Black Caucus; which provides in part: &quot;We of the Congressional Black Caucus wish to join with the distinguished world citizens and other leaders in congratulating you on your designation as a Ghanaian Chief. But more specifically, we wish to honor your lifelong contributions to bettering the lives of the people of Ghana and the people of America. Long before we became aware of your outstanding contributions in Africa, we knew of your work as a lawyer fighting on the side of underprivileged people in America. We thank you for that rich legacy. We are proud that the world community is now beginning to recognize your valuable service to it as well.&quot;

==Awards and honors==

Levin received the Perry Nichols Award in 1994, which is the highest honor bestowed by the Florida Justice Association, and is given in recognition of a person&#x27;s lifetime achievements in the pursuit of justice.

For the year 1999, &quot;The National Law Journal&quot; named Levin as the top civil litigator in Florida. This honor encompassed plaintiff and defense counsel. Levin also was named in the October 4, 1999, edition of &quot;The National Law Journal&quot; as one of the &quot;Top Ten Litigators for 1999&quot;, which again included both plaintiff and defense counsel.

In 1999, Levin was honored at the United Nations by being made a chief in the Republic of Ghana. This honor was bestowed on Levin because of his lifetime of dedication to equal justice for people of all races. At the same time, Levin received a citation honoring him by the United States Congressional Black Caucus.

Levin was a member of the Inner Circle of Advocates, an organization limited to 100 of the top trial attorneys in the country, and has been listed in every edition of the publication &quot;Best Lawyers in America&quot;. In 2009, he was inducted into The National Trial Lawyers Hall of Fame. In 2016, Levin was named Trial Lawyer of the Year by The National Trial Lawyers.

In December 2017, Levin was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws from University of West Florida.

==Later career==

At the age of 80, Levin continued to practice law. &quot;I want the practice of law to continue&quot;, he said. &quot;I want there to be lawyers. Less and less people are going to law school now. In 2013, applications to accredited law schools dropped for a third consecutive year. My son, Martin, left the practice of law because of its transformation from the personal--a lawyer representing one client--to a business where a lawyer represents thousands of clients in mass tort or class action.&quot; Despite his opposition to mass torts, Levin agreed to transfer his law firm&#x27;s primary practice to this niche area of law. The firm now runs Mass Torts Made Perfect, a conference held twice a year, usually in Las Vegas, to bring together mass tort lawyers from across the country.

In 2013, when he was 76, he won a $3.4 million jury verdict in an ATV case. In 2014, at the age of 77, he won a $12.6 million jury verdict in an automobile accident case. In 2016 (age 79), he was named national Trial Lawyer of the Year.

==Charitable work==

In 1995, Levin gave a professorship at the University of West Florida, in honor of his father.

In 1998, Levin gave the University of Florida law school $10 million, the second largest cash donation ever given to a public law school as of that time. In 1999, the law school name was officially changed to the University of Florida Fredric G. Levin College of Law.

In 1998, Levin contributed $2 million to the Levin &amp; Papantonio Family Foundation.

In 2006, Levin gave the University of Florida law school $2 million to help fund the Martin H. Levin Advocacy Center.

In 2013, Levin gave $1 million in memory of his recently deceased wife to the Lubavitch-Chabad Student and Community Center at the University of Florida.

In 2015, Levin (along with his sister-in-law Teri) gave $1 million to the YMCA of Northwest Florida to support the construction of its new facility in downtown Pensacola.

In 2016, Levin gave $1 million to the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition to help fund the institute&#x27;s 30,000 square foot research facility in artificial intelligence, robotics, human-centered computing, agile and distributed computing, and many related areas.

In 2017, Levin gave $550,000 to the University of West Florida to establish the Reubin O&#x27;D. Askew Institute for Multidisciplinary Studies.

In 2017, Levin gave $2 million to the Brigham &amp; Women&#x27;s Hospital to establish the Fredric G. Levin Distinguished Chair in Thoracic Surgery and Lung Cancer Research. The gift was given in honor of Dr. Raphael Bueno for saving Mr. Levin&#x27;s life after he was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer.

In 2018, Levin gave an $8 million home, including its personal belongings, to the University of West Florida. In honor of the gift, the school named its government department the Reubin O&#x27;D. Askew Department of Government, after Levin&#x27;s former law partner and two-term governor of the state of Florida.

In 2019, Levin gave 300,000 shares of Charlotte&#x27;s Web Holdings, LLC stock to the University of Florida Levin College of Law. At the time of the announcement of the donation, the stock was valued at $6 million.

In 2019, Levin donated $2 million to Dana–Farber Cancer Institute to establish the Fredric G. Levin Endowment in Translational Cancer Research.

In 2021, Levin donated an additional $40 million to the University of Florida Levin College of Law through his estate.

==Levin College of Law==

The Fredric G. Levin College of Law at the University of Florida is named for him because of a $10 million cash donation he made to the school in 1999. The gift was the largest-ever cash donation to the University of Florida; the second-largest gift ever to a public law school when matched with state funds; and more than three times larger than any gift in the college&#x27;s 90-year history. The naming drew statewide attention because of the vehement criticism of having the state&#x27;s prestigious law school named after a person many thought to be reprehensible and undeserving.

One letter to the then dean of the law school read: &quot;I have no problem with naming the law school in honor of an appropriate person, as other colleges have done, but naming our college after Fred Levin does no honor to him, to the institution, or its constituency, and demeans the efforts of the many deans, faculty, and alumni who have worked for so many years to achieve the vision of making our college one of the top twenty law schools. ... You degraded the image and prestige of the University of Florida College of Law by selling its good name to Fred Levin, a lawyer who has been castigated by the courts for abusing the rules, and is notorious for commercializing the practice, thumbing his nose at the bar, and otherwise manipulating the system.&quot; In response, Levin told the press: &quot;Two hundred years from now the great, great, great grandchildren (of my critics) will be getting their law degrees from a school with my name on it. It&#x27;s a good feeling.&quot; &quot;It makes me feel great, when their great-grandchildren go up to that stage to get the law degree, they&#x27;ll know that, dadgum it, that Jew&#x27;s name is up there on the damn diploma. It&#x27;s just gotta eat at them.&quot;

==Health issues and death==
In January 2016, Levin was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer that had metastasized to his brain. The brain tumor was removed at the University of Florida Health, and he was treated for his lung cancer at Dana–Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital.

Levin died from COVID-19 on January 12, 2021, after surviving stage 4 lung and brain cancer. He was asymptomatic for 10 days and died within 5 days of experiencing any symptoms. He was 83 years old.

<text>CFU758 is a low-power broadcaster, using the on-air brand &quot;90.7 RAV FM&quot;. It is the only licensed high school radio station in Thornhill, Ontario, and is owned and operated by Hodan Nalayeh Secondary School. RAV FM is part of the school&#x27;s radio broadcasting course, and is one of a small number of Canadian radio stations licensed to a high school.

== History ==

RAV FM first signed on in 1999 on 106.3 MHz, utilizing a combination of students and faculty as station operators and program directors.

Rob Basile was the station&#x27;s original founder, and a teacher at Hodan Nalayeh Secondary School. Under Basile&#x27;s guidance, the station voluntarily changed to 90.7 MHz to avoid interference with CKAV-FM in 2002. After launching CIRR-FM at the beginning of 2007, he remained that station&#x27;s program director, the duties of program director were given to Chris &quot;Punch&quot; Andrews, who also continued his on-air duties at CKFM-FM. After the death of Andrews in 2008, Ronald Johnson was named the new program director of the station. To honour the memory of Andrews, the studio was renamed the Punch Andrews Studio. Up until this point it was student-led broadcasting and was still using the original mixer board donated to the station by CHUM FM. In 2009, Matthew Rondina, a media teacher at Hodan Nalayeh Secondary School assumed the program director, removing the elements of student leadership and independence from the station. The original equipment was removed and the studio was completely changed. Under Rondina&#x27;s changes students were no longer able to run their own shows and the station ceased to exist as a club/ extra curricular activity.

Because RAV FM is no longer student-led, the station continues to run without student support during off times in the scholar year, using a set playlist.

== Studio and Equipment ==
RAV FM provides a low power signal from on top of Hodan Nalayeh Secondary School. The studios are located on the second floor of the school. Additional equipment is placed on the restricted fourth floor. The radio station was originally equipped with Quickpix and OpLog automation software. Music scheduling was done using MusicMaster. The radio station also used a Nicom transmitter and Omnia 3 Turbo on air processor. All audio was logged using iMediaLogger. Currently, the station utilizes an Allen &amp; Heath XB–14 radio broadcast mixer, equipped with four microphones, a telephone and a main broadcast computer to transmit music and other audio elements.

== Signal ==
This signal is fairly strong around the school, and travels farthest in a southwest direction from the school toward York University and Jane and Finch. The approximate diameter for reception of RAV-FM under normal weather conditions is as far north as Elgin Mills Road, as far west as Highway 400, as far south as Sheppard Avenue and as far east as Yonge Street. Reception will vary greatly depending on the radio being used.

== Broadcasting Course ==
RAV FM was originally run as an extracurricular activity consisting of student-led shows based on a variety of subjects, such as sports, news and music. During the 2012–2013 scholar year, RAV ceased to exist as an extracurricular activity, and became a course, under the code AWS 201. The course has since been taught by Matthew Rondina and explores radio communication as well as the entertainment industry aspects of broadcasting, including social networking.

==Co-operative Education Program ==
During the 2013–2014 scholar year, RAV FM became a co-operative education work placement. Students would assume the role of studio manager and assume the duties of day–to–day operation of the studio and station. These duties include social media updates, music library/playlist updates and promotions/advertising.

== Covid-19 ==
RAV-FM shutdown at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. The station is not currently in operation, but there are plans to revitalize the broadcasting course and subsequently the radio room in the school. This recommencement of the use of the room should begin by late 2023.

<text>CKVI-FM is a Canadian community radio station, owned and operated by Kingston Collegiate and Vocational Institute in Kingston, Ontario. The station broadcasts at 91.9 on the FM dial, and uses the on-air brand &quot;The Cave&quot;. CKVI was the first high school radio station to be granted a broadcasting license by the CRTC.

CKVI now broadcasts up to 52 hours a week. Its programming includes multiple styles, cultures, and genres of music.

==History==
Initially licensed by the CRTC in 1996, it was the first licensed high school radio station in Canada. The station didn&#x27;t go on air until the 1997–1998 school year because the station is run by high school students and had to wait until the start of the following year.

The station is run by students who are part of the Radio Broadcasting county-wide focus program which is open to any Grade 11, 12, and returning 12th year students in the Limestone District School Board.

On November 28, 2016, KCVI Educational Radio Station Incorporated (KCVI) applied to operate the station as a regular-powered radio station.
The CRTC approved KCVI&#x27;s application on May 5, 2017.

On April 5, 2022, the CRTC approved KCVI&#x27;s application to increase CKVI&#x27;s effective radiated power (ERP) from 7 to 30 watts, and decrease the effective height of the antenna above average terrain (HAAT) from 34.5 to 33 metres.

<doc id="1226250" wikidata="Q1192530" url="?curid=1226250" title="Acute liver failure">
<text>Acute liver failure is the appearance of severe complications rapidly after the first signs (such as jaundice) of liver disease, and indicates that the liver has sustained severe damage (loss of function of 80–90% of liver cells). The complications are hepatic encephalopathy and impaired protein synthesis (as measured by the levels of serum albumin and the prothrombin time in the blood). The 1993 classification defines &quot;hyperacute&quot; as within 1 week, &quot;acute&quot; as 8–28 days, and &quot;subacute&quot; as 4–12 weeks; both the speed with which the disease develops and the underlying cause strongly affect outcomes.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The main features of acute liver failure are rapid-onset jaundice, weakness, and eventually, changes in mental status that can begin as mild confusion but progress to coma, known as hepatic encephalopathy.

===Encephalopathy and cerebral edema===

In ALF, hepatic encephalopathy leads to cerebral edema, coma, brain herniation, and eventually death. Detection of encephalopathy is central to the diagnosis of ALF. It may vary from subtle deficit in higher brain function (e.g. mood, concentration in grade I) to deep coma (grade IV). Patients presenting as acute and hyperacute liver failure are at greater risk of developing cerebral edema and grade IV encephalopathy. The pathogenesis remains unclear, but is likely to be a consequence of several phenomena. There is a buildup of toxic substances like ammonia, mercaptan, serotonin and tryptophan in the brain. This affects neurotransmitter level and neuroreceptor activation. Autoregulation of cerebral blood flow is impaired, and is associated with anaerobic glycolysis and oxidative stress. Neuronal cell astrocytes are susceptible to these changes, and they swell up, resulting in increased intracranial pressure. Inflammatory mediators also play important role.

Unfortunately, signs of elevated intracranial pressure, such as papilledema and loss of pupillary reflexes, are not reliable, and occur late in the disease process. CT imaging of the brain is also unhelpful in detecting early cerebral oedema, but is often performed to rule out intra-cerebral bleeding. Invasive intracranial pressure monitoring via subdural route is often recommended; however, the risk of complications must be weighed against the possible benefit (1% fatal haemorrhage). The aim is to maintain intracranial pressures below 25 mm Hg, and cerebral perfusion pressures above 50 mm Hg.

===Coagulopathy===

Coagulopathy is another cardinal feature of ALF. The liver has the central role in the synthesis of almost all coagulation factors and some inhibitors of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Hepatocellular necrosis leads to impaired synthesis of many coagulation factors and their inhibitors. The former produces a prolongation in prothrombin time which is widely used to monitor the severity of hepatic injury. There is significant platelet dysfunction (with both quantitative and qualitative platelet defects). Progressive thrombocytopenia with the loss of larger and more active platelets is almost universal. Thrombocytopenia with or without DIC increases risk of intracerebral bleeding.

===Kidney failure===
Kidney failure is common, present in more than 50% of ALF patients, either due to original insult such as paracetamol resulting in acute tubular necrosis or from hyperdynamic circulation leading to hepatorenal syndrome or functional kidney failure. Because of impaired production of urea, blood urea does not represent the degree of kidney impairment.

===Inflammation and infection===
About 60% of all ALF patients fulfil the criteria for systemic inflammatory syndrome irrespective of presence or absence of infection. This often contributes towards multi organ failure. Impaired host defence mechanism, due to impaired opsonization, chemotaxis and intracellular killing, substantially increases risk of sepsis. Bacterial sepsis mostly due to gram positive organisms and fungal sepsis are observed in up to 80% and 30% patients, respectively.

===Metabolic derangements===
Hyponatraemia is an almost universal finding due to water retention and a shift in intracellular sodium transport from inhibition of Na/K ATPase. Hypoglycaemia (due to depleted hepatic glycogen store and hyperinsulinaemia), hypokalaemia, hypophosphataemia and metabolic alkalosis are often present, independent of renal function. Lactic acidosis occurs predominantly in paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) overdose.

===Haemodynamic and cardio-respiratory compromise===

Hyperdynamic circulation, with peripheral vasodilatation from low systemic vascular resistance, leads to hypotension. There is a compensatory increase in cardiac output. Adrenal insufficiency has been documented in 60% of ALF cases, and is likely to contribute in haemodynamic compromise. There is also abnormal oxygen transport and utilization. Although delivery of oxygen to the tissues is adequate, there is a decrease in tissue oxygen uptake, resulting in tissue hypoxia and lactic acidosis.

Pulmonary complications occur in up to 50% of patients. Severe lung injury and hypoxemia result in high mortality. Most cases of severe lung injury are due to ARDS, with or without sepsis. Pulmonary haemorrhage, pleural effusions, atelectasis, and intrapulmonary shunts also contribute to respiratory difficulty.

===Late pregnancy===

In late pregnancy liver function decreases significantly, which can be easily monitored by blood tests. Early clinical manifestations of ALF in late pregnancy include hypodynamia, decrease in appetite, dark amber urine, deep jaundice, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention. Among patients whose deaths were attributed to ALF in late pregnancy, the majority had experienced vaginal deliveries.

==Causes==

Common causes for acute liver failure are paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose, idiosyncratic reaction to medication (e.g. tetracycline, troglitazone), excessive alcohol consumption (severe alcoholic hepatitis), viral hepatitis (hepatitis A or B—it is extremely uncommon in hepatitis C), acute fatty liver of pregnancy, and idiopathic (without an obvious cause). Reye syndrome is acute liver failure in a child with a viral infection (e.g. chickenpox); it appears that aspirin use may play a significant role. Wilson&#x27;s disease (hereditary copper accumulation) may infrequently present with acute liver failure. Acute liver failure also results from poisoning by the death cap mushroom (&quot;Amanita phalloides&quot;) as well as other amatoxin-producing fungus species. Certain strains of &quot;Bacillus cereus&quot;—a common species of bacterium implicated as a frequent cause of food poisoning—can cause fulminant liver failure through the production of cereulide, a toxin which destroys the mitochondria in affected hepatocytes, resulting in cell death. While most instances of &quot;B. cereus&quot; infection are resolved by the body&#x27;s immune system and do not affect the liver, severe cases resulting in liver damage can be fatal without immediate treatment or liver transplantation.

== Pathophysiology ==

In the majority of acute liver failure (ALF) there is widespread hepatocellular necrosis beginning in the centrizonal distribution and progressing towards portal tracts. The degree of parenchymal inflammation is variable and is proportional to duration of disease.

Zone 1 (periportal) occurs in phosphorus poisoning or eclampsia.
Zone 2 (mid-zonal), although rare, is seen in yellow fever.
Zone 3 (centrilobular) occurs with ischemic injury, toxic effects, carbon tetrachloride exposure, or chloroform ingestion. In acute acetaminophen overdose, toxification occurs, mostly in Zone III which has the highest level of P450 micro-enzymes. That fact along with Zone III&#x27;s decreased oxygen level helps to explain why it is preferentially one of the initial sites of damage.

==Diagnosis==

All patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of moderate to severe acute hepatitis should have an immediate measurement of prothrombin time and careful evaluation of mental status. If the prothrombin time is prolonged by ≈ 4–6 seconds or more (INR ≥ 1.5),
and there is any evidence of altered sensorium, the diagnosis of ALF should be strongly suspected, and hospital admission is mandatory. Initial laboratory examination must be extensive in order to evaluate both the etiology and severity.

;Initial laboratory analysis
* Prothrombin time/INR
* Complete blood count
* Chemistries
** Liver function test: AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, GGT, total bilirubin, albumin
** Creatinine, urea/blood urea nitrogen, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, phosphate
** Glucose
** Amylase and lipase
* Arterial blood gas, lactate
* Blood type and screen
* Paracetamol (acetaminophen) level, toxicology screen
* Viral hepatitis serologies: anti-HAV IgM, HBSAg, anti-HBc IgM, anti-HCV
* Autoimmune markers: ANA, ASMA, LKMA, immunoglobulin levels
* Ceruloplasmin level (when Wilson&#x27;s disease suspected)
* Pregnancy test (females)
* Ammonia (arterial if possible)
* HIV status (has implication for transplantation)

History taking should include a careful review of possible exposures to viral infection and drugs or other toxins. From history and clinical examination, the possibility of underlying chronic disease should be ruled out as it may require different management.

A liver biopsy done via the transjugular route because of coagulopathy is not usually necessary, other than in occasional malignancies. As the evaluation continues, several important decisions have to be made; such as whether to admit the patient to an ICU, or whether to transfer the patient to a transplant facility. Consultation with the transplant center as early as possible is critical due to the possibility of rapid progression of ALF.

===Definition===

Acute liver failure is defined as &quot;the rapid development of hepatocellular dysfunction, specifically coagulopathy and mental status changes (encephalopathy) in a patient without known prior liver disease&quot;.page 1557

The diagnosis of acute liver failure is based on physical exam, laboratory findings, patient history, and past medical history to establish mental status changes, coagulopathy, rapidity of onset, and absence of known prior liver disease respectively.page 1557

The exact definition of &quot;rapid&quot; is somewhat questionable, and different sub-divisions exist which are based on the time from onset of first hepatic symptoms to onset of encephalopathy. One scheme defines &quot;acute hepatic failure&quot; as the development of encephalopathy within 26 weeks of the onset of any hepatic symptoms. This is sub-divided into &quot;fulminant hepatic failure&quot;, which requires onset of encephalopathy within 8 weeks, and &quot;subfulminant&quot;, which describes onset of encephalopathy after 8 weeks but before 26 weeks. Another scheme defines &quot;hyperacute&quot; as onset within 7 days, &quot;acute&quot; as onset between 7 and 28 days, and &quot;subacute&quot; as onset between 28 days and 24 weeks.page 1557

==Treatment==

=== General concerns ===
Because ALF often involves the rapid deterioration of mental status and the potential for multiorgan failure, patients should be managed in the intensive care unit. For patients not at a transplant center, the possibility of rapid progression of ALF makes early consultation with a transplant facility critical. Accordingly, plans for transfer to a transplant center should begin in patients with any abnormal mentation. Early institution of antidotes or specific therapy may prevent the need for liver transplantation and reduce the likelihood of poor outcome. Measures appropriate for specific causes of ALF are described in detail later in this chapter.

=== Neurologic complications ===
Patients with grade I–II encephalopathy should be transferred to a liver transplant facility and listed for transplantation. Consider a brain computed tomography (CT) scan to rule out other causes of altered or impaired mental status. Stimulation and overhydration can cause elevations in intracranial pressure (ICP) and should be avoided. Unmanageable agitation may be treated with short-acting benzodiazepines in small doses. Lactulose can be considered at this stage. A preliminary report from the ALFSG on 117 patients suggests that use of lactulose in the first 7 days after diagnosis is associated with a small increase in survival time, but with no difference in severity of encephalopathy or in the overall outcome. For patients who progress to grade III–IV encephalopathy, intubation for airway protection is generally required. Many centers use propofol for sedation because it may reduce cerebral blood. The head of the bed should be elevated to 30 degrees, and electrolytes, blood gasses, glucose, and neurologic status monitored frequently.

=== Cardiovascular complications ===
Increased cardiac output and low systemic vascular resistance are characteristic of ALF. Pulmonary artery catheterization should be considered. Hypotension should be treated preferentially with fluids, but systemic vasopressor support with agents such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or dopamine should be used if fluid replacement fails to maintain mean arterial pressure of 50–60 mm Hg. Vasoconstrictive agents (especially vasopressin) should be avoided.

=== Pulmonary complications ===
Pulmonary edema and pulmonary infections are commonly seen in patients with ALF. Mechanical ventilation may be required. However, positive end-expiratory pressure can worsen cerebral edema.

=== Coagulopathy and gastrointestinal bleeding ===
Impaired liver synthesis of clotting factors, low-grade fibrinolysis, and intravascular coagulation are typical of ALF. Thrombocytopenia is common and may also be dysfunctional. Replacement therapy is recommended only in the setting of bleeding or prior to an invasive procedure. Vitamin K can be given to treat an abnormal prothrombin time, regardless of whether there is poor nutritional status. Administration of recombinant factor VIIa has shown promise; however, this treatment approach requires further study. The use of gastrointestinal hemorrhage prophylaxis with a histamine-2 (H2) blocker, proton pump inhibitor, or sucralfate is recommended.

=== Nutrition, electrolytes, and metabolic derangements ===
In patients with grade I or II encephalopathy, enteral feeding should be initiated early. Parenteral nutrition should be used only if enteral feeding is contraindicated as it increases the risk of infection. Severe restriction of protein is not beneficial; 60 g/day of protein is generally reasonable. Fluid replacement with colloid (e.g. albumin) is preferred rather than crystalloid (e.g. saline); all solutions should contain dextrose to maintain euglycemia. Multiple electrolyte abnormalities are common in ALF. Correction of hypokalemia is essential as hypokalemia increases the kidneys&#x27; ammonia production, potentially exacerbating encephalopathy. Hypophosphatemia is especially common in patients with acetaminophen-induced ALF and in those with intact renal function. Hypoglycemia occurs in many patients with ALF and is often due to depletion of hepatic glycogen stores and impaired gluconeogenesis. Plasma glucose concentration should be monitored and hypertonic glucose administered as needed.

=== Infection ===
Bacterial and fungal infections are common in ALF, with one study demonstrating culture-proven infection in 80% of ALF patients. Defective cellular and humoral immunity as well as presence of indwelling catheters, coma, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and medications that suppress immunity all predispose to infection. Localizing symptoms of infection such as fever and sputum production are frequently absent and the only clues to an underlying infectious process may be worsening of encephalopathy or renal function. There must be a low threshold for obtaining frequent cultures (blood, urine, and sputum), chest radiographs, and paracentesis. Bacteria that enter through the skin, such as streptococci and staphylococci, tend to predominate. Aggressive surveillance is essential as prophylactic antibiotics have shown little benefit. Fungal infections, particularly in the setting of broad-spectrum antibiotics, are also common, and disseminated fungemia is a poor prognostic sign.

=== Liver transplantation ===
The advent of transplantation has changed survival from as low as 15% in the pretransplant era to more than 60% today. Liver transplantation is indicated for many patients with ALF, and survival rates of 56–90% can be achieved. In addition to transplantation, better critical care and the trend toward more benign causes, such as acetaminophen, all contribute to improved survival rates. Spontaneous survival is now around 40%. The application of transplantation among patients with ALF remains low, suggesting that the full potential of this modality may not be realized. Timely availability of an allograft is one of the major factors determining transplant outcomes. In the largest U.S. study, only 29% of patients received a liver graft, while 10% of the overall group (one fourth of patients listed for transplantation) died on the waiting list. Other series have reported death rates of those listed for transplant as high as 40%.
In the ALFSG, the transplantation rate was higher in the groups with lower short-term spontaneous survival, making overall survival similar in all groups: acetaminophen, 73%; drug induced, 70%; indeterminate group, 64%; and other causes, 61%. Causes of death for the 101 patients who died within the 3-week period included cerebral edema, multiorgan failure, sepsis, cardiac arrhythmia or arrest and respiratory failure. The median time to death after admission was 5 days.

===Acetylcysteine===

Intravenous N-acetylcysteine has been found to be beneficial in acetaminophen toxicity but not in non-acetaminophen-related acute liver failure.

== Prognosis ==

Historically mortality has been high, being in excess of 80%. In recent years the advent of liver transplantation and multidisciplinary intensive care support have improved survival significantly. At present overall short-term survival with transplant is more than 65%.

Several prognostic scoring systems have been devised to predict mortality and to identify who will require an early liver transplant. These include King&#x27;s College Hospital criteria, MELD score, and Clichy criteria.

== Terminology ==

To date, no universally accepted nomenclature has been adopted. Trey and Davidson introduced the phrase &quot;fulminant hepatic failure&quot; in 1970, which they described as a &quot;... potentially reversible condition, the consequence of severe liver injury, with an onset of encephalopathy within 8 weeks of the appearance of the first symptoms and in the absence of pre-existing liver disease&quot;. Later, it was suggested that the term &quot;fulminant&quot; should be confined to patients who develop jaundice to encephalopathy within 2 weeks. Phrases &quot;subfulminant&quot; hepatic failure and &quot;late onset &quot;hepatic failure were coined for onset between 2 weeks to 3 months and for 8 weeks to 24 weeks, respectively. The &quot;umbrella phrase&quot; of acute liver failure was proposed by King&#x27;s College group, which has been adopted in this article. Paradoxically, in this classification, the best prognosis is in the &quot;hyperacute&quot; group.

<text>Pierre-Charles-Alexandre Louis (14 April 178722 August 1872) was a French physician, clinician and pathologist known for his studies on tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and pneumonia, but Louis&#x27;s greatest contribution to medicine was the development of the &quot;numerical method&quot;, forerunner to epidemiology and the modern clinical trial, paving the path for evidence-based medicine.

==Biography==
Louis was born in Ay, Champagne, the son of a wine merchant. He grew up during the French Revolution and initially thought to study law, later switching to medicine, graduating in 1813. His initial studies were in Reims, but he completed them in Paris.

Louis married late in life, having a single son (Armand) who died of tuberculosis while still a boy in 1854, and Louis retired from medical practice the same year. The American politician Charles Sumner, who visited Louis and observed him teaching at the Hôtel-Dieu de Paris, described him as &quot;a tall man, with a countenance that seems quite passive.&quot; Louis also taught at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, also in Paris, and counted Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. as one of his students.

==Training==
After graduation, Louis accompanied the Compte de Saint-Priest, a family friend, to Russia, travelling with the Compte for several years before settling in the Ukrainian city of Odessa in 1816. He maintained a successful private practice for four years, receiving the honorary title of physician from the Tsar. However, in 1820 an outbreak of diphtheria forced him to recognize the inadequacy of his medical knowledge. He returned to Paris where he worked, initially without pay, at a hospital for seven years, collecting the case histories of thousands of patients and performing hundreds of autopsies. He eventually wrote studies on the treatment of tuberculosis and typhoid fever, and produced the &quot;numerical method&quot; for evaluating the effectiveness of therapies.

==Numerical method==
Starting in 1823, Louis began publishing the results of his research on a variety of topics, numerically analyzing information gathered from his case studies and autopsies.

In the 19th century, an influential theory was proposed by French physician François-Joseph-Victor Broussais, that fevers were the result of inflammation of the organs, and bloodletting was an effective treatment for any fever. Louis disagreed, publishing a paper in 1828 to that fact (expanded in 1834 to a book-length treatise in the &quot;American Journal of the Medical Sciences&quot; entitled &quot;An essay on clinical instruction&quot;), which demonstrated that the use of bloodletting for pneumonia was ineffective. Louis&#x27; approach was strongly resisted by doctors at the time, who were unwilling to wait for tests to determine if current treatments were effective, or discard treatments if they were found ineffective. Gradually Louis&#x27; methods gained acceptance as doctors began recognizing the &quot;numerical method&quot; added objectivity to treatment approaches and improved outcomes. The &quot;numerical method&quot; involved the use of averages of groups of patients with the same illness to determine what should be done with individual cases of that illness. As part of the study, Louis emphasized the importance of the similarity of patients beyond mere disease, and attempted to account for factors such as age of patients in different treatment groups, diet, severity of illness and other treatments used beyond bloodletting. Louis also emphasized the importance of population (rather than individual) comparisons in the belief that differences between individual patients would &quot;average out&quot; in the group, though he failed to grasp the importance of randomization to ensure this. Opponents argued that individual cases were too diverse to be combined into statistically average groups; Louis responded by pointing out even individual cases have commonalities, and by claiming each case is unique, no progress could ever be made within medicine. Louis acknowledged his own research included too few cases for absolute certainty in the treatment methods, and his student later stated that once a total of 500 cases had been accumulated, then certainty could be reached.

Louis&#x27; first study of the topic was of the use of bloodletting in pneumonia, selecting 77 patients with a very similar form of pneumonia. After determining the timing of onset, duration and frequency of death rates of the disease, Louis then analyzed the timing of the bloodletting as either early (1–4 days since the start of the illness) or late (5–9 days). Based on these patients, Louis found that those who were bled early recovered earlier than those bled late, but also died at greater rates. Based on his findings, Louis concluded bloodletting was only a valid use in the late stages of disease. The ultimate impact of Louis&#x27; studies on the practice of medicine is hard to evaluate, as the practice of bloodletting was already beginning to decline when he published his results.

Little is known of Louis&#x27; training in math or medicine, or how he developed his &quot;numerical method&quot;. At the time of his practice, the mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace was extremely influential and had introduced the concept of correlation as a component of science; Louis may have drawn upon these concepts during his studies.

==Legacy==
Louis conducted other, similar pre-epidemiological work, dividing patients into exposed/affected versus unexposed/unaffected groups to determine similar relationships between illness and etiology, deducting for instance the heritable nature of emphysema. For his work on the numerical method, Louis was elected the president in perpetuity of the Society for Medical Observation, a society formed by his students. Louis is also credited by some for standardizing the patient history, starting with questions about general health and narrowing down to specific symptoms. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1849.

Louis was mentor to Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. during the younger man&#x27;s training in Paris and strongly influenced his skeptical outlook.

<text>The Staffordshire Potteries is the industrial area encompassing the six towns Burslem, Fenton, Hanley, Longton, Tunstall and Stoke (which is now the city of Stoke-on-Trent) in Staffordshire, England. North Staffordshire became a centre of ceramic production in the early 17th century, due to the local availability of clay, salt, lead and coal.

==Spread==
Hundreds of companies produced all kinds of pottery, from tablewares and decorative pieces to industrial items. The main pottery types of earthenware, stoneware and porcelain were all made in large quantities, and the Staffordshire industry was a major innovator in developing new varieties of ceramic bodies such as bone china and jasperware, as well as pioneering transfer printing and other glazing and decorating techniques. In general Staffordshire was strongest in the middle and low price ranges, though the finest and most expensive types of wares were also made.

By the late 18th century North Staffordshire was the largest producer of ceramics in Britain, despite significant centres elsewhere, and relied heavily on child labor throughout the production process. Large export markets took Staffordshire pottery around the world, especially in the 19th century. Production began to decline in the late 19th century, as other countries developed their industries. After World War II it declined steeply. Production continues in the area, but at a small fraction of the levels at the peak of the industry.

==History==
The boom came after the discovery in 1720 by potter John Astbury of Shelton, that by adding heated and ground flint powder to the local reddish clay he could create a more palatable white or Creamware. The flint was sourced from either the South Coast of England or France, then shipped to the Port of Liverpool or to Shardlow on the River Trent. After shipping by pack horses to the watermills local to the potteries, or to commercial flint grinding mills in either the Churnet Valley or Moddershall Valley, it was sorted to remove flint that had reddish hues, then heated to to create an easily ground product. A group involving James Brindley later patented a water-based process that reduced the generation of fine siliceous dust, lessening workers&#x27; risk of developing silicosis. In the early 1900s the process was converted to grinding bone, which had a similar effect.

With the coming of pottery products distribution by railway that began in the 1840s, mainly by the London and North Western Railway and Midland Railway, there was a considerable increase in business.

Potteries active in the 19th century include Spode, Aynsley, Burleigh, Doulton, Dudson, Mintons, Moorcroft, Davenport, Twyford, and Wedgwood.

The Chartist 1842 General Strike was ignited by striking miners at collieries in the Potteries, and led to the 1842 Pottery Riots.

==Heron Cross Pottery==

William Hines and his brother Thomas Hines established the pottery firm Hines Brothers in Fenton, Stoke-on-Trent and built Heron Cross Pottery in 1886, particularly making the classic brown earthenware teapots and tea services for the London Midland and Scottish Railway. The business was taken over in 1907 and became the Kensington Pottery in Hanley in about 1922: this pottery continued until 1937.

It is understood that in about 1850 William Hines was born either in Ellesmere, Shropshire or in St Oswalds, Welsh Marches. He married Mary Mellor on 10 March 1875 and remarried when she died (reportedly not until the evening of his marriage telling his second wife that he already had six children). He became a prominent rider in the North Staffordshire Hunt and owner of a stable of horses. He spent considerable money building Wesleyan chapels. There is a Hines Street in Fenton.

<doc id="1226279" wikidata="Q4567526" url="?curid=1226279" title="1952 Republican National Convention">
<text>The 1952 Republican National Convention was held at the International Amphitheatre in Chicago, Illinois from July 7 to 11, 1952, and nominated Dwight D. Eisenhower of New York, nicknamed &quot;Ike&quot;, for president and Richard M. Nixon of California for vice president.

The Republican platform pledged to end the unpopular war in Korea, supported the development of nuclear weapons as a deterrence strategy, to fire all &quot;the loafers, incompetents and unnecessary employees&quot; at the State Department, condemned the Roosevelt and Truman administrations&#x27; economic policies, supported retention of the Taft–Hartley Act, opposed &quot;discrimination against race, religion or national origin&quot;, supported &quot;Federal action toward the elimination of lynching&quot;, and pledged to bring an end to communist subversion in the United States.

== Keynote speech ==

The keynote speech was delivered by MacArthur, who had become a hero to Republicans after President Truman relieved him of command in 1951 because of their disagreement about how to prosecute the Korean War, and had hopes of obtaining the presidential nomination. In his address, MacArthur condemned the Truman administration for America&#x27;s perceived loss of status on the international stage, including criticism of the Yalta Conference and the administration&#x27;s handling of the war in Korea. MacArthur also criticized Truman on the domestic front, blaming his administration for wages that failed to keep pace with post-World War II inflation.

The speech was not well received, and did nothing to aid MacArthur&#x27;s presidential campaign. He curtailed his post-convention speeches and remained out of the public eye until after the election.

* Representative Thomas H. Werdel of California
* Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon
The contest for the presidential nomination was expected to be a battle between the party&#x27;s moderate to liberal and conservative wings. Moderate and liberal Republicans (the &quot;Eastern Establishment&quot;), led by New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey, the party&#x27;s unsuccessful presidential nominee in 1944 and 1948, were largely supporters of Eisenhower or Warren. The conservative wing was led by Taft, who had unsuccessfully tried for the presidential nomination in 1940 and 1948.

In a pre-convention fight over the seating of delegates, Eisenhower supporters charged the Taft campaign with improperly seeking to obtain delegates from Texas, Georgia and Louisiana, states that were part of the Democratic Party&#x27;s &quot;Solid South&quot; where Republicans had little or no organization because they traditionally did not do well in general elections. The Taft-dominated Republican National Committee supported Taft in the dispute. When delegate committees met to consider the issue before the convention convened, they sustained Eisenhower&#x27;s position. Stripped of 42 delegates from the disputed states, Taft&#x27;s backers realized their chances of beating Eisenhower were slim.

In his remarks during the delegate fight, Taft supporter Everett Dirksen harshly criticized Dewey and the moderate to liberal wing of the party, which had dominated it since 1940. In describing the party&#x27;s failed presidential campaigns of 1940, 1944 and 1948, he pointed at Dewey, who was seated with the New York delegation, and shouted &quot;We followed you before and you took us down the road to defeat!&quot; Dirksen&#x27;s condemnation of Dewey touched off sustained anti-Dewey and pro-Taft demonstrations.

Dirksen nominated Taft. Eisenhower was nominated by Maryland Governor Theodore McKeldin, who made obvious overtures to the conservative wing by mentioning Eisenhower&#x27;s Midwestern Kansas roots and the fact that he had begun attendance at the United States Military Academy during the presidential administration of Robert Taft&#x27;s father, William Howard Taft. McKeldin described Eisenhower&#x27;s career at the highest levels of the military as evidence that he was able to assume the responsibilities of the presidency immediately and his international renown as an asset that would enable the party to unify its disparate wings and make inroads among Democratic and independent voters. McKeldin&#x27;s nomination was seconded by Kansas Governor Edward F. Arn, Oregon Republican Party Chairman Robert B. Elliott, Mrs. Alberta Green, a delegate from West Plains, Missouri, and Hobson R. Reynolds, an African American funeral director, state legislator from Philadelphia, and Director of the Civil Liberties Department of the Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks of the World.

After the nominations were completed, including speeches on behalf of Earl Warren, Harold Stassen, and Douglas MacArthur, the delegates proceeded to vote. After the first ballot, Eisenhower had 595 votes, nine short of the 604 required for the nomination, while Taft was a strong second with 500: Warren had 81, Stassen 20, and MacArthur 10. 

Warren&#x27;s backers refused to change their votes to Eisenhower because they still hoped for a deadlock that might enable Warren to obtain the nomination as a compromise choice. Stassen had not received 10% of the vote, which freed his home state of Minnesota&#x27;s delegates from their pledge to support him: all but one of the Stassen delegates, led by Warren E. Burger, then changed their votes to Eisenhower, giving him 614 votes and securing him the presidential nomination. After other delegations switched to Eisenhower, the revised first ballot total was:


Presidential Balloting / 5th Day of Convention (July 11, 1952)
After the revised totals were announced, Taft and Warren supporters moved to unanimously nominate Eisenhower, which the delegates did. As soon as Eisenhower was nominated, he visited Taft personally to request his endorsement and obtain a promise that Taft would support the Republican ticket. Taft immediately agreed, and loyally backed Eisenhower during the general election campaign.

== Vice Presidential nomination ==
=== Vice presidential candidates ===


Senator Richard M. Nixon&#x27;s speech at a state Republican Party fundraiser in New York City on May 8, 1952, impressed Governor Thomas E. Dewey, who was an Eisenhower supporter and had formed a pro-Eisenhower delegation from New York to attend the national convention. In a private meeting after the speech, Dewey suggested to Nixon that he would make a suitable vice presidential candidate on the ticket with Eisenhower.
Nixon attended the convention as a delegate pledged to Earl Warren and represented California on the convention&#x27;s platform committee. In pre-convention remarks to reporters, Nixon touted Warren as the most prominent dark horse and suggested that if Warren was not the presidential nominee, Nixon&#x27;s Senate colleague William Knowland would be a good choice for vice president. As the convention proceedings continued, Warren became concerned that Nixon was working for Eisenhower while ostensibly pledged to Warren. Warren asked Paul H. Davis of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, who had been a vice president at Columbia University while Eisenhower was the school&#x27;s president, to tell Eisenhower that Warren resented such actions and wanted them to stop. Eisenhower informed Davis that he did not oppose Warren, because if Taft and Eisenhower deadlocked, then Warren would be his first choice for the nomination. In the same conversation, Eisenhower indicated that if he won the nomination, Nixon would be his first choice for the vice presidency, because Eisenhower believed the party needed to promote leaders who were aggressive, capable, and young. Eisenhower later developed a list of seven potential candidates, with Nixon&#x27;s name at the top.

After Eisenhower was nominated, his key supporters met to discuss vice presidential possibilities. Eisenhower informed the group&#x27;s chairman, Herbert Brownell Jr. that he did not wish to appear to dictate to the convention by formally sponsoring a single candidate, so the group reviewed several, including Taft, Everett Dirksen, and Alfred E. Driscoll, all of whom they quickly rejected. Dewey then raised Nixon&#x27;s name; the group quickly concurred. Brownell checked with Eisenhower, who indicated his approval. Brownell then called Nixon to inform him that he was Eisenhower&#x27;s choice. Nixon accepted, then departed for Eisenhower&#x27;s hotel room to discuss the details of the campaign and Eisenhower&#x27;s plans for his vice president if the ticket was successful in the general election.

A group of women delegates (led by former congresswoman Clare Boothe Luce) sought to nominate Senator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, but Smith requested that her name not be used. Noting that Eisenhower&#x27;s supporters had coalesced around Nixon, Luce withdrew her nomination of Smith.

The delegates soon assembled to formalize the selection. Nixon asked Knowland to nominate him, and Knowland agreed. After Taft supporter John W. Bricker declined Nixon&#x27;s request to second the nomination, Driscoll agreed to do so. There were no other candidates, and Nixon was nominated by acclamation.

== Television coverage ==
The 1952 Republican convention was the first political convention to be televised live, coast-to-coast. Experiments in regionally broadcasting conventions took place during the Republican and Democratic conventions in 1948; however, 1952 was the first year in which networks carried nationwide coverage of political conventions. Fixed cameras were placed at the back and the sides of the International Amphitheatre for the press to use collectively. None of these offered a straight shot of the podium on stage, so many networks supplemented their coverage with shots from their own portable cameras.

The impact of the Republican Convention broadcast was an immediate one. After carefully watching the Republican Convention, the Democratic Party made last-minute alterations to their convention held in the same venue to make their broadcast more appealing to television audiences. They constructed a tower in the center of the convention hall to allow for a better shot of the podium, and Democrats exercised more control over camera shots and the conduct of delegates in front of the cameras.

By 1956, the effect of television further affected both the Republican and Democratic conventions. Conventions were compacted in length, with daytime sessions being largely eliminated and the amount of welcoming speeches and parliamentary organization speeches being decreased (such as seconding speeches for vice-presidential candidates, which were eliminated). Additionally, conventions were given overlying campaign themes, and their sessions were scheduled in order to maximize exposure to prime-time audience. To provide a more telegenic broadcast, convention halls were decked out in banners and other decorations, and television cameras were positioned at more flattering angles.

<doc id="1226281" wikidata="Q42820" url="?curid=1226281" title="Ligurian Sea">
<text>The Ligurian Sea is an arm of the Mediterranean Sea. It lies between the Italian Riviera (Liguria) and the island of Corsica. The sea is thought to have been named after the ancient Ligures people.

== Geography ==
The sea borders Italy as far as its border with France, and the French island of Corsica. In the east, the sea borders the Tyrrhenian Sea, while in the west it borders the Mediterranean Sea proper. Genoa is the most prominent city in the area. The northwest coast is noted for its scenery and climate.

The Gulf of Genoa is its northernmost part. The ports of Genoa and La Spezia are on its rocky coast. It reaches a maximum depth of more than northwest of Corsica.

According to a 1983 study, since 1977 a series of experimental analyses on sea-level variations at Genoa and Imperia highlighted &quot;the existence of a seiche wave with a mean period of 5.8 hours&quot;, whose reasons weren&#x27;t yet explained at that time. The Ligurian Sea was modeled as a rectangular semi-closed basin with a longitudinal length of and a transversal one of , in an average constant depth of .

=== Extent ===
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Ligurian Sea as follows:

&quot;On the Southwest.&quot; A line joining Cape Corse (Cape Grosso, 9°23′E) the Northern point of Corsica to the frontier between France and Italy (7°31′E).

&quot;On the Southeast.&quot;
A line joining Cape Corse with Tinetto Island () and thence through Tino and Palmaria Islands to San Pietro Point () on the Coast of Italy.

&quot;On the North&quot; The Ligurian Coast of Italy.
== Flowings ==
The Ligurian Sea is attraversed by the Modified Atlantic Water (MAW) on its surface and by the Levantine Intermediate Water in depth. It is also brushed by the two main currents which surround the Corsica island: the Western Corsica Current and the Tyrrenian current that reaches the Corsica Channel.

== Conservation ==
In order to provide protection for the numerous cetacean (whales and dolphins; porpoises are not found in this part of the Mediterranean Sea) species in the Ligurian Sea the bordering countries established the sea as a SPAMI in 1999. The International Ligurian Sea Cetacean Sanctuary now covers covering territorial waters as well as high sea.

<text>The Jupiter and Lake Worth Railway was a narrow gauge railway with a connection between the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway system in Florida. It connected the Lake Worth Lagoon at Juno to the Jupiter Inlet at Jupiter. With intermediate stops at Venus and Mars, the railroad was often called the Celestial Railroad, with the first use of that name appearing in the March 1893 issue of Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine in an article written by Julian Ralph. A report published by the town of Jupiter in 2012 noted that Mars and Venus &quot;were not much more than loading platforms.&quot;

The purpose of the railroad was to link the Lake Worth and Jupiter inlets, both of which had Plant System steamboat lines. The Indian River Steamboat Company went north through the Jupiter Inlet and connected waterways (now part of the Intracoastal Waterway) to Titusville. There were no turning tracks, so the locomotives always pointed towards Juno, forcing trains making the return trip to go in reverse. Fare was rather high for the time, being , a maximum total of 75 cents. Those who rode on the Jupiter and Lake Worth Railway recalled that the conductor would occasionally stop the train to allow passengers to pick flowers or hunt wild turkeys.

Henry Flagler, the owner of the Florida East Coast Railway, rejected the high price, instead building his own line to the west. The new railroad was finished in February 1894, and the Jupiter and Lake Worth Railway was gone by June 1896.

Eventually, a canal was dug between the two waterways that the railroad connected; this is now part of the Intracoastal Waterway.

Part of the right-of-way was used for the current alignment of U.S. 1 (SR 5), built in 1956; the rest was abandoned and has been mostly redeveloped.

<text>CKLN-FM was a community radio station based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

From 1983 to 2011, CKLN Radio Inc. was licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission as a campus-community FM radio station affiliated with Ryerson University, and broadcast at 88.1 MHz on the FM dial with the call sign CKLN-FM. It ceased FM broadcasting on April 15, 2011, after its licence was revoked on January 28, 2011 and continued as an internet radio outlet until it ceased operations on December 26, 2011.

In its final months, most of the internet broadcaster&#x27;s programs were produced in the Regent Park neighbourhood of Toronto. After CKLN was officially dissolved as an organization, its remaining resources and volunteers were transferred to Regent Park Focus Youth Media Arts Centre, which launched Radio Regent, a new Internet radio operation, in early 2012. After a round of licence hearings on new applications for CKLN&#x27;s old frequency, the CRTC awarded the licence to Rock 95 Broadcasting, which launched CIND-FM under the name Indie 88 in September 2012, while a new campus radio station for Ryerson University was launched as CJRU in 2016.

==History==
CKLN began as a closed circuit station set up in 1970 as Ryerson Community Radio, its broadcasts piped to loudspeakers around campus. In 1972, it became independent of Ryerson&#x27;s Radio and Television Arts department and adopted the call letters CRFM. In 1978, the station adopted the call letters CKLN and was broadcast through campus via closed circuit cable. It was licensed as an over the air FM broadcaster by the CRTC in 1983 as a Ryerson University-based campus-community radio station and assigned the frequency of 88.1 MHz on the FM band and allowed to retain the CKLN call letters. Ryerson had announced that it would close its earlier radio station, CJRT-FM, in 1973 due to financial constraints; that station was saved in 1974 by the Ontario government headed by Bill Davis in 1974 as a government funded public radio station without formal ties to Ryerson.

Among CKLN&#x27;s early accomplishments was the launch of Ron Nelson&#x27;s new show &quot;The Fantastic Voyage&quot; in 1983, Canada&#x27;s first radio show devoted to Rap. The program was influential in promoting and developing many of Canada&#x27;s early hip hop stars. According to poet Clifton Joseph, the show was &quot;the single most important agent responsible for the breaking of rap music in Toronto and laying the groundwork for the emergence of Canadian rap artists such as Michie Mee and Maestro Fresh Wes.&quot;

Other artists such as Blue Rodeo and k.d. lang received airplay on CKLN prior to being picked up by mainstream radio. The &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; says of the station that &quot;it sat at the forefront of independent music and radical politics in the city for more than three decades, working with a shoe-string budget, and yet it somehow always managed to survive.&quot;

In the 1980s, the station helped create a news service to share content among left-wing stations worldwide including those run by the African National Congress and the FMLN in El Salvador. The station aired live coverage of the release of Nelson Mandela from prison.

CKLN was the first broadcast outlet to air Toronto&#x27;s Gay Pride Day Parade.

In its coverage of the Rwandan genocide, CKLN aired an investigation of the colonial history behind the events.

In 1985, the station was estimated to have 50,000 weekly listeners. By 1991, its audience had grown to an estimated 140,000 listeners a week. In 1989, The Toronto Star voted CKLN as &quot;best radio station&quot; in its annual Sammy awards. In April 1992, one student successfully petitioned for a referendum to decide if the station should continue to receive student funding; CKLN won the referendum.

Former station manager Adam Vaughan, later a Member of Parliament, said in a 2015 interview that &quot;What was great about CKLN is that it combined the strength of Ryerson with the diversity of Toronto... The diversity of the city and the diversity of the voices and the culture on air came to define CKLN and it was a huge part of our success.&quot; He added, however, that &quot;The station, after I left, got very heavily invested in identity politics. And instead of bringing diversity together, groups kind of started to fight with each other and it was hugely problematic in terms of trying to unify an audience... You could see the station drifting further and further away from a position of strength and experimentation into bitterness and at times, straight up incompetency.&quot;

By September 2003, following the departure of station manager Conrad Collaco, CKLN was teetering on the brink of insolvency. As a result, the Ryerson Students&#x27; Union bailed out CKLN of $110,000 in debts. An earlier proposal by Collaco to deal with the station&#x27;s financial problems with a $6 increase to the student levy was not approved by the student government which cited various issues such as the lack of audited statements, the lack of airtime for Ryerson students or acknowledgment of Ryerson on the air.

In August 2005, CKLN shifted its broadcast studios from the basement of Jorgenson Hall at Ryerson University to the second floor of the newly constructed Ryerson Student Campus Centre.

==Internal conflict and loss of licence==
In November 2007, CKLN&#x27;s board appointed board member Mike Phillips as interim station manager. It had been over four years since the position had been filled. On December 21, 2007, CKLN program director Tim May resigned &quot;suddenly and questionably&quot; and within days CKLN&#x27;s board appointed board member Tony Barnes as interim program director without first advertising the post. The new hires, and the manner in which the hirings were carried out, proved unpopular with some and resulted in a special general meeting being called, which was attended by over 150 members, more than 90% of whom voted to impeach the board of directors. The management and board of CKLN viewed the Special General Meeting as illegitimate along with the impeachment vote and subsequently dismissed several dozen volunteer programmers as well as two paid staff, including the station&#x27;s news director, who was allegedly told she was being fired for not seeing &quot;eye to eye&quot; with the board. Station manager Mike Phillips claimed that members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees and Ontario Coalition Against Poverty had stacked the February meeting and defended the dismissal of volunteer programmers by arguing, &quot;If you have people decrying the station that is allowing them to go on the air, and breaking CRTC rules in the process, that can&#x27;t be allowed to go on for very long.&quot;

For a time, the station had two rival boards of directors, both claiming to be the legitimate management. The first board, which hired Barnes and Phillips, was chaired by Josie Miner while a second board led by Arnold Minors was elected by opponents of the first board. The Ryerson Students&#x27; Union, which administered a student fee that, at the time, provided the station with 60 per cent of its budget, withheld funds until the conflict between the two rival boards was resolved. Responding to this action, the first board initiated a statement of claim in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice naming the RSU and Ryerson University as defendants.

With CKLN&#x27;s financial situation deteriorating due to the RSU&#x27;s withholding of funds, and with members of the first board fighting among themselves, on February 28, 2009, CKLN&#x27;s studios were made inaccessible except to a faction on the first CKLN board and those they chose to admit. Live programming was suspended and previously aired material was repeated in its place.

On March 1, 2009, two individuals, Paulette Hamilton, one of the members of the first board who had been locked out the previous day, and Daibhid James, a programmer, were arrested after they &quot;barricaded themselves into the radio station&#x27;s studios.&quot; Ryerson University president Sheldon Levy reacted to the incident by stating that &quot;I think they&#x27;ve overstayed their welcome if that&#x27;s the welcome that we have on our property. I don&#x27;t like it, I don&#x27;t want it, and we don&#x27;t need it here.&quot;

Later that month, the Ryerson Student Centre board voted unanimously to close the station until both sides of the dispute could negotiate CKLN&#x27;s future. The Palin Foundation, which governs the student centre, consists of representatives of Ryerson University, the Ryerson Students&#x27; Union and the Continuing Education Students&#x27; Association of Ryerson (CESAR).

During the period of the lockout, which lasted until mid-September 2009, CKLN broadcast unattended loops of previously aired programs, jazz and pre-recorded speeches. Dead air was heard for sometimes weeks at a time. In June 2009, CKLN&#x27;s broadcast antenna was damaged resulting in the signal strength being drastically reduced. CKLN&#x27;s online stream was still operational through this period.

On July 9, 2009, in a statement by Chris McNeil, president of CESAR and chair of the Palin Foundation, CKLN was provided a deadline of July 24, 2009 for the station to elect a new board of directors or risk eviction. The July 24, 2009 meeting and elections were held, but became the subject of a legal action filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice Commercial Court by former CKLN board member Mary Young claiming it was &quot;improper and illegal&quot;. On December 14, 2011, the legal action against CKLN was permanently stayed and a motion by Young to launch a derivative action was dismissed with Young ordered to pay CKLN $10,000 in costs.

==Licence revocation==
Even before CKLN resumed scheduled programming in late September 2009, the CRTC expressed concerns over the station&#x27;s inability to comply with licence requirements during the dispute, such as playing the aforementioned loop for several months in 2009, its failure to properly submit on-air logger tapes, program logs and complete annual financial returns since 2007, and that the CRTC licence for CKLN had been transferred to a third party without authorization.

In March 2010, the CRTC called CKLN to a hearing for May 12, 2010 in which the licensee was to &quot;...show cause why the Commission should not take steps to suspend or revoke the broadcasting licence in question or why the Commission should not issue mandatory orders requiring the licensee to comply with the Regulations and its conditions of licence...&quot; The hearing was postponed in part due to ongoing mediation efforts in the aforementioned Mary Young case. The CRTC made it clear soon after the postponement that CKLN would be called to a hearing by no later than the end of 2010. During this period, the CRTC required the station to file monthly progress reports on its efforts to improve its licensing compliance.

The CRTC called CKLN to a hearing that took place in Toronto over a two-day period beginning December 8, 2010.

On January 28, 2011, the CRTC revoked the licence of CKLN-FM due to continual breaches of the Broadcast Act and violations to their conditions of licence, ordering them to cease broadcasting by February 12, 2011.

Calling the decision &quot;premature, disproportionate and inequitable&quot;, CRTC Commissioner Louise Poirier issued a dissenting opinion stating that she was &quot;firmly opposed&quot; to the decision and that licence revocation &quot;should not have been used as a first step for this station&quot;; according to Poirier, &quot;the Commission has never revoked a licence without first issuing a mandatory order or reducing the licence term.&quot; The decision was also opposed by the National Campus and Community Radio Association, which stated in a press release that the commission &quot;could have taken other reasonable steps to ensure regulatory compliance while allowing CKLN to continue serving the community&quot;.

CKLN has stated that most of its regulatory failures were committed by former staff who were no longer with the station. CKLN appealed the decision to the Federal Court of Appeal. On February 11, the station was granted a temporary stay, allowing it to remain on the air pending the Federal Court&#x27;s decision on whether or not to grant the station leave to appeal the CRTC&#x27;s order.

On April 15, 2011, the Federal Court of Appeal announced that it would not be hearing the appeal and said the station must cease broadcasting on 88.1 FM immediately. CKLN continued broadcasting and podcasting via the internet as its exclusive outlet from that point.

==Reaction to loss of licence==
CKLN station manager Jacky Tuinstra-Harrison said that the CRTC failed to follow its own policy of graduated discipline: &quot;The CRTC could have followed their own policy, but did not; they did not pursue avenues such as warnings, fines, mandatory orders or other options against CKLN, but moved directly to the most serious of measures- revocation. We were not at any point offered alternatives&quot; and that the claim that &quot;CKLN&#x27;s &#x27;demise&#x27; could have been avoided is an admonishment, which could have been made to any of the last six CKLN boards&quot;.

On April 18, 2011, in his inaugural television broadcast on Canada&#x27;s Sun News Network, as well as his column in the Sun Media newspaper chain, conservative commentator Ezra Levant claimed that the CRTC&#x27;s decision on CKLN was just another oppressive example of arbitrary government bureaucracy and interference into the lives and businesses of ordinary Canadians.

Toronto city councillor Adam Vaughan said: &quot;It&#x27;s just astonishing that the CRTC can do this to a station that&#x27;s been true to its mandate, that&#x27;s sustained its commitment to community-based programming, the damage it does to communities served by this station, you couldn&#x27;t even begin to quantify.&quot; Vaughan told the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; that &quot;It&#x27;s very sad that the CRTC couldn&#x27;t sit down and work with this clearly volunteer organization and give them the benefit of the doubt and help them solve the problem rather than simply render a very tough decision against them.&quot;

Referring to previous boards of directors, outgoing Ryerson Students Union president and CKLN director Toby Whitfield observed: &quot;There&#x27;s been so much infighting for so many years, people lost sight of the purpose of the station. The privilege of having a licence is amazing, and I think that&#x27;s what was missing,&quot; adding that the current board had gotten more students involved.

==Move to Regent Park==
On August 2, 2011, in a statement posted on CKLN&#x27;s website, it was announced that the Palin Foundation would evict CKLN on August 27, 2011. It was confirmed officially by CKLN on August 4, 2011, that, after the eviction, CKLN internet streaming would emanate almost exclusively from the Regent Park Focus Youth Media Arts Centre, a community group which offers media training programs for economically disadvantaged youth in the neighbourhood and which had already produced a weekly program for broadcast on CKLN for a number of years.

According to then station manager Jacky Tuinstra-Harrison, &quot;They have a social mission which is very similar to ours, which is to have citizens participate in their media... It&#x27;s a wonderful opportunity to expand on our social mission, representing marginalized communities or communities that don&#x27;t get to represent themselves a lot in mainstream media.&quot;

==Dissolution==
At a CKLN membership meeting held on October 11, 2011, a motion was passed to seek court approval for the dissolution of CKLN Radio Incorporated. Court approval for dissolution was granted on December 14, 2011. CKLN.fm ceased operations on December 26, 2011, with most of its programs and volunteers moving to Radio Regent, a new internet radio service owned and operated by Regent Park Focus Youth Media Arts Centre and unaffiliated with CKLN Radio Inc.

==Fate of 88.1 and new Ryerson application==
On September 28, 2011, Evanov Radio Group (via licensee Dufferin Communications) submitted an application to move CIRR-FM (which carried a contemporary hit radio format targeting the LGBT community) from 103.9 to CKLN&#x27;s former frequency on 88.1. Per its competitive licensing process, the CRTC issued a call for competing applicants, and received 27 submissions in total. The applications included submissions by MZ Media, Astral Media, Newcap Radio, Larche Communications, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Trust Communications, Intercity Broadcasting, CHIN Radio/TV International, La Coopérative Radiophonique de Toronto and numerous ethnic broadcasters, as well as a new student group from Ryerson University that planned to relaunch the station with a new governance model.

On September 11, 2012, the license was awarded to Rock 95 Broadcasting Ltd., which launched its new station CIND-FM on the frequency in 2013.

In 2013, Radio Ryerson Inc. launched The Scope, an internet radio station whose application for an AM radio licence was heard by the CRTC on September 25, 2014 and was granted by the CRTC on December 11. The new station began broadcasting on 1280 AM, with the call sign CJRU, on March 31, 2016.

In 2016, the CKLN-FM call sign was taken by Newcap Radio for a transmitter in Clarenville, Newfoundland and Labrador, which operates as a rebroadcaster of CHVO-FM in Carbonear.

<doc id="1226289" wikidata="Q727893" url="?curid=1226289" title="Bless the Child">
<text>Bless the Child is a 2000 supernatural horror film directed by Chuck Russell, and starring Kim Basinger, Jimmy Smits, Angela Bettis, Rufus Sewell, Christina Ricci, and Holliston Coleman. Based on the 1993 novel by Cathy Cash Spellman, it follows a woman who discovers that her niece, whom she has adopted, is being sought by a Satanic cult seeking to use her supernatural abilities. The film is a co-production between the United States, Canada and Germany.

Filmed in Toronto in late 1999, &quot;Bless the Child&quot; was released theatrically in North America on August 11, 2000, to overwhelmingly negative critical reviews, and was a box-office bomb.

==Plot==
Maggie O&#x27;Connor, a psychiatric nurse in New York City, adopts her newborn niece, Cody, from her sister Jenna, a homeless heroin addict who abandoned her at Maggie&#x27;s house just before Christmas. Maggie raises Cody herself, and during her formative years, Cody exhibits signs of autism, though Maggie is suspicious of the diagnosis. Maggie enrolls Cody in a special-needs Catholic school in Brooklyn, where the nuns notice Cody displaying possibly telekinetic abilities.

Meanwhile, a series of child kidnappings and murders are plaguing the city, investigated by FBI Special Agent John Travis, a former seminary student. The bodies bear occult brandings, and the victims all share Cody&#x27;s birthdate and age. At her hospital, Maggie meets Cheri, a young heroin addict bearing a mysterious Luciferian tattoo, who knows Jenna. In conversation, Cheri implies that Cody is special, and urges Maggie to protect her. When Maggie and Cody stop in a church, Maggie is startled when all of the votive candles light themselves in Cody&#x27;s presence.

When Maggie returns home, she is surprised to find Jenna, now clean and sober, there with her new husband, Eric Stark, a famous self-help guru, attempting to take Cody. Maggie refuses, but they manage to covertly kidnap Cody. Maggie reports it to police, and Agent Travis takes an interest in the case. Maggie attempts to learn more about Eric&#x27;s organization, the New Dawn Foundation, by visiting one of their centers. Cheri subsequently contacts Maggie, and explains she was previously a member of New Dawn, which is actually a front for a Luciferian cult, spearheaded by Eric. She says that the cult recently began kidnapping six-year-old children and subjecting them to tests; those who failed were murdered in what Cheri describes as the &quot;slaughter of the innocents&quot;. Cheri claims that Cody is destined to become a saint who will lead people to God, which Eric is attempting to thwart.

A group of cult members pursue Cheri after she provides Maggie Eric&#x27;s address, and decapitate her in the subway. Maggie visits the address, located in a rundown building in Queens, and finds Eric, Jenna, and Cody there. Maggie holds Eric at gunpoint, but is chloroformed by his henchman, Stuart. She regains consciousness in the driver&#x27;s seat of car, crashing into the side of a bridge. She is helped by a mysterious stranger moments before the car falls into the river. Meanwhile, Eric attempts to force Cody to watch as he convinces a vagrant to commit suicide by self-immolation. However, Cody thwarts this by blowing out the match, assuring the man he has not been forsaken. After, Eric angrily burns the man alive. Jenna, meanwhile, is kept sedated with heroin.

Maggie tracks Cody, who is being cared for by a nanny and member of the cult, Dahnya, and kidnaps Cody while she is visiting an orthodontist. Another mysterious stranger, this time female, helps them catch a subway train by holding the door open. At the urging of a Jesuit priest, Maggie leaves with Cody en route to Sister Rosa&#x27;s convent in Vermont, but the cultists stalk them and manage to kidnap Cody. Maggie phones Agent Travis, who agrees to help her, tracking the cultists to a palatial estate owned by Eric. Maggie and Travis break into the home, but are assailed by cultists, who beat Travis. Maggie flees into the woods and reaches an abandoned church where the cult is preparing for a Black Mass. Meanwhile, the nuns at Sister Rosa&#x27;s convent, worried over Maggie&#x27;s failure to arrive with Cody, pray en masse for their wellbeing. Maggie stabs Eric, who then shoots her as she attempts to save Cody. Three orbs of light suddenly appear in the church as the cultists watch in terror, and Maggie&#x27;s bullet wounds mysteriously heal. Police raid the church; Travis kills Eric, and watches as the orbs of light disperse.

Some time later, Jenna is in rehab and has asked Maggie to legally adopt Cody. While Maggie, Travis, and Cody walk to mass, another cultist stalks Cody, planning to stab her. Framed by statues of sword-bearing angels, she turns to stare at him. He stops, awestruck, drops the knife and flees.

==Cast==
==Production==
Filming took place in the summer and fall of 1999 in Toronto, Ontario, which doubled for the film&#x27;s New York City setting.

==Release==
===Box office===
The film was released in North America on August 11, 2000, opening at #7 at box office and earning $9.4 million in its opening weekend. In the United Kingdom, the film premiered on January 5, 2001. It went on to gross only $40.4 million worldwide, below its $65 million budget.

===Critical response===
&quot;Bless the Child&quot; received almost universally negative reviews from critics.

Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; was critical of the plot and production values, and wrote: &quot;Combines the most rudimentary of Catholic-inspired good vs. evil plots with visual effects that would barely pass muster in episodic TV.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said the film &quot;opens strongly&quot; but soon &quot;lapses into an exercise in foolishness.&quot; Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;The scariest thing about this hokey bombast is that it got made in the first place.&quot; Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;A supernatural soap opera.&quot;
Vicky Edwards of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave it a mixed review, calling it &quot;Entertaining, but it doesn&#x27;t add enough to the genre to make it truly blessed.&quot;

The &quot;Hartford Courant&quot;″s review remarked the film&#x27;s lack of suspense but praised the performances, particularly Basinger&#x27;s and Ricci&#x27;s, though they were critical of Smits&#x27;s performance, comparing it negatively against his role in &quot;The Believers&quot; (1987), a film with similar themes.

Film critic Bruce Kirkland felt that &quot;Bless the Child&quot; was mocking Scientology in the guise of the fictional cult &quot;The New Dawn&quot;.

Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 4% rating based on reviews from 113 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Bless the Child&quot; squanders its talented cast on a plot that&#x27;s more likely to inspire unintentional laughs than shivers.&quot; It is ranked #64 on their list of the 100 worst films of all time.
On Metacritic it has a score of 17 indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;.
Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for one Razzie Award, Worst Actress for Kim Basinger, along with &quot;I Dreamed of Africa&quot;, but lost to Madonna for &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot;.

===Home media===
Paramount Home Entertainment released &quot;Bless the Child&quot; on DVD on February 13, 2001. Scream Factory announced a Blu-ray edition of the film scheduled for release on April 11, 2023.

<doc id="1226293" wikidata="Q902473" url="?curid=1226293" title="European Union trade mark">
<text>A European Union trade mark or EU trade mark (abbreviated EUTM; named &quot;Community Trade Mark&quot; (&quot;CTM&quot;) until 23 March 2016) is a trade mark which is pending registration or has been registered in the European Union as a whole (rather than on a national level within the EU).

The EU trade mark system creates a unified trade mark registration system in Europe, whereby one registration provides protection in all member states of the EU. The EU trade mark system is &quot;unitary&quot; in character. Thus, an objection against an EU trade mark application in any member state can defeat the entire application, an EU trade mark registration is enforceable in all member states.

The EU trade mark system is administered by the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), which is located in Alicante, Spain (see also trade mark law of the European Union).

== Characteristics ==

The EU trade mark gives its proprietor a uniform right applicable in all member states of the European Union on the strength of a single procedure which simplifies trade mark policies at European level. It fulfils the three essential functions of a trade mark at European level: it identifies the origin of goods and services, guarantees consistent quality through evidence of the company&#x27;s commitment to the consumer, and is a form of communication, a basis for publicity and advertising.

The EU trade mark may be used as a manufacturer&#x27;s mark, a mark for goods of a trading company, or service mark.

=== Collective marks ===
The EU trade mark may also take the form of a collective trade mark: properly applied, the regulation governing the use of the collective trade mark guarantees the origin, the nature and the quality of goods and services by making them distinguishable, which is beneficial to members of the association or body owning the trade mark.

=== Certification marks ===
The EU trade mark can also be a certification mark, namely a mark which distinguishes goods or services which are certified by the proprietor of the mark in respect of material, mode of manufacture of goods or performance of services, quality, accuracy or other characteristics, with the exception of geographical origin, from goods and services which are not so certified.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
The EU trade mark is obtained by registration in the Register kept by EUIPO. When registered, transferred or allowed to lapse, the effect of such action is EU-wide. It is valid for a period of 10 years and may be renewed indefinitely. The rules of law applicable to it are similar to those applied to national trade marks by the Member States. Companies will therefore find themselves in a familiar environment, just on a larger scale.

Another advantage are the fees. The initial cost of filing an application to register an EU trade mark is much less than filing separate national applications in all EU member states (which currently number 27). For filing purposes, the economic advantage of using the EUTM system increases according to the number of member states where a trade mark owner uses or proposes to use its mark. If a trade mark owner will only sell products or deliver services in fewer than three or four member states, consideration should be given to seeking registration in these countries rather than applying for an EU trade mark.

However, the economic advantage of using the EU trade mark system will quickly dissipate if an application is rejected on grounds which do not apply in all EU states (for example following opposition based on earlier conflicting national rights). This is because, although the applicant for a failed EU trade mark application may attempt to salvage the situation by converting the application into one or more national applications in EU states in which the grounds for refusal do not apply, the applicant cannot recover the costs of filing the EU trade mark application and must repay to file in each country where the EU trade mark application is converted.

In addition, the increasing size of the EU increases the probability that there will be third parties who consider that an EU trade mark application conflicts with their trade mark rights, and oppose the application accordingly.

==History==
The EU Trade Mark concept originated in 1964 in a draft of a &quot;Convention on European Trademark Law&quot;. However, it was not until 1980 that the first proposal for a regulation dealing with the EU Trade Mark appeared. Regulation came into effect with Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94 of 20 December 1993 on the Community trade mark:

but it was not until 1 April 1996 that the first CTM applications were processed and the register began to operate.

<doc id="1226300" wikidata="Q336729" url="?curid=1226300" title="John Moore-Brabazon, 1st Baron Brabazon of Tara">
<text>Lieutenant Colonel John Theodore Cuthbert Moore-Brabazon, 1st Baron Brabazon of Tara, , HonFRPS (8 February 1884 – 17 May 1964) was an English aviation pioneer and Conservative politician. He was the first Englishman to pilot a heavier-than-air machine under power in England, and he served as Minister of Transport and Minister of Aircraft Production during the Second World War.

==Early life==
Moore-Brabazon was born in London to Lieutenant Colonel John Arthur Henry Moore-Brabazon (1828–1908) and his wife, Emma Sophia née Richards (died 1937). He was educated at Harrow School before studying engineering at Trinity College, Cambridge, but did not graduate. He spent university holidays working for Charles Rolls as an unpaid mechanic, and became an apprentice at Darracq in Paris after leaving Cambridge. In 1907 he won the Circuit des Ardennes in a Minerva.

==Pioneer aviator==
Moore-Brabazon first flew solo in November 1908 in France in a Voisin biplane. He became the first resident Englishman to make an officially recognized aeroplane flight in England on 2 May 1909, at Shellbeach on the Isle of Sheppey with flights of 450 ft, 600 ft, and 1500 ft. On 4 May 1909, Moore-Brabazon was photographed outside the Royal Aero Club clubhouse Mussell Manor (now Muswell Manor Holiday Park) alongside the Wright Brothers, the Short Brothers, Charles Rolls, and many other early aviation pioneers. In 1909 he sold the &quot;Bird of Passage&quot; to Arthur Edward George, who learned to fly in it at the Royal Aero Club&#x27;s flying-ground at Shellbeach and bought a Short Brothers-built Wright biplane. A documentary, &quot;A Dream of Flight&quot;, was made in 2009 to celebrate the centenary of his achievement on the Isle of Sheppey.

On 30 October 1909, flying the Short Biplane No. 2, he flew a circular mile and won a 1,000 pound prize offered by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper. On 4 November 1909, as a joke to prove that pigs could fly, he put a small pig in a waste-paper basket tied to a wing-strut of his aeroplane. This may have been the first live cargo flight by aeroplane. With Charles Rolls, he would later make the first ascent in a spherical gas balloon, which had been made in England by the Short brothers.

On 8 March 1910, Moore-Brabazon became the first person to qualify as a pilot in the United Kingdom and was awarded Royal Aero Club Aviator&#x27;s Certificate number 1; his car also bore the number-plate FLY 1. However, only four months later, his friend Charles Rolls was killed in a flying accident and Moore-Brabazon&#x27;s wife persuaded him to give up flying.

==First World War==
With the outbreak of war, Moore-Brabazon returned to flying, joining the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). He received a special-reserve commission as a second lieutenant (on probation) in the RFC on 2 December 1914, in the appointment of flying officer (assistant equipment officer), and was confirmed in his rank on 11 February 1915.
 He was promoted to lieutenant on 19 February 1915 and was appointed an equipment officer on 31 March, with the temporary rank of captain. On 1 September 1915, he was promoted to the substantive rank of captain, with a special temporary promotion to major on 18 May 1916.

He served on the Western Front, where he played a key role in the development of aerial photography and reconnaissance. On 1 April 1918, when the Royal Flying Corps merged with the Royal Naval Air Service to form the Royal Air Force, Moore-Brabazon was appointed as a staff officer (first class) and made a temporary lieutenant-colonel. He was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel in the RAF on 1 January 1919 in recognition of his wartime services, relinquishing his commission that year.

Moore-Brabazon finished the war with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was decorated with the Military Cross on 1 January 1917, and was also twice mentioned in despatches, on 15 October 1915 and on 13 November 1916. He was further decorated as a Knight of the Legion of Honour in February 1916.

==Pioneer yachtsman==
In 1934 Moore-Brabazon fitted a gyro-rig to a Bembridge Redwing, an Isle of Wight class of yacht that allows and encourages the development of different rigs. The area of the rotating blades complies with the sail area limits of the class and are painted red, also to comply with the class rules. The boat was, and remains, dangerous, but it was probably the first auto-gyro boat. The boat is currently in the collection of the Classic Boat Museum at East Cowes, Isle of Wight, and still &#x27;sails&#x27;.

==Conservative MP==
Moore-Brabazon later became a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Chatham (1918–1929) and Wallasey (1931–1942) and served as a junior minister in the 1920s. In 1931 and 1932 he served as a member of the London County Council. He was strongly opposed to war with Nazi Germany and in early 1939, when war seemed imminent, he made contact with Oswald Mosley in an attempt to co-ordinate activity against the war.

Despite his earlier anti-war agitation, in Winston Churchill&#x27;s wartime government, he was appointed Minister of Transport in October 1940 and joined the Privy Council, becoming Minister of Aircraft Production in May 1941. As the Minister of Transport he proposed the use of Airgraphs to reduce the weight and bulk of mails travelling between troops fighting in the Middle East and their families in the UK. He was forced to resign in 1942 for expressing the hope that Germany and the Soviet Union, then engaged in the Battle of Stalingrad, would destroy each other. Since the Soviet Union was fighting the war on the same side as Britain, the hope that it should be destroyed, though common in the Conservative Party, was unacceptable to the war effort.

==Later life==
Moore-Brabazon was elevated to the House of Lords as Baron Brabazon of Tara, of Sandwich in the County of Kent, in April 1942. In 1943 he chaired the Brabazon Committee which planned to develop the post-war British aircraft industry. He was involved in the production of the Bristol Brabazon, a giant airliner that first flew on 4 September 1949. It was then and still is the largest aeroplane built entirely in Britain although only one example was built and it was a very expensive failure Britain could not afford.

In 1949, when the House of Lords Yacht Club was established, Brabazon was its first Commodore.

A keen golfer, Moore-Brabazon was captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, the governing body of golf, from 1952 to 1953.

In 1955, then 71 years old, he won the Cresta Run Coronation Cup at an average speed of .

Moore-Brabazon was president of the Royal Aero Club, receiving its gold medal in 1958, president of the Royal Institution, chairman of the Air Registration Board, and president of the Middlesex County Automobile Club from 1946 until his death in 1964. He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire in 1953. In 1960 he presented the Brabazon Cup to the British Women Pilots&#x27; Association, to be given for achievements in aviation. The first recipient was Yvonne Pope.

On 27 November 1906, he married Hilda Mary Krabbé, with whom he had two sons. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Derek.

Moore-Brabazon is buried in Stoke Poges Memorial Gardens, Buckinghamshire.

<text>ChessV (short for Chess Variants) is a free computer program designed to play many chess variants.
&quot;ChessV&quot; is an open-source, universal chess variant program with a graphical user-interface, sophisticated AI, support for opening books and other features of traditional chess programs. The developer of this program, Gregory Strong, has been adding more variants with each release of &quot;ChessV&quot;. Over 100 chess variants are supported, including the developer&#x27;s few own variants and other exotic variants, and can be programmed to play additional variants. &quot;ChessV&quot; is designed to be able to play any game that is reasonably similar to chess. &quot;ChessV&quot; is one of only a few such programs that exist. The source code of this program is freely available for download as well as the executable program.

As of ChessV 0.93, it is possible to customize the variants it supports. Of all chess variants supported, two of the most-played variants are probably Fischer Random Chess and Grand Chess.

&quot;ChessV&quot; is capable of playing:
* 2 variants on 6×6 squares
* 17 variants on 8×8 squares
* 15 variants on 10×8 squares
(including 10 Capablanca Chess variants)
* 15 variants on 10×10 squares
* 3 variants on 12×8 squares

Some of the provided variants can be customized in their details. While users can create custom variants with ChessV 0.93, it needs to be recompiled, which is tedious when programming. ChessV 2.0+ fixes this, using a scripting language. While the pieces in a custom variant have to be chosen from a limited list, this allows ChessV to play hundreds or thousands of variants of each game it directly supports.

== Engine features ==
* Searching: Alpha-Beta Nega-Max Principal variation search, Iterative deepening, Null-move Forward Pruning, Static Exchange Evaluation (SEE).
:: &quot;Search Extensions&quot;: check extension, recapture extension, null-move threat extension, PV extension, Futility Pruning and Razoring, History Heuristic, Killer-move heuristic.
* Evaluation: Piece-square tables, Pawn structure evaluation, Mobility evaluation, King safety, King tropism, Lazy evaluation.
* Hash Tables: Transposition table, Pawn structure table, Evaluation cache, Repetition detection.

Since ChessV 2.2, the engine can be set to adjust to their player&#x27;s needs:
* Transposition Table Size can be adjusted.
* The engine can be allowed for variance of play.
* Weaken the chess engine to be human-beatable even for beginners.

== Current limitations ==
* No games with more than two players are supported.
* No games with randomness or hidden information are supported.
* No ability to edit the board mid-game is provided.

== Supported games ==

ChessV supports many variants. Other than chess, it supports:
* Alice Chess, Almost Chess, Archchess, Berolina Chess, Bird&#x27;s Chess, Capablanca Chess and its variants, Carrera&#x27;s Chess, Chess480, Chess and a Half, Chess with Different Armies, Courier Chess, Cylindrical Chess, Diagonal Chess, Diamond Chess, Doublemove chess, Embassy Chess, Eurasian Chess, Extinction Chess, Fischer Random Chess (Chess960), Great Chess, Great Shatranj, Grand Chess, Grotesque Chess, Janus Chess, Kinglet, Ladorean Chess, Legan&#x27;s Game, Los Alamos Chess, Makruk, Omega Chess, Opulent Chess, Roman Chess, Royal Court, Shatranj, Shatranj Kamil, Sosarian Chess, Switching Chess, TenCubed Chess, Three Checks Chess, and more infamous variants.

Since ChessV can be programmed to play additional variants, here are a few examples:

* Almost Chess, Enep, Butterfly Chess, Nightrider chess and Janus Kamil.

== Syntax ==
ChessV code is saved as the extension &quot;.cvc&quot; (ChessV Code). Its syntax is reasonably similar to C#. The scripting language is mostly stable, but creating new rules for new pieces is not supported yet. Here is an example of &quot;Almost Chess&quot; in .cvc code:
Game &#x27;Almost Chess&#x27; : Chess
 Invented = &quot;1977&quot;;
 InventedBy = &quot;Ralph Betza&quot;;
 AddPieceTypes
 Queen.Enabled = false;
 AddPieceType( Chancellor, &quot;Chancellor&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, 900, 925 );

 SetGameVariables
 Array = &quot;rnbckbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBCKBNR&quot;;
 PromotionTypes = &quot;CRNB&quot;;
}

==Competitions==
ChessV software won third place in a 2004 Gothic Chess Computer World Championship.

The show was traditionally split into two major parts per half-hour (occasionally dedicating a full half hour per show, or sometimes splitting into three parts), and had a music video at the end of the episode, starring the three main characters and any minor characters involved in the episode. This musical montage would take clips from the episode itself and reiterate the life lessons learned in the episode.

==Production==
The development of the series began as a series of ad bumpers for ABC&#x27;s Saturday morning lineup in 1993, hence the title &quot;Bump in the Night&quot; and the character&#x27;s naming of Mr. Bumpy. In 1996, DIC Entertainment, while still in partnership with the ABC network, purchased the show&#x27;s rights, even though they were never involved in the show&#x27;s production.. Reruns of Bump in the Night were featured on Toon Disney from 1998 to 2001.

==Home releases==
On VHS, the series was released by Capital Cities/ABC Video Enterprises and later Anchor Bay Entertainment on many VHS volumes:
In September 2003, Sterling Entertainment released a VHS/DVD called Night of the Living Bread, containing 6 segments. 3 additional segments were included on DVD. In April 2010, Shout! Factory released &quot;Bump In The Night: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD. In February 2016, Mill Creek Entertainment re-released &quot;Bump in the Night – The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

<text>Stangeria eriopus is a cycad endemic to southern Africa. It is the sole species in the genus Stangeria, most closely related to the Australian genus &quot;Bowenia&quot;, with which it forms the family Stangeriaceae.

==Description==
&quot;Stangeria eriopus&quot; is a very long-lived, perennial, evergreen cycad. The stalked, feathered, fern-like leaves are between 25 centimeters and two meters long, with the petiole comprising one third to one half of the overall length (in both varieties). They are pinnately-veined, which distinguishes the species from all other cycads. The petiole comprises half the length of the leaf. The young leaves are bent in bud position, the tip appears rolled up. Young leaves are dotted with short, gray hairs (trichomes), which usually fall off quickly and only stick to the petiole. These trichomes are unbranched and transparent or colored. The species occurs as two variable forms or varieties. The forest form, growing in regions with higher rainfall, is characterized by large, wide leaves that can reach up to 2 m in length. The grassland form, growing in regions subject to annual fire and drought, has shorter leaves with a thicker cuticle that may only be 30 cm long.

===Tubers===

Stems are completely subterranean and the root tuber is shaped like a carrot, which reaches a diameter of 10 to 25 centimeters. The tip bifurcates into several shoot tips. These form at the beginning wooly scales, but fall off early. As in other cycads, &quot;S. eriopus&quot; forms coralloid roots. These are specialized, plagiotropic (sideways-growing) roots housing colonies of cyanobacteria &quot;Bacillus radicola&quot; and &quot;Azotobacter sp.&quot; that fix nitrogen, much like the roots of legumes.

The tuber is rich in carbohydrates and contains an exceptionally high concentration of sodium sulfate, which explains the breaking-irritant effect. The most common biflavones in the leaves are amentoflavone and bilobetin.

===Cones===
&quot;S. eriopus&quot; reaches maturity at 5–7 years of age, and has stalked cones as reproductive organs. As is typical of cycads, the species is dioecious, meaning that male and female cones are borne on different plants. Both male and female cones are pedunculated and covered with silvery hair when young, which is deciduous at maturity.

====Male cone====
The male cone is cylindrical and tapers towards the tip. At maturity reaches a diameter between 30 – 40 mm and becomes between 10 – 25 cm long. The cone then turns yellowish brown at maturity. The scales or microsporophyll, are arranged cylindrically around the pin axis. Their shape is triangular to rhomboid. Each microsporophyll forms about 150 pollen sacs, which are attached in groups of 3-6 at the bottom. At maturity, the pin axis extends and the scales are lifted apart and release the pollen.

====Female cone====
The female cones are ellipsoidal to conical with a rounded tip. The cones are about 18 inches long and reach a diameter of about 8 centimeters. At maturity, the cone turn to dark green. Like the male microsporophylls, the female megasporophylls are cylindrically arranged around the axis. Their tips form but six vertical lines. The ovules are formed at the base of megasporophyll and reach a size of 35 × 25 millimeters. When the cone is ripe, the megasporophylls separate. The micropyle exudes a drop of liquid that pulls the pollen capillary to the embryo sack when it dries. After ripening the seeds, the female cones dissolve and the seeds fall to the ground. They consist of a hard, dark red part, which is surrounded by a fleshy, purple seed coat, which later turns brown. They are about 2 inches long and about 14 millimeters wide.

====Pollen====
The cones are insect-pollinated, giving off a faint odor to attract beetle pollinators. At maturity they fall apart to reveal the seeds, which are 2–3 cm in length. The pollen carry on the outside a glycocalyx, which consists of densely packed cylindrical units measuring 20 to 150 nanometers. They are perpendicular to the plasma membrane. Below is the sporopollenin. The germinal openings (apertures) are more proximal than distal. At the distal end of each pollen grain, there is an unusual pit (pseudosulcus) that resembles a &quot;failed&quot; distal aperture.
==Distribution and habitat==
It is native to a narrow coastal strip, some 800 kilometres in extent, in the KwaZulu-Cape and Maputaland coastal forest mosaics of South Africa and southern Mozambique. The western limit of the distribution area is located near Banjul in the district of Sarah Baartman. It is found within 50 km, but not closer than 2 or 3 km from the sea.

This species of cycad is adaptable and is found in many habitats, from grassland to closed forest, whether in full sunshine or shade. The species has a low salt tolerance however. It is sometimes found in meadows near the coastal dunes, where the plants are protected from salt water. Sandy, slightly acidic soil is preferred, but at the northern limit of its range, &quot;Stangeria eriopus&quot; also grows on clay or very stony soils.

===Conservation===
IUCN Red List Category &amp; Criteria: Vulnerable, mainly due to habitat loss and over-exploiting for traditional medicine. It is listed under CITES Appendix I / EU Annex A, which prohibits international trade in specimens of this species except when the purpose of the import is not commercial, for instance for scientific research. The species is threatened by the destruction of its habitat and the unsustainable harvesting for traditional medicinal purposes.

Another possible threat to the species is the lobster louse (Diaspididae) &quot;Aulacaspis yasumatsui&quot;. The insect originally hails from Thailand where it infests their cycads. The pest has now been introduced to Florida, Hawaii, Hong Kong and the Cayman Islands, where it causes significant damage to cycads. If the species is introduced to South Africa, it could drastically reduce or even destroy the Stangeria population in a short amount of time.

Stangeria eriopus is also a carrier of the fungus &quot;Guignardia mangiferae&quot;, which causes great damage to citrus fruit, but remains on the plant without symptoms. The larvae of the butterfly &quot;Callioratis millari&quot; feed on the leaves of the species.

The &quot;Stangeria eriopus&quot; can be asexually reproduced from root parts. It is the first species of cycad that has been propagated using tissue culture, which simplifies the conservation of the species.

==Discovery==
When Gustav Kunze discovered the first plants, he incorrectly designated them as ferns probably due to the primitive nerves, under the name &quot;Lomaria coriacea&quot;. In 1839 he described it again as a separate species of fern as &quot;Lomaria eriopus&quot;. It was not until 1851 that William Stanger discovered that they were cycads when he observed the cones. He sent samples to England, where they were described by Thomas Moore described the Art 1853 as &quot;Stangeria paradoxa&quot; and thus also established the genus. However, since the epithet &quot;eriopus&quot; of Kunze was validly described, Henri Ernest Baillon with his description in 1892 the correct name as &quot;Stangeria eriopus&quot;.

===Etymology===
The genus was named in honor of William Stanger (1811-1854), who sent the first cones to England. He was an English physician and naturalist who worked in South Africa.

The binomial name comes from the Greek prefix &quot;erio-&quot;, meaning &quot;woolly&quot;, and suffix &quot;-pus&quot;, &quot;footed&quot;, referring to the woolly petiole bases. It was named in honour of William Stanger, a former surveyor-general of Natal. Common names includes Natal grass cycad, Hottentot&#x27;s head and Stangeria.

==Cytology==
The species has 2n = 16 chromosomes. The cladogram shows twelve metacentric, two submetacentric and two acrocentric chromosomes.

== Systematics and Taxonomy ==

The closest relative to &quot;Stangeria eriopus&quot; was thought to be the genus &quot;Bowenia&quot;, both placed in the family &quot;Stangeriaceae&quot;. Another candidate is the extinct Tertiary genus &quot;Eostangeria&quot;.

However, molecular phylogenetic studies show that &quot;Stangeria&quot; is more closely related to the genus &quot;Ceratozamia&quot; or to &quot;Zamia&quot; and &quot;Microcycas&quot; than to &quot;Bowenia&quot;, implying that the Stangeriaceae are not a monophyletic group.

==Uses==
In South African traditional medicine, the thickened subterranean tuber stem serves both for the production of various magical tinctures and as an emetic. The dried tuber is also mixed with feed to combat internal parasites in cattle.

For these purposes, the plants are collected and sold, this goes so far that the stock is now endangered. For one gram of tuber, 5 cents were paid on the market in Mthala in 2005.
