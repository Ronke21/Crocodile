<text>John Alan Lasseter ( ; born January 12, 1957) is an American film director, producer, and animator. He was previously the chief creative officer of Pixar Animation Studios, Walt Disney Animation Studios, and Disneytoon Studios, as well as the Principal Creative Advisor for Walt Disney Imagineering, and has served as the head of animation at Skydance Animation since 2019.

Lasseter began his career as an animator with The Walt Disney Company. After being fired from Disney for promoting computer animation, he joined Lucasfilm, where he worked on then-ground breaking usage of CGI animation. The Graphics Group of the Computer Division of Lucasfilm was sold to Steve Jobs and became Pixar in 1986. Lasseter oversaw all of Pixar&#x27;s films and associated projects. He personally directed &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995), &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; (1998), &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999), &quot;Cars&quot; (2006), and &quot;Cars 2&quot; (2011), and executive-produced all other Pixar films through 2018. From 2006 to 2018, Lasseter also oversaw all of Walt Disney Animation Studios&#x27; (and its division Disneytoon Studios&#x27;) films and associated projects as executive producer.

His works have grossed more than 19 billion, making him one of the most financially successful filmmakers of all time. Of the ten animated films that have grossed over US$1 billion, five of them were executive produced by Lasseter: &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010)—the first animated film to surpass $1 billion—and &quot;Frozen&quot; (2013)—the third-highest-grossing animated film of all time—as well as &quot;Zootopia&quot; (2016), &quot;Finding Dory&quot; (2016), and &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; (2018). &quot;Frozen&quot; also held the title of the highest-grossing animated film of all time until 2019, and was the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time at the end of its theatrical run. He has won two Academy Awards, for Best Animated Short Film (for &quot;Tin Toy&quot;), as well as a Special Achievement Award (for &quot;Toy Story&quot;).

In November 2017, Lasseter took a six-month sabbatical from Pixar and Disney Animation after being made aware of interactions with employees that made them uncomfortable, and subsequently apologizing and acknowledging the interactions as &quot;missteps&quot;. According to various news outlets, Lasseter had a history of alleged sexual misconduct toward employees. In June 2018, it was announced that he would be leaving the company at the end of the year when his contract expired; he took on a consulting role until then. Following his departure from Disney and Pixar, Lasseter was later hired by Skydance founder and CEO David Ellison to run the animation division Skydance Animation.

==Early life==
John Alan Lasseter was born on January 12, 1957, in Hollywood, California. His mother, Jewell Mae (née Risley; 1918–2005), was an art teacher at Bell Gardens High School, and his father, Paul Eual Lasseter (1924–2011), was a parts manager at a Chevrolet dealership.

Lasseter is a fraternal twin; his sister Johanna Lasseter-Curtis, who became a baker based in the Lake Tahoe area, is six minutes older.

Lasseter grew up in Whittier, California. His mother&#x27;s profession contributed to his growing preoccupation with animation. He often drew cartoons during services at the Church of Christ church his family regularly attended. As a child, Lasseter would race home from school to watch Chuck Jones cartoons on television. While in high school, he read &quot;The Art of Animation&quot; by Bob Thomas. The book covered the history of Disney animation and explored the making of Disney&#x27;s 1959 film &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, which made Lasseter realize he wanted to do animation himself. When he saw a screening of Disney&#x27;s 1963 film &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; at the Wardman Theater, he knew early in his youth that he wanted to become an animator. He then read Preston Blair&#x27;s book about animation, and made flipbooks based on Blair&#x27;s walk cycles. One of his friends had a Super 8 camera that shot single frames, which was used to shoot some of his earlier animation efforts.

Lasseter heard of a new character animation program at the California Institute of the Arts (often abbreviated as &#x27;CalArts&#x27;) and decided to follow his dream of becoming an animator. His mother further encouraged him to take up a career in animation, and, after graduating from Whittier High School in 1975, he enrolled as the second student (Jerry Rees was the first) in the CalArts Character Animation program created by Disney animators Jack Hannah and T. Hee. Lasseter was taught by three members of Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men team of veteran animators—Eric Larson, Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston—and his classmates included future animators and directors like Brad Bird, John Musker, Henry Selick, Tim Burton, and Chris Buck. During his time there, he produced two animated shorts—&quot;Lady and the Lamp&quot; (1979) and &quot;Nitemare&quot; (1980)—which each won the student Academy Award for Animation.

While at CalArts, Lasseter first started working for the Walt Disney Company at Disneyland in Anaheim during summer breaks and got a job as a Jungle Cruise skipper, where he learned the basics of comedy and comic timing to entertain captive audiences on the ride.

==Career==
===First years at Disney===
Upon graduating in 1979, Lasseter immediately obtained a job as an animator at Walt Disney Productions mostly due to his success with his student project, &quot;Lady and the Lamp&quot;. The studio had reviewed approximately 10,000 portfolios in the late 1970s in search of talent, then selected only about 150 candidates as apprentices, of which only about 45 were kept on permanently. In the fall of 1979, Disney animator Mel Shaw told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that &quot;John&#x27;s got an instinctive feel for character and movement and shows every indication of blossoming here at our studios ... In time, he&#x27;ll make a fine contribution.&quot; At that same time, Lasseter worked on a sequence titled &quot;The Emperor and the Nightingale&quot; (based on &quot;The Nightingale&quot; by Hans Christian Andersen) for a Disney project called &quot;Musicana&quot;. &quot;Musicana&quot; was never released but eventually led to the development of &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; (1999).

However, after &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; (1961), which in Lasseter&#x27;s opinion was the film where Disney had reached its highest plateau, he felt that the studio had lost momentum and was often repeating itself. Between 1980 and 1981, he coincidentally came across some video tapes from one of the then new computer-graphics conferences, who showed some of the very beginnings of computer animation, primarily floating spheres and such, which he experienced as a revelation. But it was not until shortly after, when he was invited by his friends Jerry Rees and Bill Kroyer, while working on &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (1983), to come and see the first light cycle sequences for an upcoming film entitled &quot;Tron&quot; (1982), featuring state-of-the-art computer-generated imagery (CGI), that he saw the huge potential of this new technology in animation. Up to that time, the studio had used a multiplane camera to add depth to its animation. Lasseter realized that computers could be used to make films with three-dimensional backgrounds where traditionally animated characters could interact to add a new level of visually stunning depth that had not been possible before. He knew adding dimension to animation had been a longtime dream of animators, going back to Walt Disney.

Later, he and Glen Keane talked about how great it would be to make an animated feature where the background was computer-generated, and then showed Keane the book &quot;The Brave Little Toaster&quot; by Thomas Disch, which he thought would be a good candidate for the film. Keane agreed, but first, they decided to do a short test film to see how it worked out and chose &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;, a decision based on the fact that Disney had considered producing a feature based on the works of Maurice Sendak. Satisfied with the result, Lasseter, Keane and executive Thomas L. Wilhite went on with the project, especially Lasseter who dedicated himself to it, while Keane eventually went on to work with &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; (1986).

Lasseter and his colleagues unknowingly stepped on some of their direct superiors&#x27; toes by circumventing them in their enthusiasm to get the &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; project into motion. The project was canceled while being pitched to two of Lasseter&#x27;s supervisors, animation administrator Ed Hansen, and head of Disney studios, Ron W. Miller, due to lack of perceived cost benefits for the mix of traditional and computer animation. A few minutes after the meeting, Lasseter was summoned by Hansen to his office. As Lasseter recalled, Hansen told him, &quot;Well, John, your project is now complete, so your employment with the Disney Studios is now terminated.&quot; Wilhite, who was part of Disney&#x27;s live-action group and therefore had no obligations to the animation studio, was able to arrange to keep Lasseter around temporarily until the &quot;Wild Things&quot; test project was complete in January 1984, but with the understanding there would be no further work for Lasseter at Disney Animation. &quot;The Brave Little Toaster&quot; would later become a 2D animated feature film directed by one of Lasseter&#x27;s friends, Jerry Rees, and co-produced by Wilhite (who had, by then, left to start Hyperion Pictures), and some of the staff of Pixar would be involved in the film alongside Lasseter.

===Lucasfilm and Pixar===

While putting together a crew for the planned feature, Lasseter had made some contacts in the computer industry, among them Alvy Ray Smith and Ed Catmull at Lucasfilm Computer Graphics Group. After being fired, and feeling glum knowing his employment with Disney was to end shortly, Lasseter visited a computer graphics conference in November 1983 at the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; in Long Beach, where he met and talked to Catmull again. Catmull inquired about &quot;The Brave Little Toaster&quot;, which Lasseter explained had been shelved. From his experience at Lucasfilm, Catmull assumed Lasseter was simply between projects since Hollywood studios have traditionally laid off employees when they lack enough productions to keep them busy. Still devastated at being forced out of the only company he had ever wanted to work for, Lasseter could not find the strength to tell Catmull that he had been fired.

Catmull later telephoned Smith that day and mentioned that Lasseter was not working at Disney. Smith told Catmull to put down the phone and hire Lasseter right now. Lasseter agreed instantly to work freelance with Catmull and his colleagues and joined them for a week of December 1983 on a project that resulted in their first computer-animated short: &quot;The Adventures of André &amp; Wally B.&quot;, meant to prove it was possible to do character animation on a computer. After his work on the &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;-test, Lasseter assumed hand-drawn characters in a CGI environment was the only way, but Catmull insisted it could be done, it was just that nobody had given it an attempt before. Because Catmull was not allowed to hire animators, he was given the title &quot;Interface Designer&quot;; &quot;Nobody knew what that was but they didn&#x27;t question it in budget meetings&quot;. Lasseter spent a lot of time at Lucasfilm in the San Francisco Bay Area in the spring of 1984, where he worked together closely with Catmull and his team of computer science researchers. Lasseter learned how to use some of their software, and in turn, he taught the computer scientists about filmmaking, animation, and art. The short turned out to be more revolutionary than Lasseter first had visualized before he came to Lucasfilm. His original idea had been to create only the backgrounds on computers, but in the final short everything was computer-animated, including the characters.

After the short CGI film was presented at SIGGRAPH in the summer of 1984, Lasseter returned to Los Angeles with the hope of directing &quot;The Brave Little Toaster&quot; at Hyperion Pictures. He soon learned that funding had fallen through and called Catmull with the bad news. Catmull called back with a job offer, and Lasseter joined Lucasfilm as a full-time employee in October 1984 and moved to the Bay Area. After that, he worked with ILM on the special effects on &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot;, where he made the first fully computer-generated photorealistic animated character, a knight composed of elements from a stained glass window. This effect was the first CGI character to be scanned and painted directly onto film using a laser. Lasseter and Catmull&#x27;s collaboration, which has since lasted over thirty years, would ultimately result in &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995), which was the first-ever computer-animated feature film. Additionally, Lasseter created THX&#x27;s robot mascot Tex. He made his first appearance in 1996 with the original theatrical release of &quot;Independence Day&quot;. Since then, Tex has appeared in some THX trailers.

Due to George Lucas&#x27;s financially crippling divorce, he was forced to sell off Lucasfilm Computer Graphics, by this time renamed the Pixar Graphics Group, founded by Smith and Catmull, with Lasseter as one of the founding employees. It was spun off as a separate corporation with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs as its majority shareholder in 1986. Over the next 10 years, Pixar evolved from a computer company that did animation work on the side into an animation studio. Lasseter oversaw all of Pixar&#x27;s films and associated projects as executive producer. As well as &quot;Toy Story&quot;, he also personally directed &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; (1998), &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999), &quot;Cars&quot; (2006), and &quot;Cars 2&quot; (2011).

He has won two Academy Awards, for Animated Short Film (&quot;Tin Toy&quot;), as well as a Special Achievement Award (&quot;Toy Story&quot;). Lasseter has been nominated on four other occasions—in the category of Animated Feature, for both &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; (2001) and &quot;Cars&quot;, in the Original Screenplay category for &quot;Toy Story&quot; and in the Animated Short category for &quot;Luxo, Jr.&quot; (1986)—while the short &quot;Knick Knack&quot; (1989) was selected by Terry Gilliam as one of the ten best animated films of all time. In 2008, he was honored with the Winsor McCay Award, the lifetime achievement award for animators.

=== Return to Disney ===

Disney announced that it would be purchasing Pixar in January 2006, and Lasseter was named the chief creative officer of both Pixar and Walt Disney Feature Animation, the latter of which he renamed Walt Disney Animation Studios. Lasseter was also named principal creative adviser at Walt Disney Imagineering, where he helped design attractions for Disney Parks. He oversaw all of Walt Disney Animation Studios&#x27; films and associated projects as executive producer. He reported directly to Disney Chairman and CEO Bob Iger, bypassing Disney&#x27;s studio and theme park executives. He also received green-light power on films with Roy E. Disney&#x27;s consent.

In December 2006, Lasseter announced that Disney Animation would start producing animated shorts – 2D, CGI, or a combination of both – that would be released theatrically. Lasseter said he sees this medium as an excellent way to train and discover new talent in the company as well as a testing ground for new techniques and ideas.

In June 2007, Catmull and Lasseter were given control of Disneytoon Studios, a division of Walt Disney Animation Studios housed in a separate facility in Glendale. As president and chief creative officer, respectively, they have supervised three separate studios for Disney, each with its own production pipeline: Pixar, Disney Animation, and Disneytoon. While Disney Animation and Disneytoon are located in the Los Angeles area, Pixar is located over 350 miles (563 kilometers) northwest in the Bay Area, where Catmull and Lasseter both live. Accordingly, they appointed a general manager for each studio to manage day-to-day business affairs, then established a routine of spending at least two days per week (usually Tuesdays and Wednesdays) in Southern California.

Lasseter is a close friend and admirer of Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki, whom he first met when TMS Entertainment sent a delegation of animators to the Disney studio in 1981 and showed a clip from Miyazaki&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot; (1979). Lasseter was so deeply moved that in 1985 he insisted on showing that clip and other examples of Miyazaki&#x27;s work after dinner to a woman he had just met (who would become his wife). He visited Miyazaki during his first trip to Japan in 1987 and saw drawings for &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; (1988). After Lasseter became a successful director and producer at Pixar, he went on to serve as executive producer on several of Miyazaki&#x27;s films for their release in the United States and oversaw the translation and dubbing of their English language soundtracks. In addition, the forest spirit Totoro from &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; makes an appearance as a plush toy in &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010).

Lasseter is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and served nine consecutive years on its board of governors from 2005 to 2014 when he had to relinquish his seat due to term limits. His last position on the board was as first vice president.

Lasseter received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Hollywood in 2011, located at 6834 Hollywood Boulevard.

===Allegations of sexual misconduct and exit from Disney and Pixar===

In November 2017, Lasseter took a six-month leave of absence after being made aware of interactions he had with employees that made them uncomfortable, and subsequently apologized and acknowledged said interactions as &quot;missteps&quot; in a memo to staff. Lasseter went on in the memo to emphasize his commitment to fixing his missteps and his hope to return to working with them in the new year. The alleged sexual misconduct toward multiple employees over a number of years included &quot;grabbing, kissing, [and] making comments about physical attributes&quot;. The behavior was alleged to have been so well-known that, according to &quot;Variety&quot;, at various times, Pixar had &quot;minders who were tasked with reining in his impulses&quot;.

In June 2018, Disney and Lasseter announced that he would be leaving the company at the end of the year, taking a consulting role until then.

===Skydance Animation===
On January 9, 2019, Lasseter was hired to head Skydance Animation, a new animation division of Skydance Media formed in 2017. In a statement, Lasseter said &quot;I have spent the last year away from the industry in deep reflection, learning how my actions unintentionally made colleagues uncomfortable, which I deeply regret and apologize for. It has been humbling, but I believe it will make me a better leader.&quot; An investigation conducted prior to his hiring found that no previous claims of sexual assault, propositioning or harassment had been filed against Lasseter, and &quot;[...] there were no findings of secret settlements by Disney or Lasseter to any parties asking for a settlement.&quot; In his role at Skydance, Lasseter serves as producer on all feature films and executive producer on all series, along with Skydance Media CEO David Ellison.

==Personal life==

Lasseter lives in Glen Ellen, California, with his wife Nancy, a graduate of Carnegie Mellon University, whom he met at a computer graphics conference in San Francisco in 1985. Nancy majored in computer graphics applications, and previously worked as a computer graphics engineer at Apple Computer. They married in 1988, and have four sons together in addition to Nancy&#x27;s son from a previous relationship, born between and 1997.

The Lasseters own Lasseter Family Winery in Glen Ellen, California. The property includes a narrow gauge railroad named the Justi Creek Railway, which is approximately long, including a train station and water tower Lasseter purchased from former Disney animator Ward Kimball. Their residence has a swimming pool with a lazy river that runs through a cave. Lasseter owns a collection of more than 1,000 Hawaiian shirts and wears one every day. Lasseter also collects classic cars, such as a black 1952 Jaguar XK120.

On May 2, 2009, Lasseter received an honorary doctorate from Pepperdine University, where he delivered the commencement address.

His influences include Walt Disney, Chuck Jones, Frank Capra, Hayao Miyazaki, and Preston Sturges. Lasseter&#x27;s favorite film is Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Dumbo&quot; (1941).

<doc id="1222786" wikidata="Q424328" url="?curid=1222786" title="Mimetite">
<text>Mimetite is a lead arsenate chloride mineral () which forms as a secondary mineral in lead deposits, usually by the oxidation of galena and arsenopyrite. The name derives from the Greek Μιμητής &quot;mimetes&quot;, meaning &quot;imitator&quot; and refers to mimetite&#x27;s resemblance to the mineral pyromorphite. This resemblance is not coincidental, as mimetite forms a mineral series with pyromorphite () and with vanadinite (). Notable occurrences are Mapimi, Durango, Mexico and Tsumeb, Namibia.

==Properties==

Mimetite is a lead chloride arsenate mineral with the composition . It is a secondary mineral, formed by oxidation of primary lead minerals in arsenic-bearing lead deposits. It typically forms short hexagonal crystals that are yellow to brown to orange in color, very brittle, moderately hard (Mohs hardness 3.5–4), and dense (specific gravity 7.24). It is distinctive for its lack of transparency, its resinous to adamantine luster, and its solubility in nitric acid.

Mimetite forms a complete solid solution series with pyromorphite, with phosphate () substituting for arsenate (). The two minerals are almost identical in their properties and can be difficult to distinguish except by laboratory tests. Pyromorphite is the more common mineral at most locales.

Campylite is a name applied to mimetite or pyromorphite that crystallizes as distinctive barrel-shaped crystals forming curved hemispherical aggregates. Bellite is a name formerly applied to a chromium-bearing mimetite, or possibly a mixture of crocoite, mimetite and quartz, which forms attractive orange red crystals, but has been discredited as a distinct mineral species.

<text>No. 220 Squadron of the Royal Air Force (RAF) was founded in 1918 and disbanded in 1963 after four separate periods of service. The squadron saw service in both the First and Second World Wars, as a maritime patrol unit, and finally as part of Britain&#x27;s strategic nuclear deterrent.

== History ==

=== First World War ===
The squadron predated the foundation of the RAF and was founded as a unit of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) . From 1915, the RNAS formed numbered wings, which controlled their own lettered squadrons. No. 2 Wing RNAS, with its subordinate squadrons, was assigned to the Aegean area. One of the squadrons was &#x27;C&#x27; Squadron, comprising Nos. 475, 476 and 477 Flights. DH.4s were, in time, joined by DH.9s and Sopwith Camels. On the formation of the RAF, on 1 April 1918, the Wing was integrated as No. 62 Wing RAF. The flights kept their numbers, rather than the customary letters, as each Flight operated a different aircraft type and the squadron formed a self-contained bomber, or reconnaissance, force with its own integral fighter cover. No. 475 Flight flew DH.4 day-bombers, No. 476 Flight flew DH.9 day-bombers and the fighter-flight, No. 477 Flight, flew Sopwith Camels. Most of the Wing was based at Mudros, but this squadron was based on the nearby island of Imbros. It was not given the &#x27;number-plate&#x27; of No. 220 Sqn., RAF until 14 September 1918. In February 1919 the squadron moved as a cadre to Mudros on the nearby island of Lemnos, where it was disbanded on 21 May 1919.

=== Second World War ===
In the buildup to the Second World War, No. 220 Squadron was reformed, as part of the new Coastal Command, at RAF Bircham Newton in Norfolk, during 1936. It was designated a general reconnaissance (GR) squadron, on maritime patrol duties, flying Avro Anson multi-role aircraft. On the outbreak of war it flew patrols from RAF Thornaby in Yorkshire, as part of No. 18 Group.

In November 1939, it converted to Lockheed Hudson an American light bomber and maritime patrol aircraft and began a new role, flying strike − or anti-shipping − missions. The squadron became operational in this role, in the North Sea, from May 1940 onwards. In April 1941, still in the anti-shipping role, it moved to RAF Wick in Scotland, to fly strikes against Norwegian coastal traffic.

In February 1942 the squadron began to operate the Boeing Fortress, an American four-engined heavy bomber, having moved to RAF Nutts Corner in Northern Ireland that month, as part of No. 15 Group. In June 1942 it moved to RAF Ballykelly, situated in County Londonderry, Northern Irelan, and then, in March 1943, to RAF Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides. Detachments also operated from RAF Bircham Newton, RAF St Eval in Cornwall and RAF Detling in Kent, during 1940, and even from RAF Shallufa in Egypt, from early November 1941.

In October 1943 the squadron transferred to RAF Lagens, in the Azores, as a unit of No. 247 Group. In December 1944, it was re-equipped with Consolidators Liberators, an American four-engines heavy bomber. From 1943 until the end of the war the squadron&#x27;s role was anti-submarine (ASW) patrols over the southern North Atlantic.

In June 1945, with the end of the war in Europe, the squadron was brought home. It was transferred to Transport Command and Flew trooping flights, bringing men home from India, from October 1945 to April 1946. With this duty done, the squadron was disbanded in May 1946.
===Cold War===
In September 1951 the squadron was reformed, back as part of Coastal Command and again operating in the maritime reconnaissance (MR) role. It was based at RAF St Mawgan in Cornwall and was equipped with Avro Shackleton, a long range maritime patrol aircraft. In 1953, the Squadron aircraft flew in formation in a flypast, on the occasion of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. At the time, the Avro Shackleton 
was fitted with a mid-upper gun-turret, the Bristol turret mounting twin 20 mm Hispano cannon, though this was later removed. No. 220 Squadron was the last RAF operational aircraft so equipped.

In October 1958, the squadron was redesignated as No. 201 Squadron.

The following year, in July 1959, No. 220 (SM) Squadron RAF was reformed. The designation &quot;SM&#x27;&quot; stood for Strategic Missile, and the squadron was now equipped with three Thor ballistic missiles, carrying a 1.4 megaton W-49 nuclear warhead, as part of the UK-US strategic deterrent, Project Emily. It was based at RAF North Pickenham in Norfolk until it was disbanded for the last time, along with the other Thor squadrons, in 1963.

<text>Epimysium (plural &quot;epimysia&quot;) (Greek &quot;epi-&quot; for on, upon, or above + Greek &quot;mys&quot; for muscle) is the fibrous tissue envelope that surrounds muscle. It is a layer of dense irregular connective tissue which ensheaths the entire muscle and protects muscles from friction against other muscles and bones. It also allows a muscle to contract and move powerfully while maintaining its structural integrity.

It is continuous with fascia and other connective tissue wrappings of muscle including the endomysium and perimysium. It is also continuous with tendons, where it becomes thicker and collagenous. 

While the epimysium is irregular on muscles, it is regular on tendons.

<text>Errol Barnett (born 3 April 1983) is a broadcaster on American television. The Emmy-award winner is a British-born American anchor and national correspondent for CBS News based in New York City. He anchors the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; solo&quot;.&quot; Previously he covered the Trump administration in Washington D.C., anchored &quot;CNN Newsroom&quot; and hosted the cultural affairs program &quot;Inside Africa&quot;. Barnett is regularly invited to discuss his reporting on global issues and solutions at major forums for organizations like the UN, the Milken Institute and the Smithsonian.

==Early life==
Errol Barnett was born in Milton Keynes, England to Michael Christie and Pamela, an English woman from Liverpool. Gladstone Christie, his Jamaican grandfather, was one of 500 Caribbean aircrew serving with the British Royal Air Force during WWII, afterward relocating to England as part of the Windrush generation. Barnett has English, German and Jamaican heritage. He has one older brother, Danny, and older sister, Natalie, who died.

His mother later married Gary Barnett, a US Air Force sergeant who served in the Gulf War before moving the family to Phoenix. After spending the first decade of his life in England, Barnett attended Garden Lakes Elementary and Westview High School, in Avondale, Arizona, before Channel One News hired him in 2001 relocating to Los Angeles.

==Channel One and UCLA==
The youth oriented Channel One hired Barnett, their youngest anchor/reporter at age 18, to work alongside Maria Menounos, Seth Doane, Gotham Chopra among others. While also in college, Barnett covered Barack Obama&#x27;s breakout DNC keynote speech, reported from the United Nations when Colin Powell presented flawed WMD intelligence and from the US Capitol during passage of the Homeland Security Act.

Barnett was chosen as one of &quot;Teen People&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;20 Teens Who Will Change The World&quot;. After being accepted to UCLA he left &quot;Channel One&quot; to complete his undergraduate studies. At UCLA Barnett received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science with a focus on international relations. After graduation he was hired by CNN.

==CNN (2008 - 2016)==

CNN initially assigned Barnett to report on the rise in influence of social media and in 2008 he was part of the most viewed streaming event in history during President Obama&#x27;s Inauguration on CNN.com. In 2010, he anchored at noon ET on CNN International from CNN Abu Dhabi focusing on the Arab Spring, which was part of the network&#x27;s Peabody-award winning coverage. As a CNN foreign correspondent, he was based in Johannesburg, South Africa covering the death of Nelson Mandela the Oscar Pistorius murder trial and various miner strikes.

===&quot;Inside Africa&quot;===
Barnett also hosted the network&#x27;s longest running feature program &quot;Inside Africa&quot; from 2011 to 2014. During his time at the helm of the award-winning show Barnett reported from twenty-two countries including Senegal, Morocco, Ethiopia, and Madagascar. The weekly half-hour documentary earned awards for its depiction of the continent, with Barnett styling the program as a &quot;journey of discovery.&quot;

===&quot;CNN Newsroom&quot;===
While based in Atlanta, Georgia Barnett anchored &quot;CNN Newsroom&quot; leading coverage of the Ferguson, Missouri protests, death of Robin Williams and the lead up to the 2016 presidential election. He became an Internet meme during coverage of protests with viewers noting Barnett&#x27;s response to his co-anchor&#x27;s suggestion that police use water cannons on demonstrators. Buzzfeed described Barnett&#x27;s &quot;side-eye&quot; expression as &quot;did that just happen&quot; and &quot;is this real life?&quot;

==CBS News (2016 - present)==
CBS News hired Barnett during the 2016 election as a Washington, D.C.–based correspondent and anchor appearing on &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;, the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; and &quot;Face the Nation.&quot; Currently, he is based in New York City as a national correspondent and solo anchor of &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; airing daily on the channel&#x27;s national streaming network. His coverage includes the Presidencies of Donald Trump and Joe Biden, artificial intelligence, extreme weather and various breaking news events. He also conducts high-interest interviews; his chat with Wikipedia&#x27;s top editor was viewed more than two million times.

===Secret Service incident===
In 2018, the Secret Service issued a rare statement after a viral interaction with Barnett, following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. As Barnett asked then-Presidential advisor Jared Kushner about his relationship with the Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, a Secret Service agent &quot;physically prevented&quot; him. As the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported, &quot;Barnett can be seen attempting to ask Kushner a question as he makes his way off the plane, before a Secret Service agent appears to block his way. Barnett can then be seen showing his CBS and White House press credentials to one of the agents, who responds, &#x27;I don’t give a damn who you are, there’s a time and a place.&#x27;&quot;

In response to the backlash, the USSS said, &quot;&quot;the actions were taken solely in response to an abrupt movement by an unknown individual who later identified themselves as a member of the media.&quot; On CNN&#x27;s &quot;The Lead with Jake Tapper&quot;, Barnett responded &quot;the video speaks for itself&quot;&quot;.

===Joe Biden interview===
During the 2020 U.S. Presidential election then-Vice President Joe Biden called Barnett a &quot;junkie&quot; in response to his question about cognitive abilities. As part of a joint virtual convention between NABJ and NAHJ, Barnett asked Biden if he had taken a cognitive test, as his opponent, President Donald Trump, insisted.

Biden replied, &quot;No, I haven’t taken a test. Why the hell would I take a test? Come on, man. That’s like saying to you, before you got on this program if you had taken a test, were you taking cocaine or not? What do you think, huh? Are you a junkie?&quot; Barnett pressed again to which Biden responded, &quot;Well, if he can’t figure out the difference between an elephant and a lion, I don’t know what the hell he’s talking about.&quot; The exchange was widely cited in the national press.

=== &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; ===
In 2024 Barnett was named solo anchor of the &quot;CBS Morning News,&quot; airing weekdays at 7a ET on the CBS streaming platform ahead of &quot;CBS Mornings.&quot; Forbes wrote this places &quot;Barnett in a class of anchors that include his colleagues Nate Burleson and Vladimir Duthiers, along with Craig Melvin, Al Roker, Bryant Gumbel, and Michael Strahan.&quot; Variety called him a &quot;veteran of CBS and CNN... who also worked as a fill-in on “CBS Mornings,” “CBS Saturday Morning” and the “CBS Weekend News,” and he has examined issues pertaining to technology, including documentary features examining  cryptocurrency mining and the growth of e-sports.&quot;

<doc id="1222810" wikidata="Q1675972" url="?curid=1222810" title="Ivan Smirnov (politician)">
<text>Ivan Nikitich Smirnov (; 1881 – 25 August 1936) was a Russian Bolshevik revolutionary, Soviet politician and Communist Party functionary. A prominent member of the Left Opposition, he led a secret Trotskyist opposition group in the Soviet Union during the Stalin period. He was arrested in 1933 and shot during the Great Purge.

== Political life ==
He was born in Gorodishche, Penza Governorate in a peasant family of Russian ethnicity.

In 1899, Smirnov joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party and became a Bolshevik. He led Party activity in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Vyshniy Volochok, Rostov, Kharkov, and Tomsk. Smirnov was subject to repeated arrests. In 1916, he was called up for army service in a reserve regiment in Tomsk. In 1917, he became a member of the executive committee of the Tomsk Soviet. In August of the same year, Smirnov was one of the organizers and managers of the Bolshevist publishing house &quot;Volna&quot; (Wave) in Moscow. He was a deputy of the Constituent Assembly. During the Russian Civil War, Smirnov was a member of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Eastern Front (August 1918–April 1919), and the 5th Army (April 1919–May 1920). Smirnov played a pivotal role in defeating the army of Alexander Kolchak during the war, and in the subsequent execution of Kolchak on 7 February 1920.

In 1920–1923, Smirnov was a member of the Executive Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). At the same time, he chaired the Siberian Revolutionary Committee and was a member of the Siberian bureau of the Party. Smirnov is known to have had close ties with the Cheka and administered massacres of the rebellious peasants in Tyumen and the Altai Mountains. He was the one to organize the capture of General Roman Ungern. In 1921–1922, Smirnov was a secretary of the Petrograd Committee and Northwestern Bureau of the Executive Committee of the Party. He was the closest associate of Grigory Zinoviev. Smirnov took part in mass executions and deportations from Petrograd of people of the &quot;exploiter class&quot;.

From April 1922 through July 1923, Smirnov was a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the National Economy (ВСНХ) of the RSFSR; from September 1922 through May 1923, its deputy chairman. In July 1923, Smirnov was appointed People&#x27;s Commissar for Soviet Postal Services and Telegraph.

In 1923, Smirnov became an active member of the Trotskyist opposition. In October 1923, Smirnov signed &quot;The Declaration of 46&quot;, which attacked by implication the influence of Joseph Stalin as General Secretary of the Party. After Lenin&#x27;s death in 1924, Smirnov publicly demanded removal of Stalin as General Secretary, but Stalin kept his position. 

In 1927, Smirnov signed the &quot;Declaration of the Eighty-three&quot;, another anti-Stalin manifesto. Stalin now moved against him. On 11 November 1927, Smirnov was removed from his Post and Telegraph position. A month later, he was expelled from the Party by the 15th Party Congress. On 31 December 1927, Smirnov was sentenced to three years of internal exile by the OGPU Board.

In October 1929, Smirnov &quot;broke with Trotskyism&quot; and was reinstated in the Party in May 1930. In 1929–1932, he was director of &quot;Saratovkombainstroy&quot;, the Combine harvester assembly plant in Saratov. In 1932, Smirnov was appointed head of the Department of Erection of New Buildings at the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Heavy Industry.

Then on 14 January 1933, Smirnov was arrested, and a month later again expelled from the Party, accused of forming an &quot;anti-party group&quot; in order to remove Stalin. Historian Pierre Broué showed that by the end of 1932 Smirnov had joined a clandestine bloc which Trotsky characterized as an alliance to fight Stalinist repression.

On 14 April 1933, he was sentenced to five years in labor camps. While still incarcerated, Smirnov was brought as a defendant in the &quot;United Anti-Soviet Trotskyite-Zinovievite Centre&quot; case. He was sentenced to death on 24 August 1936, and executed the next day. Smirnov was rehabilitated in 1988.It is clear.. that Trotsky did have a clandestine organization inside the USSR in this period and that he maintained communication with it. It is equally clear that a united oppositional bloc was formed in 1932.[...]From the available evidence, it seems that Trotsky envisioned no “terrorist” role for the bloc, although his call for a “new political revolution” to remove “the cadres, the bureaucracy” might well have been so interpreted in Moscow. There is also reason to believe that after the decapitation of the bloc through the removal of Zinoviev, Kamenev, Smirnov, and others the organization comprised mainly lower-level less prominent oppositionists: followers of Zinoviev, with whom Trotsky attempted to maintain direct contact. It is equally probable that the NKVD knew about the bloc. Trotsky’s and Sedov’s staffs were thoroughly infiltrated, and Sedov’s closest collaborator in 1936, Mark Zborowski, is said to have been an NKVD agent. In 1936, the 1932 bloc would be interpreted by the NKVD as a terrorist plot and would form the original pretext for Ezhov’s campaign to destroy the former opposition. Smirnov, Gol’tsman, Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Trotsky (in absentia) would be the defendants at the 1936 show trial, and the 1932 events would form the evidential basis for their prosecution.

<text>A metropole () is the homeland, central territory or the state exercising power over a colonial empire.
From the 19th century, the English term &quot;metropole&quot; was mainly used in the scope of the British, Spanish, French, Dutch, Portuguese, Japanese, and Ottoman empires to designate those empires&#x27; home territories, as opposed to their colonial or overseas territories.

==Roman Empire==
The metropole of the Roman Empire was Italy. Originally, Rome divided the Italics into three groups: Roman citizens, &quot;Latini&quot; (semi-citizens and semi-confederates), and socii (confederates). After 88 BC, all Italics were made Roman citizens. Italy continued to have this privileged status until 212 AD, when citizenship was extended to all the inhabitants of the Empire. From Caesar Augustus (27 BC) to Septimius Severus (192 AD), all Roman Emperors were Italics (Claudius, Trajan, and Hadrian, although born outside of Italy, were of Italian descent). Italy was legally distinguished from the provinces and the term &quot;Ius Italicum&quot; identified the Roman Italian privileges, especially when it came to taxation, which could be extended to certain communities outside of Italy under certain conditions. These privileges were ended by Emperor Diocletian, and from then on, Italy would lose tax exemptions and were subdivided into provinces.

==British Empire==
The metropole of the British Empire was the island of Great Britain; i.e. the United Kingdom itself. The term is sometimes used even more specifically to refer to London as the metropole of the Empire, insofar as the politicians and businessmen of London exerted the greatest influence throughout the Empire in both diplomatic, economic and military forms. By contrast, the term periphery referred to the rest of the Empire.

The historiography of British metropole–periphery relations has traditionally been defined in terms of their distinct separation, with a pronouncedly one-way, metropole-directed chain of command, communication, and control proceeding outward from the centre; the metropole informed the periphery, but the periphery did not directly inform the metropole. Hence, the British Empire was constituted by the formal control of territories, by direct rule of foreign lands, which were ruled by the metropole.

More recent work, starting with that of John &quot;Jack&quot; Gallagher and Ronald Robinson in the 1950s, has questioned the traditional definition, positing instead that the two were mutually constitutive and maintaining that, despite the apparent temporal inconsistencies inherent in their separate existences, each formed simultaneously in relation to the other. Gallagher and Robinson were socialists, observing the rise of the economic power of the United States in the developing world at a time when the African colonies of the British Empire were being granted independence; both scholars held that British and American expansion of overseas influence were ultimately developed along similar lines.

According to the theories of Gallagher and Robinson, the usage of soft power by the British, primarily through employment of British capital and other forms of economic influence allowed for the establishment of favorable economic relationships and free trade for goods which were manufactured in Britain. In doing this, Britain was able to gain the benefits of Empire without spending money on costly military affairs. In this interpretation, the &quot;informal empire&quot; of the British was a defining part of the metropole just as much as the &quot;formal empire&quot;.

==Portuguese Empire==
In the scope of the Portuguese Empire, the metropole was the European part of Portugal, which included Continental Portugal (the mainland) and the adjacent islands (Azores and Madeira). It corresponded to the present territory of Portugal.

Until the mid 19th century, the Portuguese European territory was referred to as &quot;Portugal&quot; or as the &quot;Kingdom&quot;. However, these terms became inappropriate when the Portuguese overseas territories gained the status of overseas provinces in 1832, and came to be considered an integral part of the Kingdom of Portugal alongside its European provinces. The use of the term &quot;Metrópole&quot; emerged then as the official designation of the European part of Portugal. From then on, and until the independence of most of the remaining Portuguese overseas territories in 1975, Portugal included the Metrópole and the Overseas.

== Metropolitan France ==

Metropolitan France (), also known as European France () is the area of France which is geographically in Europe.

Metropolitan France comprises mainland France and Corsica, as well as nearby islands in the Atlantic Ocean, the English Channel () and the Mediterranean Sea.

In contrast, overseas France is the collective name for all the French territories outside Europe.

<text>Clintonite is a calcium magnesium aluminium phyllosilicate mineral. It is a member of the margarite group of micas and the subgroup often referred to as the &quot;brittle&quot; micas. Clintonite has the chemical formula . Like other micas and chlorites, clintonite is monoclinic in crystal form and has a perfect basal cleavage parallel to the flat surface of the plates or scales. The Mohs hardness of clintonite is 6.5, and the specific gravity is 3.0 to 3.1. It occurs as variably colored, colorless, green, yellow, red, to reddish-brown masses and radial clusters.

The brittle micas differ chemically from the micas in containing less silica and no alkalis, and from the chlorites in containing much less water; in many respects, they are intermediate between the micas and chlorites. Clintonite and its iron-rich variety xanthophyllite are sometimes considered the calcium analogues of the phlogopites.

Typical formation environment is in serpentinized dolomitic limestone and contact metamorphosed skarns. It occurs with talc, spinel, grossular, vesuvianite, clinopyroxene, monticellite, chondrodite, phlogopite, chlorite, quartz, calcite and dolomite.

Clintonite was first described in 1843 for an occurrence in Orange County, New York. It was named for De Witt Clinton (1769–1828).

<doc id="1222822" wikidata="Q4836491" url="?curid=1222822" title="BR Standard Class 4 4-6-0">
<text>The British Railways Standard Class 4 [[4-6-0]] is a class of steam locomotives, 80 of which were built during the 1950s. Six have been preserved.

==Background==

The class was introduced in 1951. They were designed for mixed traffic use on secondary routes where the otherwise ubiquitous BR Standard Class 5 and their predecessors, the Black Fives, would be too heavy. They were essentially a tender version of the Class 4 2-6-4T, with similar characteristics to the GWR 7800 Class, though unlike the 7800s they were built to the universal loading gauge. They used the same running gear as the tank engine (with the leading bogie from the Standard Class 5), and substantially the same firebox, smokebox and boiler, although the boiler barrel was increased in length by .

Design work was done at Brighton by R. A. Riddles, with help from Swindon, Derby and Doncaster. Construction was at the BR Swindon Works.

The engine weighed , was long, with diameter driving wheels. It had two cylinders of diameter and stroke operated at maximum boiler pressure of , to produce tractive effort. Its British Railways power classification was 4MT.

It normally used the standard BR2 or BR2A tender, which weighed and carried of water and of coal. In this configuration its route availability was 4, almost universal over the British Railways network.

==In service==
The class was initially allocated to the London Midland Region (45) and the Western Region (20). The last 15 were allocated to the Southern Region. The Southern batch were built with BR1B tenders, which weighed , and carried of water and of coal. This reduced their route availability to 7, the same as the Standard Class 5.

== Preservation ==
Six members of the class survive with both single chimney and double chimney examples. Two were purchased directly from BR (75027 &amp; 75029); the remaining four were rescued from Woodham Brothers&#x27; scrapyard at Barry Island.

No member of the class is presently main line approved but three (75014, 75029 and 75069) have worked on the main line at various points in preservation. 75029 was passed to work on the main line between Grosmont and Whitby with occasional visits to Battersby during galas. All except for 75079 have operated in preservation.

==Model railways==
Bachmann and Hornby have both released models of these engines in 00 gauge. Mainline Railways also released a OO gauge model of the Standard Class 4MT 4-6-0 in the 1970s, although this is no longer in production. In 1983, Mainline&#x27;s model was reintroduced to their catalogue as locomotive 75033 in BR lined black.

<doc id="1222827" wikidata="Q7284563" url="?curid=1222827" title="Rainbow (TV series)">
<text>Rainbow is a British children&#x27;s television series, created by Pamela Lonsdale, which ran from 16 October 1972 until 6 March 1992, made by Thames Television. The series was revived by Tetra Films from 10 January 1994 until 24 March 1997, in two different formats from the original Thames Television series, with differing cast members. The series was originally conceived as a British equivalent of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. 

The British series was developed in house by Thames Television, and had no input from the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop. It was intended to develop language and social skills for pre-school children and went on to win the Society of Film and Television Arts Award for Best Children&#x27;s Programme in 1975. It aired five times weekly, originally twice weekly on Mondays and Wednesdays, then switched to Tuesdays and Fridays, and finally once weekly at 12:10 on Fridays on the ITV network.

The show had three producers over its lifetime – Pamela Lonsdale, Charles Warren and Joe Boyer.

The original Thames series has gained cult status and continues to get frequent mentions on radio and television. A few DVDs have been produced, including one celebrating &quot;30 Years of Rainbow&quot;.

==Premise==
Each episode of &quot;Rainbow&quot; revolved around a particular activity or situation that arose in the Rainbow House, where the main characters lived. Some episodes, particularly in the early years, were purely educational in format and consisted of a series of scenes involving the characters learning about that particular episode&#x27;s subject. The puppet characters of Zippy, George and Bungle would take the role of inquisitive children asking about the episode&#x27;s subject, with the presenter (initially David Cook, and from 1974 onwards Geoffrey Hayes) serving the role of teacher figure, educating them about the subject. From the 1980s onwards, most episodes were more story-driven and frequently involved some kind of squabble or dispute between the puppet characters of Zippy, George and Bungle, and Geoffrey&#x27;s attempts to calm them down and keep the peace.

The main story was interspersed with songs (most notably from Rod, Jane and Freddy, although the musicians on the show changed several times during its run), animations by Cosgrove Hall Productions and stories read from the &quot;Rainbow&quot; storybook, usually by Geoffrey (David before 1974). Some episodes focused on a particular topic, such as sounds or opposites, and consisted mainly of short sketches or exchanges between the main characters, rather than a consistent storyline.

==History==
In 1972, Pamela Lonsdale was asked to create a preschool series for Thames Television. She cast John Kane as presenter and Tim Wylton as a bear named Rainbow. Violet Philpott was cast as the puppeteer of Zippy, with Peter Hawkins providing his voice, as well as those of Sunshine, Bramble and Pillar, however policy changes after the pilot meant those latter characters were recast. No script was made for the pilot, which led to Hawkins attempting to rewrite gags, difficult for the preschool audience, and would lead to him departing the show after its first year, recommending Roy Skelton to take over. For the first two filmed series, the show was presented by David Cook, with John Leeson as Rainbow, renamed Bungle, and featured songs by the group Telltale.

Philpott would leave the series after its first year due to suffering a back injury from Zippy’s appearances all being through a window. She was replaced by John Thirtle for the second series, and Ronnie Le Drew from 1974 onto the present day. Cook left afterwards due to focusing on his writing career, and was replaced by Geoffrey Hayes. John Leeson would also leave at this point, replaced as Bungle by Stanley Bates, and Telltale were replaced by the trio of Charlie Dore, Julian Littman and Karl Johnson, who the following year were replaced by the trio that would eventually become Rod, Jane and Freddy. The second series would also introduce George, operated by Valerie Herberden and voiced by Roy Skelton. Bungle&#x27;s appearance was also changed significantly with a completely different head design, more like a teddy bear than the previous grizzly bear look.

Herberden was replaced by Malcolm Lord as George’s puppeteer, who Ronnie Le Drew recommended. The format of the show was significantly built upon during this era, with the scripts began to move beyond the educational format of the show and focus more on actual storylines, driven by character comedy rather than educational themes. More of the episodes were written by the cast members themselves, with Roy Skelton, Stanley Bates, Geoffrey Hayes and Freddy Marks all contributing a significant number of episodes to the show.

In 1989, Rod, Jane &amp; Freddy left the show to concentrate on their own TV series and their touring. Rather than replace them, most episodes ditched the song feature altogether and the episodes became increasingly storyline-driven. Stanley Bates also left the show at this time although he continued to contribute as a scriptwriter, with George&#x27;s puppeteer Malcolm Lord replacing him in the role of Bungle. George was now operated by Tony Holtham.

Although the show remained extremely popular with both children and adults, it finally came to an end in 1992 when Thames Television lost the London weekday ITV franchise to Carlton Television. Despite this, the cast continued to make frequent TV appearances throughout 1993, guesting on numerous talk shows as well as promoting the release of the &quot;Raynboe&quot; dance single by Eurobop (a mix of the theme tune set to a techno dance beat) and launching a newspaper campaign for the show to be brought back on air.

Following the nationwide newspaper campaign to bring &quot;Rainbow&quot; back on air, a reboot of the show was announced by Tetra Films in late 1993 and debuted on Children&#x27;s ITV in on 10 January 1994. The reboot of the show reworked the format enormously as well as replacing nearly all of the cast members. Geoffrey&#x27;s presenter role was scrapped altogether and the show instead focused on the characters of Zippy, George and Bungle, now independent of Geoffrey, running a toy shop for an unseen boss called Mr Top. Tetra could not afford Roy Skelton to voice Zippy as well as hiring Ronnie Le Drew to operate him, so Ronnie became Zippy’s voice, while George was operated and voiced by Craig Crane. Bungle&#x27;s appearance was changed radically and he was now played by Richard Robinson. An additional puppet character was also introduced in the form of Cleo, a blue female rabbit voiced and operated by Gillian Robic. Cleo&#x27;s role was unclear, with some episodes portraying her as a mere customer to the shop, others as a nosy neighbour and others as a playmate for Zippy and George.

After the poor reception to the first reboot, Tetra Films attempted a second reboot in 1996 in association with HTV, reworking the format again into a form closer to that of the original series. Now titled &quot;Rainbow Days&quot;, the new show ditched the toy shop setting and brought the characters back into a house environment, and reintroduced the role of the presenter, with Dale Superville now presenting the show. The character of Cleo was scrapped entirely, and Bungle&#x27;s role was now played by Paul Cullinan. &quot;Rainbow Days&quot; re-embraced the &#x27;variety show&#x27; format of the original series, generally focusing on an educational subject and consisting of scenes with Dale educating the puppet characters about the episode&#x27;s subject, interspersed with comedic exchanges between Zippy and George in a similar style to the &#x27;Sunshine and Moony&#x27; sketches from the earliest seasons, and songs performed by the whole cast, led by Dale.

Although Roy Skelton and Geoffrey Hayes died in 2011 and 2018 respectively, the characters of Zippy, George and Bungle still make the occasional TV appearances to the present day.

==Theme song==
The theme song for the show was actually a small part of the full version, also called &quot;Rainbow&quot; and written by Hugh Portnow, Lady Hornsbrie, Hugh Fraser and Tim Thomas of the band Telltale, who regularly appeared in the first two seasons of the show. It was released as a single on an offshoot of the Music for Pleasure label called Surprise, Surprise in 1973 with the B-side &quot;Windy Day&quot;. Although Telltale left the show in 1974, their recording of the theme tune continued to be used until the end of the original show&#x27;s run in 1992.

==Characters==

&quot;Rainbow&quot; featured the following characters, each with their own character style:

*The presenter was at first David Cook, but was replaced in 1974 by the best-known presenter Geoffrey Hayes. He brought the other members of the Rainbow household to order or gave them something to do. He acted as the symbol of adult wisdom, and rarely demonstrated overt affection to any of the three puppet characters, acting more as a carer/teacher than a father. While bright and cheery by default, Geoffrey occasionally became exasperated and flustered by the misbehaviour of the puppet characters, and a lot of the comedy in the later episodes revolved around him showing a grumpier side and occasionally losing his temper. There were infrequent mentions of his life outside of the Rainbow household, such as girlfriends, while several episodes stated that Geoffrey had a day job, apparently working in an office during weekdays.
*Zippy – loud and domineering, but usually very funny (albeit not to the other characters in the show). The puppet was originally voiced by Peter Hawkins and operated by Violet Philpott and later voiced by Roy Skelton and Ronnie Le Drew – Hawkins and Skelton were voice artists also well known for voicing Daleks and Cybermen in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Le Drew operated Zippy after 1974. Zippy&#x27;s mouth is a zip, and when he became too bossy or irritating, this was zipped shut to prevent him from continuing: on at least one occasion he unzipped himself, though he appears unable to do so on other occasions or simply submits to this punishment. He broadly represented childhood self-centeredness, &quot;naughtiness&quot; and extroversion. Zippy was extremely boastful and would frequently brag about his superior intelligence and singing skill (both of which proved to be completely unfounded when put to the test) and was also greedy, often overeating and displaying a particular love for chocolate and sweets.
*George – a shy, pink and slightly camp hippo. He broadly represented sensitivity and introversion. (puppet; voiced by Roy Skelton and operated by Malcolm Lord, Tony Holtham and later Craig Crane). George first appeared in 1973, introduced as a shy friend of Zippy&#x27;s who was afraid of being seen or heard, usually crouching very low behind the window pane and rarely speaking, preferring to make funny noises. In subsequent seasons George gradually became more bold and spoke more, though he remained predominantly shy and timid. The most generally well-behaved and well-meaning of the puppet characters, George often found himself caught between Zippy and Bungle&#x27;s squabbling, and his good nature taken advantage of by the other characters. Although mostly introverted, several episodes reveal that he aspires to be a singer.
*Bungle – a brown furry bear with a squashed face, who is inquisitive but also clumsy and usually complains a lot about the other characters, especially Zippy&#x27;s antics. He broadly represented conformity. Although on the surface he appears well-behaved and sensible, Bungle has a very sneaky side and a tendency to suck up to authority, making him frequently just as troublesome as Zippy, if not more so. The polar opposites of Zippy and Bungle&#x27;s personalities are the source of much humour. Unlike Zippy and George, Bungle is a costume rather than a puppet; played by John Leeson, Stanley Bates and Malcolm Lord in the Thames TV series and by Richard Robinson and Paul Cullinan in the reboot. The stunt double in the late 90s was Stuart Nichol. Although unclothed most of the time, he wraps a towel around his waist after a shower and also wears tartan pyjamas at bedtime. His friends would on occasion put his bed in the shower if he was not vigilant. The original 1972 costume resembled a wild brown bear, but in 1973 this was replaced with a new design resembling a teddy bear. The costume design underwent another overhaul upon Bates assuming the role in 1974 with an all brown pelt (instead of the previous brown/white) slimmer torso and further modified face.
*Rod, Jane and Freddy – a group of musicians who regularly featured on the show. When they debuted in 1974 they were &#x27;Rod, Jane and Matt&#x27;, Matt being Matthew Corbett (of &quot;The Sooty Show&quot; fame). Matt was replaced from 1977 by Roger Walker, before Freddy Marks, in turn, took over in 1981. Although initially confined to the song segment of the show, gradually Rod, Jane &amp; Freddy began to feature more heavily in the episode&#x27;s storylines during the show&#x27;s run, often playing significant roles in the plot. Some of the early 80s episodes stated they lived in the Rainbow House and they were shown to have a bedroom of their own, although later episodes implied they lived next door. Rod, Jane &amp; Freddy were very well-respected and looked up to by Zippy, George and Bungle, who admired their singing and rarely ever got into any conflict with them.
*Sunshine and Moony – optimistic sunshine (yellow with a red hat) and his more gloomy friend Moony (brown with a tuft of yellow hair) were the original &#x27;stars&#x27; of the programme, but soon became little more than foils to the more popular Zippy. They would occupy short sketches in the early episodes, the humour coming from the boastful, extroverted Sunshine winding up the more modest, cynical Moony, in a loose parallel of the later relationship between Zippy and George. They were phased out by 1974, in favour of greater roles for Bungle and (especially) George. They were voiced by Violet Philpott.
*Telltale – a six-piece group who provided the music in the early days of the show. They were a folk-rock band and their repertoire would consist of both original compositions and cover versions.
* Charlie Dore, Julian Littman and Karl Johnson – the singing trio who replaced Telltale in 1974. They stayed with the show before being replaced by Rod, Matt &amp; Jane in 1975. Charlie Dore and Julian Littman went on to have hugely successful music careers, while Karl Johnson became a well-known actor.
*Duffy – a white sheepdog. Zippy&#x27;s short-lived original sidekick for a handful of episodes circa 1972. Replaced by George in the 1973 series.
*Zippo – Zippy&#x27;s cousin, identical in appearance to Zippy but slightly brighter in colour, who would make the occasional guest appearance throughout the 80s and 90s seasons. Originally portrayed as an eloquent Frenchman, but a later episode depicted him as an American-accented rapper with loud, flashy clothing. Operated by Valerie Heberden, and voiced by Roy Skelton.
*Georgette – a pink female hippo, identical in appearance to George except for her longer eyelashes and floppy hat. She appears in the 1986 episode &quot;Falling Out and Making Up&quot; in which she moves into the house next door to the Rainbow House and immediately gets along well with George. Despite her close resemblance to George in appearance and name, this appears to be nothing more than sheer coincidence.
*Dawn – the next-door neighbour, played by Dawn Bowden, who was introduced in the show&#x27;s later years, first appearing in 1990. Dawn would often visit the Rainbow House to help out with everyday chores and socialize with the characters, as well as performing songs with the rest of the cast on her Casio keyboard.
* Aunty – played by Patsy Rowlands, is apparently Geoffrey&#x27;s aunt, who he used to stay with as a little boy. Aunty comes round to visit in several episodes, while in others the cast visit her. Aunty is a very old-fashioned woman, which occasionally exasperates the puppet characters, although they enjoy her company nonetheless.
* Christopher – played by Christopher Lillicrap, a semi-regular guest star who would guest on the show from time to time since the 70s, at first to read stories and later to perform songs, which the main cast would join in with.
* Vince – played by Vince Hill, a singer who would occasionally visit the Rainbow House and join in a song with Rod, Jane &amp; Freddy. One episode portrayed him as a kind of &#x27;Geoffrey&#x27; figure for Zippo when he showed up with Zippo to a garden party.

Generally speaking, George and Zippy represented two &#x27;types&#x27; of a child, George being the quiet and shy type, while Zippy represented the hyperactive and destructive type. Zippy often demonstrated a cynicism and wit that went beyond the &quot;4th wall&quot; and appealed to older viewers. George was usually vindicated, and Zippy got his comeuppance. While they were apparently young &#x27;children&#x27; (aged around 6), Bungle was an older &#x27;child&#x27; (aged around 8), and differed from them in being a costume rather than a hand puppet. Geoffrey&#x27;s relationship to them was unclear, other than being a kind of mentor/teacher/carer.

==The &quot;adult&quot; version==

In 1979, the cast and crew of &quot;Rainbow&quot; made a special exclusive sketch for the Thames TV staff Christmas tape, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Twangers&quot; episode. This sketch featured plenty of deliberate sexual innuendo (beginning with Zippy peeling a banana, saying &#x27;One skin, two skin, three skin...&#x27; before being interrupted by George), and was never shown at the time (as it was never intended to be screened to the general public.) The cast later sang &quot;The Plucking Song&quot;.

The clip became famous after being aired on Victor Lewis-Smith&#x27;s Channel 4 programme &quot;TV Offal&quot; (1997) and was referred to as &#x27;the pilot episode&#x27; in order to fit into the regular programme segment &quot;The Pilots That Crashed&quot;; however, the clip clearly was not a pilot, as Geoffrey Hayes was not a regular presenter until the series itself was a year old. The clip became widespread with the increasing popularity of the Internet, first as an e-mail attachment and later via online video websites such as YouTube. This has led to many erroneous claims that the episode was publicly broadcast as a regular episode.

&quot;TV Offal&quot; also broadcast some very risqué material featuring Hayes, Zippy and George as guests on a variety programme hosted by comedian Jim Davidson in the 1980s; the sketch in question featured former children&#x27;s TV presenter Tommy Boyd asking a question about Adam and Eve. Boyd and Davidson used some profanities in the sketch, along with some innuendo from George (presumably again not intended for broadcast like the above), and Zippy exclaimed to Geoffrey an expletive phrase quite out of character from his children&#x27;s television persona. (Incidentally, the said footage appeared uncut on Thames Television&#x27;s 1984 Christmas tape.)

A previous repeat run took place on UK Gold (now Gold) from its launch in November 1992 to 1994; these were mostly from the last three years of the programme (without Rod, Jane and Freddy).

<text>Reading Minster, or the Minster Church of St Mary the Virgin, is the oldest ecclesiastical foundation in the town of Reading, Berkshire, England. Although eclipsed in importance by the later Reading Abbey, Reading Minster regained its status after the destruction of the Abbey and is now an Anglican parish church.

The minster gives its name to the street of St Mary&#x27;s Butts, on which it stands. The Minster Church of St Mary the Virgin should not be mistaken for the similarly named St Mary&#x27;s Church, Castle Street, which is only a few yards away.

== History ==


According to unverified tradition, Saint Birinus founded a small chapel on the site of Reading Minster in the 7th century. Silver coins of the 9th century have been found in the churchyard, dating back to the period when Kings Ethelred and Alfred of Wessex were fighting the Danes at Reading, and also the era in which Reading supplanted Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester) as the local centre of importance.

In 979, Queen Ælfthryth, wife of King Edgar of England, founded a royal nunnery on the site as an act of repentance for the murder of her stepson, King Edward the Martyr. All that remains of this nunnery is a rounded Saxon door in the church, most likely used by the nuns to attend church services. In the 11th century, the Danes sacked Reading and the nunnery was destroyed. By the time of the Domesday Book, the church had been granted to Battle Abbey by William the Conqueror.

In 1121, King Henry I founded Reading Abbey which grew to become one of the most important religious and political centres of England. For the following 400 years the Abbey was the centre of ecclesiastical power in the town, and the Abbot also held the post of Rector of St Mary&#x27;s. In 1371 a chantry was established by Edward III which the Mayor of Reading administered for the chapel.

The main body of the church dates from the late 11th Century, however in 1539, the Abbey was dissolved on the orders of King Henry VIII. In the Reformation that followed, St Mary&#x27;s church was stripped of its altar, statues and stained glass, and by 1550 was in need of extensive repair. Between the years of 1551 and 1555 the church was extensively restored, using quantities of masonry and timber from the ruins of the Abbey. Contemporary accounts include payments for the dismantling and carriage of the Abbey&#x27;s choir and nave roof, and is believed that the pillars which now separate the Minster&#x27;s south aisle from the nave came from the Abbey. The baptismal font stands on the plinth of an earlier font and dates to 1616. A gift from the Vachell family, it is octagonal in shape and is carved with the arms of the Vachell, Knollys and Reades families who intermarried. Some of the carved shields represent Tudor roses and originally would have been painted in their heraldic colours. On the north wall of the chancel is an impressive black-and-gold monument to William Kendricke and his wife dated 1635. William Kendricke was churchwarden at the Minster from 1607 to 1610 and was a considerable benefactor of the church.

In 1918 a war memorial chapel, known as St Edwards Chapel, was added with entry through the old Saxon doorway of the nunnery. The church had undergone further restoration in 1863 when a new choir aisle was added, and in 1872; with further work in 1935 and 1997–2003.

==Bells==
Most of the bells now hung in the Minster&#x27;s tower date from the 17th and 18th centuries. The present peal consists of three dated 1640, two dated 1740 and two dated 1743. In 1611 the first clock was installed in the tower.

==Organ==

The Minster&#x27;s organ dates was built by Father Willis for the 1862 International Exhibition. It was rebuilt by the same company in 1936. In the early 21st century, the church began a project to restore the organ. The organ was largely neglected throughout the 20th century, leaving pipes corroded, the bellows damaged and the soundboards warped. The restoration requires a fund of approximately £500,000 and aims to replace the wind system, electronics and manuals.

==Churchyard==
The churchyard extends to the south and east of the church, and is bounded by the streets of St Mary&#x27;s Butts, Gun Street, Chain Street and by an unnamed footpath connecting St Mary&#x27;s Butts and Chain Street along the rear building line of the buildings fronting Broad Street. It is crossed by several other paths which carry heavy pedestrian traffic between various town centre areas. The churchyard contains a number of significant trees, including a 150-year old Indian Bean Tree (&quot;Catalpa bignonioides&quot;) that was thought, in 2007, to be unlikely to survive, but has since sprouted new growth.

Also to be found in the churchyard is the &quot;Jubilee Cross&quot;, built in 1887 to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The monument is constructed in a 15th-century style in Portland stone, and has a tapering octagonal shaft capped by a cross. It is listed as a Grade II listed building. It has been suggested that it was constructed in reaction to the secular design of the nearby &quot;Jubilee Drinking Fountain&quot; that also celebrates the same anniversary and is located only a few feet away in the centre of St Mary&#x27;s Butts.

<text>Gao Xianzhi or Go Seonji (died January 24, 756) was a Tang dynasty general of Goguryeo descent. He was known as a great commander during his lifetime. He is best known for taking part in a number of military expeditions to conquer the Western Regions, over the Pamir Mountains and reaching as far as the Talas River. In 751 he commanded the Tang forces during the Battle of Talas, fighting against the Abbasid Caliphate. The Tang defeat at the Talas River is considered to mark the end of both Tang western expansion and Abbasid eastern expansion.

Around the beginning of the year 756, Gao and fellow general Feng Changqing offended the powerful eunuch Bian Lingcheng (邊令誠) while defending the Tong Pass against the rebel An Lushan, who had rebelled in 755. Bian then accused Feng of cowardice and Gao of corruption, and both were executed.

==Early life==
Gao Xianzhi was the son of Go Sagye, a Goguryeo general. Goguryeo was defeated by Tang Dynasty in 668 AD and Go Sagye was captured by the Tang army, which he then served under.

Gao Xianzhi was born in Tang&#x27;s western regions. Historical records state that Gao Xianzhi was neither muscular nor particularly strong like other army officers and his father was constantly concerned about his son&#x27;s poor health. However, he demonstrated great courage from an early age and possessed skills in horseriding and archery.

Gao Xianzhi&#x27;s loyalty and bravery allowed him to net the position of general by his 20s and served with his father in Kashgar under the Protectorate General to Pacify the West. He successively served under the jiedushi Tian Renwan (田仁琬) and Gai Jiayun (蓋嘉運), but received no further promotions. However, Gai&#x27;s successor Fumeng Lingcha (夫蒙靈詧) was impressed by him, and repeatedly recommended him to his superiors. By the end of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang&#x27;s &quot;Kaiyuan&quot; era (727-741), Gao was serving as Fumeng&#x27;s deputy.

==First western campaign==
At that time, Lesser Bolü, a city state around modern Gilgit, Pakistan, was allied with the Tibetan Empire, and 20 city states around it also became Tibetan vassals. A Tibetan princess became the wife and queen of Lesser Bolü&#x27;s king. Tian Renwan, Gai Jiayun, and Fumeng Lingcha had all tried to attack Lesser Bolü in the past, but were unable to defeat it. In 747, Gao Xianzhi led a three-pronged attack of 10,000 cavalry soldiers, surprising both Lesser Bolü and its Tibetan garrisons. Lesser Bolü&#x27;s king and queen were captured and brought back to Tang.

However, Fumeng grew angry with Gao for directly reporting news of the victory to Emperor Xuanzong without first reporting to him, and threatened to kill him. The eunuch Bian Lingcheng, whom Xuanzong had sent to monitor Gao&#x27;s forces, interceded on Gao&#x27;s behalf and reported Fumeng&#x27;s threats to Xuanzong. Xuanzong, in response, summoned Fumeng back to the capital Chang&#x27;an in the new year of 748 and promoted Gao to take over his position. Gao arrested several of Fumeng&#x27;s subordinates for attacking him—fellow deputy military governor Cheng Qianli (程千里), and army officers Bi Sichen (畢思琛) and Wang Tao (王滔)—but then released them and allowed them to continue serving under him. He entrusted Feng Changqing as his assistant, often having Feng lead troops or, when he himself led troops in campaigns, had Feng in charge of the headquarters. Li Siye also first distinguished himself as an army officer under Gao.

As a result of Gao&#x27;s first successful campaign, Tang began to contend for influence with the Abbasid Caliphate and Tibetan Empire in the area of modern northern Pakistan and Afghanistan. Around 72 regional Indian and Sogdian kingdoms became Tang vassals, ending the Tibetan dominion of the Pamir Mountains. During his service as jiedushi of Anxi, places such as Tokmak, Kucha, and Kashmir came under the protectorate&#x27;s jurisdiction.

== Second campaign and Battle of Talas ==
In late 749, Shilidaqieluo (失里怛伽羅), a prince of the Tuhuoluo (吐火羅, possibly Tocharians), reported to Tang that the king of Qieshi (朅師, the present day Chitral valley in Northern Pakistan), had been aligned with Tufan in pinning down Chinese forces stationed at Lesser Bolü, and suggested that Emperor Xuanzong send forces the region. In spring 750, Xuanzong sent Gao Xianzhi to attack Qieshi. Its king Botemo (勃特沒) was captured and Botemo&#x27;s son Sujia (素迦) was crowned king. Gao then made a peace treaty with the state of Shi (石國, modern Tashkent, Uzbekistan) and once Shi stood down its defenses, attacked it without warning. The Shi king Chebishi (車鼻施) was captured and sent to Chang&#x27;an to be executed. This angered the nearby states, particularly after Gao slaughtered the old and weak captives. Gao also personally profited from the looting in battle—a large supply of diamonds, several camel-loads of gold, prized horses, and other treasures. In spring 751, Gao personally visited Chang&#x27;an, and, for his contributions, Xuanzong gave him the honorific title &quot;Kaifu Yitong Sansi&quot; (開府儀同三司) and was poised to move him to Hexi where the jiedushi An Sishun resisted to be ousted. However Xuanzong decided to allow An to remain at Hexi and Gao to remain at Anxi.

Meanwhile, a Shi prince had fled to the various states around the region and told them of Gao&#x27;s treachery, causing them to align with the Abbasids. When Gao heard this, he made a pre-emptory attack with 30,000 soldiers against Abbasids, reaching a town of Atlakh (in modern Talas region of Kyrgyzstan) near the city of Talas (in modern Kazakhstan) and meeting Abbasid forces there. The armies fought bitterly for five days before the Turkic speaking Karluks turned against Gao. Tang forces were crushed and only a few thousand survived due to the efforts of Li Siye. Another subordinate of Gao who distinguished himself at the battle was Duan Xiushi, whom Gao recommended for promotion after the battle. The Talas conflict marked the end of Tang advances to the west, and the heavy losses by Abbasid forces despite the victory appeared to end Abbasid designs in the east as well. Gao was then made a commanding general of the imperial guards and Wang Zhengjian replaced him as jiedushi of Anxi. In 755, Gao was created the Duke of Miyun.

==Death==
In 755, An Lushan, the jiedushi of Fanyang (范陽, headquartered in modern Beijing), rebelled against the Tang. Emperor Xuanzong nominally commissioned his son, Li Wan (李琬) the Prince of Rong, the commander of the forces against An&#x27;s rebels, and put Gao Xianzhi in charge as Li Wan&#x27;s deputy. Gao gathered 50,000 soldiers from the Chang&#x27;an region and took up position at Shang Commandery (陝郡, roughly modern Sanmenxia, Henan). Bian Lingcheng was made Gao&#x27;s monitor.
Meanwhile, Feng Changqing was sent to the eastern capital Luoyang to prepare its defenses, but once Feng discovered upon arriving that he was given inadequate weapon supplies, and was defeated by the An army. Feng retreated to Shan, and suggested to Gao that Shan could not be easy defended, and so they should retreat to Tong Pass, which was a more suitable defensive position. Gao agreed, and the two of them took up position at Tong Pass. When An&#x27;s forces attacked Tong Pass, they failed, and historians credited Gao with the improved defenses.

However, during the campaign, Gao had caused much offence against Bian, as Bian was making demands of him that he was not meeting. When Bian returned to Chang&#x27;an, he accused Feng of exaggerating An&#x27;s strength, and accused Gao of improperly abandoning Shan as well as corruptly withholding food supplies and imperial rewards to soldiers for personal benefit. Xuanzong, believing Bian, issued edicts for Feng&#x27;s and Gao&#x27;s executions. After Bian returned to Tong Pass, he first read the edict for Feng&#x27;s execution. Feng was beheaded, and upon the completion of that execution, Bian then read the second edict ordering Gao&#x27;s execution. Gao cried out:

The soldiers cried out for Gao as well, but Bian still beheaded Gao. As Gao was to be killed, he looked at Feng&#x27;s body and stated:

==Legacy==
Gao&#x27;s defeat, which marked the end of Tang&#x27;s expansion to the west, was partially fictionalized by the modern Chinese historian Bo Yang in the short story &quot;The Tashkent Massacre—the Chinese Were Cursed Here!&quot;, in which he gave a fictional curse by the queen of Shi, cursing Tang and the Chinese for eternity for Gao&#x27;s treachery.

<text>The British Rail Class 424 &quot;Networker Classic&quot; was a prototype electric multiple unit (EMU) built in 1997 by Adtranz at Derby Litchurch Lane Works from a Class 421 driving trailer vehicle.

==Project==

The &quot;Networker Classic&quot; concept involved rebuilding Mark 1 design Southern Region EMUs of Classes 411, 421 and 423 to meet current crashworthiness standards and have electric sliding doors instead of slam doors. This involved building a new bodyshell on the existing chassis, but keeping the original electrical and motor equipment. Therefore, the aim was to produce a &#x27;new&#x27; unit at one quarter the cost of manufacturing a train from scratch. The rebuilt units would have had a life of at least fifteen years, thus saving considerable amounts of money when replacing old stock. The unit is known for its similar looks with the British Rail Class 170 and the British Rail Class 357, albeit using pocket doors more similar to the subsequent classes 376 and 378, and unlike said trains used pocket doors for the driver cab doors, like those of the 1972 design and earlier Mark 3-derived units.

==Prototype==
One vehicle, no. 76112 from &#x27;Phase 1&#x27; 4Cig unit 1749, was rebuilt as a prototype in 1997. This saw the original Mark 1 bodyshell removed from the chassis at Doncaster Works, and replaced with a new one at Derby Litchurch Lane Works resembling a then brand new Turbostar train installed. The controls from the 4Cig unit were retained in the driving cab. It was displayed to the public at London Victoria, paired with unrebuilt DT 76747 from 4Big unit 2256 for comparison purposes. The converted vehicle had a total capacity of 77 passengers in Standard Class only; had the full 4-car unit undergone the same conversion, then it would have had capacity for up to 310 passengers.

The prototype unit had not carried passengers throughout its life, as the electric controls were unsuitable for the Class 424.

Although Connex South Central had at one stage proposed ordering some, the train companies turned to new-build rolling stock, which saw the introduction of the &quot;Electrostar&quot;, &quot;Desiro&quot; and &quot;Juniper&quot; families. As a result, the single Class 424 vehicle was stored at Derby Litchurch Lane Works until 2012, when it was removed for disposal. The unrebuilt 4Cig trailer (unit 1399), which paired with the vehicle, was scrapped from the East Kent Railway after restoration attempts failed.

<text>In organic chemistry, free-radical halogenation is a type of halogenation. This chemical reaction is typical of alkanes and alkyl-substituted aromatics under application of UV light. The reaction is used for the industrial synthesis of chloroform (CHCl3), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), and hexachlorobutadiene. It proceeds by a free-radical chain mechanism.

== General mechanism==
The chain mechanism is as follows, using the chlorination of methane as an example:
; Initiation: Ultraviolet radiation splits (homolyzes) a chlorine molecule to two chlorine atom radicals. 
; Chain propagation (two steps): A radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from methane, leaving a primary methyl radical. The methyl radical then abstracts Cl• from Cl2 to give the desired product and another chlorine radical. The radical will then participate in another propagation reaction: the radical chain. Other products such as CH2Cl2 may also form.
; Chain termination: Two free radicals (chlorine and chlorine, chlorine and methyl, or methyl and methyl) combine: The last possibility generates in an impurity in the final mixture (notably, an organic molecule with a longer carbon chain than the reactants).
The net reaction is: 

The steady-state approximation implies that this process has rate law &quot;k&quot;[CH4][Cl2].

As a radical reaction, the process is halted or severely slowed by radical traps, such as oxygen.

==Control==
The relative rates at which different halogens react vary considerably: 
:fluorine (108) &gt; chlorine (1) &gt; bromine () &gt; iodine (). 
Radical fluorination with the pure element is difficult to control and highly exothermic; care must be taken to prevent an explosion or a runaway reaction. With chlorine the reaction is moderate to fast; with bromine, slow and requires intense UV irradiation; and with iodine, it is practically nonexistent and thermodynamically unfavored. However, radical iodination can be completed with other iodine sources (see ). 

The different rates are often a pedagogical demonstration of the reactivity–selectivity principle and the Hammond postulate. 

Bond dissociation energies strongly influence any radical process and in a few unusual cases, free-radical halogenation can regioselect. Phenylic hydrogens have extremely strong bonds and are rarely displaced by halogens. Non-enolizable aldehydes oxidize to the acyl halide, but enolizable aldehydes typically halogenate at the α position instead. Indeed, allylic and benzylic hydrogens have bonds much weaker than alkanes, and are selectively replaced in the Wohl-Ziegler reaction. Generally, N-haloamines in sulfuric acid (but &quot;not&quot; other haloradical sources) halogenate alkane chains at penultimate carbons (e.g. pentane to 2-halopentane), chains terminating in only carboxylic acids at the center, and bridged compounds at the bridgehead. , the reasons for the latter N-haloimide selectivities remained unclear. 

Aside from those few exceptions, free-radical halogenation is notoriously unselective. Chlorination rarely stops at monosubstitution: depending on reaction conditions, methane chlorination yields varying proportions of chloromethane, dichloromethane, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. 

For asymmetric substrates, the reaction produces all possible isomers, but not equally. Radical halogenations are generally indifferent amongst equi-substituted potential radicals and effect a so-called statistical product distribution. Butane (CH3−CH2−CH2−CH3), for example, can be chlorinated at the &quot;1&quot; position to give 1-chlorobutane (CH3−CH2−CH2−CH2Cl) or at the &quot;2&quot; position to give 2-chlorobutane (CH3−CH2−CHCl−CH3). The latter occurs faster, and is the major product. 

The experimental relative chlorination rates at primary, secondary, and tertiary positions match the corresponding radical species&#x27; stability:
:tertiary (5) &gt; secondary (3.8) &gt; primary (1).
Thus any single chlorination step slightly favors substitution at the carbon already most substituted. The rates are generally constant across reactions and predict product distributions with relatively high accuracy. For example, 2-methyl butane ((CH3)2CHCH2CH3) exhibits the following results: 

Note that the sole tertiary hydrogen is nearly as likely to chlorinate as the 6 hydrogens terminating the branches, despite their much greater abundance.

==Variations==

Many mixtures of radical initiators, oxidants, and halogen compounds can generate the necessary halogen radicals. For example, consider radical bromination of toluene:

This reaction takes place on water instead of an organic solvent and the bromine is obtained from oxidation of hydrobromic acid with hydrogen peroxide. An incandescent light bulb suffices to radicalize. 

Other sources include alkyl hypohalites or single-electron oxidation-capable transition metals. In particular, tert-butyl hypoiodite is a common iodine source for radical iodination.

<text>Smaltite is a variety of the mineral skutterudite consisting of cobalt, iron, nickel, and arsenide. It has the chemical formula .

Smaltite crystallizes in the cubic system with the same hemihedral symmetry as pyrite; crystals have usually the form of cubes or cubo-octahedra, but are imperfectly developed and of somewhat rare occurrence. More often the mineral is found as compact or granular masses. The color is tin-white to steel-grey, with a metallic luster; the streak is greyish black. Hardness is 5.5 and the specific gravity is 6.5. The cobalt is partly replaced by iron and nickel, and as the latter increases in amount there is a passage to the isomorphous species chloanthite ().

Smaltite occurs in veins with ores of cobalt, nickel, copper and silver. The best known localities are Cobalt, Ontario and Schneeberg in Saxony, Germany. The name smaltite was given by F. S. Beudant in 1832 because the mineral was used in the preparation of smalt for producing a blue color in porcelain and glass.

<text>The Turks and Caicos Islands national football team represents Turks and Caicos Islands in international football, and is controlled by the Turks and Caicos Islands Football Association.

==History==

Having formed a football association in 1996 and joined FIFA in 1998, Turks and Caicos Islands made its first appearance at an official FIFA competition when they entered the 2002 World Cup qualification. In March 2000, the team was knocked out in the first qualification round by St. Kitts and Nevis 14–0 on aggregate.

At the 2006 World Cup qualifying competition, the side suffered a 7–0 aggregate loss against Haiti in February 2004.

In 2007, the federation completed construction of their first stadium, the Turks and Caicos National Stadium, with the help of the FIFA Goal programme, and have committed themselves to building a broad base of football participation and support.

On February 6, 2008, the team achieved its first World Cup qualification win 2–1 against Saint Lucia in the CONCACAF first round at home, but in the second leg played March 26, 2008, they were eliminated after they fell short having lost the away leg 0–2 in Saint Lucia for a 2–3 aggregate score.

The team went without a victory in an official game until June 3, 2014, when they beat the British Virgin Islands during the 2014 Caribbean Cup qualification, and as a result jumped from 207th to 181st in the FIFA rankings released during that month.

<doc id="1222855" wikidata="Q1063305" url="?curid=1222855" title="Alstonite">
<text>Alstonite, also known as bromlite, is a low temperature hydrothermal mineral that is a rare double carbonate of calcium and barium with the formula , sometimes with some strontium. Barytocalcite and paralstonite have the same formula but different structures, so these three minerals are said to be trimorphous. Alstonite is triclinic but barytocalcite is monoclinic and paralstonite is trigonal. The species was named Bromlite by Thomas Thomson in 1837 after the Bromley-Hill mine, and alstonite by August Breithaupt of the Freiberg Mining Academy in 1841, after Alston, Cumbria, the base of operations of the mineral dealer from whom the first samples were obtained by Thomson in 1834. Both of these names have been in common use.

==Structure==
Alstonite is triclinic, but appears pseudo-orthorhombic because of twinning. The space group is P1 or P. Alstonite appears to have a superstructure based on paralstonite without long range order of the metal cations or the CO3 groups. The structure of paralstonite is similar to that of other double carbonates.

==Unit cell==
The number of formula units, Z, in the triclinic unit cell is given as 10 or 12, and the unit cell parameters are a = 17.38 Å, b = 14.40 Å, c = 6.123 Å, α = 90.35°, β = 90.12°, γ = 120.08°. The Handbook of Mineralogy, however, describes the mineral in terms of a pseudo-orthorhombic unit cell, with space group C1 or C, Z = 24, and unit cell parameters a = 30.14 Å, b = 17.40 Å, c = 6.12 Å, α = β = γ = 90°.

==Appearance==
Simple crystals of alstonite are not known. The crystals are invariably complex twins formed by repeated twinning, and have the form of doubly terminated pseudo-hexagonal pyramids, like those of witherite but more acute. The faces are horizontally striated perpendicular to the pseudohexagonal c crystal axis and they are divided vertically by a medial, slightly reentrant twinning line parallel to the pseudohexagonal c axis.

Crystals are colourless to snow white, yellow-gray, pale gray, pale cream, pink, or pale rose-red, but the colour may fade on exposure to light. They are transparent to translucent with a white streak and vitreous lustre. The examination in polarized light of a transverse section shows that each compound crystal is built up of six differently oriented individuals arranged in twelve segments.

==Optical properties==
Alstonite is a biaxial (−) mineral with refractive indices nα =1.526, nβ = 1.671, nγ = 1.672. The maximum birefringence (the difference in refractive index between light travelling through the crystal with different polarizations) is δ = 0.146.

The optic angle 2V is the angle between the two optic axes in a biaxial crystal. The measured values of 2V for this mineral is 6°. It is also possible to calculate a theoretical value of 2V from the measured values of the refractive indices. The calculated value for alstonite is 8°. If the colour of the incident light is changed, then the refractive indices are modified, and the value of 2V changes. This is known as dispersion of the optic axes. For alstonite the effect is weak, with 2V larger for red light than for violet light (r &gt; v).

The optical directions X, Y, and Z are the directions of travel of light with refractive indices nα, nβ, and nγ respectively. In general they are not the same as the directions a, b, and c of the crystallographic axes. For alstonite X, Y, and Z are parallel to the c, a, and b crystal axes respectively.

Alstonite fluoresces weak yellow under shortwave and longwave ultraviolet light.

==Physical properties==
Twinning in alstonite is ubiquitous, forming pseudohexagonal groups. The mineral has one imperfect cleavage and it breaks with an uneven fracture. It is not very hard, with a Mohs hardness of just 4 to , a little harder than fluorite, and its specific gravity is 3.70. It is soluble in dilute HCl and it is not radioactive. The trimorphs alstonite, paralstonite, and barytocalcite all have similar physical properties.

==Type locality==
There are two type localities, both in the north of England. One is the Bromley Hill Mine (Bloomsberry Horse Level), Nenthead, Alston Moor District, North Pennines, Cumbria, and the other is the Fallowfield Mine, Acomb, Hexham, Tyne Valley, Northumberland. The type material is held at the Freiberg Mining Academy, Germany, 15818.

At the type locality at Brownley Hill, alstonite occurs in low-temperature lead–zinc hydrothermal deposits associated with witherite, calcite, and baryte. The crystals are white to colourless or faintly pink acute pseudohexagonal pyramids or dipyramids up to 6 mm long. In some specimens the alstonite is intergrown with very thin hexagonal platy crystals of nailhead calcite. Alstonite commonly encrusts compact crystalline white to pale pink baryte. Similar crystals have been found at Fallowfield. It occurs typically in low-temperature hydrothermal lead–zinc ore deposits, as is the case at the type localities, and it has also been reported as a rare phase in carbonatites. It occurs associated with calcite, baryte, ankerite, siderite, benstonite, galena, sphalerite, pyrite, and quartz.
==Other localities==
*USA: Tiny sharp pseudohexagonal dipyramids of alstonite with benstonite and more commonly with witherite are found at the Minerva Mine, Cave-In-Rock, Illinois.
*England: Alstonite has been found in veins at New Brancepeth, near Durham.
*England: At Nentsberry Haggs Mine, which, like the Brownley Hill Mine, is on Alston Moor, Cumbria, baryte has been found as pseudomorphs after alstonite up to 2.5 cm long, associated with sphalerite, galena, and witherite.

<doc id="1222857" wikidata="Q3321099" url="?curid=1222857" title="Bulmer Hobson">
<text>John Bulmer Hobson (14 January 1883 – 8 August 1969) was an Irish republican. He was a leading member of the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) before the Easter Rising in 1916. Hobson swore Patrick Pearse into membership of the IRB in late 1913. He opposed and attempted to prevent the Easter Rising. Hobson was also chief of staff of Fianna Éireann, which he helped to found.

==Early life==
Hobson was born at 5 Magdala Street, Belfast, to Benjamin Hobson, a grocer originally from County Armagh, and Mary Ann Bulmer, who was from England. However, numerous sources erroneously cite his place of birth as Holywood, County Down.

In 1901, the family was living in Hopefield Avenue in Belfast, before moving to the townland of Ballycultra, outside Holywood, by 1911.

Hobson had a &quot;fairly strict&quot; Quaker upbringing, according to Charles Townshend, possibly intensified by being sent to a Friends&#x27; boarding school in Lisburn. Hobson later resigned on principle from the Quakers soon after the 1914 Howth gun-running, as the Quakers are opposed to all forms of violence.

Bulmer&#x27;s father was born in Armagh, although he later lived in Monasterevin, County Kildare, and was said to be a Gladstonian Home Ruler in politics, while his mother was an English-born radical. In 1911 she was reported to be on a suffragist procession in London and was long involved in Belfast cultural activities. She gave a lecture, entitled &quot;Some Ulster Souterrains&quot; as the Belfast Naturalists&#x27; Field Club&#x27;s representative in 1901 at the British Association&#x27;s annual meeting in Leicester. With the poet Alice Milligan, she organised the Irishwomen&#x27;s Association, whose home reading circle met in the Hobsons&#x27; house. Hobson began at 13 to subscribe to a nationalist journal, &quot;Shan Van Vocht&quot;, published by Milligan. Soon after he joined the Gaelic League and the Gaelic Athletic Association.

==IRB and the Volunteers==
Hobson was sworn into the IRB in 1904 by Denis McCullough, their head in Belfast. Together they founded the Dungannon Clubs, whose object was to celebrate the victory of Volunteers of 1782 in restoring to Ireland her own Parliament, although they were additionally an &quot;open front&quot; for the IRB. The Volunteers of 1782 were an armed militia whose success, they suggested, could offer instructive lessons. The first Dungannon Club manifesto read: “The Ireland we seek to build is not an Ireland for the Catholic or the Protestant, but an Ireland for every Irishman Irrespective of his creed or class.&quot; Under the direction of Denis McCullough, Hobson became one of the key figures in the ongoing revitalisation of the IRB in Ulster, along with Seán Mac Diarmada, Patrick McCartan and Ernest Blythe.

Hobson moved to Dublin in 1907, and soon became a close friend of veteran Fenian Tom Clarke, with whom he had a very close relationship until 1914. In August 1909, with Constance Markievicz, he founded Na Fianna Éireann as a Republican scouting movement. In 1911 the republican newspaper &quot;Irish Freedom&quot; was founded, to which Hobson was an early contributor, and later that year he took over the editorship of it from Patrick McCartan.

Hobson was elevated to the IRB&#x27;s Supreme Council in 1911, taking over as the Ulster representative from IRB leader, Neal O&#x27;Boyle which coincided with the resignations of P.T. Daly, Fred Allen and Sean O&#x27;Hanlon, opening the way for Tom Clarke and the younger men to take control of the IRB. In 1913 he was elevated to the chairman of the Dublin Centres Board of the IRB, and later that year was one of the founding organisers of the Irish Volunteers, remaining a primary connection between the Volunteers and the IRB. He put together the plan to bring sufficient Volunteers and their supporters, discreetly to Howth on Sunday, 26 July 1914, to unload and distribute the arms being landed from the &quot;Asgard&quot; at Howth. 

As secretary and a member of the Volunteers provisional council, Hobson was instrumental in allowing Parliamentary leader John Redmond to gain control of the Volunteers organisation. He reluctantly gave in to Home Rule supporters&#x27; demands for control, believing that defying Redmond, who was popular with most rank-and-file Volunteers, would cause a split and would lead to the demise of the Volunteers. Clarke, steadfastly opposed to this action, never forgave him or spoke to him informally again. Hobson resigned as a member of the Supreme Council of the IRB, and was fired from his job as Dublin correspondent for the &quot;Gaelic American&quot; newspaper.

Hobson remained a member of the IRB, but, like the Volunteers&#x27; chief-of-staff Eoin MacNeill, he was kept unaware of the plans for the Rising. Though he could detect underground preparations, he had no certain evidence. He was later informed that volunteers had received orders for the Rising, timed for Easter Sunday, and he subsequently alerted MacNeill about what the IRB had planned. MacNeill issued a countermanding order, which served to delay the Rising by a day, and kept most of the Volunteers from participating. Hobson was kidnapped by Séamus O&#x27;Doherty on the orders of the organisers of the rising to stop him from spreading news of MacNeill&#x27;s order, and held at gunpoint at O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s house in Phibsborough until the Rising was well underway. After the Rising, Hobson went to Eoin MacNeil&#x27;s home of Woodtown Park to avoid arrest, an action which hurt his future political prospects and led to rumours that he was a traitor to the Volunteers and the IRB.

MacNeill later served in the Irish Free State government but Hobson was confined to a civil service job in the Department of Post and Telegraphs after Independence. Although he had been one of the most active members of the IRB for years, and was instrumental in the founding of the Volunteers, Hobson took no major role in politics after the Rising, or the subsequent Irish War of Independence (although he was later an occasional adviser to Clann na Poblachta). In 1922 he was appointed Chief of the Revenue Commissioners Stamp Department, the first of the departments that the IRB had infiltrated to any depth.

In 1947 he criticised the Rising and its leader saying the military council had &quot;no plans...which could seriously be called military&quot; and that the Rising consisted of &quot;locking a body of men up in two or three buildings to stay there until they were shot or burned out.&quot;

==Later years==
Hobson penned many economic works, writing from a Keynesian perspective. He believed that an economic resurgence was necessary to convince unionists to be a part of a United Ireland. Hobson hoped to eradicate poverty and founded the &#x27;League for Social Justice&#x27;.

After his retirement in 1948, Hobson built a house near Roundstone, Connemara. His wife Claire (née Gregan), from whom he had separated in the late 1930s, died in 1958. After suffering a heart attack in the 1960s, Hobson lived with his daughter and son-in-law, Camilla and John Mitchell, in Castleconnell, County Limerick, where he finished his account of his life, titled &quot;Ireland, Yesterday and Tomorrow&quot; (Anvil Books, Ireland, 1968).

==Death and legacy==
He died on 8 August 1969, aged 86, in Castleconnell, County Limerick and is buried at Gurteen Cemetery near Roundstone in Connemara, County Galway.

The novelist Brian Moore was a family friend. Moore&#x27;s last published work before his death in 1999 was an essay entitled &quot;Going Home&quot;. It was a reflection inspired by a visit he made to Hobson&#x27;s grave. The essay was commissioned by &quot;Granta&quot; and published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on 7 February 1999. Despite Moore&#x27;s often conflicted attitude to Ireland and his Irishness, his concluding reflection in the piece was &quot;The past is buried until, in Connemara, the sight of Bulmer Hobson&#x27;s grave brings back those faces, those scenes, those sounds and smells which now live only in my memory. And in that moment I know that when I die I would like to come home at last to be buried here in this quiet place among the grazing cows.&quot;

<text>Illinois Route 171 (IL 171) is a north–south state highway in northeastern Illinois. It runs from U.S. Route 6 (US 6) in Joliet north to Illinois Route 72 at the Chicago–Park Ridge border. The section of IL 171 on Archer Avenue from Joliet to Summit is historically significant, originating as a Native American trail, and later serving for a time as part of the first numbered highway between St. Louis and Chicago.

The current Illinois Route 171 incorporates part or all of previous IL 4, IL 4A, and IL 213.

==Route description==

IL 171 is mostly two lanes wide from Joliet to Willow Springs, and then four lanes wide to its northern endpoint in Chicago. It is a four-lane freeway for about , from its intersection with West 55th Street and Archer Avenue in Summit, to its intersection with West 44th Place in Lyons.

===Joliet to Lockport===
IL 171 begins in Joliet as Collins Street, at an intersection with US 6 which is East Jackson Street. On its way out of town, it passes the historic Joliet Correctional Center, used as a location in several television shows and movies including The Blues
Brothers. From Joliet to Lockport, it parallels the Des Plaines River, and IL 53 (which had formerly been US 66) on the other side of the river. It passes through historic Downtown Lockport as State Street, intersecting IL 7 at 9th Street.

===Lockport to Summit===
On the north side of Lockport, IL 171 bends northeast onto Archer Avenue. It intersects Interstate 355 (I-355, Veterans Memorial Tollway) just south of Lemont. At the community of Sag Bridge, it is joined by IL 83, and the two routes run concurrently for about to cross the Calumet Sag Channel on the Archer Avenue Bridge. The two routes split again immediately north of the bridge, as IL 83 continues north while IL 171 resumes its northeastward course, passing St. James at Sag Bridge Church and Cemetery, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It then makes a scenic passage through the Palos Division of the Forest Preserve District of Cook County, a very large natural preserve. Leaving the forest preserve, it passes through the village of Willow Springs which was built strung out along the road. IL 171 has a complex interchange with US 12/US 20/US 45 (LaGrange Road) and I-294 (Tri-State Tollway) on the border between Willow Springs and Justice. At this point, it begins to parallel two roads to the east, Illinois Route 43 and Illinois Route 50. It will parallel these two roads for the rest of its route. It continues northeastward through Justice, passing Bethania and Resurrection Cemeteries. It then passes through small sections of Bridgeview and Bedford Park on its way into Summit.

===Summit to Chicago===
At an intersection with West 55th Street in Summit, IL 171 bends sharply to the north, becoming a freeway for about , crossing the Illinois and Michigan Canal, the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, the Stevenson Expressway (I-55), and the Des Plaines River at a cloverleaf interchange whose ramps had to be built as bridges over these watercourses due to their close proximity to I-55. It then enters McCook and has interchanges with Joliet Road (Historic US 66), and West 47th Street at the border between McCook and Lyons, before the freeway ends at West 44th Place in Lyons. Continuing as First Avenue, IL 171 intersects US 34 at Ogden Avenue, and passes to the east of Brookfield Zoo in Brookfield. Continuing north into Maywood, it passes Loyola University Medical Center before intersecting I-290 (Eisenhower Expressway). It continues north through Melrose Park where it intersects IL 64 at North Avenue, and River Grove, where its name changes to Thatcher Avenue. At West Belmont Avenue, it enters the City of Chicago, becoming North Cumberland Avenue, at 8400 West in the Chicago address system. It intersects IL 19 at Irving Park Road. A half-mile further north, it enters the village of Norridge for just over one mile. It then has a cloverleaf interchange with I-90 (Kennedy Expressway) before ending at IL 72 (Higgins Road), at the border between Chicago and Park Ridge, near O&#x27;Hare Airport.

==History==

===Before automobiles===
The route followed by IL 171 from Joliet to Summit was originally a Native American trail. It can be found on a map from 1837. This original trail continued northeast beyond Summit around the southern shore of historic Mud Lake as a dry land route past the marshy Chicago Portage, ending where Downtown Chicago is now. This ancient trail is known today as Archer Avenue.

===Original S.B.I. 171===
Illinois State Bond Issue Route 171 (S.B.I. 171) was established in 1924 in the northwestern part of the state, and ran from Thomson to S.B.I. 78, along what is now called the Argo-Fay Route. This first IL 171 appeared on maps starting in 1929, but was gone by 1931 and never reappeared on this alignment.

===Original S.B.I. 4===
The first road from Joliet to Chicago was shown as &quot;Lone Star Route&quot; on early road maps. In 1924 S.B.I. 4 was designated as the first numbered route from Saint Louis to Chicago. From Joliet to Lyons, the original S.B.I 4 followed the route of modern IL 171, along Archer Avenue, except for a jog through Lemont on State and Main streets to bypass an unpaved section of Archer Avenue. It then rejoined Archer Avenue at Sag Bridge.
At Summit, the original S.B.I. 4 continued along the modern alignment of IL 171 north to Lyons, where S.B.I. 4 turned east on Ogden Avenue towards Chicago.

===Routes 4A and 213===
In 1926, a new alignment for the Saint Louis to Chicago through highway was opened as IL 4 on the northwest side of the Des Plaines River from Joliet to Lyons. This new alignment would later become US 66 and then I-55. Its previous alignment on Archer Avenue was renumbered as IL 4A. By 1932, Archer Avenue was completely paved, so IL 4A no longer detoured through Lemont.

In 1934, IL 4A was extended east into Chicago along 55th Street and Garfield Boulevard to South Park Boulevard (now called Martin Luther King Jr. Drive), where it turned north to end at Leif Erickson Drive (now called Lake Shore Drive), which was US 12/US 20/US 41 at the time. This 1934 endpoint was roughly at the site of today&#x27;s McCormick Place.

The next year, the 1935 map shows that the section of former IL 4A from Summit to Lyons had been designated as IL 213. It also shows IL 4A truncated to the intersection of Garfield Boulevard and South Park Boulevard, which had been designated US 330. By 1939 IL 4A had been rerouted from 55th Street, more directly into Downtown Chicago on Archer Avenue. In 1935, IL 4, IL 4A&#x27;s parent route, was truncated to end at Springfield, having been replaced by US 66 from Springfield to Chicago. This left IL 4A from Joliet to Chicago as an odd remote orphan of its Downstate parent route until it was eliminated in 1967.

===Modern Route 171===
In 1946, IL 213 was renumbered IL 171, still connecting IL 4A in Summit to US 34 in Lyons. This is the first appearance of the modern IL 171. In the mid-1960s, as part of the construction of the new Stevenson Expressway, IL 171 was upgraded to a freeway between Summit and Lyons, including its interchange with I-55. In 1967, IL 4A was eliminated, and its section between Joliet and Summit became a southern extension of IL 171. In 1998, IL 171 was extended northward through several suburban communities and the Northwest Side of Chicago, crossing I-290 and I-90, to end at IL 72 (Higgins Road) on the border between Chicago and Park Ridge near O&#x27;Hare Airport.

===Claims of supernatural occurrences===

The section of IL 171 on Archer Avenue between Sag Bridge and Justice is reputed to be haunted. There have been reports of ghostly monks in the cemetery at St. James at Sag Bridge Church since the mid-1800s; in 1977 police are said to have chased a group of them into the cemetery. A vanishing hitchhiker known as Resurrection Mary is said to ask for rides between the Willowbrook Ballroom in Willow Springs and Resurrection Cemetery in Justice - and then disappear into the cemetery.

<text>Adam Michna z Otradovic, or also Adam Václav Michna z Otradovic – literally &quot;Adam Michna of Otradovice&quot; ( – 2 November 1676, Jindřichův Hradec), was a Czech Catholic poet, composer, hymn writer, organist and choir leader of the early Baroque era. He is also known in simplified form as Adam Michna and during his life as Adamus Wenceslaus Michna de Ottradowicz. He was the most important Czech composer and poet of the early Baroque who initiated the development of Czech art in that era and became a significant inspiration for Czech artists of future generations.
== Life ==
Michna was descended from the noble and musical family of Michna z Otradovic in Jindřichův Hradec in South Bohemia, bearing the title of Knight. His father was the organist and trumpeter Michael Michna (many of his other relatives were also trumpeters). In the 1620s the literary fraternity in the town was restored by the highest Lord Chancellor of the Kingdom of Bohemia Vilém Slavata and that act, together with the activities of the Jesuit College, founded in 1594, contributed greatly to the development of cultural life in the town. Adam Michna became the first student at the Jesuit College, where he studied in 1611–1612 and 1615–1617 at the gymnasium. In the 17th and 18th centuries the Order of Jesuits was a great influence on musical life in the Czech lands. Many of Michna&#x27;s compositions were later printed and published by Prague Jesuits.

Little is known about his later life. He became a member of the Literary Society and the organist and choir director in 1633 at the provost church in Jindřichův Hradec. He helped to improve the musical life in the town, was a respected and wealthy citizen of Jindřichův Hradec and also the owner of the tap-room. He was twice married, but no record exists of any children. In 1673 he established a foundation for the education of needy young musicians. He died on 2 November 1676.

== Work ==

Adam Michna was prolific, but not all of his works were preserved and known today. There are 230 of his compositions from three Czech and two Latin collections. The majority of his creative effort was dedicated to sacred music. The best known are his three hymn cycles, (Czech Marian music), (&quot;Czech Lute&quot;) and (Holy year music).

He composed vocal as well as vocal-instrumental music to his own lyrics. He wrote many Czech sacred songs; some are still well known and popular, such as the carol (&quot;Christmas Night&quot;), better known as , which is commonly sung today at Christmas in the Czech Republic. It is possible that Michna was familiar with early Italian Baroque compositional techniques.

===Music===
====Sacred music====
Michna&#x27;s sacred music (on liturgical texts, in Latin), is melodically rich, with polyphonic sound, in particular using brass instruments (trumpets, trombones), strings and organ. Vocal parts are based on the timbre contrast between solo vocals and choir.
* &quot;Obsequium Marianum&quot; (1642)
* &quot;Officium vespertinum, Psalmi&quot; (1648)
* &quot;Magnificat I. toni&quot; (1654)
* – containing five masses, two litanies, a Te Deum, and a Requiem
* &quot;Missa Sancti Wenceslai&quot;

====Songs and hymns====
Michna musically arranged homophonic songs from his own texts:
* (1647)
* (1653)
* (1661)

===Poetry===
Michna&#x27;s poetry is based on emphasizing the use of word sounds, rhymes and rich metaphorical phrases. His verbal pictures are very vivid and aim to influence the senses. His favourite themes can be described as the inner fight between good and evil in man, moving from lovely images of paradise to the terrible torments of hell, but with specific noble, philosophical insight (however, he sometimes used colloquial language too), enriched on occasion by modest humour, arising from a critical view of human society. Among his other main themes is the imaginative depiction of nature. He was the first Czech poet to create the phenomenon of spiritual-romantic poetry.

The list of poems is practically identical to the collections of songs.

<text>David Octavius Hill (20 May 1802 – 17 May 1870) was a Scottish painter, photographer and arts activist. He formed Hill &amp; Adamson studio with the engineer and photographer Robert Adamson between 1843 and 1847 to pioneer many aspects of photography in Scotland.

==Early life==
David Octavius Hill was born in 1802 in Perth. His father, a bookseller and publisher, helped to re-establish Perth Academy and David was educated there as were his brothers. When his older brother Alexander joined the publishers Blackwood&#x27;s in Edinburgh, Hill went there to study at the School of Design. He learned lithography and produced &quot;Sketches of Scenery in Perthshire&quot; which was published as an album of views. His landscape paintings were shown in the &quot;Institution for the Promotion of the Fine Arts in Scotland&quot;, and he was among the artists dissatisfied with the &quot;Institution&quot; who established a separate Scottish Academy in 1829 with the assistance of his close friend Henry Cockburn. A year later Hill took on unpaid secretarial duties. He sought commissions in book illustration, with four sketches being used to illustrate &quot;The Glasgow and Garnkirk Railway Prospectus&quot; in 1832, and went on to provide illustrations for editions of Walter Scott and Robert Burns.

In the 1830s he is listed as living at 24 Queen Street, in Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town. In 1836 the Royal Scottish Academy began to pay him a salary as secretary, and with this security he married his fiancée Ann Macdonald the following year. After the birth of their daughter, Charlotte Hill, Ann was invalided, and died on 5 October 1841, aged 36, and was buried with her family in Greyfriars Churchyard in Perth. Charlotte Hill went on to marry the author Walter Scott Dalgleish LLD and is buried in Grange Cemetery, The Grange, Edinburgh.

He continued to produce illustrations and to paint landscapes on commission. During this period he lived at 28 Inverleith Row in Edinburgh&#x27;s northern suburbs.

==Free Church of Scotland==


Hill was present at the Disruption Assembly in 1843 when over 450 ministers walked out of the Church of Scotland assembly and down to another assembly hall to found the Free Church of Scotland. He decided to record the dramatic scene with the encouragement of his friend Lord Cockburn and another spectator, the physicist Sir David Brewster who suggested using the new invention, photography, to get likenesses of all the ministers present. Brewster was himself experimenting with this technology which only dated back to 1839, and he introduced Hill to another enthusiast, Robert Adamson. Hill and Adamson took a series of photographs of those who had been present and of the setting. The x painting was eventually completed in 1866.

==Photography studio==

Hill moved to &quot;Calton Hill Stairs&quot; in 1850.

Their collaboration, with Hill providing skill in composition and lighting, and Adamson considerable sensitivity and dexterity in handling the camera, proved extremely successful, and they soon broadened their subject matter. Adamson&#x27;s studio, &quot;Rock House&quot;, on Calton Hill in Edinburgh became the centre of their photographic experiments. Using the calotype process, they produced a wide range of portraits depicting well-known Scottish luminaries of the time, including Hugh Miller, both in the studio and outdoors, often amongst the elaborate tombs in Greyfriars Kirkyard.

They photographed local and Fife landscapes and urban scenes, including images of the Scott Monument under construction in Edinburgh. As well as the great and the good, they photographed ordinary working folk, particularly the fishermen of Newhaven, and the fishwives who carried the fish in creels the 3 miles (5 km) uphill to the city of Edinburgh to sell them round the doors, with their cry of &quot;Caller herrin&quot; (fresh herring). They produced several groundbreaking &quot;action&quot; photographs of soldiers and – perhaps their most famous photograph – two priests walking side by side.

Their partnership produced around 3,000 prints, but was cut short after only four years due to the ill health and death of Adamson in 1848. The calotypes faded under sunlight, so had to be kept in albums, and though Hill continued the studio for some months, he became less active and abandoned the studio, though he continued to sell prints of the photographs and to use them as an aid for composing paintings. In 1862 he remarried, to the sculptor Amelia Robertson Paton, 20 years his junior, and around that time took up photography again, but the results were more static and less successful than his collaboration with Adamson. He was badly affected by the death of his daughter and his work slowed. In 1866 he finished the &quot;Disruption&quot; picture which received wide acclaim, though many of the participants had died by then. The photographer F.C. Annan produced fine reduced facsimiles of the painting for sale throughout the Free Church, and a group of subscribers raised £1,200 to buy the painting for the church. In 1869 illness forced him to give up his post as secretary to the RSA, and he died in May 1870.

Hill is buried in Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh – one of the finest Victorian cemeteries in Scotland. He is portrayed in a bust sculpted by his second wife, Amelia, who is buried alongside him.

==Exhibitions==
Some of his photographs were put on show in Glasgow in 1954 but the first major exhibition of his work was in 1963 in Essen, Germany.

<text>Romas Kalanta (22 February 1953 – 14 May 1972) was a 19-year-old Lithuanian high school student who killed himself by self-immolation in an act of protest against the Soviet regime in Lithuania. His death provoked the largest post-war riots in Lithuania and inspired similar self-immolations. In 1972, 13 more people committed suicide by self-immolation. 

Kalanta became a symbol of the Lithuanian resistance throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In 2000, he was posthumously awarded the Order of the Cross of Vytis.

== Life and death ==
Kalanta was religious; in a school essay he indicated that he would like to become a Catholic priest, which caused him some troubles with the authorities. He attended an evening school while working at a factory. Kalanta played the guitar and made a few drawings; he had long hair and sympathised with the hippies. These sympathies were later exploited by the Soviets to discredit Kalanta among the older population.

At noon on 14 May 1972, Kalanta poured three litres of petroleum on himself and set himself on fire in the square adjoining the Laisvės Alėja in front of the Kaunas State Musical Theatre where, in 1940, the puppet legislature People&#x27;s Seimas had declared the establishment of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and petitioned the Soviet Union to admit Lithuania as one of the soviet socialist republics. He died about 14 hours later in hospital. Before the suicide, Kalanta left his notebook with a brief note on a bench. Its content became known only after the declaration of independence in 1990 and opening up of secret KGB archives. The note read &quot;blame only the regime for my death&quot; (Lithuanian: &quot;Dėl mano mirties kaltinkite tik santvarką&quot;). No other notes were found to explain in more detail what had provoked the suicide. 

After his death, rumours spread that a few of his classmates had formed a patriot group, and that they had held a lottery to determine which of them would have to carry out the mission. Official Soviet propaganda claimed that Kalanta was mentally ill.

== Riots and aftermath ==

The Soviet government tried to cover up the event, but its witnesses spread the news by word of mouth. On 18 May, the Soviet authorities hastened Kalanta&#x27;s burial by several hours to prevent publicity. His funeral procession touched off two full days of rebellion in which thousands of people took to the streets shouting: &quot;Freedom for Lithuania!&quot; They attacked a police station and the party offices. The people gathered, mostly high school students and young workers, broke into a politically charged riot, which was forcibly dispersed by the KGB, militsiya, and Internal Troops. The next day, about 3,000 people marched along the Laisvės Alėja of whom 402 were arrested. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported numerous injuries and one death among Soviet troops. 

The public agitation was felt throughout 1972 and 1973 as the KGB registered various anti-Soviet incidents to even greater degrees. Lithuania recorded 13 other suicides by fire in 1972, including 24-year-old V. Stonys in Varėna on 29 May, 60-year-old A. Andriuškevičius in Kaunas on 3 June, 62-year-old Zališauskas on 10 June, and 40-year-old Juozapas Baracevičius in Šiauliai on 22 June.

<text>Vice-Admiral Alfred Francis Blakeney Carpenter, VC (17 September 1881 – 27 December 1955) was a Royal Navy officer who was selected by his fellow officers and men to receive the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Family==
Carpenter was born in Barnes, the son of Henrietta Maud née Shadwell (1858-1889) and Captain Alfred Carpenter RN, and grandson of Commander Charles Carpenter. He attended Bedales School founded by his Uncle Edward Carpenter&#x27;s close friend John Haden Badley. In 1903 married to Emily Maud Mary Tordiffe (1881-1923) and after her death married Hilda Margaret Allison née Smith (1891-1958) in 1927.

==Career==
Carpenter joined the Royal Navy and saw naval service as a midshipman in Crete in 1898 and during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900–01. He was acting sub-lieutenant from 15 May 1901. In August 1902 he was temporarily posted to the torpedo boat destroyer HMS &quot;Havock&quot; for service during the Coronation Fleet review. From late October that year he was posted to the corvette HMS &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, used as a training cruiser in home waters, and confirmed in the rank of sub-lieutenant. He specialised in navigation from 1903 and received the thanks of the Admiralty for several inventions, and a Humane Society medal for saving life at sea. During World War I he served on Admiral Jellicoe&#x27;s staff 1914–15. He was promoted to Commander in 1915 and served as navigating officer of HMS &quot;Emperor of India&quot; 1915–17.

On 22/23 April 1918, Captain Carpenter was in command of HMS &quot;Vindictive&quot; which was to land a force of 200 Royal Marines on the mole at Zeebrugge at the start of the Zeebrugge Raid. For his conduct during this action he was awarded the VC:

(Rule 13 of the Royal Warrant provides that after an action in which all are equally brave and distinguished, where no special selection can be made, the officer in overall command may direct that one officer may be selected for the award by the officers and men who took part in the action.)

Carpenter was also made an Officer of the Legion of Honour and awarded the Croix de Guerre with palm. He was sent on a lecturing tour through the US and Canada, 1918–19.

After the war, Carpenter was in command of HMS &quot;Carysfort&quot; in the Atlantic Fleet 1921–23, Captain of Chatham Dockyard 1924–26, in command of HMS &quot;Benbow&quot; in 1926 and of HMS Marlborough 1927–28. He was a naval aide-de-camp to the King (an honorary position) in 1929, and promoted rear-admiral and placed on the retired list in the same year. He was promoted to vice-admiral (retired) in 1934. During World War II he commanded the Wye Valley section of the Gloucestershire Home Guard.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Imperial War Museum, London, England.

<text>Sir Nicholas Harold Lloyd Ridley (10 July 1906 – 25 May 2001) was an English ophthalmologist who invented the intraocular lens and pioneered intraocular lens surgery for cataract patients.

==Early years==
Nicholas Harold Lloyd Ridley was born in Kibworth Harcourt, Leicestershire, the elder son of Nicholas Charles Ridley and his wife, Margaret (née Parker). He had a younger brother. Known from childhood by his middle name (Harold), Ridley had a stammer which he was largely able to manage. As a child he met and sat on the lap of Florence Nightingale, a close friend of his mother.

He was educated at Charterhouse School before studying at Pembroke College, Cambridge from 1924 to 1927, and completed his medical training in 1930 at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital. Subsequently, he worked as a surgeon at both St Thomas&#x27; and Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, specialising in ophthalmology. In 1938, Ridley was appointed full surgeon and consultant at Moorfields Hospital and later appointed consultant surgeon in 1946.

==Cataract operations and intraocular lenses==
During World War II, Ridley saw Royal Air Force casualties with eye injuries, including Squadron Leader Gordon &quot;Mouse&quot; Cleaver of 601 Squadron. Ridley observed that when splinters of acrylic plastic from aircraft cockpit canopies became lodged in their eyes, this did not trigger inflammatory rejection as did glass splinters. This led him to propose the use of artificial lenses to treat cataract.

The lack of an inflammatory reaction was known to other Royal Air Force ophthalmologists, such as Arthur Llewelyn McCurry and Philip Livingston, who published on the subject in September 1948. Others had used acrylic for ophthalmic prostheses. At the Oxford Ophthalmological Congress in July 1947, H. B. Stallard discussed acrylic prostheses to prevent the contraction of the orbital socket; and acrylic corneal grafts were presented by Franceschetti in London in March 1949. Ridley used a variety of acrylic called Transpex I, which had been employed since 1944 to create optical devices, such as retro-reflector prisms, spectacles, and contact lenses (1946). Ridley began working on intraocular lenses in the autumn of 1949, when a medical student asked him whether he would place a lens after performing a cataract surgery.

On 29 November 1949, at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, Ridley achieved the first implant of an intraocular lens, although it was not until 8 February 1950 that he left an artificial lens permanently in place in an eye. Ridley&#x27;s first intraocular lens had the same radius of curvature as the human crystalline lens, even though the index of refraction of Transpex was known to be higher than that of the crystalline lens, and, as a result, the first patient had a postoperative spherical equivalent of -21 D, which focussed her at about 4.8 cm distance. Ridley sterilized the first intraocular lenses in cetrimide, an antiseptic invented by I.C.I., the manufacturer of Transpex. Cetrimide could produce a postoperative uveitis because it could not always be fully rinsed off.

The first lens was manufactured by Rayner. The first IOL implant in the United States was performed in 1952: a Rayner-Ridley lens implanted at the Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia. The intraocular lens was approved as &quot;safe and effective&quot; and approved for use in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration in 1981. The first FDA-approved lenses – Choyce Mark VIII and Choyce Mark IX Anterior Chamber – were manufactured by Rayner.

In 1987, Gordon &quot;Mouse&quot; Cleaver, whose injury in 1940 helped Ridley conceive the idea of using an acrylic intraocular lens, underwent cataract surgery and the implantation of such a lens to restore his sight.

==Wartime service and ophthalmic research==

Ridley was in civilian hospital services in South East England during the early years of World War II, when he saw injured pilots from the Battle of Britain. In the middle - to end-years of the war he was with the R.A.M.C (Royal Army Medical Corps) and was posted to West Africa and South East Asia.

=== Onchocerciasis (River Blindness) ===
While in Africa, Ridley led important research into onchocerciasis when he was stationed in the Gold Coast, now Ghana, for part of his war service. He acted as part-time sanitation officer at the capital city of Accra, and met Brigadier G. M. Findlay, AMS, who stimulated Ridley&#x27;s interest to study River Blindness, an endemic disease in parts of the country. To find onchocerciasis patients, in February 1944, Ridley left the coastal city and travelled overland with Findlay and Captain John Holden to north west Ghana. He worked in Funsi in the Wa East District of the Upper West Region for two weeks, examining patients with a slit-lamp which ran off two 6-volt car batteries. Most (90%) had onchocerciasis; ten percent of them were blind. Conditions were primitive and Ridley recorded his observations of the retinal fundus by water-colour painting and photography. His painting of the fundus (sometimes termed the &quot;Ridley fundus&quot; of onchocerciasis) was completed in Accra upon his return from Funsi. &quot;The attention he called to this disease constitutes one of Ridley&#x27;s major contributions to ophthalmology. His monograph &#x27;Ocular Onchocerciasis&#x27;, published in 1945 in a supplement of the &quot;British Journal of Ophthalmology&quot;, was a landmark.&quot;

=== Snake venom ophthalmia ===

Writing as Major Harold Ridley, he published in 1944 a short paper in the British Journal of Ophthalmology on spitting snakes and an account on the composition and action of snake venom in general. From his own experiences in the Gold Coast, Ridley described snake venom ophthalmia in a 30-year-old labourer named Gogi Kumasi who was cutting grass when a Black-necked cobra raised its head from the grass and forcibly spat venom toward the man&#x27;s right eye from a distance of four or five feet. Ridley treated the man and followed his case until the eye had fully recovered, after about a week. After discussion on the therapeutic uses of snake venom, he conjectured that in the future diluted venom or a constituent of venom might be used as a powerful anaesthetic in some cases of ophthalmic surgery.

=== Nutritional amblyopia ===
After completing 18 months in Ghana, in 1944 Ridley was transferred to India and then Burma, where he studied and treated malnourished former prisoners of war. His biographer David Apple reports Ridley&#x27;s own words: &quot;In Calcutta, we basically had nothing to do with no assignments – a situation which continued after transfer to Parragan, near Calcutta. Finally, I was transferred to Rangoon, Burma, where life began again. I treated over 200 released allied prisoners of war in Rangoon and Singapore who suffered from nutritional amblyopia while Japanese prisoners of war. Many of the prisoners had worked on the Burma Railway. Starved and ill treated, they had developed sudden central scotoma, relieved by good diet if available. Some developed optic atrophy, some of whom made a partial recovery within six weeks of release. However, the advanced cases, though given a vitamin-rich diet were irreversible. I subsequently wrote an article on the topic of nutritional amblyopia.&quot; His paper was published in 1945. &quot;It is uncertain whether disturbance in a visual pathway originates in the retina or optic nerve. Failure of the cortical capillaris to nourish the outer retinal layers at the macula may be significant.&quot; 

The therapy he used anticipated the use today of multivitamins in ARMD patients. Ridley used multivitamin therapy, returned them to a normal diet, and then noted improvement in the prisoners&#x27; condition. The Burma theatre of war permitted the first large population study of individuals with nutritional amblyopia: a total of over 500 within his region of whom about 200 he personally examined and treated.

==The International Intra-Ocular Implant Club==
The Club was founded in 1966 by Ridley and Peter Choyce, to promote research in the field of IOL implantation. At that time there was widespread opposition in the profession to the use of IOLs. The founders saw the club as a forum to allow free and unhindered exchange of ideas about IOLs and implantation surgical techniques. From the outset it was international in its membership, and set itself a parental and advisory role for the then-nascent national societies to develop in each country for intraocular implant surgeons. However, this global role was only acknowledged in a name change in July 1975, when the Intra-Ocular Implant Club became The International Intra-Ocular Implant Club.

== The Ridley Eye Foundation ==
In 1967, Ridley set up the Ridley Foundation, known as the Ridley Eye Foundation, to raise funds for cataract surgery in developing countries and to treat avoidable blindness. A registered charity under English law, the organisation continues to be active in these fields today, notably in the Middle East. Ridley&#x27;s son Nicholas serves as its chairman.

== Later life ==
Ridley retired from NHS hospital service in 1971. In the 1990s, he underwent successful bilateral intraocular lens implantation at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital by Dr Michael Falcon. Thus, Ridley benefitted from his own invention and the operational procedure he had pioneered but what was most pleasing to him was that he had it done in the hospital where he performed the first operation.

Ridley lived in Stapleford near Salisbury, Wiltshire until his death on 25 May 2001, aged 94. His funeral service and burial were at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Swinstead, Lincolnshire.

==Recognition, honours and awards==
In 1986, Ridley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. His first academic honour was an honorary doctorate degree, Doctor of Humane Letters (DHL), conferred in 1989 by the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston.

In 1992, Ridley received the Gullstrand Medal (conferred by the Swedish Society of Medicine) named after Swedish ophthalmic surgeon Allvar Gullstrand. In 1994, he received the Gonin Medal (conferred by the Club Jules Gonin, Lausanne Switzerland) named after the renowned Swiss retinal surgeon Jules Gonin.

In April 1999, at the annual meeting of the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery in Seattle, Washington, Ridley was honoured in a special anniversary session as one of the most outstanding and influential ophthalmologists of the 20th century. Later the same year, at the 1999 meeting of the European Society of Ophthalmology (Stockholm, July 1999) he was honoured; and again at the annual meeting of the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (Vienna, September 1999).

Announced on 31 December 1999, the New Year Honours 2000 list for the United Kingdom and New Zealand included Ridley as one of forty-five people accorded with the honour of Knight Bachelor, &quot;for pioneering services to Cataract Surgery&quot;. Subsequently, at a ceremony in February 2000, aged 93, he was knighted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace. This Millennium Honour was the culmination of years of lobbying work by Ridley&#x27;s biographer (David J Apple) and prominent surgeon friends such as Emanuel Rosen and Thomas Neuhann, together with leaders of the ophthalmic medical device industry such as Donald J Munro, chairman and managing director of the Rayner company of Brighton &amp; Hove, UK. 
In 2001, a plaque was installed at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital, London to commemorate the first IOL implantation. Ridley died the same year, in Salisbury, Wiltshire.

In September 2010, the Royal Mail issued a series of commemorative postage stamps to mark &quot;Medical Breakthroughs&quot;. Designed by Howard Brown, the 67p stamp depicted a&quot;rtificial lens implant surgery pioneered by Sir Harold Ridley 1949&quot;.

A Heritage blue plaque to commemorate his groundbreaking work was installed in Kibworth Harcourt, Leicestershire on 18 February 2012, thanks to the research carried out by Bob Haggerty, a local resident who has himself had an intraocular lens fitted, and supported by Kibworth Improvement Team (KiT), the local community partnership.

A plaque in memory of Ridley is installed in the gardens of his &quot;alma mater&quot; Pembroke College, Cambridge, which plaque reads: &quot;RIDLEY’S WALK / This plaque is placed in memory of Sir Harold Ridley FRS 1906-2001 / pioneer of intraocular lens surgery, graduate &amp; benefactor of this College / after whose ancestor Bishop Nicholas Ridley, Master 1540-1553, / martyred 1555, this path is traditionally named&quot;.

In 2013, a biographical profile of Ridley was included in a book called &quot;Saving Sight: An eye surgeon&#x27;s look at life behind the mask and the heroes who changed the way we see&quot;, by Andrew Lam.

==Film and TV==

On 6 January 2016, during the BBC 1 television programme &quot;The One Show&quot; a short film was shown about the link between Gordon Cleaver and Harold Ridley. Using archive film and photographic material and an interview with Sir Harold&#x27;s son, Nicholas, Michael Mosley reported on the &quot;Eureka moment&quot; that led to the invention of the intraocular lens. The film was made by ICON Films of Bristol.

<doc id="1222881" wikidata="Q5551620" url="?curid=1222881" title="Maude Lloyd">
<text>Maude Lloyd (16 August 1908 – 26 November 2004) was a South African ballet dancer and teacher who immigrated to England and became an important figure in early British ballet as a founding member of Ballet Rambert. She had a significant second career as a dance critic, writing with her husband under the &quot;nom de plume&quot; Alexander Bland.

==Early life and training==
Maude Lloyd was born in Cape Town where she studied ballet with Helen Webb. Webb, who had arrived from England in 1912, opened her own school of &quot;fancy dancing&quot; (i.e., classical ballet), and then introduced dance into the curriculum of the South African College of Music. Having been a pupil of Enrico Cecchetti in London, Webb employed the Cecchetti method of instructing her students in Cape Town. After some years of training with Webb and performing in recitals staged at the town hall, Lloyd went to London on a scholarship from Webb, armed with an introduction to Marie Rambert, an old friend of Webb&#x27;s and a well-known teacher of ballet at her school in Notting Hill. Lloyd arrived in England sometime in 1924 or 1925, when she was 16 or 17, and promptly enrolled in Rambert&#x27;s school. After a period of concentrated study there, she returned to South Africa in 1927 and taught at Webb&#x27;s school for three years before returning to England.

==Dancing career==
On returning to England in 1930, Lloyd was among Rambert&#x27;s students who became founding members of her Ballet Club, the performing group from which Ballet Rambert was to evolve. She danced with this group at several West End theaters and on tours outside London, as well as appearing in repertory works with the Camargo Society. From 1930 onward, she was a leading dancer in the regular Sunday performances of Rambert&#x27;s Ballet Club at the Mercury Theatre in Notting Hill Gate. Other members of the club included emerging choreographers Frederick Ashton, Antony Tudor, and Andrée Howard, each of whom would respond to Lloyd&#x27;s technical ability, as well as her intelligence, elegance, and sensitivity, by creating roles for her in their works. With occasional brief absences—to dance with other British companies and to visit South Africa once more, in 1932—Lloyd remained with Ballet Rambert until 1940. She followed Pearl Argyle and Alicia Markova, the company&#x27;s first ballerinas, in many of their created roles but soon had new roles of her own.

When Lloyd met Antony Tudor in one of Rambert&#x27;s classes in 1930, she was immediately drawn to him, and he to her. She, along with Hugh Laing, became one of his muses, inspiring him to create numerous works with roles focusing on her special qualities. &quot;Not only was she very pretty, with beautifully curved feet, but she also danced with a rich, natural expressiveness that fed the psychological realism with which Tudor was experimenting.&quot; Of the numerous Tudor works in which she danced leading roles, none has been more enduring than &quot;Jardin aux Lilas&quot; (&quot;Lilac Garden&quot;), premiered in 1936. Lloyd&#x27;s portrayal of Caroline, who gives up Her Lover (Laing) for The Man She Must Marry (Tudor), was &quot;a beautifully modulated exposition of the simmering passions and dutiful restraint characteristic of Edwardian life.&quot; This was followed in 1937 by another Tudor masterpiece, &quot;Dark Elegies&quot;, set to Mahler&#x27;s song cycle &quot;Kindertotenlieder&quot; (&quot;Songs on the Death of Children&quot;), in which she and Tudor danced a tender, sorrowful &quot;pas de deux&quot; to the second song. She also made successful appearances in the classical repertory, dancing Aurora in Rambert&#x27;s version of &quot;Aurora&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, the Prelude in &quot;Les Sylphides&quot;, and Odette in a one-act version of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;. Having danced decorous roles in Ashton&#x27;s &quot;The Lady of Shallot&quot; and Howard&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot;, she appeared in a more boisterous role as the can-can dancer La Goulue in &quot;Bar aux Folies-Bergères&quot; by Ninette de Valois. One reviewer of the roles in Lloyd&#x27;s repertory described her as having &quot;a noble serenity and a deep expressiveness allied to sparkling gifts of comedy.&quot;

In 1938, Tudor had a spat with Rambert and left her company to form his own troupe, which he dubbed the London Ballet. Lloyd was one of the Rambert dancers who became founding members of this newly formed company. For it, she created two more memorable roles. As the Italian ballerina in Tudor&#x27;s &quot;Gala Performance&quot;, she displayed both elegance and wit in competing for the limelight with her French and Russian rivals, and in Howard&#x27;s &quot;La Fête Étrange&quot;, a haunting, dreamlike tale, she was mysteriously beautiful as the bride-to-be who captures the fancy of an adolescent boy. (The Boy was played by the young Frank Staff, a fellow South African and former student of Lloyd&#x27;s in Cape Town.) After the outbreak of war with Germany in September 1939, and Tudor&#x27;s departure for greener, and safer, pastures in America, Lloyd and Peggy van Praagh directed and danced in the company until the blitz caused nearly all the London theaters to close. When the London Ballet folded and was absorbed back into Ballet Rambert in 1940, Lloyd retired from the stage.

==Later life==
In the summer of 1939, Lloyd married Nigel Gosling, an art and dance critic, and settled into retirement to wait out the war years, concentrating on doing welfare work. She began a second career when Richard Buckle persuaded her to start writing reviews of dance performances for his magazine &quot;Ballet&quot;, working in tandem with her husband. Finding the arrangement congenial, they called themselves Alexander Bland, a pseudonym derived from the names of two characters in the tales of Beatrix Potter: Pigling Bland, who is described as &quot;hopelessly volatile&quot; and his brother Alexander. In 1955, when Buckle left his post as dance critic for &quot;The Observer&quot;, a weekly newspaper published on Sunday, the Goslings took over, staying on until Nigel&#x27;s death in 1982. During almost two decades of working together, they not only regularly wrote reviews for the newspaper, but they wrote, edited, or contributed to ten books on ballet and dance, four of which dealt with the life and career of Rudolf Nureyev.

The Goslings had first seen Nureyev dance with the Kirov Ballet in Paris, just before he defected to the West in June 1961. Soon after, when Margot Fonteyn persuaded the young Russian virtuoso to come to London to appear in a gala for the Royal Academy of Dance, she asked the Goslings to befriend him. Taking to this with a will, they came to regard him with particular admiration. In their glowing review of his first Covent Garden performance, they suggested the rejuvenating effect he might have on British ballet, describing him as &quot;a balletic missile, a wild animal loose in the drawing room.&quot; They offered him free run of their Kensington home and helped him to adjust to life in a new country. In time, the friendship deepened, as there was genuine respect and liking on both sides. After the Goslings&#x27; son Nicholas married and moved away, Nureyev became the son of their late middle age. They became, in effect, his surrogate parents, offering him guidance, affection, and hospitality until the end of his and their lives.

Maude Lloyd had enjoyed an ideal marriage with Nigel Gosling, so his death was a devastating loss to her, as it was to Nureyev, who had admired Gosling&#x27;s intelligence, culture, and quiet dignity. Lloyd survived her husband for another twenty years, sustained by the care and attention of Nureyev and others. From her salad days into old age, she was much loved and admired by all who knew her. Elegant and agile, even at 95, she lived out her days in simplicity and with a remarkable mental generosity, despite the failure of both sight and hearing. She died peacefully at her home in Kensington in the presence of family and friends.

<text>Kim Daeseong (; 700–774) was a chief minister of Silla during the reign of King Seongdeok in the Unified Silla period. He was the son of a previous chief minister, Kim Mullyang (김문량, 金文亮). He is credited with the establishment of the famed Bulguksa temple and Seokguram shrine in Gyeongju.

The &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot; relates a tale that Kim Daeseong was the reincarnation of the child of a pious but poor woman who offered up a field which she had worked long and hard to buy. He is said to have built Bulguksa in memory of his parents of the current life, and Seokguram in memory of his parents in the former life.

<text>Perhaps Transparent is a Jersey City, New Jersey–based independent record label founded by Gabriel Walsh and Stephen Connolly. The label releases psychedelic and psychedelic folk. Artists on this label tend to include song, narrative or conceptual structures that are deliberately complicated and/or obscure – Your Team Ring buries puzzles in its albums, Flaming Fire utilizes classic Greek theater elements, Pothole Skinny experiment in the sounds of psychedelic folk, IE: the woods-folk-avant-dark-strings, and Irene Moon&#x27;s music is principally about her interests and research in entomology. PG Six, aka Pat Gubler from Tower Recordings explores song craft through the resurgence of 1960&#x27;s British Follk revival and experimental bray harp drones. Through live CD-R releases, and the vinyl versions of his Amish Records releases, one can get a keen glimpse of Pat&#x27;s Musical journey.

<doc id="1222894" wikidata="Q15034137" url="?curid=1222894" title="The Nimrod Hunt">
<text>The Nimrod Hunt is a 1986 science fiction novel by Charles Sheffield. The story takes place hundreds of years in the future, with humanity having extensively colonized surrounding space, including beyond the Solar System. Humans have encountered three extraterrestrial races, which although all bizarrely different in physiology and psychology coexist peacefully. In order to defend from unknown threats beyond known space, a security company creates highly advanced robotic soldiers to patrol the border. These go haywire and become the single greatest threat. A series of four-member teams, with a representative from each species, is dispatched to deal with the problem. The action of the story follows one such team.

The novel was revised as &quot;The Mind Pool&quot; with a different ending. In the preface to &quot;The Mind Pool&quot;, the author describes how he was unhappy with the original.

==Reception==
&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; book critic Roland J. Green penned a positive of the book, calling it &quot;a considerable feat of both imagination and storytelling&quot;, &quot;a well-told tale, full of wonders thrown off casually like sparks from a sparkler&quot;, and &quot;a treat for readers who like their science fiction loaded with intelligent scientific extrapolation&quot;. &quot;The Baltimore Evening Sun&quot;″s Wiley Hall III found the novel &quot;worth the price&quot; though said the publishers &quot;exaggerated outrageously&quot; when marketing it. In a negative review, Algis Budrys of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; wrote, &quot;What we have here is a book that I think began with too strong a premise.&quot;

The &quot;Commodore Computing International&quot; reviewer D.M. praised the book, stating, &quot;The interplay of the two main &#x27;hunting&#x27; groups and the conniving and double-dealing of the operation&#x27;s joint chiefs of staff, who are deadly rivals, made for gripping reading.&quot; In a mixed review, the authors Charles N. Brown and William G. Contento said, &quot;It told a complex story well, and had some important things to say. I just wish the author had not done a disservice to his own, quite sufficient, storytelling abilities by referencing Alfred Bester so directly and so unnecessarily.&quot; The critic David Pringle gave the book two stars, writing, &quot;The ingenious plot poses questions about the nature of intelligence, but it&#x27;s a pity the prose and characterization are so clunky.&quot;

<doc id="1222895" wikidata="Q7941667" url="?curid=1222895" title="Voodoo Ray">
<text>&quot;Voodoo Ray&quot; is the debut single by British electronic musician Gerald Simpson, recording under the name A Guy Called Gerald. The single was released in the UK in 1988 on the 7&quot; and 12&quot; vinyl formats, on the Rham! label. A version of the track appeared on A Guy Called Gerald&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;Hot Lemonade&quot;, and the original single was later released in the United States in 1989 by Warlock Records.

The single spent 18 weeks on the UK Singles Chart, eventually reaching number 12, and was awarded best-selling independent single of 1989 by &quot;Music Week&quot; and the British Phonographic Industry. The track became a popular acid house anthem associated with Manchester club The Haçienda.

==Recording==
&quot;Voodoo Ray&quot; began as a home demo recorded by Simpson while he was a member of 808 State. It was then re-recorded along with the surrounding EP over two days in June 1988 at Moonraker Studios in Manchester. The session featured production assistance from the duo of Aniff Akinola and Colin Thorpe (together credited as Chapter), as well as engineer Lee Monteverde. Simpson explained: I was trying to keep it quiet from the dudes in 808 State, because I was still working with them but wanted to do my own thing. It was fun just slipping out of their basement and taking the drum machine. They&#x27;d be like, &#x27;Where are you going?&#x27; I&#x27;d say, &#x27;Oh, I&#x27;m just going home to do some programming,&#x27; then nip off to another studio.

The track contains samples of comedians Peter Cook and Dudley Moore (in character as Derek and Clive), from the &quot;Bo Duddley&quot; sketch as heard on their 1976 live album &quot;Derek and Clive (Live).&quot; Two samples from the sketch are heard: one of Cook saying &quot;voodoo rage&quot; and one of Moore shouting &quot;later!&quot;. Simpson explained to &quot;Q&quot; in 2001: &quot;I was trying to get a tribal sound and found this sample saying &#x27;Voodoo rage&#x27;. That was originally the title but the old sampler I was using didn&#x27;t have that much memory. I just about had enough for &#x27;voodoo ra…&#x27;, so that&#x27;s what it became.&quot;

The vocal was sung by Nicola Collier, who had worked on other tracks with Simpson, with the vocal melody suggested by Thorpe and later processed by Simpson using an Akai S950 sampler.

==Release==
Rham! initially pressed up 500 copies of the record, which sold out in a day. &quot;Voodoo Ray&quot; received support from local DJs and became popular at Factory Records&#x27; Manchester nightclub The Haçienda.

A version of the track also appeared on Simpson&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;Hot Lemonade&quot;, and a re-recorded version called &quot;Voodoo Ray Americas&quot; appeared on A Guy Called Gerald&#x27;s 1990 album &quot;Automanikk&quot;, which was released by Columbia and CBS Records. In 1995, Simpson reworked &quot;Voodoo Ray&quot; as &quot;Voodoo Rage&quot; for his &quot;Black Secret Technology&quot; album.

==Critical reception==
Bill Coleman of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine commented on the single in March 1989: &quot;Underground smash in the U.K. last summer utilizes the most intriguing elements of acid house and places them in a thoroughly engrossing dance setting. Yearning female chant and irresistible instrumental hook has the potential to make a huge impression with club and alternative programmers. A killer—don&#x27;t miss.&quot; 

==Impact and legacy==
British electronic music magazine &quot;Mixmag&quot; ranked &quot;Voodoo Ray&quot; number 46 in its &quot;100 Greatest Dance Singles of All Time&quot; list in 1996, writing, &quot;Voodoo Ray is pretty much the first British acid house record, and sounds like it was recorded by banging on metal pipes. Which is nice.&quot;

In the same year, British drum and bass DJ and producer Fabio named it one of his favourites, adding, &quot;&#x27;Voodoo Ray&#x27; is an early drum &amp; bass track because of the way it was layered: the sounds, the working of it. It&#x27;s laid back but at the same time so danceable. We were really into imports at the time and he was the first English guy we got interested in. He kick-started the whole British scene so it&#x27;s a very important track. He&#x27;s so underrated.&quot; Also another English DJ, Tall Paul, named the song one of his Top 10 tracks in 1996, saying, &quot;This was so different at the time. A massive groundbreaker — the girl, the chant and the way she sings.&quot;

In 2019, journalist Matt Anniss wrote that &quot;Voodoo Ray&quot; &quot;may now be one of the most recognizable House records ever made, but the track has lost none of its charm or power.&quot; Anniss also opined that the four-track EP &quot;has held up remarkably well,&quot; calling the additional tracks &quot;similarly weighty, inspired and off kilter.&quot; In 2020, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it among &quot;The 20 Best House Music Songs... Ever!&quot;. In 2022, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Voodoo Ray&quot; number 55 in their &quot;200 Greatest Dance Songs of All Time&quot;. In 2024, &quot;Classic Pop&quot; ranked it number five in their list of &quot;Top 20 80s House Hits&quot;.

==Charts==
==In popular culture==
The song is featured on the soundtrack of Michael Winterbottom&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;, which follows the history of Factory Records and the Madchester scene. The song is also featured on the fictional house radio station SF-UR in the 2004 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;.

The song appears in Cheryl Dunye&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;She Don&#x27;t Fade.&quot;

A steelpan cover version was used in artist Jeremy Deller&#x27;s work &quot;English Magic&quot;, which was displayed at the Venice Biennale in 2013.

<doc id="1222904" wikidata="Q1131293" url="?curid=1222904" title="Coppa Acerbo">
<text>The Coppa Acerbo was an automobile race held in Italy, named after Tito Acerbo, the brother of Giacomo Acerbo, a prominent fascist politician. Following Italy&#x27;s defeat in World War II, and the consequent demise of fascism, the race was renamed the Circuito di Pescara, and in some years was also referred to as the Pescara Grand Prix (&quot;Gran Premio di Pescara&quot;) and 12 Hours of Pescara (&quot;12 Ore di Pescara&quot;). The race was run between 1924 and 1961 and over the years was held to a variety of vehicle class regulations and durations. In the Pescara Grand Prix formed a round of the Formula One World Championship, a race which still holds the record as having the longest circuit length ever used for a Championship event.

==Pescara Circuit==

The Coppa Acerbo races were held over a 24–26 km (15–16 mi) circuit, beginning and ending at Pescara, on the Adriatic coast. The course layout featured an inland route through the Abruzzo hills, that passed through several villages, followed by a long, straight descent back to the coast, where a tight right-hand corner led on to a four-mile (6 km) long straight running next to the sea. The pit and paddock complex was located at the end of this straight. In an effort to slow competitor speeds past these pits the Pescara circuit became one of the first to have an artificial chicane installed, just before the pit lane. The Pescara circuit layout holds the record as the longest circuit to ever to host a Formula One World Championship event, with the Nürburgring Nordschleife coming second at about 23 km.

==Pre-war races==
The first Coppa Acerbo was staged in 1924 and was won by Enzo Ferrari. It was Ferrari&#x27;s fourth and final grand prix victory before he retired to create Ferrari and become head of the Formula One team Scuderia Ferrari. The race was run for the top class of international competition, the only real limiting factor on vehicle specifications being the cars&#x27; ability to transmit power through the inadequate tyres of the day. Although never itself a Grande Epreuve, or later a constituent of the European Championship, the Coppa Acerbo was considered one of the most prestigious races of its day. These early races were dominated by home-grown cars and drivers, and Alfa Romeo in particular was almost unbeatable. The Milanese manufacturer won seven of the first nine editions; only in 1926 were they beaten by the Bugatti T35, and again in 1930 by Italian star-driver Achille Varzi driving a Maserati.

Alfa&#x27;s domination of the race came to an end with the introduction of the 750 kg Grand Prix regulations in 1934, a race that was also marked by tragedy when Guy Moll, one of the most promising young drivers of the day, was killed. Germany&#x27;s state-funded Silver Arrows of Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union would come to eclipse all their rivals for the subsequent five years. Although the race was again won by two Italian drivers during this time, including a second victory for Varzi, it was only when the organisers decided to run the Coppa to the 1.5 litre voiturette formula in 1939 that any other manufacturer could stand a realistic chance of winning. Perhaps fittingly it was Alfa Romeo, with their new 158 &quot;Alfetta&quot; car, that took the honours in this last competition before the outbreak of World War II.
In 1939 a &quot;Coppa Acerbo Song&quot; (with music by maestro Ignazio Civera and lyrics by Franzi) was published.

==Post-war races==
After WWII the race remained suspended for a year during post-war rebuilding. When it was finally run again in 1947 the name of the race was changed, because of its fascist connections, and it became known as the &quot;Circuito di Pescara&quot;. For the first three years the race was run for two-seater sports cars and was a fairly minor constituent in the European racing calendar. However, in common with many race organisers around the continent, with the introduction of the Formula One World Championship in 1950 the race organisers saw their chance to return the Pescara event to its former position of prominence. Although, once again, not a World Championship event the race did attract many top-name teams and drivers over the following two years. Despite it being an Italian event, and himself a former winner, Ferrari decided to withdraw his team from the 1950 event, but the Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Talbot-Lago works teams did attend, along with many privateer and amateur racers. The 1950 race was won by future World Champion Juan Manuel Fangio driving for Alfa Romeo. The following year Ferrari did attend, and the race was won by Fangio&#x27;s Argentinian compatriot José Froilán González driving one of their 375 cars.
When the World Championship switched to the slower Formula Two regulations, the organisers decided to abandon formula racing in favour of further sportscar events. During this period endurance sportscar racing was almost as prestigious as the top open-wheel series, and for 1952 the organisers changed the race&#x27;s name, once again, to the &quot;12 Ore di Pescara&quot; (12 Hours of Pescara). The change of format did not hinder Ferrari&#x27;s chances of victory, however, and their cars and drivers took wins in both 1952 and 1953. Despite the success of the endurance format, though, when the Formula One engine capacity limit was raised to 2.5 litres from 1954 the Circuito di Pescara was quickly switched back to single-seat rules. The 1954 event was won by one of the most iconic Formula One cars of all time, a Maserati 250F, driven by Luigi Musso. This was to be the last race for two years, as in 1955, as a result of the disaster at the 24 hours of Le Mans, the race was cancelled. Sportscars returned once more in 1956.

The 1957 Pescara Grand Prix, held on 18 August 1957, was the seventh, and penultimate round of the 1957 World Drivers&#x27; Championship. The race, which was the only Formula One World Championship race at the track, is best remembered for being held at the longest ever circuit to stage a Formula One World Championship Grand Prix. It was also the first of the two consecutive Italian races, and after the subsequent race at Monza was complete, it became the first time that two Formula One races had been held in the same country in the same year. In a field dominated by numerous Maserati 250F cars, reigning World Champion Fangio used his example to set a pole position time of 9 minutes 44.6 seconds, at an average speed of over 157 km/h (98 mph). In the race, however, it was second-placed starter Stirling Moss in his Vanwall who took the initiative and victory. He led all but one of the race&#x27;s 18 laps and finished over three minutes clear of Fangio in second place.

By the early 1960s, safety issues had become a major concern and the Pescara racecourse was seen as too dangerous for major international events. After a two-year break the race was downgraded to Formula Two status for 1960, a race won by future World Champion Denny Hulme in his first year racing in Europe. For its 1961 swansong once again, for only the second time in its history, the Pescara race was raised to World Championship status, this time in the World Sportscar Championship. Appropriately, for a race subtitled the 4h Testa Rossa, the final Gran Premio di Pescara was won by a Ferrari Testa Rossa, driven by Lorenzo Bandini and Giorgio Scarlatti and entered by Scuderia Centro Sud; an Italian team, with an Italian car and two Italian drivers, won the final iteration of this famous Italian event. With ever-increasing speeds and the fragile build-quality of most cars of the time, the race was discontinued after the 1961 event.

<text>Illinois Route 56 (IL 56) is a east–west state highway in northern and northeastern Illinois. It runs from the interchange of Illinois Route 47 at U.S. Route 30 (US 30) in Sugar Grove east to US 12/US 20/US 45 (Mannheim Road) by Bellwood. It is one of only three state highways (the other being IL 110 and IL 390) that require tolls.

== Route description ==
IL 56 begins at a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 30/IL 47 in Sugar Grove, located east of the Aurora Municipal Airport. While US 30 exits the road to travel south toward Montgomery, the road continues as IL 56. The road becomes a free limited-access road for the next . IL 56 then meets Galena Boulevard at another partial cloverleaf interchange, which directly connects to Aurora and its downtown area. With the exception of the Golf View Road junction for westbound traffic, this interchange is the only intermediate exit between US 30/IL 47 and I-88. Travelling eastbound, IL 56 merges with I-88 just west of Orchard Road and continues along the tollway until intersecting with IL 31. The route travels north along IL 31 until turning east along State Street in North Aurora. The route then crosses over the Fox River before traveling along a sharp S-curve.

IL 56 travels along Butterfield Road in an east-northeast direction beyond IL 25, paralleling I-88. Butterfield Road serves as a major arterial road within the Illinois Technology and Research Corridor. Between the Batavia Spur of the Illinois Prairie Path and the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway overpass, IL 56 serves as the southern border for Fermilab. Beyond the EJ&amp;E Railway overpass, the road becomes a divided highway. IL 56 then parallels the Aurora branch of the Illinois Prairie Path between IL 59 and St. James Farm. IL 56 goes through commercial and industrial developments beyond I-355 in Downers Grove, such as Yorktown Center in Lombard. In Oak Brook, IL 56 exits off the mainline to continue along Butterfield Road; traffic continuing straight would end up on 22nd Street. IL 56 then meets IL 83 and IL 38 at a series of interchanges north of the Oakbrook Center. The surrounding commercial development wanes as IL 56 goes through residential areas in Elmhurst, Hillside, and Bellwood. In Bellwood, IL 56 leaves Butterfield Road and briefly travels east along Washington Boulevard before ending at US 12/US 20/US 45 (Mannheim Road).

== History ==
SBI Route 56 was the current IL 56 from Oak Brook to Bellwood on Butterfield Road. IL 56 originally traveled from US 330/IL 6 (now IL 38) in Oak Brook to US 45/IL 46 (now US 12/US 20/US 45) in Bellwood. It was then extended to US 20/IL 43 in 1934 in Oak Park. In 1942, IL 56 was extended southwest to IL 55 (22nd Street).

In 1972, the eastern end was truncated to its current location.

IL 55 originally ran from IL 54 (now IL 83) in Oak Brook to Michigan Avenue in Chicago via Cermak Road, Ogden Avenue, and 12th Street. IL 55 was removed east of Ogden Avenue in 1934. In 1940, IL 55 was extended west along 22nd Street and Butterfield Road to IL 53. By 1953, IL 55 was extended further west to IL 25 in North Aurora. With the opening of the East-West Tollway in 1958, IL 55 was extended west along IL 31 and the newly-built tollway to US 30/IL 47 in Sugar Grove.

On April 2, 1965, the Illinois State Division of Highways announced that IL 56 would replace IL 55 west of 22nd Street, which was duplicated by the designation of Interstate 55 in DuPage and Cook counties. The rest of IL 55 along Cermak Road was removed.

<text>June Haver (born Beverly June Stovenour; June 10, 1926 – July 4, 2005) was an American film actress, singer and dancer. Once groomed by 20th Century Fox to be &quot;the next Betty Grable,&quot; Haver appeared in a string of musicals, but she never achieved Grable&#x27;s popularity. Haver&#x27;s second husband was the actor Fred MacMurray, whom she married after she retired from showbusiness.

==Early life==
Beverly June Stovenour was born in Rock Island, Illinois, and later took the surname of her stepfather, Bert Haver. Her mother Maria Haver (née Carter) was an actress and her father Fred Christian Stovenour was a musician. After the family moved to Ohio, seven-year-old Haver entered and won a contest of the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music. At age eight, she won a film test by imitating famous actresses including Greta Garbo, Katharine Hepburn and Helen Hayes, but her mother prohibited her from becoming a child actress because she felt that Haver was too young to work in the film industry.

When Haver was 10, the family returned to Rock Island, where she began performing for Rudy Vallée and became a well-known child star on the radio. She worked regularly as a band singer by the time that she was in her teens, performing with the Ted Fio Rito Orchestra for $75 a week. She also worked with bandleaders Dick Jurgens and Freddy Martin.

==Career==
In the summer of 1942, Haver moved to Hollywood, where she finished high school. She acted in plays in her spare time, and during a performance as a southern belle, she was discovered by a scout from 20th Century Fox. In 1943, Haver signed a $3,500-per-week contract with the studio and made her film debut playing an uncredited role as a hat-check girl in &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot;. She was dropped shortly after because the studio executives felt that she looked too young, but she was later signed again after her costume and hairstyle were changed.

20th Century Fox had plans to mold Haver as a glamour girl stand-in for the studio&#x27;s two greatest stars, Alice Faye and Betty Grable. She debuted on screen in a supporting role as Cri-Cri in &quot;Home in Indiana&quot; (1944) and had just turned 17 years old when her scenes were filmed. Even before &quot;Home in Indiana&quot; was released, she was assigned to replace Faye in the Technicolor musical &quot;Irish Eyes Are Smiling&quot;. Later that year, she costarred with her future husband Fred MacMurray in &quot;Where Do We Go From Here?&quot;, which was the only time that the pair appeared together in a film.

During her career at Fox, Haver was originally groomed to be the next Betty Grable (standing a diminutive 5&#x27;2&quot;, she was known as &quot;Pocket Grable&quot;). She costarred with Grable in the 1945 film &quot;The Dolly Sisters&quot;, for which she had to gain weight. While filming, rumors about a possible clash between the two actresses arose, mostly because of their frequent comparison, but Haver said: &quot;Betty is a big star and I&#x27;m just starting. I try to be nice to her, and she reciprocated by being just as nice to me. It&#x27;s silly to think two girls can&#x27;t work together without quarreling. You see, I&#x27;ve two sisters. I&#x27;m the ham between the bread and butter — the middle sister — and I understand girls pretty well. Betty likes to talk about her baby, so we talk about her baby.&quot;

In 1946, Haver starred and received top billing in &quot;Wake Up and Dream&quot; and &quot;Three Little Girls in Blue&quot;, both of which were well-received and brought moderate success. The following year, the role of Katie was written into the film &quot;I Wonder Who&#x27;s Kissing Her Now&quot; just for Haver.

Haver&#x27;s comedy star turn in 1948&#x27;s &quot;Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay!&quot; was a major success. The same year, she starred as Marilyn Miller in the musical &quot;Look for the Silver Lining&quot; (1949).

The following year, she starred in &quot;The Daughter of Rosie O&#x27;Grady&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Get By&quot;. In 1951, Haver was teamed with Fox&#x27;s newest asset, Marilyn Monroe, and previous costar William Lundigan (her co-star from &quot;I&#x27;ll Get By&quot;) in the low-budget comedy &quot;Love Nest&quot;. Though Haver was the lead and received top billing, most of the film&#x27;s publicity centered on Monroe, who had a minor role and garnered under-the-title billing. &quot;Love Nest&quot; was Haver&#x27;s only full-length film in black and white. Her other 15 films between 1943 and 1953 were shot in three-strip Technicolor.

Following her marriage to MacMurray in 1954, Haver mostly retired from acting (her last appearances were as herself on &quot;The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour&quot; in 1958 and in &quot;Disneyland &#x27;59&quot;). Her final film appearance was in 1953&#x27;s &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot;. Haver and MacMurray adopted two daughters and remained together until MacMurray&#x27;s death in 1991.

At the urging of friends Ann Miller and Ann Rutherford, Haver finally joined the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences at the age of 75. For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Haver has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1777 Vine Street.

==Personal life==
Haver insisted that she had always been very close with her family. Her sisters followed her to Hollywood and served as her stand-ins, and her mother was Haver&#x27;s personal secretary.

On March 9, 1947, Haver married trumpet player James Zito. She had met him at age 15 while touring with Ted Fio Rito&#x27;s orchestra. They initially lost contact after Haver moved from Illinois to Beverly Hills but started dating when Haver made a short visit to her home town when she was already a film actress. Haver filed for divorce less than a year after eloping with Zito, winning interlocutory decree on March 25, 1948. She admitted to the press that the marriage was a failure from the beginning, saying: &quot;I want to forget as soon as possible. We hadn&#x27;t been married hours before I realized I had never really known Jimmy. He was a stranger. He was either down in the dumps or up high. I never knew from one moment to the next how he would be.&quot;

After her divorce from Zito, Haver started dating Dr. John L. Duzik, whom she had dated before her marriage to Zito. They planned to marry, but Duzik died on October 31, 1949, following surgery complications. While taking care of him in his final days, she started attending church more often. According to friends, she was inspired to become a nun during this period. Following Duzik&#x27;s death, Haver reportedly became tired of Hollywood and did not fall in love with the men whom she dated afterward. In February 1953, Haver became a postulant nun with the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth, an organization based in Leavenworth, Kansas, and she stayed until October, saying she left because of &quot;poor health.&quot;

Around this time, Haver met Fred MacMurray, one of the wealthiest and most conservative actors in Hollywood, and a romantic relationship developed. On June 28, 1954, they were married. She told the press: &quot;When I married Fred, he was terribly set in his ways. He was a fuss-budget. He hadn&#x27;t quite progressed to being a lint picker, but he was already an ash-tray emptier, and that&#x27;s just about as set in his ways as a man can get.&quot; Haver insisted on adopting a girl, but MacMurray, 18 years her senior, initially refused, explaining that he already had been a father. Shortly after, he agreed to adopt a child and, with the help of a doctor, they were able to adopt twin daughters. MacMurray died in 1991.

Haver died from respiratory failure on July 4, 2005, in Brentwood, California, at the age of 79. She was buried with MacMurray at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

Haver was a Republican and supported Dwight Eisenhower during the 1952 presidential election.

<text>The Grand Prix du Comminges was an automobile race held in France. 

The race was named after the Comminges, one of the former Provinces of France in ancient Gascony in what is now the Haute-Garonne department of the Midi-Pyrénées region of France. The race began as part of a week-long festival organized by local officials in the town of Saint-Gaudens designed to attract tourists.

Grand Prix motor racing was at its zenith when the first race was first held in 1925 on a course from Saint-Gaudens to the town of Montréjeau and back again via a different route. The hilly terrain allowed for excellent viewing close to the beginning and end of the race from atop a hill at the outskirts of Saint-Gaudens. The course layout was modified a few times beginning with changes made to accommodate holding the official French Grand Prix in 1928.

At the 1932 race René Dreyfus was leading in his Bugatti going into the final lap. Rain fell and on the wet road he spun out on a sharp curve. Dreyfus was thrown from the vehicle as it somersaulted through the air but suffered only minor injuries. However, his car hurtled directly towards a large group of spectators gathered off to the side of the road but hit a small tree and smashed to the ground without injuring anyone. 

Due to a controversy over vehicle regulations, both the 1937 and 1938 races had to be cancelled when major factory teams boycotted the event. After World War II, the creation of Formula One saw the Grand Prix du Comminges modified to a Formula Two event but, with the top drivers no longer competing, economics dictated cancellation after the 1952 race.

<doc id="1222934" wikidata="Q252362" url="?curid=1222934" title="Cerro Chirripó">
<text>Cerro Chirripó is the highest mountain in Costa Rica, with an elevation of 3,821 meters (12,536 feet). It is part of the Cordillera de Talamanca, and the range&#x27;s highest point. It is located in Chirripó National Park and is noted for its ecological wealth. The mountain was named &quot;Chirripo&quot;, meaning &quot;land of eternal waters&quot;, by indigenous Costa Ricans because there are many lakes and streams around the mountain. The high peaks in Chirripó National Park and La Amistad International Park host important areas of Talamancan montane forest and Costa Rican Páramo with high endemism and extremely high biodiversity. The peaks of these mountains constitute sky islands for many species of plants and animals. Snow has not fallen on the peak in the past 100 years or so, according to the University of Costa Rica, but hail is sometimes reported.

The great height of Mount Chirripó relative to its surroundings is also evidenced by its particularly high topographic prominence of , which makes it the 37th most prominent peak in the world. On clear days it is possible to see across the country from the Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean Sea.

Climbing Mount Chirripó is possible by obtaining a permit from the National Park office in San Gerardo de Rivas. From the trailhead, the summit can be reached via a 19.5-kilometer (12.1 mile) hike.
==Geography==
Chirripó is the 37th most prominent peak in the world. The most abundant ecosystem in the mountains is the páramo, extending across almost all the mountains. It also has a large number of lakes on the top, this is because during the ice age it was covered with snow, but when the ice melted these unique glacial lakes were formed.

===Climate===
Temperatures on Mount Chirripo during the day can range between , and at night they can drop from . The coldest temperature ever documented in Costa Rica was recorded here ().

==History==
The earliest known civilization to inhabit the area of Chirripó was the indigenous Cabécar people. In 1904, Agustín Blessing Presinger became the first known European to climb the peak. 

The first official hiking trail was constructed in 1965; it led to a small sheet-metal hut five kilometers away from the peak. Today, the hut has been replaced by a concrete building visited by 7,000 people each year. In 1975, Chirripó National Park was founded, enclosing and protecting 500 square kilometers of rain forest and mountains around the peak.

Since 1953, there have been five major wildfires in the area. Forest fires occurred in 1976, in the 1990s, and in 2012.

==Ecology==
The biodiversity on Chirripó is diverse, in the lowest parts of the mountains, dominate the cloud forest, with oak trees no higher than 50 meters, accompanied with mosses, lichen and orchids. While in the upper parts of the mountain the páramo predominates, an ecosystem characterized by short and dry grass.

Among the animals that inhabit the area, squirrels, hummingbirds, rabbits, quetzals, frogs, white-nosed coati and even jaguars habit the mountains.

==Route==
The hike starts 1,500 meters (4,900 ft) above sea level in the village of San Gerardo in the Talamanca Range. From the valley, the path rises through fields and woodlands before ascending through lush rainforest. The forest gradually turns into scrubland. The trail continuously ascends and descends through ridges and valleys until it reaches the final visitors&#x27; refuge at 3,392 meters. From the refuge, there is a remaining two hour hike. Once the last ridge is crossed, there is a remaining 200 meters of steep path. The summit is a 6-meter wide platform of rocks.

<text>Špilberk Castle (; , locally &quot;Špilas&quot;) is a castle on the hilltop in Brno, Southern Moravia. Its construction began as early as the first half of the 13th century by the Přemyslid kings and completed by King Ottokar II of Bohemia. From a major royal castle established around the mid-13th century, and the seat of the Moravian margraves in the mid-14th century, it was gradually turned into a huge baroque citadel considered the harshest prison in the Austrian Empire, and then into barracks. This prison had always been part of the Špilberk fortress and is frequently referenced by the main character, Fabrizio, in Stendhal&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Charterhouse of Parma&quot;.

==History==
Špilberk castle, royal house.JPG

In 1620, after losing The Battle of White Mountain on November 8, the leading Moravian members of the anti-Habsburg insurrection were imprisoned in Špilberk for several years. The town of Brno bought the castle in 1560 and made it into a municipal fortress. The bastion fortifications of Špilberk helped Brno to defend itself against Swedish raids during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, and then successful defence led to further fortification and the strengthening of the military function of the fortress.

At the same time Špilberk was used as a prison. Protestants were the first prisoners forced to serve time here, followed later by participants in the revolutions of 1848–49, although hardened criminals, thieves and petty criminals were also kept here. Franz Freiherr von der Trenck, Austrian soldier and one of the most controversial persons of the period was also jailed and died here on October 4, 1749. Later, apart from several significant French revolutionaries captured during the coalition wars with France, Jean-Baptiste Drouet, famous as the former postmaster of Sainte-Menehould who had arrested King Louis XVI, was the most known of them all. A group of fifteen Hungarian Jacobins led by the writer Ferenc Kazinczy was also especially noteworthy.
More than a quarter of a century later, from 1822 on, specially constructed cells for &quot;state prisoners&quot; in the northern wing of the former fortress were filled with Italian patriots known as Carbonari, who had fought for the unification, freedom and independence of their country. The poet Silvio Pellico, who served a full eight years here, made the Špilberk prison famous all over Europe with his book &quot;Le mie prigioni – My prisons&quot;.

The last large &quot;national&quot; group of political prisoners at Špilberk consisted of nearly 200 Polish revolutionaries, mostly participants in the Kraków Uprising of 1846. After that, the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph dissolved the Špilberk prison in 1855, and after departure of the last prisoners three years later, its premises were converted into barracks which remained as such for the next hundred years.

Špilberk entered public consciousness as a centre of tribulation and oppression on two more occasions; firstly, during the First World War when, together with military prisoners, civilian objectors to the Austro-Hungarian regime were imprisoned here, and secondly in the first year of the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia. Several thousand Czech patriots suffered in Špilberk at that time, some of whom were put to death. For the majority of them however, Špilberk was only a station on their way to other German prisons and Nazi concentration camps. In 1939–41, the German army and Gestapo carried out an extensive reconstruction at Špilberk in order to turn it into model barracks in the spirit of the romantic historicism of the German Third Reich ideology. 

The Czechoslovak army left Špilberk in 1959, putting to a definite end its military era. The following year, Špilberk became the seat of the Brno City Museum.

<text>Nicolae Golescu (1810–1877) was a Wallachian Romanian politician who served as the Prime Minister of Romania in 1860 and May–November 1868.

==Early life==
A member of the Golescu family of boyars, Nicolae was born in Câmpulung as the son of Dinicu Golescu; he was educated together with his other three brothers in Switzerland. Nicolae and his brother Ștefan returned in 1830 to join the Wallachian Army, where Nicolae became a major in 1834.

In the same year he joined the &quot;Philharmonic Society&quot;, a group similar to the Freemasonry. In 1840 he was a prosecutor in the trial of the participants in the Mitică Filipescu plot, and later on he was Wallachia&#x27;s Minister of Internal Affairs.

In 1842, Wallachia was under the protectorate of Imperial Russia, and Nicolae Golescu tried to obtain the mandate of Prince of Wallachia from Emperor Nicholas, but was denied and remained a Minister of Internal Affairs until 1847. In the meantime, he began taking part in gatherings of various revolutionary societies.

He joined the radical liberals, being part of the 1848 revolutionary committee, together with Ion Ghica, Nicolae Bălcescu, Ion Heliade Rădulescu and others (including his brother Ștefan and his cousin Alexandru G. Golescu).

==Prominence==
Afterwards, on 11 June 1848, when the Wallachian revolution started in Bucharest, Nicolae Golescu was a Minister of Internal Affairs for the Provisional Government. The following week, he and Ana Ipătescu took initiative in rallying civilians in defense of the revolutionary power, as it was threatened by conservative plot (June 19).

However, on 25 July, the government resigned on pressure from the Ottoman Empire, and after the Ottoman intervention of September, Nicolae Golescu went into exile, to return in the 1850s and support Alexandru Ioan Cuza&#x27;s bid for the throne of a united Danubian Principalities (Wallachia and Moldavia).

In 1866, after joining the alliance of Liberals and Conservatives against Cuza&#x27;s unsanctioned personal regime, he was for a short time one of the regents. He was then Foreign Minister and a member of Ion C. Brătianu&#x27;s Liberal Party, formed during the rule of Carol I.

<doc id="1222947" wikidata="Q2338382" url="?curid=1222947" title="Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses">
<text>is a video game developed by Konami based on the manga series &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;. The game was released on September 6, 2001 in Japan, and worldwide throughout 2003. The story is a sequel to &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories&quot; and is loosely based on the Wars of the Roses. The series&#x27; main characters, Yugi Mutou and Seto Kaiba, play opposing teams known as the Lancastrians and the Yorkists. Each team is playable, battling various characters throughout the plot to prevent a ritual summoning by using sorcerous rose cards.

Using designs by creator Kazuki Takahashi, the game&#x27;s battle system is based on a chessboard-style battlefield, with over 800 cards from the franchise. Several new features of &quot;The Duelist of the Roses&quot; differ from the original card game, such as altered card effects, terrain placement, reincarnations, and deck leader promotions. In addition, each monster card features updated 3D computer graphics modelling, which first appeared in &quot;Forbidden Memories&quot;. Due to content censorship, dialogue and visuals were changed to allow distribution in North America and Europe. 

&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelist of the Roses&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. Some publications praised its story and visuals, while the majority of criticism focused on the gameplay, lack of innovation, and high difficulty. The game was a commercial success, selling over one million units worldwide. Sony Computer Entertainment went on to commemorate the game with a Greatest Hits title, and it stands as one of the best-selling video games for the PlayStation 2 format.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay begins with a dialogue between Seto Kaiba and Simon McMooran. First, McMooran allows the player to choose from several starter decks with a lead deck leader; each deck leader is dealt in threes, based on the name that McMooran requests at the beginning of the game. Kaiba then allows the player to choose between two teams: the Lancastrians (Red Rose) or the Yorkists (White Rose). Each choice later determines which characters to face in future duels, which are displayed on a world map within the game.

Each duel takes place on a 7x7 battlefield that resembles a chessboard. Each space has a unique terrain that is specific to the character they are fighting. Different terrains (such as normal, forest, meadow, dark, sea, wasteland, mountain, toon, crush, and labyrinth) can increase or decrease different types of monsters&#x27; attack and defence by 500 points, as well as increase each character&#x27;s movement space. Three terrains have special effects: labyrinth, which no cards can pass through except for a few monsters with special effects; crush, which destroys monsters with less than 1500 attack points; and toon, which weakens all monsters except toon monsters.

Each duelist includes a &quot;Deck Leader&quot; who is also placed on the battlefield. It represents the duelists and can move around the battlefield while being vulnerable to attacks from the opponent. Each deck leader has a total of forty cards per duel; each deck has a &quot;deck cost&quot;, which is a card&#x27;s strength-based value. For each battle, the deck must be less than a specific deck cost that is significant to the opponent. Each deck leader can play one card per turn and is placed adjacent to them. When two monster cards collide on the field, they are flipped face up, and a battle is commenced similar to the trading card game, with life points deducted accordingly. Spell and trap cards can also be placed throughout the field and activated under a variety of conditions.

The duel ends when one player&#x27;s life points are depleted, or when a player ends a turn with their deck leader completely surrounded by enemy monsters in their summoning areas. Additionally, a duel can end after 99 turns, and the player with the most remaining life points is declared the winner. After winning the duel, players can obtain the opponents&#x27; cards that were placed in their graveyard during the duel, using a system known as &quot;graveyard slots&quot;; the mechanism is similar to that of slot machines. Players can also obtain cards through the &quot;Reincarnation&quot; system in their deck menu, which allows them to sacrifice one card in exchange for three random cards.

Monsters can be promoted throughout the game and earn experience by surviving each duel, destroying enemy monsters, and attacking the opposing deck leader. When a monster has gained enough experience, it is promoted to the next rank. To act as a deck leader, a monster must have been promoted at least once. Some deck leaders have unique abilities based on their type and rank, such as increasing and decreasing nearby monsters&#x27; points, increasing life points, and moving an additional space on the field.

==Plot==
The game is loosely based on the Wars of the Roses, a series of conflicts fought between the House of Lancaster and House of York for control of England in the 15th century. Yugi Mutou takes on the role of Henry Tudor, the head of the House of Tudor, while Seto Kaiba plays Christian Rosenkreuz, the leader of the Yorkist clan force. Other characters from the series take on the roles and names of those involved in the conflict.

The player controls the &quot;Rose Duelist,&quot; who is summoned from an unknown time period to 1485 by a Lancastrian druid to help them defeat the Yorkists and reclaim the throne. Both sides have eight &quot;rose cards&quot; with sorcerous abilities. The Lancastrians want the Yorkists&#x27; white rose cards because Seto&#x27;s forces are using their power to create a barrier that protects their territory, and the Yorkists want the Lancastrians&#x27; red rose cards because Seto needs all 16 rose cards to attempt a forbidden &quot;rose summoning&quot; that would give the Yorkists great power. The Rose Duelist also requires all 16 cards to conjure enough power to return to their appropriate time period, forcing the player to choose a side.

If the Lancastrians are sided with, the Rose Duelist obtains the white rose cards by defeating the Yorkist forces, which are represented by antagonists Maximillion Pegasus, Weevil Underwood, and Rex Raptor. The Rose Duelist finally defeats Seto for the final rose card at Stonehenge, but the victory is fleeting as Seto reveals that the power released from their duel (along with all of the rose cards brought to the site by the Rose Duelist) has fulfilled the requirements for the great summoning, and that he feigned allegiance to the Yorkists to force the Lancastrians to summon the Rose Duelist in the first place. Seto then summons Manawyddan fab Llyr, a powerful mythological figure known as the card guardian, whom he intends to use to establish his rule over England. The Rose Duelist defeats Manawyddan fab Llyr and banishes him from the time period, ensuring Lancastrian victory. According to the epilogue, Yugi was crowned King of England, but it is unknown whether the Rose Duelist were ever returned to the time period from which they were summoned.

If the Yorkists are sided with, the Rose Duelist will face Yu-Gi-Oh! series protagonists like Joey Wheeler, Téa Gardner, and Mutou. After collecting all of the rose cards, Seto summons Manawyddan fab Llyr once more at Stonehenge. This time, however, Manawyddan reveals himself to be Nitemare&#x27;s brother from &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories&quot;, and he is furious that they summoned his brother in Egypt only to lock him away again. To end the summoning, the Rose Duelist must defeat Manawyddan fab Llyr. After the duel, Seto informs the Rose Duelist that he has been looking for a true card guardian for a long time because an ancestor of his made a pact with one (again, referencing &quot;Forbidden Memories&quot;). Seto abandons the Rose Duelist with his white rose pendant, and his forces flee England, allowing the Lancastrians to take control of the throne.

==Release and marketing==
On September 6, 2001, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelist of the Roses&quot; was released exclusively in Japan for the PlayStation 2. It is a sequel to &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories&quot;, the tenth overall instalment of the series, and Konami&#x27;s first &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; release for the PlayStation 2 platform. The game was titled &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! True Duel Monsters II: Inherited Memories&quot; in Japan, and early releases included the Japanese versions of three out of five cards: &quot;Fairy King Truesdale&quot;, &quot;Cypher Solder&quot;, &quot;Slate Warrior&quot;, &quot;Electromagnetic Bagworm&quot;, and &quot;Rigours Reaver&quot;.

Due to censorship issues, content from the original Japanese release had to be reworked before the game was released in North America and Europe. Several elements related to Christianity and other religious symbolism, which were used throughout the historical accuracy of the game&#x27;s plot, were removed. Furthermore, several card artworks and monster animations were edited to include more clothing because it appeared provocative and graphic. 

Initial copies were shipped on February 13, 2003. Three days later, it received a wide release throughout North America, with early releases included three cards: &quot;Alpha the Magnet Warrior,&quot; &quot;Beta the Magnet Warrior,&quot; and &quot;Gamma the Magnet Warrior&quot;. On September 26, 2003, &quot;The Duelist of the Roses&quot; was released throughout Europe. In December 2002, it was re-released as a Greatest Hits title in Japan, followed by North America and Europe in 2004.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelist of the Roses&quot; garnered mixed reviews from critics. On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average based on ratings from publications, the video game scored 59 out of 100 based on 14 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot;. On GameRankings, which assigns a similar metric average, the game scored 63% out of 100. Some critics praised the game&#x27;s overall accuracy to the original card game. Andrew Reiner, writing for Game Informer, stated that &quot;If a small portion of you has always wondered what a game like this is all about, this is the best card game that money can buy.&quot; &quot;Absolutely Playstation&quot; also gave it a positive review, echoing similar sentiments about the game&#x27;s faithfulness to the original franchise. Michael J. Nam of &quot;GameSpy&quot; praised the &quot;interesting&quot; story for &quot;diverging from the typical rehashing of a franchise universe seen in many similar tie-ins.&quot;

Most publications were split about the game&#x27;s mechanism and features. &quot;Play Magazine&quot; praised the game as a &quot;beautifully produced, rule heavy, text heavy, story heavy, lore heavy, chess-like card battle royale,&quot; while &quot;GameNOW&quot; stated that &quot;As you get deeper into the game, the attack/defence system starts to make sense, and the whole play experience becomes very tense and strategic.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; had a mixed reaction to the gameplay, but ultimately said that it was &quot;best appreciated by newcomers to the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh&quot; game who want to learn how to play.&quot; Conversely, &quot;G4TV&quot; thought the game was &quot;really freaking hard,&quot; while &quot;PGNx Media&quot; called it a &quot;run-of-the-mill game.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; compared the game negatively to the original trading card methods, saying &quot;The presentation is terribly stripped-down, and as an odd duck sort of hybrid strategy game, it doesn&#x27;t offer much accessibility or depth.&quot; &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; called the game &quot;surprisingly addictive&quot; but found it to be a difficult experience to play.

Some critics thought &quot;The Duelist of the Roses&quot; was a letdown for the series. &quot;PSX Nation&quot; stated that the game was &quot;strictly for fanboys, PS2 library completists, or masochists in search of a higher-than-normal threshold of pain in their interactive diet.&quot; &quot;Official PlayStation Magazine&quot; added that the game&#x27;s difficulty was &quot;ratcheted up so high&quot; and &quot;designed to make you feel like a total loser.&quot; &quot;Netjak&quot; compared it to &quot;Forbidden Memories&quot; and found it &quot;confusi[ng] and frustrat[ing].&quot; &quot;Yahoo!&quot; gave it a negative review, writing that &quot;When these sorts of loaded odds are all you get in lieu of a competitive computer player, the whole thing feels like you&#x27;re being cheated rather than challenged.&quot;

===Commercial sales===
&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelist of the Roses&quot; was a commercial success. Between January 2000 and 2005, the game sold 68,420 copies in Japan, ranking as the 30th best-selling video game in the country. Since April 2020, it has sold a total of 76,248 units across the country. Despite its sales, it was the lowest-performing game in the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; series, selling less than &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Monster Capsule GB&quot;, which sold 129,095 units in Japan.

&quot;Duelist of the Roses&quot; sold 859,966 units in the United States between January 2000 and 2005. By July 2006, the game sold 950,000 copies; &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 60th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006. By 2010, &quot;The Duelist of the Roses&quot; had sold over 1.11 million copies throughout North America. Konami confirmed that the game sold 1.37 million units between the United States and Europe.

<text>The Impressionable Jon Culshaw is a satire sketch show starring the impressionist Jon Culshaw, made by Ronin Entertainment. A deal with ITV enabled Culshaw to make this while simultaneously starring in BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;. He also starred in the show &quot;Alter Ego&quot;, which was shown on ITV and was made prior to &quot;The Impressionable Jon Culshaw&quot;. The show ran for six episodes in one series from 25 February to 31 March 2004.

The show has been criticised for having too many impressions, with some feeling that Culshaw did not do some of the characters justice. This is unsurprising, as Culshaw&#x27;s repertoire of impressions numbers over 350. Culshaw used most of the impressions that featured on &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, but there were some new ones. Some of the more notable impressions are those of Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, George W. Bush and Trevor McDonald. The show received praise for its production values which were higher than &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;.

Some of the characters impersonated also featured in person on the show, where they meet Culshaw, who is impersonating them, and they interview themselves. This idea first featured in &quot;Alter Ego&quot;.

<doc id="1222960" wikidata="Q481599" url="?curid=1222960" title="Karat (band)">
<text>Karat (Ger. for &quot;carat&quot;) is a German rock band, founded in 1975 in East Berlin, then part of the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany. Karat also gained a strong following in West Germany when its 1982 album &quot;Der blaue Planet&quot; (&quot;The Blue Planet&quot;) was one of the year&#x27;s top sellers in both East and West Germany, making Karat one of the more prominent bands in German-language rock music.

== History ==


Karat developed out of the East Berlin jazz-rock fusion group Panta Rhei, which lost much of its focus in 1973 when its lead-singer Veronika Fischer left to pursue a solo career, and dissolved in 1975 when three further members left to form a new band named Karat. The initial Karat lineup consisted of: singer Hans-Joachim &quot;Neumi&quot; Neumann, keyboardist and songwriter Ulrich &quot;Ed&quot; Swillms, bassist Henning Protzmann, drummer Konrad &quot;Conny&quot; Burkert, acoustic guitarist Herbert Dreilich, and electric guitarist Ulrich Pexa.
The following year Burkert was replaced by Michael Schwandt, and Pexa by Bernd Römer. Neumann left in 1977 due to military service, after which Austrian-born Dreilich became the band&#x27;s vocalist.

By 1978, Karat had released several singles, and these were compiled together with other original songs into a debut self-titled album. Although most of this was fairly pedestrian German-language rock, it contained the hit single &quot;König der Welt&quot; (&quot;King of the World&quot;), a song which stood out and established Karat&#x27;s signature style of a melodic brand of progressive rock. Poet Kurt Demmler wrote the words to this song, which like much of Karat&#x27;s later output were philosophical in character.

Karat&#x27;s second album, titled &quot;Über sieben Brücken&quot; (&quot;Across Seven Bridges&quot;) and released in 1979, brought the band a great deal of attention. It included the seven-minute long, classically structured &quot;Albatros&quot; (&quot;Albatross&quot;), the lyrics to which (&quot;... der Albatros kennt keine Grenzen.&quot;/&quot;... the albatross knows no borders.&quot;) had a double meaning that implied an indirect criticism of the GDR&#x27;s austere travel restrictions and the Berlin Wall. The title track &quot;Über sieben Brücken mußt Du geh&#x27;n&quot; (&quot;You Must Cross Seven Bridges&quot;) is still the band&#x27;s best-known song. Its deeply moving personal reflection introduced Karat to audiences outside of East Germany, especially when West German singer Peter Maffay recorded a cover version of it that became a massive hit for him in 1980.

Karat&#x27;s third album, titled &quot;Schwanenkönig&quot; (&quot;Swan-King&quot;) and released in 1980, expanded the band&#x27;s following in both East and West Germany, although it failed to produce any top hits. Its cerebral lyrics were penned by journalist Norbert Kaiser, who continued to author many of the band&#x27;s lyrics over the following six years.

In contrast, the 1982 album &quot;Der blaue Planet&quot; (&quot;The Blue Planet&quot;) sold more than 1.3 million copies, propelled by its uptempo, radio-friendly title track referring to the looming dangers of nuclear and environmental cataclysm (a topic of some popular concern at the time). This song is still heard on German radio stations, partly for nostalgic reasons. &quot;Der blaue Planet&quot; became not only Karat&#x27;s best-selling record, but the best-selling album of any East German recording artist ever, in or outside the country.

With its follow-up album &quot;Die sieben Wunder der Welt&quot; (&quot;The Seven Wonders of the World&quot;) in 1983, Karat drifted toward more emotionally stirring tunes like &quot;Mich zwingt keiner auf die Knie&quot; (&quot;No one Forces Me to my Knee&quot;). This period is considered by many to be the highest point of the band&#x27;s success, as it appealed to audiences in both East and West Germany, other countries of Eastern and Western Europe, and even in the Soviet Union. In 1984, Karat and its lyricist Norbert Kaiser were honored with the National Prize of the GDR for Arts and Literature. That year Karat also appeared on the popular West German television show &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot;, where it was the only music group ever to be invited from the GDR. In 1986, Karat received the &quot;Goldene Europa&quot;, West German television&#x27;s oldest award.

Bassist and founding member Henning Protzmann left the band, and was replaced by Christian Liebig for &quot;Fünfte Jahreszeit&quot; (&quot;Fifth Season&quot;), released in 1986. This record had a more commercially oriented sound, with songs like &quot;Hab&#x27; den Mond mit der Hand berührt&quot; (&quot;Touched the Moon with my Hand&quot;) and &quot;Glocke Zweitausend&quot; (&quot;The 2000 Bell&quot;). The latter track included Silly singer Tamara Danz, with whom Swillms, Römer and Dreilich had also briefly performed in the short-lived East German supergroup the Gitarreros.

A turning point came in 1987, when another founding member, principal composer and first keyboardist Ulrich &quot;Ed&quot; Swillms, left Karat, citing health concerns. A second keyboardist, Thomas Kurzhals, had already been recruited in 1984, and he remained in the band. (Swillms would return 18 years later as a loosely associated member). The group&#x27;s first album produced without Swillms, &quot;... im nächsten Frieden&quot; (&quot;... in The Next Peace&quot;), was released in 1990 shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and reflected a strong shift toward a radio-friendly pop rock structure. Although this album included a duet between lead singer Herbert Dreilich and Peter Maffay on a new version of &quot;Über sieben Brücken,&quot; it was almost completely ignored. Karat, along with other East German bands such as The Puhdys and City, seemed to be passé when their East German fans were suddenly able to buy western albums with ease. During 1990 many top western rock acts performed in East Germany for the first time, and free shows such as Roger Waters&#x27; &quot;The Wall&quot; extravaganza in Berlin, which did not include any East German performers, took their toll on the East German performers&#x27; audience base.

Karat released a second self-titled album in 1991, with the title intended to suggest a new beginning. Instead it sold poorly, and Karat would not record again for four years.

The doldrums in popularity for East German recording artists began to give way around 1993-1994. Karat&#x27;s albums, having been re-released as compact discs by DSB (the privatized successor to East German state-owned record label AMIGA), began to sell fairly well again. Karat celebrated its 20th anniversary with a sold-out concert at a horse racing track in the Karlshorst district of Berlin, with appearances by well-wishers including the bands City and The Puhdys, and singer Ute Freudenberg. Coinciding with this concert was the release of an album that returned to Karat&#x27;s more distinctive style of progressive rock, &quot;Die geschenkte Stunde&quot; (&quot;The Given Hour&quot;). This was the first album to include new keyboardist Martin Becker, and it sold fairly well to the band&#x27;s core fan base of eastern Germans. Thereafter Karat was widely considered one of the former GDR&#x27;s top remaining acts, yet it eschewed the &quot;Ostalgie&quot; movement and emphasized its new material in concerts. The 1997 album &quot;Balance&quot; received similar success, including its relative comeback hit &quot;Der Ozean&quot; (&quot;The Ocean&quot;).

An abrupt shock came in October 1997, when lead singer Herbert Dreilich suffered a stroke on stage in Magdeburg. He survived the event, but returned to performance only after a full year of recuperation and songwriting. Afterward, Karat&#x27;s pace slowed considerably. In 2000, the band released the compilation &quot;Ich liebe jede Stunde&quot; (&quot;I Love Every Hour&quot;), consisting of a few remakes, a few new songs, and some of its most popular older material remastered. The band&#x27;s 25th anniversary was celebrated in front of a crowd of 20,000 people in Berlin, with former first keyboardist Ulrich &quot;Ed&quot; Swillms making a guest re-appearance, and sharing the stage with the German Film Orchestra Babelsberg and Peter Maffay. A year later recordings from this concert were released as a live album and DVD, titled &quot;25 Jahre Karat - Das Konzert&quot; (&quot;25 Years of Karat - The Concert&quot;). The 2003 album &quot;Licht und Schatten&quot; (&quot;Light and Shadow&quot;) was to be Dreilich&#x27;s last personally completed effort (notably, it contained one of only two Karat songs ever recorded in English, &quot;Someone Got Hurt,&quot; a demo from 1983 that may have been a reference to Dean Reed). In 2004, a tour with The Puhdys and City was cancelled at the last minute when Dreilich was diagnosed with liver cancer. He died that December, at the age of 62. 

The band quietly celebrated its 30th anniversary with the release of a 2-CD set, &quot;30 Jahre Karat&quot; (&quot;30 Years of Karat&quot;). The first CD was a collection of further remasterings of several of its better-known songs, and included a guest performance by well-respected Austrian group The Schürzenjäger. The second CD contained songs Herbert Dreilich wrote and was working on in the last years of his life, performed by himself where recordings existed and by others where they did not, finished for release. It ended off with the heartbreaking &quot;Manchmal denk&#x27; ich&quot; (&quot;Sometimes I Think&quot;), sung by the band&#x27;s long-standing friend and contributor Thomas Natschinski.

At Herbert Dreilich&#x27;s suggestion, the band replaced him with his 35-year-old son Claudius Dreilich, who had previously been manager of an IKEA furniture store in Austria. The younger Dreilich bore an uncanny resemblance to his father, both in appearance and in vocal style. He was well received by the other members of the band, whom he had already known for many years, as well as its fans. Former first keyboardist Ulrich &quot;Ed&quot; Swillms also rejoined the group, although appearing only occasionally in live performance.

However, due to a legal dispute with the elder Dreilich&#x27;s widow, who claimed ownership of the name &quot;Karat&quot; because her husband had registered it as a trademark in 1998, the band stopped using it, and in January, 2006 adopted the name K...!. After a protracted legal process, in June 2007 the Berlin courts ruled that the name Karat should belong to the members of the band. The name K...! was retired, and the band returned to calling itself Karat.

During the summer and fall of 2007, Karat took part in a large multi-band tour, called &quot;Ost-Rock in Klassik&quot; (&quot;East-Rock in Classical&quot;), where famous East German rock acts played their biggest hits in a classical style together with the German Film Orchestra Babelsberg, conducted by Bernd Wefelmeyer. A series of smaller concerts followed.

In April, 2010 the band celebrated its 35th anniversary with two concerts in the &quot;Alte Oper Erfurt&quot;. A Special Jubilee Edition Box Set was released, containing all previously released albums newly remastered, and an extra CD of rarities. In the same year Karat also released a new album named &quot;Weitergeh&#x27;n&quot; (&quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot;), a book about the band and its history, and during that autumn and winter gave a special Anniversary Tour.

Since then the band Karat has continued to hold live performances and to record, occasionally releasing new singles.

Keyboardist and songwriter Ed Swillms died on 27 June 2023, at the age of 76.

<text>The Justice and Truth Alliance (originally in ; or D.A. for short, meaning &quot;yes&quot; in Romanian) was a political alliance comprising two political parties in Romania, namely the centre-right liberal National Liberal Party (PNL) and the initially left-wing Democratic Party (PD), which later switched to center-right ideology.

Although the National Union PSD+PUR had won the largest number of seats in the Parliament, the Justice and Truth Alliance formed the government from 2004 to 2007 in a coalition with the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR/RMDSZ) and the Conservative Party (PUR), which had changed sides after DA&#x27;s candidate won the presidential elections.

== Background ==

The alliance had its origins in a collaboration between the two parties which began in early 2002 at the initiative of the PNL&#x27;s former president, Valeriu Stoica. The creation of the alliance was formally approved on 29 September 2003 by the executives of both parties, after months of negotiations between the parties. It was established as a vehicle for of coordinating opposition efforts against the ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD). Its name was chosen in reference to the PSD&#x27;s alleged corruption - as PNL president Theodor Stolojan put it, &quot;we want the alliance to set us free from corruption and lies.&quot;

On 25 October 2004, the Justice and Truth alliance endorsed its co-chairman Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu (at that time also the leader of the PNL) as its leader in the 2004 Romanian general election. According to Popescu-Tăriceanu, the alliance&#x27;s political priorities were:

* Stimulating investments and private initiative;
* Creating of new jobs and increasing net incomes to alleviate poverty;
* Delivering a &quot;responsible social policy&quot; in the field of education, healthcare, pensions, and social assistance;
* Fighting corruption;
* Establishing a non-political judiciary.

In the 2004 presidential election and the simultaneous legislative election, held on 28 November, the DA polled better than expected in both races. It came within a few percentage points behind the PSD, eliminating the previous government&#x27;s majority as a result. A new post-electoral alliance was formed between the Justice and Truth (DA), the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR/RMDSZ), and the Conservative Party (PC), forming thus a simple majority (accounting for 54.5% of the seats) which then had the legitimacy to appoint ministers in a new grand coalition government. The protocols of the alliance between DA and UDMR were signed on 20 December 2004 while those between DA and PUR were signed on 23 December 2004.

DA&#x27;s presidential candidate, Traian Băsescu, won the presidential election and was subsequently the 4th President of Romania. DA, alongside the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR/RMDSZ) and the Humanist Party of Romania (which subsequently became the Conservative Party) both quit the ruling coalition 3 December 2006, consequently leaving the two remaining parties (i.e. PD and PNL) without a simple majority in the Parliament.

During early April 2007, Popescu-Tăriceanu dismissed the Democratic Party (PD) ministers from the government and formed a minority cabinet along with the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR/RMDSZ), thereby marking the end of the alliance.

<text>Taï National Park () is a national park in Ivory Coast that contains one of the last areas of primary rainforest in West Africa. It was inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1982 due to the diversity of its flora and fauna. Five mammal species of the Taï National Park are on the Red List of Threatened Species: pygmy hippopotamus, olive colobus monkeys, leopards, chimpanzees, and Jentink&#x27;s duiker.

Taï National Park is approximately from the Ivorian coast on the border with Liberia between the Cavalla and Sassandra rivers. It covers an area of with a buffer zone up to .

The Taï Forest reserve was created in 1926 and promoted to national park status in 1972. It was recognized as a UNESCO biosphere reserve in 1978 and added to the list of Natural World Heritage Sites in 1982.

The Taï Forest is a natural reservoir of the Ebola virus. The World Health Organization has expressed concern over the proximity of this reservoir to Félix-Houphouët-Boigny International Airport at Abidjan.

==Geography==
The park consists of of tropical evergreen forest located at the south-western corner of Ivory Coast, bordering Liberia. Altitudes vary from to (Mt. Niénokoué). The park is situated on a Precambrian granite peneplain of migmatites, biotites and gneiss which slopes down from the gently undulating drier north to more deeply dissected land in the south where the rainfall is heavy. This plateau at between is broken by several granite inselbergs formed from plutonic intrusions, including the Mont Niénokoué in the southwest. A large zone of varied schists runs north-east to south-west across the park, dissected by tributaries of the main watercourses which run parallel to it: the N&#x27;zo, Meno and Little Hana and Hana rivers, all draining southwest to the river Cavally. In the wet season these rivers are wide, but in the dry season become shallow streams. The northern border of the adjoining N&#x27;Zo Faunal Reserve is formed by the large reservoir behind the Buyo Dam on the N&#x27;zo and Sassandra rivers. There is some swamp forest in the northwest of the park and in N&#x27;zo. The soils are ferralitic, generally leached and of low fertility. In the southern valleys there are hydromorphic gley and more fertile alluvial soils (DPN, 1998). Gold and some other minerals exist in small quantities.

===Climate===
There are two distinct climatic zones of sub-equatorial type. Annual rainfall ranges from a mean of in the north to in the southwest, falling from March/April to July, with a shorter wet season in September to October. There is no dry season in the south but in the north it is marked from November to February/March, accentuated briefly by dry northeasterly Harmattan wind. These only began to affect the region about 1970 after half the country&#x27;s forests had been felled. There is only a small temperature fluctuation between due to oceanic influence and the presence of forests, but mean diurnal temperatures can range from . The relative humidity is high (85%). The prevailing winds are monsoonal from the south-west. In 1986, Ivory Coast suffered a 30% rainfall deficit, possibly due to loss of forest cover: 90% of the country has been deforested in the past fifty years resulting in greatly diminished evapotranspiration.

===Flora===
The park is one of the last remaining portions of the vast primary Upper Guinean rain forest that once stretched across present-day Togo, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia and Sierra Leone to Guinea-Bissau. It is the largest island of forest remaining in West Africa remaining relatively intact. Its mature tropical forest lies within a WWF/IUCN Centre of Plant Diversity and in the center of endemism of eastern Liberia and western Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, probably as the result of having been an Ice Age refugium, having over 50 species endemic to the region. The park contains some 1,300 species of higher plants of which 54% occur only in the Guinean zone. The vegetation is predominantly dense evergreen ombrophilous forest of Upper Guinean type of 40–60 m emergent trees with massive trunks and large buttresses or stilt roots.

Two main types of forest can be recognised grading from diverse moist evergreen forest with leguminous trees in the southern third to moist semi-evergreen forest in the north. Large numbers of epiphytes and lianes form an important element at the lower levels including &quot;Platycerium&quot;, &quot;Nephrolepis biserrata&quot;, &quot;Drymaria&quot; and &quot;Asplenium africanum&quot;. The Sassandrian moist evergreen forest on schistose soils in the south-west is dominated by species such as ebony (&quot;Diospyros gabunensis&quot;), &quot;Diospyros chevalieri&quot;, &quot;Mapania baldwinii&quot;, &quot;Mapania linderi&quot; and &quot;Heritiera utilis&quot; (syn. &quot;Tarrietia utilis&quot;), with numerous endemic species, especially in the lower Cavally Valley and the Meno and Hana depressions near Mont Niénokoué. The last stands of the large endemic tree &quot;Kantou guereensis&quot; are here. The poorer soils of the north and south-east support species such as palm &quot;Eremospatha macrocarpa&quot;, west African ebony &quot;Diospyros mannii&quot;, &quot;Diospyros kamerunensis&quot;, &quot;Parinari chrysophylla&quot;, &quot;Chrysophyllum perpulchrum&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Species such as &quot;Gilbertiodendron splendidum&quot;, &quot;Symphonia globulifera&quot; and &quot;Raphia&quot; occur in the swamp forests of river backwaters and oxbows. The inselbergs are vegetated, according to their substrate, with savanna-like grassland and deciduous trees such as &quot;Spathodea campanulata&quot;. Plants once thought to be extinct, such as &quot;Amorphophallus staudtii&quot;, have been discovered in the area. Since commercial timber exploitation officially ceased in 1972, the forest has recovered well, although large areas are dominated by planted species.

The forest plants still play a large role in the lives of people in the Taï region. The fruit of &quot;Thaumatococcus daniellii&quot; locally known as katamfe or katempfe, yoruba or soft cane is used in traditional medicine and contains a protein substance five thousand times sweeter than sugar cane. The bark of the &quot;Terminalia superba&quot;, or &quot;tree of malaria&quot;, is used by the ethnic Kroumen for the treatment of malaria. This means that the park is an attic of genetic potential not yet explored by natural science and medicine.

===Fauna===
The fauna is fairly typical of West African forests but very diverse, nearly 1,000 vertebrate species being found. The park contains 140 species of mammal and 47 of the 54 species of large mammal known to occur in the Guinean rain forest, including twelve regional endemics and five threatened species. The region&#x27;s isolation between two major rivers has added to its particular character.

====Mammals====

Mammals include 11 species of primates: western red colobus, Diana monkey, Campbell&#x27;s mona monkey, lesser and greater spot-nosed monkey, black-and-white colobus, ursine colobus, green colobus, sooty mangabey, the dwarf galago and Bosman&#x27;s potto. There were more than 2,000 West African chimpanzees (&quot;Pan troglodytes verus&quot;) in the 1980s. In 1995, Marchesi et al. estimated the total number of chimpanzees in Taï to be 4,507, with perhaps 292 in N&#x27;Zo and nearby reserves (however there is no doubt that such numbers have declined in the last 15 years). These chimpanzees are noted for using tools (DPN, 1998).

Also found in the park are two bats, Buettikofer&#x27;s epauletted fruit bat and Aellen&#x27;s roundleaf bat, Pel&#x27;s flying squirrel, giant pangolin, tree pangolin and long-tailed pangolin, Liberian mongoose, African golden cat, leopard, red river hog, giant forest hog, water chevrotain, bongo, and African forest buffalo. African forest elephants (&quot;Loxodonta cyclotis&quot;) have also been observed within the park, although in 2001 they numbered only about 100 individuals in the south of the park compared to some 1,800 in 1979. 

Taï National Park also hosts an exceptional diversity of forest duikers including Jentink&#x27;s duiker, banded or zebra duiker, Maxwell&#x27;s duiker, Ogilby&#x27;s duiker, black duiker, bay duiker, yellow-backed duiker and the royal antelope. Forest rodents include the rusty-bellied brush-furred rat, the Edward&#x27;s swamp rat and the woodland dormouse. Also recorded in the park is the &quot;Defua rat&quot;, which is characteristic of secondary forest.

The dwarf or pygmy hippopotamus (&quot;Hexaprotodon liberiensis&quot;) numbered at around 500 in the park in 1996, and it is one of the few viable populations remaining .

====Birds====

The park lies within one of the world&#x27;s Endemic Bird Areas. At least 250 bird species have been recorded, 28 being endemic to the Guinean zone. There are 143 species typical of primary forest, including African crowned eagle, lesser kestrel, white-breasted guineafowl, rufous fishing owl, brown-cheeked hornbill, yellow-casqued hornbill, western wattled cuckooshrike, rufous-winged thrush-babbler, green-tailed bristlebill, yellow-throated olive greenbul, black-capped rufous-warbler, Nimba flycatcher, Sierra Leone prinia, Lagden&#x27;s bushshrike, copper-tailed glossy-starling, white-necked rockfowl, and Gola malimbe. The park has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of many bird species.

===Reptiles and amphibians===
Two crocodiles, the slender-snouted crocodile and the dwarf crocodile, and several turtles, such as Home&#x27;s hinge-back tortoise, are amongst about 40 species of reptiles that live in the park. At least 56 species of amphibians are known from the park; these include a true toad &quot;Amietophrynus taiensis&quot; and a reed frog found only in 1997 (&quot;Hyperolius nienokouensis&quot;), both only known from Ivory Coast.

====Invertebrates====

Arthropods represent the largest share of biomass in tropical forests. Invertebrate species include a rare freshwater mollusc &quot;Neritina tiassalensis&quot; and many thousands of insect species including 57 dragonflies, 95 ants, 44 termites and 78 scarabeid beetles (DPN, 1998).

==Local human population==
The original tribes of the forest region were the Guéré and Oubi, for totemic reasons, did not eat chimpanzees and thus preserved the chimpanzee populations. French influence dated from only the mid-19th century. Evidently, there was little settlement in the area before the late 1960s, when reservoir construction in the N&#x27;Zo valley and, later, drought in the Sahel, pushed people southwards. A population in the area of about 3,200 in 1971 had grown to 57,000 twenty years later. The park is now neighbored by 72 villages, and hundreds of illegal squatters live in the park.

Of the three main groups of farmers, the rural Bakoué and Kroumen cleared forest selectively, sparing medicinal trees; by contrast the Baoulé, in addition to the incomers who include refugees displaced by the dam on the N&#x27;Zo river, from the Sahel and from the conflicts in both Liberia and Ivory Coast who now form 90% of the population, have indiscriminately fragmented and destroyed much of the forest in the buffer zone. In its place, cash and food crops are planted in shifting cultivation in order to lessen the mortality from malaria. The east side of the park has suffered most from this. These people neither support the park, nor are informed about it by the authorities (DPN, 2002).

==Scientific research and facilities==
The park was the site of a UNESCO Man &amp; Biosphere project on the effects of human interference within the natural forest ecosystem. This was a vast research project carried out under the auspices of the Institute for Tropical Ecology and the Centre for Ecological Research at the University of Abobo-Adjamé in the nearby town of Taï. International scientific cooperation was exemplified by the Ivoirian, French, Italian, German and Swiss teams which worked together on various research programs. This level of research continues. The site and research projects have great potential for training and scientific study. The French Office de la recherche scientifique et technique outre-mer (ORSTOM) has worked here for a number of years. In 1984, a Dutch team surveyed the area, using an ultra-light aircraft for low altitude photography to identify dying trees for use as timber. There has been Ivorian research into forest termites, included under the IUCN/WWF Plants Campaign 1984-1985; and by the government Institute of Forestry into plantation crops. Between 1989 and 1991 BirdLife International conducted the Taï Avifaunal Survey, summarised in Gartshore et al. (1995). The Dutch Tropenbos Foundation published a detailed fully referenced study of the park in 1994. From 1979 to 1985, Swiss researchers studied chimpanzees, continuing until 1994 into the transference of an ebola virus to humans and antibodies for it to be found in other animals.

There is an ecological station (L&#x27;Institut d&#x27;Ecologie Tropicale) in the Audrenisrou basin in the core zone and a German team base at Fedfo camp in the buffer zone. There is also a Biosphere Reserve station 18 km south-east of Taï village, which consists of several prefabricated houses, a communal kitchen, two well-equipped laboratories, and an electric generator. It is controlled and financed nationally and managed by 2-3 Ivoirian personnel.

Between 1993 and 2002, the Project Autonome pour la Conservation du Parc National de Taï (PACPNT), financed by GTZ, KfW and the WWF, with the Parks Department (Direction des Parcs Nationaux et Réserves (DPN)), worked to improve management and surveillance, monitored and inventoried the condition of the flora and fauna, launched pilot conservation projects with local people, and made comparative studies of seven species of monkeys. Phase I reported in 1997 and Phase II in 2002. This project has produced over 50 papers covering subjects such as tool-using and the ebola virus in chimpanzees and the fauna as a potential source of foods and medicines. In 2002, technical and scientific management of the park was assigned to the national Office Ivoirien des Parcs et Reserves which covers management policy, wardening, research, education and communication for all parks. A Scientific Council of the involved NGOs international and local, was set up. A second research station and a canopied walkway on the east side of the park have been. However, a national workshop on the forest zone held in 2002 to 2003 focused on the lack of scientific research, monitoring, evaluation, coordination with foreign institutions and access to research done; also the persistence of low levels of popular participation and sustainable development of protected forest lands. A better inventory of the forest&#x27;s resources is still needed.

<text>Walter Leigh Rayfield (7 October 1880 – 19 February 1949) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Rayfield was one of the seven Canadians to be awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions on one single day, 2 September 1918, for actions across the long Drocourt-Quéant Line near Arras, France. The other six were Bellenden Hutcheson, Arthur George Knight, William Henry Metcalf, Claude Joseph Patrick Nunney, Cyrus Wesley Peck and John Francis Young.

==Details==
Rayfield was 37 years old, and a private in the 7th (1st British Columbia) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

These events took place from 2–4 September 1918 during the operations east of Arras, France:Ahead of his company, he rushed a trench occupied by a large party of the enemy, personally bayoneting two and taking ten prisoners. Later, he located and engaged with great skill, under constant rifle fire, an enemy sniper who was causing many casualties. He then rushed the section of trench from which the sniper had been operating, and so demoralised the enemy by his coolness and daring that thirty others surrendered to him. Again, regardless of his personal safety, he left cover under heavy machine-gun fire and carried in a badly wounded comrade. He was awarded the Silver Medal of the Belgian Order of the Crown on 22 December 1919.
Rayfield was the Progressive Party of Canada &quot;Soldier candidate&quot; in the federal election of 1921 for Toronto East. Liberal nominee Mrs. Philip G. Kiely (Elizabeth Bethune Kiely) stood aside for Rayfield, so that her votes could go to him, but the Conservative candidate won. He was Sergeant-at-Arms of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and governor of Toronto Jail.

He died in 1949, and is buried at Prospect Cemetery, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (Soldier&#x27;s Plot, Section 7, grave 4196).

==The Medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

<doc id="1222973" wikidata="Q438418" url="?curid=1222973" title="Petre P. Carp">
<text>Petre P. Carp (; also Petrache Carp, Francized &quot;Pierre Carp&quot;, occasionally &quot;Comte Carpe&quot;; 28 or 29 June 1837  – 19 June 1919) was a Moldavian, later Romanian statesman, political scientist and culture critic, one of the major representatives of Romanian liberal conservatism, and twice the country&#x27;s Prime Minister (1900–1901, 1910–1912). His youth was intertwined with the activity of &quot;Junimea&quot; club, which he co-founded with critic Titu Maiorescu as a literary society, and then helped transform it into a political club. He left behind a budding career as &quot;Junimea&quot;″s polemicist and cultural journalist, joining the state bureaucracy of the United Principalities, the Romanian diplomatic corps, and ultimately electoral politics. A speaker for aristocratic sentiment and the Romanian gentry, Carp helped create the Conservative Party from the various &quot;White&quot; conservative clubs (1880), but also led a &quot;Junimist&quot; dissident wing against the Conservative mainstream leaders Lascăr Catargiu and Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino. He was a contributor to the &quot;Junimea&quot; platform &quot;Convorbiri Literare&quot;, and founder of the newspapers &quot;Térra&quot; (1868) and &quot;Moldova&quot; (1915).

Widely seen as unyielding and trenchant in his public stance, and respected as an orator, P. P. Carp stood against the majority current in various political debates. His entire discourse was an alternative to the protectionist, antisemitic and populist tendencies of &quot;Red&quot; Romanian liberalism. Welcoming Westernization and free trade, his vision of development nonetheless rested on gradualism and criticized modern experiments in governance. The two Carp administrations are remembered for their fiscal reforms, their encouragement of foreign investments, and their attempted clampdown on political corruption.

A Germanophile and a Russophobe, Carp gathered consensus for steering the Kingdom of Romania into the Triple Alliance, but his external policy became entirely unpopular by the start of World War I. During that time, he was the only prominent public figure to demand a declaration of war against the Entente Powers. He came out of retirement during the German occupation of Romania, when he inspired fellow Conservative Lupu Kostaki to set up a collaborationist territorial government. This final project caused his fall into disgrace once the legitimate government regained control.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Carp was a scion of the old boyar class in Moldavia: his family has attested roots going back to the 17th century, and believed by some to have originated in the Baltic region. The Carps were related to other noble houses, including the Cozadinis, the Racovițăs and the Kostakis. They owned the manorial estate of Țibănești, formed over the centuries by the accumulation of yeomen farmland and still a lucrative business in their lifetime. Carp&#x27;s father, also known as Petre (Petru), was a &quot;Spatharios&quot; of the Princely Court, then &quot;Stolnic&quot;. Educated abroad during the earliest wave of Westernization, fascinated by Enlightenment ideals and the &quot;Carboneria&quot;, he took part in political agitation before the Moldavian Revolution of 1848. His wife, Petre P. Carp&#x27;s mother, was Smaranda Radul, from the boyar branch of Dealu Mare. The couple had another son, who died at birth.

The future Conservative leader was born in the Moldavian capital of Iași. When he was still a young child, his father took him on his first trip out of Moldavia: they traveled by stagecoach through the Austrian Empire, and then to Prussia. In Berlin, Petre Jr enlisted at the bilingual Französisches Gymnasium, and lived in the house of its Huguenot headmaster, L&#x27;Hardy. Young Carp received a classical education in literature, and was noted as a connoisseur of works by Homer, J. W. Goethe, and especially William Shakespeare. He took his &quot;Matura&quot; with the highest grade of his class, and then studied Law and Politics at the University of Bonn. Carp affiliated with a notorious student fraternity, the &quot;Corps Borussia&quot;. According to literary historian Tudor Vianu, this aristocratic influence Germanized his views and his public persona, from &quot;the slightly aggressive ego&quot; and the passion for dueling to the wearing of a monocle. It was in Bonn that Carp made his debut as an orator. On behalf of the student fraternities, Carp welcomed Jérôme, cousin of French Emperor Napoleon III, and was remarked by the visitor for his &quot;clear&quot; and intellectually honest political stance. Carp&#x27;s future colleague, Moldavian Iacob Negruzzi, also briefly met him as a student, and first noticed in him the potential statesman.

===&quot;Junimea&quot; creation===

Carp was in Prussia when Moldavia merged with Wallachia to create the United Principalities (the first step to a unified Romania). He returned to Iași in autumn 1862, having just turned 25, and soon after dedicated himself to reanimating the city&#x27;s intellectual scene. Carp embarked on a long friendship with the like-minded Titu Maiorescu. They shared an appreciation of Prussia and a German education, but joined hands with the Francophile Vasile Pogor; the three of them set up &quot;Junimea&quot;, originally a literary club with only some political ambitions. Lawyer Theodor Rosetti, considered the fourth founder, joined in 1863, followed in 1864 by Negruzzi. Although the society was always dominated by Francophiles, Carp and Maiorescu together exercised such authority that the Germanophile platform was never challenged from within.

From its inception, the &quot;Junimea&quot; group supported dialogue over class divides. Theodor Rosetti&#x27;s family, the Rosettis, were a famous political clan, and he was himself the brother-in-law of united Romania&#x27;s first ruler, &quot;Domnitor&quot; Alexander John Cuza (wedded to Elena Rosetti). As philosopher Virgil Nemoianu notes, Rosetti and Carp were the highest-ranked boyars among the &quot;Junimist&quot; founders. Maiorescu was the only core member not to come from a wealthy family, and privately resented his aristocratic colleagues, Carp included, for their condescending behavior. However, Carp also used his nobleman&#x27;s upbringing to Maiorescu&#x27;s advantage, when he promised to duel all those who would mention Maiorescu&#x27;s alleged sexual misconduct.

P. P. Carp&#x27;s initial contribution to &quot;Junimist&quot; activities was as a man of letters. In a public reading at Maiorescu&#x27;s home, the first such event in &quot;Junimea&quot; history, he introduced his own translation from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, probably done from the English. He kept a vivid interest in such work over the next years, translating &quot;Othello&quot; (printed under &quot;Junimea&quot; patronage in 1868), articles from the British cultural press, and the scientific travelogues of Alexander von Humboldt. He also lectured freely on literary or historical subjects, including &quot;Ancient and Modern Tragedy&quot; or &quot;Three Caesars&quot;.

The literary reunions attracted interest and became noisy banquets, the atmosphere of which is documented by Negruzzi&#x27;s memoirs. He notes that Carp hardly ever consumed alcohol in public, but that, when he did, he was a sentimental drunk. The &quot;Junimea&quot; debates were lively and sprinkled with biting &quot;ad hominem&quot;. Young Carp casually addressed the audience with the insult &quot;gogomani&quot; (&quot;dopes&quot;), and it became a badge of pride for the oldest &quot;Junimists&quot; to have been identified as such. The inside joke was replicated among the more minor &quot;Junimists&quot;. They casually misspelled Carp&#x27;s surname as &quot;Chirp&quot; (pretending to follow the obscure lexical theories of folklorist Ioan D. Caragiani); also, during one &quot;Junimea&quot; party, novelist Nicolae Gane staged a puppet show in which Carp and Maiorescu were the main characters.

===1866 conspiracy and mission to France===
By 1865, Carp had all but abandoned the cultivation of literature, throwing his hat into politics: following Th. Rosetti&#x27;s intercession, he became an auditor for Cuza&#x27;s Council of State, leaving for Bucharest. The interval corresponded with the emergence of major political currents, formed around the two halves of a pro-Cuza &quot;National Party&quot;: the &quot;Red&quot; camp, as an early manifestation of Romanian liberalism; the &quot;Whites&quot;, as mainly proponents of traditional conservatism. More attracted to the &quot;White&quot; half of the spectrum, Carp became especially active in the national journals (&quot;Cugetarea&quot;, &quot;Revista Dunării&quot;), mainly as a critic of Romania&#x27;s &quot;Red&quot; liberalism and of some emergent left-wing tendencies.

This was the time of Carp&#x27;s first-ever polemic with the historian and &quot;Red&quot; ideologue Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu. Carp&#x27;s 1865 piece, published in the local paper &quot;Cugetarea&quot; under the pen name &quot;P. Bătăușul&quot; (&quot;P. the Bully&quot;), attacked Hasdeu&#x27;s biography of the medieval despot Ion Vodă cel Cumplit, and specifically its advocacy of absolute monarchy and populism. A year later, Carp was lending his pen to the &quot;Junimist&quot; satire of Hasdeu&#x27;s historical method. In 1867, he also gave an exceptionally harsh review to Hasdeu&#x27;s historical play, &quot;Răzvan și Vidra&quot;, and attacked his historical research in the &quot;White&quot; review &quot;Gazeta de Iassi&quot;.

As a defender of the parliamentary system, Carp disliked the authoritarian regime slowly introduced by the &quot;Domnitor&quot;. He and Pogor were the two anti-Cuzists of &quot;Junimea&quot;, whereas the other contributors remained neutral on the issue. In February 1866, Carp joined the political conspiracy which forced Alexander John Cuza into exile. Romania&#x27;s Regents (the Princely Lieutenancy) appointed him their Intimate Secretary. He was also kept on as auditor &quot;pro bono&quot;. Carp soon rallied with the supporters of rule by a foreign dynasty, and, in &quot;Desbaterile&quot; gazette, advocated the dissolution of Parliament in preparation for the April plebiscite. When the list of candidates was narrowed down to Carol (Karl) of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, Premier Ion Ghica sent Carp on his first diplomatic assignment, a secret mission to Napoleon III—Carp was to inquire about possible French objections to the enthronement of this Prussian prince, and recorded the Emperor&#x27;s mild approval. Ghica and Carp, who were trying to contain a wave of separatist and anti-Prussian movements at home, registered a moral victory (made possible by the assistance of socialite Hortense Cornu, a personal friend of Napoleon&#x27;s).

On May 11, 1866, that is a day after Carol was made &quot;Domnitor&quot;, Carp became Secretary of Romania&#x27;s Legation to the French Empire, serving under Ion Bălăceanu, and replacing Bălăceanu from May 1867. He gave much importance to personal diplomacy, and regularly attended social functions at the Court of Compiègne. In the end he resigned over a disagreement with Ștefan Golescu, Romania&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs, concerning the conspiratorial activities of refugees from Ottoman Bulgaria. Specifically, Golescu had ordered him to lie about Romanian support for the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee.

===&quot;White&quot; spokesman and Epureanu&#x27;s minister===

Carp returned to Moldavia in autumn, and ran in elections for the Assembly of Deputies constituency of Vaslui (1st College). He carried the vote, and, joining the conservative (&quot;White&quot;) section of Parliament, and proceeded to reorganize the conservative movement. Carp found the new regime, as inaugurated by the Constitution of 1866, to be a good foundation stone: preserving the Constitution became a main priority of the &quot;Whites&quot;. This period also marked Carp&#x27;s first contacts with the conservative wing of Freemasonry, and, in 1868, he was initiated into the &quot;Star of Romania&quot; Masonic Lodge.

After accepting the Constitution, Carp stood against the political majority in what concerned the Romanian nationality law. This explicitly proscribed non-Christians, primarily Romanian Jews, from ever becoming full citizens. On May 29, 1867, Carp joined some conservatives and centrist liberals who petitioned Carol, asking him to stop the &quot;Reds&quot; from expelling Moldavian Jews. Carp was equally alarmed about the Russian Empire&#x27;s policy toward Romania, which he regarded as callous and menacing, and believed that members of some other ethnic communities needed to be kept under watch. He therefore officially demanded a probe into the pro-Russian politics of Bulgarian committees.

In November 1867, Carp joined Nicolae Moret Blaremberg and Aristide Pascal as co-editor of the daily &quot;Térra&quot; (an antiquated spelling of &quot;Țara&quot;, &quot;The Country&quot;). It was introduced as a &quot;D̦iar politic, literar și comercial&quot; (&quot;Political, Literary and Commercial Paper&quot;), and published a French-language supplement, &quot;Le Pays Roumain&quot;. &quot;Térra&quot; reacted against the &quot;demagogy&quot; of &quot;Red&quot; politics, in particular the opinions expressed by C. A. Rosetti&#x27;s &quot;Românul&quot; paper, and advocated Jewish emancipation within a moderate conservative framework. Its content made it a tribune for a distinct group of conservatives: the so-called &quot;Juna Dreaptă&quot; (&quot;Young Right&quot;) society, headed by Manolache Costache Epureanu, and later associated in the public mind with Carp himself. Its vision was reflected in Carp&#x27;s parliamentary speeches. In April 1868, he condemned the pogrom of Bacău, and described emancipation as an issue of human rights.

&quot;Térra&quot; closed down in May 1868, and reemerged for a second and last edition between January and July 1870. At that stage, it had allied itself with the monarchist wing of &quot;Red&quot; liberalism, in power with Prime Minister Alexandru G. Golescu. The newspaper gave favorable coverage to the adoption of a national currency, the Romanian leu. This step signaled Romania&#x27;s unilateral emancipation from the Ottoman Empire, her nominal overlord, but was received with alarm by leftists such as Hasdeu—while &quot;Térra&quot; called it &quot;grand&quot; news, Hasdeu&#x27;s pamphlet regarded the leu as the newest symbol of Carlist usurpation. Meanwhile, the Western world was becoming outraged about discrimination and antisemitism in Romania. The nationality law was strongly supported by the liberal left, and, trying to appease the foreign governments, &quot;Domnitor&quot; Carol ceased all collaboration with the &quot;Reds&quot;.

In April 1870, the 33-year-old &quot;Junimist&quot; joined the Epureanu conservative cabinet (or &quot;Hen and Fledgling Government&quot;), as Minister of Foreign Affairs. From May 23, 1870, Carp also replaced his colleague Pogor as Minister of Education and Religious Affairs. As such, he reinstated Maiorescu to his teaching position at the University of Iași, helping him recover from a damaging confrontation with the liberal teaching staff. Carp still made occasional contributions to the &quot;Junimist&quot; literary press and, the same year, published a review of Gheorghe Sion&#x27;s collection of fables in Maiorescu&#x27;s &quot;Convorbiri Literare&quot;, but the various assignments absorbed &quot;Junimea&quot; men into state affairs. Iacob Negruzzi, who initially complained (&quot;That&#x27;s how politics more or less tears apart our literary club. A shame in God&#x27;s eyes!&quot;), was soon co-opted into political life, leaving for Bucharest in mid-1870.

The major challenge of Carp&#x27;s term as Foreign Minister was the Franco-Prussian War. It placed Romania in a delicate situation, while exacerbating the internal tensions between &quot;Red&quot; Francophiles and &quot;White&quot; Germanophiles. Carp&#x27;s ministry also faced a regional crisis when the Imperial Russian Army was mobilized on the Prut River and the Russian government pressured Romania to accept military tutelage; he resisted the Russian demands, even against the liberals&#x27; appeal to Eastern Orthodox brotherhood, and expressed more support for France than for Russia.

===Catargiu&#x27;s &quot;Great government&quot;===
Eventually, Epureanu saw himself confronted with the &quot;Republic of Ploiești&quot; conspiracy. This was the start of a major republican unrest, sparked by those &quot;Reds&quot; who wanted to stop the penetration of foreign capital. The republican movement was spurred on by the &quot;Strousberg Affair&quot;, when the scale of (supposedly privileged) Prussian involvement in the Romanian Railways was revealed to a Francophile public. The incidents were covered by &quot;Térra&quot;, but Carp and his colleagues insisted that, far from being a disgrace for the &quot;Whites&quot;, the scandalous bailout had been agreed between &quot;Red&quot; minister Mihail Kogălniceanu and Prussian investor B. H. Strousberg. Carp resented the republicans, and noted that the riots were an opportunity for Carol to arrest the entire &quot;Red&quot; leadership. Epureanu&#x27;s government fell in December 1870, but the &quot;Whites&quot; returned to power in March 1871, with Lascăr Catargiu at the helm. This period, known to the conservatives as the &quot;Great government&quot;, managed to bring together all &quot;White&quot; factions. The quinquennial political crisis, that had almost prompted Carol to present his resignation, ended with that, and Romania experienced social development.

Carp was appointed Head of Mission to the newly proclaimed German Empire, where he served until April 1873 and negotiated further German credits for the Railways. It was in part a mission of appeasement: Carp persuaded German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck not to switch to the &quot;enemies of Romania&quot; side, playing down the riots as a short-lived liberal nuisance (the &quot;Strousberg Affair&quot; was only solved in 1880, when the Romanian state purchased the German stock). Following this venture, Carp was also dispatched to the Kingdom of Italy, as Romanian diplomatic agent.

In November 1873, Carp ended his assignment and returned to the Romanian political scene. He soon after married to a fellow aristocrat, Sevastia Cantacuzino. Hailing from Cantacuzino boyars, she was the daughter of Ion C. Cantacuzino (who was Carp&#x27;s political ally). Her mother was Maria Mavros, a direct descendant of the Soutzos clan. Sevastia would have five children from Carp: daughter Elisabeta (Elsa), sons Jean (Ion), Grigore, Petre and Nicu. Meanwhile, the &quot;Junimist&quot; club, answering a proposal made by Gheorghe Costa-Foru, had agreed to caucus with Catargiu&#x27;s conservatives. The Catargiu cabinet had Maiorescu as Minister of Education and Religious Affairs, but the latter resigned due to a political scandal. Carp was called in to replace his &quot;Junimea&quot; colleague, and filled the post for the remaining two months of conservative power.

In 1874, P. P. Carp was formally recognized as the political head of &quot;Junimea&quot;, drafting the group&#x27;s gradualist and constitutional-monarchist program. He also stood by the Catargiu government after it had signed the controversial trade convention with Austria-Hungary: according to Carp, the agreement implicitly recognized Romania&#x27;s right to trade, and effectively ended her subordination to the Ottoman Empire. The &quot;Red&quot; liberals and former &quot;Whites&quot; such as Epureanu set up the National Liberal Party (PNL), which managed to topple the conservative cabinet. Upon losing his ministerial office, Carp commented that the alternation in power and the two-party system were necessary improvements: &quot;it is good for a party not to hold on to power for too long, and I believe that, in fact, from time to time, it is good for one party to step down and leave room for the other.&quot; When the PNL organized a retaliatory investigation of &quot;White&quot; management, Carp was one of only three former ministers against whom no accusation could be formulated.

===Romanian independence and Northern Dobruja debate===

After partial elections for Vaslui&#x27;s 2nd College (April 1877), Carp took a Senate seat. He watched with concern as the PNL drew Romania closer to Russia, and as Russia prepared to confront the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans refused to guarantee Romanian neutrality in the case of war, and Foreign Minister Mihail Kogălniceanu began meeting with the Russian envoys; Carp regretted Ottoman indifference, stating: &quot;abandoned by all, we have been pushed into the arms of Russia&quot;. He also asked, rhetorically, &quot;what is our guarantee against Russia?&quot; Just before the Russo-Turkish War of 1877, he criticized Premier Ion Brătianu for allowing safe passage to Russian troops. His argument was that the intrusion of &quot;30,000 foreign bayonets&quot; posed a great threat for Romania&#x27;s future. Still a skeptic, Carp welcomed his country&#x27;s independence war on the Ottomans, but continued to warn his peers about any unwanted effects of the Russian alliance.

During the Peace Congress of Berlin, Carp was especially alarmed by the territorial exchanges: Romania lost the Budjak region to Russia and, in addition to international recognition, received Northern Dobruja (formerly in the Ottoman Danube Vilayet). &quot;Domnitor&quot; Carol and the Brătianu government reluctantly approved this deal, but a parliamentary faction, comprising Carp and PNL&#x27;s Dimitrie Sturdza, explicitly condemned it. Their resolution stipulated that annexing Northern Dobruja was against the national interest; the opposition saw Northern Dobruja as a marshy, toxic, territory, and worried that it was largely inhabited by Muslims or disgruntled Bulgarians. Carp personally worried that the region was indefensible in front of Bulgarian irredentism. Eventually, on September 28, 1878, after a lengthy debate in Parliament and a convincing speech by Foreign Minister Kogălniceanu, the vote swung and the territorial exchange was given official endorsement. The government insisted that the incorporation was not a pittance or spoils of war, but the recovery of ancient Wallachian territory.

Carp watched in disbelief as the PNL&#x27;s hold on power, by far the longest of its era, sent the &quot;Whites&quot; into a crisis. As a loyalist, he reacted strongly against Catargiu and other conservative leaders when their &quot;Timpul&quot; newspaper began attacking Carol over his partnership with the National Liberals, and demanded ideological purity. He was returned to the Assembly in the May 1879 race, again elected in Vaslui&#x27;s 1st College.

As the territorial acquisitions and criticism from some Western observers were returning to the public agenda the issue of naturalization for non-Christians, Carp again spoke out in support of the Romanian Jews. The citizenship rights had by then been extended, under Western pressure, to accommodate Northern Dobrujan Muslims, but the Jews were still excluded in practice. A year before, Carp had published in &quot;Convorbiri Literare&quot; a review of the epic poem &quot;Radu&quot;, written by the Jewish intellectual Ronetti Roman.

===&quot;Era Nouă&quot; politics and Kingdom creation===
From 1880, Carp was primarily based in Bucharest, owning a townhouse in Dorobanți area. The year brought a victory for the &quot;Junimists&quot;: as a challenge to the PNL&#x27;s grip on power, they consolidated the &quot;White&quot; movement from within, and set up the Conservative Party. Carp, its main doctrinaire, outlined its governing principles and its pledges in the celebrated speech &quot;Era Nouă&quot; (&quot;The New Era&quot;). It was a defense of landed property in front of PNL promises of land reform, of self-governance and the strict separation of powers in front of centralism, and of corporatism in front of industrialization. Keeping up with his mistrust of Russia, Carp was also the first to suggest building fortifications between Focșani and Nămoloasa.

Although he personally drafted such policy proposals, Carp refused to actually join the Conservative Party, and for long remained its non-partisan ally. Like other &quot;Junimea&quot; men, he denounced Catargiu as a figure from the past, and noted that the party&#x27;s other program was exceptionally vague and &quot;anodyne&quot;. In contrast to the PNL&#x27;s reinvention into an articulate and unitary structure, the Conservative Party was still a loose association of clubs, called &quot;cadre party&quot; by political scientist Silvia Bocancea. Carp alternated his belonging to such societies with a membership in non-explicitly political venues, such as the Bucharest Jockey Club and Carol&#x27;s own Regal Club.

In 1881, the &quot;Junimists&quot; and the National Liberals agreed on the next stage of nation-building, proclaiming the Kingdom of Romania, with Carol I as King. The Carp program was not popular with the mainstream, or &quot;Old&quot;, Conservatives, and, in 1882, the Party split. In particular, Carp and the &quot;Junimists&quot; were outraged that, prioritizing differences of opinion, Catargiu and his followers had refused to contribute their share in creating the 1881 Kingdom. Another point of contention was Catargiu&#x27;s refusal to endorse one of Carp&#x27;s cherished projects: Romania&#x27;s adherence to the Triple Alliance, alongside the German Empire, Austria-Hungary and Italy. This perspective on foreign politics reunited Carp with King Carol and Ion Brătianu, who secretly convened that, after the taking of the Budjak, Romania needed to find herself in an anti-Russian defensive alliance.

===Joining the Triple Alliance===
Before the end of 1882, &quot;Junimea&quot; constituted itself into an independent group and was courted by the other political poles. In that context, Carp became Ambassador to the Austrian Court, appointed by the Brătianu cabinet. He mistrusted the Premier&#x27;s sincerity, but argued: &quot;he cannot back out, everything is directed against Russia and for sure things are going to stay put for two or three years.&quot; His diplomatic skill was invoked in settling a major litigious issue, that of free navigation on the Danube. Brătianu hoped that Carp could persuade the German side in the Danube Commission to vote against the Austrians, allowing Romania to fully control its territorial waters. Carp accomplished his task with unexpected ease.

His main contribution was Romania&#x27;s alignment with the Triple Alliance, negotiated by him in meetings with Bismarck. He was immersed in this project, as noted by historian Rudolf Dinu: &quot;[his] activity in certain moments exceeded by far the level of a mere negotiator&quot;. Brătianu personally thanked his envoy soon after the deal was sealed: &quot;only now can we say that [Romania] has her future ensured.&quot; Celebrated by those who opposed Russia, the treaty was for long kept a secret. Besides the Premier, Carp, and Maiorescu, only eight other politicians and none of the succeeding Ambassadors to Austria were informed of Brătianu&#x27;s action, down to 1914. Although the Triple Alliance regrouped Romania and Austria-Hungary, Carp opposed the Austrians for discriminating against Romania on the issue of navigation, and resented their attempts to direct Germany&#x27;s foreign policies.

The détente left open another issue on the nation&#x27;s agenda: the Austro-Hungarian regions of Transylvania, where a Romanian majority was threatened with Magyarization, and Bukovina, with a Romanian plurality. The negotiation effort and even normal diplomatic contacts were jeopardized when the PNL&#x27;s Petre Grădișteanu attended a large irredentist rally in Iași. When the PNL rank and file threatened with a republican revolt, Carp issued a scornful reply. The Transylvanian problem also expanded the gap between the various Conservatives. The favorite &quot;Junimist&quot; poet Mihai Eminescu, at the time the main staff writer at &quot;Timpul&quot;, was noted for his anti-Austrian or anti-Hungarian invectives, and becoming an embarrassment to his patrons. Reportedly, Carp disliked &quot;Timpul&quot;″s tone, telling Maiorescu to &quot;make sure and calm down that Eminescu&quot;. Eminescu&#x27;s quick sinking into a mental disorder put an end to such concerns, but the apparent string of coincidences continues to fuel a conspiracy theory, according to which Carp and Maiorescu have framed and silenced Eminescu.

===&quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Conservatives&quot; and &quot;United Opposition&quot;===
The &quot;Junimist&quot; group, also calling itself the &quot;New Conservatives&quot; or &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Conservatives&quot;, adopted an extended version of the &quot;Era Nouă&quot; program as its very own (1884). They were again in disagreement with the PNL, once Brătianu pushed through legislation that expanded the electoral basis and renounced the old census suffrage. At the time, the whole &quot;Junimist&quot; party found itself exposed to criticism from all sides, which Carp countered with his trademark sarcastic speeches. The dialogue between the two sides did not stop, and, in the 1884 election, young &quot;Junimist&quot; Alexandru Marghiloman was elected to the legislature with support from both P. P. Carp and Ion Brătianu.

The &quot;New Conservatives&quot; eventually caucused with the Conservative Party, and effectively formed a single group in Parliament (more evidently so when Carp was out of the country). Carp and the others were however revolted when Catargiu joined George D. Vernescu, the PNL dissident, in creating the Conservative-Liberal Party, its existence enshrined in popular memory as &quot;Struțo-cămila&quot; (&quot;The Ostrich-Camel&quot;). At around that time, Carp was witness to a duel of pistols between Maiorescu and the PNL politico Eugeniu Stătescu, which ended without bloodshed.

During the troubled 1887–1888 period, when Catargiu and other opposition Conservatives left Parliament to push for the fall of Brătianu&#x27;s cabinet, Carp&#x27;s group stayed behind, and pursued dialogue with those in power. For a while, &quot;Junimea&quot; was the parliamentary opposition, while the &quot;United Opposition&quot; of Catargiu took its battle to the streets. The general public began to suspect that the PNL leader was backing the unpopular alliance with Germany, and Bismarck himself expressed concern that a neutralist policy would overturn Carp&#x27;s program.

The United Opposition staged a riot against the PNL in March 1888. Carp was shocked by the violent backlash, and, although he did not sign up to a common platform, joined the peaceful March of Mourning into the Assembly Palace. Carp thus witnessed the unresolved shooting incident, during which an Assembly usher was shot dead. It has been reported that Carp verbally assaulted PNL minister Dimitrie Sturdza, grabbing him by the collar and pointing to the dead body: &quot;You rascal, these are your deeds!&quot; When government briefly arrested two United Opposition agitators, the PNL man Nicolae Fleva and the junior Conservative Nicolae Filipescu, Carp denounced a cover-up attempt: &quot;If impertinence were enough to hide a murder, the government would be clean as snow; if numbers were enough to guarantee impunity, you&#x27;d go unpunished.&quot;

Eventually, King Carol appointed Th. Rosetti to lead a &quot;Junimist&quot; cabinet. The sovereign&#x27;s own notes explain that he deeply mistrusted the United Opposition, and only called on &quot;people devoted to me, who have always acted in the appropriate manner: Rosetti [...], Carp and Maiorescu&quot; (alongside his own Adjutant Constantin Barozzi, appointed War Minister). The news generated even more trouble, as the outgoing PNL administration had made vague promises of a land reform in the Bărăgan Plain. Locals were disheartened that a landowning party had been granted power, and rebelled. Carol felt threatened by the events, urging the troops to show &quot;no mercy&quot; when quashing the revolt, and blaming them on a Russian-style &quot;Narodovolist&quot; conspiracy. In this context, Carp proceeded to negotiate with the United Opposition, offering to make Fleva head of Internal Affairs, in preparation for the November 1888 election. The plan failed, as Fleva asked for a totally free scrutiny, to which Carp allegedly replied: &quot;No free elections! But we&#x27;ll get real elections!&quot;

===Rosetti cabinet and &quot;Conservative concentration&quot;===
Although Carp still had the political initiative, he was not considered for the premiership. Instead, he was Minister of Foreign Affairs and (until November 11, 1888) &quot;ad interim&quot; Minister of Agriculture, Industry and Royal Domains. His term is remembered for the creation of the original national wire service, the Romanian Telegraph Agency, and for toning down tensions with Germany. The Conservatives and &quot;Junimists&quot; were again sharing power, the latter having convinced the former to stand by the &quot;Era Nouă&quot; promises. However, the &quot;Old Conservatives&quot; preserved a grudge, and maneuvered against their &quot;Junimist&quot; partners, provoking Rosetti&#x27;s fall from power.

From 1889, the &quot;Junimists&quot; and their sympathizers established a &quot;Constitutional Club&quot; in Parliament; in 1891, &quot;Junimea&quot; itself became the Constitutional Party. Its main figures were Carp, Maiorescu, Th. Rosetti, Negruzzi and Marghiloman. Soon, the &quot;Era Nouă&quot; slogan was also taken up by a &quot;Junimist&quot; weekly, co-edited by Petru Th. Missir, A. C. Cuza and N. Volenti, effectively a Constitutionalist paper.

Despite the schism being formalized in this manner, the Constitutional group, with its weak electoral basis, was closely allied to the mainstream Conservatives, and participated the &quot;Conservative concentration&quot; governments of 1891–1896. There were still significant tensions between the various Conservatives as the factions alternated in government. In 1889, Premier Gheorghe Manu, objecting to the &quot;Junimification&quot; of his cadres, explicitly denied him entry into his cabinet, but Carp still applauded its &quot;modern&quot; policies from the side. Although related to Sevastia Carp, Manu reportedly hated his Conservative colleague, probably because of their unequal boyar status. Carp was similarly marginalized during the fourth and final Catargiu administration (1891), but still described it as &quot;one of the most fertile and useful&quot; Romanian governments.

From November 1891, Catargiu assigned him the portfolio of Agriculture and Industry, where he replaced Manu. In this capacity, he passed the 1895 Law on Mining, which created the opportunities for industrial growth at a national level. His other contributions were a new Law on Forestry, the construction of several &quot;Model Farms&quot;, education campaigns to improve animal husbandry, and the canalization of Sulina branch (Danube Delta).

Lacking popular appeal, Carp was interested in a rapprochement with Catargiu, and, as a gesture of good-will, stripped the old &quot;Junimist&quot; and republican George Panu of his Constitutional Party membership. He continued to advise caution on the issue of Transylvanian irredenta, rekindled by the &quot;Transylvanian Memorandum&quot; scandal. He and the other Conservative front men publicly supported Aurel Popovici, the Transylvanian activist who espoused Habsburg loyalism (even though, in private, Carp described Popovici&#x27;s effort as unrealistic). Popovici too became Carp&#x27;s enthusiastic follower among the Transylvanians, counting him and Maiorescu as his personal idols.

Carp eventually incited the Conservative coalition to concede power. In an interview with his sympathizer Missir, he informed the suspicious public that, far from being a ruse, the move evidenced his party&#x27;s &quot;moral duty&quot;, that of not holding on to power against all odds. In 1898, Carp&#x27;s daughter married Alexandru D. Sturdza, son of the PNL&#x27;s Dimitrie Sturdza, who was by then the acting Premier. Despite their 1888 quarrel and their positioning on different sides of the political divide (which added journalistic interest to the wedding), Carp and Premier Sturdza were both dedicated Germanophiles. As a result of a government arrangement, Alexandru spent the next 12 years in Germany, where he trained with the Imperial Army.

===First Carp cabinet===

By 1899, &quot;Junimea&quot; was again merged into the Conservative Party. That year, Catargiu died, leaving open the issue of his succession to the Conservative Chairmanship. Carp took part in the subsequent race, but lost to Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino, who probably received decisive support from King Carol. During the election, Carp found himself a new adversary, in the person of Take Ionescu. This highly popular and young Conservative, who preserved strong links with the PNL, helped swing the vote in favor of Cantacuzino. Carp sincerely believed that Ionescu was a problem for the Conservative Party, and stated that his major goal was proving to the world that Ionescu was not a genuine politician. He was especially vexed by Ionescu&#x27;s indifference to an unwritten law, according to which the King had an ultimate say in foreign policies. Carp&#x27;s influence was also being contested by the new current formed around the Conservative Study Circle. Through its speakers Filipescu and Dimitrie S. Nenițescu, the Circle began analyzing the need for complex electoral reforms. Filipescu admired the senior leader, but Carp felt that the generation gap was unbridgeable.

P. P. Carp was Romanian Premier and Finance Minister between July 7, 1900 and February 13, 1901. Although rumors were spreading that Jewish emancipation was to be enacted by his cabinet, he was more focused on tackling the economic slump. The dire economic situation had already brought down a Conservative cabinet, in which Take Ionescu was the Finance Minister.

Unable to contract more foreign loans, Carp opened the country&#x27;s oil industry and forestry to foreign investments, and introduced budget cuts in local administration. As a leading measure, the Premier attempted to relinquish the state&#x27;s share in the National Bank of Romania (BNR). The project was opposed by BNR founder and National Liberal doyen Eugeniu Carada, who informed Carp that there was little chance of profitable privatization. BNR Governor Mihail C. Sutzu also resisted the move—the other shareholders ultimately agreed to purchase government stock, and to provide future loans for the state. As an alternative measure, Carp leased the state tobacco monopoly to a bankers&#x27; syndicate. In Education, Minister Constantin C. Arion imposed a norm against the accumulation of offices in the academic system, a measure largely directed at PNL-ist staff. Through his Minister of Internal Affairs (Constantin Olănescu), Carp also imposed strict measures against moonshiners, after which riots and bloodshed occurred throughout the poorer regions of Wallachia.

The Carp cabinet had Maiorescu as Justice Minister, and witnessed the first political disagreements between the two friends. Maiorescu was becoming convinced that Carp&#x27;s ambitions could prove dangerous for their party, and privately complained that his friend still prioritized familial obligations over the business of state. The King too worried that the &quot;Junimist&quot; budgetary policy was a failure, and Carp, announcing that he was retreating to a private life in the country, handed in his resignation. Although the monarch rejected it, Parliament passed a motion of no confidence. Backed by the German Ambassador Alfred von Kiderlen-Waechter, who welcomed its free trade agenda, the cabinet received much German encouragement before Carp&#x27;s awkward management of the crisis shook Kiderlen&#x27;s confidence.

Carp&#x27;s Liberal in-law Dimitrie Sturdza ascended to power, and, after the 1901 election, the PNL-dominated legislature preserved austerity but attracted in a large loan from the BNR. The budget reflected Carada&#x27;s belief in self-reliance, to the detriment of Carp&#x27;s international openness. Arch-rival Cantacuzino jubilated. His tribune (&quot;Steaua Olteniei&quot;) referred to the &quot;Junimists&quot; as the &quot;empty-headed old youth&quot;, whose politics were &quot;jokes and jibes&quot;. Carp also registered a personal defeat when he resigned from the Jockey Club, which had rejected the application of his young protégé Constantin Alimănișteanu.

There followed a period of readjustment inside the &quot;Junimea&quot; society. After leaving office, Carp enjoyed close ties with a former &quot;Junimist&quot; figure, the dramatist and satirist Ion Luca Caragiale. The writer had been a mild critic of Carp throughout the 1890s. Around 1905, after Caragiale settled in Germany with his family, he vacationed with Carp in Weimar. Meanwhile, Duiliu Zamfirescu, another literary &quot;Junimist&quot;, found himself disregarded by his mentors Carp and Maiorescu, and eventually split with the Conservative mainstream.

===Conservative leadership and 1908 schism===
From 1904 to 1907, Romania was governed by G. Cantacuzino, whose administration was closed to all &quot;Junimists&quot;. In the background, the P. P. Carp–Take Ionescu debate, popularly known as &quot;Take v. Petrache&quot;, was growing into a clash of doctrines. Ionescu&#x27;s effort to make himself liked by King Carol, with the intention of toppling Chairman Cantacuzino, contributed to the inauguration of Romania&#x27;s National Exhibit of 1906. The &quot;Junimea&quot; bloc, who supported Carp for that same position, boycotted the event, and Ionescu soon discovered that the monarch disliked him even more than he resented Carp. In early 1907, negotiations between Carp and Cantacuzino came to nothing: to the displeasure of Maiorescu, Carp refused to integrate his &quot;Junimists&quot; unless promised the leadership of Internal Affairs.

Soon after, the Conservative government was rocked by a nationwide peasants&#x27; revolt. Cantacuzino hastily reconciled himself with Carp and Maiorescu, attempting to consolidate his parliamentary support in times of trouble. The same year, Carp was elected Chairman of the reunified party. When it came to handling the disturbances, Carp summarized the Conservative position for the government&#x27;s benefit: &quot;First you repress, then we&#x27;ll advise.&quot; A letter of his, published in Austria-Hungary by the &quot;Pester Lloyd&quot;, even demanded foreign intervention against the rebels, and left Carp exposed to much criticism from within Romania&#x27;s Parliament. A while after, Carp may have been a witness as Carol, overstepping his attributes, hoarded away from public scrutiny all documents which recorded the death toll caused by repression. Again noted for his reaction against antisemitism, Carp also demanded, and obtained, the desegregation of farmers&#x27; unions, allowing representation to the Jewish leaseholders.

Despite their reconciliation, the Conservatives fared badly in the 1907 election, only receiving 29% of the vote, or 5,729 electors. In 1908, Ion I. C. Brătianu took over the Premiership for the PNL. Carp was an adversary of Brătianu the younger, but had a sympathy for his wife Eliza, a self-confessed admirer of Carp. Also in 1908, Take Ionescu and his supporters established their own Conservative-Democratic Party, which was immediately felt as a major coup by the Carp loyalists. The Conservative-Democratic gazette &quot;Democrația&quot; rejoiced, claiming that, other than Carp&#x27;s &quot;anemic&quot; followers, &quot;the entire Conservative Party rallies, with greatest enthusiasm, to the call of Mr. Take Ionescu&quot;. Caragiale, much upset by the Conservative policies on the peasant revolt, joined Ionescu in his effort. He also began referring to Carp&#x27;s &quot;stupidity&quot;, and to the &quot;Junimists&quot; as &quot;ciocoi&quot; (&quot;upstarts&quot;).

Additionally, Carp was facing backlash for his comments on the volatile question of Aromanian people in disputed Macedonia. Geographically cut off from its Romanian protectors, this population risked being divided between non-related Balkan nations. Interviewed by &quot;Pester Lloyd&quot; in summer 1908, Carp noted that, pressed upon by other priorities, Romania could only watch like Hecuba as the Aromanian land was divided between other states. There followed an intense media campaign against Carp: according to historian Stoica Lascu, the Romanian press was unwilling to accept a &quot;pragmatic, utilitarian, unemotional&quot; perspective on Macedonia. &quot;Democrația&quot; described the Conservative response to Aromanian pleas as &quot;cynical&quot;, and the &quot;Hecuba&quot; comment was an object of derision and journalistic metaphors for the remainder of Carp&#x27;s life.

===Second Carp cabinet===

In December 1910, Brătianu relinquished government. Carp was again appointed Premier and Minister of Finance, in what was to be his last presence in government. Under Carp, Alexandru Marghiloman took over as Minister of the Interior. The elections of February 1911, coordinated by Marghiloman, were allegedly carried out with widespread intimidation and fraud. Reportedly, the Minister initially negotiated with the PNL and Take Ionescu, offering 55 seats to the opposition, but, being refused, allowed them only 42 seats at the vote count. The events only escalated Carp&#x27;s conflict with Ionescu. The Conservative-Democrat leader stated that the new administration was illegitimate in front of both country and Crown.

The cabinet, which had Filipescu as Minister of War, still made overtures toward Ionescu (including the promise to uphold social insurance for industrial workers or tax cuts for the rural poor). There was also rumor that Carp, the opponent of centralism, had designed a project to replace the Prefectures with so-called &quot;Căpitănii&quot; (&quot;Captaincies&quot;). Although such measures were not effected, the new administration was successful in tackling other issues: both deficit and the cost of living dropped while the bank reserves trebled, and some palliatives were introduced in lieu of a land reform (the promised tax cuts, plus the freeing of &quot;mainmorte&quot; property). These policies angered the opposition Conservative-Democrats, who complained that Carp had &quot;monkeyed&quot; their own reform program. By January 1912, they joined up with the PNL in organizing mass demonstrations, calling for an immediate transfer of power, and alleging that a mass repression was being organized against them by government troops—claims met with sarcasm by Conservative newspapers such as &quot;Epoca&quot;.

Accused of having sacked non-Conservatives from national administration and of censoring the opposition, the Premier liberalized the trade in alcohol, overturned the blue law (thus ingratiating himself with the tavern-keeping lobby), and allowed soldiers to vote and run in elections. Carp also sought some bipartisan solutions, but had to deal with accusations of incompetence: the promotion of General Alexandru Averescu, a suspected embezzler, and the mishandling of public works (scrutinized by Nicolae Fleva) turned into prolonged scandals. Another political controversy opposed Carp to the leaders of the Romanian Orthodox Church. It began when the Conservatives, wishing to overturn the PNL&#x27;s partnership with members of the clergy, attempted to topple Metropolitan-Primate Atanasie Mironescu with support from Gherasim Safirin. That push offered political ammunition to Ionescu, who called Carp&#x27;s religious policy &quot;debauchery&quot;. Mironescu held his seat for forty days, but eventually resigned in protest, and was replaced with Conon Arămescu-Donici.

The Carp cabinet still managed to impose its policies on other contentious topics. By March 1912, when he passed a new law on Northern Dobruja, Carp had adopted the colonial views of his contemporaries: all ethnic Romanian immigrants to the province, including the new arrivals from Transylvania, were raised to the same level of citizenship as the local Muslims. In unison, Carp again overrode the Aromanian issue, resuming friendly relations with the Aromanians&#x27; nominal oppressor, the Kingdom of Greece. He rejected Aromanian pleas to demand concessions from the Greek government, noting: &quot;I shan&#x27;t allow Romanian Macedonians to interfere with Romania&#x27;s foreign policy.&quot; The Carp administration, and even its Aromanian public servants, opined that the Aromanian community was small in numbers and virtually Hellenized. This stance was mirrored by Carol&#x27;s, who ordered absolute neutrality on the issue of ethnic clashes in Macedonia.

Although Carp had publicized his detailed program of government, the focus fell on a scandalous &quot;Tramcar Affair&quot;, which the Premier was keen to exploit. At election time, Marghiloman revealed that the PNL had patronized a corruption network which misused the Bucharest Town Hall budget, meaning that various National Liberal figures risked being arrested. Carp refused to negotiate on the issue, even after the two opposition parties embarked on their anti-government campaign. Through its junior member Constantin Stere, PNL also began agitating for universal male suffrage (a project which the PNL itself later buried).

In November 1911, P. P. Carp gave his locally famous &quot;Hot Iron&quot; (&quot;Fierul Roșu&quot;) speech in Parliament, announcing his intention of branding the PNL as a party of thieves. The legal face-off between the Tramcar Society and the authorities who attempted to dissolve it was advantageous to the former, and hurt Marghiloman&#x27;s prestige. The Interior Minister was caught up and mauled in a PNL-instigated public rally, and the Bucharest Conservative Chapter was sacked before Police could intervene. The Conservatives responded with a peaceful show of unity, during which Carp accused the opposition of sparking revolution to preserve a mere business interest. King Carol decided to mediate, asking Carp to seek a rapprochement with the Conservative-Democrats, but Take Ionescu posed unlikely conditions, such as a reformed constitutional regime and a public apology from Carp to Ion I. C. Brătianu.

===1913 marginalization===

What happened next shocked Carp, and ruined his friendship with Maiorescu. In April 1912, the latter extended his hand to Ionescu and Filipescu, and a new coalition was created against both Brătianu and Carp. Once Maiorescu took over as Premier, Carp handed in his resignation from the post of party leader (stating &quot;I&#x27;ll not sacrifice immortal ideas for a passing chairmanship&quot;), but his colleagues refused to accept it; he did not present himself for the 1912 elections, and became the only head of a parliamentary party not to hold a seat. In 1913, he tried to reaffirm his position in the Conservative Party by convening an irregular Party Congress, but effectively lost the leadership.

These events coincided with a new international crisis, centered on the new Kingdom of Bulgaria. The First Balkan War of 1912 opened the way to a Greater Bulgaria, posing various threats to Romanian territorial ambitions. The mood in Bucharest was pro-war, and the populace saw an opportunity for hitting the interests of the Triple Alliance. Unusually, Carp numbered himself among the more hawkish proponents of a preemptive war with Bulgaria, suggesting outright the annexation of Southern Dobruja. Instead, Maiorescu signed a Russian-brokered peace deal, through which Romania received Silistra. This concession failed to satisfy Carp and his supporters, and also sparked a militaristic reaction in Bulgaria.

A Second Balkan War erupted, in which Romania joined the regional coalition against Bulgaria and occupied all the Dobrujan South. While the Maiorescu administration prepared the Peace of Bucharest, and after failed efforts to make himself obeyed by fellow Conservatives, Carp presented his resignation to Ioan Lahovary, head of the Bucharest Conservative Club. This time around, it was accepted. In one of his letters, Negruzzi discussed how Carp braved his political isolation with jokes and wit, but noted: &quot;Only he knows how it really feels deep down. [...] As the saying goes: a man will do things to himself that the devil will not even venture to attempt.&quot; At the time, Carp&#x27;s son Grigore was also coming under attack from the political opposition. &quot;Furnica&quot;, the satirical magazine, accused Carp Sr of nepotism, noting that Grigore had taken a position of power inside the Bucharest bureaucracy.

Although he was no longer on speaking terms with Carp, Maiorescu valued his hard-line stance on the sensitive land reform issue, and, as new National Liberal cabinet was in the making, urged Carol to accept Carp as Leader of the Opposition. This offer was again dismissed by Carp, who felt himself betrayed a second time when Maiorescu ran unopposed for the Conservative chairmanship (November 1913). During early 1914, the Conservatives faced another split, when some of their members (Simion Mehedinți, Dimitrie Onciul etc.) created the faction of &quot;Conservative-Progressives&quot;, who demanded the enactment of some political reforms not found in Maiorescu&#x27;s program. Unlike Carp, Maiorescu had already decided to retire, but only did so when he made sure that his disciple Marghiloman would succeed him (June 1914).

===World War I hawk===
The start of World War I in August 1914 was a moment of deep crisis for Romania. The country was still aligned with the Central Powers, through the Triple Alliance, but the Romanian public was largely supporting the Entente Powers. Going against the grain, Carp was for honoring the previous commitment, asking for Romania to declare war on the Entente, and therefore on Russia. He and King Carol were the only two statesmen who supported that option during the Crown Council of August 3, where a majority decided in favor of prolonged neutrality. The king and his former minister were saddened by the circumstances of their defeat: when Carp stated that the majority was legitimate but regrettable, Carol shook his hand and called him &quot;a true statesman&quot;. During the Council, Carp first made public his belief that the Central Powers were unbeatable, and reprimanded the PNL men who voted for neutrality: &quot;Nice one you pulled off. You have wrecked Romania.&quot;

Carol died on September 27, and was succeeded by his nephew Ferdinand I. Between March 1915 and August 1916, with private German funding, Carp put out the political newspaper &quot;Moldova&quot;, which popularized his take on the war, and, as historian Ion Bulei writes, &quot;was entirely against the nation&#x27;s current.&quot; In his first editorial, &quot;Idealul național&quot; (&quot;The National Ideal&quot;), he implied that Romania&#x27;s very survival was uncertain as long as Russia still bordered the Danube Delta; he therefore urged Romanians to focus on taking back the province of Bessarabia, held by Russia since 1812. Carp again advised against war on the Central Powers for the taking of Transylvania: &quot;If we take Transylvania and lose the Mouths of the Danube, we are lost and so is Transylvania. If, on the other hand, we extend our borders to the Dniester, the Transylvania issue will be there to solve for future generations, with ease and without going into conflict with the Austro-Hungarian Empire.&quot; He explained his rationale in more detail within the 1915 brochure &quot;România și Războiul European&quot; (&quot;Romania and the European War&quot;), issued with Poporul S. A., where he noted that a unified Greater Romania was the stuff of utopia, and stressed that Transylvania&#x27;s Romanians could benefit from Austrian loyalism.

Such ideas were also being expressed by other &quot;Moldova&quot; collaborators. The paper postulated that &quot;Germany is invincible&quot;, and that national unity &quot;can only begin with the liberation of Bessarabia&quot;. The staff included co-editor Virgil Arion, who published &quot;Carpist&quot; opinion pieces. Carp&#x27;s ideas were also taken up by Dinu C. Arion (Virgil Arion&#x27;s nephew), Ioan D. Filitti, Marin Simionescu-Râmniceanu and D. V. Barnoschi. Other interventions were signed by Negruzzi, Andrei Corteanu, Alexis Nour, Radu Rosetti, and various pseudonymous authors. &quot;Moldova&quot; also offered ample space to the Bessarabian-born Germanophile Constantin Stere, Carp&#x27;s former rival in the &quot;Tramcar Affair&quot;.

The Conservative Party was again divided, as an &quot;Ententist&quot; bloc emerged around Nicolae Filipescu; the most prominent and committed &quot;Germanophiles&quot; were Carp, Maiorescu, Th. Rosetti and Marghiloman. Within the latter camp, Carp was the more radical, for demanding a quick intervention. He continuously warned that the reported sufferings of the Transylvanian folk were a minor issue when compared with the need to preserve Romania&#x27;s independence. This notion was expressed in his last speech to Parliament, a reply to Take Ionescu&#x27;s pro-Entente rhetoric (December 1915)—as various commentators have noted, it was not Carp&#x27;s greatest proof of elocution. Others, however, deem it &quot;memorable&quot;, &quot;unequaled&quot;, or at least &quot;remarkable&quot;.

In January 1916, &quot;Moldova&quot; came out under the headline &quot;We Want War with Russia&quot;. The Maiorescu-Marghiloman faction opted instead for friendly neutrality—they only envisaged active participation if the Austrians were to hand over Bukovina region, and if the legal status of Transylvanian Romanians would be improved. Sources record Marghiloman&#x27;s attempt to mediate a new understanding between Carp and Maiorescu, rejected by Carp with the words: &quot;Never, nothing with Maiorescu.&quot; The Entente&#x27;s envoy Carlo Fasciotti perceived Maiorescu as more flexible, and repeatedly tried to talk him out of Germanophile politics.

===Carp and the German occupation===

In the second half of 1916, the Germanophile option was ruled out by Premier Ion I. C. Brătianu. With Ferdinand&#x27;s acquiescence, Brătianu signed the secret treaty of Bucharest, which attached Romania to the Entente and promised her the annexation of Transylvania and Bukovina (&quot;see Romania in World War I&quot;). The news was communicated to the country&#x27;s statesmen at a new Crown Council, on August 27, 1916. There followed a heated exchange between Carp and the King, as witnessed by the other participants—including arch-rival Take Ionescu, who noted &quot;[Carp] is Shakespearean in his error.&quot; Prophesying defeat, Carp brought into discussion Ferdinand&#x27;s German (Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen) lineage. To his &quot;No Hohenzollern was ever defeated&quot;, Ferdinand tacitly acknowledged the issue: &quot;I have already defeated one&quot; (that is, himself). Carp then shocked the audience by stating: &quot;I shall pray to God that the Romanian army be defeated&quot;, or, &quot;I wish you&#x27;d be vanquished, for your victory would mean the country&#x27;s destruction and demise.&quot; Sources also diverge on what Carp said next. One story is that he promised to sacrifice his sons for a cause he did not believe in, by allowing them to be drafted into the Romanian military. According to others, what he actually meant was that the three young men would be serving the Central Powers.

In fact, Lieutenant Petre Carp Jr died shortly after, serving as a Ferdinand loyalist in the abortive Romanian expedition into Transylvania. The loss greatly affected Carp, who withdrew to Țibănești, before friends persuaded him to join them in Bucharest. He was in the city as Romanian troops registered crushing defeats, and watched on as the King and his ministers followed the army on a hasty retreat into Moldavia. As the Romanian authorities established a provisional capital in Iași, the indignant Carp personally witnessed the triumphal entry of German troops into Bucharest.

The occupiers, especially Germans, regarded Carp as a friend, or, according to researcher Lisa Meyerhofer, &quot;a natural ally.&quot; Through negotiator Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș, the invading force initially called on Carp and Maiorescu to join their effort of pacifying Romania; both &quot;Junimists&quot; promptly rejected this offer. Carp himself referred to the project as &quot;nonsense&quot;, and bluntly refused to be contacted by Maiorescu for further deliberation on the subject. Soon however, a core group of &quot;Carpist&quot; supporters, headed by the bureaucrat Lupu Kostaki, became the nominal civil administration of occupied Romania. The exercise of powers by the new apparatus varied greatly: Kostaki, appointed &quot;Verweser&quot; (temporary administrator) at the Interior Ministry, could only advise on some policy matters, while Al. C. Hinna had a free say in organizing the Justice department.

Carp did not hold an official post, but he was the &quot;éminence grise&quot;, arranging the removal of most bureaucrats who had been left behind by the Brătianu cabinet, or drafting plans for a future Carp cabinet in conversations with German military ruler August von Mackensen. The proposed government was to include Kostaki, Barnoschi, Radu Rosetti and Dimitrie S. Nenițescu, alongside zoologist Grigore Antipa and Colonel Victor Verzea. The Carpists were still committed to the cause of Bessarabia, and Kostaki assured his backers that, with German help, the province would eventually be made part of Romania. Early in 1917, Carp&#x27;s son in law, Colonel Alexandru D. Sturdza, deserted from the Moldavian front and made his way to Bucharest. He claimed that Russia had effectively occupied Moldavia, and wanted to organize a rival Romanian Army to liberate Iași. Some sources state that Carp immediately repudiated him upon arrival, but one account places Sturdza among Carp&#x27;s visitors and confidants, as late as December 1917.

In summer 1917, Lupu Kostaki issued a document popularly known under the archaic, and possibly mocking, title of &quot;Pantahuza&quot; (&quot;The Encyclical&quot;). It was in effect a list of signatures for creating a Carp dictatorship upon the end of war, and its social impact, even in the context of occupation, was minor. Meanwhile, plagued by heart trouble and depression, Maiorescu died, an event which pushed &quot;Junimism&quot; farther on the road to collapse. Carp made a point of not attending his rival&#x27;s funeral, commenting: &quot;Why should I pay Maiorescu a courtesy visit that he will never be able to return?&quot;

===1918 reversal and Carp&#x27;s death===

By early 1918, the government in Iași was experiencing a major military crisis. The October Revolution and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk took Russia out of the war, and Ferdinand eventually appointed Marghiloman Premier, allowing him to sign Romania&#x27;s disadvantageous peace with Germany. Carp, together with the Germanophile diplomat Ioan C. Filitti, also attempted to take part in brokering this deal, but found the treaty to be very unfair toward his defeated country. Meanwhile, in March, the Bessarabian Moldavian Democratic Republic entered a union with Romania, which, to his contemporaries, seemed to confirm that Carp had been right about the outcome of war.

Later, some Carpists joined Marghiloman&#x27;s administration as it attempted to restore order in the land, but most continued to campaign for their own leader to take hold of government. On Carp&#x27;s namesday (June 29, 1918), he received an open letter, signed by 40 of his supporters, describing him as a providential figure, and calling on him to fulfill his political mission of governing Romania. In addition to senior Carpists, the signers included poet Alexandru Macedonski and Caragiale&#x27;s two sons, Mateiu and Luca. On Marghiloman&#x27;s list, Carp was elected deputy in the legislative election of 1918. However, he chose not to take part in proceedings, and his seat was left vacant. His political line was expressed by means of a new gazette, &quot;Renașterea&quot; (&quot;The Renaissance&quot;), published by Nenițescu with assistance from Kostaki, Radu Rosetti, Alexandru Al. Beldiman and Ion Gorun. &quot;Renașterea&quot; went down in late November 1918, shortly after the unexpected Armistice with Germany sealed the fate of Germanophiles and brought the Ententists back into focus.

The new context again cemented the Ententists&#x27; reputation: the country, now joined with Bessarabia, became Greater Romania when the Romanian Transylvanians voted for their own union act, and Bukovina too was incorporated. The developments perplexed Carp, leaving him to comment: &quot;Romania is so lucky, that she can do without her statesmen.&quot; By early 1919, he was living in seclusion at his Țibănești manor. During May, the King&#x27;s Commissioner began an investigation into Germanophile activities, questioning Carp about his wartime activities, and, more insistently, about those of his disciples. This action sparked protests in the media. Even the formerly Ententist &quot;Adevărul&quot; daily noted, through Constantin Costa-Foru, that the effort to make Carp incriminate himself was &quot;a despicable calumny.&quot; Similarly, the &quot;Bucovina&quot; gazette of Iancu Flondor and Pamfil Șeicaru expressed concern that &quot;a moribund&quot; was being hassled while &quot;so many common delinquents roam free&quot;.

According to Carp&#x27;s own words: &quot;We have entered the era of revenge acts initiated by scoundrels and nitwits.&quot; However, the National Liberal establishment was itself unsure about how to approach the Carp dilemma. Discussing the 1919 prosecutions in his later essays, PNL leader Ion G. Duca asserted: &quot;Should one have limited them to the Carpists? [...] Could one, in the name of holy justice, punish them, without also punishing Carp, their leader and inspiration? And would it have been politically sound to prosecute Carp, at his more than 80 years of age, after his 50 years of honest public life?&quot;

After illness, Petre P. Carp died in Țibănești, on June 19, 1919, being almost 82 years of age. In a &quot;Bucovina&quot; epitaph, Șeicaru deplored the departure of one great &quot;reactionary&quot;, &quot;a man of too great dimensions to be fighting against such small people&quot;.

==Political vision==

===General traits===

Initially a cultural venture, &quot;Junimea&quot; fought for a new order in Romanian culture, and not least of all for German influences. Historian Lucian Boia defines their effort as &quot;a bitter combat for &#x27;disciplining&#x27; Romanian culture, for its emergence from dilettante Romanticism and the adoption of a responsible and rigorous attitude&quot;. P. P. Carp embodied the political force of &quot;Junimism&quot;, a fact once noted by Maiorescu: &quot;When &quot;Junimea&quot;″s literary activity ceased in Iași, when &quot;Junimea&quot; was gone—&quot;Junimists&quot; stayed on. Amid this group of older and newer arrivals [was] the man who synthesized its political action, Mr. P. Carp, with his recognized talent of capturing and rendering the characteristic note of any situation&quot;. Carp had a similar role in shaping the Conservative Party—in his own words, the pre-&quot;Era Nouă&quot; party life was self-contradictory and the party line was &quot;hodgepodge&quot;. Virgil Nemoianu proposes that, from the early 1870s, their participation in government, with all its contradictions, hastened the emergence of a &quot;liberal conservatism&quot;, or &quot;B-conservatism&quot;, that eventually restructured Catargiu&#x27;s traditional conservatism. Although for long informal, Carp&#x27;s role as Conservative mentor was universally acknowledged: in seriousness or in jest, his contemporaries would almost always address him as &quot;Your Excellency&quot;.

An essential contribution of his was creating a political avatar of a &quot;Junimist&quot; cultural metaphor, that of &quot;forms without content&quot;—namely, the belief that Romanian society had swallowed up modern ideas without adapting them to its backward realities. Carp welcomed Westernization as a basic requirement, but argued that its import of &quot;forms&quot; had rendered politicians unwilling to address the &quot;content&quot;. He once noted: &quot;For some, science is all that which has seen print. They discovered, already black on white, the ideas of some author, picked up his ideas, without ever considering whether the theory agrees with the practice, whether the difficulties of accomplishing it are subject to abstract aspirations&quot;. The wholesale modernizers, he stated, were &quot;planting flowers into sandy soil&quot; or building &quot;a castle on sands&quot;. In order to elevate the &quot;content&quot;, Carp suggested a slow build-up of civic consciousness and a steady increase of the middle class.

However, as the voice of elitism, Carp criticized collective and natural rights, and argued that careers in politics should only be opened to those who already had a major source of income (&quot;starting at 40,000 lei&quot;). From early on, he spoke of the actual nation as being a country&#x27;s ruling class, excluding &quot;plebs&quot;, and even proposed the reduction of parliamentary seats by half. Carp believed that: &quot;Since [...] the Pharaohs of Egypt, the demagogues have been inciting the passions of the plebs and preaching democracy and the redistribution of wealth. For millenniums now, the crowd and the rabble keep on working, and the elite keeps on governing&quot;. In his definition, the office holders needed to remain at all times separate from the passionate crowd. A physician, he argued, could trust his patients to describe their symptoms, but should not take their orders on what medicine to prescribe.

Carp did not object to more democratization, but criticized the PNL&#x27;s way of handling the process as a &quot;top-down revolution&quot;, and saw the 1884 abolition of the census suffrage as untimely and absurd. Even before 1911, while debating the issue with George Panu, Carp deemed universal male suffrage a far too advanced option for Romania. Revisiting the issue in 1914, Carp also implied that the only result would be a generalized fraud, forever advantageous to the PNL. Political scientist Ioan Stanomir concludes that, once distinguished from the PNL&#x27;s &quot;Messianism&quot; and Catargiu&#x27;s &quot;immobilism&quot;, gradualism &quot;became, with P. P. Carp, one of the instruments with which the new conservatives sought to reorganize the state.&quot;

While exposing himself to accusations of &quot;Germanism&quot; from the &quot;Red&quot; camp during the late 1860s, young Carp mockingly stated that his priorities were in fact elsewhere: &quot;I am not a Germanophile, I am a Russophobe.&quot; Carp, expressing alarm over the &quot;Russian danger&quot; in much the same terms as his nationalist rival Mihai Eminescu, is sometimes described as an &quot;anti-Slav&quot;. He repeatedly cautioned the public that Russia&#x27;s agenda, menacing for Romania, corresponded with the Pan-Slavic ideal. Thus, citing &quot;our historical experience&quot;, Carp produced the slogan: &quot;Under no circumstances us and Russia together&quot;, shortened by some to &quot;Never with Russia&quot;. In 1915, he assessed that Russia was secretly planning to occupy the Danube Delta and part of Moldavia, to take over the Turkish Straits, and to turn the Black Sea into a &quot;mare clausum&quot;.

With his critique of centralism, P. P. Carp advocated not just communal self-governance, but also regionalism. He expressed the opinion that any strict control coming in from Bucharest with the purpose of erasing regional loyalties, could never expect to turn locals into better citizens. As noted by Lucian Boia, Carp&#x27;s main priorities, from the recovery of Bessarabia to the protection of the Delta, mainly concerned his native Moldavia: &quot;a national program for sure, but with an undeniable Moldavian flavor.&quot; Academic Ion Agrigoroaiei also writes: &quot;&quot;Moldova&quot; had the merit of drawing attention to Bessarabia, a region that some [Romanians] considered as lost.&quot; Among the dedicated Moldavian Carpists, some were highly critical of rule from Wallachia, almost to the point of advocating separatism. Carp&#x27;s Ententist adversaries seized on this ambiguity, accusing Carp of being not just a traitor, but also a Moldavian secessionist.

===Carp on social improvement===

Carp saw himself as a pragmatic man, noting that his interest in policy was determined by real needs, rather than by political schemes, &quot;literary phantasmagoria&quot; or &quot;abstract theories&quot;. In effect, commentators propose, Carp and Maiorescu were the exponents of a liberal-conservative and Tory ethos, with models such as Alexis de Tocqueville (repeatedly invoked by Carp), François Guizot and Edmund Burke. Supporting economic liberalism and free trade, Carp urged the Romanian underclass to enrich itself through private enterprise, but came to the conclusion that Romanians were naturally inclined to evade work. His attempt to regulate the alcohol industry was related to that discourse: Carp stated that peasants &quot;should be protected from their own vices&quot;, and once told an irate Eminescu that, in addition to being &quot;lazy&quot;, the Romanians were &quot;drunks&quot;. Such attitudes lead scholar Sorin Adam Matei to conclude that Carp was a paternalistic positivist by reflex.

In the 1880s, Carp openly stated that the &quot;Junimist&quot; goal was the complete integration into society of people with no wealth of their own—or, as he called them, &quot;proletarians&quot;. This, more than the protection of landed property, inspired him to oppose land reform. Carp argued that the land&#x27;s division into small plots was inoperable, and therefore not desirable, and only saw industrial agriculture emerging from the historical estates. Additionally, the Romanian aristocrat opposed on principle the idea that the state should become involved in redistribution, arguing that the landless would in time purchase, and &quot;slowly&quot; learn to make the best of, their own parcels. In line with this vision, when indentured peasants threatened to stop working on the estates, he proposed sending in armed soldiers as their supervisors. His belief in labor as an instrument of self-help was taken up in his own private life: at age 70, Carp could be seen planting walnut trees or packing butter, although, to the left-wing journalist Constantin Bacalbașa, he still appeared a generally listless character.

For different reasons, Carp and Maiorescu preferred agriculture to industry, and were just as likely to demand checks on urban and industrial growth. Carp&#x27;s own solution to urban proletarization was grassroots corporatism, with modernized guilds that were supposed to provide the working class with &quot;solidarity&quot; and &quot;prestige&quot;. Carp imagined a guild network supported by and supporting an educational system that, unlike the one conceived by PNL-backed educationists, was to be decentralized and vocational. He intervened personally to help the schoolchildren on his Țibănești domain, donating money and participating on a student examination board (1886).

In his defense of organic capitalist enterprise, Carp also opposed the PNL&#x27;s protectionism. Political scientist Victor Rizescu even suggests that his flexible economic model was a &quot;more authentic&quot; liberalism than the one professed by PNL men. Similarly, Matei calls Carp&#x27;s &quot;technocratic&quot; &quot;Junimism&quot; a &quot;second liberal tradition&quot;. Against PNL nationalists, Carp proposed to tackle deficit spendings by contracting foreign loans, although he supported the gold standard as an extra precaution. He adamantly supported foreign investments in front of repeated criticism, noting that, at the very least, they stimulated competitiveness among local businesses. The main institutional consequence, his 1895 Law on Mining, was condemned by the PNL as a huge concession to foreign capital.

The core &quot;Junimists&quot;, Carp included, were also critics of most emerging welfare state projects. Beginning in 1881, he and Maiorescu spoke out against the emergence of socialist clubs in Moldavia. Carp called them a &quot;social disease&quot;, but, as Premier, toned down repression against all socialist groups. While Carp is often perceived as an uncompromising disciple of German nation-builder Otto von Bismarck, he had an ambiguous take on the Bismarckian State Socialism program. Nemoianu thus suggests that &quot;Junimism&quot; was largely incompatible with Bismarck&#x27;s own economic tactics and political maneuvering. However, Stanomir argues, Carp did in fact conceive of an &quot;embryonic&quot; welfare state, &quot;following in the trail of Bismarckian endeavors.&quot;

One of Carp&#x27;s other priorities was upholding the rule of law against institutional failure. According to cultural historian Z. Ornea, Carp fashioned himself into &quot;the apostle of honesty and selfless civic-mindedness&quot;, with &quot;Quixotic&quot; effects. He proposes that Carp still maintained &quot;the &quot;Junimist&quot; principles of sincerity and honesty&quot;, whereas Maiorescu &quot;had submitted himself to reality&quot;. Carp&#x27;s attitudes, according to Silvia Bocancea, were &quot;Manichean&quot; and possibly theatrical at times. To his contemporaries, he seemed uncompromising to the brink of arrogance. Reportedly, Carol I once confessed: &quot;I never felt less a King than when Carp had the reins of government&quot;, while Take Ionescu simply believed Carp to be &quot;senile&quot;. Such mistrust also came from foreign sources. In 1903, Ambassador Kinderlen reported that, although a man with &quot;genius ideas&quot;, the Germanophile Premier was &quot;coarse&quot;, annoying, and inclined &quot;to throw himself in head-first&quot;. Eight years on, the French press was reporting with displeasure on Carp&#x27;s strictness, fearing that it led Romania into becoming &quot;a German hinterland&quot;.

By the 1880s, Carp suggested, the territorial administration had been redesigned to function as a political machine, or &quot;giant electoral device&quot;. He believed that corruption was the direct consequence of excessive politicking and bureaucracy, which absorbed human energies out of the economic sector, and which the PNL seemed to encourage. The result of such trends, he argued, was a &quot;budgetary&quot;, &quot;budgetivore&quot; or etatist pseudo-democracy, as opposed to a working and transparent liberal democracy. Even after the 1882 rapprochement between &quot;Junimea&quot; and Brătianu, Carp attacked the PNL as a sanctuary of endemic corruption: &quot;I know Mr. Brătianu does not desire [corruption], but corruption does desire him, and, with invisible but numerous arms, like those of a giant polyp, squeezes him and will squeeze him till he&#x27;s choking.&quot; Shortly after the &quot;Hot Iron&quot; speech of 1911, he addressed Brătianu an equally famous exhortation: &quot;Always be fair in your private life, always be selfless in your public life.&quot;

===Philosemitism===

P. P. Carp was an outspoken critic of generic intolerance, seeing it as the enemy of civic values. Speaking in 1892, he theorized: &quot;Culturally speaking, the first sign of a backward state is intolerance. When somebody thinks that only he is right, that there is nothing outside his brain and absolutely nothing in social life, he is an uncultured being, who never had a chance of knowing how varied, how many, there are manifestations of human thinking.&quot; As Carp noted, the natural breakdown of &quot;forms without content&quot;, and the disruption of traditional lifestyles, had made it tempting for regular Romanians, and for crowd-pleasing orators, to use the Jew as a scapegoat. Carp&#x27;s political isolation was only increased by such discourse. According to Virgil Nemoianu, Carp was his usual &quot;trenchant&quot; speaker on this subject as well. Historian Armin Heinen notes that, with the minor socialist movement and, at times, Maiorescu, Carp was one of the very few to demand collective Jewish emancipation in the final quarter of the 19th century.

Carp&#x27;s openness on this issue dated back to his political debut, and was at the time compatible with the philosemitic agenda of Alexander John Cuza. It was opposed to the antisemitic program adopted in 1860 by Ion Brătianu and the Moldavian &quot;Fractionists&quot;, and later to the PNL&#x27;s overall antisemitism, but Carp also shunned antisemites in his own camp, including Eminescu. During its brief existence, &quot;Térra&quot; attacked &quot;Red&quot; politics as duplicitous, noting that the liberals arbitrarily expelled Jews from Romania and excused pogroms, but that they feigned innocence whenever European observers were brought in. These pronouncements also impacted on Carp&#x27;s traditional rivalry with Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu. Hasdeu dismissed young Carp, Maiorescu and their patron Manolache Costache Epureanu as the &quot;Judaized&quot; Moldavians, and continued to periodically target Carp which such remarks for over thirty years.

As an extension of his ideas on industriousness, Carp also advised Romanians to reject the PNL&#x27;s economic antisemitism, insisting that the solution to all real economic problems was the capitalist work ethic. He witnessed with concern how antisemitism damaged Western attitudes about Romania. In the early 1870s, when Bismarck implied that Romania&#x27;s Jews risked being stoned by their Christian neighbors, he replied (probably tongue-in-cheek): &quot;Your Excellency should not forget that the Romanian has barely emerged out of the Stone Age.&quot; His unpopular ideas on the Jewish issue only had one prominent Romanian disciple, the &quot;Junimist&quot; philosopher Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, who used them in denouncing the antisemitic Democratic Nationalist Party.

Although Carp&#x27;s views on Jewish integration were exceptionally modern, his philosemitism had its specific limitations. These were discussed by cultural historian William O. Oldson, for whom Carp is, &quot;by Romanian standards&quot;, the &quot;most magnanimous&quot; and &quot;altruistic&quot; of 19th-century legislators. However, Oldson cautions, Carp&#x27;s own project granted &quot;piecemeal&quot; concessions to local Jews. As &quot;Junimist&quot; leader, he did not intervene to help Jewish linguist Lazăr Șăineanu, whose naturalization was energetically opposed by the PNL antisemites. By 1912, Carp&#x27;s own law excluded Jewish and Armenian immigrants to Northern Dobruja from even being considered in the naturalization process.

===Carpist &quot;renaissance&quot;===
In 1917, the massive failure of pro-Entente forces seemed to confirm that P. P. Carp had been right to press for a German alliance. Carp&#x27;s supporters, and probably Carp as well, believed that the occupation signaled a &quot;renaissance of the Romanian state&quot;. A conjectural supporter, Alexandru Al. Beldiman, summarized its immediate goals: &quot;we must reform the very foundation of internal administration, primary schooling, agrarian relations and the peasant issue; we must again generate the conditions for a well-governed state.&quot; Carp himself came to the conclusion that it was necessary to depose Ferdinand I and offer the Romanian throne to a German or an Austrian prince. Romanian monarchism, Carp thought, was doomed either way, since Ferdinand&#x27;s Russian allies were only going to depose him in due course. According to diaries kept by his Germanophile friends, he even began referring to Ferdinand as &quot;that ass&quot;, and found Prince Frederick William a most suitable candidate for the Romanian throne.

Still a legalist, Carp refused to enact such a program before Ferdinand and his government had been completely defeated. Reputedly, he informed the occupiers: &quot;get moving and drive the Russians entirely out of the country—then we&#x27;ll be talking about organizing and creating my administration.&quot; According to Marghiloman, he later reduced such demands, only urging the Germans to quickly nominate their own choice of a Romanian king. He irritated the occupiers, addressing them as equals or posing more direct demands, and advising Lupu Kostaki to behave in the same manner. However, researchers suggest, his cooperative stance was always more controversial than that of his nominal enemy Maiorescu. The latter politely refused offers for joining Kostaki&#x27;s ministry, and remained loyal to Ferdinand until the moment of his death.

Lucian Boia believes that Marghiloman&#x27;s rise to power in early 1918 was Ferdinand&#x27;s compromise with the moderate Germanophiles: &quot;[Marghiloman] had not turned more German than the Germans, as Carp had done. He had not spoken out against the dynasty, although he let it be understood that the king might reconsider the situation and abdicate. [...] In circumstances where defeat was being acknowledged, Marghiloman seemed to be the one solution. Carp was too old, too intransigent and too isolated.&quot; Moreover, before becoming Premier, Marghiloman had categorically denounced the &quot;Pantahuza&quot; conspiracy. In Carp&#x27;s view, Marghiloman&#x27;s separate peace of 1918 was scandalous, because (he claimed) the territorial demands of Romania&#x27;s lesser adversaries had taken precedence over Germany&#x27;s long-term projects. Reputedly, he and Beldiman worked hard to undermine Marghiloman&#x27;s reputation with the German side. Carp&#x27;s refusal to participate in the 1918 Parliament was another sign of dissatisfaction. According to his political ally Nenițescu: &quot;Neither Carp nor I shall be taking part in parliamentary procedures. This legislature is a sham. They elected many Liberals and [Conservative-Democrats] who have fled to Marghiloman&#x27;s camp.&quot;

==Literary contribution==
Carp&#x27;s contribution to Romanian literature was incidental, and his choice of literary subjects evoked political priorities. That political propensity even touched his work as translator: as Nemoianu writes, Carp and the other early &quot;Junimists&quot; were trying to raise the expectations of Romanians by familiarizing them with the Western canon. According to Carp&#x27;s biographer Constantin Gane, such cultural efforts were in the end &quot;consumed by the torch of political passion&quot;. Writing in the 1940s, literary historian George Călinescu assessed that the first-generation &quot;Junimists&quot; largely failed at generating great literature; he includes Carp in a category of society members who are &quot;either outside literature, or forgotten.&quot; Other readers have also argued that the Constitutionalist spokesman had effectively squandered his literary chances, a &quot;prodigal son&quot; who missed out on improving the literary content of &quot;Junimism&quot;. Nevertheless, Carp still managed to maintain a reputation as the &quot;harshest and most cultured critic&quot; among &quot;Junimea&quot; affiliates (according to Iacob Negruzzi).

&quot;Junimism&quot; was mainly directed at the Romanticism and didacticism of its liberal adversaries, demanding clarity in style and the preservation of classical unities. Carp&#x27;s Neoclassicism was complete, whereas in other &quot;Junimists&quot; it blended with Romanticism. The entire club was, as theater historian Marina Cap Bun writes, &quot;obsessed&quot; with the work of Shakespeare. Carp&#x27;s other references, upheld in front of other authors, include Jean de La Fontaine in poetry, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in drama, and Arthur Schopenhauer in general aesthetics—his expectation that these models would interest his contemporaries were, according to cultural historian Z. Ornea, unrealistic. Against those with &quot;corrupted&quot; tastes, Carp also upheld a local figure, the &quot;Junimea&quot; poet Vasile Alecsandri.

Carp&#x27;s work as a reviewer blended politics with aesthetics, a &quot;ferociously destructive&quot; or &quot;excessively incisive&quot; attack on the supremacy of dilettante Romantics. He was at times only interested in pure derision, and, together with Vasile Pogor, remains recognized as the &quot;acerbic&quot; &quot;Junimea&quot; ironist. In reference to Hasdeu&#x27;s historiographic tracts, Carp wrote: &quot;To even discuss his parchments is but the custom of parvenus.&quot; Similarly, in tackling Gheorghe Sion&#x27;s politically charged fables, Carp asserted that nobody but Sion could ever comprehend them: &quot;the only clear things about [the edition] are [Sion&#x27;s] portrait and the preface&quot;. In a more famous debate, he rejected Hasdeu&#x27;s attempt to introduce a Romantic cult around Ion Vodă cel Cumplit. Hasdeu believed that, in his constant battle against the medieval aristocracy and the clergy, Ion Vodă served a national interest; contrarily, Carp wrote that &quot;tyranny and cruelty&quot; could never serve the public, and that Hasdeu&#x27;s favorite was merely a glorified sadist. His stance on the issue was of contemporary interest, because Carp implicitly criticized those &quot;Reds&quot; who supported &quot;Domnitor&quot; Cuza&#x27;s authoritarianism. However, Carp&#x27;s later condemnation of Hasdeu&#x27;s &quot;Răzvan și Vidra&quot; &quot;lacks common sense&quot;, according to George Călinescu. Carp contended that the work, a &quot;mystification&quot; of little artistic worth, should never even have been made public. Hasdeu defied his rival with similar jibes, and, when he put out a new edition of the work, even used Carp&#x27;s article as a foreword.

In matters of literary style, Carp tried to follow his own guidelines, and played a minor but relevant part in the development of literary Romanian. He was interested in cohesion and modernity, as acknowledged by linguist I. E. Torouțiu: &quot;Carp&#x27;s language stepped out of its temporal framework and placed itself 60 years ahead in time [...]. Carp has contributed to purifying and renovating our literary language&quot;. Between successive editions, his translations were purged of residual and odd neologisms, adopting pure phonemic orthography, and helped define standard theatrical jargon. Under his management, &quot;Térra&quot; newspaper had an informative and calm tone, defying the sensationalism of other press venues and adopting the standards of cultural &quot;Junimism&quot;. However, Carp passes for, at best, an acceptable writer—&quot;very good&quot;, but still not &quot;great&quot;, according to his &quot;Junimea&quot; colleague A. D. Xenopol. His Shakespearean translations are, according to Călinescu, &quot;bad&quot;. It remains unclear whether Carp truly followed the English originals: when a journalist expressed his doubts about his linguistic proficiency, Carp visited him and calmly addressed him what may have been English words of profanity. Carp&#x27;s claim has again been placed in doubt when, generations later, it surfaced that he took his notes from the German-language Shakespeare editions.

Carp made his leading contribution with speeches, and is traditionally regarded as one of the top orators in his generation. According to Ion Bulei, his voice was shrill, with an exotic Moldavian lilt, but Carp always imposed himself by being &quot;intelligent and concise&quot;, in sharp contrast with the &quot;Romantic phraseology&quot; of his contemporaries. As a public speaker, Carp sometimes resumed his earlier press debates with the PNL, notably by reproaching on his adversaries that they were enshrining Romania&#x27;s own version of Whig history. He was especially upset by the accolades bestowed on PNL men for their supposed roles in obtaining Romanian independence. In 1886 Carp offered an alternative &quot;Junimist&quot; narrative of how &quot;national sovereignty&quot; came about, with only two actors: &quot;the king and the foot soldier&quot;.

The PNL&#x27;s own Ion G. Duca once acknowledged that P. P. Carp was &quot;the most spiritual man of his time.&quot; However, according to Eliza Brătianu, the Conservative doyen easily made himself enemies with his wit, and was often misunderstood by his peers. Carp, she writes, had the character of a spoiled &quot;only child&quot;, and was constantly &quot;ahead of his time&quot;. His &quot;Junimist&quot; sarcasm was transferred into his political discourse, and some of his caustic remarks have been preserved in cultural memory. During the battle for Conservative leadership, Carp addressed Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino&#x27;s claim to have the purity and transparency of crystals, informing him that see-through beakers were usually empty. In 1901, when deputy Grigore Trandafil metaphorically offered his own head if Carp would renounce fiscal reform, Carp retorted, deadpan: &quot;I&#x27;d have no use for it.&quot; In reference to Take Ionescu&#x27;s public speaking abilities, he argued: &quot;Talent does not justify all avatars, just as beauty does not justify all forms of prostitution&quot;.

==Legacy==

A few years after Carp&#x27;s death, despite Marghiloman&#x27;s revival attempts, the Conservative Party diminished and was absorbed into the eclectic People&#x27;s Party, taking with it the legacy of 19th-century conservatism. According to Bulei, &quot;a wave of indignation and oblivion&quot; erased Carp&#x27;s political precepts from Romanian public life. Writing in 2010, Bocancea suggested that Carp&#x27;s disappearance was the loss of a political model, characterized by &quot;conviction&quot;, &quot;the refusal to compromise&quot;, and &quot;civility&quot;. She notes: &quot;Sadly, the political model that [Carp] stood for did not generate as many followers as to form a critical mass that would dominate Romanian political life&quot;. Bocancea and Nemoianu also write that, once left vacant, the Conservatives&#x27; position was abusively taken up by the far right.

Carp is an incidental presence in various literary works. Very early examples include a fable by &quot;Junimea&quot; poet Anton Naum (where Carp is &quot;Jâgoranu&quot;, a variant of Reynard the Fox) and the invectives of poet-journalist N. T. Orășanu. The subject of a similar debate over his Germanophile activities, Constantin Stere gave Carp a fictional portrayal in his 1930s novel &quot;În preajma revoluției&quot; (&quot;On the Eve of the Revolution&quot;), disguised under the name of &quot;T. T. Flor&quot;. Eugen Lovinescu (better known as literary historian and liberal theorist) also fictionalized Carp&#x27;s encounters with Eminescu in the 1934 novel &quot;Mite&quot;. Outside this realm of literature and satire, Romanian cuisine preserves the statesman&#x27;s memory in the &quot;Petre Carp &quot;Mezelic&quot;&quot;, an assortment of passerine offal and pork rind.

As noted by Boia, Carp and his wartime attitude were prime targets for historical revisionism. This process began in the 1920s, when popular historian Constantin Kirițescu described Carp, Marghiloman and most other Germanophiles in harsh terms, insisting that their platform was of marginal importance. Such interpretations were opposed by other authors, including the political history essays of Carpist Ioan C. Filitti and the apologetic Carp biography by Constantin Gane (both 1936), while Lovinescu rediscovered Carp the literary figure in his 1932 anthology on &quot;occasional writers&quot;. Among the 1930s intellectual youth, some, including Lovinescu disciple Nicolae Steinhardt and political essayist Petre Pandrea, rediscovered Carp as a political and moral guide.

Carp&#x27;s ideas regarding Russia and the need to defend eastern Romania were again invoked in conjunction with World War II. After the Soviet Union obtained the cession of Bessarabia (1940), it became apparent that, contrary to Carp&#x27;s advice, Greater Romania had failed to conceive of any long-term strategy for territorial guarantees. This was notably acknowledged in the 1941 book &quot;P. P. Carp, critic literar și literat&quot; (&quot;P. P. Carp, the Literary Critic and Man of Letters&quot;), by Lovinescu, the former Ententist supporter. Lovinescu noted that Carp&#x27;s &quot;never with Russia&quot; was prophetic, and that it naturally applied to the spread of Bolshevism.

The Romanian communist regime, installed in 1948, simply dismissed Carp and all his generation as unfrequentable reactionaries, and viewed all sides of World War I as imperialistic. The Carp family was evicted from Țibănești (nationalized in 1949), and some members were forced into internal exile. Beginning in the 1960s, national communism officially adopted a thinly revised version of Kirițescu&#x27;s stance, viewing Germanophila with a mixture of condemnation and embarrassment. Some new paths to interpreting Carp&#x27;s policies were only made available after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Even then, Lucian Boia notes, historians tended to minimize or simply omit references to Carp&#x27;s support for the Central Powers, which, to them, still contradicts standard patriotism. In tandem with its reevaluation by other scholars, Carp&#x27;s historical role has been repeatedly invoked by conservative individuals, think tanks and political groups in post-revolutionary Romania. Others additionally assert that Romania&#x27;s European integration, effected by 2007, implicitly confirmed, re-contextualized and avenged Carp&#x27;s external policy.

Țibănești hosts two busts in Carp&#x27;s likeness, respectively donated by rival groups which claim his inspiration: the (post-2005) Conservative Party and the Democratic Party. Founded in 1867, the local primary school was renamed in his honor. Carp&#x27;s manor, fallen into disrepair by 2008, was refurbished by architect Șerban Sturdza, then turned into a center of learning for traditional handicrafts. Sturdza is a descendant of Elsa Carp-Sturdza, and has successfully sued the state for the property rights. The Dorobanți townhouse, another landmark closely associated with Carp, hosts Turkey&#x27;s diplomatic mission to Romania.

<text>The Five Man Electrical Band (known as The Staccatos from 1963 to 1968) is a Canadian rock band from Ottawa, Ontario. They had many hits in Canada, including the top 10 entries &quot;Half Past Midnight&quot; (1967) (as The Staccatos), &quot;Absolutely Right&quot; (1971) and &quot;I&#x27;m a Stranger Here&quot; (1972). Internationally, they are best known for their 1971 hit single &quot;Signs&quot;.

== History ==
=== Initial success as The Staccatos (1963–1968) ===
The band The Staccatos was formed in Ottawa in 1963. It initially included singer Dean Hagopian, guitarist Vern Craig, bass player Brian Rading and singer/drummer Rick Bell (born Rick Belanger). Hagopian left after about a year and was replaced by vocalist and guitarist Les Emmerson, who would become the band&#x27;s prime songwriter, while Bell and Emmerson split lead vocal duties.

The Staccatos made their debut as a recording act in 1965, with their early singles being written by Craig and Emmerson. After releasing a non-charting single on a small independent label, the group signed to Capitol Records of Canada, and their second single, &quot;Small Town Girl&quot;, made it into the Canadian top 20. Several follow-ups also cracked the top 40, and The Staccatos were rising stars in their native country. Their debut album, &quot;Initially&quot;, came out in 1966 and featured their hits to that point as well as several new recordings.

In the summer of 1966, Mike Bell (Rick&#x27;s brother) joined the group as a second drummer and third vocalist. Shortly thereafter, the group had their biggest hit to date with &quot;Half Past Midnight&quot;, which rose to No. 8 on the Canadian charts. It was the second Staccatos single written solely by Emmerson, who by this point was writing most of the band&#x27;s original material. Also in 1968, The Staccatos issued a joint album, &quot;A Wild Pair&quot;, with The Guess Who?, each band taking up one side of the LP.

The Staccatos follow-ups to &quot;Half Past Midnight&quot; did not meet with as much success in Canada. In the US, the situation was worse – the band&#x27;s singles (released by Capitol and Tower) failed to chart at all.

Looking for a new direction, at the end of 1968, Ted Gerow was added to the line-up on keyboards, and shortly thereafter, Vern Craig left. 

Around the same time, while recording their second full album, the band was prompted to change their name by producer Nick Venet&#x27;s comment that the name The Staccatos sounded &quot;dated&quot;. After discussing various possibilities, bassist Rading seized upon a song Emmerson had written called &quot;Five Man Electrical Band&quot;, claiming it&#x27;s exactly what the group was. The band&#x27;s name was duly changed: Five Man Electrical Band released their self-titled album in early 1969.

=== Rebirth as Five Man Electrical Band (1969–1975) ===
The group&#x27;s new single &quot;It Never Rains On Maple Lane&quot; with B side &quot;Private Train&quot; was a mild success in Canada; the A-side appeared at No. 67 on the charts, but after two weeks on the charts the single was flipped over and B-side &quot;Private Train&quot; made it into the top 40, peaking at No. 37. The album, meanwhile, contained a mixture of new material and older recordings originally released under the Staccatos name (including &quot;Half Past Midnight&quot;) and was similarly successful in Canada. But when follow-up singles failed to chart, the band ended their relationship with Capitol, at the end of 1969, and moved back to Ottawa from Los Angeles.

They eventually decided to try it again back in L.A. and hooked up with Dallas Smith and his company Renaissance Productions, who was partnered with Canopy, a production company co-owned by writer Jimmy Webb. The band then set about recording some demos, though nothing was released right away.

By November 1969, Canopy had signed a deal with MGM Records, whose parent company, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, placed one of the songs recorded, &quot;Moonshine (Friend Of Mine)&quot;, in a movie, &quot;The Moonshine War&quot; (1970), that featured Alan Alda.

MGM then released the group&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;Good-byes and Butterflies&quot;, which created a minor controversy with a front cover picture that featured a marijuana plant; the album was withdrawn and subsequently reissued with a new cover.

Next came the single &quot;Hello Melinda, Goodbye&quot; with &quot;Signs&quot; on the &quot;B&quot; side. But after the single failed, MGM dumped the band, who once again returned to Ottawa. 

By this time, Dallas Smith had met Clive Fox, who had a connection to Lionel, LLC, makers of model railroading equipment, who was forming a record label in conjunction with them, Lionel Records (later called Lion Records). In February 1971 MGM assigned all rights to the group over to the Lionel Entertainment Corporation. And in May 1971, Lionel re-released the album &quot;Good-byes and Butterflies&quot; and the song &quot;Signs&quot;, now on the &quot;A&quot; side.

Disc jockeys and the public immediately took to &quot;Signs&quot;; it reached No. 4 in Canada, No. 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and went to No. 1 in Australia for nearly two months. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in August 1971.

During the next few years, the band toured extensively in the U.S. and Canada, sharing the stage with groups like the Allman Brothers Band, Jefferson Airplane, Bachman-Turner Overdrive and many others, while a number of charting singles were released: &quot;Absolutely Right&quot; (No.3 in Canada, 26 in the U.S.), &quot;Money Back Guarantee&quot; (No. 17 in Canada, 72 in the U.S.), &quot;Werewolf&quot; (No. 28 in Canada, 64 in the U.S.) and a few others, all written by Emmerson. Outside of Canada the band continued with a steady flow of concert dates. 

In January 1972 the band issued &quot;Coming Of Age&quot;, their third album as Five Man Electrical Band. But Emmerson, who was more interested in recording in the studio than in playing live, also established a parallel solo career in 1972.

Mike Bell, now going by his birth name of Michael Belanger, left the group partway through the recording of their 1973 album &quot;Sweet Paradise&quot; and bassist Brian Rading left just as the album was being finished. Bassist Joe LaManno and drummer John Raines were brought in to finish up the record, which produced several hit singles, including &quot;I&#x27;m A Stranger Here&quot;, their highest-ever charting hit in Canada (at No. 2, but it only managed No. 76 in the U.S.). Emmerson, Gerow and Rick Belanger attempted to keep things going with new players for a time, producing singles in 1974 and &#x27;75, with minimal chart success outside of Canada.

Rick Belanger left the group in 1974, leaving Emmerson and Gerow as the only remaining permanent members of the ostensibly &quot;Five Man&quot; band. Shortly thereafter, when 1975&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Get A Gun&quot; peaked at a lowly No. 69 in Canada, Emmerson and Gerow decided to disband the Five Man Electrical Band.

=== Reunions===
During the mid-70s, Emmerson continued to work as a solo artist and he and Brian Rading were part of a new group called Emmerson Electrical Band during the late 70s. He also worked with an outfit called The Cooper Brothers in the 70s and early 80s.
In 1986 the Five Man Electrical Band reunited with all five original members: Les Emmerson, Brian Rading, Ted Gerow and Rick and Mike Belanger (joined by Vern Craig on the Staccatos numbers) for the Children&#x27;s Wish Foundation of Canada charity fundraiser at the Ottawa Civic Centre. The Cooper Brothers and another band called Bolt Upright were also on the bill. This was supposed to have been a one time only deal, but the reformed band continued on, playing a series of concert and festival appearances each year after that. 
Over the next thirty plus years, the band continued to make annual appearances, mostly in their native Canada. Rick Belanger left after playing the Canada Day 1997 Celebration at Major&#x27;s Hill Park in Ottawa on 1 July of that year. Steve Hollingworth (drums, percussion, vocals) replaced him in 1998. Wes Reed (percussion) joined up in 2001 and second guitarist Ross McRae was added in 2002 (succeeded by Brian Sim in 2007). Brian Rading retired in 2004, making way for Rick Smithers, while Mike Belanger departed in 2013, leaving Les Emmerson and Ted Gerow as the lone original members. 

Emmerson also retained the rights to the band&#x27;s recordings, and licensed several best-of compilations on CD.

Tesla scored a hit with a cover of the song &quot;Signs&quot; on their album &quot;Five Man Acoustical Jam&quot; in 1990, and in 2005, Fatboy Slim released a single called &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Man Get You Down&quot;, based mostly on a looped sample from &quot;Signs&quot;, specifically the opening line, &quot;And the sign said long-haired freaky people need not apply.&quot;

Brian Rading, bassist and founding member, died of cancer, age 69, on 8 June 2016 at his home in Hull, Quebec.

Les Emmerson died at his home in Ottawa at age 77 on 10 December 2021 of COVID-19 after suffering from several other health issues that weakened his resistance to the virus, according to his family.

After Emmerson&#x27;s death, the group continued on with Mike Crepin (vocals, guitar), but following Gerow&#x27;s retirement in 2022, the band (who recruited keyboardist Allen Wilmore and continued on) now had no original players.

<text>&quot;Mukhtar al-Jawahir&quot; (), &quot;Mivchar HaPeninim&quot; (. lit. &quot;The Choice of Pearls&quot;), an ethics work of sixty-four chapters. It has been attributed to written by Rabbi Shlomo ben Yehudah since the 19th century, but this is doubtful. It was originally published, along with a short commentary, in Soncino, Italy, in 1484, and has since been re-worked and re-published in many forms and abridged editions (e.g. Joseph Ḳimcḥi versified the work under the title &quot;Shekel ha-Kodesh&quot;).

The work is a collection of maxims, proverbs, and moral reflections, many of them of Arabic origin, and bears a strong similarity to the Florilegium of Hunayn ibn Ishaq and other Arabic and Hebrew collections of ethics sayings, which were highly prized by both Arabs and Jews.

<text>The Saturn Sky is a convertible sports car that was produced by Saturn, and was initially released in the first quarter of 2006 as a 2007 model. It uses the &quot;Kappa&quot; automobile platform shared with the Pontiac Solstice. The Sky concept was shown at the 2005 North American International Auto Show, with the production version following at the 2006 show. It was built at GM&#x27;s Wilmington Assembly plant in Wilmington, Delaware, alongside the Solstice. The Sky featured 18-inch (457 mm) wheels and a 2.4 L Ecotec &quot;LE5&quot; inline-four engine with direct injection and variable valve timing that produced , a new 2.0-litre turbocharged direct injected inline-four engine also featuring VVT that made and 260 lb⋅ft (353 N⋅m). An optional dealer-installed MAP sensor and ECM flash upgrade kit was also available for the Red Line model from 2008 onwards, making and on manual transmission models and and on automatic transmission models. Both five-speed manual and automatic transmissions were available.

The styling for the Sky, penned by Franz von Holzhausen, was based on the Opel Speedster&#x27;s design. It was available in some European markets as the Opel GT. A rebadged version named the Daewoo G2X was unveiled as a concept vehicle for the South Korean market in 2006. The production version was released in September 2007.

The Wilmington Assembly plant closed in July 2009, ending production as both the Pontiac and Saturn nameplates were retired.

== Concept ==

The Saturn Sky would, upon release, differ greatly from the initial concept. The 2005 auto show Sky featured four doors-- two suicide doors behind the front two, following in Saturn tradition. It was to feature a rear light bar, a 2+2 seating arrangement, and a significantly more bulbous exterior, one very far removed from the rather sharp and small-profiled Sky that actually released. Evidently, the Sky of reality was based far more on the 2002 Pontiac Solstice concept, keeping the &quot;Sky&quot; moniker in name only.

==Sky Red Line==
A Red Line model of the Sky was introduced on April 11, 2006 at the New York Auto Show. It uses the same turbocharged Ecotec engine as the Pontiac Solstice, as well as the same standard 5-speed Aisin manual transmission. An automatic transmission is optional.

The Red Line had a standard torque-sensing limited-slip differential, standard StabiliTrak stability control, and an enhanced sport suspension over the standard Sky (available as a dealer-add on for regular models). Other exterior enhancements included dual tip exhausts, 18-inch wheels, and a specific front fascia modeled for the Red Line. On the inside, the Red Line had a special leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls, special embroidery on the seats and floor mats, metallic door sill covers and stainless steel pedals, special tachometer and gauges, and a digital boost gauge in the Driver Information Center. The Red Line model started shipping in the third quarter of 2006, with a retail price starting at $29,795.

== Differences from the Solstice ==

=== Interior ===
Whereas the Solstice&#x27;s interior created a cluster of functions in a rightwards motion stemming from the steering wheel, the Sky&#x27;s interior favored a more thinly-spread, traditional layout of buttons placed all across the vehicle. The Sky featured one fewer hand-hold than the Solstice, instead placing the vehicle&#x27;s electrical socket nearby the lost appendage. The vehicles had differing shifters, gauges, air vents, power window/mirror/lock control placements, and different placements of the passenger airbag notifier in addition to the dissimilar button placements.

The Sky was marketed as being more luxurious than the Solstice, offering power windows, traction control, cruise control, keyless entry, leather steering wheel wrap, fog lights, StabiliTrak, and a limited-slip differential as standard equipment — all optional on the Solstice.
=== Exterior ===

Both Solstice and Sky shared their platform, engine and transmission, as well as numerous other parts from other General Motors models. 

The Saturn Sky exhibited slightly different badge positioning and nomenclature to the Solstice, opting for no front quarter panel badging (which was atypical for the brand at the time of the vehicle&#x27;s release, though more common in later vehicles), a badge mounted to the front fascia, rear badges reading &quot;SKY&quot; and &quot;TURBO&quot; with no mention of the brand&#x27;s name, only the Red Line badge preceding &quot;SKY&quot; on the left and the Saturn badge in the center beneath the third brake light.

The optional spoilers for both were mounted and shaped unlike one another, with the Sky&#x27;s being taller and more pronounced, giving a more stereotypically muscular appearance to the Sky&#x27;s back end, whereas the Solstice received a more evolved, simplified appearance in the rear. The Sky had an alternate rear fascia to the Solstice, showing a lower singular reverse light and smoother texture. The side brake lights had chrome outlines and the third brake light was colored white instead of red. Exhaust tips were also different, as the Sky&#x27;s were square instead of circular.

While both the Sky and Solstice were offered as drop-top convertibles, the Solstice was offered with an available targa top, which was not used for the production run of the Sky.
==Limited editions==

===2008===
For the 2008 model year, GM offered the Carbon Flash Special Edition Saturn Sky. Unlike the two Limited Edition models launched later in 2009, its production was slightly higher at 550 units. The Carbon Flash Special Edition featured a unique metallic Carbon Flash paint color, removable silver racing stripe standard, and Monsoon premium audio standard. The largest differentiator, however, is Carbon Flash Edition&#x27;s silver inserts in the interior seating and steering wheel that provide a black-on-silver appearance.

===2009===
For the 2009 model year, GM launched two limited-edition Saturn Sky roadsters jointly; Ruby Red Special Edition and Hydro Blue Limited Edition. Both are VIN-coded and some blue books track it as a limited-edition vehicle. All limited editions featured Monsoon premium stereos.

The Ruby Red Edition featured the Ruby Red color and a unique, removable carbon racing stripe that was exclusive to the 500 Sky units produced in this trim.

The Hydro Blue Edition featured a Hydro Blue color, as well as matching blue-colored stitching in the seats and gear shifter. Also, the word Sky stitched into the seats is changed to matching-blue color as well. All Hydro Blue Edition Saturn Sky units were sold with the removable silver racing stripe.

GM had planned to make 500 Hydro Blue units to match the 500 Ruby Red Special Edition Sky build count. However, Hydro Blue units were being built as GM was declaring bankruptcy, resulting in the immediate termination of the Kappa platform. As such, only 89 Hydro Blue Edition Saturn Sky roadsters were built.

The Hydro Blue paint color (and seat/shifter blue stitching) was offered on the Pontiac Solstice. However, it is not VIN coded as a unique/limited edition, racing stripes were not standard, and seats do not have blue-colored lettering. Hydro Blue is the rarest color in all three vehicles; Sky Roadster, Solstice Roadster, and Solstice Coupe.

==2010 production==
In April and May 2009 the Wilmington, Delaware, plant built thirty 2010 model year VIN-coded cars on the Kappa platform. Of those, 8 were Saturn Skys. The other remaining included 12 Pontiac Solstice Coupes, eight Pontiac Solstice roadsters, and two Opel GTs. They were then used as GM company vehicles to be evaluated and also as special event display vehicles. These vehicles were built to the 2010 model year specs with 2010 model year changes and had legal 2010 VIN numbers. All 8 2010 SKYs were purchased by the same dealer in Minnesota and subsequently sold as used vehicles. Among changes to the SKY for the 2010 model year was the addition of remote start on automatic-equipped cars, option package changes and additions, and three new colors. Those colors were Kinetic Blue, Opus Green, and Dark Labyrinth Metallic.

===2010 SKYs produced===
* SKY, Black Lt. Cashmere Leather Tan LE5 Auto Chrome Air
* SKY Red Line, Kinetic Blue Black Leather Black LNF Auto Polished Air
* SKY Red Line, Black Red Leather Black LNF Auto Polished Air
* SKY Red Line, Dk Labyrinth Met Black Leather Black LNF Auto Chrome Air

==Daewoo G2X==

Daewoo had already shown a version of the Opel Speedster called the Daewoo Speedster, but this remained a one-off. In 2006, they showed a show car called the Daewoo G2X; simply a rebadge of the Saturn Sky. In September 2007 it entered production, for the South Korean market only. It remained on sale until early 2009 and 179 examples were delivered in total. The South Korean version was only offered with the turbocharged engine from the Sky RedLine, combined with the five-speed automatic transmission.

<text>Peter Leitch VC (August 1820 – 6 December 1892) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Peter Leitch was brought up in Milnathort, Orwell, Kinross-shire in Scotland, becoming a carpenter and joiner. He enlisted in the Royal Engineers in about 1844–45. After a number of postings, in 1854 he joined the Baltic campaign as one of 106 army sappers who accompanied the Royal Navy fleet. In the Baltic he took part in the Battle of Bomarsund where, as a corporal, he had charge of the carpenters who laid the platform of a British battery landed on Åland Island. Leitch returned to England at the close of the Baltic operations, and was soon sent to the Crimea, arriving early in 1855. Here he took part in the siege of Sebastopol, maintaining the gun platforms of the siege batteries of the British &#x27;right attack&#x27;. 

==VC action==
Leitch was a 34 year old colour-sergeant in the Corps of Royal Engineers, British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

For his Crimea service, Leitch also received the 5th class of the French Legion of Honour.

==Later career==
After the Crimean War, Leitch served at Gibraltar before returning to England. Rising to the rank of sergeant major, he finally left the army after 28 years service in the Royal Engineers, of which 17 had been spent abroad. He was then employed in the Royal Engineers office at Dover, Kent, before retiring due to failing health.

He died in London on 6 December 1892 at the age of 72, and was buried in Margravine Cemetery (also known as Hammersmith Cemetery) in West London. Although the grave memorial was lost when much of the cemetery was levelled and cleared during the 1950s, a new headstone was placed on Leitch&#x27;s grave site by the Victoria Cross Trust in 2016.

Leitch Row, a road in Brompton, Gillingham, Kent is named after him.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross and other medals are displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum in Gillingham, Kent.
