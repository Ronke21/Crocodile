<text>In France, the appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée (, ; abbr. AOC ) is a label that identifies an agricultural product whose stages of production and processing are carried out in a defined geographical area – the &quot;terroir&quot; – and using recognized and traditional know-how. The specificity of an AOC product is determined by the combination of a physical and biological environment with established production techniques transmitted within a human community. Together, these give the product its distinctive qualities. 

The defining technical and geographic factors are set forth in standards for each product, including wines, cheeses and meats. Other countries and the European Union have similar labeling systems. The European Union&#x27;s protected designation of origin (PDO and PGI) system has harmonized the protection of all geographical indications and their registration. When labelling wine however, producers may still use recognized traditional terms like AOC, and are not required to display the PDO and PGI logos or terms, mostly for aesthetic purposes.

== How the labeling system works ==
The AOC certification of authenticity is granted to certain geographical indications for wines, cheeses, butters, and other agricultural products by the &quot;Institut national de l&#x27;origine et de la qualité&quot; (INAO). The certification system is designed to protect distinctive and traditional regional products, based upon the concept of &quot;terroir&quot;. Terroir refers to a given geographical area having specific environmental and human features that affect an agricultural product&#x27;s key characteristics. These factors are meant to capture unique environmental features (e.g. type of soil, topology of the production environment, local climate) and farming and processing practices (e.g. the steps taken and inputs used in producing a specific type of cheese). Thus, it includes the traditional savoir-faire that goes into the production of AOC products. Taken together, these give the product its distinctive qualities.

The terroirs of AOCs vary dramatically in size. Some cover vast expanses with a variety of climatic and soil conditions, while others are small and highly uniform. For example, the Côtes du Rhône AOC covers some 75,000 acres (about 30,000 hectares) and 171 villages, making it one of the largest AOCs. However, within its area lies one of the smallest AOCs, Château-Grillet, which occupies less than of land.

The INAO&#x27;s mission is to ensure that all AOC products are held to a rigorous set of clearly defined standards; they are to be produced in a consistent and traditional manner with ingredients from specifically classified producers in designated geographical areas. The products must also be aged at least partially in the respective designated area.

Under French law, it is illegal to manufacture and sell a product under one of the AOC-controlled geographical indications if it does not comply with the criteria of the AOC. In order to make them easily recognizable, all AOC products carry a seal. The seal displays a number as well as the name of the certifying body. The color of the seal indicates the product classification: green for field products and red for dairy products.

To prevent any possible misrepresentation, no part of an AOC name may be used on a label of a product not qualifying for that AOC. This strict label policy can lead to confusion, especially where towns share names with appellations. If the town of origin of a product contains a controlled appellation in its name, the producer (who is legally required to identify the place of origin on the product label but legally prohibited from using the full town&#x27;s name unless the product is an approved AOC product) is enjoined from listing anything more than a cryptic postal code. For example, there are a dozen townships in l&#x27;Aude that have Cabardès in their names, several of which are not even within the geographical boundaries of the Cabardès AOC. Any vineyard that produces wine in one of those towns must not mention the name of the town of origin on the product labels.

== History ==

The origins of AOC date to 1411, when the production of blue Roquefort cheese was regulated by parliamentary decree. The first French law determining viticultural designations of origin dates to the 1 August 1905, and, on 6 May 1919, the Law for the Protection of the Place of Origin was passed, specifying the region and commune in which a given product must be manufactured. This law has since been revised many times.

On 30 July 1935, the &quot;Comité National des appellations d&#x27;origine&quot; (CNAO) was created by representatives of the government and the major winegrowers to manage the administration of the AOC process for wines at the initiative of Joseph Capus. In the Rhône wine region Baron Pierre Le Roy Boiseaumarié, a trained lawyer and winegrower from Châteauneuf-du-Pape, successfully obtained legal recognition of the &quot;Côtes du Rhône&quot; appellation of origin in 1936.

After World War II the Committee became the public-private &quot;Institut National des Appellations d&#x27;Origine&quot; (INAO). The AOC seal was created and mandated by French laws in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. On 2 July 1990, the scope of work of the INAO was extended beyond wines to cover other agricultural products.

==Product coverage==
=== Wine ===

Over 300 French wines are entitled to the display the AOC seal on their label. Wines still may use this label, despite classification under EU and UK law as Protected Designation of Origin. In 2018, 47% of the wines produced in France were wines with a controlled designation of origin.

Legislation concerning the way vineyards are identified makes recognizing the various AOCs very challenging for wine drinkers not accustomed to the system. Often, distinguishing classifications requires knowledge of esoteric label laws such as &quot;Unless the wine is from a &quot;Premier Cru&quot; vineyard, the vineyard name must be printed in characters no more than half the height of the ones used for the village name.&quot;

On the other hand, while the process of label approval is enforced to the millimetre, the quality control for the wine in the bottle is less strict. A blind taster must approve the wine for it to receive AOC classification, but this tasting often occurs before the product is even bottled, and by a local expert who may well have ties to the local vintners. Even if the taster is objective, the wine sample may not be representative of the actual product, and there is almost no way to verify that the finished bottled product is the same as the original AOC sample.

=== Cheese ===
In 1925, Roquefort became the first cheese to be awarded an AOC label, and since then over 40 cheeses have been assigned AOC status. The generally are also classified as Protected Designations of Origin under EU law, and thus use the PDO/AOP logo, rather than the AOC logo.

=== Other products ===

* Meat: On 15 August 1957, the National Assembly gave AOC status to the poultry of Bresse (Poulet de Bresse). In 2006, it awarded AOC status to salt marsh lamb raised in the Bay of the Somme. In September of the same year, the INAO validated the Fin gras du Mézenc.

* Lavender oil: In 1981, the AOC label was given to Haute-Provence Lavender Essential Oil. It refers to a very high-quality production and concerns only the essential oil of fine lavender - &quot;Lavandula angustifolia&quot;. The fields must be located within a specific territory at a minimum altitude of 800 meters. This geographic area covers 284 communities in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Hautes-Alpes, Drôme and Vaucluse regions.

* Lentils from Le Puy-en-Velay have AOC status as well as PDO-status as Lentille verte du Puy.

* Honey from the island of Corsica has been given AOC status. There are six certified varietals of Corsican honey: Printemps, Maquis de printemps, Miellats du maquis, Châtaigneraie, Maquis d&#x27;été, and Maquis d&#x27;automne.

* Butter: France recognizes the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Vienne, Deux-Sèvres and Vendée AOC regions for butter. The Beurre Charentes-Poitou was accorded AOC status in 1979 and PDO status in 1996 as Beurre Charentes-Poitou / Beurre des Charentes / Beurre des Deux-Sèvres.

* Spirits: Armagnac, Calvados, Cognac and Martinique Rhum agricole all have AOC status.

==Other countries&#x27; labels==
=== European Union ===
EU law has created a similar type of protection for regional products called the AOP (appellation d&#x27;origine protégée; or, in English, Protected designation of origin, PDO). This protection recognizes products that are the &quot;result of a unique combination of human and environmental factors that are characteristic of a given territory.&quot;

Most products with an AOC designation also have a protected designation of AOP under EU law. For those products, only the EU PDO/AOP designation can be used. However, &quot;wines&quot; with a PDO/AOP status can still use the French AOC designation.

After Brexit, all geographic indications already established under EU law as of 31 December 2020 are also recognized under UK law, according to Article 54, paragraph 2 of the withdrawal treaty.

=== Other EU countries ===
Many other countries have based their controlled place name systems on the French AOC classification. Italy&#x27;s Denominazione di Origine Controllata and Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita followed the model set by the French AOC, and the EU standard for Quality Wines Produced in Specified Regions (QWpsr) also corresponds closely.

While Spain&#x27;s denominación de origen is very similar, the classification of Rioja in 1925 and Sherry in 1933 preceded the French AOC system by a few years and show that Spain&#x27;s DdO system developed parallel to France&#x27;s AOC system to some extent. Similarly, Germany&#x27;s Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete is a wine classification system based on geographic region, but it differs from the AOC in important ways. Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete wines are commonly seen as less prestigious than Qualitätswein mit Prädikat, making it more similar to the Vin de Pays or Vin Délimité de Qualité Supérieure systems.

Portugal&#x27;s Denominação de Origem Controlada, Austria&#x27;s Districtus Austria Controllatus, South Africa&#x27;s Wine of Origin, and Switzerland&#x27;s AOC-IGP are all similar to the French AOC system as well.

=== Switzerland ===
Switzerland has an &quot;appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; certification for wines and an &quot;appellation d&#x27;origine protégée&quot; certification for other food products. Before 2013, the &quot;appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; was used for all products.

===United States===
The United States&#x27; American Viticultural Areas also follows the model set by the French AOC. The United States Department of the Treasury&#x27;s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau even uses the legal terminology &quot;Appellation of Wine Origin&quot; to describe a vintage wine&#x27;s location of origin. The AVA indication on a label indicates that 85% of the grapes for wine are grown in the designated AVA. Overall, the appellation of a wine simply says where the grapes are from, although there are some particularities. If the appellation is a state, 100% of the grapes which go into the wine must come from the specific state. If a winery gets grapes from a neighboring state (for example, a California vintner getting Pinot noir from Oregon), it may label the wine &quot;Oregon&quot;, but if the state is not a neighboring one (for example, a California vintner getting Cabernet from Washington state), the only permitted appellation is &quot;American&quot;.

===Canada===
In Canada, there is a government-sanctioned wine standard called Vintners Quality Alliance (VQA). It only applies to Canadian wines, and only the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia regulate it.

== International trade issues ==
Outside their home country, the protections afforded by the AOC status may not be available in foreign markets. Part of the problem arises from the fact that European migrants to various countries marketed food products under the names referring to the places they came from (e.g. Parmesan, Rioja). After many years, such names became simply generic names for food products. Thus, products which are labelled AOC in France or AOP in the European Union may compete in international markets with foreign products that refer to a geographical origin that has nothing to do with where the product is produced (e.g. Parmesan that is produced in the United States and not in a narrowly defined region of northern Italy).

In such cases, bilateral agreements with other countries, whereupon the signatories agree to accord a special status to a list of designated products. The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and the European Union is an example. Alternatively, the country can seek the development of rules or agreements at the World Trade Organization.

Since each country has its own legal and agricultural framework, the specifics of each trade relationship are likely to vary. Also, there are often conflicts between trademarks and geographical indications. For instance, in Canada, only Canadian wines can be VQA approved but other certification trademarks can be registered under the intellectual property regime. The owner of a certification trademark is then allowed to sell licences to be used for certain products meeting the owner&#x27;s criteria. Thus in the case of wines, one AOC certification trademark is owned by the French Republic, while another is owned by &quot;Maison des Futailles&quot;, a wine producer, of which the publicly owned Société des alcools du Québec is a partner.

<text>H.M. Prison Brisbane, commonly known as Boggo Road Gaol, was Queensland&#x27;s main prison from the 1880s to the 1980s. By the time it closed, it had become notorious for poor conditions and rioting. Located on Annerley Road in Dutton Park, an inner southern suburb of Brisbane, it is the only surviving intact gaol in Queensland that reflects penological principles of the 19th century. After closing in 1992, the larger 1960s section was demolished, leaving the heritage listed section (built as a women&#x27;s prison in 1905).

It was officially known as &quot;Brisbane Gaol&quot; but was commonly known as &quot;Boggo Road&quot; after the original name of the Annerley Road. A new street formed after 1996 now has the name Boggo Road.

==History==

In the 1850s, the district where the gaol was subsequently located was known unofficially as &quot;Boggo&quot; or &quot;Boggo Scrub&quot;, and by the late 1850s the track through the area was known as Boggo Road. 

It has been suggested that the name came about because the area was very boggy in wet weather. Another theory is that Boggo (or &quot;Bloggo&quot; or &quot;Bolgo&quot;) was a corruption of an Aboriginal word meaning &#x27;two leaning trees&#x27;, and that the road was named after two prominent trees at either One-Mile Swamp or what is now Wilkins Street, off Annerley Road. Another possibility is that Boggo Road was an unofficial and unmaintained short-cut between Ipswich Road and Stanley Street that became very boggy after rain. Boggo Road was officially renamed Annerley Road in 1903, but the colloquial name for the gaol that had long been in use stayed.

In 1863, land off Boggo Road was set aside as a government reserve, finally proclaimed a gaol reserve in 1880. The first cellblock opened on 2 July 1883, built by Robert Porter, contained 57 cells, and was constructed using materials from the demolished Petrie Terrace Jail. In 1903, a new prison was built to hold female prisoners. This later became known as the No. 2 Division, and is now the only section still standing, and is listed on the Queensland State Heritage Register. The &quot;No. 1 Division&quot; built in 1883 was the scene of 42 hangings, including the hanging of Ernest Austin in 1913—the last execution in Queensland. A new prison was built around the perimeter of No. 1 prison during the 1960s and No. 1 prison was demolished leaving area for an oval and recreational facilities for the newly built prison, which had running cold water and toilet facilities in all cells. Under the oval was the facility that became known as the &quot;black hole&quot; where prisoners were subjected to &quot;punishment&quot;. The &quot;black hole&quot; continued in use until the late 1980s. A new women&#x27;s gaol was also built at this time. The gaol was originally designed to cater for 40 male prisoners serving as a holding place for prisoners heading to St Helena Island in Moreton Bay. However, by 1989 there were 187 male prisoners and the women&#x27;s facility had around 200 additional prisoners.

Protests at the gaol during the 1970s saw inmates undertake hunger strikes, roof-top protests, and rioting over the poor conditions and treatment. The prison was constantly in the headlines and became notorious around Australia. Cells in the No. 2 prison did not have any form of sanitation, and facilities for washing were lacking. Prisoners were required to use a bucket through the evening for toilet breaks and empty it, or &quot;slop out&quot;, in the morning. A Queensland Government inquiry into the living conditions of State prisons found Boggo Road to be outdated and inadequate for prisoners&#x27; needs. No. 2 Division was closed in 1989. No. 1 division was closed in 1992 and was demolished in 1996 (a small section of what was &quot;C5&quot; and guard tower still remain). The women&#x27;s prison operated until 2000 and was demolished in 2006.

Since 1992, the No. 2 Division was home to the Boggo Road Gaol Museum, which featured displays of prison-related artefacts. Throughout the 1990s, ex-officers conducted guided tours of the site, and from 2003 the museum and tours were operated by the Boggo Road Gaol Historical Society, a non-profit incorporated association of volunteers. From 2012-20, Boggo Road Gaol was a tourist attraction with guided tours being conducted by Boggo Road Gaol Pty. Like many other similar places around the country, the site also hosts guided ghost tours.

In 1993, Boggo Road Gaol hosted the concert &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;, which included bands such as Divinyls, Rose Tattoo, Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs, Spy Vs Spy and Powderfinger.

Redevelopment of the surrounding site began in 2006, leading to the temporary closure of the Boggo Road Gaol historical site. Since 2012 the gaol has been re-opened to the public. Boggo Road has since been turned into an urban village called Boggo Road Urban Village and was completed in 2010.

<text>Ms. Tree is a comic book series named for its lead character, co-created by writer Max Allan Collins and artist Terry Beatty. Her name is a paronomasia, or play on words, of the term &quot;Mystery&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
The title character is Michael Tree, a female private detective who takes over her husband&#x27;s investigation business when he is murdered. In her first case, she captures the murderer and discovers his link to the Muerta organized crime family.

Ms. Tree&#x27;s dead husband was named Michael Tree, the joke being that after the marriage they had the same name. The female main character&#x27;s real first name actually is Michael; when friends want to irritate her they deliberately mispronounce it as &quot;Michelle&quot;. Series creator/writer Max Allan Collins makes no secret of the fact that Ms. Tree was inspired by Velda, Mike Hammer&#x27;s secretary, a stacked, gun carrying, six-foot tall brunette and Mike&#x27;s lover, who was almost as tough as he was. The basic premise of &quot;Ms. Tree&quot; was, &quot;What if Velda and Mike Hammer eventually got married, and on their honeymoon he was murdered?&quot;

Throughout the series, in addition to isolated cases that often touch on social issues of the day, Ms. Tree&#x27;s vendetta against the Muerta family is a major plot thread. Her methods often include deadly violence, which she uses with little hesitation. In contrast to genre conventions, she faces serious consequences throughout the series for these violent actions including arrest, imprisonment, commitment to a mental hospital, and involuntary medication.

In another genre divergence, the male Michael Tree&#x27;s son, Mike Jr., inadvertently falls in love with the daughter of the Muerta matron. The female Michael disapproves of this arrangement, but respects her stepson&#x27;s decision while observing with amusement the Muerta matron&#x27;s futile attempts to discourage it. To Ms. Tree&#x27;s shock, when the relationship grows enough to make marriage probable, the Muerta family decides Mike&#x27;s stepmother is now family and initiates a reconciliation with her while going legit.

In addition, Michael is impregnated by an old flame who is manipulating her to kill his wife. She decides to keep the baby, creating a unique series of adventures of this homicidal PI fighting off criminals even while dealing with a full term pregnancy, while the mob family she hates moves to protect her in their own way.

==Hard Case Crime==
In 2007, Hard Case Crime published &quot;Deadly Beloved&quot;, the first novel about Ms. Tree and the character&#x27;s first appearance in 14 years. The book was written by Max Allan Collins, with a painted cover by Ms. Tree co-creator Terry Beatty. Hard Case Crime also published the complete Ms. Tree comic collection into graphic novel format for Titan Comics.

==Production==
Ms. Tree&#x27;s adventures were published by four different comic book companies including Eclipse Comics, Aardvark-Vanaheim, Renegade Press, and finally DC Comics.

Her introduction and first storyline appeared in the first six issues of &quot;Eclipse Magazine&quot;, a newsstand-magazine-sized, black-and-white anthology title; shortly thereafter Eclipse began featuring the character in her own, regularly sized comic book. The first three issues of the Eclipse Comics series were titled &quot;Ms. Tree&#x27;s Thrilling Detective Adventures&quot;. This was shortened to &quot;Ms. Tree&quot; with issue #4.

Most storylines were multi-issue affairs. A notable exception was DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Ms. Tree Quarterly&quot; (renamed &quot;Ms. Tree Special&quot; for its last two issues) which was comic-sized but much thicker than a typical comic book, with a much higher page count, and presented a full-color, complete Ms. Tree story in every issue.

In 2019, Titan Comics began publication of a trade paperback collection of five &quot;Ms. Tree&quot; stories, which also included the &quot;rare Ms. Tree prose story&quot; &quot;Inconvenience Store&quot;. The 264-page volume was released on July 17 the same year.

<text>Edward Gresham Ball (March 21, 1888 – June 24, 1981) was a businessman who wielded powerful political influence in Florida for decades. Referred to as &quot;a law unto himself&quot;, despite the fact that he never held public office and did not own much of the assets he controlled, he led a forest products company, a railroad and owned newspapers. He worked for and with his brother-in-law Alfred I. du Pont for nine years before running the Alfred I. duPont Testamentary Trust&#x27;s businesses himself for another 46 years. He founded and led the St. Joe Paper Company to become a major player in several industries in Florida. He was a leader of the anti-communist Pork Chop Gang, a group of Democratic Party legislators from North Florida.

==Early years==
Edward Ball was born at Ball&#x27;s Neck near Kilmarnock in Northumberland County, Virginia and educated in the one-room Shiloh Schoolhouse. After completing primary school, he convinced his father to let him quit school and get a job. He had always been obsessed with making money; at one time, he prospected for gold in Alaska. However, when Ball&#x27;s older sister, Jessie Ball became the third wife of Alfred I. du Pont in 1921, Edward was given the chance of a lifetime. He began working for his brother-in-law in 1923 at the lofty salary of $5,000 a year, and moved to Delaware where he was publicly named manager of the Clean Food Products Company. Privately, he was Mr. du Pont&#x27;s confidential business partner and became a shrewd financier and caretaker of the du Pont de Nemours estate fortune. After Jessie &amp; Alfred moved to Florida in 1926, Edward joined them.

==du Pont&#x27;s death==
When Alfred died in 1935, his estate was valued at over $56 million, which, after estate taxes of $30 million, left $26 million. Alfred&#x27;s will named Jessie as the principal trustee, but in reality, she deferred business decisions to her brother, Edward, who took control of the assets of the testamentary trusts, which included large Florida landholdings and industrial interests, including the Florida East Coast Railway. Jessie preferred to handle the philanthropic activities of the trust while Edward concentrated on making money.

==Power==
Ball had no interest in running for office and little desire for material things; for most of his life, he didn&#x27;t even own an automobile. Ball used various means to acquire enormous unofficial political power in Florida. He amassed a wide network of connections, and was the key figure in a group of 20 rural, conservative, north Florida politicians that controlled Florida from the 1930s to the 1960s called the Pork Chop Gang that spawned Florida&#x27;s version of McCarthyism. Their public spokesman was Florida Senate President Charley Eugene Johns from Starke. The coalition supported racial segregation (which was practiced at the St. Joe Paper Mill) and was known for toasting &quot;Confusion to the Enemy!&quot; with Jack Daniel&#x27;s whiskey.

Ball rarely, if ever, took a public role in politics. With control over the vast du Pont business empire, he exerted political influence through his Florida banking empire, his ownership of numerous Florida newspapers, and by funneling unregulated and unreported cash to political operatives. Ball did not need to get his hands dirty or risk personal resources. Ball was a main (but not the only) financer of the defeat of Claude Pepper in his bid for reelection to the United States Senate in 1950. Pepper&#x27;s liberalism and Ball&#x27;s conservatism feuded through much of the 1940s and 1950s, prompting a book to be written in 2000: &quot;Claude Pepper and Ed Ball: Politics, Purpose, and Power&quot;.

According to a 1979 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Edward Ball at various times was called a Robber Baron and a political power broker; a clever man with a dollar and a dangerous man to cross; a courtly Virginian with the ladies and a ruthless foe. He is known for &quot;orneriness&quot; but insists his reputation is undeserved; he claims he was just a trusted functionary who did his best for the institution he served. Critics say he hijacked the trust as a tool of his personal power, treating the assets like a miser hoarding every coin. He had the reputation of a &quot;tart-tongued, hard-nosed conservative financier&quot;.

==Personal life==
By all accounts, Edward Ball took little time for a personal life. Early on, he travelled constantly, scouting for possible acquisitions and checking up on existing assets.

===Marriage===
Ball married in 1933, but the union did not last. He approached marriage like a business deal and wanted everything in writing. The prenuptial agreement had 19 provisions which described the couple&#x27;s wedded lifestyle and included a definition of &quot;nagging&quot;. Ball wanted children, but his wife was unable to get pregnant due to reproductive problems several years before their wedding. Ruth Ball filed for divorce in 1943, but Edward Ball sought an annulment, unsuccessfully appealing it all the way to the Florida Supreme Court. He finally agreed to pay his ex-wife $250,000 alimony in 1949.

===Habits===
In an interview, Ball said, &quot;I suppose some people might call me tight with a dollar.&quot; The stories of Ball&#x27;s frugal nature border on the legendary. Ed Ball owned a country estate called Southwood Farm outside of Tallahassee, but for years lived in a hotel room at the Robert Meyer Hotel across the street from his office in the Florida National Bank Building in Jacksonville. This was the site of a 5:30 weekday ritual for Mr. Ball, his business associates and buddies. Cocktails began when &quot;everyone&quot; was present, and lasted until the network news began at 6:00 pm, at which time all conversation and movement ceased. Ed Ball took his news seriously. After the news concluded, the group moved to the River Club for dinner.

==Banking==
Alfred du Pont acquired a major interest in Florida National Bank (founded 1905) of Jacksonville shortly after arriving in Florida in the mid-1920s. Other banks were gradually added into what became the Florida National Group, which was one of the strongest banks in the state. In size, the branches eventually numbered 185, second only to Barnett Bank.

Ball built the Florida National Bank building at 214 North Hogan Street in Jacksonville in 1961. The structure was eleven stories tall and contained the corporate offices for the bank. Ed Ball also kept his principal office there for managing the du Pont Trust. After Ball&#x27;s death, the structure was renamed the Ed Ball Building.

On March 7, 1989, First Union Corporation, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, announced that it would acquire Florida National Banks in a deal worth $849 million. The transaction occurred the following year.

==Paper Mill==
In anticipation of increased trade through the Panama Canal, the Apalachicola Northern Railroad was built from Chattahoochee to Port St. Joe in 1910 with plans to load large ships with goods to be taken through the canal, advertised as the “Panama Route”. When the depression hit, business dropped off and the railroad was in bad shape financially. Alfred I. DuPont purchased the struggling railroad in 1933 and created the St. Joe Paper Company. Dupont drew up elaborate plans for the development of his mill town as “The Model City of the South”, and then died. Ed Ball took control of the company in 1935 but never acted on the master city plan.

Construction began in 1936 and from 1938 to 1996, the company operated a paper mill at Port St. Joe, Florida. 
The company invigorated the local economy following the depression, employing thousands and paying good wages, but wreaked havoc on the environment. The mill released sulfurous exhaust and dioxin, a byproduct of the paper bleaching process that is a carcinogen. By the 1950s, the company was drawing of water a day from the Floridan aquifer, seriously depleting the water table. St. Joe Paper also clear-cut millions of acres of old growth forest, engaging in silviculture to replant the areas with slash pine. The practice decimated the native longleaf pine stands, reducing the species to &quot;2 percent of its former range.&quot; Because of this, the United States Department of the Interior designated parts of the region a &quot;Critically Endangered Ecosystem&quot;.

Under Ball, the company also kept workers at the mill racially segregated.

Ball continued the trust&#x27;s aggressive land purchases throughout the 1940s and 1950s, sometimes for &quot;mere dollars an acre&quot; and landholdings reached . Most of the land was situated between Tallahassee and Pensacola, but there was substantial acreage in southern Georgia. The paper mill was most profitable in the 1960s, with products being directly marketed to company-owned box plants.

==Wakulla Springs Lodge==
Wakulla Springs is one of the deepest and largest freshwater springs in the world.
Ball purchased surrounding Wakulla Springs in 1937 and constructed the Wakulla Springs Lodge as a guest house. He imported marble and tile and hired craftsmen and artisans who built everything needed for the lodge on-site. Blacksmiths, millwrights, masons, stone cutters, painters, and artists created an elegant retreat using iron and stone; the high ceilings were painted with murals. There are 27 unique guestrooms, each with a voluminous marble bathroom, walk-in closet, and antique or period furniture.

Ball dynamited parts of the Wakulla River to open the way for boats bringing his guests to the springs, then fenced off the water passage to keep out the &quot;riff-raff&quot;.

At the time the Lodge was built no telephone service was available in Wakulla County, so Ball ran a line through the forest from his base in distant (89 miles) Port St. Joe.

In the mid-1960s, he donated land to Florida State University for a marine laboratory, which was completed in 1968 and named in his honor. Ball then sold the remaining land surrounding Wakulla Springs to the state of Florida, who created Edward Ball Wakulla Springs State Park.

==Railroads==
The Stock Market Crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression were particularly hard on the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC). The railroad declared bankruptcy and was in receivership by September 1931, just 18 years after Henry Morrison Flagler&#x27;s death. Bus service began to be substituted for trains on the branches in 1932, and the Key West Extension was abandoned after the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935. However, streamliners terminating in Miami nevertheless plied the rails between 1939 and 1968, including such famous trains as &quot;The Champion&quot; and &quot;The Florida Special&quot; jointly operated with the Atlantic Coast Line. Adding to the woes was the Cuban embargo, thus reducing a significant portion of FEC&#x27;s revenue.

In 1961, Ball purchased a majority ownership of FEC for the DuPont Trusts, allowing the FEC to emerge from bankruptcy. That same year, a labor contract negotiation turned sour, leading to a prolonged work stoppage by non-operating unions beginning January 23, 1963, and whose picket lines were honored by the operating unions (the train crews).

Arguably the most noteworthy chapter in Ball&#x27;s business career was his battle against the railroad unions in the Florida East Coast Railway strike of 1963 to 1977. In order to try to save the railroad from its three decades-long state of bankruptcy, which if allowed to continue would have threatened the railroad with physical deterioration and even partial abandonment, Ball fought for the company&#x27;s right to engage in its own contract negotiations with the railroad unions rather than accept an industrywide settlement that Ball thought would include featherbedding and wasteful work rules. His use of replacement workers to keep the railroad running during the strike led to violence by strikers that included shootings and bombings. Eventually, Federal intervention helped quell the violence, and the railroad&#x27;s right to operate during the strike with replacement workers was affirmed by the United States Supreme Court. As the strike continued, the Florida East Coast took numerous steps to improve its physical plant, install various forms of automation, and drastically cut labor costs, all to an extent that most other railroads would not succeed in matching until years later. Ball therefore was a pioneer in the American railroad industry&#x27;s struggle, beginning in the 1960s, to improve its economic efficiency.

Ball&#x27;s tenure saw the permanent end of FEC&#x27;s passenger service. The FEC was forced to resume carrying passengers two years after the strike began, when the courts ruled the FEC corporate charter mandated that the railroad carry passengers as well as freight. In response, Ball instituted a bare-bones passenger service with only a box lunch for food and no baggage, which lasted until 1968.

==Jessie&#x27;s death==
After his sister died in 1970, Ball came under strong criticism for reinvesting the trust&#x27;s income to build up their value instead of fully respecting the requirements of du Pont&#x27;s will, which stipulated that after Jessie Ball du Pont&#x27;s death, trust income was to be used to aid the Nemours Foundation in caring for crippled children and indigent elderly in Delaware. Ball ignored the criticism, but he couldn&#x27;t ignore the wave of lawsuits that were brought by other trustees, the State of Delaware and others.

==Biographies==
In 1976, Raymond K. Mason collaborated with Virginia Harrison to author a book about the life of Edward Ball, &quot;Confusion to the enemy : a biography of Edward Ball&quot;. This book was the &quot;authorized&quot; biography, whereas the book, &quot;Ed Ball, confusion to the enemy&quot; by Leon Odell Griffith, published the previous year, was done by an outsider. Both were published prior to Ball&#x27;s death.

==Death==
Ed Ball&#x27;s favorite euphemism for death was &quot;going across the creek&quot;, a reference he learned from Alfred du Pont. Three sides of the DuPont gunpowder mills were made of stone; the side closest to the creek with the water wheel was built of wood. If the powder accidentally exploded, the wooden wall acted as a safety valve so whole building would not collapse on the men inside. Unfortunately, if you were between the explosion and the wooden wall, you would be 
blown &quot;across the creek&quot; and probably die.
In a New York Times interview two years before his passing, he said that his life had been long and the critics be damned; he lived it the best way he could.

&quot;When I go across the creek, it will be because I can&#x27;t help myself or can&#x27;t work any longer.&quot; Shortly before his death, he said, &quot;I waited until I was too old to decide what to do with my own personal assets and have decided that I worked most of my business life managing the duPont estate.&quot;

Ball said he was very proud of what duPont had established in the Nemours Foundation, and upon his death, save a few minor bequests, he left his entire estate to the Foundation, with one stipulation – his bequest could be used in Florida only.&quot;

Ball died at the Ochsner Foundation Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana, on June 24, 1981, from cardio-pulmonary disease and kidney failure; he had a history of heart problems and had suffered four previous heart attacks. When he died, the value of the du Pont trust had ballooned to $2 billion. His late sister&#x27;s foundation, the Jessie Ball duPont Fund, had assets of $75 million. Ball&#x27;s own estate was estimated to be worth $75–200 million.

<doc id="1217699" wikidata="Q2854549" url="?curid=1217699" title="Edwards's pheasant">
<text>Edwards&#x27;s pheasant (Lophura edwardsi) is a bird of the pheasant family Phasianidae and is endemic to the seasonal tropical forests of central Vietnam. It is named after the French ornithologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards and first described to science in 1896. The bird&#x27;s length is and has red legs and facial skin. The male is mainly blue-black with a crest, and the female is a drab brown bird. The alarm call is a &quot;puk!-puk!-puk!&quot;.

There are two varieties; the nominate form &quot;L. e. edwardsi&quot; has a white crest and upper tail, whereas the northern form, usually called Vietnamese pheasant, is found with a variable number of white rectrices. This difference in the two forms may be due to inbreeding of a restricted, fragmented population there, and has also been seen in captive, inbred &quot;L. edwardsi&quot;.

In 2012 the nominate form of Edwards&#x27;s pheasant have been uplisted to Critically Endangered by BirdLife International, having suffered from deforestation, hunting and the use of defoliants during the Vietnam War. The population is currently believed to number between 50 and 249 birds in the wild, mostly of the nominate form, but it is doing well in captivity, where it is the subject of &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation. There have been no confirmed sightings of a living individual in the wild since 2000 and in 2010 the World Pheasant Association (WPA) received funding from the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund to survey forests in the central Vietnam provinces of Quảng Bình and Quảng Trị. It is considered possibly extinct in the wild as a result.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
Edwards&#x27;s pheasant was first observed in 1896. Twenty-eight years later, another species of Lophura, the Imperial pheasant (&quot;Lophura imperialis&quot;), was seen in the border area between Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces. It was later proven to be a crossbreed between the Edwards&#x27;s pheasant and the Silver pheasant (&quot;Lophura nycthemera&quot;). &quot;Lophura hatinhensis&quot; is considered a variant of &quot;Lophura edwardsi&quot;.

== Description ==
Edwards pheasants have a body length of 58-65 cm, including the tail length, which is about 24-26 cm for males, and 20-22 cm for females. Males are heavier, with a weight between 1115-1100 g, and females around 1050 g. Males are all black, with a blue tint throughout their feathers. Females are generally chestnut-brown with no crest.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Edwards&#x27;s pheasant is endemic to central Vietnam and has been found in four provinces (Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien Hue). They live in evergreen forests with lots of palms and patches of bamboo. The birds often hide in the low vegetation, and females dig their nests in the grounds of these forests. Edward&#x27;s pheasants do not commonly migrate because they are not affected by cold weather and can spend most winters outside.

== Ecology ==

=== Song and call ===
Male birds have a wing-whirring sound. Their alarm call is a low guttural &quot;uk uk uk uk uk&quot;, sometimes a hard &quot;puk puk puk puk puk&quot;.

=== Diet ===
Edward&#x27;s pheasants have rarely been observed in the wild, so little is known about its behavior in its natural habitat.

An Edwards&#x27;s pheasant at Denver Zoo’s diet consists of mealworms, chopped fruit, and greens, specially formulated game bird diet.

=== Reproduction ===
Edward&#x27;s pheasants usually breed between the months of March and May. Males push their chests, vibrate their wings, and erect the feathers on their backs to find their mate. Females can begin to breed after two years, while their maximum fertility is usually around ages 4-5. On average, females lay between 4-7 eggs each time. The females make the nests well hidden and dug into the group, usually with plant debris and bamboo overtop. The female incubates eggs for around 20-22 days. However, the male remains stationed close to guard the bird. The eggs are round and have a faint pink color with dotted cream spots. Juveniles are primarily chestnut-brown.

== Conservation status and management ==
&quot;Lophura edwardsi&quot; was assessed for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2018 and listed as Critically Endangered. It is one of the most endangered species of &quot;Galliformes.&quot; Their population is decreasing, with 50-249 mature individuals right now, according to IUCN Red List. Any remaining subpopulations are likely to be extremely small and declining. They have not been spotted in the wild since the year 2000. Intense hunting and trapping, habitat loss due to herbicide spraying during the Vietnam War, logging, and clearance for agriculture has significantly affected the population of this species. Khe Nuoc Trong, Bac Huong Hoa, Phong Dien, and Ke Go are reserves where these birds could reside. An Action Plan was published for this species in 2015.

The Phong Điền Nature Reserve was initially designated to protect the Edward&#x27;s pheasant after the rediscovery of the species in the area in 1996. In 2018, a photograph of a dead female Edwards&#x27;s pheasant was taken in A Lưới District, which includes part of Phong Điền; this marked the first evidence of a wild Edwards&#x27;s pheasant in almost two decades, and indicates that the species may still persist in the reserve.

<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives,  represents the wheel arrangement of no leading wheels, ten powered and coupled driving wheels on five axles and no trailing wheels. In the United Kingdom, this type is known as a Decapod, a name which is applied to types in the United States. In the United States, the type is known as ten-coupled.

==Overview==
The lack of leading and trailing wheels makes this wheel arrangement unstable at speed, and it is a type usually confined to fairly low-speed work, such as switching (shunting), transfer runs, slow-speed drag freight, or running over mountainous terrain.

The Russian E class was the most numerous single class of locomotive in the world, with around 11,000 manufactured.

==Usage==

===Austria===

In 1899, Karl Gölsdorf introduced his famous 180.00 class for the Austrian State Railway, an 0-10-0 for mountain regions which had a remarkably low axle load. It employed the Gölsdorf axle system and had the drive, unusually, on the fourth axle. The class existed both as simple expansion and as two-cylinder compound engines, and they later worked in Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Romania and France.

===Canada===
Three 0-10-0 locomotives were owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway.

===China===
Sixteen narrow gauge 0-10-0 locomotives, built by Baldwin Locomotive Works from 1924 to 1929, remained operational on the Yunnan-Kopei Railway until 1990.

===Finland===

The VR Class Vr3 0-10-0T was numbered in the range from 752 to 756 and nicknamed &quot;Rooster&quot;. The first locomotive was ordered in 1924 from Hanomag in Germany. No. 755 is stored at the Finnish Railway Museum.

===Germany===
The 0-10-0 type proved popular in Germany. Several types of freight tender locomotives of this arrangement were built between approximately 1905 and 1915, after which the wheel arrangement was abandoned in favor of the 2-10-0. Subsequent German locomotives of this type were tank locomotives, including classes BR82, BR87, BR940, BR941, BR942-4, BR945-17, BR9419-21 and BR975.

===Indonesia===

The &quot;Staatspoorwegen ter Sumatara&#x27;s Westkust&quot; (SSS) built a railway line on the west coast of Sumatra from 1887 until 1896. This railway used to haul products from Ombilin coal mines to the port of Teluk Bayur in Padang. Severe terrain with 8% grades required a locomotive with great power. The E10 was a rack tank steam locomotive employed in West Sumatra, of which 22 were built from 1921 to 1928 by Esslingen in Germany and SLM (Schweizerische Lokomotiv-und Maschinenfabrik) in Switzerland. The E10 has four cylinders, with two cylinders dedicated to drive the rack gears.

The class E10 eventually consisted of 39 locomotives, of which the last seven engines were built in 1967 by Nippon Sharyo, the last steam locomotives to be built by that firm. The class was used in regular service until the mid-1980s.

===Japan===

Four 4100 class 0-10-0T locomotives, numbered from 4100 to 4103 and built by Krauss-Maffei in Germany, were imported to Japan in 1912. Based on this design, a total of 39 4110 Class 0-10-0T locomotives, numbered from 4110 to 4148, were built in Japan in 1914 and 1917.

The last members of the class were withdrawn from service on JNR in 1950, but some were sold to private freight railways and remained in service as late as 1971. Four of the locomotives were sent to the Korean Peninsula in 1938, but their subsequent fate is unknown.

===Russia===

The 0-10-0 type was the principal standard freight locomotive in Russia and was manufactured in very large numbers. The E class (Cyrillic Э, not to be confused with Е-class), freight locomotive was made up of several sub-classes, all developed from the same original basic machine. The sub-classes included E, Em, , Esh, Eu, and Er.
A number of both the Em and class received condensing tenders for working in areas where water supplies were scarce. These were designated Emk and Egk class respectively. However, these locomotives were experimental and the condensing tender was mainly used on the 2-10-0 SO19-series locomotive.

The E class was the most numerous single class of locomotive in the world, with around 11,000 manufactured in Russia and other countries such as Czechoslovakia, Germany, Sweden, Hungary and Poland. This class even far outnumbered the German DRB Class 52 2-10-0 Kriegslok. The class was eventually superseded by the SO class which can be considered a further development of the E class, the L class and the FD class . Despite being superseded, it was not replaced, and the class was widely used until the end of steam in Russia.

===South West Africa===

In 1911, the &quot;Lüderitzbucht Eisenbahn&quot; (Lüderitzbucht Railway) in German South West Africa () placed six Decapod locomotives in service, built in 1910 by Henschel &amp; Son for a French colony in Africa. The engines were rejected by French inspectors, however, and they were purchased by the German government for £2,000 each in 1911, on behalf of the &quot;Lüderitzbucht-Gesellschaft&quot; company who leased the &quot;Lüderitzbucht Eisenbahn&quot; and shared the profits with the government.

To protect the motion from wind-blown sand in the Namib Desert, it had plate shields arranged along the full length of the engine, hinged on the running board to allow access to the motion. The locomotives were placed in service on the &quot;Südbahn&quot; line from Lüderitzbucht via Seeheim to Kalkfontein, where they formed the mainstay of motive power. None of these engines survived the First World War.

===Taiwan===
A steam locomotive of this form served the sole purpose of pushing passengers up to the highest altitude station, 勝興 (Shengxing), in Taiwan.

===Thailand===
Two Hanomag 0-10-0 steam Locomotives, numbers 401 and 402, were imported from Germany in 1913 for service in Siam and were used on standard gauge. In 1924 they were regauged to metre gauge.

===United Kingdom===

Only two 0-10-0 locomotives saw service on British railways. One was a suburban tank locomotive prototype, built by James Holden for the Great Eastern Railway in 1902 and called the Decapod. The other was a tender locomotive, No. 2290, built by the Midland Railway in 1919, specifically for use as a banker for the Lickey Incline.

===United States===

The 0-10-0 was not very popular in the United States and North America in general and probably fewer than seventy of this type were constructed. For switching work, large locomotives were preferred, and when more than four driven axles were required, the preference was for articulated locomotives such as 0-6-6-0 and 0-8-8-0 Mallet engines. On mainlines, a with the added stability of its leading truck, or a 2-10-2 or 2-10-4 with room for larger fireboxes, were preferred.

The first 0-10-0 in the United States was built to provide service on Madison Hill which, at 5.89%, has the steepest standard gauge grade in the country. It was a tank locomotive, designed in 1868 by Reuben Wells for the Jeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad and named for its designer. The &quot;Reuben Wells&quot; is on display at the Children&#x27;s Museum of Indianapolis. It is long and weighs 55 tons.
Later 0-10-0 versions were delivered in 1891 to the St. Clair Tunnel Company to haul trains between Sarnia, Ontario and Port Huron, Michigan. The next were a series of 21 locomotives for New York Central Railroad and its subsidiaries for hump yard work. Others included seven owned by Illinois Central Railroad, fifteen by Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, two by Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and four, the heaviest built, for Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway.

<text>Cadell Training Centre is an Australian minimum security prison located in Cadell, South Australia, approximately 180 km north-east of Adelaide and 10 km from the town of Morgan. Named for the town of Cadell which is itself named after Captain Francis Cadell, who was the navigator on Charles Sturt’s successful exploration of the Murray River. The prison was officially opened on Tuesday 31 May 1960 by the Chief Secretary of South Australia, the Honourable Sir Lyell McEwin.
The Cadell Training Centre is a publicly run institution situated on approximately of land in a rural environment with a focus on Dairy farming, citrus and olives. Originally built to hold 140 low security inmates who have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment of at least six months or longer it has since been expanded to hold 167 prisoners, then further expanded in 2014 and 2015 to 193 and 206 respectively. Accommodation for inmates consists of a cellblock, a dormitory and cottages. The cottages are rated drug-free and house 50% of the prison population. The centre does not have a secure perimeter fence with prisoners remaining under their own trust.

The centre lists its main function as having a major restorative justice focus. This includes programs to help inmates obtain driving licences for various commercial vehicles and certificates in Horticulture, dairy production and Commercial Cookery. Prisoners also perform community service work in neighbouring towns and the Cadell Fire Brigade is operated by prisoners and staff with the vehicles housed within the prison grounds.

The centre also operates a specialist program targeting young men who have had limited exposure to the adult prison system, and another program that targets young offenders with drug and alcohol problems. Cadell also receives prisoners who are nearing the end of their sentences from high security prisons that are deemed suitable. Prisoners must be rated by the Department for Correctional Services as Low Security (approximately 18% of the South Australia Prisoner population) to be eligible to serve their sentence at Cadell.

<text>Quiddler is a card game and word game created by Set Enterprises. Players compete by spelling English words from cards in hands of increasing size, each card worth various points. The game combines aspects of &quot;Scrabble&quot; and gin rummy. The word &quot;Quiddler&quot; is a trademark.

==Play and scoring==
===Game play=== 
Before play begins, all the cards are shuffled. A game of &quot;Quiddler&quot; consists of eight rounds; the first round has a three-card hand, the second round has a four-card hand, and so on until the game ends with a ten-card hand. While there is a single-player variation, the regular game requires at least two players.

In the first round, the dealer deals out three cards to each player. The remaining cards form a draw pile. The top card is turned over to start a discard pile. The player to the dealer&#x27;s left goes first. The player may choose the top card from either the draw pile (card is face down) or the discard pile (card is face up). The player adds this card to their hand. The player ends their turn by discarding one card from their hand so that the player ends up with the same number of cards as were dealt. A player may not use a dictionary during their turn, but the other players may. Turns are taken in the same manner in a clockwise rotation among the players. The round continues until one player can go out.

A player can go out if they can use all the cards in their hand to spell one or more allowable words. After a player goes out, every other player then has one more turn. On the last turn, each remaining player uses as many cards as possible to spell one or more allowable words.

After the round is finished, points on the cards used to spell words are counted toward the player&#x27;s score. If the player had unused cards, the points on those remaining cards are subtracted. Ten-point bonuses are added to the score of the player with the longest word and to the player with the most words (if there are only two players, they should decide between them to limit the bonus to either the longest word or the most words).

The subsequent rounds follow in the same manner, with the hands increasing in size by one card each round. Thus, in the second round each player is dealt four cards, the third round five cards, and so forth. Points are added at the end of each round. The game continues until the end of the eighth round (ten cards in the hand). Depending on the number of players, the discard pile may need to be shuffled to resupply the draw pile.

The player with the most points at the end of the full eight rounds wins.

===Allowable words===

Players should decide on an English dictionary to be used during the game. An allowable word must appear as an entry in that dictionary or as one of the listed inflected forms of an entry word. Words must also use at least two cards. The makers of &quot;Quiddler&quot; have established several restrictions on the words used in a game. No proper nouns may be used. Capitalized adjectives, such as &quot;Iraqi&quot; and &quot;Scottish&quot;, may be used. Prefixes and suffixes by themselves are not allowable words. Words requiring a hyphen for proper spelling, such as &quot;ex-wife&quot; and &quot;twenty-two&quot; are also not allowed. The &quot;Quiddler&quot; rules disallow abbreviations, but do not differentiate between various forms. Players need to decide for themselves (or follow the example of the game dictionary) if they will allow acronym-derived words such as &quot;laser&quot; and &quot;NATO&quot;. The rules contain no restrictions on English words with accented letters, such as née, though the deck contains no such letters. Players must also decide for themselves if they will allow shortened word forms such as &quot;ad&quot; (for &quot;advertisement&quot;) and &quot;math&quot;.

A player may challenge any other player if they feel that the latter has used a word that is not an allowable word. If the word is an allowable word, the challenging player must subtract from their score the number of points in the word. If it is not, the challenged player must subtract from their score the number of points in the word. The challenged player may not re-arrange their cards to form other words.

==Deck==
The card deck consists of 118 cards with individual letters from the English alphabet or common two-letter combinations. These include QU, IN, ER, TH, and CL. Each card has a point value reflecting its use in English words. The colorful and stylistic designs on the cards are based on illuminated letters found in Celtic manuscripts written over 1000 years ago. These source inspirations include the Book of Kells and the Book of Durrow.

==Degrees of competition==
In a similar vein to &quot;Scrabble&quot;, groups can play &quot;Quiddler&quot; with varying degrees of competition. Players in highly competitive games may consider memorizing lists of two- and three-letter words. It is also a good idea to know whether the game dictionary includes colloquial and contemporary words.

<doc id="1217742" wikidata="Q506646" url="?curid=1217742" title="Pailin province">
<text>Pailin (, ) is a province in western Cambodia at the northern edge of the Cardamom Mountains near the border of Thailand. This province is surrounded by Battambang province, and was officially carved out of Battambang to become a separate administrative division after the surrender of the Ieng Sary faction of the Khmer Rouge in 1996. Pailin is known to much of the world for having long been a stronghold of the Khmer Rouge, remaining under their control long after they were defeated in 1979 and serving from 1994 to 1998 as the capital of the Provisional Government of National Union and National Salvation of Cambodia. Within Cambodia, Pailin is known for its natural resources, namely precious gems and timber.

Once a part of the powerful Khmer Empire, Pailin was conquered in 1558 by the Burmese under Bayinnaung and later ruled by the Siamese (Thai) until 1907 and from 1941 to 1946 when it was returned to Cambodia. It was known to the Thai as &quot;Phailin&quot; (, ). There is still a vibrant border crossing point in Pailin. On 22 December 2008, King Norodom Sihamoni signed a Royal Decree that changed the municipalities of Kep, Pailin and Sihanoukville into provinces, as well as adjusting several provincial borders.

==History==
Pailin City (Krong Pailin) was founded under the Khmer Empire where it existed as an important trading centre. It continued its role as a centre of trade and commerce under French colonial rule which saw the establishment of French-operated stores and plantations. During the late 1800s, the area saw an influx of immigrants from Burma who became the Kula people. The Kula settled around Pailin and established structures whose architecture was based on the architecture of Burma.

=== Cambodian Conflict ===
In the early 1970s, Pailin was a prosperous town stemming from the extensive gem deposits in the surrounding countryside. Because of its resources, it was one of the first cities invaded by the Khmer Rouge when they began their major offensive against the Khmer Republic government. The city offered no resistance and the Khmer Rouge soldiers were greeted as liberators as they marched into town. At this point, the deposed prince Norodom Sihanouk had allied himself with the Khmer Rouge and most residents believed that they were fighting to restore him to power. It was not long though before most residents were rounded up for a forced march to the countryside to work in rice paddies. Those believed to have connections to the government were killed. The Khmer Rouge used proceeds from mining in the Pailin area to fund their offensive and later their government once they gained national power. When the invading People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam ousted them from power, they retreated to Pailin, where many former Khmer Rouge leaders remain today. It was the capital of the Provisional Government of National Union and National Salvation of Cambodia.

=== Post-Khmer Rouge ===
Some leaders went into hiding in fear of punishment for their crimes, although other leaders lived openly in the province. As of September 2007, Pailin&#x27;s remaining Khmer Rouge leaders were being rounded up to face justice by an international tribunal, including Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea.

Since the war, Pailin suffered an economic decline and failures of local businesses. However, the now politically stable area is seeing a new wave of tourism focused on its ancient temples, natural forests and wildlife, and especially the precious gem market.

==Government==
Until 2001, Pailin was part of Battambang Province, then elevated to city/municipal status, and then again to provincial status and thus became an autonomous zone of its own.

The current governor of Pailin province is Ban Sreymom, appointed by royal decree on 18 December 2020. Sreymom is a member of the ruling Cambodian People&#x27;s Party and previously represented Pailin constituency in the National Assembly. She is the second woman in Cambodian history to serve as a provincial governor.

When Khmer Rouge forces surrendered in the late 1990s, the Cambodian government headed by Hun Sen allowed former members to manage modern-day Pailin as a special administrative area to facilitate and maintain peace.

=== Administrative divisions ===
The province is divided into 1 municipality and 1 district, further divided into 8 communes.
== Demographics ==
According to the National Institute of Statistics of the Ministry of Planning, the total population of the province in 2013 was 65,792 which grew to 67,166 in 2014. In the latest census conducted in 2019, the province&#x27;s population was at 71,600. Between 1998 and 2008, Pailin had the largest annual growth rate of any province in Cambodia at 11.2%. It then became one of the smallest, with annual growth rate between 2008 and 2019 being at 0.1%.

== Economy ==

The surrounding area was rich in a variety of gemstones which were mined almost clean to support the Khmer Rouge. They also logged the area extensively, creating great environmental damage. Now all you can find is low-quality, cheap, hand-faceted gemstones at the market in downtown Pailin.

Traders in Pailin will accept Cambodian riels, US dollars, and Thai baht; US dollars are preferred.
=== Agriculture ===
Unlike in most of Cambodia, Pailin is composed primarily of uplands where little rice is grown. This makes it very difficult for farmers to rely on subsistence agriculture. Crop failures trigger foraging, increasing the number of land mine accidents. Many farmers produce non-traditional crops for the markets, including sesame, mung and soya. In 2003-04 it produced 17,204 tons of maize, the second-highest production in the country.
==== Longan farming ====
According to the Mekong Institute in 2013, longans were the third most important crop in Pailin province behind cassavas and maize. In Pailin, they are usually harvested between August and December. The most common variety of longans farmed are Pailin longans, which are farmed primarily in Battambang, Banteay Meanchey and Pailin provinces. In 2012, longan planting areas in the province occupied and produced 1,000 tons, increasing to almost in 2024. Around 60% of Pailin longans produced in 2012 was supplied to domestic market while 40% was sold to Thai buyers. From January to November 2022, farmers harvested 6,900 tonnes of longan, with 500 tonnes being exported to China. Longans have only been approved for export directly to China since 27 October 2022. Chinese demand for Pailin longans then rose, with China becoming the largest export market in the first half of 2023. 

Vouch Thuch (born 1983) is believed to be the first longan wine maker in Cambodia and operates the local Pailin Longan Wine Handicraft in the province. Arriving in Pailin in 2000, he saw that longan lacked the market and started the longan wine business in 2008 trademarked as &#x27;Palowin&#x27;. He replicated this with mangoes and mango wine. In July 2022, his winery was visited by U.S ambassador to Cambodia W. Patrick Murphey.

== Tourist attractions ==
Wat Phnom Yat

Built by Shan migrants from Myanmar in 1922, the Wat Phnom Yat is a holy place for worship in the heart of Pailin. It includes an old pagoda, similar to the Kola pagoda.

Wat Rattanak Sophoan

At the foot of Phnom Yat is another pagoda, the Wat Rattanak Sophoan, &quot;a Burmese style pagoda more than 570 years of age&quot;. On the walls of the enclosure surrounding the pagoda is a bas-relief depicting the Hindu saga of the churning of the Ocean of Milk.

== Culture ==
Pailin&#x27;s culture is distinctly different from most of Khmer culture. Before the Khmer Rouge period, Pailin&#x27;s culture was predominantly Shan Burmese, and has much in common with that of the country of Thailand and Burma. This affinity is shown in the region&#x27;s cuisine, dress, temple architecture, festivals and arts. The people of Pailin were predominantly Kola. The Kola people originally migrated from Burma beginning in 1876 (note: Khmer people called the Burmese people, &quot;Kola&quot; or &quot;Pumea&quot;). Another wave of migrants, the Shan (one of the many ethnic minorities of Burma) arrived from Burma in the 1920s. The &quot;Kola&quot; or Burmese immigrants of Pailin are known for their work in the precious gem business, which likely is what attracted them to Pailin. Pailin was synonymous with the Mogok region of Burma, where similar precious gemstones were mined. According to people who are in the gem business, gemstones of Pailin are comparable to the gemstones from the Mogok region in Burma; thus, Khmer people believed the Kola or immigrants from Burma were from the Mogok region of Burma).

There are several dialects spoken locally including Khmer, Shan and Kola. The local Khmer dialect shows influence in tone and pronunciation from the Burmese languages as well as Kham Muang and Mon language.

=== Cuisine ===
In Pailin, there are a few different kinds of foods. Kola&#x27;s food is distinct from Burma&#x27;s Cuisine as well. The most popular Burmese style one is Kola noodles (មីកុឡា, &quot;mee kola&quot;) which is a vegetarian noodle dish made from thin rice stick noodles, steamed and cooked with soy sauce and garlic chive, sometimes mixed with some meats and small lobster. Other dishes include Tom yum from Thailand and Mon banana pudding of Burma. These have all spread to other parts of Thailand and Cambodia, but normally in versions that are flavored more sweetly than the Pailin version, especially in Phnom Penh.

=== Clothing ===
The Traditional clothes of Pailin is Longyi, also known as Sarong. The cloth is often sewn into a cylindrical shape. It is worn around the waist, running to the feet. It is held in place by folding fabric over, without a knot. It is also sometimes folded up to the knee for comfort. These traditional &quot;longyi&quot; have about 2 meters of in length of a swan. The cloth is made of cotton and sometimes from silk. Kola men wear ankle-length patterns of checks, plaids or stripes &quot;Longyi&quot; in any kinds of color. The Men always wear their white &quot;eingyi&quot; shirt which has a mandarin collar and sometimes also wear a traditional jacket called &quot;taik-pon&quot; over their &quot;eingy&quot;. It has white, grey, black or terracotta colors. They put the gaung baung turban on their head and on their feet wear simple rubber or velvet slippers.

For Kola women&#x27;s calf-length &quot;longyi&quot; are in solid colors, flower prints and many kinds of designs. They often have a red-based color, with partial stripes or very small checks similar to what Mon wear. They also often have horizontal or vertical stripes at the middle part. Royalty traditionally wore a long dress called &quot;thin-dai&quot; decorated by many threads. It was always worn by a lord&#x27;s daughter and the king of the province&#x27;s lady. The Women wear a beautiful blouse and a lovely shirt which is known as &quot;eingyi&quot;. The shirt is decorated with several colors and many pieces of silver. The shirt also has horizontal or vertical stripes at the middle part in some beauty color. Kola women tie a traditional shawl on their &quot;eingyi&quot; as well as they put the shawl on their shoulders. Women tie a lovely band on their head and wear beautiful flowers in their hair, allowing their hair to drop as a ponytail above their shoulders. They sometimes take a traditional umbrella made from bamboo with them. The footwear is simple slippers of leather or velvet called Hnyat-phanat.

All of these costumes were shiny with bright colors during celebrations. The clothing is very similar to what is worn by the Shan in Burma.

The houses in Pailin are built from wood, about 8 cm to 1 meter includes a wide door and in the middle of the house, there are the hermitages of Buddha and another spirit house. The Kola People are fond of planting roses in front of their homes.

==Land mines==
Pailin and Cambodia, in general, was extensively mined during the three decades of war and remains home to numerous land mines and unexploded ordnance. People are cautioned to stay on marked roads. De-mining is ongoing with UN help, which brings in some of the few foreigners that the locals encounter.

Interestingly, resistance to Malaria drugs is surprisingly high in Pailin. Resistance first appeared in Pailin on the Cambodian-Thai border and then spread to Africa by the early 1980s. A second and third wave of resistance to a new set of malaria drugs occurred since. The local strain of malaria parasites may have some special properties, or the ecology of the region may have features that boost the rise of resistance.

<text>Aero is an aerated chocolate bar manufactured by the Vevey-based company Nestlé. Originally produced by Rowntree&#x27;s, Aero bars were introduced in 1935 to the North of England as the &quot;new chocolate&quot;. By the end of that year, it had proved sufficiently popular with consumers that sales were extended throughout the United Kingdom.

By 1936, sales of the chocolate had reached the US, and later spread to many other countries including Canada, South Africa and Japan. Aero has been manufactured by Nestlé since 1988, after a takeover of Rowntree&#x27;s. Known for its unique &quot;bubbly&quot; texture that collapses as the bar melts, it is available in many different flavours, and various forms including Aero Bubbles and Aero Biscuits.

==History==
The process of manufacture was patented in 1935 by Rowntree&#x27;s in York, England. The patent describes how the chocolate is heated and then aerated to create small bubbles. It is poured into moulds of the solid outer chocolate shell. As the chocolate cools, reduced air pressure allows the bubbles to expand inside the bar&#x27;s filling.

In 1935, Rowntree&#x27;s launched Aero into the United Kingdom, followed by the Peppermint Aero from 1959. The wrapping was brown (green in the mint version) and displayed the &quot;Rowntree&#x27;s&quot; script logo and the large word &quot;AERO&quot;, along with the slogan &quot;Hold on tight or I&#x27;ll fly away!&quot; below the &quot;AERO&quot; name. In 2014, the historical 1935 Aero packaging was placed online by historians at Rowntree&#x27;s to help trigger nostalgic memories in people with dementia. The vintage packaging from the Nestlé UK &amp; Ireland Archive was later released as a &quot;reminiscence pack&quot; on advice from the Alzheimer&#x27;s Society. It included a 1950s Aero label to transform modern products. The 1953 Aero packaging commemorated the Queen&#x27;s coronation.

During July 1983, the heatwave in the United Kingdom caused the bubbles in Aero bars to collapse due to the chocolate melting.

In 1997, Unilever sued Nestlé, stating that Nestlé infringed Unilever&#x27;s patent for aerated chocolate ice cream products.

In 2004, three workers at the York factory were dismissed for intentionally misprinting rude messages on the packaging of 20 pallets of Aero bars.

In 2008, the old Nestlé York factory on Haxby Road was closed, and a new £15 million Aero factory was opened next door, with the capacity to make 183 million chocolate bars per year. That same year, Aero&#x27;s packaging was updated with metallised laminate film to improve freshness. In 2015, the factory was making more than one billion Kit Kats and 200 million Aero bars each year. Nestlé invested over £1 million in new factory equipment in 2015 to manufacture the new Aero Mousse bars.

In February 2015, York&#x27;s Chocolate Story museum celebrated the 80th anniversary of the launch of the Aero bar with demonstrations and activities. In September 2015, fashion designer Matthew Williamson collaborated with Nestlé to release a limited edition wrapper design for Aero Milk Chocolate and Aero Peppermint bars. The packaging was in soft pink and mint shades with metallic highlights and Williamson&#x27;s butterfly motif.

The Aero flavoured McFlurry frozen desserts were available up until 2015, and brought back in the UK in May 2019. The flavours include Aero Chocolate and Aero Mint Chocolate, with chocolate pieces and sauce.

In Brazil, the bar is known as &quot;Suflair&quot;, but in 2014 Nestlé launched Aero in Brazilian market through subsidiary Garoto; in Hungary, Aero is known as &quot;Boci Aero&quot; and in the Netherlands as &quot;Bros&quot; (meaning &quot;brittle&quot;). Aero enjoys a large market following in South Africa with Aero, Aero Mint, and recently White Aero and Cappuccino Aero.

The Aero bar was made available for a short time in the United States by Nestlé during the 1980s, though it seems not to have been a commercial success. They are still available at certain speciality vendors or supermarkets such as Big Y, Wegmans and Publix that import the bars. Previously, The Hershey Company sold Aero bars in the United States under licence from Rowntree Chocolate Company from 1937 until 1939. Hershey recently marketed a similar bar called Hershey&#x27;s Air Delight but has since been discontinued.

=== Manufacturing ===
Aero bars were produced in Australia from the early 1970s until 1996. From 1996, the Aero bar was produced in Britain. In 2011, Nestlé recommenced manufacturing Aero bars in Australia at their Campbellfield factory in Victoria, with a capacity of up to 1000 tonnes per year. The bars had a different formula for Australian tastes with a smoother, creamier taste. The Aero bars sold in Britain would retain the older recipe.

In April 2001, Nestlé Canada announced that Aero and other bars manufactured at their Toronto factory would now be made alongside bars containing nuts. Nestlé no longer guaranteed that the bars were free from nut-protein contamination. In May 2001, the decision was reversed due to consumer outcry, and the company retained their nut-free guarantee for Canadian bars.

In 2004, Ukraine commenced producing Aero bars.

=== In other fields ===
In 1998, amateur rocket enthusiast Derek Willis was eating an Aero bar and was inspired by the bubbles to create the low-cost fuel, Asprop (Aerated Solid Propellant).

In 2007, an observational study published in the British Medical Journal explored the use of the texture of Aero and Crunchie bars as a technique to explain bone structure to patients. They determined it was an overly simplistic method.

In 2011, Ford engineer Carsten Stake was inspired by the texture of Aero bars in a bid to reduce the weight of plastic engine covers in their Focus vehicles. The MuCell plastic is injected with gas bubbles during moulding, making a microscopic honeycomb-like structure that is twenty per cent lighter and so lowers fuel consumption.

==Slogans and advertising==

=== 1930s ===
The Aero bar was advertised in the late 1930s with the slogan, &quot;You get a lift&quot;. Advertising about the imported bars in Melbourne, Australia in 1938 announced the Aero as the &quot;...original English aerated milk chocolate... ...crisp, light and yet so sustaining&quot;.

=== 1950s ===
Production ceased during wartime, and the bars were relaunched in the 1950s. The relaunch campaign had commissioned oil paintings of 40 &quot;ordinary&quot; women, to highlight that the chocolate bars were an accessible treat for all. The slogan used was &#x27;Different... For her, Aero - the milk chocolate that&#x27;s different!&quot;. After advertising Aero from 1951 to 1957, some of the portraits decorated the York factory for decades. In 2013, Nestlé attempted to identify the models, known as &quot;Aero girls&quot;, to better track their company history. The portraits were exhibited as &quot;Who Were the Aero Girls? Discovering Hidden Art in the Archives&quot;, at York&#x27;s Mansion House, and the project website. Some of the models were later identified as Barbara Pitt, Janey Ironside, Rose Wylie, Myrtle Crawford (later, Lady Acland) and Pamela Synge.

=== 1970s ===
In the 1970s, Rowntree&#x27;s aired an advertisement in which children flew an Aero bar as if it were a kite.

=== 1980s ===
In 1980, Nigel Havers featured in a train-themed Aero advertisement, which was included in the Animated Britain online project.

In the late 1980s, the slogan &quot;Each Aero Chocolate Bar Has The Nourishment Of Almost Three Ounces Of Milk&quot; was created by Toronto advertiser John Straiton. In 1987, the advertisement won the Rotten Apple Award from the Quebec Corporation of Professional Dietitians, as the comparison between the nutritional benefit of confectionery and dairy was considered misleading. Rowntree had previously received the same Rotten Apple Award in 1984 for a similar comparison between the bar with milk in a previous advertisement.

The slogan for Aero in Australia during the 1980s was &quot;It&#x27;s the bubbles of nothing that make it really something.&quot; From the 1999 redesign and &quot;singers&quot; advertising campaign Aero&#x27;s tagline was &quot;Have you felt the bubbles melt?&quot; This slogan was invented by Nick Welch, an advertiser and the father of Florence Welch of the indie band Florence and the Machine.

In circa 1989-1993, a young couple playing chess advertisement was popular in Ireland on television.

=== 1990s ===
The Aero packaging in 1993 in America had the slogan, &quot;Melt into the moment.&quot;, supported by television advertising showing a woman taking a bath in liquid chocolate.

In 1996, Nestlé repackaged the Aero bar and relaunched it with television advertising that used voice-over by Dani Behr, and the phrase &quot;Great chocolate taste.&quot; They changed the structure of the blocks to make it easier to break into sections. The advertisement showed a woman&#x27;s day dreams while floating away during eating an Aero.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, Nestlé apologised and withdrew milk and white chocolate cranberry-flavoured Aero bars from the market. The accompanying slogan &quot;Stuff Xmas! Treat yourself!&quot;, was considered potentially offensive by the Church of England and led to the suspension of distribution. In January 2001, the packaging was described as featuring a cartoon turkey with the words; &quot;Delicious Aero chocolate with a touch of sauciness - What could be more uplifting than bubbles that melt into delicious Nestlé chocolate?&quot;.

In 2001, The Aero White was relaunched as a permanent offering with a campaign theme, &quot;Here to Stay&quot;. In May that year, Nestlé UK&#x27;s &quot;All Bubble. No Squeak.&quot; campaign was previewed online prior to television, an unusual step at the time. It was previewed on the internet first, as the mouse character, Aeron, was computer-generated and this was considered a good strategy. The advertisement slogan, &quot;All bubble. No squeak.&quot;, and the clip showed a man buying an Aero bar, which included a free hula-hooping mouse. He declined the mouse as the chocolate bar was considered good enough as to not require gimmickry. The animated mouse later won Best Animated Animal at the 2002 All Star Animal Awards. The promotional campaign included people in mouse costumes in Manchester providing passers-by with a hula-hoop challenge in exchange for a free Aero bar.

In July 2001, presenter Davina McCall accidentally promoted Aero during a live eviction episode of Big Brother UK. She highlighted crowd banners that stated, &quot;Hats Off To The Bubble,&quot; mistakenly thinking that they were about evictee Paul &quot;Bubble&quot; Ferguson. It turned out that they were advertisements for the chocolate bar.

In 2002, Nestlé Canada&#x27;s research showed that consumers would often break the Aero bar into pieces and then let it melt in the mouth to prolong the experience. Their subsequent advertising showed two women, the first biting into the bar, the other responding, &quot;What are you doing? That&#x27;s not right.&quot;.

In 2007, Aero Hot Chocolate was promoted as an ideal Winter drink, with an animated bubble &quot;Lovely Bubbly&quot; television campaign.

In 2009, skateboarder Bob Burnquist featured in a UK ad called &quot;feel the bubbles&quot;, filmed skating through chocolate coloured balloons, with the Jackson 5&#x27;s song ABC playing in the background.

=== 2010s ===
The slogan in 2011 was &quot;Irresistabubble&quot;—a revival of a 1980s campaign that also featured the same word, and was created by Salman Rushdie, during his time as an advertising copywriter. Rushdie has said that he invented a whole series of bubble words for the campaign, including &quot;Delectabubble&quot;.

In 2012, agency Skive created the &#x27;AeroMail&#x27; social media campaign in which consumers could &quot;spread the bubbliness&quot; of Aero with a digital balloon on Facebook.

In 2018, The Interflex Group won the &quot;Best use of process colours only&quot; in the FlexoTech Awards for their work on the Nestlé Aero Chocolate Bubbles print design. The judging panel highlighted the use of CMYK with metallic effects by lamination, achieving a &#x27;copper&#x27; look.

* Mousse, a chilled dessert in milk and peppermint flavours. It was the first collaborative product by Nestlé and Rowntree after the takeover of Rowntree in June 1998. Details of the mousse were released in 1990, but there was no planned consumer advertising for that year due to possible advertising agency conflicts between the different brands. The mousse was produced by Nestlé&#x27;s subsidiary Chambourcy yogurt brand. Nestlé Aero Mousse was introduced in Australia in 2001 in Chocolate and Chocolate Mint flavours. In 2008, the UK mousse range was expanded from Milk and White Chocolate flavours with Mint and Choc. They were also renamed to Aero Bubbly Dessert. In 2017, the premium mousse, Aero Heavenly was released as a dessert sharing product.

=== Aero Mousse (bar) ===

=== Aero Drinks ===

* Aero chocolate drink was released in chocolate and chocolate mint flavours in February 1991. The drinks were advertised for teenagers and young adults with the same animated characters as those in Rowntree&#x27;s Aero bar ads. The 200ml packaging encouraged consumers to &quot;Chill &#x27;n&#x27; shake&quot; to produce Aero-like bubbles in the liquid. The 180ml-sized chocolate orange flavour was added in March 1992.
*Aero Instant Bubbly hot chocolate sachets were released to foodservices in 2005, and to the consumer market in 2006. The sachets made frothy bubbly drinks in Chocolate and Mint Chocolate flavours. In catering, the powder is mixed into a paste with hot water, then added to steamed milk, with bubbles characteristic of the Aero chocolate bar.

=== Aero Ice Cream ===

* Aero Ice Cream bars were released in the United Kingdom in 1995. The 60ml bars contained Aero chocolate inside a chocolate shell, surrounded by Aero chocolate ice cream. In 2010, R&amp;R Ice Cream in Yorkshire was contracted to make two types of Aero ice cream. These were: Aero Double Bubble, a mint and chocolate ice cream containing aerated pieces of chocolate; and Aero Bubbleball, a frozen chocolate and mint mousse pot with a ball of Aero chocolate.

=== Aero Bliss ===

* In April 2019, premium individually wrapped Aero boxed chocolates were released.

In 2006, Nestlé planned a half-mint and half-milk chocolate shell egg for the following Easter. The 2009 Easter range was planned to include a small filled Aero Bubbles egg. In 2010, Nestlé Canada introduced Aero in the shape of an egg for Easter. The 2011 Easter range was to include the Aero Luvabubble Lamb. Aero Lambs returned in 2012 with a peppermint centre and a Lamb Giant Egg. In 2013 the Easter range included the Aero Bubbles peppermint Insider Egg and the Aero Selection Giant Egg (with peppermint, orange and milk chocolate Aero bars). In 2016, Nestlé publicised the &quot;chocolate egg with bubbly bars&quot; as chocolate firms avoided the word &quot;Easter&quot; in their branding.
* Nestlé&#x27;s 1996 Christmas range included an Aero Christmas Pie, which combined Aero chocolate with spicy orange filling in the shape of a pie. The Christmas Pie also featured in 1997, and was changed in 1998 to green centred Aero Mint Pies. For 2011, they made a chocolate Aero Christmas Tree filled with bubbly peppermint, which also returned in 2012 and then in 2013 with an improved pack design. The Aero White Winter sharing block for Christmas 2015 had wrapping depicting sparkling silver baubles.
* An Aero Milk Chocolates Heart Box, 112g red heart-shaped box was promoted for teens in Canada for Valentine&#x27;s Day 2003.

==Life and career==

===Early years===

Michael Daugherty was born into a musical family on April 28, 1954, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. His father Willis Daugherty (1929–2011) was a jazz and country and western drummer, his mother Evelyn Daugherty (1927–1974) was an amateur singer, and his grandmother Josephine Daugherty (1907–1991) was a pianist for silent film. Daugherty&#x27;s four younger brothers are all professional musicians: Pat Daugherty (b. 1956) Leader of the group New York Electric Piano, Tim Daugherty (b. 1958) jazz/pop composer of over 15 CD&#x27;s featuring original compositions, Matt Daugherty (b. 1960) teacher of Music education in Florida, and Tommy D. Daugherty (b. 1961) engineer and producer for many of the Death Row artists most specifically Tupac Shukar.

The centerpieces of the modest Daugherty home, located at 1547 5th Avenue S.E. in Cedar Rapids, were a player piano, television, and record player. At the age of 8, Daugherty taught himself how to play piano by pumping the pedals of the player piano and watching how piano keys moved to Tin Pan Alley tunes such as &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;. Music was a significant activity in the Daugherty family, especially during the holidays when relatives would participate in jam sessions of popular songs like &quot;Misty&quot; and &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot;. Additionally, the Daugherty family would frequently gather around the television in the evening to watch popular variety hours such as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. The record collection at the Daugherty home consisted mainly of &#x27;easy listening music&#x27; of the fifties and music from Broadway theatre.

During his developmental years, Daugherty&#x27;s mother encouraged him to paint, draw cartoons, tap dance, and play basketball and his father and uncle Danny Nicol taught him how to play rock and jazz drums. From 1963 to 1967 Daugherty played bass drum in the Emerald Knights and tom-toms in the Grenadier Drum and Bugle Corps where he competed against other Drum and Bugle Corps throughout small Midwestern towns. During these years, Daugherty was employed as an early morning paper boy for &quot;The Des Moines Register&quot; and delivered papers across his neighborhood and to Mercy Hospital in Cedar Rapids.

Traveling was an important pastime for the Daugherty family. They often took long summer road trips down two-lane highways to tourist locations, including Mount Rushmore, Niagara Falls and Miami Beach. In 1964, the entire Daugherty family took a two-week vacation to London where The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix were at the height of their fame and Carnaby Street was the cutting edge of pop culture and fashion – this was in the heart of the Swinging Sixties.

The sixties in America were a time of great political unrest and social change. This made a great impact on the teenage Daugherty. Civil Rights demonstrations for racial equality and integration and demonstrations against the Vietnam War were becoming common day occurrences in Iowa by 1970, especially at the nearby University of Iowa, in Iowa City.

From 1968 to 1972, Daugherty was the leader, arranger, and organist for his high school rock, soul, and funk band, The Soul Company. This band performed a variety of Motown charts and music by James Brown, Blood Sweat &amp; Tears, and Sly and the Family Stone. Because accessing sheet music was almost impossible, Daugherty learned to hand-transcribe the music by listening to vinyl recordings. With the help of his father, who drove the band across the state, The Soul Company became a locally popular group that performed at high school proms, dances, and other events.

During the same years, Daugherty was a piano accompanist for the Washington High School Concert Choir, a solo jazz piano performer in nightclubs and lounges, and he appeared on local television as the pianist for the country and western &quot;Dale Thomas Show&quot;. Daugherty interviewed jazz artists who performed in Iowa, including Buddy Rich, Stan Kenton, George Shearing, and Rahsaan Roland Kirk, and he wrote articles on their music for the high school newspaper. During the summers of 1972–77, Daugherty played Hammond organ at county fairs across the Midwest for various popular music stars such as Bobby Vinton, Boots Randolph, Pee Wee King, and members of &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;.

===Education in the United States and Europe===
Daugherty studied music composition and jazz at the University of North Texas College of Music from 1972 to 1976. His teachers of composition included Martin Mailman and James Sellars. Daugherty also played jazz piano in the Two O&#x27;Clock Lab Band. It was after hearing the Dallas Symphony Orchestra perform the &quot;Piano Concerto&quot; by Samuel Barber that Daugherty decided to devote his full energies into composing music for the concert stage. In 1974, conductor Anshel Brusilow programmed a new work with the University of North Texas Symphony Orchestra, Daugherty was 20 years of age. After his premiere of &quot;Movements for Orchestra&quot;, the composition faculty awarded Daugherty a fellowship, which allowed him to continue his musical studies at the university. Daugherty received a Bachelor of Music degree in Composition from North Texas State University in 1976.

That same year, Daugherty moved to New York City to experience the exploding new music scene. While there, he studied serialism with Charles Wuorinen at the Manhattan School of Music for two years, and received a Master of Music in Composition degree in 1978. To earn money for his studies, Daugherty was employed as an usher at Carnegie Hall and a rehearsal pianist for dance classes directed by the New York City Ballet dancer Jacques d&#x27;Amboise.
Daugherty frequently attended &quot;uptown&quot; and &quot;downtown&quot; new music concerts in New York City; this is where he became acquainted with composers such as Milton Babbitt, Morton Feldman, and Pierre Boulez. In 1978, Boulez, then the Music Director of the New York Philharmonic, invited Daugherty to apply to his recently opened computer music institute in Paris: IRCAM (Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique). A Fulbright Fellowship enabled Daugherty to move to Paris to study computer music at IRCAM from 1979 to 1980. During his time at IRCAM, he met many composers such as Luciano Berio, Gérard Grisey, Tod Machover, and Frank Zappa. In Paris, Daugherty had the opportunity to hear contemporary music by the leading European composers of the time performed by the Ensemble l&#x27;Itinéraire and Boulez&#x27;s Ensemble InterContemporain. He also attended analysis classes given by Betsy Jolas at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique de Paris.

In the fall of 1980, Daugherty returned to America to pursue doctoral studies in composition at the Yale School of Music. During that time, Jacob Druckman (who was one of America&#x27;s most influential composers) was chair of the composition department at Yale and composer in residence with the New York Philharmonic. Daugherty studied with Druckman and other Pulitzer Prize winning composers at Yale, including Bernard Rands and Roger Reynolds. He also studied improvisational notation systems and open form with experimental music composer Earle Brown. Daugherty&#x27;s composition class at Yale included student composers who would later become unique and important voices in contemporary music: Bang on a Can composers Michael Gordon, David Lang, and Julia Wolfe; along with Robert Beaser, Aaron Jay Kernis, Scott Lindroth, and Betty Olivero.

At Yale, Daugherty wrote his dissertation on the relationship between the music of Charles Ives and Gustav Mahler and the writings of Goethe and Ralph Waldo Emerson. He worked closely on this dissertation with John Kirkpatrick, who was the curator of the Ives Collection at Yale and gave the 1938 premiere of Ives&#x27; &quot;Piano Sonata No. 2: Concord Sonata&quot;. Daugherty also continued his interest in jazz where he worked with Willie Ruff and directed the Yale Jazz Ensemble. It was Ruff who introduced Daugherty to jazz arranger Gil Evans, who, at that time, was looking for an assistant. For the next several years, Daugherty traveled by train from New Haven to Evans&#x27; private studio in Manhattan. Daugherty helped Evans organize his music manuscripts and complete projects. The most notable project was the reconstruction of the lost arrangements of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, which was originally used for the 1958 recording with Miles Davis.

During the summer of 1981, Daugherty studied composition with Pulitzer Prize–winning composer Mario Davidovsky as a composition fellow at Tanglewood, which, at that time, was renowned as a bastion of abstract and atonal music. It was at Tanglewood that Daugherty met the composer/conductor Leonard Bernstein. After hearing Daugherty&#x27;s music at Tanglewood, Bernstein encouraged Daugherty to seriously consider integrating American popular music with concert music. In the early 1980s, Bernstein&#x27;s populist attitude was rarely shared by critics who favored &quot;serious&quot; contemporary concert music.

One year later, in the summer of 1982, Daugherty traveled to Germany to attend the Darmstädter Ferienkurse (Internationale Ferienkurse für Neue Musik – Darmstadt International Summer Courses in New Music). Darmstadt was one of the leading centers for new music in Europe, where the musical aesthetics of Theodor W. Adorno were still of great influence. Daugherty attended lectures given by composers, including Brian Ferneyhough and Karlheinz Stockhausen, and performances by the Arditti String Quartet. At Darmstadt, Daugherty became friends with Karlheinz&#x27;s son, the trumpet player Markus Stockhausen. Together they formed an experimental improvisation ensemble (Markus Stockhausen on trumpet and electronics and Daugherty on synthesizers) that, over several years, performed in concert halls and clubs across Europe.
In the fall of 1982, Daugherty was invited by composer György Ligeti to study composition with him at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg. In addition to attending Ligeti&#x27;s composition seminar (which took place at his apartment in Hamburg), Daugherty traveled with Ligeti to attend concerts and festivals of his music throughout Europe. At the time, Ligeti was interested in the music of Conlon Nancarrow, who lived in isolation in Mexico City and composed complex polyrhythmic music for player pianos. The player piano (by now an antique) was a familiar and nostalgic musical instrument to Daugherty. Daugherty met Nancarrow in Graz, Austria, when Ligeti introduced Nancarrow and his music to the European intelligentsia at the 1982 ISCM (International Society for Contemporary Music) World Music Days. During the following two years (1983–84), Daugherty continued to study with Ligeti while employed as a solo jazz pianist in night clubs in Cambridge, England and Amsterdam. To create &quot;original&quot; music, Ligeti encouraged and inspired Daugherty to find new ways to integrate computer music, jazz, rock, and American popular music with concert music. In the fall of 1984, Daugherty returned to America and devoted his career to doing just that.

==Teaching==
Daugherty is an educator of young composers and advocate for contemporary music. As an Assistant Professor of Composition at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music (1986–91), Daugherty organized guest residencies of composers with performances of their music. Daugherty also organized the 1988 Electronic Festival Plus Festival, which took place at Oberlin and featured music from over 50 composers. While teaching composition at Oberlin, Daugherty collaborated with renowned jazz trumpeter Donald Byrd, who taught there from 1987 to 1989. After Daugherty introduced Byrd to the W.C. Handy composition &quot;Harlem Blues&quot;, Byrd asked Daugherty to arrange it for a commercial recording made at the Van Gelder Studio located in Englewood Cliffs, NJ for the Landmark label, with Daugherty playing synthesizers.

In 1991, Daugherty was invited to join the composition faculty at the University of Michigan School of Music (Ann Arbor). He replaced Leslie Bassett, who retired. Daugherty was co-chair of the composition department with composer William Bolcom from 1998 to 2001, and chair of the department from 2002 to 2006. At the University of Michigan, Daugherty mentored many young composers, including Clarice Assad, Derek Bermel, Gabriela Lena Frank, Kristin Kuster, David T. Little, Shuying Li, Joel Puckett, Andrea Reinkemeyer, Arlene Sierra, D. J. Sparr and Roger Zare. Daugherty has organized residencies of guest composers with performances of their music, including Louis Andriessen, Michael Colgrass, Michael Torke, Joan Tower, Betsy Jolas and György Ligeti. He has also composed new works, including &quot;Niagara Falls&quot; (1997) and &quot;Bells for Stokowski&quot; (2002), for the University of Michigan Symphony Band and its two most recent conductors, H. Robert Reynolds and Michael Haithcock.

Daugherty organized a three-day festival and conference entitled ONCE. MORE., which took place November 2–4, 2010 at Rackham Auditorium, located on the University of Michigan campus. For the first time in 50 years, the original ONCE composers Robert Ashley, Gordon Mumma, Roger Reynolds and Donald Scarvada returned to Ann Arbor to participate in concerts featuring their recent compositions and their works from the original ONCE festival held in Ann Arbor in the 1960s.

Daugherty has served as a final judge for the Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) Student Composers Awards, the Gaudeamus International Composers Competition, and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s Elaine Lebenborn Award for Female Composers. He has also been a panelist for the National Endowment for the Arts and Meet the Composer. Daugherty has served as a composer mentor for reading sessions of young composers&#x27; music by organizations such as the American Composers Orchestra, Minnesota Composers Orchestra, Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music, Omaha Symphony, and the Young Composers Institute in Apeldoorn (Netherlands).

Daugherty has been Composer-in-Residence with the Louisville Symphony Orchestra (2000), Detroit Symphony Orchestra (1999–2003), Colorado Symphony Orchestra (2001–02), Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music (2001, 2006, 2011), Westshore Symphony Orchestra (2005–06), Eugene Symphony (2006), the Henry Mancini Summer Institute (2006), the Music from Angel Fire Chamber Music Festival (2006), the Pacific Symphony (2010), Chattanooga Symphony Orchestra (2012), New Century Chamber Orchestra (2014), and the Albany Symphony Orchestra (2015).

In 2001, Daugherty was invited to present his music with performances by the United States Air Force Band at the Midwest Clinic &quot;The Midnight Special&quot; in Chicago. Daugherty has participated in the Ravinia Festival Community Outreach program which is designed to promote and encourage new music by student ensembles in the Chicago Public Schools.

<text>The Black River is a blackwater river in South Carolina in the United States. It courses through Lee, Sumter, Clarendon, and Williamsburg counties before merging with the Great Pee Dee River in Georgetown County. The river was called the Wee Nee by the Native Americans who once inhabited the area. In June 2001, a 75-mile segment of the river was designated a State Scenic River.

<text>Simcha Holtzberg (sometimes spelled Holzberg) (Hebrew: שמחה הולצברג, April 18, 1924 – February 13, 1994) was an Israeli activist and Holocaust survivor. He was known as the &quot;Father of the Wounded Soldiers,&quot; and was a recipient of the Israel Prize.

==Biography==
Holtzberg was born in Warsaw, Poland, to Shmuel and Tziporah Holtzberg. He participated in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, was captured by the Nazis and sent to different concentration camps, and was liberated from Bergen-Belsen.

Holtzberg arrived in Israel in 1949, and became famous for his stubborn struggle against normalizing relations between Israel and Germany. He organized demonstrations every time a high-ranking German official came to Israel.

He also established Holocaust libraries and published the poems of the Holocaust poet Itzhak Katzenelson. He befriended the famous Rabbi Aryeh Levin of Jerusalem, known as &quot;Father of the Prisoners&quot;. Levine&#x27;s example influenced Holtzberg&#x27;s lifetime devotion to wounded soldiers, whom he considered &quot;the nation&#x27;s holy and righteous&quot;.

Holtzberg became known in Israel as &quot;Father of the Wounded Soldiers&quot;. He dedicated his life to visiting and helping wounded-in-service soldiers and terrorism victims in Israel. His aim was to restore the wounded to normal lives and enable them to return to society successfully.

In 1976, Holtzberg was awarded the Israel Prize, for his special contribution to society and the State of Israel.

==Death==

Holtzberg died during a ceremony held in honor of the wounded on February 13, 1994. He is buried in the Sanhedria Cemetery in Jerusalem.

The Israel Philatelic Federation issued a stamp in his honor on April 19, 1999, the 75th anniversary of his birth, showing his portrait and a legend stating &quot;Father of the Wounded Soldiers&quot;. Dozens of streets in Israel are named in his honor, including one in Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev, Jerusalem.

<doc id="1217781" wikidata="Q1605508" url="?curid=1217781" title="The Blood Brothers (band)">
<text>The Blood Brothers are an American post-hardcore band which formed in Seattle&#x27;s Eastside suburbs in 1997. The group released five full-length albums before their 2007 break-up, but reunited for a series of shows surrounding and including FYF Fest in 2014. They reunited once again in 2024 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their album &quot;Crimes&quot;.

==History==

=== Origin ===
Singers Jordan Blilie and Johnny Whitney and drummer Mark Gajadhar formed the band from a previous musical endeavor, a band called Vade that they were involved with when they were 15 years old. Joining with bassist Morgan Henderson and guitarist Devin Welch the following year, the Blood Brothers were born in August 1997. The band recorded their first 7-inch record for $200 in a basement the following year. After replacing Welch with guitarist Cody Votolato (who is a year younger than the rest of the band), the current lineup was complete. The band left on their first tour immediately after Votolato graduated from high school. In July 2002, the band toured the United States with Vermont-based math rock band The Cancer Conspiracy and Florida-based indie rock band The Rocking Horse Winner. The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;...Burn, Piano Island, Burn&quot;, was released in 2003 and produced by Ross Robinson.

The Blood Brothers&#x27; fifth and final album, &quot;Young Machetes&quot;, was released on October 10, 2006, with Fugazi member Guy Picciotto co-producing it.

=== Hiatus and breakup ===
Music website Punknews.org reported that the band was going on hiatus, though they had initially reported the situation as a breakup. The news story linked to a forum post by Three One G owner Justin Pearson, who was replying to a post about the breakup of Some Girls. He only stated &quot;the blood bros broke up.&quot;

The band officially broke up in June 2007, but kept the information from the public until November 2007. Rumors of the disbandment can be traced as far back as July.

The Blood Brothers were expected to make an announcement about their future in early 2008, but instead officially announced the breakup on November 8, 2007:

In a December 2008 interview with Seattle newspaper &quot;The Stranger&quot;, Blilie gave the following reason for the band&#x27;s breakup:

It was announced on October 19, 2009, that Epitaph Records would be re-issuing the band&#x27;s last four full-length albums with added b-sides, live tracks and remixes. 

=== Reunions ===
On May 16, 2014, The Blood Brothers announced a reunion to play FYF Fest on August 24. Their first show in 7 years took place on August 22, 2014 at the Showbox in Seattle. The band added further dates in New York City, Austin and Santa Ana. Jordan Billie said that the band would not be releasing new music.

On May 15, 2024, The Blood Brothers announced another reunion and United States tour alongside a 20th anniversary reissue of &quot;Crimes&quot;. Billie said, &quot;It was on stage, though, where that energy reached its most joyful, reckless, collective state. It’s an experience that never really goes away, and one we wanted to share again. So, we’ll be playing a handful of shows this fall.&quot; The band&#x27;s first show in a decade took place on October 13, 2024 in Las Vegas, as a last-minute replacement for Bright Eyes to headline the Best Friends Forever festival.

==Musical style==

The Blood Brothers is commonly seen as a post-hardcore band and incorporate elements from a number of genres including experimental, screamo, emo, hardcore punk, noise, post-punk, and dance.

The band is particularly notable for having the unique dueling vocals of Johnny Whitney and Jordan Blilie. The style of guitar playing showcased by Votolato has greatly changed over time, most notably between the heavy, discordant sound of &quot;...Burn, Piano Island, Burn&quot; and the minimalist lead lines of &quot;Crimes&quot;, where the energy of the drums and vocals tends to make up for the lack of thick distortion. Whitney&#x27;s voice is generally accepted to have evolved from the slurred, venomous drawl on &quot;This Adultery Is Ripe&quot; to the high-pitched squeals (&quot;like a child being tortured &quot;) heard on &quot;Crimes&quot;, while Blilie&#x27;s voice has grown more distinctive while maintaining the same low, robust ferocity. The band has cited Drive Like Jehu, Botch, Swing Kids, Rye Coalition, and Gang of Four, among others, as influences. Cody Votolato&#x27;s angular guitarwork, in addition to drawing from Drive Like Jehu, Swing Kids, and Rye Coalition, was also influenced by Antioch Arrow.

==Other projects==
Several members of the band have been or are currently involved in other projects:
* Johnny Whitney and Mark Gajadhar released an album &quot;Chandeliers in the Savannah&quot; in 2005 under the name Neon Blonde after the release of &quot;Crimes&quot;, 2004. An EP was also released earlier in 2005.

<text>The Holzberg is a small range of hills up to in south Lower Saxony, Germany.

==Geography==
The forested ridge of the Holzberg is located in the district of Holzminden at the junction of the Leine Uplands in the east and the Weser Uplands in the west. It lies northeast of the Solling between Stadtoldendorf and the Homburg Forest to the north, the Elfas to the northeast, the Amtsberge to the east, from which it is separate by the small valley of the Teichbach, and Dassel to the southeast. The eastern part of the Holzberg is called the Denkiehausen Forest (&quot;Denkiehäuser Wald&quot;)

Several streams rise on the Holzberg ridge that, sooner or later, become tributaries of the Leine and Weser. Its northern foothills are drained by the Lenne (an eastern tributary of the Weser) which rises in the area and flows northwest; its eastern slopes by the Teichbach (northern tributary of the Spüligbach); its southern foothills by the upper course of the Spüligbach (northwestern tributary of the Ilme) and its western slopes by the Eberbach (southwestern source stream of the Forstbach). 

=== Natural regions ===
The Holzberg, together with the Amtsberge hills to the southeast and the Ellensen Forest which lies beyond it, belong to the natural region known as &quot;Amtsberge&quot; (371.04) within the sub-unit of the Northern Solling Foreland (371.0) in the major unit of the Solling Foreland (371) and in the major unit group of the Weser-Leine Uplands (No. 37). The land transitions to the northwest into the natural region of the Stadtoldendorf Plateau (&quot;Stadtoldendorfer Hochfläche&quot;) (371.02) and to the northeast into the Elfas Hinterland (&quot;Elfasumland&quot;) (371.06). To the southwest is the subunit of the Northern Solling (370.0) within the major unit of Solling, Bramwald and Reinhardswald (370).
== Hills ==
The highest elevations on the Holzberg ridge include (in metres above NN): 
* Holzberg (444.5 m) – on the southern rocky slopes of the Holzberg
* Unnamed peak (441.3 m) – south of the (western) crags (&quot;Klippen&quot;)
* Unnamed peak (405.4 m) – south of the (western) crags
* Unnamed peak (436.0 m) – in the central Holzberg
* Unnamed peak (397.0 m) – northeast of the (western) crags

==Streams==

* Lenne (eastern tributary of the Weser; rises on the northern edge of the Holzberg) 
* Spüligbach (northwestern tributary of the Ilme; rises on the southern edge of the Holzberg) 
* Teichbach (northern tributary of the Spüligbach)

<doc id="1217788" wikidata="Q293149" url="?curid=1217788" title="Holly Williams (musician)">
<text>Holly Audrey Williams (born March 12, 1981) is an American singer-songwriter and musician. She is the granddaughter of Hank Williams, the half-niece of Jett Williams, daughter of Hank Williams Jr., half-sister of Hank Williams III, and half-aunt of Coleman Williams. Williams has released three studio albums: &quot;The Ones We Never Knew&quot; in 2004, &quot;Here with Me&quot; in 2009 and &quot;The Highway&quot; in 2013. &quot;The Highway&quot; was released on Williams&#x27; own label, Georgiana Records, and reached No. 146 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200

==Early life==
Williams&#x27;s mother, Becky, is a native of Mer Rouge, Louisiana, and was married to Hank Williams Jr. for a decade. She was born in Cullman, Alabama, and has an elder sister named Hilary. Her parents separated when she was young. At age 17, Williams began playing one of her father&#x27;s guitars, and soon began writing songs.

Williams attended elementary school at St. Paul Christian Academy in Nashville, Tennessee. She graduated from Brentwood Academy and decided to pursue her passion of songwriting and continue playing guitar and piano. She purchased her domain name, recorded an EP, initiated a website, and booked herself at various Nashville clubs.

==Career==
Soon after signing with CAA, she performed many shows throughout the US and usually toured alone with a guitar and keyboard driving her mother&#x27;s car across the country. She went to the UK to open for songwriter Ron Sexsmith with a backpack full of EPs and a guitar. After the release of her first EP in 2003, she signed with Universal South Records and toured with Billy Bob Thornton, Jewel, Train, Keith Urban, and Kasey Chambers. Universal South released her debut album, &quot;The Ones We Never Knew&quot;, in 2004.

In March 2006, Williams was injured in a car crash with her sister Hilary Williams, and canceled her upcoming tour. Her sister was seriously injured, enduring 23 surgeries. Holly Williams&#x27; right arm and wrist were broken; she was unsure of when she would play again. She wrote &quot;Without Jesus Here with Me&quot; about her experience during the time of the car accident; it was released on her next record. Hilary Williams wrote a book called &quot;Sign of Life&quot; about her experience. Holly Williams made small musical appearances at this time, one of them joining John C. Reilly in Nashville, Tennessee, to sing &quot;Let&#x27;s Duet&quot; during the release of &quot;Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story&quot; on December 9, 2007.

After a long break Williams began playing guitar and writing songs again, she signed with Luke Lewis at Mercury Records. Williams&#x27; second studio album, &quot;Here with Me&quot;, was released in June 2009. To promote the album, Williams appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; and &quot;Chelsea Lately&quot;. &quot;People&quot; magazine named Williams&#x27; 2009 album &quot;one of the top ten albums of the year&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; said it was &quot;one of the best singer/songwriter albums to come out of Nashville&quot;. &quot;USA Today&quot; said &quot;Hank Williams&#x27; granddaughter reveals a heart-on-sleeve intensity that might be grating were it not for the purity and potency of her milk-and-whiskey-kissed singing and the catchy clarity and integrity of her songs&quot;. She filmed a music video for &quot;Alone&quot; and &quot;Three Days in Bed&quot; in Paris.

Williams finished a six-week tour in Europe in early 2010, and continued the rest of the year headlining gigs and opening for other artists such as John Hiatt. After Bob Dylan called, Williams added her own music and lyrics to a half written Hank Williams Sr. lyric for a project entitled &quot;The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams&quot; that he assembled, released in September 2011. Jack White, Norah Jones, Merle Haggard and Lucinda Williams were alongside Williams for this project.

Williams was also a part of &quot;Let Us In&quot;, a project produced by Phil Madeira which includes artists singing their favorite Paul McCartney songs in tribute to Linda McCartney. Williams performed &quot;My Love&quot; from the Wings era. Steve Earle and Buddy Miller are also included on the album.

Williams was featured on the soundtrack for &quot;Flicka&quot; singing &quot;Rodeo Road&quot;, written by Tom Douglas and Chuck Cannon. Tim McGraw (who starred in &quot;Flicka&quot;) named Williams, The Fray and Coldplay as his favorite artists in &quot;O, The Oprah Magazine&quot; saying &quot;She has the ability to make you believe what she says, to make you feel vulnerable. She&#x27;s intense and moody; she puts you in a time and place where you never would have imagined yourself—and then you&#x27;re there.&quot; Mel Gibson met with Williams in Nashville and featured her on &quot;The Passion of The Christ&quot; soundtrack singing &quot;How Can You Refuse Him Now&quot;, written by her grandfather.

Williams&#x27; third album, &quot;The Highway&quot;, co-produced by Williams and Charlie Peacock was released on February 5, 2013. She wrote or co-wrote every song on the album, which is common for her recordings. This album includes Dierks Bentley, Jakob Dylan, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jackson Browne adding backing harmonies. &quot;The Highway&quot; was released to critical acclaim. &quot;American Songwriter&quot; magazine said &quot;Williams has recorded her most accomplished, mature and world weary album. Even Hank Sr. would be proud.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated &quot;Williams is often closer to songwriters like John Prine or Bruce Springsteen, than the smiley Nashville mainstream.&quot; &quot;People Magazine&quot; gave the album three and a half stars and said the album was &quot;sure to go down as one of the year&#x27;s best country albums&quot;. A music video for &quot;Drinkin&#x27;&quot; aired on CMT networks.

==Boutique==
Williams&#x27; store &quot;H. Audrey&quot; is a women&#x27;s clothes boutique in Nashville.

==Personal life==
Williams was married on September 27, 2009, to fellow musician Chris Coleman (who co-wrote three of the songs on &quot;The Highway&quot;) and they settled in Nashville, Tennessee. They have four children.

<text>The Dell Axim family of personal digital assistants was Dell&#x27;s line of Windows Mobile-powered Pocket PC Devices. The first model, the Axim X5, was introduced in 2002, while the final model, the Axim X51, was discontinued on April 9, 2007.

==Background==

===X5 family===
Dell entered the personal digital assistant (PDA) market in 2002 with the debut of the &quot;Axim X5&quot;. The base-level Axim X5 had a 300 MHz Intel XScale PXA250 processor, 32 MB RAM, 32 MB flash ROM, a Type II CompactFlash slot, an SD/MMC slot, a 16-bit QVGA (240 × 320 dots) TFT display, a speaker, a microphone, and a base price of US$279. A high-end Axim X5 came with a 400 MHz Intel XScale processor, 64 MB RAM, and 48 MB flash ROM for US$349. Early models shipped with Pocket PC 2002, but an upgrade to Windows Mobile 2003 was offered and came preinstalled on some refurbished units. Despite rumours and speculations, further versions of Windows Mobile are unsupported. However, efforts have been made to port Linux to the system. Although the Axim X5 was regarded as an affordable Windows Mobile device at the time it was released, affordability came with a size penalty: The weight was 195 g (6.9 ounces) and the size was 127 mm × 81 mm × 18 mm (5 in × 3.2 in × 0.7 in). The Axim X5 came with a rechargeable battery that would last for about 8 hours.

The Dell Axim X5 was superseded by the Dell Axim X3 and subsequently X30, a follow-up to the Dell Axim X5 boasting a more compact design and with lighter weight.

Many Dell Axim x5 units have issues with the touchscreen failing and a realignment failing as well, even after a hard reset. There is a design flaw inside the unit that causes this. The inside portion of the home button will rub against the touchscreen ribbon cable and eventually wear through the protective coating and ground out the touchscreen. The fix is to take the unit apart and put a very small piece of electrical tape over that portion of the ribbon cable. This requires removing both batteries, clearing all data from the device (similar to a hard reset) and delicate work in taking the unit completely apart.

===X3 family===
Dell Axim X3 was launched in October 2003, and came in three models: the Basic, Advanced and X3i which was the same as the Advanced model but added WiFi 802.11b wireless networking. All featured replaceable battery, an SD slot, fast processor and transflective liquid crystal display. Unlike the X5, the X3 didn&#x27;t have a CF slot.

All three models looked the same with the exception of the X3i which had a WiFi antenna nub on the top right corner. The Basic and Advanced models varied in processor speed and amount of memory. All models had Intel XScale PXA263 processors and Intel StrataFlash ROM.

The Basic had a 300 MHz XScale processor, 31 MB of RAM and 32 MB of ROM. The Basic model came with a USB sync cable (users could purchase a cradle separately). SD slot, WiFi capability and Infrared port included.

The Advanced model had a 400 MHz XScale processor, 64 MB of RAM and 64 MB of ROM. The Axim X3i added WiFi to the Advanced model configuration. The Advanced and X3i came with a chrome finish weighted USB sync cradle that can also charge a spare battery. In all other respects, these units were identical to each other.

X3 came with a user replaceable 950 mAh lithium-ion battery, which could be replaced by an optional 1800 mA extended battery which doubled run times.

===X30 family===
The &quot;Dell Axim X30&quot; was the first Dell Pocket PC to include Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition on all models . This was also the first Pocket PC to include the Intel XScale PXA270 Processors. 

The High-End X30 includes a 624 MHz processor making it the fastest Personal Digital Assistant or PDA at the time it was made. The mid-level model includes everything the High-End X30 does with the exception of the cradle, and uses a 312 MHz PXA270 Processor instead. Both the high-end and mid-level models had built-in 802.11b Wi-Fi Certification, Bluetooth 1.1 compliance, 64 MB of Intel StrataFlash ROM, and 64 MB RAM, while the entry-level model had 32 MB SDRAM, 32 MB of Intel StrataFlash ROM and no wireless capabilities. All X30 models include a standard SD/MMC/SDIO slot, replaceable/rechargeable battery, a 3.5&quot; QVGA TFT 16-Bit color display, and Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition.

SDHC cards will not function. Only SD cards of 4 GB or less will work.

===X50 family===
The &quot;Dell Axim X50&quot; family was available in three models. The X50 low-end model used an Intel XScale processor at 416 MHz, 64 MB flash ROM, and retailed for $299 USD. The mid-range model had 128 MB of flash ROM, a 520 MHz processor, and was listed at $399. The high-end device, the X50v, had a VGA screen, 624 MHz processor, 128 MB flash ROM, and retailed for $499 at the time of release. In 2005 the Dell Axim X50 series received a Red Dot Design Award as a recognition for its design.

The Axim X50 family is a set of Pocket PCs from Dell released in 2004 . They are available in three models. Two named X50 (referred to as Low and Mid) and the high-end X50v. In 2005 X50 series received Red Dot Design Award as a recognition for its design.

===X50v===
The X50v retailed for $499 at the time of release.
The &quot;v&quot; represented its VGA screen. The X50v remains one of the few devices to utilize the Intel 2700G 3D accelerator &amp; video decoder with 16 MB video RAM. It allowed the device to render the 3D games included by Dell as well as others available retail.
The device&#x27;s memory has a built-in 128 MB Intel StrataFlash ROM with 64 MB RAM. The X50v shipped with Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition. An upgrade was offered by Dell the next year to Windows Mobile 5, however it was later withdrawn because users complained about slow performance. The reason for the slowdown was that Windows Mobile 2003 stores modified files in RAM and only writes to the flash chip when users copy files to the internal storage partition. Windows Mobile 5 changes this, it does not store files in RAM and writes everything permanently to flash memory. Because of this data is not lost when the battery is empty for a long time and the RAM contents are cleared. The storage chip in the Dell Axim X50 family however is not suitable for constant writes since it is slow NOR flash, which is why Windows Mobile 5 runs slow on these devices. The X51 family in comparison has a faster flash chip and is suited to run Windows Mobile 5.

While the X50 family has reached EOL, in mid-2007, an unofficial Windows Mobile 6 ROM for the X50v appeared. This update requires the PDA to be upgraded to WM5 and then uses the bootloader to flash a WM6 ROM image from an SD card. The update works successfully and adds new features to the X50v.

Features include:
*3.5&quot; Quarter-VGA LCD screen with 16-Bit Color and Portrait/Landscape Support
*Built-In CompactFlash expansion slot
*Built-In Secure Digital expansion slot
*Intel PXA270 Processor running at 416 MHz (Low)/ 520 MHz (Mid)
*Available Built-In 802.11b Wi-Fi Certification (X50 Mid only)
*Standard Built-In Bluetooth 1.2 Compliance
*64 MB (Low)/ 128 MB (Mid) Intel StrataFlash ROM with 64 MB on-handheld RAM
*Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition (Upgradeable to Windows Mobile 5.0 and Windows Mobile 6.0 with downloaded ROM Update)

The X50(Low) retailed for $299 USD and the X50(Mid) retailed for $399 at launch

===Firmware===
The latest official Windows Mobile 2003 SE ROM build for the Axim is A05 (Released 8/18/05) and is located at Support.Dell.com

The latest official Windows Mobile 5 ROM build for the Axim is A02 (Released 12/27/06) and is located at
Support.Dell.com

There is also an unofficial Windows Mobile 6 ROM that has been modified to run on the Axim X50v. The current revision is A03 Beta (Released 5/11/07)

There is also an unofficial Windows Mobile 6.1 ROM for Axim x50v. The current revision is A09 LennySh edition.

===X51 family===
The Dell Axim X51, released late September 2005, featured the same sleek design as the X50v, but replaced Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition with Windows Mobile 5. The X51 also came with a larger ROM than the X50.

Like the X50, the X51 family came in three models. The X51 featured:
*3.7&quot; VGA LCD screen with 16-Bit Color and Portrait/Landscape Support (X51v only)
**3.7&quot; VGA is around 2.22&quot; x 2.96&quot; = around 216 pixels per inch
*3.5&quot; Quarter-VGA LCD screen with 16-Bit Color and Portrait/Landscape Support (X51 Low &amp; Mid)
*Intel 2700G 3D multimedia accelerator with 16 MB video RAM (X51v only)
*VGA-Out functionality (using an optional adapter cable), enabling the PDA to be connected to a monitor (X51v only)
*Built-In CompactFlash Type II expansion slot
*Built-In Secure Digital expansion slot
*Available Built-In 802.11b Wi-Fi Certification (X51 Mid &amp; X51v only)
*Standard Built-In Bluetooth 1.2 Compliance
*Long-range IrDA interface
*Up to 256 MB Intel StrataFlash ROM with 64 MB on-board RAM
*Microsoft Windows Mobile 5.0 software with Windows Media Player 10 Mobile (Upgradeable to Windows Mobile 6.1 with a downloaded ROM update)
*RS-232 port is also included, but only supplies TTL signal level. Dell has a RS-232 cable for it though, even if it was never listed in their webshop.

The low-end X51 has an Intel XScale processor running at 416 MHz, 128 MB flash ROM, and had a list price of $299 (before being discontinued). The mid-range model also has 128 MB flash ROM, a 520 MHz processor, and retailed for $299 (from dell.com or £245.58 on www.dell.co.uk). The high-end X51v has a VGA screen, a 624 MHz processor, 256 MB flash ROM, and had a list price of $379.

As of February 17, 2007 the low-end X51 has been discontinued and is not sold by Dell anymore.

There is also an unofficial upgrade to Windows Mobile 6.1 for the X51v. Despite its unofficial status, it has been tested and had gone through several prerelease versions before being released to the general public. 
An unofficial upgrade to Windows Mobile 6.0 exists for the X50. Known bugs include the lack of support for CompactFlash cards.

There is or was also an attempt to design a Linux implementation (based on Kernel version 2.6) for the X50 and X51 families of Axims, but it is still in a very early stage with major hardware components and functions (such as the backlight, sound, PCMCIA/Compact Flash, Flash Memory, Wi-fi, Bluetooth and USB connectivity) inoperative.

There is a partially functional port of Google&#x27;s Android operation system to the Axim x51 under the AxDroid project. The current version of the build supports the Android Froyo release.

<doc id="1217798" wikidata="Q607725" url="?curid=1217798" title="Drive-By Truckers">
<text>Drive-By Truckers are an American rock band based in Athens, Georgia. Two of five current members (Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley) are originally from The Shoals region of northern Alabama and met as roommates at the University of North Alabama. The group also has roots in Richmond, Virginia.

The band currently consists of Mike Cooley (lead vocals, guitar, banjo), Patterson Hood (lead vocals, guitar), Brad Morgan (drums), Jay Gonzalez (keys, guitar, accordion, backing vocals), and Matt Patton (bass guitar, backing vocals). The line-up has undergone multiple changes since the band&#x27;s formation, with Cooley and Hood serving as the sole constants throughout. The band&#x27;s constant touring has developed a dedicated following.

== History ==
=== 1996–1999: Early days ===
Drive-By Truckers was cofounded by Patterson Hood (son of bassist David Hood of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section) and longtime friend, former roommate, and musical partner Mike Cooley in Athens, Georgia, in 1996. The two had played in various other bands including Adam&#x27;s House Cat, which was chosen as a top-10 Best Unsigned Band by a &quot;Musician&quot; contest in the late 1980s. Adam&#x27;s House Cat recordings, entitled &quot;Town Burned Down&quot; were released in September 2018 via ATO Records. After the demise of Adam&#x27;s House Cat, Cooley and Hood performed as a duo under the name Virgil Kane. They eventually started a new band, Horsepussy, with bassist-vocalist Adam Howell (later to join DBT) and Aaron Bryant (brother of DBT webmaster Jenn Bryant) before splitting for a few years. During this split, Hood moved to Athens and began forming what would become Drive-By Truckers, &quot;with the intent of luring Cooley back into the fold&quot;.

The band&#x27;s original lineup was fluid, but it most often included Hood, Cooley, and Howell, along with drummer Matt Lane, pedal steel player John Neff, and mandolin player Barry Sell. They released their first album &quot;Gangstabilly&quot; in 1998. With Hood and Cooley sometimes playing mandolin and banjo instead of guitar, and Howell playing double bass. After recording their first album, the band added a third guitarist/vocalist, Rob Malone. By the second album, &quot;Pizza Deliverance&quot;, released in 1999, Howell had left, Malone switched to bass, and Sell had left the band. Neff was also listed as a guest rather than a member, although he plays on much of the album. Hood dominated the songwriting and lead vocals in these early records, but Cooley, Howell, and Malone also contributed songs, with Cooley&#x27;s songwriting share increasing notably by the second album.

Following their second release, Lane was replaced by drummer Brad Morgan, who had already filled in for Lane during some of the band&#x27;s shows. Morgan went on to become the band&#x27;s other constant member along with Hood and Cooley. With Neff also having declined to remain a full-time band contributor, Hood and Cooley were left as the only original members. The band then embarked on a nationwide tour as a four-piece band, resulting in a live album entitled &quot;Alabama Ass Whuppin&#x27;&quot; (released in 2000 by Second Heaven Records, re-released in 2002 by Terminus Records and again in 2013 on ATO Records).

=== 2000–2001: &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot; ===
After three years on the road, a tight-knit group of musicians had emerged. Malone had switched back to guitar, giving the band a three-member guitar army like Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Earl Hicks, a friend who had previously been involved in the band&#x27;s production, took over the bass slot. They then began work on 2001&#x27;s double album, &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot;.

The album weaves the history of Lynyrd Skynyrd into a narrative about a fictitious rock band called Betamax Guillotine, whose story unfolds within the context of the South during the 1970s. &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot; was originally released independently on Drive-By Truckers&#x27; own Soul Dump Records on September 12, 2001, and garnered praise from fans and critics alike. To meet the new demand brought on by, among other things, a four-star review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot; was reissued by Mercury and Lost Highway Records in July 2002. Soon after, Drive-By Truckers were named Band of the Year by &quot;No Depression&quot;.

While Drive-By Truckers were touring in support of &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot;, the band ran into a problem when they were left with only two guitarists (Cooley and Hood) following the departure of Rob Malone in late 2001. The band added fellow Alabamian guitarist and songwriter Jason Isbell to their line-up as the band&#x27;s third guitarist. During his five years with Drive-By Truckers, Isbell&#x27;s compositions became as highly praised as those of Cooley and Hood.

=== 2001–2006: With Jason Isbell ===
After signing a new deal with Austin-based record label New West, Drive-By Truckers set about recording the follow-up to &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot;. The result was 2003&#x27;s &quot;Decoration Day&quot;, which like its predecessor, received much critical praise. It is another concept album, containing characters who are faced with hard decisions about marriage, incest, break-ups, revenge, murder, and suicide. The album features an eclectic mix of the band&#x27;s newer rootsy, hard-rocking sound with some of their older alt-country sound. Former member John Neff returned as a guest to play pedal steel on about half the album, although he did not tour with the band for the album.

After years of producing and playing with Drive-By Truckers, bassist Earl Hicks left the band on December 22, 2003. Hicks was immediately replaced by studio bassist Shonna Tucker, then-wife of guitarist Jason Isbell. Tucker had previously guested on &quot;Decoration Day&quot;, playing upright bass on the Cooley-penned track &quot;Sounds Better in the Song&quot;.

In 2004, Drive-By Truckers released yet another concept album entitled &quot;The Dirty South&quot;, which further explored the mythology of the South, with songs focusing on Sam Phillips and Sun Records, John Henry, and a three-song suite about Sheriff Buford Pusser. With Cooley and Isbell each contributing 4 songs on the 14-song set, it was the band&#x27;s first album for which Hood did not write the majority of songs.

After touring throughout 2004 and 2005, Drive-By Truckers found their way to the Fidelitorium Recording Studio in Forsyth County, North Carolina, during late 2005. These recording sessions, once again produced by David Barbe, resulted in the band&#x27;s seventh LP, &quot;A Blessing and a Curse&quot;. Released on April 18, 2006, &quot;A Blessing and a Curse&quot; showcased Drive-By Truckers&#x27; ability to branch out into new territory, and can be seen as the band&#x27;s attempt at shaking labeling by critics, detractors, fans, and followers, particularly the Southern rock label that has haunted the band since &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot;. The album sounds less like Lynyrd Skynyrd, and more closely resembles the bare-bones British rock of the early 1970s such as The Rolling Stones and Faces. Tom Petty, Blue Öyster Cult, and Neil Young&#x27;s influence on the band&#x27;s sound is more prominent on this album, as well.

On September 1, 2009, Drive-By Truckers released a collection of B-sides and rarities entitled &quot;The Fine Print: A Collection of Oddities and Rarities&quot; which were recorded during the &quot;Decoration Day&quot; and &quot;Dirty South&quot; sessions. Though released after he left the band, the album includes two tracks written by Jason Isbell.

=== 2006–2009: Changing lineup ===

In 2006, Drive-By Truckers reunited, both on-stage and on-record, with Athens-based, Savannah-born pedal steel guitarist John Neff. Neff had been featured on one song on &quot;A Blessing and a Curse&quot;. During the next year, Neff began touring with the band as an unofficial sixth member.

On April 5, 2007, Jason Isbell announced that he was no longer a member of the band. The following day, Patterson Hood confirmed the break on the official site. In his letter to the fans, Hood described the parting of ways as &quot;amicable&quot; and expressed the hope that fans would continue to support Drive-By Truckers, as well as Isbell&#x27;s solo efforts. In the same letter, Hood announced that Neff would become a full-time member, playing both guitar and pedal steel. Six years after Isbell&#x27;s departure from the band, he revealed the reported &quot;amicab[ility]&quot; of the split was a charade and that he had been forced out. Because his excessive drinking and drug use had made Isbell unreliable, Hood had asked him to take a break from the band; upon Isbell&#x27;s refusal, Cooley informed Isbell &quot;that isn&#x27;t going to work for us&quot;.

Shortly after Isbell&#x27;s departure, on April 20, 2007, Patterson Hood announced via the band&#x27;s website that a longtime friend of the Hood family, Spooner Oldham, would be joining the band playing keyboard for a string of acoustic performances called The Dirt Underneath Tour. This stripped-down tour set the writing mood and style for the band&#x27;s next release, 2008&#x27;s &quot;Brighter Than Creation&#x27;s Dark&quot;, a far more &quot;swampy&quot; and country record than its predecessor. &quot;Brighter Than Creation&#x27;s Dark&quot; went to number 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart and was billed as a gothic masterpiece. Spooner Oldham contributed to the recording of the album, and toured with the band in support of the record. The record boasted 19 tracks, clocked in at over 75 minutes (so the record&#x27;s vinyl format was released as a double album), and features the first song contributions from bassist Shonna Tucker. Keyboardist/backing vocalist Jay Gonzalez went on to tour with the band once Oldham stopped at the end of &quot;Brighter Than Creation&#x27;s Dark&quot;″s Home Front Tour.

On July 7, 2009, New West Records released the band&#x27;s second official live album and DVD called &quot;Live From Austin TX&quot;. Material from &quot;Brighter Than Creation&#x27;s Dark&quot; made up the majority of the mostly acoustic set-list. This was the first official release featuring Jay Gonzalez as the official sixth band member. Hood later recalled this recording as &quot;absolutely the best filmed performance our band has ever had&quot;.

=== 2009–2011: Departing New West Records ===
After being released from New West Records, the Drive-By Truckers entered the studio throughout periods of 2009 and emerged with two albums&#x27; worth of material. The songs were divided between &quot;The Big To Do&quot; (2010) and the Drive-By Truckers &quot;R&amp;B Murder Album&quot; &quot;Go-Go Boots&quot; (2011). &quot;The Big To-Do&quot; further brought media attention to the band, resulting in their highest chart success, appearances on David Letterman and Jimmy Fallon&#x27;s late night shows, and a scheduled tour opening for Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers. During a performance on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in June 2011, the band played a cover of Eddie Hinton&#x27;s song &quot;Everybody Needs Love&quot; and were asked by Letterman to play an encore. Along with John Hiatt, English band The Heavy and Alabama-based St. Paul and The Broken Bones, they are the only musical act ever asked to play an encore on his show. As the band&#x27;s contract with New West Records expired after &quot;The Fine Print&quot; was released, the band signed and released &quot;The Big To-Do&quot; and &quot;Go-Go Boots&quot; on ATO Records.

On April 17, 2010, the band released a single penned by Mike Cooley to commemorate Record Store Day. &quot;Your Woman Is a Living Thing&quot;/&quot;Just Maybe&quot; is the only record the Drive-By Truckers have released solely in a vinyl format. Digital downloads of the single can now be found on the band&#x27;s website, as well as Facebook. Based on the success of the single, the band decided to release a limited edition (2,500 copies) special 10-inch 45 with two new songs, &quot;The Thanksgiving Filter&quot;/&quot;Used to Be a Cop&quot;, on Black Friday of 2010. Both songs also appear on the album &quot;Go-Go Boots.&quot;

New West Records released &quot;Ugly Buildings, Whores, and Politicians: Greatest Hits 1998–2009&quot; on August 2, 2011. The announcement was immediately met with mixed receptions by fans.

=== 2011–2017: More lineup changes, &quot;English Oceans&quot; and &quot;American Band&quot; ===
On December 5, 2011, Patterson Hood announced via Facebook that bassist Shonna Tucker had left the Drive-By Truckers. He did not cite any of Tucker&#x27;s reasons for leaving the band and merely stated, &quot;we all love and respect her and wish her all of the best in everything she sets out for.&quot; David Barbe replaced Tucker for their subsequent shows until Matt Patton of The Dexateens joined the band for their spring 2012 tour. John Neff also departed on December 27, 2012; no third guitar replacement was announced, and all tours during 2013 consisted of Cooley and Hood on guitar with Gonzalez alternating between keyboard and guitar. Since that time, Gonzalez has continued to play both keyboards and guitar, allowing the band to duplicate their trademark three-guitar sound when necessary.

During the Drive-By Truckers&#x27; 2013 New Year&#x27;s Eve show at the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., an expanded vinyl release of their first live album, &quot;Alabama Ass Whuppin&#x27;&quot; was announced to be released in 2013.

On August 3, 2013, Hood&#x27;s Instagram account revealed the band had begun recording their next album at Chase Park Transduction in Athens. Released on March 4, 2014, &quot;English Oceans&quot; showed that Gonzalez had become an official member of the band. Reduced to five members again, the band showcased a more simple and direct hard-rocking style on the album. The album debuted at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, which represented the best charting of their career.

The band released no new studio album in 2015, but instead released a sprawling live album entitled &quot;It&#x27;s Great to Be Alive&quot;. The album was recorded over a three-night run at the Fillmore in San Francisco, on November 20, 21 and 22, 2014.

The band released their 11th album, &quot;American Band&quot;, on September 30, 2016. The album featured the same line-up as &quot;English Oceans&quot;, and featured the most politically oriented lyrics of the band&#x27;s career. A 2017 article in Australia&#x27;s &quot;Overland&quot; literary magazine suggested, with reference to &quot;American Band&quot;, that &quot;no-one in the modern era is making stronger protest music than this Athens, Georgia band&quot;. They announced a tour in support of the record, the Darkened Flags Tour, in June of the same year.

In November 2017, they released the politically charged single &quot;The Perilous Night&quot;, showing a continuation of their increased focus on protest songs.

=== 2018–present: &quot;The Unraveling&quot;, &quot;The New OK&quot; and &quot;Welcome 2 Club XIII&quot;===

On September 11, 2018, the band shared a photo via their Instagram page alluding that they were currently working on their 12th studio album. The album, titled &quot;The Unraveling&quot;, was released on January 31, 2020, making it the longest gap between studio albums for the band so far.

On June 17, 2020, NPR published an opinion piece by Patterson Hood, wherein he apologized for the band&#x27;s name and called it &quot;a drunken joke that was never intended to be in rotation and reckoned with two-and-a-half decades later&quot;.

On September 30, 2020, just eight months after the release of &quot;The Unraveling&quot;, the band announced their thirteenth studio album, &quot;The New OK&quot;. It was made available on all streaming platforms the following Friday.

On April 12, 2022, the band announced their fourteenth studio album, &quot;Welcome 2 Club XIII&quot; and released the album&#x27;s title track as the first promotional single. The title derives from the venue where founding members Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley performed at the start of their careers.

On March 21, 2024, Drive-By Truckers announced the &quot;Southern Rock Opera Revisited 2024 Tour&quot; which will feature full-length live performances of that album in the summer and autumn of 2024 for, per the band, &quot;very likely the last time.&quot;

== Work with others ==
In 2007, Drive-By Truckers backed up Bettye LaVette on her comeback album &quot;The Scene of the Crime&quot;, which was released on September 25 on Anti Records. &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; was mostly recorded at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. On it, LaVette transforms country and rock songs written by Willie Nelson, Elton John, and Don Henley, among others, into devastating mini-dramas. &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for &quot;Best Contemporary Blues Album&quot; and landed on numerous &quot;Best of 2007&quot; lists. Drive-By Truckers frontman Patterson Hood produced the album alongside LaVette. The album also features one song cowritten by LaVette and Hood.

Drive-By Truckers backed up Booker T. Jones on his instrumental album &quot;Potato Hole&quot;, which was released on April 21, 2009. Neil Young also contributed over-dubbed guitar work to the album; the Drive-By Truckers and he never met in studio. &quot;Potato Hole&quot; features a re-recording of the Cooley penned track &quot;Space City&quot;, which originally was released on the album &quot;A Blessing And A Curse&quot;. The band performed with Jones as &quot;Booker T and the DBTs&quot; at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival on June 14, 2009. On January 31, 2010, &quot;Potato Hole&quot; won the Best Pop Instrumental Album award at the 52nd Grammy Awards.

In late 2009, Barr Weissman released a documentary on the Drive-By Truckers entitled &quot;The Secret To A Happy Ending.&quot; The film follows the band over three particularly straining years of their career, and captures their near break up, as well as the departure of Jason Isbell from the band.

== Musical style ==

Drive-By Truckers&#x27; musical style has incorporated elements of rock and roll, Southern rock, country, punk rock, cowpunk, pop punk, blues, soul, Southern soul and R&amp;B. Cited influences on the band include The Clash, Richard Hell and The Voidoids, The Jim Carroll Band, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Goodie Mob, OutKast, Loretta Lynn, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Ferlin Husky, Lefty Frizzell, Hank Snow, Hank Williams Sr., Hank Williams Jr., Red Sovine, Red Foley, Merle Haggard, Tom T. Hall, Townes Van Zandt, Neil Young and Lynyrd Skynyrd. The band&#x27;s music has been classified as Southern rock, country rock, rock and roll, alternative country, R&amp;B, arena rock, country, emo country, folk rock, hard rock, indie rock, neo-Southern rock, post-cowpunk, roots rock, Southern Gothic and Southern soul.

Drive-By Truckers&#x27; lyrics are noted for expressing the progressive political views of the band, particularly band member and songwriter Patterson Hood. Jonathan Bernstein, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, described &quot;American Band&quot; as the group&#x27;s most politically charged album, describing the songs as &quot;blunt, pissed-off Trump-era anthems&quot;, nearly half which deal with gun violence. The song &quot;Ramon Casiano&quot; is about the little known story of gun rights advocate and former NRA leader Harlon Carter, who shot and killed a 15-year-old Hispanic boy in 1931, but escaped incarceration. Hood wrote &quot;What it Means&quot; in response to the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, unarmed black teenagers whose killings sparked the Black Lives Matter movement. “Surrender Under Protest,” “Ever South,” and “Guns of Umpqua” examine generations of racial injustice in a country that &quot;shoots first and asks questions later.&quot; &quot;Once They Banned Imagine&quot; discusses censorship of art in times of crisis, particularly after the September 11 attacks. Band member and songwriter Mike Cooley recalled that &quot;After the 9/11 attacks, Clear Channel put out that list of songs that their stations shouldn’t play. I couldn’t get my head around the notion that John Lennon’s &quot;Imagine&quot; was on that list, that it was something we didn’t need to hear at a time when it was exactly what we needed to hear. The Red Scare, the War on Crime, the War on Terrorism, they’re just excuses for cracking down on anything the establishment finds objectionable.” The follow-up album, &quot;The Unraveling&quot;, continues the band&#x27;s political songwriting, with &quot;Thoughts and Prayers&quot; and &quot;Babies in Cages&quot; discussing the issues of gun violence and the Trump administration family separation policy directly. &quot;The New OK&quot; contained songs written in response to the Black Lives Matter protests in Portland, Oregon and the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Online presence and artwork ===
The band&#x27;s online presence was created in 1996, and is still maintained by long-time friend Jenn Bryant. It has been credited with helping the band gain momentum. The band also began to use another long-time friend, Wes Freed, to produce the band&#x27;s signature visual style with his cover art and posters. Freed continued his collaborative work with them until his death in 2022. In March 2014, the newly debuted &quot;English Oceans&quot; album cover was named Album Art of the Month by &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; editor Dan Caffrey. However, the band&#x27;s constant touring and lauded live shows largely developed their dedicated following.

<doc id="1217802" wikidata="Q5441949" url="?curid=1217802" title="Felipe Birriel">
<text>Felipe Birriel Fernández, also known as &quot;El Gigante de Carolina&quot; (Carolina&#x27;s Giant) (August 16, 1916 – March 15, 1994) is considered to have been the tallest Puerto Rican, with an unconfirmed height of .

==Early years==
Birriel was born in the Barrazas barrio of Carolina, Puerto Rico. He was the third of nine children born to Juan Pedro Birriel y Birriel (1878-1967), a farmer, and Dionisia Fernández Fernández (1890-1985). His highest level of education was up to the second grade in elementary school. As a child, Birriel was sent to the farm fields where he helped his parents plant vegetable seeds. He also worked in the fields picking fruits and coffee beans and as a waterboy, delivered water to the sugar cane workers.

In 1932, when Birriel was 16 years old, he started to grow at an alarming rate. One day, he went to visit a doctor because he felt sick with dizzy spells and because he was also feeling weak. The doctor informed Birriel that for some unknown reason, his pituitary gland had developed a tumor. Even though the condition did not have a known cure, it was still treatable.

==Condition treatment==
The treatment required a radio therapy machine which could only be found in the United States. The machine was sent in 1932, but it was not until 1941—nine years later—that it finally arrived in Puerto Rico.

==Later years==
Birriel lived with his brother and sister-in-law in the town of Carolina and became something of a folk hero and known as &quot;El Gigante de Carolina&quot; (The Giant of Carolina). He appeared in the film &quot;Flight of the Lost Balloon&quot; filmed in Puerto Rico in 1961. In 1974, during the celebration of the FIBA World Basketball Championships celebrated in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Birriel was the guest of honor and was invited to the basketball court, in front of all the spectators he dunked the ball without jumping, a standing ovation followed.

The Government of Puerto Rico and local businessmen helped him economically, since his daily personal needs could not be met with the money that he earned in personal appearances. The owners of local furniture stores also helped Birriel by making furniture especially for him. His health, however had worsened progressively and he died from a heart attack on March 15, 1994, at the age of 77, in Carolina, Puerto Rico. He was buried at Cementerio Municipal La Santa Cruz in Carolina, Puerto Rico.

Birriel was unique in reaching a relatively old age while being as tall as he was; most extremely tall people tend to experience serious disabling medical conditions such as the ones that eventually crippled, and then killed, Robert Wadlow (the tallest human during his lifetime) at an early age.

==Honors==
The town of Carolina is also known as the &quot;Land of Giants&quot; in honor of Birriel. Carolina also unveiled a mural which states the following: &quot;Carolina, Tierra de Gigantes&quot; (Carolina, Land of Giants). The BSN basketball team of Carolina is called &quot;Los Gigantes de Carolina&quot; (The Carolina Giants) and the town has dedicated a museum to the memory of Birriel and has also named a street &quot;El Paseo Felipe Birriel&quot;.

Wanda de Jesús Arvelo, an author from Carolina wrote a children&#x27;s book about Birriel&#x27;s life titled &quot;Felipe Corazón de Gigantes&quot;.

<text>Education has always been a priority in the Salt Lake City, Utah. In 1847 pioneer Jane Dillworth held the first classes in her tent for the children of the first Mormon families. By 1850 many schools had already sprung up around the valley, and there were plans for a school attached to every wardhouse. In 1851 the territorial legislature passed the first public school law creating the office of the superintendent of schools. Many large Mormon families, such as Brigham Young&#x27;s, had their own schools, known as &quot;family schools&quot;.

In the last part of the 19th century, there was much controversy over how children in the area should be educated. Mormon influence in public schools created problems with non-Mormon parents, and raised issues about public school supervision. Mormons became upset about the number of private Protestant schools popping up. The schools would offer free tuition to Mormon students in order to convert them. Westminster College, although now a secular four-year college, is the last remaining example of these schools. LDS Church members also resented non-Mormon influences in the public schools and began to focus once again on efforts to develop church-run schools.

Many Mormon youths in grades 9–12 attend some form of religious instruction, referred to as seminary. In years past students would attend during school hours and even receive credit for it. Although many still attend during school hours, they no longer receive any credit.

Due to high birth rates and large classrooms Utah spends less per capita on students than any other state. Money is always a challenge and many businesses donate to support schools. Several districts have set up foundations to raise money.

<text>David Charles Stove (15 September 1927 – 2 June 1994) was an Australian philosopher whose writings often challenged prevailing academic orthodoxy. He was known for his critiques of postmodernism, feminism, and multiculturalism.

==Philosophy==
His work in philosophy of science included criticisms of David Hume&#x27;s inductive scepticism. He offered a positive response to the problem of induction in his 1986 work, &quot;The Rationality of Induction&quot;. In &quot;Popper and After: Four Modern Irrationalists&quot;, Stove attacked the leading philosophers of science, Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos, and Paul Feyerabend, on the grounds that their commitment to the thesis that all logic is deductive led to skepticism.

In 1985 Stove held a competition to find the &quot;worst argument in the world&quot;, and awarded the prize to himself for the argument &quot;we can know things only under our forms of understanding/as they are related to us, etc, therefore we cannot know things as they are in themselves&quot;. He called this argument &quot;The Gem&quot; and argued that it appeared widely in various forms.

His book &quot;The Plato Cult and Other Philosophical Follies&quot; contains the influential essay &quot;What Is Wrong With Our Thoughts?&quot;. According to philosopher Nicholas Shackel, this essay showed that &quot;there are indefinitely many ways of cheating intellectually and for most there is no simple way to put one’s finger on how the cheat is effected.&quot; In the book, he also coined the phrase Horror Victorianorum (terror of the Victorian), an extreme distaste or condemnation of Victorian culture, art and design. 

Stove was also a critic of sociobiology, describing it as a new religion in which genes play the role of gods.

==Politics==

Stove and David M. Armstrong both resisted what they saw as attempts by Marxists to infiltrate the Faculty of Arts at the University of Sydney. In 1984–85 Stove protested publicly that the faculty was favouring women in appointments.

In &quot;A Farewell to Arts&quot;, Stove wrote that he abandoned Marxism when he discovered &quot;what real intellectual work was&quot;.

In his essay &quot;Why You Should be A Conservative&quot;, Stove argued that actions can have unforeseen and unwelcome consequences; that just because something is wrong or evil, it does not follow that the world would be better off without it; and that a decline in respect for life and property had led to a decline in quality of life.

In &quot;Racial and Other Antagonisms&quot; (1989) Stove asserted that racism is not a form of prejudice but common sense: &quot;Almost everyone unites in declaring &#x27;racism&#x27; false and detestable. Yet absolutely everyone knows it is true&quot;.

In &quot;The Intellectual Capacity of Women&quot; (1990) he stated his belief that &quot;the intellectual capacity of women is on the whole inferior to that of men&quot;.

==Legacy==

Since his death in 1994 four collections of his writings have been published. Two were edited by art critic Roger Kimball: &quot;Against the Idols of the Age&quot; and &quot;Darwinian Fairytales&quot;. Kimball also wrote the foreword to &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong With Benevolence&quot;, in which he writes &quot;The most thrilling intellectual discovery of my adult life came in 1996 when I chanced upon the work of the Australian philosopher David Stove&quot;.

==Personal life==

With his wife Jessie, he had two children, Judith and R. J. Stove.

Stove enjoyed cricket, baroque music and gardening.

Stove committed suicide after being diagnosed with esophageal cancer.

<doc id="1217826" wikidata="Q7488540" url="?curid=1217826" title="Shanghai rum">
<text>Shanghai rum is a Rummy card game, based on gin rummy and a variation of Contract rummy played by 3 to 8 players. It is also known as California rummy.

==Play==
===Basics===
Shanghai Rummy is played with multiple decks of 54 standard playing cards, including the Jokers. Two decks are required for a game of up to four players. Five or six players require three decks. Aces are high (above a King) or low, (below 2). Each game has ten hands, and the rules for each hand are unique. One person begins as dealer for the first hand, and then the person to the dealer&#x27;s left becomes dealer for the next hand, and so on. Each player is dealt eleven cards for each of the ten rounds. The rest of the deck is then placed face down in the middle of the players; this is referred to as the deck. One card is taken from the top of the deck and placed face up next to it. This card is called the upcard and becomes the beginning of the discard pile.

Each player has a choice at the beginning of their turn. They may either pick up one new card from the top of the deck or take the upcard. (Also, the other players in the game have the ability to get the upcard.) After the player draws their card, either from the deck or the upcard, they must then choose any card in their hand to discard, and they then place this card face up on the discard pile. That card then becomes the new upcard, which the next player in turn can take or other players can buy. To get a card that isn&#x27;t yours a player must say, “BUY&quot;, before the next player draws their card, or else it is already considered &quot;dead&quot;. Once a player discards their card, the card underneath that card is now considered a &quot;dead&quot; card because it is no longer in the game. Players may not take these cards.

===Jokers===
Jokers are wild cards and can be played in the place of any card. A player is not allowed to have more jokers than face-cards in either a set or run. An example of this would be if one is trying to get a set one must have three or more cards of the same rank (8/8/8). But if a player has a joker or 2 they could play in place of an 8 (8/8/joker). But a player cannot lay more jokers than face-cards (8/joker/joker). However they may lay the &quot;same&quot; number of jokers as face-cards (8/8/joker/joker). The same applies for runs. If a player has laid down and has a joker in a run or set, the joker can be replaced by the appropriate card by any player. If a player who has not laid down yet replaces any joker they must lay down their meld in that turn, but if the player has already laid down their meld they may take the joker and use it how they choose anytime.

===Buying===
A &quot;buy&quot; is when an out-of-turn player takes the upcard, draws 2 extra cards from the stock, and cannot play the cards immediately, but must wait for their turn. If more than one player wants it, the one closest to the dealer&#x27;s left has precedence. There is a limit to the number of buys allowed. Each player is only allowed 3 buys per hand in the first 8 rounds. During rounds 9 and 10, each player is allowed 4 buys per hand.

===Melding===
The object of each hand is to come up with the correct combination of cards to be able to meld, or &quot;lay out&quot;. The combination for each hand is different, and they become more difficult with each subsequent hand. The combinations for each hand are either sets or runs (sequence) or a combination of both. A set is a combination of a specific number of cards of the same rank, and the suit is not important. An example of a &quot;set of 3&quot; is three cards that are all 8&#x27;s, and the 8&#x27;s can all be of different suits. A run is a combination of a specific number of cards of the same suit that have consecutive ranks. An example of a &quot;run of 4&quot; is the 4, 5, 6, and 7 of clubs. An example of a combination for a hand is for hand #2, &quot;1 set of 3 and 1 run of 4.&quot; This means that a player must have both a set of 3 cards and a run of 4 cards in their hand before they can meld. A set needs a minimum of 3 cards while a run needs a minimum of 4 cards. A player can meld only when it is their turn. As always, they must start their hand by drawing a card, then when they have the correct sequence of cards, they can meld or &quot;go down.&quot; They do so by laying their meld cards face up on the table in their correct sequence. After melding, a player can then play on the melds of other players. When done, they must then discard.

===Play for the player who has gone down===
When a player is &quot;down&quot; (meaning they have already melded), they still take their turn in turn with the other players, and they still must draw a card and discard. However, a player who is down cannot buy a card, nor can they stop a player from buying the top card in the discard pile when it is their turn. A player who is down can &quot;play their cards&quot; on the melds that have been completed either by themself or by other players. For example, if a player has laid down a set of 8&#x27;s, and on a subsequent turn they then draw another 8, they can play this 8 on their set of 8&#x27;s. They do this by placing the 8 with the set of 8&#x27;s. If they have a card that they would like to play on a run, they must be sure to keep the order of the run. For example, if there is a run of 5 consisting of 4-5-6-7-8 of clubs, the player can play a 3 of clubs or a 9 of clubs.

===Winning the game===
Play progresses until the final hand when one of the players &quot;goes out,&quot; meaning they are able to &quot;play&quot; the last card in their hand. Although players may discard throughout the game, to win they &quot;must&quot; be able to lay down all of their cards without discarding. In order to win, on a player&#x27;s turn they must be able to draw a card and then go out without a discard. The winner of the hand gets zero points, and the other players count their cards to determine their score for the hand. After all ten hands are played, the winner is the player with the lowest score.

The point values for the cards are:
3s–9s: 5 points
10s-Kings: 10 points
Aces: 15 points
2s= 20 Points
Joker: 25 points

==Sequence of hands==

10 cards = 3 sets of 3

11 cards = 2 sets of 3, 1 run of 4

12 cards = 1 set of 3, 2 runs of 4

13 cards = 3 runs of 4

13 cards = 4 sets of 3

14 cards = 3 sets of 3, 1 run of 4

15 cards = 2 sets of 3, 2 runs of 4

16 cards = 3 runs of 4, 1 set of 3

17 cards = 4 runs of 4

<text>The Fixx are a rock band from London, England, founded in 1979. The band&#x27;s hits include &quot;One Thing Leads to Another&quot;, &quot;Saved by Zero&quot;, &quot;Are We Ourselves?&quot;, and &quot;Secret Separation&quot;, each of which charted in the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, as well as Mainstream Rock chart hits &quot;Red Skies&quot;, &quot;Stand or Fall&quot;, &quot;Driven Out&quot; and &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot;, which was featured on the soundtrack of the 1984 film &quot;Streets of Fire&quot;.

== Early years as Portraits and The Fixx (1979–1981)==
College friends Cy Curnin on vocals and Adam Woods on drums formed the group in London in 1979, initially calling themselves Portraits. The pair placed an ad for additional members, and recruited keyboardist Rupert Greenall, guitarist Tony McGrail and bassist Russell Mckenzie, the last of whom was later replaced by Charlie Barrett. Portraits issued two singles for Ariola Records: &quot;Little Women&quot; (1979), and &quot;Hazards In The Home&quot; (1980).

Later in 1980, McGrail left. At this point, the band added guitarist Jamie West-Oram (formerly of Phillip Rambow&#x27;s band) and changed their name to The Fixx. This version of the band recorded for 101 Records, releasing their first single (&quot;Lost Planes&quot;) in February 1981. This track, along with several live tracks issued by 101 on various compilations, received some radio exposure on the BBC. In these early days, West-Oram was billed simply as &#x27;Jamie West&#x27;.

The Fixx&#x27;s raised profile eventually led to the group being offered a contract by MCA Records. Worried about the potential drug-user implication of the band&#x27;s name, MCA insisted on a name change before signing them to the label. A compromise was reached as the band altered the spelling of their name to The Fixx, and a deal was duly signed.

==MCA and RCA years (1982–1991)==
Barrett left The Fixx just after the recording of their first album, &quot;Shuttered Room&quot;, in 1982. This album featured the band&#x27;s initial hits, &quot;Stand or Fall&quot; and &quot;Red Skies&quot;, both of which charted in the US and the UK. The band found particular success in Canada, where &quot;Stand or Fall&quot; reached No. 37. &quot;Stand or Fall&quot; entered the charts in the US on 30 October 1982.

Barrett was replaced on bass by Alfie Agius for the &quot;Shuttered Room&quot; tour. Agius&#x27; stay in the band was short-lived, though, as he left during the 1983 recording of their next album &quot;Reach the Beach&quot;, after having recorded four tracks. Agius is credited as co-writer on all the album&#x27;s tracks, but the group for this album was officially credited as a quartet (Curnin, Greenall, West-Oram and Woods). Agius went on to briefly tour with the hard rock/heavy metal band Fastway that same year.

&quot;Reach the Beach&quot;, produced by star producer Rupert Hine, became the group&#x27;s most commercially successful album and was certified Platinum by the RIAA on 5 January 1984. Agius&#x27; bass work is featured on the album&#x27;s first two singles &quot;Saved by Zero&quot; and &quot;One Thing Leads to Another.&quot; Both these singles cracked the US top 40, and &quot;One Thing Leads To Another&quot; became the band&#x27;s biggest-ever hit (No. 1 Canada, No. 4 US). It was during these sessions that bassist Dan K. Brown joined the band. Brown played bass on the third top 40 single from the album, &quot;The Sign Of Fire&quot; and continued with the band on its subsequent tour. Brown became a full member of the band thereafter.

Curnin and West-Oram played on &quot;I Might Have Been Queen&quot; and &quot;Better Be Good To Me&quot; by Tina Turner on her 1984 album &quot;Private Dancer&quot;.

The 1984 album &quot;Phantoms&quot; contained the hits &quot;Are We Ourselves?&quot; (#29 Can.), the first video in which a mobile phone ever appeared (a modified Motorola KR999), and &quot;Sunshine In The Shade.&quot; Another single, &quot;Deeper And Deeper,&quot; was initially released as the B-side of &quot;Are We Ourselves?&quot; (and also appeared in an edited version on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Streets of Fire&quot;) as well as on the extended 12&quot; version of &quot;Less Cities, More Moving People&quot; in the UK. This track received substantial airplay on U.S. and Canadian modern rock radio stations.

In 1985 the Fixx recorded the song &quot;A Letter to Both Sides&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Fletch&quot;. In 1986, they released their fourth album, &quot;Walkabout&quot;, featuring &quot;Secret Separation&quot; (No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Album Rock&quot; chart, No. 49 in Canada) and &quot;Built for the Future.&quot; The 1987 album &quot;React&quot;, was a compilation of both live and new studio material, after which the band would depart MCA Records.

In 1989, the Fixx released their first album in nearly three years and only release on RCA Records, &quot;Calm Animals&quot;, which contained another hit &quot;Driven Out&quot; (another No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s &quot;Album Rock&quot; chart).

The band signed to Impact (Distributed by MCA) for their next album, 1991&#x27;s &quot;Ink&quot;. The album featured &quot;How Much Is Enough?&quot; (No. 27 Canada, No. 35 US).

==Recent years (1992–present)==
Dan K. Brown took a hiatus from the band in 1994. He was not officially replaced, and the band used session musicians on bass in his stead, with Chris Tait playing bass on most recordings and live shows from 1995 through the early 2000s. The four-man line-up (with contributions from Tait and other sessioneers) recorded 1998&#x27;s &quot;Elemental&quot;, as well as the 1999 album &quot;1011 Woodland&quot;, on which they re-recorded a selection of previous hits and album tracks.

In 2002, the Fixx performed Nancy Sinatra&#x27;s 1960s classic &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot; for an album of cover versions of songs from the 1960s to 1990s called &quot;When Pigs Fly&quot;.

In 2003, the band released their ninth studio album, &quot;Want That Life&quot;. Gary Tibbs (formerly a member of Roxy Music, The Vibrators and Adam and the Ants) played bass for this album.

Long-time bassist Dan K. Brown rejoined the band in 2008, replacing Tibbs. They celebrated 25 years of making music together, with the release of the double-CD &quot;Twenty-fifth Anniversary Anthology&quot; compilation.

With the classic lineup back intact, the Fixx released their 10th studio album, &quot;Beautiful Friction&quot;, on 17 July 2012. The Fixx regularly tour the world.

On 5 November 2021, The Fixx announced on their website a new single called &quot;Wake Up&quot;. The song also featured on their most recent album, &quot;Every Five Seconds&quot;, released 3 June 2022. &quot;Woman of Flesh and Blood&quot; and &quot;Closer&quot; are two more singles from the album.

On 10 November 2023 the band released a newly-recorded single &quot;Winter&#x27;s Time&quot; backed with &quot;Someone Like You&quot; a track recorded initially during the &quot;Every Five Seconds&quot; sessions.

<text>Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park near Brownsville, Texas, United States, is a National Park Service unit which preserves the grounds of the May 8, 1846, Battle of Palo Alto. It was the first major conflict in a border dispute that soon precipitated the Mexican–American War. The United States Army victory here made the invasion of Mexico possible. The historic site portrays the battle and the war, and its causes and consequences, from the perspectives of both the United States and Mexico.

The National Park Service has acquired a little more than a third of the authorized land for the park, including the southern core battlefield tract, which served as the location for Mexican forces during the Battle of Palo Alto. Private landowners still control some of the battlefield. Honey Mesquite (&quot;Prosopis glandulosa&quot;), although a native plant, is present in an unusually high concentration, altering the cultural landscape and threatening the natural and cultural resources at the park.

The park&#x27;s visitor center features exhibits about the battle and the Mexican–American War, as well as a 15-minute video titled &quot;War on the Rio Grande&quot;. A half-mile trail leads to an overlook of the battlefield and includes interpretive panels.

== Background ==
The Battle of Palo Alto, fought on May 8, 1846, near modern Brownsville, Texas, was the first battle of the Mexican–American War. On April 30, 1846, Mexican federal troops under the command of General Mariano Arista crossed the Rio Grande into the disputed territory east of the river with the intention of attacking American General Zachary Taylor&#x27;s forward base, Fort Texas. Taylor, expecting Fort Texas to be invested, took his main force approximately 20 miles east to protect his main supply base, Fort Polk, leaving 500 men, under Major Jacob Brown, to garrison the forward base. Arista&#x27;s investment of Fort Texas began on May 3 and continued for several days, during which time Major Brown was mortally wounded. On May 7 Taylor departed Fort Polk, on the coast near Port Isabel, and began to move west towards the relief of Fort Texas. Arista, given timely intelligence of Taylor&#x27;s departure, moved his main force to block Taylor along the Port Isabel Road. The two armies met the next day, May 8, when Taylor&#x27;s columns engaged the Mexican line around 2 P.M. The Americans repulsed an initial cavalry charge to their right, and were then able to advance 1,000 yards when a grass fire forced Arista&#x27;s line back. After a second failed cavalry charge, Arista advanced on the American left but was driven back by the quick and accurate fire of the American light artillery. Eager to seize the initiative from Arista, a mixed force of infantry and dragoons pressed forward against the retreating Mexican right, eventually driving them from the field. After dusk ended the fighting, Arista began to pull his forces away from the battlefield to a more defensible position in a dry river bed to the south. Taylor pursued the following day, leading to the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, on May 9.

While the battle was a clear American victory and casualties were very light, 5 dead and 43 wounded, two of the dead were the resolute commander of Fort Texas, Major Brown, and the innovative artillery officer Major Samuel Ringgold, whose fast and mobile &quot;flying artillery&quot; would continue to be a major advantage to Taylor throughout the campaign.

==Administrative history==

Palo Alto Battlefield was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 19, 1960. It became Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Site on November 10, 1978, with a boundary change authorized on June 23, 1992. Establishing legislation in 1991 () was sponsored by Rep. Solomon Ortiz.

On March 30, 2009 the site was redesignated a National Historical Park, and the park was expanded to include the Resaca de la Palma Battlefield, which is a separate 34 acres inside the Brownsville city limits.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 authorized the addition of Fort Brown (166 acres) to Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park if a study finds it feasible.

<text>A spectrohelioscope is a type of solar telescope designed by George Ellery Hale in 1924 to allow the Sun to be viewed in a selected wavelength of light. The name comes from Latin- and Greek-based words: &quot;Spectro,&quot; referring to the optical spectrum, &quot;helio,&quot; referring to the Sun, and &quot;scope,&quot; as in telescope.

The basic spectrohelioscope is a complex machine that uses a spectroscope to scan the surface of the Sun. The image from the objective lens is focused on a narrow slit revealing only a thin portion of the Sun&#x27;s surface. The light is then passed through a prism or diffraction grating to spread the light into a spectrum. The spectrum is then focused on another slit that allows only a narrow part of the spectrum (the desired wavelength of light for viewing) to pass. The light is finally focused on an eyepiece so the surface of the Sun can be seen. The view, however, would be only a narrow strip of the Sun&#x27;s surface. The slits are moved in unison to scan across the whole surface of the Sun giving a full image. Independently nodding mirrors can be used instead of moving slits to produce the same scan: the first mirror selects a slice of the Sun, the second selects the desired wavelength.

The spectroheliograph is a similar device, but images the Sun at a particular wavelength photographically and is still in use in professional observatories.

<doc id="1217873" wikidata="Q2438791" url="?curid=1217873" title="The Feminine Mystique">
<text>The Feminine Mystique is a book by American author Betty Friedan, widely credited with sparking second-wave feminism in the United States. First published by W. W. Norton on February 19, 1963, &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; became a bestseller, initially selling over a million copies. Friedan used the book to challenge the widely shared belief that &quot;fulfillment as a woman had only one definition for American women after 1949—the housewife-mother.&quot;

In 1957, Friedan was asked to conduct a survey of her former Smith College classmates for their 15th anniversary reunion; the results, in which she found that many of them were unhappy with their lives as housewives, prompted her to begin research for &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;, conducting interviews with other suburban housewives, as well as researching psychology, media, and advertising. She originally intended to create an article on the topic, not a book, but no magazine would publish the work.

The phrase &quot;feminine mystique&quot; was coined by Friedan to describe the assumptions that women would be fulfilled from their housework, marriage, sexual lives, and children. The prevailing belief was that women who were truly feminine should not want to work, get an education, or have political opinions. Friedan wanted to prove that women were unsatisfied and could not voice their feelings.

==Synopsis==
&quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; begins with an introduction describing what Friedan called &quot;the problem that has no name&quot;—the widespread unhappiness of women in the 1950s and early 1960s. She discusses the lives of several housewives from around the United States who were unhappy despite living in material comfort and being married with children. Friedan also questions the women&#x27;s magazine, women&#x27;s education system, and advertisers for creating this widespread image of women. The detrimental effects induced by this image were that it cornered women into the domestic sphere, and that it led many women to lose their own identities.

Chapter 1: Friedan points out that the average age of marriage was dropping, the portion of women attending college was decreasing and the birthrate was increasing for women throughout the 1950s, yet the widespread trend of unhappy women persisted, although American culture insisted that fulfillment for women could be found in marriage and housewifery. Although aware of and sharing this dissatisfaction, women in the 1950s misinterpreted it as an individual problem and rarely talked about it with other women. As Friedan pointed out, &quot;part of the strange newness of the problem is that it cannot be understood in terms of the age-old material problems of man: poverty, sickness, hunger, cold.&quot; This chapter concludes by declaring: &quot;We can no longer ignore that voice within women that says: &#x27;I want something more than my husband and my children and my home.

Chapter 2: Friedan states that the editorial decisions concerning women&#x27;s magazines at the time were being made mostly by men, who insisted on stories and articles that showed women as either happy housewives or unhappy careerists, thus creating the &quot;feminine mystique&quot;—the idea that women were naturally fulfilled by devoting their lives to being housewives and mothers. Friedan also states that this is in contrast to the 1930s, at which time women&#x27;s magazines often featured confident and independent heroines, many of whom were involved in careers.

Chapter 3: Friedan recalls her own decision to conform to society&#x27;s expectations by giving up her promising career in psychology to raise children, and shows that other young women still struggled with the same kind of decision. Many women dropped out of school early to marry, afraid that if they waited too long or became too educated, they would not be able to attract a husband. Friedan argues at the end of the chapter that although theorists discuss how men need to find their identity, women are expected to be autonomous. She states, &quot;Anatomy is woman&#x27;s destiny, say the theorists of femininity; the identity of woman is determined by her biology.&quot; Friedan goes on to argue that the problem is women needing to mature and find their human identity: &quot;In a sense that goes beyond any woman&#x27;s life, I think this is a crisis of women growing up—a turning point from an immaturity that has been called femininity to full human identity.&quot;

Chapter 4: Friedan discusses early American feminists and how they fought against the assumption that the proper role of a woman was to be solely a wife and mother. She notes that they secured important rights for women, including education, the right to pursue a career, and the right to vote.

Chapter 5: In this chapter, Friedan, who had a degree in psychology, criticizes the founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud (whose ideas were very influential in the United States at the time of the book&#x27;s publication). She notes that Freud saw women as childlike and destined to be housewives, once pointing out that Freud wrote, &quot;I believe that all reforming action in law and education would break down in front of the fact that, long before the age at which a man can earn a position in society, Nature has determined woman&#x27;s destiny through beauty, charm, and sweetness. Law and custom have much to give women that has been withheld from them, but the position of women will surely be what it is: in youth an adored darling and in mature years a loved wife.&quot; Friedan also points out that Freud&#x27;s unproven concept of &quot;penis envy&quot; had been used to label women who wanted careers as neurotic, and that the popularity of Freud&#x27;s work and ideas elevated the &quot;feminine mystique&quot; of female fulfillment in housewifery into a &quot;scientific religion&quot; that most women were not educated enough to criticize.

Chapter 6: Friedan criticizes functionalism, which attempted to make the social sciences more credible by studying the institutions of society as if they were parts of a social body, as in biology. Institutions were studied in terms of their function in society, and women were confined to their sexual biological roles as housewives and mothers as well as told that doing otherwise would upset the social balance. Friedan points out that this is unproven and that Margaret Mead, a prominent functionalist, had a flourishing career as an anthropologist.

Chapter 7: Friedan discusses the change in women&#x27;s education from the 1940s to the early 1960s, in which many women&#x27;s schools concentrated on non-challenging classes that focused mostly on marriage, family, and other subjects deemed suitable for women, as educators influenced by functionalism felt that too much education would spoil women&#x27;s femininity and capacity for sexual fulfillment. Friedan says that this change in education arrested girls in their emotional development at a young age, because they never had to face the painful identity crisis and subsequent maturation that comes from dealing with many adult challenges.

Chapter 8: Friedan notes that the uncertainties and fears during World War II and the Cold War made Americans long for the comfort of home, so they tried to create an idealized home life with the father as breadwinner and the mother as housewife. Friedan notes that this was helped along by the fact that many of the women who worked during the war filling jobs previously held by men faced dismissal, discrimination, or hostility when the men returned, and that educators blamed over-educated, career-focused mothers for the maladjustment of soldiers in World War II. Yet as Friedan shows, later studies found that overbearing mothers, not careerists, were the ones who raised maladjusted children.

Chapter 9: Friedan shows that advertisers tried to encourage housewives to think of themselves as professionals who needed many specialized products in order to do their jobs, while discouraging housewives from having actual careers, since that would mean they would not spend as much time and effort on housework and therefore would not buy as many household products, cutting into advertisers&#x27; profits. Critics of this theory point out that under the circumstances men, not women, would be buying these household products and women having actual careers would increase women&#x27;s buying power while increasing advertisers profits.

Chapter 10: Friedan interviews several full-time housewives, finding that although they are not fulfilled by their housework, they are all extremely busy with it. She postulates that these women unconsciously stretch their home duties to fill the time available, because the feminine mystique has taught women that this is their role, and if they ever complete their tasks they will become unneeded.

Chapter 11: Friedan notes that many housewives have sought fulfillment in sex, unable to find it in housework and children. She notes that sex cannot fulfill all of a person&#x27;s needs, and that attempts to do so often drive married women to have affairs or drive their husbands away as they become obsessed with sex.

Chapter 12: Friedan discusses the fact that many children have lost interest in life or emotional growth, attributing the change to the mother&#x27;s own lack of fulfillment, a side effect of the feminine mystique. When the mother lacks a self, Friedan notes, she often tries to live through her children, causing the children to lose their own sense of themselves as separate human beings with their own lives.

Chapter 13: Friedan discusses the psychologist Abraham Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs and notes that women have been trapped at the basic, physiological level, expected to find their identity through their sexual role alone. Friedan says that women need meaningful work just as men do to achieve self-actualization, the highest level on the hierarchy of needs.

Chapter 14: In the final chapter of &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;, Friedan discusses several case studies of women who have begun to go against the feminine mystique. She also advocates a new life plan for her women readers, including not viewing housework as a career, not trying to find total fulfillment through marriage and motherhood alone, and finding meaningful work that uses their full mental capacity. She discusses the conflicts that some women may face in this journey to self-actualization, including their own fears and resistance from others. For each conflict, Friedan offers examples of women who have overcome it. Friedan ends her book by promoting education and meaningful work as the ultimate method by which American women can avoid becoming trapped in the feminine mystique, calling for a drastic rethinking of what it means to be feminine, and offering several educational and occupational suggestions.

==Intended sequel==
Friedan originally intended to write a sequel to &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;, which was to be called &quot;Woman: The Fourth Dimension&quot;, but instead only wrote an article by that name, which appeared in the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; in June 1964.

==Influences==
Friedan&#x27;s chapter on Freud was inspired by the philosopher Simone de Beauvoir&#x27;s &quot;The Second Sex&quot; (1949).

==Legacy==
&quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; drew large numbers of white, middle-class women to the feminist cause. 

The National Organization for Women (NOW) was organized in 1966 with 30 women from different backgrounds; Friedan was one of them, and helped draft the founding statement of NOW. The statement called for &quot;the true equality for all women&quot;. NOW demanded the removal of all barriers to &quot;equal and economic advance&quot;. Friedan&#x27;s influence can be seen in the founding statement; a main emphasis of the book is &quot;women&#x27;s need for identity and autonomy&quot;, and NOW&#x27;s statement says &quot;NOW is dedicated to the proposition that women first and foremost are human beings, who… must have the chance to develop their fullest human potential.&quot;

&quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; is widely regarded as one of the most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century, and is widely credited with sparking the beginning of second-wave feminism in the United States. Futurist Alvin Toffler declared that it &quot;pulled the trigger on history.&quot; Friedan received hundreds of letters from unhappy housewives after its publication, and she herself went on to help found, and become the first president of the National Organization for Women, an influential feminist organization.

In addition to its contribution to feminism, &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; related to many other coinciding movements. &quot;Her work indicates for us the ways that feminism was interconnected with the struggles of working-class men and women, with black and Jewish battles against racism and anti-Semitism… As a result, &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; had substantial impact on a wide range of political activists, thinkers, and ordinary individuals.&quot;

By the year 2000, &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; had sold over 3 million copies and had been translated into many foreign languages.

On February 22 and 23, 2013, a symposium titled &quot;React: The Feminine Mystique at 50&quot;, co-sponsored by The New School for Public Engagement and The Parsons School of Design, was held. An accompanying exhibit titled &quot;REACT&quot; was also on display, consisting of twenty-five pieces of artwork responding to &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;.

Also in February 2013, a fiftieth-anniversary edition of &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; was published, with a new introduction by Gail Collins.

Also in 2013, to celebrate its centennial the U.S. Department of Labor created a list of over 100 &quot;Books that Shaped Work in America&quot;, which included &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;. The Department of Labor later chose &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; as one of its top ten books from that list.

Also in 2013, &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; was discussed in &quot;&quot;.

In 2014, the Betty Friedan Hometown Tribute committee won the Superior Achievement award in the special projects category for its 50th anniversary celebration of the publication of &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;. They received the award from the Illinois State Historical Society.

==Criticism==

=== Disagreement ===
Immediately after its publishing, &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; was the recipient of much backlash against feminism. Significant numbers of women responded angrily to the book, which they felt implied that wives and mothers could never be fulfilled. &quot;Women who valued their roles as mothers and housewives interpreted Friedan&#x27;s message as one that threatened their stability, devalued their labor, and disrespected their intelligence.&quot; In a Letter to Editor in &quot;McCall&quot;, one woman wrote, &quot;All this time I thought I was happy, and a nice person. Now I discover I&#x27;ve been miserable and some sort of monster in disguise—now out of disguise. How awful!&quot; Another said, &quot;Mrs. Friedan should save her pity for those who really need it—the half starved, oppressed people in the world.&quot; When women critical of the work were not expressing personal offense at Friedan&#x27;s description of the housewife&#x27;s plight, they were accusing her of planning to destroy American families. Jessica Weiss quoted in her paper, &quot;If the mothers, (or housewives as we are called) took this advice, what would become of our children? Or better yet, the future of the world.&quot;

Historian Joanne Meyerowitz argues that many of the contemporary magazines and articles of the period did not place women solely in the home, as Friedan stated, but in fact supported the notions of full- or part-time jobs for women seeking to follow a career path rather than being a housewife. These articles did, however, still emphasize the importance of maintaining the traditional image of femininity.

=== Author and publication process ===
Daniel Horowitz, a Professor of American Studies at Smith College, points out that although Friedan presented herself as a typical suburban housewife, she was involved with radical politics and labor journalism in her youth, and during the time she wrote &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; she worked as a freelance journalist for women&#x27;s magazines and as a community organizer.

The W. W. Norton publishing house, where Betty Friedan&#x27;s work was initially circulated to be published as a book also generated some criticism. In fact an employee under the alias &quot;L M&quot; wrote in a two-page memo that Friedan&#x27;s theoretical views were &quot;too obvious and feminine&quot;, as well as critiquing her approach by suggesting it to be unscientific.

=== Excluded groups of women ===
In addition, Friedan has been criticized for focusing solely on the plight of middle-class white women, and not giving enough attention to the differing situations encountered by women in less stable economic situations, or women of other races. According to Kirsten Fermaglich and Lisa Fine, &quot;women of color—African American, Latina, Asian American and Native American women—were completely absent from Friedan&#x27;s vision, as were white working-class and poor women.&quot; Despite being written during the Civil Rights Movement, Friedan&#x27;s text &quot;barely mentions African-American women.&quot; In her &quot;Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center&quot;, Black feminist bell hooks writes &quot;She did not speak of the needs of women without men, without children, without homes. She ignored the existence of all non-white women and poor white women. She did not tell readers whether it was more fulfilling to be a maid, a babysitter, a factory worker, a clerk, or a prostitute than to be a leisure-class housewife. She made her plight and the plight of white women like herself synonymous with a condition affecting all American women. In so doing, she deflected attention away from her classism, her racism, her sexist attitudes towards the masses of American women. In the context of her book, Friedan makes clear that the women she saw as victimized by sexism were college-educated white women&quot;.

Friedan has also been criticized for prejudice against homosexuality. In part, this criticism stems from her adherence to the paradigmatic belief at the time that &quot;bad mothers&quot; caused deviance from heteronormative and cisnormative society.

Despite these criticisms, her &quot;language aimed at white American middle-class women won large numbers of supporters to the feminist cause,&quot; implying perhaps that Friedan&#x27;s decision to exclude other groups was deliberate in mobilizing a group of women that had in some cases not thought of the improvement of their rights.

<doc id="1217874" wikidata="Q1316802" url="?curid=1217874" title="1996 World Series">
<text>The 1996 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1996 season. The 92nd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the National League (NL) champion (and defending World Series champion) Atlanta Braves and the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees. The Yankees defeated the Braves four games to two to capture their first World Series title since 1978 and their 23rd overall. The series was played from October 20–26, 1996, and was broadcast on television on Fox. Yankees relief pitcher John Wetteland was named the World Series Most Valuable Player for saving all four Yankee wins.

The Yankees advanced to the World Series by defeating the Texas Rangers in the AL Division Series, three games to one, and then the Baltimore Orioles in the AL Championship Series, four games to one. It was the Yankees&#x27; first appearance in a World Series since 1981. The Braves advanced to the Series by defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL Division Series, three games to none, and then the St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Championship Series, four games to three. It was the Braves&#x27; second consecutive appearance in a World Series.

The Yankees lost the first two games at home, being outscored by the Braves, 16–1. However, they rebounded to win the next four games, the last three in close fashion, including a dramatic comeback win in Game 4 to tie the series. They became the third team to win a World Series after losing Games 1 and 2 at their home stadium, following the Kansas City Royals in 1985 and the New York Mets in 1986. They also became the first team since the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1981 to win four consecutive games in a World Series after losing the first two. As of 2022, this is the last time any team has lost Games 1 &amp; 2 at home in a best-of-seven series (LCS or World Series) and come back to win the series.

Game 5 was the final game to be played at Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, as the Braves moved into Turner Field the following season. Atlanta became the only city to host the World Series and the Olympics in the same year and Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium became the only stadium to host baseball in an Olympics and the World Series in the same year. The Yankees victory also resulted in general manager Bob Watson becoming the first African-American general manager to win the World Series.

==Background==

The 1996 World Series marked the beginning of the New York Yankees&#x27; dynasty of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Despite the rich playoff history of the Yankees, the defending champion Atlanta Braves entered the Series as heavy favorites.

The Yankees had reached the Fall Classic after their ALCS victory over the Baltimore Orioles, while the Braves had rallied from a 3–1 deficit to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS.

The Braves used the dominant pitching of Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, as well as timely hitting, to defeat the Indians the year before, and looked to reuse that recipe against the upstart Yankees. In 1996, John Smoltz returned to form, winning 24 games and a Cy Young Award, providing another serious pitching threat for Atlanta. New York brought a lineup mixed with veterans, like Paul O&#x27;Neill, and young stars, like rookie Derek Jeter. The Yankees bullpen was also vastly superior to the Atlanta bullpen, which would prove to be the deciding factor in the Series.

Over the course of the 1996 World Series, the Braves hit .315 during the first six innings and .176 afterward. Atlanta had more hits, runs, homers, and a lower team ERA during the course of the series, but still lost, much like the 1960 Yankees&#x27; performance against the Pittsburgh Pirates.

This is the first World Series to feature the series logo on the side of each team&#x27;s hats.

This was also the last of four consecutive World Series (1992–1996) to be presided over jointly by the presidents of the American and National Leagues in lieu of the Commissioner of Baseball, as Paul Beeston would be named CEO of Major League Baseball for the 1997 Major League Baseball season. Following Game 6, then-American League president Gene Budig presided over the Commissioner&#x27;s Trophy presentation to the Yankees. Then-Chairman of the Executive Committee (and de facto Commissioner) Bud Selig, who had presided over the trophy presentations in and would do so again in , officially became Commissioner in 1998.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===
Game 1 and Game 2 were originally scheduled for Saturday, October 19, and Sunday, October 20. Rain on October 19, however, washed out Game 1. The schedule was moved back one day, with Game 1 and Game 2 rescheduled for October 20 and 21, and the Monday travel day eliminated. This was the first time weather resulted in a postponement since the 1986 World Series, where Game 7 was delayed one day due to inclement weather.

The game was a matchup of league wins leaders. The Yankees sent out lefthander Andy Pettitte, who in only his second full season in the major leagues had won 21 games and made the American League All-Star Team. For the Braves went veteran John Smoltz, who won a career high 24 games and led the National League in strikeouts.

Entering the World Series, Atlanta had completed a comeback from a 3–1 deficit and beaten the St. Louis Cardinals by a margin of 32–1 in the three previous games. They continued their offensive onslaught in Game One.

In the second inning, rookie Braves outfielder Andruw Jones stepped to the plate with catcher Javy Lopez on base and two out. The 19-year-old native of Curaçao drove a full-count pitch over the left field fence to open the scoring. In doing this he broke the record held by Mickey Mantle of being the youngest player in World Series history to hit a home run in his first Series at-bat.

One inning later, the defending champions broke the game open. Jeff Blauser and Marquis Grissom opened the top of the third with singles, and were moved into scoring position by a sacrifice bunt from Mark Lemke. Chipper Jones then singled to score the runners, advancing to second on a throw to the plate. While Fred McGriff batted, Jones stole third base and then scored himself when McGriff followed his single with one of his own. After issuing a walk to Lopez, Pettitte was pulled from the game with Yankees manager Joe Torre calling on Brian Boehringer to get out of the jam his team was in.

With his team now trailing by five runs, Boehringer faced Jermaine Dye and got him to fly out to left. However, once again the young outfielder from the Caribbean came through as Andruw Jones hit his second home run in the next at-bat to make the score 8–0. McGriff later added his own home run off Boehringer in the fifth which struck the right field foul pole with a loud clang.

The Yankees&#x27; offense, meanwhile, had been unable to do much against Smoltz. Entering their half of the fifth, they had yet to record a hit and, despite Smoltz recording four walks, had stranded every baserunner that they had managed to get on. In the fifth, they did break through for their first run when veteran third baseman Wade Boggs drove in rookie sensation Derek Jeter with a double.

The Braves closed out the scoring in the sixth. Andruw Jones singled off Boehringer and Ryan Klesko reached on an error by second baseman Mariano Duncan. After Blauser&#x27;s fly ball out advanced Jones to third, Grissom and Lemke recorded consecutive hits to drive in the baserunners and make the score 11–1. David Weathers came in with runners now on the corners and one out, then gave up a sacrifice fly out that scored Grissom.

Smoltz pitched six innings to get the victory, recording the single run on two hits. Relievers Greg McMichael, Denny Neagle, Terrell Wade, and Brad Clontz held the Yankees scoreless in the final three innings. Pettitte, in his first World Series start, took the loss after being charged with seven of the 12 Braves runs in 2.2 innings of work.

Andruw Jones, with his two home runs in the first at bats, joined Gene Tenace as the only other player to homer in his first two World Series at bats.
===Game 2===
Game 2 of the series saw the Braves turn to four-time defending Cy Young Award winner Greg Maddux to start. The Yankees trotted out one of their few pitchers that actually had World Series experience, the veteran Jimmy Key. Just before signing with the Yankees as a free agent in 1993, Key had defeated the Braves twice in the 1992 World Series, including in the Series-clincher, while pitching for the Toronto Blue Jays.

As they had in Game 1, the Yankees again struggled against a strong Braves starter. Maddux pitched eight shutout innings and, despite giving up six hits, only allowed two runners to reach third base. Despite only striking out two batters, he managed to retire most of the hitters he faced on ground ball outs; he also did not walk a batter, only allowing one additional runner to reach when he hit Derek Jeter with a pitch in the third inning.

Key, meanwhile, had trouble getting Fred McGriff out with runners on base. In the first inning, following a pitch Key thought was a strike, McGriff singled with two outs to drive home Mark Lemke, who had hit a ground-rule double earlier. Then, in the third inning, McGriff came up with Marquis Grissom at third and singled again, driving the second Atlanta run in. Finally, in the fifth, McGriff drove in his third run of the game by hitting a sacrifice fly to score Lemke from third with nobody out. The Braves&#x27; fourth run came when Grissom singled off Key in the sixth to drive in Terry Pendleton.

Mark Wohlers, a long-time Brave reliever of postseasons past who was now the team&#x27;s closer, relieved Maddux in the ninth and struck out Bernie Williams, Tino Martinez, and Paul O&#x27;Neill to end the game and put the Braves up 2-0 heading back to Atlanta.

After the game, Yankees manager Joe Torre and his first base coach José Cardenal met with owner George Steinbrenner, furious at the team&#x27;s performance in the World Series so far. At that post-game meeting, Torre guaranteed three victories in Atlanta and then bringing the series back to Yankee Stadium to clinch at home. Steinbrenner doubted Torre, saying, &quot;If you guys can&#x27;t beat the Braves at home, you surely can&#x27;t beat them down in Atlanta.&quot;

This was the Braves&#x27; last win in a World Series game until Game 1 of in their championship season, having gone 0-8 in WS games in the interim.
===Game 3===
The Yankees decided to shake their lineup up prior to Game 3 in an attempt to get themselves out of the slump they experienced in the first two games. Manager Joe Torre took veterans Paul O&#x27;Neill, Wade Boggs, and Tino Martinez out of the lineup. Replacing Boggs at third base was Charlie Hayes, while Darryl Strawberry took O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s spot in right field. After starting him as the designated hitter in the first two games, Torre decided to keep Cecil Fielder in the lineup and had him replace Martinez at first base.

With the Braves looking to make it a 3–0 lead in the series, they sent veteran Tom Glavine to the mound to start Game 3. He had started the most recent World Series game in Atlanta, the 1–0 shutout in Game 6 in 1995 which he won and which helped him earn the series MVP award.

The Yankees&#x27; starter, meanwhile, was returning from nearly having his career end. David Cone had signed a three-year contract to stay with the Yankees after he was traded to them by Toronto during the 1995 season. He started off the season pitching well, but was discovered to have an aneurysm in his pitching arm and forced to miss most of the season. He did manage to come back toward the end of the season and was kept on the postseason roster. Cone was also previously experienced in World Series play, having played for the same 1992 Blue Jays team as Game 2 starter Jimmy Key; he managed two no-decisions in both of his prior starts.

The Yankees got the first run of the game in their first turn at bat. Tim Raines led off with a walk and moved to second on a sacrifice bunt from Derek Jeter. Bernie Williams drove him in with a single. The Yankees added another in the fourth inning. After Williams reached on a Jeff Blauser error, he would advance on a walk to Fielder and then a line drive to the right that Andruw Jones caught. Strawberry drove in the unearned run with a single; and after Mariano Duncan struck out, Joe Girardi drew a walk to put two runners on for Cone. Cone did manage to make contact, but hit the ball right at a stumbling Chipper Jones who touched third base to end the inning.

Cone led off the sixth inning with a walk to Glavine, followed by a single to Marquis Grissom. After retiring Mark Lemke on a failed bunt attempt, Cone loaded the bases by walking Chipper Jones. Fred McGriff popped out to Jeter for the second out, but Ryan Klesko drew a walk to force in Glavine and cut the lead to 2–1. Cone got Javy López to pop out to Girardi to end the inning, closing his night. Glavine would be done after the seventh, giving up only four hits and the earned run in the first and unearned run in the fourth.

In the eighth inning the Yankees put the game out of reach. Jeter reached on a single off Greg McMichael and Williams hit a home run following that, extending the lead to 4–1. After Fielder doubled, Brad Clontz came in and retired Hayes. He then walked Strawberry, only to give up another run with a single from defensive replacement Luis Sojo.

The Braves tried to rally in the bottom half and got a run back off Mariano Rivera on a triple by Grissom and a single by Lemke. Rivera managed to strike out Chipper Jones, but with McGriff and Klesko looming Torre brought in lefthander Graeme Lloyd, who retired them both. Neither team threatened in the ninth and the Yankees got their much needed win.

Cone won his first World Series decision in three tries; he had previously recorded two no-decisions in the 1992 World Series. Glavine lost what would be his only start in the series that year, while Yankee closer John Wetteland received his first save.
===Game 4===
The original intent for the Yankees entering the series was to use a short pitching rotation, which would have consisted of their front three starters (Pettitte, Key, and Cone) each making starts on three days rest. However, since Game 1 was postponed and the teams would have to play a potential five consecutive days, that was no longer possible. So, for Game 4, the Yankees were forced to adjust their starting pitching lineup.

Denny Neagle, who saw action in Game 1, was the starter for Atlanta. Acquired at midseason from the Pittsburgh Pirates to shore up the rotation, he did not perform well during the regular season and had no record in the postseason, but pitched decently in the NLCS allowing only two hits and two runs in two appearances and one start.

Kenny Rogers got the start for the Yankees. He had been signed away from the Texas Rangers in the off-season, where he had just made his first All-Star team, and was one of the major acquisitions the Yankees made. However, Rogers only won 12 games during the regular season and pitched poorly during the postseason, being pulled early in his Division Series and ALCS starts.

Rogers&#x27; struggles continued in the World Series. In the bottom of the second Fred McGriff led off with a home run to open the scoring. After Javy López and Andruw Jones walked, Jermaine Dye sacrificed Lopez to third. Jeff Blauser followed with a bunt single to score Lopez, and, after Neagle bunted to advance Jones and Blauser, Marquis Grissom doubled them in to give Atlanta an early 4–0 lead. Rogers was pulled after allowing Chipper Jones and McGriff to reach base to begin the third, and was charged with a fifth run when Brian Boehringer gave up a sacrifice fly to Lopez which enabled Jones to score. The Braves extended their lead to 6–0 as Andruw Jones drove in Chipper Jones with a double in the fifth off David Weathers. Meanwhile, Neagle was pitching shutout ball and the Yankees had only gotten two hits through five innings. The sixth inning, however, proved to be troublesome.

Derek Jeter led off for the Yankees and hit a pop up into foul territory on the right side. McGriff and second baseman Mark Lemke came over from their positions to see if they could catch the ball while right field umpire Tim Welke watched the play. Behind him, Dye was coming in from his position in right field and had a better angle on the ball than both infielders. Welke, however, never turned around and in the process accidentally impeded Dye’s progress to the ball. Dye attempted to try to catch the foul pop anyway but it dropped in front of him, allowing Jeter to stay alive.

Jeter took advantage with a single, and after Bernie Williams drew a walk. Cecil Fielder hit a ball to right that Dye misplayed, allowing both runners to score. Charlie Hayes then followed with his own single, scoring Fielder. With the Yankees still having no outs and Darryl Strawberry due up, Bobby Cox
brought in reliever Terrell Wade to replace Neagle. Strawberry drew a walk, which brought Mariano Duncan to the plate as the tying run.

The Braves went back to the bullpen and brought in veteran Mike Bielecki, who had yet to give up a run in the postseason. He struck out Duncan for the first out, then followed this up by doing the same to pinch hitters Paul O&#x27;Neill and Tino Martinez. The Braves escaped the inning without any further runs scoring. They did not manage to add any runs in their half, though, as Yankee reliever Jeff Nelson retired them in order. The seventh also proved uneventful, as Bielecki retired Tim Raines on a fly out and, after walking Jeter, struck out Williams and Fielder while Nelson induced groundouts by Lemke, Chipper Jones, and Lopez.

For the eighth inning, Cox decided to make a call to his closer early and brought in Mark Wohlers for a two-inning save. Hayes greeted him with a slow roller up the third base line that was able to stay fair, giving him an infield single. Strawberry hit a single, and Duncan followed with what should have been a double play ground ball to shortstop. Rafael Belliard, who had entered the game as a defensive replacement for Blauser, was unable to field the ball cleanly and was only able to get Strawberry out at second. 

With one out and runners on the corners, 
catcher Jim Leyritz, who had replaced Joe Girardi in the bottom of the sixth, came up for his first at bat. Leyritz later said he felt he had an advantage because Wohlers was such a hard thrower and he was a solid fastball hitter. As such, he went up looking for a pitch to hit and with the count even at 2-2, Leyritz drove a Wohlers slider over the left field wall to tie the game at six. Cox’s decision had proven to be a mistake, even though Wohlers managed to strike out the next two batters to get out of the inning.

Mariano Rivera came in for the bottom of the eighth and immediately gave up a single to Andruw Jones. Dye followed up with a sacrifice bunt to move him into scoring position. However, pinch hitter Luis Polonia struck out and Rivera got backup catcher Eddie Perez to ground out, stranding Jones and keeping the game tied entering the ninth.

After recording the first two outs in the top half, Wohlers gave up back to back singles to Fielder and Hayes in the top half and then gave up an infield hit to Strawberry which loaded the bases. However, he got out of the jam when Duncan hit a short fly ball to Dye.

After getting Grissom to pop out to start the home ninth, Rivera gave up a hit to Lemke and walked Chipper Jones. With the lefthanded McGriff due up, Yankees manager Joe Torre made another call to the bullpen for Graeme Lloyd to face him as he had in Game 3. The move worked as McGriff grounded into a double play to end the inning and extend the game into extra innings. 

For the top of the tenth, Steve Avery came on to pitch for the Braves. Avery was another veteran of the Braves&#x27; postseason past and had been an integral part of their starting rotation for several years, including in 1991 when he won the NLCS Most Valuable Player award. However, after making the All-Star Team in 1993 his career had taken a downward slide and by 1996 Avery was limited to relief duties in the postseason. He was tasked with keeping the game tied against the bottom of the Yankees lineup, and started out doing just that as he retired Leyritz and Lloyd.

Avery then followed that up by walking Tim Raines on four pitches. Jeter followed with a single, and with two runners on base Cox decided again to play strategy. Williams was the batter and on deck was Andy Fox, who had pinch run for Fielder in the ninth. The Braves intentionally walked Williams to load the bases for Fox.

Torre called Fox back to the dugout and sent up the struggling Wade Boggs to try to drive in the go-ahead run. Although Avery got two early strikes, Boggs drew a walk on a full count, scoring Raines and giving the Yankees their first lead of the game. With his strategy having backfired, Cox made a double switch, bringing in Brad Clontz to pitch while Ryan Klesko replaced McGriff at first base. The next batter, Hayes, hit a pop fly that Klesko lost sight of and dropped, which scored Jeter.

Lloyd retired Klesko to lead off the bottom of the tenth, then gave way to closer John Wetteland, who gave up a single to Andruw Jones but recorded two flyouts from Dye and Terry Pendleton to get his second save of the postseason. Lloyd was credited with the win, with Avery suffering the loss. &quot;It was our game to win and we had our chances,&quot; Avery said. &quot;I ended up costing us the game.&quot;

This was the second biggest comeback in World Series history. In 1929, the Philadelphia Athletics scored 10 runs in the seventh inning to defeat the Chicago Cubs 10–8 in Game 4. This was also the last time the first four games were won by the road team until the 2019 World Series between the Houston Astros and Washington Nationals.
===Game 5===
With the series tied and both teams guaranteed to return to New York, the Yankees and Braves took to the field for what was to be the final game ever played inside Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. As part of the planning that went into Atlanta&#x27;s winning bid for the 1996 Summer Olympics, the main venue for the Games, Centennial Olympic Stadium, would be immediately reconfigured as a baseball stadium once the Olympics and Paralympics were over; the stadium, which was placed adjacent to its soon-to-be predecessor, would be renamed Turner Field and the Braves would begin play there once the 1997 season began.

The pitching matchup featured a rematch of the Game 1 starters, with John Smoltz looking to give the Braves the series lead while Andy Pettitte sought to atone for his poor performance in Game 1 and give the Yankees the opportunity to clinch the series at home in Game 6.

Unlike in Game 1, where the Braves routed the Yankees by a 12–1 margin, Game 5 proved to be a classic pitcher&#x27;s duel. In fact, only one run was scored by either team. That came in the top of the fourth inning, with Charlie Hayes leading off. He lifted a fly ball to right center field that Marquis Grissom seemed to have an easy play on. However, as he was coming toward right field, Jermaine Dye was coming from the left and crossed in front of Grissom. Grissom consequently lost sight of the ball and it dropped between him and Dye, and Hayes advanced to second base on the error. Two batters later, Cecil Fielder hit a double to drive in Hayes and give the Yankees the lead.

The Yankees threatened again in the sixth. After Bernie Williams struck out to start the inning, Fielder singled. Darryl Strawberry drew a walk, and Paul O&#x27;Neill grounded out to advance the runners to second and third. Smoltz struck out Mariano Duncan to end the inning.

Through five innings Pettitte had only allowed one hit, a single off the bat of Andruw Jones, and Grissom had been the only other Brave to reach base. But in the home half of the sixth, Atlanta threatened. Smoltz and Grissom reached base and Mark Lemke was asked to bunt to try and advance the runners so that Chipper Jones, batting next, could come up with an opportunity to drive them both in.

Facing the possibility of having the go-ahead runs in scoring position with one out, Pettitte got Lemke to bunt the ball to the third base side of the mound. Since Pettitte was left-handed, this meant he had an easier shot at getting the lead runner than he might have of throwing to first in time and he used that advantage to beat a sliding Smoltz to third with his throw. Jones then hit Pettitte&#x27;s first pitch right back to him, starting a 1-4-3 double play to retire the side.

Smoltz would pitch two more innings, allowing two baserunners in the seventh; he retired Jim Leyritz on a fielder&#x27;s choice play with Pettitte batting and then got Derek Jeter to lineout to Fred McGriff at first, who doubled off Pettitte to end the inning. After retiring the Yankees in order in the eighth he was lifted for a pinch hitter; he only would allow four hits and strike out ten batters, with the lone unearned run counting against him.

For the ninth inning, Braves manager Bobby Cox brought in his closer, Mark Wohlers, to try and hold the Yankees to the one-run lead they&#x27;d held since the fourth. After retiring Strawberry on a groundout, he walked O&#x27;Neill. Duncan followed with a fielder&#x27;s choice that retired O&#x27;Neill, then stole second base to put himself in scoring position.

That made for a shift in strategy for the Braves. With Leyritz standing in the batter&#x27;s box and two out, first base was open. The pitcher&#x27;s spot was due next, and Pettitte was in fact standing in the on deck circle. Cox decided to call Joe Torre&#x27;s bluff, since closer John Wetteland was loosening up in the Yankee bullpen, and called for an intentional walk to see what Torre was going to do. The call did not
go completely as planned, as Wohlers threw a wild pitch on the intended play and Duncan advanced to third.

Torre elected not to go to his bench, and sent up his ace to face the hard-throwing Wohlers. Although Pettitte was retired on a flyout to end the inning, it was not a matter of whether or not he would reach base. Instead, it showed that Torre had enough confidence in Pettitte to at least send him out for the bottom of the ninth to finish the shutout.

The Braves immediately responded in their half. Chipper Jones hit a line drive to left field and was able to reach second easily, putting the tying run in scoring position. After McGriff grounded out, Torre decided to make the change and brought Wetteland into the game to face Javy López.

After he induced a groundout off the bat of López, Wetteland faced Ryan Klesko, came up to pinch hit for Andruw Jones, but Torre decided to walk him intentionally. With the winning runs now on base, Cox again went to his bench and called back the young outfielder Dye. Luis Polonia, a former Yankee, was sent up to pinch hit.

After fighting off six pitches, all foul balls, Polonia lifted a fly ball deep to right. O’Neill, who was playing with sore legs the entire series, was able to chase down the ball and caught it on the warning track, then slapped the wall with his glove in celebration as the Yankees took the victory.

The loss suffered by Smoltz was his first in seven career World Series starts; he had two victories, in Game 5 in 1992 and Game 1 of this series, and four no-decisions prior to this. It was also only his second post-season loss of his career, and in both of these losses up to that point, all the runs he surrendered were unearned. He would only pitch in one more World Series, the 1999 rematch between these two teams; he took the loss in the decisive fourth game at Yankee Stadium despite another quality start in that game.

The Yankees became the first team to sweep the middle three games of the World Series since the Braves themselves did it in (although the Braves &quot;won&quot; all three games at Fulton County Stadium in the 1991 World Series, the home team won all seven games of that series). New York was the first road team to sweep the middle three since the Baltimore Orioles in , and the last until the Houston Astros in to do so (the visiting team won all seven games in the 2019 World Series for the only time).

The Braves joined the 1905 Philadelphia Athletics, the 1921 New York Yankees and the World Series champion New York Mets as the only teams to lose a 1–0 World Series game on an unearned run.
===Game 6===
Prior to Game 6, Yankees manager Joe Torre&#x27;s brother Frank underwent heart transplant surgery.

The Yankees, seeking to clinch their first world championship since and the first for a New York City baseball team since the Mets won in , faced off against Greg Maddux in a rematch of the Game 2 starters, as Jimmy Key took to the hill for the Yankees. The Braves, for the third time in their four World Series visits thus far in the 1990s, were facing an elimination game.

The Yankees struck against Maddux in the bottom of the third inning. Paul O&#x27;Neill led off the frame with a double and advanced to third on a groundout by Mariano Duncan. Joe Girardi then hit a flyball to center field that Marquis Grissom misjudged, which scored O&#x27;Neill and gave Girardi a triple. He scored on a single by Derek Jeter, and after stealing second Jeter scored on a single by Bernie Williams. These were the only three runs Maddux gave up in the series, but they were costly. Maddux pitched the next innings without giving up another run.

The Braves got a run back in the top of the fourth as Fred McGriff reached on a walk. Javy López and Andruw Jones followed with back to back singles to load the bases, and Jermaine Dye drew a walk to force in the run. Key got out of the bases loaded jam by getting designated hitter Terry Pendleton to ground into a double play to end the inning.

The top of the fifth inning saw another umpiring controversy. With Mark Lemke at the plate and one out, Girardi dropped a pitch from Key. Grissom tried to advance and Girardi&#x27;s throw was late and replays clearly showed Grissom to be safe, but umpire Terry Tata called Grissom out. Atlanta manager Bobby Cox emerged from the dugout and began arguing the call to no avail. Because Chipper Jones opened the following inning with a double, the missed call likely cost the Braves a run. On his way back to the dugout Cox turned his ire to third base umpire Tim Welke, with the incident involving Welke&#x27;s accidental interference ushering in a Yankee rally in Game 4 still fresh in his mind. Welke threw Cox out of the game, marking the first managerial ejection in the World Series since . Incidentally, Cox was also on the receiving end in the previous instance; he had been ejected for throwing a batting helmet from the dugout to protest a strikeout call (Fox and the video recap of the series erroneously reported that Whitey Herzog&#x27;s ejection in the 1985 World Series had been the last time). It was the last ejection of a manager in a World Series game until the 2019 World Series, when Dave Martinez of the Washington Nationals was also thrown out of the game in game 6.

New York manager Joe Torre pulled Key from the game in the top of the sixth with one out and Chipper Jones—who had opened the inning with a double—on third. David Weathers came in to pitch to Lopez and retired him. Then after a walk to Andruw Jones and Ryan Klesko coming in to pinch hit for Dye the Yankees went to Graeme Lloyd to pitch to Klesko, who did not have a hit against Lloyd in the series. Lloyd retired Klesko to end the inning and Mariano Rivera got the next six outs to send the game to the ninth. Maddux came out of the game one out away from a complete game in the eighth, and Mark Wohlers retired Cecil Fielder to end it.

John Wetteland was called on again for his fourth save of the series, but the Braves tried to rally. After he struck out Andruw Jones to lead off the inning, Klesko and Pendleton got back to back singles off Wetteland. With one out and runners at the corners, Luis Polonia came off the bench to pinch hit for Jeff Blauser, but failed to produce a hit and struck out swinging. Grissom then followed with another single, scoring Klesko and giving the Braves at least one more chance with Lemke at the plate. However, Lemke popped out to Charlie Hayes in foul territory to end the game, series, baseball season, and Atlanta&#x27;s reign as world champions. Wetteland became the second pitcher to record four saves in a single postseason series, following Dennis Eckersley&#x27;s feat in the 1988 ALCS and since matched by Greg Holland in the 2014 ALCS. He also set a new record for most saves in one postseason, with 7, since tied by 5 other pitchers (Robb Nen, Troy Percival, Brad Lidge, and Koji Uehara, besides Holland). The Yankees had waited 18 years to see another title come to the Big Apple.

==Composite box==
1996 World Series (4–2): New York Yankees (A.L.) beat Atlanta Braves (N.L.).

This World Series is notable for being one of the few six-game Series in which the winning team was outscored.&lt;br&gt;It happened previously in 1918, 1959, 1977, and 1992, and would later occur in 2003.

==Broadcasting==
This was the first World Series to be televised by Fox, with Joe Buck calling the play-by-play and Tim McCarver and Bob Brenly serving as color commentators. At the age of 27, Buck became the second-youngest announcer to call the play-by-play of a World Series telecast. Vin Scully, who was calling the series with Jeff Torborg over CBS Radio, remains the youngest ever, having been 25 when he called the 1953 World Series for NBC television. Buck, however, became the youngest person to call all nine innings of a World Series telecast while acting as a full-time network employee (surpassing CBS&#x27; Sean McDonough, who was 30 years of age when he called the 1992 World Series), as in 1953 Scully shared play-by-play duties with Mel Allen. Also, Major League Baseball&#x27;s network television policies back then allowed announcers employed by the participating World Series teams (in the case of 1953, Scully&#x27;s Brooklyn Dodgers and Allen&#x27;s New York Yankees) to call the action.

Having called Games 1, 4, and 5 of the 1995 World Series for ABC, and the World Series prior to that in 1993 for CBS, Tim McCarver gained the unique distinction of serving as a television color commentator for at least three consecutive World Series on three different networks. During Game 6 at Yankee Stadium, a fan behind home plate held up a sign that said &quot;John 3:16&quot;. McCarver made mention of this sign, saying that the fan was a true Yankees fan because he knew Tommy John&#x27;s career ERA. (John&#x27;s career ERA is actually 3.34, not 3.16.)

The Atlanta Braves became the first Major League Baseball team to appear in World Series telecast on all four major networks (NBC in 1957–58 and 1995, ABC in 1995, CBS in 1991–92 and Fox in 1996; they would appear with NBC again in 1999 and with Fox in 2021). The Philadelphia Phillies have since duplicated this feat (NBC in 1950 and 1980, ABC in 1983, CBS in 1993 and Fox in 2008–09.)

It was the last terrestrial television Broadcast on Canadian Soil Via CTV; however it was the first time Canadian TV did not simulcast US coverage, as CTV aired MLB International&#x27;s coverage, as would happen during the years in which Fox has aired the World Series, as it continues to do today.

==Aftermath==
===Braves===
The Braves, who were playing in their 4th World Series since 1991, were in the midst of an unprecedented run of success, winning their division every full season from 1991 to 2005 (not including 1994 because of the player&#x27;s strike that canceled that season in August). During that period, the Braves would play in the National League Championship Series (NLCS) nearly every season from 1991 to 2001 (the lone exception being 2000). However, the Braves would make the World Series only one more time in that time, winning their fifth National League pennant in 1999. They were again defeated by the Yankees in a 4-game sweep. The Braves would not return to the World Series until 2021, and have made only three appearances in the NLCS since (in 2001, 2020, and 2021). The Braves&#x27; 2-game lead in the 1996 World Series marked the closest the Braves would come to a second World Series title in the Bobby Cox era.

===Yankees===
It took Yankees manager Joe Torre a record 4,272 games to make it to the World Series in his combined careers as a player and a manager, but he would not have to wait very long to go back. The Yankees would win the American League pennant five more times in the next seven seasons (only falling short of making the World Series in 1997 and 2002), which included the Yankees winning three consecutive World Series championships from 1998 to 2000. This gave the Yankees four championships in five years. The 1996 championship was the 23rd in franchise history and the first of five that Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, and Andy Pettitte won with the Yankees.

On October 11, 2005, A&amp;E Home Video released the &quot;New York Yankees Fall Classic Collectors Edition (1996–2001)&quot; DVD set, featuring one World Series Game apiece from 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001. Game 4 from the 1996 World Series is included in the set. On September 23, 2008, &quot;The Essential Games of Yankee Stadium&quot; DVD set was released, featuring six games that were played in Yankee Stadium, which were determined via fan voting. Game 6 of the 1996 Series is included in this set.

To date, the 1996 Yankees are the last team in the World Series to comeback from a 2-0 series deficit.

==In popular culture==
In a notable scene from the episode &quot;The Abstinence&quot; of the American television series &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, George Costanza gives batting advice to Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams. When Jeter protests that they &quot;won the World Series&quot;, referring to the 1996 Series, George derisively replies, &quot;In six games.&quot;

<text>The 1995 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1995 season. The 91st edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the National League (NL) champion Atlanta Braves and the American League (AL) champion Cleveland Indians. It was the first World Series after the previous year&#x27;s Series was canceled due to a players&#x27; strike. The Braves won in six games to capture their third World Series championship in franchise history (along with 1914 in Boston and 1957 in Milwaukee), making them the first team to win in three different cities. This was also Cleveland&#x27;s first Series appearance in 41 years.

The Series was also remarkable in that five of the six games were won by one run, including the clinching sixth game, a 1–0 combined one-hitter by Tom Glavine and Mark Wohlers.

This was the first time since the LCS changed to a best-of-seven format that a winner of a LCS via a sweep has gone on to win the World Series. It has since been repeated in 2019 by the Washington Nationals, and in 2022 by the Houston Astros.

This World Series, despite being in an odd-numbered year, opened in the NL home because of the omission of the 1994 World Series. Until 2003, the World Series would begin in the AL home in even-numbered years.

==Background==
===Atlanta Braves===
After losing the World Series in 1991 to the Minnesota Twins and in 1992 to the Toronto Blue Jays, the Atlanta Braves were making their third attempt in four years (not counting the 1994 strike) to capture Atlanta&#x27;s first title.

The Braves overcame some early inconsistency to win their division by 21 games. In the playoffs, which featured a new first round, the Braves overwhelmed the third-year Colorado Rockies, then swept the Cincinnati Reds in the NLCS (spoiling an all-Ohio World Series in the process; notably, prior to their World Series appearance in 1948, the Indians had spoiled an all-Boston World Series by beating the Red Sox in a one-game playoff). The team relied on clutch hitting and its powerful pitching rotation, which was made up of perennial Cy Young Award winner Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, and Steve Avery.

As the NL champion, they opened this World Series at home because there was no 1994 World Series.

===Cleveland Indians===
After decades of futility, the city of Cleveland finally had a winner in town. The Indians dominated the American League in 1995, winning 100 of their 144 games (their 100–44 record yielded a very high 0.694 winning percentage, which was, at the time, the highest regular season winning percentage in Major League Baseball since 1954, and is, as of 2015, the 12th highest regular season winning percentage in Major League Baseball history since 1900). Furthermore, in just 144 games, they won the AL Central by 30 games, and they performed the difficult feat of leading their league in both team batting average (0.291) and ERA (3.81). Thanks to their hitting and bullpen, this Indians team became known around the league for their ability to come back from many deficits, often in dramatic fashion; of their 100 regular season victories, 48 were come-back victories, 27 came in their last at-bat, eight came by way of &quot;walk off&quot; home runs, and 13 were extra-inning victories (they were 13–0 in extra-inning games). After this dominance of the AL in the regular season, the Indians, in the playoffs, swept the Boston Red Sox in the opening round, then held off Ken Griffey Jr. and the red hot Seattle Mariners in the ALCS, before heading into the Series against the Braves.

The 1995 Cleveland Indians featured a very impressive batting line-up; one that hit for high average, good power, and had good speed. In addition to leading the AL in batting average (0.291), the Indians in 1995 also led the American League in runs scored (840; 5.83 runs per game), home runs (207), and stolen bases (132). Led by speedsters Kenny Lofton and Omar Vizquel, along with Carlos Baerga at the top of the order, the Indians offense was powered in the middle of the order by Albert Belle, Eddie Murray, Manny Ramírez, and Jim Thome; at the bottom of the line-up could be found Paul Sorrento (or Herbert Perry) and Sandy Alomar Jr. (or Tony Peña). Thus, this Indians line-up had six everyday players who finished the season with a batting average of at least 0.300; and, with Herbert Perry and Tony Peña frequently filling in for Paul Sorrento and Sandy Alomar Jr., respectively, it was not uncommon for the Tribe to field a line-up with as many as eight players who finished the season with a batting average of at least 0.300. In terms of power, though the &#x27;95 season was shortened, nevertheless, the Indians&#x27; line-up still featured two players with at least 30 HR, five players with at least 20 HR, and seven with at least 10 HR. While this line-up was filled with star players (four, in fact, were named to the 1995 AL All-Star team, namely, Lofton, Baerga, Belle, and Ramirez), Albert Belle stood out among all of them in 1995. Powered by a very strong second half of the season, Belle, the Indians&#x27; clean-up hitter in 1995, finished 1995 with a 0.317 batting average, 126 RBI, and 50 home runs. Further to be noted is the fact that, in hitting 50 HR and 52 doubles in 1995, Belle became the first Major League player to hit at least 50 home runs and at least 50 doubles in the same season (an accomplishment which, again, is even more remarkable considering that he did this in a shortened, 144-game season).

The Indians also led the 1995 AL in ERA (3.81). While their starting pitching—led by veterans Dennis Martínez and Orel Hershiser—was respectable, it was their bullpen which gave real strength to their pitching staff. Key members of their bullpen staff included veteran right-hander Eric Plunk (6–2, 2.67 ERA), veteran left-hander Paul Assenmacher (6–2, 2.82), the young right-handed set-up man, Julián Tavárez (10–1, 2.44 ERA), and right-handed closer, José Mesa (3–0, 1.12 ERA, 46 SV). Mesa, in his first year as closer, posted a league-leading 46 saves in 1995, and set a then-Major League record of 38 consecutive saves without a blown save. Two of the members of the 1995 Indians&#x27; pitching staff—Dennis Martínez (the team&#x27;s ace) and José Mesa—were named to the 1995 AL All-Star team.

==Series build-up==

Thus it was that this Series presented an entertaining match-up of baseball&#x27;s two best teams, each with reasons to be confident going into the Series. The Atlanta Braves were veterans to the post-season in the 1990s, having won both the 1991 and 1992 NL pennants (not to mention the 1993 NL Western Division title, having won 104 games in 1993), and they were the best team in the NL in the 1995 regular season (having posted a very solid 90–54 record). The Cleveland Indians, on the other hand, newcomers to the post-season (having not been in the post-season since 1954), in posting their 100–44 regular season mark, were the team which had posted not only the best regular season record in the AL, but had completed one of the best regular seasons in all of Major League Baseball history. Further, though the Braves&#x27; line-up was not very threatening in 1995 (their .250 team batting average was the second lowest in the NL), still, the Braves could be confident with their star-studded pitching staff—especially their starting staff—headed by the likes of Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, and Steve Avery. On the other hand, though the Indians could not boast of having as nearly a strong starting rotation as the Braves, nevertheless, they could lay claim to a very solid bullpen and one of the greatest batting line-ups that baseball has ever seen.

It might also be noted that, though this was the first time that a team from Cleveland and one from Atlanta faced each other in the World Series, there were years, prior to the Braves being in Atlanta, in which the Braves faced a Cleveland team for baseball&#x27;s crown. In 1948, the Boston Braves faced the Cleveland Indians (with the Indians winning that Series in six games). Even before that, in 1892, the Boston Beaneaters, a forerunner of the Braves, were also National League Champions in 1892, and faced the Cleveland Spiders for the championship. The Beaneaters beat the Spiders that year to win that baseball championship.

The 1995 World Series was also noted for large-scale protests by Native American activists in response to the controversy surrounding both clubs&#x27; usage of Native American-themed nicknames, logos and mascots, as well as the use of the tomahawk chop by Braves fans.

==Broadcasting==
NBC was originally scheduled to televise the entire World Series; however, due to the cancellation of the 1994 World Series (which had been slated for ABC, who last televised a World Series in 1989), coverage ended up being split between NBC and ABC. Game 5 would be the last Major League Baseball game to be telecast by ABC (had there been a Game 7, ABC would have televised it) for 25 years. ABC was scheduled to televise up to four wild card games in the 2020 MLB Postseason.

This was the only World Series to be produced under &quot;The Baseball Network&quot; umbrella (a revenue sharing joint venture between Major League Baseball, ABC and NBC). In July 1995, NBC and ABC announced that they would be pulling out of what was supposed to be a six-year-long venture. NBC would next cover the 1997 (NBC&#x27;s first entirely since 1988) and 1999 World Series over the course of a five-year-long contract, in which Fox would cover the World Series in even numbered years (1996, 1998 and 2000).

Also during the World Series in 1995, NBC&#x27;s Hannah Storm not only became the first woman to serve as solo pre-game host of a World Series (CBS&#x27; Andrea Joyce co-hosted with Pat O&#x27;Brien in 1993) but also became the first woman to preside over a World Series Trophy presentation. Storm was infamously the recipient of a profane outburst from Albert Belle in his team&#x27;s dugout. Later, Belle was unrepentant: &quot;The Indians wanted me to issue a statement of regret when the fine was announced, but I told them to take it out. I apologize for nothing.&quot; John Saunders served as pre-game host for ABC&#x27;s coverage. Serving as field reporters for the series were Lesley Visser (ABC) and Jim Gray (NBC).

The six games averaged a national Nielsen rating of 19.5 and a share of 33. Through 2016, this remains the highest-rated World Series of the post-strike era.

On the radio side, CBS was the national broadcaster with Vin Scully and Jeff Torborg on the call. Locally, WKNR aired the series in Cleveland with Herb Score and Tom Hamilton announcing, while WSB broadcast the series in Atlanta with Skip Caray, Pete Van Wieren, Don Sutton, and Joe Simpson announcing.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===

Atlanta ace Greg Maddux pitched a two-hit complete game victory in his first World Series appearance (and just the 15th two-hitter in Series history).

The Indians scored in the first inning when Kenny Lofton reached on an error, stole second and third, and scored on an RBI groundout by Carlos Baerga. In the bottom of the second, Fred McGriff launched a tape measure home run on his first ever World Series pitch off Cleveland starter Orel Hershiser to even the score at 1–1. Both starters settled down until the seventh, when Hershiser and the Cleveland bullpen walked the first three Braves to open the inning. The Braves would take a 3–1 lead after Luis Polonia hit into a run-scoring force play and Rafael Belliard bunted a perfect suicide squeeze. Lofton scored the Indians another run in the ninth to cut the Braves lead to a single run, (both Cleveland runs resulted from errors and were thus, unearned) but Baerga lifted a pop fly that third baseman Chipper Jones grabbed near the visiting dugout to end the game.
===Game 2===

Atlanta No. 2 starter Tom Glavine got the win in Game 2, aided by a big sixth-inning home run by catcher Javy López, who also picked Manny Ramirez off first base at a crucial moment in the eighth inning to erase a potential game-tying baserunner. The Indians had taken an early 2–0 lead on an Eddie Murray two-run home run after Albert Belle got on base, but the Braves evened the score in the third with a sac fly by Chipper Jones and an RBI single by David Justice. Lopez launched his home run in the sixth inning from Cleveland starter Dennis Martínez. The Atlanta bullpen held off the Indians in the later innings despite allowing a run in the seventh, and Mark Wohlers earned the save, giving the Braves a 2–0 series lead.
===Game 3===

With the World Series moving to smaller, raucous Jacobs Field in Cleveland, the Indians got their first win. The Indians offense got back on track off Atlanta starter John Smoltz. With the Tribe already down 1–0 in the bottom of the first, Kenny Lofton singled to center and scored on Omar Vizquel&#x27;s triple into the right field corner. Omar then scored the go-ahead run when Carlos Baerga grounded out. In the third, the Tribe were back at it again when Lofton opened the inning by ripping a double into the right-center field gap. Omar then got a bunt single and Baerga singled to left to drive in Lofton. Albert Belle then rolled a grounder up the middle to score Vizquel to make it 4–1. This was Smoltz&#x27;s only early exit and only poor start in eight career World Series appearances. The Braves got a boost, however, when reliever Brad Clontz induced a double play groundout by Manny Ramírez to escape further damage. Home runs by Fred McGriff and Ryan Klesko brought the Braves closer at 4–3. Cleveland added a run in the seventh on another RBI hit by Baerga scoring Lofton (who would reach base in all six of his plate appearances). With a 5–3 lead going into the eighth, trouble brewed for Cleveland when Charles Nagy and the bullpen gave up the lead. Marquis Grissom led off with a double off the wall. Polonia singled through the right side to drive in Grissom, sending Nagy to the showers. Chipper Jones walked, McGriff hit a deep fly moving the runners up a base, and David Justice reached when Baerga booted his groundball, subsequently allowing Polonia to score the tying run. The inning was capped off by Mike Devereaux&#x27;s RBI single giving the Braves a 6–5 lead. The Braves couldn&#x27;t hold on to their slim lead either as Sandy Alomar Jr. laced a game-tying double inside the line at first in the bottom of the eighth. The two closers, Mark Wohlers and José Mesa then matched zeros for the next two innings. In the 11th, the Braves went to Alejandro Peña. Baerga immediately smashed a double and after an intentional walk to Belle, veteran Eddie Murray singled to center, scoring pinch runner Álvaro Espinoza and cutting Atlanta&#x27;s World Series lead in half.

A record 18 pitchers were used between the Braves and Indians in Games 2 and 3.
=== Game 4 ===

Braves manager Bobby Cox controversially decided to start left-handed pitcher Steve Avery in the critical Game 4 instead of coming back with Greg Maddux. Despite Avery&#x27;s uncharacteristically poor regular season showing (7-13, 4.67 ERA), Cox felt he deserved a chance after having won the NLCS clincher against Cincinnati throwing six shutout innings. Young Braves outfielder Ryan Klesko hit a sixth-inning home run to give Atlanta the lead. This would be the last time a player would hit home runs in back-to-back World Series games until 2016. Avery again delivered six effective innings, only giving up a sixth-inning home run to Cleveland slugger Albert Belle. A controversial play happened when Eddie Murray hit a pitch over third base; left-field umpire Jim McKean called it foul while third-base umpire Harry Wendelstedt looked at Jim McKean to make the call. Murray eventually walked and reached second on a balk by Avery, but Herbert Perry struck out to end the inning. The Braves promptly broke the tie with a three-run seventh, with David Justice batting in two of the runs with a single. An RBI double by Javy López gave the Braves an insurance run, making it 5–1. Reliever Pedro Borbón Jr. saved the 5–2 win after Mark Wohlers ran into trouble, and the Braves were one victory away from a title.
===Game 5===

It seemed the perfect situation for Atlanta with Greg Maddux pitching Game 5 with a chance to clinch the title, but Albert Belle slugged a two-run homer in the first inning, and the Braves lineup was held in check by Cleveland veteran Orel Hershiser who went eight innings, only surrendering two runs. Luis Polonia hit a solo home run into the fourth and Atlanta actually tied the game at 2–2 with a run-scoring infield single by Marquis Grissom in the fifth, but Cleveland got two more runs from Maddux making it 4–2. Jim Thome hit an insurance home run in the eighth, which proved necessary as Ryan Klesko homered in his third consecutive game, reducing the gap to 5–4. Klesko became the first person to homer in three consecutive World Series road games, by belting homers in Games 3, 4, and 5. The win sent the Series back to Atlanta.

As previously mentioned, this game was the most recent baseball game that ABC televised until the 2020 postseason.
===Game 6===

Controversy struck on the morning of Game 6 when Atlanta newspapers printed stories that right fielder David Justice had ripped the city&#x27;s fans for not matching their motivation of past seasons. Justice, who had been struggling in the postseason, was vilified before the game, but when his sixth-inning home run off a 1–1 pitch by Jim Poole broke a scoreless tie, he became a hero. Tom Glavine pitched eight innings of one-hit ball (and five innings of no hit ball) and allowed just three walks (two to Albert Belle, who was caught stealing second in the second inning to keep a runner from advancing into scoring position) to help earn him the Series MVP. Only one Indian advanced into scoring position in the entire game when Kenny Lofton stole second, but no one could get him in. Cleveland starter Dennis Martínez lasted just 4 innings due to allowing four hits and five walks, but no Braves scored. After Justice&#x27;s home run, the Braves managed just one hit. The lone hit for the Indians was a bloop-single by catcher Tony Peña in the sixth, breaking up Glavine&#x27;s bid to become the first pitcher since Don Larsen in 1956 to throw a no-hitter in the World Series. Closer Mark Wohlers pitched the ninth inning, preserving the 1–0 shutout and Atlanta&#x27;s coveted title when Carlos Baerga&#x27;s fly ball landed in center fielder Marquis Grissom&#x27;s glove, giving the Braves their first title in Atlanta and their first since 1957 when they were still in Milwaukee. Carlos Baerga was responsible for making the last out in three of the four Cleveland losses; Games 1, 2 and 6. To date, this is the last 1–0 World Series game won by the home team. Moments after the final out was recorded, a fan in the stands was shown holding a placard that simply said &quot;...Finally!&quot; due to the Atlanta Braves finally winning the World Series on their third try. 

In 1995, the Cleveland Indians batted .291 as a team, led the league in runs scored, hits, and stolen bases, and had eight .300 hitters in their starting lineup. However, the Tribe was held to a .179 batting average in the World Series.

Then-Executive Committee Chairman Bud Selig presided over the Commissioner&#x27;s Trophy presentation for the first time. In the previous two World Series (1992 and 1993), American League president Dr. Bobby Brown presided over the trophy presentation. Selig would become Commissioner of Baseball in 1998.

==Composite line score==

1995 World Series (4–2): Atlanta Braves (N.L.) over Cleveland Indians (A.L.)
==Aftermath==
The 1995 Braves were in the midst of a streak of 14 consecutive division titles from 1991 through 2005 (excluding the 1994 season, which ended early due to a players strike), however this was the only World Series the Braves would win. Atlanta returned to the Series the following year, but lost to the New York Yankees in six games. The Braves of this era made one more trip to the Series in , but lost to the Yankees in a four-game sweep. This was Atlanta&#x27;s first championship in any of the four major professional sports, and the last for the city and for the Braves until 2021.

The Indians would go on to win the AL Central five of the following six years and return to the World Series in , where they lost to the Florida Marlins in seven games. The core of the 1990s Indians teams would break up in the early 2000s. Albert Belle signed with the Chicago White Sox in free agency in the winter of 1996, while Kenny Lofton was traded to the Braves before the start of the 1997 season (he returned in 1998 to play three years with the team only to leave and return again for his final season in 2007); after the turn of the century, Manny Ramirez joined the Boston Red Sox in 2001 and Jim Thome joined the Philadelphia Phillies in 2003.

<text>The snowcocks or snowfowl are a group of bird species in the genus Tetraogallus of the pheasant family, Phasianidae. They are ground-nesting birds that breed in the mountain ranges of southern Eurasia from the Caucasus to the Himalayas and western China. Some of the species have been introduced into the United States. Snowcocks feed mainly on plant material.

==Characteristics==
Snowcocks are bulky, long-necked, long-bodied partridge-like birds. Males and females are generally similar in appearance but females tend to be slightly smaller and rather duller in colouration than males. They are generally grey with varying amounts of white, black and brown according to species and with distinctive white under tail-coverts. Their plumage is thick with a downy base to the feathers which helps them to withstand severe winter temperatures that may fall to . The colour of juvenile snowcocks is similar to the colour of the females and the young are not fully grown until their second year of life.

Snowcocks are heavy birds and are unable to fly far with flapping flight. Instead they run to a high point, launch themselves into the air and glide, gradually losing altitude. They are to be found on open slopes above the tree line where they feed on leaves, shoots, roots, fruits, berries and insects.

==Distribution==
The snowcocks are each endemic to different mountain ranges in Asia where they are normally found on open slopes above the tree line. Only in the case of the Himalayan snowcock and the Tibetan snowcock do their ranges overlap.

The Caucasian snowcock occurs in the Caucasus Mountains in Azerbaijan, Georgia and the Russian Federation. It has been introduced into the United States. The Caspian snowcock is native to eastern Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq and Georgia and has been introduced into the United States. The Tibetan snowcock is native to mountain ranges in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Tajikistan and China. The Himalayan snowcock occurs in mountainous areas of Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Nepal, India and China and has been introduced into the United States. The Altai snowcock is endemic to high altitudes in Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China and the Russian Federation.

==Species==
The five species within the genus along with subspecies are:

<doc id="1217915" wikidata="Q5185484" url="?curid=1217915" title="Crimes (album)">
<text>Crimes is the fourth studio album by the American band The Blood Brothers, released on October 12, 2004, by V2 Records. It was the band&#x27;s first major label album. Produced by John Goodmanson, the album was recorded in two months in the band&#x27;s hometown of Seattle.

==Lyrical content==
Much of the lyrics for the album are a political reaction to the mass media and the military policy of the Bush administration, inspired heavily by the election year of 2004. &quot;I thought the collective dissent of our generation would bring about positive change. When that didn&#x27;t happen I felt like the bottom had fallen out,&quot; vocalist Jordan Blilie commented.

* &quot;Feed Me to the Forest&quot; is &quot;a picture of the hyper-industrialized times we live in&quot;.
* &quot;Trash Flavored Trash&quot; is &quot;about the emptiness of news media&quot;.
* &quot;Teen Heat&quot; is about the distribution company Artistdirect with whom the band was having difficulties at the time.
* &quot;Celebrator&quot; and &quot;Devastator&quot; are direct criticisms of the United States&#x27; military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.

<doc id="1217923" wikidata="Q1700096" url="?curid=1217923" title="Sir John Fowler, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir John Fowler, 1st Baronet, KCMG, LLD, FRSE (15 July 1817 – 20 November 1898) was an English civil engineer specialising in the construction of railways and railway infrastructure. In the 1850s and 1860s, he was engineer for the world&#x27;s first underground railway, London&#x27;s Metropolitan Railway, built by the &quot;cut-and-cover&quot; method under city streets. In the 1880s, he was chief engineer for the Forth Bridge, which opened in 1890. Fowler&#x27;s was a long and eminent career, spanning most of the 19th century&#x27;s railway expansion, and he was engineer, adviser or consultant to many British and foreign railway companies and governments. He was the youngest president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, between 1865 and 1867, and his major works represent a lasting legacy of Victorian engineering.

==Early life==
Fowler was born in Wadsley, Sheffield, Yorkshire, England, to land surveyor John Fowler and his wife Elizabeth (née Swann). He was educated privately at Whitley Hall near Ecclesfield. He trained under John Towlerton Leather, engineer of the Sheffield waterworks, and with Leather&#x27;s uncle, George Leather, on the Aire and Calder Navigation and on railway surveys. From 1837 he worked for John Urpeth Rastrick on railway projects including the London and Brighton Railway and the unbuilt West Cumberland and Furness Railway. He then worked again for George Leather as resident engineer on the Stockton and Hartlepool Railway and was appointed engineer to the railway when it opened in 1841. Fowler initially established a practice as a consulting engineer in the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire area, but, a heavy workload led him to move to London in 1844. He became a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1847, the year the Institution was founded, and a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1849. On 2 July 1850 he married Elizabeth Broadbent (died 19 November 1901), daughter of J. Broadbent of Manchester. The couple had four sons.

==Railways==

Fowler established a busy practice, working on many railway schemes across the country. He became chief engineer for the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway and was engineer of the East Lincolnshire Railway, the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway and the Severn Valley Railway. In 1853, he became chief engineer of the Metropolitan Railway in London, the world&#x27;s first underground railway. Constructed in shallow &quot;cut-and-cover&quot; trenches beneath roads, the line opened between Paddington and Farringdon in 1863. Fowler was also engineer for the associated District Railway and the Hammersmith and City Railway. Today these railways form the majority of the London Underground&#x27;s Circle line. For his work on the Metropolitan Railway Fowler was paid the great sum of £152,000 (£ today), with £157,000 (£ today), from the District Railway. Although some of this would have been passed on to staff and contractors, Sir Edward Watkin, chairman of the Metropolitan Railway from 1872, complained that &quot;No engineer in the world was so highly paid.&quot;

Other railways that Fowler consulted for were the London Tilbury and Southend Railway, the Great Northern Railway, the Highland Railway and the Cheshire Lines Railway. Following the death of Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1859, Fowler was retained by the Great Western Railway. His various appointments involved him in the design of Victoria station in London, Sheffield Victoria station, St Enoch station in Glasgow, Liverpool Central station and Manchester Central station. The latter station&#x27;s wide train shed roof was the second widest unsupported iron arch in Britain after the roof of St Pancras railway station.

Fowler&#x27;s consulting work extended beyond Britain including railway and engineering projects in Algeria, Australia, Belgium, Egypt, France, Germany, Portugal and the United States. He travelled to Egypt for the first time in 1869 and worked on a number of, mostly unrealised, schemes for the Khedive, including a railway to Khartoum in Sudan which was planned in 1875 but not completed until after his death. In 1870 he provided advice to an Indian Government inquiry on railway gauges where he recommended a narrow gauge of for light railways. He visited Australia in 1886, where he made some remarks on the break of gauge difficulty. Later in his career, he was also a consultant with his partner Benjamin Baker and with James Henry Greathead on two of London&#x27;s first tube railways, the City and South London Railway and the Central London Railway.

==Bridges==

As part of his railway projects, Fowler designed numerous bridges. In the 1860s, he designed Grosvenor Bridge, the first railway bridge over the River Thames, and the 13-arch Dollis Brook Viaduct for the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway.

He is credited with the design of the Victoria Bridge at Upper Arley, Worcestershire, constructed between 1859 and 1861, and the near identical Albert Edward Bridge at Coalbrookdale, Shropshire built from 1863 to 1864. Both remain in use today carrying railway lines across the River Severn.

Following the collapse of Sir Thomas Bouch&#x27;s Tay Bridge in 1879, Fowler, William Henry Barlow and Thomas Elliot Harrison were appointed in 1881 to a commission to review Bouch&#x27;s design for the Forth Bridge. The commission recommended a steel cantilever bridge designed by Fowler and Benjamin Baker, which was constructed between 1883 and 1890.
==Locomotives==

To avoid problems with smoke and steam overwhelming staff and passengers on the covered sections of the Metropolitan Railway, Fowler proposed a fireless locomotive. The locomotive was built by Robert Stephenson and Company and was a broad gauge 2-4-0 tender engine. The boiler had a normal firebox connected to a large combustion chamber containing fire bricks which were to act as a heat reservoir. The combustion chamber was linked to the smokebox through a set of very short firetubes. Exhaust steam was re-condensed instead of escaping and fed back to the boiler. The locomotive was intended to operate conventionally in the open, but in tunnels dampers would be closed and steam would be generated firelessly, using the stored heat from the fire bricks. 

The first trial on the Great Western Railway in October 1861 was a failure. The condensing system leaked, causing the boiler to run dry and pressure to drop, risking a boiler explosion. A second trial on the Metropolitan Railway in 1862 was also a failure, and the fireless engine was abandoned, becoming known as &quot;Fowler&#x27;s Ghost&quot;. The locomotive was sold to Isaac Watt Boulton in 1865; he intended to convert it into a standard engine but it was eventually scrapped.

On opening, the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s trains were provided by the Great Western Railway, but these were withdrawn in August 1863. After a period hiring trains from the Great Northern Railway, the Metropolitan Railway introduced its own, Fowler designed, 4-4-0 tank engines in 1864. The design of condensing steam locomotives, known as the A class and, with minor updates, the B class, was so successful that the Metropolitan and District Railways eventually had 120 of the engines in use and they remained in operation until electrification of the lines in the 1900s. While they were not fireless, the locomotives condensed their steam, and burnt coke or smokeless coal to reduce smoke emitted.

==Other activities and professional recognition==

Fowler stood unsuccessfully for parliament as a Conservative candidate in 1880 and 1885. His standing within the engineering profession was very high, to the extent that he was elected president of the Institution of Civil Engineers for the period 1866–67, its youngest president. Through his position in the Institution and through his own practice, he led the development of training for engineers.

In 1865/67, he purchased the adjacent estates of Braemore and Inverbroom, near Ullapool in Ross-shire, Scotland, comprising 44,000 acres and becoming one of the premier Deer Forests (sporting estates) of the Highlands. He built the substantial Braemore House (since demolished), where he entertained at the highest levels of politics and society. He developed a hydro-electric scheme, fed from the artificial Home Loch, planted extensive woodlands on the steep valley sides, and created 12 km of recreational walks through them, including suspension footbridges over the Corrieshalloch and Strone Gorges (the former now an NTS property). He also developed a network of stalkerpaths. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace and a Deputy Lieutenant of the county. Lady Fowler here became a noted botanist.

He listed his recreations in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; as yachting and deerstalking and was a member of the Carlton Club, St Stephen&#x27;s Club, the Conservative Club and the Royal Yacht Squadron. He was also President of the Egyptian Exploration Fund. In 1885 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George as thanks from the government for allowing the use of maps of the Upper Nile valley he had had made when working on the Khedive&#x27;s projects. They were the most accurate survey of the area and were used in the British Relief of Khartoum.

In 1887 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

Following the successful completion of the Forth Bridge in 1890, Fowler was created Baronet Fowler of Braemor. Along with Benjamin Baker, he received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Edinburgh in 1890 for his engineering of the bridge. In 1892, the Poncelet Prize was doubled and awarded jointly to Baker and Fowler.

Fowler died in Bournemouth, Hampshire, at the age of 81 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son John Arthur Fowler, 2nd Baronet (died 25 March 1899). The baronetcy became extinct in 1933 on the death of Reverend Montague Fowler, 4th Baronet, the first baronet&#x27;s third son.

<text>The 1990 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1990 season. The 87th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the defending champions and heavily favored American League (AL) champion Oakland Athletics and the National League (NL) champion Cincinnati Reds. The Reds defeated the Athletics in a four-game sweep. It was the fifth four-game sweep by the NL and second by the Reds after they did it in 1976. It was the second consecutive World Series to end in a sweep, after the Athletics themselves did it to the San Francisco Giants in . It is remembered for Billy Hatcher&#x27;s seven consecutive hits. The sweep extended the Reds&#x27; World Series winning streak to nine games, dating back to . This also was the second World Series meeting between the two clubs (Oakland won four games to three in 1972). To date, this remains both teams&#x27; most recent appearance in the World Series.

Athletics manager Tony La Russa and Reds manager Lou Piniella were old friends and teammates from their Tampa American Legion Post 248 team.

== Background ==
=== Cincinnati Reds ===
The Cincinnati Reds won the National League West division by five games over the Los Angeles Dodgers. They set an NL record by staying in first place in the division for the entire season or &quot;wire-to-wire&quot;, which had been done only one other time, by the 1984 Detroit Tigers. The Reds then defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates, four games to two, in the National League Championship Series.

==== &quot;The Nasty Boys&quot; ====
The strength of the Cincinnati Reds bullpen and timely hitting led them to a quick sweep of the AL champions. The Reds&#x27; bullpen had three primary members—Norm Charlton, Randy Myers, and Rob Dibble—collectively they were known as the &quot;Nasty Boys&quot;, who wouldn&#x27;t let the A&#x27;s score against them in nearly nine innings of work. Media talk of a forthcoming A&#x27;s dynasty led Reds fans to call their own team the &quot;dyNASTY.&quot; The Nasty Boys originally referred to five pitchers, with the other two being Tim Layana and Tim Birtsas (though history relates it to the aforementioned three). On his XM show, Dibble still adds these two pitchers into the &quot;Nasty Boys&quot;, stating it was a collective bullpen effort.

=== Oakland Athletics ===
The Oakland Athletics won the American League West division by nine games over the Chicago White Sox. They then defeated the Boston Red Sox, four games to none, in the American League Championship Series.

The Athletics were the defending World Series champions, two-time defending American League champions, and heavy favorites against the Reds. The Athletics became the first franchise to appear in three consecutive World Series since the 1976–1978 New York Yankees. Their lineup included three former AL Rookies-of-the-Year: José Canseco (1986), Mark McGwire (1987), and Walt Weiss (1988), and six players who finished in the top twelve for AL MVP. A&#x27;s outfielder Willie McGee won a batting title that year, but it wasn&#x27;t the AL batting title. He batted .335 for the NL&#x27;s St Louis Cardinals (with enough plate appearances to qualify for the NL batting title) before he was traded in late August to Oakland.

Behind starter Dave Stewart and reliever Dennis Eckersley, the Athletics had won 306 games over the prior three seasons.

== Summary ==
== Matchups ==

=== Game 1 ===
The schedule called for the seven-game series to be held Tue–Wed, Fri–Sat–Sun, Tue–Wed. Games 5, 6, and 7, however, were not necessary. This was the first World Series to begin play on a Tuesday since , and the last until (all World Series between and , with the exception of this one, were scheduled to begin on a Saturday, while those from through featured Wednesday starts). The change in this instance was necessitated by an early season lockout which had caused the first week of the season to be postponed. In order to make up the postponed games, the regular season was extended by three days, causing the postseason to begin on a Thursday rather than a Tuesday, as had been the practice for many years.

When Oakland Athletics pitcher Dave Stewart entered to pitch Game 1, he had a six-game postseason winning streak going, which ended after four innings of work.

The Reds got out of the gate quickly with a two-run home run (that nearly hit the CBS television studio where anchor Pat O&#x27;Brien was sitting in left-center) from Eric Davis in the bottom of the first inning off A&#x27;s ace Dave Stewart. Billy Hatcher helped out offensively in a big way by starting his streak of seven straight hits in the series after a walk in the first inning. The Reds added to their lead when Barry Larkin drew a leadoff walk in the third and scored on a double by Hatcher, who moved to third on shortstop Mike Gallego&#x27;s throw to home, then scored on Paul O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s groundout. In the fifth, after a one-out double by Hatcher and an O&#x27;Neill walk off of Todd Burns, Davis&#x27;s RBI single made it 5–0 Reds and after a groundout moved the runners up, Chris Sabo&#x27;s two-run single capped the game&#x27;s scoring at 7–0. José Rijo settled in after the early lead with seven shutout innings. Two &quot;Nasty Boys,&quot; Rob Dibble and Randy Myers pitched the eighth and ninth innings and Cincinnati cruised to a surprise victory. The following day&#x27;s headline in &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot; captured the city&#x27;s surprise with the headline, &quot;Davis Stuns Goliath.&quot;
=== Game 2 ===
First Lady Barbara Bush threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Eventual Cy Young Award winner Bob Welch opposed postseason veteran Danny Jackson in Game 2. Rickey Henderson manufactured a run for the A&#x27;s in the first by getting a hit, stealing second, getting sacrificed to third by Carney Lansford, and scoring on a groundout by José Canseco. The Reds came right back in the bottom of the first. Barry Larkin and Billy Hatcher hit consecutive opposite field doubles and Hatcher would score on Davis&#x27;s groundout.

In the third the A&#x27;s got the lead back. José Canseco hit a rocket into the right-center field stands to tie the game (his only hit of the series). A base hit by Mark McGwire and two walks to Dave Henderson and Willie Randolph followed, knocking the ineffective Jackson out of the game. With the bases loaded, Ron Hassey hit a sac fly off new pitcher Scott Scudder to score McGwire and Mike Gallego singled to center off Scudder to score Dave Henderson to give the A&#x27;s a 4–2 lead.

The A&#x27;s, however, would not score any more runs thanks to the relief pitching of Scudder, All-Star game starter Jack Armstrong, and the threesome nicknamed the &quot;Nasty Boys&quot;: Rob Dibble, Norm Charlton, and Randy Myers.

The Reds got a run closer at 4–3 on pinch hitter Ron Oester&#x27;s RBI single that drove in Joe Oliver in the fourth; incidentally, this would be the last plate appearance of Oester&#x27;s career, all 13 seasons of which were spent in Cincinnati. The Reds tied it in the eighth when Hatcher tripled over the crippled Canseco (who was suffering from back spasms throughout the playoffs) and scored on pinch-hitter Glenn Braggs&#x27;s force play (after O&#x27;Neill was walked to set it up). Welch would be charged with all four runs in innings and Rick Honeycutt was charged with a blown save after allowing Hatcher to score.

During Game 2, Reds pitcher Tom Browning&#x27;s pregnant wife Debbie went into labor during the game. Debbie left her seat in the fifth inning to drive herself to the hospital, and Browning, thinking he wouldn&#x27;t be asked to pitch as he was scheduled to start Game 3, followed her soon after. As the game went on, the Reds wanted Browning ready to pitch just in case the game went well into extra innings. Unable to find Browning, and surmising he was at a hospital with his wife, the Reds had their radio broadcaster Marty Brennaman put out an All Points Bulletin on Browning. This bulletin was picked up by Tim McCarver on CBS television, who passed it along in the tenth inning. Browning heard McCarver&#x27;s message on a TV at the hospital and debated leaving while the tenth inning started.

In the tenth, the Reds broke through to win the game off A&#x27;s closer Dennis Eckersley. Utilityman Billy Bates chopped an infield single off home plate to start the inning. Chris Sabo singled to left to put runners on first and second. Then Oliver hit a bouncer that hopped over third base and down the line in left to drive in Bates with a walk-off hit. According to Browning, his son, Tucker, was born right after the game ended.

This was the last of five World Series to be played at Riverfront Stadium (, , , , and 1990), which was closed and demolished in 2002. , Great American Ball Park, the Reds current home field, has yet to host a World Series.

=== Game 3 ===
In Game 3 the Reds took a 3–0 series lead on the defending champs. Tom Browning (two days after becoming a father) started for the Reds while Mike Moore, who had two wins in the 1989 World Series (alongside Dave Stewart), got the assignment for Oakland despite struggling throughout the regular season. In the second inning, Chris Sabo put the Reds up 1–0 with a solo homer. The lead was short lived as DH Harold Baines hit a soaring two-run homer after a Dave Henderson double to give the A&#x27;s a 2–1 lead in the bottom of the second.

In the third, the Reds&#x27; seven-run inning began with Billy Hatcher&#x27;s eighth hit in nine at-bats (he had rapped into a double-play in the first inning ending his streak of seven straight hits). Paul O&#x27;Neill then singled off the glove of first baseman Mark McGwire to put runners on first and second. Eric Davis drilled a sharp single to center scoring Hatcher to tie the game and advancing O&#x27;Neill to third. Following an RBI groundout by DH Hal Morris that put the Reds ahead, the Reds went up 5–2 when Sabo hit his second homer of the game into the left field stands. Todd Benzinger, the Reds&#x27; first baseman then singled and Joe Oliver hit an RBI double. Mariano Duncan drove Oliver home with a single, stole second, and scored himself when Barry Larkin hit a gapper. The A&#x27;s now trailed the Reds 8–2. Rickey Henderson&#x27;s third inning home run made it 8–3, but Tom Browning pitched effectively for six innings to earn the victory. Dibble and Myers provided three scoreless innings in relief to put the Reds one win away from the title.

=== Game 4 ===
The first pitch was thrown out by former Oakland A&#x27;s outfielder Joe Rudi. who was a member of the 3 straight championshipships won in 1972, 1973 and 1974. Game 4 was a pitchers&#x27; duel between Dave Stewart and José Rijo (the Game 1 starters) that eventually culminated in the Reds sweeping the series. Despite a 3–0 series lead, the Reds&#x27; advantage became tenuous early on when two cornerstones of their lineup—Davis and Hatcher—had to be removed from the game with injuries. Hatcher was hit on the hand by a pitch in the first inning. He was taken to the hospital for X-rays but was found to have only a severe bruise and would likely have been day-to-day had the series continued. Davis&#x27;s injury was more serious and would have been series-ending. Chasing a fly ball, he fell hard on his elbow jammed into his side, and sustained both a rib cage injury and a kidney laceration. He was also taken to the hospital and, unlike Hatcher, never returned to the park that night. (He remained hospitalized in Oakland for another week, leading to a public relations debacle when Reds owner Marge Schott made him charter a medically equipped flight back to Cincinnati at his own expense, though Schott later reimbursed him after criticisms from the media.) The A&#x27;s got on the board in the first when Willie McGee doubled and Carney Lansford singled him in. The game remained 1–0 until the eighth when the Reds finally got to Stewart. Barry Larkin singled up the middle, Herm Winningham followed with a bunt that he beat out for a base hit, and Paul O&#x27;Neill reached on a throwing error by Stewart to load the bases. Glenn Braggs&#x27; groundout and Hal Morris&#x27;s sacrifice fly gave the Reds a 2–1 edge, which was preserved by both Rijo, who at one point retired 20 straight batters, and Randy Myers who got the final two outs. The A&#x27;s became the first team ever to be swept in a World Series after sweeping the League Championship Series. This was later duplicated by the 2007 Colorado Rockies and the 2012 Detroit Tigers. Additionally, this was the first time since - (when the New York Yankees won both times; the Yankees also did it in and ) that two consecutive World Series ended in a four-game sweep, which would be repeated in - (both won by the Yankees), and again in - (won by the Boston Red Sox and Chicago White Sox, respectively).

Cincinnati Reds&#x27; pitcher José Rijo became the second Dominican born player to earn World Series MVP honors. Pedro Guerrero of the Los Angeles Dodgers in , along with his co-MVP teammates Ron Cey and Steve Yeager was the first Dominican born to earn World Series MVP. Fourteen years after Rijo&#x27;s award, (), Manny Ramírez of the Boston Red Sox became the third.
Other Series heroes included Reds third baseman Chris Sabo who went 9 of 16 (.562) with 2 home runs; and Reds outfielder Billy Hatcher, who set a World Series record with seven consecutive hits. In addition, Hatcher&#x27;s .750 batting average (9 for 12) broke a four-game-Series mark set by Babe Ruth (.625 in ). Both Sabo and Hatcher were strong candidates to be named the Most Valuable Player. Hatcher, however, got the consolation prize of winning the Babe Ruth Award for his World Series performance. Shortly after the series, Athletics owner Walter Haas issued a public apology to the City of Oakland for his team&#x27;s performance, while at the same time assuring the fans that plans to put the team together for 1991 would begin immediately.

1990 World Series (4–0): Cincinnati Reds (N.L.) over Oakland Athletics (A.L.)
== Radio and television coverage ==
CBS Sports covered the World Series as part of the new contract it had signed with Major League Baseball. The broadcast was led by Jack Buck, who had called the previous six World Series for CBS Radio. Serving as analyst was Tim McCarver, who had joined the CBS broadcast team after working for ABC Sports since 1983. Jim Kaat and Lesley Visser served as field reporters, while Pat O&#x27;Brien hosted the pregame and postgame shows. The World Series was the third major sporting event to be broadcast by CBS in 1990; the network aired Super Bowl XXIV in January of 1990 and carried its last NBA Finals in the spring. 

CBS Radio continued to serve as the nationwide radio home of the World Series for a fifteenth consecutive year. For the first time since 1982, Vin Scully served as the lead broadcaster; he had left CBS after losing out on a chance to be its lead NFL voice and had spent the previous seven years as NBC Sports&#x27; lead baseball voice. Johnny Bench returned for a second consecutive series as analyst, with John Rooney hosting the pregame and postgame shows for a third consecutive year.

== Aftermath ==
The 1990 World Series would be the Reds&#x27; fifth championship but would also be remembered as one of the biggest upsets in baseball history. The twelve game differential between the teams&#x27; regular season records made this one of only two times in World Series history that a team swept an opponent whose regular season record bested theirs by ten games or more, the other being the 1954 New York Giants, who swept the 14-games-better Cleveland Indians. The Reds 22-8 scoring margin was the same scoring margin from their last World Series win in 1976 over the Yankees which also was a sweep.

The Oakland Athletics were initially favored to win a fourth consecutive American League pennant in 1991, but their pitching that had led the American League by a wide margin in 1990 failed the team in 1991. Staff ace Dave Stewart, whose 1991 ERA (5.18) was more than twice his 1990 ERA (2.56). 1990 Cy Young Award winner Bob Welch fared almost as poorly; his earned run average swelled from 2.95 (1990) to 4.58 (1991). In 1990, he had won a league-high 27 games; in 1991, he won a mere 12. The A&#x27;s team ERA of 4.57 was the 2nd worst in the American League. At the plate, Mark McGwire hit just .201, suffering through a self described “worst year of his life”. On a positive note, Rickey Henderson stole his 938th career base on May 1; in doing so, he succeeded Lou Brock as MLB&#x27;s career stolen base leader.

Oakland would return to contention in 1992 with a record of 96-66. The 1991 season still, however, marked the end of the Athletics as a dynastic power. The 1992 team failed to dominate the league in the manner that the 1988–90 teams had; following that team&#x27;s six-game ALCS defeat to the eventual world champion Toronto Blue Jays, Oakland wouldn&#x27;t reach the postseason until 2000. This World Series would also be the last hurrah of the Bash Brothers duo of Canseco and McGwire. After playing together for four full seasons, the two would continue to play together for the entire 1991 season and the first half of the following year before Canseco was traded to the Texas Rangers midway through the 1992 season.

As it turned out, the Nasty Boys bullpen trio of Norm Charlton, Rob Dibble and Randy Myers would only play together for two seasons. Myers left after the 1991 season. Charlton, having played for the team since 1988, left after the 1992 season. Dibble, also a Red since 1988, left the following year in 1993. As such, none of the players were present for the next postseason appearance for the Reds, which was in 1995.

This was the last championship of the four major North American sports leagues won by a team from Ohio until the Cleveland Cavaliers made and won the 2016 NBA Finals. This is also the most recent sports championship for the city of Cincinnati.

To date, this is the last time either team has appeared in the World Series. As a result, this would prove to be the Athletics&#x27; final World Series appearance while the team was based in Oakland, as they will temporarily move to Sacramento in 2025 while a new ballpark in Las Vegas is constructed with the expectation it will open in time for the 2028 season. This was also the final World Series to feature a team that wore pullover jerseys (Cincinnati).

<text>The Caucasian snowcock (Tetraogallus caucasicus) is a snowcock in the pheasant family Phasianidae of the order Galliformes, gallinaceous birds.

It is native to the Caucasus Mountains, particularly the Western Caucasus, where it breeds at altitudes from 2000 to 4000 m on bare stony mountains. It nests in a bare ground scrape and lays typically 5-6 greenish eggs, which are incubated only by the female. Its food is seeds and vegetable matter. It forms small flocks when not breeding.

== Description ==
This is a long bird. Its plumage is patterned with grey, brown, white and black, but this snowcock looks grey from any distance. The breast is darker and the flanks ruddier than the rest of the body. It has a white throat and a white patch on the side of the neck. The nape is rust-coloured.

In flight, this wary bird shows white flight feathers and undertail, and reddish sides to the tail. Male and female plumages are similar, but the juvenile is slightly smaller and duller in appearance.

Caucasian snowcock has a desolate whistling song, vaguely like a Eurasian curlew, &#x27;. The calls include loud cackles and bubbled &#x27;.

<doc id="1217953" wikidata="Q7823918" url="?curid=1217953" title="Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind">
<text>Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind: 30 Plays in 60 Minutes (Too Much Light or TML) was the longest running show in the history of theater in Chicago and was the only open-run Off-Off-Broadway show in New York. The show was originally performed by the Neo-Futurists, an experimental theater troupe of which creator Greg Allen was a founding member. Opening in Chicago December 2, 1988, the show ran 50 weekends of the year through 2016. As its subtitle states, the show consists of 30 original short plays performed in 60 minutes. All were written, directed, and performed by an ensemble. The plays tend to be a mixture of autobiography, performance art, and living newspaper.

==History==
Neo-Futurism as an aesthetic, as well as the format of TML, are both creations of Neo-Futurist Founding Director Greg Allen. The Neo-Futurism aesthetic is an updating of the early 20th century Italian Futurism movement with hefty doses of Fluxus, Dada, Surrealism, Brecht, Boal, and performance art thrown in. Greg Allen came up with the name from a case study of a young autistic child who would smash light bulbs and repeat, &quot;Too much light makes the baby go blind. Too much light makes the baby go blind.&quot; Later, when he was creating this show, the saying came back to his mind.

Subsequent productions were staged by branches of the Neo-Futurists in New York (1995-1998, 2004-2016), San Francisco (2013-2016), and Montreal (2007-2012). A London production was staged in 2016 as part of plans for a permanent UK-based ensemble.

From 1990 to 2014, numerous volumes of plays from the show have been published. The book &quot;Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind: 90 Plays from the First 25 Years&quot; published by Playscripts has been produced all over the world with over 100 productions a year.

In November 2016, Allen revoked the Chicago Neo-Futurists&#x27; rights to perform &quot;Too Much Light&quot; in a public announcement. Allen&#x27;s revocation of the performance rights did not extend to the New York, San Francisco, and London branches of the Neo-Futurists. However, in solidarity with the Chicago branch, the New York and San Francisco branches ended their runs of &quot;Too Much Light&quot;. All three ensembles continue to develop and perform their own two-minute plays in a late night show called &quot;The Infinite Wrench&quot;, which premiered in 2017, while the London ensemble Degenerate Fox performs the similar show &quot;The Dirty Thirty&quot;.

Allen subsequently founded the Detroit-based UnTheatre Company, which currently continues to produce &quot;Too Much Light&quot;.

==Tone of the show==
The show is the work of the Neo-Futurism movement, a variant of the Italian Futurism movement and reflects their aesthetic of non-illusory theater, where, as Allen states it, &quot;all of our plays are &#x27;set&#x27; on the stage in front of the audience. All of our &#x27;characters&#x27; are ourselves... We do not aim to &#x27;suspend the audience&#x27;s disbelief&#x27; but to create a world where the stage is a continuation of daily life.&quot;

==Structure==
The structure of TML since 1988 has remained consistent: a random ticket price for the show is determined by the roll of a die with a fixed amount (currently $9 for the Detroit show) being added for each person. Upon payment, a member of the ensemble wearing noise-canceling headphones asks &quot;What&#x27;s your name?&quot; of the audience member before giving them a name tag with an erroneous or approximate &quot;name&quot; on it. Audience members are then given a &quot;menu&quot; of the play titles for that evening from which the plays are selected by audience members calling out their number - the first number heard by the ensemble being the play performed. Plays begin with the word &quot;Go!&quot; and end when a member of the cast calls &quot;Curtain!&quot; Many of the plays contain elements of randomness and audience interaction. The list of plays is perpetually rotating. Every week between two and twelve plays (determined by two rolls of a die by someone in the audience) are removed from the &quot;menu&quot; and replaced with new plays, written and staged over the course of the week.

As part of an interactive tradition, when a particular evening sells out, the cast orders pizza from a local restaurant, allowing the audience to order toppings. Only a single pizza is ordered, however, which the entire audience must share.

<doc id="1217959" wikidata="Q747601" url="?curid=1217959" title="1989 World Series">
<text>The 1989 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1989 season. The 86th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Oakland Athletics and the National League (NL) champion San Francisco Giants. The Series ran from October 14 through October 28, with the Athletics sweeping the Giants in four games. It was the first World Series sweep since 1976, when the Cincinnati Reds swept the New York Yankees.

This marked the fourth World Series matchup, and first since 1913, between the two franchises. The previous three matchups occurred when the Giants were in New York and the Athletics resided in Philadelphia. The then New York Giants defeated the Philadelphia Athletics in the 1905 World Series four games to one, the Athletics defeating the Giants in the 1911 World Series four games to two, and then again in the 1913 Fall Classic four games to one. The series would be historic in other ways as well: the 76-year gap between matchups was the longest in World Series history, a record this World Series would hold until 2018 when the Red Sox and Dodgers met for their first World Series meeting in 102 years; it also marked the first time two franchises had faced off in the World Series after having once played each other when both were based in a different city.

Fay Vincent, who had just taken over as the commissioner of baseball after the sudden death of his predecessor Bart Giamatti in September, presided over his first World Series and dedicated it to his predecessor&#x27;s memory.

This Series was also known as the &quot;[[Bay Bridge Series]],&quot; &quot;[[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] Series,&quot; &quot;Battle of the Bay,&quot; and &quot;[[Earthquake]] Series&quot;; the two participant cities lie on opposite sides of San Francisco Bay, connected by the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge and the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system, and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred before the start of Game 3. It was the first cross-town World Series (involving two teams from the same metropolitan area) since 1956, and only the third such series that did not involve New York City (the 1906 and 1944 World Series, which featured matchups between the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox and the St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Browns respectively, were the others). Until 2023, this marked the last time that consecutive championships were won by different teams from the same state.

Prior to the start of Game 3 on October 17, at about 5:04 PM PDT, the Loma Prieta earthquake struck, damaging Oakland and San Francisco (particularly the Cypress Street Viaduct in the former and the Marina District in the latter) as well as the Bay Bridge&#x27;s upper deck. Candlestick Park in San Francisco suffered damage to its upper deck as pieces of concrete fell from the baffle at the top of the stadium and the power was knocked out. The game was postponed out of concerns for the safety of everyone in the ballpark as well as the loss of power. The series resumed on October 27 and finished the next day.

At the time, October 28 was the latest end date ever for a World Series, surpassing the 1986 World Series by one day, even though the 1986 series went the maximum seven games and the 1989 series only lasted the minimum four games. Had the Series run the full seven games, a Major League Baseball game would have been played in November for the first time in history.

==Background==

This was the third all-California World Series (1974, 1988). The San Francisco Giants won the NL West division by three games over the San Diego Padres, then defeated the Chicago Cubs four games to one in the National League Championship Series. The Oakland Athletics won the AL West division by seven games over the Kansas City Royals, then defeated the Toronto Blue Jays four games to one in the American League Championship Series.

It was the Giants&#x27; first World Series appearance since , while the Athletics were playing in their second straight Fall Classic following the Series.

==Summary==
 Game 3 was originally slated for October 17 at 5:35 pm; however, it was postponed when an earthquake occurred at 5:04 pm.

==Matchups==

===Game 1===
Prior to Game 1, a tribute to late Commissioner Bart Giamatti was held; Giamatti&#x27;s son Marcus threw out the first pitch, and the Whiffenpoofs from Yale University (Giamatti&#x27;s alma mater) sang the national anthem. Dave Stewart, the Athletics&#x27; ace, took on Giants pitcher Scott Garrelts in Game 1 of the Bay Bridge series.

Oakland took the lead in the bottom of the second when Dave Henderson walked, advanced to second on a Terry Steinbach single, and scored on another single by Tony Phillips that moved Steinbach up to third. Walt Weiss then sent a soft ground ball toward first, but Giants first baseman (and NLCS MVP) Will Clark threw the ball low and to the right of catcher Terry Kennedy. Steinbach knocked the ball out of Kennedy&#x27;s mitt, scoring the second run of the inning. Kennedy was charged with an error, and Phillips advanced to second. Rickey Henderson then drove in Phillips on a single to right field; the second inning ended with Oakland leading 3–0.

A&#x27;s designated hitter Dave Parker tattooed a home run to lead off the third off of Garrelts, and Weiss added a lead off home run in the fourth. Oakland starter Stewart dominated the Giants, allowing five hits in a complete game, handing the A&#x27;s a one-game edge in the Series. &quot;We ran into a buzz saw&quot;, Clark said of Stewart&#x27;s pitching.

===Game 2===
Little League World Series MVP and future NHL star Chris Drury threw out the ceremonial first pitch in Game 2. Oakland starter Mike Moore took on Giant Rick Reuschel.

Oakland got off to a fast start; Rickey Henderson led off the bottom of the first with a walk. Henderson promptly stole second, and scored one pitch later when Carney Lansford hit a double to right field. The Giants scored their first run of the Series in the top of the third; José Uribe reached first on a fielder&#x27;s choice, advanced to third via a Brett Butler single, and scored on a Robby Thompson sacrifice fly.

The A&#x27;s regained the lead in the bottom of the 4th when Dave Parker drove a line shot off the wall that was both an inch from being foul and an inch from being a home run. Jose Canseco, who drew a walk earlier that inning, scored on the play. Parker stood at the plate for a moment to watch the flight of the ball, and started to run as soon as the ball hit the wall; Giants right fielder Candy Maldonado appeared to throw Parker out at second, but second base umpire Dutch Rennert called Parker safe. After Dave Henderson walked and Mark McGwire struck out, Terry Steinbach hit a three-run home run off Reuschel to left field, scoring both Parker and Henderson. The Giants had no answer for Oakland&#x27;s relievers, and the A&#x27;s won 5–1 and took a 2–0 lead in the Series.

===The Loma Prieta earthquake===

The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake struck on October 17, 1989, at 5:04 p.m. Game 3 was scheduled to start at 5:35 p.m. at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, and thousands of people were already in the stadium when the quake hit. It was the first major earthquake in the United States to be broadcast by live television. Experts credit the timing of the World Series as a lucky break that prevented massive loss of life in the region; key in reducing the loss of life was the fact that many people on both sides of the bay had left work early or were staying late to participate in after-work group viewings and parties, reducing the traffic that would otherwise have been on the collapsed freeways at 5:04 p.m. on a Tuesday (42 people had died in the collapse of the Cypress Street Viaduct in Oakland). A Goodyear Blimp that was covering the telecast was used to coordinate emergency efforts.

At the time the earthquake hit, ABC&#x27;s crew was in the booth as Tim McCarver was presenting a highlight package. The earthquake hit while the video was playing and temporarily knocked the feed out, and just before it was knocked out Al Michaels could be heard on air saying &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you what, we&#x27;re having an earth-&quot; with the feed cutting out just before he finished. The feed ended up being replaced with a green ABC Sports &quot;World Series&quot; telop graphic as used for technical difficulties. Michaels, McCarver, and third man in the booth Jim Palmer grabbed for whatever they could to brace themselves and grabbed on to one another&#x27;s legs, leaving all three men with thigh bruises. The audio was restored, first to be heard was the sound of the fans cheering, then Michaels began talking over a screen bumper until the video was restored jokingly saying that the earthquake was the &quot;greatest opening in the history of television, bar none!&quot;

By contrast, the broadcasting team in the CBS Radio booth next door, consisting of Jack Buck, Johnny Bench, and John Rooney, was off the air when the earthquake started because their show was in a pretaped segment being played from New York. Bench ran to a spot underneath a steel grate, to which Buck later quipped, &quot;If he moved that fast when he played, he&#x27;d never hit into a double play. I never saw anyone move that fast in my life.&quot;

The ESPN live coverage of the Series (ESPN and ABC at the time produced separate broadcasts) was interrupted during then-television analyst Joe Torre&#x27;s pre-game report on the field. Their equipment van was the only one with a generator, and they continued their live coverage with Chris Berman and Bob Ley.

In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, ABC aired a rerun of &quot;Roseanne&quot; (and later, &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;) before Ted Koppel began anchoring news coverage from Washington, with Michaels acting as a de facto reporter. The Goodyear Blimp (which was already aloft for the game) provided video of structural damage and fires within the city. The ABC opening for this telecast (leading up to Al Michaels informing the viewers of the earthquake) was used at the beginning of a 1990 television movie (documenting the Loma Prieta earthquake) called &quot;After the Shock&quot;.

As for the Series itself, Fay Vincent decided to postpone Game 3 initially for five days, resulting in the longest delay in World Series history. Vincent told no one before doing so, resulting in an umpire protest, although the original reason for the postponement was loss of power in the stadium, concern about possible structural damage, and the danger of possible aftershocks. It was postponed for another five days (until October 27) because of delays in restoring transmission links. Then San Francisco mayor Art Agnos wanted to wait a month before resuming it, with Vincent responding to Agnos by telling him that he might move it elsewhere if the delay would be that long. With that, Vincent quickly had several other National and American League parks put on standby, including Wrigley Field and Comiskey Park in Chicago, the Kingdome in Seattle, the Astrodome in Houston, or Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium in New York City. (Moving the game to the opponents&#x27; stadium was not an option, because the Oakland A&#x27;s were also based in the SF Bay area. Also, it was noted in the news media that there were three major league stadiums in southern California.)

Players for the Oakland Athletics returned home, but had to travel via State Route 237 in San Jose, adding an extra 90 minutes due to the collapse of the Bay Bridge and the I-880 Cypress Street Viaduct along with the closures of the San Mateo–Hayward and Dumbarton Bridges. Not long after returning, Jose Canseco (still in full uniform) and his wife Esther were spotted filling up their car at a self-service gas station. As noted in his later book &quot;&quot;, Canseco noted that someone wrote an article portraying him as chauvinistic forcing his wife to pump the gas, but that in reality, she told him to let her do it because if people saw him in his full uniform, it would cause a scene.

The earthquake would affect the National Anthem performances for the games at Candlestick Park as well. Stevie Wonder, who was slated to play the National Anthem on his harmonica at Game 3 on October 17, pulled out days following the earthquake, and in his place Larry Gatlin and the Gatlin Brothers, who had been slated to perform at Game 4 on October 18, would sing the National Anthem when Game 3 was finally played on October 27.

===Game 3===
During the ten-day delay, Candlestick Park was inspected, and found to have only minor damage. This was quickly repaired, and the stadium was deemed safe to use. At the start of Game 3, emergency responders who had aided during the earthquake, including police officers and firefighters, were honored and threw out the ceremonial first pitch. The starters were the Game 1 starters, Stewart and Garrelts. The ten-day delay due to the earthquake allowed both staff aces to start.

Dave Henderson just missed hitting three home runs for the A&#x27;s as his first inning shot bounced off the top of the wall for a double.

Giants catcher Bill Bathe became the fifth National League player in World Series history to hit a home run in his very first at-bat.

When Game 3 was originally scheduled for October 17, the scheduled starting pitchers were Bob Welch for the A&#x27;s and Don Robinson for the Giants. Meanwhile, Ken Oberkfell was slated to start at third base for the Giants, with Matt Williams moving over to shortstop instead of the benched José Uribe. Also, Pat Sheridan was slated to take over for Candy Maldonado in right field for the Giants. Maldonado told ESPN that he was in the clubhouse getting ready when the earthquake hit. The first person he saw in the midst of all of this was his teammate, Robinson, who told Maldonado that he sensed that an earthquake was occurring. For Oakland, Ron Hassey was slated to be the starting catcher for Game 3 in place of Terry Steinbach, as Hassey was at the time Welch&#x27;s personal catcher.

This game set a record for most combined HRs hit in a World Series game (7) as well as tying a record for most HRs hit by a single team (5) in a World Series game (the New York Yankees won Game 4 of the 1928 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, which like this series, would end in a sweep). This record for combined HRs in a World Series game would endure until Game 2 in 2017, in which the Astros and Dodgers combined for 8 HRs.

===Game 4===
At the time, October 28 was the latest end date ever for a World Series, even though the series only lasted the minimum four games. (The 1981 Series, which went six games, had also ended on October 28. This record was tied again in 1995, and has since been surpassed several times, beginning with the terrorism-delayed 2001 Series, which ran from October 27 through November 4. 

The World Series now regularly concludes at the end of October or beginning of November due to the addition of the Division Series and Wild Card Games to the postseason.) After Nell Carter sang the National Anthem, Willie Mays (who was initially scheduled to throw out the first pitch on October 17 and was about to be interviewed by ABC&#x27;s Joe Morgan when the earthquake hit) threw out the ceremonial first pitch.

The A&#x27;s led from the first batter of the game on as Rickey Henderson&#x27;s home run set the tone. Kevin Mitchell&#x27;s homer would bring the Giants closer as they cut an 8–0 deficit to 8–6 in two innings. But it would prove to be too little too late for San Francisco as they would lose 9–6.

This was also Candlestick Park&#x27;s final World Series game. The Giants&#x27; four subsequent National League pennants have come since their move to Oracle Park, in 2002, 2010, 2012 and 2014 (with the last three appearances also ending in World Series championships).

Out of respect for the Loma Prieta earthquake victims, the Oakland Athletics chose not to celebrate their World Series victory with champagne, as is normally customary for the winning team in the World Series.

===Composite box===
1989 World Series (4–0): Oakland Athletics (A.L.) beat San Francisco Giants (N.L.).
==Radio and television coverage==
ABC play-by-play man Al Michaels, who spent three years in San Francisco as an announcer for the San Francisco Giants, was nominated for an Emmy Award for news broadcasting after giving an eyewitness account of the aftermath of the earthquake at Candlestick Park.

This would be the last World Series that ABC would televise from start to finish (and also the last they would produce themselves), and Game 4 was the last MLB game on ABC until July 1994. The television rights would move exclusively to CBS the following year (ABC had shared coverage with NBC since 1976 up until the end of the 1989 season). ABC would next televise a World Series in 1995, but only broadcast Games 1, 4, and 5 (the other games were covered by NBC, who had a joint venture with ABC and MLB called The Baseball Network).

Due in part to the earthquake and subsequent interruption of play, as well as the four-game sweep by the Athletics, ABC only drew an overall Nielsen rating of 16.4 for the Series. This was the first World Series since the introduction of prime-time games in 1971 to draw a rating of less than 20.

As previously mentioned, CBS Radio also covered the Series. Jack Buck returned for his seventh and last World Series as the radio voice for CBS, as he was to move to the television side the next year. He was joined by Johnny Bench as his analyst, who replaced Bill White when he was appointed to replace Giamatti as president of the National League earlier in the year. Buck was replaced by Vin Scully the next year, who made his return to CBS Radio following NBC Sports&#x27; loss of television rights to CBS. Bench covered four more World Series for CBS Radio with the 1993 series being his last.

==Aftermath==
1989 would turn out be the A’s final championship in Oakland, as the team left the city for Sacramento in 2024, to play as the Athletics, while preparing to relocate and play in Las Vegas as the Las Vegas Athletics in 2027.

The A&#x27;s would return to the World Series the following season, making it three years in a row. However, they were unsuccessful in defending their championship as the Cincinnati Reds swept them in 4 games. 

The Athletics have not returned to the World Series since then and has only made two appearances in the American League Championship Series—losing in 1992 to the Toronto Blue Jays and in 2006 to the Detroit Tigers—and a total of 12 times in the postseason (1992, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2018, 2019 and 2020) since the 1990 Series. At the time of the 1989 World Series, the Athletics had not seen a World Series win since .

The Giants, meanwhile, failed to repeat as National League Champions and would not return to the playoffs until 1997, when they were swept by the Florida Marlins in the NLDS. The Giants would not return to the World Series until , when they lost a seven-game series to the Anaheim Angels after holding a 3–2 series lead. It took the Giants until 2010 to get back to the World Series, and they won their first world championship since 1954, when the team was still located in New York, by defeating the Texas Rangers in five games. In , the Giants would go back to the World Series and defeat the Detroit Tigers in a four-game sweep, and in they would beat the Kansas City Royals in seven games to capture their third World Series crown in five seasons.

On the A&#x27;s, players Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco would later play for other teams. McGwire would be traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1997, where he would beat Roger Maris&#x27; single-season home run record in 1998 and retire as a Cardinal in 2001. Canseco was traded during the 1992 season to the Texas Rangers and after that bounced around from team to team including a return to Oakland in 1997. He would later win the 2000 World Series with the New York Yankees. Canseco retired in 2001 after a stint with the Chicago White Sox. Manager Tony La Russa remained with the A&#x27;s until 1995, when he resigned to take the managerial position in St. Louis, where he again got the chance to manage McGwire. La Russa would remain with the Cardinals through 2011 after having led the team to three World Series and two world championships. In 2021, he began a two-year stint as manager of the Chicago White Sox.

Giants manager Roger Craig (affectionately known as &quot;Humm Baby&quot;) was fired after the 1992 season and replaced by Dusty Baker, who managed the team to their next World Series. The final member of the 1989 team, Matt Williams, was traded to the Cleveland Indians after the 1996 season in a trade that brought future Giants star Jeff Kent to the team. Williams would eventually win a World Series as a member of the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001, and retired in 2003.

Kevin Mitchell would never regain the form that helped him win the National League MVP award in 1989, and after his production declined in the next two seasons he was traded to the Seattle Mariners in the 1991 offseason. Brett Butler would leave after one more season with the Giants, going to play for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Wins leader Rick Reuschel was gone after the following season, retiring in 1991. Finally, Will Clark was let go by the Giants after 1993 due to a decline in production thanks in large part to injuries that kept him out of the lineup for much of the previous three seasons. Clark signed with the Texas Rangers and despite not being able to escape the injury bug, he was a productive member of the team for the next five seasons. Clark retired following the 2000 season, where he made one last trip to the postseason as a member of La Russa&#x27;s Cardinals.

On June 13, 2009, immediately prior to the second game of the interleague regular season meeting between the Giants and A&#x27;s, the Giants honored 27 members of their 1989 team.

The A&#x27;s victory continued a string of success for any Bay Area-based professional sports team. The San Francisco 49ers of the NFL continued its &#x27;80s dynasty by winning Super Bowl XXIII and XXIV in between the Athletics&#x27; World Series triumph. The next championship for the city of Oakland came in 2015, when the Golden State Warriors of the NBA won the 2015 NBA Finals. Later, the Golden State Warriors would win the 2017 and 2018 NBA Finals, defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers.

This was the only official postseason match-up featuring two opposing Northern California teams in the four major American sports until the 2023 NBA First Round match-up between the Sacramento Kings and the Golden State Warriors.

This would be the first time that the World Series ended in the last week of October, until the 2001 World Series when the 9/11 attacks delayed the NFL and MLB games for a week, and caused the World Series to end in November. The 1981 World Series also finished on October 28. As of today, with multiple postseason rounds being added in the Wild Card era (1995-present), World Series regularly end during the first week of November.

<doc id="1217966" wikidata="Q8071507" url="?curid=1217966" title="Ziegfeld's">
<text>Ziegfeld&#x27;s/Secrets was a dual-themed nightclub in Washington, D.C., with Ziegfeld&#x27;s featuring drag queens, and Secrets featuring male strippers. The entertainment venue first opened in 1980, was forced to close in 2006, then reopened in a new location in 2009. The second location was closed permanently in 2020.

==History==
Originally located at 1345 Half Street SE, the circular venue was divided by a wall with a shared bar in the middle and connecting doors.

The Ziegfeld&#x27;s side of the venue featured a large stage adorned on either side by a giant silver high-heeled shoe. Each weekend the &quot;Ladies of Illusion&quot; show was hosted by the venue&#x27;s staple drag queen Ella Fitzgerald, with two performances on Fridays and Saturdays, and one on Sundays. The shows lasted approximately an hour and featured five drag queens doing various performances for packed crowds.

On the Secrets side of the venue, there were fully nude male dancers (catering to a mostly gay male crowd). It was one of the few venues in the United States where male strippers danced fully nude.

In 2006 the property was seized by the District of Columbia via eminent domain and torn down, along with many other gay-oriented businesses, to make way for the new Nationals Park baseball stadium.

The closing of the bar, compounded with the loss of several nearby LGBTQ businesses, was met with outrage and disappointment. Many were concerned whether the bar could find a new location. Under District law, businesses with a liquor license that permitted nude dancing could only relocate within their current zoning district or in a central business district. The new location would also have restrictions on proximity to residences, churches, and schools.

==Second location==
Ziegfeld&#x27;s/Secrets reopened at 1824 Half St., SW, Washington, D.C., a few blocks southwest of its former location. The transfer of its liquor license to the new location was approved, and the club set a &quot;grand opening&quot; date of February 13, 2009. The nondescript building was all black with a neon pink &quot;Z/S&quot; above the door. The new venue maintained the theme of twin bars, now divided by two levels: drag performances on the first floor, with all-nude male dancers upstairs. Leading lady Ella Fitzgerald continued to perform at Ziegfeld&#x27;s.

==Closure in 2020==
While shuttered during the coronavirus pandemic, Ziegfeld&#x27;s announced the venue had been sold, and the business would not reopen.

<text>The Caspian snowcock (Tetraogallus caspius) is a snowcock in the pheasant family Phasianidae of the order Galliformes, gallinaceous birds.
Dari partridge or valley partridge [2] (scientific name: Tetraogallus caspius) is the name of a species of the subfamily of partridges and pheasant family. Its origin is the north of Afghanistan, areas of the Hindu Kush mountains and a large area of Takhars slopes

Dari partridge or valley partridge [2] (scientific name: Tetraogallus caspius) is the name of a species of the subfamily of partridges and the pheasant family. Its origin is the north of Afghanistan, areas of the Hindu Kush mountains and a large area of the slopes of Takharistan. This bird has a large size and is pea-grey in color. Its flight feathers are white and it often lives in very high mountain areas whose height is around 1800 to 3000 meters. The body size of the male bird is 58 cm and the female bird is 55 cm. The color of the belly is dark and pale red at the end. On the sides, there are long, wide stripes in cinnamon color, which are gray next to them. Two-thirds of the length of the primary and secondary feathers of the wing from the base side are white, which can be seen as a wide and distinct strip under the wing when flying. The special design of his face, which includes white eye band and throat, dark gray, and a rich gray line on the side of the neck, can be recognized from a close distance. The difference between the female bird and the male bird is that in the female bird, the contrast of the face pattern is less, in addition, the female bird is smaller, pale, and the crown and throat are smaller. The male bird has spikes on its feet. The type that can be seen in the southwest of Iran is light gray or pea in color. This bird is very shy and cautious and very difficult to approach. He runs away from the audience and flies quickly over the mountain with a sense of danger. It is not as social as other birds, and is usually seen in pairs. There are two types of doorknob, Takhari and Hindukshi. This bird lives in steep cliffs, rocky mountains and high peaks with little and scattered plants and builds nests among rocks and often on the edge of high cliffs. It is native and relatively abundant in Iran. In recent years, its population has decreased drastically and its hunting is prohibited.

It has the origin from the north of Afghanistan.
It is also known as (kabké Dari) in Dari language spoken in Afghanistan.

== Description ==
This snowcock ranges from in length, in wingspan and in weight. Its plumage is patterned with grey, brown, white and black, but this snowcock looks pale gray from any distance. The breast is pale gray, the throat and a white patch on the side of the neck are white, and the nape is dark gray.

In flight, this wary bird shows white flight feathers and undertail. Male and female plumages are similar, but juveniles are slightly smaller and duller in appearance. There are three races differing in plumage saturation, becoming paler from west to east.

The Caspian snowcock has a desolate whistling song, vaguely like a Eurasian curlew, &#x27;. It differs from Caucasian snowcock in that it does not have the drop in pitch at the end of the song shown by that species. The calls include loud cackles and bubbled &#x27;.

<doc id="1217986" wikidata="Q7712631" url="?curid=1217986" title="The Adventures of Sam Spade">
<text>The Adventures of Sam Spade, Detective was a radio series based loosely on the private detective character Sam Spade, created by writer Dashiell Hammett for &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;. The show ran for 13 episodes on ABC in 1946, for 157 episodes on CBS in 1946–1949, and finally for 75 episodes on NBC in 1949–1951. The series starred Howard Duff (and later, Steve Dunne) as Sam Spade and Lurene Tuttle as his secretary Effie, and took a considerably more tongue-in-cheek approach to the character than the novel or movie. The announcer was Dick Joy.

The series was largely overseen by producer/director William Spier. In 1947, Spier and scriptwriters Jason James and Bob Tallman received an Edgar Award for Best Radio Drama from the Mystery Writers of America.

Before the series, Sam Spade had been played in radio adaptations of &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; by both Edward G. Robinson (in a 1943 &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; production) and by Humphrey Bogart (in a 1941 &quot;Academy Award Theater&quot; production), both on CBS.

Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s name was removed from the series in the late 1940s because he was being investigated for involvement with the Communist Party. Later, when Howard Duff&#x27;s name appeared in the &quot;Red Channels&quot; book, he was not invited to play the role when the series made the switch to NBC in 1950.

* &quot;The Adventures of Sam Spade&quot; (1946, ABC) – 13 30-minute episodes

<doc id="1217989" wikidata="Q1680288" url="?curid=1217989" title="James Douglas, 2nd Marquess of Douglas">
<text>James Douglas, 2nd Marquess of Douglas (c.1646 – 25 February 1700) was the son of Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus and 1st Earl of Ormond, and Lady Anne Stuart.

James, second Marquis of Douglas, born in 1646, succeeded his grandfather in 1660, and was a privy councillor to Kings Charles II and James VII. He died 25 February 1700, in the 54th year of his age. His eldest son, James, Earl of Angus, born in 1671, in 1689 raised for the service of the nation, in one day, a regiment of eighteen hundred men, now called the 26th foot or Cameronians, of which he was appointed colonel, 19 April of that year. After much active service he fell at the Battle of Steinkirk 3d August 1692, in the 21st year of his age, unmarried. His half brother, William, also bore the title of earl of Angus, but died an infant in 1694. Archibald, the third son of the second marquis, succeeded as third marquis.

His first marriage was in 1670 to the Lady Barbara Erskine, daughter of John Erskine, 21st Earl of Mar and Jean Mackenzie. He later married Mary Kerr, daughter of Robert Kerr, 1st Marquess of Lothian and Lady Jean Campbell.

The story of the end of the marriage between James Douglas and Barbara Erskine is immortalized in the popular ballad &quot;Waly Waly&quot;, which is known by many alternative titles (e.g. &quot;Jamie Douglas&quot;, &quot;When Cockleshells Turn Silver Bells&quot;, &quot;Water Is Wide&quot;) with many alternative lyrics and melodies. If the lyrics are to be believed, in 1681 a rumour apparently was put to Douglas by Lowrie of Blackwood that Erskine had been sleeping with another man, and Douglas promptly dropped her. Her father took her home and she never remarried.

<text>Carlos José Bustamante (born 1951 in Lima, Peru) is a Peruvian-American scientist. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences.

==Biography==
Carlos Bustamante is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator, professor of molecular and cell biology, physics, and chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, and Biophysicist Faculty Scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.&lt;br&gt;
Bustamante studied medicine at National University of San Marcos before discovering his true interest in biochemistry. He received his BSc from Cayetano Heredia University in Lima, his MSc in biochemistry from National University of San Marcos in Lima, and his PhD in biophysics from UC Berkeley, where he studied with Ignacio Tinoco, Jr. As a postdoctoral fellow at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Bustamante studied with Marcos Maestre. Before moving to Berkeley, he was an HHMI investigator at the University of Oregon.

==Research focus==
Carlos Bustamante uses novel methods of single-molecule visualization, such as scanning force microscopy, to study the structure and function of nucleoprotein assemblies. His laboratory is developing methods of single-molecule manipulation, such as optical tweezers, to characterize the elasticity of DNA, to induce the mechanical unfolding of individual protein molecules, and to investigate the machine-like behavior of molecular motors.

<text>Hans-Joachim Stuck (; born 1 January 1951), nicknamed &quot;Strietzel&quot;, is a German racing driver who has competed in Formula One and many other categories. He is the son of pre-World War II racing driver Hans Stuck.

==Life and career==
He was born in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Bavaria, and is the son of Christa Thielmann and the legendary 1930s Auto Union Grand Prix driver Hans Stuck. His father taught him to drive on the Nürburgring as a young boy. In 1969 he started his first ever motor race at the Nordschleife. Speaking about that day he said, &quot;Getting to the grid was extremely exciting. All of a sudden, my wishes to become a racer came true. I just wanted to start the race and give everybody hell!&quot; The following year, at just 19 years of age, he won his first 24 hours race at the wheel of a BMW 2002ti. He won there again in 1998 and 2004, too, each time with a BMW touring car.

In 1972, Stuck teamed up with Jochen Mass to drive a Ford Capri RS2600 to victory at the Spa 24 Hours endurance race in Belgium. His campaigns racing the BMW 3.0 CSL &quot;Batmobile&quot; were very successful in 1974 and 1975, in the German DRM as well as in the USA together with Ronnie Peterson. Later in the 1970s he raced the turbo-charged BMW 320i.After some success in Formula 2 with a March-BMW, he also entered F1 with March. Overall, Stuck participated in 81 Grands Prix, debuting on 13 January 1974. He achieved two podiums and scored 29 championship points. Incidentally, Stuck was the first driver be born after the inaugural Grand Prix in 1950. Stuck was quite successful at Brabham-Alfa in 1977, leading the 1977 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen in the rain, but was replaced by Niki Lauda in 1978. Stuck missed an opportunity to join Williams F1 just before this team became successful.
Due to his height of , he did not fit well into the F1 cars of the late 1970s that had the cockpit moved forward. Leaving F1 at that time probably spared him bad injuries to the leg, as suffered by Ronnie Peterson, Clay Regazzoni, Marc Surer and others.

Stuck continued racing touring and sports cars all over the world, winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans twice with a Porsche 962. Stuck says the 962 is the favourite racecar he has driven during his career, describing it as having the &quot;perfect combination of power and downforce&quot; and saying that he had &quot;never sat in such a high-tech racing car as the Porsche 962C with the PDK semi-automatic transmission&quot;.

In the 1990s he tasted touring car success, winning the DTM Championship in 1990 with Audi, before returning to Porsche until the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1998. He resumed an official role with BMW after that. In 2006, Stuck raced in the inaugural season of the Grand Prix Masters formula for retired Formula One drivers after scoring 6th in the first race event at the Kyalami circuit in South Africa on 11–13 November 2005.

January 2008 saw Stuck began his current position with Volkswagen Motorsport. This role has also seen him use his experience to help refine road cars, including the new Golf VI GTI.

Stuck announced the end of his active career as a race driver 43 years after the 2011 Nürburgring 24 Hours, in which he participated with a Reiter Engineering Lamborghini Gallardo LP600+ GT3 together with Dennis Rostek and his sons Ferdinand Stuck and Johannes Stuck. Team Stuck3 finished 15th overall following gearbox problems.

In April 2012, Stuck was elected President of the German Motorsport Association (&quot;Deutscher Motor Sport Bund&quot;).

<text>Sarah Rudinoff (born August 26, 1971) is an American actress, singer, and writer. She was the recipient of a 2004 Genius Award from the Seattle, Washington alternative weekly newspaper &quot;The Stranger&quot;.

==Life and career==
Born in Alexandria, Virginia, and raised on the island of Kauai, Rudinoff, a self-described &quot;half-Episcopalian, half-Jew&quot; has lived and worked in a number of North American cities. She has appeared in &quot;Negative Space&quot; and Richard Foreman&#x27;s Ontological Hysteric in New York City and in several new plays at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles; she is based in Seattle. Described by David-Edward Hughes of &quot;Talkin&#x27; Broadway&quot;, as &quot;a big-boned, whiskey voiced stunner&quot;, 
she has appeared in many of Seattle&#x27;s professional theatres including starring as Ruth in &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; and Hildy in &quot;On the Town&quot; at the 5th Avenue Theatre. Rudinoff is probably best known to rock audiences for her turn as Yitzhak in the original Seattle production &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; and her solo shows &quot;Broad Perspective&quot; (1998), &quot;Go There&quot; (2003) or &quot;The Last State&quot; (2004), a piece about growing up &quot;haole&quot; in Hawaii.

In presenting her the Genius Award, Sean Nelson of &quot;The Stranger&quot; wrote that she &quot;is one of maybe 10 performers in town who have achieved the distinction of local stardom in non-rock-band live performance. She sings like a demon, equally comfortable belting rock, jazz, or blues... Rudinoff is not the kind of actress who &#x27;disappears&#x27; into the roles she plays. She&#x27;s the kind of actress who explodes out of her roles with heroic, instinctive, and fearless performances.&quot; The rival &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot; named her &quot;Best Woman in Man&#x27;s Clothing&quot; for her title role in &quot;Ubu&quot;, Ki Gottberg’s reworking of Alfred Jarry&#x27;s &quot;Ubu&quot; plays.

As a musician and singer Rudinoff makes music with We Are Golden and in 2010 she was included in photography book chronicling 100 Seattlites that make a difference to culture in the city – A Seattle 100.

Rudinoff is a star of Wes Hurley&#x27;s musical comedy &quot;Waxie Moon in Fallen Jewel&quot; in which she plays two roles and performs the musical number &quot;Everything is On Fire&quot;. Rudinoff also sang the title song composed by Eric Lane Barnes for the documentary &quot;Waxie Moon&quot; also directed by Hurley.

In 2013 Sarah Rudinoff and Gretta Harley premiered their original play, &quot;These Streets&quot; based on real-life stories of female rockers during the Grunge era of Seattle&#x27;s music scene. As part of their research for the play Rudinoff, Harley and filmmaker Wes Hurley conducted dozens of video interviews of female musicians of the era, including Vanessa Veselka and Carla Torgerson of The Walkabouts.

Rudinoff is a graduate of Iolani School and Pitzer College. She works as a real estate agent.

<text>Bernard Matthew Cassidy VC (17 August 1892 – 28 March 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Cassidy was 25 years old, and a second lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, The Lancashire Fusiliers, British Army during the First World War at the German spring offensive when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 28 March 1918 at Arras, France, at a time when the flank of the division was in danger, Second Lieutenant Cassidy was in command of the left company of his battalion. He had been given orders to hold on to the position at all costs and he carried out this instruction to the letter. Although the enemy came in overwhelming numbers he continued to rally and encourage his men, under terrific bombardment until the company was eventually surrounded and he was killed. 

Cassidy has no known grave, but is remembered on the Arras Memorial. He has a street named after him in Canning Town in London called Bernard Cassidy Street. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>Moist is a Canadian rock band that formed in 1992. It consists of David Usher as lead vocalist, Mark Makoway on lead guitars, Jonathan Gallivan on guitars, Kevin Young on keyboards, Francis Fillion on drums, and Jeff Pearce on bass. Drummer Paul Wilcox left the band just before its hiatus in 2000.

Moist was signed by EMI Music in 1994 and released three studio albums in the 1990s, becoming a staple of Canadian rock music. Shortly after releasing a compilation album in 2001, the band underwent an unplanned hiatus for over a decade, and then became officially re-established in June 2013. Shortly after reuniting, the band began work on their fourth studio album, entitled &quot;Glory Under Dangerous Skies&quot;, which was released in 2014. Their fifth album, &quot;End of the Ocean&quot;, was released in January 2022.

The band has been nominated for ten Juno Awards, winning two. Between 1996 and 2016, Moist was among the top 50 best-selling Canadian artists in Canada and among the top 20 best-selling Canadian bands in Canada.

==History==
===Founding and mainstream success (1992–2001)===
Mark Makoway, Jeff Pearce, David Usher and Kevin Young, all from Ontario, all individually moved to Vancouver over eight years. The group came together in 1992 where they formed the first version of Moist, which included drummer Jamie Kaufmann. The band began writing songs in November 1992 and played their first gig two months later. Drummer Paul Wilcox replaced Kaufmann in early 1993. In 1993, the band recorded a 9-song demo tape at the 8th Avenue Sound Studio with engineer Kevin Hamilton. Their sound was influenced by contemporary Seattle acts such as Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Alice in Chains . The two-day recording session cost $500 Canadian dollars. The band had 500 copies of the untitled cassette pressed. The band found support from the staff at the flagship Sam the Record Man store in Vancouver. The cassette reached No. 1 on Sam the Record Man&#x27;s local independent chart. The release was distributed to other stores in the national chain and entered the top 10 on Sam the Record Man&#x27;s national independent chart. In 1993, Moist signed to EMI Music Publishing Canada. Moist spent much of 1993 touring Canada and writing material for an expanded release. In January 1994, they completed their first full-length album, which cost $3,000 Canadian dollars. The album was titled &quot;Silver&quot; and released independently on February 8, 1994. After MuchMusic began playing the music video for Moist&#x27;s lead single &quot;Push&quot; in medium rotation, the album sold almost 6,000 records within six weeks. By March 1994, the band signed with EMI Music Canada. The &quot;Silver&quot; album went on to sell 400,000 copies in Canada on the strength of the singles &quot;Push&quot;, &quot;Silver&quot;, &quot;Believe Me&quot; and &quot;Machine Punch Through&quot;. The band was also successful internationally in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Thailand. That year the band continued to tour around Canada. In 1995, the band won the Juno Award for &quot;Best New Group&quot;.

In late 1996, Moist released their second album, &quot;Creature&quot;, to favourable reviews and sales in excess of 300,000 units. The album included the hits &quot;Leave It Alone&quot;, &quot;Resurrection&quot;, &quot;Tangerine&quot;, and &quot;Gasoline&quot;, all of which were placed on high rotation on MuchMusic. In addition to these, a remixed version of &quot;Tangerine&quot; became a hit on radio and MuchMusic.

Following the band&#x27;s second record, David Usher released his first solo album, &quot;Little Songs&quot;.

In early 1999, the band regrouped to record their third full-length album, the melancholic and soft-toned &quot;Mercedes 5 and Dime&quot;. The album was released in the summer of 1999 in Canada and later in 2000 in the United States. Singles included &quot;Breathe&quot;, &quot;Underground&quot;, and &quot;Comes and Goes&quot;. While touring in support of the album, drummer Paul Wilcox injured his back, causing him to miss the band&#x27;s final performances. In December 2000, it was revealed that Wilcox had decided to take a &quot;potential permanent leave from the band.&quot; Wilcox never returned to the band and retired from music. The band released a compilation album and DVD in 2001, titled &quot;Machine Punch Through&quot;. Moist did not perform at all in 2001. Though David Usher stated that Moist was still together as late as 2002, the band&#x27;s hiatus would last 12 years.

===Hiatus (2001–2013)===
During the band&#x27;s hiatus, David Usher continued to record solo, releasing &quot;Morning Orbit&quot; in 2001, &quot;Hallucinations&quot; in 2003, &quot;If God Had Curves&quot; in 2005, &quot;Strange Birds&quot; in 2007, &quot;Wake Up and Say Goodbye&quot; in 2008, &quot;The Mile End Sessions&quot; in 2010, and &quot;Songs from the Last Day on Earth&quot; in 2012. Mark Makoway published a guide to the music industry, called The Indie Band Bible, and continued to produce and mix records. Jeff Pearce formed the band RYE, and released the album &quot;Wolves&quot; through Maple Nationwide in 2004. Kevin Young toured with David and worked as a freelance writer.

===Reunion, new albums (2013–present)===
In June 2013, the band got back together, with Francis Fillion on drums. The first new Moist recording in 13 years, a cover of Greg Lake&#x27;s &quot;I Believe in Father Christmas&quot;, was released through CBC Music in December 2013. Moist toured around Canada in November and December that year, calling their tour &quot;Moist - The Resurrection&quot;, a reference to their 1996 single &quot;Resurrection&quot;. The tour began in London, Ontario and ended in Calgary, Alberta.

In January 2014, the band, now including Jonathan Gallivan, who had accompanied Moist as a second guitarist on the 2013 tour, reconvened in Montréal to continue work on material for a new album. Although he would still be featured on some of the new record, bassist Jeff Pearce left to focus on being a father. Recording of the new songs began in January 2014. The band signed a new deal with Universal Music Canada, and released a single, &quot;Mechanical&quot;, to radio on May 23, 2014, and to iTunes on May 27. The band&#x27;s fourth full-length album, &quot;Glory Under Dangerous Skies&quot;, was released on October 7, 2014.

On May 9, 2019, it was announced that Jeff Pearce had reunited with the band. 2019 also marked the 25th anniversary of Moist&#x27;s debut hit album &quot;Silver&quot;. Moist took to the road for the &quot;Silver&quot; 25th Anniversary Tour through Canada. The group performed &quot;Silver&quot; in its entirety, as well as favourites from their career. In November 2019, Moist released a 2CD/digital remastered edition of &quot;Silver&quot; and a 180g 3LP deluxe edition out in December. Both versions include demos, acoustic versions, and previously unreleased live tracks recorded in Los Angeles in 1994.

Also in November 2019, Moist released remasters of their albums, &quot;Silver&quot;, &quot;Creature&quot;, and &quot;Mercedes Five and Dime&quot;, for the first time on 180g vinyl.

In January 2021, Moist released a single &quot;Tarantino&quot;, their first new song since 2014. In April 2021, Moist announced that they would be releasing a new studio album, &quot;End of the Ocean&quot;, on October 1, 2021. The title track single of the same name was simultaneously released. The album was released on January 14, 2022.

<text>Major Herbert Augustine Carter VC (26 May 1874 – 13 January 1916) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the son of the vicar of St Erth in Cornwall and served in two campaigns in East Africa.

== Details ==
Carter was 29 years old, and a lieutenant in the Poona Mounted Infantry, Indian Army, during the Third Somaliland Expedition when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 19 December 1903 during a reconnaissance at Jidballi, British Somaliland, when two sections were retiring before a force of Dervishes who outnumbered them by thirty to one, Lieutenant Carter rode back alone, a distance of 400 yards, to the assistance of an Indian private who had lost his horse and was closely pursued by a number of the enemy. The man was so badly wounded that it took three attempts to get him on to the horse.

In a later incident he saved another soldier by shooting a lion with his last cartridge. In the Great War having been promoted major he arrived at Mombasa already ill with fever and then marched inland through barren country in intense heat but died from heat exhaustion in Mwelo Mdogo, British East Africa before his unit (the 40th Pathans) was able to engage the enemy forces.

==Memorial==

He is buried at St Erth in a plot planted with tropical plants including laurels and castor oil plants. Another memorial to his memory can be found in York Minster Made of black marble with bronze figures and designed by Sir Bertram Mackennal of Melbourne, Australia.

== The medal ==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry Museum, Bodmin, Cornwall, England.

<doc id="1218008" wikidata="Q1984672" url="?curid=1218008" title="1982 World Series">
<text>The 1982 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1982 season. The 79th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the National League (NL) champion St. Louis Cardinals and the American League (AL) champion Milwaukee Brewers. The Cardinals won the series, four games to three.

The Cardinals had last been in the World Series in 1968, while a Milwaukee team, the Braves, had last contended in 1958. The Milwaukee of 1982 started as an expansion team, the Seattle Pilots, in 1969, which then moved to Milwaukee in 1970 and changed their name to the Brewers.

The Cardinals made it to the Series by winning the NL East division by three games over the Philadelphia Phillies, and then defeating the Atlanta Braves, three games to none, in the NL Championship Series. The Brewers made it by winning the AL East division by one game over the Baltimore Orioles, and then defeating the California Angels, three games to two, in the AL Championship Series. 1982 World Series is the Brewers&#x27; only World Series appearance to date, and remains their only American League pennant winning season: ironically, the Brewers would join the Cardinals as a member of the National League Central Division in 1998. 

The Cardinals&#x27; victory helped the National League win four straight World Series from to 1982, the longest streak of consecutive titles by the National League in World Series history. The National League would not again win consecutive titles until the 2010 Giants, the 2011 Cardinals and the 2012 Giants.

Though the teams had never met before, their home cities had a commercial rivalry in the beer market, as St. Louis is the home of Anheuser–Busch, which owned the Cardinals at the time, while Milwaukee is the home of Miller Brewing and other past major competitors of Anheuser–Busch. This led the media to refer to the series as the &quot;Suds Series&quot;.

To date, this is the Brewers’ sole appearance in the World Series, and they have the second longest pennant drought in the National League behind the Pittsburgh Pirates (1979).

==Preview==

The 1982 Milwaukee Brewers hit 216 home runs during the regular season, thus earning them the nickname &quot;Harvey&#x27;s Wallbangers&quot; (after manager and Milwaukee native, Harvey Kuenn). In sharp contrast, the 1982 St. Louis Cardinals only hit 67 home runs, fewer than the Brewers&#x27; Gorman Thomas (with 39 homers) and Ben Oglivie (34 homers) combined. The Cardinals had built their reputation and won their division behind solid pitching, exceptional defense, and aggressive base running, manufacturing runs in a style that would come to be called &quot;Whiteyball,&quot; named for team manager Whitey Herzog. This style would be the hallmark of the Cardinals through the 1980s and see them into two more World Series (in 1985 and 1987, both of which they lost in seven games).

The Brewers and Cardinals each boasted a dominant closer, with veteran Rollie Fingers holding the role for Milwaukee and Bruce Sutter for St. Louis. Fingers did not pitch in this series, which would have been his fourth, due to a muscle tear in his arm.

The two teams had made a trade in December 1980 that was expected to benefit both clubs. Milwaukee traded pitchers Dave LaPoint and Lary Sorensen and outfielders Sixto Lezcano and David Green to the Cardinals, with pitcher Pete Vuckovich and catcher Ted Simmons comprising two-thirds of St. Louis&#x27; return.

The Cardinals built their team on speed, clutch hitting and pitching. The Cardinals made additional trades for Willie McGee, Ozzie Smith, George Hendrick, Joaquín Andújar, and Sutter, all designed to craft a well balanced championship level team.

The Brewers combined a productive farm system with additional trades as well to build their heavy hitting ball club. Thomas, Moose Haas, Robin Yount, and Paul Molitor came through the system, while the aforementioned Vukovich, Simmons, Fingers, and Oglivie, plus Cecil Cooper and Don Money, all arrived via the trade route. On June 1, with the team 23–24 and floundering in fifth place, Brewer GM Harry Dalton replaced manager Buck Rodgers with Harvey Kuenn. The Brewers responded by winning at a .626 clip the rest of the way, taking first place for good on July 31 and never looking back.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===
This was the Brewers&#x27; first ever game in the World Series.

The Brewers&#x27; left-hander Mike Caldwell pitched a complete-game shutout, allowing only three hits. The Brewers&#x27; offense was led by Paul Molitor, who had a World Series-record five hits and two RBIs. Robin Yount added four hits and two RBIs.

The Brewers went up 2–0 in the first when Cardinals&#x27; first baseman Keith Hernandez&#x27;s error on Ben Oglivie ground ball with two on scored a run, then Gorman Thomas&#x27;s RBI single scored another. Charlie Moore doubled to lead off the fourth and scored on Molitor&#x27;s single while Ted Simmons homered next inning. Cardinals starter Bob Forsch allowed consecutive two-out singles to Jim Gantner and Molitor in the sixth before both scored on Yount&#x27;s double and knocked Forsch out of the game. In the ninth, Oglivie walked with one out off of Dave LaPoint, moved to second on a groundout, and scored on Don Money&#x27;s single. Jeff Lahti relieved LaPoint and allowed a single to Moore. Gantner&#x27;s triple then scored two before Gantner himself scored on Molitor&#x27;s single to cap the scoring at 10–0.

This was their last post-season win on the road until October 13, 2011, also against the St. Louis Cardinals.

===Game 2===
The Brew Crew drew first blood in the second with an RBI double by Charlie Moore. They followed that in the third when Paul Molitor singled, stole second, went to third on a wild pitch by Cardinals starter John Stuper, and scored on a Robin Yount groundout. Ted Simmons stretched the lead to 3–0 with his second homer in two games.
The Cardinals scratched back in their half of the third when rookie Willie McGee singled, stole second, and scored on a Tom Herr double. Ken Oberkfell singled in Herr to cut the Brewer lead to 3–2. The Brewers made it 4–2 in the fifth when Yount doubled and Cecil Cooper singled him in.

Darrell Porter tied it in the sixth by doubling in two runs. Then, in the bottom of the eighth, the Brewers felt the effects of not having Rollie Fingers in the bullpen. With one out, Pete Ladd, pressed into service as the closer, walked Lonnie Smith with two on to load the bases and then walked pinch-hitter Steve Braun to force in the go-ahead run. The Cardinals could have made it worse, but McGee lined out to short for out #2, and an apparent base hit by Ozzie Smith struck Braun as he was running to second for the third out.

Bruce Sutter pitched the ninth and got credit for the win.

Longtime American League umpire Bill Haller called his final game behind home plate in this contest. He also was the last umpire to wear a tie on the field, and the last to work home plate in the World Series wearing the &quot;balloon&quot; style outside chest protector.

===Game 3===

Joaquín Andújar and Pete Vuckovich, each team&#x27;s pitching aces, were locked in a scoreless pitching duel until the top half of the fifth, when Willie McGee belted a three-run homer for the Cards.

The Redbirds added two more in the seventh off Vuckovich. Lonnie Smith doubled to right-center and tried to stretch it to a triple. Smith scored when Jim Gantner&#x27;s relay throw to third went wild. McGee followed with a home run later in the inning, his second.

McGee also had a couple of defensive gems, running down a deep Paul Molitor drive in the first and robbing Gorman Thomas of a home run in the ninth.

In the seventh with one out, Andújar had to leave the game when a line drive from Ted Simmons struck his kneecap. The Brewers loaded the bases in that inning, but ace reliever Bruce Sutter got the final out to squelch the threat.

Cecil Cooper accounted for the Brewers&#x27; only runs with a two-run homer in the eighth off Sutter. Ozzie Smith drove in the Cardinals final run with a bases-loaded walk after George Hendrick reached first on catcher&#x27;s interference by Ted Simmons and went to third on a ground-rule double by Lonnie Smith with two outs. Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog argued that Hendrick reached second as he was running with the pitch with two outs and should have been allowed to score on the double, but to no avail. McGee was walked intentionally, loading the bases, followed by Ozzie Smith&#x27;s walk. 

Sutter qualified for the save in this game (even though the Cards had a 5–0 lead when he entered the game), since he entered with the bases loaded, meaning the potential tying run was on deck.

===Game 4===
Game 4 of the 1982 World Series pitted Dave LaPoint (9–3) against Moose Haas (11–8). Haas was a veteran of six major league campaigns while LaPoint had just completed his first full season.

For six innings, the Cardinals seemed on the verge of taking a commanding 3–1 Series lead. Dave LaPoint held the Brewers to three hits in that time span, while his hitters plated him a 5–1 lead.

In the top of the first inning, Ken Oberkfell doubled down the right-field line and George Hendrick hit a high chopper over the middle which handcuffed Yount and bounced into center-field, allowing Oberkfell to score. In the bottom of the first, Oberkfell dropped a bare-handed grounder from Yount. Both teams had trouble at times fielding, and the Brewers errors in Game 3 may have cost them three runs.

Two Cardinal runs came in the second on an unusual way. With Willie McGee on first and attempting to steal, Brewers catcher Ted Simmons took a pitch-out but bobbled the ball allowing McGee to steal second. After a walk to Ozzie Smith, Moose Haas&#x27; wild pitch moved McGee to third and Smith to second. Tommy Herr hit a deep fly. McGee scored easily and Smith took advantage of center fielder Gorman Thomas slipping and falling on the warning track and never stopped, scoring behind McGee for a two-run sacrifice fly for Herr. Ken Oberkfell followed with a walk, stole second and came home when a Keith Hernandez grounder went through Gantner&#x27;s legs. The Cardinals scored three times despite only one base hit.

In the Brewers half of the fifth, with none out and runners at first and third, Ozzie Smith made one of his famous &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; plays. Gantner hit a ground ball through the middle towards center field. Smith, though off-balance, stabbed at the ball while simultaneously stepping on second base, recovered and fired to first to double up Gantner.

In the seventh, things fell apart. With one out, Oglivie reached first when first baseman Keith Hernandez&#x27;s toss to LaPoint was dropped. LaPoint was relieved by Doug Bair after giving up a two-out RBI (unearned) double to Gantner. Before relieved by Jim Kaat, Bair walked Molitor and gave up a bases-loaded, two-run (both unearned) checked-swing single to Yount. An RBI infield hit by Cecil Cooper and a wild pitch brought in the fourth Cardinals pitcher, Jeff Lahti. Lahti intentionally walked (charged to Kaat) Simmons and gave up another bases-loaded, two-run single to Thomas. Lahti issued another intentional walk to Oglivie then induced a fly out to left field to end this inning. In this inning, six runs (three earned) crossed the plate for the Brewers on five hits and one error.

Jim Slaton started the eighth by walking Darrell Porter and giving up a one-out single to Dane Iorg. Bob McClure relieved Slaton and ended the threat by getting McGee to bounce into a double play. McClure went the rest of the way for the save.

===Game 5===
Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog made some lineup changes for this game, dropping Tom Herr from leadoff to eighth and Ken Oberkfell from second to seventh. He led off with hot-hitting Lonnie Smith at DH, started David Green in centerfield and batted him second in place of Dane Iorg, and moved Willie McGee from eighth to sixth.

Mike Caldwell pitched his second win of the Series and almost went the distance. The Brewers struck first on Ted Simmons&#x27;s bases loaded groundout in the first off of Bob Forsch, but the Cardinals tied the game in the third on Keith Hernandez&#x27;s RBI double. The Brewers took a 2–1 lead in the bottom half on Cecil Cooper&#x27;s groundout with runners on first and third and added to their lead on Paul Molitor&#x27;s RBI single in the fifth. George Hendrick&#x27;s RBI single in the seventh cut the Brewers lead to 3–2, but they got that run back in the bottom of the inning on Robin Yount&#x27;s home run, then added to their lead in the eighth on back-to-back RBI singles by Charlie Moore and Jim Gantner off of Bruce Sutter. The Cardinals staged a late rally in the ninth as Keith Hernandez doubled in a run and George Hendrick singled him in with two outs. Bob McClure came in and allowed a single to Darrell Porter, putting the tying run on base. McClure, however, struck out Willie McGee, then retired pinch-hitter Gene Tenace to end the game. Robin Yount set a World Series record by recording his second four-hit game, his first came in Game 1. To this day, Yount remains the only player to have multiple 4-hit games in one World Series.

This was the tenth and final World Series game at Milwaukee County Stadium (1957, 1958 and 1982) as well as the final playoff game at Milwaukee County Stadium.

===Game 6===
Busch Stadium&#x27;s lack of a dome caused two delays that totaled over hours. The Cardinals staved off elimination with a blowout win. In the second, Dane Iorg doubled with two outs off of Don Sutton and scored on an error on Willie McGee&#x27;s ground ball. Tom Herr&#x27;s double then made it 2–0 Cardinals.

The Cardinals appeared to get a third run in the bottom of the third when Lonnie Smith walked, stole second, and went to third on a Keith Hernandez groundout. With George Hendrick batting, Smith attempted to steal home and appeared to have clearly slid headfirst under Ted Simmons&#x27; tag, but he was ruled out by home plate umpire Jim Evans.

In the fourth, Darrell Porter hit a two-run home run, then Iorg tripled and scored on Herr&#x27;s groundout. Keith Hernandez&#x27;s two-run home run in the fifth made it 7–0 and knocked Sutton out of the game. After Sutton was removed, rains came and delayed the game for 26 minutes before Jim Slaton came in and retired the next two hitters.

In the sixth, Iorg hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a wild pitch by Doc Medich, and scored on McGee&#x27;s single. Herr reached on a bloop single and Medich threw another wild pitch, sending McGee to third and Herr to second. After Ozzie Smith was retired, David Green, who replaced Lonnie Smith due to an injured wrist, walked to load the bases. Another rain delay, this time for two hours, occurred in the middle of Green&#x27;s at-bat. After Ken Oberkfell grounded into a force-out at home, Hernandez&#x27;s single then scored two, Hendrick&#x27;s single scored another, and an error on Porter&#x27;s ground ball scored two more. 

The Brewers avoided a shutout in the ninth when Jim Gantner, who doubled to lead off the inning, scored on a passed ball by Cardinals backup catcher Glenn Brummer. John Stuper went the distance for the Cardinals (helped by the rain delays), scattering four hits.

===Game 7===

Joaquín Andújar and Pete Vuckovich opposed each other once again, and both had injuries. Andujar had decreased mobility after the line drive he had taken off the kneecap in Game 3, while Vuckovich was suffering from severe shoulder pain which would be diagnosed the following spring as a torn rotator cuff. The game was scoreless until the bottom of the fourth when the Cardinals scored first on a Lonnie Smith RBI single. Ben Oglivie tied it for the Brewers in the fifth with a solo home run, and they took a 3–1 lead in the sixth when Jim Gantner scored on an error and Cecil Cooper hit a sacrifice fly.

However, starting in the bottom of the sixth, with one out, the Cardinals mounted a comeback and held the Brewers scoreless for the rest of the game. Ozzie Smith singled and Lonnie Smith doubled him to third. Brewers manager Harvey Kuenn then pulled Vuckovich in favor of Bob McClure, who walked pinch-hitter Gene Tenace to load the bases. Keith Hernandez then tied the game with a two-run single (off McClure, who was a high-school teammate of Hernandez&#x27;) George Hendrick then gave the Cardinals the lead with an RBI single.

Series MVP Darrell Porter and Steve Braun delivered the key blows in the eighth with RBI singles, giving the Cardinals a 6–3 lead. Andújar pitched seven strong innings. After recording the final out of the seventh on Gantner, the two men appeared as if they were going to physically fight after Andujar made a gesture of exuberance, and home plate umpire Lee Weyer had to step between them and move Andujar towards the dugout to prevent a fist fight. Manager Herzog, concerned that his unpredictable starter would allow himself to lose concentration after the incident, then turned to closer Bruce Sutter for a two-inning save, his second save of the series. This was the first time since that a National League team had won a seventh game of the World Series at home, when the Cardinals themselves defeated the New York Yankees in seven games. It was also the only World Series championship that the Cardinals ever clinched at home during their 40-year tenure at the 2nd Busch Stadium (1966–2005).

As of 2024, this remains the Brewers&#x27; only World Series appearance.

==Composite box==
1982 World Series (4–3): St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.) over Milwaukee Brewers (A.L.)
==Aftermath==
Paul Molitor set a World Series record with his fifth hit, in the ninth inning of Game 1. Robin Yount would set another record in the seventh inning of Game 5 by becoming the first player in Series history to have two four-hit games in a single Series.

Cardinals catcher Darrell Porter was given the Series MVP award. Brewers pitcher Mike Caldwell, who won two games, would have been a strong candidate, as well as Molitor. Paul Molitor would eventually win the Series MVP Award 11 years later as a member of the Toronto Blue Jays. As it was, the winning team won the MVP. The only player on the losing team to win the MVP was Bobby Richardson of the New York Yankees.

Both participants are currently in the NL Central, due to the transfer of the Brewers from the American League to the National League in 1998. This raises the possibility of the Brewers eventually representing two different leagues in World Series competition. That has happened three times before, taking the 19th Century contests into account: The Brooklyn Dodgers of 1889 and 1890; the Cardinals, who won the 1886 Series when they were in the American Association; and the Houston Astros, who played in the 2005 World Series against the Chicago White Sox as a National League team, as well as the 2017 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, the 2019 World Series against the Washington Nationals, the 2021 World Series against the Atlanta Braves and the 2022 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies as an American League team. This also makes this one of two World Series in the modern era (1903–present) that is not possible to have a rematch, the other being the Astros and White Sox, due to the Astros moving to the American League in 2013.

The Brewers and Cardinals would later meet in the 2011 National League Championship Series, with the Cardinals winning that series four games to two. As in 1982, the Cardinals won the 2011 World Series in seven games, this time against the Texas Rangers. As of 2015, the Cardinals&#x27; 11 championships are the most won by any National League team, and second only to the New York Yankees, who have 27. As of the 1982 World Series victory, the Cardinals had 9 championships compared to the Yankees&#x27; 22.

The Cardinals would remain competitive for the rest of the decade and returned to the World Series in 1985 and 1987 but lost both times in seven games. St. Louis wouldn&#x27;t get back to the fall classic until 2004 (losing to Boston) and would not win another World Championship until 2006 when they beat Detroit in five games.

The Brewers have not returned to the World Series as of yet. This would be the last championship series of the four major North American sports leagues to feature a team from Milwaukee until the Milwaukee Bucks made and won the 2021 NBA Finals, and the last Wisconsin-based team to play in a championship game until the Green Bay Packers (who at the time of the 1982 World Series played two home games a year at Milwaukee County Stadium and remains de facto supported by Milwaukee today) won Super Bowl XXXI.

This would be the final World Series where both teams wore pullover style uniforms. From 1984-87, at least one team wore pullovers (although in 1984, the Tigers only wore them on the road). No team has worn pullover uniforms in the fall classic since the Cincinnati Reds in 1990. The Brewers, who started wearing pullovers in 1972, switched to button-downs in 1990; the Cardinals, one of the earliest adopters of pullovers (1971), were the second-to-last team to ditch them, doing so in 1992 to celebrate the franchise&#x27;s centennial (the Reds were the last team to wear pullovers, switching in 1993).

==Broadcasting==
This was the final World Series telecast for longtime NBC analyst Tony Kubek, and the only one for veteran announcer Dick Enberg. Enberg hosted the pregame shows and alternated play-by-play duties (Enberg called the middle innings) with Joe Garagiola, who was himself working his last Series in that role before moving to the color commentator position alongside Vin Scully (who called the 1982 World Series alongside Sparky Anderson for CBS Radio) the following season. Conversely, this was NBC&#x27;s first Series telecast to feature Bob Costas (who served as a field reporter and hosted the World Series Trophy presentation following Game 7). Costas and Kubek would subsequently team up as the network&#x27;s secondary MLB announcing team from 1983 to 1989. This included the June 23, 1984, game between St. Louis and Chicago otherwise known as the Ryne Sandberg game. Tom Seaver provided pregame analysis and also contributed occasional in-game commentary throughout the series, broadcasting from field level rather than in the booth.

Locally, the Series was broadcast by the teams&#x27; flagship radio stations using their own announcers. In Milwaukee, WISN aired the games with Bob Uecker and Dwayne Mosley announcing, while in St. Louis, KMOX aired the games with Jack Buck and Mike Shannon announcing.

<doc id="1218021" wikidata="Q1865583" url="?curid=1218021" title="Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument">
<text>Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument preserves the site of the June 25 and 26, 1876, Battle of the Little Bighorn, near Crow Agency, Montana, in the United States. It also serves as a memorial to those who fought in the battle: George Armstrong Custer&#x27;s 7th Cavalry and a combined Lakota-Northern Cheyenne and Arapaho force. Custer National Cemetery, on the battlefield, is part of the national monument. The site of the connected military action led by Marcus Reno and Frederick Benteen is also part of the National Monument, but is about 3 miles (4.83 km) southeast of the main site.

==History of site==
The geography of the site is complex, consisting of dissected uplands, rugged bluffs, the Little Bighorn River, and adjacent plains. Vegetation varies widely from one area to the next.
* June 25 and 26, 1876: Battle of the Little Bighorn
* 1877: Custer, who had been buried there, was reinterred in West Point Cemetery.
* January 29, 1879: The Secretary of War first preserved the site as a U.S. National Cemetery, to protect graves of the 7th Cavalry troopers buried there.
* December 7, 1886: The site was proclaimed &quot;National Cemetery of Custer&#x27;s Battlefield Reservation&quot; to include burials of other campaigns and wars. The name has been shortened to &quot;Custer National Cemetery.&quot;
* November 5, 1887: Battle of Crow Agency, three miles north of Custer battlefield
* April 14, 1926: Reno-Benteen Battlefield was added
* July 1, 1940: The site was transferred from the United States Department of War to the National Park Service
* March 22, 1946: The site was redesignated &quot;Custer Battlefield National Monument.&quot;
* October 15, 1966: The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
* 1976, The American Indian Movement (AIM) protested the centennial commemoration of the site, arguing that the site revered Custer and the Battle of Little Big Horn as a part of a heroic saga of American history and expansion into the American West while those who revered it had been truly &quot;celebrating an act of genocide.&quot;
* August 11, 1983: A wildfire destroyed dense thorn scrub which over the years had seeded itself about and covered the site. This allowed archaeologists access to the site.
* 1984, 1985: Archaeological digging on site.
* December 10, 1991: The site was renamed &quot;Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument&quot; by a law signed by President George H. W. Bush.

==Memorials==

The first memorial on the site was assembled by Captain George K. Sanderson and the 11th Infantry. They buried soldiers&#x27; bodies where they were found and removed animal bones. In his official report dated April 7, 1879, Sanderson wrote:

I accordingly built a mound out of cord wood filled in the center with all the horse bones I could find on the field. In the center of the mound I dug a grave and interred all the human bones that could be found, in all, parts of four or five different bodies. This grave was then built up with wood for four feet above ground. The mound is ten feet square and about eleven feet high; is built on the highest point immediately in rear of where Gen&#x27;l Custer&#x27;s body was found ...

Lieutenant Charles F. Roe and the 2nd Cavalry built the granite memorial in July 1881 that stands today on the top of Last Stand Hill. They also reinterred soldiers&#x27; remains near the new memorial, but left stakes in the ground to mark where they had fallen. In 1890 these stakes were replaced with marble markers.

The bill that changed the name of the national monument also called for an &quot;Indian Memorial&quot; to be built near Last Stand Hill.

Markers honoring the Indians who fought at Little Big Horn, including Crazy Horse, have been added to those of the U.S. troops. On Memorial Day, 1999, the first of five red granite markers denoting where warriors fell during the battle were placed on the battlefield for Cheyenne warriors Lame White Man and Noisy Walking.

The Indian Memorial (2001–2003) was designed by John R. Collins and Alison J. Towers, who won a national competition in 1997 set out by Congress. Constructed of sandstone, it takes the form of a circular low wall that is topped with sculptor Colleen Cutschall (Oglala and Sicangu)&#x27;s bronze figure procession &quot;Spirit Warriors&quot;. Then-Colorado Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell spoke at the dedication of the monument:  &quot;[...] Come back sometime early in the morning after a rain when the fog is laying in the valleys and things are quiet and the moon is waning, and perhaps all you can hear is the sounds of nature. If you&#x27;re here by yourself during that time, I know you&#x27;ll feel like Indian people feel when they&#x27;re here.&quot; Nighthorse Campbell is descended from one of the Cheyenne leaders who fought General Custer.

The warriors&#x27; red speckled granite memorial markers dot the ravines and hillsides, just as do the white marble markers representing where soldiers fell. Since then, markers have been added for the Sans Arc Lakota warrior Long Road and the Minniconjou Lakota Dog&#x27;s Back Bone.

On June 25, 2003, an &quot;unknown Lakota warrior marker&quot; was placed on Wooden Leg Hill, east of Last Stand Hill to honor a warrior who was killed during the battle, as witnessed and reported by the Northern Cheyenne warrior Wooden Leg.

The battlefield is the final resting place of the western historian and author Stanley Vestal, a professor at the University of Oklahoma.

Prior to 1934 the SS were nominally under the command of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; and so it could be said that both Adolf Hitler as &quot;Oberster SA-Führer&quot; and Ernst Röhm as &quot;Stabschef SA&quot; outranked the most senior SS position of &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;. Following the Night of the Long Knives Hitler &quot;raised the SS, hitherto subordinate to the SA, to the rank of an independent organisation&quot;. Hitler also was considered SS Member No. 1, Emil Maurice (considered the founder of the SS) was member No. 2, although leadership was assumed by Julius Schreck who was member No. 5. Himmler was SS member No. 168. Based on the seniority system of SS membership number, this made Hitler senior in the SS to all other members even if not by rank.

After the Night of the Long Knives, when the SS became independent from the SA, Hitler was listed on SS officer rolls as member No. 1 and considered supreme commander of the entire SS (&quot;Oberster Führer der Schutzstaffel&quot;: Literally, &quot;Supreme Leader of the SS&quot;) by virtue of his position as the Führer of Germany. There is no photographic record of Hitler ever wearing an actual SS uniform nor was there a special SS insignia for Hitler above that worn by Himmler.

<text>Withywood is a suburban neighbourhood of Bristol, England. It is situated on the southern border of the city, between Hartcliffe and Bishopsworth, just north of Dundry Hill. It is a large estate, begun in the 1950s.

Withywood has a number of primary schools: Fair Furlong, Four Acres, Gay Elms and Merchants Academy. There is a secondary school, Merchants Academy, which opened in November 2008, before the demolition of the former Withywood Community School. All of the schools have sports fields and grounds. They have also been a registered charity since 1996.

Queen&#x27;s Road has a number of shops and the Amelia Nutt Health Clinic at the Withywood Centre. Four Acres road also has shops directly opposite Sherrin Way bus terminus (the end of the journey) next to &#x27;The Rusham&#x27; retirement homes. It has a pub, from Elm Tree.

Between Sherrin Way and The Coppice, runs the River Malago. This disappears into a culvert where the stream meets Four Acres.

A big regeneration program is taking place around the area, new apartments on Hengrove Way and further development of The Junction shopping complex, and a proposal of a swimming pool and leisure complex alongside Cineworld, all within walking distance of Withywood. The Dundry View Neighbourhood Partnership works with residents in Bedminster Down, Bishopsworth, Hartcliffe, Headley Park, Highridge, Teyfant, Uplands, Whitchurch Park and Withywood.

For elections to Bristol City Council, the area is part of Hartcliffe and Withywood electoral ward.</text><links>

<text>John Henry Carless (11 November 1896 – 17 November 1917) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross during the First World War.

==Early life ==

Carless was born in 1896 to John Thomas Carless, an iron foundry worker, and his wife Elizabeth, of 31 Tasker Street, Walsall, Staffordshire (now in the West Midlands). Carless had two sisters, Ada and Dora, who were each employed in the local leather trade.

He was good at sport and played in the final of the English Schools Football Shield, at Roker Park.

After school, he too joined the leather trade, working for Messrs Price and Co., harness makers, as an errand boy.

During World War I, he applied repeatedly to join the army, but was turned down on four occasions, due to a &quot;weak heart&quot;. His subsequent application to join the Royal Navy was accepted, and he enlisted on 1 September 1915. His service number was J43703.
He was 21 when he died.

==VC==

He died when he was 21 years old, and an Ordinary Seaman in the Royal Navy during World War I. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his gallant actions on 17 November 1917 aboard &quot;HMS Caledon&quot; at the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight, Germany, which led to his death.

In mid-November 1917 British ships battled German forces in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight (off Germany&#x27;s north coast). During the action Seaman Carless took a fatal shrapnel wound to the stomach but kept loading his gun, and encouraged his colleagues to do likewise. Once relieved, he collapsed and died. He was buried at sea the following day.

The commander of HMS Caledon, H.S. Harrison-Wallace, subsequently wrote Carless&#x27;s parents:

In June 1918, Carless&#x27;s parents received his posthumous VC from King George V.

=== Citation ===

==Memorials==

The Walsall public raised money for the erection of a memorial in his home town. A bronze bust was created by Wolverhampton-based Robert Jackson Emerson (1878–1944) mounted on a large plinth of Portland stone, outside Walsall Museum (at ), Lichfield Street. On 20 February 1920 it was unveiled by Admiral Sir Walter Cowan, whose flagship had been &quot;HMS Caledon&quot;, and the ship&#x27;s white ensign was presented to Walsall&#x27;s mayor at the time.

Carless is listed on Panel 25 of the Portsmouth Naval Memorial. Three thoroughfares in Walsall commemorate John Carless&#x27; bravery – Carless Street, in Caldmore, not far from where he was born, along with Caledon Street and Caledon Place in Pleck. A blue plaque on Carless Street notes the origins of the street&#x27;s name.

In December 2009, a memorial plaque to Carless and two other recipients of the Victoria Cross, James Thompson and Charles George Bonner, was unveiled at Walsall Town Hall.

In 2014, a memorial paving stone was placed in the grounds of St Mary&#x27;s the Mount Catholic Primary School in Walsall, where Carless was educated.

=== Museum exhibits ===

The former Walsall Museum had a display on Carless, including a replica of his VC (the original, bequeathed to the people of Walsall in 1986, is held in store, for security reasons), the ship&#x27;s name-band from his uniform cap, and an oil portrait, commissioned by the Walsall Services Memorial Club. After that museum&#x27;s closure, the display was moved to Walsall Leather Museum.

<text>John Byrne, (September 1832 – 10 July 1879) was a British Army soldier and an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
Byrne was born at Castlecomer, County Kilkenny in Ireland, in September 1832.

Byrne was about 22 years old, and a private in the 68th Regiment of Foot (later The Durham Light Infantry), British Army during the Crimean War. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions at the Battle of Inkerman on 5 November 1854 on the Crimean Peninsula. When his regiment was ordered to retire, Private Byrne went back towards the enemy, and, at the risk of his own life, brought in a wounded soldier, under fire. On 11 May 1855 he bravely engaged in a hand-to-hand contest with one of the enemy on the parapet of the work he was defending, prevented the entrance of the enemy, killed his antagonist, and captured his arms.

He later achieved the rank of corporal. He died, aged 46, in Newport, Wales.

==The medal==
The only medal on display is his New Zealand campaign medal, held in the Durham Light Infantry Museum.

A Victoria Cross medal (missing the suspender bar and ribbon) was found by Tobias Neto in the mud of the River Thames on 17 December 2015, the medal having the date of &quot;November 5, 1854&quot; engraved on the reverse. Of the 16 VCs awarded for actions during the Battle of Inkerman, two were unaccounted for—those won by John Byrne and John McDermond of the 47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot, the other 14 being in private collections or museums. However, in an article published on the UK Detector Net web forum, the finder is seen to claim that the medal was established as that awarded to John Byrne, but on the basis of its dated reverse and not the critical suspension bar which bears the awardee&#x27;s name, rank, serial number and regiment. It remains possible the recipient could have been McDermond or Byrne.

<text>Sergeant John Carmichael (1 April 1893 – 20 December 1977) was a British Army soldier and a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Carmichael was 24 years old, and a sergeant in the 9th Battalion, The North Staffordshire Regiment (The Prince of Wales&#x27;s), during the First World War when he selflessly shielded others from a grenade which he saw had been initiated. He was seriously injured by the explosion and could not walk for three years afterwards. 

== Deed ==
The following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. 

On 8 September 1917, when excavating a trench near Hill 60, Zwarteleen, Belgium, Sergeant Carmichael saw that a grenade had been unearthed and had started to burn. Rather than simply throwing the bomb out of the trench and endangering the lives of the men working on top, he immediately rushed to the spot shouting for his men to get clear, put his steel helmet over the grenade and then stood on the helmet. The grenade exploded, blowing him out of the trench causing him serious injuries, but no one else was hurt.

== Afterwards ==

=== Honoured by home town ===
On 9 July 1918, Carmichael was honoured in a ceremony in Airdrie town hall, near the village of Glenmavis where he was raised.

=== Freemasonry ===
He was initiated into Freemasonry in Lodge New Monkland, No. 88, (Airdrie, Scotland) on 9 January, Passed on 23 January and Raised on 27 March 1919.

==The Medal==
His VC is displayed at the Staffordshire Regiment Museum, Whittington Barracks, Lichfield, Staffordshire.

<text>The 1981 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1981 season. The 78th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers. It marked their third Series meeting in five years and was their 11th overall Series meeting. The Dodgers won the Series in six games, as the Yankees had done in the teams&#x27; prior two Series meetings, in and . This was the Dodgers&#x27; first title since , their first victory over the Yankees since , and third overall Series win over the Yankees.

This is the most recent World Series that a team won after losing the first two games on the road, the next previous instance being the Yankees&#x27; victory over the Dodgers in the 1978 World Series. This was the last meeting between teams from New York City and Los Angeles for a major professional sports championship until the Los Angeles Kings and New York Rangers reached the NHL&#x27;s 2014 Stanley Cup Finals, as well as the last meeting between the Dodgers and the Yankees in the World Series until 2024. The Dodgers-Yankees matchup has been the most frequent pairing in World Series history.

==Background==

Due to the players&#x27; strike, which ran from June 12 to August 8, the 1981 season was split into two halves, with the first-place teams from each half in each division (or a wild card team if the same club won both halves, although this did not occur in any division) meeting in the best-of-five League Division Series (this division series was a one-off occasion; it was not until 1994 that the Division Series would be implemented on a permanent basis). The four survivors would then move on to the two best-of-five League Championship Series. The expanded playoffs led to Game 1 of the World Series being pushed back to October 20, the latest starting date for a Fall Classic up to that time.

In the National League, the Dodgers led the National League West prior to the strike. The Houston Astros, however, won the second-half division title. The Dodgers then defeated the Astros, three games to two, in the National League Division Series before beating the Montreal Expos, three games to two, in the National League Championship Series.

The Yankees, who led the American League East in the season&#x27;s first half, took on the Milwaukee Brewers, winners of the second half division title, in the American League Division Series. New York was victorious three games to two, then went on to sweep the Oakland Athletics in the American League Championship Series.

The split-season decision was not a popular one, both among teams and their fans. The arrangement resulted in teams with the best overall record in either their division or league that year being left out of the postseason, in particular the Cincinnati Reds, who had the best overall record in the majors, and the St. Louis Cardinals, who finished with the best overall record in the NL East. Though the teams with the best record in the American League East and West did win their divisions, the Yankees finished 3rd overall in the AL East while the Kansas City Royals finished 4th overall with a losing 50–53 record.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
The Dodgers got to the Series with help from Mexican-born rookie phenom Fernando Valenzuela, who won his first eight games including five by shutout. Valenzuela would pitch eight shutouts in all and win both the National League&#x27;s Rookie of the Year and Cy Young awards. Joining Valenzuela in the rotation were veterans Burt Hooton (11–6, 2.28) and Jerry Reuss (10–4, 2.30). The core of the position players remained intact with perennial all-star Steve Garvey at first, Davey Lopes at second, Bill Russell at shortstop, and team leader in home runs with 13, Ron Cey at third. Budding star, Pedro Guerrero, would move to the outfield becoming a regular starter for the first time in his career, in place of the aging and often injured Reggie Smith.

Manager Tommy Lasorda was looking for his first World Series win in his fifth full season with the Dodgers after losing to the Yankees in and 1978.

===New York Yankees===
The Yankees, managed by Bob Lemon (in his second stint, having replaced Gene Michael), had a losing second-half (25–26) but won the first-half (34–22) to qualify for the playoffs. Ace starter Ron Guidry won 11 games against while rookie Dave Righetti emerged as an important starter, winning eight games with a 2.05 ERA. Righetti would win the American League&#x27;s Rookie of the Year award. Reliever Goose Gossage recorded 20 saves with an 0.77 ERA, striking out 48 in 47 innings.

Dave Winfield was signed as a free agent in the off-season, joined another all-star, Reggie Jackson, in the outfield. Winfield led the Yankees with 25 doubles and 68 RBIs. Winfield&#x27;s huge contract (US$21 million over 10 years), was added to an already strong lineup.

==Summary==

: postponed from October 27 due to rain

==Matchups==

===Game 1===
The Series commenced on October 20, making it the latest start of the Series, breaking the previous record by three days (1910 World Series, October 17). Bob Watson smashed a three-run homer off Jerry Reuss in the first to get the Yankees started. Lou Piniella chased Reuss with an RBI single in the third, and Dodger reliever Bobby Castillo walked four batters in the fourth (the last being a walk to Dave Winfield that forced home a run) to give New York a 5–0 lead. Ron Guidry held the Dodgers to four hits and a run (on a Steve Yeager homer) through seven innings. Ron Davis gave up two in the eighth by walking Derrel Thomas and Davey Lopes to lead off. After the walks, Davis was relieved by closer Goose Gossage who gave up a pinch-hit RBI single to Jay Johnstone and a sacrifice fly by Dusty Baker to score Thomas and Lopes, but Gossage closed out the win in the ninth. Yankee third baseman Graig Nettles suffered a hairline fracture of his left thumb when he made a diving stop. The injury caused him to miss Games 3, 4, and 5, but he played in Games 2 and 6.

===Game 2===
Former teammates Burt Hooton and Tommy John were locked in a scoreless duel until the fifth, when Larry Milbourne doubled in Willie Randolph for the only run John would really need. The Yankees pushed across two more in the eighth off Steve Howe on a RBI single by Bob Watson and a sacrifice fly by Randolph. John pitched seven shutout innings, and Goose Gossage closed for his second save in two games. Shortly after this game concluded, a small fire broke out in the interview room of Yankee Stadium (that began in a storage locker area of the room); the blaze was contained an hour later, with no injuries occurring; damage to the room was light.

===Game 3===
Prior to this game, Yankee manager Bob Lemon sat Reggie Jackson. Jackson injured himself running the bases in Game 2 of the ALCS and missed the first two games of the World Series, but was medically cleared to play Game 3. Jackson was not even allowed to pinch-hit. Lemon said he was resting Jackson as a precaution and because the Dodgers were starting a left hand pitcher. However, speculation was that Yankees&#x27; owner George Steinbrenner felt the Yankees would win the next two games of the series easily without Jackson, so he ordered Lemon to keep him out of this game. After the series was over, Steinbrenner would let Jackson walk as a free agent since his initial five-year contract was up and Steinbrenner had signed Dave Winfield as essentially Jackson&#x27;s replacement.

The starters of game 3 were AL Rookie of the Year Dave Righetti for the Yankees and NL Rookie of the Year (and Cy Young Award winner) Fernando Valenzuela. Valenzuela lasted the entire game despite allowing nine hits, four runs, walking seven, and constantly pitching out of trouble. He walked two Yankee batters in the first, but pitched out of it. Righetti allowed a leadoff double to Davey Lopes and a single to Bill Russell. Ron Cey then hit a three-run homer off Righetti. Righetti would only last two innings before being relieved.

The Yankees cut it to 3–2 in the second on a Bob Watson homer and a Larry Milbourne RBI single. Valenzuela stranded two runners in this inning. Rick Cerone gave the Yanks a 4–3 lead in the third with a two-run homer, but the Yankees left two on once again. Watson led off the fifth with a double, but no one scored as Valenzuela pitched out of it again. In both the third and fifth innings, the Dodgers were helped by the Yankees&#x27; being unable to use a designated hitter (since it was used in last season&#x27;s Series). In both innings, Valenzuela issued two-out intentional walks to number 8 hitter Larry Milbourne in order to pitch to Dave Righetti and George Frazier. Valenzuela struck out the pitchers both times.

The Dodgers gave Valenzuela the lead back in the bottom of the fifth off Frazier when Pedro Guerrero doubled in Steve Garvey to tie it, and Cey scored on a double play grounder by Mike Scioscia. With a lead and the Dodger Stadium crowd behind him, Valenzuela appeared to finally settle down. After pinch hitting, Valenzuela&#x27;s regular catcher Mike Scioscia took over behind the plate. This seemed to have a calming effect on the rookie, as Scioscia knew Spanish and was better able to talk with Valenzuela than Steve Yeager.

The Yankees mounted their final threat in the eighth when Aurelio Rodríguez and Milbourne led off with back-to-back singles. Pinch-hitter Bobby Murcer attempted a sacrifice bunt, but popped it foul. Cey dove and caught it, then doubled Milbourne off first.

Valenzuela, despite giving up 9 hits (including 2 homers), walking 7, and throwing 149 pitches in facing 40 batters, went the distance to give the Dodgers their first win of the series.

===Game 4===
After being held out of game 3, Reggie Jackson was back in the starting lineup for this game. The Yankees batters had early success against Dodgers pitcher Bob Welch, who faced four batters without recording an out before being relieved by Dave Goltz. Willie Randolph led the game off with a triple and scored on a Larry Milbourne double. Dave Winfield walked and Jackson singled before Goltz gave up a sacrifice fly to Bob Watson. Randolph smashed a two-out solo home run in the second and Rick Cerone batted in a run with a single in the third for a 4–0 Yankee lead.

Yankee starter Rick Reuschel then had problems of his own. He allowed an RBI single to Davey Lopes and an RBI groundout to Ron Cey in the third before leaving in favor of Rudy May. May gave up a double to Steve Garvey and an RBI single to Cey in the fifth, but the Yankees countered with two in the sixth on RBI singles by Oscar Gamble and Watson off Tom Niedenfuer. Watson&#x27;s hit was a sinking liner that Dusty Baker attempted to catch, but it was ruled a trap.

With a 6–3 lead, the Yankees turned the pitching over to their relief combination of Ron Davis and Goose Gossage. Davis had troubles in the sixth. He issued a one-out walk to Mike Scioscia and gave up a pinch-hit homer to Jay Johnstone to make the score 6–5. Then, Lopes lifted a fly ball to right that Jackson lost in the sun and dropped for an error. Lopes reached second and stole third with no throw by catcher Cerone three pitches later. Davis then gave up a game-tying single to Bill Russell.

In the seventh, Dusty Baker led off with an infield hit off George Frazier and went to third on a Rick Monday liner that got past center fielder Bobby Brown when he tried to make a shoestring catch. Monday reached second on the double. Pedro Guerrero was then walked intentionally. Yankee manager Bob Lemon then brought starting pitcher Tommy John out of the bullpen instead of Gossage. Steve Yeager, hitting for Scioscia, promptly gave the Dodgers the lead when he drove home Baker with a sacrifice fly and moved Monday to third. Lopes followed with an infield single that drove Monday home for an 8–6 lead. John managed to strand Guerrero in scoring position to end the seventh and pitched the last two innings, but closer Gossage never got in the game.

Jackson brought the Yankees closer with a home run in the eighth off lefty Steve Howe, capping a 3-for-3 day. The home run was Jackson&#x27;s 10th and final in World Series play, tying Lou Gehrig. But Howe was able to close out the win, despite Willie Randolph pinning Dodger centerfielder Derrell Thomas against the centerfield wall with a deep fly ball. The series was now tied 2–2.

According to Johnstone&#x27;s book &quot;Temporary Insanity&quot; (1985), Steinbrenner confronted Davis in the Yankees&#x27; locker room after the game and demanded to know, &quot;Why did you throw Johnstone a fastball?&quot;

===Game 5===
Needing a win to stop the Dodgers&#x27; momentum in this series, the Yankees trotted out their ace, Ron Guidry. Guidry was sharp through six innings, holding the Dodgers to two singles. Reggie Jackson, continuing his torrid hitting, helped provide Guidry a lead by doubling to left in the second off Jerry Reuss, moving to third on a Davey Lopes error, and scoring on a Lou Piniella infield single.

The game then took a turn in the seventh inning. After fanning Dusty Baker, Guidry surrendered back-to-back solo home runs to Pedro Guerrero and Steve Yeager. After he had struck out, Baker suggested to Yeager and Guerrero that they move up in the batter&#x27;s box to take away Guidry&#x27;s late breaking slider. Both home runs were hit on sliders almost to the same place in left-center. Meanwhile, Reuss was as effective as Guidry, holding the Yanks to five hits and the lone run and going the distance.

A tense moment occurred in the eighth when Goose Gossage beaned Ron Cey. Cey had to be helped off the field with a concussion, but was cleared to play Game 6 after it was delayed one day by rain.

===Game 6===
This was the latest-ending World Series by calendar date up to that time (surpassing the 1911 World Series, which ended on October 26). Originally scheduled for Tuesday, October 27, Game 6 was postponed a day by rain. This allowed Bob Lemon to start Tommy John opposite Dodger starter Burt Hooton, and also allowed Ron Cey to be in the Dodger lineup. Willie Randolph provided John an early lead with a solo homer in the third. The Dodgers tied it in the fourth on an RBI single by Game 5 hero Steve Yeager.

In the bottom of the fourth, Yankee manager Bob Lemon made a controversial decision. Graig Nettles led off the inning with a double. After Hooton retired the next two batters, he intentionally walked Larry Milbourne to face John (there was no designated hitter in this series). Lemon pinch-hit for his starting pitcher in the fourth inning of a 1–1 game. Pinch-hitter Bobby Murcer flied out to end the inning. In his 1991 autobiography &quot;T.J.: My 26 Years in Baseball&quot;, John revealed that before the game, Lemon and team owner George Steinbrenner settled on the following strategy: get the lead early and then protect it with the bullpen (despite the bullpen&#x27;s collapses earlier in the series). As ABC cameras showed during the broadcast, John paced the Yankee dugout in disbelief after being pulled.

In the fifth, George Frazier, who relieved John, gave up an RBI single to Ron Cey and a two-run triple to Pedro Guerrero. Frazier would take the loss and become the first pitcher to lose three games in a best-of-seven World Series and second pitcher to lose three times in any World Series (the first being Lefty Williams, a member of the Chicago White Sox in the best-of-nine 1919 World Series).

New York&#x27;s bullpen further collapsed in the sixth. Ron Davis issued one-out walks to pitcher Hooton and Davey Lopes. Bill Russell singled to short left field, and Hooton unexpectedly rounded third and headed home. Dave Winfield stumbled on the wet grass, fell forward, and uncorked an errant throw. Hooton scored standing, after which Lemon pulled Davis in favor of Rick Reuschel. On Reuschel&#x27;s second pitch, Lopes and Russell pulled a double steal. Reuschel walked Steve Garvey intentionally and gave up an RBI force-out to pinch-hitter Derrel Thomas. After Dusty Baker reached on an error by Nettles, loading the bases again, Guerrero singled in two more runs. The Yankees would score in the bottom of the sixth on a pinch-hit RBI single by Lou Piniella. Guerrero would cap a five-RBI night, and the Dodgers&#x27; World Series win, by blasting a solo home run in the eighth off Yankee reliever Rudy May.
Burt Hooton would pitch innings and get the win. Steve Howe replaced him and earned the save.

Winfield&#x27;s throw typified his struggles in this, his first World Series. At the plate, he went 1-for-22 with one RBI. After the series, Steinbrenner issued a public apology to the City of New York for his team&#x27;s performance, while at the same time assuring the fans that plans to put the team together for 1982 would begin immediately. The Yankee owner was criticized by players and press alike for doing so, as many people felt losing a World Series was not something for which a team needed to apologize.

For the first time, there were co-MVPs in a World Series: Cey (.350 avg., 7-for-20, HR, 6 RBIs), Yeager (.286 avg., 4-for-14, 2 HR&#x27;s), and Guerrero (.333 avg, 7-for-21, 2 HR&#x27;s, 7 RBIs) shared the award.

==Epilogue==
After combining for ten division titles and eight World Series appearances between 1974 and 1981, the 1981 World Series marked the end of an era for both teams as they soon were without key contributors.

The Yankees lost Reggie Jackson (who left in free agency), Graig Nettles (traded to the San Diego Padres in 1984), Goose Gossage (left in free agency in 1984, also to the Padres, only to play once more with them in 1989), and Tommy John (traded away to the California Angels in 1982 before returning in 1986), among others. Bob Lemon lasted fourteen games in the next season before being dismissed by Steinbrenner despite promises to finish the whole season (although Lemon was quoted as being relieved over the decision). The franchise would not reach the postseason again until 1995, which included nine different managers at the helm for Yankees (such as Billy Martin, who was re-hired and re-fired three times from 1983 to 1988 after having led the Yankees to victory against the Dodgers in the 1977 World Series) despite worthy play from Winfield and Don Mattingly, who debuted in 1982 (incidentally, Steinbrenner&#x27;s growing irritation with Winfield would soon lead to a three-year ban from baseball and Winfield&#x27;s subsequent trade to the Angels). The lone World Series appearance in the 1980s meant it was the first decade in which the Yankees did not win a title since the 1910s, and the first ever since the &quot;live-ball&quot; era, which would not happen again until the 2010s.

Key Dodger losses included Reggie Smith (who signed with the San Francisco Giants after the season), Davey Lopes (traded in the off season), Ron Cey (traded in 1982), Steve Garvey (who departed for the San Diego Padres in 1983). This marked the end of the -year Dodger infield of Garvey, Lopes, Russell and Cey. With a stronger farm system and adding valuable players via trade or free agency, they did win division titles in 1983 and 1985, while narrowly missing in 1982. However, they lost in the NLCS both years. Their success culminated with a world championship in 1988, becoming the only team to win two World Series between 1978 and 1990, and the only team to win more than one World Series title during the 1980s. However, since their 1988 World Series win, the Dodgers would not appear in another World Series until 2017 (which they lost to the Houston Astros), despite reaching the NLCS in 2008, 2009, 2013, and 2016. They would also appear in the World Series in 2018 against the Boston Red Sox, which they also lost. They finally broke their World Series Championship drought by winning in 2020 against the Tampa Bay Rays. They returned to the World Series in 2024, in which they defeated the Yankees. The Yankees, on the other hand, appeared in eight World Series (1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2009, and 2024) in that span, winning all but 2001, 2003 and 2024. 

Former Dodgers pitcher and later Spanish radio color analyst Fernando Valenzuela, who notably threw 147 pitches in the Dodgers Game 3 victory and was one of the Dodgers&#x27; most prominent players during the 1981 season, died shortly before the 2024 Dodgers-Yankees World Series rematch. The Dodgers afterwards announced plans to pay tribute to Valenzuela at the 2024 World Series. The Dodgers celebrated their World Series victory on what would have been Fernando&#x27;s 64th birthday.

Yankees pitcher George Frazier tied a World Series record for losing three of the six games in 1981. The only other pitcher to lose that many was the Chicago White Sox&#x27;s Lefty Williams, who intentionally lost his three starts in the infamous 1919 World Series.

==Broadcasting==
ABC covered this World Series on television in the United States, its third under the then-present contract of alternating Series coverage with NBC. Keith Jackson and Al Michaels shared play-by-play duties, with Michaels replacing Jackson when the latter deferred to his primary role as ABC&#x27;s lead college football announcer. Color commentary was handled by Howard Cosell and Baltimore Orioles pitcher Jim Palmer; Palmer would later join ABC&#x27;s baseball broadcast team after retiring as a player in 1984. ABC&#x27;s coverage was simulcast over the Yankees&#x27; and Dodgers&#x27; local TV outlets, respectively WPIX in New York City and KTTV in Los Angeles.

This World Series was the last to be called by Jackson in the broadcast booth. Michaels became ABC&#x27;s lead baseball play-by-play announcer (and their exclusive World Series announcer) by the time the network next aired the World Series in 1983.

On radio, CBS Radio carried the games with Vin Scully handling play-by-play and Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson providing analysis, both working together for the third consecutive year. Scully was the Dodgers&#x27; primary radio/TV announcer during the regular season. When the Dodgers next appeared in the World Series in 1988, Scully called the series nationally on television for NBC.

==In popular culture==

After the series, Johnstone, Yeager, Reuss, and Rick Monday of the Dodgers recorded a cover version of Queen&#x27;s &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; under the name &quot;Big Blue Wrecking Crew&quot;. The quartet performed the song on an episode of the syndicated musical TV show &quot;Solid Gold&quot;.

<text>Harry Cator VC, MM (24 January 1894 – 7 April 1966) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Cator was born in Drayton, Norfolk, to railway worker Robert Cator, and his wife Laura. After leaving school, he was a porter on the London Midland and Great Northern Joint Line before joining a building contractor in Great Yarmouth.

He joined the British Army in September 1914 and arrived on the Western Front in June 1915 already a sergeant in the 7th (Service) Battalion, East Surrey Regiment. In 1916 at the time of the Battle of the Somme, he was awarded the Military Medal for bringing back 36 wounded men from No man&#x27;s land.

He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the Arras offensive. On 9 April 1917 near Arras, Sergeant Cator&#x27;s platoon had suffered heavy casualties from a hostile machine gun. Under heavy fire the sergeant, with one man, advanced across the open to attack the gun and when his companion was killed, he went on alone. Picking up a Lewis gun and some ammunition drums on his way, he succeeded in reaching the enemy trench and sighting another hostile machine gun, he killed the entire team and the officer. He held the end of the trench with such effect that a bombing squad were able to capture 100 prisoners and five machine guns.

A few days later he was injured by an exploding shell. It was shortly after that the award of the VC and the French Croix de Guerre were announced. After the war he worked as a postman and as a civil servant.

Cator served with the rank of captain in the Home Guard during the Second World War, and was commandant of a prisoner-of-war camp near Cranwick. He retired from the Army in December 1947.

He died of pneumonia in Norwich on 7 April 1966 and is buried in Sprowston cemetery.

His VC and other medals are displayed in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum.

<text>Dundry Hill is immediately south of Bristol, England: it includes farmland, a small number of houses and a church. It stretches east–west for some two miles. Most of the hill is within the district of North Somerset. At the hill&#x27;s eastern end the southern slopes are within Bath and North East Somerset, and the northern slopes are within the city and county of Bristol, including the highest point in that county.

The village of Dundry, with its prominent church, is near the summit. At the eastern end is Maes Knoll, near Norton Malreward, an Iron Age hillfort and the start of Wansdyke. To the South lies the Chew Valley.
On the western side of the hill is a spring which becomes the Land Yeo.

Dundry Main Road South Quarry is a 0.7 hectare geological Site of Special Scientific Interest near the village of East Dundry, because of the number of fossils in the inferior oolite. The Main Road Quarry exposes a fine section in the Middle and Upper Inferior Oolite, with the rocks lying stratigraphically below them visible at Barns Batch Spinney. The former characterised by a typically southern English-Normandy fauna, including the rich ammonite occurrences of the &quot;Brown iron-shot&quot;, and the latter by contrasting faunas of Cotswold aspect. This contrast is direct evidence for movements of the Mendip Axis in Middle Jurassic times, making this an outstanding site for its bearing on studies of palaeogeography.

<text>George Forrest VC (c. 1800 – 3 November 1859) was born St Michael&#x27;s, Dublin and was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Forrest was about 57 years old, and a lieutenant in the Bengal Veteran Establishment, Bengal Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 11 May 1857 at Delhi, India for which he was awarded the VC.

Lieutenant Forrest was one of nine men who defended the Magazine for more than five hours against large numbers of rebels, until, on the wall being scaled and there being no hope of help, they fired the Magazine. Five of the defending band died in the explosion and one shortly afterwards, but many of the enemy were killed. See also John Buckley and William Raynor. His citation in the London Gazette reads:

Forrest later achieved the rank of captain and died at Dehra Dun, India, on 3 November 1859.

<text>Arthur Charles Hall, VC (11 August 1896 – 25 February 1978) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. His Victoria Cross was won for his actions in September 1918 on the Western Front during the First World War.

==Early life==
Hall was born on 11 August 1896 in the Sydney suburb of Granville, New South Wales, to a livestock farmer and his wife. After attending school in Bathurst, he worked with his father on properties near Nyngan.

==Military career==
In April 1916, at the age of 19, Hall enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). After training, he was posted to 54th Battalion, then serving on the Western Front in France. He was wounded in late March 1917, within two months of arriving in France. Back in the front lines by late April, he saw action during the Battle of Bullecourt and later, during the second phase of the Battle of Passchendaele, in the Battle of Polygon Wood. He was promoted to corporal after this latter battle.

The battalion was involved in fighting on the Somme from early to mid-1918, including the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux. It was then involved in the Hundred Days Offensive which began in August.

On 1 September 1918 at Péronne, Somme, Hall rushed a machine-gun post, shooting four of the enemy and capturing nine, with two guns. Continuously in advance of the main party, he personally led assault parties, capturing many small parties of the enemy and machine-guns. On the morning of 2 September during a heavy barrage, he carried to safety a comrade who had been dangerously wounded and was in urgent need of medical attention. It was for these actions that Hall was awarded the Victoria Cross.

After the Battle of St. Quentin Canal, Hall&#x27;s battalion amalgamated with the 56th Battalion in October 1918, becoming the 54th/56th Battalion. He was promoted to sergeant with this unit before being discharged from the AIF in August 1919.

==Later life==
After the war, Hall returned to the Nyngan district and purchased his own property, Gundooee station, for farming. He married in 1927.

During the Second World War, Hall served for a time as a lieutenant in a garrison unit but returned to farming sheep and cattle once his service was no longer required. Active in community affairs, he died in the district hospital on 25 February 1978, survived by his wife and four children Helen, George, Dennis and Charles. He is buried at St Matthew&#x27;s Church in West Bogan, while his Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial, in Canberra.

<text>Patrick Carlin VC (1832 – 11 May 1895), of Belfast, County Antrim, was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==VC action==
When Carlin was approximately 26 years old, he was serving as a private in the 13th (1st Somersetshire) (Prince Albert&#x27;s Light Infantry) Regiment of Foot of the British Army during the Indian Mutiny when on 6 April 1858 at Azumgurh, India, he did the deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross:
==Further information==
He died in the Belfast Union Infirmary on 11 May 1895, and was buried in the Friar&#x27;s Bush graveyard on Stranmillis Road, Belfast; he has no memorial. The Board of Guardians Minute Book records that he died of exhaustion at the age of 60 on 11 May 1895. Although he is believed to be buried in Friar&#x27;s Bush graveyard, there is a view that his grave might be in one of the two sections of the old Donegall Road (Blackstaff Road) graveyard; now taken over by new housing and the Arellian Nursery ground.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Somerset Light Infantry Museum, Taunton, Somerset.

<text>Daniel Cambridge VC (27 March 1820 – 4 June 1882) born in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, Ireland, was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.
Cambridge was 35 years old and a Bombardier in the Royal Regiment of Artillery, British Army when he carried out the actions during the Crimean War for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 8 September 1855 at Sebastopol, Crimea, Cambridge volunteered for the spiking party on the assault on the Redan. He remained with the party after being severely wounded twice, but had refused to leave until the general retirement was ordered, and even then he repeatedly went back into the open to carry wounded men to safety. In the latter part of the day, he sprang forward to bring in another wounded man. While carrying the helpless infantryman to the safety of the trench Daniel was seen to stagger. Subsequently, Daniel was found to have been shot a third time, in his right jaw, and, incapacitated, he took no further part in the action.

==Background==
Cambridge was born in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, Ireland, on 27 June 1820 to Archibald Cambridge and Bridget, formerly Murray.

Attesting in Lisburn, County Antrim, on 20 June 1839 he gave his occupation as labourer and he is recorded as being 5 feet 8 inches tall with a fresh complexion, dark grey eyes and brown hair. He enlisted four days later as a Driver and Gunner in the 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Artillery, on 24 June 1839. He served with the 2nd Company, 4th Battalion, in Malta (1841–1847) and was then posted to Canada with the 7th Battalion in 1848.

On 28 August 1849 he married Ann Bigham, an Irish lass, whose parents were James Bigham and Ann, formerly Young, in Notre-Dame de Québec, Canada East.

On 21 November 1853 Cambridge&#x27;s posting to Canada came to an end and he and Ann, now expecting their first child, found themselves on the way to England and the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, the home of the Royal Artillery.

==Crimea==
In March 1854 Britain and France declared war on Russia, beginning the Crimean War, and Cambridge briefly reverted to the 4th Battalion in Woolwich, Kent, before transferring to the 8th Company, 11th Battalion the following month. In June he embarked with his regiment for the Crimea, passing through Scutari and Varna and disembarked on the Crimean Peninsula with the siege train on 19 September 1854.

On 8 October 1854 the besiegement of Sebastopol by sea and land began and on 17 October Sebastopol was bombarded by 126 British and French guns. Cambridge took part in the defeat of the Russians at Inkerman on 5 November and then returned to Sebastopol.

On 3 April 1855, Gunner and Driver Daniel Cambridge was promoted to Bombardier, according to his record of service preserved in WO 10/2231 at the National Archives, Kew, London.

On 9 April Sebastopol was again bombarded with 501 Allied guns, 101 of them British. Sebastopol was bombarded for the third time on 6 June 1855 and Mamelon and the Quarries were captured by the Allies. The 17 and 18 June saw the fourth bombardment of Sebastopol followed by the first assaults on the Malakov and Redan. The 17 August saw the fifth bombardment of Sebastopol with 600 Allied guns, which lasted for four days.

The sixth and final bombardment, which began on 5 September with 775 Allied guns, lasted for three days. On 8 September Cambridge accepted Capt. Davis&#x27; invitation to join the spiking party for the British assault on the Redan. The French assaulted the Malakov, which they took by surprise without loss, the Russians being at dinner. But the British were cut down by the Russian&#x27;s murderous fire from the Redan into the Quarries. As the Artillerymen&#x27;s spiking party were unable to spike the Russian guns the Gunners helped and carried as many of the wounded infantrymen to safety as they could. The despatches relating to the incident record him as being severely wounded.

Explosions were heard during the night and a small party advanced to find the Redan deserted. On the following day, 9 September 1855, the Russian army retired by a bridge of boats to the north to evacuate the south side of Sebastopol and their navy sank all their ships of war in the harbour, which signalled Russia&#x27;s capitulation.

On 29 January 1856, in a final futile act, Russian guns bombarded Sebastopol and on 1 February Russia accepted preliminary peace terms in Vienna. On 25 February the Congress of Paris convened to begin peace negotiations and the Armistice was signed on 29 February.

Cambridge returned with his regiment to Woolwich in March and on 30 March final peace was agreed, the Treaty of Paris was signed and the Congress of Paris was concluded.

On 21 April 1856 Cambridge was promoted Serjeant with 7th Company, 11th Battalion.

A copy of the original hand-written citation sent to the Adjutant-General of the Forces on 19 December 1856 can be found in a manuscript book (MS C1,171E.) in the Library of the Royal Artillery and states:

Lieutenant Colonel H. F. Strange CB commanded his company, and Captain Gronow Davis commanded the spiking party. Capt. Gronow Davis also received the Victoria Cross for his actions at the Redan on 8 September 1855.

In April 1857 Cambridge was promoted to quarter master serjeant.

The &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 23 June 1857 announced the award of the Victoria Cross to Serjeant Daniel Cambridge, and gave the citation as follows:

Shortly after Cambridge also received the Al Valore Militare, the Sardinian Military Medal of Valour, for which the citation read:

Cambridge was the twenty-second of the original sixty two medal recipients who received the Cross from Queen Victoria at the first VC Investiture in Hyde Park on 26 June 1857.

==Later life==
Later in 1857 Daniel was promoted to Master Gunner with the 8th Coastal Battery, Athlone, County Roscommon, Ireland. On 21 February 1862 Daniel was posted to Fort Tarbert, County Kerry, Ireland.

In 1861 Cambridge received the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal for 22 years of military service.

On 12 July 1865 Daniel wrote to JA Brown, author of &quot;England&#x27;s Artillerymen&quot;, from Fort Tarbert, County Kerry:

Cambridge was pensioned as a Master Gunner after completing thirty-two years&#x27; service on 27 June 1871. In that same year Cambridge was appointed to the sovereign&#x27;s bodyguard the Yeomen of the Guard.

The other medals he wore with his Victoria Cross are the British Crimean War medal (with clasps Inkerman and Sebastopol). Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, Sardinian Al Valore Militare and Turkish Crimean War medal (Sardinian Issue).

Cambridge died from the wounds received in the Crimean War on 4 June 1882 at 57 Frederick Place, Plumstead, aged 62 years, and was survived by his wife, Ann, formerly Bigham, and their children William (born in Woolwich in 1854), Mary (Athlone 1857), Agnes (Athlone 1859), Daniel (Athlone 1861), Catherine (Tarbert 1865) and Elizabeth (Tarbert 1865).

<doc id="1218066" wikidata="Q2518710" url="?curid=1218066" title="Dundry">
<text>Dundry is a village and civil parish, situated on Dundry Hill in the northern part of the Mendip Hills, between Bristol and the Chew Valley Lake, in the English county of North Somerset, previously Somerset. The parish includes the hamlets of Maiden Head and East Dundry. The parish had a 2011 population of 829.

The village lies on the route of the Monarch&#x27;s Way long-distance footpath. It is a popular destination for the people of Bristol as it is known for its panoramic views of the city.

==History==

According to Robinson the name means &#x27;The hill that is dry&#x27; from the Old English &quot;dun&quot; and &quot;dryge&quot;. An alternative derivation is from a Celtic name, meaning &quot;fort of refuge&quot;.

The parish was part of the hundred of Chew.

Dundry is notable for its stone: the yellow oolitic limestone from local quarries such as Dundry Main Road, South Quarry and the Dundry Downs (to the west of the village) is found even at Cardiff Castle, a fort originally built by the Romans to defend against Anglo-Saxon invasions. The stone was much used in medieval Bristol: an outstanding example being St Mary Redcliffe, an Anglican church in central Bristol. Dundry stone was extensively important in Ireland after the 12th century Anglo-Norman invasions, being used to build Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, amongst many other prominent buildings. A large cube of stone (approximately 1.5m each edge) still stands in the churchyard: the cube is much considered to be an early advertisement for Dundry stone.

The neighbouring village of Chew Magna has in its graveyard an early 19th-century limestone round-topped stone which bears the inscription to William Fowler &quot;shot by an Highwayman on Dundry Hill 14 June 1814 aged 32 years&quot;.

===Second World War===
Being so close to Bristol, Dundry caught many of the 77 air raids (mostly in 1940 and 1941) for which Bristol had:
* 919 tons of high-explosive bombs and myriad incendiary bombs
* 1299 persons killed
* 81,830 houses destroyed.

Many bombs and anti-aircraft shells landed in Dundry. The diary of Doris Ogilvie of East Dundry records that:
* 24 November 1940: &quot;Christening of William Duncan&quot; [born in East Dundry] &quot;at St James Presbyterian Church, The Barton, Bristol. ... Church completely burned out that night. ... This evening a tremendous air raid began about 6pm – ended about midnight – Bristol was demolished in parts and fires started over a tremendously wide area&quot; [148 long-range bombers of Luftwaffe 3]. &quot;Glare in the sky reflected on hillside opposite the house&quot; [The Dingle, now Dingle House]&quot;. Shrapnel fell around the house, but vibration from bombs felt very little here – nearest ones fell North Wick, top fields near Knights&quot; [Walnut Farm]&quot;, Bishopsworth etc. Next day roads partly closed for time bombs. L in Bristol and returned with tales of devastation and the amazingly good organisation and firefighting services.&quot;&quot;
* 27 November 1940: &quot;The Dundry Parish Hall – 86 people sheltered this week who were driven out of Bristol from demolished houses, flooding etc.&quot;
* Night of 3 January 1941 &quot;Lawrie &quot;[her husband]&quot; on&quot; Home Guard&quot; duty at the wireless station &quot;[on Dundry Downs]&quot; all night. This night there was a bad raid on Bristol. A good many bombs dropped around Russell&#x27;s and Knight&#x27;s farms&quot; [North Hill Farm and Walnut Farm, both in East Dundry]&quot;: they sound like flocks of starlings coming down. Bad damage done to Bristol. One fell in Russell&#x27;s bull pen and exploded.&quot;
* On 17 January &quot;Preparations for incendiary bombs going on. Small bags of sand and buckets of water to be at every corner of the house — most awkward, but adds a spice to life.&quot;
* On 2 February &quot;Lawrie continues his &quot;[air-raid]&quot; trenching in the kitchen garden&quot;
* On 12 April &quot;Discovered a neat shell cap buried in the lawn, so now we have one like everyone else. This night Lawrie was on fire watch duty from 1 a.m. on. I was alone with D who slept in a basket under the kitchen table. The decoy &quot;[see Chew Magna]&quot; over the hill, a mile away, caught HEs&quot; [high explosive bombs] &quot;that night: we only felt vibrations.&quot;
* Summer 1942 &quot;All this summer has been unnaturally quiet. Only two bad nights when Bath was blasted and set on fire in May.&quot;
* Sunday 15 November 1942 &quot;Church bells were rung everywhere for the first time to celebrate Egypt victory.&quot;

===Dundry Home Guard===
During World War II members of the Dundry Home Guard had many draughty nights on the top of the church, on Maes Knoll, and (on Dundry Down) at the wireless complex watching out for air raids and possible troop landings by parachute and glider. Captain Knight of Walnut Farm, East Dundry served in the First World War and was in charge of the Dundry Home Guard. Fire watchers turned out to watch for fires whenever there were bombing raids.

500 metres south of Rackledown Farm in East Dundry, there was a Civil Bombing QL decoy site, C1C. It was built as part of the &#x27;C-series&#x27; of civil decoys. This QL site operated from the same operations room as a permanent Starfish site SF1B that was located 800 metres further south. These sites featured displays of muted lights to appear like urban areas during poor blackouts. Bonfires were also lit to resemble buildings under attack with the intention of tricking the bombers to release the bomb load before arriving over Bristol. 
In 1941, there was a Home Guard exercise for Dundry and neighbouring villages including Winford, Bishopsworth, Leigh Woods and Norton Malreward.

===1968 storm===
On 10 July 1968 a storm deluged the parish and neighbouring areas— of rain was measured in Chew Stoke,
and local streams such as Winford Brook were swollen by rain running off the slopes of Dundry Hill.

==Governance==
The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council.

The parish is in the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. This act established a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service.

North Somerset&#x27;s area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Long Ashton Rural District.

The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the North Somerset constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, currently Liam Fox of the Conservative Party. It was also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d&#x27;Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.

==Religious sites==

The Church of St Michael at Dundry is a prominent feature in its hill-top position with its tower visible for many miles around. The four-stage tower was erected by the Society of Merchant Venturers of Bristol as a landmark and is widely visible.

==Transport==
In the 1940s and 1950s the Ball family of Dundry ran the &quot;Dundry Pioneer&quot; bus service from Dundry Chapel via Dundry Church and the Hairpin Corner into Prince Street in central Bristol with Bedford buses. After the Dundry Pioneer, Bristol buses route 80, renumbered 373 in 1983, served Dundry.

<doc id="1218070" wikidata="Q1538028" url="?curid=1218070" title="1980 World Series">
<text>The 1980 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) season. The 77th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the National League (NL) champion Philadelphia Phillies and the American League (AL) champion Kansas City Royals. The Phillies defeated the Royals in six games to secure the team&#x27;s first World Series championship in franchise history. Third baseman Mike Schmidt was named the World Series MVP. 

The series concluded with Game 6 in Philadelphia, which ended with closer Tug McGraw striking out Willie Wilson at 11:29 pm EDT on Tuesday, October 21. Wilson set a World Series record by striking out 12 times in the six-game set (after 230 hits (and 81 strikeouts) in the regular season). Game 6 is also significant because it stands as the most-watched game in World Series history, with a television audience of 54.9 million viewers.

The Kansas City Royals became the second expansion team, and the first from the American League, to appear in the World Series. The AL had to wait until before one of their expansion teams—the Royals—won a World Series.

This was the first of six World Series played entirely on artificial turf (1985, , , , 2023).

This was also the first World Series since 1920, and the most recent, in which neither team had a previous World Series title. As of 2024, this can only happen again if the Tampa Bay Rays or Seattle Mariners face the Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres, or Colorado Rockies in a future series.

With their victory, the Phillies became the final team out of the original 16 MLB teams to win a World Series. However, a Philadelphia team had won a World Series before, the last being the Athletics in , exactly a half-century earlier; in a twist of fate, the Athletics played 13 years in Kansas City (1955–1967) before relocating to Oakland.

==Background==

The Philadelphia Phillies won the National League East division by one game over the Montreal Expos, then defeated the Houston Astros three games to two to win the National League Championship Series. The Kansas City Royals won the American League West division by 14 games over the Oakland Athletics, then swept the New York Yankees for the American League pennant

Two first-year managers, Dallas Green of the Phillies and Jim Frey of the Royals, fought to win a first World Championship for their respective clubs. This was the first appearance for the Phillies since losing to the New York Yankees in and just their third overall, having lost also to the Boston Red Sox in .

The Royals entered the league as an expansion team in 1969. They had early success under the leadership of Whitey Herzog, winning their division from 1976 to 1978, but lost each year to the New York Yankees in the American League Championship Series (ALCS), finally exacting revenge with a sweep of the Yankees in 1980. The Phillies had a strikingly similar run entering this Series, as they were also divisional winners from 1976 to 1978, but lost three straight NLCS: to the Cincinnati Reds in 1976, and the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1977 and 1978. In 1980, they finally triumphed, rallying on the road to eliminate the Houston Astros.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
The Philadelphia Phillies entered the 1980 season as the only original National League team not to have won a World Series. Established in 1883, the franchise had gone 97 years without a championship. They reached the postseason five times in those 97 years, winning pennants in 1915 and 1950, along with three straight NL East titles in 1976, 1977 and 1978.

The Phillies&#x27; 1980 squad included the NL Most Valuable Player, third-baseman Mike Schmidt (48 HR, 121 RBI, .286 BA), and Cy Young Award winner, lefty Steve Carlton (24–9, 2.34 ERA). This mostly veteran club finished between first and third in almost all offensive categories in the National League. Thirty-nine-year-old Pete Rose led the club in hits (185) and doubles (42), while center fielder Garry Maddox and utility outfielder Lonnie Smith combined for 68 steals. The pitching staff was led by Carlton and 17-game-winner Dick Ruthven. In the bullpen was the screwballer Tug McGraw, who was making his third trip to the Series.

===Kansas City Royals===
The Kansas City Royals were a team that was formed by pharmaceutical executive Ewing Kauffman as a result of the move of the Athletics to Oakland, and began play in 1969. They quickly became competitive, achieving a winning record in their third season with an 85–76 win–loss record. By 1976, the young team was becoming the dominant force in the American League West, winning 90 or more games in four consecutive seasons from 1975 to 1978. Unfortunately for the Royals, the could not get over the hump of the New York Yankees, losing three straight ALCS to New York from 1976 to 1978.

The 1980 Royals had a Most Valuable Player of their own in the indomitable superstar, third-baseman George Brett, who flirted with the sacred .400 mark all summer with an average above .400 as late as September 19, before settling for a .390 batting average, with 24 homers and 118 RBI in 117 games. The unquestioned heart and soul of the Royals was surrounded by a solid corps of veterans: Amos Otis, super-designated-hitter Hal McRae, solid second-baseman Frank White, and switch-hitting leadoff man Willie Wilson, who finished the season with 230 hits and 79 stolen bases. Six KC pitchers had ten or more wins, led by 20-game-winner Dennis Leonard (20–11, 3.79) and left-hander Larry Gura (18–10, 2.95). Submariner closer Dan Quisenberry won 12 games out of the bullpen and accumulated 33 saves, tied for best in the American League with Rich Gossage. On their way to the World Series in 1980, the Royals would finally beat the New York Yankees in the ALCS.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===

Phillies&#x27; starter Bob Walk became the third rookie to start the first game of a World Series, the first since Joe Black of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952. The Royals jumped on him early with a pair of two-run home runs: in the second, Amos Otis lifted one to left after a leadoff walk of Darrell Porter, and Willie Aikens went over right-center with two outs in the third, following Hal McRae&#x27;s single up the middle and a called strikeout of George Brett. The K.C. threat continued until Porter was thrown out at home. In their half of the third, the Phils rallied off Dennis Leonard. Shortstop Larry Bowa singled with one out, stole second and scored on catcher Bob Boone&#x27;s double. Lonnie Smith&#x27;s RBI single then cut the Royals&#x27; lead to 4–2, but Smith was caught in a rundown heading back to first, which allowed Boone to score. With the bases clear and two outs, Pete Rose was hit on the calf and Mike Schmidt walked on five pitches. Bake McBride launched a 1-1 pitch to right-center for a three-run home run and the Phillies led 5–4; designated hitter Greg Luzinski fanned for the third out.

In the fourth inning, Manny Trillo chopped a high bouncer over Leonard for an infield single, advanced to second on an errant pickoff throw, and to third as Bowa bounced to second for the second out. Ninth in the order and with a 3-1 count, Boone doubled again to score Trillo and knock Leonard out of the game. Reliever Renie Martin retired Smith on a fly out to right.

After loading the bases in the fifth with one out on a single, hit-by-pitch, and walk off Martin, Garry Maddox&#x27;s sacrifice fly to left on full count scored Schmidt for a 7–4 lead. Trillo popped out to first to end the threat. Hitless Brett opened the eighth with a double to left-center off of Walk, and went to third on a wild pitch to Aikens, who hit another two-run home run to right-center to cut the lead to one. Closer Tug McGraw entered with the bases clear and no outs, faced the minimum in the final two innings for a 7–6 Phillies victory.

Prior to this victory, the Phillies had not won a World Series game since Game 1 in against the Boston Red Sox, when Grover Cleveland Alexander had pitched a shutout.

===Game 2===

Game 2 was a pitchers&#x27; duel between left-handers Larry Gura and Steve Carlton. After a one-out single and subsequent double in the fifth, Manny Trillo&#x27;s sacrifice fly and Larry Bowa&#x27;s RBI single put the Phillies up 2–0. The Royals cut it to 2–1 when Amos Otis scored from second on Trillo&#x27;s error on Willie Aikens&#x27;s ground ball in the sixth. Carlton looked in control until, acting on a complaint from Kansas City manager Jim Frey that he was using a foreign substance on the ball; the umpires made Carlton wash his hands.

In the seventh, Carlton loaded the bases on three walks, the last intentional, and Otis ripped a double into the left-field corner to drive in two, then John Wathan&#x27;s sacrifice fly to center extended the Royals&#x27; lead to 4–2; questionably, Otis was caught in a rundown after also tagging up from second; Rose cut the ball and threw to Schmidt, who tagged him halfway back to second to end the inning.

The Phillies rallied in the eighth inning off closer Dan Quisenberry; after a leadoff walk to Bob Boone, pinch hitter Del Unser&#x27;s RBI double to left-center cut the Royals&#x27; lead to 4–3. A groundout to first by Pete Rose advanced Unser to third, and a high-chopper single by Bake McBride over the drawn-in infield tied the score. Mike Schmidt drove in McBride to take the lead with a double off the wall in right-center, then scored on Keith Moreland&#x27;s single up the middle to lead by two. Pinch hitter Greg Gross grounded into a 6-4-3 double play.

Ron Reed took over for Carlton in the ninth, struck out two, and held the Royals scoreless for the save as Philadelphia went up 2–0 heading to Kansas City.

===Game 3===
K.C. got back in the series with an extra inning victory in Game 3. George Brett, having returned from minor surgery after Game 2, began the scoring with a first-inning solo home run into the right-field stands off Philadelphia starter Dick Ruthven. The Phillies loaded the bases in the second off the Royals&#x27; Rich Gale with one out on two singles and a walk, but only scored once on Lonnie Smith&#x27;s groundout. In the fourth, K.C.&#x27;s Willie Aikens tripled with one out and scored on Hal McRae&#x27;s single, but Mike Schmidt&#x27;s home run in the fifth again tied the game and knocked Gale out of the game. Amos Otis gave the Royals a 3–2 lead in the seventh with a home run, but Pete Rose&#x27;s RBI single with two on in the eighth off Renie Martin (who had relieved Gale) again tied the game. Ruthven pitched nine innings and was relieved in the tenth. The game headed into extra innings and in the bottom of the tenth, Willie Aikens drove in Willie Wilson with a single to left-center off Tug McGraw to give Kansas City a 4–3 win.

===Game 4===
A beautiful Saturday afternoon was the setting for Game 4. The Royals jumped all over Phillies starter Larry Christenson in the bottom of the first. Willie Wilson singled and advanced to third base on an errant pickoff attempt, George Brett tripled him in, and Willie Aikens smashed his third home run of the series. The onslaught continued when Amos Otis doubled in Hal McRae, who had also doubled, to give the Royals a 4–0 lead right out of the gate. Christenson would only last of an inning before being relieved. After the Phillies scored a run in the second on Larry Bowa&#x27;s RBI single off Dennis Leonard, Aikens hit his second home run of the game in the bottom half and became the first player in World Series history to have a pair of two-home run games. The Phillies cut away at the Royals&#x27; lead on sacrifice flies by Bob Boone off Leonard in the seventh and Mike Schmidt off Dan Quisenberry in the eighth (the run charged to Leonard), but fell short as Leonard held them in check and Dan Quisenberry finished the game to help Leonard atone for his Game 1 loss. The Royals won 5–3 to tie the series. Despite the Royals victory, Game 4 is best remembered for Dickie Noles&#x27; fourth-inning brushback pitch under Brett&#x27;s chin that ultimately prompted the umpires to issue warnings to each team. Brett told &quot;Baseball Digest&quot; in March 1998 that he had &quot;no idea if that [brushback pitch by Noles] turned the Series around. All I know is we lost.&quot; Mike Schmidt, in his book &quot;Clearing The Bases&quot;, called it &quot;the greatest brushback in World Series history.&quot; Aikens later said that &quot;he&quot; had been expecting it to happen to him, in retaliation for his two home runs.

===Game 5===

Played in the afternoon sun and shadows, pivotal Game Five was scoreless through the first three innings. In top of the fourth, Pete Rose laced a line drive off starter Larry Gura, but was thrown out by second baseman Frank White. Bake McBride dragged a bunt to Gura, but first baseman Willie Aikens&#x27; foot was not on the base. On a 2–2 count, Mike Schmidt homered to center to put the Phillies up 2–0. Greg Luzinski grounded out to third and Keith Moreland popped out to third.

In the bottom of the fifth, U L Washington singled to center, and Willie Wilson hit a grounder between shortstop and third that was an infield single. After a sacrifice bunt from White that nearly went for a hit, George Brett&#x27;s RBI groundout to second off Marty Bystrom cut the Phillies&#x27; lead to 2–1. Aikens walked, but Hal McRae flew out to the base of the right field foul pole to strand Wilson at third.

In the Kansas City sixth, red-hot Amos Otis tied the game with a leadoff home run to left. After solid singles by Clint Hurdle and Darrell Porter put runners on the corners with no outs, Bystrom was relieved by Ron Reed, who allowed a sacrifice fly to left by Washington which put the Royals up 3–2. Wilson doubled to right, but Porter was thrown out at home by Manny Trillo&#x27;s relay, and White fouled out to third.

In the top of the seventh, Schmidt flew out to right, and Luzinski walked. Smith came in to run and Moreland singled, ending Gura&#x27;s day. Closer Dan Quisenberry induced fielder&#x27;s choice groundouts by Maddox and Trillo to end the threat. In the bottom half against closer Tug McGraw, Brett and Aikens struck out swinging, then McRae doubled to left. Otis was intentionally walked, and José Cardenal batted for Hurdle, but flew out to center on the first pitch.

In the Phillies&#x27; eighth, Bowa nearly beat out a grounder out to second, then Bob Boone reached on a low throw by Brett and continued to second. Rose grounded out to second and Boone went to third but was stranded when McBride also grounded to second. In the bottom half, Porter grounded out to second, Washington fanned, and Wilson chopped a slow grounder towards third, but was thrown out by McGraw.

Down by a run, Schmidt led off the ninth inning with an infield single off of drawn-in third baseman Brett&#x27;s glove. Pinch hitter Del Unser drove him home from first with a double that bounced over Aikens&#x27; glove and into the right-field corner. After a bunt down the first baseline by Moreland moved Unser to third, Garry Maddox grounded to third for the second out. On an 0–2 count, Trillo drove in the go-ahead run with a line shot that ricocheted off Quisenberry for an infield hit, almost thrown out by Brett. Bowa grounded to shortstop on a high hopper to end the inning.

In the bottom of the ninth, White led off with a walk, Brett was caught looking, Aikens walked on four pitches, and was lifted for pinch-runner Onix Concepción. McRae hit a fly well down the line that was just foul, then grounded to shortstop for a fielder&#x27;s choice. Otis walked on four pitches to load the bases, but McGraw silenced the crowd by striking out Cardenal with an inside fastball on a 1–2 count to end the game.

===Game 6===

With a chance to close out the series at home in Game 6, Steve Carlton was the starter for Philadelphia. In the bottom of the third, Bob Boone walked, then was safe at second on Lonnie Smith&#x27;s ground ball, as shortstop U L Washington was past the base when he caught the ball from the second baseman Frank White. Pete Rose then bunted for a single down the third-base line to load the bases. Mike Schmidt&#x27;s single to right-center scored two, which ended Royals&#x27; starter Rich Gale&#x27;s night. Renie Martin entered with runners at the corners and no outs and retired the side: Bake McBride fouled out, Greg Luzinski hit a soft liner to third, and Garry Maddox flew to right.

In the fifth, Smith hustled to turn a routine single to left-center into a double, advanced to third on Rose&#x27;s fly to left-center, and Schmidt walked on a full count. Lefthander Paul Splittorff relieved Martin, and McBride&#x27;s slow groundout to shortstop moved up both runners to put the Phillies up 3–0. Luzinski also grounded out to shortstop. Next inning, Maddox singled to left, but Manny Trillo grounded back to Splittorff for 1-6-3 double play. On a 2–2 count, Larry Bowa doubled to left and scored on Boone&#x27;s single to center, making it 4–0 Phillies. Smith flew out to right-center. 

John Wathan walked on eight pitches to lead off the eighth and José Cardenal singled to left to end Carlton&#x27;s night, relieved by closer Tug McGraw. White fouled out to first, Willie Wilson walked on five pitches to load the bases. Washington flew to left-center for a sacrifice fly, George Brett got an infield hit to reload the bases, but Hal McRae grounded out to second. In the bottom half, closer Dan Quisenberry set the Phillies down in order (Maddox, Trillo, Bowa).

In the top of the ninth, the City of Philadelphia deployed a police force ready to take the field with some officers mounted on horses and some armed with K-9 dogs. This action proved effective preventing fans from storming onto the field when the game ended. Royals leadoff batter Amos Otis was caught looking on a breaker, Willie Aikens drew a walk on a full count, and Onix Concepción came in to run. Wathan singled to right, and Cardenal singled to center to load the bases. White fouled out on the first pitch, bobbled by Boone, and caught by Rose in front of the Phillies&#x27; dugout. Wilson fell behind on an 0–2 count, took a pitch slightly high, then fanned on a fastball to end the Series.

It was the 12th time Wilson struck out in this Series, setting a new World Series record. The previous mark of 11 had been held jointly by Eddie Mathews and Wayne Garrett in and , respectively. It stood until , when Ryan Howard struck out 13 times, ironically on a Phillies team which lost to the New York Yankees. Boone&#x27;s knees were so sore by the end of the World Series that he could barely make it to the mound after the final out was recorded.

When the World Series began in , the National and American Leagues each had eight teams. With their victory in 1980, the Phillies became the last of the &quot;Original Sixteen&quot; franchises to win a Series (although the St. Louis Browns never won a Series in St. Louis, waiting until , twelve years after becoming the Baltimore Orioles).

While third baseman Schmidt was the official MVP of the 1980 World Series, the Babe Ruth Award (another World Series MVP) was given to closer McGraw.

Despite the loss, Royals first baseman Willie Aikens had a phenomenal World Series, batting .400 with 8 hits (out of 20 times at bat), 8 RBIs and 4 homeruns.

==Composite box==
1980 World Series (4–2): Philadelphia Phillies (N.L.) over Kansas City Royals (A.L.)
==Broadcasting==
NBC broadcast the Series on television, with play-by-play announcer Joe Garagiola, color commentators Tony Kubek and Tom Seaver, and field reporter Merle Harmon. Bryant Gumbel anchored the pre- and post-game shows, while former pitching great Bob Gibson and umpire Ron Luciano also contributed to NBC&#x27;s coverage. This would be the final World Series where Garagiola was the sole play-by-play announcer on TV. The next time NBC broadcast a World Series, Garagiola split play-by-play duties with Dick Enberg. After that series, he was demoted to color commentator to make room for Vin Scully.

Independent station WPHL-TV in Philadelphia, the Phillies&#x27; television rights holder, simulcast NBC&#x27;s broadcast to its local viewers. Phillies broadcasters Richie Ashburn, Harry Kalas, Tim McCarver, and Andy Musser hosted a locally produced pregame show prior to each of the six games.

CBS Radio also carried the Series nationally, with Vin Scully handling the play-by-play and Sparky Anderson the color commentary. Win Elliot anchored the pre-and post-game shows for the network.

At this time, CBS Radio held total broadcast exclusivity for the World Series, including in each team&#x27;s market. Thousands of Phillies fans were outraged that they could not hear their local team announcers call the games. They deluged the team, the networks, and the Commissioner&#x27;s office with angry letters and petitions. The following year, Major League Baseball changed its broadcast contract to allow the flagship radio stations for participating World Series teams to produce and air their own local Series broadcasts, beginning in . The CBS Radio feed could potentially be heard in those markets on another station which held CBS&#x27;s rights. WPHL did a &quot;re-creation&quot; of the game with Harry Kalas, Richie Ashburn, and Andy Musser using the NBC video, which aired in November along with the National League East division clinching game in Montreal and three games from the NLCS against Houston. When the Phillies next won a World Series, in , Kalas was able to make the call of the final out.

This Series is tied with the 1978 World Series for the highest overall television ratings to date, with the six games averaging a Nielsen rating of 32.8 and a share of 56.

==Aftermath==
Minutes after the final out, Pennsylvania Governor Dick Thornburgh issued a proclamation declaring the next day &quot;Philadelphia Phillies Day&quot; in the state. That day, a parade down Broad Street celebrated the Phillies win. About half a million attended the parade, the first ticker-tape parade down Broad Street since the Flyers won the Stanley Cup in 1975, as it made its way to John F. Kennedy Stadium. Another 800,000 gathered around the stadium. The parade was part of a day of statewide celebrations throughout Pennsylvania, per Thornburgh&#x27;s proclamation.

In 1980, all four of Philadelphia&#x27;s major professional sports teams played for the championship of their respective sports, but only the Phillies were victorious. The Sixers lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in mid-May, eight days later the Flyers lost to the New York Islanders, and the Eagles would lose to the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl XV in January 1981. In conjunction with championships won by two teams from Pittsburgh (the Pirates won the World Series a year before, and the Steelers won Super Bowls XIII and XIV), the state of Pennsylvania as a whole had three title teams in a span of two years.

Soon after the World Series, members of both teams played for a week on &quot;Family Feud&quot; with host Richard Dawson. The week of shows was billed as a World Series Rematch Week. The Royals won three out of the five games played, with all the money going to charity.

The 1980 World Series was the first of numerous World Series that journeyman outfielder Lonnie Smith (then with the Phillies) participated in. He was also a part of the 1982 World Series (as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals), 1985 World Series (as a member of the Kansas City Royals), and the and 1992 World Series as a member of the Atlanta Braves. The two Braves seasons were the only years in which he played for the losing team in the Series.

Another playoff matchup involving Philadelphia and Kansas City would not take place until Super Bowl LVII in the NFL season, pitting the Chiefs against the Eagles. With no Kansas City-based team in either the NBA or the NHL (both leagues previously had a Kansas City-based team in the Kings and Scouts respectively), and with the cities&#x27; other respective sports teams also being in opposing conferences, the only currently possible Philadelphia vs. Kansas City playoff matchups would be for the respective league championships, these being either the World Series, the Super Bowl, or in the case of Sporting Kansas City against the Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer, the MLS Cup.

<text>Gabar Singh Negi VC (21 April 189510 March 1915) was a soldier in the British Indian Army during the First World War and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Gabar Singh Negi, was born on 21 April 1895 at Manjaur village near Chamba, Tehri Garhwal State (present-day Tehri Garhwal district, Uttarakhand). The area is in the Himalayas and was part of the original Garhwal Kingdom, Uttarakhand. He joined the 2nd Battalion of the Garhwal Rifles, a regiment of the British Indian Army, in October 1913; the personnel of the regiment were mainly from the Garhwali people of Uttarakhand

==First World War==
On the outbreak of the First World War, the 39th Garhwal Rifles was among the regiments selected for the Indian Expeditionary Force A, destined for the Western Front in France. By October 1914, the regiment, as part of the 7th (Meerut) Division, was in the frontlines during the First Battle of Ypres and later in the Pas-de-Calais sector where it would remain until going into reserve at the end of that year.

In March 1915, the 7th Division was selected to be involved in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, which called for an assault on the German lines at Neuve Chapelle. The 7th Division was to help force a gap for the Cavalry Corps to exploit. On 10 March 1915, during the battle, Negi&#x27;s 2nd Battalion was attacking to the southwest of Neuve Chappelle; an artillery barrage that preceded the attack was not effective and the German trenches were well defended. Parties with bombs had to clear the trenches; one such party included Negi. When the commander of his party was killed, he took over, leading from the front as the party took control of the German trenches. He was later killed. His actions on 10 March led to him being posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for his VC read as follows: 

Negi has no known grave; his name is recorded on the Neuve-Chapelle Memorial, as Gabar Sing Negi. His name was one of those included on the dome of the Memorial Gates in London, unveiled in 2002.

==Victoria Cross==
Negi&#x27;s VC was sent to the India Office to be forwarded to his next of kin, Satoori Devi, his wife. The VC was acquired by his regiment, which arranged for a replica to be sent to Devi. A letter of condolences from Queen Mary was also sent to Devi. The medal was a source of pride for Negi&#x27;s widow, who would wear it until her death in 1981.

==Legacy==
Descendants of Negi have organised the Gabar Singh Negi Fair annually at Chamba in his memory, held every 20 or 21 April since 1925, depending on the Hindu calendar. His regiment, the Garhwal Rifles, have maintained a presence since 1971. A recruitment rally, stalls and army bands provide entertainment and many villagers, particularly the youths, attend the fair because of the drawcard of the recruitment rally.
