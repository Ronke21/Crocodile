<text>PepsiCo, Inc. is an American multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation headquartered in Harrison, New York, in the hamlet of Purchase. PepsiCo&#x27;s business encompasses all aspects of the food and beverage market. It oversees the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of its products. PepsiCo was formed in 1965 with the merger of the Pepsi-Cola Company and Frito-Lay, Inc., PepsiCo has since expanded from its namesake product Pepsi Cola to an immensely diversified range of food and beverage brands. The largest and most recent acquisition was Pioneer Foods in 2020 for US$1.7 billion and prior to it was buying the Quaker Oats Company in 2001, which added the Gatorade brand to the Pepsi portfolio and Tropicana Products in 1998.

As of January 2021, the company possesses 23 brands that have over 1 billion $ each in sales annually. PepsiCo has operations all around the world and its products were distributed across more than 200 countries and territories, resulting in annual net revenues of over US$70 billion. PepsiCo is the second-largest food and beverage business in the world based on net revenue, profit, and market capitalization, behind Nestlé. In 2023, the company&#x27;s seat in Forbes Global 2000 was 82. PepsiCo&#x27;s flagship product, Pepsi Cola, has been engaged in a rivalry for generations with Coca-Cola; it is commonly referred to as the cola wars. Although Coca-Cola outsells Pepsi Cola in the United States, PepsiCo within the North American market is the largest food and beverage company by net revenue. Ramon Laguarta has been the chief executive of PepsiCo since 2018. The company&#x27;s beverage distribution and bottling is conducted by PepsiCo as well as by licensed bottlers in certain regions.

==History==

===Origins===
The soft drink Pepsi was developed by Caleb Bradham, a pharmacist and businessman from Duplin County, North Carolina. He coined the name &quot;Pepsi-Cola&quot; in 1898 marketing the drink from his pharmacy in New Bern, North Carolina. As his drink gained popularity Bradham founded the Pepsi-Cola Company in 1902 and registered a patent for his recipe in 1903. The company was incorporated under Delaware General Corporation Law in 1919. Bradham&#x27;s company experienced years of success leading up to World War I. However, sugar rationing during the war and a volatile sugar market in the war&#x27;s aftermath damaged the company&#x27;s financial health to such a degree that in 1923, Bradham declared bankruptcy and returned to running pharmacies in North Carolina.

On June 8, 1923, the company trademark and secret recipe were purchased by Craven Holding Corporation. In 1931, Roy Megargel, a Wall Street broker, purchased the Pepsi trademark, business, and goodwill from Craven Holding in association with Charles Guth. Guth was also the president of Loft, Incorporated, a leading candy manufacturer based in Long Island City, New York. Loft ran a network with 115 stores across the Mid Atlantic at the time of Guth&#x27;s acquisition. Guth used Loft&#x27;s labs and chemists to reformulate the Pepsi syrup recipe, and he used his position as president of the company to replace Coca-Cola with Pepsi Cola at Loft&#x27;s shops and restaurants. Guth also used Loft resources to promote Pepsi, and moved the soda company to a location close to Loft&#x27;s own facilities in New York City.

In 1935, the shareholders of Loft sued Guth for his 91% stake of Pepsi-Cola Company in the landmark case &quot;Guth v. Loft Inc.&quot; Loft won the suit and on May 29, 1941, formally absorbed Pepsi into Loft, which was then re-branded as Pepsi-Cola Company that same year. Loft restaurants and candy stores were spun off at this time.

In the early 1960s, Pepsi-Cola&#x27;s product lines expanded with the creation of Diet Pepsi and purchase of Mountain Dew. In 1965, the Pepsi-Cola Company merged with Frito-Lay, Inc. to become PepsiCo, Inc. At the time of its foundation, PepsiCo was incorporated under Delaware General Corporation Law and headquartered in Manhattan, New York. The company&#x27;s headquarters were relocated to the present location of Purchase, New York in 1970, and in 1986 PepsiCo was reincorporated in the state of North Carolina.
 After 39 years trading on the New York Stock Exchange, PepsiCo moved its shares to Nasdaq on December 20, 2017.

===Acquisitions and divestments===
Between the late-1970s and the mid-1990s, PepsiCo expanded via acquisition of businesses outside of its core focus of packaged food and beverage brands; however it exited these non-core business lines largely in 1997, selling some, and spinning off others into a new company named Tricon Global Restaurants, which later became known as Yum! Brands, Inc. PepsiCo also previously owned several other brands that it later sold so it could focus on its primary snack food and beverage lines, according to investment analysts reporting on the divestments in 1997. Brands formerly owned by PepsiCo include: Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, KFC, Hot &#x27;n Now, East Side Mario&#x27;s, D&#x27;Angelo Sandwich Shops, Chevys Fresh Mex, California Pizza Kitchen, Stolichnaya (via licensed agreement), Wilson Sporting Goods, and North American Van Lines.

The divestments concluding in 1997 were followed by multiple large-scale acquisitions, as PepsiCo began to extend its operations beyond soft drinks and snack foods into other lines of foods and beverages. PepsiCo purchased the orange juice company Tropicana Products in 1998, and merged with Quaker Oats Company in 2001, adding with it the Gatorade sports drink line and other Quaker Oats brands such as Chewy Granola Bars and Aunt Jemima, among others.

In August 2009, PepsiCo made a US$7 billion offer to acquire the two largest bottlers of its products in North America: Pepsi Bottling Group and PepsiAmericas. In 2010 this acquisition was completed, resulting in the formation of a new wholly owned subsidiary of PepsiCo, &quot;Pepsi Beverages Company&quot;.

In February 2011, the company made its largest international acquisition by purchasing a two-thirds (majority) stake in Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods, a Russian food company that produces milk, yogurt, fruit juices, and dairy products. When it acquired the remaining 23% stake of Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods in October 2011, PepsiCo became the largest food and beverage company in Russia.

In July 2012, PepsiCo announced a joint venture with the Theo Muller Group which was named Muller Quaker Dairy. This marked PepsiCo&#x27;s first entry into the dairy space in the U.S. The joint venture was dissolved in December 2015.

On May 25, 2018, PepsiCo announced that it would acquire fruit and veggie snack maker Bare Foods. It started quarter-owning allMotti in late November 2018 and was PepsiCo&#x27;s first owned Tech and Computer Service company.

On August 20, 2018, PepsiCo announced that it had entered into agreement to acquire SodaStream. The purchase was completed in December 2018 as part of a strategic plan to steer Pepsi toward offering healthier products.

In 2019, PepsiCo sued four small farmers in India US$142,000 each for growing a type of potato it says it owns. Pepsi said they would end the suit if the farmers grew potatoes for them. A number of Farmers&#x27; associations are requesting that the government get involved in the case stating that Pepsi is attempting to intimidate people. After pressure from the public as well as state and national governments, PepsiCo withdrew the lawsuit on May 2, 2019.

On October 3, 2019, PepsiCo announced that they would leave Indonesia after terminating their partnership with local distributor PT Anugerah Indofood Barokah Makmur (AIBM). Both companies stopped production of PepsiCo products on October 10. This has resulted in KFC and Pizza Hut chains in the country to switch to Coca-Cola products.

On December 2, 2019, PepsiCo acquired the snacks brand, BFY Brands, who were then folded into the Frito-Lay division.

In March 2020, PepsiCo announced that it had entered into agreement to acquire Rockstar Energy for US$3.85 billion.

In January 2021, as a plan to fight global warming, PepsiCo announced that it is planning to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, knowing that it had already started generating about 57 million metric tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions globally in 2019.

On August 3, 2021, PepsiCo announced that they have agreed to sell a majority stake in Tropicana, Naked and other North American juice brands to French private equity firm PAI Partners for US$3.3 billion, so that the company can concentrate on its healthy snack food business. Pepsi will hold a 39% stake in the joint venture as well as having exclusive rights to the brand in the USA.

In August 2022, PepsiCo acquired a $550 million stake in the energy drink maker Celsius.

On October 1, 2024, PepsiCo announced that it would acquire Siete Foods for $1.2 billion. The acquisition was completed on January 17, 2025.
==Business divisions==
The structure of PepsiCo&#x27;s global operations has shifted multiple times in its history as a result of international expansion, and as of December 2021 it is separated into seven main divisions: PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), Latin America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, South Asia (AMESA) and Asia Pacific, Australia/New Zealand, China (APAC). As of 2015, 73 percent of the company&#x27;s net revenues came from North and South America; 17 percent from Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa; and 10 percent from Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. PepsiCo and its combined subsidiaries employed approximately 263,000 people worldwide as of December 2015.

===PepsiCo Beverages North America===
This division contributed 35 percent of PepsiCo&#x27;s net revenue as of 2015, and involves the manufacture (and in some cases licensing), marketing and sales of both carbonated and non-carbonated beverages in North America. The main brands distributed under this division include Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, 7 Up (outside the U.S.), Tropicana Pure Premium orange juice, Starry, SoBe Lifewater, Tropicana juice drinks, AMP Energy, Naked Juice, and Izze. Aquafina, the company&#x27;s bottled water brand, is also marketed and licensed through North America Beverages. In 2015, PepsiCo also introduced Stubborn Soda, a line of carbonated beverages without high fructose corn syrup.

PepsiCo also has formed partnerships with several beverage brands it does not own, in order to distribute or market them with its own brands. As of 2010, its partnerships include: Starbucks (Frappuccino, DoubleShot, and Iced Coffee), LUnilever&#x27;s Lipton licensed brands (Lipton Brisk and Lipton Iced Tea), and Dole (licensed juices and drinks).

===Frito-Lay North America===
&quot;Frito-Lay North America&quot;, the result of a merger in 1961 between the Frito Company and the H.W. Lay Company, produces the top-selling line of snack foods in the U.S. Its main brands in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico include Lay&#x27;s and Ruffles potato chips; Doritos tortilla chips; Tostitos tortilla chips and dips; Cheetos cheese flavored snacks; Fritos corn chips; Rold Gold pretzels; Sun Chips; and Cracker Jack popcorn. Products made by this division are sold to independent distributors and retailers, and are transported from Frito-Lay&#x27;s manufacturing plants to distribution centers, principally in vehicles owned and operated by the company.

The division contributed 23 percent of PepsiCo&#x27;s net revenue in 2015. Until November 2009, Christopher Furman, President of Ventura Foods Inc., occupied the position of Food Services CEO.

In the second half of 2023, Frito-Lay, as part of the PepsiCo Positive initiative, will ship more than 700 electric vehicles (EV) to the US. The company predicts that this measure will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7,000 metric tons. Previous measures from the company were: order 100 Tesla Semi trucks, 30 of which have already been received, 40 Ford eTransits trucks for the Dallas - Fort Worth area, as well as the use of renewable energy storage, electric yard tractors BYD, Tesla semitrailers and Peterbilt electric trucks at a factory in Modesto, California.

===Quaker Foods North America===
&quot;Quaker Foods North America&quot;, created following PepsiCo&#x27;s acquisition of the Quaker Oats Company in 2001, manufactures, markets, and sells Quaker Oatmeal, Rice-A-Roni, Cap&#x27;n Crunch, and Life cereals, as well as Near East side dishes within North America. This division also owns and produces the Pearl Milling Company brand, which as of 2009 was the top selling line of syrups and pancake mixes within this region.

&quot;Sabritas&quot; and &quot;Gamesa&quot; are two of PepsiCo&#x27;s food and snack business lines headquartered in Mexico, and they were acquired by PepsiCo in 1966 and 1990, respectively. Sabritas markets Frito-Lay products in Mexico, including local brands such as Poffets, Rancheritos, Crujitos, and Sabritones. Gamesa is the largest manufacturer of cookies in Mexico, distributing brands such as Emperador, Arcoiris and Marías Gamesa.

The division contributed 4 percent of PepsiCo&#x27;s net revenues in 2015.

===Latin America===
PepsiCo&#x27;s &quot;Latin America Foods&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Snacks América Latina&quot;) operations market and sell primarily Quaker- and Frito-Lay/Sabritas/Elma Chips-branded snack foods within Mexico, Central and South America, including Argentina, Brazil, Peru, and other countries in this region. Snacks América Latina purchased Peruvian company Karinto S.A.C. including its production company Bocaditas Nacionales (with three production facilities in Peru) from the Hayashida family of Lima in 2009, adding the Karito brand to its product line, including Cuates, Fripapas, and Papi Frits.

The company started a new market strategy to sell its Pepsi Cola product in Mexico, stating that about one-third of the population has difficulty pronouncing &quot;Pepsi&quot;. With manufacture and sales of its product under the label &#x27;Pécsi&#x27;, the advertisement campaign features the Mexican soccer celebrity Cuauhtémoc Blanco. In 2009, PepsiCo had previously used the same strategy successfully in Argentina.

Pepsico will market and distribute Starbucks products in several Latin American countries for 2016.

The division contributed 13 percent of PepsiCo&#x27;s net revenues in 2015.

===Europe===
PepsiCo began to expand its distribution in Europe in the 1980s, and in 2015 it made up 17 percent of the company&#x27;s global net revenue. Unlike PepsiCo&#x27;s Americas business segments, both foods and beverages are manufactured and marketed under one umbrella division in this region, known as &quot;PepsiCo Europe&quot;. The primary brands sold by PepsiCo in Europe include Pepsi-Cola beverages, Frito-Lay snacks, Tropicana juices, and Quaker food products, as well as regional brands unique to Europe such as Walkers crisps, Copella, Paw Ridge, Snack-a-Jack, Duyvis, and others. PepsiCo also produces and distributes the soft drink 7UP in Europe via license agreement. PepsiCo has 3 sites in South Africa (Isando, Parrow, and Prospecton) which produce Lay&#x27;s and Simba chips.

PepsiCo&#x27;s European presence expanded in Russia in 2009 as the company announced a US$1B investment, and with its acquisition of Russian juice and dairy product brand Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods in December 2010 and Lebedyansky juice producer in March 2008. According to Reuters, &quot;PepsiCo reported that in 2017, its Russian operations generated net revenue of US$3.23 billion, which made up 5.1 percent of the company&#x27;s total net revenue.&quot; Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, a number of companies faced growing pressure to halt operations in Russia after not initially doing so. On March 8, 2022, PepsiCo announced in a letter from CEO Laguarta the &quot;suspension of the sale of Pepsi-Cola... our global beverage brands in Russia, including 7 Up and Mirinda... [and] capital investments and all advertising and promotional activities in Russia.&quot; However, PepsiCo maintained it had a &quot;responsibility&quot; to continue to sell &quot;milk and other dairy offerings, baby formula and baby food&quot;, and that &quot;[b]y continuing to operate, we will also continue to support the livelihoods of our 20,000 Russian associates and the 40,000 Russian agricultural workers in our supply chain&quot;. In July 2022, it was announced that PepsiCo will rebrand its products in Russia to PepsiCo Russian brands such as Evervess and Frustyle, in response to the Russian invasion. In September 2023, the Ukrainian National Agency on Corruption Prevention listed PepsiCo as a “war sponsor” for continuing to operate in Russia and, in particular, paying taxes.

===Africa, Middle East, South Asia (AMESA)===
The AMESA sector consists of the Africa, Middle East and South Asia regions, and features many leading global and local snack brands including Lay&#x27;s, Cheetos, and Doritos, along with local favorites such as Chipsy (Egypt), Simba (South Africa) and Kurkure (India and Pakistan), as well as various beverage brands including 7UP, Pepsi, Aquafina, Mtn Dew, Mirinda, and Sting. The AMESA sector covers a wide span of developing and emerging markets, including the key countries of Egypt, India, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and South Africa. In 2020, PepsiCo acquired Pioneer Foods, a leading food and beverage company in South Africa, adding its robust, well-known brands including Weet-Bix, Bokomo and Ceres to PepsiCo&#x27;s portfolio. The Pioneer Foods acquisition is key to PepsiCo&#x27;s growth strategy across the entire African continent.

In addition to the production and sales of several worldwide Pepsi-Cola, Quaker Foods, and Frito-Lay beverage and food product lines (including Pepsi and Doritos), this segment of PepsiCo&#x27;s business markets regional brands such as Mirinda, Kurkure, and Red Rock Deli, among others. While PepsiCo owns its own manufacturing and distribution facilities in certain parts of these regions, more of this production is conducted via alternate means such as licensing (which it does with Aquafina), contract manufacturing, joint ventures, and affiliate operations. PepsiCo&#x27;s businesses in these regions, as of 2015, contributed 10 percent to the company&#x27;s net revenue worldwide.

In 1992, the Pepsi Number Fever marketing campaign in the Philippines accidentally distributed 800,000 winning bottle caps for a 1 million peso grand prize, leading to riots and the deaths of five people.

In August 2012, PepsiCo signed an agreement with a local Myanmar distributor to sell its soft drinks after a 15-year break to re-enter the country.

SodaStream, which PepsiCo acquired in 2018 is based in Israel, while Sabra (which PepsiCo co-owns with the Israeli food conglomerate Strauss Group) holds a 60% market share for hummus sales in the United States as of 2015. The Strauss Group produces and distributes Frito-Lay products in Israel.

===Asia Pacific, Australia/New Zealand, China (APAC)===
In 1998 Pepsico purchased Smith&#x27;s Snackfood Company from United Biscuits. In 2006 PepsiCo purchased Bluebird Foods from Burns Philp.

==Corporate governance==
Headquartered in Harrison, New York, in the hamlet of Purchase, with research and development headquarters in Valhalla, New York, PepsiCo&#x27;s Chairman and CEO is Ramon Laguarta. The board of directors is composed of eleven outside directors as of 2010, including Ray Lee Hunt, Shona Brown, Victor Dzau, Arthur C. Martinez, Sharon Percy Rockefeller, Daniel Vasella, Dina Dublon, Ian M. Cook, Alberto Ibargüen, and Lloyd G. Trotter. Former top executives at PepsiCo include Steven Reinemund, Roger Enrico, D. Wayne Calloway, John Sculley, Michael H. Jordan, Donald M. Kendall, Christopher A. Sinclair, Irene Rosenfeld, David C. Novak, Brenda C. Barnes, and Alfred Steele.

On October 1, 2006, former Chief Financial Officer and President Indra Nooyi replaced Steve Reinemund as chief executive officer. Nooyi remained as the corporation&#x27;s president, and became Chairman of the Board in May 2007, later (in 2010) being named No.1 on &quot;Fortune&quot; list of the &quot;50 Most Powerful Women&quot; and No.6 on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ list of the &quot;World&#x27;s 100 Most Powerful Women&quot;. PepsiCo received a 100 percent rating on the Corporate Equality Index released by the LGBT-advocate group Human Rights Campaign starting in 2004, the third year of the report.

In November 2014, the firm&#x27;s president Zein Abdalla announced he would be stepping down from his position at the firm by the end of 2014. In 2017, Ramon Laguarta became the president and became its CEO in 2018.

===Headquarters===
The PepsiCo headquarters are located in the hamlet of Purchase, New York, in the town and village of Harrison, New York. It was one of the last architectural works by Edward Durell Stone. It consists of seven three-story buildings. Each building is connected to its neighbor through a corner. The property includes the Donald M. Kendall Sculpture Gardens with 45 contemporary sculptures open to the public. Works include those of Alexander Calder, Henry Moore, and Auguste Rodin. &quot;Westchester Magazine&quot; stated &quot;The buildings&#x27; square blocks rise from the ground into low, inverted ziggurats, with each of the three floors having strips of dark windows; patterned pre-cast concrete panels add texture to the exterior surfaces.&quot; In 2010 the magazine ranked the building as one of the ten most beautiful buildings in Westchester County.

During the 1960s, PepsiCo had its headquarters in 500 Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. In 1956 PepsiCo paid US$2 million for the previous building at the site. PepsiCo built 500 Park Avenue in 1960. In 1966, Mayor of New York City John Lindsay started a private campaign to convince PepsiCo to remain in New York City. Six months later, the company announced that it was moving to on the Blind Brook Polo Club in Purchase.

===Charitable activities===

PepsiCo has maintained a philanthropic program since 1962 called the PepsiCo Foundation, in which it primarily funds &quot;nutrition and activity, safe water and water usage efficiencies, and education&quot;, according to the foundation&#x27;s website. In 2009, US$27.9 million was contributed through this foundation, including grants to the United Way and YMCA, among others.

In 2009, PepsiCo launched an initiative called the &quot;Pepsi Refresh Project&quot;, For the first time in 23 years, PepsiCo did not invest in Super Bowl advertising for its iconic brand. Instead, the company diverted this US$20 million to the social media-fueled Pepsi Refresh Project: PepsiCo&#x27;s innovative cause-marketing program in which consumers submitted ideas for grants for health, environmental, social, educational, and cultural causes. in which individuals submit and vote on charitable and nonprofit collaborations. The main recipients of grants as part of the refresh project are community organizations with a local focus and nonprofit organizations, such as a high school in Michigan that—as a result of being selected in 2010—received US$250,000 towards construction of a fitness room. Following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in the spring of 2010, PepsiCo donated US$1.3 million to grant winners determined by popular vote. As of October 2010, the company had provided a cumulative total of US$11.7 million in funding, spread across 287 ideas of participant projects from 203 cities in North America. In late 2010, the refresh project was reported to be expanding to include countries outside of North America in 2011.

=== Finances ===

For the fiscal year 2017, PepsiCo reported earnings of US$4.857 billion, with an annual revenue of US$62.525 billion, an increase of 1.2% over the previous fiscal cycle. PepsiCo&#x27;s shares traded at over US$109 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$155.9 billion in September 2018. PepsiCo ranked No. 45 on the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.
==Brands==
PepsiCo&#x27;s product mix as of 2015 (based on worldwide net revenue) consists of 53 percent foods, and 47 percent beverages. On a worldwide basis, the company&#x27;s current products lines include several hundred brands that in 2009 were estimated to have generated approximately US$108 billion in cumulative annual retail sales.

The primary identifier of a food and beverage industry main brand is annual sales over US$1 billion. As of 2015, 22 PepsiCo brands met that mark, including: Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Lay&#x27;s, Gatorade, Tropicana, 7 Up/Teem, Evervess, Doritos, Brisk, Quaker Foods, Cheetos, Mirinda, Ruffles, Aquafina, Naked, Kevita, Propel, Sobe, H2oh, Sabra, Starbucks (ready to Drink Beverages), Pepsi Max, Tostitos, Sierra Mist (discontinued in 2023 in favor of Starry), Fritos, Walkers, and Bubly.

== Competition ==
The Coca-Cola Company has historically been considered PepsiCo&#x27;s primary competitor in the beverage market, and in December 2005, PepsiCo surpassed The Coca-Cola Company in market value for the first time in 12 years since both companies began to compete. In 2009, The Coca-Cola Company held a higher market share in carbonated soft drink sales within the U.S. In the same year, PepsiCo maintained a higher share of the U.S. refreshment beverage market, however, reflecting the differences in product lines between the two companies. As a result of mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships pursued by PepsiCo in the 1990s and 2000s, its business has shifted to include a broader product base, including foods, snacks, and beverages. The majority of PepsiCo&#x27;s revenues no longer come from the production and sale of carbonated soft drinks. Beverages accounted for less than 50 percent of its total revenue in 2009. In the same year, slightly more than 60 percent of PepsiCo&#x27;s beverage sales came from its primary non-carbonated brands, namely Gatorade and Tropicana.

PepsiCo&#x27;s Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats brands hold a significant share of the U.S. snack food market, accounting for approximately 39 percent of U.S. snack food sales in 2009. One of PepsiCo&#x27;s primary competitors in the snack food market overall is Kraft Foods (now Mondelez International), which in the same year held 11 percent of the U.S. snack market share.
Other competitors for soda are RC Cola, Keurig Dr. Pepper, and independent brands varying by region.

== Soviet Union ==
In 1959, the USSR held an exhibition of Soviet technology and culture in New York. The United States reciprocated with an exhibition in Sokolniki Park, Moscow, which led to the famous kitchen debate. One of the American products exhibited was Pepsi Cola. After obtaining a photo of then–US vice president Richard Nixon and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev sipping Pepsi, PepsiCo executive Donald Kendall was able to capture the attention of the Soviet people, and in 1972 he negotiated a cola monopoly in the USSR and Pepsi became the first US consumer product to be produced and marketed in the Soviet Union. Due to Soviet restrictions on transporting roubles abroad, PepsiCo struck a barter deal whereby Stolichnaya vodka would be exchanged for Pepsi syrup.

In 1989, amidst declining vodka sales, PepsiCo bartered for 2 new Soviet oil tankers, 17 decommissioned submarines (for $150,000 each), a frigate, a cruiser and a destroyer, which they could in turn sell for non-Soviet currency. The oil tankers were leased out through a Norwegian company, while the other ships were immediately sold for scrap. A deal struck the following year would&#x27;ve seen Pepsi acquire 85 ships worth nearly $3 billion over the next 10 years, but it only acquired 10 additional ships before the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The deal was renegotiated with the former nations of the USSR, and included receiving cheese from Russia to supply its Pizza Hut locations and receiving double-hulled tankers from Ukraine. These deals also originated an erroneous factoid which claims that, after acquiring the Soviet fleet, PepsiCo briefly possessed one of the most powerful navies in the world. In actuality, the only warships acquired by PepsiCo were &quot;small, old, obsolete, unseaworthy vessels&quot;.

== Controversies ==
Pepsi has been repeatedly criticized by environmentalists for its relationship to negative environmental impacts of agriculture in its supply chain and in its distributing operations, such as palm oil–related deforestation and pesticide use, its use of water resources, and the negative impacts of its packaging—Pepsi&#x27;s packaging has consistently been one of the top sources of plastic pollution globally. Similarly public health advocates have criticized Pepsi&#x27;s high-calorie, poor nutrition product lines along with other popular snack and drink manufacturers. In response PepsiCo has made public comments on its commitment to minimizing their impact but has not released public information documenting progress on most of its public commitments.

=== Working conditions ===

In July 2021, Frito-Lay, a subsidiary of PepsiCo became the subject to media attention over poor working conditions at its plant in Topeka. These conditions, which allegedly include forced overtime and 84-hour workweeks for months, led to a strike involving hundreds of workers at the Topeka location. The strike began on July 5 and ended on July 23, after ratifications of a two-year contract that guarantees workers at least one day off each week and raised wages.
=== Environmental record ===

==== Rainforests and palm oil ====
PepsiCo Palm Oil Commitments published in May 2014 were welcomed by media as a positive step towards ensuring that the company&#x27;s palm oil purchases will not contribute to deforestation and human rights abuses in the palm oil industry. NGOs warned that the commitments did not go far enough, and in light of the deforestation crisis in Southeast Asia, have called on the company to close the gaps in its policies immediately.

==== Genetically modified ingredients ====
PepsiCo has contributed US$1,716,300 to oppose the passage of California Proposition 37, which would mandate the disclosure of genetically modified crops used in the production of California food products. PepsiCo believes &quot;that genetically-modified products can play a role in generating positive economic, social and environmental contributions to societies around the world; particularly in times of food shortages.&quot;

==== Water usage (India, U.S., U.K.) ====
PepsiCo&#x27;s usage of water was the subject of controversy in India in the early and mid-2000s, in part because of the company&#x27;s alleged impact on water usage in a country where water shortages are a perennial issue. In this setting, PepsiCo was perceived by India-based environmental organizations as a company that diverted water to manufacture a discretionary product, making it a target for critics at the time.

As a result, in 2003 PepsiCo launched a country-wide program to achieve a &quot;positive water balance&quot; in India by 2009. In 2007, PepsiCo&#x27;s then-CEO Indra Nooyi made a trip to India to address water usage practices in the country, prompting prior critic Sunita Narain, director of the Centre for Science &amp; Environment (CSE), to note that PepsiCo &quot;seem(s) to be doing something serious about water now.&quot; According to the company&#x27;s 2009 corporate citizenship report, as well as media reports at the time, the company (in 2009) replenished nearly six billion liters of water within India, exceeding the aggregate water intake of approximately five billion liters by PepsiCo&#x27;s India manufacturing facilities.

Water usage concerns have arisen at times in other countries where PepsiCo operates. In the U.S., water shortages in certain regions resulted in increased scrutiny on the company&#x27;s production facilities, which were cited in media reports as being among the largest water users in cities facing drought—such as Atlanta, Georgia. In response, the company formed partnerships with non-profit organizations such as the Earth Institute and Water.org, and in 2009 began cleaning new Gatorade bottles with purified air instead of rinsing with water, among other water conservation practices. In the United Kingdom, also in response to regional drought conditions, PepsiCo snacks brand Walkers&#x27; reduced water usage at its largest potato chip facility by 45 percent between the years 2001 and 2008. In doing so, the factory used machinery that captured water naturally contained in potatoes, and used it to offset the need for outside water.

As a result of water reduction practices and efficiency improvements, PepsiCo in 2009 saved more than 12 billion liters of water worldwide, compared to its 2006 water usage. Environmental advocacy organizations including the Natural Resources Defense Council and individual critics such as Rocky Anderson (mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah) voiced concerns in 2009, noting that the company could conserve additional water by refraining from the production of discretionary products such as Aquafina. The company maintained its positioning of bottled water as &quot;healthy and convenient&quot;, while also beginning to partially offset environmental impacts of such products through alternate means, including packaging weight reduction.

==== Pesticide regulation (India) ====

PepsiCo&#x27;s India operations were met with substantial resistance in 2003 and again in 2006, when an environmental organization in New Delhi made the claim that, based on its research, it believed that the levels of pesticides in PepsiCo (along with those from rival The Coca-Cola Company), exceeded a set of proposed safety standards on soft drink ingredients that had been developed by the Bureau of Indian Standards. PepsiCo denied the allegations, and India&#x27;s health ministry has also dismissed the allegations—both questioning the accuracy of the data compiled by the CSE, as it was tested by its own internal laboratories without being verified by outside peer review. The ensuing dispute prompted a short-lived ban on the sale of PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company soft drinks within India&#x27;s southwestern state of Kerala in 2006; however this ban was reversed by the Kerala High Court one month later.

In November 2010, the Supreme Court of India invalidated a criminal complaint filed against PepsiCo India by the Kerala government, on the basis that the beverages did meet local standards at the time of the allegations. The court ruling stated that the &quot;percentage of pesticides&quot; found in the tested beverages was &quot;within the tolerance limits subsequently prescribed in respect of such product&quot; because at the time of testing &quot;there was no provision governing pesticide adulteration in cold drinks.&quot; In 2010, PepsiCo was among the 12 multinational companies that displayed &quot;the most impressive corporate social responsibility credentials in emerging markets&quot;, as determined by the U.S. Department of State. PepsiCo&#x27;s India unit received recognition on the basis of its water conservation and safety practices and corresponding results.

==== Packaging and recycling ====
Environmental advocates have raised concern over the environmental impacts surrounding the disposal of PepsiCo&#x27;s bottled beverage products in particular, as bottle recycling rates for the company&#x27;s products in 2009 averaged 34 percent within the U.S. In 2019, BreakFreeFromPlastic named PepsiCo a top 10 global plastic polluter for the second year in a row. The company has employed efforts to minimize these environmental impacts via packaging developments combined with recycling initiatives. In 2010, PepsiCo announced a goal to create partnerships that prompt an increase in the beverage container recycling rate in the U.S. to 50 percent by 2018.

One strategy enacted to reach this goal has been the placement of interactive recycling kiosks called &quot;Dream Machines&quot; in supermarkets, convenience stores, and gas stations, with the intent of increasing access to recycling receptacles. The use of resin to manufacture its plastic bottles has resulted in reduced packaging weight, which in turn reduces the volume of fossil fuels required to transport certain PepsiCo products. The weight of Aquafina bottles was reduced nearly 40 percent, to 15 grams, with a packaging redesign in 2009. Also in that year, PepsiCo brand Naked Juice began production and distribution of the first 100 percent post-consumer recycled plastic bottle.

On March 15, 2011, PepsiCo unveiled the world&#x27;s first plant-based PET bottle. The bottle is made from plant-based materials, such as switch grass, corn husks, and pine bark, and is 100% recyclable. PepsiCo plans to reuse more by-products of its manufacturing processes such as orange peels and oat hulls in the bottles. PepsiCo has identified methods to create a molecular structure that is the same as normal petroleum-based PET—which will make the new bottle technology, dubbed &quot;Green Bottle&quot;, similar to Coke&#x27;s &quot;PlantBottle&quot; idea from 2009, which feel the same as normal PET. PepsiCo have said to pilot production in 2012, and upon successful completion of the pilot, intends moving to full-scale commercialization, however in 2021 there are still no records of such bottles being produced.

In a bid to reduce packaging consumption, in recent years the PepsiCoPartners launched as a service offering carbonated drinks dispensers within the US. The dispensers are currently being trialed in large corporate offices and universities.

In 2020 PepsiCo teamed up with French biochemistry startup Carbios in order to promote and establish a new recycling method for used plastic bottles. This method uses enzymes to dissolve plastic very thoroughly and the final leftovers can be used to produce textiles.

==== Energy usage and carbon footprint ====
PepsiCo, along with other manufacturers in its industry, has drawn criticism from environmental advocacy groups for the production and distribution of plastic product packaging, which consumed an additional of petrochemicals in 2008. These critics have also expressed apprehension over the production volume of plastic packaging, which results in the emission of carbon dioxide. Beginning largely in 2006, PepsiCo began development of more efficient means of producing and distributing its products using less energy, while also placing a focus on emissions reduction. In a comparison of 2009 energy usage with recorded usage in 2006, the company&#x27;s per-unit use of energy was reduced by 16 percent in its beverage plants and 7 percent in snack plants.

In 2009, Tropicana (owned by PepsiCo) was the first brand in the U.S. to determine the carbon footprint of its orange juice product, as certified by the Carbon Trust, an outside auditor of carbon emissions. Also in 2009, PepsiCo began the test deployment of so-called &quot;green vending machines&quot;, which reduce energy usage by 15 percent in comparison to average models in use. It developed these machines in coordination with Greenpeace, which described the initiative as &quot;transforming the industry in a way that is going to be more climate-friendly to a great degree.&quot;

PepsiCo has announced a global company goal of transitioning its electricity sources to 100% renewable energy, although they did not specify a specific year of which this goal would hypothetically occur at. PepsiCo has additionally also publicly announced its goal of decreasing its main operation&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions by 75% as compared to the 2015 baseline, by 2030. Pepsico has succeeded in achieving 23% of their absolute emissions target reduction as of 2022.

=== Product nutrition ===
According to its 2009 annual report, PepsiCo states that it is &quot;committed to delivering sustainable growth by investing in a healthier future for people and our planet&quot;, which it has defined in its mission statement since 2006 as &quot;Performance with Purpose&quot;. According to news and magazine coverage on the subject in 2010, the objective of this initiative is to increase the number and variety of healthier food and beverage products made available to its customers, employ a reduction in the company&#x27;s environmental impact, and to facilitate diversity and healthy lifestyles within its employee base. Its activities in regards to the pursuit of its goals—namely environmental impacts of production and the nutritional composition of its products—have been the subject of recognition from health and environmental advocates and organizations, and at times have raised concerns among its critics. As the result of a more recent focus on such efforts, &quot;critics consider (PepsiCo) to be perhaps the most proactive and progressive of the food companies&quot;, according to former &quot;New York Times&quot; food industry writer Melanie Warner in 2010.

==== Product diversity ====
From its founding in 1965 until the early 1990s, the majority of PepsiCo&#x27;s product line consisted of carbonated soft drinks and convenience snacks. PepsiCo broadened its product line substantially throughout the 1990s and 2000s with the acquisition and development of what its CEO deemed as &quot;good-for-you&quot; products, including Quaker Oats, Naked Juice, and Tropicana orange juice. Sales of such healthier-oriented PepsiCo brands totaled US$10 billion in 2009, representing 18 percent of the company&#x27;s total revenue in that year. This movement into a broader, healthier product range has been moderately well received by nutrition advocates; though commentators in this field have also suggested that PepsiCo market its healthier items as aggressively as less-healthy core products.

In response to shifting consumer preferences and in part due to increasing governmental regulation, PepsiCo in 2010 indicated its intention to grow this segment of its business, forecasting that sales of fruit, vegetable, whole grain, and fiber-based products will amount to US$30 billion by 2020. To meet this intended target, the company has said that it plans to acquire additional health-oriented brands while also making changes to the composition of existing products that it sells.

==== Ingredient changes in Pepsi ====
Public health advocates have suggested that there may be a link between the ingredient makeup of PepsiCo&#x27;s core snack and carbonated soft drink products and rising rates of health conditions such as obesity and diabetes. The company aligns with personal responsibility advocates, who assert that food and beverages with higher proportions of sugar or salt content are fit for consumption in moderation by individuals who also exercise on a regular basis.

Changes to the composition of its products with nutrition in mind have involved reducing fat content, moving away from trans-fats, and producing products in calorie-specific serving sizes to discourage overconsumption, among other changes. One of the earlier ingredient changes involved sugar and caloric reduction, with the introduction of Diet Pepsi in 1964 and Pepsi Max in 1993—both of which are variants of their full-calorie counterpart, Pepsi. More recent changes have consisted of saturated fat reduction, which Frito-Lay reduced by 50% in Lay&#x27;s and Ruffles potato chips in the U.S. between 2006 and 2009. Also in 2009, PepsiCo&#x27;s Tropicana brand introduced a new variation of orange juice (Trop50) sweetened in part by the plant Stevia, which reduced calories by half. Since 2007, the company also made available lower-calorie variants of Gatorade, which it calls &quot;G2&quot;. On May 5, 2014, PepsiCo announced that the company would remove brominated vegetable oil from many of its products, but a timeframe was not discussed.

==== Distribution to children ====
As public perception placed additional scrutiny on the marketing and distribution of carbonated soft drinks to children, PepsiCo announced in 2010 that by 2012, it will remove beverages with higher sugar content from primary and secondary schools worldwide. It also, under voluntary guidelines adopted in 2006, replaced &quot;full-calorie&quot; beverages in U.S. schools with &quot;lower-calorie&quot; alternatives, leading to a 95 percent reduction in the 2009 sales of full-calorie variants in these schools in comparison to the sales recorded in 2004. In 2008, in accordance with guidelines adopted by the International Council of Beverages Associations, PepsiCo eliminated the advertising and marketing of products that do not meet its nutrition standards, to children under the age of 12.

In 2010, Michelle Obama initiated a campaign to end childhood obesity (titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Move!&quot;), in which she sought to encourage healthier food options in public schools, improved food nutrition labeling, and increased physical activity for children. In response to this initiative, PepsiCo, along with food manufacturers Campbell Soup, Coca-Cola, General Mills, and others in an alliance referred to as the &quot;Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation&quot;, announced in 2010 that the companies will collectively cut one trillion calories from their products sold by the end of 2012 and 1.5 trillion calories by the end of 2015.

<text>Susan P. Stroman (born October 17, 1954) is an American theatre director, choreographer, and performer. Her notable theater productions include &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;The Music Man&quot;, &quot;Crazy for You&quot;, &quot;Contact&quot;, &quot;The Producers&quot;, &quot;The Frogs&quot;, &quot;The Scottsboro Boys&quot;, &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;New York, New York&quot;.

She is a five-time Tony Award winner, four for Best Choreography and one as Best Director of a Musical for &quot;The Producers&quot;. In addition, she is a recipient of two Laurence Olivier Awards, five Drama Desk Awards, eight Outer Critics Circle Awards, two Lucille Lortel Awards, and the George Abbott Award for Lifetime Achievement in the American Theater. She is a 2014 inductee in the American Theater Hall of Fame in New York City.

==Early years==
Stroman was born in Wilmington, Delaware, the daughter of Frances (née Nolan) and Charles Harry Stroman. She was exposed to show tunes by her piano-playing salesman father. She began studying dance, concentrating on jazz, tap, and ballet at the age of five. She studied under James Jamieson at the Academy of the Dance in Wilmington. She majored in English at the University of Delaware. She performed, choreographed and directed at community theaters in the Delaware and Philadelphia area.

After graduating in 1976, she moved to New York City. Her first professional appearance was in &quot;Hit the Deck&quot; at the Goodspeed Opera House in 1977. Later that year she was cast in the role of Hunyak in the National tour of &quot;Chicago&quot;, which marked her first time working with composer John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb.

Her first Broadway credit was as an ensemble member in the 1979 musical &quot;Whoopee!&quot;. In 1980 she was assistant director, assistant choreographer, and dance captain for the Broadway show &quot;Musical Chairs&quot;. Wanting to direct and choreograph instead of perform, Stroman concentrated on creating for the theater. She worked in small venues as a director and choreographer in various industrial shows, club acts and commercials.

==Career==
===Theatre===

==== 1987–2000: Breakthrough ====
Stroman&#x27;s big break as a choreographer came in 1987 with the Off-Broadway revival of &quot;Flora the Red Menace&quot; (music by John Kander and Fred Ebb) at the Vineyard Theatre. Her work there was seen by Hal Prince, who hired her to create the dance sequences for his New York City Opera production of &quot;Don Giovanni.&quot;

Her relationship with Kander and Ebb led to co-creating, along with Scott Ellis and David Thompson, the 1991 hit Off-Broadway musical &quot;And the World Goes &#x27;Round&quot;. In 1992 she went on to choreograph &quot;Liza Stepping Out at Radio City Music Hall&quot; starring Liza Minnelli, receiving an Emmy nomination for her work. Later that year she earned her third Broadway credit for her collaboration with director, and then-future husband, Mike Ockrent on &quot;Crazy for You&quot;. The show won the Tony Award for Best Musical and she won her first Tony Award for Best Choreography.

In 1994, Stroman won her second Tony Award when she collaborated with Prince on a revival of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, where she used some of her most innovative ideas. She added several dance montages to the show, complete with a revolving door, to help guide the audience through the generations that are covered in the show. Stroman heavily researched the period in which the show takes place and learned that African-Americans are credited for inventing the Charleston. She used that information in designing the montages, as the popular dance is introduced by and eventually appropriated from the black characters. In 1994, Stroman collaborated again with her husband Mike Ockrent on the holiday spectacular &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; at Madison Square Garden, which ran for 10 years, and the Broadway musical &quot;Big, The Musical&quot; (1996). She returned to her collaboration with Kander and Ebb, Ellis and Thompson on the Broadway musical &quot;Steel Pier&quot; (1997). In 1999, her choreography of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, directed by Trevor Nunn at the Royal National Theater, won Stroman her second Olivier Award for her outstanding choreography. Stroman&#x27;s husband Mike Ockrent died from leukemia on December 2, 1999.

She immersed herself in her work and directed and choreographed her first Broadway show as director, the 2000 revival of &quot;The Music Man&quot;. At the same time, Stroman was approached by Lincoln Center Theater&#x27;s artistic director André Bishop, who offered assistance with developing the project of her choice. She and John Weidman, who had written the book for &quot;Big&quot;, began working on what would become the three-part &quot;dance play&quot; &quot;Contact&quot;, which she choreographed as well as directed. The show opened at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Mitzi Newhouse Theater in the fall of 1999, and later transferred to the larger Vivian Beaumont Theater, where it was reclassified as a musical. It won the 2000 Tony Award for Best Musical. Stroman won her third Tony Award for best choreography. &quot;Contact&quot; won a 2003 Emmy Award for Outstanding Classical Music-Dance Program when a live broadcast of the show appeared as an episode of PBS&#x27;s &quot;Live from Lincoln Center&quot;. For Lincoln Center Theater, Stroman went on to direct and choreograph &quot;Thou Shalt Not&quot; (2001) with music by Harry Connick Jr. and &quot;The Frogs&quot; (2004) with book by Nathan Lane.

==== 2001–present: Established career ====
In 2001, Stroman directed and choreographed the Mel Brooks musical &quot;The Producers&quot;. Stroman&#x27;s late husband, Ockrent, had initially been named to direct. It was a commercial success and won a record twelve Tony Awards. Stroman won her fourth and fifth Tony Awards for direction and choreography, becoming the first woman to win both awards in the same night. She was also the second woman ever to win Best Direction of a Musical after Julie Taymor in 1998. In 2005, she made her feature film directorial debut with a film adaptation of the show. The movie was nominated for four Golden Globe Awards.

In 2007, she again collaborated with Brooks, as director and choreographer of the musical &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;. In the fall of 2017, she and Brooks opened a newly revised version of the show at the Garrick Theatre in London&#x27;s West End after a successful tryout at the Theatre Royal in Newcastle.

She directed and choreographed the musical &quot;Happiness&quot;, which has a book by John Weidman, music by Scott Frankel and lyrics by Michael Korie. The musical opened in February 2009 at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center.

The musical &quot;The Scottsboro Boys&quot; opened at the Vineyard Theatre in February 2010. The music is by Kander and Ebb and the book is by David Thompson; Stroman both directed and choreographed. The show later transferred to Broadway where it ran for 49 performances at the Lyceum Theatre and received 12 Tony Award Nominations. Regional theaters such as the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, San Diego&#x27;s Old Globe, American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, and the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles have all mounted successful productions of the show. In 2013, Stroman directed the UK premiere of the show at the Young Vic in London. After its successful run there, the show transferred to the West End where it was honored with the 2014 Evening Standard&#x27;s Ned Sherrin Award.

She co-directed with Hal Prince the new musical &quot;Paradise Found&quot;, which premiered at the Menier Chocolate Factory (London) on May 19, 2010. The cast included Mandy Patinkin, Judy Kaye and Shuler Hensley.

Stroman directed and choreographed the new musical, &quot;Big Fish&quot; with songs by Andrew Lippa and book by John August. The show, based on the book and film of the same name, opened at the Oriental Theater in Chicago in April and May 2013 and then ran on Broadway in September 2013 to December 2013.

In 2014 she directed and choreographed a production of &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; for the Metropolitan Opera, starring Renee Fleming in the title role.

Stroman worked with Woody Allen on a musical adaptation of his film &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot;, titled &quot;Bullets Over Broadway the Musical&quot;, which opened on Broadway in April 2014.

She directed and choreographed the new musical &quot;Little Dancer&quot;, which ran at the Kennedy Center, Eisenhower Theater from October 25, 2014, to November 30. The book and lyrics are by Lynn Ahrens and music by Stephen Flaherty. In the spring of 2019 she directed and choreographed &quot;Marie, Dancing Still&quot; for Seattle&#x27;s 5th Avenue Theatre. A newly reworked and retitled production of &quot;Little Dancer&quot;, the show starred Tiler Peck reprising her title role alongside Terrence Mann and Louise Pitre.

Stroman collaborated with Prince once again as co-director of a new musical entitled &quot;Prince of Broadway&quot;, a retrospective of the career and life of Hal Prince. The show has orchestrations and new material written by Jason Robert Brown. The revue premiered in Tokyo at the Tokyu Theatre Orb in October 2015 and then ran in Osaka in November through December 2015, and featured Tony Yazbeck, Ramin Karimloo, Shuler Hensley and Nancy Opel. It premiered on Broadway on August 24, 2017, at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre as a co-production of the Manhattan Theatre Club and Gorgeous Entertainment. The book is by David Thompson.

In 2016 she returned to the Vineyard Theatre to direct the play &quot;Dot&quot;, written by Colman Domingo. The following year she directed and choreographed her fourth collaboration with the Vineyard Theatre, &quot;The Beast in the Jungle&quot;, winning the 2018 Joe Callaway Award for excellence in choreography. The music was composed by John Kander and the book written by David Thompson.

In April 2022, Stroman directed the Broadway play &quot;&quot;, by Selina Fillinger, at the Shubert Theatre.

Stroman directed and choreographed the Chichester Festival Theatre revival of &quot;Crazy for You&quot;, which transferred to the West End&#x27;s Gillian Lynne Theatre in 2023.

Her next projects include the Broadway musical adaptation of the television series &quot;Smash&quot; and the play &quot;Left on Tenth&quot; by Delia Ephron. 

===Dance===
In 2004, Stroman was the first woman to choreograph a full-length ballet for New York City Ballet. &quot;Double Feature&quot;, with music by Irving Berlin and Walter Donaldson, is now in the New York City Ballet repertory.

Stroman had previously worked with New York City Ballet in 1999, when she created &quot;Blossom Got Kissed&quot;, featuring the music of Duke Ellington, to celebrate the company&#x27;s 50th Anniversary season. She later revisited the piece, choreographing three additional short dances to be performed alongside the original. This new expanded ballet entitled &quot;For the Love of Duke&quot; premiered in May 2011.

In 1997 she created &quot;But Not for Me&quot; for the Martha Graham Company, using the music of George Gershwin.

The world premiere of &quot;Take Five…More Or Less&quot; with The Pacific Northwest Ballet opened in 2008. Stroman combined jazz music by Dave Brubeck and classical pointe work. The ballet is now in their repertoire.

===Television===
She appeared as herself in Season Four of the HBO series &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, directing Larry David and David Schwimmer in a production of the Broadway hit musical &quot;The Producers&quot;. In 2017 she returned to the show, choreographing Larry David&#x27;s musical &quot;Fatwa!&quot;, starring Lin-Manuel Miranda as Salman Rushdie.

She has also made multiple appearances as herself on the Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Barefoot Contessa&quot; program, as she is a close friend of its host, Ina Garten.

<text>Ricardo Viñes y Roda (, , ; 5 February 1875 – 29 April 1943) was a Spanish pianist. He gave the premieres of works by Ravel, Debussy, Satie, Falla and Albéniz. He was the piano teacher of the composer Francis Poulenc and the pianists Marcelle Meyer, Joaquín Nin-Culmell and Léo-Pol Morin.

==Life and career==
Viñes was born in Lleida, Spain. He studied the piano at the Paris Conservatoire under Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot, and composition and harmony with Benjamin Godard and Albert Lavignac.

In 1895 Viñes made his début at the Salle Pleyel, Paris. From 1900 he had an international career, touring in Russia and throughout Europe and South America. Between 1930 and 1936 he lived in Argentina, returning to Paris in 1936 where he continued to play until the final year of his life.

According to Charles Timbrell and Esperanza Berrocal in the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, Viñes&#x27;s keyboard technique was magnificent and his repertoire extensive. In addition to the established classics he championed new works by the many composers of whom he was a close friend. They included Ravel, Debussy, Satie, Falla, Granados, Albéniz and Déodat de Séverac. He was also a proponent of Russian music, and introduced France to pieces by Mussorgsky (&quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;), Balakirev (&quot;Islamey&quot;) and Prokofiev (&quot;Sarcasmes&quot;). &quot;Grove&quot; lists among the many works dedicated to him Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Oiseaux tristes&quot;, Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Poissons d’or&quot; and Falla&#x27;s &quot;Noches en los jardines de España&quot;.

Viñes composed a small number of works, the best known of which are the two &quot;Hommages&quot;, for Séverac and Satie. He also wrote several articles, mostly on Spanish music, and his diaries are much quoted by biographers of his musical contemporaries. His piano students included Marcelle Meyer, Joaquín Nin-Culmell, Léo-Pol Morin and Francis Poulenc. Poulenc later said of his teacher:
An annual International piano competition &quot;Ricard Viñes&quot; has been held since 1995 in his birth town Lleida. The city council named one of the city&#x27;s most popular squares the &quot;Plaça Ricard Vinyes&quot;, and the main room of the Llotja de Lleida theatre and congress centre (opened in 2010) is also named after him.

Viñes died in Barcelona at the age of 68. He was unmarried.

==Discography==
Viñes reportedly had an intense dislike for the recording process, but nonetheless left 25 recordings dating from the 1930s. In &quot;Grove&quot;&#x27;s view, the playing as recorded reveals &quot;an unforced virtuosity, charming rhythmic pointing and shimmering pedal effects.&quot;

<text>Eugene Michael Kostyra (June 19, 1947 – May 3, 2020) was a Canadian politician in Manitoba. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1988 and a cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party government of Howard Pawley.

==Early life==
Born on June 19, 1947, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to Albert Kostyra and Jean Swetz, Eugene Michael Kostyra was educated at Ralph Brown Elementary School and Isaac Newton Junior High School. He dropped out of St. John&#x27;s High School and worked as a clerk-typist and journeyman electrician. He became involved in Manitoba&#x27;s trade union movement before entering politics, holding a prominent position in the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE).

==Career==

=== Politics ===
In the provincial election of 1981, Kostyra was elected for the north-end Winnipeg riding of Seven Oaks. On November 30, 1981, he was named Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, Minister of Culture, Heritage and Recreation and Minister of Urban Affairs, with responsibility for the Manitoba Housing and Renewal Corporation. He lost the last of these positions on February 12, 1982, although not before establishing the first rent controls in the province.

On August 20, 1982, Kostyra was removed from the Consumer and Corporate Affairs portfolio and given responsibility for the Public Print Act and the Office of the Queen&#x27;s Printer. On November 4, 1983, he was relieved of these latter responsibilities and the Urban Affairs portfolio, and named Minister of Industry, Trade and Technology, with responsibility for Manitoba Data Services and the Manitoba Development Corporation. On January 30, 1985, he was also given responsibility for the Manitoba Lotteries Foundation.

Kostyra was re-elected in the provincial election of 1986. Following a cabinet shuffle on April 17, 1986, he was promoted to the senior position of Finance Minister and Chairman of the Manitoba Treasury Board, with responsibility for the Civil Service Act, the Civil Service Special Supplementary Benefit Act, and the Public Servants Insurance Act. He also retained responsibility for the Manitoba Development Corporation until February 4, 1987. On September 21, 1987, he was named minister responsible for A.E. McKenzie Co. Ltd.

In early 1988, Kostyra introduced his government&#x27;s annual budget to the legislature, with the expectation that it would be passed by the narrow NDP majority in parliament. Instead, the government was defeated when disgruntled NDP backbencher Jim Walding voted against the budget, despite having promised Kostyra that he would support it. The NDP had lost considerable support in the two years since their 1986 re-election, primarily as a result of the increased automobile insurance rates in the province and significant revenue shortfalls in the province&#x27;s publicly owned telephone system. The NDP entered the 1988 election with almost no hope of retaining government, and retained only twelve seats; Kostyra himself was defeated in Seven Oaks by Liberal Mark Minenko.

=== Later career ===
Kostyra remained active in the labour movement after his loss, serving as a Regional Director of CUPE Manitoba. He was also an active promoter of credit unions over large banks in this period. In 1999, he was appointed by the NDP government of Gary Doer to head the province&#x27;s powerful Community and Economic Development Committee of Cabinet.

In 2003, Kostyra supported Bill Blaikie for the leadership of the federal New Democratic Party.

== Death ==
Kostyra died on May 3, 2020, in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

<text>William Hindman (April 1, 1743January 19, 1822) was an American lawyer and statesman from Talbot County, Maryland. He represented Maryland in the Continental Congress, and in the federal Congress as both a Representative from the second and seventh districts, and as a U.S. Senator.

William was born in Dorchester County in the Province of Maryland, the second son of Jacob Hindman (1713–1766) and Mary Trippe Hindman (died 1782). Jacob was a plantation owner from Talbot county who served as sheriff of Talbot County from 1745 to 1748, and as a member of the colonial Assembly. William studied law at the Inns of Court in London, returning to Maryland in 1765. He was admitted to the bar, and practiced law in Talbot County.

From 1775 and 1777, Hindman served in Maryland&#x27;s revolutionary government, as the state&#x27;s Treasurer for the Eastern Shore. He resigned this post when he was elected to the state Senate in 1777. He was re-elected several times, and served until 1784. Maryland sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1785 and 1786.

Hindman returned to Maryland and served on the governor&#x27;s executive council from 1789 to 1792. In 1792 voters returned him to the state Senate, but later that year he was elected to the United States House of Representatives after the resignation of Joshua Seney. He served in the Congress from 1793 to 1799, when he returned to his plantation, although he served in the state&#x27;s House of Representatives in 1799 and 1800. In the U.S. House, he was one of nine representatives to vote against the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.

In 1800 Maryland&#x27;s U.S. Senator James Lloyd resigned, and Hindman was named to finish his term. He served in the United States Senate from December 1800 until November 1801. In the Senate, he was aligned with the Federalists. He declined to run for re-election.

Hindman died in Baltimore, Maryland, and is buried in St. Paul&#x27;s Burial Ground there.

==History of the quartet==

===Foundation===

The Budapest String Quartet was formed in 1917 by four friends, all members of opera orchestras that had ceased playing after World War I broke out. 
The members were all protégés of Jenő Hubay (violin), a Hungarian pupil of Joseph Joachim and David Popper (cello), a Bohemian. Hubay and Popper had helped to make Budapest a major center for musical education, attracting famous students such as Joseph Szigeti. Hubay and Popper had supported Sándor Végh and Feri Roth in the formation of two other quartets bearing their respective names, and were themselves part of an earlier Budapest Quartet, the new quartet being named in its honor. The debut recital of the new Budapest String Quartet (in Hungarian: Budapesti Vonósnégyes), took place in December 1917 in Kolozsvár, then in Hungary, now called Cluj-Napoca in present-day Romania.

The quartet was established with the following rules:

#All disputes, musical or business, were to be resolved by a vote. In case of a tie, no change.
#Players were not allowed to take engagements outside the quartet.
#Players were paid equally, with nothing extra for the leader (first violin).
#No wives or girlfriends were permitted at rehearsals or discussions.

No previous quartet had attempted to live entirely on the proceeds of its concerts. It was a brave decision for that time. Much later, in July 1930, the current members added another rule to resolve tied votes: One player, chosen by lot, would have a deciding vote. His initials would be written on the music, and he would always have the extra vote for that piece. If he was replaced, his successor would inherit his voting rights.

The original members were Emil Hauser, aged 24, from Budapest; Alfred Indig, 25, from Hungary; István Ipolyi, 31, from Újvidék in Hungary; and Harry Son from Rotterdam, in the Netherlands.

In 1920, Indig resigned in the hope of advancement; he was replaced by Imre Pogany, a native of Budapest who had studied under Hubay and Zoltán Kodály. After resigning, Indig became a soloist with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra; and 1931 he became concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic. When the Nazis came to power, Indig fled to Paris where he led another quartet for a while. He then relocated to Amsterdam until 1951, and thereafter returned to Paris. His date and place of death remain unknown.

===Move to Berlin===

In 1921 or 1922, owing to political unrest in Budapest, the quartet moved to Berlin where the group developed a large repertoire but received only mixed reviews. In 1925 the quartet debuted in London and signed a recording contract with His Master&#x27;s Voice, making recordings at His Master&#x27;s Voice Studio B at Hayes and the Queen&#x27;s Small Hall .

In May 1927, without telling the others, Pogany traveled to Cincinnati to see his friend conductor Fritz Reiner about a job in the symphony orchestra there. He was offered the post of principal second violin, but refused it at that time. The other members of the quartet were furious because if he had left, they would have found it very difficult to find and rehearse a replacement player in time for the new season. In the ensuing row, Pogany resigned. He then emigrated to America, and this time decided to join the Cincinnati Symphony and teach at the local conservatory. In 1929, he moved on to the New York Philharmonic Orchestra under Arturo Toscanini as principal second violin, remaining there until his retirement in 1958.

===Josef Roisman – second violin===

The man recommended to replace Pogany was Josef Roisman, familiarly known as Joe. Roisman was born on 25 July 1900 in Odessa, and was started on the violin at the age of six with Pyotr Stolyarsky, who was also the first teacher of David Oistrakh and Nathan Milstein. After the tragic early death of Joe&#x27;s father, a wealthy Odessa woman made it possible for him, his sister and mother to relocate to Berlin so that he could study with Alexander Fiedemann. There he befriended Boris Kroyt, another Odesan studying with Fiedemann. At the outbreak of World War I, the family returned to Odessa where Joe continued his studies with Naoam Blinder, another Odesan, who had just returned from England.

After the Russian revolution, Roisman was co-opted to play at farms and factories. He managed to escape in 1923 while working near Poland. He traveled to Prague, then to Berlin. In Berlin he met with Kroyt again, who found work for him in a film orchestra. It was during this time that the quartet offer came. Joe was comfortable and secure in the orchestra, but his first love was chamber music. In the end, his wife Polo persuaded him to take the financial risk and sacrifice involved.

Immediately he began to regret it. Hauser and Son were constantly in dispute and soliciting his vote. Moreover, Roisman had his own issues, in particular involving Hauser and Ipolyi&#x27;s inability to play in spiccato (German &quot;Springbogen&quot;, or with &quot;bouncing&quot; bow), so that the quartet was forced not to use it. The rest of the quartet had had to become expert in using another bowing technique (German &quot;Spitzen&quot;, or staccato at the point, or tip, of the bow) to get around Hauser and Ipolyi&#x27;s lack of spiccato technique. Roisman found it very hard to readjust his bowing style accordingly. He had to spend many hours practicing, and was unhappy with the result. In Germany, the quartet was called &quot;das Spitzenquartett&quot; (not a compliment) because it substituted &quot;Spitzen&quot; (staccato) for &quot;Springbogen&quot; (spiccato).

===Harry Son – cellist===

Finally, in 1930/31, Son could stand the persistent arguments no longer and resigned. He emigrated to Palestine, and played in concerts there and abroad. Shortly before World War II, however, he made the unfortunate decision to return to Rotterdam. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands, he and his wife Marianne were arrested in Amsterdam, and died in 1942 in the notorious Auschwitz-Monowitz concentration camp.

===Mischa Schneider – cellist===

The new cellist was originally named Mojzesz Sznejder, later Germanized as &#x27;Mischa Schneider&#x27;. Born in 1904 in Vilna, Russia (though some place it in Poland at that time) (now Vilnius, Lithuania), where celebrated violin virtuoso Jascha Heifetz was born in 1901, he had a difficult upbringing. The family had little money, and his father was a tyrant. Mischa often found himself defending his younger brother Sasha against their father. In 1920, at the age of 16, Mischa left home to study in Leipzig under Julius Klengel, his teacher&#x27;s eminent teacher. Fellow students included Emanuel Feuermann, Gregor Piatigorsky and Jascha&#x27;s cousin Benar Heifetz. After graduating he moved to Frankfurt, where he taught at the Hoch Conservatory. He found that he suffered from stage fright when playing solo, a problem that did not exist when playing in a quartet. He joined the Prisca Quartet, but resigned after a while due to a personality clash with two of the other members. The Prisca had often played in Cologne and there he got to know the Reifenbergs, whose daughter Eva had married Emanuel Feuermann. It was Frau Reifenberg who introduced Schneider to the Budapest Quartet.

===American debut===

In January and February 1931, the quartet made its first United States tour. Reviews were fairly good, but financially the tour was unrewarding. Arguments about &quot;Spitzen&quot; vs. &quot;Springbogen&quot; bowing and other matters persisted, and relations became difficult. Then in 1932, Hauser wanted to play some concerts with Alice Ehlers. The quartet refused to allow this deviation from the rules; there was an argument and he resigned. He emigrated to Jerusalem, formed a quartet and founded the Palestine Music Conservatory. He helped eminent Polish-Jewish concert violinist Bronisław Huberman rescue many Jews from Austria, Czechoslovakia and Germany, and was instrumental in founding the Palestine Symphony Orchestra. In 1940 he moved to the U.S., teaching first at Bard College in upper New York State, and later at the Juilliard School of Music. Hauser returned to Israel in 1960, where he died in 1978 at the age of 84.

===Roisman becomes the leader and Alexander Schneider the second violinist===

Having lost Hauser, the quartet needed a new leader. Introducing an unknown player as first violin is a risky step for a quartet. Owing to the established relationships and &#x27;comfort level&#x27;, a transition from second violin to first is safer. For this reason, Roisman was persuaded to make the switch from second to first.

The new second was Mischa Schneider&#x27;s younger brother Alexander (Sasha), born Abram Sznejder. At 13, he almost died of tetanus after an accidental knee injury. The tetanus distorted his joints, and recovery was long and painful. Sasha left Vilna in 1924 and joined his brother in Frankfurt, securing a scholarship to study violin with Adolf Rebner, the principal violin pedagogue at the Hoch Conservatory. In 1927, Alexander became leader (concertmaster) of an orchestra in Saarbrücken; and in 1929, leader of the Norddeutscher Rundfunk Orchestra in Hamburg until 1932, when he was fired as a consequence of the ongoing Nazi campaign against Jews. It was time for him to leave Germany, and the Budapest vacancy happened at just the right moment.

After Sasha&#x27;s arrival, the Quartet&#x27;s level of performance improved immediately and the group began attracting larger audiences. Successful tours of the U.S., Dutch East Indies, Australia and New Zealand ensued; and in exchange for relocating to Australia, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation guaranteed the quartet six months of work a year. Still, personal relations within the Quartet were poor. Sasha was often outvoted; he hated this, but Ipolyi was usually able to pacify him. Ipolyi himself had personal problems, Mischa had divorced his wife and remarried, and the group was still not profitable.

By 1934, Jews had been expelled from all German orchestras but the Quartet, as &#x27;Hungarian&#x27; visitors, had been spared until one night, when they received threats from a Nazi group. They switched headquarters from Berlin to Paris overnight, never to return to Germany. They toured Europe and the U.S., but always lived in inexpensive hotels and ate cheaply.

===Last founding member leaves===

Ipolyi became an isolated member of the quartet, the only Hungarian among three Russians. He was also the only &quot;Spitzen&quot; player left, old-fashioned in style and on the verge of a nervous breakdown as well. In 1936, the others persuaded him to resign. He settled in Norway, and during the German occupation was arrested but freed thanks to the intervention of Count Bernadotte, head of the International Red Cross. He fled to Sweden, but returned to Norway after the war. He became a Norwegian citizen, coached a quartet in Bergen and became a professor. Mischa Schneider made sure that Ipolyi received the royalties due him until the latter&#x27;s death in 1955.

===Boris Kroyt becomes violist===

Finding a new violist to replace Ipolyi was urgent. The Australian Broadcast Corporation had engaged the Quartet for a twenty-week tour to start in May 1937 with four performances a week and the option of another ten weeks in New Zealand. They needed the money despite regular engagements in Europe and America. Roisman nearly hired Edgar Ortenberg, whom he had known when they were both children in Odessa and then again in Berlin in 1926, but Ortenberg&#x27;s wife wanted him to stick to the violin. Roisman then tried to locate his teenage friend Boris Kroyt in Berlin. Until the Nazis became all-powerful Kroyt had lived well, but the Nazis stopped all Jews from working except in Jewish groups. He had a wife and a child to support, and they were all in danger. The Budapest offer came at the ideal moment. He was such a natural player that he could get away without practicing very much. They took time to get used to one another, but eventually attained a very high technical standard.

In November 1936, they reached New York and critics were impressed as never before, comparing them with Toscanini and Schnabel. Concerts were well attended. In spring 1937 they went on to Australia, New Zealand and Dutch East Indies with equally good results. When the time came to return to Europe, they considered settling in Australia and held a vote on it. The Spanish Civil War had closed many venues in Italy and all in Spain. The Schneiders voted for Australia, while the other two opted to move on. In accordance with their longstanding rule, a tie meant &quot;no change&quot; so they moved on. After playing in France and Britain, they reached New York again in March 1938.

All the U.S. concerts were negotiated by Annie Friedberg in New York. This continued throughout their time in the U.S., starting with very little money but eventually ending with excellent returns for them and her.

They had made five U.S. tours with no difficulty, but this time they were refused entry. Their Nansen passports were not good enough, apparently. They were ignominiously carted off to Ellis Island in a coal barge. It took frantic string-pulling by Friedberg – involving Mayor La Guardia – to get them out just in time for their first concert. They weren&#x27;t in optimal condition for a concert and thought their performance wasn&#x27;t too good, but nonetheless they got a rave review from &quot;The New York Times&quot;. This, finally, opened the door to real success in the U.S. Suddenly all the critics were praising them as never before, and audiences and bookings flooded in. Considering the Munich Agreement of 1938 when Chamberlain appeased Hitler and what soon happened in Europe, the break came just in time.

On April 25, 1938, they recorded the Mozart Clarinet Quintet with Benny Goodman for the Victor label. It sold well, although Goodman regretted not having first performed it live. He and the quartet made only three concerts together: October and November 1938 and August 1941. Each time, reviewers justifiably felt the result accurate (i.e., merely perfunctory) but uninspired as hoped for and expected.

In 1939 they again had good results in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Norway and Britain but not in Spain and Italy, where fascism reigned and people were consequently more concerned with political issues. From the U.S., the group was commissioned to play five Stradivarius string instruments which needed regular use as part of the instrument collection at the Washington Library of Congress. These instruments had been purchased and donated by longtime influential contributor Gertrude Clarke Whittall. The recital hall on the grounds of the Library had been built in 1925 with funding donated by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, a major benefactress of chamber music and of several music festivals. At that time, the quartet felt it would keep them away from troublesome existing conditions in war-torn Europe.

===U.S. becomes the home base===

In the summer they were back in the U.S. for three months at Mills College in Oakland, California, where they could relax. The Pro Arte Quartet was normally in summer residence there, but this year they preferred to stay in their home territory of Belgium. They never returned, their leader Alphonse Onnou died suddenly in Milwaukee during an American tour, and the Budapest resided at Mills for the next fifteen summers. The first summer there, they learned that World War II had broken out in Europe, where their contracts had consequently been voided. The Library of Congress offer now sounded quite attractive, and they accepted it. Their concerts there continued for many years, and the Library was an extremely important venue for them.

Since 1925 they had been making recordings for His Master&#x27;s Voice, first at the Beethoven Saal in Berlin, then at the Abbey Road Studio in London and from 1938 on in Camden, New Jersey for RCA Victor, the U.S. subsidiary of His Master&#x27;s Voice. The His Master&#x27;s Voice contract was valid until June 1940. It was not paying well, RCA had a good stock of recordings not yet published and was not keen to make any more recordings in 1939. The quartet found it difficult to persuade RCA to give them as much work as they wanted, or to pay them as their new reputation might justify. Nor was RCA eager to extend the existing contract. The quartet felt that with their increasing reputation in the U.S., it could do better signing with, and recording for, Columbia Records. Columbia was delighted to sign the group and make as many recordings as the quartet wished, since it had no existing stock. The deal was made, and kept secret as long as possible. When RCA finally learned about it they protested, &quot;We are astonished. ... [this is] close to a definite breach of faith.&quot; They should have realized that they had no right to be the only negotiators in a deal. Over 35 years the quartet recorded 89 individual works, some of them several times. For many years it was Columbia&#x27;s leading classical music seller, and so quite a loss to RCA.

Early on, however, there were difficulties. First the American Federation of Musicians, protecting American jobs, demanded that someone should pay two members to be &quot;standbys&quot; during recordings. The quartet and Columbia argued about which of them should pay. After this was settled, the AFM struck Columbia in a dispute over royalties that lasted until February 1945. Also, after war was declared, the U.S. Government rationed materials for making records. Even so, between 1941 and 1946, the quartet earned $60,000 from Columbia in royalties in addition to $16,000 from HMV.

===Alexander Schneider replaced by Edgar Ortenberg===

Sasha felt he could and needed to work outside the quartet. As second violinist, he did not get the same challenges or independence as the leader. After thinking about this a lot, he finally reached his decision and told the others on November 26, 1943. He was still only 35, having spent eleven years in the quartet, and needed to expand his range. On January 1, 1944 the quartet selected the new second, Edgar Ortenberg, the man who had nearly become the violist a decade before.

Like Joe and Boris, Edgar had grown up in Odessa. Until the Russian Revolution his father had been a bank manager, but afterwards the Ortenbergs were very short of money. In 1921 he won the gold medal at the Odessa Conservatory, and was immediately hired to teach there. In 1924 he moved to Berlin for greener pastures just as Joe, the Schneiders, and Boris had done, where he immediately got a scholarship at the Hochschule für Musik. He changed his name from Eleazer to Edgar, and started a quartet which toured Europe until 1933 when the Nazis sacked them all. He then quickly moved to Paris, where the Russian Conservatory there formed a quartet under his leadership which had some success in Europe. When war was threatened, he joined the French army but in April 1940 (just before the disastrous defeat by the invading Germans) was discharged due to illness, and he and his wife left Paris just ahead of the Germans. They went to Portugal and caught the very last Spanish ship departing for the U.S. After struggling in New York for some time, he received that second offer from the Budapest Quartet in December 1943 and this time accepted it.

Edgar was generally considered a fine replacement for Sasha except that some critics and all the players felt he should play more forcibly. On the other hand, he felt their playing was a bit rough. He also wanted to spend more time rehearsing since he needed to get used to their methods and accustomed to their large repertory. The others, especially Boris, were not so keen to rehearse. It took Edgar two years to feel fully at home, but still the others felt he should practice more on his own and he was becoming noticeably nervous. Critics still felt the quartet was wonderful, but not quite as good as before. Ortenberg was also exhausted by the constant traveling, and late in 1948 the others told him they wanted a different second violinist. As soon as it was made public, Ortenberg was swamped by other offers and last performed with the quartet on March 10, 1949 at Cornell University. He joined the Settlement Music School in Philadelphia, where he remained until his retirement in 1984. He also taught at Temple University from 1953 to 1978.

===Jac Gorodetzky===

The new second violinist was Jac Gorodetzky. He was born in Odessa but the family moved to London when he was only one, to avoid a pogrom. They moved to the U.S. before the war, settling in Philadelphia. He was well thought of as a student and secured good positions in orchestras and quartets. Although his playing, like Ortenberg&#x27;s, was a little quiet, he was well thought of during the Budapest auditions, when in his mid-thirties.

In 1950, the quartet went to Europe for the first time after the war. They agreed not to go to Germany, especially because Schneider had lost his mother and sister in Auschwitz. This tour, together with the continual demands in the U.S., heavily stressed Gorodetzky. He developed stage fright, and sometimes pleaded for extra rehearsals of works they had already played.

Then in September 1952, they played in Japan as the first quartet to tour there after the war. The whole season was sold out in two hours. Three thousand attended their first concert. There were staff to attend to their every need, and cars to take them everywhere. One night they felt the need to get some exercise in Okayama. They were walking on a narrow road, when Joe fell into a nine-foot ditch and broke his left wrist. They had it set at the U.S. military hospital in Tokyo. On their return to the U.S., they were told the wrist had been improperly set and had to be re=broken and reset. Concerts were switched to trios and piano quartets during Roisman&#x27;s recovery. After months of hard work, he rejoined the quartet in Portland, Oregon on January 12, 1953.

A second Japanese tour in 1954 was even more successful, but Jac was getting more uncomfortable. In February, he told the others he wanted to leave. They hoped to talk him out of it, but none of them realized how unwell he was. Finally, in November 1955, he committed suicide in a small hotel in Washington. The other players felt awful, and played benefit concerts for his family at the Settlement Music School. Later, Mischa left them most of his music and on his death Joe left them most of his money.

===Alexander Schneider returns===

Joe refused to accept another new second violinist, and fortunately they managed to persuade Sasha to return. Against their prior rule, they allowed him to spend some time working independently because they needed him and they did not want to take as many engagements as before. As soon as he returned, they all felt happier than they had for many years, their playing showed resultant rejuvenated strength and the critics were fulsome in their praise.

In the ten years away from the quartet, Sasha had been very busy. He rejected offers to lead the Pro Arte and Paganini Quartets, but toured and recorded with harpsichordist Ralph Kirkpatrick, played and recorded unaccompanied Bach, and played and recorded trios and piano quartets with prominent New York chamber players. He studied with Pablo Casals in Prades, whom he persuaded to start festivals in Prades, San Juan (Puerto Rico), Israel and Marlboro (Vermont). He started his own Schneider Quartet to record all the Haydn quartets for the Haydn Society label, although the Society ran out of money before the project was finished. He persuaded Mrs Coolidge to sponsor free outdoor concerts in Greenwich Village, and played guest second violin with the Budapesters when Ortenberg or Gorodetzky was indisposed.

===Decline===

As the 1960s approached, the quartet was quite happy. It was the most popular and world-famous quartet, with 55 record albums published by Columbia and two million copies sold, and was playing in many famous venues and festivals. But then Joe&#x27;s intonation began to fail him at times, apparently in the aftermath of a mild heart attack at the end of 1960. Only then did he tell the others that as long ago as 1939, he had been told of a problem with high blood pressure. He had occasionally had intonation problems before, which worsened late in 1960.

In March 1962, they played their final concert in the Library of Congress in the aftermath of several problems of which Joe&#x27;s intonation had been the worst. Critics, listeners and Mrs Coolidge herself had complained. They were replaced by the brilliant young Juilliard Quartet of New York. That autumn, in Europe, Joe suddenly suffered a slipped disc. He restarted playing in early 1963, however, and they returned to Australia after a 26-year absence. But Joe&#x27;s energy level was declining, and they cut down the number of concerts year by year.

===Marlboro College===

In 1955, Sasha had joined the Marlboro Music School and Festival at Marlboro College in southern Vermont (see above). It was a school, a music festival and a summer retreat. Like a human whirlwind, he pushed the young players to stretch their talents. In time, he brought in the other Budapest players (see below), who helped make the place a breeding ground for a new generation of chamber musicians. The school had been founded in 1950 by incomparable chamber violinist Adolf Busch and eminent flautist Marcel Moyse, and their families. Busch died in 1952 before Sasha arrived, but his son-in-law, pianist Rudolf Serkin, was still quite active and he and Sasha became staunch friends, the latter spending the next twenty summers there.

In 1962 Sasha persuaded Mischa to come too, and the next year the whole quartet came, followed by many other outstanding experienced musicians and many talented younger players, all reaching high standards. Some students found Sasha assertive to the point of aggressively demanding, and his manner was a bit hard on those who were nervous or not dedicated to strive for the highest standards, while Mischa and Boris were gentler. They were very willing to try new ideas from their students, and each generation was inspired by the enthusiasm of the other.

Sasha persuaded Michael Tree, Arnold Steinhardt, John Dalley and David Soyer to form a brilliant new quartet – a daunting challenge for any player – and Boris suggested the name Guarneri. They spent a lot of time together at Marlboro, and the Guarneri Quartet may be regarded as the musical heirs of the Budapest. Sasha advised them, &quot;Whenever you play string trios and piano quartets, make it a rule that the second violin plays it and not the first. ... If you play only second violin, you get stale for other things.&quot; He said that, after he left the Budapest, it took him three years to get back to good playing condition. The newest super-virtuosic New York group, the Emerson String Quartet, takes a similar view, and solves it by the two violinists, Eugene Drucker and Philip Setzer, alternating between first and second.

In later years, the Budapest played fewer concerts and saw each other only for concerts, but still to admiring capacity audiences, but no longer practiced very often either individually or together. Errors in detail were the inevitable result, but the general effect was still good. Sasha felt he wanted to share what he was still learning, but Joe wanted to stay as he was.

===Conclusion===

In January 1965 the group spent twelve days recording Dvořák&#x27;s F major &quot;American&quot; Quartet and Smetana&#x27;s E minor Quartet &quot;From My Life&quot;. Joe had major intonation problems during the sessions, and Mischa had trouble with his back. A recording of the Dvořák was spliced together from multiple takes and published, but the players refused to accept a similar splice of the Smetana. Then Mischa, Boris and the Guarneri performed and recorded Tchaikovsky&#x27;s D minor Sextet &quot;Souvenir de Florence&quot; with success. Immediately thereafter Mischa needed back surgery, which had troubled him since 1930. The operation failed, as did a second procedure. He never played again but he did teach extensively, including 25 summers at the Marlboro Music Festival, until his death on October 3, 1985 in Buffalo, New York.

In 1977, Sasha abruptly left Marlboro. He never explained why, but he and Serkin remained fast friends. In 1969, Boris died of cancer. In 1974, Joe suffered a fatal heart attack. In 1993 Sasha succumbed to heart failure, having played almost to the end.

The Budapest String Quartet had a huge influence on chamber music in the United States and internationally. When they relocated to the U.S. in the late 1930s, it was hard to attract large audiences. The concerts in Washington and New York, the radio broadcasts and the many records gradually raised audience numbers, made them famous and wealthy, and set high performance standards for later quartet and other chamber groups to follow and even improve upon.

Their many recordings were highly regarded, and in 1977 a Budapest String Quartet recording of the &quot;Cavatina&quot; from Beethoven&#x27;s Quartet No. 13 in B flat major, Op. 130 was selected by NASA to be included on the Voyager Golden Record, a gold-plated copper record that was sent into space on the Voyager space craft. The record contained sounds and images which had been selected as examples of the diversity of life and culture on Earth.

Jascha Heifetz was once quoted as saying: &quot;One Russian is an anarchist. Two Russians are a chess game. Three Russians are a revolution. Four Russians are the Budapest String Quartet.&quot;

== Recordings ==

The following listings begin with 1932; this is the year in which Josef Roisman became the quartet&#x27;s leader as 1st Violin, replacing Emil Hauser, and Alexander Schneider joined the quartet as 2nd violin. Thus with the exception of István Ipolyi, who stayed until 1936, the quartet had nearly completed its transformation to its relatively stable line-up of four Russians, and achieved its long-lasting reputation.

Although most entries in the following lists are taken either from actual LPs and CDs and their liner notes or from trustworthy print or online sources, the lists are supplemented by a discography prepared by Sony Classical, apparently for their own use in identifying stock numbers. However this Sony discography contains a number of errors in identifying recording dates, personnel, and in some instances even compositions and composers. All information from this Sony discography as shown below that could not be verified from another source is preceded by an asterisk [*] as being possibly questionable.

Square brackets indicate the initials of the violist, or of the second violinist; e.g., [Va=II] indicates István Ipolyi as violist. Several recording dates are either unspecified or unknown. All of the earlier recordings were first issued as shellac 78 rpm records, many later reissued as vinyl LPs, and subsequently in CD format. First issue of the late recordings was directly to LP format. All recordings are monophonic unless specified as stereo.

<text>John Parricida () or John the [[Parricide]], also called John of Swabia (&quot;Johann von Schwaben&quot;), (ca. 1290 – 13 December 1312/13) was the son of the Habsburg duke Rudolf II of Austria and Agnes, daughter of King Ottokar II of Bohemia. By killing his uncle, King Albert I of Germany, he foiled the first attempt of the Habsburg dynasty to install a hereditary monarchy in the Holy Roman Empire.

==Life==
John was born shortly before or after the death of his father Rudolf II, the younger son of King Rudolf I of Germany. His mother was Agnes, daughter of King Ottokar II of Bohemia. He passed his early days at the Bohemian court and the town of Brugg in the Swabian home territory of the Habsburgs, where he is mentioned as titular duke in a 1294 deed. As John&#x27;s father had been forced to waive his right to the Habsburg duchies of Austria and Styria in favour of his elder brother Albert I according to the 1283 Treaty of Rheinfelden, he felt deprived of his inheritance. When he came of age, he demanded a portion of the family estates from his uncle, who had finally prevailed in the election as King of the Romans against Adolph of Nassau in 1298. His wishes, however, were not granted nor did he receive any of the compensations in the Swabian territories of Further Austria, awarded to his father by the Rheinfelden Treaty. In 1306, King Albert even placed his son, Duke Rudolf III, on the Bohemian throne, denying his nephew&#x27;s right of inheritance. Thereupon John, mocked as &quot;Duke Lackland&quot; (&quot;Hertzog Anlant&quot;), with several companions of Swabian nobility formed a plan to murder the king.

A Habsburg family banquet in Winterthur, held by Albert on the evening of 30 April 1308, gave rise to a scandal, when the invitee John rejected a floral wreath offered by his uncle, exclaiming that he would not be fobbed off with flowers. The next day, King Albert on his way home became separated from his attendants when crossing the Reuss River near Windisch, and was at once attacked by John and his conspirators. John rode toward his uncle and split his skull without a word. He escaped the vengeance of Albert&#x27;s sons, and from that point his fate remained unknown. In the same year, the prince-electors chose the Luxembourg count Henry VII as Albert&#x27;s successor, who placed John under the imperial ban (&quot;Reichsacht&quot;). John allegedly fled to Italy and found refuge in a Pisa monastery, where, in 1313, he is said to have been visited by Emperor Henry VII. After the defeat of Albert&#x27;s son Frederick the Fair at the 1322 Battle of Mühldorf, the Habsburg dynasty was not able to regain the German crown until the election of Albert II in 1438.

==Fictional character==
The character of John is rendered by Friedrich Schiller in his 1804 drama &quot;William Tell&quot;: John on the run arrives at Tell&#x27;s house begging for help and arguing that he had to take revenge on his enemy — like Tell on bailiff Albrecht Gessler. Tell rejects the comparison but directs him to Italy, advising him to seek papal absolution.

John&#x27;s fate was further perpetuated in the poem &quot;Der Graf von Thal&quot; (1838) by Annette von Droste-Hülshoff and by the Austrian writer Johann Nepomuk Vogl, whose ballad &quot;Der Mönch zu Pisa&quot; was set to music by Carl Loewe (Op. 114) in 1846. Historical dramas were written by August Gottlieb Meißner (&quot;Johann von Schwaben&quot;, 1770) and Julius Grosse (&quot;Johann von Schwaben&quot;, 1870).

<text>Aslaug ( ), also called Aslög, Kráka (O.N.: ) or Kraba, is a figure in Norse mythology who appears in Snorri&#x27;s Edda, the Völsunga saga and in the saga of Ragnar Lodbrok as one of his wives.

==Aslaug in legend==

According to the 13th-century &quot;Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok&quot;, Aslaug was the daughter of Sigurd and the shieldmaiden Brynhildr, but was raised by Brynhildr&#x27;s foster father Heimer. At the deaths of Sigurd and Brynhildr, Heimer was concerned about Aslaug&#x27;s security, so he made a harp large enough to hide the girl. He then traveled as a poor harp player carrying the harp containing the girl.
They arrived at Spangereid at Lindesnes in Norway, where they stayed for the night in the house of the peasants Áke and Grima. Áke believed the harp contained valuable items and told his wife Grima. Grima then persuaded him to murder Heimer as he was sleeping. However, when they broke the harp open, they discovered a little girl, whom they raised as their own, calling her Kráka (&quot;Crow&quot;). In order to hide her beauty – the accepted sign of her noble origins – they rubbed her in tar and dressed her in a long hood.

However, once as she was bathing, she was discovered by some of the men of the legendary king Ragnar Lodbrok. Entranced by Kráka&#x27;s beauty, they allowed the bread they were baking to burn; when Ragnar inquired about this mishap, they told him about the girl. Ragnar then sent for her, but in order to test her wits, he commanded her to arrive neither dressed nor undressed, neither fasting nor eating, and neither alone nor in company. Kráka arrived dressed in a net, biting an onion, and with only a dog as a companion. Impressed by her ingenuity and finding her wise, Ragnar proposed marriage to her, which she refused until he had accomplished his mission in Norway 

==Scholarship==
According to Marilyn Jurich, Aslaug&#x27;s tale in the &quot;Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok&quot; is the prototype of the &quot;Clever Peasant Girl&quot; folk tale, Aarne–Thompson No. 875. The saga matches the tale closely up to Aslaug&#x27;s marriage to Ragnar, but even after that there are similarities: The saga highlights Aslaug&#x27;s resolve (she refuses sex to Ragnar until after marriage) and her seemingly preternatural wisdom: because Ragnar insists on bedding her immediately after the wedding, contrary to her advice, their first son Ivar was born weak, &quot;boneless&quot;.

The Brothers Grimm discuss the similarities of their tale 1815 No. 8 &quot;Die kluge Bauerntochter,&quot; with the Nordic tale of Kraka in the appendix entry of the text. They also discuss similarities to a tale in Johannes Pauli&#x27;s &quot;Schimpf und Ernst&quot; from 1519 to 1522.

==In other fiction==
The romantic poem &quot;The Fostering of Aslaug&quot; by William Morris is a retelling of Aslaug&#x27;s relationship with Ragnar, based on the version of the tale in Benjamin Thorpe&#x27;s &quot;Northern Mythology&quot; (1851). It is changed in tone and emphasis by Morris&#x27; romanticism, excising the saga&#x27;s more somber and complicated motifs and portraying Ragnar as the typical hero wooing the maiden.

She appears in Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué&#x27;s &quot;Aslauga&#x27;s Knight,&quot; published in 1810 with two other Icelandic romances as &quot;Der Held des Nordens&quot; (The Hero of the North).

A principal character in the television series &quot;Vikings&quot; (2013–2016), played by Alyssa Sutherland, is loosely based on the legend, and introduced to Ragnar in the manner it described.

<text>Georg Dertinger (25 December 1902 – 21 January 1968) was a German politician.

He was born in Berlin into a middle-class Protestant family. Dertinger briefly studied law and economics. After his study he became a journalist and later editor for the &quot;Magdeburger Volkszeitung&quot; and the nationalistic newspaper &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot;. He broke with the Stahlhelm because of its rigid right-wing philosophy. He sympathized with the German National People&#x27;s Party, a right-wing nationalist party.

Dertinger later became a member of the political circle around Chancellor Franz von Papen. He accompanied Papen to Rome as a journalist, a representative for the Hamburger Nachrichten, for the signature of the &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; between Nazi Germany and the Holy See, shortly after Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power.

In 1934 Dertinger returned to Berlin and became publisher of Dienst aus Deutschland, a news agency that provided news to foreign newspapers.

After World War II Dertinger co-founded the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany. From 1946 to 1949 he was General Secretary of the East-German CDU and from 1949 to 1953 Vice-Chairman of the party. He supported the official line of co-operation with the Socialist Unity Party and opposed the more independent-minded party chairman Jakob Kaiser, whom he had deposed in December 1947.

Dertinger also joined the Cultural Association of the DDR &quot;(Kulturbund)&quot; and was a member of the Cultural Association&#x27;s Presidential Council.

On 11 October 1949 he became East Germany&#x27;s first Minister of Foreign Affairs in Otto Grotewohl&#x27;s cabinet However, he tended to be only a figurehead to secure CDU participation in the SED-dominated National Front and most important decisions would be made by his eventual successor Anton Ackermann. In 1950 he signed the Oder-Neisse Treaty with Poland, that arranged the borderline between East Germany and the Polish People&#x27;s Republic.

On 15 January 1953 Dertinger was arrested due to his allegedly harmful activities against East Germany and in 1954 he was tried on a show trial for espionage, found guilty and sentenced to hard labor (15 years). In 1964 he was given amnesty. The years before his death he worked for the Roman Catholic St. Benno publishing house.

<text>Todd Robert Pearson (born 25 November 1977) is an Australian swimming champion, who was born in Geraldton, Western Australia. He started swimming on the advice of a doctor treating his asthma. Pearson was vice captain of Hale School in 1994 where he spent time in Faulkner House and St George House. He was an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder.

He was no stranger to the Olympic Games. After swimming the heat of the 4×100-metre freestyle relay at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Pearson was a spectator for the final, when the Australians set a world record by beating the US team for the first time in Olympic history. He went on to swim in the final of the 4×200-metre freestyle with Ian Thorpe, Michael Klim and Bill Kirby. The Aussies led from start to finish, setting another world record and achieving every child&#x27;s dream of winning gold for Australia. Pearson was awarded the Order of Australia medal for contribution to sport for this effort. After Sydney in 2000, Pearson won gold medals at the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships and the 2002 Commonwealth Games. He was also co-captain of the Australian swimming team in 2001. Despite swimming more than 50 kilometres a week, Pearson found time to complete a bachelor of commerce degree with a major in accounting and has worked for a multinational accounting firm.

Pearson later represented Australia in the 4×200-metre freestyle relay in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, winning a silver medal.

<doc id="1213250" wikidata="Q2138406" url="?curid=1213250" title="Drain You">
<text>&quot;Drain You&quot; is a song by American rock band Nirvana, written by vocalist and guitarist, Kurt Cobain. It is the eighth track on their second album, &quot;Nevermind&quot;, released in September 1991. The song was released as a promotional single in late 1991, and also appeared as a b-side on UK retail editions of the first single from that album, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;.

A live version, recorded on December 28, 1991, at Del Mar Fairgrounds in Del Mar, California, was released as the second promotional single from the live compilation, &quot;From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah&quot;, in 1996. This version peaked at number 44 on the &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; US Alternative Top 50 chart.

In a 1993 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Cobain cited &quot;Drain You&quot; as one of his favorite songs he had written, saying that it was &quot;definitely as good as&quot; their most popular song, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit.&quot;

==Early history==
Originally titled &quot;Formula,&quot; &quot;Drain You&quot; was written in 1990.

The song was first recorded in the spring of 1991, when Cobain and Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl visited Melvins drummer Dale Crover and his then-girlfriend Debbi Shane in San Francisco, California, on their way to record what became &quot;Nevermind&quot; in Van Nuys. During their visit, the four recorded several songs on a four track, including &quot;Drain You,&quot; under the band name, the Retards. &quot;At the time, Kurt was into starting bands with everybody,&quot; Shane recalled, &quot;so we went to the practice space my band Dumbhead shared with the Melvins, and formed the Retards for two days.&quot;

According to Shane, the band worked on songs by all four members, with one person recording, and Cobain eventually &quot;announced he had a song, which wasn&#x27;t a Nirvana song because it didn&#x27;t have a drum part. When Dale started playing drums, he was like, &#x27;Wow, we have a drum part.&#x27;&quot; The instrumental interlude was also developed during this session, which Shane says changed the song&#x27;s character &quot;from metal to a more Sonic Youth noise thing. With the song&#x27;s structure now in place, the band brought it to the &quot;Nevermind&quot; recording sessions at Sound City Studios in May 1991.

==&quot;Nevermind&quot;==
According to &quot;Nevermind&quot;&#x27;s producer Butch Vig in the 2005 &quot;Classic Albums: Nirvana - Nevermind&quot; DVD, &quot;Drain You&quot; featured more guitar overdubs than any other song on the album: one clean track and five distorted tracks, two using a Mesa Boogie amp, two using a Fender Bassman amp, and one that they called the &quot;super grunge&quot; track, using a pedal on the Fender Bassman.

Due to Cobain&#x27;s reluctance to double track his vocals, Vig says he often falsely claimed that certain parts were not recorded correctly or were out of tune, and needed to be recorded again. Cobain recorded three vocal takes, with all three takes being used throughout the recording.

The sounds during the song&#x27;s interlude were made by Cobain in a variety of ways, including using his squeaky mouse and rubber duck toys that he brought into the studio. Sound engineer Andy Wallace added delay to these sounds to complete the effect.

==Post-&quot;Nevermind&quot;==
On September 3, 1991, the band recorded a version during a John Peel session for the BBC at Maida Vale Studios in London. The full session, which also featured versions of the &quot;Nevermind&quot; hidden track &quot;Endless, Nameless&quot; and then-unreleased &quot;Dumb&quot;, was produced by Dale Griffin, was first broadcast on November 3, 1991.. This version of &quot;Drain You&quot; was posthumously released on the 20th anniversary &quot;Deluxe&quot; and &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; versions of &quot;Nevermind&quot; in September 2011.

In March 1992, a live version, recorded at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle, Washington on October 31, 1991, appeared as a b-side on the second single from &quot;Nevermind&quot;, for the song &quot;Come as You Are&quot;.

A live version, featuring Pat Smear on second guitar, was recorded for the television show &quot;Nulle Part Ailleurs&quot; in Paris, France on February 4, 1994. During the song&#x27;s interlude, Cobain&#x27;s guitar cut out completely, which led to him throwing it to the floor and finishing the song on vocals only.

The final live performance of &quot;Drain You&quot; was at Nirvana&#x27;s last concert, on March 1, 1994, at Terminal Eins in Munich, Germany.

==Composition==

===Music===

&quot;Drain You&quot; is an alternative rock song that runs for a duration of three minutes and forty-three seconds. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by BMG Rights Management, it is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderately fast rock tempo of 134 beats per minute. The song is composed in the key of A major, while Kurt Cobain&#x27;s vocal range spans two octaves and five notes, from the low-note of F#4 to the high-note of B6. The song follows a basic sequence of A5–C#5–F#5–B5 in the verses and alternates between the chords of D5 and B5 during the refrain as its chord progression. The tight musical arrangement begins with Cobain strumming his electric guitar unaccompanied while singing, &quot;One baby to another says I&#x27;m lucky to have met you.&quot; After the song&#x27;s opening lines, there is an arrival of loud distortion alongside a thunderous combination of drums and bass.

===Lyrics===

In the 1993 Nirvana biography &quot;Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana&quot;, Michael Azerrad described &quot;Drain You&quot; as &quot;a love song, or rather a song about love,&quot; in which the babies in the lyrics &quot;represent two people reduced to a state of perfect innocence by their love.&quot; Cobain told Azerrad that the lyrics made him think of &quot;two brat kids who are in the same hospital bed.&quot; The song&#x27;s imagery predicted the medical themes that would feature heavily in the lyrics of Nirvana&#x27;s following album, &quot;In Utero&quot;.

According to the 2001 Cobain biography &quot;Heavier Than Heaven&quot; by Charles Cross, &quot;Drain You&quot; was one of &quot;a half dozen...memorable songs&quot; Cobain wrote following his break-up with American musician, Tobi Vail, in November 1990. Cross described the lyric, &quot;It is now my duty to completely drain you,&quot; as &quot;both an acknowledgement of the power [Vail] had over [Cobain] and an indictment.&quot;

==Release and reception==
According to a February 1997 &quot;Goldmine&quot; article by American journalist Gillian G. Gaar, &quot;Drain You&quot; was originally planned as the second single from &quot;Nevermind&quot;. A promotional single was released in late 1991, but the song &quot;never really was played&quot; on the radio, according to DGC&#x27;s director of publicity Jim Merlis, possibly because it was overshadowed by the popularity of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit.&quot; &quot;Come As You Are&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second commercial single instead in March 1992.

Cobain cited &quot;Drain You&quot; as one of his favorite compositions, telling David Fricke in a 1993 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview that he thought it was as good, if not better, than &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit.&quot; &quot;I love the lyrics, and I never get tired of playing it,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe if it was as big as &#x27;Teen Spirit&#x27;, I wouldn’t like it as much.&quot;

===Legacy===

In 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot;″s William Goodman wrote that &quot;Drain You&quot; was &quot;perhaps the Nevermind tune with the poppiest, most tightly-wound songcraft,&quot; and that &quot;in another context, it could be translated to any number of genres -- but on Nevermind, it&#x27;s perfection.&quot;

In 2013, &quot;Drain You&quot; was voted fifth in &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; reader&#x27;s poll of the top 10 Nirvana songs. In 2015, it was ranked ninth in &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; &quot;No Apologies: All 102 Nirvana Songs Ranked&quot; list. In 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked it ninth on their list of &quot;Nirvana&#x27;s 20 greatest songs&quot;. In 2023, Stephen Thomas Erlewine ranked it at number 15 on &quot;the A.V. Club&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Essential Nirvana: Their 30 greatest songs, ranked&quot; list.

In 2017, to mark what would have been Kurt Cobain&#x27;s 50th birthday, the Phonographic Performance Limited released a list of the top 20 most played Nirvana songs on TV and radio in the U.K., in which &quot;Drain You&quot; was ranked at number 11.

The song&#x27;s title was used for a chapter in &quot;Shakey: Neil Young&#x27;s Biography&quot;, a 2002 biography of Canadian rock musician Neil Young, by Jimmy McDonough. The chapter focused on Young&#x27;s reaction to Cobain&#x27;s suicide, and included an anecdote of Young enjoying a video of Nirvana performing the song at an unnamed concert.

The &quot;Nevermind&quot; version of &quot;Drain You&quot; appears in the video games &quot;Rock Band 2&quot; and &quot;Rock Band Unplugged&quot;.

On April 24, 2020, the song was performed by American musician Post Malone as part of his 15-song Nirvana tribute concert, which was livestreamed on YouTube and raised over $4 million for the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.

==Del Mar Fairgrounds version==

A live version of &quot;Drain You,&quot; recorded on December 28, 1991, at Del Mar Fairgrounds in Del Mar, California, appeared on the live compilation &quot;From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah&quot;, released in October 1996. It was released as the second promotional single from the album, peaking at
number 44 on the US Alternative Top 50 chart which was published by &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;, a sister publication to &quot;Billboard&quot;. This version was the 11th most played song of 1997 on Boston&#x27;s WBCN (FM).

==Music video==

A live version of the song, recorded by MTV at the band&#x27;s &quot;Live and Loud&quot; performance on December 13, 1993, at Pier 48 in Seattle, was released as a music video on MTV2 in November 1996, to support the release of the &quot;From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah&quot; album, even though it was a different version, recorded at Del Mar Fairgrounds in 1991, that actually appeared on the album. No known footage exists of the Del Mar Fairgrounds performance. The video also aired on &quot;Rage&quot;, &quot;Red&quot; and ARC in Australia.

The cover was released as on vinyl as double-A-sided 7-inch single, alongside &quot;Bonnet of Briars.&quot; The single premiered online by &quot;PopMatters&quot;, which called the cover &quot;moving.&quot; &quot;Drain You&quot; was covered by Cincinnati glam rock band Foxy Shazam. Regarding the song, bassist Daisy Caplan stated, &quot;Right away I knew &#x27;Drain You&#x27; would be best for us. We’re more of a vocally oriented band than anything else, and the melody line lets us showcase that.&quot; Admitting that it would&#x27;ve been intimidating to perform one of Nirvana&#x27;s big hit singles, he claims five minutes after choosing the song, the band was &quot;getting drunk and jamming out on it.&quot;  Their cover was included on the 2011 tribute album, &quot;Newermind&quot;, created in celebration of the 20th anniversary the band&#x27;s breakthrough album.

<doc id="1213253" wikidata="Q693566" url="?curid=1213253" title="Treaty of Rheinfelden">
<text>The Treaty of Rheinfelden () was the first Habsburg order of succession, concluded on 1 June 1283 at the Imperial City of Rheinfelden.

Rudolph of Habsburg had been chosen as King of the Romans in 1273 and had defeated his rival Ottokar II of Bohemia who was killed at the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld. Ottokar&#x27;s son Wenceslaus II retained the Bohemian Kingdom, while Ottokar&#x27;s estates in Austria, Styria, Carinthia and Carniola fell back to the Holy Roman Empire.

King Rudolph had reached an agreement with the prince-electors to award these territories to his sons and, at the Diet of Augsburg in 1282, Albert I and his brother Rudolph II &quot;jointly and severally&quot; received Austria, Styria, Carniola and the Windic March. However, in 1286, Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tyrol became Duke of Carinthia as recompensation for supporting King Rudolph against Ottokar, and also received Carniola and the Windic March as fiefs.

Deviating from these decisions, the Rheinfelden Treaty set down the primogeniture order: then eleven-year-old Duke Rudolph II had to waive all his rights to the thrones of Austria and Styria to the benefit of his elder brother Albert I. According to the terms of the agreement, Rudolf should receive some territories in Further Austria in return but was never compensated until his death in 1290. This fact induced his son John Parricida to murder Albert in 1308.

The adoption of the primogeniture right crucially strengthened the Habsburg influence within the Holy Roman Empire as it allowed the dynasty to constitute a compact allodial territory (&quot;Hausmacht&quot;) that it could rely on. It nevertheless did not prevent the partition of the Habsburg lands by the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg.

<doc id="1213266" wikidata="Q71143" url="?curid=1213266" title="Oskar Heinroth">
<text>Oskar Heinroth (1 March 1871 – 31 May 1945) was a German biologist who was one of the first to apply the methods of comparative morphology to animal behavior, and was thus one of the founders of ethology. He worked, largely isolated from most other scientists of the period, at the Berlin Aquarium where he took care of fishes, reptiles and birds, especially waterfowl before he was murdered by Soviet occupying police agents shortly after WW2.

== Biography ==
Heinroth was born in Mainz-Kastel. He studied medicine and graduated in 1895, but later studied zoology at Berlin while working at the Zoological Garden and at the Natural History Museum. He joined an expedition to the Bismarck Archipelago in 1900-1901 serving as a zoologist to Bruno Mencke, the South Seas expedition leader who was attacked and killed in an encounter with indigenous peoples while Heinroth himself escaped with a spear wound. In 1904, Heinroth became an assistant at the Berlin Zoological Garden. He began his studies of duck and goose behavior while working as a scientific assistant from 1898 to 1913. In 1911, he became the director of the Berlin Aquarium, a post he held for more than 30 years. He married Magdalena née Wiebe (1883–1932) who was also interested in animals and was a skilled taxidermist and aviculturist. After her death, Heinroth married Katharina Heinroth née Berger in 1933, a herpetologist who headed the Berlin Zoo after World War II. He died under Soviet interrogation in Berlin on 31 May 1945. Heinroth was largely self taught and was not affiliated to any academic institution but his second wife Katharina had received a doctorate in 1925 under Otto Koehler (1889–1974) and together they published numerous pioneering works on animal behaviour.

== Contributions to zoology ==
Heinroth made extensive studies of behavior in the Anatidae (ducks and geese) and made bold hypotheses that many of their instinctive behavior patterns and morphological features correlated with their life histories. He suggested for instance that the conspicuous wing patterns of ducks might serve to guide flocks in flight. He also recognized that ducks with sexual dimorphism tended to have polygamous males with large testes. Heinroth noted behaviours of ducks and those of hybrids and suggested that their behavioural cues could be used to deduce taxonomic relationships. Heinroth had noted that chickens were alarmed by long-tailed and short-necked birds suggesting that these were the key characteristics of birds of prey. The idea that this response was instinctive was examined in greater detail by Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen. He also rediscovered the phenomenon of imprinting, reported in the 19th century by Douglas Spalding but not followed up at the time. His results were popularized by Konrad Lorenz, his pupil. Heinroth introduced the word &quot;ethologie&quot;, as it is currently understood, in his 1910 &quot;Beitrage zur Biologie, namentlich Ethologie und Psychologie der Anatiden.&quot; Lorenz regarded Heinroth as the true founder of the study of animal behavior seen as a branch of zoology. Lorenz also credited Heinroth with creating an important method for understanding instincts in birds.

==In popular culture==
Heinroth features in the book &quot;The Case of the &#x27;Hail Mary&#x27; Celeste&quot; by Malcolm Pryce, particularly with reference to his work on imprinting. The book also refers to a fictional &quot;Heinroth Prize&quot;.

<doc id="1213269" wikidata="Q5094002" url="?curid=1213269" title="Chestnut Street Incident">
<text>Chestnut Street Incident is the debut studio album by the American singer-songwriter John Mellencamp, and his first of six albums in which Mellencamp was credited as Johnny (later John) Cougar. It was released by MCA Records on October 1, 1976.

Signing on with David Bowie&#x27;s manager, Tony Defries, Mellencamp travelled to New York City to cut this first album. DeFries would also go on to produce the album as well. With the thinking that a name like &quot;Mellencamp&quot; wouldn&#x27;t generate a lot of interest, DeFries changed Mellencamp&#x27;s name to &quot;Johnny Cougar.&quot; Mellencamp would later go on to say that he had no idea about the name change until he saw the final product and that nobody had ever called him &quot;Johnny&quot; before. It would take Mellencamp 15 years to have his full real name on an album, &quot;Whenever We Wanted&quot;, in 1991.

Five of the tracks are covers from the &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s, and six are original songs by Mellencamp. The 1998 Original Masters rerelease added two bonus songs that were also covers. The album sold 12,000 copies when it was originally released, which would lead to MCA&#x27;s refusal to release his next album, &quot;The Kid Inside&quot;, and drop Mellencamp.

The 2009 CD reissue by Cherry Red Records added six bonus tracks recorded during the original album sessions.

<text>Micronization is the process of reducing the average diameter of a solid material&#x27;s particles. Traditional techniques for micronization focus on mechanical means, such as milling and grinding. Modern techniques make use of the properties of supercritical fluids and manipulate the principles of solubility.

The term micronization usually refers to the reduction of average particle diameters to the micrometer range, but can also describe further reduction to the nanometer scale. Common applications include the production of active chemical ingredients, foodstuff ingredients, and pharmaceuticals. These chemicals need to be micronized to increase efficacy.

==Traditional techniques==
Traditional micronization techniques are based on friction to reduce particle size. Such methods include milling, bashing and grinding. A typical industrial mill is composed of a cylindrical metallic drum that usually contains steel spheres. As the drum rotates the spheres inside collide with the particles of the solid, thus crushing them towards smaller diameters. In the case of grinding, the solid particles are formed when the grinding units of the device rub against each other while particles of the solid are trapped in between.

Methods like crushing and cutting are also used for reducing particle diameter, but produce more rough particles compared to the two previous techniques (and are therefore the early stages of the micronization process). Crushing employs hammer-like tools to break the solid into smaller particles by means of impact. Cutting uses sharp blades to cut the rough solid pieces into smaller ones.

==Modern techniques==
Modern methods use supercritical fluids in the micronization process. These methods use supercritical fluids to induce a state of supersaturation, which leads to precipitation of individual particles. The most widely applied techniques of this category include the RESS process (Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions), the SAS method (Supercritical Anti-Solvent) and the PGSS method (Particles from Gas Saturated Solutions). These modern techniques allow for greater tuneability of the process. Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) is a commonly used medium in micronization processes. This is because scCO2 is not very reactive and has easily accessible critical point state parameters. As a result, scCO2 can be effectively used to obtain pure crystalline or amorphous micronized forms. Parameters like relative pressure and temperature, solute concentration, and antisolvent to solvent ratio are varied to adjust the output to the producer&#x27;s needs. Control of particle size in micronization can be influenced by macroscopic factors, such as geometric parameters of the spray nozzle and flow rate, and molecular level changes due to adjustments in state parameters. These adjustments can lead to the nucleation of particles of varying sizes by polymorphic or amorphous transformations, as well as due to the characteristics of aggregation processes, which in some cases is accompanied by changes in conformational equilibria. The supercritical fluid methods result in finer control over particle diameters, distribution of particle size and consistency of morphology. Because of the relatively low pressure involved, many supercritical fluid methods can incorporate thermolabile materials. Modern techniques involve renewable, nonflammable and nontoxic chemicals.

=== RESS ===
In the case of RESS (Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions), the supercritical fluid is used to dissolve the solid material under high pressure and temperature, thus forming a homogeneous supercritical phase. Thereafter, the mixture is expanded through a nozzle to form the smaller particles. Immediately upon exiting the nozzle, rapid expansion occurs, lowering the pressure. The pressure will drop below supercritical pressure, causing the supercritical fluid - usually carbon dioxide - to return to the gas state. This phase change severely decreases the solubility of the mixture and results in precipitation of particles. The less time it takes the solution to expand and the solute to precipitate, the narrower the particle size distribution will be. Faster precipitation times also tend to result in smaller particle diameters.

=== SAS ===
In the SAS method (Supercritical Anti-Solvent), the solid material is dissolved in an organic solvent. The supercritical fluid is then added as an antisolvent, which decreases the solubility of the system. As a result, particles of small diameter are formed. There are various submethods to SAS which differ in the method of introduction of the supercritical fluid into the organic solution.

=== PGSS ===
In the PGSS method (Particles from Gas Saturated Solutions) the solid material is melted and the supercritical fluid is dissolved in it. However, in this case the solution is forced to expand through a nozzle, and in this way nanoparticles are formed. The PGSS method has the advantage that because of the supercritical fluid, the melting point of the solid material is reduced. Therefore, the solid melts at a lower temperature than the normal melting temperature at ambient pressure.

==Applications==
Pharmaceuticals and foodstuff ingredients are the main industries in which micronization is utilized. Particles with reduced diameters have higher dissolution rates, which increases efficacy. Progesterone, for example, can be micronized by making very tiny crystals of the progesterone. Micronized progesterone is manufactured in a laboratory from plants. It is available for use as HRT, infertility treatment, progesterone deficiency treatment, including dysfunctional uterine bleeding in premenopausal women. Compounding pharmacies can supply micronized progesterone in sublingual tablets, oil caps, or transdermal creams. Creatine is among the other drugs that are micronized.

<text>Chester William Powers, Jr. (October 7, 1937 – November 16, 1994) was an American singer-songwriter, and under the stage names Dino Valenti or Dino Valente, one of the lead singers of the rock group Quicksilver Messenger Service. As a songwriter, he was known as Jesse Oris Farrow. He is best known for having written the quintessential 1960s love-and-peace anthem &quot;Get Together&quot;, and for writing and singing on Quicksilver Messenger Service&#x27;s two best-known songs, &quot;Fresh Air&quot; and &quot;What About Me?&quot;

==History==
Before serving in the United States Air Force and playing in the coffeehouses of Boston and Provincetown, Massachusetts, Powers had already performed as &quot;Dino Valenti&quot; with small rock bands in New England lounges.

In the early 1960s, he performed in Greenwich Village and North Beach coffeehouses such as the Cock &#x27;n&#x27; Bull and the Cafe Wha? at the height of the American folk-music revival, often with fellow singer-songwriter Fred Neil, and occasionally with Karen Dalton, Bob Dylan, Lou Gossett, Josh White, Len Chandler, Paul Stookey, David Crosby and others. He influenced other performers, most notably Richie Havens, who continued to perform some of Powers&#x27; early &quot;train songs&quot;. Powers was prevented from acquiring a cabaret license due to an earlier arrest, a requirement that was beginning to be imposed on Village entertainers at the time.

By 1963, Valenti/Powers moved to Los Angeles, where many luminaries in the imminent folk rock movement had already begun to coalesce. During this period, he wrote and popularized &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together&quot;. Frequently covered as &quot;Get Together&quot;, the song was performed by a diverse array of groups throughout the decade, including The Kingston Trio, We Five, The Back Porch Majority, The Dave Clark Five, H. P. Lovecraft, Jefferson Airplane and in particular The Youngbloods, whose 1967 rendition peaked at No. 5 and attained a RIAA gold certification in the United States upon its 1969 re-release (prompted in part by the National Conference of Christians and Jews employing the song as their theme in television and radio commercials). He also popularized and controversially claimed the copyright of Billy Roberts&#x27;s &quot;Hey Joe&quot;.

Valenti/Powers then returned to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he recorded for Autumn Records (an acetate of these sessions exists in a Quicksilver collector&#x27;s possession), though no album was ever issued. He had been friendly with Roger McGuinn in Los Angeles and drummer Michael Clarke played in a band with Valenti/Powers in Big Sur before joining McGuinn in The Byrds. He also played in an early (albeit undesignated) line-up of the San Francisco psychedelic rock group Quicksilver Messenger Service when John Cipollina, David Freiberg, and Jim Murray all joined his backing group in 1964.

Powers&#x27; career was blighted by several drug busts. After an arrest for possession of marijuana, he was searched again by police (who found more marijuana and amphetamines in his apartment) while awaiting trial. He received a one-to-ten-year sentence served in part at Folsom State Prison. To raise money for his defense, he sold the publishing rights for &quot;Get Together&quot; to Frank Werber, the manager of The Kingston Trio. While in prison, the Quicksilver Messenger Service recorded Valenti/Powers&#x27;s song &quot;Dino&#x27;s Song&quot;, which was released on the Quicksilver Messenger Service (album) in 1968.

After completing his sentence, Valenti/Powers signed with CBS&#x27;s Epic Records, releasing an eponymous solo album under a variation of his pseudonym (&quot;Dino Valente&quot;) in 1968. Shortly thereafter, he served as the opening act for Jimi Hendrix at San Francisco&#x27;s Winterland Ballroom from October 10–12, 1968, exposing his work to a broader audience.

He traveled with Quicksilver&#x27;s Gary Duncan to New York in January 1969 to form a new band (to be called The Outlaws) shortly before Quicksilver&#x27;s noted album &quot;Happy Trails&quot; appeared in March. While Valenti/Powers and Duncan were in New York, British keyboardist Nicky Hopkins joined Quicksilver for their third album, &quot;Shady Grove&quot; (December 1969).

As 1969 progressed, The Outlaws came to naught, eventually leading to Duncan&#x27;s reinstatement and Valenti/Powers formally joining Quicksilver at the band&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve concert. Eight of the nine songs on the group&#x27;s next album, &quot;Just for Love&quot; (August 1970), were written by Valenti/Powers, six of them under the pseudonym of &quot;Jesse Oris Farrow&quot;, including the single &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, a moderate American hit that peaked at No. 49 in November 1970. He remained the primary songwriter on their next album, &quot;What About Me?&quot; (December 1970). The Valenti/Powers-penned title track scraped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 100 in March 1971, peaking at No. 100. Despite underperforming on AM radio, both of these songs became mainstays on progressive rock and album-oriented rock radio stations, and would later be heard in the classic rock format.

Following the departure of Cipollina and Freiberg (who had been convicted of marijuana possession), the band subsequently released &quot;Quicksilver&quot; (1971) and &quot;Comin&#x27; Thru&quot; (1972) as various Valenti/Powers-fronted lineups (always including Duncan and drummer Greg Elmore) continued to tour irregularly through 1974. The 1969–1971 lineup (with Hopkins only contributing as a session musician on select tracks) briefly reunited in 1975 for &quot;Solid Silver&quot; and a promotional tour, however, the much-anticipated album only reached No. 89 in the United States. Although Freiberg (then a multi-instrumentalist in Jefferson Starship) and Cipollina soon departed, an iteration of the band including Valenti/Powers, Duncan and Elmore once again continued to tour through 1979.

Powers underwent surgery for a cerebral arteriovenous malformation (CAVM) in the late 1980s. In spite of suffering from short-term memory loss and the effects of anti-convulsive medications, he continued to write songs and play with fellow Marin County musicians.

His last major performance was a benefit at San Francisco&#x27;s Great American Music Hall. He died suddenly at his home in Santa Rosa, California, on November 16, 1994, leaving behind a younger sister, Catherine (Kay), and three sons, Paul, Joli and Sterling.

<text>Samuel Holten (June 9, 1738 – January 2, 1816) was an American Founding Father, physician, jurist, and politician from Danvers, Massachusetts. Holten represented the Massachusetts Bay Colony as a delegate to the Continental Congress, where he signed the Articles of Confederation. After numerous roles at the state and national levels in the 1780s, Holten was elected to a term in U.S. House of Representatives, serving from 1793 to 1794. He then was appointed judge in the local courts, a position he held for nearly two decades.

==Biography==
Holten was born in Salem Village (now Danvers) in the Province of Massachusetts Bay on June 9, 1738. After studying medicine under a local physician, he established a practice in nearby Gloucester. He soon returned to Danvers, where he continued practicing as a physician.
During the American Revolution, Holten actively supported the Patriot cause, serving in the militia as a major in the First Essex County Regiment. He was a member of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress from 1774 to 1775, at which point he was named to the Massachusetts Committee of Safety. Holten was appointed to the Continental Congress in 1778, when he signed the Articles of Confederation. He left the Congress in 1780 and then served in the Massachusetts Senate for two years. From 1780 to 1782, Holten was also a member of the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council, a role he repeated in eight of the next 14 years.

In 1783, Holten was appointed to the Congress of the Confederation, which under the Articles was the new nation&#x27;s only branch of government. Near the end of his two years in the Congress, Holten served briefly as its chairman:

″His Excellency the president, being, by indisposition, prevented from attending the House, Congress proceeded to the election of a Chairman, and, the ballots being taken, the (honorable) Samuel Holten was elected.″

Holten returned to the state Senate in 1784, completing additional terms in 1786, 1789, and 1790. In between, in 1787, he served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives and also returned to the Congress of the Confederation for another year. In 1788 and 1790, Holten was an unsuccessful candidate for the 2nd congressional district, and he was also an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1790; however, he was elected to represent the 1st district in 1792. After leaving the Congress, Holten was appointed judge of the Essex County Probate Court. He sat on the bench from 1796 until his resignation in 1815.

== Death ==

Holten died in Danvers on January 2, 1816. He was buried at Holten Cemetery in Danvers.

<doc id="1213278" wikidata="Q775835" url="?curid=1213278" title="Taleggio cheese">
<text>Taleggio () (&quot;Talegg&quot; in Lombard language) is a semisoft, washed-rind, smear-ripened Italian cheese that is named after Val Taleggio. The cheese has a thin crust and a strong aroma, but its flavour is comparatively mild with an unusual fruity tang. The rind is a pinkish-brown, and the interior is creamy and pale yellow. It has a protected designation of origin so that only such cheese produced in the Lombardy or Piedmont regions of Italy may be designated as Taleggio.

==History==
Taleggio and similar cheeses have been around since Roman times, with Cicero, Cato the Elder, and Pliny the Elder all mentioning it in their writings. The cheese was solely produced in the Val Taleggio until the late 1800s, when some production moved to the Lombardy plain to the south. The cheesemakers in Val Taleggio attempted to rename the cheese they produced as Taleggio del Val Taleggio (&quot;Taleggio of Val Taleggio&quot;) to distinguish it from the more widely produced versions from nearby areas, but abandoned the attempt when they received legal caution against it, as the cheese already had a protected designation of origin.

==Production==
The production takes place every autumn and winter. First, acidified milk is mixed with rennet taken from milk calves. The cheese is formed into square blocks and set on wood shelves in chambers, sometimes in caves as per tradition, and matures within six to ten weeks. It is washed once a week with a seawater sponge to prevent mould growth and to form an orange or rose crust. This smear-washing makes the cheese susceptible to contamination. Listeria developing on Taleggio is typically considered to be a post-manufacturing contamination, as the surface microflora are inhibitory to its development. The ripening cheese has been traditionally stored in caves near Valsassina, in which gentle breezes within spread the moulds growing in its rind.

Each square block is imprinted with a four-leaf brand representing the Consorzio Tutela Taleggio.

<doc id="1213281" wikidata="Q4838092" url="?curid=1213281" title="Babulnath Temple">
<text>Babulnath Temple is an ancient Hindu temple, dedicated to lord Shiva, in Mumbai, India. Situated on a small hillock near Girgaum Chowpatty, it is one of oldest mandirs in the city, Shiva in the form of the Lord of the Babul tree is the main deity in this temple. The faithful climb up to the mandir and obtain Darshan of the shivling and obtain blessings of the Lord. It is also possible to take an elevator up to the temple. The temples is visited by lakhs of devotees on annual Mahashivratri festival.

==Since Raja Bhimdev&#x27;s Time==

Babulnath Temple Shiva Linga and Idols were originally consecrated in the 12th century by the then Hindu king Bhimdev of the region. Over a period of time the temple was buried and lost over a period of time. The idols were re-discovered (unearthed) during the period of 1700 to 1780. The first temple was built in the 1780 year. 

When rediscovered, 5 original idols were dug out. That of the main Shiva Linga, Ganesh, Hanuman, Parvati and one more. Out of this the first four are in the temple. The fifth one was immersed in the sea because it was broken when it was dug out in the 18th century. Very famous temple in the 21st century, known for the active blessings.

==History==
When the first temple was built, the land belonged to the Parsi community. There were 5 Dakhma&#x27;s (Parsi final resting place) existing in the vicinity. There was a lot of resistance from the Parsi community at that time for the building of the temple. This resistance continued till late 1800 when the issue was settled by the courts in favour of the temple.

==Old Temple==
The Babulnath Mandir was patronised when built for the first time by Hindu merchant of that time. A bigger temple was built in 1890 by contributions from the Maharaja Sayajirao Gaikwad of Baroda state. The current temple structure can be dated back to 1890. The temple height was considerable when built in 1890 but a lightning strike in the 1960s and damage to the spire lowered the height of the present temple considerably. Till the 1980s Babulnath Temple was one of the Tallest structure &amp; location in the city of Mumbai.

There is limited reference to Babulnath Temple in the historical texts, because in the initial days the temple was frequented by yogis who used to stay there for &quot;Dhyan&quot; (Quiet &amp; Concentrated Meditation) and remain quietly in the vicinity/radius of the Shivling&#x27;s vibrations. However the temple famed in the 20th century. Currently the temple is thronged by people on Mondays and during Mahashivratri &amp; Shravan months.

==Legend==
About Babulnath Temple, Mumbai
Legend has it that about two centuries ago, the southeast portion of the hilly terrain known as the Malabar Hill, where Lord Babulnath&#x27;s ancient temple is situated, belonged to one Pandurang, a rich goldsmith. His cattle were grazing around.

Being grazing land, there was nothing to be taken care of by Babul, the caretaker of Pandurang&#x27;s cattle stock.

Once it was noticed that a cow Kapila stopped giving milk. On enquiry, Babul reported that the very cow, before coming home reaches a point and suo-moto puts out all her milk. Babul could not explain the logic behind this, but had made Pandurang inquisitive.

The very next day, Panduranga saw the scene again and he was overwhelmed when the said cow, Kapila was repeating her usual act. On reaching there a huge Shivaling was found. It is the very place where the temple has been built.

<doc id="1213282" wikidata="Q720788" url="?curid=1213282" title="Pierre Moulu">
<text>Pierre Moulu (1484?c. 1550) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the Renaissance who was active in France, probably in Paris.

==Life==
Little is known of his life, but internal evidence in his compositions indicates he was probably at the French royal chapel during the first two decades of the 16th century, at least, and was also associated with the cathedral in Meaux, on the Marne east of Paris. He composed music for ceremonial occasions, for example a sombre lament for the death of Queen Anne of Brittany (1514), and he also composed a motet which lists all the composers which he considered to be the most celebrated in France, arranged chronologically, and ending with Josquin. Documents from the Vatican (1505–1513) help establish his identity, as they indicate that a &quot;Petrus Moulu&quot; held various clerical positions at Meaux Cathedral. He may have written his mass &quot;Stephane gloriose&quot;, for the cathedral of St Etienne (Saint Stephen) in this town.

==Music==
Moulu&#x27;s music was clearly influenced by Josquin, but no documentary evidence survives to substantiate Pierre de Ronsard&#x27;s claim that he studied with Josquin. The motet &quot;Anxiatus est in me spiritus meus&quot; which laments Queen Anne&#x27;s death is modeled on a similar, and much more famous composition by Josquin for the death of Ockeghem, &quot;La Déploration sur la mort Ockeghem.&quot; Moulu&#x27;s music shows the style of pervasive imitation and smooth polyphony with exactly equal voices which was prevalent in the generation after Josquin (well exemplified by, and perhaps most famous in, the music of Nicolas Gombert).

Of Moulu&#x27;s music, five masses survive, the most famous being his mass on the Marian antiphon &quot;Alma Redemptoris Mater&quot;, which can be sung in two different manners: with or without rests longer than a quarter. The latest discovery is the mass &quot;Paranymphus&quot;, based on a motet by Loyset Compère. In addition to the masses, Moulu wrote motets and chansons, some of which are of doubtful authorship (Mouton and Josquin are also suggested as the composer for several of these pieces).

# Vulnerasti cor meum, 5vv.

# Au bois, au bois, madame, 4vv;
# En despit des faux mesdisans, 6vv;
# Et dout venès vous, 3vv;
# Hellas, hellas madame, 4vv;

# La rousée de moys de may, 6vv; (by Mouton)
# N&#x27;aymés jamais ces gens, 3vv;
# Voicy le may, 4vv.

In addition some works of Moulu have survived without text. For example, as late as 1592, an untexted 3-voice canon appears in Lodovico Zacconi&#x27;s &quot;Prattica de musica&quot; under the name &#x27;Pietro Molu&#x27;. This canon already appeared in 1503, printed by Petrucci, so Moulu&#x27;s attribution is very unlikely.

<text>Fa Zheng (176–220), courtesy name Xiaozhi, was a key adviser to the warlord Liu Bei in the late Eastern Han dynasty. Born in a family of high social status and of noble descent, Fa Zheng travelled to Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) in the late 190s and became a subordinate of Liu Zhang, the provincial governor. However, his feelings of alienation and perception of Liu Zhang as an incompetent governor eventually led him to betray Liu Zhang and defect to Liu Bei in 211. Between 211 and 214, Fa Zheng assisted Liu Bei in overcoming Liu Zhang and seizing control of Yi Province, and became one of Liu Bei&#x27;s most trusted advisers. In 217, he urged Liu Bei to launch the Hanzhong Campaign to capture the strategic Hanzhong Commandery from a rival warlord, Cao Cao, but died a year after Liu emerged victorious in the campaign.

Fa Zheng&#x27;s keen foresight and brilliance in formulating strategies earned him praise from his contemporaries such as Zhuge Liang and Chen Shou. In less than a decade serving under Liu, Fa showed a near unmatched sense of timing where military geniuses like Cao Cao and his best advisers fell victim to his schemes. However, he was also notorious for his vindictive personality. When he held office, he abused his power by taking revenge against those who had offended him before, and by killing them without reason. Nevertheless, he was still highly regarded and trusted by Liu Bei – to the point where Zhuge Liang once said that Fa Zheng might have been the only person capable of preventing Liu Bei&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Xiaoting in 221 if he were still alive.

==Family background==
Fa Zheng&#x27;s ancestral home was in Mei County (), Youfufeng Commandery (), which is in present-day Mei County, Shaanxi. His ancestor was Tian Fazhang, who is historically known as King Xiang of the Qi state in the Warring States period. Tian Fazhang&#x27;s descendants changed their family name from &quot;Tian&quot; to &quot;Fa&quot; after the fall of Qi in 221 BCE.

Fa Zheng&#x27;s great-grandfather, Fa Xiong, served as the Administrator () of Nan Commandery (南郡; around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei) during the reign of Emperor An in the Eastern Han dynasty. Fa Zheng&#x27;s grandfather, Fa Zhen, was a reclusive scholar known for his lofty character; despite being a learned scholar, he led a humble life and repeatedly rejected offers to serve in the government. Fa Zheng&#x27;s father, Fa Yan (), whose courtesy name was Jimou (), also served as a government official and held the positions of an assistant to the Excellency over the Masses () and the Minister of Justice ().

==Service under Liu Zhang==
In the early Jian&#x27;an era (196–220) of the reign of Emperor Xian, when famines broke out, Fa Zheng and his friend Meng Da travelled to Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) to join the provincial governor, Liu Zhang. Although Fa Zheng served as the Prefect () of Xindu County () and later as a Colonel Who Advises the Army () under Liu Zhang. Since he didn&#x27;t have any connection to local clans and was defamed by other refugees from Youfufeng, who had also moved to Yi Province. He couldn&#x27;t realize his ambitions. He maintained a close friendship with his colleague Zhang Song, who shared the same views as him about Liu Zhang being an incompetent and incapable governor.

In 208, Zhang Song travelled to Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) to meet the warlord Cao Cao, who controlled the Han central government and the figurehead Emperor Xian. After returning to Yi Province, Zhang Song advised Liu Zhang to break ties with Cao Cao and build friendly relations with another warlord, Liu Bei. When Zhang Song recommended Fa Zheng to be Liu Zhang&#x27;s representative to meet Liu Bei, Fa initially refused to accept the task but eventually relented. When Fa Zheng returned from his mission, he told Zhang Song that Liu Bei had grand ambitions and persuaded Zhang to follow him to serve Liu Bei. They wanted to help him secure Yi province but did not have the occasion to do so.

Their opportunity came in 211, when Liu Zhang became fearful upon receiving news that Cao Cao was planning to attack the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery. As Hanzhong Commandery was located strategically at the northern route leading into Yi Province, Liu Zhang would be in great peril if Hanzhong fell into Cao Cao&#x27;s hands. Zhang Song proposed to Liu Zhang to invite Liu Bei to Yi Province to assist them in countering the threat posed by Cao Cao. Liu Zhang agreed and sent Fa Zheng as his envoy to contact Liu Bei. When Fa Zheng met Liu Bei, he secretly told him, &quot;General, with your brilliance, you can overcome our incompetent and weak Governor Liu. Zhang Song, as a trusted adviser (of Liu Zhang), will serve as your spy. Upon acquiring Yi Province&#x27;s wealth and resources, and having its natural barriers as protection, you can easily realise your grand ambitions.&quot; Fa Zheng also saw Liu Bei&#x27;s marital problems and advised him to have Lady Sun sent back to Wu. Liu Bei accepted Fa Zheng&#x27;s former advice and led his forces into Yi Province, where he met Liu Zhang at Fu County (涪縣; present-day Fucheng District, Mianyang, Sichuan). Liu Bei then led his troops north to Jiameng (葭萌; located about 20 km northeast of present-day Jiange County, Sichuan) before turning south to attack Liu Zhang later.

==Helping Liu Bei seize Yi Province from Liu Zhang==
Upon receiving news of Liu Bei&#x27;s attack, Zheng Du (), an assistant officer from Guanghan Commandery (廣漢郡; around present-day Guanghan, Sichuan) serving under Liu Zhang, pointed out to his lord that Liu Bei&#x27;s army lacked supplies and was composed of newly recruited soldiers who might not be loyal to him. He suggested that Liu Zhang adopt a scorched earth policy against Liu Bei by forcing the residents of Baxi () and Zitong () commanderies to relocate elsewhere and destroy all the granaries and supply depots in the commanderies, and then fortify their defences while avoiding direct conflict with Liu Bei. He claimed that if this strategy was implemented, Liu Bei would run out of supplies within 100 days and retreat, and then Liu Zhang could attack him while he was retreating. Liu Bei felt frustrated when he heard about Zheng Du&#x27;s plan and consulted Fa Zheng about it. Fa Zheng predicted that Liu Zhang would not heed Zheng Du&#x27;s suggestion and was proven right: In response to Zheng Du&#x27;s plan, Liu Zhang not only rejected it on the grounds that it would cause disturbance to the people, but also dismissed Zheng from office.

In 214, when Liu Bei&#x27;s army surrounded Luocheng (), one of Liu Zhang&#x27;s strongholds, Fa Zheng wrote a long letter to his former lord, pointing out that Liu Zhang was already in a highly disadvantageous position and urging him to give up resistance and surrender to Liu Bei.

Fa Zheng&#x27;s letter was written as such: 

Later that year, when Liu Bei&#x27;s forces was besieging Yi Province&#x27;s capital Chengdu, Xu Jing, a commandery Administrator serving under Liu Zhang, planned to surrender and defect to Liu Bei, but his plan was leaked out and hence aborted. Liu Zhang felt that he was already at the brink of destruction so he did not punish Xu Jing. He eventually surrendered and relinquished his control of Yi Province to Liu Bei. After taking over Yi Province, Liu Bei treated Xu Jing coldly because he felt that Xu was a disloyal person. Fa Zheng advised him, &quot;Xu Jing is someone with an exaggerated reputation. However, my lord, you&#x27;ve recently built your foundation and you can&#x27;t possibly explain the facts to everyone. Xu Jing&#x27;s name is already well known throughout the Empire. If you don&#x27;t treat him respectfully, others might think that you&#x27;re belittling talented and virtuous people. You should honour and respect him, and make this known to everyone, just like how the King of Yan treated Guo Wei (郭隗).&quot; Liu Bei followed Fa Zheng&#x27;s advice and treated Xu Jing generously.

Sun Sheng criticizes Fa Zheng for his advice and the comparison between Guo Wei and Xu Jing : 

Pei Songzhi completely disagrees with Sun Sheng&#x27;s opinion: 

==Service under Liu Bei==
===Becoming Liu Bei&#x27;s Chief Adviser===
Liu Bei appointed Fa Zheng as the Administrator () of Shu Commandery () and General Who Spreads Martial Might (). Fa Zheng oversaw administrative affairs in the vicinity of Yi Province&#x27;s capital Chengdu. While Zhuge Liang was promoted to administer internal affairs, Fa Zheng served as Liu Bei&#x27;s chief adviser.

Following Liu Bei&#x27;s victory over Liu Zhang, his subordinates urged him to take for wife Liu Mao&#x27;s widow. However Liu Bei refused on the basics that he and Liu Mao were of the same family. Fa Zheng then to convince him said: &quot;In the ancient times, lady Huai Ying first married the Duke Huai of Jin and later married his own brother, the Duke Wen of Jin. If the marriage of a widow between brothers happened by the past then why not for you and Liu Mao who are not close kinsman?&quot; Liu Bei agreed with him and married Lady Wu.

During this period of time, Fa Zheng repaid all of his previous debts, good or bad. He would not forget those who showed him even a little kindness but also abused his power by taking revenge against those who offended him before. And by killing those who harmed him without the legal authority. Someone approached Zhuge Liang, another of Liu Bei&#x27;s key advisers, and urged him to restrict Fa Zheng&#x27;s influence by advising their lord to take action against him. However, Zhuge Liang replied, &quot;When our lord was in Gong&#x27;an, he was wary of Cao Cao&#x27;s influence in the north and fearful of Sun Quan&#x27;s presence in the east. Even in home territory he was afraid that Lady Sun might stir up trouble. He was in such a difficult situation at the time that he could neither advance nor retreat. Fa Xiaozhi supported and helped him so much that he became his own wings (翼), such that he is now able to fly high and no longer remain under others&#x27; influence. How can we stop Fa Zheng from behaving as he wishes?&quot; Zhuge Liang was aware that Liu Bei greatly favoured and trusted Fa Zheng, which was why he refused to intervene in this matter.

The historian Sun Sheng criticised Zhuge Liang&#x27;s attitude towards Fa Zheng&#x27;s abuse of power and called it a &quot;lapse in justice&quot;. He felt that no subject should be above the law, regardless of how great his past contributions were. While Tang Geng (), a scholar from the Song dynasty, in his work called the &quot;Three Kingdoms Miscellaneous Cases&quot; (三國雜事; &quot;Sanguo Zashi&quot;) compared Fa Zheng to Fan Ju (), Li Guang and Guo Jin (). The three of them were allowed to settle their personal grudges and rendered great achievements for their States. Tang Geng commented that this is how rulers of the past made use of their outstanding and heroic individuals. That they had their own conceptions of righteousness. Tang Geng called Sun Sheng shortsighted for not seeing this.

===Role in the Hanzhong Campaign===
In 217, Fa Zheng urged Liu Bei to attack Hanzhong Commandery, which was originally under Zhang Lu&#x27;s control but was conquered by Cao Cao in 215. He pointed out Hanzhong&#x27;s strategic importance and said that it was an opportune moment for Liu Bei to seize Hanzhong from Cao Cao&#x27;s generals Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He. He told Liu Bei: &quot;Cao Cao with a single strike was able to submit Zhang Lu into surrender and acquire Hanzhong however he did not press his advantage to conquer Ba and Shu. Instead he returned North and left Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He. This cannot be a error of his part or because of a lack of strength but rather because he met some internal problems and must solve them. Now Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He can&#x27;t compare against our army. If we advance, we will surely capture them. Then we can collect grains, fill our storehouse readying ourselves for any opportunities. If we are successful we can vanquish the ennemy and restore the ruling House otherwise we can expand our borders into the Liang province and in any case we would have gain a most important position to defend and prepare ourselves. Heaven is on our side, you must not lose this chance.&quot; Liu Bei accepted his plan and started the Hanzhong Campaign with Fa Zheng following him.

In 219, during the Battle of Mount Dingjun, when Xiahou Yuan led troops to attack Liu Bei&#x27;s camps at Dingjun and Xingshi mountains, Fa Zheng suggested Liu Bei to strike the enemy. Liu Bei ordered his general Huang Zhong to lead his men on a charge down the mountain towards Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s forces, with war drums beating in the background. Huang Zhong defeated and killed Xiahou Yuan in the midst of battle.

Later, when Cao Cao was leading his forces from Chang&#x27;an to reinforce Hanzhong, he received news about the strategy proposed by Fa Zheng to Liu Bei to attack Hanzhong. He remarked, &quot;I know Xuande (Liu Bei) is not capable of doing this. He must be following somebody&#x27;s advice.&quot; According to the &quot;Chronicles of Huayang&quot;, Cao Cao also said: &quot;How could it be that among my army of bold heroes, none could find a strategy that would overcome this Fa Zheng?&quot; The historian Pei Songzhi commented that Cao Cao made that former remark – which suggests that Liu Bei was not wise enough to notice Hanzhong&#x27;s strategic importance – because of his personal disdain for Liu, and that it should not be taken seriously. He felt that a lord acting on his adviser&#x27;s suggestion should not be interpreted as a sign that the lord was not wise enough to make his own judgment. He pointed out that Cao Cao himself also followed the advice of his adviser Guo Jia.

==Death and postmortem events==
In 219, after Liu Bei emerged victorious in the Hanzhong Campaign, he declared himself &quot;King of Hanzhong&quot; () and appointed Fa Zheng as the Prefect of the Masters of Writing () and General Who Protects the Army (). Fa Zheng died in the following year at the age of 45 (by East Asian age reckoning). Liu Bei cried for days when Fa Zheng died and awarded Fa the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Yi&quot; (), which literally means &quot;marquis of the flank&quot;. Alone, the Yi (翼) word/title is more commonly translated as &quot;wing&quot;. Therefore, Fa&#x27;s posthumous title can also be translated as &quot;marquis of the wing&quot;.

During Liu Bei&#x27;s short reign, many of his long term companions and famous generals had died. Among them were Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Ma Chao, Pang Tong and Huang Zhong; yet Fa Zheng was the only one to receive a posthumous title, such was the extent to which Liu Bei valued Fa Zheng. Fa Zheng&#x27;s son, Fa Miao (), received the title of a Secondary Marquis () and served as a Commandant of Equipage () and the Administrator of Hanyang Commandery () in the state of Shu Han, which Liu Bei established in 221.

Fa Zheng and Zhuge Liang did not share the same moral beliefs but they had a good working relationship because of their common goal, which was to serve Liu Bei well. Zhuge Liang was very impressed with Fa Zheng&#x27;s brilliance. In 221, before the Battle of Xiaoting, many of Liu Bei&#x27;s subjects advised their lord against going to war with his former ally, Sun Quan, who seized Jing Province from Liu in 219 and executed Liu&#x27;s general Guan Yu. Liu Bei ignored them and proceeded with his campaign against Sun Quan. In the following year, he lost to Sun Quan&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Xiaoting and had to retreat to Baidicheng, where he died in 223. Zhuge Liang sighed, &quot;If Fa Xiaozhi was still alive, he could have prevented our lord from going on this eastern campaign; even if our lord did go on this campaign, he wouldn&#x27;t have ended up in this disastrous situation (if Fa Xiaozhi was with him).&quot;

Zhuge Liang might be right about Fa Zheng, as inferred from an incident during the Hanzhong Campaign. During one battle, when the odds turned against Liu Bei, Liu&#x27;s subjects urged their lord to retreat but he stubbornly refused. They did not dare to advise him again for fear of incurring his wrath. Fa Zheng rushed forth and stood in front of Liu Bei when Cao Cao&#x27;s forces rained arrows on their camp. Liu Bei told Fa Zheng to stay under cover to avoid the arrows, but Fa insisted on braving the arrows with his lord. Liu Bei then decided to retreat together with Fa Zheng.

==Appraisal==
Chen Shou, who wrote Fa Zheng&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, appraised Fa as follows: &quot;Fa Zheng clearly foresaw success and failure. Therefore, he had talent for all sort of unusual tactics and strategies. However, he was not known to be of good moral character. In comparison with officials from (Cao) Wei, Pang Tong would be similar to Xun Yu like a brother while Fa Zheng would be of the same nefarious kind as Cheng and Guo.&quot;

Yang Xi, who wrote the &quot;Ji Han Fuchen Zan&quot; (季漢輔臣贊; pub. 241), a collection of praises of notable persons who served in the Shu Han state, appraised him as follows: &quot;Marquis Yi (翼侯; Fa Zheng) was talented for stratagem, could anticipate both rise and decline of the world. Entrusted with the foundation by his Lord, he answered with correct instruction and counsel. With a swift thought he managed his calculation, would observe the situation and perceive the opportunity.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Fa Zheng became a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends&quot;.

<text>Loews Corporation is an American conglomerate headquartered in New York City. The company&#x27;s majority-stake holdings include CNA Financial Corporation, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, Loews Hotels and Altium Packaging.

The corporation positions itself as a value investor with a long-term focus. In recent years, Loews has also allocated significant capital for share buybacks. In the three years preceding December 31, 2012, Loews spent $1.3 billion repurchasing shares. Between 1971 and 2020, the corporation reduced its shares outstanding from 1.3 billion shares to 291 million shares.

==History==

Loews Corporation traces its roots to 1946 when Laurence Tisch persuaded his parents to invest $125,000 to buy a resort hotel in Lakewood, New Jersey. Laurence&#x27;s brother Robert joined the business shortly thereafter. The Tisch brothers began to invest their profits in expanding the hotel business. By 1956, the brothers were in a position to build their first hotel, the Americana in Bal Harbour, Florida, for $17 million in cash.

In the wake of the landmark 1948 Supreme Court antitrust ruling in &quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.&quot;, all the major movie studios, including Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), were ordered to sell off the movie theater chains they owned and operated.

In 1959, the Tisch brothers purchased a controlling interest in Loew&#x27;s Theatres, a nationwide chain of 102 movie theaters, from MGM. This acquisition formed the foundation of the modern-day Loews Corporation, and the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange that same year.

By the summer of 1960, the brothers had gained control of the company; the brothers became co-chairmen. The theaters were aging and not suited to then-current movie-going trends, which anticipated the multiplex; however, the theaters were located on highly valuable city property. Almost immediately, the Tisch brothers began closing and demolishing many of these theaters, selling the vacant lots to developers. This hastened the end of the classic movie &quot;palaces&quot; from the Golden Age of Hollywood.

The brothers soon diversified the Loews business, successfully venturing into a variety of areas as the 1960s and 1970s progressed. Loews acquired Lorillard Tobacco Company in 1968, CNA Financial in 1974, and the Bulova Watch Company in 1979. Through acquisitions, Loews&#x27;s revenues grew from $100 million in 1970 to more than $3 billion by a decade later.

Loews sold the theater business in 1985 (it continued operating under the &quot;Loew&#x27;s&quot; brand name, while the investment operates as &quot;Loews&quot;). Laurence Tisch briefly owned, through Loews, a significant portion of US television and radio broadcaster CBS in the 1980s. As chairman of CBS, he also approved the deal that brought late-night host David Letterman to the network from NBC. Loews involvement in CBS ended in 1995, with the sale of CBS to Westinghouse Electric Corporation for $5.4 billion.

In the past two decades, Loews further diversified into the energy business. In 1989, the company acquired Diamond M Drilling. The subsidiary acquired ODECO in 1992, adding 39 oil rigs. A year later, the combined businesses were renamed Diamond Offshore. The operating subsidiary, which went public in 1995, provides contract drilling services to the energy industry globally.

In 2003, Loews purchased Texas Gas Transmission, then bought Gulf South Pipeline Company a year later. These two companies were consolidated into a new entity, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, which went public in 2005. Structured as a midstream master limited partnership (MLP), Boardwalk Pipeline provides transportation, storage, gathering, and processing of natural gas and liquids for its customers.

On May 10, 2006, Loews Corporation announced that it would offer 15 million shares of Carolina Group via a public offering, with the proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. The sale&#x27;s value was $740 million.

Loews Corporation was the parent company of Bulova until 2007, when it sold the company to Citizen Watch.

On June 4, 2007, Loews Corporation announced it would acquire a portion of the operations of Dominion Resources for $4.03 billion dollars. Loews rebranded the assets HighMount Exploration &amp; Production. This wholly owned subsidiary is engaged in the exploration and production of natural gas and natural gas liquids. On May 23, 2014, Loews announced that HighMount is pursuing strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of business. HighMont was sold later that year to the private equity firm EnerVest.

On December 17, 2007, Loews Corporation announced a plan to spin off its entire ownership interest in Lorillard to holders of Carolina Group stock and Loews common stock.

==Management==
Founders Laurence and Robert Tisch served as co-CEOs until 1998 when they retired as part of a generational shift in corporate leadership. That year, James Tisch was named president and CEO, and the Office of the president was created with three members: James Tisch, Andrew Tisch, and Jonathan Tisch. In 2006, Jonathan Tisch and Andrew Tisch were elected co-chairmen of the board. The company has issued only a single class of common stock and all shareholders have equal voting rights.

== Governance ==
The current members of the board of directors of Loews Corporation are Ann E. Berman, Joseph L. Bower, Charles D. Davidson, Charles M. Diker, Paul J. Fribourg, Walter L. Harris, Philip A. Laskawy, Susan P. Peters, Anthony Welters, Andrew H. Tisch, James S. Tisch and Jonathan M. Tisch.

== Restatement ==
On February 13, 2003, the company restated its financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2001 to 2000 as well as its interim financial statements for the first three quarters of 2002 to reflect an adjustment to the company&#x27;s historical accounting for CNA&#x27;s investment in life settlement contracts and the related revenue recognition. On March 19, 2003, the company announced a revision to its previously reported fourth-quarter and year-end 2002 results to reflect an additional $28.9 million of impairment losses on equity securities at the company&#x27;s CNA Financial Corporation subsidiary. On February 16, 2006, the company restated results from 2001 through September 2005 to correct accounting for discontinued operations acquired in CNA&#x27;s merger with the Continental Corp. in 1995. On March 8, 2006, the company said that financial statements for periods from 2001 to 2004 and the first three quarters of 2005 shouldn&#x27;t be relied on because of accounting classification errors at its majority-owned subsidiary CNA Financial Corp, and it would restate financial statements for 2003 and 2004 and for the first three quarters of 2005 to correct the classification errors.

<doc id="1213286" wikidata="Q5092514" url="?curid=1213286" title="Cherry angioma">
<text>Cherry angioma, also called cherry hemangioma or Campbell de Morgan Spot, is a small bright red dome-shaped bump on the skin. It ranges between 0.5 – 6 mm in diameter and usually several are present, typically on the chest and arms, and increasing in number with age. If scratched, they may bleed.

They are a harmless benign tumour, containing an abnormal proliferation of blood vessels, and have no relationship to cancer. They are the most common kind of angioma, and increase with age, occurring in nearly all adults over 30 years. They were first described by the nineteenth-century British surgeon, Campbell de Morgan.

==Signs and symptoms==

Cherry angiomas are made up of clusters of capillaries at the surface of the skin, forming a small round dome (&quot;papule&quot;), which may be flat topped. They range in colour from bright red to purple. When they first develop, they may be only a tenth of a millimeter in diameter and almost flat, appearing as small red dots. However, they then usually grow to about one or two millimeters across, and sometimes to a centimeter or more in diameter. As they grow larger, they tend to expand in thickness, and may take on the raised and rounded shape of a dome. Multiple adjoining angiomas form a &quot;polypoid angioma&quot;. Because the blood vessels comprising an angioma are so close to the skin&#x27;s surface, cherry angiomas may bleed profusely if they are injured.

One study found that the majority of capillaries in cherry hemangiomas are fenestrated and stain for carbonic anhydrase activity.

==Cause==
Cherry angiomas appear spontaneously in many people in middle age but can also, less commonly, occur in young people. They can also occur in an aggressive eruptive manner in any age. The underlying cause for the development of cherry angiomas is not understood.

Cherry angioma may occur through two different mechanisms: angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels), and vasculogenesis (the formation of totally new vessels, which usually occurs during embryonic and fetal development).

One study published in 2010 found that a regulatory nucleic acid suppresses protein growth factors that cause vascular growth. This regulatory nucleic acid was lower in tissue samples of hemangiomas, and the growth factors were elevated, which suggests that the elevated growth factors may cause hemangiomas. The study found that the level of microRNA 424 is significantly reduced in senile hemangiomas compared to normal skin resulting in increased protein expression of MEK1 and cyclin E1. By inhibiting mir-424 in normal endothelial cells they could observe the same increased protein expression of MEK1 and cyclin E1 which, important for the development of senile hemangioma, induced cell proliferation of the endothelial cells. They also found that targeting MEK1 and cyclin E1 with small interfering RNA decreased the number of endothelial cells.

A study published in 2019 identified that somatic mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 genes are present in many cherry angiomas. These specific missense mutations found in hemangiomas are also associated with port-wine stains and uveal melanoma. As--the mostly juvenile--Waterhouse Friedrichsen Syndrome is caused by adrenal bleeding from bacterial infections, the &#x27;senile&#x27; cherry angiomas may have to be researched for a viral and fungal pathology of the adrenals themselves or of the meninges affecting the adrenals with less dramatic bleeding compared to Waterhouse Friedrichsen&#x27;s.

Chemicals and compounds that have been seen to cause cherry angiomas are mustard gas, 2-butoxyethanol, bromides, and cyclosporine.

A significant increase in the density of mast cells has been seen in cherry hemangiomas compared with normal skin.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is based on the clinical appearance of the lesions. Examination with a dermatoscope shows characteristic red, purple, or blue-black lagoons.

The differential diagnosis includes nodular basal cell carcinoma, amelanotic melanoma, and angiokeratoma.

==Treatment==
These lesions generally do not require treatment. If they are cosmetically unappealing or are subject to bleeding angiomas may be removed by electrocautery, a process of destroying the tissue by use of a small probe with an electric current running through it. Removal may cause scarring. More recently pulsed dye laser or intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment has also been used.

Future treatment based on a locally acting inhibitor of MEK1 and Cyclin E1 could possibly be an option. A natural MEK1 inhibitor is myricetin.

==Prognosis==
In most patients, the number and size of cherry angiomas increases with advancing age. They are harmless, having no relation to cancer at all.
Eruptive cherry hemangiomatosis has been rarely reported as a heralding sign of multicentric Castleman disease (MCD), multiple myeloma, and other lymphoproliferative diseases.

==Epidemiology==
Cherry angiomas occur in all races, ethnic backgrounds, and sexes.

<doc id="1213294" wikidata="Q5566711" url="?curid=1213294" title="Glaser Safety Slug">
<text>Glaser Safety Slug is a frangible bullet made by Cor-Bon/Glaser, a subsidiary of Dakota Ammo, an American ammunition company formerly based in Sturgis, South Dakota. The Glaser Safety Slug was developed by Jack Canon in 1975, the same year the company was founded by Armin Glaser.

==History==
The original round was a hand-made hollow-point bullet filled with No. 12 birdshot () with a flat polymer cap. To improve ballistic performance, a polymer-tipped round ball was introduced in 1987, and the current compressed core form was first sold in 1988. The formulation of the polymer was also changed in 1994 to improve fragmentation reliability.

==Performance==
The company produces bullets in calibers from .25 to .45 for pistols and from .223 to .30-06 for rifles. Each caliber comes in two forms, &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;silver&quot;, the latter having greater penetrating power due to the use of no. 6 birdshot rather than no. 12.

The projectile in the cartridge is of a lighter weight than more conventional types of cartridges and so the projectiles exit the bore at significantly higher muzzle velocities. The current bullet has a stable core of compressed lead shot. On impact, the bullet fractures along manufactured stress lines in the jacket—imparting all the bullet&#x27;s energy very quickly rather than over-penetrating a target or ricocheting on a miss. The light weight and fragility of the projectile make it unsuitable for open field long-range firing or against heavily guarded targets.

The bullet design can produce deep wounds while failing to pass through structural barriers thicker than drywall or sheet metal. These qualities make it less likely to strike unintended targets (IE: bystanders in another room etc) during indoor combat. Also, when it strikes a hard surface from which a solid bullet would glance off, it fragments into tiny light pieces, creating less ricochet danger.

<doc id="1213299" wikidata="Q3035284" url="?curid=1213299" title="Geoffrey Keyes (VC)">
<text>Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Charles Tasker Keyes, (18 May 1917 – 18 November 1941) was a British Army officer of the Second World War and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award that can be made to British and Commonwealth forces for gallantry in the face of the enemy. At the time he was the youngest acting lieutenant colonel in the British Army.

==Background==
Keyes was the oldest son of Admiral of the Fleet Roger Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes, a British naval hero of the First World War and the first Director of Combined Operations during the Second World War. He attended King&#x27;s Mead School in Seaford, Sussex, then Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

Keyes was a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club.

==Second World War==
===Early actions===
Geoffrey Keyes was commissioned into the Royal Scots Greys. He saw action at Narvik and was later attached to No. 11 (Scottish) Commando, which was sent to the Middle East as part of Layforce.

Following the Allied invasion of Syria on 8 June 1941, No. 11 Commando was sent to lead the crossing of the Litani River in Lebanon, fighting successfully against troops of the French Vichy régime, during which Keyes played a leading part. In this operation, Keyes earned the Military Cross. Following the action, 11 Commando returned to Cyprus, then to Egypt in August 1941, where the unit was left in limbo. Keyes, who had assumed command of the unit after his commanding officer, Colonel Richard Pedder, was killed during the Litani River offensive, was authorised to retain 110 volunteers as a troop in the Middle East Commando.

===Operation Flipper===

In October–November 1941, a plan was formulated at Eighth Army headquarters to attack Axis headquarters, base installations and communications. One objective was the assassination by a Commando team of Erwin Rommel, the commander of the Axis forces in North Africa. The raid was intended to disrupt enemy organisation before the start of Operation Crusader. Operation Flipper was led by Acting Lieutenant-Colonel Keyes with his superior, Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Laycock, joining as an observer. Keyes, who had been present throughout the planning stage, selected the most hazardous task for himself: the assault on the supposed headquarters of the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; in a house near Beda Littoria. Following a botched landing by submarine, where over half the raiding party and their equipment failed to get ashore, the men endured an exhausting approach in torrential rain.

Keyes tried to enter the house but was confronted by a sentry. Keyes struggled in the doorway with the sentry until the guard was shot by his second-in-command. Surprise lost, Keyes, his second-in-command and a sergeant entered the building. Keyes felt faint and collapsed. Shortly after a confused period inside the house Keyes&#x27;s body was carried outside by his men and left. The official version is that Keyes opened the door to a nearby room, found Germans inside, closed it again abruptly, reopened it to hurl in a grenade and was shot by one of the Germans. Only one round was fired by the Germans during the raid on the HQ. Another possible explanation for this was that his fellow Commando Captain Robin Campbell fired several rounds at the sentry, one of which probably hit Keyes and led to his death a few minutes later.
The men retreated to a position from which they were later taken prisoner. The second-in-command also had to be left since he was shot in the leg by one of his own men. On Rommel&#x27;s orders, Keyes was buried with full military honours in a local Catholic cemetery. It was later ascertained that the house was not Rommel&#x27;s HQ but a supply centre that he seldom if ever visited; he had been in Italy at the time of the attack. Despite the debacle, Keyes was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the citation read:

Author Michael Asher has pointed out that Keyes&#x27;s VC citation was written by an officer who was not an eye-witness (Robert Laycock), and is at odds with the accounts of the survivors of the raid, and with German accounts; according to Asher, there is scarcely any statement in the citation that is verifiably true. Indeed, as author James Owen points out, the post-mortem conducted by the Germans showed that he had in fact been killed accidentally by one of his own men. Asher&#x27;s view is that the operation grew out of Keyes&#x27;s desire to achieve the heroic status of his father, the World War I naval hero, Admiral Roger Keyes. &quot;The Rommel Raid was born out of one man&#x27;s ambition to achieve glory&quot;, he has written, &quot;and as so many times in British history, it was rescued from ignominy by the valour and determination of ordinary enlisted men, none of whom played a part in its planning, nor were even told the nature of their mission before they embarked.&quot;

==Memorials==

His body was later moved to Benghazi War Cemetery in Libya. He is remembered on the King&#x27;s Mead School War memorial in Seaford, Sussex and also in the parish church in the village of Tingewick in Buckinghamshire, home of the Keyes family. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>Wilson Dwight Peter Parasiuk (; born May 6, 1943) is a Canadian businessman and former politician. As founder and CEO of the Paralink Group of Companies, based in the Vancouver area, Parasiuk organizes private sector/public sector partnerships in the export of Canada&#x27;s health care, education and governmental expertise. Paralink also provides advice on energy development matters within Canada and internationally. In his early career as a politician, he was an elected member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba, Canada, from 1977 to 1988 and a cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party government of Howard Pawley from 1981 to 1988.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Stenen, Saskatchewan, Canada into a farming family, the son of William Peter Parasiuk and Lillian Gogal, he moved with his family to Transcona, a Winnipeg suburb (now part of the city), when he was five. Parasiuk went on to obtain a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) and Master of Arts, Political Science and International Relations at the University of Manitoba and subsequently became a Rhodes Scholar (Manitoba 1966), studying at Oxford University (also playing for the University&#x27;s ice hockey team in 1967 and 1968) and obtaining a Master of Arts at St.John&#x27;s College. In 1967, Parasiuk married Wilma Dorothy Hewitson.

== Early public career (1968-1988) ==
Parasiuk returned to Canada in 1968 and worked for the Canadian federal government&#x27;s Department of Regional Economic Expansion as an Economic Development Planner in Ottawa, Ontario.

In 1970, Parasiuk returned to Winnipeg, Manitoba, and began work with the Provincial Government of Manitoba. Appointed Assistant Deputy Minister for the Cabinet Planning Secretariat by then Premier Edward Schreyer, Parasiuk held several positions over the following years, including Cabinet Sub-Committee on Economic and Resource Development, Chairman of the Lake Winnipeg Management Board, Chairman of Northern Manpower Corporation, Deputy Minister to the Premier and Deputy Minister to the Cabinet Planning Secretariat.
From 1971 to 1977, Parasiuk was Chairman of the Leaf Rapids Development Corporation, Chairman of the Communities Economic Development Fund and &quot;Ex Officio&quot; Member of the Boards of Crown Corporations of the Government of Manitoba. Parasiuk led the development of the community of Leaf Rapids, Manitoba.

Parasiuk first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1973, losing to Progressive Conservative candidate Donald Craik by about 2,000 votes in the suburban Winnipeg riding of Riel. In the 1977 election, he was elected in his home riding, the traditional New Democratic Party stronghold of Transcona in east Winnipeg, even as the NDP government of Edward Schreyer was defeated by the Progressive Conservatives under Sterling Lyon.

In 1979 Parasiuk went to China on a fact-finding tour led by prominent New Democrat, Tommy Douglas. This led to a lifelong interest and activities in an emerging China and the impact of this emergence on the rest of the world. Parasiuk remained neutral in the Manitoba NDP leadership race which ultimately elected Howard Pawley as party leader. Parasiuk was easily re-elected in the 1981 election, as Pawley&#x27;s NDP won a majority government. Parasiuk had acted as the Co-Chairman of the election campaign with Eugene Kostyra.

On November 30, 1981, Parasiuk was named Minister of Energy and Mines with responsibility for Manitoba Hydro, the Development Corporation Act, Manitoba Data Services and Manfor Resources Ltd. On January 20, 1982, he was also named Minister for Crown Investments. He was relieved of the DCA and MDS responsibilities on May 19, 1982, and the Crown Investments portfolio and the Manfor responsibility on November 4, 1983.

As Minister Responsible for Manitoba Hydro, Parasiuk was instrumental in organizing an electricity export sales agreement with Northern States Power in Minnesota which led to the development of the Limestone hydro-electric dam and generating station in northern Manitoba. The dam development and its economic spin-offs had influence in the re-election of the Pawley government March 18, 1986.

Parasiuk was easily re-elected in the 1986 provincial election. He resigned his portfolios on May 20, 1986, amid a conflict-of-interest allegation, but was reinstated on August 29, 1986 after his name was cleared by the Honourable Samuel Freedman, the retired Chief Justice of the Manitoba Court of Appeal. On September 21, 1987, he was appointed Minister of Health, with responsibility for Sport, the Boxing and Wrestling Commission Act and the Fitness and Amateur Sports Act.

Parasiuk had not intended to run again in the next election, expected sometime in 1990. However, the 1988 election, brought on by the unexpected defeat of the government in the legislature, left Parasiuk no option but to run in his Transcona riding. During this election, Pawley resigned as leader and Parasiuk supported Gary Doer as Pawley&#x27;s replacement. The NDP lost power in 1988 and Parasiuk himself was upset by Richard Kozak in the 1988 election, and has not sought a return to political life since then.

== Private and public sector career and activities (1989-present) ==
Parasiuk moved from Winnipeg, Manitoba, to the Lower Mainland of British Columbia in 1989, accepting the position of founding President of Vancity Enterprises, a real estate investment and development subsidiary of Vancouver City Savings Credit Union. Under his leadership, Vancity Enterprises went through a start-up with developments such as private residences providing assisted care at Queens Park Hospital, subsidized housing located over a Vancity Community branch and the Vancouver City Savings Credit Union Headquarters, constructed on previously unusable land due to the Skytrain rapid transit unit, which now passes through the building.

In 1992, Parasiuk was hired by the government of then British Columbia Premier Michael Harcourt to work as Chair and Chief Executive Officer of the British Columbia Trade Development Corporation until he left in 1995. Parasiuk was an advocate of developing Vancouver as the gateway to Asia and focused on expanding trade and investment to and from Asia, especially China and India. He also pursued the expansion of the film industry in B.C.

Parasiuk was the Director of Quorum Growth Inc., then a publicly traded venture capital company, from 1993 to 1997, Director of Quorum Growth International Ltd. from 1994 to 2000 and was named President of Quorum Funding International in 1995. From 1995 to 1997, Parasiuk was Chairman of the British Columbia International Power Group Inc.

During his entire career, Parasiuk has been a board member for several private, non-profit and public organizations outside of his primary work activities. From 1989 to 1991, Parasiuk was a Director of the Canada West Foundation and in 1992 acted as Moderator for the B.C. Premier&#x27;s Summit on Trade and Economic Opportunity. He was a member of the World Economic Forum from 1992 to 1995, as well as a member, from 1992 to 1998, of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Government Restructuring (now the Advisory Committee on the Public Service) and Director of the Public Policy Forum during that time.

Parasiuk has remained active in health-care policy research in Canada, having been a Director of Interhealth Canada Ltd. from 1994 to 2002 and Chairman of Interhealth Canada (China) Inc. from 1995 to 2003 and Chairman of the Beijing Toronto International Hospital Co-operative Joint Venture from 1996 to 2001, the first-ever private healthcare facility in Beijing, China. This project has not been completed due in large part to funding problems brought on by the East Asian financial crisis of the mid to late 1990s.

In 1999, Parasiuk became the Managing Director of Interhealth Canada Limited Abu Dhabi, overseeing the start-up of the then Sheikh Khalifa Medical Center, a 335-bed, 1500 staff, accredited Western standard international hospital, now known as the Sheikh Khalifa Medical Pavilion, a central piece in the Sheikh Khalifa Medical City. When Parasiuk left Interhealth Canada Limited in 2002, he held the positions of Vice-Chairman of the Board, President and CEO.

Since 1995, Parasiuk and his company, Paralink Management Ltd., have been involved in organizing private/public sector partnerships in the export of Canada&#x27;s expertise with emphasis on Canada&#x27;s healthcare, education and civics expertise. Paralink also provides advice on energy development matters. The Paralink group of companies are also involved in the recruitment and placement of foreign workers in Canada.

Parasiuk has not remained active in partisan politics, although in 2003 he publicly supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to lead the federal New Democratic Party.

Married since 1967 to Wilma Dorothy Parasiuk (née Hewitson), also of Winnipeg, Manitoba, he has two children and resides in the Vancouver area.

<text>Fisibach is a village and municipality in the district of Zurzach in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland.

==History==
While some scattered items from the Bronze Age were discovered in Fisibach, the first evidence of a settlement is a Roman era watchtower along the Rhine River. The modern village of Fisibach is first mentioned in 1050 as &quot;Fusibach&quot;. The owners of Waldhausen Castle in the hamlet of Waldhausen, granted St. Blaise&#x27;s Abbey extensive landholdings around their castle in 1113. However, by the 15th century, the castle was abandoned. On a rock in the Rhine was the Schwarzwasserstelz Castle. This castle, after 1363, was in the possession of the Bishop of Constance, and from 1589 to 1831 in the hands of the Tschudi family of Glarus. In 1875 it was demolished during the construction of the Rhine Valley Railway. The railroad did not have a station in Fisibach. The owner of Schwarzwasserstelz held the low court rights over Fisibach, while the &quot;Vogt&quot; of Baden held those rights in Waldhausen and Hägelen.

The residents of Fisibach were part of the Hohentengen parish until 1842, when they became part of the Kaiserstuhl parish. A village chapel was built in the 17th century.

<doc id="1213318" wikidata="Q2842940" url="?curid=1213318" title="American Fool">
<text>American Fool is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter John Mellencamp (credited as John Cougar), released on April 12, 1982. The album was his commercial breakthrough, holding the No. 1 position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart for nine consecutive weeks. A remastered version of &quot;American Fool&quot; was released on Mercury/Island/UMe on March 29, 2005; it includes one bonus track, the previously unreleased title track.

==Production==
Producer Don Gehman stated in a 2011 interview that &quot;American Fool&quot; was fraught with layers of problems. &quot;We had 20 or so songs, we had a record company that was hoping we were making a Neil Diamond‑type album, and after we spent two or three months in the studio recording these songs and mixing them to the best of our ability, I can remember an A&amp;R guy in a pink shirt coming in to listen to them and basically thinking we had nothing. At that point, they put a stop to the project. We had ‘Jack &amp; Diane,’ we had ‘Hand to Hold On To,’ we had ‘Weakest Moments’ — we had some good songs — and while I don’t know the precise nature of the discussions that took place, Riva went from wanting to get a new producer to not even wanting John on the label anymore. Finally, they came around to letting us finish it but wanting to hear the new songs we were going to cut.&quot;

According to a 1983 article in the &quot;Toledo Blade&quot;, the song &quot;Danger List&quot; originated when John Mellencamp heard his guitarist Larry Crane playing some chords in a basement rehearsal room. &quot;I turned on the tape recorder and sang 30 verses,” Mellencamp explained. &quot;I just made them up. Then I went and weeded out the ones I didn&#x27;t like.&quot;

<doc id="1213319" wikidata="Q1548969" url="?curid=1213319" title="Weekend at Bernie's II">
<text>Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s II is a 1993 American black comedy film written and directed by Robert Klane. It is the sequel to Klane&#x27;s 1989 comedy &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s&quot; and starring Andrew McCarthy, Jonathan Silverman, Terry Kiser, and Barry Bostwick. It tells the story of Larry and Richard once again ending up with their late boss&#x27; corpse which is targeted by a voodoo queen hired by mobsters who want to find the $2,000,000.00 that Bernie embezzled.

The film was panned by critics and grossed $12.7 million at the box office.

==Plot==
Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are at a Manhattan morgue where they see the corpse of their CEO Bernie Lomax. Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle so he can get some of Bernie&#x27;s possessions including Bernie&#x27;s credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company&#x27;s internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the $2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes that they are lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt.

Over dinner paid for with Bernie&#x27;s credit card, Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the $2 million is in Bernie&#x27;s account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in.

Meanwhile in the U.S. Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the $2 million Bernie stole. She sends two servants Henry and Charles to go to New York, get Bernie&#x27;s body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a shady adult movie theatre for the voodoo ceremony. Having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead. As a result, Bernie is reanimated but only moves when he hears music. At the 42nd Street–Grand Central subway station, Henry and Charles soon abandon him to chase a man who stole their boombox.

Later that night, Larry and Richard sneak into their office building to check Bernie&#x27;s account only to find that Bernie is the only one that can open it. They are soon arrested by police officers for breaking and entering. After their release, they find Bernie, whom they believe is still completely dead, stuff him into a suitcase, bring him with them to the Virgin Islands, and put him into a small refrigerator in their hotel room.

Unbeknownst to the two, Hummel is following them to recover the embezzled cash. The men use Bernie to open his safety deposit box but only find a map. Meanwhile, Larry befriends a lovely native girl named Claudia and gives her the map. Henry and Charles capture the two and take them to Mobu. With one of the mobsters holding a gun to his head, she forces Richard to drink a poisonous potion and tells them they must find the map by sundown to get the antidote.

When Larry, Richard, and Claudia are reunited, they are shocked to discover that the undead Bernie is moving and realize he is leading them towards the $2 million. To keep him moving, they put a Walkman with headphones on his head. As Bernie finds a large chest underwater, their resulting excitement causes Larry to accidentally shoot Bernie in the head with a speargun, destroying the headphones.

They attempt to bring Bernie back to the surface but he will not let go of the chest, which is too heavy to hoist out of the water. They end up attaching Bernie to a horse carriage with music playing. It seems to work at first, but when they go downhill, the carriage goes out of control. Eventually, the carriage ends up at Mobu&#x27;s place. Bernie hits a large tree branch and spins into a somersault before knocking out Mobu. The crash also causes Bernie to drop the chest on the ground and it breaks open. Larry tries to scoop up the money, but is caught by Hummel (now slightly unhinged upon seeing the undead Bernie walk) and he gives the $2 million to him. With Mobu out of commission, Claudia&#x27;s father, a medical doctor, says that he can cure Richard if he can get the blood of a virgin (which Larry confesses he can provide). The mobsters and Mobu are arrested.

Larry confesses to Richard that he returned the $2 million to the insurance company, but only after learning Bernie actually stole $3 million. Larry and Richard use some of the remaining million to purchase a yacht crewed by attractive women. Bernie leads Henry and Charles, who have been transformed into goats by voodoo, through a Carnival parade.

==Production==
&quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s II&quot; was filmed in 1992 in the Territory of the Virgin Islands of the United States and in New York City. The cast and crew, who were mainly from the Los Angeles area, were on location when the Los Angeles riots of April 1992 broke out and they stated in a St. Thomas interview that they were worried for their loved ones. The Bernie dummy used in the film had been on display for the film&#x27;s debut shortly before the riot&#x27;s outbreak, and was robbed of its painter&#x27;s hat and $400 sunglasses.

==Reception==
&quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s II&quot; earned mostly negative reviews from critics, earning a 13% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 31 reviews. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;It would appear to be all but impossible to make a worthwhile sequel to a comedy about a corpse&#x27;s exploits—odds &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s II&quot; never comes close to beating.&quot; Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;C+&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;If the premise of the first film was mindless and repetitive, it&#x27;s doubly so this second time around.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a grade of &quot;F&quot;.

David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a mildly diverting farcical caper.&quot; Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film 3 out of 5 and praised Terry Kiser for his performance: &quot;Through it all, Mr. Kiser, who says not a word, exudes the foolish amiability of a partygoer who is beyond plotzed and is living in a private world of his own.&quot;
===Box office===
The movie grossed $12,741,891 in the US and Canada.

==In popular culture==

&quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s II&quot; is mentioned in the eighth season episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;The Comeback&quot;. The movie is featured in the staff picks shelf at a video rental store under &quot;Gene&#x27;s Picks&quot;. Kramer recommends it to Elaine (as &quot;a hilarious premise&quot;) instead of a staff pick by &quot;arthouse goon&quot; Vincent. Elaine rents it only to be disappointed and eventually yell &quot;Bernie&#x27;s dead, you morons!&quot; at the television while watching it.

Similarly in the &quot;NCIS&quot; episode &quot;Deception&quot;, a character who needs to establish an alibi is too embarrassed to say which film he had been watching. The team assume he was watching a porn film, but he eventually admits it was &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s II&quot; to which film geek Agent DiNozzo says &quot;Even worse.&quot;

The movie is referenced in the &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; episode &quot;How Lily Stole Christmas&quot; when Ted attempts to insult Lily for having a poor sense of humor. &quot;Remember that time we heard her laughing, and we thought she was watching &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s&quot; but it turned out she was watching &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s II&quot;!&quot; This movie is also referenced in the &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; episode &quot;Weekend at Barney&#x27;s&quot;.

&quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; references this movie in the episode &quot;Most Wanted&quot; where the main characters watch a commercial for the movie &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s Part 7&quot; which features the tagline &quot;Bernie&#x27;s still dead and he&#x27;s stiffer than ever!&quot; Bernie is shown being visibly decaying at this point.

Similar to &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; would also parody the premise of the &quot;Bernie&#x27;s&quot; series in their episode &quot;Rixty Minutes&quot; wherein in an alternate universe, Jerry Smith is revealed to have written and directed a film entitled &quot;Last Will and Testimeow: Weekend at Dead Cat Lady&#x27;s House II&quot; about a group of cats attempting to act as their elderly owner after she dies in her sleep. This includes dating, making out with, and ultimately engaging in sexual intercourse with their owner&#x27;s estate holder despite the body visibly fighting to keep from decomposition, to the point one cat has to open the mouth, which is not only rotting, but is seen to have maggots inside.

On &quot;The Eric Andre Show&quot;, specifically the Season 5 episode &quot;The ASAP Ferg Show&quot;, the titular host, Andre, &quot;reenacted&quot; the &quot;Bernie&#x27;s&quot; series by walking around with someone dressed as, and acting dead like, Bernie, going up to random people and letting them know (despite a majority of people not having any interest), even specifically mentioning the sequel by name.
===Movin&#x27; Like Bernie===
Inspired by the movement of the film&#x27;s namesake, a style of dance was created in the early 2010s called &quot;Movin&#x27; Like Bernie&quot;. Homemade films went viral on the Internet, from children to soldiers serving overseas. Even professional athletes began performing the dance, including Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice after scoring a touchdown during a nationally-televised January 2011 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The 2012 Oakland Athletics adapted &quot;Movin&#x27; Like Bernie&quot; into their celebration routines after Coco Crisp played the song for third baseman Brandon Inge in the team&#x27;s clubhouse before a game. Players such as Josh Reddick would perform the dance after a home run, big hit, or walk-off victory.

<text>František Chvalkovský (30 July 1885, Jílové u Prahy – 25 February 1945) was a Czech diplomat and the fourth foreign minister of Czechoslovakia.

==Activities during the First Republic==
In the newly-independent Czechoslovakia, Chvalkovský first became a secretary of Interior Minister Antonín Švehla. In 1920, he joined the diplomatic service and participated in the negotiations of the Treaty of Trianon. He later served as ambassador to Japan, the United States, Germany and Italy.

==After Munich Agreement==

The Munich Agreement ended the First Republic of Czechoslovakia. Its previous pro-democratic and anti-totalitarian policies gave way to calls for authoritarian government and closer cooperation with Nazi Germany (more information:). The political elite, connected with former Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš, had to leave office and Chvalkovský became foreign minister. He tried to maintain the independence of the rump state by making concessions to neighbours in the hope of gaining time for a more favorable outcome in the future. He grossly underestimated Hitler&#x27;s desire to occupy Central Europe and the hunger for revenge from Poland and Hungary, who had been forced to make painful territorial concessions to Czechoslovakia after World War I. He represented Czechoslovakia during the Vienna Arbitration. Insufficient preparation forced Czechoslovakia to concede significant parts of Slovakia to Hungary. When Slovakia declared independence on 14 March 1939, Chvalkovský travelled with Czechoslovak President Emil Hácha to Berlin in the hope that further concessions would preserve the independence of Czech lands.

==Under Nazi rule==
With the establishment of the Protectorate, there was no official place for the Czech diplomatic service. In its last ruling, under German pressure, the Foreign Ministry ordered all Czechoslovak ambassadors to close their embassies and to transfer them to the Germans. Patriotic clerks hoped that the ambassadors, free from direct Nazi pressure, would disobey the order and keep the embassies for the future benefit of the government-in-exile. As a last resort, if the host government was hostile to them, they should transfer their embassy to the it, rather than Germany.

However, many ambassadors did not read between the lines and obeyed the order literally, as they were used to doing, which caused significant damage to Czechoslovak interests. Given the sequence of events shaped by Chvalkovský, many countries, such as France, a signatory of the Munich Agreement, initially considered the fall of Czechoslovakia to be a result of internal forces, rather than German aggression. Chvalkovský thus caused considerable damage to Czechoslovakia during that critical period.

After the Foreign Ministry was closed in 1939, Chvalkovský became an envoy of the Protectorate in Germany. He was killed on a highway outside Berlin during an Allied Air raid, strafed by a low-flying aircraft. The German High Command reported British strafing attacks near Berlin that day.

<text>Colonel Edward Douglas Brown-Synge-Hutchinson, (6 March 1861 – 3 March 1940) was an Anglo-Irish soldier and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
He was born as Edward Douglas Brown in Kasauli, Dagshai, India, the son of Frances Dorothy Synge-Hutchinson and David Philip Brown of the 7th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars. Thus he was the nephew of both Sir Edward Synge-Hutchinson and Lieutenant General Coote Synge-Hutchinson.

Brown was educated at Edinburgh Academy and the United Services College. He entered the Army as a Lieutenant in the 18th Hussars on 7 November 1883. On 27 March 1889, he joined the 14th King&#x27;s Hussars. From 1 January 1890 to 31 December 1894, he was Commandant of the Aldershot School of Instruction for Yeomanry.
Brown had achieved the rank of major when the 14th King&#x27;s Hussars were mobilised for active service on 9 October 1899 for service in the Second Boer War. They had been stationed at Newbridge in Ireland, and arrived in South Africa in January 1900. As a result of his courage under fire, he was awarded the Victoria Cross. He was also mentioned twice in dispatches: on 29 November 1900 by Lord Roberts, Commander-in-Chief during the early part of the war and on 8 April 1902 by Lord Kitchener C-i-C during the latter part of the war

Brown left Cape Town for the United Kingdom in early May 1902, shortly before the end of the war, part of a detachment to attend the Coronation of King Edward VII. He received a brevet promotion to lieutenant-colonel in the South African Honours list published on 26 June 1902.

In 1904 he took the name (but was not able to inherit the title) of his maternal uncle, Sir Edward Synge-Hutchinson, to become Edward Douglas Brown-Synge-Hutchinson VC. 

In November 1906 he was promoted to the brevet rank of colonel, took command of the 14th Hussars in February 1907, and so served until February 1911.

After relinquishing command of the regiment he was promoted to colonel and placed on half-pay. In November that year he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). He retired from the military in 1915.

Brown died in London at the age of 78.

==VC details==
Brown was 39 years old, and a major in the 14th Hussars, British Army during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place on 13 October 1900 at Geluk, South Africa for which he was awarded the VC:

<text>Myrna A. Phillips (born November 1942) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. She was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1988, and served as speaker of the assembly from 1986 to 1988.

Phillips was born in Roland, Manitoba. Before entering politics, she was active in feminist organizations such as the Equal Rights and Opportunities Commission, and in community programs such as Place for Kids Daycare. She was also a member of the Wolseley Residents&#x27;s Association in central Winnipeg. Phillips worked for the provincial government from 1974 to 1981, also working for Great West Life and the Manitoba Telephone System.

She was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1981 provincial election, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Len Domino by 1,468 votes in the Wolseley constituency. The NDP won a majority government in this election, and Phillips served in the assembly as a backbench supporter of Howard Pawley&#x27;s administration. She was easily re-elected in the 1986 election.

On May 8, 1986, Pawley appointed Phillips as speaker of the legislature. The previous speaker, Jim Walding, had become unpopular with his own party in 1984, when he allowed the opposition Progressive Conservatives to delay passage of a bill entrenching French language rights in Manitoba. The PCs boycotted house proceedings for several weeks, and Walding refused to call the house to order for a vote. Many questioned the validity of his actions. The Progressive Conservatives supported Walding, and refused to co-nominate Phillips as his successor.

Phillips generally avoided the controversies of her predecessor, although she was once criticized for attending an NDP caucus meeting during her tenure as speaker.

The NDP were unexpectedly defeated in the legislature in early 1988, when Jim Walding voted against his party&#x27;s budget in an evenly divided house. A new election was held, which the NDP lost. Phillips was personally defeated in Wolseley, losing to Manitoba Liberal Party candidate Harold Taylor by 506 votes.

After leaving politics, Phillips worked with the National Democratic Institute in Palestine. She also returned to work in the provincial civil service, retiring in 2001. She endorsed Kristine Barr for the Wolseley NDP nomination in the 2003 provincial election.

In August 2012, Phillips was named to the Manitoba Law Reform Commission.

<text>Spryfield is community within the urban area of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

==History==

The land now known as Spryfield was first occupied by the Miꞌkmaq people, who hunted and fished at Beaver Lake (now called Long Lake). The Miꞌkmaq would later help the first Europeans in settling upon their arrival by the mid-18th century.

The community gets its name from Captain Lieutenant-General William Spry, who purchased land in the area in 1769. Originally known as &quot;Spry&#x27;s Field&quot;, the community is centred on Spry&#x27;s former estate.

Founded around 1770, by Captain William Spry, who purchased land there and established the settlement with the aid of stationed soldiers from the nearby Halifax garrison. In 1783, he sold the property and returned to England. The name &quot;Spryfield&quot; is also sometimes used to refer to the general area of Halifax&#x27;s South Mainland, which includes a number of communities along the Herring Cove and Purcell&#x27;s Cove Roads.

The availability of land suitable for farming, and the relative close proximity to the Halifax market attracted the European settlers. These included the Brunt, Connors, Drysdale, Findlay, Henneberry, Kidston, McInnis, Moor, Norris, Oakley, Sutherland, Umlah, Warner, Yeadon, and other-families--many of whom still reside in the community today.

Spryfield&#x27;s first public school opened in 1859. Its teacher, Elizabeth Sutherland, taught the town&#x27;s early residents. In 1958, Elizabeth Sutherland Memorial School opened in her honour.

Of particular note was Henry Lieblin, a Halifax baker who held of land by the latter 18th-century. A large development, Lieblin Park, began in the early-1950s. It was named in his honour. Lieblin&#x27;s farm was about where Elmsdale Crescent is today.

As the community developed--and more people moved to the community, Spryfield mainly consisted of homes-and-roads off three main-roads (&quot;Herring Cove Road&quot;, &quot;The Northwest Arm Drive&quot;, and &quot;Old Sambro Road&quot;). However, after World War II, developers began to build subdivisions to accommodate the many new residents of the still rapidly growing greater Halifax area. Leiblin Park and Thornhill Park were among the first, being built from 1955 to 1965. Later developments include a large development in the Colpitt Lake barrens area, Cowie Hill, Elgin subdivision, Green Acres (which was left unfinished), Greystone (formerly Carson Street) subdivision, a modest cooperative development by the McIntosh Runs across from B.C. Silver Junior High School, and three subdivisions off Williams Lake Road. Initially, these were single-family dwellings, but higher densities began to be achieved by the late-1970s, when the Cowie Hill subdivision was built with mostly townhouses, and two large apartment-buildings. &quot;Greystone&quot; is mostly row houses, and there are now a number of apartment building complexes in the area. such as the one off River Road, facing J.L. Ilsley High School, and the &quot;500 block&quot; near &quot;Green Acres&quot;.

Until 1968, Spryfield was a part of Halifax County. It voted to become a part of the City of Halifax in that year, via a general referendum. In 1969, the City of Halifax annexed Spryfield, as well as Armdale, Clayton Park, Fairview, and Rockingham.

On 1 April 1996, Halifax County was dissolved and all of its places (cities, suburbs, towns, and villages) were turned into communities of a single-tier municipality named &quot;Halifax Regional Municipality&quot;. Subsequently, Spryfield was turned into a community within the new Municipality of Halifax.

Spryfield has a history of large forest fires, which in more recent decades seems to have peaked in the 1960s, when a number of large fires burned a significant proportion of the forests in the area. The largest Spryfield fire of the 21st-century began on 29 April 2009, when a forest fire erupted in the afternoon in the Green Acres area, forcing as many as 1,000 people to flee their homes. As many as 12 houses were destroyed and an area of approximately burned, between the Herring Cove and Purcell&#x27;s Cove Roads. The fire travelled quickly between these major roads on April 30 due to strong winds but did not cross either of them. The cause of the fire was determined to be an unextinguished campfire situated north of Roaches Pond on the bank of the MacIntosh Run. Firefighters from Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency and the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources fought the fire. The investigation by the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources uncovered two additional fires that occurred in an area east of J.L. Ilsley High School that are believed to have been caused by arson.

Today, Spryfield is a bustling community within the built-up area of Halifax, with many activities, amenities, and services available to its residents.

==Geography==
According to the &quot;Halifax Regional Municipality Urban Forest Master Plan&quot; of 2013, the community of Spryfield has a landmass of 1,074 hectares (10.74 km2), and is bounded to the north by Armdale, to the south by Long Pond and to the east by the Purcell&#x27;s Cove Road.

Geologically, Spryfield&#x27;s terrain is largely dominated by granite rock. Some meguma slates run along the edge of the Northwest Arm. The area&#x27;s soils generally consist of coarse, thin sands from which numerous exposed granite hilltops and ridges protrude. Several glacial erratics can be found in the area in the form of large boulders that were deposited by retreating glaciers. One notable glacial erratic in Spryfield is the Rocking Stone, after which the Rockingstone neighbourhood is named. The Rocking Stone, located in Kidston Lake Park, is of interest both due to its size and its former ability to rock back and forth when pushed on by visitors. Over the years, the stone became more difficult to rock due to debris becoming lodged beneath it, eventually becoming completely stationary. In the 1990s, a local fire department removed some of the debris and the rock was able to be moved again with the aid of a lever, but in its current state, has been immobile for several years.

The forest ecosystem in Spryfield has been shaped by recent forest fires and has allowed several fire-associated tree species to flourish such as the jack pine (&quot;Pinus banksiana&quot;), the red pine (&quot;Pinus resinosa&quot;), and the red oak. The jack pine is notable is notable as a serotinous species whose seeds only germinate after exposure to fire. Forest fires have also created several areas of barrens that are dominated by ericaceous shrubs contain tree species such as the black spruce (&quot;Picea mariana&quot;), the balsam fir (&quot;Abies balsamea&quot;), and the eastern white pine (&quot;Pinus strobus&quot;).

==Parks and recreation==
Spryfield has numerous lakes of various sizes for swimming and non-motorized boating in the summer months, which offers programs to children and youth year-round. The community is surrounded by forested areas, and in addition to the lakes there are numerous opportunities for berry-picking, exploring, and hiking.

==Demographics==
According to the article &quot;Spryfield Highlights&quot; by Dennis Pilkey (sourced from 2016 Census information), Spryfield had a population of 11,728 people, and a population density of approximately 1,091 people per km2. In 2016, the population density of Spryfield was over 14 times as dense as the municipal population density.

Although there is demographic from the 2016 Census, there is no demographic information from the most current 2021 Census.

==Economy==
From the time of colonization until the 1950s, Spryfield was predominantly rural with many farms. The earliest farms were the Kidston Farm (near Thornhill Park), and the Umlah Farm (south of Long Lake).

In the early part of the 20th century, there was a granite quarrying operation in what is now the northern portion of Long Lake Provincial Park. Much of this granite can still be seen in historic buildings and walls in Downtown Halifax. 

Until the late 1950s, aggregate pits and gravel pits, such as the operation to the south of Elizabeth Sutherland Memorial School, helped provide material for building local roads until the late 1950s. Most of Spryfield has been logged at least once, and until the mid-1960s, a sawmill operated on the east-side of Kidston Lake.

Until approximately 1960, there was relatively (compared to overall population density) more business and industrial activity in the Spryfield area than subsequently. In the 1960s and 1970s, many people began to travel to Downtown Halifax to the shopping centres and malls within the built-up area of Halifax to do their purchases. Eventually, the community took on a bedroom community aspect: many of the residents work elsewhere, with fewer thriving local businesses. The establishment of the Spryfield Mall in the mid-1970s was an attempt to reverse this trend, but it struggled to fill its floorspace. However, there is still a vigorous and growing business community in the Spryfield area, with a good amount of recent development.

<text>Harry Brown (11 May 1898 – 17 August 1917), was a Canadian First World War recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background==
Harry Brown, from Gananoque, Ontario, was born on 9 May 1898 to John and Adelaide (née Leger). After his father died, Harry lived with his mother and sisters, Irene and Loretta, in Peterborough. His mother married Patrick McAuliffe of R. R. 1, East Emily in 1911 and Harry worked on the farm . Later, he moved to London, Ontario, where his sister, Irene, lived. A story about Hill 70 in the Royal Canadian magazine &lt;pg 8/18 March 2005&gt; says he was working a munitions factory when he enlisted with the Canadian Mounted Rifles on 18 August 1916 at London, Ontario, where, according to his attestation paper, he was residing at the time. After being sent overseas, he was transferred to the 10th Battalion, CEF.

Brown was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 16 August 1917, during the Battle of Hill 70 against the Germans, when Brown and another soldier ran the gauntlet with an &quot;important message&quot;. Brown sustained mortal injury, and died the following day, 17 August. His death is commemorated on the Gananoque Cenotaph and on 16 August 2007 a black marble memorial cairn was dedicated to commemorate the action for which he received the Victoria Cross

===Citation===
Harry Brown&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, Canada. The 10th Battalion, CEF is perpetuated by the Royal Winnipeg Rifles and the Calgary Highlanders of the Canadian Army Reserve.

He is also commemorated on the Omemee, Ontario Cenotaph, as his next of kin resided in Emily Township.

<doc id="1213345" wikidata="Q2166371" url="?curid=1213345" title="Seborrheic keratosis">
<text>A seborrheic keratosis is a non-cancerous (benign) skin tumour that originates from cells, namely keratinocytes, in the outer layer of the skin called the epidermis. Like liver spots, seborrheic keratoses are seen more often as people age.

The tumours (also called lesions) appear in various colours, from light tan to black. They are round or oval, feel flat or slightly elevated, like the scab from a healing wound, and range in size from very small to more than across. They are often associated with other skin conditions, including basal cell carcinoma. Sometimes, seborrheic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma occur at the same location. At clinical examination, a differential diagnosis considers warts and melanomas. Because only the top layers of the epidermis are involved, seborrheic keratoses are often described as having a &quot;pasted on&quot; appearance. Some dermatologists refer to seborrheic keratoses as &quot;seborrheic warts&quot;, because they resemble warts, but strictly speaking, the term &quot;warts&quot; refers to lesions that are caused by the human papillomavirus.

==Cause==
The cause of seborrheic keratosis is not known. The only definitive association is that its prevalence increases with age.

==Diagnosis==
Visual diagnosis is made by the &quot;stuck on&quot; appearance, horny pearls or cysts embedded in the structure. Darkly pigmented lesions can be challenging to distinguish from nodular melanomas. Furthermore, thin seborrheic keratoses on facial skin can be very difficult to differentiate from lentigo maligna even with dermatoscopy. Clinically, epidermal nevi are similar to seborrheic keratoses in appearance. Epidermal nevi are usually present at or near birth. Condylomas and warts can clinically resemble seborrheic keratoses, and dermatoscopy can be helpful to differentiate them. On the penis and genital skin, condylomas and seborrheic keratoses can be difficult to differentiate, even on biopsy.

A study examining over 4,000 biopsied skin lesions identified clinically as seborrheic keratoses showed 3.1% were malignancies. Two-thirds of those were squamous cell carcinoma. To date, the gold standard in the diagnosis of seborrheic keratosis is represented by the histolopathologic analysis of a skin biopsy.

===Subtypes===
Seborrheic keratoses may be divided into the following types:

===Differential diagnoses===
Dermatosis papulosa nigra (DPN) is a condition of many small, benign skin lesions on the face, a condition generally presenting on darker-skinned individuals. DPN is extremely common, affecting up to 30% of black people in the United States.

==Treatment==
Medical reasons for removing seborrheic keratoses include irritation and bleeding. They may also be removed for cosmetic reasons. Generally, lesions can be treated with electrodesiccation and curettage, or cryosurgery. When correctly performed, removal of seborrheic keratoses will not cause much visible scarring.

==Epidemiology==
Seborrheic keratosis is the most common benign skin tumor. Incidence increases with age. There is less prevalence in people with darker skin. In large-cohort studies, all patients aged 50 and older had at least one seborrheic keratosis. Onset is usually in middle age, although they are common in younger patients too, as they are found in 12% of 15-year-olds to 25-year-olds, which makes the term &quot;senile keratosis&quot; a misnomer.

<doc id="1213346" wikidata="Q3382463" url="?curid=1213346" title="Greatest Hits Radio Manchester &amp; The North West">
<text>Greatest Hits Radio Manchester &amp; The North West is an Independent Local Radio station based in Manchester, England, owned and operated by Bauer as part of the Greatest Hits Radio Network. It broadcasts to Greater Manchester and North West England.

As of September 2024, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 341,000 listeners, according to RAJAR.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
The station began broadcasting at 5am on Tuesday 2 April 1974 as Piccadilly Radio on 261 m (1151 kHz then) AM/MW and on 97.0 MHz FM (from the same transmitter in Saddleworth that is now used by Hits Radio Manchester). The medium wave frequency moved to 1152 kHz on 23 November 1978 with the implementation of the Geneva 1975 plan. The station was named after Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester, and Piccadilly Plaza was home to the station&#x27;s first studios until 1996, when it relocated to the Castlefield area of Manchester.

Piccadilly&#x27;s founding managing director was Philip Birch, who previously ran the highly influential pirate station Radio London until it closed down ahead of the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act 1967 in August 1967. The first presenter on air was Roger Day – himself an ex-pirate radio presenter – and the first song played on air was &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; by The Beach Boys.

Many of Britain&#x27;s best-known broadcasters started their careers at Piccadilly, including Chris Evans, Mike Sweeney, Steve Penk, James H. Reeve, Andy Peebles, Gary Davies, Tim Grundy, Timmy Mallett, Pete Mitchell, Geoff Lloyd, Mark Radcliffe, James Stannage, Stu Allan, Nick Robinson and Karl Pilkington.

Journalist Paul Lockitt joined Piccadilly in 1979 and became the station&#x27;s longest serving on-air employee, working as a producer, presenter and newscaster until his departure in 2017.

=== FM/MW split ===

Piccadilly Radio split into two services in 1988, with Key 103 broadcast on FM with a contemporary music format, while Piccadilly continued on AM, initially under its full service format, gradually adopting a &#x27;golden oldies&#x27; music playlist as Piccadilly Gold.

In the mid-1990s, Piccadilly Gold became Piccadilly 1152 as the playlist moved away from &quot;golden oldies&quot; to a mix of classic and current easy-listening music. The late-night phone-in with James Stannage became the most popular radio talk show outside London, whilst the Dave Ward and Umberto breakfast show helped the station to become one of the biggest AM stations.

In 1994, a rival station, Fortune 1458 (later renamed 1458 Lite AM, today broadcasting as 1458 Capital Gold) commenced on BBC GMR&#x27;s former AM frequency. Despite heavy marketing, and many ex-Piccadilly presenters on the new station, Piccadilly 1152 remained Manchester&#x27;s most popular station, other than sister station Key 103, until the late 1990s when smaller, localised FM stations in Oldham, Warrington and Bury began to erode away Piccadilly&#x27;s audience base.

=== Magic 1152 ===
In 1994, Piccadilly (Key 103/Piccadilly 1152) were part of the Transworld Radio Group, which was bought by present owners Bauer Radio (then EMAP). In 1999/2000, parent company EMAP re-branded the station as Magic 1152, to fall in-line with the other nine Magic stations they owned across London and the north of England.

The idea of a corporate &quot;Magic&quot; brand of stations was seen to be beneficial when selling air time to national advertisers. This change in name also coincided with the 25th birthday of Piccadilly Radio. The station was branded as &quot;Piccadilly 1152 – the magic of Manchester&quot; during the transition. Except for a short spell in 2000 – when Key 103 was briefly renamed Piccadilly Key 103 – the Piccadilly brand was finally retired.

In December 2001, EMAP decided that it was more economical for the Magic network to share off-peak programmes. Magic 1152, in line with the other seven Magic AM stations in northern England, began networking 10am2pm, and 7pm6am by carrying programming from Magic 105.4 in London. During these hours, it was simply known as Magic, although there were local commercial breaks, and local news on the hour.

In January 2003, after a sharp decline in listening, the station ceased networking with the London station, and a regional northern network was created with the Manchester station providing networked output at weekends while sister station Magic 1152 in Newcastle provided weekday programming.

From July 2006, more networking was introduced across the Northern Magic AM network, with local output reduced to a daily four-hour breakfast show, local news and advertising. In April 2012, Magic 1152, inline with the majority of other Magic North stations, dropped local weekend breakfast shows.

Between March 2013 and December 2014, weekday breakfast was syndicated with Magic 1548 in Liverpool and Magic 999 in Preston.

=== Key 2/Key Radio ===
On 5 January 2015, Magic 1152 was rebranded as Key 2, as Magic FM in London went national on DAB. The station formed part of the Bauer City 2 network. All programming was now networked with the other Bauer AM stations in the North although local news, weather and travel continue to be broadcast as opt-outs during the day.

In June 2018, following the relaunch and rebrand of Key 103 as Hits Radio, the station was rebranded again as Key Radio, retaining the former local identity in a secondary capacity.

=== Greatest Hits Radio ===
On 7 January 2019, Key Radio rebranded as Greatest Hits Radio Manchester.

Following the sale of The Revolution in October 2020, the service is also broadcast on 96.2 FM from a transmitter in Oldham, primarily serving the Oldham, Rochdale and Tameside areas of Greater Manchester.

In February 2021, Bauer announced it would close GHR&#x27;s medium-wave service on 1152 kHz, marking the end of 47 years of broadcasting on the former AM frequency for Piccadilly Radio. The AM transmitter ceased broadcasting on 28 April 2021.

On 17 June 2021 Bauer announced the purchase of Imagine Radio from Like Media Group, with the existing Imagine service slated to be replaced by GHR services for Stockport and North Cheshire and the Peak District and Derbyshire Dales. Consequently, Greatest Hits Radio can now be heard on FM in the southern parts of Greater Manchester.

<text>Amelanchier arborea (downy serviceberry or common serviceberry), is native to eastern North America from the Gulf Coast north to Thunder Bay in Ontario and Lake St. John in Quebec, and west to Texas and Minnesota.

Other common names are &quot;shadberries&quot; (as their blossoming coincides with the shad runs in New England), &quot;Juneberries&quot; (because the berries usually set on in June), and &quot;Service&quot; or &quot;Sarvice&quot; berries because their blooms mean that the muddy back roads into the &quot;coves and hollers&quot; of Appalachia will soon be passable for circuit-riding preachers and the communities will be able to have Sunday services again. (Some say, more morbidly, that it means the ground is soft enough to dig, which means that those who died over winter can be buried and have services said over them.)

&quot;Amelanchier arborea&quot; is generally tall. Occasionally, it can grow up to tall and reach into the overstory. The trunk can be up to in diameter (rarely to ). The bark is smooth and gray.

The buds are slender with a pointed tip, and usually more than two scales visible. The leaves are ovate or elliptical, , rarely , long and wide, with pointed tips and finely serrated margins. A characteristic useful for identification is that the young leaves emerge downy on the underside. The fall color is variable, from orange-yellow to pinkish or reddish.
It has perfect flowers that are in diameter, with 5 petals, emerging during budbreak in early spring. The petals are white. Flowers are produced on pendulous racemes long with 4–10 flowers on each raceme. The flowers are pollinated by bees. The fruit is a reddish-purple pome, resembling a small apple in shape. They ripen in summer and are very popular with birds. The fruit is eaten by over 40 species of birds and various mammals, including squirrels, rabbits, chipmunks, mice, voles, foxes, black bears, deer, and elk. 

It also commonly hybridizes with other species of &quot;Amelanchier&quot;, the hybrid &quot;Amelanchier × grandiflora&quot; being one example, and identification can be very difficult as a result.

==Cultivation==
This species tolerates varying light levels, but is at its best in full sun. It requires good drainage and air circulation and should be watered during drought. It is often confused with other species in the nursery trade. Propagation is by seed, divisions and grafting.

The edible fruit is drier than some other serviceberries, and it is harvested locally for pies and jams, and has been known to be used for wine; they were also used by Native Americans to make bread.

Some report that the sweetened juice tastes like Dr. Pepper and some nurseries sell them as &quot;The Dr. Pepper Tree&quot;, but the fruit is not used in the soft drink.

<text>Leopold V, Archduke of Further Austria (9 October 1586 – 13 September 1632) was the son of Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria, and the younger brother of Emperor Ferdinand II, father of Ferdinand Charles, Archduke of Further Austria. He was Prince-Bishop of Passau and of Strasbourg, until he resigned to get married, and Archduke of Further Austria including Tyrol.

== Biography ==
Leopold was born in Graz, and was invested as bishop in 1598, as a child, even though he had not been ordained as a priest; he became Prince-Bishop of Strasbourg in 1607, a post which he held until 1626. From 1609 onwards he fought with his mercenaries in the War of the Jülich succession (Archduke Leopold in the War of the Jülich Succession), and in the Brothers&#x27; Quarrel within the Austrian Habsburg dynasty against his first cousin Maximilian III, Archduke of Further Austria in Tyrol, and from 1611 for his first cousin Rudolf II in Bohemia. In 1614, he financed the construction of the Church of the Jesuit College of Molsheim, within which his coat of arms is still prominently displayed.

In 1619, upon the death of his kinsman and former rival, he became governor of Maximilian&#x27;s inheritance: Further Austria and Tyrol, where he attained the position of ruler as Archduke of Further Austria from 1626 to his death in 1632. In 1626 he resigned his ecclesiastical positions and married Claudia de&#x27; Medici. He had the custom house and the Jesuit church built in Innsbruck. He fought for the Veltlin and defended Tyrol against the Swedes in 1632. He died in Schwaz, Tyrol.
==Issue==
With his wife Claudia de&#x27; Medici, he became the founder of a sideline of the Habsburg family, which persisted until 1665 - the most recent line of Archdukes of Further Austria.

His children were:

* Maria-Eleonora 1627–1629
* Ferdinand Charles (1628–1662); married Anna de&#x27; Medici
* Isabella-Clara (1629–1685); married Charles III, Duke of Mantua
* Sigismund Francis (1630-1665); married Hedwig of the Palatinate-Sulzbach
* Maria Leopoldine (1632–1649); married Emperor Ferdinand III

<doc id="1213355" wikidata="Q2147331" url="?curid=1213355" title="Reciprocity (social psychology)">
<text>In social psychology, reciprocity is a social norm of responding to an action executed by another person with a similar or equivalent action. This typically results in rewarding positive actions and punishing negative ones. As a social construct, reciprocity means that in response to friendly actions, people are generally nicer and more cooperative. This construct is reinforced in society by fostering an expectation of mutual exchange. While the norm is not an innate quality in human beings, it is learned and cemented through repeated social interaction. Reciprocity may appear to contradict the predicted principles of self-interest. However, its prevalence in society allows it to play a key role in the decision-making process of self-interested &quot;and&quot; other-interested (or altruistic) individuals. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as reciprocity bias, or the preference to reciprocate social actions.

Reciprocal actions differ from altruistic actions in that reciprocal actions tend to follow from others&#x27; initial actions, or occur in anticipation of a reciprocal action, while altruism, an interest in the welfare of others over that of oneself, points to the unconditional act of social gift-giving without any hope or expectation of future positive responses. Some distinguish between pure altruism (giving with no expectation of future reward) and reciprocal altruism (giving with limited expectation or the potential for expectation of future reward). For more information on this idea, see altruism or altruism (ethics).

== History ==
Reciprocity dates as far back as the time of Hammurabi (c. 1792–1750 BC). Hammurabi&#x27;s code, a collection of 282 laws and standards, lists crimes and their various punishments, as well as guidelines for citizens&#x27; conduct. The &quot;eye for an eye&quot; principles in which the laws were written mirror the idea of direct reciprocity. For example, if someone caused the death of another person, they too would be put to death.

Reciprocity was also a cornerstone of Ancient Greece. In Homeric Greece, citizens relied on reciprocity as a form of transaction as there was no formal system of government or trade. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, he illustrates several instances of reciprocal transactions in the form of gift giving. For example, in Book VI of the Iliad, Glaucus and Diomedes exchange armor when they discover that their grandfathers were friends. However, there were times when direct reciprocity was not possible, especially in times of great need when a citizen had nothing to give for repayment. Thus, delayed reciprocity was also prevalent in Greek culture at this time. Delayed reciprocity refers to doing a positive action in service of another, including a gift or favor, with the understanding that they will repay this favor at another time when the initial giver is in great need. This form of reciprocity was used extensively by travelers, particularly in the Odyssey. Odysseus often had to rely on the kindness of human strangers and other mythological creatures to secure resources along his journey.

In the classical Greek &quot;polis&quot;, large-scale projects such as construction of temples, building of warships and financing of choruses were carried out as gifts from individual donors. In Rome, wealthy elite were linked with their dependents in a cycle of reciprocal gift giving. As these examples suggest, reciprocity enjoyed a cultural prestige among ancient aristocracies for whom it was advantageous. The institutionalization of reciprocity has its origins in ancient societies, but continues today in politics and popular culture. For more, see Reciprocity (social and political philosophy).

== As an adaptive mechanism ==
Richard Leakey and Roger Lewin attribute the very nature of humans to reciprocity. They claim humans survived because our ancestors learned to share goods and services &quot;in an honored network of obligation.&quot; Thus, the idea that humans are indebted to repay gifts and favors is a unique aspect of human culture. Cultural anthropologists support this idea in what they call the &quot;web of indebtedness&quot; where reciprocity is viewed as an adaptive mechanism to enhance survival. Within this approach, reciprocity creates an interdependent environment where labor is divided so that humans may be more efficient. For example, if one member of the group cares for the children while another member hunts for food for the group, each member has provided a service and received one in return. Each member can devote more time and attention to his or her allotted task and the whole group benefits. This meant that individuals could share resources without actually giving them away. Through the rule of reciprocity, sophisticated systems of aid and trade were possible, bringing immense benefits to the societies that utilized them. Given the benefits of reciprocity at the societal level, it is not surprising that the norm has persisted and dictates our present cognition and behavior.

== The power of reciprocity ==
Reciprocity is not only a strong determining factor of human behavior; it is a powerful method for gaining one&#x27;s compliance with a request. The rule of reciprocity has the power to trigger feelings of indebtedness even when faced with an uninvited favor irrespective of liking the person who executed the favor.

=== Strength ===
In 1971, Dennis Regan tested the strength of these two aspects of reciprocity in a study entitled &quot;Effects of a Favor and Liking on Compliance.&quot; In this experiment, participants believed they were in an art appreciation experiment with a partner, &quot;Joe&quot;, who was actually a . During the experiment, Joe would offer a soft drink to his co-participant. After the experiment was over, Joe would ask the participant to buy raffle tickets from him. The more the participants liked Joe, the more likely they were to buy raffle tickets from him. However, when Joe had given them a soda, which thus indebted them to reciprocate, the participants feelings toward Joe were no longer a significant predictor of purchasing tickets. The rule of reciprocity proved to be more salient in this decision-making process than did how much they liked a person. Thus, individuals who we might not even like have the power to greatly increase our chances of doing them a favor simply by providing us with a small gift or favor prior to their request. Furthermore, we are obliged to receive these gifts and favors which reduces our ability to choose to whom we wish to be indebted.

Politics is another area where the power of reciprocity is evident. While politicians often claim autonomy from the feelings of obligation associated with gifts and favors that influence everyone else, they are also susceptible. In the 2002 election, U.S. Congress Representatives who received the most money from special interest groups were over seven times more likely to vote in favor of the group that had contributed the most money to their campaigns.

=== Automaticity ===
In 1976, Phillip Kunz demonstrated the automatic nature of reciprocity in his experiment, &quot;Season&#x27;s greetings: From my status to yours&quot; using Christmas cards. In this experiment, Kunz sent out holiday cards with pictures of his family and a brief note to a group of complete strangers. While he anticipated some responses, holiday cards came pouring back to him from people who had never met nor heard of him and who expressed no desire to get to know him any better. The majority of these individuals who responded never inquired into Kunz&#x27;s identity, they were merely responding to his initial gesture with a reciprocal action.

=== Cooperation ===
Fehr &amp; Gächter (2000) in &quot;Cooperation and Punishment in Public Goods Experiments&quot; showed that, when acting within reciprocal frameworks, individuals are more likely to deviate from purely self-interested behavior than when acting in other social contexts. Participants were allotted an endowment of 20 monetary units (i.e. dollars). They were given the choice to anonymously donate how much of their endowment to contribute to a public good. All contributions from each participant was multiplied by a factor such as by 10, and then the multiplied sum was distributed equally, regardless of what share of the total an individual contributed. This experiment illustrates the free-rider problem, where an individual in a group benefits from the contributions of others, while simultaneously not contributing any of their own resources. The optimal outcome occurs when every participant contributes the maximum amount, allowing the highest amount of funds to be shared, while involving cooperation by all. Other conditions in this experiment included punishment conditions, where participants could penalize non-contributing actors. This experiment found that without punishments, contributions declined, demonstrating when and how free-riding occurs. Across punishment conditions, contributions were high and stayed relatively stable. Participants were willing to use some of their funds to punish non-contributors, indicating how important negative reciprocity can be in action.

=== Reciprocity over self-interest ===
Magnanimity is often repaid with disproportionate amounts of kindness and cooperation, and treachery with disproportionate amounts of hostility and vengeance, significantly surpassing amounts determined or predicted by conventional economic models of rational self-interest. Moreover, reciprocal tendencies are frequently observed in situations wherein transaction costs associated with specific reciprocal actions are high and present or future material rewards are not expected. Whether self-interested or reciprocal action dominates the aggregate outcome is particularly dependent on context; in markets or market-like scenarios characterized by competitiveness and incomplete contracts, reciprocity tends to win out over self-interest.

=== The Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma ===

The Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma is a key example of reciprocity and self-interest in action. In this scenario, frequently visualized by a 2x2 grid, both A and B have committed the same crime, together. Their punishment for the crime is dependent on if they each confess or not, in relation to if the other actor confesses as well.

* [3 years, 3 years]: If both confess, they both receive a moderate sentence.
* [0 years, 5 years]: If A confesses and B stays silent, A receives no punishment, while Bob receives a severe sentence.
* [5 years, 0 years]: If A stays silent and B confesses, A receives a severe sentence, while B receives no punishment.
* [1 year, 1 year]: If both stay silent, they both receive a minor sentence.

==== The Dilemma ====
Individually, each prisoner is incentivized to confess, regardless of what the other does. This leads to a suboptimal outcome for both, where they both end up with a moderate sentence. However, if they both agree to stay silent, they both receive a minor sentence, a better outcome for both.

The Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma is a telling demonstration of reciprocity because each actor is incentivized to cooperate to ensure the best outcome for them both. The choice to testify can lead to the optimal outcome for one actor if the other actor does not testify, but since this cannot be guaranteed, it is regarded as a safer choice to choose to stay silent in the hopes that the other actor will make this choice as well. In continuous games of the Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma run by a computer, over time, the computer will defer to the strategy of cooperation, indicating how reciprocity is a choice reached after the player observes the other actor working in their favor. This is a significant illustration of the idea of &#x27;tit-for-tat&#x27;, where in payoff-based scenarios, individuals will commit to cooperative strategies if they stand to gain from them as well.

=== Positive and negative reciprocity ===
Positive reciprocity occurs when an action committed by one individual that has a positive effect on someone else is returned with an action that has an approximately equal positive effect. For example, if someone mows their neighbor&#x27;s lawn, the person who received this favor should then return this action with another favor such as a small gift. However, the reciprocated action should be approximately equal to the first action in terms of positive value, otherwise this can result in an uncomfortable social situation. If someone mows another person&#x27;s lawn and that person returns the favor by buying that individual a car, the reciprocated gift is inappropriate because it does not equal the initial gesture, whereas returning the favor with something small but kind, like baking a cake, would be considered commensurate to the situation. Individuals expect actions to be reciprocated by actions that are approximately equal in value. This value is often viewed to be context dependent; some actions&#x27; reciprocals may be based on financial value, while others may be based on time invested or effort required.

One example of positive reciprocity is that waitresses who smile broadly or give small gifts to their patrons receive more tips than waitresses who present a minimal smile. Also, free samples are not merely opportunities to taste a product but rather invitations to engage in the rule of reciprocity. Many people find it difficult to accept the free sample and walk away. Instead, they buy some of the product even when they did not find it that enjoyable.

Negative reciprocity occurs when an action that has a negative effect on someone is returned with an action that has an approximately equal negative effect. For example, if an individual commits a violent act against a person, it is expected that person would return with a similar act of violence. In more modern societies and structures of justice, this generally translates into legal action, jail time, and even the death penalty. If, however, the reaction to the initial negative action is not approximately equal in negative value, this violates the norm of reciprocity and what is prescribed as allowable. Retaliation, or revenge, actions taken against a person or group to induce harm in response to a previous grievance is an example of negative reciprocity. This definition of negative reciprocity is distinct from the way negative reciprocity is defined in other domains. In cultural anthropology, negative reciprocity refers to an attempt to get something for nothing. It is often referred to as &quot;bartering&quot; or &quot;haggling&quot; (see reciprocity (cultural anthropology) for more information).

== Reciprocal concessions ==
There are more subtle ways of initiating the reciprocity rule than merely doing something nice for someone so you may expect something in return. One instance of this more subtle form of reciprocity is the idea of reciprocal concessions. In a reciprocal concession, the requester initially makes a larger request, then a smaller request that is more feasible, making the respondent more likely to agree to a second request.

Under the rule of reciprocity, we are obligated to concede to someone who has made a concession to us. That is, if an individual starts off by requesting something large and you refuse, you feel obligated to consent to their smaller request even though you might not be interested in either of the things they are offering. Robert Cialdini illustrates an example of this phenomenon by telling a story of a boy who asks him to buy five-dollar circus tickets and, when Cialdini refuses, asks him to buy some one dollar chocolate bars. Cialdini feels obligated to return the favor and consents to buying some of the chocolate bars.

The rule of reciprocity operates in reciprocal concessions in two ways: pressure and expectation.

* First, an individual is &quot;pressured&quot; to reciprocate one concession for another by nature of the rule itself.
* Second, because the individual who initially concedes can &quot;expect&quot; to have the other person concede in return, this person is free to make the concession in the first place. If there were no social pressure to return the concession, an individual runs the risk of giving up something and getting nothing in return.

=== Effectiveness ===

# Psychological Obligation: Concessions create a perception of goodwill, which the other party feels obligated to match.
# Norm of Cooperation: People tend to align with cooperative norms when they observe the other person acting in good faith.
# Contrast Effect: The smaller request appears more reasonable when compared to the larger one.

Mutual concession is a procedure that can promote compromise in a group so that individuals can refocus their efforts toward achieving a common goal. Reciprocal concessions promote compromise in a group so that the initial and incompatible desires of individuals can be set aside for the benefit of social cooperation.

=== The door-in-the-face technique ===
The door-in-the-face technique, otherwise known as the rejection-then-retreat technique, involves making an outrageous request that someone will almost certainly turn down, and then making a smaller request that was the true item of interest all along. If executed successfully, the second request is seen as a concession so compliance with the second request is obtained. However, one must proceed with caution when using this technique. If the first request is so big that it is seen as unreasonable, the door in the face technique proves useless as the concession made after may not be perceived as genuine. The door in the face technique is not to be confused with the foot-in-the-door technique where individuals attempting to get a person to agree with a large request by first getting them to agree to a small or moderate request.

== &quot;Influence: Science and Practice&quot; ==
The book Influence: Science and Practice by Robert Cialdini is a prominent work in the field of reciprocity and social psychology. First published in 1984, the work outlines the main principles of influence, and how they can be applied in one&#x27;s life to succeed, especially in business endeavors. People use heuristics or general strategies, to make decisions more easily in a complex and stimulating world, and these strategies can be embraced to help oneself influence others.

The seven principles are:

# Reciprocation
# Commitment and consistency
# Social proof
# Liking
# Authority
# Scarcity
# Unity

== Reciprocity in the workplace ==
Social reciprocity holds significant importance in the workplace as it contributes to the foundation for effective collaboration, teamwork, and a positive work environment. The principle of reciprocity fosters a sense of trust and interdependence among employees, which enhances overall workplace dynamics. When employees reciprocate positive actions, such as providing support, sharing information, or acknowledging achievements, it contributes to a culture of mutual respect and cooperation.

Practicing social reciprocity in the workplace can strengthen interpersonal relationships, recognized as a social norm within employees of the same status. Meanwhile, failed reciprocity at work has the potential to lead to negative emotions and heightened stress. By experiencing a continued lack of reciprocity, the perceived positive work culture may erode, causing negative associations to form with the workplace and one&#x27;s coworkers. Failed reciprocity, a lack of an equivalent favor in return for a positive action, in the workplace has the potential to diminish trust, weaken social support, and can even increase the probability of suffering from stress-related diseases. In attempting to improve the quality of a work environment, it is crucial to acknowledge and encourage efforts of reciprocity within the employees.

=== Negative reciprocity in the workplace ===
Harmful behavior also tends to be reciprocated with harmful behavior. A meta-analysis by Greco et al. (2019) analyzed negative workplace behaviors ranging from bullying and harassment to counterproductive work behavior.

Study Design

They separated them into different categories according to severity (minor, moderate, severe), activity type: if the action was the result of withholding a positive behavior, refusing to act, or the execution of a negative behavior (passive, balanced, active), and target (whether the behavior was reciprocated or displaced to another person).
Results

The analysis found that negative behaviors tend to be reciprocated with the same kind of behavior and the strongest relationship was found in reciprocity using a matched level of severity and activity; however, negative workplace behaviors that escalate in severity or activity also showed a strong and positive relationship. Moreover, when the frequency of negative workplace behaviors increases this is generally reciprocated, with the other person also increasing the frequency of their negative behaviors. The weakest effect was found to be de-escalation in activity or severity, which means that most people tended to respond with the same or a greater amount of reciprocity in negative workplace behaviors, rather than responding with a more mild action.
De-escalation

In the category of severity, de-escalation only took place when Party A engaged in severe behaviors like violence or harassment, while Party B engaged in moderately severe behavior. This discrepancy may have been a result of abiding by ethical norms and avoiding legal repercussions as a consequence of their behavior. Many of the articles analyzed did not include the target of the negative behaviors, limiting the breadth of information on this category. However, they found that for two cases of de-escalation, the reciprocated negative behavior was directed at the instigator instead of being displaced. There was also one case of escalation in which the reciprocated behavior was targeting the instigator.

A news article summarizing similar research studies suggests that negative reciprocity might exist in order to restore or build a cooperative relationship. They stated that the strategy treats balance as a goal, especially because it involves a relatively proportional response to harm.

=== Reciprocity and trust ===
Trust in reciprocity takes into consideration three different factors: the individual’s risk preferences (whether or not the person has a tendency to accept risks in trust decisions), their social preferences (whether the individual shows prosocial tendencies or betrayal aversion), and lastly, their beliefs about the other’s trustworthiness (includes social priors like implicit racial attitudes and the reputation of the other individual based on previous experiences.

A coordinated meta-analysis of 30 fMRI studies concluded that trust in reciprocity might cause an adverse feeling at the beginning of a series of interactions with a stranger. This is likely due to the inherent uncertainty of a decision outcome, leading individuals to be unsure about whether the other person will reciprocate their actions. However, as interpersonal trust grows people are more confident and willing to cooperate with their partners. Interpersonal trust builds up through a learning mechanism that takes information from previous interactions in which the other individual cooperated or did not cooperate. This learning mechanism helps the individual label the other person as trustworthy or untrustworthy. This meta-analysis also found that reciprocity, trust, and feedback learning show activity in different areas of the brain, which suggests that all of them are part of different cognitive processes.

This theme of reciprocity and trust is also discussed in science magazines such as the &quot;Greater Good Magazine&quot; where the writers mention that people are more likely to be cooperative with others who act cooperatively towards them or have a reputation of being cooperative.

=== Self-serving reciprocity ===
Reciprocity has been previously documented as automatic because it requires less cognitive control than other self-serving behaviors. The researchers of a series of experiments around this topic wanted to investigate whether this automatic reciprocity was motivated by true fairness or whether it is a result of wanting to appear like a fair person. To test this they used a two-player activity called the &quot;Trust Game&quot; or the &quot;Investment Game.&quot; Participants were given a determined amount of chips/money. The sender is supposed to decide the amount of money/chips (all, some, none) they want to transfer to the trustee or whether they want to keep the money/chips for themselves. The experimenter multiplies the amount transferred from the sender and gives it to the trustee. The trustee then decides whether or not to transfer (all, some, none) back.

==== Experimental Design ====
This series of experiments contained a condition where the trustees are informed that their chips are worth twice as much as the sender’s chips, which gives them the option to appear fair (while in reality, not being fair) and another option to be genuinely fair. They also divided the groups manipulating the participant’s cognitive control.

Cognitive Control

* Cognitive control allows individuals to consider options and factors, suppress personal impulses, and make decisions aligned with norms such as fairness rather than defaulting to their own self-interest.
* Manipulations
** Ego Depletion: Participants were made to feel mentally fatigued by performing tasks that require sustained self-control, thus reducing their ability to exert cognitive control in subsequent tasks.
** Time Constraints: Participants were placed under strict time limits, which forced them to rely on quick, automatic responses rather than deliberation.

Findings

When cognitive control was diminished (due to ego depletion or time pressure), participants were more likely to default to self-serving reciprocity—behaviors that appeared fair on the surface but that in reality, were driven by self-interest. Under conditions of full cognitive control, participants were better able to align their actions with genuine fairness norms, rather than simply maintaining the appearance of fairness. Researchers found that people tend to turn to reciprocal behavior when there is a lack of cognitive control. When participants had limited cognitive control, they used the extra information to positively reciprocate to a lesser extent than people without the cognitive control manipulation. However, even with reduced cognitive control, they chose to benefit from the exchange if the outward perception of their behavior would look fair and reciprocal. This demonstrated that their main goal was to appear fair, not to behave in a fair manner. A news article summarized a research study that supports these findings in which researchers found that people tend to take more time to make a generous choice than to make a selfish one.

== Reciprocity in conversation analysis ==
Conversation analysis, a methodology used to study how shared understanding is reached in naturally occurring conversation, employs the principle of reciprocity to explain how certain phenomena occur in conversation. Reciprocity occurs in conversational activities and practices such as:

* Turn-Taking:
** Reciprocity is present in the mechanism of turn-taking, where participants coordinate the exchange of speaking turns. When one speaker asks a question, the recipient typically provides an answer, which reflects reciprocity in verbal engagement.
* Sequential Organization:
** Conversations are organized in sequences, such as adjacency pairs (e.g., question-answer, greeting-response). Reciprocity ensures that one part of the pair (e.g., a question) creates an expectation for a corresponding response (for example, an answer).
* Repair and Feedback:
** Reciprocity also involves responding to problems in communication, such as misunderstanding or ambiguity. Speakers use repairs to clarify or correct these concerns. Listeners provide feedback such as &quot;uh-huh&quot; or nodding to show engagement and understanding.
* Social Norms and Obligations:
** Reciprocity in conversation is guided by norms of politeness and cooperation (like Grice’s Maxims), ensuring that interactions are constructive and socially appropriate.

== Reciprocity in non-human primates ==
The topic of reciprocity in non-human primates has been a field with a lot of research contradictions and opposite findings; however, in a recent meta-analysis, the researchers concluded that primates have the cognitive and social prerequisites needed to use reciprocity. They evaluated previous findings and found that there are more positive than negative findings. They added that reciprocity could have been misrepresented in some research studies because it also includes acting between relatives and trading.

Researchers also identified that many of the negative findings come from articles where researchers did not measure the primate’s understanding of the task or studies where the primates did not show an understanding of the activity. Previous researchers interpreted studies that did not display reciprocity as a failure to prove its existence in primates, rather than assessing the situations where reciprocity occurred versus the situations where it did not. Different species also take different time periods to reciprocate an action which may be short or long-term. Some specific behaviors also seem less likely to be reciprocated. For example, it is less likely for a non-human primate to reciprocate food donations.

Overall, the researchers concluded that non-human primate reciprocity is more common than it has previously been regarded and that negative findings should not be thrown out but instead embraced to foster a better comprehension of their use of reciprocity. News sources also support these findings suggesting that other primates use reciprocity in food sharing and other domains; and some of them, like chimpanzees, are more likely to do so if the other chimpanzee had also helped them in the past, which also supports the connection between trust and reciprocity in non-human primates.

<doc id="1213360" wikidata="Q1091141" url="?curid=1213360" title="José Vasconcelos">
<text>José Vasconcelos Calderón (28 February 1882 – 30 June 1959), called the &quot;cultural &quot; of the Mexican Revolution, was an important Mexican writer, philosopher, and politician. He is one of the most influential and controversial personalities in the development of modern Mexico. His philosophy of the &quot;cosmic race&quot; affected all aspects of Mexican sociocultural, political, and economic policies.

==Early life==
Vasconcelos was born in Oaxaca, Oaxaca, on February 28, 1882, the son of a customs official. José&#x27;s mother, a pious Catholic, died when José was 16. The family moved to the border town of Piedras Negras, Coahuila, where he grew up attending school in Eagle Pass, Texas. He became bilingual in English and Spanish, which opened doors to the English-speaking world. The family also lived in Campeche while the northern border area was unstable. His time living on the Texas border likely contributed to fostering his idea of the Mexican &quot;cosmic race&quot; and rejection of Anglo culture.

==Private life==
At 24, he married Serafina Miranda of Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca, in 1906. Their children were José Ignacio and Carmen. He also had a long-term relationship with Elena Arizmendi Mejia and throughout his life many other shorter liaisons, including one with Berta Singerman. His troubled relationship with Antonieta Rivas Mercado led to her suicide inside Paris&#x27;s Notre Dame Cathedral in 1931. When his wife of forty years died in 1942, their daughter Carmen is reported to have said, &quot;When the coffin was lowered into the ground, Vasconcelos sobbed bitterly. At that moment he must have known and felt who he really had as a wife; perhaps they were tears of belated repentance.&quot; He remarried the pianist Esperanza Cruz and they had a child, Héctor.

==Mexican Revolution==

Although Vasconcelos was interested in studying philosophy, the Porfiriato&#x27;s universities focused on the sciences, influenced by French positivism. Vasconcelos attended the National Preparatory School, an elite high school in Mexico City, and he went on to Escuela de Jurisprudencia in Mexico City (1905). In law school, he became involved with a group of radical students organized as the Ateneo de la Juventud (Youth Atheneum). The Ateneo de Juventud was led by a Dominican citizen, Pedro Henríquez Ureña, who had read Uruguayan essayist José Enrique Rodó&#x27;s &quot;Ariel&quot;, an influential work published in 1900 that was opposed to Anglo cultural influence but also emphasized the redemptive power of education. The Ateneo de la Juventud had a diverse membership, composed of university professors, artists, other professionals, and students. Some other members included Isidro Fabela and Diego Rivera. Opposed to the Díaz regime, it formulated arguments against it and its emphasis on positivism by employing French spiritualism, which articulated &quot;a new vision of the relationship between individual and society.&quot;

After graduating from law school, he joined the law firm of Warner, John, and Galston in Washington, D.C. Vasconcelos joined the local Anti-Re-election Club in Washington, D.C. It supported the democratic movement to oust the longtime President of Mexico Porfirio Díaz in 1910 and was headed by Francisco I. Madero, the presidential candidate of the Anti-Re-election Party. Vasconcelos returned to Mexico City to participate more directly in the anti-re-election movement, became one of the party&#x27;s secretaries, and edited its newspaper, &quot;El Antireelectionista&quot;.

After Díaz was ousted by revolutionary violence that was followed by the election of Madero to the presidency, Vasconcelos led a structural change at the National Preparatory School. He changed the academic programs and broke with the past positivistic influence.

After Madero&#x27;s assassination in February 1913, Vasconcelos joined the broad movement to defeat the military regime of Victoriano Huerta. Soon, Vasconcelos was forced into exile in Paris, where he met Julio Torri, Doctor Atl, Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio, and other contemporary intellectuals and artists. After Huerta was ousted in July 1914, Vasconcelos returned to Mexico.

The Convention of Aguascalientes in 1914, the failed attempt of the anti-Huerta regime to find a political solution, split the factions. The leader of the Constitutionalists, Venustiano Carranza, and General Álvaro Obregón split with more radical revolutionaries, especially Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata. Vasconcelos chose the side of the Convention and served as Minister of Education during the brief presidential period of Eulalio Gutiérrez. Villa was defeated by the Constitutionalist Army under Obregón in the Battle of Celaya in 1915, and Vasconcelos went into exile again. Venustiano Carranza became President (1915–1920), but was ousted and killed by the Sonoran generals who had helped put him in power.

==Rector of National University==

Vasconcelos returned to Mexico during the interim presidency of Sonoran Adolfo de la Huerta and was named rector of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (1920) As rector, he had a great deal of power, but he accrued even more by ignoring the standard structures, such as the University Council, to govern the institution. Rather, he exercised personal power and began implementing his vision of the function of the university. He redesigned the logo of the university to show a map of Latin America, with the phrase &quot;Por mi raza hablará el espíritu&quot; (The spirit will speak for my race), an influence of Rodó&#x27;s &quot;arielismo&quot;. It also had an eagle and a condor and a background of the volcanic mountains in central Mexico. Vasconcelos is said to have declared, &quot;I have not come to govern the University but to ask the University to work for the people.&quot;

==Secretary of Public Education==

When Obregón became President in 1920, he created the Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) in 1921 and named Vasconcelos as its head. Under Obregón, the national budget had two key expenditures; the military was one, but the other was education. Creating the Secretariat entailed changing the Constitution of 1917, and so Obregón&#x27;s government had to muster support from lawmakers. Vasconcelos traveled throughout Mexico while he was rector of the university to seek that support. His effort succeeded, and Vasconcelos was named head of the new cabinet-level secretariat in July 1921.

His tenure at the Secretariat gave him a powerful position to implement his vision of Mexico&#x27;s history, especially the Mexican Revolution.

Vasconcelos printed huge numbers of texts for the expanded public school system, but in the 1920s, there was no agreement about how the Mexican Revolution should be portrayed and so earlier history texts by Justo Sierra, the head of the ministry of public education during the Díaz regime, continued to be used.

Although Vasconcelos was no advocate of Mexican Indigenous culture, as Secretary of Education he sent a statue of the last Aztec emperor, Cuauhtemoc, to Brazil for its centennial celebrations of independence in 1923, to the amazement of the South American recipients.

==Later life==
He resigned in 1924 because of his opposition to President Plutarco Elías Calles. He worked for the education of the masses and sought to make the nation&#x27;s education on secular, civic, and Pan-American (&quot;americanista&quot;) lines. He ran for the presidency in 1929 but lost to Pascual Ortiz Rubio in a controversial election, and again left the country.

He later directed the National Library of Mexico (1940) and presided over the Mexican Institute of Hispanic Culture (1948).

José Vasconcelos died on June 30, 1959, in the Tacubaya neighborhood of Mexico City. His body was found reclining on the desk, in which he was working on one of his last literary works: &quot;Letanías del atardecer&quot; (‘Litanies of the evening’), published posthumously unfinished. Because of his qualities as a pedagogue and his strong support for Latin American culture, he was named “Teacher of the Youth of America” a title that is often abbreviated as &quot;Teacher of America&quot;.

==Philosophical thought==
Vasconcelos&#x27; first writings on philosophy are passionate reactions against the formal, positivistic education at the National Preparatory School, formerly under the influence of Porfirian thinkers like Justo Sierra and Gabino Barreda.

A second period of productivity was fed by a first disappointment in the political field, after Madero&#x27;s murder. In 1919, he wrote a long essay on Pythagoreanism, as a dissertation on the links between harmony and rhythm and its eventual explanation into a frame of aesthetic monism. As he argued that only by the means of rhythm can humans able to know the world without any intermediation, he proposed that the minimal aspects of cognition are conditioned by a degree of sympathy with the natural &quot;vibration&quot; of things. In that manner, he thought that the auditive categories of knowledge were much higher than the visual ones.

Later, Vasconcelos developed an argument for the mixing of races, as a natural and desirable direction for humankind. That work, known as (&#x27;The Cosmic Race&#x27;), would eventually contribute to further studies on ethnic values as an ethic and for the consideration of ethnic variety as an aesthetic source. Finally, between 1931 and 1940, he tried to consolidate his proposals by publishing his main topics organized in three main works: (&#x27;Metaphysics&#x27;), (&#x27;Ethics&#x27;), and (&#x27;Aesthetics&#x27;).

In the final part of his life, he gradually fell into a deeply Catholic political conservatism. Before the Second World War, he had begun writing sympathetically about Francisco Franco, and he retracted some of his earlier liberal positions. One of his last published works, &quot;Letanías del atardecer&quot; (1957) is a pessimistic tract that hinted that the use of nuclear weapons might be necessary because of the postwar order.

==Influence==
Vasconcelos is often referred to as the father of the philosophy. In recent times it has come under criticism from Native Americans, because of its negative implications concerning indigenous peoples. To an extent his philosophy argued for a new, &quot;modern&quot; mestizo people, at the cost of cultural assimilation for all ethnic groups. His research on the nature of Mexican modern identity had a direct influence on the young writers, poets, anthropologists, and philosophers who wrote on this subject. He also influenced the point of view of Carlos Pellicer with respect to several aesthetic assumptions reflected in his books. Together, Pellicer and Vasconcelos made a trip through the Middle East (1928–1929) and were looking for the &quot;spiritual basis&quot; of Byzantine architecture.

Other works, particularly and , had a decisive influence in Octavio Paz&#x27;s (&#x27;The Labyrinth of Solitude&#x27;), with anthropological and aesthetic implications. Paz wrote that Vasconcelos was &quot;the teacher&quot; who had educated hundreds of young Latin American intellectuals during his many trips to Central and South America. Vasconcelos was a guest lecturer at Columbia University and Princeton University, but his influence on new generations in the United States gradually decreased. Nevertheless, his work has been used by Chicano and Mexican-American movements since the 1970s, which assert the (&#x27;retaking&#x27; or literally &#x27;reconquest&#x27;) of the American Southwest, based on their Mexican ancestry.

==Contributions to national culture==
Vasconcelos caused the National Symphonic Orchestra (1920) and the Symphonic Orchestra of Mexico (1928) to be officially endorsed. Under his secretaryship, artists Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro Siqueiros were permitted to paint the inner walls of the most important public buildings in Mexico (such as the National Palace in Mexico City), creating the Mexican muralist movement.

==Quotations==

&quot;[T]he leaders of Latin American independence ... strove to free the slaves, declared the equality of all men by natural law; the social and civic equality of whites, blacks and Indians. In an instant of historical crisis, they formulated the transcendental mission assigned to that region of the Globe: the mission of fusing the peoples ethnically and spiritually.&quot; (, 1948)

&quot;Each of the great nations of History has believed itself to be the final and chosen one. ... The Hebrews founded the belief in their superiority on oracles and divine promises. The English found theirs on observations relative to domestic animals. From the observation of cross-breeding and hereditary varieties in such animals, Darwinism emerged. First, as a modest zoological theory, then as social biology that confers definitive preponderance to the English above all races. Every imperialism needs a justifying philosophy&quot;. (, 1948)

&quot;Hitler, although he disposes of absolute power, finds himself a thousand leagues from Caesarism. Power does not come to Hitler from the military base, but from the book that inspires the troops from the top. Hitler&#x27;s power is not owed to the troops, nor the battalions, but to his own discussions... Hitler represents, ultimately, an idea, the German idea, so often humiliated previously by French militarism and English perfidy. Truthfully, we find civilian governed &#x27;democracies&#x27; fighting against Hitler. But they are democracies in name only&quot;. (&quot;&quot;, &quot;Timon&quot; 16; June 8, 1940)

<text>Mainland Halifax is the remaining portion of the community of Halifax, without the Halifax Peninsula.

==History==
For thousands of years and currently, Mainland Halifax has been be on the unceded ancestral lands of the Mi&#x27;kmaq.

On 21 June 1749, the Town of Halifax was founded. Europeans began to colonize the area, and sometime between 1841 and 1842, Halifax was granted city status. Between 1841 and 1842 and 1969, Halifax expanded to become the entire Halifax Peninsula.

In 1969, Halifax annexed several communities from Halifax County, and they were located in what would become the area of Mainland Halifax; Armdale, Clayton Park, Fairview, Rockingham, Purcell&#x27;s Cove and Spryfield.

On 1 April 1996, the City of Dartmouth, the City of Halifax, the County of Halifax, and the Town of Bedford amalgamated and created the &quot;Halifax Regional Municipality&quot;. Subsequently, the entirety of the former City of Halifax was re-established as the &quot;Community of Halifax&quot; and is coterminous with the former city itself. However, the new community was divided into two subsections: &quot;Mainland Halifax&quot; and &quot;Peninsular Halifax&quot;.

Currently, Mainland Halifax enjoys increased cultural, demographic, and economic growth from its great location. It hosts busy communities that make this a fantastic area within the municipality.

==Geography==
Mainland Halifax is portioned into two sections, &quot;Mainland North&quot; and &quot;Mainland South&quot;, divided by St. Margaret&#x27;s Bay Road. The area of Mainland Halifax has a landmass of 4,301.2 hectares (43.012 km2).

===Communities and neighbourhoods===

====Mainland North====

*Armdale
*Bayer&#x27;s Lake
*Bridgeview
*Clayton Park
*Clayton Park West
*Fairmount
*Rockingham
*Sherwood Heights
*Wedgewood

====Mainland South====
*Boulderwood
*Cowie Hill
*Green Acres
*Leiblin Park
*Melville Cove
*Purcell&#x27;s Cove
*Spryfield
*Williams Lake

===Topography===
The area lies west of the Bedford Basin and Northwest Arm and extends several kilometres inland.

==Demographics==
Mainland Halifax&#x27;s population as of 2021 was 83,972 people, an increase of 10,662 people (over 14.5%) from 73,310 people in 2016.

The area&#x27;s population density increased by 248 people per km2, from approximately 1,704 people per km2 in 2016 to approximately 1,952 people per km2 in 2021.

<text>Bethsaida ( ; from ; from Aramaic and , from the Hebrew root ; ), also known as Julias or Julia (), is a place mentioned in the New Testament. Julias lay in an administrative district known as Gaulonitis. Historians have suggested that the name is also referenced in rabbinic literature under the epithet ().

==History==
===New Testament===
According to , Bethsaida was the hometown of the apostles Peter, Andrew, and Philip. In the Gospel of Mark (), Jesus reportedly restored a blind man&#x27;s sight at a place just outside the ancient village of Bethsaida. In , Jesus miraculously feeds five thousand near Bethsaida.

Pliny the Elder, in his &quot;Natural History&quot;, places Bethsaida on the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee. The historian Josephus says that the town of Bethsaida (at that time called Julia), was situated 120 stadia from the lake Semechonitis, not far from the Jordan River as it passes into the middle of the Sea of Galilee. &quot;De Situ Terrae Sanctae&quot;, a 6th-century account written by Theodosius the archdeacon describes Bethsaida&#x27;s location in relation to Capernaum, saying that it was distant from Capernaum. The distance between Bethsaida and Paneas is said to have been .

Although Bethsaida is believed to be located on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee, within the Bethsaida Valley, there is disagreement among scholars as to precisely where. Since the nineteenth century, three places have been considered as the possible location of Biblical Betsaida: the Bedouin village of Messadiye; the small, deserted settlement of El-Araj (Beit HaBek, &quot;House of the Bey&quot;); and the archaeological site (tel) of Et-Tell. Over time, the latter two locations have come to appear more likely. While Messadiye and El-Araj are closer to the Sea of Galilee, Et-Tell shows significant archaeological remains including fragments of fishing equipment.

==Archaeology==
* Et-Tell, a site on the east bank of the Jordan River, is promoted by the Bethsaida Excavations Project, led by Rami Arav.
* El-Araj () is proposed by a second group, led by Mordechai Aviam, under the auspices of the Center for Holy Land Studies (CHLS).

==Et-Tell==
Archaeologists tend to agree that the capital of the kingdom of Geshur was situated at et-Tell, a place also inhabited on a lesser scale during the first centuries BCE and CE and sometimes identified with the town of Bethsaida of New Testament fame.

The first excavations of the site were conducted in 1987–1989, by the Golan Research Institute. In 2008–2010, and in 2014, archaeological excavations of the site were conducted by Rami Arav on behalf of the University of Nebraska of Omaha, Nebraska. According to Arav, the ruin of &quot;et-Tell&quot; is said to be Bethsaida, a ruined site on the east side of the Jordan on rising ground, from the sea. This distance poses a problem, however, insofar that if it were a fishing village, it is situated far from the shore of the Sea of Galilee. In an attempt to rectify the problem, the following hypotheses have been devised:

#Tectonic rifting has uplifted et-Tell (the site is located on the Great African-Syrian Rift fault).
#The water level has dropped from increased population usage, and land irrigation. In fact, the excavation of Magdala&#x27;s harbor has proven that the ancient water-level was much higher than it is today.
#The Jordan River delta has been extended by sedimentation.

=== Bronze and Iron Ages ===

Excavations indicate that the settlement was founded in the 11th century BCE, in the biblical period. Et-Tell was inhabited during both the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. The fortified town there is associated by researchers with the biblical kingdom of Geshur.

Most imposing archaeological finds, mainly from the Stratum V city gate, date to the 8th century BCE, but as of 2024, archaeologists have found the northwestern chamber wall of the Geshurite city gate of Stratum VI, dating to the 11th-10th centuries BCE. The et-Tell site would have been easily the largest and strongest city to the east of the Jordan Valley during the Iron Age II era.

The archaeologists tentatively identify the city with biblical Zer, a name used during the First Temple period.

=== Hellenistic and Roman periods ===
Et-Tell was reinhabited again in the third century BCE and continued on a lesser scale during the first century CE. Archaeological excavations at site have revealed fishing gear, including lead weights used for fishing nets, as well as sewing needles for repairing fishing nets. The findings indicate that most of the city&#x27;s economy was based on fishing on the Sea of Galilee. Two silver coins dating to 143 BCE, as well as Seleucid bronze coins, bronze coins from the time of Alexander Jannaeus, King of the Hasmonean dynasty (reigned c. 103–76 BCE), and one coin from the time of Philip the Tetrarch (a son of Herod the Great), ruler of the Bashan (reigned 4 BCE – 34 CE), were discovered at the site. Philip the Tetrarch applied the name &quot;Julias&quot; () to the site, which he named after Caesar&#x27;s daughter.

==Al-Araj==
Location: 

According to Josephus, around the year 30/31 CE (or 32/33 CE) Philip raised the village of Bethsaida in Lower Gaulanitis to the rank of a polis and renamed it &quot;Julias&quot;, in honor of Livia, also called Julia Augusta, the wife of Augustus. It lay near the place where the Jordan enters the Sea of Galilee.

Julias/Bethsaida was a city east of the Jordan River, in a &quot;desert place&quot; (that is, uncultivated ground used for grazing), if this is the location to which Jesus retired by boat with his disciples to rest a while (see and ). The multitude following on foot along the northern shore of the lake would cross the Jordan by the ford at its mouth, which is used by foot travelers to this day. The &quot;desert&quot; of the narrative is just the &quot;barrīyeh&quot; of the Arabs, where the animals are driven out for pasture. The &quot;green grass&quot; of , and the &quot;much grass&quot; of John 6:10, point to some place in the plain of &quot;el-Baṭeiḥah&quot;, on the rich soil of which the grass is green and plentiful, compared to the scanty herbage on the higher slopes.

In 2017, archaeologists announced the discovery of a Roman bathhouse at el-Araj, which is taken as proof that the site was a polis in the Roman Empire period. The bathhouse was located in a layer below the Byzantine layer, with an intervening layer of mud and clay that indicated a break in occupation between 250 and 350 CE. They also found what might be the remains of a Byzantine church building, matching the description of a traveller in 750 CE. On account of these discoveries, the archaeologists believe that el-Araj is now the most likely candidate for the location of Bethsaida.

In 2019, what some describe as the Church of Apostles was unearthed by the El-Araj excavations team during the fourth season at the site of Bethsaida-Julias / Beithabbak (El-Araj), on the north shore of Sea of Galilee near where the Jordan river enters the lake. The excavation was carried out by Prof. Mordechai Aviam of Kinneret College and Prof. R. Steven Notley of Nyack College. This Byzantine period church is believed by some to have been built over the house of the apostle brothers, Peter and Andrew. Only the southern rooms of the church were excavated. A well-protected ornamental mosaic floor, gilded glass tesserae, and a marble chancel decorated with a wreath have been found in some of the excavated rooms. According to Professor Notley:
In 2022, the archaeological team uncovered a large mosaic that is over 1500 years old containing an inscription. This invokes St. Peter as &quot;the chief and commander of the heavenly apostles&quot;. and mentions a donor named &quot;Constantine, a servant of Christ&quot;. These terminologies are consistent with Byzantine usage. Because of this, Notley said that this &quot;strengthen[s] our argument that [it] should be considered the leading candidate for first century Bethsaida.&quot;

==El-Mesydiah==
El-Mesydiah, also spelled el-Mes‛adīyeh is a third, but generally considered least likely possibility. It is located on the present shoreline, but preliminary excavations, including the use of ground penetrating radar, initially revealed only a small number of ruins dating from before the Byzantine period. Some were inclined to favor el-Mes‛adīyeh which stands on an artificial mound about from the mouth of the River Jordan. However, the name is in origin radically different from Bethsaida. The substitution of &quot;sīn&quot; for &quot;ṣād&quot; is easy, but the insertion of the guttural &quot;‛ain&quot; is impossible.

==One or two Bethsaidas?==
Many scholars maintain that all the New Testament references to Bethsaida apply to one place, namely, Bethsaida Julias. The arguments for and against this view may be summarized as follows.

Galilee ran right round the lake, including most of the level coastland on the east. Thus Gamala, on the eastern shore, was within the jurisdiction of Josephus, who commanded in Galilee. Judas of Gamala is also called Judas of Galilee. If Gamala, far up the slope towering over the eastern shore of the sea, were in Galilee, &quot;a fortiori&quot; Bethsaida, a town which lay on the very edge of the Jordan, may be described as in Galilee.

Josephus makes it plain that Gamala, while added to his jurisdiction, was not in Galilee, but in Gaulanitis. Even if Judas were born in Gamala, and so might properly be called a Gaulanite, he may, like others, have come to be known as belonging to the province in which his active life was spent. &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; for instance was born in Bethlehem in Judaea. Josephus also explicitly says that Bethsaida was in Lower Gaulanitis . Further, Luke places the country of the Gerasenes on the other side of the sea from Galilee (Luke 8:26) – &quot;antipéra tês Galilaías&quot; (&quot;over against Galilee&quot;).

*To go to the other side – &quot;eis tò péran&quot; (Mark 6:45) – does not of necessity imply passing from the west to the east coast of the lake, since Josephus uses the verb &quot;diaperaióō&quot; of a passage from Tiberias to Taricheae. But
*#this involved a passage from a point on the west to a point on the south shore, &quot;crossing over&quot; two considerable bays; whereas if the boat started from any point in el-Baṭeiḥah, to which we seem to be limited by the &quot;much grass&quot;, and by the definition of the district as belonging to Bethsaida, to sail to et-Tell or el-Araj, it was a matter of coasting not more than a couple of miles, with no bay to cross.
*#No case can be cited where the phrase &quot;eis tò péran&quot; certainly means anything else than &quot;to the other side&quot;.
*#Mark says that the boat started to go unto the other side to Bethsaida, while John, gives the direction &quot;over the sea unto Capernaum&quot; (John 6:17). The two towns were therefore practically in the same line. Now there is no question that Capernaum was on &quot;the other side&quot;, nor is there any suggestion that the boat was driven out of its course; and it is quite obvious that, sailing toward Capernaum, whether at Tell Ḥūm or at Khān Minyeh, it would never reach Bethsaida Julias
*The words of Mark (), it is suggested, have been too strictly interpreted: as the Gospel was written probably at Rome, its author being a native, not of Galilee, but of Jerusalem. Want of precision on topographical points, therefore, need not surprise us. But as we have seen above, the &quot;want of precision&quot; must also be attributed to the writer of . The agreement of these two favors the strict interpretation. Further, if the Gospel of Mark embodies the recollections of Peter, it would be difficult to find a more reliable authority for topographical details connected with the sea on which his fisher life was spent.

In support of the single-city theory it is further argued that
*#Jesus withdrew to Bethsaida as being in the jurisdiction of Philip, when he heard of the murder of John the Baptist by Herod Antipas, and would not have sought again the territories of the latter so soon after leaving them.
*#Medieval works of travel notice only one Bethsaida.
*#The east coast of the sea was definitely attached to Galilee in AD 84, and Ptolemy (c. 140) places Julias in Galilee. It is therefore significant that only the Fourth Gospel speaks of &quot;Bethsaida of Galilee&quot;.
*#There could hardly have been two Bethsaidas so close together.

But:
*#It is not said that Jesus came hither that he might leave the territory of Antipas for that of Philip; and in view of , and Luke 9:10, the inference from Matthew 14:13 that he did so, is not warranted.
*#The Bethsaida of medieval writers was evidently on the west of the Jordan River. If it lay on the east, it is inconceivable that none of them should have mentioned the river in this connection.
*#If the Gospel of John was not written until well into the 2nd century, then John the Apostle was not the same person as the author John the Evangelist. But this is a very precarious assumption. John, writing after AD 84, would hardly have used the phrase &quot;Bethsaida of Galilee&quot; of a place only recently attached to that province, writing, as he was, at a distance from the scene, and recalling the former familiar conditions.
*#In view of the frequent repetition of names in Palestine the nearness of the two Bethsaidas raises no difficulty. The abundance of fish at each place furnished a good reason for the recurrence of the name.

== 1217 battle ==
During the Fifth Crusade, the well-mounted crusader army led by King Andrew II of Hungary defeated Sultan Al-Adil I at Bethsaida on the Jordan River on 10 November 1217. Muslim forces retreated to their fortresses and towns.

<text>Mathew Blagden Hale (18 June 1811 – 3 April 1895), very frequently spelled &quot;Matthew&quot;, was the first Anglican bishop of Perth and then the Anglican bishop of Brisbane.

Hale is recognised for seeking to empower the South Australian Aboriginals through his work in the Poonindie mission, establishing the Anglican Diocese of Perth and Hale School.

==Early life==
Mathew Blagden Hale was born on 18 June 1811 at Alderley, Gloucestershire, the third son of Robert H. Blagden Hale (5 May 1780 – 20 December 1855) and Lady Theodosia Hale (née Bourke). His maternal grandfather was The Earl of Mayo, Lord Archbishop of Tuam. After completing his education at Wotton-under-Edge, he attended Trinity College, Cambridge, and obtained his B.A. in 1835 and M.A. in 1838. During his time at Cambridge he met Harold Browne and they became lifelong friends. Both came under the influence of Charles Simeon who celebrated fifty years of evangelical ministry at (Holy) Trinity Church in 1832. The antislavery movement driven by William Wilberforce also influenced Hale and he wanted to minister to the newly emancipated slaves, particularly in the West Indies, but was not encouraged to do so neither by his family nor by the missionary society working in that region.
Hale was ordained a deacon in the Church of England in 1836, and priest in 1837 by the Bishop of Bristol and Gloucester. From 1836 to 1838 he was curate of Tresham. In 1838 he acted as curate of Wootton-under-Edge, then from 1839 to 1845 Perpetual Curate of Stroud, an expanding woollen-cloth manufacturing centre in Gloucestershire. In 1840 Hale married Sophia Clode, with whom he would have three children, the eldest of whom died in infancy. Sophia died in early 1845 followed by Hale&#x27;s mother a few months later. Hale had an emotional breakdown and resigned. Subsequently, he served briefly as Rector of Alderley in 1845 and 1846, and then as Perpetual Curate of Atworth with Wraxhill in 1846 and 1847.

==South Australia==

In 1847 he met Bishop Short at a friend&#x27;s house, and was persuaded to accompany him to Adelaide. Hale, with his two surviving daughters and two servants in late December 1847 arrived in South Australia, where he was appointed first Archdeacon of Adelaide. The following year during a pastoral visit to Western Australia with Bishop Short he married Sabina, eldest daughter of John and Georgiana Molloy. Subsequently, after Hale returned to Adelaide, he was appointed the first rector of St Matthew&#x27;s church at Kensington.

In early 1850 Hale approached the Governor of South Australia proposing an institution for young Aborigines where they would live in one little community to learn practical skills in farming and domestic arts and to receive Christian teaching. Later that year he volunteered his services as mission superintendent. His offer was accepted and the Natives&#x27; Training Institution was opened at Poonindie, near Port Lincoln, in October 1850. Hale and his family moved to Poonindie soon afterwards and Mathew and Sabina&#x27;s eldest surviving son, Mathew, was born there in July next year. The Institution prospered and when Bishop Short visited in February 1853, there were 54 Aborigines resident, eleven of whom were baptised by the Bishop.

==Western Australia==

In 1856, Hale resigned to accept an invitation to serve as Bishop of Perth. In July 1856 he arrived in Western Australia on the &quot;Guyon&quot;, which had diverted to Port Lincoln to pick him up, along with his two eldest daughters and sister-in-law Georgiana Molloy, and in November the rest of his family arrived there from South Australia. In March 1857, Hale returned to England with his family, where on 25 July 1857 he was consecrated as the first Bishop of Perth at the Lambeth Palace Chapel. The sermon was preached by Hale&#x27;s longtime friend from their university days, Harold Browne. According to its usual custom Cambridge University awarded the new bishop an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree. While Hale accepted this academic honour, he was reluctant to adopt the style and title of &quot;My Lord&quot;, maintaining that as a colonial bishop he would be better without it. However, the legal authorities ruled that he must accept it and he did so.

Leaving his family in England, Hale returned to Western Australia on the convict ship &quot;Nile&quot; early in 1858, to take up office as Bishop of Perth. It had been an eventful and dangerous voyage. The problems arising from transportation were evident when Hale had made his initial tour of his diocese-to-be and he had prepared a report on The Transportation Question, advocating measures to make Western Australia a reformatory colony rather than a penal settlement. This was published while he was in England. Hale&#x27;s report demanded change in the colony&#x27;s penal system. When copies reached Perth before he returned from England, there was a storm of criticism in the local news media, claiming that Hale&#x27;s report was &quot;full of misrepresentations and errors&quot;. However, when Hale&#x27;s own account of his voyage on &quot;Nile&quot; and the behavior of the convicts on it was published, he was vindicated and newspaper editors were commending Hale, even as the Colonial Governor was disapproving because of &quot;embarrassment to Her Majesty&#x27;s Government&quot;.

In June 1858, after he returned from England, Hale opened a boys&#x27; school for both boarders and day pupils. The Bishop&#x27;s School was modelled after England&#x27;s public schools. Many of the pupils who attended it came from leading families in the colony; many of them went on to become prominent in Western Australian business and politics. Hale had continuing problems in finding suitable schoolmasters and funds to support his school. Eventually this proved too much for him and the Bishop&#x27;s School closed on 1 March 1872. However it continued on under different management and eventually became today&#x27;s Hale School. Bishop Hale is generally recognised as the pioneer of secondary education in Western Australia.

Communications with the eastern colonies and England were made by sailing ship when Hale arrived in the colony in 1856 and by steamship when he left in 1875. Albany was the first port of call on the Australian continent. Hence Hale was the first Australian bishop to receive his invitation to the first Lambeth Conference held in 1867 and was the only one to attend it.

In 1870 a crisis arose when the lady running an orphanage for indigenous children in Albany was unable to continue this work. Hale decided to resign as bishop, apply for the vacant chaplaincy at Albany, and carry on this orphanage work himself. As soon as his intention to resign became known in Perth, a large deputation from the Protestant community called on Hale and persuaded him to withdraw it. In explaining his intentions to his friends Hale reminded them that &quot;I have no hesitation in saying that a European population disregarding the welfare of the natives, whom it has displaced from their country, will not ensure God&#x27;s blessing and therefore I do hope that the public generally will support the Mission at Albany.&quot;

In July 1871 Hale met with his clergy and laity to draw up the constitution for a diocesan synod and the first synod was held in Perth in August 1872. He opened this synod with a significant sermon , &quot;Being all things to all men&quot; on the responsibilities of both individual Christians and the church in their relationships with the world.

===Leaving===

Hale was Bishop of Perth until 1875. On 5 April that year he received letters from Bishop Barker of Sydney and Bishop Short of Adelaide asking for his consent to be nominated as second Bishop of Brisbane. He was reluctant to accept this new responsibility, since he was in his mid sixties and looking forward to retirement in a few years time, and did so only on the condition that he had the unanimous support of all the Australian bishops.

There was a public farewell to Hale on 30 October 1875 at which an address from the congregation of St George&#x27;s Cathedral and members of other Christian communions was read. Hale&#x27;s ministry and influence in Western Australia had not been confined to the Anglican Church but involved active co-operation with other Christian groups in matters of common interest. In particular the Congregationalists commended him for originating and fostering &quot;institutions for promoting the moral and religious welfare of the community&quot; and for his &quot;truly missionary spirit&quot;. They were pleased that he was always ready to contend for the truth &quot;as it is in Jesus, ...&quot; They attributed the &quot;truly evangelical and peaceful character of his episcopate to his true love for the Bible, the word of God; ... .&quot; They also recognised his &quot;hearty co-operation with others&quot; not belonging to his church, concluding that they united with members of his church and all Protestant fellow colonists, in praying for his future welfare, peace and happiness.

The bishop acknowledged each address, thanking &quot;his dear friends&quot; for their very kind words, sometimes suggesting that his own contribution was not as much as stated, other times reminding &quot;his Sons and Daughters in the Lord Jesus Christ&quot; to whom he had ministered, that &quot;... my sole aim in my teaching has been to set forth faithfully and simply the blessed truths which are to be found in God&#x27;s Holy Word&quot;. He also referred to the &quot;mutual kindness and good will which exists between members of the different religious bodies in this country who hold to those great Scriptural doctrines which were ... brought to light a second time at the period of the Reformation, and which are to us more precious than rubies&quot;. In concluding his various replies he asked for their prayers for him in his difficult new task and assured them of his continuing prayers and interest in their affairs.

The editors of the local newspapers were lavish in their praise of the departing bishop. &quot;The Western Australian Times&quot;&#x27; farewell editorial began with the words &quot;We admire great men and give genius its due need of fame, but the good man gains not only our admiration but our hearts ... After outlining Hale&#x27;s many contributions to the life of the colony the editorial concluded with the following commendation of Hale &quot;He has shown us what a true christian pastor can do, and how the holding of a high and honoured office is not inconsistent with a brotherly bearing towards all, and that a helping hand and a kind word, go more to make up real christianity, than austere looks, and obstinate theories; and without disparagement of others, we fear we may say that &#x27;take him all in all we&#x27;ll never see his like again&#x27;.&quot;

The &quot;Perth Inquirer&quot; in its valedictory tribute commented &quot;There are few individuals among the more conspicuous leaders of any religious community upon whom suspicion ... has never breathed its taint. Bishop Hale is one of those few&quot;.

Hale not only left the people of Perth with much goodwill and positive memories of his ministry, he also presented to the church the bishop&#x27;s house and grounds which were his own private property. The value of these and other money given by him while he was in Western Australia probably totaled nearly £A10,000 - about A$1,000,000 in current (2014) value.

==Queensland==

Hale received an enthusiastic welcome when he was installed as second Bishop of Brisbane in St John&#x27;s Pro-Cathedral on 15 December 1875. In his first address to his new flock Hale made it clear that he had been brought to Queensland to deal with the problem of providing ministry to people in vast areas of country where there were no churches or clergymen. He would be powerless to do anything about it because of his lack of resources; resources, which in the absence of any state aid for religion in the colony, only could come from the freewill offerings of established congregations and individuals.

To deal with this lack of resources the General Church Fund was launched at a meeting in Brisbane on the evening of 23 March 1876. It was intended that each congregation in the diocese would contribute to the fund by passing on to the Diocesan Council the money received from weekly offerings on two Sundays every year. At the same time direct contributions were to be solicited from individuals to build up the capital sum. Hale himself was disappointed that some of the speeches at the meeting did not indicate a sense of &quot;the importance and the gravity of the matter which we met together to discuss&quot;. His opinion was supported by the lack of donations received.

Hale toured his region widely. He hoped and devoutly prayed that his visits from place to place would serve to bind Church of England people in the colony more closely together. Hale&#x27;s determined goal was to see the church &quot;act more in concert one with another than we have done&quot;. We must realise &quot;that we are all one body, united in our blessed Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, as to one Head, being all members one of another, as members of His body&quot;. Hale felt the concern of the present period of commercial depression, commenting &quot;That which hinders the performance of good works and holds people back from making adequate offerings to God, is very rarely the real inability to give. The hindrance arises in almost all cases from the want of a proper estimate of what is really owing to God, and from the weakness of men&#x27;s faith ... &quot;

Twelve months after Hale had arrived in Brisbane what had been given to the fund so far was completely inadequate. Hale felt that this situation indicated that his coming to Brisbane had been a mistake and so in January 1877 he submitted his resignation to Bishop Barker. After intervention by Bishop Barker, the people and churches in Brisbane were shamed into a commitment to support the General Church Fund and Hale withdrew his resignation. Nevertheless, despite Hale&#x27;s generous personal donations, the funds received were never sufficient to meet the needs.

At the second General Synod in Sydney in October 1876 Hale was appointed President of the Executive Council of the Board of Missions (later the Australian Board of Missions). In July 1878, with Hale&#x27;s encouragement, the Brisbane Synod established a Clergy Superannuation and Widows and Orphans Fund, while in the following year, after discussions between Hale and Bishop Barker, Synod recognised the establishment of the Diocese of North Queensland. In October 1881, as the senior bishop attending, Hale presided over the third General Synod in Sydney. Subsequently, he was involved in the negotiations which led to the appointment of Alfred Barry as Bishop of Sydney. In April 1884 he welcomed Barry and participated in his installation in Sydney.

A mark of Hale&#x27;s ministry in Brisbane as in Perth was his association with members of other Christian churches in causes of common interest. He presided at annual meetings of the local auxiliary of the Bible Society; he addressed a large gathering of Sunday school children in the Brisbane Botanic Gardens in May 1884; he identified himself with the Social Purity Society and its lobbying to change legislation that controlled prostitution; he laid the foundation stones for the Loyal Orange Institution&#x27;s New Protestant Hall in Ann Street and for the Lutheran Church in Wickham Terrace; he supported the YMCA, having chaired its inaugural meeting in December 1882, and also the work of Temperance societies concerned with the abuse of alcohol, as well as the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

The Bishop was farewelled on 19 March 1885 at a public gathering in the Exhibition Building, Bowen Hills by 700 to 800 people - Church of England, Presbyterian, Wesleyan, Lutheran, Scandinavian, Primitive Methodist, Congregational and Baptist. The Baptist Association in its farewell address had commended him for &quot;true catholicity&quot; and faithfulness to the principles of his own church. Hale responded &quot;There are in existence here evils of fearful magnitude, ... which are threatening to eat into the very heart of the social and domestic happiness of this community. By making common cause with others, and by working heartily with them, I may have been, I trust, through God&#x27;s mercy, able to do at least something towards checking these evils&quot;.

The Fortitude Valley branch of the Church of England Temperance Society concisely expressed its appraisal of Hale&#x27;s ministry. &quot;Your many acts of unostentatious charity, the ready help which you have always given to the promotion of evangelical religion, the generous sympathy which you have ever displayed in the cause of temperance, and the liberal and consistent spirit of Christianity which has characterised your Episcopate, have greatly endeared you to all classes of men among whom you have diligently laboured&quot;.

&quot;The Toowoomba Chronicle&quot; was forthright in its commendation of Hale&#x27;s goodness and openness to cooperation with others and scathing of those Anglicans who refused to follow his example. &quot;That the Church of England has not progressed during the past decade in the same ratio as the population is not the Bishop&#x27;s fault. He has had to exercise episcopal functions in a diocese divided against &#x27;itself.&#x27; ... The evangelical breadth of the Bishop has overstrained the unelastic charity of a few of the clergy&quot;.

The Chronicle&#x27;s editorial ended with an appreciation of Sabina Hale&#x27;s contribution to social work in the community, referring particularly to her good relationships with all the other ladies she had worked with, both Anglicans and those of &quot;other religious persuasions&quot;.

==Return to England==

Bishop Hale and his wife left Brisbane for Sydney on 27 March 1885. Four days later he handed his resignation letter to the Primate, Bishop Barry. Hale and his family sailed for England via Colombo in the P&amp;O mail steamer &quot;Thames&quot; on 2 May. After changing ships they arrived in England on 14 July. Hale lived in retirement at Clifton, Bristol, where he died on 3 April 1895. He was buried in the churchyard at Alderley, Gloucestershire. He was survived by his second wife Sabina, five sons and three daughters.

<text>Stanley Freeman Druckenmiller (born June 14, 1953) is an American billionaire investor, philanthropist and former hedge fund manager. He is the former chairman and president of Duquesne Capital, which he founded in 1981. He closed the fund in August 2010, at which time it had over $12 billion in assets. From 1988 to 2000, he managed money for George Soros as the lead portfolio manager for Quantum Fund. He is reported to have made $260 million in 2008.

==Early life and education==
Druckenmiller was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Anne and Stanley Thomas Druckenmiller, a chemical engineer. He grew up in a middle-class household in the suburbs of Philadelphia. His parents divorced when he was in elementary school and he went to live with his father in Gibbstown, New Jersey (a section of Greenwich Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey) and then in Richmond, Virginia (his sisters, Helen and Salley, would stay with their mother in Philadelphia). Druckenmiller is a graduate of Collegiate School, Richmond, Virginia. In 1975, he received a BA in English and economics from Bowdoin College (where he opened a hot dog stand with Lawrence B. Lindsey, who later became economic policy adviser to President George W. Bush). He dropped out of a Ph.D. program in economics at the University of Michigan in the middle of the second semester to accept a position as an oil analyst for Pittsburgh National Bank.

==Investment career==
Druckenmiller began his financial career in 1977 as a management trainee at Pittsburgh National Bank. He became head of the bank&#x27;s equity research group after one year. In 1981, he founded his own firm, Duquesne Capital Management.

In 1985, he became a consultant to Dreyfus, splitting his time between Pittsburgh and New York, where he lived two days each week. He moved to Pittsburgh full-time in 1986, when he was named head of the Dreyfus Fund. As part of his agreement with Dreyfus, he also maintained management of Duquesne. In 1988, he was hired by George Soros to replace Victor Niederhoffer at Quantum Fund. He and Soros famously &quot;broke the Bank of England&quot; when they shorted British pound sterling in 1992, reputedly making more than $1 billion in profits, in an event known as Black Wednesday. They calculated that the Bank of England did not have enough foreign currency reserves with which to buy enough sterling to prop up the currency and that raising interest rates would be politically unsustainable. He left Soros in 2000 after taking large losses in technology stocks. 

Since then, he has concentrated full-time on Duquesne Capital. He is profiled in the book &quot;The New Market Wizards&quot; by Jack D. Schwager. According to Bloomberg News, on August 18, 2010, Druckenmiller announced the closing of his hedge fund &quot;telling investors he&#x27;d been worn down by the stress of trying to maintain one of the best trading records in the industry while managing an &#x27;enormous amount of capital.&#x27;&quot; Duquesne Capital Management posts an average annual return of 30 percent without any money-losing year. His funds were down for about 5 percent when he announced his retirement in August. However, they had since erased the losses and closed with a small gain through successful bets that the market would rally in anticipation that the Federal Reserve would announce further &quot;Quantitative Easing&quot; to assist in reducing unemployment and avoid deflation.

According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, on August 18, 2010, Druckenmiller &quot;told clients that he&#x27;s returning their money and ending his firm&#x27;s 30-year run, citing the &#x27;high emotional toll&#x27; of not performing up to his own expectations.&quot; He indicated it was not easy to make big profits while handling very large sums of money. His biggest investments are Microsoft and Amazon in 2020.

==Investment philosophy==
Druckenmiller is a top-down investor who adopts a similar trading style as George Soros by holding a group of stocks long, a group of stocks short, and uses leverage to trade futures and currency. In early 2019 he held large positions in Microsoft, Abbott Laboratories, Salesforce.com, Delta Airlines, and American Airlines.
==Personal life==
Druckenmiller has been married twice. In 1976, he married his high school sweetheart; they divorced in 1980. In 1988, Druckenmiller married Fiona Katharine Biggs, a Barnard College graduate and niece of investor Barton Biggs, in an Episcopalian ceremony. Druckenmiller has three daughters with Biggs.

==Political and economic views==
Druckenmiller advocates reducing spending on social safety net programs such as Social Security. Druckenmiller was a major supporter of Republican Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey. In 2015, Druckenmiller donated $300,000 total to the presidential candidacies of Christie, Jeb Bush, and John Kasich. In 2023, Druckenmiller endorsed Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries. The following year, Druckenmiller stated that he would be voting for neither Donald Trump or Kamala Harris in the 2024 United States presidential election.

In 2020, after the stock market crash and subsequent rally above pre-crash levels, Druckenmiller said he expects inflation in the US economy due to actions taken by the Federal Reserve. He made a similar warning in 2013 during an address at Bowdoin College in which he noted that, since 1994, he has been concerned that spending on government entitlement programs would lead to an economic crisis worse than the financial collapse of 2008.

==Wealth and philanthropy==
In 2009, Druckenmiller donated $705 million to foundations that support medical research, education, and anti-poverty, including a $100 million gift to found a Neuroscience Institute at the NYU School of Medicine. In 2010, Stanley Druckenmiller announced that he will close his Duquesne Capital hedge fund in order to spend more time on philanthropy, according to Bloomberg.com. Druckenmiller gave $700 million to his foundation last year and will apparently ramp that up in coming years.

Druckenmiller is also Chairman of the Board of Harlem Children&#x27;s Zone, a multi-faceted, community-based project. Harlem Children&#x27;s Zone was founded by Druckenmiller&#x27;s college friend and fellow Bowdoin College alumnus Geoffrey Canada. In 2006, Druckenmiller gave $25 million to the organization. In 2013, Druckenmiller and Canada toured college campuses urging reform in taxation, health care, and Social Security to ensure intergenerational equity.

Druckenmiller and his wife are also principal sponsors of the New York City AIDS walk. The Stanley F. Druckenmiller Hall, built in 1997 at Bowdoin College, is named after Druckenmiller&#x27;s grandfather and was dedicated to Bowdoin by Druckenmiller himself.

===Pittsburgh Steelers===
In July 2008, Druckenmiller emerged as a potential investor in the Pittsburgh Steelers franchise of the National Football League. The five sons of Steelers founder Art Rooney Sr. were working to restructure ownership of the team, and Druckenmiller was contacted by a member or representative of the Rooney family about buying the shares of several of the Rooney brothers. On September 18, Druckenmiller withdrew his bid to purchase the team.

Former Steelers President Dan Rooney stated that he has no ill will toward Druckenmiller, mentioning that he hopes the financier remains a great Steelers fan. NFL owners unanimously approved the restructuring of ownership on December 17, 2008, with Dan &amp; Art II getting the mandated 30% stake.

<doc id="1213375" wikidata="Q6307" url="?curid=1213375" title="Bad Gottleuba-Berggießhübel">
<text>Bad Gottleuba-Berggießhübel is a spa town in the district Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge in Saxony, in eastern Germany. The municipality borders the Czech Republic in the south. The municipality was formed on 1 January 1999 by the merger of the former municipalities Bad Gottleuba, Berggießhübel, Langenhennersdorf, and Bahratal. Surrounded by forests and near a water dam, Bad Gottleuba-Berggießhübel has several facilities including a spa health park, a plant garden, and a heated open air pool.

==Geography==
The following villages are part of the municipality: Oelsen in the southeast, Markersbach and Hellendorf in the southeast, Hartmannsbach, Breitenau, Börnersdorf, and Hennersbach in the southwest, Bad Gottleuba and Berggießhübel in the central part, and Zwiesel, Bahra, and Langenhennersdorf in the north. The municipality extends up to the foothills of the eastern Ore Mountains and into the Saxon Switzerland. The united spa town is located between the rivers Gottleuba and Bahra. The main settlements Bad Gottleuba and Berggießhübel are on the river Gottleuba.

Distances from Berggießhübel which is more or less in the centre of the combined spa town:
*25–35 km from Dresden
*7–11 km from Pirna
*200 km from Berlin
*135 km from Prague

Since 2005 the town has been easily accessible via the A17 express motorway Dresden–Prague.

==History==
In 1459, the boundaries were fixed between Bohemia and Saxony by a contract between the Bohemian king and Frederick II and Duke William III of Saxony, and the area of the current municipality came to Saxony. In 1813, during the Napoleonic Wars, the area suffered damages from battles between the Russians and the French. In 1880, a railway line from Pirna to Berggießhübel was opened. As the Gottleuba Valley Railway it was extended to Gottleuba in 1905, and it closed in 1976. The Gottleuba Dam in the Gottleuba river was built between 1965 and 1974.

===Oelsen===
Oelsen is the oldest settlement of the municipality, first mentioned in 1169 as &quot;Olesnice&quot;. The name originates from the Czech &quot;olešná&quot;, meaning alder bush. It was one of the first colonised areas of the Knights Hospitaller in the Ore Mountains. In 1429, the Hussites destroyed Oelsen. It wasn&#x27;t rebuilt until the end of the 15th century.

In 1517 the manor of Oelsen was acquired by the Bünau family, who held it until 1762. At the end of World War II, on 9 May 1945, surviving prisoners of a death march from the Porschdorf subcamp of the Flossenbürg concentration camp were liberated near Oelsen.

In 1996, Oelsen joined Bad Gottleuba.

===and Hellendorf===
Markersbach was first documented as &quot;Marquardi villa&quot; in 1363. Hellendorf was first mentioned as &quot;Heldisdorf&quot; in 1379. Its school was opened in 1837 and another in 1858. The current school was inaugurated in 1927. In 1970, the two villages were merged into the new municipality &quot;Bahratal&quot;.

===Gottleuba===

Gottleuba was first mentioned in 1363 as &quot;Gotlavia&quot;, but it probably already existed at the end of the 13th century. In 1298 Gottleuba together with Pirna became a part of Bohemia. In 1405 Pirna and Gottleuba were taken back by the Margrave of Meissen.

Already at the end of the 14th century Gottleuba was a center for mining, mainly iron, silver, and copper. The last silver mine was closed in 1889. In 1463, Gottleuba received town privileges. In the 16th century, Gottleuba developed guilds with special commercial laws (for example, holding of spring and autumn markets and grant of weekly markets). Wars, disease, large town fires in 1746 and 1865, and the flood disasters of 1552, 1897, 1927, and 1957 again brought considerable setbacks to the city.

A recuperation centre belonging to the Landesversicherungsanstalt Sachsen was built in Gottleuba in 1909. In 1936 the name was officially changed to Bad Gottleuba. Since 1991, the sanatorium which is named &quot;Gesundheitspark Bad Gottleuba&quot; has been under the charge of TRIA Immobilienanlagen und Verwaltungs-GmbH in Berlin.

===Berggießhübel===
Berggießhübel was first mentioned as &quot;Gyßhobel&quot; in 1412. The origin of the name is disputed, one likely explanation is &quot;the mountain where ore is melted and poured&quot;. In 1548 it received town privileges. The Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) interrupted the iron works. In 1717, medicinal water was found and Berggießhübel became a spa town. The baths were damaged in the Napoleonic Wars, but in 1822 the business was rebuilt by Friedrich August Freiherr von Leyßer.

With the opening of a railway line from Pirna to Berggießhübel in 1880, the region attracted more visitors. In 1993, the MEDIAN-klinik was opened in the area of &quot;Friedrichstal&quot;.

===Langenhennersdorf and Bahra===
Langenhennersdorf was first mentioned as &quot;Hennici villa&quot; in 1356 and was assigned to the Margrave of Meissen in 1404. Bahra was mentioned for the first time in 1524. The name originates from the Old High German &quot;bar&quot; and &quot;para&quot;, meaning &quot;cleared forest&quot;.

Bahra was assigned to the knightly manor (&quot;Rittersgut&quot;) of Langenhennersdorf in 1548. In 1838, a school was opened in Langenhennersdorf. In 1971, Langenhennersdorf and Bahra became a single municipality.

==Local council==
The local council has 16 members. Since the elections in May 2014 the CDU has 11 seats and the Left has 5 seats.

==Main sights==
*Saxon post milestone (&quot;Postmeilensäule&quot;)
*Gottleuba Dam

<text>Anand Lal Shimpi (born June 26, 1982) is a former tech journalist and American businessman who is the founder of the technology website AnandTech, a hardware news/review site. He wrote a book in 2001, titled &quot;The Anandtech Guide to PC Gaming Hardware&quot;. He retired at the age of 32 from the publishing industry to join the hardware division at Apple Inc. in 2014.

Shimpi started AnandTech when he was 15 years old. The site originally focused on motherboard reviews and was hosted on GeoCities. Over a period of 17 years, the site grew to be one of the most respected sites for tech reviews.

== Early life ==
Anand was born to Lalchand Shimpi, an Indian-born computer science professor at St Augustine&#x27;s University, and Razieh, an Iranian-born teacher in Raleigh, NC. When Shimpi was in third grade, his father enrolled him in a computer course. He built his first PC in sixth grade and soon began building PCs for others. He is a graduate of William G. Enloe GT/IB Center for the Humanities, Sciences, and the Arts and North Carolina State University with a degree in Computer Engineering with emphasis on microprocessor architecture and design.

== Career ==
Anand started AnandTech in 1997 at the age of 15. He called it Anand&#x27;s Hardware Tech Page. He first started reviewing motherboards; later he would go on to review CPUs, hard drives, RAM, and other computer components. His tech reviews were in-depth and thorough, making it the preferred site for hardware engineers and enthusiasts and receiving praise from spokespersons at AMD and Intel. He served as its editor-in-chief from 1997 to 2014. AnandTech grew from a small GeoCities website in 1997 to a 50 million page view per month publication . He reportedly was able to get his hands on an AMD K6-III before any other reviewers.

In 2013 he was named as an expert in the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

On August 30, 2014, he announced his decision to retire from the technology publishing industry to work at Apple&#x27;s hardware technologies division and named longtime AnandTech editor Ryan Smith as his successor.

On February 15, 2020, Bloomberg reported that Anand sent confidential documents to Gerard Williams III after the latter had left Apple to form NUVIA.

== Publications ==
Anand is the author of the book The &quot;AnandTech Guide to PC Gaming Hardware&quot; () and has a regular column in &quot;Computer Power user (CPU) Magazine&quot; called Anand&#x27;s Corner.

<text>Pinnacle Entertainment was an entertainment group based in the United Kingdom spanning many divisions and primarily known as one of the UK&#x27;s leading independent record labels and distributors.

==History==
In 1996, Windsong/Pinnacle was purchased by the Zomba Group. When Zomba was subsequently purchased by BMG in 2002, Windsong/Pinnacle was moved under Bertelsmann&#x27;s group Arvato AG. In January 2008, Windsong completed a buyout from Arvato, gaining independent ownership again. During the Great Recession, the company went into administration, effective December 3, 2008. It was then that Windsong Exports purchased the group and turned it into the UK&#x27;s leading music distributor. Following that, the companies were usually referred to jointly as Windsong/Pinnacle.

==Divisions==

===Audio Services===
Pinnacle&#x27;s music division Audio Services Ltd., was primarily known for the distribution of over 400 independent record labels in the UK, but it also consisted of its own record label, label management for distributed labels, and marketing and sales divisions.

====Record labels====
*Pinnacle Records (artists include Flintlock, James Arthur Edwards)
*Firebird Records (artists included Nick Straker)
*Collins Classics – formed in 1989, closed in 1998.

===Pinnacle Software===
Formed in 1992, Pinnacle Software serves as a publishing company that represents many computer software companies such as 3MV, New Note, Shellshock and Beechwood. It provides retail, sales, marketing and logistics services to its publishing partners. Deals with Electronic Arts and Ubisoft helped introduce an exclusive distribution model to the UK Software market. Some brands associated with Pinnacle Software include FIFA, Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia.

===Gauntlet Entertainment===
Formed in 1996, Gauntlet Entertainment was a distributor of video games. Formed by Peter Rezon to create a focused distribution model for video games, similar to what Pinnacle Software had been doing with other UK software companies. The distribution model they pioneered became the de facto model used by most major software publishers in the UK. Gauntlet Entertainment succeeded in doing so with ground breaking deals with Sierra, NovaLogic, THQ International, CDV Software and many other International Publishing houses. It has been associated with many of the top brands in the market place, including WWE Smackdown!, Cossacks, Rugrats, Warcraft, Half Life, Scooby Doo, Tetris and many more.

<doc id="1213403" wikidata="Q1551705" url="?curid=1213403" title="Modern Records">
<text>Modern Records (Modern Music Records before 1947) was an American record company and label formed in 1945 in Los Angeles by the Bihari brothers. Modern&#x27;s artists included Etta James, Joe Houston, Little Richard, Ike &amp; Tina Turner and John Lee Hooker. The label released some of the most influential blues and R&amp;B records of the 1940s and 1950s.

==History==
In the beginning, Modern bought master recordings from other small labels, as with the purchase of 32 unreleased Gold Star Records master recordings by Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins and Lil&#x27; Son Jackson for $2,500 from Bill Quinn in 1951. The Biharis also often used pseudonyms to give themselves writing credit on songs. Saul Bihari, for example, (whose middle name was Samuel) used the name Sam Ling as a songwriting pseudonym. Having started as an R&amp;B label, Modern was later one of the few R&amp;B labels to routinely cover rhythm and blues hits on other labels, apparently in an attempt to broaden their appeal and reach the popular market.

In 1958, the Bihari brothers formed Kent Records and stopped issuing records on Modern. In 1964, the Modern imprint was revived and the Ikettes released a few successful singles in 1965, but the company went bankrupt a few years later and ceased operations. The catalog went with the management into Kent Records. This back catalog was eventually licensed to the UK label Ace Records in the 1980s and later sold outright during the 1990s. Ace Records of the U.K. now owns the master tapes.

==Management and staff==
* Saul, Jules and Joe Bihari were the main people who ran the label. Their older brother Lester was only there sporadically.
*Ike Turner was a talent scout and session musician for Modern Records in the 1950s. Artists Turner discovered for Modern include Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, and Rosco Gordon. According to B.B. King and Joe Bihari, Turner introduced King to the Bihari brothers which led to his RPM releases.
*Tony Hilder was an A&amp;R man for Modern Records in the late 1950s. Later he went on to form his own labels, first CT Records and later owner and president of Impact Records.
* Austin McCoy was an artist, session musician and recording session director with Modern Records. He left Modern in late 1950 to take up an A&amp;R post with Mercury Records at their Beverly Hills office.

==Albums==
* &quot;Modern Music: The First Year – 1945&quot; (Ace CDTOP 1339, 2012)

<text>Ferdinand Charles (17 May 1628 – 30 December 1662) was the Archduke of Further Austria, including Tyrol, from 1646 to 1662.

As the son of Archduke Leopold V and Claudia de&#x27; Medici, he succeeded his father upon the latter&#x27;s death in 1632, under his mother&#x27;s regency. He took over his mother&#x27;s governatorial duties when he came of age in 1646. To finance his extravagant living style, he sold goods and entitlements. For example, he wasted the exorbitant sum which France had to pay to the Tyrolean Habsburgs for the cession of their fiefs west of the Rhine (Alsace, Sundgau and Breisach). He also fixed the border to Graubünden in 1652.

Ferdinand Charles was an absolutist ruler, did not call any diet after 1648 and had his chancellor Wilhelm Biener executed illegally in 1651 after a secret trial. On the other hand, he was a lover of music: Italian opera was performed in his court.

== Marriage, children and death ==
Ferdinand Charles married Anna de&#x27; Medici. She was a daughter of Cosimo II de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and Maria Magdalena of Austria († 1631). They had three children:

*Claudia Felicitas of Austria (30 May 1653 – 8 April 1676). Married Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor.
*Daughter (born and died 19 July 1654), died at birth.
*Maria Magdalena of Austria (17 August 1656 – 21 January 1669).

He died in Kaltern.

<doc id="1213411" wikidata="Q159558" url="?curid=1213411" title="Cormus domestica">
<text>Cormus domestica, commonly known as service tree or sorb tree, is a species of tree native to western, central and southern Europe, northwest Africa (Atlas Mountains), and southwest Asia (east to the Caucasus). It may be called true service tree, to distinguish it from wild service tree. It is the only species in the monotypic genus &quot;Cormus.&quot;
It is a deciduous tree growing to (rarely to ) tall with a trunk up to diameter, though it can also be a shrub tall on exposed sites. The bark is brown, smooth on young trees, becoming fissured and flaky on old trees. The winter buds are green, with a sticky resinous coating. The leaves are long, pinnate with 13–21 leaflets long and broad, with a bluntly acute apex, and a serrated margin on the outer half or two thirds of the leaflet. The flowers are diameter, with five white petals and 20 creamy-white stamens; they are produced in corymbs diameter in late spring, and are hermaphrodite and insect pollinated. The fruit is a pome long, greenish-brown, often tinged red on the side exposed to sunlight; it can be either apple-shaped (f. &quot;pomifera&quot; (Hayne) Rehder) or pear-shaped (f. &quot;pyrifera&quot; (Hayne) Rehder).

==Ecology==
&quot;Cormus domestica&quot; is generally rare, listed as an endangered species in Switzerland and Austria, and uncommon in Spain. In the UK, one very old tree that existed in the Wyre Forest before being destroyed by fire in 1862 used to be considered native, but it is now generally considered to be more likely of cultivated origin, probably from a mediaeval monastery orchard planting. More recently, a small population of genuinely wild specimens was found growing as stunted shrubs on cliffs in south Wales (Glamorgan) and nearby southwest England (Gloucestershire). It is a very rare species in Britain, occurring at only a handful of sites. Its largest English population is within the Horseshoe Bend Site of Special Scientific Interest at Shirehampton, near Bristol.

A further population has been discovered growing wild in Cornwall on a cliff in the upper Camel Estuary.

It is a long-lived tree, with ages of 300–400 years estimated for some in Britain.

The largest and perhaps one of the oldest known specimens in Europe is on an educational trail near the town of Strážnice in the province of Moravia, Czech Republic. Its trunk measures in circumference, with a crown high and across. It is estimated to be around 450 years old.

==Cultivation and uses==

The fruit is a component of a cider-like drink which is still made in parts of Europe. Picked straight off the tree, it is highly astringent and gritty; however, when left to blet (overripen) it sweetens and becomes pleasant to eat. In the Moravian Slovakia region of the Czech Republic, there is a community-run museum with an educational trail and a festival for this tree, with products like jam, juice and brandy made from its fruit.

The sorb tree is cited in the Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Ketubot, page 79a. The example refers to a purchase of Abba Zardasa, in a translation by Rashi, an early Medieval scholar, as a forest of trees called Zardasa, that was used for lumber, because the fruit was not commercially important. The Aramaic word &#x27;zardasa&#x27; may be the origin of the English word &#x27;sorb&#x27;.

In Ancient Greece the fruit was cut in half and pickled, which Plato in the Symposium (190d7-8) has Aristophanes use as a metaphor for the cutting in half of the original spherical humans by Zeus.

Service tree wood was often used for manufacturing wooden planes of all types used for working wood, because Service tree wood is fairly dense and holds a profile well.

==Etymology and other names==
The English name comes from Middle English &quot;serves&quot;, plural of &quot;serve&quot;, from Old English &quot;syrfe&quot;, borrowed from the Latin name &quot;sorbus&quot;; it is unrelated to the verb &quot;serve&quot;. Other English names include sorb, sorb tree, and whitty pear—&quot;whitty&quot; because the leaves are similar to rowan (i.e. pinnate), and &quot;pear&quot; due to the shape of the fruit. The name &quot;sorb&quot;, likewise, is from the Latin &quot;sorbus&quot;; because of its fruit and has nothing to do with the Slavic ethnic groups known as the &quot;Sorbs&quot; and &quot;Serbs&quot;.

<text>Canaan Records is a Christian record label and is a subsidiary of Word Entertainment.

== History ==
The label was started in 1965, by Marvin Norcross, for the label&#x27;s Southern gospel quartets. Their biggest artist to date is the Happy Goodman Family. After being absent from the southern gospel music industry for several years, Word Entertainment revived the Canaan Records label in 2007, placing Dave Clark as the General Manager of the label and announcing Canaan&#x27;s relaunch on June 6, 2007. The first group to sign with the label after the relaunch was Southern gospel veteran group, The Hoppers. They released their first Canaan Records album, &quot;The Ride&quot;, on September 4, 2007.

Early labels were red with black print. Later, the label changed to black with a color logo and a distinctive vertical row of colored dots down the middle of the label. In the mid-1980s, the label changed to a full color label showing a desert town (presumably Canaan) at sunset, with colors fading from green to yellow to orange in the sky, and tones of brown for the sand. For the 2007 relaunch of Canaan Records, the logo was changed to display the word &quot;Canaan&quot; in a script-style font, with the word &quot;RECORDS&quot; below in a sans-serif font. The label name was surrounded on either side by arching curves, implying an oval shape around the words. In 2009, Word Records again closed the doors on Canaan Records.

<doc id="1213422" wikidata="Q2887938" url="?curid=1213422" title="Battle of El Caney">
<text>The Battle of El Caney was fought on July 1, 1898, during the Spanish-American War. 600 Spanish soldiers held for twelve hours, until they ran out of ammunition, against Henry W. Lawton&#x27;s 5th US Division, made up of 6,899 men. This action temporarily delayed the American advance on the San Juan Hills, as had been requested of General William Rufus Shafter. Nevertheless, American forces advanced on San Juan Hill the same day. Though encountering spirited resistance similar to &quot;El Caney&quot;, the Americans were ultimately victorious, culminating in the capitulation of the Spanish garrison.

==Background==
At El Caney, Cuba, 514 Spanish regular soldiers, together with approximately 100 armed Spanish and Cubans loyal to Spain under the command of Brigadier General Joaquín Vara de Rey y Rubio were instructed to hold the northwest flank of Santiago de Cuba against the American 2nd Division, Fifth Army Corps, commanded by Brigadier General Henry W. Lawton.

==Battle==
Although the Spanish defenders had no machine guns, they were well equipped with modern smokeless powder rifles and a battery of two modern breech-loading 80mm mountain howitzers (&quot;Cañón de 8 cm Plasencia Modelo 1874&quot;, designed by Colonel Plasencia of the Spanish Army) that also utilized smokeless ammunition. The Spanish regular infantry was armed with fast-firing M1893 7mm Mauser rifles, while the loyalists were equipped with single-shot Remington Rolling Block rifles in .43 Spanish (using blackpowder). Denied promised reinforcements from Santiago, Vara de Rey and his forces held over 6,000 Americans from their position for nearly twelve hours before retreating, preventing General Lawton&#x27;s men from reinforcing the U.S. assault on San Juan Hill.

Some of the American forces were hindered by their equipment; in the case of the 2nd Massachusetts, the men were equipped with antiquated black-powder single-shot .45-70 Springfield rifles. According to Frederick E. Pierce, a trooper of the 2nd Massachusetts, the Americans &quot;received such a shower of bullets that it seemed at one time as if the company must be wiped out of existence.&quot; Because of this unequal contest, the 2nd Massachusetts was later taken out of the line and replaced with troops armed with more modern weapons.

The American forces also lacked effective support fire, as the single Gatling Gun Detachment had been sent to support the troops assaulting San Juan heights. General Lawton&#x27;s artillery support consisted of a single battery of four 3.2-inch (81 mm) Model 1885 field guns—light breech-loading rifled cannon using black-powder ammunition. The relatively short range of the American gun battery—together with the signature cloud of black smoke generated with each volley—forced gun crews to endure a fusillade of Mauser rifle fire from the Spanish defenders. General Lawton&#x27;s initial decision to continually shift the battery&#x27;s fire to multiple targets resulted in minimal effect on the Spanish strongpoints. Continued assaults took a heavy toll of the attackers. During the fighting, General Vara del Rey was wounded in both legs. While being evacuated on a stretcher, Vara del Rey and his escorts came under intense American fire. Vara del Rey and several Spanish officers accompanying the group (including one of the General&#x27;s sons) were killed by American fire as they tried to evacuate. His body was later found after the battle by a group of Spanish officers sent to locate him, and he was buried nearby. Despite Vara del Rey&#x27;s death, Spanish resistance continued.

After an initial repulse, Lawton ordered his battery of four 3.2-inch guns, commanded by Capt. Allyn Capron, to concentrate fire on the &quot;El Viso&quot; strongpoint in the Spanish defenses. Capron&#x27;s guns successfully breached the strongpoint walls at a range of 1,000 yards. An attack was then launched by two U.S. infantry regiments, the 12th Infantry and the 25th Infantry, and after a bloody firefight, &quot;El Viso&quot; was captured. Private T. C. Butler, Company H, 25th Infantry, was the first man to enter the blockhouse at El Caney, and took possession of the Spanish colors. Once &quot;El Viso&quot; was taken, the U.S. battery reduced each Spanish strongpoint in turn. The fighting ended about 5:00pm with the withdrawal of the Spanish troops.

==Aftermath==
Though eventually successful, the attack on the fortifications of El Caney had proved to be of little real value. The attack on two strongly defended points at both El Caney and San Juan diluted the strength of American forces, resulting in delays and additional casualties.

About 185 Spanish escaped to the north, but Vara del Rey, his two sons, and his brother perished. One of the Spanish wounded was Colonel Salvador Diaz Ordóñez, who commanded the Spanish artillery and was the designer of the Ordóñez guns that the Spanish used as coastal artillery in Cuba.

Approximately 400–600 of the retreating Spanish defenders at El Caney later participated in a hastily organized counterattack against troopers of the U.S. 3rd Cavalry and the 1st Volunteer Cavalry atop Kettle Hill. After closing to within 200 yards of Kettle Hill, they were taken under fire at a range of 600 yards by a single ten-barrel .30 Gatling Gun atop San Juan Hill manned by Sgt. Green of the Gatling Gun Detachment. According to Spanish commanders captured after the battle, all but 40 of the 600 attacking Spanish troops were killed by the Gatling gun fire.

General Vara del Rey&#x27;s body was relocated where it had been buried and was exhumed five months after the battle by a Spanish commission. The commission members were accompanied by Cuban Captain Alberto Plochet and a sergeant, who recognized the general by his insignia, his long beard, and an enormous Remington bullet hole in his skull.

<text>Chamaemespilus is a genus of shrubs in the family Rosaceae. It is monotypic, being represented by the single species Chamaemespilus alpina, commonly known as false medlar or dwarf whitebeam. It is native to the mountains of central and southern Europe, from the Pyrenees east through the Alps to the Carpathians and the Balkans, growing at elevations of up to 2500 m.

==Description==
&quot;Chamaemespilus alpina&quot; is a deciduous shrub growing to 2–3 m tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, oval-elliptic, 3–7 cm long, with an acute apex and a serrated margin; they are green on both sides, without the white felting found on most whitebeams. The flowers are pink, with five forward-pointing petals 5–7 mm long; they are produced in corymbs 3–4 cm diameter. The fruit is an oval red pome 10–13 mm diameter.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Chamaemespilus alpina&quot; is the sole species in a group that has been variously classified as the genus &quot;Chamaemespilus&quot; or &quot;Sorbus&quot; subgenus &quot;Chamaemespilus&quot;, distinguished from other subgenera of &quot;Sorbus&quot; by the pink (not white) flowers with forward-pointing petals (not opening flat). More recently, it has become clear that the simple-leafed species traditionally included in &quot;Sorbus&quot; form a monophyletic group, and this species could be included in a clade called &quot;Aria&quot; (genus &quot;Aria&quot; or &quot;Sorbus&quot; subgenus &quot;Aria&quot;).

<text>Alcides Arguedas Díaz (July 15, 1879 in La Paz – May 6, 1946 in Chulumani) was a Bolivian writer and historian. His literary work, which had a profound influence on the Bolivian social thought in the first half of the twentieth century, addresses issues related to national identity, miscegenation, and indigenous affairs. His most significant work, &quot;Raza de bronce&quot; (&quot;Bronze Race&quot;) (1919), is considered one of the most influential Bolivian literary works and a precursor of indigenism.

==Background and political and diplomatic roles==
Son of Fructuoso Arguedas and Sabina Diaz, Arguedas studied in the Ayacucho school and then Law and Political Science (1904) at the Universidad Mayor de San Andrés and sociology in La Paz.

He began working in various forms of media as a student, beginning with the Peruvian newspaper &quot;El Comercio&quot;, moving on to columns for &quot;El Diario&quot;, the short-lived &quot;Revista de América&quot; and &quot;El Mundial&quot;, and eventually becoming deputy editor of &quot;El Debate&quot; in 1915.

As a diplomat, he was second secretary of the Legation of Bolivia in Paris (1910), where he would meet Rubén Darío and Francisco Garcia Calderon and would have as boss the ex-president Ismael Montes. Subsequently, he was sent to London.

After returning to Bolivia, he was elected deputy of the Bolivia&#x27;s Liberal Party in 1916, and served as Bolivian representative to the creation of the League of Nations (1918). He also was consul general in Paris (1922) and minister plenipotentiary in Colombia (1929), where he was dismissed for criticizing the President Hernando Siles (1930).

He maintained a critical stance toward certain political administrations, for which he was removed from office, exiled, and even slapped by then-President Germán Busch. He became senator for the department of La Paz and eventually led the Liberal Party.

Under the administration of President Enrique Peñaranda, he served as Minister of Agriculture, Colonization, and Immigration (1940), and then left for Venezuela as minister plenipotentiary (1941).

==Writer==
Arguedas is one of Bolivia&#x27;s best-known writers. His work describes the relationship between Bolivian society and its indigenous peoples, often cynically. Through his books, full of social analysis, he sought a solution for his country&#x27;s permanent state of conflict. Some of the issues for which he contributed a significant amount of thought—conflicts between cultures, the complexities of mestizaje, and the sometimes violent relationship between the indigenous and creole/mestizo worlds—were later taken up by other currents of thought, including indigenismo, albeit from a different perspective.

His first literary works date from his student days, and the first book he published was &quot;Pisagua&quot;, a novel which appeared in 1903. In the subsequent year, he wrote &quot;Wata-Wara&quot;. His novelistic production would continue with &quot;Vida criolla&quot; (1912) and culminate with &quot;Raza de bronce&quot;.

His essay &quot;Pueblo enfermo&quot; (&quot;sick people&quot; or &quot;sick town&quot;), published in Barcelona in 1909, solidified his importance in Latin American letters, earning praise from major writers such as Miguel de Unamuno and Amado Nervo. However, it created controversy in Bolivia, and Franz Tamayo responded critically to his ideas in a series of editorials that would later be compiled as his book &quot;Pedagogía de la educación nacional&quot;. Arguedas coined the term &quot;radical pessimism&quot; for his stance on indigenous issues, explaining that it came from &quot;a mixture of fatal biological laws, historical reasons and environmental circumstances [that] have made the indigenous an atrophied or infirm race&quot;. Unsurprisingly, some critics identify Arguedas with some of the more distasteful aspects of the Bolivia of his time and reject his relationship with &quot;indigenismo&quot; 

However, in his most important novel, &quot;Raza de bronce&quot; (&quot;Bronze Race&quot;), Arguedas lays out several themes that would later be instrumental in the development of Bolivian literature: the creole-mestizo oppression against indigenous peoples, their capacity to rise in the face of these abuses, the social placement of the &quot;cholo-mestizo&quot; (a term, now more commonly a slur, for those mestizos whose indigenous parentage exceeds their European), and the rift between creole and indigenous societies in Bolivia.

Arguedas worked on this novel almost until his death. Although he published his first edition in 1919, he continued correcting and re-editing it until he released the definitive edition in 1945. The plot of &quot;Raza de bronce&quot; is an evolution of his second novel, &quot;Wata-Wara&quot;, which went relatively unnoticed at the time of publication. In retrospect, despite widespread criticism, it was listed by experts as one of the essential works of Bolivian literature.

Over the years, Arguedas found history to be a more direct medium for reflecting upon and interpreting Bolivian social reality. His first historical book, &quot;La fundación de la República&quot;, was published in 1920. This marked a turning point in Arguedas&#x27;s life: from here, history and politics came to the fore and his work in literature became secondary.

The first volume of his &quot;Historia general de Bolivia&quot; was published two years later under the auspices of industrialist and millionaire Simon I. Patino. He completed only five of the eight projected volumes of that collection, ranging from the colonial period to its violent 19th-century era of caudillismo.

Arguedas received the Rome Prize in France for his autobiographical book &quot;La danza de las sombras&quot; in 1935.

==Personal life==
Arguedas was married to Laura Tapia Carro from 1910 until her death in 1935. The couple had three daughters.

In 1945, after spending a period of time in Buenos Aires, he returned to Bolivia and died of leukemia in Chulumani, a district of La Paz, on May 6, 1946, at the age of 66.

<doc id="1213428" wikidata="Q4115988" url="?curid=1213428" title="Hakim ibn Hizam">
<text>Ḥakīm ibn Ḥizām (Arabic: حكيم بن حزام) was a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and a nephew of Khadija. Born 13 years before the event of elephants (Aam-ul-Feel) in Mecca, Arabia, he was the son of Khadija&#x27;s brother, Hizam ibn Khuwaylid, and Fakhita bint Zuhayr. Known for his acumen in commerce and his charitable acts, Hakim ibn Hizam was a respected merchant and a key figure in the Quraysh tribe. He embraced Islam during the conquest of Mecca and was known for his generosity, having manumitted a hundred slaves and distributed alms extensively. His close familial ties with Khadija and his contributions to the early Muslim community in Islamic history.

==Family==
He was the son of Khadija&#x27;s brother, Hizam ibn Khuwaylid, and of Fakhita bint Zuhayr. Fakhita and Hizam had 10 children: Hakim (Fakhita took by her kunya Umm Hakim and Hizam took by his kunya Abu Hakim), Hizam, Hisham, Khalid, Abdullah, Yahya, Umm Hashim (Hashima), Umm Amr (Amira), Umm Sumaya (Sumaya), Umm Khawla (Khawla).

He married his cousin, Zaynab bint al-Awwam ibn Khuwaylid, and they had at least three sons: Abdullah, Khalid (from whom he took his &quot;kunya&quot; Abu Khalid) and Yahya. He had a fourth son, Hisham, who may have been another son of Zaynab; but an alternative tradition names this son&#x27;s mother as Mulayka bint Malik of the Al-Harith clan of the Quraysh.

==Early life==
Hakim fought in the Sacrilegious War of 589-592. His father was killed in the second round, and Hakim said he saw Muhammad among the archers in the third round, when the Quraysh and Kinana tribes defeated the Qays. The following year, when the Quraysh finalised their peace treaty with the Qays tribe, Hakim was one of forty hostages who were left with the Qays until the blood-money was delivered.

Hakim became a merchant who speculated in corn. He sat among the elders and he was one of those who had the right to feed the pilgrims at the Kaaba. He was the original purchaser of the slave Zayd ibn Harithah, for whom he paid 400 &quot;dirhams&quot; and whom he gave to Khadija. Among his acts of charity, he manumitted a hundred slaves and he slaughtered a hundred camels to distribute in alms.

His house was part of the same building as Khadija&#x27;s; and his uncle Awwam ibn Khuwaylid lived next door. Hence, when Muhammad married Khadija, Hakim became his near neighbour.

==Early Islam (610–630)==
When Muhammad declared himself to be a prophet in 610, Hakim took no interest. He was neither a strong ally nor a leader among the opposition.

It is said that at the time of the boycott of the Hashim clan (616-619), Hakim sold flour to his aunt Khadija. On his way to deliver it, he met Abu Jahl, who restrained him and said: &quot;Are you taking food to the Hashim clan? Before you and your food move from here, I will denounce you in Mecca!&quot; Hakim&#x27;s cousin Abu&#x27;l-Bakhtari arrived on the scene, asked what was going on and told Abu Jahl that he should let Hakim deliver his aunt&#x27;s own food. Abu Jahl still refused, and the quarrel came to blows. Abu&#x27;l-Bakhtari hit Abu Jahl with a camel&#x27;s jaw, knocking him to the ground, and trod on him.

Nevertheless, in September 622 (after Khadija&#x27;s death and the Second pledge at al-Aqabah), Hakim was among the council of elders who plotted to assassinate Muhammad.

He fought with the Meccans at the Battle of Badr. In later life he was very reluctant to speak about this. On being pressed for information, he claimed that he had hated marching towards Badr; that it was all Satan’s fault; and that he had seen the angels who assisted the Muslims in the battle. When he heard that Abu Sufyan&#x27;s caravan had been saved, he urged the Quraysh to make peace with Muhammad. Nevertheless, he was not among those who turned back to Mecca; he fought the battle, and bore witness that the Quraysh were defeated when Muhammad threw a handful of pebbles at them. He continued to advance even when it was obvious that the battle was over. Eventually two of his cousins overtook him and carried him home on their camel.

Hakim was present at the killing of Khubayb bin Adi in Mecca in 625. Khubayb&#x27;s dying prayer was: &quot;O Allah, count them all and kill them one by one. Do not leave even one of them.&quot; Hakim was so frightened by this prayer that he hid himself in a tree.

==Conversion to Islam==
When the Quraysh expected Muhammad to invade Mecca, Abu Sufyan went out by night scouting for information about Muhammad&#x27;s movements, and Hakim was one of his assistants. But they did not learn anything useful. Hakim was taken by surprise when he was approached by Muhammad&#x27;s uncle Al-Abbas, who warned him that Muhammad had brought an army of ten thousand. &quot;Convert! I will protect you until you reach Allah&#x27;s Messenger, for I fear that you may be cut to pieces before you reach him.&quot; Hakim accompanied Al-Abbas to Muhammad&#x27;s tent, where he was interrogated and his declaration of faith was accepted. The next day, he assisted Abu Sufyan in shouting to the Meccans: &quot;O people of the Quraysh, why are you killing yourselves? Anyone who enters his house is protected. Anyone who lays down his weapons is protected.&quot; The people heeded their call and ran to their houses. Later that day, Hakim&#x27;s four sons all converted to Islam.

Hakim fought with Muhammad at the Battle of Hunayn. Afterwards, when Muhammad was distributing gifts to his new followers &quot;to win over their hearts,&quot; Hakim asked for a gift of a hundred camels, and then another hundred, and then a third hundred. Muhammad obliged him, but at the third donation he said: &quot;Hakim, this wealth is sweet greenness. Whoever takes it with generosity of soul will be blessed by it. Whoever takes it with pride will not be blessed by it, like a man who eats but is not satisfied. The upper hand [that gives] is better than the lower hand [that receives]. When you begin, start with your dependants!&quot; Hakim then declared, &quot;From this moment, I will never take anything from anyone!&quot; He took the first hundred camels and departed. Later, when Umar tried to give him gifts, he would not accept them.

Hakim&#x27;s family then emigrated to Medina and settled there.

==Narration of Hadith==
Hakim consulted Muhammad on matters related to trade. As he narrated: &quot;I bought some food and made food [i.e., cooked it] and made a profit on it before I took possession of it. I came to Allah&#x27;s Messenger and told him about that. He said: &#x27;Do not sell it until you take possession of it.&#x27;&quot; This hadith is considered very important in the development of Islamic contract law as it deals with the issue of short selling, options or futures contracts.

He narrated Muhammad&#x27;s teaching: &quot;The seller and the buyer have the right to keep or return goods as long as they have not parted or till they part; and if both the parties spoke the truth and described the defects and qualities, then they would be blessed in their transaction, and if they told lies or hid something, then the blessings of their transaction would be lost.&quot;

On being asked, Muhammad told Hakim that all his good deeds performed before he became a Muslim remained credited to him afterwards. After his conversion, Hakim freed another hundred slaves and donated another hundred camels in alms.

He also reported Muhammad&#x27;s prohibition on taking retaliation, reciting verses or inflicting &quot;hudud&quot; punishments inside a mosque.

==Later life==
In 656, when his cousin Zubayr ibn al-Awwam died leaving 2,200,000 (presumably &quot;dirhams&quot;) in debt, Hakim offered to relieve the family; however, it is not clear how much money he was offering them, as they did not accept anything.

When Marwan was appointed Governor of Medina in 662, Hakim was one of the welcoming party of elders who officially greeted him.

Before Islam, Hakim had bought for a bargain price the door to Mecca&#x27;s town hall. In the reign of Muawiyah I he sold it for 100,000 &quot;dirhams&quot;. The Caliph accused him of &quot;selling his family&#x27;s honour for a hundred thousand.&quot; Hakim countered that modern nobility was measured by piety, and since he intended to donate the full proceeds to charity, nobody had been cheated.

The Caliph asked him what food he ate, and he replied that he no longer had teeth. Soon afterwards, Muawiyah sent him a camel so that he could drink its milk, together with a cash present. Hakim returned the money with a reminder that he had never accepted his allotted share from the state treasury since the death of Muhammad.

He died in Medina in 674, claiming an age of 120 years.

<doc id="1213430" wikidata="Q506430" url="?curid=1213430" title="David Malouf">
<text>David George Joseph Malouf (; born 20 March 1934) is an Australian poet, novelist, short story writer, playwright and librettist. Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2008, Malouf has lectured at both the University of Queensland and the University of Sydney. He also delivered the 1998 Boyer Lectures.

Malouf&#x27;s 1974 collection &quot;Neighbours in a Thicket: Poems&quot; won the Grace Leven Prize for Poetry and the Australian Literature Society Gold Medal. His 1990 novel &quot;The Great World&quot; won numerous awards, including the 1991 Miles Franklin Award and Prix Femina Étranger His 1993 novel &quot;Remembering Babylon&quot; was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and won the 1994 Prix Femina Étranger, the 1994 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Prize for Fiction, the 1995 Prix Baudelaire and the 1996 International Dublin Literary Award. Malouf was awarded the Neustadt International Prize for Literature in 2000, the Australia-Asia Literary Award in 2008 and the Australia Council Award for Lifetime Achievement in Literature in 2016. He has been mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

==Early life==
Malouf was born in Brisbane, Australia, to a Christian Lebanese father and an English-born mother of Sephardi Jewish descent. His paternal family had immigrated from Lebanon in the 1880s, while his mother&#x27;s family had moved to England via the Netherlands, before migrating to Australia in 1913.

He attended Brisbane Grammar School and graduated from the University of Queensland with a B.A. degree in 1955. He lectured for a short period before moving to London, where he taught at Holland Park School, before relocating to Birkenhead in 1962. He returned to Australia in 1968, taught at his old school, and lectured in English at the Universities of Queensland and Sydney.

==Personal life==
Malouf identifies as gay.

He has lived in England and Tuscany, and for three decades spent most of his time in Sydney. Malouf now lives in Queensland.

==Writing==
Though he would later become known abroad for his prose works, Malouf initially concentrated on poetry. His first work appeared in 1962, as part of a book he shared with three more Australian poets.

His collection &quot;Neighbours in a Thicket: Poems&quot; (1974) features childhood memories, his mother, his sister, travelling in Europe and war.

1992 brought the publication of &quot;Poems, 1959–1989&quot;. Some of his poetry was also collected in &quot;Revolving Days: Selected Poems&quot; (2008), which is divided into four sections: on childhood, then Europe, then relocating to Sydney, then travelling between Europe and Australia.

Malouf&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Johnno&quot; (1975), is the semi-autobiographical tale of a young man growing up in Brisbane during the Second World War. Johnno engages in shoplifting and goes to brothels, which contrasts with his friend Dante&#x27;s middle-class conservatism. La Boite Theatre adapted it for stage in 2006.

Malouf began writing full-time in 1977.

&quot;An Imaginary Life&quot; (1978) is about the final years of Ovid.

Malouf&#x27;s 1982 novella about three acquaintances and their experience of the First World War was titled &quot;Fly Away Peter&quot;.

His epic novel &quot;The Great World&quot; (1990) tells the story of two Australians and their relationship amid the turmoil of two World Wars, including imprisonment by the Japanese during World War II.

His Booker Prize-shortlisted novel &quot;Remembering Babylon&quot; (1993) is set in northern Australia during the 1850s amid a community of English immigrant farmers (with one Scottish family) whose isolated existence is threatened by the arrival of a stranger, a young white man raised from boyhood by Indigenous Australians.

Malouf has written several collections of short stories, and a play, &quot;Blood Relations&quot; (1988). Australian critic Peter Craven described Malouf&#x27;s 2007 short-story collection &quot;Every Move You Make&quot; as &quot;as formidable and bewitching a collection of stories as you would be likely to find anywhere in the English-speaking world&quot;. Craven went on to state that &quot;No one else in this country has: the maintenance of tone, the expertness of prose, the easeful transition between lyrical and realist effects. The man is a master, a superb writer, and also (which is not the same thing) a completely sophisticated literary gent&quot;. &quot;The Complete Stories&quot; appeared in 2007.

Malouf has also written libretti for three operas (including &quot;Voss&quot;, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Patrick White and first produced in the 1986 Adelaide Festival of Arts conducted by Stuart Challender), and &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot; (with music by Michael Berkeley), which combines a semi-autobiographical story by Rudyard Kipling with Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Books&quot;.

Malouf published his memoir, titled &quot;12 Edmondstone Street&quot;, in 1985.

==Lecturing==
Malouf delivered the 1998 Boyer Lectures on ABC Radio.

==Themes and subject matter==
Malouf&#x27;s work tends to be set in Australia, though &quot;a European sensibility&quot; is also present.

His writing is characterised by a heightened sense of spatial relations, from the physical environments into which he takes his readers—whether within or outside built spaces, or in a natural landscape. He has likened each of his succession of novels to the discovery and exploration of a new room in a house, rather than part of an overarching development. &quot;At a certain point, you begin to see what the connections are between things, and you begin to know what space it is you are exploring.&quot; From his first novel &quot;Johnno&quot; onwards, his themes focused on &quot;male identity and soul-searching&quot;. He said that much of the male writing that preceded him &quot;was about the world of action. I don&#x27;t think that was ever an accurate description of men&#x27;s lives&quot;. He identified Patrick White as the writer who turned this around in Australian literature—that White&#x27;s writing was the kind &quot;that goes behind inarticulacy and or unwillingness to speak, writing that gives the language of feeling to people who don&#x27;t have it themselves&quot;.

Malouf also said that &quot;I knew that the world around you is only uninteresting if you can&#x27;t see what is really going on. The place you come from is always the most exotic place you&#x27;ll ever encounter because it is the only place where you recognise how many secrets and mysteries there are in people&#x27;s lives&quot;. However, after nearly four decades of writing, he concluded that in older writers can sometimes be found &quot;a fading of the intensity of the imagination, and ... of the interest in the tiny details of life and behaviour—you see [writers] getting a bit impatient with that.&quot;

==Awards and honours==
As well as his numerous accolades for fiction, Malouf was awarded the Pascall Prize for Critical Writing in 1988. In 2008, Malouf won the Australian Publishers Association&#x27;s Lloyd O&#x27;Neil Award for outstanding service to the Australian book industry. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2008. He is also an Honorary Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities.

<text>Sigismund Francis, Archduke of Further Austria (27 November 1630 – 25 June 1665) was the ruler of Further Austria including Tyrol from 1662 to 1665.

== Biography ==
He was born at Innsbruck, the second son of Leopold V, Archduke of Austria and Claudia de&#x27; Medici. He was appointed as Prince-bishop of Augsburg in 1646. In 1653, he became bishop of Gurk and in 1659 Prince-bishop of Trent. He was never ordained as a priest or consecrated as a bishop.

In 1662 he was put forth by his cousin Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor as a candidate for bishop of Strasbourg. This included large cash incentives to the cathedral chapter and a promise that Sigismund would be a very hands off ruler. After the 1662 death of his brother Archduke Ferdinand Charles of Austria, he became Archduke of Further Austria, and therefore withdrew from the candidacy for the bishopric. He was more able than his brother and could have made him a good ruler, but with his early death in 1665, the younger Tyrolean line of the House of Habsburg ended. Leopold I, who as the heir male succeeded Sigismund Francis, took direct control over the government of Further Austria and Tyrol.

He married Hedwig of the Palatinate-Sulzbach on 3 June 1665, and died in Innsbruck twenty-two days later of an illness.

<text>Bruce S. Thornton (born August 2, 1953) is an American classicist at California State University, Fresno, and research fellow at Stanford University&#x27;s Hoover Institution.

== Biography ==
Thornton received a Bachelor of Arts in Latin from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1975, and a PhD in Comparative Literature in 1983. He had studied Greek, Latin, and English literature for his doctorate.

Currently Thornton is research fellow and W. Glenn Campbell and Rita Ricardo-Campbell National Fellow (2009–2010 and 2010–2011) at Stanford University&#x27;s Hoover Institution. He is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center.

Thornton has lectured at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. He also appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; with Bill Maher, and is a contributor to the conservative website CaliforniaRepublic.org.

Thornton lives in Fresno with his wife and two sons.

== Work ==
===History===
Thornton has described his opinions as opposed to the dominant, mainstream historical tradition about the Enlightenment. He is an admirer of historian Christopher Dawson. He also subscribes to the &#x27;Athens versus Jerusalem&#x27; thesis of Leo Strauss, in which the interplay between classical Greek ideologies of rationality and the Judaeo-Christian spiritual philosophies resulted in the creation of Western civilization.

===Europe===
Thornton believes that the declining belief in interpersonal ideals such as national pride and in religious ideals such as Christianity has led non-American Westerners to either substitute &quot;political religions&quot; such as communism and fascism into their lives or abandon having moral ideals altogether. This, in his opinion, weakens them against pressure from threats such as increasing immigration to Europe by Muslims that have higher birth rates than native Europeans. He has said, &quot;If all of their goods are material, right, what material good is worth dying for and what material good is worth killing for?&quot; His book &quot;Decline and Fall: Europe&#x27;s Slow Motion Suicide&quot; has been described as part of the &quot;Eurabia genre&quot;.

== Publications ==
Thornton has published several well-received books.
* &quot;Eros: The Myth of Ancient Greek Sexuality&quot; (Westview Press, 1997)
* &quot;Plagues of the Mind: The New Epidemic of False Knowledge&quot; (ISI Books, 1999)

<text>Janus Records was a record label owned by GRT Records, also known as General Recorded Tape. The label was in operation from 1969 to 1979.

== History ==
Janus was founded in July 1969, as a joint venture of GRT and British label Pye Records. In its early years of operation the bulk of Janus&#x27; acts were U.S. issues of Pye product. Its first major hit was &quot;Baby Take Me in Your Arms&quot; by Jefferson, in late 1969. Other acts in Janus&#x27; early years included Pye artists Status Quo, Pickettywitch and Sounds Orchestral. Up to the middle 1970s, the label&#x27;s president was Marv Schlachter, who later ran the ill-fated U.S. Pye label, which by 1977 had evolved into Prelude Records. GRT assumed sole ownership of Janus in 1971, after Pye pulled out of the venture. Ed Dejoy of Baltimore, MD followed Schlachter as president. Allan Mason was vice president in charge of A&amp;R.

Artists who had hits on Janus included Potliquor, Mungo Jerry, The Whispers, Cymande, Charlie, Al Stewart, Ian Thomas, Dickie Goodman and Ray Stevens on Barnaby Records. Janus also released Scott English&#x27;s original recording of &quot;Brandy&quot;, which would be covered in 1974 by Barry Manilow as &quot;Mandy&quot;. Chess Records was administered as a division of Janus in the early 1970s. Janus also distributed Westbound Records from 1970 until 1975, and Barnaby Records from 1974 to 1979.

In the early 1970s Janus also released American editions of recordings made by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets for the European Sonet Records label (including the 1971 single &quot;A Little Piece at a Time&quot; (Janus 162), which would be Haley&#x27;s final North American 45 rpm single release). They also released recordings by the British progressive rock band Camel as well as titles by Kayak, Harvey Mandel, Judas Priest, Lucifer&#x27;s Friend, and the Baker Gurvitz Army.

<text>The orange ribbon is a symbol adopted for a very wide variety of uses in different places.

==Worldwide==

The orange ribbon is used for the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. This is held in March and coincides with Australia&#x27;s Harmony Day. The ribbon shows awareness of racial tolerance, or cultural diversity.
Orange ribbons are used during August to raise awareness and support for International Autoinflammatory Awareness Month.

<text>Willgodt Theophil Odhner (; 10 August 1845 – ) was a Swedish engineer and entrepreneur, working in St. Petersburg, Russia. He was the inventor of the Odhner Arithmometer, which by the 1940s was one of the most popular type of portable mechanical calculator in the world.

According to a brochure distributed by Odhner&#x27;s company at the Paris World exposition of 1900 &quot;...Odhner had, in 1871, an opportunity to repair a Thomas calculating machine and then became convinced that it is possible to solve the problem of mechanical calculation by a simpler and more appropriate way&quot;. It took him 19 years to perfect the design of this new machine so it could be manufactured effectively.

==Early years==
Odhner studied at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm from 1864 to 1867 but left before graduating. At age 23, in 1868, he moved to Saint Petersburg, Russia, even though he didn&#x27;t speak any Russian. As soon as he arrived, he went to the Swedish consulate, which found him a job in a local mechanical workshop. A few months later he joined the Nobel&#x27;s mechanical factory owned by a Swede named Ludvig Nobel (1831–1888), brother of Alfred Nobel of Nobel Prize fame, where he worked until 1877. In 1878 he joined the Expedition, a large paper mill and printing house, and worked there until 1892.

==Manufacturing of the Arithmometer==
While working at the Expedition, Odhner started his own workshop in 1885, building high quality production machines for local manufacturing businesses. One of his biggest project was the manufacturing of printing presses, he also made cigarette-making machines and all kind of scientific instruments. Odhner officially started the production of his arithmometer in this workshop in 1890. Early on, Mr. F. N. Hill, a British citizen, became his associate but he left the company around 1897, making Odhner the sole proprietor until his death in 1905. 

After Odhner&#x27;s death, his sons Alexander and Georg and son-in-law Karl Siewert continued the production and about 23,000 calculators were made before the factory was forced to close down in 1918.

Independent clone makers from all over the world, including Russia, carried the design from 1893 well into the 1970s.
==Family==
In 1871 he married Alma Skånberg, the daughter of Fredrik Skånberg, a Nobel coworker. They had seven children. Unfortunately Emilia, their second child, died at age 2 in 1877, the same year Alma, their third child was born. 

W. T. Odhner died of a heart attack on 15 September 1905 (Gregorian calendar) in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

<doc id="1213479" wikidata="Q931585" url="?curid=1213479" title="Ron Hainsey">
<text>Ronald Martin Hainsey (born March 24, 1981) is an American former professional ice hockey defenseman. He played seventeen years in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Montreal Canadiens, Columbus Blue Jackets, Atlanta Thrashers, Winnipeg Jets, Carolina Hurricanes, Pittsburgh Penguins, Toronto Maple Leafs and the Ottawa Senators, playing over 1,100 career NHL games.

Hainsey played in the NHL for nearly 16 years (907 games) before a late season trade to the 2016–17 Pittsburgh Penguins saw him play on a team that made the playoffs, longer than any other player in league history, beating the previous record of 799 games held by Olli Jokinen. He won that season&#x27;s Stanley Cup with the Penguins in his debut playoff appearance, finishing second in ice time for the playoffs in place of the injured Kris Letang. His non-playoffs record was passed by Jeff Skinner in 2023.

== Early life ==
Hainsey was born on March 24, 1981, in Bolton, Connecticut, to Marty and Kerry Hainsey. He learned how to skate at the Bolton Ice Palace.

==Playing career==
=== Early career ===
As a youth, Hainsey played in the 1995 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Springfield, Massachusetts.

Hainsey was drafted in the first round, 13th overall, by the Montreal Canadiens in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, from the University of Massachusetts Lowell (1999-2001) of the Hockey East NCAA conference. He began his professional career with Montreal&#x27;s American Hockey League (AHL) affiliates, the Quebec Citadelles and Hamilton Bulldogs, and played in the Calder Cup finals against the Houston Aeros, which the Bulldogs lost. Hainsey made his NHL debut for the Canadiens on October 11, 2002, versus the New York Rangers in New York.

=== Columbus Blue Jackets ===
After spending three seasons with the Canadiens organization, Hainsey was claimed off waivers on November 29, 2005, by the Columbus Blue Jackets, where he established himself as a solid two-way defenseman.

=== Atlanta Thrashers / Winnipeg Jets ===
On July 2, 2008, as a free agent, Hainsey signed a five-year, $22.5 million contract with the Atlanta Thrashers. He recorded 6 goals and 33 assists in his first season in Atlanta. He would go on to record 45 points in the next two seasons with the Thrashers. After their relocation to Winnipeg, Manitoba, to become the Winnipeg Jets to start the 2011–12 season, Hainsey recorded 10 assists in 56 games.

Hainsey also played a role in the negotiations of the 2012–13 NHL lockout. After a day of marathon bargaining sessions on December 5, 2012, Hainsey emerged to tell the media that both sides planned to meet again the next day. He was a key part of the negotiating team for the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA) in the lockout. On January 6, 2013, an agreement was reached to end the lockout. He finished the 2012–13 season with no goals and 13 points in 47 games with the Jets.

=== Carolina Hurricanes ===
On September 12, 2013, Hainsey signed a one-year, $2 million contract with the Carolina Hurricanes after the team announced that a defenseman Joni Pitkänen would miss the season due to injury. On June 24, 2014, Hainsey signed a new three-year, $8.5 million contract with the Hurricanes. Hainsey was named an alternate captain of the Hurricanes during the 2015–16 season. He marked his 200th NHL assist against the Pittsburgh Penguins on January 20, 2017.

=== Pittsburgh Penguins ===
On February 23, 2017, Hainsey, in the final year of his contract, was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for a second-round pick in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft and Danny Kristo. It was the first time that he had been traded in his career. It was with the Penguins that on April 12, 2017, after 907 career NHL games and surpassing Olli Jokinen&#x27;s previous playoff games drought &quot;record&quot;, Hainsey made his Stanley Cup playoff debut, doing so against the Columbus Blue Jackets. Hainsey and the Penguins went on to win the Stanley Cup over the Nashville Predators in the Finals. He was the first player captain Sidney Crosby handed the trophy to, following the victory.

=== Toronto Maple Leafs ===
An unrestricted free agent following the season, Hainsey signed a two-year, $6 million contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs on July 1, 2017. He was signed to replace the departing Matt Hunwick, who coincidentally signed with the Penguins that same day. Hainsey was often played alongside Morgan Rielly on the Leafs top defence pairing. On November 1, 2018, Hainsey played in his 1,000 career NHL game.

=== Ottawa Senators ===
On July 1, 2019, Hainsey signed a one-year, $3.5 million contract with the Ottawa Senators. For the 2019–20 season, Hainsey was named an alternate captain for the Senators. On December 10, 2019, Hainsey played in his 1,100th game, playing against the team which drafted him, the Montreal Canadiens in Montreal. On December 19, 2019, it was announced that Hainsey suffered a knee injury in the 5–4 overtime victory over the Nashville Predators. He missed seven games before returning to the ice on January 9, 2020. On April 1, 2021, Hainsey announced his retirement from the NHL.

<text>Brian Michael Stableford (25 July 1948 – 24 February 2024) was a British academic, critic and science fiction writer who published a hundred novels and over a hundred volumes of translations. His earlier books were published under the name Brian M. Stableford, but later ones dropped the middle initial and appeared under the name Brian Stableford. He also used the pseudonym Brian Craig for some of his very early and late works. The pseudonym derives from the first names of himself and of a school friend from the 1960s, Craig A. Mackintosh, with whom he jointly published some very early work.

==Biography==
Born in Shipley, Yorkshire, Stableford graduated with a degree in biology from the University of York in 1969 before going on to do postgraduate research in biology and later in sociology. In 1979 he received a PhD with a doctoral thesis on &quot;The Sociology of Science Fiction&quot;. 

Until 1988, he worked as a lecturer in sociology at the University of Reading. He was later a full-time writer and a part-time lecturer at several universities for classes concerning subjects such as creative writing. He was married twice, and had a son and a daughter by his first wife.

He wrote and contributed to numerous reference works, including the last print edition of the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, wrote books and essays on the history of science fiction, and published more than 200 translations of novels of early French science fiction and fantasy.

Brian Stableford died in Swansea, Wales, on 24 February 2024, at the age of 75.

==Awards and honours==

=====Emortality=====

The first six volumes are considered the main sequence and were published out of series order; preferred reading order shown below is established from the author&#x27;s introduction to volume 6, &quot;The Omega Expedition&quot;. This series is also related to, though not always entirely consistent with, the 8 collections and 5 novels subtitled &quot;Tales of the Biotech Revolution&quot;, see below.

The term &quot;emortality&quot;, intended to indicate near-immortality as opposed to absolute immortality, is acknowledged by Stableford (in the acknowledgments to volume 3, &quot;Dark Ararat&quot;) to have been coined by Alvin Silverstein in his 1979 book, &quot;Conquest of Death&quot;.

In the introduction to his 2007 collection, &quot;The Tree of Life and Other Tales of the Biotech Revolution&quot;, Stableford describes this series as &quot;tracking the potential effects of possible developments in biotechnology on the evolution of global society. [It can be considered] a modified version of the future history mapped out in &quot;The Third Millennium: A History of the World AD 2000–3000&quot; (Sidgwick &amp; Jackson 1985, written in collaboration with David Langford).

&quot;The broad sweep of this future history envisages a large-scale economic and ecological collapse in the 21st-century brought about by global warming and other factors, followed by the emergence of a global society designed to accommodate human longevity (although that is not necessarily obvious in stories set in advance of the Crash).&quot;

#*&quot;&quot;Le Fleurs du Mal&quot;: A Tale of the Biotech Revolution&quot; (na), &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; October 1994; text corrected here, per the author&#x27;s introduction: &quot;...I eventually decided to finish the novel version of &quot;Les Fleurs du Mal&quot; anyway, and completed it in 1992. I wrote the story to what seemed its natural length (68,000 words) but could not sell it...I decided to cut the text drastically and attempt to sell an abridged version of the story to one or other of the sf magazines as a novella. The present text is the 29,000-word result of that cut, although Gardner Dozois—who bought it for publication in the October 1994 issue of &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot;—insisted on cutting out the gratuitous car chase, thus reducing the published version to 27,000 words.&quot;; later expanded into the novel &quot;Architects of Emortality&quot;, see above

<text>Édouard Boubat (; 13 September 1923 – 30 June 1999) was a French photojournalist and art photographer.

==Life and work==
Boubat was born in Montmartre, Paris. He studied typography and graphic arts at the École Estienne and worked for a printing company before becoming a photographer. In 1943, he was subjected to service du travail obligatoire, forced labour of French people in Nazi Germany, and witnessed some of the horrors of World War II. He took his first photograph after the war in 1946 and was awarded the Kodak Prize the following year. He travelled internationally for the French magazine &quot;Réalités&quot;, where his colleague was Jean-Philippe Charbonnier, and later worked as a freelance photographer. French poet Jacques Prévert called him a &quot;peace correspondent&quot; as he was humanist, apolitical and photographed uplifting subjects. His son Bernard Boubat is also a photographer.

==Notable awards==
*1947 – Kodak Prize
*1971 – David Octavius Hill Medal

<doc id="1213498" wikidata="Q5034674" url="?curid=1213498" title="Cape Cod Baseball League">
<text>The Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL or Cape League) is a collegiate summer baseball wooden bat league located on Cape Cod in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. One of the nation&#x27;s premier collegiate summer leagues, the league boasts over one thousand former players who have gone on to play in the major leagues.

==History==


===Pre-modern era===
====Origins====
As early as the 1860s, baseball teams representing various Cape Cod towns and villages were competing against one another. The earliest newspaper account is of an 1867 game in Sandwich between the hometown &quot;Nichols Club&quot; and the visiting Cummaquid team. Though not formalized as a league, the games provided entertainment for residents and summer visitors.

In 1885, a Fourth of July baseball game was held matching teams from Barnstable and Sandwich. According to contemporary accounts, the 1885 contest may have been at least the twelfth such annual game. By the late 19th century, an annual championship baseball tournament was being held each fall at the Barnstable County Fair, an event that continued well into the 20th century, with teams representing towns from Cape Cod and the larger region.

In 1921, the Barnstable County Agricultural Society determined to limit the fair&#x27;s annual baseball championship to teams from Cape Cod. Falmouth won the championship in 1921, and Osterville in 1922. Interest in baseball was growing, as was a movement to create a formal league of Cape Cod teams.

====The early Cape League era (1923–1939)====
The &quot;Cape Cod Baseball League&quot; was formed in 1923, consisting of four teams: Falmouth, Osterville, Hyannis, and Chatham. Teams were made up of players from local colleges and prep schools, along with some semi-pro players and other locals. One notable player during this period was North Truro native Danny &quot;Deacon&quot; MacFayden, who went on to play for seventeen years in the major leagues.

Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the composition of the league varied from season to season. Towns did not opt to field teams in every season, and teams from other towns such as Bourne, Harwich, Orleans, Provincetown, and Wareham joined the league. Teams were not limited to league play, and often played teams from towns and cities in the larger region, as in 1929 when Falmouth played an exhibition game against the major league Boston Braves.

The league enjoyed widespread popularity throughout the 1930s, and even engendered competition in the form of the Barnstable County Twilight League and the Lower Cape Twilight League. However, as the cumulative effects of the Great Depression made it increasingly more difficult to secure funding for teams, the Cape League disbanded in 1940.

====The Upper and Lower Cape League era (1946–1962)====
With young men returning home after World War II, the Cape League was revived in 1946. The league now excluded paid professional or semi-pro players, and for a while attempted to limit players to those who were Cape Cod residents. The league was split into Upper Cape and Lower Cape divisions, and in addition to many of the town teams from the &quot;old&quot; Cape League, new teams now joined such as those representing the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, Otis Air Force Base, and the Cape Verdean Club of Harwich among others.

===Modern era (1963–present)===
In 1963, the Cape Cod Baseball League was reorganized and became officially sanctioned by the NCAA. The league would no longer be limited to Cape Cod residents, but would recruit college players and coaches from an increasingly wide radius.

In 1985, the league moved away from the use of aluminum bats, and became the only collegiate summer league in the nation at that time to use wooden bats. This transition began a period of significant growth in the league&#x27;s popularity and prestige among MLB scouts, as well as among college players and coaches. This popularity has translated into over one thousand former players who have gone on to major league playing careers, including multiple members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Structure and season==

The CCBL regular season runs from mid-June through mid-August. Teams are geographically divided into the East Division and West Division. Each division consists of five teams which each play 44 regular season games, 6 games against each team from within their division, and 4 games against each team from the other division.

During the latter half of the regular season, an all-star game is contested between the all stars from the East and West divisions, and features a pre-game home run hitting contest. The CCBL All-Star Game was played at Fenway Park from 2009 to 2011, but is normally played at one of the CCBL home fields.

Following the regular season, the top four teams in each division qualify for the playoffs, which is an elimination tournament consisting of three rounds of best of three series to determine the league champion and winner of the Arnold Mycock trophy.

==Teams==

===Current teams===


===Origin of team nicknames===
Prior to 2009, six of the ten teams in the CCBL shared their team nickname with a team in Major League Baseball (MLB). However, in late 2008 MLB announced that it would enforce its trademarks, and required those CCBL teams to either change their nicknames or buy their uniforms and merchandise only through MLB-licensed vendors.

Three of the teams eventually changed their nicknames. In 2009, the Chatham Athletics became the Anglers, and the Orleans Cardinals became the Firebirds. The following season, the Hyannis Mets became the Harbor Hawks.

The Bourne Braves and Yarmouth–Dennis Red Sox, teams who share nicknames with Boston&#x27;s two historic professional baseball franchises, chose to keep their nicknames and use MLB licensees for their merchandise.

MLB could not enforce the &quot;Mariners&quot; trademark against the Harwich Mariners because the use of the nickname by Harwich predated the entry of the Seattle Mariners into MLB as an expansion team in 1977.

The four teams whose nicknames were not in conflict with MLB have locally themed names such as the nautical monikers of the Falmouth Commodores and Brewster Whitecaps. The Cotuit Kettleers nickname recalls a legendary local Native American land transaction whose terms of sale involved the exchange of a brass kettle. The Wareham Gatemen are the only team that does not play its home games over the bridge, as the town of Wareham sits on the edge of the mainland, at the &quot;gateway&quot; to Cape Cod. Wareham was considered Cape Cod prior to the construction of the Cape Cod Canal.

Early Cape League era (1923–1939)

Upper and Lower Cape League era (1946–1962)



Beginnings of the modern era (1963–1987)

From 1963 to 1969, the newly reorganized league maintained the Upper Cape/Lower Cape divisional structure, with the championship series played by the winners of each division. Beginning in 1970, the divisional structure gave way to a single combined league, with the top four teams in the league advancing to the playoffs. This combined league structure continued through 1987.

Present Day

In 1988, the Bourne Braves and the Brewster Whitecaps joined the CCBL as expansion teams and the resulting ten-team league was split into East and West divisions. Since 1988, there have been no changes to the league&#x27;s franchise composition or divisional alignments.

==League championships==






 



==All-Star Game==

The first CCBL All-Star Game took place in 1946, as a squad of Cape League stars battled a collection of Boston Red Sox tryout players. Throughout the Upper and Lower Cape League era (1946–1962), the two divisions routinely featured both intra-divisional all-star contests, as well as an annual inter-divisional CCBL All-Star Game. From 1957 to 1961, the CCBL All-Star Game was sponsored by P. Ballantine and Sons Brewing Company. Ballantine was a major advertising sponsor of the New York Yankees, and arranged for appearances at the CCBL festivities by Yankee alumni including Phil Rizzuto, Elston Howard, Whitey Ford, Moose Skowron, Bill Stafford, Eddie Lopat, and Mel Allen, as well as Brooklyn Dodgers great Roy Campanella.

As the league&#x27;s modern era began, the All-Star Game continued to be contested between the CCBL&#x27;s Upper Cape (western) and Lower Cape (eastern) divisions from 1963 to 1969. In 1963, an additional All-Star Game was played by a team from the CCBL against a team from the southeastern Massachusetts-based Cranberry League. The game was played at Keith Field in Sagamore, and the CCBL came out on top, 15–2.

From 1970 to 1987, a team of stars from the CCBL played an annual interleague All-Star Game against stars from the Atlantic Collegiate Baseball League (ACBL). The games were typically played at major league stadiums including Fenway Park, Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium in New York, and Philadelphia&#x27;s Veterans Stadium.

Since 1988, the All-Star Game has been contested between stars representing the CCBL&#x27;s East and West divisions, and has also featured a pre-game home run hitting contest. The event is normally held at one of the CCBL home fields, though it returned to Fenway Park for a three-year stretch from 2009 to 2011.

==Hall of Fame and Museum==

The CCBL Hall of Fame and Museum is a history museum and hall of fame honoring past players, coaches, and others who have made outstanding contributions to the CCBL. Since its inaugural class in 2000, the Hall of Fame has held annual inductions of new members, enshrining over 170 members to date.

Originally opened to the public in 2003 at the Heritage Museums and Gardens in Sandwich, the Hall of Fame and Museum moved in 2008 to the lower level of the John F. Kennedy Hyannis Museum in Hyannis, Massachusetts, where it remained until 2017. The league anticipates a 2024 reopening of the Hall of Fame at a permanent location in South Yarmouth.
