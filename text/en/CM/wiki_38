<text>[[Aegean dispute|6 [[nautical miles]] (nmi)]]: Current territorial waters recognized by Greece and Turkey, and airspace as recognized by Turkey

The Aegean dispute is a set of interrelated controversies between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty and related rights in the region of the Aegean Sea. This set of conflicts has strongly affected Greek-Turkish relations since the 1970s, and has twice led to crises coming close to the outbreak of military hostilities, in 1987 and in early 1996. The issues in the Aegean fall into several categories:
* The delimitation of territorial waters,
* The delimitation of national airspace,
* The delimitation of exclusive economic zones (EEZ) and the use of the continental shelf,
* The role of flight information regions (FIR) for the control of military flight activity,
* The issue of the demilitarized status assigned to some of the Greek islands in the region,
* Turkish claims of &quot;grey zones&quot; of undetermined sovereignty over a number of islets, most notably the islets of Imia.

One aspect of the dispute is the differing interpretations of the maritime law: Turkey has not signed up to the Convention on the Continental Shelf nor the superseding United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which as of July 2024 has been signed by 170 parties, including Greece; as such, Turkey does not recognize a legal continental shelf and EEZ around the Greek islands.

Between 1998 and the early 2010s, the two countries came closer to overcoming the tensions through a series of diplomatic measures, particularly with a view to easing Turkey&#x27;s accession to the European Union. However, differences over suitable diplomatic paths to a substantial solution remained unresolved, and as of 2024 tensions remain.

==Maritime and aerial zones of influence ==
Several of the Aegean issues deal with the delimitation of both countries&#x27; zones of influence in the air and on the sea around their respective territories. These issues owe their virulence to a geographical peculiarity of the Aegean sea and its territories. While the mainland coasts of Greece and Turkey bordering the Aegean Sea on both sides represent roughly equal shares of its total coastline, the overwhelming number of the many Aegean islands belong to Greece. In particular, there is a chain of Greek islands lined up along the Turkish west coast (Lesbos, Chios, Samos, and the Dodecanese islands), some of them in very close proximity to the mainland. Their existence blocks Turkey from extending any of its zones of influence beyond a few nautical miles off its coastline. As the breadth of maritime and aerial zones of influence, such as the territorial waters and national airspace, are measured from the nearest territory of the state in question, including its islands, any possible extension of such zones would necessarily benefit Greece much more than Turkey proportionally.

According to a popular perception of these issues in the two countries, Turkey is concerned that Greece might be trying to extend its zones of influence to such a degree that it would turn the Aegean effectively into a &quot;Greek lake&quot;. Conversely, Greece is concerned that Turkey might try to &quot;occupy half of the Aegean&quot;, i.e. establish Turkish zones of influence towards the middle of the Aegean, beyond the chain of outlying Greek islands, turning these into a kind of exclave surrounded by Turkish waters, and thus cutting them off from their motherland.

===Territorial waters===

Territorial waters give the littoral state full control over air navigation in the airspace above, and partial control over shipping, although foreign ships (both civil and military) are normally guaranteed innocent passage through them. The standard width of territorial waters that countries are customarily entitled to has steadily increased in the course of the 20th century: from initially at the beginning of the century, to , and currently . The current value has been enshrined in treaty law by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982 (Art.3). In the Aegean, the territorial waters claimed by both sides are still at 6 miles. The possibility of an extension to 12 miles has fuelled Turkish concerns over a possible disproportionate increase in Greek-controlled space. Turkey has not become a member of the convention and does not consider itself bound by it. Turkey considers the convention as &quot;res inter alios acta,&quot; i.e. a treaty that can only be binding to the signing parties but not to others. Greece, which is a party to the convention, has stated that it reserves the right to apply this rule and extend its waters to 12 miles at some point in the future in the Aegean Sea (it has already done so in the Ionian Sea to the west). Greece holds that the 12-mile rule is not only treaty law but also customary law, as per the wide consensus established among the international community. Against this, Turkey argues that the special geographical properties of the Aegean Sea make a strict application of the 12-mile rule in this case illicit in the interest of equity. Turkey has itself applied the customary 12-mile limit to its coasts outside the Aegean.

Tensions over the 12-mile question ran highest between the two countries in the early 1990s, when the Law of the Sea was going to come into force. On 8 June 1995, the Turkish parliament officially declared that unilateral action by Greece would constitute a &quot;casus belli&quot;, i.e. reason to go to war. This declaration has been condemned by Greece as a violation of the Charter of the United Nations, which forbids &quot;the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state&quot;.

===National airspace===
National airspace is normally defined as the airspace covering a state&#x27;s land territory and its adjacent territorial waters. National airspace gives the sovereign state a large degree of control over foreign air traffic. While civil aviation is normally allowed passage under international treaties, foreign military and other state aircraft (unlike military vessels in the territorial waters) do not have a right to free passage through another state&#x27;s national airspace. The delimitation of national airspace claimed by Greece is the only example in the world, as it does not coincide with the boundary of the territorial waters. Greece claims of airspace, as opposed to currently 6 miles of territorial waters. Since 1974, Turkey has refused to acknowledge the validity of the outer 4-mile belt of airspace that extends beyond the Greek territorial waters. Turkey cites the statutes of the International Civil Aviation Organization &quot;(ICAO)&quot; of 1948, as containing a binding definition that both zones must coincide. Against this, Greece argues that:
* its claim predates the ICAO statute, having been fixed in 1931, and that it was acknowledged by all its neighbours, including Turkey, before and after 1948, hence constituting an established right;
* its 10-mile claim can also be interpreted as just a partial, selective use of the much wider rights guaranteed by the Law of the Sea, namely the right to a 12-mile zone both in the air and on the water;
* Greek territorial waters are set at the 6-mile boundary only because of Turkey&#x27;s casus belli.

The conflict over military flight activities has led to a practice of continuous tactical military provocations, with Turkish aircraft flying in the outer 4-mile zone of contentious airspace and Greek aircraft intercepting them. These encounters often lead to so-called &quot;dog-fights&quot;, dangerous flight manoeuvres that have repeatedly ended in casualties on both sides. In one instance in 1996, it has been alleged that a Turkish plane was accidentally shot down by a Greek one.

===Continental shelf===
In the context of the Aegean dispute, the term continental shelf refers to a littoral state&#x27;s exclusive right to economic exploitation of resources on and under the sea-bed, for instance oil drilling, in an area adjacent to its territorial waters and extending into the High Seas. The width of the continental shelf is commonly defined for purposes of international law as not exceeding 200 nautical miles. Where the territories of two states lie closer opposite each other than double that distance, the division is made by the median line.
The concept of the continental shelf is closely connected to that of an exclusive economic zone, which refers to a littoral state&#x27;s control over fishery and similar rights. Both concepts were developed in international law from the middle of the 20th century and were codified in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982.

The dispute between Turkey and Greece is to what degree the Greek islands off the Turkish coast should be taken into account for determining the Greek and Turkish economic zones. Turkey argues that the notion of &quot;continental shelf&quot;, by its very definition, implies that distances should be measured from the continental mainland, claiming that the sea-bed of the Aegean geographically forms a natural prolongation of the Anatolian land mass. This would mean for Turkey to be entitled to economic zones up to the median line of the Aegean (leaving out, of course, the territorial waters around the Greek islands in its eastern half, which would remain as Greek exclaves.) Greece, on the other hand, claims that all islands must be taken into account on an equal basis. This would mean that Greece would gain the economic rights to almost the whole of the Aegean.

In this matter, Greece has the UN Law of the Sea on its side, but the same Convention restricts the application of this rule to islands of a notable size, as opposed to small uninhabitable islets and rocks. The precise delimitation of the economic zones is the only one of all the Aegean issues where Greece has officially acknowledged that Turkey has legitimate interests that might require some international process of arbitration or compromise between the two sides. Turkey cites the resolution of certain International Court of Justice cases like Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia), Maritime Delimitation in the Black Sea case, Canada–France Maritime Boundary Case where court had used equitable approach and limited the continental shelves of islands.

Tensions over the continental shelf were particularly high during the mid-1970s and again the late 1980s, when it was believed that the Aegean Sea might hold rich oil reserves. Turkey at that time conducted exploratory oceanographic research missions in parts of the disputed area. These were perceived as a dangerous provocation by Greece, which led to a buildup of mutual military threats in 1976 and again in 1987.

===Flight information regions===
Unlike the issues described so far, the question of flight information regions (FIR) does not affect the two states&#x27; sovereignty rights in the narrow sense. A FIR is a zone of responsibility assigned to a state within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). It relates to the responsibility for regulating civil aviation. A FIR may stretch beyond the national airspace of a country, i.e. over areas of high seas, or in some cases even over the airspace of another country. It does not give the responsible state the right to prohibit flights by foreign aircraft; however, foreign aircraft are obliged to submit flight plans to the authorities administrating the FIR. Two separate disputes have arisen over flight control in the Aegean: the issue of a unilaterally proposed revision of the FIR demarcation, and the question of what rights and obligations arise from the FIR with respect to military as opposed to civil flights.

====Demarcation====
By virtue of an agreement signed in 1952, the whole airspace over the Aegean, up to the boundary of the national airspace of Turkey, has been assigned to Athens FIR, administered by Greece. Shortly after the Cyprus crisis of 1974, Turkey unilaterally attempted to change this arrangement, issuing a notice to airmen (NOTAM) stating that it would take over the administration of the eastern half of the Aegean airspace, including the national airspace of the Greek islands in that area. Greece responded with a declaration rejecting this move, and declaring the disputed zone unsafe for aviation due to the conflicting claims to authority. This led to some disruption in civil aviation in the area. Turkey later changed its stance, and since 1980 has returned to recognizing Athens FIR in its original demarcation. In practice, the FIR demarcation is currently no longer a disputed issue.

====Turkish military overflights====

 the current controversy over the FIR relates to the question whether the Greek authorities have a right to oversee not only civil but also military flight activities in the international parts of the Aegean airspace. According to common international practice, military aircraft normally submit flight plans to FIR authorities when moving in international airspace, just like civil aircraft do. Turkey refuses to do so, citing the ICAO charter of 1948, which explicitly restricts the scope of its regulations to civil aircraft, arguing that therefore the practice of including military aircraft in the same system is optional. Greece, in contrast, argues that it is obligatory on the basis of later regulations of the ICAO, which it claims have given states the authority to issue more wide-reaching restrictions in the interest of civil aviation safety.

This disagreement has led to similar practical consequences as the issue of 6 versus 10 miles of national airspace, as Greece considers all Turkish military flights not registered with its FIR authorities as transgressions of international air traffic regulations, and routinely has its own air force jets intercepting the Turkish ones. In popular perception in Greece, the issue of Turkish flights in the international part of Athens FIR is often confused with that of the Turkish intrusions in the disputed outer 4-mile belt of Greek airspace. However, in careful official usage, Greek authorities and media distinguish between &quot;violations&quot; (παραβιάσεις) of the national airspace, and &quot;transgressions&quot; (παραβάσεις) of traffic regulations, i.e. of the FIR.

One of the routine interception maneuvers led to a fatal accident on 23 May 2006. Two Turkish F-16s and one reconnaissance F-4 were flying in the international airspace over the southern Aegean at without having submitted flight plans to the Greek FIR authorities. They were intercepted by two Greek F-16s off the coast of the Greek island Karpathos. During the ensuing mock dog fight, a Turkish F-16 and a Greek F-16 collided midair and subsequently crashed. The pilot of the Turkish plane survived the crash, but the Greek pilot died. The incident also highlighted another aspect of the FIR issue, a dispute over conflicting claims to responsibility for maritime search and rescue operations. The Turkish pilot reportedly refused to be rescued by the Greek forces that had been dispatched to the area. After the incident, both governments expressed an interest to revive an earlier plan of establishing a direct hotline between the air force commands of both countries in order to prevent escalation of similar situations in the future.

===Timeline of incidents===

==Recent developments: Turkey&#x27;s claims and reactions==

On 2 September 2019, Turkey&#x27;s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan appeared in a photograph with a map that depicted nearly half of the Aegean Sea and an area up to the eastern coast of Crete as belonging to Turkey. The map was displayed during an official ceremony at the National Defense University of Turkey in Istanbul and shows an area labelled as &quot;Turkey&#x27;s Blue Homeland&quot; stretching up to the median line of the Aegean, enclosing the Greek islands in that part of the sea without any indication of the Greek territorial waters around them. The Blue Homeland is an irredentist and expansionist concept and doctrine, compared to the German concept of Lebensraum; it was created by the Chief of Staff of the Turkish Navy Commander Cihat Yaycı, and developed with Admiral Cem Gurdeniz in 2006. The Greek side expressed its regret, with the Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias stating that Turkey&#x27;s tactics are &quot;communication campaigns that cannot change international legitimacy, merely establishing Turkey&#x27;s image as a perpetrator&quot;.

=== Lodging claims in UN ===
On 13 November 2019, Turkey submitted to the United Nations a series of claims to Exclusive Economic Zones in the Eastern Mediterranean that are in conflict with Greek claims to the same areas – including a sea zone extending west of the southeastern Aegean island of Rhodes and south of Crete. The Turkish claims were made in an official letter by Turkey&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the UN Feridun Sinirlioglu, which reflect Ankara&#x27;s notion of a &quot;Blue Homeland&quot; (Mavi Vatan). Greece condemned these claims as legally unfounded, incorrect and arbitrary, and an outright violation of Greece&#x27;s sovereignty.

=== Turkey&#x27;s view ===
Turkey holds the view, unlike most other states, that no islands can have a full Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and should only be entitled to a 12 nautical mile reduced EEZ or no EEZ at all rather than the usual 200 miles that Turkey and every other country are entitled to. In this context, Turkey, for the first time on 1 December 2019, claimed that the Greek island of Kastellorizo shouldn&#x27;t have any EEZ at all, because, from the equity-based Turkish viewpoint, it is a small island immediately across the Turkish mainland (which, according to Turkey, has the longest coastline), and isn&#x27;t supposed to generate a maritime jurisdiction area four thousand times larger than its own surface. Furthermore, according to Turkey&#x27;s Foreign Ministry, an EEZ has to be coextensive with the continental shelf, based on the relative lengths of adjacent coastlines and described any opposing views supporting the right of islands to their EEZ as &quot;maximalist and uncompromising Greek and Greek Cypriot claims&quot;. On 20 January 2020, the Turkish President Erdogan challenged even the rights of Crete, Greece&#x27;s largest island and 5th largest in the Mediterranean, stating that &quot;They talk about a continental shelf around Crete. There is no continental shelf around the islands, there is no such thing, there, it is only sovereign waters.&quot;

Turkey&#x27;s view, however, is a &#x27;unique&#x27; interpretation not shared by any other country and not in accordance to the United Nations&#x27; Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) treaty, which as of May 2022 has been signed by 168 parties (including Greece), but not Turkey. Turkey did not ratify the UNCLOS, and argues that it is not bound by its provisions that award islands maritime zones. The UNCLOS, and particularly Article 121 clearly states that the islands can have exclusive economic zones and continental shelf just like every other land territory. The Ambassadors of the United States and Russia to Athens, Geoffrey Pyatt and Andrey Maslov respectively, while commenting on Turkey&#x27;s view, stated that all the islands have the same rights to EEZ and continental shelf as the mainlands do. The then US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, Aaron Wess Mitchell, criticized the Turkish view on Cyprus&#x27;s EEZ, stating that it &quot;is a minority of one versus the rest of the world.&quot;

===Turkey–GNA maritime agreement===
On 28 November 2019, President Erdoğan signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in Istanbul with the Prime Minister of the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord of Libya (GNA), Fayez al-Sarraj, to demarcate maritime zones in the Eastern Mediterranean on an area between Turkey and Libya, appearing to &quot;write [the Greek island of] Crete off the map entirely&quot; in the words of &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;″s Keith Johnson.

This agreement was controversial and drew condemnation by Greece and the international community, including the rival Tobruk-based government led by the Libyan House of Representatives and Khalifa Haftar, the European Union, United States, Russia, Egypt, Cyprus, Malta, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Serbia, Israel, Syria, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the Arab League, as a violation of the International Law of the Sea and the article 8 of the Skhirat Agreement which prohibits the Libyan Prime Minister from solely clinching international deals without consent of all the cabinet members. The Libyan House of Representatives consequently started a bid to suspend the GNA from the Arab League, but did not succeed. The United States stated that it was &quot;provocative&quot; and a threat to the stability of the region. Acting foreign minister Israel Katz announced Israel&#x27;s opposition to the maritime border accord between Ankara and Tripoli, and confirmed that the deal was &quot;illegal&quot; according to the Israeli official position, while at the same time noting that Israel does not want a conflict with Turkey.

On 18 October 2020, the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag)&#x27;s research service reviewed the Turkey-GNA maritime deal and found it to be illegal under international law, and detrimental to third parties.

====Post-agreement developments====

In response to these developments, the GNA Ambassador to Greece Mohamed Younis Menfi was summoned to the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Athens, where he was given an ultimatum of seven days, to disclose until 5 December the agreement his country signed with Turkey on maritime boundaries, or will be considered &quot;persona non-grata&quot; and be expelled from Greece. The authorities of the European Union also urged for the disclosure of the deal&#x27;s details. Also, the Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis met with the Turkish President on the sidelines of the 2019 London summit to discuss about it. Greek Foreign Minister Dendias revealed in September 2019 that his GNA counterpart, foreign minister Mohamed Taher Siala had reassured the Greek side that Libya would never sign any illegal agreements with Turkey that would violate the Greek sovereign rights.
On 6 December, the GNA Ambassador to Athens was expelled from Greece, prompting strong reactions in both the GNA and Turkey. Furthermore, the President of the Tobruk-based Libyan Parliament, Agila Saleh Issa Gwaider, who condemned and opposed the GNA-Turkey deal, was invited to Athens by the President of the Greek Parliament Konstantinos Tasoulas for talks.

Ankara asked for the agreement on maritime boundaries from the Government of National Accord (GNA) in the Libyan Civil War, in exchange for Turkey&#x27;s long-time support against the rival Tobruk-based House of Representatives.

It is believed, according to multiple sources, that Turkey&#x27;s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is exploiting the weakness of the GNA headed by Fayez al-Sarraj to force it to sign &quot;illegal&quot; agreements which are a serious breach of international laws that disregards the lawful rights of other eastern Mediterranean countries; and that through these exploitations, Turkey is trying to assert its regional power and its control of the Mediterranean sea, at the expense of the rights of the other Mediterranean nations and undermining the peace-making efforts to resolve the Libyan Civil War and the curb of migrant influx to Europe.

On 4 December 2019, the Turkish Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Fatih Dönmez, announced Turkey&#x27;s intentions to start awarding licences to drills for natural gas in Greek waters which Ankara claimed through the Turkey-GNA deal, once it is approved by the two countries&#x27; parliaments. The same day, Turkish President Erdogan stated that he is &quot;ready&quot; to start negotiations with Athens for the delimitation of maritime borders between Turkey and Greece, under the condition that the negotiations are based on Turkey&#x27;s peculiar perception which is stripping the Greek islands of their sovereign rights, and is violating the UNCLOS treaty.
The intentions for drills in Greek waters, was confirmed by President Erdogan on a public broadcast of the Mavi Vatan map and the Turkey-GNA deal. On 5 December 2019, the Turkish Parliament ratified the contentious GNA-Turkey maritime borders deal, where it had a strong backing by four of Turkey&#x27;s five major political parties - with the exception of the pro-Kurdish People&#x27;s Democracy Party (HDP). The Libyan Parliament however blocked the ratification and rejected the deal unanimously, with the President of the Parliament, Aguila Saleh Issa, sending a letter to the United Nations declaring it as null and void. Even though the ratification by the Libyan Parliament failed, GNA deposited the maritime agreement to the United Nations on 27 December, with Turkey following on 2 March of the next year. On 14 July 2020, it is revealed that five countries sent a joint note verbale to the UN Secretariat calling for the agreement to not be registered and accepted, noting that, per UN procedures, its ratification by the Libyan Parliament is a prerequisite. On 1 October, the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, registered the Turkey-GNA deal on the delimitation of maritime jurisdiction areas in the Mediterranean. The agreement &quot;has been registered with the Secretariat, in accordance with Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations,&quot; said the certificate of registration. On 27 January 2021, a court of appeals in Al-Bayda ruled in favour of a lawsuit filed by the House of Representatives, declaring the Memorandum invalid.

According to multiple sources, there is a fear of destabilization in the East Mediterranean and NATO due to Turkey&#x27;s assertive moves and that an armed conflict between Turkey and Greece draws closer. On 9 December, the vessels of the Libyan Navy which are under the control of the Libyan National Army, announced that they received mandate to sink any Turkish research vessels or drillships that may attempt to conduct researches south of Crete, as part of the Turkey-GNA deal. France also signaled its intention to send French frigates and ships to the south of Crete, in coordination with Athens, while Italy sent its frigate &quot;Martinengo&quot; to monitor, patrol and safeguard the sea around Cyprus, which has been the subject of claims by Turkey.

On 30 May 2020, the Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO) applied to the Turkish Ministry of Energy for exploration permits on the Greek continental shelf, just 6 miles off Crete, Karpathos and Rhodes. TPAO&#x27;s applications were published to the Turkey&#x27;s Government Gazette, with a map showing the 24 blocks that Ankara has demarcated from Turkey&#x27;s shores to the point where its claimed sea borders meet these of Libya, based on the Turkey-GNA maritime agreement. This prompted strong reactions both in Greece and abroad, with the Turkish Ambassador to Athens, Burak Özügergin, being summoned to the Greek Foreign Ministry, and the European Union&#x27;s High Representative of Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell warning Ankara that the good EU-Turkey relations &quot;will depend critically on the respect of the sovereignty of Cyprus and Greece on the waters under dispute&quot;. Furthermore, the United States criticized Turkey, with the US Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources Francis R. Fannon stating, during a quadrilateral conference organized by both the American-Hellenic Chamber of Commerce and the Atlantic Council with the participation of USA, Greece, Israel and Cyprus, that such &quot;provocative actions&quot; must end and that the Turkey-GNA agreement &quot;cannot as a legal matter affect the rights or obligations of third states&quot; such as Greece.

===EastMed Pipeline===
On 2 January 2020, the leaders of Greece, Cyprus, and Israel signed an accord to build the EastMed pipeline. The planned pipeline will transport natural gas from the Levantine Basin to Greece and from there to Italy and the rest of Europe. Energy expert Brenda Schaffer interprets the EastMed pipeline (forecasted to be able to cater to 10% of Europe&#x27;s gas needs, and decrease reliance on Russia) as a joint attempt to exclude Turkey from the &quot;Club Med&quot; gas club, and the decision to sign the pipeline accord was taken in response to the Turkish-GNA deal.

On 19 May 2023, Claudio Descalzi, the CEO of Italian energy company Eni, said that any agreement for the construction of the EastMed pipeline must include Turkey; he added that &quot;there are disputes between Turkey and Cyprus that are difficult to remedy, furthermore Turkey has made an agreement with Libya to define a very vast platform that covers almost the entire EastMed, therefore not only Turkey but also Libya will have a say.&quot; In response to these comments, George Papanastasiou, the Cypriot Minister of Energy, Commerce and Industry, stated that not all people agree with the opinions expressed by Descalzi, and that he respects his opinion. These remarks follow reports that Eni, Cyprus and Israel are working on a deal for constructing a natural gas pipeline in the Eastern Mediterranean, connecting both the Cypriot and Israeli offshore gas fields to a processing plant in Cyprus, where the gas will be liquefied for export by ship to Italy and the rest of Europe.

=== Greece–Italy EEZ agreement ===
On 9 June 2020, and in response to Turkey&#x27;s moves in the region, Greece and Italy signed through their Foreign Ministers Nikos Dendias and Luigi Di Maio a &quot;historic&quot; agreement for the demarcation of the EEZ between the two countries. The agreement confirms the full rights of islands to their continental shelf and EEZ, in line with the UNCLOS. It uses the median line that was used for the 1977 Italy-Greece continental shelf demarcation agreement as the basis of the EEZ boundary. In the mutually agreed minor adjustments, part of the EEZ of the small Greek islands of Strofades, Othoni, and Mathraki was traded off for an equal area elsewhere (i.e. part of the EEZ of Italy&#x27;s Calabria). According to Dendias, this creates an extremely favorable legal precedent for Greece in its dispute with Turkey. The United States, the Libyan House of Representatives, and the LNA led by Halifa Haftar, welcomed the EEZ agreement between Greece and Italy, with the US calling it &quot;exemplary&quot; and &quot;an example of how these things should be done [in the region]&quot;, while reiterating their opposition to the Turkey-GNA EEZ agreement. Following the agreement, the Libyan House of Representatives sent an official invitation to the Hellenic Parliament for a similar EEZ agreement to be reached between Libya and Greece too, with talks beginning on 1 July. Dendias stated that Libyan-Greek talks are &quot;not within the arbitrariness that so-called Sarraj-Turkey memorandum is constituting&quot;, but within the framework of UNCLOS and in continuation of the 2010 talks between the two countries. In this context, a committee of experts is formed by the President of the Libyan Parliament, Aguila Saleh. The LNA published a map with the proposed EEZ boundaries between Libya and Greece, in which Libya fully acknowledges the Greek islands&#x27; rights to their continental shelf and EEZ. Furthermore, on 18 June, a high-level delegation from Greece visited Egypt to negotiate and sign an agreement demarcating the Egyptian-Greek EEZ as well.

In July 2020, France and Austria have called for sanctions against Turkey, such as the termination of the Turkey&#x27;s EU accession talks. In the same context the EU&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Council convened and agreed for a framework of sanctions to be prepared for use in the event Turkey attempts any violations of Greece&#x27;s sovereign rights. The Greek FM Dendias expressed his country&#x27;s readiness to activate the Mutual Defence Clause (Article 42) of the EU&#x27;s Lisbon Treaty for military assistance.

On 21 July, Turkey announced plans for a seismic survey south and east of the Greek island of Kastellorizo with the research vessel &quot;Oruç Reis&quot;, and for this purpose it issued a Navtex covering parts of the Greek, Egyptian and Cypriot waters, prompting strong reactions both in Greece and abroad. The Greek embassy in Ankara sent a complaint to the Turkish Foreign Ministry, Egypt considers the move as an encroachment of its waters, and Germany&#x27;s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas warned Turkey with consequences. Turkey dispatched its naval forces to the region around Kastellorizo, and Turkish armed jets conducted low overflights and dogfights with their Greek counterparts above the island, causing the tourists to evacuate it, and the Greek Armed Forces to be placed on high alert. The Turkish Ambassador to Berlin, Ali Kemal Aydın, was summoned to the German Foreign Ministry and the German Chancellor Angela Merkel held phone calls with the Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and the Turkish President Tayip Erdogan in a bid to de-escalate the situation. According to the German tabloid newspaper Bild, it was Merkel&#x27;s last-minute intervention that prevented a crisis between Greece and Turkey. This was later confirmed by the German Defence Minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. Along with Germany, France, Spain and the United States also backed Greece, with the French President Emmanuel Macron calling for sanctions against Turkey for the violation of Greece&#x27;s sovereignty, the US envoy to Athens acknowledging Kastellorizo&#x27;s &quot;exactly the same&quot; rights to EEZ and Continental Shelf as mainlands, and the State Department urging Turkey to halt its plans for surveys in the area around the island. A few days later, Turkey announced the suspension of its oil and gas exploration around Kastellorizo.

=== Greece–Egypt EEZ agreement ===
Several days later, on 6 August, the foreign ministers of Egypt and Greece, Sameh Shoukry and Nikos Dendias respectively, signed a maritime agreement partially demarcating the EEZs between the two countries, in line with the UNCLOS which recognizes the right of the islands to their continental shelf and EEZ. According to the Greek side, the Egyptian-Greek agreement cancels in practice the Turkish-GNA memorandum. Turkey opposed the agreement and considers it &quot;null and void&quot;, claiming that &quot;there is no mutual sea border between Egypt and Greece&quot;. Similarly, the Tripoli-based GNA government led by Al-Sarraj condemned it as a &quot;violation of Libya&#x27;s maritime rights&quot;. On the other hand, the Tobruk-based LNA government led by Haftar, Saudi Arabia and the United States, supported and welcomed it, with the LNA stating that Greece &quot;should solidify a EEZ with the only democratically elected legislative body in Libya, the House of Representatives&quot; and the US State Department stating that it encourages the peaceful settlement of disputes. Also, Manfred Weber, head of the European People&#x27;s Party, the largest party in the European Parliament, welcomed the Egypt-Greece agreement as a positive development that &quot;strengthens stability in the East Mediterranean,&quot; and urged for the European Union to &quot;stand firmly with Greece&quot; against what he called as Turkish attempts that &quot;undermine international law in the region&quot;. In response to this, Turkey announced the next day that it resumed its seismic surveys south of Kastellorizo. Τhe US, the EU, France, Germany, Austria, Italy, North Macedonia, Egypt, Cyprus, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Spain, Portugal, Malta, Sweden and Armenia expressed their opposition to Turkey&#x27;s renewed explorations in the East Mediterranean, while Azerbaijan counteracted to Armenia&#x27;s position by lending its support for Turkey&#x27;s moves. On 14 August 2020, Greece&#x27;s and Turkey&#x27;s ships collided and suffered minor damages and France intervened by sending its naval forces to the East Mediterranean, to Greece&#x27;s aid, followed by the United Arab Emirates whose Fighter Jets are stationed at the Souda Bay Naval Base, in Crete. Also, the United States beefed up their military presence in the East Med by assigning the USS Hershel &quot;Woody&quot; Williams to the Souda Bay as its new permanent home, and talks on moving US assets from the Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, to Souda Bay opened. Josep Borrell announced that the European Union is preparing a list of sanctions against Turkey, including tough economic measures, and the former Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu criticized openly his own country&#x27;s &quot;power projection&quot; in the East Mediterranean, which, according to him, risks causing a military conflict. On 18 August, the Egyptian Parliament ratified the Greece - Egypt EEZ Agreement and, 9 days later, the Greek Parliament followed suit, before it would be registered at the United Nations on 24 December 2020. Greece announced that reaching EEZ agreements with Albania and Cyprus are among its next priorities. On 17 September, the European Parliament condemned Turkey for its violations of the Greek and Cypriot EEZs and called on the European Council to prepare further sanctions.

Due to Turkey&#x27;s diplomatic isolation, and just a week ahead of the EU Summit where sanctions against the EU-candidate country for its drilling activities were to be evaluated, Oruç Reis withdrew from Kastellorizo and the Turkish surveys on Greek continental shelf were halted. Turkey agreed to resort to diplomatic means for resolving its maritime disputes with Greece. Turkey&#x27;s economy is dependent on foreign markets and especially the European Union, for exports, imports, short-term finance and technology, and thus, the EU&#x27;s tough economic sanctions could have a &quot;fatal&quot; impact on the Turkish economy and the Turkish President Erdogan&#x27;s political survival. The prospect of EU sanctions also have contributed to the Turkish Lira&#x27;s depreciation to record-low levels, worsening its economy. The United States, which criticized Turkey&#x27;s assertive policies in the region, welcomed Ankara&#x27;s decision to adopt a more diplomatic stance over its maritime dispute with Greece, with the head of the American foreign policy, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo stating that &quot;the way conflict is resolved is not through shows of force, it&#x27;s not through demonstrations of power, it&#x27;s through dialogue. It&#x27;s through international systems, agreement, conversations, dialogue. That&#x27;s how these maritime disputes ought to be resolved. We&#x27;ve watched the Greeks move in that direction trying to achieve that. We hope the Turkish Government will see it the same way&quot;. Additionally, Pompeo sided with Greece, by asking for a solution that is &quot;reflective of the fundamental rights of the citizens of Greece&quot;.

===2020–2021 developments===
On 8 October 2020, Turkey and Greece agreed, under Germany&#x27;s mediation and with the United States&#x27; full consultation, to resume exploratory talks for resolving their maritime disputes. However, a few days later, on 11 October, Turkey withdrew from the talks and resumed its gunboat diplomacy by releasing a NAVTEX announcing that it will be conducting surveys on the waters just 6.5 nautical miles off Kastellorizo and redeployed its research vessel Oruç Reis, escorted by Turkish frigates, for this purpose. These Turkish moves drew the International community&#x27;s condemnation, with Berlin decrying them as a &quot;serious blow&quot; to efforts at easing tensions in the East Mediterranean and accusing Ankara for &quot;interplay between detente and provocation&quot;, the German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas cancelling his planned official visit to Ankara, and along with France, warning Turkey with consequences, Greece&#x27;s Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias declaring that &quot;the Turkish leadership has shown it is not a credible interlocutor. Its calls for dialogue are only a pretext. The international community must judge [Ankara] on the basis of actions, not words. We must all face reality before it is too late&quot;, the United States &quot;deploring&quot; Ankara for its moves, which the State Department described as &quot;calculated provocations&quot;, Austria&#x27;s Chancellor Sebastian Kurz condemning Oruc Reis&#x27; redeployment and warning Turkey of sanctions, Egypt&#x27;s Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry rejecting Turkey&#x27;s gunboat diplomacy and policy of territorial expansion in the region, Sweden&#x27;s Foreign Minister Ann Linde warning that the Oruç Reis&#x27; redeployment is leading to new tensions instead of contributing to de-escalation, Israel expressing its concerns over Turkey&#x27;s destabilizing role in the East Med, and Russia backing Greece&#x27;s right to expand its territorial waters to 12 nautical miles and reaffirming that the UNCLOS is a &quot;cornerstone&quot; of the international law and applies to the Mediterranean Sea. Manfred Weber of the EPP reiterated his call for EU sanctions against Turkey, stating that these initial de-escalation moves by Erdogan were purposeful only, with the aim of avoiding sanctions against his country at the recent European Council. Turkey however rebuffed international criticism of its research vessel&#x27;s redeployment, insisting that the Oruç Reis is operating in what it claims as &quot;Turkish waters&quot;.

On 17 October, Turkey passed a law expanding its search and rescue (SAR) area to cover all the new territories it claims in the Aegean and Mediterranean seas as part of its Blue Homeland theory. Greece condemned this extension of Turkish SAR as illegal under international law which does not permit any deliberate expansions of SAR areas without prior agreements with the relevant neighboring states, and protested strongly due to this expansion overlapping with Greece&#x27;s Athens SAR and the sovereign rights of Greek islands and their surrounding waters. The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs filed a complaint against it at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Turkey described the Greek protests as &quot;groundless&quot;, insisting that the expansion was done &quot;to ensure the safety of the activities&quot; within the Greek continental shelf which Ankara claims as &quot;Turkish&quot;. ICAO&#x27;s Secretary General Fang Liu, however, responded by rejecting Turkey&#x27;s unilateral expansion of SAR and reaffirming the Greek position on the matter. According to Liu, no changes may be done to the SAR boundaries between the two countries without Greece&#x27;s prior consent.

On 20 October, Greece and Albania agreed to resume negotiations for the demarcation of their maritime boundaries and that, in the event of no resolution, the two parties may jointly submit the case to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. The two countries had already reached an agreement on the demarcation of their maritime boundaries in 2009. Although ratified by the Greek side, the Albanian one took it to the Albanian Supreme Court where it was deemed unconstitutional. According to Cihat Yaycı, a Turkish general and author of the Turkey&#x27;s &quot;Blue Homeland&quot; theory, it was due to Ankara&#x27;s pressure on Tirana that the agreement&#x27;s ratification failed. For Turkey, an agreement between Albania and Greece based on the UNCLOS, would have had set a negative legal precedent against Turkey&#x27;s positions in its maritime disputes with Greece. According to US diplomatic cables leaked in 2011, however, the Greek government had blackmailed Albania to accept an unfavourable deal using the veto power that Athens has over EU enlargement.

On 18 November, Greece and the United Arab Emirates formed a military alliance by signing a mutual defense pact, which calls for each to help the other in case of an attack. The pact which is regarded as historic, marking the first of its kind in Greece&#x27;s modern history, aims at countering Turkey&#x27;s policies in the region.

Turkey was criticized at a NATO meeting on 3 December by the then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for what he regarded as undermining NATO&#x27;s security and cohesion and destabilizing the eastern Mediterranean by stoking tensions with fellow ally Greece, whilst according to Reuters, Turkish sources with knowledge of the meeting saw Pompeo&#x27;s approach as &quot;unjust&quot; as Turkey was &quot;open to talks with Greece&quot;. On 5 December, Turkey&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs tweeted that &quot;No sanctions will ever make Turkey compromise its sovereign rights, be it in Meis/Kastellorizo or 10 nm airspace.&quot; On 9 December, the US House of Representatives adopted the National Defence Authorization Act (NDAA), a defense legislation which includes sanctionary measures against Turkey because of several international disagreements between Washington and Ankara, including the purchase of the Russian defence system S-400 and the Turkish activities in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Three days after its approval by the US Congress, the Donald Trump administration imposed the sanctions as part of the CAATSA. According to Senator Robert Menendez, a member of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and rapporteur of the NDAA amendment for US sanctions, Turkey&#x27;s behavior in the East Med was one of the reasons contributing to the decision. The European Union&#x27;s 27 leaders, also decided in the 10 December summit to impose sanctions on Turkey for its activities against Greece and Cyprus in the East Med. The EU sanctions include travel bans into the EU territories and asset freezes on Turkish companies and individuals.

On 18 September 2021, new diplomatic tensions sparked after an incident between Greece and Turkey where the latter&#x27;s frigates prevented France&#x27;s research vessel Nautical Geo from conducting surveys on Greece&#x27;s behalf at the Greek EEZ, just 6 miles off the Greek island of Crete, whose waters Turkey claims as Turkish, citing its contentious maritime deal with the former Government of National Accord of Libya. The tensions come just a day after a high-level EUMed 9 Summit at Athens, where the heads of governments from 9 Mediterranean countries, including Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain, as well as the head of EU&#x27;s Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, released a joint statement regarding the security and stability in the Mediterranean Sea, urging Turkey to &quot;abstain, in a consistent and permanent manner, from provocations or unilateral actions in breach of international law&quot;. Turkey&#x27;s Foreign Ministry rejected the summit&#x27;s declaration, calling it &quot;biased&quot;.

On 19 September, the main opposition party in Turkey, the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP), opposed the Mavi Vatan (Blue Homeland) doctrine as aggressive and expansionist.

=== 2021: France–Greece and US–Greece defense pacts ===
On 28 September 2021, Greece and France signed the Franco-Greek defense agreement whereby either country is obliged to defend the other in the case of attack by a third party. France will supply Greece with navy frigates worth around €3 billion and is committed to help defend Greece if Turkey attacks. The pact is considered to be a landmark and the first of its kind ever signed between NATO allies, and is believed to be the first step in Europe&#x27;s strategic autonomy and the creation of a European army. The deal was welcomed positively by other NATO allies such as the United States Germany, and the EU&#x27;s Commission, however it is opposed by Turkey as &quot;harmful&quot;. According to experts, the deal aims to become the basis for the creation of a European defense structure with its own autonomous dynamics and priorities, and part of Greece&#x27;s efforts in deterring Turkey&#x27;s neo-Ottoman expansionist policies in the region.

On 14 October, Greece and the United States expanded and indefinitely extended their defense pact amid tensions with Turkey. The agreement, known as the US-Greece Mutual Defense Cooperation Agreement, promotes a strategic partnership between the two countries and grants the American forces a broader use of Greek bases, including a military base near the Greece-Turkey border. According to the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, it aims at advancing &quot;security and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean and beyond&quot;. Furthermore, in his letter accompanying the deal, Blinken vowed &quot;to mutually safeguard and protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both countries against actions threatening peace, including armed attacks&quot;.

On 15 December 2021, Turkey&#x27;s Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu hinged Greece&#x27;s sovereignty over the Aegean islands to their demilitarized status, claiming for the first time that Greece loses its sovereign rights even over the major Greek islands (such as Chios, Lesvos, and Rhodes), from the moment it has militarized them. According to him, this claim of sovereignty over islands being dependent to their demilitarization, was reiterated in Turkey&#x27;s October 2021 letter to the United Nations as well. The international community however rejected Çavuşoğlu&#x27;s positions. The Israeli ambassador to Athens, Yossi Amrani, when commenting about Çavuşoğlu&#x27;s statements, pointed to the joint Israel, Cyprus and Greece declaration at the tripartite Jerusalem Summit earlier this month, which stressed the need for all countries to respect the sovereign rights of their neighbors in the region. Besides Israel and Cyprus, also the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland, the European Union,
Egypt and China lend their support to Greece, with the State Department stating that &quot;the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected and protected. The sovereignty of Greece οn these islands is not in question,&quot; and the European Union expressing its disapproval, stating that &quot;the sovereignty of Greece in these islands is indisputable&quot; and that &quot;the international agreements must be respected.&quot; The US ambassador to Athens Geoffrey Pyatt also affirmed his country&#x27;s solidarity with Greece against the Turkish claims. A few days later, however, the Turkish President Erdogan, reiterated Çavuşoğlu&#x27;s statements, insisting that their militarization is a &quot;violation of [international] treaties&quot; and that &quot;the issue of the islands is always controversial&quot;. Greece&#x27;s Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias expressed his regret for Erdogan&#x27;s remarks, stating that they go against the spirit of the United Nations&#x27;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and raises questions about Turkey&#x27;s membership in the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO). Turkey&#x27;s retired ambassadors, and Selim Kuneralp, questioned their country&#x27;s foreign policy regarding the Greek islands, noting that it is harmful for its own interests. While commenting on the Turkish government&#x27;s attempts to challenge their sovereignty, Eralp stated that &quot;There are many claims of sovereignty that the islands were given on condition [of demilitarization]. There is no such thing. The islands located beyond three miles were given to Greece and Turkey has accepted it for many years. Putting this into question now – in diplomacy – makes Turkey an aggressive state&quot;, adding that &quot;there are over 2,400 islands and islets in the Mediterranean. A treaty to count all these islands is out of the question. We have not seen it [happening] anywhere. [The Treaty of] Lausanne gave the islands beyond three miles to Greece, whether we like it or not.&quot;

On 9 July 2022, officials from Turkey&#x27;s AKP-led ruling coalition, the People&#x27;s Alliance, appeared for the first time in photographs with a revisionist map claiming Greece&#x27;s largest island, Crete, as belonging to Turkey. Besides Crete, the entire eastern half of the Aegean Sea, its islands and their waters, which were initially claimed as part of the &quot;Blue Homeland&quot; doctrine, are also shown as Turkish. This prompted strong reactions and condemnation both in Greece and abroad, with Athens regarding the unprecedented move as an aggressive act, and the Greek Prime Minister asking publicly the Turkish President to clarify his position on the new map, something he avoided doing. The United States and Germany also rebuked the map&#x27;s claims as unacceptable. Following these developments, the head of the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Senator Robert Menendez, announced congressional amendments conditioning future US arm sales of F-16 to Turkey on its respect of Greek sovereignty. These amendments which require that the US administration shows the US Congress that Turkey has &quot;not violated the sovereignty of Greece&quot; in the past 120 days prior to the sale, and that concrete steps have been taken &quot;to ensure no such F-16s are used by Turkey for repeated unauthorized territorial overflights of Greece&quot;, passed on 14 July.

On August 23, Turkey&#x27;s Defense Ministry claimed that Greek Air Force fighter jets placed radar locks on Turkish F-16s escorting US B-52 bombers as part of the NATO mission. Following the incident, Turkey summoned the Greek military attaché and filed a complaint with NATO. A few days later, it also claimed that the radar of a Greek S-300 missile system based on the island of Crete has been used to locked on to the Turkish F-16s. These allegations were denied by Greece, while a Western military official noted that Turkey has yet to provide any evidence to support them. According to experts, it is believed that Turkey uses fake news regarding the use of S-300 by Greece to create analogies between Turkey&#x27;s S-400 and Greece&#x27;s S-300 in a bid to convince the US administration to lift the Countering America&#x27;s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) sanctions which were imposed on Turkey for acquiring them from Russia. However the United States refuted Turkey&#x27;s attempts to create any analogies between its S-400 and Greece&#x27;s S-300. In the past, Turkey has again unsuccessfully attempted to justify the use of S-400 and thus lift the CAATSA sanctions on Ankara, by pointing again to Greece&#x27;s S-300.

=== September 2022: Threat of invasion ===
By 3 September 2022, Turkey&#x27;s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan threatened Greece with a Turkish military invasion of the Greek islands which, according to him, are &quot;occupied&quot;. Greece responded by reiterating its right to defend its islands against what it described as an &quot;expansionist&quot; Turkish stance, and pointed to Turkey&#x27;s Aegean coast just opposite the Greek islands, noting that Turkey maintains there its landing fleet, the largest in Europe, along with a full formation of its army. Greece furthermore announced that it is informing the United Nations and NATO about the leader&#x27;s remarks. The European Union and its presiding country, the Czech Republic condemned Erdoğan&#x27;s threats as &quot;unacceptable&quot;, while France&#x27;s Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna responded by recalling the mutual assistance clause signed last year that unites Paris and Athens. According to the international media, the Turkish leader&#x27;s remarks constituted an escalation of his rhetoric as he was preparing for the 2023 elections in his country, which are seen as crucial for his nearly 20-year rule; increasing the political rhetoric against a neighboring country would rally his nationalist base amid Turkey&#x27;s ongoing economic troubles. According to Greek analysts, these threats of invasion made Greece&#x27;s position appear more credible to the international community as the need to maintain a military presence on its islands for deterrence against Turkey is now fully justifiable.

On 11 December, Erdogan also stated that the Turkish-manufactured Tayfun missiles &quot;will hit Athens&quot;, Greece&#x27;s capital city, if the Greek islands continue to be armed up.

=== 2023: Revival of &quot;earthquake diplomacy&quot; and renewed talks ===
On 10 January 2023, the Court of Appeals of Tripoli suspended an energy exploration deal signed a few months earlier, on 3 October 2022, between Turkey and Libya&#x27;s Government of National Unity (GNU) which is based at Tripoli. The agreement had included scope for oil and gas exploitation in waters that Ankara and Tripoli have claimed as their own through the 2019 Turkey–GNA maritime agreement, which partially overlaps with waters claimed by Egypt and Greece as part of their 2020 EEZ agreement.

In February 2023, south-central Turkey was hit by devastating earthquakes, to which Greece responded immediately by sending quake-relief aid. The newspaper &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; noted that the Greek aid came despite severe diplomatic tensions in recent months, and Erdoğan&#x27;s repeated threats to militarily invade Greece&#x27;s islands. According to Deutsche Welle, these developments marked the revival of the Greek–Turkish earthquake diplomacy of 1999 between the two countries, once again. This improvement in the bilateral relations, resulted in the cessation of Turkey&#x27;s practice of military overflights above Greece&#x27;s territories and the violations of its national airspace, ever since.

In December 2023, Turkish President Erdoğan visited Athens for talks with Greek PM Mitsotakis. This was the first visit in 6 years and the talks were held in a positive atmosphere and considered a success after recent bad relations. No major disputes were resolved, however, the two leaders signed a non-binding declaration of friendship, and numerous bilateral agreements; including managing migration flows, and committed to continuing talks in Ankara in the spring of 2024.

==Status of islands==

There have been a number of disputes related to the territories of the Greek islands themselves. These have related to the demilitarized status of some of the main islands in the area; to Turkish concerns over alleged endeavours by Greece to artificially expand settlements to previously uninhabited islets; and to the existence of alleged &quot;grey zones&quot;, an undetermined number of small islands of undetermined sovereignty.

===Demilitarized status===
The question of the demilitarized status of some major Greek islands is complicated by a number of facts. Several of the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean as well as the Turkish straits region were placed under various regimes of demilitarization in different international treaties. The regimes developed over time, resulting in difficulties of treaty-interpretation. However, the military status of the islands in question did not constitute a serious problem in the bilateral relations until the Cyprus crisis of 1974, after which both Greece and Turkey re-interpreted the stipulations of the treaties. Greece, claiming an inalienable right to defend itself against Turkish aggression, reinforced its military and National Guard forces in the region. Furthermore, Greece maintains the position that it has the right to militarize its islands in the same context as the rest of Europe, where the appliance of demilitarization statute on islands and territories ceased with the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact; i.e. the cessation of demilitarization of Italy&#x27;s Panteleria, Lampedusa, Lampione and Linosa islands, and West Germany from the NATO side, and the cessation of demilitarization of Bulgaria, Romania, East Germany, and Hungary from the Warsaw Pact&#x27;s side, and the cessation of demilitarization of Finland. Turkey, on the other hand, denounces this as an aggressive act by Greece and as a breach of international treaties. From a legal perspective, three groups of islands may be distinguished: (a) the islands right off the Turkish Dardanelles straits, i.e. Lemnos and Samothrace; (b) the Dodecanese islands in the southeast Aegean; and (c) the remaining northeast Aegean islands (Lesbos, Chios, Samos, and Ikaria).

====Lemnos and Samothrace====
These islands were placed under a demilitarization statute by the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, to counterbalance the simultaneous demilitarization of the Turkish straits area (the Dardanelles and Bosphorus), Imbros and Tenedos. The demilitarization on the Turkish side was later abolished through the Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits in 1936. Greece holds that, by superseding the relevant sections of the earlier treaty, the convention simultaneously lifted also the Greek obligations with respect to these islands. Against this, Turkey argues that the Montreux treaty did not mention the islands and has not changed their status. Greece, on the other hand, cites Turkish official declarations, by the then Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Rustu Aras, to that effect made in 1936, assuring the Greek side that Turkey would consider the Greek obligations lifted.

====Dodecanese====
These islands were placed under a demilitarization statute after the Second World War by the Treaty of peace with Italy (1947), when Italy ceded them to Greece. Italy had previously not been under any obligation towards Turkey in this respect. Turkey, in turn, was not a party to the 1947 treaty, having been neutral during WWII. Greece therefore holds that the obligations it incurred towards Italy and the other parties in 1947 are &quot;res inter alios acta&quot; for Turkey in the sense of Article 34 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which states that &quot;a treaty does not create obligations or rights for a third country&quot;, and that Turkey thus cannot base any claims on them. Turkey argues that the demilitarization agreement constitutes a status treaty (an &quot;objective régime&quot;), where according to general rules of treaty law such an exclusion does not hold.

====Lesbos, Chios, Samos, and Ikaria====
The remaining islands (Lesbos, Chios, Samos, and Ikaria) were placed under a partial demilitarization statute by the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. It prohibited the establishment of naval bases and fortifications, but allowed Greece to maintain a limited military contingent recruited from the local population, as well as police forces. With respect to these islands, Greece has not claimed that the treaty obligations have been formally superseded. However, in recent years it has argued that it is entitled to discount them, invoking Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. It argues that after the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus and the Turkish threat of war over the 12 miles issue, re-armament is an act of legitimate self-defence.

===&quot;Grey zones&quot;===
====Imia====
The first time a dispute between the two countries in the Aegean touched on questions of actual sovereignty over territories was in early 1996 at the tiny barren islets of Imia (known as Kardak in Turkey), situated between the Dodecanese island chain and the Turkish mainland. The conflict, triggered by the stranding of a Turkish merchant ship on the islets, was originally caused by factual inconsistencies between maps of the area, some of which assigned these islets to Greece, others to Turkey. The media of the two countries took up the issue and gave it a nationalistic turn, before the two governments even had the time to come to a full technical understanding of the true legal and geographical situation. Both governments finally adopted an intransigent stance, publicly asserting their own claims of sovereignty over the islets. The result was military escalation, which was perceived abroad as quite out of proportion with the size and significance of the rocks in question. The two countries were at the brink of war for a few days, until the crisis was defused with the help of foreign mediation.

During the crisis and in the months following it, both governments elaborated legal arguments to support their claims to sovereignty. The arguments exchanged concerned the interpretation of the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, which forms the principal basis for the legal status of territories in most of the region, as well as certain later diplomatic dealings between Turkey, Greece and Italy.

====Other &quot;grey zones&quot;====
In the wake of the Imia crisis, the Turkish government widened its argumentation to include not only Imia but also a possibly large number of other islands and small formations across the Aegean. Since then, Turkish authorities have spoken of &quot;grey zones&quot; of undetermined sovereignty. According to the Turkish argument, these islets, while not explicitly retained under Turkish sovereignty in 1923, were also not explicitly ceded to any other country, and their sovereignty has therefore remained objectively undecided.

The Turkish government has avoided stating exactly which islets it wishes to include in this category. On various occasions, Turkish government sources have indicated that islands such as Pserimos, Agathonisi, Fournoi and Gavdos (situated south of Crete) might be included. Most of them, unlike Imia, had undeniably been in factual Greek possession, which had never previously been challenged by Turkey, and all but the final two listed below have Greek residents and infrastructure. Furthermore, the islands are covered by previous treaties such as the Treaty of Lausanne, which defines Turkish sovereignty as limited to within 3 miles of the Anatolian mainland in the majority of cases. In a 2004 publication by Turkish authors close to the Turkish military leadership the following (among other, even smaller ones) were listed as potentially &quot;grey&quot; areas:
* Oinousses (between Chios and the Turkish coast),
* Antipsara (west of the islands of Psara and Khios),
* Fournoi,
* Arkoi,
* Agathonisi (Gaidaros),
* Pharmakonisi,
* Kalolimnos (near Imia),
* Pserimos,
* Gyali (between Kos and Nisyros),
* Syrna (SE of Astypalaia)
* Kandheliousa (south of Kos),
* Kalogeroi (islets) (small rocks 41 km northeast of Andros)

===Military overflights over Greek territory===

While Turkey has not attempted to challenge Greek sovereignty on the ground, its claims about &quot;grey area&quot; islands add to the number of minor military incidents, already numerous due to the 10-mile airspace and the FIR issues. Greek authorities routinely report that the Turkish Air Force ignores their national airspace. According to Greek press reports, the number of airspace violations rose sharply in 2006, as did the number of unauthorized Turkish military flights directly over Greek islands themselves. Renewed reports of systematic Turkish military flights directly over Greek islands like Pharmakonisi and Agathonisi were made in late 2008 and early 2009.

During the late 2010s, tensions rose again as Turkish fighter aircraft increased the number of direct armed overflights above inhabited Greek islands. While most overflights continue to occur above small islands that Turkey considers &quot;grey areas&quot;, such as Agathonisi or Oinousses, some incidents have also repeatedly been reported involving major and undisputed islands such as Rhodes, Lesbos, Chios or Leros. Flying over the territory of a country is considered a serious violation of its sovereignty and one of the most provocative acts by Turkey, directly challenging Greek territorial sovereignty.

In 2020, Turkish fighter aircraft also begun overflights above the Greek mainland, on Evros.

A regional Foreign Minister conference held on 11 May 2020 with the participation of Cyprus, Egypt, France, Greece and the United Arab Emirates, concluded with a joint declaration condemning Turkey for its practice of conducting armed overflights above the inhabited Greek islands.

In 2022, Turkish bomber aircraft approached the major Greek city of Alexandroupolis on Evros, within 2.5 miles. The jets reportedly flew near the US base located in the city&#x27;s port. This move is considered to be unprecedented, prompting protests from both the Greek authorities and the European Union, as well as USA&#x27;s disapproval, with the Head of Turkey&#x27;s Permanent Representation to the European Union Mehmet Bozay being summoned at Brussels by the Secretary General of the European Union External Action Service, Stefano Sannino.

==Turkish incidents with Frontex==
In September 2009, a Turkish military radar issued a warning to a Latvian helicopter patrolling in the eastern Aegean—part of the EU&#x27;s Frontex programme to combat illegal immigration—to leave the area. The Turkish General Staff reported that the Latvian Frontex aircraft had violated Turkish airspace west of Didim.
According to a Hellenic Air Force announcement, the incident occurred as the Frontex helicopter—identified as an Italian-made Agusta A109—was patrolling in Greek air space near the small isle of Farmakonisi, which lies on a favorite route used by migrant smugglers ferrying mostly illegal migrants into Greece and the EU from the opposite Turkish coastline. Frontex officials stated that they simply ignored the Turkish warnings as they did not recognise their being in Turkish airspace and continued their duties.

Another incident took place in October 2009 in the aerial area above the eastern Aegean sea, off the island of Lesbos. On 20 November 2009, the Turkish General Staff issued a press note alleging that an Estonian Border Guard aircraft Let L-410 UVP taking off from Kos on a Frontex mission had violated Turkish airspace west of Söke.

==Strategies of conflict resolution==
The decades since the 1970s have seen a repeated heightening and abating of political and military tensions over the Aegean. Thus, the crisis of 1987 was followed by a series of negotiations and agreements in Davos and Brussels in 1988. Again, after the Imia crisis of 1996, there came an agreement over peaceful neighbourly relations reached at a meeting in Madrid in 1997. The period since about 1999 has been marked by a steady improvement of bilateral relations.

For years, the Aegean dispute has been a matter not only about conflicting claims of substance. Rather, proposed strategies of how to resolve the substantial differences have themselves constituted a matter of heated dispute. Whereas Turkey has traditionally preferred to regard the whole set of topics as a &quot;political&quot; issue, requiring bilateral political negotiation, Greece views them as &quot;separate&quot; and purely &quot;legal&quot; issues, requiring only the application of existing principles of international law. Turkey has advocated direct negotiation, with a view to establishing what it would regard as an equitable compromise. Greece refuses to accept any process that would put it under pressure to engage in a give-and-take over what it perceives as inalienable and unnegotiable sovereign rights. Up to the late 1990s, the only avenue of conflict resolution that Greece deemed acceptable was to submit the issues separately to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.

The resulting stalemate between both sides over process was partially changed after 1999, when the European summit of Helsinki opened up a path towards Turkey&#x27;s accession to the EU. In the summit agreement, Turkey accepted an obligation to solve its bilateral disputes with Greece before actual accession talks would start. This was perceived as giving Greece a new tactical advantage over Turkey in determining which paths of conflict resolution to choose. During the following years, both countries held regular bilateral talks on the level of technical specialists, trying to determine possible future procedures. According to press reports, both sides seemed close to an agreement about how to submit the dispute to the court at The Hague, a step which would have fulfilled many of the old demands of Greece. However, a newly elected Greek government under Kostas Karamanlis, soon after it took office in March 2004, opted out of this plan, because Ankara was insisting that all the issues, including Imia and the &quot;grey zones&quot;, belonged to a single negotiating item. Athens saw them as separate. However, Greek policy remained at the forefront in advocating closer links between Ankara and the EU. This resulted in the European Union finally opening accession talks with Turkey without its previous demands having been fulfilled.

According to some commentators, the 2020 fall of energy prices, combined with the discovery of gas within the Turkish EEZ in the Black Sea means there is enough energy in Turkey that further exploration for gas is unnecessary.

According to Greece&#x27;s Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias, the disputes which are plaguing the Greek-Turkish relations for decades, can easily be resolved once Turkey accepts the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). To this, Dendias opined that the United States, due to their position and influence in the region, are an &quot;ideal partner&quot; in persuading Turkey to do so. Furthermore, he noted that the UNCLOS has been ratified by all the member states of the European Union, is part of the EU&#x27;s acquis communautaire, and therefore Greece&#x27;s talks with EU-candidate member Turkey on the delimitation of maritime zones are bound by it. Ronald Meinardus, head of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, analyst and author in Deutsche Welle, while commenting on the statements Dendias made during his official visit to Ankara in April 2021 about the UNCLOS being a prerequisite for joining the EU, confirmed that the Law of the Sea is a precondition for Turkey&#x27;s EU membership.

<text>Major Francis Edward Foley CMG (24 November 1884  – 8 May 1958) was a British Secret Intelligence Service officer. As a passport control officer for the British Embassy in Berlin, Foley &quot;bent the rules&quot; and helped thousands of Jewish families escape from Nazi Germany after Kristallnacht and before the outbreak of the Second World War. He is officially recognised as a British Hero of the Holocaust and as a Righteous Among the Nations.

== Early life ==

Foley was the third son of Isabella and Andrew Wood Foley, a Tiverton-born railway worker, whose family may have originated from Roscommon in Ireland in the early 1800s. After attending local schools in Somerset, Foley won a scholarship to Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, where he was educated by the Jesuits. He then went to a Catholic seminary in France to train as a priest but transferred to the Université de France in Poitiers to study Classics. While there he reconsidered his vocation for the priesthood and decided instead to pursue an academic career. He travelled extensively in Europe, becoming fluent in both French and German.

Foley graduated from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Hertfordshire Regiment on 25 January 1917. He was appointed temporary captain on 20 September 1917, while commanding an infantry company of the 1st Battalion, Hertfordshire Regiment, and was later with the 2nd/6th Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment, during which time he was mentioned in despatches.

== Joining secret service ==

The story of Foley&#x27;s escape from Germany and his language skills had been noted at the War Office. He was encouraged to apply for the Intelligence Corps. On 25 July 1918, Foley was promoted to lieutenant. In July 1918 he became part of a small unit that was responsible for recruiting and running networks of secret agents in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. After the Armistice he served for a short time in the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control in Cologne. On 19 April 1920 he relinquished the temporary rank of captain, and in December 1921 retired from the Army with the rank of captain.

After the running down of the commission, he was offered the post of passport control officer in Berlin which was a cover for his main duties as head of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) station. During the 1920s and &#x27;30s, Foley recruited agents and acquired key details of German military research and development.

Together with Wilfrid Israel and Hubert Pollack, Foley formed a special mechanism that specialized in rescuing Jews who were already taken into the first Nazi concentration camps. Pollack had contacts in the Gestapo; Wilfrid had money and direct links with sponsors abroad; and Foley was the man in charge of issuing visas. People came to Israel pleading for his help in releasing their relations from the camps; he gave the necessary funds to Pollack; Pollack obtained the documents; and Foley granted visas to those who Israel and Pollack told him were honest people whose names had been blackened by the Gestapo. Pollack and Israel kept Foley informed of any agents planted by the Gestapo among the visa applicants. This story is reflected among others in the film &quot;The Essential Link: The Story of Wilfrid Israel&quot; by filmmaker Yonatan Nir.

Foley is primarily remembered as a &quot;British Schindler&quot;. In his role as passport control officer, he helped thousands of Jews escape from Nazi Germany. At the 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann, he was described as a &quot;Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; for the way he risked his own life to save Jews threatened with death by the Nazis. Despite having no diplomatic immunity and being liable to arrest at any time, Foley would bend the rules when stamping passports and issuing visas, to allow Jews to escape &quot;legally&quot; to Britain or Mandatory Palestine, which was controlled by the British. Sometimes he went further, going into internment camps to get Jews out, hiding them in his home, and helping them get forged passports. One Jewish aid worker estimated that he saved &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of people from the Holocaust.


== Second World War ==
In 1939 and 1940, Foley was a passport control officer in Norway until the Germans invaded, when he was attached to Otto Ruge, C-in-C Norwegian Forces in the Field, for which services he received the Norwegian Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Order of St Olav. Foley and Margaret Reid, his assistant, abandoned Oslo on 9 April 1940 during the German advance, and travelled to Lillehammer and Åndalsnes. Before leaving Oslo, Foley and Reid burned the documents in the UK legation. Foley helped Norway&#x27;s commander-in-chief, General Otto Ruge, contact Britain to request assistance against the invader. Foley had his own radio transmitter that allowed Ruge to communicate with London independently of Norwegian landlines. Reid was a cipher expert who coded messages sent to Britain. Until minister Cecil Dormer arrived on 16 April, Foley acted as a UK representative with Norwegian authorities. Foley and Reid were evacuated from Molde by the Royal Navy on 1 May. At Åndalsnes Foley presumably met Martin Linge, who acted as liaison officer.

On 1 January 1941, he was awarded Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) as a captain in respect of his services to the Foreign Office. In 1941, he was given the task of questioning Hitler&#x27;s Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess after Hess&#x27;s flight to Scotland. After Hess was hospitalized in 1942, Foley helped coordinate MI5 and MI6 in running a network of double agents, the Double Cross System.
== Later life ==
Foley returned to Berlin very soon after the war under the cover of Assistant Inspector General of the Public Safety Branch of the Control Commission for Germany, where he was involved in hunting for Nazi war criminals.

In 1949, Foley retired to Stourbridge, Worcestershire, and died there in 1958. He is buried in Stourbridge Cemetery.

On 27 April 1961, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; carried the story, written by his widow, of his activities to save as many Jews as he possibly could. When no excuse could be found for a visa to Britain, he contacted friends working in the embassies of other nations for their assistance in granting visas to their countries.

His widow, Katharine Eva Foley, died on 17 April 1979 at her home in Sidmouth, Devon.

== Honours and awards ==
* Mentioned in despatches for service in World War I
* Order of St Olav Knight&#x27;s Cross (Norwegian) in 1941
* Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1941
* Righteous Among the Nations, awarded in October 1999 posthumously by Israel
* British Hero of the Holocaust, awarded posthumously in 2010

== Posthumous recognition ==
Foley was accorded the status of a Righteous Among the Nations by Israel&#x27;s Yad Vashem as a direct result of testimony from &quot;living witnesses&quot; found by Michael Smith while researching his biography of Foley. Lord Janner, chairman of the Holocaust Educational Trust, was instrumental in persuading Yad Vashem to look at Smith&#x27;s evidence. Some members of the Yad Vashem committee that determines whether someone should be named as a &quot;righteous gentile&quot; were initially sceptical that an MI6 officer would not have diplomatic immunity but the then Foreign Office historian Gill Bennett produced previously classified documents that demonstrated this to be the case. The cover of Smith&#x27;s book features the photograph from Foley&#x27;s first diplomatic passport with the date it was issued clearly shown as 11 August 1939.

In 2004 a remembrance plaque was dedicated to him at the entrance to Stourbridge&#x27;s Mary Stevens Park. The following year volunteers from Highbridge, Foley&#x27;s birthplace, raised money to erect their own tribute.
 A statue was commissioned from sculptor Jonathan Sells and unveiled on the anniversary of VE Day, which is also the anniversary of his death. The &#x27;Frank Foley Parkway&#x27; between Highbridge and Burnham-on-Sea opened on 7 July 2009.

In 2007, a film about Foley&#x27;s life was in the planning stages, but the producers were then taking legal action against MI6 to release still-classified documents related to his work.

On 24 November 2004, (the 120th anniversary of his birth), descendants of Foley, relatives of those he saved, representatives of Jewish organisations, British MPs and other well-wishers gathered at the British Embassy in Berlin for the unveiling of a plaque honouring Foley. At the ceremony, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw praised Foley&#x27;s heroism:

On 31 May 2009, a garden was dedicated in his memory at London&#x27;s Sternberg Centre, where a plaque was unveiled by Cherie Booth.

In 2010, Foley was named a British Hero of the Holocaust by the British Government.

In 2012, the Foreign Secretary, William Hague, unveiled a plaque to him at the Hoop Lane Jewish Cemetery in Golders Green, London, an initiative led by the Spanish and Portuguese Jews&#x27; Congregation and the West London Synagogue.

A National Express West Midlands bus is dedicated to him.

On 18 September 2018, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, unveiled a statue of Major Frank Foley in West Midlands town of Stourbridge in the presence of Foley&#x27;s great-nephew, Stephen Higgs.

<text>The Singapore national football team represents Singapore in the senior men&#x27;s international football. It is organised by the Football Association of Singapore (FAS), the governing body of football in Singapore, which is affiliated with the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and the regional ASEAN Football Federation (AFF). The team&#x27;s colours are red and white. Singapore are colloquially known as &quot;The Lions&quot;, an animal of prominent symbolic nature to the country. Singapore has one of the oldest national teams in Asia, with the FAS being the oldest football association in the continent itself. 

Despite the country having a small population pool, it has historically punched above its weight by successively producing squads that has fiercely competed with its larger and much more populated neighbours. This can be seen in its most significant successes, which have come in the regional AFF Championship, whereby Singapore had won four times in 1998, 2004, 2007, and 2012. Singapore was the first team to achieve this feat and the only team to win in all the finals that they had played. In 1998, Singapore defeated Vietnam in the final to capture the country&#x27;s first major international football title. In the 2004–05 competition, Singapore defeated Indonesia in a two-leg final 5–2 on aggregate. Singapore retained the trophy in 2007, beating Thailand 3–2 on aggregate in the final. In 2012, Singapore won the trophy a record 4th time, again defeating three-time champions Thailand 3–2 on aggregate in the final.

Singapore has also achieved notable results beyond its sub-confederation. In the 2007 AFC Asian Cup qualification, Singapore became the only team to beat Iraq where Iraq was en route to their Asian Cup-winning campaign. Singapore also drew with China 0–0, 1–1, and 2–2 at home in 2006, 2009 and 2024 respectively. In March 2008, Australia also failed to beat Singapore when the game ended in a goalless draw. During the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Japan was held to a draw at home at the Saitama Stadium by Singapore, being the only game where they had dropped points in the group. Singapore also notably managed to get good results against UEFA continent against Kazakhstan on 24 December 2006 which resulted in a 0–0 draw and Azerbaijan which ended in a 2–2 draw on 24 February 2012.

==History==

===Early history (1892–1994)===

In 1892, the Singapore Amateur Football Association applied to become a registered society. The HMS Malaya Cup (which was later known as the Malaysia Cup) was launched in 1921 by officers of a British battleship in Malaya, and Singapore was one of the six teams that took part in the inaugural year, and won the event. While the representative side in the Malaysia Cup and the Malaysian League was not the national team &quot;per se&quot; – this team included some foreign players as it is more of a club side – many Singapore football fans viewed the Singapore Lions club side as being almost synonymous to the national team as well. They either won or were runners up in the event every year until 1941, after which it was suspended because of World War II.

Overall, Singapore won 24 Malaysia Cup titles and two Malaysian League titles. After winning the Malaysia Cup and league double in 1994, the Football Association of Singapore withdrew from the Malaysian competitions following a dispute with the Football Association of Malaysia over gate receipts. Singapore subsequently launched its own professional league, the S.League, in 1996, and also began to put much more focus on the performance of its national team in international competitions.

At that time, Singapore hosted their first and so far, its only international competition, the 1984 AFC Asian Cup. The team was eliminated from the group stage with four points, a 2–0 win over India and a 1–1 draw to giant Iran. In the FIFA World Rankings, Singapore&#x27;s highest standing was in the first release of the figures, in August 1993, at 73rd.

===Rise of Singapore football (1995–2003)===
Singapore won the bronze medal in the 1995 Southeast Asian Games, after losing 0–1 in the semi-finals to the hosts and eventual gold medalists, Thailand. Singapore hosted the inaugural AFF Championship (then known as Tiger Cup) in 1996 but were eliminated in the group stages.

The national team again reached the semi-finals of the Southeast Asian Games in 1997, losing to Indonesia, and lost to Vietnam 0–1 in the third-place match.

However, in the 1998 edition of the AFF Championship, Singapore&#x27;s team led by coach Barry Whitbread won the group stage with victories over Malaysia and the Philippines. In the semi-finals, they beat Indonesia and subsequently edged out hosts Vietnam 1–0 in the final. This was the country&#x27;s first ever international title.

Jan B. Poulsen, who was part of Denmark&#x27;s backroom staff at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, was appointed the Technical Director of the Football Association of Singapore in 1999. Due to poor results by Singapore in the 2000 AFF Championship, coach Vincent Subramaniam was sacked and Poulsen took over as coach in December 2000. Singapore hosted the 2002 AFF Championship, but lost 0–4 to arch-rivals Malaysia in their first game. Before the game, local newspaper &quot;The New Paper&quot; was encouraging fans to turn up in numbers. After the game, the Lions attributed their heavy defeat to the unexpected large crowd. Singapore went on to win 2–1 over Laos, but a 1–1 draw in the final group game against Thailand was not enough for them to reach the knock-out stages. Poulsen was sacked after the tournament.

===AFF Championship triumph (2004–2012)===

Radojko Avramović took over as coach of the flailing and deflated Singapore national football team in July 2003. Singapore started the 2004 AFF Championship as underdogs but a 1–1 draw in their first game against hosts Vietnam, another draw against Indonesia, and wins against Cambodia and Laos saw them qualify for the semi-finals.

Singapore were drawn against Myanmar in the two-legged semi-finals. Singapore took a 4–3 away lead back home for the second leg. In the ill-tempered second leg, three Myanmar players were sent off and a reserve Myanmar goalkeeper even threw a water bottle at defender S. Subramani. Singapore went on to win 4–2 after extra time for an 8–5 aggregate victory.

Singapore then won the first leg of the two-legged final against Indonesia 3–1 in Jakarta, before winning 2–1 (5–2 on aggregate) in the second leg in front of a strong 55,000 home crowd at the former National Stadium.
In 2006, Avramović then led Singapore into the 2007 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers with a 2–0 victory at home over Iraq, but Singapore failed to build on this victory and then lost away to Palestine. The Singapore team then took on China away in Tianjin and lost to an injury time penalty. China travelled to Singapore for the second meeting and the Singapore defence held out for a 0–0 draw. A subsequent 2–4 loss to Iraq dashed Singapore&#x27;s hopes of qualifying for the Asian Cup. The Asian Cup qualifying campaign ended with a default 3–0 victory over Palestine, who were unable to fulfil the fixture.

Singapore hosted the group stages of the 2007 AFF Championship. After a 0–0 draw with Vietnam, Singapore then thrashed Laos 11–0 to record their largest-ever win. In the final group match, Singapore knocked Indonesia out of the tournament in a 2–2 draw. Singapore met Malaysia in the semi-final. The first leg saw a 1–1 draw in Shah Alam, while in the second leg at Singapore&#x27;s National Stadium, following another 1–1 draw, Singapore beat Malaysia in a penalty shoot-out 5–4, goalkeeper Lionel Lewis saving the final Malaysian spot kick from Mohd Khyril Muhymeen Zambri. In the final against Thailand, Singapore won a controversial first leg at home 2–1, then secured a 1–1 draw in Bangkok thanks to a late strike from Khairul Amri to retain the AFF Championship trophy. In the 2008 AFF Championship co-hosted by Indonesia and Thailand, Singapore was drawn in Group A to against Indonesia, Myanmar and Cambodia. Singapore progressed from the group as winners. However, they lost out to eventual winners Vietnam 0–1 on aggregate.

Singapore met Palestine in the first round of the 2010 FIFA World Cup Asian qualification. Singapore won the first leg 4–0 away in Doha, and the Palestinians again failed to fulfil the away fixture, so FIFA awarded Singapore a 3–0 win. Singapore was drawn with Tajikistan in the second round: Singapore won the home match 2–0 and drew the return leg 1–1 on 18 November to progress to the third round of the Asian Qualifying Tournament for the first time, where they were drawn against Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Uzbekistan. Singapore&#x27;s group stage campaign began with a loss to Saudi Arabia, but the Lions then beat Lebanon 2–0 at home. Successive losses to Uzbekistan, 3–7 and 0–1, left Singapore with little chance of getting into the next round. Singapore were finally eliminated when they lost 0–2 to the Saudis at home. FIFA later awarded Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan both a 3–0 win, where they won 2–0 and 1–0 respectively, due to Singapore fielding Qiu Li, who is not eligible to represent Singapore. Singapore finished third in the group with six points from six games after defeating Lebanon 2–1 in Beirut in their final game. With the elimination, Goal 2010 was ended.For the 2011 AFC Asian Cup qualification, Singapore was drawn in Group E, together with Iran, Thailand and Jordan. Singapore were beaten 0–6 by Iran in the first match, and then defeated Jordan 2–1. In November 2009, Singapore hosted Thailand at the National Stadium and lost 3–1, but won the return fixture 1–0 a few days later, earning Singapore their first victory on Thai soil in 48 years. Singapore next hosted Iran, losing 1–3, and the 1–2 defeat against Jordan which followed ended their hopes of Asian Cup football in 2011. The players reported some teammates were smoking during halftime in the match against Jordan. In 2010, Singapore drew with the Philippines 1–1, defeated Myanmar 2–1, then duly lost to Vietnam 0–1 in the knockout stage decider. As a result, the Singapore national football team was knocked out of the group stage in Hanoi. The Lions were criticised for their dismal performances in the AFF Championship, which they won in 1998, 2004, and 2007. In January 2011, the FAS decided to disband and revamp the national team. Six months later, The Lions were back in action after the dismal performances in 2010.

In May 2011, national team coach Avramović announced the new 33-strong national provisional squad for the upcoming international friendlies and 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign. The Lions were scheduled to play international friendlies against Maldives on 7 June 2011 and Laos on 18 July 2011. Few days after releasing the provisional 33-man squad, national team training started in preparation of the match against Maldives. Avramović led the new-look Lions in a game where Singapore won Maldives 4–0 at the Jalan Besar Stadium, Singapore in a friendly match. (Note. The match was not an &#x27;A&#x27; international because unlimited substitutions were allowed.) After the 4–0 win against Maldives, less than a week later before the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifier, a final friendly was played against Chinese Taipei. Singapore won the match 3–2 with goals from Aleksandar Đurić, Shi Jiayi and Fazrul Nawaz. In preparation for the third round of the World Cup Qualifiers, the Lions played a friendly non-&#x27;A&#x27; match against Thailand before their opening qualifier against China. The friendly finished 0–0.

Singapore received a bye to the second round of 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification in 2011 because of their accession to the third round of the qualifying in the previous World Cup. Their second round opponents were regional rivals Malaysia, whom they beat 5–3 in the first leg with goals from Aleksandar Đurić, Qiu Li, Mustafic Fahrudin and Shi Jiayi. The second leg was held at the National Stadium, Bukit Jalil on 28 July 2011. A 1–1 draw thanks to a key Shi Jiayi goal in the second half was enough to put Singapore through to the third round of 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. In the preliminary draw in Brazil on 30 July 2011 by the football governing body FIFA, Singapore was drawn into Group A for their Round 3 of the Asian qualifiers with Jordan, Iraq and China. Singapore kicked off the third round with a 1–2 loss to China in Kunming. They then succumbed to a second defeat, 0–2, against Iraq. The next match was slated to be held at Jalan Besar Stadium on 11 October against Jordan which Singapore lost 0–3. A 0–2 defeat to Jordan in Amman killed off the Lions&#x27; chances of progress. Singapore ended the year with a 0–4 defeat at home to China PR, their 5th consecutive loss. Iraq then dealt the Singapore team a heavy 1–7 lost in Doha with Singapore bowing out with no wins. Singapore then played a friendly match against UEFA nation Azerbaijan which resulted in a 2–2 draw where Singapore was down with two goals before Shahril Ishak breaks the deadlock in the 70th minute. Shahdan Sulaiman would then score an equaliser at the last kick of the game in the 90+3th minute stoppage time.

In the 2012 AFF Championship, Singapore started their tournament with a 3–0 win over close rivals Malaysia. They then lost 0–1 to Indonesia before winning 4–3 in the knockout stage decider against Laos. to top the group and qualify for the semi-finals which sees them face against the Philippines in the semi-finals, Singapore won 1–0 on aggregate with a solitary goal from Khairul Amri during the home leg of the semi-finals was enough to set up a meeting with Thailand in the finals. The Lions won the first leg of the finals 3–1 in Singapore. Despite losing the away leg 0–1, Singapore was able to pick up the 2012 AFF Championship, their fourth championship. Singapore holds the record for the highest number of AFF Championship titles at that point of time. Radojko Avramović ended his tenure as Singapore coach after the tournament.

===Falling performances and drought (2013–2018)===
FAS then hired the former legendary Singapore footballer, V. Sundramoorthy as head coach in 2013 ahead of the 2015 AFC Asian Cup qualification, Singapore was drawn in Group A, together with Jordan, Syria and Oman. Singapore were beaten 0–4 by Jordan in the first match, and then loss to Jordan with a scoreline of 0–2. In October 2013, Singapore hosted Syria at the Jalan Besar Stadium and with their first win of the campaign with a 2–1 victory thanks to Gabriel Quak&#x27;s late winner which was also his first international goal. But a month later, Syria beat Singapore in the return fixture 0–4. Singapore next hosted Jordan, losing 1–3, and the 1–3 defeat against Oman which followed ended their hopes of Asian Cup football in 2015.

The FAS announced on 15 May 2013 that they had appointed German Bernd Stange as the new head coach of the national team. On 27 May 2013, Stange announced his choice of 23 players for the friendlies against Myanmar and Laos on 4 June 2013 and 7 June 2013 respectively. The squad featured several new players who were called up to the national squad for the first time, including 17-year-old Adam Swandi. LionsXII midfielders Gabriel Quak and Faris Ramli and Tanjong Pagar United&#x27;s winger Hafiz Nor also received their first national call-ups. Veteran forward Indra Sahdan was also recalled to the national team. He took the captain&#x27;s armband on 4 June 2013 for coach Stange&#x27;s first game against Myanmar which Singapore won 2–0. He also scored the first goal in the second friendly match against Laos, which saw Singapore with a 5–2 victory. Following the two wins, Singapore&#x27;s FIFA World Rankings rose nine places to 156 in July 2013. On 15 October 2013, Stange registered his first international competition win in a 2015 AFC Asian Cup qualification match against Syria with Gabriel Quak scoring a late goal to win the match 2–1 at the Jalan Besar Stadium. Stange had been trying to inculcate the one-touch, quick-tempo style of play for into the Singapore team, and gear the team up for the 2014 AFF Championship and try to retain the AFF Championship. Singapore entered the 2014 AFF Championship as the defending champions trying to defend the cup on home soil, but their title defence was spoiled with a 1–2 defeat over Thailand, which they also faced back in 2012. Then, they beat Myanmar 4–2 before bowing out after suffering a 1–3 defeat to rivals Malaysia. The Lions finished with 3 points and 3rd in Group B, and are the first team in the history of the AFF Championship to bow out from the group stage as the defending champions.

Singapore then started their campaign with an away game against Cambodia on 11 June 2015 which ended 4–0 in favour of Singapore. Following which, they travelled to Saitama Stadium in Japan where they held the hosts to a goalless draw. However, they were defeated by Syria 0–1, at the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex in Muscat, Oman, marking their first loss in the group stages of the tournament. The Lions then beat Afghanistan by a scoreline of 1–0 and their 2nd consecutive win against Cambodia, winning the game 2–1. However, the winning streak ended when they faced Japan at home, and were defeated 0–3. They then went on to face Syria, which was a tight game. Khribin of Syria scored on the 20th minute and were 0-1 up. Safuwan of Singapore scored a late equaliser on the 89th minute but Singapore could not hold on to the draw which ended Khribin again scoring on the 3rd minute of added time after the 90th minute, this resulted in a 1–2 loss to Singapore. Singapore played their final game against Afghanistan and were defeated 1–2. Singapore finished in third place in the table with a total points of 10.

In April 2016, a month after the match against Afghanistan, the FAS announced that Bernd Stange contract would not be renewed and he left the Singapore national football team. After a few months of Stange&#x27;s departure, FAS announced the new caretaker coach was to be then Tampines Rovers head coach V. Sundramoorthy. Sundram&#x27;s first major tournament was the 2016 AYA Bank Cup in June where the team won host Myanmar and went on to the finals against Vietnam. In that match, the two teams drew after 90 mins and went on to extra time where Singapore conceded 3 goals to clinch second. After a few months, Sundram and FAS arranged the long-awaited Causeway Challenge against Singapore&#x27;s rival, Malaysia. In that match, Singapore created a lot of chances and dominated the game but was unfortunate to end the game with a 0–0 draw.

In 2016, Sundram also called up a few uncapped players like Syazwan Buhari, Khairulhin Khalid, Irfan Fandi, Abdil Qaiyyim, Shawal Anuar, Azhar Sairudin and Amy Recha. Many of which has at least one cap to their name. Although Hami Syahin was not called up for any matches, he was registered in the 40 man provisional squad for the 2016 AFF Championship. Sundram also recalled several players like Daniel Bennett, Mustafic Fahrudin, Zulfadli Zainal and Hafiz Nor. Ridhuan Muhammad was not recalled for any matches but was registered in the 40-man provisional squad for the 2016 AFF Championship. Sundram also gave chances to the two players, Shahfiq Ghani and Shahdan Sulaiman who both just recovered from long-term injuries to prove themselves. For the 2016 AFF Championship, Singapore was grouped with ASEAN giants, Thailand together with Indonesia and Philippines and was grouped in the &quot;Group of Death&quot; as the teams in this group were tough. Singapore then started their tournament with a 0–0 draw over Philippines. They then lost 0–1 to Thailand where Thailand&#x27;s Sarawut Masuk scored a late winner in the 89th minute. Singapore actually needed at least a draw with Indonesia and Thailand have to beat Philippines to qualify for the semi-finals. It was great news in the first half as Singapore was leading 1–0 but Singapore&#x27;s defence went to sleep and conceded 2 late goals for Indonesia to qualify for the semi-finals. Singapore ended their 2016 AFF Championship at the bottom of the table.

Singapore started their 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification third round campaign against Bahrain on 28 March 2017. Singapore drew with Bahrain with a score-line of 0–0. In Singapore&#x27;s next game, they went on to play against Chinese Taipei where they lost 1–2 at home with Singapore&#x27;s vice-captain Hariss Harun scoring and Xavier Chen and Chen Chao-an scoring for the visitors. Singapore&#x27;s head coach V. Sundramoorthy introduced a National Team Day where Mondays are for players who are called up for a short meeting and tactical training session in the pitch. In this call up, Sundram recalled players like Raihan Rahman. Sundram also called up the uncapped Ho Wai Loon tas a standby player for matches against Afghanistan and Bahrain. Sundram also called up uncapped Muhaimin Suhaimi for the friendly against Myanmar, the 2019 Asian Cup Qualifiers against Chinese Taipei and the friendly against Argentina. They made history for not winning any match in a year, reaching the lowest FIFA ranking ever of 173rd placing. Singapore finished bottom of the group with 2 points, losing the final match 1–0 to secure home-and-away losses against Chinese Taipei on 26 March 2018.

===Rebuilding (2019–2021)===
On 30 May 2019, former Jurong FC player, Tatsuma Yoshida was unveiled as the head coach of the national team. Yoshida&#x27;s first game in charge for the national team ended in a 4-3 victory against the Solomon Islands at the National Stadium. Singapore started off their 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign at the Jalan Besar Stadium drawing 2–2 to Yemen and winning Palestine 2–1 on 5 September 2019 and 10 September 2019 respectively. The national team than travelled to Riyadh to face Saudi Arabia at the King Saud University Stadium. Singapore managed to grip on to their defence and prevented Saudi Arabia from scoring until Salem Al-Dawsari breaks the dreadlock in the 83&#x27; minute into the match and to make thing worst, they conceded 2 more with goals coming from Fahad Al-Muwallad and Saleh Al-Shehri to punished Singapore with their poor communications and defensive errors. The Lions then finished in fourth place just above Yemen but see them qualified through to the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualifying third round.

Yoshida then extended his contract in early 2021 to focus on the 2020 AFF Championship which the tournament was postponed and rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Singapore later was chosen for host this tournament in a centralized venue. Singapore started off their group stage campaign with a winning streak by beating Myanmar 3–0, Philippines 1–2 and Timor-Leste 2–0 before losing to eventual cup winners, Thailand 2–0 in the last group stage fixtures. With 3 wins means Singapore qualified to the 2020 AFF Championship semi-finals as runners-up which see them face Indonesia. On 21 December 2021 in the first leg, Singapore and Indonesia contested in a 1–1 draw. On the reverse fixtures on 25 December 2021, Singapore was in a 2–1 lead after a freekick goal from Shahdan Sulaiman but all hope seems lost where Pratama Arhan ties the deficit for Indonesia which see the match going into extra time. With 2 players being red carded and a controversial that spark off where Indonesia captain, Asnawi Mangkualam was seen mocking Faris Ramli for his penalty missed incident, Singapore are forced to go through to extra time with 9 players but its get even worse when Hassan Sunny who have been brilliant the entire match making countless numbers of saves ended up picking up a red card for a last man challenge on Irfan Jaya which then see Singapore having three red card in one match being the first and only country in the AFF Championship tournament history to do so. Ikhsan Fandi was then forced to play as the goalkeeper in the dying minutes in the game as all of the substitution is being used up. As the whistle blows for a 4–2 win (5–3 on aggregate) for Indonesia, Oman referee, Qasim Al-Hatmi was being hurled with vulgarities and angry reaction from the Singaporean fans in which he received a death threat and fans flocking to the hotel lobby the referee is staying at after the game to find a reason for the referee awful officiating in which he seem as a favoritism to Indonesia and decision making controversy that caused Singapore the contentious red cards, penalty and offside goal being disallowed. Hassan Sunny received praised from both Singaporean and Indonesian fans for his heroic World class performances that keep Singapore in the match. Both Singaporean and Indonesian fans even respected one another nation for giving out a good solid fight. On 28 December 2021, Yoshida ended his stint as a head coach by mutual agreement citing family reasons after the Singapore team reached the semi-finals.

===Stagnation (2022–present)===

Nazri Nasri was the interim coach overseeing Singapore&#x27;s participation in the 2022 FAS Tri-Nations Series consisting of Malaysia and Philippines at the National Stadium. In his first game on 26 March 2022, Ikhsan Fandi scored two goals which saw Singapore winning against, Malaysia 2–1 and three days later, a 2–0 victory against the Philippines.

On 25 April 2022, FAS announced the appointment of Takayuki Nishigaya as the new head coach of Singapore. Nishigaya took charge of his first game playing in a friendly match against Kuwait in a 2–0 loss at the Al Nahyan Stadium in Abu Dhabi. Singapore started off their 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualifying third round playing in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan losing to Kyrgyzstan 2–1 after Song Ui-young scored the first goal for Singapore but gave away a penalty minutes later. Singapore then went on to narrowly lose to Tajikistan 0–1 and despite winning their last group fixture against Myanmar 6-2, they were eliminated from Asian Cup qualification.

In October 2023, Singapore started off their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification in the first round against Guam on 13 October. The first leg took place at the National Stadium, which saw a total number of 10,355 spectators in attendance as Singapore gained the upper hand with a 2–1 victory with goals from Christopher van Huizen and Jacob Mahler. However, the fans weren’t too satisfied with the performances as Singapore missed a lot of scoring opportunities sorely, lacking the composure in front of goal with the advantages of playing at home. The team then travelled to Dededo facing Guam in the second leg on 17 October at the GFA National Training Center where Shawal Anuar scored the only goal in the match securing the win. Singapore then advance to the second round being grouped with Asian powerhouse South Korea, China and Southeast Asia rivals, Thailand.

During the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification match on 21 March 2024, Singapore played at home to China, where they trailed 2–0 with Wu Lei scoring both goals, before Faris Ramli and Jacob Mahler secured the comeback to upset the visitors and hold them to a 2–2 draw. In the away fixture in Tianjin, immediately after conceding a goal to China, Hariss Harun punted a long ball to Ryhan Stewart, who then crossed the ball into the opponent box, providing it to Faris Ramli, who scored the header, equalising the match 8 seconds after kick-off. However, Singapore ultimately fell to a 4–1 defeat to China. On 6 June 2024, Singapore suffered one of their worst ever defeats in history after being hammered 7–0 by South Korea at the Singapore National Stadium, which saw global superstar, Son Heung-min and Lee Kang-in scoring a brace, with Hwang Hee-chan also scoring a goal in the match. Five days later, Singapore ended their World Cup qualification campaign with a 3–1 away loss to Thailand to end their run in bottom, but it was notable as Singapore&#x27;s valiant performance, notably with goalkeeper Hassan Sunny making 13 saves and Ikhsan Fandi&#x27;s equaliser, proved to have made the difference as Thailand&#x27;s victory was not enough to seize the second place from China, which progressed via superior head-to-head record.

===Kits and crest===
There have been different suppliers for the jerseys, from Admiral, Puma, Umbro, Grand Sport to Tiger. Since 2008, Nike has been the supplier for the national team.

Singapore had initially worn blue shirts and shorts as their home kit. However, in the late 1980s, The Lions adopted the national colours of red and white for their home kit while they kept blue as the colour for the away kit. This tradition stayed on through the 1990s. For the 2007 AFF Championship, the national team&#x27;s colours reverted to blue as its home kit and white as the other kit.

Before 2006, Singapore had been using the same kit for nearly 5 years, supplied by Tiger who had a tie-in with Diadora. The kit used during the 2007 AFF Championship made its final appearance on 4 February 2007 against Thailand. The next kit was first used on 24 June 2007 against DPR Korea. The jersey has white trims at the edge of the sleeves and around the neck. Unlike most national teams which use the country&#x27;s footballing association as a logo on the kit, the national flag of Singapore takes up the spot on the left chest instead while a white Nike logo is on the right chest and this symmetry also applies to the away jersey. The numbering and lettering font and colour is the same as the previous two home jerseys.

In 2008, tight-fit jerseys were revealed in the two traditional team colours: red for the home games and blue for the away matches. The kit was worn for the first time by the national team in the international friendly against Australia in preparation for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier home game against Lebanon on 26 March 2008.

In November 2010, Nike launched a new football kit for Singapore, specially made for the 2010 AFF Championship. The home kit&#x27;s design was of half dark red and light red. The away kit features half navy blue and light blue that was once worn by Singapore football team in 1970&#x27;s era. In recent years, the national team kits would often also include the FAS logo, either exclusively or along with the Singapore flag.

In 2020, Singapore revert back to using FAS logo on the national jersey for the first time since 1998. However, this earned backlash from fans demanding to retain the Singaporean flag on the national jersey. The 2022 jerseys were then included the Singaporean flag sitting on top of the FAS logo but still earned the negative outlash from fans stating that the flag deserve to be bigger. The national kit were worn for the first time during the team&#x27;s friendly against Maldives on 17 December 2022, which they won 3–1. This is also the team&#x27;s jersey for the 2022 AFF Championship.

===Home stadium===
From 1932 until the National Stadium was opened in 1973, Jalan Besar Stadium hosted all home games of Singapore&#x27;s representative sides which participated in the Malaysia Cup. Since then, all of Singapore&#x27;s home games in the Malaysia Cup and the national team home matches were played at the National Stadium.

However, the National Stadium was slated for demolishment in 2010 to make way for the new Singapore Sports Hub which was completed in 2014. Singapore played Australia in what was planned to be the last game ever to be played at that stadium. However, due to some delays caused by the addition of new plans for the Singapore Sports Hub, the National Stadium continued to host 5 more matches, and it was also the venue for two more 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification matches. While the stadium was being rebuilt as part of the new Sports Hub, the Singapore national team played its home games at the Jalan Besar Stadium, sharing it with the LionsXII and the Cubs (U15 and U16 teams).

Since the start of 2004, Singapore has played its home matches in 7 different stadiums all over Singapore.

===Supporters===
&quot;SingaBrigade&quot; is the name of the major supporters for the national team in Singapore which consists of a die-hard Singapore football fan group. They are known for their high fanaticism and support towards the national team. In every international match the national team played, they are found in a group standing at the supporters area. The main colours for these supporter are usually in red with a scarf and banners just like the national team kits colours. These supporters always bring drums and large national flags to the stadiums. Since 2023, the numbers of home attendance rise up where it sold 29,644 tickets during the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC) match against Thailand in November.

===Rivalries===
Singapore has rivalries with Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Philippines and Myanmar. Their rivalries are rooted geographicial proximity.
Singapore has rivalries with Malaysia known as the &quot;Causeway Derby&quot; or mononymously &quot;Lions against Tigers&quot;. The Singapore-Malaysia derby used to be the highlight of the football calendar on both sides of the Causeway. When football fever for these two national teams was at its peak in the 1980s and early 1990s, queueing overnight for tickets was not uncommon where the rivalry lays dormant for a number of years. A group of Malaysian Ultras burnt signs of Singapore currency, and booed when Singapore&#x27;s national anthem was played in the second leg at the Shah Alam Stadium in 2012. The spiteful nature of the discussions, peppered with obscenities and racist remarks, prompted concern in the football fraternities of both countries. After Singapore advanced to the third round of 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification, at the expense of Malaysia, beating them 6-4 on aggregate, an online war broke out among its supporters. Malaysian fans, incensed by what they felt was the Lions&#x27; time-wasting tactics during the second leg of the second-round qualifier in Kuala Lumpur, created a Facebook page mocking the Singapore national side. The spiteful nature of the discussions, peppered with obscenities and racist remarks, prompted concern in the football fraternities of both countries. Tensions ran high during the first leg in Singapore on 23 July 2011, when missiles from Malaysia&#x27;s travelling fans rained down on the Jalan Besar Stadium field after the Lions&#x27; fourth goal. The return leg was even more ill-tempered. Water bottles were aimed at the Singapore players after the final whistle, while Lions goalkeeper, Izwan Mahbud was targeted by laser pointers during the game to distract him.

<text>In number theory, a practical number or panarithmic number is a positive integer formula_1 such that all smaller positive integers can be represented as sums of distinct divisors of formula_1. For example, 12 is a practical number because all the numbers from 1 to 11 can be expressed as sums of its divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: as well as these divisors themselves, we have 5 = 3 + 2, 7 = 6 + 1, 8 = 6 + 2, 9 = 6 + 3, 10 = 6 + 3 + 1, and 11 = 6 + 3 + 2.

The sequence of practical numbers begins
Practical numbers were used by Fibonacci in his &quot;Liber Abaci&quot; (1202) in connection with the problem of representing rational numbers as Egyptian fractions. Fibonacci does not formally define practical numbers, but he gives a table of Egyptian fraction expansions for fractions with practical denominators.

The name &quot;practical number&quot; is due to . He noted that &quot;the subdivisions of money, weights, and measures involve numbers like 4, 12, 16, 20 and 28 which are usually supposed to be so inconvenient as to deserve replacement by powers of 10.&quot; His partial classification of these numbers was completed by and . This characterization makes it possible to determine whether a number is practical by examining its prime factorization. Every even perfect number and every power of two is also a practical number.

Practical numbers have also been shown to be analogous with prime numbers in many of their properties.

==Characterization of practical numbers==
The original characterisation by stated that a practical number cannot be a deficient number, that is one of which the sum of all divisors (including 1 and itself) is less than twice the number unless the deficiency is one. If the ordered set of all divisors of the practical number formula_1 is formula_4 with formula_5 and formula_6, then Srinivasan&#x27;s statement can be expressed by the inequality
formula_7
In other words, the ordered sequence of all divisors formula_8 of a practical number has to be a complete sub-sequence.

This partial characterization was extended and completed by and who showed that it is straightforward to determine whether a number is practical from its prime factorization.
A positive integer greater than one with prime factorization formula_9 (with the primes in sorted order formula_10) is practical if and only if each of its prime factors formula_11 is small enough for formula_12 to have a representation as a sum of smaller divisors. For this to be true, the first prime formula_13 must equal 2 and, for every from 2 to , each successive prime formula_11 must obey the inequality
:formula_15
where formula_16 denotes the sum of the divisors of &quot;x&quot;. For example, 2 × 32 × 29 × 823 = 429606 is practical, because the inequality above holds for each of its prime factors: 3 ≤ σ(2) + 1 = 4, 29 ≤ σ(2 × 32) + 1 = 40, and 823 ≤ σ(2 × 32 × 29) + 1 = 1171.

The condition stated above is necessary and sufficient for a number to be practical. In one direction, this condition is necessary in order to be able to represent formula_12 as a sum of divisors of formula_1, because if the inequality failed to be true then even adding together all the smaller divisors would give a sum too small to reach formula_12. In the other direction, the condition is sufficient, as can be shown by induction. 
More strongly, if the factorization of formula_1 satisfies the condition above, then any formula_21 can be represented as a sum of divisors of formula_1, by the following sequence of steps:
* By induction on formula_23, it can be shown that formula_24. Hence formula_25.
* Since the internals formula_26 cover formula_27 for formula_28, there are such a formula_29 and some formula_30 such that formula_31.
* Since formula_32 and formula_33 can be shown by induction to be practical, we can find a representation of &quot;q&quot; as a sum of divisors of formula_33.
* Since formula_35, and since formula_36 can be shown by induction to be practical, we can find a representation of &quot;r&quot; as a sum of divisors of formula_36.
* The divisors representing &quot;r&quot;, together with formula_38 times each of the divisors representing &quot;q&quot;, together form a representation of &quot;m&quot; as a sum of divisors of formula_1.

==Properties==
*The only odd practical number is 1, because if formula_1 is an odd number greater than 2, then 2 cannot be expressed as the sum of distinct divisors More strongly, observes that other than 1 and 2, every practical number is divisible by 4 or 6 (or both).
*The product of two practical numbers is also a practical number. Equivalently, the set of all practical numbers is closed under multiplication. More strongly, the least common multiple of any two practical numbers is also a practical number. 
*From the above characterization by Stewart and Sierpiński it can be seen that if formula_1 is a practical number and formula_42 is one of its divisors then formula_43 must also be a practical number. Furthermore, a practical number multiplied by power combinations of any of its divisors is also practical.
*In the set of all practical numbers there is a primitive set of practical numbers. A primitive practical number is either practical and squarefree or practical and when divided by any of its prime factors whose factorization exponent is greater than 1 is no longer practical. The sequence of primitive practical numbers begins

*Every positive integer has a practical multiple. For instance, for every integer formula_1, its multiple formula_45 is practical.
*Every odd prime has a primitive practical multiple. For instance, for every odd prime formula_46, its multiple formula_47 is primitive practical. This is because formula_47 is practical but when divided by 2 is no longer practical. A good example is a Mersenne prime of the form formula_49. Its primitive practical multiple is formula_50 which is an even perfect number.

==Relation to other classes of numbers==
Several other notable sets of integers consist only of practical numbers:
*From the above properties with formula_1 a practical number and formula_42 one of its divisors (that is, formula_53) then formula_43 must also be a practical number therefore six times every power of 3 must be a practical number as well as six times every power of 2.
*Every power of two is a practical number. Powers of two trivially satisfy the characterization of practical numbers in terms of their prime factorizations: the only prime in their factorizations, &quot;p&quot;1, equals two as required. 
*Every even perfect number is also a practical number. This follows from Leonhard Euler&#x27;s result that an even perfect number must have the form formula_55. The odd part of this factorization equals the sum of the divisors of the even part, so every odd prime factor of such a number must be at most the sum of the divisors of the even part of the number. Therefore, this number must satisfy the characterization of practical numbers. A similar argument can be used to show that an even perfect number when divided by 2 is no longer practical. Therefore, every even perfect number is also a primitive practical number.
*Every primorial (the product of the first formula_56 primes, for some formula_56) is practical. For the first two primorials, two and six, this is clear. Each successive primorial is formed by multiplying a prime number formula_11 by a smaller primorial that is divisible by both two and the next smaller prime, formula_59. By Bertrand&#x27;s postulate, formula_60, so each successive prime factor in the primorial is less than one of the divisors of the previous primorial. By induction, it follows that every primorial satisfies the characterization of practical numbers. Because a primorial is, by definition, squarefree it is also a primitive practical number.
*Generalizing the primorials, any number that is the product of nonzero powers of the first formula_61 primes must also be practical. This includes Ramanujan&#x27;s highly composite numbers (numbers with more divisors than any smaller positive integer) as well as the factorial numbers.

==Practical numbers and Egyptian fractions==
If formula_1 is practical, then any rational number of the form formula_63 with formula_64 may be represented as a sum formula_65 where each formula_66 is a distinct divisor of formula_1. Each term in this sum simplifies to a unit fraction, so such a sum provides a representation of formula_63 as an Egyptian fraction. For instance,
formula_69

Fibonacci, in his 1202 book &quot;Liber Abaci&quot; lists several methods for finding Egyptian fraction representations of a rational number. Of these, the first is to test whether the number is itself already a unit fraction, but the second is to search for a representation of the numerator as a sum of divisors of the denominator, as described above. This method is only guaranteed to succeed for denominators that are practical. Fibonacci provides tables of these representations for fractions having as denominators the practical numbers 6, 8, 12, 20, 24, 60, and 100.

 showed that every rational number formula_70 has an Egyptian fraction representation with formula_71 terms. The proof involves finding a sequence of practical numbers formula_72 with the property that every number less than formula_72 may be written as a sum of formula_74 distinct divisors of formula_72. Then, formula_56 is chosen so that formula_77, and formula_78 is divided by formula_79 giving quotient formula_29 and remainder formula_81. It follows from these choices that formula_82. Expanding both numerators on the right hand side of this formula into sums of divisors of formula_72 results in the desired Egyptian fraction representation. use a similar technique involving a different sequence of practical numbers to show that every rational number formula_70 has an Egyptian fraction representation in which the largest denominator is formula_85.

According to a September 2015 conjecture by Zhi-Wei Sun, every positive rational number has an Egyptian fraction representation in which every denominator is a practical number. The conjecture was proved by .

== Analogies with prime numbers ==

One reason for interest in practical numbers is that many of their properties are similar to properties of the prime numbers. 
Indeed, theorems analogous to Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture and the twin prime conjecture are known for practical numbers: every positive even integer is the sum of two practical numbers, and there exist infinitely many triples of practical numbers formula_86. Melfi also showed that there are infinitely many practical Fibonacci numbers ; the analogous question of the existence of infinitely many Fibonacci primes is open. showed that there always exists a practical number in the interval formula_87 for any positive real formula_88, a result analogous to Legendre&#x27;s conjecture for primes. Moreover, for all sufficiently large formula_88, the interval formula_90 contains many practical numbers.

Let formula_91 count how many practical numbers are at 
 conjectured that formula_91 is asymptotic to formula_93 for some constant formula_94, a formula which resembles the prime number theorem, strengthening the earlier claim of that the practical numbers have density zero in the integers.
Improving on an estimate of , found that formula_91 has order of magnitude formula_96.
 proved Margenstern&#x27;s conjecture. We have
formula_97
where formula_98 Thus the practical numbers are about 33.6% more numerous than the prime numbers. The exact value of the constant factor formula_94 is given by
formula_100
where formula_101 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant and formula_46 runs over primes.

As with prime numbers in an arithmetic progression, given two natural numbers formula_103 and formula_29, 
we have
formula_105
The constant factor formula_106 is positive if, and only if, there is more than one practical number congruent to formula_107.
If formula_108, then formula_109. 
For example, about 38.26% of practical numbers have a last decimal digit of 0, while the last digits of 2, 4, 6, 8 each occur with the same relative frequency of 15.43%.

== The number of prime factors, the number of divisors, and the sum of divisors ==

The Erdős–Kac theorem implies that for a large random integer formula_110, the number of prime factors of formula_110 (counted with or without multiplicity) follows an approximate normal distribution with mean formula_112 and variance formula_112. The corresponding result for practical numbers implies that for a large random practical number formula_110, the number of prime factors is approximately normal with mean formula_115 and variance formula_116, where formula_117 and formula_118. That is, most large integers formula_110 have about formula_112 prime factors, while most large practical numbers formula_110 have about formula_122 prime factors. 

As a consequence, most large integers formula_110 have formula_124 divisors, while most large practical numbers formula_110 have formula_126 divisors. In both cases, the average number of divisors is much larger than the typical number of divisors: for integers formula_127, the average number of divisors is about formula_128, while for practical numbers formula_127, it is about formula_130.

The average value of the sum-of-divisors function formula_131, for integers formula_127, as well as for practical numbers formula_127, has order of magnitude formula_134.

<doc id="1205312" wikidata="Q7506354" url="?curid=1205312" title="Si Begg">
<text>Si Begg (born 1972) is an English electronic dance music DJ, musician and record producer. His recording career began in 1993 and he has used a number of different pseudonyms and band names, and released music in different styles on several record labels.

He has also recorded music for short films, television advertisements and video games and has performed sound design work for television channels including the BBC, Channel 4 and MTV. Most recently he has provided the soundtrack for the hit Netflix sitcom &quot;Lovesick&quot;.

==History==
Si Begg studied at Trinity School and Mid Warwickshire college, becoming interested in electronic music from an early age. Begg confessed that the first electronic-based record he ever heard was &quot;Probably Jean Michel Jarre; my uncle used to be into his stuff, and used to play it in the car. My brother&#x27;s mate&#x27;s dad also had &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; and stuff like that. I remember being really into all the sounds and noises, the total futurism. And I was right into &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Tron&quot; and all those kinda kids&#x27; sci-fi things.&quot;

Listening to John Peel&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show in the late 1980s, Begg was introduced to early Chicago acid. This influenced him to move away from playing guitar and drums with schoolmates and toward creating cut-up electronica with fellow electronic musicians, under the group name Cabbage Head Collective.

==Career==
Begg initially gained experience working as a sound engineer in the early 1990s, helping to produce live music and studio albums for other artists, and began DJing in 1991.
He began creating his own music in 1993, and a year later, released 3 EPs with techno artist and fellow Cabbage Head alumni Cristian Vogel, under the band name &quot;Inevitable Technology&quot;. The pair later founded a record company, Mosquito, in 1997. During this time, Begg assembled a recording studio (which is now located in Harrow, in northwest London), and learned about A&amp;R and label management.

He moved to London in the 1990s. Begg&#x27;s works as Cabbage Boy were subsequently released on their Ninja Tune sub-label, Ntone.
Begg released his solo debut album &quot;Commuter World&quot; on Caipirinha Productions in 1998. He continued to release 12&quot; singles on a variety of small independent record labels (including his own).

In 2001, he released &quot;The Mission Statement&quot; on the Mute Records subsidiary Novamute, going by the name of as S. I. Futures. This was followed by another Si Begg album, &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; (2003)

Since 2005, he has also released mp3 files on Digital Distortions and further singles on another label that he founded himself, Noodles Recordings and its sub-labels, Noodles Institute of Technology and Noodles Discothèque, which he called &quot;the stupidest recording organisation in the world&quot;. The description comes from the fact that the label releases such a wide variety of musical styles, a tactic most labels would avoid.

In addition to working as a recording artist, he also performs live DJ sets throughout Europe. He currently has two DJ residencies in London, &quot;Big Beat Boutique&quot; at Scala and &quot;Freakin the Frame&quot; at The End. He has also worked as a remixer.

Begg&#x27;s compositions have been featured in films, TV shows and trailers placed by Elephant Music.

==Pseudonyms and collaborations==
Begg has recorded under variety of names, both as a solo artist and in collaboration with other artists. He explains that it is a &quot;necessity because of the way the industry kind of works. Because a lot of people want exclusive names and there&#x27;s just no way I could. If there was one label that I felt was my home and I didn&#x27;t want to do stuff for other labels then that would be fine, but no single label is willing to release my full output – my full kind of range. So I have to come up with these different projects all the time.&quot;,

Solo recording names include:
* Si Begg
* Bigfoot
* Bigfoot Futures Ltd
* Buckfunk 3000
* Cabbage Boy / Cabbageboy
* Culture Cruncher
* Dr. Nowhere versus The Maverick DJ
* Lenny Logan / Lenny &quot;The Stylus&quot; Logan (one Lenny Logan track featured &quot;Zygmunt Janowski&quot;, who, again, is actually Si Begg)
* S. I. Futures

Band names include:
* Bigfoot &amp; Maverick DJ
* Cabbage Head Collective (with Cristian Vogel, Tim Wright (of Germ, Neil Landstrumm and Anthony Michael Alexander)
* Inevitable Technology (with Cristian Vogel)
* State of the Art (with Tony Thorpe of The Moody Boys)

<text>== General ==
For scientific plotting applications, Gist is a scientific graphics library written in C by David H. Munro of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. It supports three graphics output devices: X Window, PostScript, and Computer Graphics Metafiles (CGM). The library is promoted as being small (written directly to Xlib), efficient, and full featured. Portability is restricted to systems running X Window (essentially, the Unix world).

=== Python variant ===
There is a Python port of Gist called PyGist; it is used as one of several optional graphics front ends of the scientific library SciPy. PyGist is also ported to Mac OS and Microsoft Windows.

<text>Seelow () is a German town, seat of the Märkisch-Oderland, a district of Brandenburg. As of 2013 its population was of 5,464.

==Geography==
It is situated in the extreme east of Germany, 70 km (40 miles) east of Berlin, 16 km (10 miles) west of the border with Poland.

==History==

The village appears in the records held in 1252 by Archbishop Wilbrand of Magdeburg. At that time, listed as &quot;Villa Zelou&quot;, it was included in the property of the formerly Polish Bishopric of Lebus (Lubusz Land), contested between the Magdeburg archbishops and the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg.

Seelow suffered damaging town fires in 1630, 1788 and again in 1809.

From 1816 Seelow was included for administrative purposes in the , a subdivision of the Frankfurt Region within the Prussian Province of Brandenburg. In 1863 the district council office was relocated to Seelow and in 1950 &quot;Lebus district&quot; was renamed &quot;Seelow district&quot;; following frontier changes agreed with the Soviet Union in 1945, the town of Lebus itself had lost to Poland much of the agricultural area that had traditionally supported it. Between 1952 and 1993, Seelow was the administrative centre for the within the larger Frankfurt territory.

Seelow was the location of one of the last major pitched battles in Europe during the Second World War - the Battle of the Seelow Heights. In this battle, from 16 to 19 April 1945, Soviet troops under Marshal Zhukov opened the way to Berlin. By the time the slaughter was over the town was largely destroyed, primarily through a major air attack which took place on 17 April 1945, and which was followed by extensive burning and plunder.

==Cultural references==
Because of its importance in the Second World War, Seelow is today featured in many video games, books and films. Seelow is a playable map in the popular video game Call of Duty: World at War. The Battle of the Seelow Heights is featured extensively in Men of War. The planet Тзаэло (Tzaelow) in the Warhammer 40,000 universe is a likely reference to the town of Seelow, particularly the way that the battle is fought.

==Demography==


==Twin towns – sister cities==

Seelow is twinned with:

* Moers, Germany (1990)
* Kostrzyn nad Odrą, Poland (1998)
* Międzychód, Poland (1998)
* Nangis, France (1998)

<text>S32 Jingping Expressway () is an expressway in Beijing, China.

==Construction stages==
Construction started in early 2005, with a stretch opened by 2006. By 2007, the entire expressway was completed in full. The expressway is heading into Tianjin and linked up with the Jinji Expressway.

==Route==
This expressway is projected to head east. It begins at Huanggang Bridge on Jingcheng Expressway between 5th Ring Road and the 6th Ring Road and stretch to central Pinggu in eastern Beijing.

The route was &quot;agreed in principle&quot; by the planning authorities; however, the route was slightly altered. It would start at Liqiao on the 6th Ring Road and the Litian Expressway would link it.

The stretch that starts at Liqiao was connected to Huanggang Bridge.

==Connections==
There would be connections at the following points:

* Jingcheng Expressway: Huaggang Bridge
* Airport Expressway (Beijing): Wenyu Bridge
* 6th Ring Road (Beijing): Litian Bridge</text><links>

<doc id="1205325" wikidata="Q1139740" url="?curid=1205325" title="High voltage">
<text>High voltage electricity refers to electrical potential large enough to cause injury or damage. In certain industries, &quot;high voltage&quot; refers to voltage above a certain threshold. Equipment and conductors that carry high voltage warrant special safety requirements and procedures. 

High voltage is used in electrical power distribution, in cathode-ray tubes, to generate X-rays and particle beams, to produce electrical arcs, for ignition, in photomultiplier tubes, and in high-power amplifier vacuum tubes, as well as other industrial, military and scientific applications.

== Definition ==

The numerical definition of depends on context. Two factors considered in classifying a voltage as high voltage are the possibility of causing a spark in air, and the danger of electric shock by contact or proximity.

The International Electrotechnical Commission and its national counterparts (IET, IEEE, VDE, etc.) define &quot;high voltage&quot; as above 1000 V for alternating current, and at least 1500 V for direct current.

In the United States, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) establishes nominal voltage ratings for 60 Hz electric power systems over 100 V. Specifically, ANSI C84.1-2020 defines &quot;high voltage&quot; as 115 kV to 230 kV, &quot;extra-high voltage&quot; as 345 kV to 765 kV, and &quot;ultra-high voltage&quot; as 1,100 kV. British Standard BS 7671:2008 defines &quot;high voltage&quot; as any voltage difference between conductors that is higher than 1000 VAC or 1500 V ripple-free DC, or any voltage difference between a conductor and Earth that is higher than 600 VAC or 900 V ripple-free DC.

Electricians may only be licensed for particular voltage classes in some jurisdictions. For example, an electrical license for a specialized sub-trade such as installation of HVAC systems, fire alarm systems, closed-circuit-television systems may be authorized to install systems energized up to only 30 volts between conductors, and may not be permitted to work on mains-voltage circuits. The general public may consider household mains circuits (100 to 250 VAC), which carry the highest voltages they normally encounter, to be &quot;high voltage&quot;.

Voltages over approximately 50 volts can usually cause dangerous amounts of current to flow through a human being who touches two points of a circuit, so safety standards are more restrictive around such circuits.

In automotive engineering, high voltage is defined as voltage in range 30 to 1000 VAC or 60 to 1500 VDC.
The definition of &quot;extra-high voltage&quot; (EHV) again depends on context. In electric power transmission engineering, EHV is classified as voltages in the range of 345,000– 765,000 V. In electronics systems, a power supply that provides greater than 275,000 volts is called an &quot;EHV Power Supply&quot;, and is often used in experiments in physics. The accelerating voltage for a television cathode ray tube may be described as &quot;extra-high voltage&quot; or &quot;extra-high tension&quot; (EHT), compared to other voltage supplies within the equipment. This type of supply ranges from 5 kV to about 30 kV.

The Unicode text character representing &quot;high voltage&quot; is U+26A1, the symbol &quot;⚡︎&quot;.

== Production ==
The common static electric sparks seen under low-humidity conditions always involve voltage well above 700 V. For example, sparks to car doors in winter can involve voltages as high as 20,000 V.

Electrostatic generators such as Van de Graaff generators and Wimshurst machines can produce voltages approaching one million volts at several amps, but typically don&#x27;t last long enough to cause damage. Induction coils operate on the flyback effect resulting in voltages greater than the turns ratio multiplied by the input voltage. They typically produce higher currents than electrostatic machines, but each doubling of desired output voltage roughly doubles the weight due to the amount of wire required in the secondary winding. Thus scaling them to higher voltages by adding more turns of wire can become impractical. The Cockcroft-Walton multiplier can be used to multiply the voltage produced by an induction coil. It generates DC using diode switches to charge a ladder of capacitors. Tesla coils utilize resonance, are lightweight, and do not require semiconductors.

The largest scale sparks are those produced naturally by lightning. An average bolt of negative lightning carries a current of 30 to 50 kiloamperes, transfers a charge of 5 coulombs, and dissipates 500 megajoules of energy (120 kg TNT equivalent, or enough to light a 100-watt light bulb for approximately 2 months). However, an average bolt of positive lightning (from the top of a thunderstorm) may carry a current of 300 to 500 kiloamperes, transfer a charge of up to 300 coulombs, have a potential difference up to 1 gigavolt (a billion volts), and may dissipate 300 GJ of energy (72 tons TNT, or enough energy to light a 100-watt light bulb for up to 95 years). A negative lightning strike typically lasts for only tens of microseconds, but multiple strikes are common. A positive lightning strike is typically a single event, but the larger peak current may flow for hundreds of milliseconds, making it considerably more energetic than negative lightning.

== Sparks in air ==
The dielectric breakdown strength of dry air, at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), between spherical electrodes is approximately 33 kV/cm. This is only a rough guide, since the actual breakdown voltage is highly dependent upon the electrode shape and size. Strong electric fields (from high voltages applied to small or pointed conductors) often produce violet-colored corona discharges in air, as well as visible sparks. Voltages below about 500–700 volts cannot produce easily visible sparks or glows in air at atmospheric pressure, so by this rule these voltages are &quot;low&quot;. However, under conditions of low atmospheric pressure (such as in high-altitude aircraft), or in an environment of noble gas such as argon or neon, sparks appear at much lower voltages. 500 to 700 volts is not a fixed minimum for producing spark breakdown, but it is a rule-of-thumb. For air at STP, the minimum sparkover voltage is around 327 volts, as noted by Friedrich Paschen.

While lower voltages do not, in general, jump a gap that is present before the voltage is applied, interrupting an existing current flow with a gap often produces a low-voltage spark or arc. As the contacts are separated, a few small points of contact become the last to separate. The current becomes constricted to these small &quot;hot spots&quot;, causing them to become incandescent, so that they emit electrons (through thermionic emission). Even a small 9 V battery can spark noticeably by this mechanism in a darkened room. The ionized air and metal vapour (from the contacts) form plasma, which temporarily bridges the widening gap. If the power supply and load allow sufficient current to flow, a self-sustaining arc may form. Once formed, an arc may be extended to a significant length before breaking the circuit. Attempting to open an inductive circuit often forms an arc, since the inductance provides a high-voltage pulse whenever the current is interrupted. AC systems make sustained arcing somewhat less likely, since the current returns to zero twice per cycle. The arc is extinguished every time the current goes through a zero crossing, and must reignite during the next half-cycle to maintain the arc.

Unlike an ohmic conductor, the resistance of an arc decreases as the current increases. This makes unintentional arcs in an electrical apparatus dangerous since even a small arc can grow large enough to damage equipment and start fires if sufficient current is available. Intentionally produced arcs, such as used in lighting or welding, require some element in the circuit to stabilize the arc&#x27;s current/voltage characteristics.

== Uses ==

=== Distribution ===

Electrical transmission and distribution lines for electric power typically use voltages between tens and hundreds of kilovolts. The lines may be overhead or underground. High voltage is used in power distribution to reduce ohmic losses when transporting electricity long distance.

=== Industrial ===
It is used in the production of semiconductors to sputter thin layers of metal films on the surface of the wafer. It is also used for electrostatic flocking to coat objects with small fibers that stand on edge.

=== Scientific ===
Spark gaps were used historically as an early form of radio transmission. Similarly, lightning discharges in the atmosphere of Jupiter are thought to be the source of the planet&#x27;s powerful radio frequency emissions.

High voltages have been used in landmark chemistry and particle physics experiments and discoveries. Electric arcs were used in the isolation and discovery of the element argon from atmospheric air. Induction coils powered early X-ray tubes. Moseley used an X-ray tube to determine the atomic number of a selection of metallic elements by the spectrum emitted when used as anodes. High voltage is used for generating electron beams for microscopy. Cockcroft and Walton invented the voltage multiplier to transmutate lithium atoms in lithium oxide into helium by accelerating hydrogen atoms.

== Safety ==
Voltages greater than 50 V applied across dry unbroken human skin can cause heart fibrillation if they produce electric currents in body tissues that happen to pass through the chest area. The voltage at which there is the danger of electrocution depends on the electrical conductivity of dry human skin. Living human tissue can be protected from damage by the insulating characteristics of dry skin up to around 50 volts. If the same skin becomes wet, if there are wounds, or if the voltage is applied to electrodes that penetrate the skin, then even voltage sources below 40 V can be lethal.

Accidental contact with any high voltage supplying sufficient energy may result in severe injury or death. This can occur as a person&#x27;s body provides a path for current flow, causing tissue damage and heart failure. Other injuries can include burns from the arc generated by the accidental contact. These burns can be especially dangerous if the victim&#x27;s airway is affected. Injuries may also be suffered as a result of the physical forces experienced by people who fall from a great height or are thrown a considerable distance.

Low-energy exposure to high voltage may be harmless, such as the spark produced in a dry climate when touching a doorknob after walking across a carpeted floor. The voltage can be in the thousand-volt range, but the average current is low.

The standard precautions to avoid injury include working under conditions that would avoid having electrical energy flow through the body, particularly through the heart region, such as between the arms, or between an arm and a leg. Electricity can flow between two conductors in high voltage equipment and the body can complete the circuit. To avoid that from happening, the worker should wear insulating clothing such as rubber gloves, use insulated tools, and avoid touching the equipment with more than one hand at a time. An electrical current can also flow between the equipment and the earth ground. To prevent that, the worker should stand on an insulated surface such as on rubber mats. Safety equipment is tested regularly to ensure it is still protecting the user. Test regulations vary according to country. Testing companies can test at up 300,000 volts and offer services from glove testing to Elevated Working Platform (or EWP) testing.

=== Distribution ===

Contact with or close approach to line conductors presents a danger of electrocution. Contact with overhead wires can result in injury or death. Metal ladders, farm equipment, boat masts, construction machinery, aerial antennas, and similar objects are frequently involved in fatal contact with overhead wires. Unauthorized persons climbing on power pylons or electrical apparatus are also frequently the victims of electrocution. At very high transmission voltages even a close approach can be hazardous, since the high voltage may arc across a significant air gap.

Digging into a buried cable can also be dangerous to workers at an excavation site. Digging equipment (either hand tools or machine driven) that contacts a buried cable may energize piping or the ground in the area, resulting in electrocution of nearby workers. A fault in a high-voltage transmission line or substation may result in high currents flowing along the surface of the earth, producing an earth potential rise that also presents a danger of electric shock.

For high voltage and extra-high voltage transmission lines, specially trained personnel use &quot;live line&quot; techniques to allow hands-on contact with energized equipment. In this case the worker is electrically connected to the high-voltage line but thoroughly insulated from the earth so that he is at the same electrical potential as that of the line. Since training for such operations is lengthy, and still presents a danger to personnel, only very important transmission lines are subject to maintenance while live. Outside these properly engineered situations, insulation from earth does not guarantee that no current flows to earth—as grounding or arcing to ground can occur in unexpected ways, and high-frequency currents can burn even an ungrounded person. Touching a transmitting antenna is dangerous for this reason, and a high-frequency Tesla coil can sustain a spark with only one endpoint.

Protective equipment on high-voltage transmission lines normally prevents formation of an unwanted arc, or ensures that it is quenched within tens of milliseconds. Electrical apparatus that interrupts high-voltage circuits is designed to safely direct the resulting arc so that it dissipates without damage. High voltage circuit breakers often use a blast of high pressure air, a special dielectric gas (such as SF6 under pressure), or immersion in mineral oil to quench the arc when the high voltage circuit is broken.

Wiring in equipment such as X-ray machines and lasers requires care. The high voltage section is kept physically distant from the low voltage side to reduce the possibility of an arc forming between the two. To avoid coronal losses, conductors are kept as short as possible and free of sharp points. If insulated, the plastic coating should be free of air bubbles which result in coronal discharges within the bubbles.

=== Electrostatic generators ===
A high voltage is not necessarily dangerous if it cannot deliver substantial current. Despite electrostatic machines such as Van de Graaff generators and Wimshurst machines producing voltages approaching one million volts, they deliver a brief sting. That is because the current is low, i.e. only a relatively few electrons move. These devices have a limited amount of stored energy, so the average current produced is low and usually for a short time, with impulses peaking in the 1 A range for a nanosecond.

The discharge may involve extremely high voltage over very short periods, but to produce heart fibrillation, an electric power supply must produce a significant current in the heart muscle continuing for many milliseconds, and must deposit a total energy in the range of at least millijoules or higher. Relatively high current at anything more than about fifty volts can therefore be medically significant and potentially fatal.

During the discharge, these machines apply high voltage to the body for only a millionth of a second or less. So a low current is applied for a very short time, and the number of electrons involved is very small.

=== Tesla coils ===

Despite Tesla coils superficially appearing similar to Van de Graaff generators, they are not electrostatic machines and can produce significant radio frequency currents continuously. The current supplied to a human body will be relatively constant as long as contact is maintained, unlike with electrostatic machines which generally take longer to build up charges, and the voltage will be much higher than the break-down voltage of human skin. As a consequence, the output of a Tesla coil can be dangerous or even fatal.

=== Arc flash hazard ===
Depending on the prospective short-circuit current available at a switchgear line-up, a hazard is presented to maintenance and operating personnel due to the possibility of a high-intensity electric arc. Maximum temperature of an arc can exceed 10,000 kelvins, and the radiant heat, expanding hot air, and explosive vaporization of metal and insulation material can cause severe injury to unprotected workers. Such switchgear line-ups and high-energy arc sources are commonly present in electric power utility substations and generating stations, industrial plants and large commercial buildings. In the United States, the National Fire Protection Association has published a guideline standard NFPA 70E for evaluating and calculating &quot;arc flash hazard&quot;, and provides standards for the protective clothing required for electrical workers exposed to such hazards in the workplace.

=== Explosion hazard ===

Even voltages insufficient to break down air can supply enough energy to ignite atmospheres containing flammable gases or vapours, or suspended dust. For example, hydrogen gas, natural gas, or petrol/gasoline vapor mixed with air can be ignited by sparks produced by electrical apparatus. Examples of industrial facilities with hazardous areas are petrochemical refineries, chemical plants, grain elevators, and coal mines.

Measures taken to prevent such explosions include:
* Intrinsic safety by the use of apparatus designed not to accumulate enough stored electrical energy to trigger an explosion
* Increased safety, which applies to devices using measures such as oil-filled enclosures to prevent sparks
* Explosion-proof (flame-proof) enclosures, which are designed so that an explosion within the enclosure cannot escape and ignite a surrounding explosive atmosphere (this designation does not imply that the apparatus can survive an internal or external explosion)

In recent years, standards for explosion hazard protection have become more uniform between European and North American practice. The &quot;zone&quot; system of classification is now used in modified form in U.S. National Electrical Code and in the Canadian Electrical Code. Intrinsic safety apparatus is now approved for use in North American applications.

=== Toxic gases ===
Electrical discharges, including partial discharge and corona, can produce small quantities of toxic gases, which in a confined space can be a health hazard. These gases include oxidizers such as ozone and various oxides of nitrogen. They are readily identified by their characteristic odor or color, and thus contact time can be minimized. Nitric oxide is invisible but has a sweet odor. It oxidizes to nitrogen dioxide within a few minutes, which has a yellow or reddish-brown color depending on concentration and smells of chlorine gas like a swimming pool. Ozone is invisible but has a pungent smell like that of the air after a lightning storm. It is a short-lived species and half of it breaks down into within a day at normal temperatures and atmospheric pressure.

=== Lightning ===
Hazards due to lightning include direct strikes on persons or property. However, lightning can also create dangerous voltage gradients in the earth, as well as an electromagnetic pulse, and can charge extended metal objects such as telephone cables, fences, and pipelines to dangerous voltages that can be carried many miles from the site of the strike. Although many of these objects are not normally conductive, very high voltage can cause the electrical breakdown of such insulators, causing them to act as conductors. These transferred potentials are dangerous to people, livestock, and electronic apparatus. Lightning strikes also start fires and explosions, which result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage. For example, each year in North America, thousands of forest fires are started by lightning strikes.

Measures to control lightning can mitigate the hazard; these include lightning rods, shielding wires, and bonding of electrical and structural parts of buildings to form a continuous enclosure.

<text>Stephen Robert Blass (born April 18, 1942) is an American retired professional baseball pitcher and television sports color commentator. He played his entire career in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates in and then from through . Blass was one of the National League&#x27;s top pitchers between 1968 and 1972, helping the Pirates win four National League Eastern Division titles in five years between and . He played a key role in the Pirates victory over the Baltimore Orioles in the 1971 World Series when he recorded two complete game victories. He remains the last National League pitcher to throw a complete game in Game Seven of a World Series. After his playing career ended, Blass had a 34-year career as a television sports commentator for Pittsburgh Pirates games.

==Playing career==
Blass was born in Canaan, Connecticut. Signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1960, he made his major league debut at the age of 22 in 1964 and joined the team permanently in 1966. He won 18 games in 1968, including a 2.12 ERA with seven shutouts, both career highs, and he finished particularly strong, winning the NL Player of the Month award for September with a 5–1 record, 1.65 ERA, and 46 SO. In 1969 he won 16 games with a career-high 147 strikeouts. From 1969 to 1972 he won 60 games, with a career-high 19 victories in 1972. In that season, he was a member of the National League team in the 1972 All-Star Game and was the runner up to Steve Carlton for the National League Cy Young Award.

In the 1971 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles, Blass pitched two complete game wins, allowing only seven hits and two runs in 18 innings, and was the winning pitcher in the 7th and deciding game. He finished second in the voting for World Series MVP behind teammate Roberto Clemente.

In a ten-season major league career, Blass posted a 103–76 record with 896 strikeouts and a 3.63 ERA in 1,597.1 innings pitched, including 16 shutouts and 57 complete games.

===&quot;Steve Blass disease&quot;===

Besides his Series performance, Blass is best known for his sudden and inexplicable loss of control after the 1972 season. His ERA climbed to 9.85 in the 1973 season, during which he walked 84 batters in innings, and struck out only 27; his WAR of -3.9 that year remains the worst of any pitcher in the modern era. After spending most of 1974 in the minor leagues, he retired from baseball in March 1975. Two months later writer Roger Angell chronicled Blass&#x27;s travails in an essay in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

A condition referred to as &quot;Steve Blass disease&quot; has become a part of baseball lexicon. The &quot;diagnosis&quot; is applied to talented players who inexplicably and permanently seem to lose their ability to throw a baseball accurately. The fielder&#x27;s variant of &quot;Steve Blass disease&quot; is sometimes referred to in baseball terminology as &quot;Steve Sax syndrome&quot;.

Notable victims of &quot;Steve Blass disease&quot; include Rick Ankiel, Mark Wohlers, Dontrelle Willis, Ricky Romero, and Daniel Bard.

In an interview years later, Blass stated that he was content with how his career panned out, mentioning that he had ten good years with the Pirates, won 100 games, and appeared in a World Series. He did mention that the sudden death of teammate and close friend Roberto Clemente in the offseason before he lost control – and the associated grief related to suddenly losing someone so close – was not a factor in him losing his control.

==Post-playing career==
Blass worked in the late 1970s as a Pittsburgh-area salesman for Jostens, a company that manufactures school class rings. He joined the Pirates&#x27; TV and radio broadcast team in 1983 as a part-time color commentator, earning a full-time post in 1986. Before the 2005 season, he announced that he would announce only home games from then on to spend more time with his family. Blass retired from broadcasting in 2019 after 60 years with the organization as a player and broadcaster.

He was inducted into the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 1997.

He was inducted into the Charleston, West Virginia Baseball Hall of Fame in 2022.

Blass&#x27; autobiography, &quot;A Pirate For Life&quot; (Triumph Books), was released on May 1, 2012. His memoirs, co-written with Erik Sherman, encompass his struggles with Steve Blass disease and his days as a color commentator for the Pirates.

Blass was announced as an inaugural member of the Pittsburgh Pirates Hall Of Fame on August 7, 2022.

<text>Circle of Dust is an industrial music project from New York City created by Klayton, who later became known as Celldweller. The project was active as a band from 1988 to 1998 and then re-started in 2015 after Klayton gained back ownership of his old albums. The project has released five studio albums: &quot;Circle of Dust&quot; (1992), &quot;Brainchild&quot; (1994), a re-recording of &quot;Circle of Dust&quot; (1995), &quot;Disengage&quot; (1998), and &quot;Machines of Our Disgrace&quot; (2016).

==History==

===Formation, &quot;Circle of Dust&quot; and &quot;Brainchild&quot; (1991–1995)===
Klayton formed Circle of Dust in New York City after the disbandment of his former late &#x27;80s thrash metal outfit Immortal. Signed to R.E.X. Records in 1991, Klayton self-recorded and self-produced all of the Circle of Dust material. The self-titled debut album, released by R.E.X. in 1992, has been described as &quot;post-&quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; industrial pop&quot;. That same year, Klayton, using the pseudonym Tox, teamed up with R.E.X. president Doug Mann that same year to create Brainchild and release &quot;Mindwarp&quot;, which featured music more intense than Circle of Dust&#x27;s debut and showcased dark cyberpunk-esque lyrics that were largely political in nature, and harsher, more thrash-influenced metal guitars. The now-defunct television show &quot;MTV Sports&quot; used part of the song &quot;Deviate&quot; for its long-time intro. After the release of both albums, Klayton also produced the &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; compilation (1993), which collected outtakes from &quot;Circle of Dust&quot;, &quot;Mindwarp&quot;, and Living Sacrifice&#x27;s &quot;Nonexistent&quot;, the latter of which featured Klayton&#x27;s programming work. The compilation also included Klayton&#x27;s own remixes of songs from each of those three albums.

In 1994, R.E.X. obtained a new distribution deal and pressed Klayton for a new release. As a stopgap measure, he re-recorded and remixed portions of Brainchild&#x27;s &quot;Mindwarp&quot; album and re-issued it under the Circle of Dust moniker, altering the cover art to reflect the album&#x27;s new status. R.E.X., however, urged Klayton, who was touring incessantly, to record a brand-new album; instead, Klayton opted to completely re-record the Circle of Dust&#x27;s debut and album, the sonic quality of which he had been strongly dissatisfied with. This re-issue (1995), with vastly improved musicianship and recording quality, scrapped three songs and included four new ones, but retained identical artwork. Circle of Dust toured heavily to promote both re-issues. The live touring band, by this point, included Daren &quot;Klank&quot; Diolosa on guitars, Chris Donohue on bass and keyboard, and Jason Tilton on drums.

When the 1995 tour concluded, Circle of Dust made plans to write and record new material. Unfortunately, R.E.X. lost its distribution deal, slid into bankruptcy, and found itself unable to pay the musicians money they were owed. Even though R.E.X. was not solvent enough to distribute any new Circle of Dust material, the label refused to let Circle of Dust out of their contract to seek another label. As a result, Klayton opted to disband the touring lineup and put Circle of Dust on hiatus while awaiting the outcome of R.E.X.&#x27;s financial situation.

=== Hiatus and side projects (1995–1998) ===
In between touring and recording for Circle of Dust, Klayton kept busy with a variety of other projects. In 1994, he contributed to and produced a side project with members of The Crucified called Chatterbox, which released &quot;Despite&quot;, its sole album. That same year, Klayton teamed up with friend Buka and began work on yet another side project, Argyle Park, under three pseudonyms: Dred, Deathwish, and Celldweller. Argyle Park featured a vast collection of guest collaborators, including Tommy Victor of Prong, JG Thirlwell of Foetus, and Mark Salomon (Stavesacre, The Crucified), and would go on to attain notoriety equal to that of Circle of Dust, losing the distinction of being a mere side project. In 1996, Klayton produced and programmed &quot;Still Suffering&quot;, the debut album of former Circle of Dust guitarist Daren &quot;Klank&quot; Diolosa. The unreleased songs Klank had written for Circle of Dust the year prior ended up on this album.

After Klayton put Circle of Dust on hiatus in 1995, he worked with illusionist Criss Angel to work on theatrical music and a magic show called Angeldust. It was during his work with Angel that Klayton changed his name from Scott Albert to Klay Scott, a nickname Angel gave him to denote his ability to &quot;take sounds and shape them as if they were clay&quot;. Klayton and Angel worked for over two years to finalize their multi-media show and released an initial album of music in 1998 called &quot;Musical Conjurings from the World of Illusion&quot;. During that same period of creativity, Klayton also recorded a posthumous Circle of Dust album as a formal gesture of farewell.

===&quot;Disengage&quot; (1998)===

Released in 1998 by Flying Tart Records, &quot;Disengage&quot; marked the formal end of Circle of Dust and contained reworkings of earlier songs (1991-1995) Klayton had written, some of which he had intended to release back in 1995 on a new Circle of Dust album. Klayton had rearranged and melded these older songs with new forms of music with which Klayton had been experimenting, thus becoming hybrids of Klayton&#x27;s older, faster, riff-based industrial-metal style and newer dance and ambient influences, with a stronger focus on songwriting. Thus the album was markedly different, musically, from the earlier Circle of Dust and Brainchild albums. Klayton closed the album with a selection of remixes, two of which were produced by Dan Leveler, who, it was later revealed, was Klayton&#x27;s younger brother and who later became a solo industrial/electronic artist in his own right, recording under the name Level. The liner notes of &quot;Disengage&quot; contains excerpts of an interview in which Klayton explained why he had disbanded Circle of Dust and started anew with Angeldust.

Much like Klayton&#x27;s experiences with R.E.X., his short deal with Flying Tart provided a number of frustrations. Although Klayton intended to release &quot;Disengage&quot; in 1997 and precede its release with an EP of &quot;Disengage&quot; remixes titled &quot;Refractorchasm&quot;, Flying Tart canceled the EP&#x27;s release and delayed &quot;Disengage&quot; until 1998, requiring Klayton to tack the EP onto &quot;Disengage&quot; in order to ensure the release of the music. The label also reduced the length of the album&#x27;s art booklet, which Klayton self-designed. Within two weeks of signing his contract with Flying Tart, the label was bought out and dissolved, ensuring the album saw extremely limited distribution.

=== Return and &quot;Machines of Our Disgrace&quot; (2015–2017) ===
In November 2015, Klayton announced that he had obtained the rights to the entire Circle of Dust catalog, including the &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; compilation and &quot;Argyle Park&quot; side project, and decided to revive his Circle of Dust moniker, stating on YouTube, &quot;I ... decided to dive back into production as Circle of Dust for the new Celldweller album. I wanted to take what I&#x27;m doing now and reinterpret it in the way I used to produce. ... There is an official Circle of Dust remix of &quot;Jericho&quot; on &quot;End of an Empire&quot;. ... There&#x27;s another track coming, brand-new, with Circle of Dust involved in the production, and it will be in your hands before the end of this year.&quot; Klayton also announced the 2016 re-release (with bonus content) of the entire Circle of Dust catalog on his FiXT label.

On March 4, 2016, Klayton released the remaster of the 1992 self-titled album, which included a bonus track on the deluxe edition, &quot;Neophyte&quot;, from the fifth studio album coming in December 2016. Also included in the deluxe edition are instrumental demos, a remix on &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; from Blue Stahli, an acoustic version of &quot;Onenemy&quot;, and their instrumental tracks. Circle of Dust&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Machines of Our Disgrace&quot;, was released in December 2016, on Klayton&#x27;s own label FiXT.

==Reception==
Circle of Dust was popular in Christian alternative metal circles during most of the 1990s. In writing the &quot;Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music&quot;, Mark Allan Powell refers to the band as &quot;the quintessential Christian industrial rock group.&quot; Unusual for an underground alternative Christian band of the time, Circle of Dust gained nearly as much exposure and appreciation in mainstream industrial audiences as it did among Christian audiences. Circle of Dust, along with Argyle Park, are regularly cited as influences by modern-day Christian industrial, industrial-metal, and electronic rock bands. Continued interest had been sufficient that, in the early 2000s, a small independent record company called Retroactive Records obtained the rights to the old Circle of Dust, Argyle Park, Brainchild, and &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; albums, remastered them, and re-issued them in limited runs of 1,000 each. However, Retroactive Records produced the re-issues without the creative input or supervision of Klayton, who has expressed his displeasure at the fact that his old works were marketed again without his permission and without him receiving any royalties.

As early as 1994, Circle of Dust (along with Argyle Park) had been criticized heavily by some Christian music press and by numerous fans for not having religious enough lyrics. These issues culminated in Klayton abandoning the Christian music industry entirely after the release of &quot;Disengage&quot;, a decision he explained at great length in a 1998 interview with HM Magazine.

<text>Orthacanthus is an extinct genus of fresh-water xenacanthiform cartilaginous fish, named by Louis Agassiz in 1843, ranging from the Upper Carboniferous into the Lower Permian. &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; had a nektobenthic life habitat, with a carnivorous diet. Multiple authors have also discovered evidence of cannibalism in the diet of &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; and of &quot;filial cannibalism&quot; where adult &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; preyed upon juvenile &quot;Orthacanthus.&quot; Synonyms of the genus &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; are &quot;Dittodus&quot; Owen, 1867, &quot;Didymodus&quot; Cope, 1883, &quot;Diplodus&quot; Agassiz, 1843, &quot;Chilodus&quot; Giebel, 1848 (preoccupied by &quot;Chilodus&quot; Müller &amp; Troschel, 1844).

During the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian, &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; was an apex predator of freshwater swamps and bayous in Europe and North America. Mature &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; reached nearly 3 meters (10 feet) in length. &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; teeth have a minimum of three cusps, two principal cusps, and an intermediate cusp, where the principal cusps are variously serrated, with complex base morphology. Additionally, &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; can be diagnosed by major transverse axes of proximal ends at a 45-degree angle to and often almost parallel to the labial margin of the base between the cusps. Deformed teeth are characteristic of the xenacanthiform sharks and of &quot;Orthacanthus.&quot;

== Discovery and history ==
The two genera &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; and &quot;Pleuracanthus&quot; were erected by Louis Agassiz based on isolated &quot;ichthyodorulites&quot; from the British Carboniferous System, and at the time were mistakenly thought of as the first indicators of skates. They were initially found in the United Kingdom in Dudley, Leeds, North Wales, Carluke, and Edinburgh. Three additional species from the Carboniferous formation of Ohio were described by John Strong Newberry, but two of them were junior homonyms of another species, &quot;Orthacanthus gracilis&quot; (Giebel, 1848). Accordingly, these two species received replacement names, &quot;O. adamas&quot; Babcock 2024 and &quot;O. lintonensis&quot; Babcock, 2024. Teeth associated with &quot;Diplodus,&quot; a genus of sharks, was found in the Carboniferous slates of England in Stafford, Carluke, and Burdiehouse, and in Nova Scotia. A well preserved impression from Ruppelsdorf, Bohemia, was described by Goldfuss, and in a separate paper, the same specimen was described under the name &quot;Xenacanthus dechenii&quot;. One year later, in 1849, Dr. Jordan mistakenly identified this specimen as the remains of a fossil shark, &quot;Triodus sessilis.&quot; This mistake was corrected and the specimen was identified as &quot;Xenacanthus&quot; by Mr. Schnur.

== Description ==

=== Teeth ===

The larger teeth of &quot;Orthacanthus compressus&quot; and &quot;Orthacanthus texensis&quot; are differentiated by a more pronounced basal tubercle in &quot;O. compressus.&quot; The basal tubercle of a typical tooth file is on the apical button of the underlying tooth. The larger adult teeth of &quot;O. compressus&quot; have a wider rather than longer base, similar to &quot;O. texensis&quot;, and tend to have serrations on both carinae of each cusp, while the medial carinae of smaller adult teeth are not serrated. The juvenile teeth of &quot;O. compressus&quot; are longer than wide, have a thinner base, and lack serrations, similar to O. platypternus teeth.

&quot;Orthacanthus platypternus&quot; from the Craddock Bonebed shark layer in Texas, USA, shows evidence of resorption, and the equivalent of an &quot;enamel pearl.&quot; Some of the teeth specimens found at this location show evidence of resorption, which has not been previously observed in other faunal members at the same location. Where the superjacent basal tubercle is expected to be resorbed if the teeth were to undergo resorption, the apical button is resorbed instead.

=== Sexual Dimorphism ===
The difference in characteristics between the large and small &quot;O. compressus&quot; adult teeth might indicate sexual dimorphism.

The spines of &quot;O. platypternus&quot; showing 3 to 4 dentine layers are interpreted to be subadults or young adults, and are separated into two size classes where females have the largest spines in comparison to males, indicating sexual dimorphism.

=== Dorsal spine, dentine, and denticles ===

The dorsal spines of &quot;Orthacanthus platypternus&quot; from the Craddock Bone Bed in Texas, USA, preserve a highly vascularized wall mainly composed of centrifugally growing dentine (the outer layer of the wall of the spine) in a succession of inwardly growing dentine layers that line the pulp cavity. These dentine layers are likely deposited periodically in accordance with seasonal variations in water temperature and food availability. More specifically, the periodic nature of the dentine layer deposits could be due to variation in calcium phosphate deposition following the changes in water temperature. Spines of individuals with 1-2 dentine layers are likely juveniles and result in the smallest sizes, whereas individuals showing at least 3-4 dentine layers result in two separate size classes. The cross section is oval near the opening of the pulp cavity and circular/subtriangular in the distal part of the non-denticulated region and circular in the denticulated region. The pulp cavity of the spine is filled with calcite, quartz, and opaque minerals.

=== Occipital spine and denticles ===
The spine is superficially inserted in the skin, where it grows and moves from a deep position in the dermis where trabecular dentine forms, to a superficial location where centrifugally growing lamellar dentine forms. The number of denticles per annual cycle vary with growth rate, and are independent dermal elements formed by the dermal papilla and secondarily attached by dentine to the spine proper. The density of denticulation also varies with the growth rate of the occipital spine. The ratio of length of denticulated region to total length of the spine changes throughout ontogeny.

== Classification ==
The teeth of &quot;Orthacanthus texensis&quot; and &quot;Orthacanthus platypternus&quot; from bonebeds from the Lower Permian of Texas, and the teeth of &quot;Orthacanthus compressus&quot; from the Upper Pennsylvanian of Nebraska and Dunkard Basin of the central Appalachians were used to determine the origin of &quot;O. texensis&quot; and &quot;O. platypternus&quot;. It has been proposed that both &quot;O. texensis&quot; and &quot;O. platypternus&quot; could be derived from &quot;O. compressus&quot;, where juvenile features of &quot;O. compressus&quot; are retained in the adult teeth of &quot;O. platypternus&quot; via paedomorphosis, and the juvenile features of &quot;O. compressus&quot; teeth are observed in the adult teeth of &quot;O. texensis.&quot;

The taxon &quot;Mimia&quot; sits outside of a clade that contains two monophyletic sister groups. The first monophyletic sister group defines a clade that includes the stem-group chondrichthyans which is visualized as a sister group of &quot;Doliodus&quot; and a large clade that comprises the cladodont sharks and &quot;Orthacanthus&quot;. The “cladodont sharks” plus &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; comprise two monophyletic sister groups: &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; and &quot;Cladodoides&quot; and &quot;Tamiobatis&quot; on one side, and the Symmoriiformes on the other side. The second monophyletic sister group characterizes crown chondrichthyans which contains two monophyletic sister groups (&quot;Euchondrocephali&quot; on one side and &quot;Euselachii&quot; on the other side).

The following cladogram follows a 2011 analysis by Alan Pradel and colleagues.
==Paleobiology==
A 2013 analysis of oxygen and strontium isotope composition of the teeth and spines of Late Carboniferous and Early Permian shark taxa was performed to infer the hydrochemistry of their ambient water, thus contributing to the controversy between an obligate freshwater or euryhaline diadromous lifestyle. Facies interpretations in the Permian of North America suggested that salinity tolerances of xenacanthiforms were restricted to near marine environments whereas only &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; could tolerate brackish water environments. A study covering the morphology and histology of dorsal spines of &quot;Orthacanthus platypternus&quot; also reported that &quot;The comparative analyses of the ontogenetic stages of the recorded specimens of &quot;O. platypternus&quot; and their distribution along different facies and localities indicate that this species was euryhaline, diadromous with a catadromous life-cycle which was strongly regulated by the semi-arid, seasonally dry tropical climate affecting western Pangea during the Early Permian.&quot; The 2013 analysis provided evidence leaning towards an obligate freshwater lifestyle of the sharks from Variscan European basins, and nonmarine ratios suggested tooth formation was influenced by meteoric waves enriched by evaporation. Euryhaline adaptation was not confirmed in the 2013 analysis. Paired bioapatite δ18O, δ13C, and δ34S analysis of &quot;O. buxieri&quot; suggested that the species was an inhabitant of freshwater lakes.

=== Predator-Prey relationship ===
&quot;Orthacanthus&quot; and &quot;Triodus&quot; have a predator-prey relationship in which &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; preyed on &quot;Triodus&quot;. Cranial remains of specimens of both &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; and &quot;Triodus&quot; from the Upper Carboniferous in Puertollano basin, Spain, give evidence of this predator-prey relationship. Numerous and well preserved cephalic elements of &quot;Triodus&quot; were associated with the cranial remains of &quot;Orthacanthus&quot;, and is explained by the inclusion of occipital spines of &quot;Triodus&quot; in the buccal cavity of &quot;Orthacanthus.&quot; Additional evidence is the co-occurrence of one &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; spine with many &quot;Triodus&quot; spines, which likely penetrated the soft tissue and cartilage of the mouth of &quot;Orthacanthus,&quot; similarly to modern sharks that feed on stingrays where the spines of stingrays have been found within and around the buccal cavities of &quot;Carcharhinus, Galeocerdo, Negaprion and Sphyrna.&quot;

Examination of &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; coprolites from Canada by Aodhan O&#x27; Gogain &quot;et al.&quot; revealed that in times of hardship, &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; was likely cannibalistic, as teeth from juvenile &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; were found within the coprolites of adults. &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; had a diet that consisted of actinopterygians, acanthodians, dipnoans, xenacanthids and tetrapods, based on analysis of coprolites and gut contents. There have also been suspicions of filial cannibalism due to the presence of juvenile &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; teeth inside an &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; coprolite. The feces of &quot;Orthacanthus&quot; has a spiral shape due to a corkscrew-shaped rectum.

== Paleoecology ==

The paleobiogeographical distribution of &quot;O. platypternus&quot; suggests ontogenetic habitat partitioning. Ontogenetic niche theory predicts that individuals may change their habitat or diet to maintain optimal growth rates or to improve trade-offs between mortality risk and growth. While smaller individuals likely lived in shallower waters such as in small ponds and stream channels of the coastal plain, larger individuals likely lived in deeper water such as the fluvio-lacustrine (rivers and lakes) and marginal marine areas.

The oldest known specimen of &quot;Orthacanthus&quot;, &quot;Diplodus problematicus,&quot; was found in New Brunswick, Canada, in the Lower Devonian (Emsian, c. 407 to 393 million years ago). Other specimens have been found in locations including the US, the United Kingdom, Poland, and France.

<text>The National Socialist Party of America (NSPA) was a Chicago-based organization founded in 1970 by Frank Collin shortly after he left the National Socialist White People&#x27;s Party. The NSWPP had been the American Nazi Party until shortly after the assassination of its leader George Lincoln Rockwell in 1967. Collin, a follower of Rockwell, developed differences with his successor Matt Koehl.

The party&#x27;s headquarters was in Chicago&#x27;s Marquette Park, and its main activity in the early 1970s was organizing loud demonstrations against black people moving into previously all-white neighborhoods. The marches and community reaction led the city of Chicago in 1977 to ban all demonstrations in Marquette Park unless they paid an insurance fee of $250,000 (equivalent to $ in ). While challenging the city&#x27;s actions in the courts, the party decided to redirect its attention to Chicago&#x27;s suburbs, which had no such restrictions.

Harold Covington succeeded Collin as leader of the NSPA in 1979, before dissolving the organization in 1981.

==Skokie controversy==

In 1977 Collin announced the party&#x27;s intention to march through the largely Jewish community of Skokie, Illinois, where one in six residents was a Holocaust survivor. A legal battle ensued when the village attempted to ban the event and the party. Represented by a Jewish ACLU lawyer in court, they won the right to march on First Amendment grounds in &quot;National Socialist Party v. Village of Skokie&quot;, a lawsuit carried all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, though it failed to carry through its intention (at the last minute, Chicago relented and they marched there instead).

<text>William Henry (May 19, 1729 – December 15, 1786) was an American gunsmith, engineer, politician, and merchant from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and a delegate for Pennsylvania to the Continental Congress in 1784, 1785, and 1786. Henry is also noted for his contributions in the development of the first steam engines.

==Biography==
William Henry was born near Downingtown, Pennsylvania to a family of Scots-Irish extraction. Prior to his service in the Continental Congress, Henry was a gunsmith and provided rifles to the British during the French and Indian War: Henry himself, serving as armorer, accompanied troops on John Forbes&#x27;s successful mission to retake Fort Duquesne in 1758. By 1760, according to Scott Paul Gordon, Henry had largely abandoned his occupation of gunsmith and had become a successful ironmonger and merchant in Lancaster.

Henry later served in many positions of public responsibility, including Assistant Commissary General to the Continental Army for the district of Lancaster and, in 1779, Commissary of Hides for Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland. In these positions, Henry managed vast sums of money and acquired and transferred enormous amounts of material. (He was no longer producing guns, but he did acquire them—along with shoes, hats, flour—to supply them to state and continental troops.) In 1780 Henry informed Joseph Reed that he had &quot;laid out…between Sixty &amp; Seventy Thousand Pound&quot; just to &quot;purchase Leather and Paying Workmens Wages at the Shoe-Factory[s]&quot; he had established &quot;at Philadelphia, Allentown and Lancaster.&quot; His correspondence is filled with letters from Army leaders, including George Washington, begging for arms and other materials. Henry was the Treasurer of Lancaster Country for many years, a position filled by his wife, Ann Wood Henry, after Henry&#x27;s death in 1786.

Henry was an intellectual who helped found Lancaster&#x27;s Juliana Library-Company in 1759, which during the Revolution and after was housed in his residence, and he held membership in the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, whose first &quot;Transactions&quot; (1771) printed Henry&#x27;s account of his invention of a &quot;Description of a Self-Moving or Sentinel Register&quot; to regulate the flue of a furnace. Henry invented a screw auger, manufactured and sold exclusively at his Lancaster store, and some credit him with inventing the steamboat: the twelve-year-old Robert Fulton, a Lancaster neighbor, visited Henry in 1777, who had been experimenting since 1763 on boats with steam engines on the Conestoga River (Fulton&#x27;s own experiments began only in 1786 in England). Henry and his family were members of the Moravian Congregation at Lancaster.

Henry was the earliest patron of painter Benjamin West, who lodged in Henry&#x27;s home in Lancaster in 1756 and painted portraits of William and Ann Henry, probably shortly after their marriage. More significantly, Henry encouraged West to paint &quot;The Death of Socrates&quot; (1756), perhaps the first history painting produced in the colonies; West credited Henry with having initiated the painter&#x27;s interest in history painting, the genre for which the painter became famous.

==Legacy==
Henry&#x27;s sons carried on his gun business, in Lancaster, in Philadelphia, in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, and then in Boulton, PA. One of his sons, John Joseph Henry, served as a sixteen-year-old rifleman on Benedict Arnold&#x27;s march on Quebec in the fall and winter of 1775 (he was captured and imprisoned for much of 1776), and later served as president judge of the second District in Pennsylvania from 1795–1811.

<text>A door handle or doorknob is a handle used to open or close a door. Door handles can be found on all types of doors including: exterior doors of residential and commercial buildings, internal doors, cupboard doors and vehicle doors. There are many designs of door handle, depending on the appropriate use. A large number of handles, particularly for commercial and residential doors, incorporate latching or locking mechanisms or are manufactured to fit to standardised door locking or latching mechanisms.

The most common types of door handle are the lever handle and the doorknob. Door handles can be made out of a plethora of materials. Examples include brass, porcelain, cut glass, wood, and bronze. Door handles have been in existence for at least 5000 years, and its design has evolved since, with more advanced mechanism, types, and designs made.

Some door handles are also arm- or foot-operated to reduce transmission of contagious illnesses.

==Types==

*The most common type of door handle is the &quot;Lever latch&quot; or &quot;Latch&quot; door handle on a backplate found in residential houses and commercial and public buildings. Doors fitted with this handle have a latch that keeps the door shut. The door handle has only a lever handle or knob which operates this latch. Pushing the handle down rotates the spindle, operating the tubular latch mechanism inside the door, allowing it to be opened. This type of door handle is used on interior doors that do not require to be locked. The lever latch handle is easy to install and use, and is available in a variety of styles and finishes. The doorknob has a spindle running through it that sits just above a cylinder, to which the spindle is connected. Pushing the lever or turning the knob pulls the cylinder in the direction of the turn. The end of the cylinder is the &quot;latch bolt&quot; (more simply known as the &quot;latch&quot;), which protrudes into a space carved out of the door frame, and which prevents the door from being opened if the knob is not turned. A spring or similar mechanism causes the latch to return to its protruding state whenever the knob is not being turned. 
*The Lever lock door handle on a backplate is another type of door handle which operates similarly to the lever latch door handle. This type of handle on a backplate consists of a lever with a keyhole cut just below it. This allows a key to be inserted into the door to control a mortice sash lock. Just the like the lever latch, the door can be opened and shut by pushing the handle, but it can also be locked with a key. This locking mechanism is used on doors which can be opened by turning the handle if not locked, but can also be locked, requiring a key to open them.
*The Lever Bathroom is typically used on bathroom doors as they can be locked and unlocked easily from the inside by turning the snib, but in an emergency can be opened from the outside by fitting a coin or similar object into a slot and rotating it. This lock is fitted with a mortice sash with the attached to a 5mm spindle which passes through the door.
*The Lever Privacy is functionally similar to the Lever Bathroom in that it is locked by turning a snib on the inside and can be unlocked from the outside in emergencies. Unlike the Lever Bathroom, there is no mortice sash; locking is achieved by jamming the lever in a closed position.
* Pull door handles or simply Pull handles are U-shaped, and are used especially in the kitchen but also for drawers. Usually made of stainless steel.

== History ==
Door handles have been in existence at least since the Neolithic period. 
Locking or latching mechanisms have existed from about the same time. Key operated door locks have existed at least since Egyptian civilisation. The keys of these locks, which could be as large as two feet long, also functioned as door handles to slide a locking bolt and open the door. Subsequently Roman domuses and insulae incorporated lockable doors of a different design but also opened by a combined handle/key. Although available, these key lockable doors were relatively rare. Houses were almost always occupied so most lockable doors would feature a sliding bolt or a drop-in bar that allowed the building to be locked from the inside. The bolt or bar bracket acted as a handle. Although interior doors were less common in Rome than in modern buildings, the Romans had recognisably modern interior doors including door handles. Doors excavated from Lake Nemi and dated to around 1st century CE feature knob-shaped handles.

In Asia, China by the 4th century CE was producing a range of automated doors, door locks and door bars.

There is little record of door handle development between the Fall of Rome and about 1000 CE. The oldest European doors include the Bernward Doors and the Westminster Abbey door. The Bernward doors have large decorative ring-shaped handles of a type that became common on decorated doors from that period onwards. The Westminster Abbey door features a sliding bolt that can also function as a handle. From at least the Middle Ages blacksmiths made drop latches which could be opened by a handle connected to the latch by a split pin passing through the door. Taking the form of a ring or strip, these handles could be elaborate and decorated but were universally made of metal. It can be speculated that since the task of making door hardware fell to the blacksmith, the use of turned or carved wooden knobs was not convenient. Wooden latches are also known from this period. A finger hole could be made that allowed the user to raise the latch from the other side of the door. The finger hole would double as a grip or handle. In another common design, transferred motion to open the latch was effected by a string passing through the door, which could be withdrawn from the inside to effectively lock the door to outsiders. In this case the door might also have a basic handle carved or turned from wood.

From about mid-17th century, drop handles were increasingly replaced by forged vertical handles formed as a bracket fixed to the door at the top and bottom of the bracket. Vertical handles with an incorporated latch mechanism, known as Suffolk latches were developed. By the mid-18th century, forged vertical handles were being replaced by cast vertical handles, including the Norfolk latch.
The early 17th century also saw metalworking of a standard that allowed mortise locks and latches and compact rim locks and latches to be made for use in the most expensive buildings. These locks used a twisting motion to operate, accelerating development in decorative doorknobs. The Industrial Revolution dramatically reduced the cost of lock and latch manufacture with lock designers including Barronin, Chubb and Bramah competing against each other around the end of the 18th century. From the 18th century, a wide variety of lever handles and knobs started to be produced, with designs determined by local aesthetic preference and technology. Knobs could be cast, turned, brazed or spun from a variety of materials. Levers could be wrought or cast. Designs became more complicated and might include a rose or escutcheon plate.

Until about 1830 door handle manufacture in the western world was almost entirely European. In 1838 the US was importing between 80 and 95% of its door handles. Between 1830 and 1876, the date of the Centennial Exposition, door handle manufacture grew rapidly in the US; more than 100 patents were filed for door handle and doorknob improvements in that time. This period also saw glass doorknobs appear as a major part of the industry thanks to improvements in the pressed glass manufacturing process. Cut glass knobs were also popular from the time of the Centennial Exposition to about 1910.

From the early 20th century architects and designers started to take serious interest in door handles as part of a comprehensive vision of spaces for living. In 1927 Wittgenstein famously designed a door handle which has become a prototype for curved tubular handles since then. Emerson wrote of handles in his &quot;The American Scholar&quot; address. Peter Behrens, Walter Gropius and Antoni Gaudi all produced handle designs, many of which continue to be manufactured.

While aesthetic design, cost of manufacture and functionality remain primary drivers of door handle design, the 21st century has seen additional considerations introduced. In particular, considerations of infection control {see section below} and accessibility have become increasingly important since around 2000. The Coronavirus pandemic has contributed to a rapid development of new handle designs including foot-operated handles and handles that can be operated by the user&#x27;s forearm.

== Escutcheon plate ==
Escutcheon plates, also known as back plates, are used behind door handles, drawer pulls, surrounding keyholes and separate locks, and other similar purposes. These may be plain or fancy, embellished in any form, and serve variously to protect surrounding surfaces, conceal (and render tamperproof) important attachment fasteners, cover uneven rough openings, and add a decorative flourish.

The plate on the edge of a door (where a bolt or door plunger protrudes) is called the &quot;faceplate&quot;; opposite on the jamb is the &quot;latchplate&quot;, creating or reinforcing the hole receiving a latch, bolt, or plunger.

==Usage==
The location of the door handle along the horizontal axis on the door can vary between a few inches or centimeters away from the edge of the door to the exact center of the door, depending on local culture, decorative style, or owner preference. The distance from the edge of the door to the center of the handle is called the backset.

The location of the door handle along the vertical axis on the door may vary between .

Doorknobs can be difficult for the young and elderly to operate. For this reason, door handles in most American commercial and industrial buildings and in many households are lever-operated, rather than a knob, as the lever does not require a tight grip. Levers are also beneficial on doors with narrow stile widths where the reduced backset leaves insufficient space to comfortably turn a doorknob.

Most household door handles use a simple mechanism with a screw-style axle (called a spindle) that has at least one flat side, which is passed through the door jigger, leaving some length exposed on each side of the door to which the handles are attached. Some handles are attached on both sides by screwing or sliding them directly onto the spindle, and then securing one or more retaining screws (set screws) through the knob perpendicular to the flat of the spindle. Handles that lose traction can frequently be repaired by replacing or adjusting the set screw, which prevents them from slipping on the spindle. Other types of handles, typically used in Europe, slide onto the spindle but are affixed only to the door itself without use of set screws.

Types of household handles:
* Entrance: These door handles are typically used on exterior doors, and include keyed cylinders.
* Privacy: Typically used on bedrooms and bathrooms; while they are lockable (unlockable with a generic tool), they do not have keyed cylinders.
* Passage: Also known as hall or closet, these do not lock and are used in hall or closet doors.
* Dummy: These types are used for ball catch doors or other applications where a mechanism is not needed, but a similar aesthetic effect is desired.

===Cars===
Car door handles may protrude from the vehicle&#x27;s exterior surface or be streamlined into the vehicle&#x27;s contour (as in a Tesla, for example). In some automobiles, especially luxury vehicles, the door handles may feature a key-less entry pad utilizing either a numerical code, thumb scan or face recognition.

==Foldables==
On a balcony whose door has an outside shutter, a special door handle is used on the outer side. The protruding part of such handle (usually ring-shaped) can be folded sideways, so that the shutter can be fully closed without being obstructed by the door handle. These doors are referenced in pop culture such as &quot;Interstellar&quot; and &quot;A Dolphin Tale,&quot; as they are culturally significant in certain regions of the world. 

==Pocket doors==
A pocket door handle is a recessed rectangular insert, typically with operating hardware called a door pull.

Door handles can also be called &quot;handle sets&quot;. In addition there are door handles that are flush-mount and require pressing rather than turning or gripping, and there are touch-free, electronic, and motion-sensor door handles.

==Infection control==
Door handles play a role in the spread of some infections. Infection transmission can occur when an individual touches a handle and subsequently touches their eyes, nose or mouth. However, some materials, e.g. brass, copper and silver, are slowly poisonous to many germs. The exact mechanism is not known, but is commonly thought to be via the oligodynamic effect, perhaps by some other electrostatic effect. Brass and copper, for example, disinfect themselves of many door handle bacteria within eight hours. Other materials such as glass, porcelain, stainless steel and aluminium do not have this effect.
To avoid hand contact, some door handles are designed to be operated by the arm or foot.

== Collecting ==
The Antique Doorknob Collectors of America (ADCA) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the collection of antique doorknobs. Established in 1981, they have over 1000 members as of 2018. The doorknob collecting hobby was kick-started after the publication of &quot;The Antique Doorknob&quot; by Maud Eastwood in 1976.

<doc id="1205358" wikidata="Q922737" url="?curid=1205358" title="Postage due">
<text>Postage due is the term used for mail sent with insufficient postage. A postage due stamp is a stamp added to an underpaid piece of mail to indicate the extra postage due.

== Background ==
While the problem of what to do about letters not paying the full correct fee had existed since the creation of regular postal systems, it was greatly heightened by the advent of postage stamps, since customers were now making their own decisions about the right amount to pay, without the assistance of a presumably knowledgeable postal clerk.

While at various times some countries have simply adopted the expedient of returning the letter to the sender, many others have taken the approach of delivering the letter and collecting the fee from the recipient. Initially the process was handled by a clerk writing something like &quot;Due 3 cents&quot; on the cover, but this was subject to abuse by mail carriers, who might write this message themselves and pocket the difference.
The problem of underpaid foreign mail was one of the issues addressed by the 1874 establishment of the Universal Postal Union. The U.P.U. arrived at the decision that mail with insufficient postage should be marked with a &quot;T&quot; and from April 1, 1879 the amount missing would also be indicated in black. Later more countries started to use handstamps to indicate the amount due. Later the combination of handstamps with both the &quot;T&quot; and the amount missing came into use. From October 1, 1907 the rules were changed. The amount to be charged instead of the amount missing would be indicated. The amount charged was usually double the amount that was missing.

== First stamps ==
The problem was solved by France in 1859, with the issuance of official postage due stamps, affixed at the delivery office before being taken out to the recipients. Many other countries followed suit. (Occasionally, regular postage stamps have been used to fulfill a postage due function.)

Postage due stamps (or &quot;labels&quot;, to clarify that they have no value of their own) are not always affixed to individual letters; in the case of business mail, the total due might be summed, and the appropriate stamps added to the top letter in a bundle, or to a bundle&#x27;s wrapper. The labels have also been used to collect money for other purposes, such as magazine subscriptions.

Since postage due stamps are almost always used only within a single country, they are usually quite simple in design, mostly consisting of a large numeral, and an inscription saying &quot;postage due&quot;, &quot;porto&quot;, etc.; often there is no country name. As with definitive stamps, a variety of values are needed to make up specific amounts.

== Decline in use ==
A number of countries have discontinued postage due stamps. Britain, which first issued theirs in 1914 (and continued the same design until 1970), ended their use in 2000. The United States terminated them in 1986, although postage meter labels were used after that date.

==In stamp collecting==

While, technically, there is no reason for postage dues to reach private hands unused, postal administrations have sold them to collectors, and postage dues of many countries exist in large numbers, often unused and of low value. Conversely, surviving examples of valid postally used postage due stamps tied together by a dated cancellation or other postal markings with a postage stamp on cover are less common and are sought after by philatelists.

He is also a regular contributor to &quot;CounterPunch&quot;. 

Alam is a critic of Zionism and Israel, which he does not believe has a right to exist. He is a supporter of the boycott of Israel movement, and wrote in a column for &quot;CounterPunch&quot; in 2002, &quot;The Academic Boycott of Israel,&quot; that &quot;resistance to the colonizer must be violent.&quot;

In 2004 a column of Alam&#x27;s, &quot;America and Islam, Seeking Parallels&quot; made an analogy between the September 11 attacks, which he called an Islamic insurgency, and the American Revolution, attracting controversy and criticism from right-wing critics such as David Horowitz and Daniel Pipes, who appeared on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; to attack Alam, and Alam received death threats.

<text>Chicago History Museum is the museum of the Chicago Historical Society (CHS). The CHS was founded in 1856 to study and interpret Chicago&#x27;s history. The museum has been located in Lincoln Park since the 1930s at 1601 North Clark Street at the intersection of North Avenue in the Old Town Triangle neighborhood, where the museum has been expanded several times. Long known as the CHS, the society adopted the name, &quot;Chicago History Museum&quot;, in September 2006 for its public presence.

==History==
Much of the Chicago Historical Society&#x27;s first collection was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, but the museum rose from the ashes like the city. Among its many documents which were lost in the fire was Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s final draft of the Emancipation Proclamation. (This draft had been donated by Lincoln to nurse Mary Livermore for her to auction to raise funds to build Chicago&#x27;s Civil War Soldiers&#x27; Home) After the fire, the Society began collecting new materials, which were stored in a building owned by J. Young Scammon, a prominent lawyer and member of the society. However, the building and the new collection were again destroyed by fire in 1874. The Chicago Historical Society built a fireproof building on its pre-1871 building-site at 632 North Dearborn Street. The replacement building opened in 1896 and housed the society for thirty-six years. The building was later added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Old Chicago Historical Society Building.
Charles F. Gunther, a prominent Chicago collector, donated some items to the historical society. In 1920, the society purchased the remainder of the large historical collection from his estate, with the intention of changing its focus from merely a research institution to a public museum. Many of the items in Gunther&#x27;s collection, in addition to being related to Chicago, were related to Abraham Lincoln and the American Civil War. These include Lincoln&#x27;s deathbed, several other pieces of furniture from the room where he died in the Petersen House, and clothing that he and his wife Mary Todd Lincoln allegedly wore the evening of his assassination. The collection also contains the table on which General Robert E. Lee signed his 1865 surrender to General Ulysses S. Grant, an official act that ended the American Civil War, at the McLean House in Appomattox, Virginia.

In 2010, the museum was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame.

==Building==

After 36 years in the Henry Ives Cobb structure on North Dearborn Street, the museum and library moved to the current complex in Lincoln Park. The oldest part of the museum, designed by Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White, was built in 1932 by the WPA, with the aim of creating expanded public exhibition space.
The 1932 Federal-style structure has been expanded twice. The first addition, clad in limestone, opened in 1972 and was designed by Alfred Shaw and Associates. The second addition, designed by Holabird and Root, was done in 1988 and included refacing the earlier expansion in red brick to give a unified look to all three portions of the building. Both expansions occurred on the west side of the 1932 structure, leaving intact its original porticoed entrance facing Lincoln Park. The main entrance and reception hall, however, were moved to the new western addition facing Clark street. The modernist 1988 extension, in addition to expanded exhibition galleries, also contains the museum&#x27;s store and public cafe.

==Activities==
The museum explores both Chicago and American history. Exhibitions draw primarily on the museum&#x27;s own collection, which numbers approximately 22 million holdings. &quot;Chicago: Crossroads of America&quot; is a 16,000-square-foot space that explores the city&#x27;s development and its relationship to and influence on American history. Nearly 600 objects document the people and events of the past 200 years. &quot;Facing Freedom&quot; focuses on eight American conflicts over freedom from the 1850s to the 1970s. The Abraham Lincoln alcoves highlight the sixteenth president&#x27;s election, his leadership during the Civil War, and his assassination. The adjoining Portrait Gallery features an installation on Chicago during the time of Lincoln. The &quot;Sensing Chicago&quot; exhibition invites children to use their senses to discover the past. The lobby displays various museum treasures. The newly restored dioramas are housed in the Tawani Foundation Diorama Hall. The Chicago dioramas feature Chicago&#x27;s rise from a desolate frontier outpost to the bustling city that hosted the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893. The Chicago Room, which overlooks the plaza in Lincoln Park behind the museum building, displays a collection of stained glass and is available to rent for corporate events, meetings or wedding receptions.

Temporary exhibitions feature objects and artifacts from the collection, covering everything from Chicago art to the history of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Chicagoans to the city&#x27;s fashion history. On October 14, 2013, the Chicago History Museum announced a project asking the public to furnish ideas for a future exhibition and reducing the most-often-submitted ideas to one assignment through a series of public votes. According to the American Alliance of Museums, this is the first crowdsourcing project allowing the public to give an exhibition assignment to an American museum.

On January 19, 2006, the first passenger car to operate on the Chicago &#x27;L&#x27; system in 1893 was transported to its new display location at the Chicago History Museum. Passengers could ride the 1893 &#x27;L&#x27; from the Loop to Hyde Park station for 5 cents to attend the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition upon the line&#x27;s opening. The vehicle, known as L Car #1, was cosmetically restored to its 1893 appearance before being transported to the museum where it was lifted into an opening created through a wall on the museum&#x27;s second floor. The car&#x27;s interior features include mahogany and rattan seats and etched glass windows. The L car joined the &quot;Pioneer&quot;, the first locomotive to operate in Chicago; a redesigned exhibition space to showcase the car and locomotive opened on September 30, 2006, as part of a larger remodeling project.

The museum houses Chicago&#x27;s most important collection of materials related to local history. The extensive research library includes books and other published materials, manuscripts, paintings, sculptures, and photos. It is open to the public, including students working on school projects. The costume collection numbers more than 50,000 pieces and dates from the 18th century to the present. It contains numerous couture pieces, items created by well-known Chicago manufacturers and designers, and garments worn by notable residents.

The museum offers a variety of programs, publications, and online resources related to Chicago and American history. This includes print and online editions of its collaborative effort the &quot;Encyclopedia of Chicago&quot;. The museum&#x27;s Chicago Fire mobile app has content equivalent to a 400-page book with more than 350 illustrations, drawn from the museum&#x27;s collection. The app also offers of 10 distinct Chicago areas and 54 fire-related landmarks. The app uses GPS guidance that helps the user view photos of nearby sites from the era of the Great Chicago Fire. The museum also publishes &quot;Chicago History&quot; magazine. Written by historians and heavily illustrated, this publication focuses on Chicago&#x27;s complex past and the people who have shaped it. Additionally, more than 50,000 images from its collection have been digitized as part of Explore Chicago Collections.

Every year, the Chicago History Museum recognizes important Chicagoans and Chicago organizations with its Making History Awards.

<text>Melvin Sokoloff (May 10, 1929 – February 2, 1990), known professionally as Mel Lewis, was an American jazz drummer, session musician, professor, and author. He received fourteen Grammy Award nominations.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Lewis was born in Buffalo, New York, to Russian-Jewish immigrant parents Samuel and Mildred Sokoloff. He started playing professionally as a teen, eventually joining Stan Kenton in 1954. His musical career brought him to Los Angeles in 1957 and New York City in 1963.

===Career===
In 1966 in New York, he teamed up with Thad Jones to lead the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra. The group started as informal jam sessions with the top studio and jazz musicians of the city, but eventually began performing regularly on Monday nights at the famed venue, the Village Vanguard. In 1979, the band won a Grammy for their album &quot;Live in Munich&quot;. Like all of the musicians in the band, it was only a sideline. In 1976, he released an album titled &quot;Mel Lewis and Friends&quot; that featured him leading a smaller sextet that allowed freedom and improvisation.

When Jones moved to Denmark in 1978, the band became known as Mel Lewis and the Jazz Orchestra. Lewis continued to lead the band, recording and performing every Monday night at the Village Vanguard until shortly before his death from cancer at age 60. The band still performs on most Monday nights at the club. Today, it is known as the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra and has released several CDs.

==Playing style and approach==
Lewis&#x27;s cymbal work was considered unique among many musicians. Of his style, drummer Buddy Rich had remarked: &quot;Mel Lewis doesn&#x27;t sound like anybody else. He sounds like himself.&quot;

Lewis insisted on playing genuine Turkish-made cymbals, switching from the Zildjian Company later in his career to the Istanbul brand. His setup included a 21-inch ride on his right, a 19-inch crash-ride on his left, and his signature sound, a 22-inch swish &quot;knocker&quot; with rivets on his far right. The rather lightweight cymbals exuded a dark, overtone-rich sound. Lewis&#x27; wood-shell drums were considered warm and rich in their sound. He almost exclusively played a Gretsch drums set, although in later years, played Slingerland drums equipped with natural calfskin top heads. Regular mylar heads were used on the bottom. Lewis described a playing philosophy of not &quot;pushing or pulling&quot; but &quot;supporting.&quot; &quot;If you watch me, it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m doing much,&quot; he remarked in an interview.

==Declining health and death==
In the late 1980s, Lewis was diagnosed with melanoma. It was identified in his arm, then surfaced in his lungs, and ultimately went to his brain. He died on February 2, 1990, just days before his band was to celebrate its 24th anniversary at the Village Vanguard.

<text>William Henry (28 June 1859 – 20 March 1928), born Joseph Nawrocki, was an English competitive swimmer and lifesaver who represented Great Britain in international competition.
==Biography==
He was of Polish ancestry, and changed his original Polish surname Nawrocki to the English &quot;Henry&quot;. He was a co-founder of the Royal Life Saving Society. As a swimmer he won a number of national and European championships. In 1906, at 46, he became the oldest ever Olympic medal winner in swimming as a member of the British men&#x27;s 4×250-metre relay team which won the bronze medal. He won a gold medal in the 1900 Summer Olympics for Water Polo.

Henry is an International Swimming Hall of Fame inductee. He was the swimming instructor for the British royal family, using the swimming pool at the Bath Club, Dover Street. He helped to formalise the rules of water polo. With Archibald Sinclair (1866–1922), he wrote a book on swimming for the Badminton Library.

==Death==
He died in the St Pancras district of London, aged 68. He was buried with his wife Elizabeth at Highgate Cemetery, with a memorial above the grave paid for by members and friends of the Royal Life Saving Society.

<doc id="1205390" wikidata="Q3395446" url="?curid=1205390" title="Daniel Owen">
<text>Daniel Owen (20 October 1836 – 22 October 1895) was a Welsh novelist. He is generally regarded as the foremost Welsh-language novelist of the 19th century and the first significant novelist to write in Welsh.

==Early life==
Daniel Owen was born in Mold (Yr Wyddgrug), Flintshire, the youngest of six children in a working-class family. His father, Robert Owen, was a coal miner, while his mother belonged to the family of Thomas Edwards, poet and writer. His father and his two brothers, James and Robert, were killed on 10 May 1837 when the Argoed mine became flooded. The loss impacted heavily on the family, who remained in poverty. Owen received little formal education, but he acknowledged his debt to his Sunday School.

Owen, aged 12, was apprenticed to a tailor, Angel Jones, an elder in the Calvinistic Methodist Church. Owen described his apprenticeship as a &quot;kind of college&quot;, and began writing poetry under the influence of a colleague there. Owen found chances to discuss and argue topics with colleagues and customers there.

==Early writings==
Owen began writing poetry under the pseudonym &quot;Glaslwyn&quot;, entering his work into local eisteddfodau and managed to publish some pieces. His first significant work in Welsh was a translation of Timothy Shay Arthur&#x27;s novelette &quot;Ten Nights in a Bar-Room and What I Saw There&quot;. This came out fortnightly in the Methodist journal &quot;Charles o&#x27;r Bala&quot;. Owen then trained unsuccessfully for the ministry of his church, preaching from 1860. He enrolled in Bala Theological College in 1865, but failed to complete the course. From 1867 until the end of his life, he worked as a tailor in Mold, preaching on Sundays until prevented by illness.

Later his mentor, Roger Edwards, suggested he try his hand at writing instead. Owen&#x27;s first attempt at fiction was a short story, &quot;Cymeriadau Methodistaidd&quot; (&quot;Methodist Characters&quot;) about the election of chapel elders. Its modest success led Edwards to encourage Owen to embark on a first novel, &quot;Y Dreflan&quot;, which described a fictionalized version of Mold.

==Mature work==
Although &quot;Y Dreflan&quot; was popular in its time, Owen&#x27;s reputation rests mainly on three later novels, particularly &quot;Rhys Lewis&quot; and its sequel &quot;Enoc Huws&quot;. There he again explored a fictionalized version of Mold and its Methodist chapel culture, blending comedy with satire and psychological introspection. His work has been compared with that of Charles Dickens, who was a likely influence, although Owen&#x27;s work is uniquely informed by his own Welsh-language culture and chapel background.

==List of works==
*&quot;Deng Noswaith Yn y `Black Lion`&quot; (1859)
*&quot;Offrymau Neilltuaeth&quot; (1879)
*&quot;Y Dreflan&quot; (1881)
*&quot;Rhys Lewis&quot; (1885)
*&quot;Y Siswrn&quot; (1886)
*&quot;Enoc Huws&quot; (1891)
*&quot;Gwen Tomos&quot; (1894)
*&quot;Straeon y Pentan&quot; (short stories) (1895)

==Legacy==
Although not the first to write novels in Welsh, Owen is the earliest Welsh-language novelist still widely read. He is credited with starting a tradition of novel-writing in Welsh that influenced later fiction writers such as Kate Roberts and T. Rowland Hughes.

Owen is commemorated in Mold by a statue and the name of a shopping precinct and cultural centre. He is also remembered in the Daniel Owen Memorial Prize (Gwobr Goffa Daniel Owen), awarded at the National Eisteddfod since 1978, whenever there are entries of high enough quality, for the best unpublished novel of no less than 50,000 words with a strong story. Mold also centres an annual cultural festival on Owen&#x27;s life and works.

<text>William Albert Henry (November 10, 1914 – August 10, 1982) was an American actor who worked in both films and television.

==Biography==

Born in Los Angeles, California, Henry started as a child actor, then was a hero in B-movies (mainly westerns), and ended his career as a character actor. He appeared in various roles on episodes of many television series. He was a member of the John Ford Stock Company and appeared twelve times for Ford. He also appeared in John Wayne&#x27;s &quot;The Alamo&quot; (1960); in this version of the famous siege, Henry&#x27;s character, Dr. Sutherland, is the last of the defenders to be killed.

Henry was active with the Pasadena Community Playhouse.

In 1952, Henry was cast as the San Francisco lawyer Lew Barry in the episode, &quot;Self Made Man,&quot; of the syndicated television anthology series, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Stanley Andrews.

Bill guest starred twice in Gene Barry&#x27;s TV Western &quot;Bat Masterson&quot;, once in 1958 as crooked &quot;Sheriff Griff Hanley&quot; (S1E7&#x27;s &quot;A Noose Fits Anyone&quot;) and again in 1960 as stalwart &quot;Sheriff Brady&quot; (S2E23&#x27;s &quot;The Snare&quot;).

Henry&#x27;s brother was the character actor Thomas Browne Henry.

Henry was married and twice divorced. His first marriage was to Grace Durkin, with whom he had a son, Michael, and a daughter, Michele. He and his second wife, Barbara Knudson, were the parents of William &quot;Bill&quot; Henry, Jr. (b. 1958).

<text>Mykola Ivanovych Melnychenko (born October 18, 1966) was a bodyguard of Ukrainian former president Leonid Kuchma. He is also an officer of the State Security Administration of Ukraine.

Between 1998 and 2000, Melnychenko allegedly recorded numerous conversations that took place in Kuchma&#x27;s office before fleeing abroad with the secretly taped recordings. The publication of these recordings in 2000 caused a major scandal in Ukraine (known as the Cassette Scandal), which dramatically affected the country&#x27;s domestic and foreign policy. Melnychenko&#x27;s principal accusations against Kuchma (supposedly confirmed by the recordings) are the ordering of the kidnapping and murder of journalist Georgiy Gongadze. The United States government became involved after one of the records revealed the alleged transfer of an advanced Ukrainian radar system &quot;Kolchuha&quot; to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq. Hundreds of other allegations are based on the recordings.

==Biography==
Mykola Melnychenko was born in the village of Zapadynka, Kyiv Oblast (now outskirt of Vasylkiv) to a family of coal miners moved from Horlivka, eastern Ukraine. He graduated from the in Kyiv and became a KGB communications protection expert. In 1992, soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Melnychenko started his career in Ukraine&#x27;s State Security Administration (formerly the 9th Directorate of the Committee for State Security (KGB)). Later, he joined President Leonid Kuchma&#x27;s team of bodyguards and at the time of the scandal, Melnychenko held the rank of Major. His main duty was to protect the President&#x27;s office against possible eavesdropping.

Melnychenko is divorced with one daughter.

== The &#x27;Cassette Scandal&#x27; ==

On November 28, 2000, Ukrainian politician Oleksandr Moroz publicly accused President Kuchma of involvement in the murder of Gongadze, naming Melnychenko as the source of information and playing selected recordings to journalists, starting the &#x27;Cassette Scandal&#x27;. Days earlier Melnychenko had fled Ukraine to Ostrava in the Czech Republic, where he left several bags containing dozens of CDs storing thousands of digital recordings. Melnychenko left Ukraine covertly with his family, breaking an official prohibition on leaving the country.

Melnychenko claimed that he acted alone when recording the President&#x27;s conversations and then publishing them abroad. According to Melnychenko, he put an amateur digital dictaphone under a sofa in Kuchma&#x27;s office and was changing it every time he inspected the room. As the Major states, he was motivated purely by his disillusionment with what he perceived as the extremely corrupt nature of Kuchma&#x27;s regime and &quot;decided to document evidences of crimes&quot; committed by the President. After the disappearance of Georgiy Gongadze, he supposedly decided to publish the recordings and protect his life. Then Melnychenko turned to his political sympathizer Oleksander Moroz for help, and received it.

Later, Melnychenko moved to the United States and received political asylum there. His tapes were eventually made available to the United States intelligence services and examined to determine their authenticity and content. The authenticity of the whole file of tapes remains officially unconfirmed. However, U.S. forensic experts have officially analyzed the section of tapes concerning Iraq issues and found it authentic.

The Ukrainian authorities have issued an international search warrant for Melnychenko, claiming that he is an &#x27;important witness&#x27; and possible traitor of state secrets. However, no evidence of forced return or assassination efforts against Melnychenko were made public.

Many experts and journalists find Melnychenko&#x27;s story highly questionable. In particular, they argue that:

* It is not clear why or how exactly Melnychenko started the operation. Being a career tech agent, he has never been involved in any kind of intelligence, analysis or criminal investigation. Thus, he was unlikely to have information on the President&#x27;s committing judicially proven crimes.
* The means of recording described by Melnychenko seems odd, both in technical and operative terms. Indeed, it is impossible to record about 500 hours of conversations by simply changing amateur dictaphone once a day. Melnychenko&#x27;s former commanding officers argue that even a very small device would be easily discovered during routine searches of the room conducted by several agents.
* The original device(s) used for recording, as well as the full file of recordings, have never been presented to journalists or Ukrainian prosecutors. Besides, Melnychenko should have known that a recording copied from digital recorder will not be found authentic, making the whole idea of &quot;documenting evidences&quot; a nonsense.

Nevertheless, experts and politicians analyzing the recordings agree that at least some of them are real, judging by known voices, speaking manners and confidential details mentioned. A few politicians, including Kuchma himself, have officially claimed they recognize their own voices on the tapes. However, the President and his supporters have always denied the authenticity of the body of conversations recorded, calling them a &quot;montage&quot;. On the other hand, in 2002 Bruce Koenig, of the US forensic firm Bek Tek, a former worker in the FBI&#x27;s forensic laboratory, examined the recordings and concluded that there were no signs of them having been doctored.

==Events following the scandal==
After he received asylum, Melnychenko started to become actively involved in Ukraine&#x27;s politics and foreign relations, making comments for media and writing books based on his records.

In 2004, Volodymyr Tsvil, a Ukrainian businessman and former KGB officer who supposedly assisted Melnychenko in his escape and further accommodation in the West, publicly accused him of not revealing certain details of the case.

On March 1, 2005 the criminal case against Melnychenko for &quot;the disclosure of state secrets, abuse of office and using counterfeit documents&quot; was closed.

Melnychenko tried to run in the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election but was not registered as a candidate because he did not pay the mandatory election deposit of 2.5 million hryvnya.

On December 6, 2009 Melnychenko accused Volodymyr Lytvyn of ordering the murder of journalist Georgiy Gongadze in 2000. A spokesperson for Lytvyn dismissed the claims as part of the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election campaign.

On July 29, 2011 the criminal case against Melnychenko originally closed on March 1, 2005 was reopened. In October 2011 an arrest warrant against him was issued for &quot;evading investigation and preventing the establishment of truth&quot;. According to Ukrainian press Melnychenko was living in the United States at the time, while he claimed he was in Israel; he said he lived there because &quot;there was a plan to physically exterminate me&quot;. In late March 2010 the investigation into Melnychenko was suspended because his location had not been established (Melnychenko himself claimed he was living in the United States).

In October 2012, Melnychenko was briefly detained and then released by the law enforcement services of Ukraine.

<text>Charles Anderson-Pelham, 1st Earl of Yarborough (8 August 1781 – 5 September 1846), styled Hon. Charles Anderson-Pelham from 1794 to 1823, was one of the founders of the Royal Yacht Squadron and its first Commodore. He lived at Appuldurcombe House on the Isle of Wight, which had been inherited by his wife Henrietta from her uncle, Sir Richard Worsley. He died aboard his yacht at Vigo in Spain in 1846. There are two monuments to him: one at Culver Down on the Isle of Wight and Pelham&#x27;s Pillar at Caistor, Lincolnshire, England.

He was member of parliament (MP) for Great Grimsby from 1803 until his re-election in 1807 was overturned on petition in 1808, and for Lincolnshire from 1807 to 1823.

His younger son, Dudley Pelham, was a naval commander and politician.

FamilySearch maintains a collection of records, resources, and services designed to help people learn more about their family history. Facilitating the performance of Latter-day Saint ordinances for deceased relatives is another major aim of the organization. Although it requires user account registration, it offers free access to its resources and service online at FamilySearch.org. In addition, FamilySearch offers personal assistance at more than 6,400 FamilySearch centers in 140 countries, including the FamilySearch Library in Salt Lake City, Utah.
The Family Tree section allows user-generated content to be contributed to the genealogical database. , there are over 1.5 billion individuals in the tree and the historical records database contains over 5.7 billion digital images, including digitized books, digitized microfilm, and other digital records.

==History==

===Genealogical Society of Utah===
GSU, the predecessor of FamilySearch, was founded on 1 November 1894. Its purpose was to create a genealogical library to be used both by its members and other people, to share educational information about genealogy, and to gather genealogical records in order to perform religious ordinances for the dead. It was founded under the direction of Church leaders, when the First Presidency appointed Franklin D. Richards as the first president.

The society published the &quot;Utah Genealogical and Historical Magazine&quot; from 1910 to 1940.
The GSU began microfilming records of genealogical importance in 1938. In 1963, the microfilm collection was moved to the newly completed Granite Mountain Records Vault for long-term preservation.

In 1975, the GSU became the Church&#x27;s Genealogical Department, which later became the FHD. At that time, its head officer was renamed president from executive director, starting during Theodore M. Burton&#x27;s term. However, the title &quot;President of the Genealogical Society of Utah&quot; and other GSU titles were still used and bestowed upon department officers.

In 2000, the Church consolidated its Family History and Historical departments into the Family and Church History Department, and Richard E. Turley Jr. became managing director of the new department and president of the GSU. Later this decision was reversed and the Family History Department was separated from the Church History Department, becoming its own department.

In 2008, the Vatican issued a statement calling the practice known as baptism for the dead &quot;erroneous&quot; and directing Catholic dioceses to keep parish records from Latter-day Saints performing genealogical research.

====Presidents of the Genealogical Society of Utah====

===FamilySearch===
In 1998, the GSU began digital imaging of records and in about August 1998 the decision was made by Church leaders to build a genealogical website. In May 1999, the website first opened to the public as &quot;FamilySearch&quot;. The beta version, released April 1, almost immediately went offline, overloaded because of high popularity. Only a few days after the official launch, the website had received an estimated 100 million hits. To handle the load, site visitors were only given access to the site for 15 minutes at a time. In November 1999, 240 million names were added, bringing the total number of entries to 640 million.

In 2009, the Church launched a collaborative tree known as &quot;New FamilySearch&quot;. It was the precursor to the current &quot;FamilySearch Family Tree&quot;, and was only available to church members. The system was an attempt to combine multiple genealogical submissions to FamilySearch&#x27;s databases into one single tree, but it did not allow users to edit information that they had not submitted. It also was difficult to add sources to individuals in the tree or determine what was the correct information among multiple submissions. By April 2011, plans were in place to redesign the database into a more collaborative platform.

In 2011, the FamilySearch website received a major redesign. The previous site had allowed users to only search one database at a time, but the new version allowed sitewide searches of multiple databases. It also included the addition of more databases as well as some digitized and indexed microfilms.

On 16 November 2012, it was announced that the new Family Tree database would be available to all users of New FamilySearch, and that the New FamilySearch database would eventually be phased out. On 5 March 2013, it was announced that Family Tree would now be available to everyone, whether or not they were members of the Church.
On 16 April 2013, FamilySearch completely revamped the site design generally, with new features and a changed color scheme. Some of the new features include an interactive fan chart and some printing capabilities, as well as the ability to add photos to Family Tree.

In February 2014, FamilySearch announced partnerships with Ancestry.com, findmypast and MyHeritage, which includes sharing massive amounts of their databases with those companies, and members of the Church receiving free subscriptions with these companies. They also have a standing relationship with BillionGraves, in which the photographed and indexed images of graves are both searchable on FamilySearch and are linked to individuals in the family tree. At the end of 2015, FamilyTree had 1.1 billion persons added by 2.47 million contributors.

In August 2017, FamilySearch discontinued distribution of physical microfilm to its family history centers due to large-scale availability of digital images of those films and planned digitization of remaining films. In May 2018, FamilySearch added and digitized its 2 billionth record. In September 2020, FamilySearch announced that it now includes 8 billion names, 3.2 billion digital images, and 490,000 digital books, with over 1 million new records each day. 7 billion names from almost every country were added within the last 10 years.

==Activities==

===RootsTech===

Since 2011, FamilySearch International has organized an annual family history and technology conference called RootsTech. It is held annually in the Salt Palace Convention Center, Salt Lake City, Utah. The conference is attended by professional and amateur genealogists, technology developers, and members of the Church. In 2014 there were nearly 13,000 people in attendance. As of 2020, it is the world&#x27;s largest family history and technology conference in the world. It is the successor to three former conferences: the Conference on Computerized Family History and Genealogy, the Family History Technology Workshop and the FamilySearch Developers Conference.

==Website==
===Historical Records===
The main service of the FamilySearch website is to offer access to digital images and indexes of genealogical records. These images can be searched along with a number of databases. While access to the records is always free, some records have restricted access, and can only be viewed at a FamilySearch Center, at an Affiliate Library, or by members of the Church. FamilySearch.org also contains the catalog of the FamilySearch Library in Salt Lake City, Utah. The library holds genealogical records for over 110 countries, territories, and possessions, including over 2.4 million rolls of microfilmed genealogical records; 742,000 microfiche; 490,000 books, serials, and other formats; and 4,500 periodicals.

===FamilySearch Family Tree===
FamilySearch FamilyTree (FSFT) is a &quot;one world tree,&quot; or a unified database that aims to contain one entry for each person recorded in genealogical records. All FamilySearch users are able to add persons, link them to existing persons or merge duplicates. Sources, images, and audio files can also be attached to persons in the tree.

There are also several features specific to the membership of the Church, facilitating temple ordinance work. In keeping with an agreement with Jewish groups and to prevent abuse, performing ordinances for Holocaust victims or celebrities results in account suspension until the researcher proves a legitimate family connection to the subject of their search. FamilySearch allows users to input same-sex marriages or other unions.

===Indexing projects===
Searchable indexes of the records on FamilySearch are created by volunteers of the FamilySearch Indexing program. To ensure greater accuracy, each batch of records is indexed by an indexer and is then checked by a more experienced indexer. Indexing volunteers need not be members of the Church. FamilySearch is currently working with genealogical societies all around the world to index local projects.
At the end of 2010, 548 million vital records had been transcribed and made publicly available through the FamilySearch website. In April 2013, FamilySearch Indexing completed their goal to offer 1 billion indexed records online.

===Education===
FamilySearch offers free lessons on FamilySearch.org to help people learn how to find their ancestors. The topics range from basic research to training on specific record types and are designed for both beginners and experienced researchers. Most of the classes come from research consultants in the Family History Library in Salt Lake City, but FamilySearch is also collaborating with partners such as the Mid-Continent Public Library in Independence, Missouri, to record and post classes.

In 2007, it was decided to start a FamilySearch Research Wiki to help FamilySearch users and others researching genealogy and family history to find and share information on data sources and research tips. The first version of the wiki was built on the Plone wiki software product, but it was soon discovered that MediaWiki software was much more suitable, so in January 2008 it was moved to the MediaWiki platform. In the intervening years it was rolled out in other languages, and as of July 2014 it was available in 11 languages. The other language wikis are found via links at the bottom of the wiki homepage. The wiki in English had over 79,500 articles and over 150,000 registered users as of July 2014.

==Facilities==
===FamilySearch Library===
FamilySearch operates the FamilySearch Library in Salt Lake City, Utah. The library was built in 1985 as a successor to previous libraries run by the Genealogical Society of Utah. The library is open to the public and has a large collection of international genealogical materials, including microfilm, books, and digital materials. The library&#x27;s catalog and many of their digital materials are located at the FamilySearch website.

===Granite Mountain Records Vault===
FamilySearch stores copies of their records in a dry, environment-controlled facility built into Granite Mountain in Little Cottonwood Canyon, near Salt Lake City, Utah. The storage facility is known as the Granite Mountain Records Vault. The vault stores over 2.4 million rolls of microfilm and 1 million microfiches.

===FamilySearch Centers===

FamilySearch operates over 6,300 FamilySearch Centers in 140 countries around the world as of 2023. The centers are branches of the FamilySearch Library, often located in meetinghouses of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Their purpose is to help people with their genealogy and provide access to and help with genealogical materials and software provided by FamilySearch.

<doc id="1205423" wikidata="Q2077113" url="?curid=1205423" title="Hursley">
<text>Hursley is a village and civil parish in Hampshire, England with a population of around 900 in 2011. It is located roughly midway between Romsey and Winchester on the A3090. Besides the village the parish includes the hamlets of Standon and Pitt and the outlying settlement at Farley Chamberlayne.

==History==
===Prehistoric===
Earthworks dating from either the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age are located at Merdon Castle.

===12th to 17th century===
The earliest references to Hursley date from the late 12th century; Bishop of Winchester Henry de Blois built a manor house called Merdon Castle, within the parish, in 1138. In the 14th century the hundred of Buddlesgate expanded to include Hursley parish and surrounding dependencies. Hursley continued in the ownership of the Bishop of Winchester until 1552 when it was surrendered to King Edward VI.

The buildings had become ruinous by the 16th century, when Edward Vl granted the manor and park at Hursley to Sir Philip Hoby. Some remains, notably of a gatehouse, still stand, much overgrown, and wherelisted as a building at risk. In 2023 work was completed to have its loose stonework repointed and a layer of earth and grass added to its walls to protect it. Since then it has been removed from the at risk list A 400ft well was also made safe and capped at the scheduled monument. The works, costing nearly £300,000, were funded by the landowner and a £240,700 Historic England grant.

During the reign of Queen Mary the manor was briefly restored to the church but given back to the Hoby family by Elizabeth I.

The Hoby family sold the manor and castle to Thomas Clerke in 1600. The lodge and park at Hursley were leased separately at this time, but the two estates were brought together again in 1630 and sold in 1639 to Richard Major, High Sheriff of Hampshire for 1639–40.

===The Cromwells – 1643 to 1718===
The estate passed into the Cromwell family in 1643 when Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s son Richard married Dorothy Major, daughter of the owner, Richard Major.

Richard Cromwell lived with his wife in Hursley from 1649 until 1658 when he was proclaimed Lord Protector following the death of his father. This made Hursley briefly the country seat of the ruler of England. It was not to last however as Richard&#x27;s grip on power was weak, he was forced from office within months and by 1660 concerns for his safety forced Richard Cromwell to flee the country with Dorothy. They travelled first to France and then to other parts of Europe where Richard lived under an assumed name. Richard&#x27;s son Oliver Cromwell II (??-1705) took over the Hursley estate, and the tenants claimed their ancient rights and customs (including pasturage and felling trees) in a lengthy legal battle.

Richard returned to Hursley after Oliver died in 1705 and lived on as lord of the manor until he died in 1712 whereupon he was buried in the chancel of All Saints&#x27; Church, Hursley. Richard&#x27;s daughters sold Hursley estate to Sir William Heathcote in 1718 for £35,100.

===The Heathcotes – 1718 to 1888===

Heathcote, a baronet, was a successful merchant who moved to Hursley to take up the role of a country gentleman. Between the years of 1721 and 1724 he built a red brick Queen Anne style mansion (now known as Hursley House) on the site of the original hunting lodge.

William died in 1751 and the estate passed to his son, Sir Thomas Heathcote. About this time Hursley&#x27;s original medieval parish church was rebuilt in a Georgian style. Sir Thomas was married twice and had eight children.

When he died he was succeeded by the second Sir William. William&#x27;s son, also called Sir Thomas Heathcote, was a patron of the arts and modernised Hursley House, but was blamed by later Heathcotes for property blunders that eventually cost the family the estate.

William Heathcote, nephew to Thomas, became the fifth baronet in 1825. He extended Hursley House and also created Home Farm on the site of the old Merdon Castle. William was married twice, first to Caroline who bore him three sons and a daughter but died in 1835, and second to Selina in 1841 by whom he had another eight children.

In 1888 Selina Heathcote sold the estate after her husband&#x27;s death for £150,000 to Joseph William Baxendale, of the Pickfords family. He in turn sold it in 1902 to George Cooper, whose wife Mary was a wealthy American railways heiress. She carried out extensive development and redecoration work in 1902 to create the house that can be seen today. Sir George was created a baronet in 1905 and on his death in 1940 the house was requisitioned by the Ministry of Aircraft Production.

Hursley House is now occupied by IBM as part of IBM Hursley Laboratories. It is a Grade Two* Listed Building.

Cranbury Park, a Grade One Listed Building in the parish of Hursley, now the home of the Chamberlayne-Macdonald family, was, in his later years, the one-time home of Sir Isaac Newton.

The MP Paulet St John raised an obelisk monument at Farley Chamberlayne to honour a favourite horse.

===Other notable residents===
The Church of England theologian and poet John Keble was appointed Vicar of Hursley in 1835, rebuilt the church in 1848, and remained there until his death in 1866. Keble was Professor of Poetry at Oxford University from 1831 to 1841, and was the originator and subsequently one of the leaders of the Oxford Movement. Keble College, Oxford was founded in his memory. Keble is buried at All Saints&#x27; Church, Hursley.

There is a memorial in the church to Dennis George Wyldbore Hewitt VC (1897–1917), a recipient of the Victoria Cross in World War I.
==Present day==
IBM has a site at Hursley, centred on Hursley House, employing over 1500 people. It is nowadays primarily a software development laboratory, specialising in transaction and message processing (CICS, MQ), Information Management, and Java. Storage adapters and storage virtualisation products (SVC) are also developed on this site. It is also home to IBM&#x27;s Blockchain programme. In the past it was the development laboratory for several IBM 360 models and the first digital colour display, the IBM 3279 terminal. Hursley is crossed by the Monarch&#x27;s Way long distance footpath. Hursley Park Cricket Club play at The Quarters, with the ground hosting two List A matches for the Hampshire Cricket Board in 2002.

==Listed Buildings and Scheduled Ancient Monuments==
Of the currently 128 entries for Hursley in the Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest, St John&#x27;s Church, Farley Chamberlayne and Cranbury Park are Grade One, and All Saints&#x27; Church, Hursley, Hursley House (now usually known as Hursley Park) and Slackstead Manor are Grade Two* Listed Buildings, the remaining 123 entries being Grade Two. Additionally there are three Scheduled Ancient Monuments: Merdon Castle, a Camp west of Farley Mount and a Length of deer-park boundary bank, Hursley Park.

The tower of All Saints’ Church dates from the 14th century, while some of the interior material appears to be 13th century at least in style The church underwent a major reconstruction in the late 1840s to a design by James Harrison. This work was commissioned by John Keble at a cost of £6000 and was paid for out of his book royalties.

==Geology==
Hursley village is situated on the chalk at the northern edge of the Paleogene deposits of the Hampshire Basin; the chalk is largely overlain by head and &#x27;clay with flints&#x27;, insoluble material concentrated out of dissolved chalk. A number of dry valleys converge from the north. Immediately to the south of the village lies a belt of Palaeocene sandy clays of the Lambeth Group, sloping up to a ridge of Eocene clays and sandstones of the London Clay, Nursling and Whitecliff sands at Ladwell.

<text>Jet fuel or aviation turbine fuel (ATF, also abbreviated avtur) is a type of aviation fuel designed for use in aircraft powered by gas-turbine engines. It is colorless to straw-colored in appearance. The most commonly used fuels for commercial aviation are Jet A and Jet A-1, which are produced to a standardized international specification. The only other jet fuel commonly used in civilian turbine-engine powered aviation is Jet B, which is used for its enhanced cold-weather performance.

Jet fuel is a mixture of a variety of hydrocarbons. Because the exact composition of jet fuel varies widely based on petroleum source, it is impossible to define jet fuel as a ratio of specific hydrocarbons. Jet fuel is therefore defined as a performance specification rather than a chemical compound. Furthermore, the range of molecular mass between hydrocarbons (or different carbon numbers) is defined by the requirements for the product, such as the freezing point or smoke point. Kerosene-type jet fuel (including Jet A and Jet A-1, JP-5, and JP-8) has a carbon number distribution between about 8 and 16 (carbon atoms per molecule); wide-cut or naphtha-type jet fuel (including Jet B and JP-4), between about 5 and 15.

==History==
Fuel for piston-engine powered aircraft (usually a high-octane gasoline known as avgas) has a high volatility to improve its carburetion characteristics and high autoignition temperature to prevent preignition in high compression aircraft engines. Turbine engines (as with diesel engines) can operate with a wide range of fuels because fuel is injected into the hot combustion chamber. Jet and gas turbine (turboprop, helicopter) aircraft engines typically use lower cost fuels with higher flash points, which are less flammable and therefore safer to transport and handle.

The first axial compressor jet engine in widespread production and combat service, the Junkers Jumo 004 used on the Messerschmitt Me 262A fighter and the Arado Ar 234B jet recon-bomber, burned either a special synthetic &quot;J2&quot; fuel or diesel fuel. Gasoline was a third option but unattractive due to high fuel consumption. Other fuels used were kerosene or kerosene and gasoline mixtures.

A pressure to move from Jet fuel to sustainable aviation fuel, aka Aviation biofuel, has existed since before the 2016 Paris Agreement.

==Standards== 
Most jet fuels in use since the end of World War II are kerosene-based. Both British and American standards for jet fuels were first established at the end of World War II. British standards derived from standards for kerosene use for lamps—known as paraffin in the UK—whereas American standards derived from aviation gasoline practices. Over the subsequent years, details of specifications were adjusted, such as minimum freezing point, to balance performance requirements and availability of fuels. Very low temperature freezing points reduce the availability of fuel. Higher flash point products required for use on aircraft carriers are more expensive to produce. In the United States, ASTM International produces standards for civilian fuel types, and the U.S. Department of Defense produces standards for military use. The British Ministry of Defence establishes standards for both civil and military jet fuels. For reasons of inter-operational ability, British and United States military standards are harmonized to a degree. In Russia and the CIS members, grades of jet fuels are covered by the State Standard (GOST) number, or a Technical Condition number, with the principal grade available being TS-1.

== Types ==

=== Jet A/A-1 ===

Jet A specification fuel has been used in the United States since the 1950s and is usually not available outside the United States and a few Canadian airports such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, whereas Jet A-1 is the standard specification fuel used in most of the rest of the world, the main exceptions being Russia and the CIS members, where TS-1 fuel type is the most common standard. Both Jet A and Jet A-1 have a flash point higher than , with an autoignition temperature of .

=== Differences between Jet A and Jet A-1 ===

The differences between Jet A and Jet A-1 are twofold. The primary difference is the lower freezing point of Jet A-1 fuel:
* Jet A&#x27;s is 
* Jet A-1&#x27;s is 

The other difference is the mandatory addition of an antistatic additive to Jet A-1 fuel.

Jet A and Jet A-1 fuel trucks and storage tanks, as well as plumbing that carries them, are all marked &quot;Jet A&quot; or &quot;Jet A-1&quot; in white italicized text within a black rectangle background, 
=== Typical physical properties for Jet A and Jet A-1 ===
Jet A-1 fuel must meet:
* DEF STAN 91-91 (Jet A-1),
* ASTM specification D1655 (Jet A-1), and
* IATA Guidance Material (Kerosene Type), NATO Code F-35.

Jet A fuel must reach ASTM specification D1655 (Jet A).

=== Jet B ===

Jet B is a naphtha-kerosene fuel that is used for its enhanced cold-weather performance. However, Jet B&#x27;s lighter composition makes it more dangerous to handle. For this reason, it is rarely used, except in very cold climates. A blend of approximately 30% kerosene and 70% gasoline, it is known as wide-cut fuel. It has a very low freezing point of , and a low flash point as well. It is primarily used in northern Canada and Alaska, where the extreme cold makes its low freezing point necessary, and which helps mitigate the danger of its lower flash point.

===GOST standards===
The GOST standard 10227 specifies civilian fuels, among which TS-1, T-1, T-1S, T2 and RT. Military fuels such as T-1pp, T-8V (aka T-8B) and T-6 are specified by GOST 12308. Icing inhibitors are specified by GOST 8313. Some researchers refer to T-6 as &quot;ram rocket fuel&quot;; others have patented a method used to produce T-1pp from a mixture of T-6 and RT, the latter of which has been characterized as &quot;unified Russian fuel for sub- and supersonic aircraft&quot;.

==== TS-1 ====

TS-1 is a jet fuel made to Russian standard GOST 10227 for enhanced cold-weather performance. It has somewhat higher volatility than Jet A-1 (flash point is minimum). It has a very low freezing point, below .

==Additives==
The DEF STAN 91-091 (UK) and ASTM D1655 (international) specifications allow for certain additives to be added to jet fuel, including:
* Antioxidants to prevent gumming, usually based on alkylated phenols, e.g., AO-30, AO-31, or AO-37;
* Antistatic agents, to dissipate static electricity and prevent sparking; Stadis 450, with dinonylnaphthylsulfonic acid (DINNSA) as a component, is an example
* Corrosion inhibitors, e.g., DCI-4A used for civilian and military fuels, and DCI-6A used for military fuels;
* Fuel system icing inhibitor (FSII) agents, e.g., 2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethanol (Di-EGME); FSII is often mixed at the point-of-sale so that users with heated fuel lines do not have to pay the extra expense.
* Biocides are to remediate microbial (i.e., bacterial and fungal) growth present in aircraft fuel systems. Two biocides were previously approved for use by most aircraft and turbine engine original equipment manufacturers (OEMs); Kathon FP1.5 Microbiocide and Biobor JF. Biobor JF is currently the only biocide available for aviation use. Kathon was discontinued by the manufacturer due to several airworthiness incidents. Kathon is now banned from use in aviation fuel.
* Metal deactivator can be added to reduce the negative effects of trace metals on the thermal stability of the fuel. The one allowable additive is the chelating agent salpn (&quot;N,N′&quot;-bis(salicylidene)-1,2-propanediamine).

As the aviation industry&#x27;s jet kerosene demands have increased to more than 5% of all refined products derived from crude,
it has been necessary for the refiner to optimize the yield of jet kerosene, a high-value product, by varying process techniques.

New processes have allowed flexibility in the choice of crudes, the use of coal tar sands as a source of molecules and the
manufacture of synthetic blend stocks. Due to the number and severity of the processes used, it is often necessary and
sometimes mandatory to use additives. These additives may, for example, prevent the formation of harmful chemical species
or improve a property of a fuel to prevent further engine wear.

==Water in jet fuel==
It is very important that jet fuel be free from water contamination. During flight, the temperature of the fuel in the tanks decreases, due to the low temperatures in the upper atmosphere. This causes precipitation of the dissolved water from the fuel. The separated water then drops to the bottom of the tank, because it is denser than the fuel. Since the water is no longer in solution, it can form droplets which can supercool to below 0 °C (32 °F). If these supercooled droplets collide with a surface they can freeze and may result in blocked fuel inlet pipes. This was the cause of the British Airways Flight 38 accident. Removing all water from fuel is impractical; therefore, fuel heaters are usually used on commercial aircraft to prevent water in fuel from freezing.

There are several methods for detecting water in jet fuel. A visual check may detect high concentrations of suspended water, as this will cause the fuel to become hazy in appearance. An industry standard chemical test for the detection of free water in jet fuel uses a water-sensitive filter pad that turns green if the fuel exceeds the specification limit of 30 ppm (parts per million) free water. A critical test to rate the ability of jet fuel to release emulsified water when passed through coalescing filters is ASTM standard D3948 Standard Test Method for Determining Water Separation Characteristics of Aviation Turbine Fuels by Portable Separometer.

==Military jet fuels==

Military organizations around the world use a different classification system of JP (for &quot;Jet Propellant&quot;) numbers. Some are almost identical to their civilian counterparts and differ only by the amounts of a few additives; Jet A-1 is similar to JP-8, Jet B is similar to JP-4. Other military fuels are highly specialized products and are developed for very specific applications.
;JP-1
:was an early jet fuel specified in 1944 by the United States government (AN-F-32). It was a pure kerosene fuel with high flash point (relative to aviation gasoline) and a freezing point of . The low freezing point requirement limited availability of the fuel and it was soon superseded by other &quot;wide cut&quot; jet fuels which were kerosene-naphtha or kerosene-gasoline blends. It was also known as avtur.
;JP-2
:an obsolete type developed during World War II. JP-2 was intended to be easier to produce than JP-1 since it had a higher freezing point, but was never widely used.
;JP-3
:was an attempt to improve availability of the fuel compared to JP-1 by widening the cut and loosening tolerances on impurities to ensure ready supply. In his book &quot;Ignition! An Informal History of Liquid Rocket Propellants&quot;, John D. Clark described the specification as, &quot;remarkably liberal, with a wide cut (range of distillation temperatures) and with such permissive limits on olefins and aromatics that any refinery above the level of a Kentucky moonshiner&#x27;s pot still could convert at least half of any crude to jet fuel&quot;. It was even more volatile than JP-2 and had high evaporation loss in service.
;JP-4
:was a 50-50 kerosene-gasoline blend. It had lower flash point than JP-1, but was preferred because of its greater availability. It was the primary United States Air Force jet fuel between 1951 and 1995. Its NATO code is F-40. It is also known as avtag.
;JP-5
:is a yellow kerosene-based jet fuel developed in 1952 for use in aircraft stationed aboard aircraft carriers, where the risk from fire is particularly great. JP-5 is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, containing alkanes, naphthenes, and aromatic hydrocarbons that weighs and has a high flash point (min. ). Because some US naval air stations, Marine Corps air stations and Coast Guard air stations host both sea and land based naval aircraft, these installations will also typically fuel their shore-based aircraft with JP-5, thus precluding the need to maintain separate fuel facilities for JP-5 and non-JP-5 fuel. Chinese also named their navy fuel RP-5. Its freezing point is . It does not contain antistatic agents. JP-5 is also known as NCI-C54784. JP-5&#x27;s NATO code is F-44. It is also called AVCAT fuel for Aviation Carrier Turbine fuel.

:The JP-4 and JP-5 fuels, covered by the MIL-DTL-5624 and meeting the British Specification DEF STAN 91-86 AVCAT/FSII (formerly DERD 2452), are intended for use in aircraft turbine engines. These fuels require unique additives that are necessary for military aircraft and engine fuel systems.
;JP-6
:was developed for the General Electric YJ93 afterburning turbojet engines used in the North American XB-70 Valkyrie for sustained flight at Mach 3. It was similar to JP-5 but with a lower freezing point and improved thermal oxidative stability. When the XB-70 program was cancelled, the JP-6 specification, MIL-J-25656, was also cancelled.
;JP-7
:was developed for the Pratt &amp; Whitney J58 afterburning turbojet engines used in the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird for sustained flight at Mach 3+. It had a high flash point required to prevent boiloff caused by aerodynamic heating. Its thermal stability was high enough to prevent coke and varnish deposits when used as a heat-sink for aircraft air conditioning and hydraulic systems and engine accessories.
;JP-8
:is a jet fuel, specified and used widely by the U.S. military. It is specified by MIL-DTL-83133 and British Defence Standard 91-87. JP-8 is a kerosene-based fuel, projected to remain in use at least until 2025. The United States military uses JP-8 as a &quot;universal fuel&quot; in both turbine-powered aircraft and diesel-powered ground vehicles. It was first introduced at NATO bases in 1978. Its NATO code is F-34.
;JP-9
:is a gas turbine fuel for missiles, specifically the Tomahawk cruise missile, containing the TH-dimer (tetrahydrodimethyldicyclopentadiene) produced by catalytic hydrogenation of methylpentadiene dimer.
;JP-10
:is a gas turbine fuel for missiles, specifically the AGM-86 ALCM cruise missile. It contains a mixture of (in decreasing order) endo-tetrahydrodicyclopentadiene, exo-tetrahydrodicyclopentadiene (a synthetic fuel), and adamantane. It is produced by catalytic hydrogenation of dicyclopentadiene. It superseded JP-9 fuel, achieving a lower low-temperature service limit of . It is also used by the Tomahawk jet-powered subsonic cruise missile.
;JPTS
:was a combination of LF-1 charcoal lighter fluid and an additive to improve thermal oxidative stability officially known as &quot;Thermally Stable Jet Fuel&quot;. It was developed in 1956 for the Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 engine which powered the Lockheed U-2 spy plane.
;Zip fuel
:designates a series of experimental boron-containing &quot;high energy fuels&quot; intended for long range aircraft. The toxicity and undesirable residues of the fuel made it difficult to use. The development of the ballistic missile removed the principal application of zip fuel.
;Syntroleum
:has been working with the USAF to develop a synthetic jet fuel blend that will help them reduce their dependence on imported petroleum. The USAF, which is the United States military&#x27;s largest user of fuel, began exploring alternative fuel sources in 1999. On December 15, 2006, a B-52 took off from Edwards Air Force Base for the first time powered solely by a 50–50 blend of JP-8 and Syntroleum&#x27;s FT fuel. The seven-hour flight test was considered a success. The goal of the flight test program was to qualify the fuel blend for fleet use on the service&#x27;s B-52s, and then flight test and qualification on other aircraft.

==Piston engine use==

Jet fuel is very similar to diesel fuel, and in some cases, may be used in diesel engines. The possibility of environmental legislation banning the use of leaded avgas (fuel in spark-ignited internal combustion engine, which usually contains tetraethyllead (TEL), a toxic substance added to prevent engine knocking), and the lack of a replacement fuel with similar performance, has left aircraft designers and pilot&#x27;s organizations searching for alternative engines for use in small aircraft. As a result, a few aircraft engine manufacturers, most notably Thielert and Austro Engine, have begun offering aircraft diesel engines which run on jet fuel which may simplify airport logistics by reducing the number of fuel types required. Jet fuel is available in most places in the world, whereas avgas is only widely available in a few countries which have a large number of general aviation aircraft. A diesel engine may be more fuel-efficient than an avgas engine. However, very few diesel aircraft engines have been certified by aviation authorities. Diesel aircraft engines are uncommon today, even though opposed-piston aviation diesel powerplants such as the Junkers Jumo 205 family had been used during the Second World War.

Jet fuel is often used in diesel-powered ground-support vehicles at airports. However, jet fuel tends to have poor lubricating ability in comparison to diesel, which increases wear in fuel injection equipment. An additive may be required to restore its lubricity. Jet fuel is more expensive than diesel fuel but the logistical advantages of using one fuel can offset the extra expense of its use in certain circumstances.

Jet fuel contains more sulfur, up to 1,000 ppm, which therefore means it has better lubricity and does not currently require a lubricity additive as all pipeline diesel fuels require. The introduction of Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel or ULSD brought with it the need for lubricity modifiers. Pipeline diesels before ULSD were able to contain up to 500 ppm of sulfur and were called Low Sulfur Diesel or LSD. In the United States LSD is now only available to the off-road construction, locomotive and marine markets. As more EPA regulations are introduced, more refineries are hydrotreating their jet fuel production, thus limiting the lubricating abilities of jet fuel, as determined by ASTM Standard D445.

JP-8, which is similar to Jet A-1, is used in NATO diesel vehicles as part of the single-fuel policy.

==Synthetic jet fuel==

Fischer–Tropsch (FT) Synthesized Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK) synthetic fuels are certified for use in United States and international aviation fleets at up to 50% in a blend with conventional jet fuel. As of the end of 2017, four other pathways to SPK are certified, with their designations and maximum blend percentage in brackets: Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA SPK, 50%); synthesized iso-paraffins from hydroprocessed fermented sugars (SIP, 10%); synthesized paraffinic kerosene plus aromatics (SPK/A, 50%); alcohol-to-jet SPK (ATJ-SPK, 30%). Both FT and HEFA based SPKs blended with JP-8 are specified in MIL-DTL-83133H.

Some synthetic jet fuels show a reduction in pollutants such as SOx, NOx, particulate matter, and sometimes carbon emissions. It is envisaged that usage of synthetic jet fuels will increase air quality around airports which will be particularly advantageous at inner city airports.

Qatar Airways became the first airline to operate a commercial flight on a 50:50 blend of synthetic Gas to Liquid (GTL) jet fuel and conventional jet fuel. The natural gas derived synthetic kerosene for the six-hour flight from London to Doha came from Shell&#x27;s GTL plant in Bintulu, Malaysia. The world&#x27;s first passenger aircraft flight to use only synthetic jet fuel was from Lanseria International Airport to Cape Town International Airport on September 22, 2010. The fuel was developed by Sasol.

Chemist Heather Willauer is leading a team of researchers at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory who are developing a process to make jet fuel from seawater. The technology requires an input of electrical energy to separate Oxygen (O2) and Hydrogen (H2) gas from seawater using an iron-based catalyst, followed by an oligomerization step wherein carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen are recombined into long-chain hydrocarbons, using zeolite as the catalyst. The technology is expected to be deployed in the 2020s by U.S. Navy warships, especially nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.

On February 8, 2021, the world&#x27;s first scheduled passenger flight flew with some synthetic kerosene from a non-fossil fuel source. 500 liters of synthetic kerosene was mixed with regular jet fuel. Synthetic kerosene was produced by Shell and the flight was operated by KLM.

===USAF synthetic fuel trials===
On August 8, 2007, Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne certified the B-52H as fully approved to use the FT blend, marking the formal conclusion of the test program.
This program is part of the Department of Defense Assured Fuel Initiative, an effort to develop secure domestic sources for the military energy needs. The Pentagon hopes to reduce its use of crude oil from foreign producers and obtain about half of its aviation fuel from alternative sources by 2016. With the B-52 now approved to use the FT blend, the USAF will use the test protocols developed during the program to certify the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III and then the Rockwell B-1B Lancer to use the fuel. To test these two aircraft, the USAF has ordered of FT fuel. The USAF intends to test and certify every airframe in its inventory to use the fuel by 2011. They will also supply over to NASA for testing in various aircraft and engines.

The USAF has certified the B-1B, B-52H, C-17, Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom (as QF-4 target drones), McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, and Northrop T-38 Talon to use the synthetic fuel blend.

The U.S. Air Force&#x27;s C-17 Globemaster III, F-16 and F-15 are certified for use of hydrotreated renewable jet fuels. The USAF plans to certify over 40 models for fuels derived from waste oils and plants by 2013. The U.S. Army is considered one of the few customers of biofuels large enough to potentially bring biofuels up to the volume production needed to reduce costs. The U.S. Navy has also flown a Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet dubbed the &quot;Green Hornet&quot; at 1.7 times the speed of sound using a biofuel blend. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) funded a $6.7 million project with Honeywell UOP to develop technologies to create jet fuels from biofeedstocks for use by the United States and NATO militaries.

In April 2011, four USAF F-15E Strike Eagles flew over the Philadelphia Phillies opening ceremony using a blend of traditional jet fuel and synthetic biofuels. This flyover made history as it was the first flyover to use biofuels in the Department of Defense.

The air transport industry is responsible for 2–3 percent of man-made carbon dioxide emitted. Boeing estimates that biofuels could reduce flight-related greenhouse-gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent. One possible solution which has received more media coverage than others would be blending synthetic fuel derived from algae with existing jet fuel:

* Green Flight International became the first airline to fly jet aircraft on 100% biofuel. The flight from Reno Stead Airport in Stead, Nevada was in an Aero L-29 Delfín piloted by Carol Sugars and Douglas Rodante.
* Boeing and Air New Zealand are collaborating with Tecbio Aquaflow Bionomic and other jet biofuel developers around the world.
* Virgin Atlantic successfully tested a biofuel blend consisting of 20 percent babassu nuts and coconut and 80 percent conventional jet fuel, which was fed to a single engine on a 747 flight from London Heathrow to Amsterdam Schiphol.
* A consortium consisting of Boeing, NASA&#x27;s Glenn Research Center, MTU Aero Engines (Germany), and the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory is working on development of jet fuel blends containing a substantial percentage of biofuel.
* British Airways and Velocys have entered into a partnership in the UK to design a series of plants that convert household waste into jet fuel.
*24 commercial and military biofuel flights have taken place using Honeywell “Green Jet Fuel,” including a Navy F/A-18 Hornet.
* In 2011, United Continental Holdings was the first United States airline to fly passengers on a commercial flight using a blend of sustainable, advanced biofuels and traditional petroleum-derived jet fuel. Solazyme developed the algae oil, which was refined utilizing Honeywell&#x27;s UOP process technology, into jet fuel to power the commercial flight.

Solazyme produced the world&#x27;s first 100 percent algae-derived jet fuel, Solajet, for both commercial and military applications.
Oil prices increased about fivefold from 2003 to 2008, raising fears that world petroleum production is becoming unable to keep up with demand. The fact that there are few alternatives to petroleum for aviation fuel adds urgency to the search for alternatives. Twenty-five airlines were bankrupted or stopped operations in the first six months of 2008, largely due to fuel costs.

In 2015 ASTM approved a modification to Specification D1655 Standard Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuels to permit up to 50 ppm (50 mg/kg) of FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) in jet fuel to allow higher cross-contamination from biofuel production.

==Worldwide consumption of jet fuel==
Worldwide demand of jet fuel has been steadily increasing since 1980. Consumption more than tripled in 30 years from 1,837,000 barrels/day in 1980, to 5,220,000 in 2010. Around 30% of the worldwide consumption of jet fuel is in the US (1,398,130 barrels/day in 2012).

== Taxation ==
Article 24 of the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation of 7 December 1944 stipulates that when flying from one contracting state to another, the kerosene that is already on board aircraft may not be taxed by the state where the aircraft lands, nor by a state through whose airspace the aircraft has flown. This is to prevent double taxation. It is sometimes suggested that the Chicago Convention precludes the taxation of aviation fuel. However, this is not correct. The Chicago Convention does not preclude a kerosene tax on domestic flights or on refuelling before international flights.

Article 15 of the Chicago Convention is also sometimes said to ban fuel taxes. Article 15 states: &quot;No fees, dues or other charges shall be imposed by any contracting State in respect solely of the right of transit over or entry into or exit from its territory of any aircraft of a contracting State or persons or property thereon.&quot; However, ICAO distinguishes between charges and taxes, and Article 15 does not prohibit the levying of taxes without a service
provided.

In the European Union, commercial aviation fuel is exempt from taxation, according to the 2003 Energy Taxation Directive. EU member states may tax jet fuel via bilateral agreements, however no such agreements exist.

In the United States, most states tax jet fuel.

== Health effects ==
General health hazards associated with exposure to jet fuel vary according to its components, exposure duration (acute vs. long-term), route of administration (dermal vs. respiratory vs. oral), and exposure phase (vapor vs. aerosol vs. raw fuel). Kerosene-based hydrocarbon fuels are complex mixtures which may contain up to 260+ aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon compounds including toxicants such as benzene, n-hexane, toluene, xylenes, trimethylpentane, methoxyethanol, naphthalenes. While time-weighted average hydrocarbon fuel exposures can often be below recommended exposure limits, peak exposure can occur, and the health impact of occupational exposures is not fully understood. Evidence of the health effects of jet fuels comes from reports on both temporary or persisting biological from acute, subchronic, or chronic exposure of humans or animals to kerosene-based hydrocarbon fuels, or the constituent chemicals of these fuels, or to fuel combustion products. The effects studied include: cancer, skin conditions, respiratory disorders, immune and hematological disorders, neurological effects, visual and hearing disorders, renal and hepatic diseases, cardiovascular conditions, gastrointestinal disorders, genotoxic and metabolic effects.

<doc id="1205439" wikidata="Q4826617" url="?curid=1205439" title="Automaticity">
<text>In the field of psychology, automaticity is the ability to do things without occupying the mind with the low-level details required, allowing it to become an automatic response pattern or habit. It is usually the result of learning, repetition, and practice. Examples of tasks carried out by &#x27;muscle memory&#x27; often involve some degree of automaticity.

Examples of automaticity are common activities such as walking, speaking, bicycle-riding, assembly-line work, and driving a car (the last of these sometimes being termed &quot;highway hypnosis&quot;). After an activity is sufficiently practiced, it is possible to focus the mind on other activities or thoughts while undertaking an automatized activity (for example, holding a conversation or planning a speech while driving a car).

==Characteristics==
John Bargh (1994), based on over a decade of research, suggested that four characteristics usually accompany automatic behavior:
;Awareness 
:A person may be unaware of the mental process that is occurring.
;Intentionality
:A person may not intentionally initiate a mental process.
;Efficiency
:Automatic mental processes tend to have a low cognitive load, requiring relatively low mental resources. 
;Controllability 
:A person may not have the ability to stop or alter a process after initiation.

Bargh states that these are simply common characteristics; not all are needed for a process to be considered automatic. For instance, stereotype activation has been described as an automatic process: it is unintentional and efficient, requiring little effort. However stereotype activation is accompanied by above chance awareness and if conflicting processing goals are available then it becomes controlled. Therefore, stereotype activation only satisfies two of Bargh&#x27;s criteria, but is still considered to be an example of automatic processing.

==In reading==
LaBerge and Samuels (1974) helped explain how reading fluency develops. Automaticity refers to knowing how to perform some arbitrary task at a competent level without requiring conscious effort — &quot;i.e.&quot;, it is a form of unconscious competence.

Moreover, if the student is automatic or is &quot;a skilled reader, multiple tasks are being performed at the same time, such as decoding the words, comprehending the information, relating the information to prior knowledge of the subject matter, making inferences, and evaluating the information&#x27;s usefulness to a report he or she is writing&quot;. It is essential to understand automaticity and how it is achieved to better a student&#x27;s performance. This is important for teachers because automaticity should be focused on in the early years to ensure higher level reading skills in adolescence.

==Disruption==
Automaticity can be disrupted by explicit attention when the devotion of conscious attention to the pattern alters the content or timing of that pattern itself. This phenomenon is especially pronounced in situations that feature high upside and/or downside risk and impose the associated psychological stress on one&#x27;s conscious mind; one&#x27;s performance in these situations may either &quot;a&quot;) be unimpaired or even enhanced (&quot;flow&quot;) or &quot;b&quot;) deteriorate (&quot;choke&quot;).

This effect has been named the &quot;centipede effect&quot; after the fable of the &quot;Centipede&#x27;s dilemma&quot;, where a toad immobilises a centipede simply by asking it how it walks. The centipede&#x27;s normally unconscious locomotion was interrupted by conscious reflection on it. The psychologist George Humphrey referred to this parable in his 1923 &quot;The story of man&#x27;s mind&quot;: &quot;No man skilled at a trade needs to put his constant attention on the routine work,&quot; he wrote. &quot;If he does, the job is apt to be spoiled.&quot;

==Use to influence==

In &quot;Influence&quot;, Robert Cialdini&#x27;s book about social psychology and influence tactics, Cialdini explains how common automatic response patterns are in human behavior, and how easily they can be triggered, even with erroneous cues. He describes an experiment conducted by social psychologists Langer, Chanowitz, and Blank which illustrates how compliant people will be with a request if they hear words that sound like they are being given a reason, even if no actual reason is provided. The experimenters approached people standing in line to use a photocopier with one of three requests:

* &quot;Excuse me. I have 5 pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I&#x27;m in a rush?&quot;
* &quot;Excuse me. I have 5 pages. May I use the Xerox machine?&quot;
* &quot;Excuse me. I have 5 pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make some copies?&quot;

When given the request plus a reason, 94% of people asked complied with the request. When given the request without a reason, only 60% complied. But when given the request with what sounds like a reason but isn&#x27;t, compliance jumped back to 93%. Langer, Chanowitz, and Blank are convinced that most human behavior falls into automatic response patterns.

However, when the request was made larger (20 pages instead of 5), subjects expected a sound reason before complying, as illustrated in the table.

<text>Peter Derek Vaughan Prince (14 August 1915 – 24 September 2003) was a Bible teacher whose daily radio programme, &quot;Derek Prince Legacy Radio&quot;, is broadcast around the world in various languages.

==Early years==
Derek Prince was born in India to British parents and was a scholar of Greek and Latin, attending both Eton College and Cambridge University.

At university he described himself as an atheist, but while serving with the British army in World War II, he began studying the Bible and became a Christian.

==Marriage and the growth of his ministry==
Prince married Danish missionary Lydia Christensen in 1946, becoming father to her eight adopted daughters before the couple adopted another daughter.

The family moved to the USA in 1963 and pastored a church in Seattle. Prince worked at the Faith Tabernacle in Chicago, and then moved to Good News Church in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. 

In May 1971 Derek Prince Publications opened offices in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Derek Prince Publications became Derek Prince Ministries in December 1990.

Lydia died in 1975, and Prince married Ruth Baker (who had three adopted children) in 1978. They moved to Jerusalem in 1981. 

The Princes traveled extensively in ministry until Ruth died on 29 December 1998. The following list of countries covers their ministry from 1993 to 1998. Some of these countries were visited more than once: Russia, Germany, Kazakhstan, Hungary, South Africa, Kenya, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Turkey, Poland, Bahrain, Cuba, Colombia, Switzerland, France, Portugal, India and England.

He is the author of 51 books, 600 audio and 100 videos, many of which has been translated and published in more than 60 languages. Some of the subjects that are covered in his teachings are prayer and fasting, foundations of the Christian faith, spiritual warfare, God&#x27;s love and marriage and family. His daily radio is translated into Arabic, Chinese (Amoy, Cantonese, Mandarin, Shanghainese, Swatow), Croatian, German, Malagasy, Mongolian, Russian, Tamil, Samoan, Spanish, Bahasa Indonesia, Tongan, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Hindi and many other languages. The radio program continues to reach many people around the world.

Derek Prince Ministries continued for the rest of his life to distribute his teachings and to train missionaries, church leaders, and congregations.

===Demons and deliverance===
As a Pentecostal, Prince believed in the reality of spiritual forces operating in the world, and of the power of demons to cause illness and psychological problems. While in Seattle, he was asked to perform an exorcism on a woman, and he came to believe that Christians could be &quot;demonized&quot; (normally described as &quot;possessed&quot; by demons - Prince avoided this term which implies &#x27;ownership&#x27;). This was at odds with the more usual Pentecostal view that demons could &quot;possess&quot; unbelievers, but could only &quot;oppress&quot; Christians. Prince believed that his deliverance ministry used the power of God to defeat demons.

===Israel===

Prince strongly opposed replacement theology. His book &quot;The Destiny of Israel and the Church&quot; argues that the Church has not replaced Israel and that the covenant that God made with the nation of Israel still stands today. Prince also believed that the creation of the state of Israel was the fulfillment of biblical prophecy. Derek states in his book &quot;Promised Land&quot;, &quot;The central theme of biblical prophecy, as it is being unfolded in our time, revolves around the land and the people of Israel. God is carrying out His predetermined plan to regather the Jewish people from their worldwide dispersion and restore them to their ancient homeland.&quot;

==The Shepherding Movement==
Prince created the Shepherding Movement with fellow ministers Don Basham, Bob Mumford, Charles Simpson and Ern Baxter, who became known as the &#x27;Fort Lauderdale Five.&#x27; They sought to counter what were seen as excesses within the Charismatic Movement, by emphasizing discipleship and pastoral care. The practice of &#x27;personal submission to spiritual authorities&#x27; was considered controversial. Prince&#x27;s association with the Shepherding Movement provided international exposure. After leaving the movement, he focused on his own international ministry.

==Publications==
Prince published many books and recorded more than 900 audio teachings and over 100 video sermons.

<doc id="1205454" wikidata="Q29697" url="?curid=1205454" title="The Broken Hearts Club">
<text>The Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comedy is a 2000 American romantic comedy drama film written and directed by Greg Berlanti. It follows the lives of a group of gay friends in West Hollywood, centered on a restaurant owned by the fatherly Jack (John Mahoney) and the softball team he sponsors. The friends rely on each other for friendship and support as they search for love, deal with loss, and discover themselves.

&quot;The Broken Hearts Club&quot; was Berlanti&#x27;s first feature film, based on his circle of friends at the time. The movie was met with generally favorable reviews from critics, receiving praise for portraying homosexuality as normal and its characters as average gay men. The film focuses on &quot;the universal themes of romance, acceptance and family&quot;, as opposed to AIDS, coming out, and sex, which are more controversial and stereotypical topics commonly covered in LGBT films.

==Plot==
The film follows the lives of a group of gay friends in West Hollywood. Among the group is Dennis, a photographer who often holds the group together; Cole, a handsome, charismatic actor who — often unwittingly — ends up with other people&#x27;s boyfriends; Benji, the youngest member of the group who has a penchant for gym-bodied men and who finds himself going through some bad times; Howie, a psychology student who is known for overthinking every situation; Patrick, the cynic of the group; and Taylor, who has just broken up with his long-term boyfriend.

Guiding them is restaurant owner Jack, who provides them with advice and jobs for some of them who work part-time as servers at his restaurant. But when tragedy strikes, and the group&#x27;s newest member, 23-year-old Kevin, attempts to fit in, their friendships are put to the test.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
&quot;The Broken Hearts Club&quot; was written by Greg Berlanti about his own circle of friends at the time; the Howie/Marshall storyline is semi-autobiographical to a relationship Berlanti once had. The film had a working title of &quot;The Broken Hearts League&quot; as well as &quot;8x10&#x27;s&quot;, a term Berlanti&#x27;s sister used to describe the men he dated.

=== Casting ===
The production was able to secure funding from the studio with the casting of John Mahoney and Timothy Olyphant. Dean Cain took a role against the wishes of his agents, who had cautioned him against playing a gay character. Billy Porter, who was the least known of the actors cast at the time, won the role of Taylor when he &quot;[imbued] the character with heart and something real&quot; in his audition. The film also stars Nia Long, Mary McCormack and Justin Theroux. It features a cameo from Kerr Smith, who knew Berlanti as the showrunner on &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; and enjoyed the script so much he asked to be a part of the film. Jennifer Coolidge was cast as the hairdresser Betty, to whom all the guys, with the exception of Howie, go for hair therapy.

===Filming===
Filming began in October 1999 and took place over the course of thirteen days on a $1 million budget. The movie was filmed in Los Angeles and West Hollywood, while restaurant exteriors and interiors were shot in Long Beach. The hardware store scene was filmed in Laurel Hardware Company in West Hollywood. The film was distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment and its subsidiary Sony Pictures Classics and produced by Banner Entertainment and .

Two weeks later, the film made $153,468 as it reached twenty-eight screens and the week later, it grossed $175,553 as it reached fifty-six. In its eighth week of release, &quot;The Broken Hearts Club&quot; played at sixty-two theaters. The film&#x27;s domestic gross totaled $1,746,585 after twelve weeks of release. The movie was released in a number of countries in 2001 and played at various gay and lesbian film festivals worldwide. &quot;The Broken Hearts Club&quot; grossed $272,536 outside of the United States, bringing its worldwide gross to $2,019,121.
===Critical response===
The movie review website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 64% approval rating, based on 28 reviews, with an average score of 6.03/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states that the film &quot;often feels like an amalgam of 70s sitcoms – though a hunky lead and a sweet central romance provide soapy delights&quot;. According to Metacritic, the film has scored 51% based on 17 reviews, indicating mixed or average reviews. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, praising the film&#x27;s positivity and &quot;the ordinariness of its characters and what they talk about.&quot; Ebert noted that &quot;instead of angst, Freudian analysis, despair and self-hate, the new generation sounds like the cast of a sitcom, trading laugh lines and fuzzy truisms.&quot; CNN&#x27;s Paul Clinton also lauded &quot;The Broken Hearts Club&quot; for focusing on &quot;the universal themes of romance, acceptance and family&quot;, as opposed to AIDS, coming out, and sex. Clinton viewed the film as &quot;reminiscent of those classic films that explored the complex dynamics of friendship&quot;, calling it &quot;a heartwarming, glorious movie for anyone who has ever had a friend – or a family.&quot;

Lisa Schwarzbaum from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it &quot;a majority oriented movie that assumes sophisticated familiarity with a sexual minority&quot;. Jami Bernard from &quot;Daily News&quot; commented &quot;It&#x27;s the first mainstream gay movie that feels totally comfortable in its shoes&quot;. Desmond Ryan from &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; described the film as having an &quot;undemanding and reassuring amiability that made it a crowd-pleaser at Sundance.&quot;

On the other hand, Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; felt the characters were &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;uninteresting&quot;. Bob Longino of &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; summarized the movie as &quot;sometimes funny, sometimes a yawn&quot;.

The film was often compared to the 1970s film &quot;The Boys in the Band&quot;, directed by William Friedkin, although Ebert and LaSalle both felt that &quot;The Broken Hearts Club&quot; was generally more upbeat and optimistic. Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; exclaimed that the film shows &quot;how far homosexual characters have come since &quot;The Boys in the Band&quot;, sad AIDS dramas, and cute identity peekaboo sitcoms&quot;. Longino, however, commented that &quot;&quot;Broken Hearts&quot; doesn&#x27;t break much new ground. Actually, &quot;The Boys in the Band&quot; did the groundbreaking 30 years ago.&quot;

<text>Charles Anderson Worsley Anderson-Pelham, 2nd Earl of Yarborough (12 April 1809 – 7 January 1862) was a British nobleman who succeeded to the Earldom of Yarborough in 1846.

Before his accession, he was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Newtown 1830–1831, Lincolnshire 1831–1832 and North Lincolnshire 1835–1846.

Lord Yarborough gave his name to a hand of cards dealt in contract bridge that has no card higher than a nine (see Yarborough). The probability of getting a Yarborough is formula_1 which is formula_2 or about formula_3. The Earl offered £1,000 to anyone who achieved a &quot;Yarborough&quot; – on condition they paid him £1 each time they did not succeed!

<text>Happy Valley, Pennsylvania is a region of Centre County that contains the borough of State College, and the townships of College, Harris, Patton, and Ferguson. Collectively, these municipalities comprise the Centre Region Council of Governments. The region is bounded by Nittany Valley to the northeast, Penns Valley to the east, and Bald Eagle Valley to the north and west. Centre County is the State College, Pennsylvania, metropolitan statistical area, which is part of the State College–DuBois, PA Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
The name Happy Valley was given to the area in the Great Depression-era of the 1930s since it was generally not hit hard financially by the depression because of the presence of Pennsylvania State University. The term &quot;Happy Valley&quot; is generally synonymous with Centre County, Pennsylvania including State College Borough, townships of College, Harris, Patton, and Ferguson, etc. in the Centre Region. Bellefonte, Philipsburg, Milesburg, and Centre Hall, Pennsylvania are all a part of Happy Valley.

==Culture==

The culture of Happy Valley is largely dominated by Penn State University. The activities that occur in this region largely surround the student activities, such as student arrivals, football Saturdays, Homecoming, and graduation. Though the region is also home to the State College Spikes, a minor league baseball team, the area is most known for the Penn State Nittany Lions football team.

During the summer session, the student population returns to their home towns, thus reducing the local population significantly. During this time, the Central Pennsylvania Festival of the Arts, usually referred to as &quot;Arts Fest&quot;, is held for five days and draws many visitors to town during what would otherwise be a quiet period. Streets are closed off and lined with booths where people can buy paintings, pottery, jewelry, and other hand-made goods. There are also numerous musical performances and plays to take in, and food vendors selling everything from funnel cakes to Indian cuisine.

The Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon, commonly referred to as THON, is a 46-hour Dance Marathon that takes place every February on the University Park campus with the purpose of raising money for the Four Diamonds Foundation. A number of events throughout the year pave the way to February&#x27;s THON weekend. The Borough of State College changes its name during the 46-hour event to City of THON even though the event takes place in College Township and not State College.

Blue-White Football Weekend occurs in April and includes a carnival, fireworks, food vendors, the student entertainment stage, live music, a parade, and more. On game day, an autograph session with the football student-athletes is held in Beaver Stadium, prior to kickoff of the Blue-White football intrasquad scrimmage game.
==Demographics==

===Crime===
In a 2014 comparison of 380 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, Happy Valley had the lowest vehicle theft rate.

<doc id="1205478" wikidata="Q49695" url="?curid=1205478" title="Explorer 11">
<text>Explorer 11 (also known as S-15) was a NASA satellite that carried the first space-borne gamma-ray telescope. This marked the beginning of space gamma-ray astronomy. Launched on 27 April 1961 by a Juno II, the satellite returned data until 17 November 1961, when power supply problems ended the science mission. During the spacecraft&#x27;s seven-month lifespan it detected twenty-two events from gamma-rays and approximately 22,000 events from cosmic radiation.

== Launch ==

Explorer 11 was launched for the purpose of detecting the sources of high-energy gamma rays. The spacecraft achieved an orbit with an apogee of , a perigee of , a period of 108.10 minutes, and an inclination of 28.90°. In addition to detecting gamma rays, Explorer 11 was designed to map their direction with emphasis on the plane of the galaxy, the Galactic Center, the Sun, and other known radio noise sources; to relate the measurements to the cosmic-ray flux density and the density of interstellar matter; and to measure the high-energy gamma-ray albedo of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The satellite was a spin-stabilized octagonal aluminum box () on a cylinder ( in diameter and long). Explorer 11 was constructed so that its stable motion was an end-over-end tumble about the transverse principal axis that had the largest moment of inertia. The gamma-ray telescope assembly was mounted so that its axis of sensitivity, which was parallel to the long axis of the satellite, would rotate in the plane of tumble. The orientation of this axis in space was determined to approximately 5° by means of optical aspect detectors and the use of the known radiation pattern of the vehicle antenna. Telemetry was provided only in real time by two PM transmitters, since the onboard tape recorder failed at launch.

== Instruments ==
=== Crystal Sandwich / Cherenkov Counter ===
The instrumentation for the Explorer 11 crystal sandwich Cherenkov detector experiment was the same as that used for the gamma-ray telescope experiment. The gamma-ray experiment was designed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) primarily to detect cosmic gamma rays greater than 50 MeV. Charged particle data were collected using the same instrument. This telescope was used to determine the intensity and pitch-angle distribution of geomagnetically trapped protons. The telescope consisted of an anticoincidence plastic shield, layers of Sodium iodide (NaI) and Caesium iodide (CsI) crystals, and a cylindrical Cherenkov detector. When the anticoincidence requirement of the plastic scintillator shield was removed, charged particle information was recorded by all three counters. In addition, charged particle coincidences between the crystal sandwich and Cherenkov detectors were recorded. In this mode, directional information was obtained. The solid-angle-area factor of the telescope was about . The look direction of the telescope was identical to the symmetry axis of the spacecraft. For a beam incident parallel to the look direction of the telescope, the detection efficiency fell to 0 at 15° from this direction. The energy thresholds for each detector were as follows: (1) scintillation plastic (upper portion), electrons -350 keV, protons -3.5 MeV, (2) scintillation plastic (lower portion), electrons -400 keV, protons -35 MeV, (3) crystal sandwich, electrons -400 keV, protons -75 MeV, and (4) Cherenkov, electrons -15 MeV, protons -350 MeV. The accumulation time for the charged particle data was approximately 30 seconds. A single scaling circuit in Explorer 11 permitted one channel at a time to be monitored. During the 7 months in which the instrument was turned on and working in orbit, only 141 hours (3%) were considered useful observing time. During this time, the telescope was monitored for gamma rays and charged particles.

=== Phoswich-Cherenkov Counter Telescope ===
This experiment was designed to search for high-energy gamma rays (greater than 50 MeV) from the celestial sphere. The basic detector scheme consisted of a sandwich of NaI and CsI scintillating crystals (20 g/cm2), viewed by a single photomultiplier, and a Lucite Cherenkov counter, viewed by two photomultipliers. It was completely surrounded by a shield of scintillating plastic viewed by five photomultipliers. The sandwich detector provided high-atomic-number material for the pair production process, i.e., energetic gamma rays were converted into electron-positron pairs. The electrons and positrons then entered the Cherenkov counter, which detected particles traversing its volume in only the downward sense. The simultaneous electric signals from its two PMTs indicated that one or more charged particles had traversed the telescope. The signals or lack of signals from the surrounding plastic shield at the instant the telescope had been triggered indicated whether the triggering was caused by an uncharged or charged particle. Also, the &quot;last&quot; and &quot;total&quot; components of the signals from the photomultiplier that viewed the sandwich detector afforded a method of distinguishing neutron and gamma-ray induced events. The experiment performed normally from launch until 17 November 1961.

The Explorer 11 telescope, developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), used a combination of a sandwich scintillator detector along with a Cherenkov counter to measure the arrival directions and energies of high-energy gamma rays. Since the telescope could not be aimed, the spacecraft was set in a slow spin to scan the celestial sphere. Due to a higher than planned orbit that carried the spacecraft into the detector-jamming radiation of the Van Allen radiation belt, and an early failure of the on-board tape recorder, only 141 hours of useful observing time could be culled from about 7 months during which the instrument operated. During this time thirty-one &quot;gamma-ray signature&quot; events were recorded when the telescope was pointing in directions well away from the atmosphere of Earth, which is a relatively bright source of gamma rays produced in interactions of ordinary cosmic ray protons with air atoms. The celestial distribution of the thirty-one arrival directions showed no statistically significant correlation with the direction of any potential cosmic source. Lacking such a correlation, the identification of the cause of the thirty-one events as gamma rays of cosmic origin could not be established. The results of the experiment were therefore reported as upper limits that were significantly lower than the limits obtained from previous balloon-borne experiments.

An improved gamma-ray telescope, also developed at MIT, was flown on the Orbiting Solar Observatory 3 (OSO 3), which was launched in 1967. It achieved the first definitive observation of high-energy cosmic gamma rays from both galactic and extragalactic sources. Later experiments, both in orbit and on the ground, have identified numerous discrete sources of cosmic gamma rays in our galaxy and beyond.

<text>June Sheldon Jones III (born February 19, 1953) is an American football coach and former player who was most recently the offensive coordinator of the Seattle Sea Dragons. Jones was the head football coach at the University of Hawaii at Manoa from 1999 to 2007, and was the head football coach at Southern Methodist University (SMU) from 2008 until he resigned on September 8, 2014. He coached in the National Football League (NFL) for three years as head coach of the Atlanta Falcons from 1994 to 1996, plus a ten-game stint as interim head coach of the San Diego Chargers in 1998; he also spent seasons as head coach of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the Canadian Football League (CFL). Jones was the general manager and head coach of the Houston Roughnecks.

Jones played professionally as a quarterback in the NFL and CFL. He played college football with the Oregon Ducks, Hawaii Rainbow Warriors and Portland State Vikings.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Jones grew up in Portland, Oregon, the second of four children born to Marilyn and June Jones Jr.

===Playing career===
Jones played the quarterback position on three college teams: Oregon (1971–1972), Hawaii (1973–1974), and Portland State (1975–1976). It is during his time at Portland State that he was introduced to the run and shoot offense by Mouse Davis. It would be an offense that he would later champion throughout his coaching career.

His two seasons at Portland State resulted in totals of 5,798 yards passing with 50 TD against 20 INT. He became the first quarterback to give the run and shoot legitimacy as a quarterback-friendly offense. In the years prior, Portland State very rarely had success throwing the ball.

*1975: 137/235 for 2,280 yards and 25 TD vs 10 INT
*1976: 238/423 for 3,518 yards and 25 TD vs 10 INT

Thereafter, he entered professional football, playing for the Atlanta Falcons (1977–1981) of the National Football League and the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (1982). In four seasons with the Falcons, Jones completed 75 of 166 passes for 923 yards with three touchdowns and seven interceptions.

===Coaching career===

====Early career====
In 1983, Jones started his coaching career as a graduate assistant under Dick Tomey at the University of Hawaii. He then spent two years in the USFL, first as the wide receivers coach for the Houston Gamblers (1984), then as the offensive coordinator for the Denver Gold (1985). Following the demise of the USFL, Jones spent the 1986 season working as an offensive assistant for the Ottawa Rough Riders of the CFL. In 1987, he got his first NFL coaching position serving as the quarterbacks coach on Jerry Glanville&#x27;s staff with the Houston Oilers. After Glanville was released by the Oilers, he would join the Detroit Lions coaching staff upon the recommendation of Mouse Davis, his college head coach at Portland State who was serving as the team&#x27;s offensive coordinator.

====Atlanta Falcons====
Jones reunited with Glanville upon joining the Atlanta Falcons organization in 1991 as its assistant head coach. In 1994, Jones replaced Glanville as the team&#x27;s head coach, a move that caused a rift between the two. Reportedly, they did not speak to each other for several years thereafter. (Later, in the 2000s, Jones would hire Glanville as defensive coordinator at Hawaii.) As head coach, Jones installed the run and shoot offense he learned under Mouse Davis. Initially, quarterback Jeff George flourished under the system, passing for 3,734 yards and 23 touchdowns in Jones&#x27;s first year and 4,143 yards and 24 touchdowns his second year. In 1995, Jones&#x27;s second season as head coach, the Falcons went to the playoffs, losing in the first round to the Green Bay Packers. The following year, the Falcons posted a 3–13 record, leading to Jones&#x27;s dismissal. Jones&#x27;s coaching record over three seasons in Atlanta was nineteen wins and twenty-nine losses. He also clashed with quarterback Jeff George during his final season, including a well-publicized and widely broadcast profanity-laced shouting match during a September 22 game against the Philadelphia Eagles. The feud contributed to both men&#x27;s release by the organization.

====San Diego Chargers====
Jones returned to coaching when the San Diego Chargers hired him as quarterbacks coach on January 20, 1998. On October 13, 1998, head coach Kevin Gilbride was fired after the sixth game and Jones became the interim head coach. The Chargers won three of ten games coached by Jones, giving him a career NFL coaching record of 22 wins and 36 losses.

====Hawaii====
Jones joined the University of Hawaii-Manoa football team as head coach, replacing Fred von Appen, who was fired when the team lost 18 games in a row, including all twelve games in the 1998 season. Jones led the Warriors to a 9–4 record and a share of the Western Athletic Conference football championship in the 1999 season, making it the most dramatic turnaround in NCAA football history until that record was surpassed by Tulane in the 2022–23 season. With Jones&#x27;s success on the field, and media-friendly persona off the field, he instantly became one of the most famous people in Hawaii, with some people making &quot;June Jones for Governor&quot; T-shirts. Reflecting his offensive philosophy, bumper stickers sporting the slogan &quot;June would throw&quot; appeared. These referenced legendary Hawaiian lifeguard Eddie Aikau, of whom it is said, &quot;Eddie would go&quot; (into big surf).

Joe Moore of KHON-TV in Honolulu faulted Jones for discarding long-standing traditions, such as changing music played during home games, and the change in the uniforms and team nickname during his tenure.

During his tenure at Hawaii, he coached five All-Americans, 52 all-conference performers, and 16 NFL Draft picks. In particular, Jones claims to have made a special effort to recruit local talent in his players and coaching staff. One of the most notable of his recruits was quarterback Timmy Chang, who became the all-time NCAA leader in passing yardage.

Jones was injured in a car accident on February 22, 2001, missing the spring season because of his injuries.

Jones negotiated a contract worth $800,016 during the 2004 season, which made him the highest-paid public employee in the state, even though the football team was struggling. The team finished with a 7–5 regular season record and an invitation to the Hawaii Bowl. Half of Jones&#x27;s $800,000 salary was paid by private donors.

On December 24, 2006, Jones passed Dick Tomey to become the winningest head coach in Hawaii football history (against an all-college schedule) with a 41–24 victory over Arizona State in the 2006 Hawaii Bowl.

Frustrated with what he viewed as a lack of support from the university, Jones opted to leave Hawaii at the end of the 2007 season. After initial reports had him interviewing at SMU, Hawaii officials had offers to raise his salary from $800,000 a year to $1.7 million a year and offered a commitment to improve its facilities; in addition there was an outpouring of support from Hawaii fans, including Gov. Linda Lingle. However, Jones contacted Hawaii on January 7, 2008, and let them know he had decided to accept an offer from SMU. Jones said the work that needed to be done to improve the football facilities and the campus in general would never get done with him still there. He said after all of the broken promises, leaving was the only way to send a message. Jones went 76–41 at Hawaii, including 4–2 in bowls. His teams finished first in the WAC twice and second two other times.

====SMU====
In a press conference at the Hall of Champions adjacent to Gerald J. Ford Stadium on January 7, 2008, Jones was introduced as the new head football coach at Southern Methodist University. He was the school&#x27;s fifth coach since the NCAA-imposed &quot;death penalty&quot; in 1987. Jones signed a five-year contract with SMU, paying him two million dollars annually, and making him the highest-paid coach in Conference USA. He guided the SMU Mustangs to a 1–11 record in 2008.

On November 28, 2009, Jones coached SMU to a win over Tulane, ending the regular season with a 7–5 record, the most SMU victories in a season since the 1980s. The 2009 season included a win over the defending and eventual repeat C-USA champion, East Carolina. The 2009 season also saw Jones utilize the ground game more than in recent seasons. Jones led SMU to its third bowl-eligible season, and to its first bowl game (Hawai&#x27;i Bowl) since the 1984 Aloha Bowl and the NCAA-imposed death penalty. SMU defeated Nevada, 45–10, to finish the season 8–5. As in 1999, Jones coached his team to the most improved record in Division I football.

In 2010, Jones coached the Mustangs to a .500 season. The Mustangs went 7–7 overall with a conference record of 6–2, helping them clinch the C-USA Western title. The team beat the previous year&#x27;s C-USA champion, East Carolina, in overtime in the final regular-season game but lost the Conference USA Championship Game in Orlando to UCF the next week. Jones and the Mustangs went to their second consecutive bowl game, the Armed Forces Bowl, losing to the Army Black Knights, 16–14. The game was played at SMU&#x27;s Gerald J. Ford Stadium because the game&#x27;s normal venue, Texas Christian University&#x27;s Amon G. Carter Stadium, was undergoing renovation.

On September 8, 2014, Jones stepped down as coach of the Mustangs, citing &quot;personal issues&quot;. Jones led the Mustangs to four straight bowl appearances before finishing 5–7 in the school&#x27;s first season as a member of the AAC and starting the 2014 season 0–2, losing by a combined total of 88–6.

While at SMU he was publicly questioned about the number of players on the team from outside of Texas, and for a lack of recruiting. SMU won 1 game in 2014 and 2 games in 2015 with the players Jones had recruited.

===High school football===
After interviewing for the vacant coaching job at Hawaii, Jones was hired as the offensive coordinator at Kapolei High School in January 2016. In December 2016, Jones was named director of athletics at Saint Louis School and the door was left open for him to step into the football coach&#x27;s job, if it opened.

===CFL===
On August 2, 2017, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats hired Jones as an assistant coach. He was hired after the team had lost their first five regular-season games, the last of which was a 60–1 blowout. On August 24, 2017, he was named interim head coach, after Kent Austin stepped down to focus on his duties as vice-president of Football Operations. The team was 0–8 at the time Jones was appointed head coach.

He quickly became embroiled in controversy when he attempted to get his longtime friend and former Baylor University coach Art Briles hired as an assistant. Briles had been fired from Baylor for his actions in connection with a major sexual assault scandal at the school. Following a media firestorm, the team reversed the decision to hire Briles.

As head coach, Jones led the Tiger-Cats to a respectable 6–4 record over the ten games that remained in the 2017 season. Because of this, the Tiger-Cats removed the &quot;interim&quot; tag and retained Jones as head coach for the next three seasons.

After an 8–10 season in 2018 (which included a playoff berth), Jones agreed to step aside for the highly sought-after Orlondo Steinauer to take over as head coach. Jones initially intended to stay on in 2019 as associate head coach and offensive coordinator but departed May 13, 2019. His record as a CFL head coach is 14–14.

===XFL===
On May 20, 2019, the XFL confirmed it had hired Jones to serve as its Houston franchise&#x27;s head coach.

For the 2023 XFL season, Jones signed on as the offensive coordinator for Jim Haslett&#x27;s coaching staff, with Jones stating that he and Haslett would be coaching the Seattle Sea Dragons. He resigned on July 1, 2023.

==Coaching style==
As an American collegiate coach, Jones&#x27;s offenses rarely run the ball, favoring a wide-open, pass-heavy offense, the run and shoot approach; however, in 2010 sophomore tailback Zach Line rushed for over 1,450 yards in 14 games, making him the 11th best rusher in the FBS. Jones is also notable for never holding full-contact practices.

== Personal life ==
On June 30, 2023, at age 70, Jones was arrested under suspicion of driving while under the influence of alcohol.

<doc id="1205488" wikidata="Q4970953" url="?curid=1205488" title="British Rail Mark 1">
<text>British Rail Mark 1 is the family designation for the first standardised designs of railway carriages built by British Railways (BR) from 1951 until 1974, now used only for charter services on the main lines or on preserved railways.

Following nationalisation in 1948, BR had continued to build carriages to the designs of the &quot;Big Four&quot; companies (the Great Western, Southern, London, Midland and Scottish and London and North Eastern railways), and the Mark 1 was intended to be the standard carriage design for use across all lines, incorporating the best features of each of the former companies&#x27; designs. It was also designed to be much stronger than previous designs, to provide better protection for passengers in the event of a collision or derailment.

The Mark 1 coaches were built in two distinct tranches: the early vehicles (1951–1960) and, from 1961 onwards, the &quot;Commonwealth&quot; stock – so named on account of their bogies, which were a variant of the bogie designed by the General Steel Castings Corporation (formerly named the Commonwealth Steel Company) of Granite City, United States of America.

==Construction==

The design was used for hauled passenger stock, multiple unit carriages and non-passenger carrying stock. For passenger stock, construction continued from 1951 to 1963, while multiple units and non-passenger carrying stock continued to be built until 1974. Developed by Derby Carriage &amp; Wagon Works, they were built at Derby, Doncaster, Eastleigh, Swindon, Wolverton and York works.

These were constructed in two lengths. Most had underframes long, with bogies at centres; the body was long if the coach was gangwayed, or if non-gangwayed. A smaller number had underframes long, with bogies at centres; the body was long if the carriage was gangwayed, or if non-gangwayed. The shorter vehicles were intended for use where the track curvature was too tight to accommodate the longer vehicles, due to excessive overhang.

These lengths allowed for compartments or seating bays wide, plus space for toilets and entrance vestibules; a typical design of Mark 1 vehicle, the TO (Open Third class), had eight seating bays, three entrance vestibules and a pair of toilets at one end. This provided reasonable space. Care was taken to ensure that passengers could enjoy an unobstructed view out of the train from all seats. Seats were aligned to windows and on the long-distance design of Mark 1, the windows had a low sill, just above the floor.

An unusual feature of the design was the bodyside tumblehome curvature, of radius and just noticeable; the windows had flat glass and consequently the upper quarter was separate and in a different plane from the lower glazing, with an intervening transom, and the steel panels were recessed on either side of each window opening to accommodate the difference between the flat glass and the curved sides. The opening portion of the windows were provided with sliding ventilators, with an external aerofoil for draught-free ventilation, the correct opening position being marked by a pair of arrows. Doors were provided with frameless droplights manufactured by Beclawat; these were supported by a spring-loaded lazytongs mechanism inside the lower part of the door, and the top of the window had a sprung metal clip engaging in slots on either side of the window opening.

The original vehicles had timber veneer interior finishes, and on the main line vehicles small plastic labels were fixed to the panels, giving the type of wood and its country of origin e.g. &quot;Crown Elm Great Britain&quot;; &quot;Lacewood Great Britain&quot;, etc. In 1955, an order was placed for 14 vehicles, with manufacturers being invited to incorporate innovative features; perhaps the most striking of these prototypes, which were completed in 1957, were those constructed by Cravens. Following evaluation, and with the increasing influence of the British Transport Design Panel, Mark 1 vehicles built from the later 1950s onwards were to modified designs. Laminates were used instead of timber panelling, and in the last of the Mark 1 hauled vehicles, fluorescent lighting was fitted instead of tungsten bulbs. An important variant on the Mark 1 design were the 44 Pullman vehicles built by Metro-Cammell in 1960. A further change introduced in the late 1950s was the use of aluminium window frames instead of direct glazing into the steel panelling.

The underframes consisted of a heavy assembly of steel sections, with angle used to form bracing trusses. These were placed close to the centre line of the vehicle rather than beneath the solebars, as was characteristic of previous vehicles. The original bogies were a double bolster type, which like the carriages mounted upon them, were designated &quot;BR Mark 1&quot; (BR1 for short). These proved unsatisfactory and a new cast-steel design was introduced from 1958 (often referred to as the Commonwealth type). This gave a superb ride with minimal tyre wear, but was heavy. The final batches of locomotive hauled Mark 1s, and many Mark 1 EMU vehicles, were built with the Swindon-designed B4 bogie. Later on, many BR1 bogie vehicles were retrofitted with the B4 bogie, and a comfortable ride could then be relied on, as was evident in the later EMU vehicles.

An important factor was the compressive coupling, which provided excellent inter-vehicular damping through the gangway end-plates, which quickly became highly polished, indicating that they were performing this task.

A device known as a &quot;tell-tale&quot; connects the emergency (communication) cord or chain to the train line to facilitate an emergency stop.

== Sleeping cars ==

British Railways and outside contractors built the British Railways Mark 1 sleeping car between 1957 and 1964. Three hundred and eighty cars of three different types were built, with a fourth type created later by conversion. None remain in front-line service, and very few are preserved due to asbestos insulation being present in most carriages, which was very difficult to have professionally removed.

Three types were designed, based on the BR Mark 1 underframe and profile. All featured 11 compartments with side corridor, an attendants&#x27; pantry at one end, and two toilets at the other. There was one fixed berth in first class compartments and two fixed berths in second class. Thus the Sleeper First (SLF) slept 11 and the Sleeper Second (SLSTP) 22. The Sleeper Composite (SLC) had five first class and 6 second class compartments.

Early examples were fitted with BR1 bogies which were later replaced with B5 bogies. Later examples were fitted with Commonwealth bogies from new. The cars weighed 39 to 42 tonnes, with the First-class cars weighing one tonne less than the others, and cars with the fabricated B5 bogies also weighing one tonne less than those with the heavy cast steel Commonwealth bogies.

=== Modifications ===
In order to overcome the lack of flexibility in the fleet of sleeping cars, Wolverton works modified some of the SLSTP cars with a stowable top berth. The resulting Sleeper Either class with Pantry (SLEP) cars could then be used to better accommodate the fluctuations in passenger demand. The SLEPs were renumbered in the 2800-series.

=== Replacement ===
The Mark 1 sleeping cars fleet continued to serve British Rail for many years. With no Mark 2 sleeping car design, the Mark 1s continued until the British Rail Mark 3 sleeping cars entered service in the early 1980s.

==1957 prototypes==
In 1957, twelve carriages were built (four by Doncaster Works and two each by four outside contractors) in an attempt to improve on the existing design. While the passenger comfort level may have improved, the passenger capacity fell (except for the two built by the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company), resulting in a lower passenger per ton-of-train figure and disdain from BR&#x27;s operating departments. Further orders to these designs were not forthcoming.

==Fibreglass bodied vehicles==
In 1962, Eastleigh Works constructed a single fibreglass bodied Mark 1. The vehicle, numbered S1000S, was mounted on the underframe of Mark 1 Tourist Second Open S4378, which was written off as a result of the Lewisham rail crash in 1957. Only the one example was built due to the cost, making this the only fibreglass-bodied passenger carriage built by British Railways. S1000S was used on the Hayling Island Branch Line until closure in 1963. After use as a generator van at Lancing Carriage Works, it re-entered capital stock. Its final duties were on commuter trains between and . After withdrawal, it was stored at . It was purchased in 1973 by the East Somerset Railway. In 2010, the carriage was restored, and is in service on the East Somerset Railway. Repainted into maroon when work carried out in 2016.

A single van, no. E85000, also had fibreglass body panels. This was converted from a normal passenger carriage (Mark 1 Corridor Composite no. Sc15170) at Derby Carriage &amp; Wagon Works in 1970 to carry parcels conveyed in BRUTE trolleys; it was used until 1982. It weighed , even though it was longer than a normal parcels van weighing .

==XP64==
Near the end of the production of hauled Mark 1 stock came a series of eight experimental carriages known as the XP64 set. Three Corridor Firsts, two Corridor Seconds, and three Tourist Second Opens were built by Derby Carriage &amp; Wagon Works in 1964. Externally they resembled Mark 1 stock with the addition of a cosmetic cover over the solebars of the standard Mark 1 underframes, but inside they included many new features, including pressure ventilation, new seating designs and wider bi-fold doors. Many of these features were later incorporated in the Mark 2 stock produced from 1964.

==Safety==
The British Rail Mark 1 was considerably stronger than most pre-nationalisation designs, and it was noticed as early as 1952 that the examples involved in the Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash had withstood the impacts better than the older coaches around them. The improvement in safety the Mark 1 thus represented was praised by the Chief Inspecting Officer of Railways, Lt Col I.K.A. McNaughton (Chief Inspecting Officer of Railways, Department for Transport), in the Sir Seymour Biscoe Tritton Lecture to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1977. Speaking of the fall in fatalities since 1955, he put forward his opinion that a major factor in this improvement was &quot;the introduction in 1951 of the BR standard Mark 1 passenger carriage, which, over a period of about ten years, replaced pre-war designed rolling stock on most principal routes. The damage-resistant qualities of this all-steel coach, mounted on a 200 ton end-load resistant underframe and fitted with buckeye couplings, have been evidenced time and time again. Only in a small number of very destructive accidents has serious body damage of the kind that inevitably leads to fatal accidents been observed and there have been several remarkable instances of high-speed derailments in which no personal injuries have occurred.&quot;

Although construction of Mark 1 passenger stock ended in 1963, multiple units and non-passenger carrying stock based on the Mark 1 design continued to be built until 1974.

The 1988 Clapham Junction rail accident highlighted that by the 1980s the Mark 1 coach was dated, and less able to withstand collisions than newer designs. Nevertheless, the Hidden Report into the disaster concluded that withdrawal of Mark 1 units was impractical and the design was not inherently unsafe: &quot;The inventory of Mark I coaching stock is large, and much of it has not reached an end of economic life, nor will do so for another decade or more. Mark I vehicles have good riding qualities, and are not intrinsically lacking in collision resistance.&quot; British Rail was still using some 4EPB and 2EPB (classes 415 and 416) multiple units with underframes that had been constructed before World War II and these were a priority for replacement.

During the late 1990s Mark 1 stock began to reach the end of its design life and concerns about its safety relative to newer rolling stock became more pressing. The Health and Safety Executive issued instructions in 1999 per the &quot;Railway Safety Regulations 1999&quot; to withdraw all Mark 1 carriages and multiple units based on that design by the end of 2002 unless rebodied or modified to reduce the potential for overriding in the event of a collision. A proposed modification to extend mainline use beyond 2002 at the time of the 1999 HSE instruction was &#x27;cup and cone&#x27;, however trials were inconclusive and deemed expensive in comparison with the safety benefits. In October 2002 the Health and Safety Executive extended the permitted use of Mark 1 based rolling stock until 31 December 2004 with the proviso they be fitted with a Train Protection &amp; Warning System.

==Post-privatisation==

During the 1990s, the few remaining Mark 1 loco-hauled vehicles on the main line were withdrawn, having been progressively replaced by Mark 2 and Mark 3 stock through the 1970s and 1980s. However, the extensive Network SouthEast commuter network on the former Southern Region operated by the Network SouthCentral, Network SouthEastern and South West Trains shadow franchises was worked mainly by Mark 1 based multiple units of the 205, 207, 411, 412, 421, 422 and 423 classes.

When British Rail was privatised in the mid-1990s, only Connex South Eastern was given an extended franchise (15 years) in return for ordering new trains. Connex South Central and South West Trains, the other major users of Mark 1 multiple units, were not required to order new trains. As a result, in 2000, Mark 1 units were still in use across most of the former Southern Region with no new trains having been ordered.

When the franchises were relet in the early 2000s, they were done with a requirement to replace the Mark 1s, thus hundreds of new multiple units of classes 171, 375, 376, 377, 444, 450 and 458 were introduced by Connex South Eastern, South West Trains and Southern between 2001 and 2005.

A similar story took place in Scotland, with the last of ScotRail&#x27;s Mark 1 based Class 303 multiple units surviving until December 2002.

The use of Mark 1 stock on postal trains was curtailed when the Royal Mail partially replaced them in the early 1990s. The postal train services on the West Coast Main Line were worked using new Class 325 multiple units. However, these units proved to be extremely troublesome in service and due to technical failures were often loco-hauled instead of running under their own power , and therefore Mark 1 formations continued to be used here, and elsewhere on the network. However, in January 2004, the Royal Mail ceased using rail to transport mail traffic. Thus, the problem of how to replace the large numbers of Mark 1 carriages on these services was resolved.

Network Rail continue to use converted Mark 1 coaches for various departmental duties – test trains, sandite units, and accommodation units for worksite personnel are some examples.

A small number of railtour companies have waivers to operate Mark 1 carriage stock on railtour duties. The conditions usually involve the fitting of central door locking and having either a non-passenger or non-Mark 1 carriage at the ends of the train. This is often achieved by running with a locomotive at each end of the train, instead of just at the front, which also reduces the need to run-round at minor terminus stations, many of which lost their run-round facilities when locomotive hauled trains of Mark 1 or Mark 2 coaches gave way to multiple unit operation on service trains.

The final withdrawal of Mark 1s from daily mainline use in 2005, some 54 years since the design entered service. South West Trains was granted a derogation to continue to operating two three-car 421s on the Lymington branch line until 2010.

Due to the lack of central door locking and Mark 1 stock not meeting the latest rolling stock safety expectations, various rules now govern their usage. In particular vehicles lacking central door locking require a steward to be present in each vehicle. Train companies are also recommended to run Mark 1 stock with more robust non-Mark 1 stock at either end to act as a barrier in the case of collisions. Mark 1s continue to be used on special charter trains with charter operators including North Yorkshire Moors Railway, Riviera Trains, Vintage Trains and West Coast Railways. The Office of Rail &amp; Road has granted these operators an exemption to the &quot;Railway Safety Regulations 1999&quot; to continue to operate Mark 1s on the main line until 2023.

==Preservation==

Restored Mark 1 carriages have entered service on many of the UK&#x27;s heritage railways. Their ready availability has avoided the need for the railways to rely on the limited quantity of surviving pre-BR carriage stock – most examples of which had been scrapped before the railway preservation movement had properly started.

The long service life of Mark 1 carriages means that a heritage railway can (potentially) recreate an authentic period train of the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s or early 1990s, when painted in a suitable livery.

=== Sleeping cars ===
Several Mark 1 sleeping cars were bought by preservation societies for use as volunteer accommodation. When British Rail began to run down its overnight sleeper trains, many heritage railways replaced them with newer Mark 3 cars. Since most Mark 1 sleeping cars had been built with asbestos insulation, which was expensive to have decontaminated professionally, most were sold for scrap.

Those Mark 1 sleeping cars that survive have been decontaminated and are kept for their value as museum exhibits, as much as for sleeping accommodation. Of these, five are Sleeper Firsts and one is a Sleeper Second.
==Liveries==

British Railways Mark I carriages have been painted in a wide range of liveries. On introduction in 1951 the carriages were painted Crimson Lake (the official Railways Executive designation), usually referred to as Crimson (BS381C:540 Crimson being the British Standard colour reference) and Cream (the combination often referred to colloquially as &quot;blood and custard&quot;) for corridor stock and Crimson for non-corridor stock. Corridor passenger stock was normally also lined out whereas non-corridor stock was not. The term &#x27;Carmine&#x27; is often incorrectly used as a consequence of an error made by a contemporary railway journalist and has, unfortunately, been repeated ever since.

1956 saw the first big changes, with the end of &#x27;third class&#x27; and the return of regional colour schemes. The Western Region promptly adopted Great Western Railway chocolate and cream livery for vehicles used on its named express trains and maroon for other stock. The Southern Region reverted to green and the other regions adopted maroon. 1962 saw Southern Region adopt the now familiar yellow cantrail above first class and red above dining cars. By the end of the 1960s this was found on all carriages. In 1962 the Western Region abandoned the use of chocolate and cream.

With the introduction of spray painting in 1964, the coach ends became the same colour as the bodywork. A year later the ubiquitous British Rail blue and grey was introduced with the Mark 2s, and by 1968 most non-suburban Mark I stock was blue and grey; however it wasn&#x27;t until 1974 that the last maroon Mark 1 was repainted into blue and grey livery. The use of blue and grey continued until 1982 when the first experiments in new liveries occurred. During the BR blue period other changes took place – notably the last &#x27;Ladies Only&#x27; compartments vanished in 1977.

1982 saw a proliferation of new liveries, including yellow and grey for stock that was requisitioned for engineering and maintenance work. In 1985 some carriages reappeared in chocolate and cream for the GWR 150th anniversary celebrations, along with a brief Scottish experiment in green and cream. Then around 1988 reclassification of &#x27;second class&#x27; as &#x27;standard class&#x27; took place.

1983 was the year that the InterCity livery was first seen, 1986 the introduction of Network SouthEast and the end of the Searail livery.

During the 1980s a complete rake of 1950s built corridor compartment second class Mark 1s (including a BSK) which operated exclusively on the Glasgow – Stranraer route and connected with the Irish Sea ferries, were painted into a very striking Sealink livery of red, blue, and white, and internally the vestibules (but not the main side corridors) were painted bright yellow to match the refurbished EMUs of the period. Being early 1950s coaches these had all-timber interiors which lent themselves to painting. Following withdrawal from the Stranraer line towards the end of the 1980s this rake was used by ScotRail on &quot;Merrymaker&quot; charter services, including long-distance trips on the West Coast Main Line, before eventually being withdrawn completely at the very end of the 1980s.

1988 saw the first Regional Railways livery (as well as postal trains and parcels trains turning Royal Mail red).

From 1995/96 private operators began to paint their stock their own colours.

<text>John David Pawson (25 February 1930 – 21 May 2020) was an English evangelical minister, writer and prominent Bible teacher.

==Biography==
According to his autobiography, Pawson&#x27;s immediate ancestors were all farmers, Methodist preachers or both, dating back to John Pawson, a friend and follower of John Wesley. His father, Henry Cecil Pawson FRSE (1897–1978), was head of Agriculture at Durham University and Vice President of the Methodist conference. From his childhood in the north of England David Pawson had wanted to be a farmer, but by the time he had completed his studies for a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in agriculture at Durham University, he felt God was calling him into full-time Christian ministry. He then studied for a Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Master of Arts (MA) in theology at Wesley House, a Methodist theological college in Cambridge. On 1 September 1956, after training, he was commissioned in the Chaplains Branch, Royal Air Force as a chaplain with the relative rank of flight lieutenant. He served in Aden, and relinquished his commission (thereby leaving the RAF) on 1 September 1959.

After leaving the RAF he served as a Methodist minister, but became increasingly uncomfortable with the idea of infant baptism. After appearing before a doctrinal committee of the Methodist church, he volunteered to leave the denomination, and did so. Shortly thereafter he accepted an invitation to become the pastor of Gold Hill Baptist Church in Buckinghamshire.

Later, as pastor of Guildford Baptist Church (&#x27;Millmead&#x27;, which he helped to design), he established a reputation among both evangelicals and charismatics as a Bible teacher. From here his teaching tapes – originally made for the church&#x27;s sick and elderly members – became popular worldwide. Under his ministry, Millmead became one of the largest Baptist churches in the United Kingdom.

Pawson left Millmead in 1979 and engaged in an itinerant worldwide Bible teaching ministry predominantly through seminars for church leaders in Asia, Australia, Africa, England, Europe, and the United States. Millions of copies of his teachings have been distributed in more than 120 countries. He was a writer and speaker with a reputation of urgency, clarity, and faithfulness to the Scriptures. His overviews of the books of the Bible have been published and recorded in &quot;Unlocking the Bible&quot;, available on CDs, DVDs, and YouTube. 

Pawson died on 21 May, 2020 at the age of 90.

==Teachings==
In &quot;The Normal Christian Birth&quot;, Pawson argued that a biblical initiation into Christianity should involve more than the simple &quot;Sinner&#x27;s Prayer&quot;. Whilst accepting the fundamental basis of salvation by faith, he argued that the Biblical model of a person&#x27;s &quot;birth&quot; into God&#x27;s kingdom included aspects which are frequently ignored or forgotten today. He proposed four principal steps: repentance towards God; believing in Jesus; baptism in water; and receiving the Holy Spirit. This, according to Pawson, is the biblical pattern for a &quot;normal Christian birth&quot;. According to the book itself, &quot;David Pawson advocates a synthesis of the &#x27;liberal&#x27; emphasis on repentance, the &#x27;evangelical&#x27; on faith, the &#x27;sacramental&#x27; on baptism and the &#x27;pentecostal&#x27; on the Spirit.&quot; This book has been influential and is taught at a number of theological seminaries and mission stations.

In &quot;Leadership is Male&quot;, he teaches that leadership is a role given by God to men. In so doing, he criticises men for not taking proper responsibility in important aspects of family and church life. He argues that modern men too often neglect their social obligations and should return to the Biblical model of manhood. This book&#x27;s foreword was written by a woman, Elisabeth Elliot.

In &quot;The Road to Hell&quot;, Pawson is critical of Annihilationism, the teaching that the punishment of hell is not eternal. He teaches that people who go to hell experience eternal suffering. According to the book itself, by &quot;challenging the modern alternatives of liberal &#x27;universalism&#x27; and evangelical &#x27;annihilationism&#x27;, David Pawson presents the traditional concept of endless torment as soundly biblical.&quot;

In &quot;Unlocking the Bible&quot;, Pawson presents a book by book study of the whole Bible. The book is based on his belief that the Bible should be studied, as it was written, &quot;a book at a time&quot; (certainly not a verse, or even a chapter at a time), and that each book is best understood by discovering why and for whom it was written. It is based on an arranged series of talks in which he set out the background, purpose, meaning and relevance of each book of the Bible, and was transcribed into written form by Andy Peck. The groundwork for this study was laid in the 1960s and 70s, when Pawson took his congregation through nearly half of the Old Testament and all of the New Testament line by line (recordings of those studies are still distributed).

In &quot;When Jesus Returns&quot;, he critically considers in the light of scripture the major views on eschatology popular in the church today, specifically the preterist, historicist, futurist and idealist schools of interpreting the Book of Revelation. He rejects postmillennialism in favour of a premillennial understanding of the Second Coming, so that Jesus will return bodily in power immediately before his reign over the world for a millennium from Jerusalem. He asserts that the supernatural taking up of believers alive at this time (following the &#x27;tribulation&#x27; period of persecution), so as to join the returning Christ, fulfils the Rapture prophecies; he argues against a pre-tribulation timing of the rapture. He further argues that the return of the Jews to the Holy Land is a fulfilment of scriptural prophecy, and that prophecies spoken about Israel relate specifically to Israel (not to the church), so that the outstanding prophecies about Israel will be fulfilled before the end of the age.

In &quot;Jesus Baptises in One Holy Spirit&quot;, Pawson discusses the evidence for the Baptism in the Holy Spirit as a separate event from believing, repentance and water baptism. He argues that a believer does not receive the indwelling Holy Spirit until s/he is baptized in the Spirit, a distinct experience evidenced by charismatic gifts such as prophecy or tongues. This differs from the evangelical view that the Spirit is automatically received when a person believes, and the Pentecostal view that receiving the indwelling Spirit (at conversion) and receiving the Baptism in the Spirit are two experiences with different purposes.

In &quot;The Challenge of Islam to Christians&quot;, Pawson documents the present rapid rise of Islam in the West. He explains what Islam is, arguing that its rejection of Jesus Christ&#x27;s divinity mean the two faiths cannot be reconciled, and he proposes a Christian response, based on the church purifying itself. The book details Pawson&#x27;s testing of his premonition that Britain would become Islamic. In comparing the situation to that portrayed by the Hebrew prophet Habakkuk, Pawson implies that the rise of Islam could be impending judgement for the immorality into which Western churches and secular humanist society has sunk.

In &quot;Once Saved, Always Saved?&quot;, Pawson uses scripture to question the frequent evangelical claim that someone who has once believed in Jesus Christ will end up with Christ in heaven whatever that person subsequently believes or does. (Twelve years earlier, another evangelical, RT Kendall, summed up this claim in a book having the same title without a question mark.) Pawson points to the need to persevere in faith, and to the repeated exhortations in scripture to do so.

In &quot;Word and Spirit Together: Uniting Charismatics and Evangelicals&quot; (a revision of &quot;Fourth Wave&quot;), Pawson calls for an end to the division between charismatic and Evangelical Christians over the issue of Spiritual Baptism and charismatic gifts. He argues that the charismatic gifts are for the church today but that their practice should be built on a solid scriptural basis. He therefore argues that the two groups should learn from each other, to the benefit of both.

In &quot;Defending Christian Zionism&quot;, Pawson puts the case that the return of the Jews to the Holy Land is a fulfilment of scriptural prophecy, and that Christians should support the existence of the Jewish State (although not unconditionally its actions) on theological grounds. He also argues that prophecies spoken about Israel relate specifically to Israel (not to the church, as in &quot;replacement theology&quot;). However he criticises Dispensationalism, a largely American movement holding similar views about Israel. Pawson&#x27;s book &quot;Israel in the New Testament&quot; continues the Christian Zionist theme.

Pawson wrote a number of Commentaries where he went through an entire book of the Bible in detail. This series is based on the preaching of David Pawson to his congregation back in the 60s and 70s. This series, which includes almost all of the books of the New Testament Books and selected books of the Old Testament, was added to on a regular basis.

==Works==
Pawson was the author of more than 90 books, produced more than 300 teaching videos and more than 1600 audio recordings.

<text>The International Zetetic Challenge (from Greek ζητεῖν &quot;zēteîn&quot;, &quot;to search&quot;) was an attempt to prove or disprove the existence of, or demonstrate events related to, the paranormal. It ran from 1987 until 2002 and offered a €200,000 prize to &quot;any person who could prove any paranormal phenomenon.&quot;

The challenge was overseen by two scientists, Henri Broch and Jacques Theodor; as well as a professional illusionist, Gérard Majax. Investigations and tests were carried out in the Laboratoire de Zététique at France&#x27;s University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis.

After fifteen years and a number of investigations the challenge was ended, the prize was unawarded, as no verifiable paranormal incident had been witnessed by the challengers. The laboratory at the university still conducts research in fields related to the paranormal, however.

<text>The lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus), also known as the wanderoo, is an Old World monkey endemic to the Western Ghats of South India.

==Characteristics==
Lion-tailed macaques are covered in black fur, and have a striking gray or silver mane that surrounds the face in both sexes. The face itself is hairless and black in adults, but pinkish in infants less than a year old. Infants are born with no mane, which begins to growth about two months after birth. They are named not for their mane, but for their tail, which is long, thin, and naked, with a lion-like, black tail tuft at the tip. The size of their tail is about 25 cm (9.8 in) in length. Their eyes are a shade of hazelnut with highlighting black eyelids. 

Lion-tailed macaques, like other macaques, have deep cheek pouches used for storing food, and are quadrupedal with opposable digits. The mane that surrounds its face gives this monkey its German name &quot;Bartaffe&quot; – &quot;beard ape&quot;. With a head-body length of and a weight of , it ranks among the smaller macaques species.

==Behavior and ecology==

The lion-tailed macaque is a rainforest dweller, often found in the upper canopy of tropical moist evergreen forests or monsoon forests. It is diurnal, meaning it is active exclusively in daylight hours. When active, they will spend half the day foraging, and the other half will be spent resting or finding new areas to forage. This species tends to avoid humans more than other macaques, however, habitat loss has led to increased habituation and conflict with conflict with humans.

In group behavior, the lion-tailed macaque is much like other macaques, living in hierarchical groups of usually 10 to 20 members, which usually consist of few males, typically 1–3 (including the dominant alpha), and many females. They have a polygynous mating system with no specific breeding season. While there is no specific breeding season, they tend to breed in the wet season, when resources are most abundant. Little time is spent grooming or playing with others in the group. 

Lion-tailed macaques are a territorial animal, defending their area first with loud cries and bared teeth towards the invading troops. If this proves to be fruitless, it brawls aggressively, which can result in severe injuries due to lacerations from their large canines. Other forms of communication come in the form of mounting to show strength, branch shaking to scare off, lip-smacking as a friendly greeting, or yawning with a grimace to indicate dominance.
Lion-tailed macaque behavior is characterized by typical patterns of arboreal living. This patterns involve selectively feeding on a large variety of fruit trees, large interindividual spaces while foraging, and time budgets with high proportion of time devoted to exploration and feeding. Lion-tailed macaques are omnivores, primarily eating indigenous fruits, seeds, flowers, insects, snails, and small vertebrates in virgin forest. Lion-tailed macaques are very important for seed dispersal, and are able to transport seeds long distances by either dropping or defecating seeds. However, due to changes in their environment, adaption to rapid environmental change has occurred in areas of massive selective logging through behavioral modifications and broadening of food choices. These changes involve a large increase in ground foraging and feeding on far more non-native plants and insects. These feeding changes include fruits, seeds, shoots, pith, flowers, cones, mesocarp, and other parts of many non-indigenous and pioneer plants. In the forests of Kerala they were observed preying on nestlings and eggs of pigeons.

Gestation lasts approximately six months. The young are nursed for one year. Sexual maturity is reached at four years for females, and six years for males. The life expectancy in the wild is approximately 20 years, while in captivity is up to 30 years.

== Threats ==
While lion-tailed macaques are preyed on by snakes, raptors, and large carnivores, the impact of natural predators on population size does not compare to their largest threat. The largest threat to the lion-tailed macaque is habitat fragmentation due to large amounts of timber harvesting and exotic plantations, such as tea and coffee. This fragmentation leads to many problems. Lion-tailed macaques are struggling to find food, being hit by cars, and being electrocuted by power lines. Due to their low numbers and high levels of fragmentation, they are also highly susceptible to inbreeding, which can cause many genetic issues. Their second largest threat is from humans hunting and trapping them for meat, especially within areas that have primates as their preferred food. There are also many human-primate conflicts occurring now due to macaques venturing out of their forests to find food.

==Conservation and population==
An assessment in 2003 for IUCN reports 3,000–3,500 of these animals scattered over several areas in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka. The lion-tailed macaque ranks among the rarest and most threatened primates. Their range has become increasingly isolated and fragmented by the spread of agriculture and tea, coffee, teak and cinchona, construction of water reservoirs for irrigation and power generation, and human settlements to support such activities.

From 1977 to 1980, public concern about the endangered status of lion-tailed macaque became the focal point of Save Silent Valley, India&#x27;s fiercest environmental debate of the decade. From 1993 to 1996, 14 troops were observed in Silent Valley National Park, Kerala, one of the most undisturbed viable habitats left for them. Silent Valley has the largest number of lion-tailed macaques in South India. Other protected areas in Kerala include Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary, Peppara Wildlife Sanctuary, Shendurney Wildlife Sanctuary, Periyar Tiger Reserve and its premises (Gavi and Konni), Eravikulam National Park, Pambadum Shola National Park, Parambikulam Tiger Reserve, Annaimalai Tiger Reserve, New Amarambalam Reserved Forest, Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary and Chimmony Wildlife Sanctuary and Wayanad region.

A self-sustainable single population of 32 groups of lion-tailed macaques occurred in Sirsi-Honnavara, Karnataka, the northernmost population of the species. A local census concluded in 2007, conducted in the Theni District of Tamil Nadu, put their numbers at around 250, which was considered encouraging, because until then, no lion-tailed macaques had been reported in that specific area. The species is also prominently found in the Papanasam part of the Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve of Tirunelveli district, the Palani Hills Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park of Dindigul, the Anaimalai Tiger Reserve of Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu. Many zoos take part in breeding programs which help to secure the survival of this species. About 338 of these macaques are reported to live in zoos. (In July 2021 Australia&#x27;s Rockhampton Zoo euthanased Australia&#x27;s last lion-tailed macaque after its companion died of natural causes.)
However, it is no longer on ‘The World&#x27;s 25 Most Endangered Primates’ list, after the international body compiling it determined that the local governments in southern India had acted positively to protect it.

<doc id="1205513" wikidata="Q7737043" url="?curid=1205513" title="The Golden Gate (Seth novel)">
<text>The Golden Gate (1986) is the first novel by poet and novelist Vikram Seth. The work is a novel in verse composed of 590 Onegin stanzas (sonnets written in iambic tetrameter, with the rhyme scheme following the AbAbCCddEffEgg pattern of &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;). It was inspired by Charles Johnston&#x27;s translation of Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Set in the 1980s, &quot;The Golden Gate&quot; follows a group of yuppies in San Francisco. The inciting action occurs when lonely protagonist John Brown learns with consternation that his friend and former love Janet Hayakawa has mischievously placed an amorous advertisement of Brown in the newspaper in his behalf; the advertisement is answered, at length, by trial-lawyer Elisabeth (&#x27;Liz&#x27;) Dorati. A short heyday follows, in which Seth introduces and develops a variety of characters united in part by their interest in self-actualization (often in the form of agriculture) and in part by closeness to Liz or John. Thereafter is depicted the progress of their marriage &quot;de facto&quot; until its dissolution, which results in the legal marriage of Liz to John&#x27;s friend Phillip (&#x27;Phil&#x27;) Weiss, and the birth of their son. Following his rejection of Liz, John finds a second paramour in Janet, until the latter and two other friends die in an automobile collision; and is himself invited to stand godfather to Liz&#x27;s son.

The novel brought its author the 1988 Sahitya Akademi Award for English, by the Sahitya Akademi, India&#x27;s National Academy of Letters.

==Background==
At the time of the novel&#x27;s composition, Seth was a graduate student in Economics at Stanford University. Seth described the origins of the novel as a &quot;pure fluke.&quot; While conducting tedious research for his dissertation, Seth would divert himself with trips to the Stanford Bookstore: On one such occasion, I found in the poetry section, two translations of &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s great novel in verse. Two translations but each of them maintained the same stanzaic form that Pushkin had used. Not because I was interested in Pushkin or Eugene Onegin, but purely because I thought, this is interesting technically that both of them should have been translated so faithfully, at least as far as the form goes. I began to compare the two translations, to get access to the original stanzas behind them, as I don’t know Russian. After a while, that exercise failed, because I found myself reading one of them for pure pleasure. I must have read it five times that month. It was addictive. And suddenly, I realized that this was the form I was looking for to tell my tales of California. The little short stories I had in my mind subsided and this more organically oriented novel came into being. I loved the form, the ability that Pushkin had to run through a wide range of emotions, from absolute flippancy to real sorrow and passages that would make you think, during and after reading it.&quot;

In addition, portions of the novel make reference to (the now defunct) &quot;Printers Inc. Bookstore&quot; and &quot;Cafe&quot; in neighboring Palo Alto, California (sonnets 8.13 to 8.16).

==Themes==
At intervals, various characters discuss arguments either against or in favor of homosexuality, Christianity, civil disobedience, feminism, and tolerance; whereas the narrative, by example of danger or anti-intellectualism, implies warning against alcoholism or carelessness, and elsewhere criticizes news-media and art-criticism for unjust treatment of their subjects.

Bickley, the objective of which was to create a new country known as the Golden Circle (), where slavery would be legal. The country would have been centered in Havana. It would have consisted of the Southern United States and a &quot;golden circle&quot; of territories in Mexico (which was to be divided into 25 new slave states), Central America, northern parts of South America, and Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, and most other islands in the Caribbean, about in diameter.

The KGC&#x27;s proposal grew out of previously unsuccessful proposals to annex Cuba (Ostend Manifesto), parts of Central America (Filibuster War), and all of Mexico (All of Mexico Movement). In Cuba, the issue was complicated by the desire of many in the colony for independence from Spain. Mexico and Central America had no interest in being part of the United States. Initially, the KGC advocated that the United States should annex the new territories to increase the number of slavery states vastly and thus the power of slaveholders.

In response to the increased anti-slavery agitation that followed the Dred Scott decision (1857), the Knights changed their position: the Southern United States should secede, forming their own confederation, and then invade and annex the other areas of the Golden Circle. The proposed new country&#x27;s northern border would roughly coincide with the Mason–Dixon line, and within it were included such cities as Washington, D.C., St. Louis, Mexico City, and Panama City. In either case, the goal was to increase enslavers&#x27; political and economic power irreversibly.

During the American Civil War, Southern sympathizers in the United States, especially that Northern United States, such as in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, and Iowa, were organized to a radical paramilitary splinter group of KGC, which was renamed, in a deliberate reference to the American Revolution, the &quot;Order of the Sons of Liberty&quot;. In some cases, such as that of Lambdin P. Milligan, Sons of Liberty members were imprisoned, deported, or even court-martialed and hanged for their activities.

Among the many acts of guerrilla warfare attributed to the Sons of Liberty were the burning of the Walnut Ridge Friends Meetinghouse in Rush County, Indiana in 1864 and the Northwest Conspiracy, which plotted regime change uprisings aimed at forcibly bringing Iowa, Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana into the Confederacy.

Although nominally secret societies, the existence of the Knights of the Golden Circle and the Order of the Sons of Liberty were never considered a secret.

==Background==
European colonialism and dependence on slavery had declined more rapidly in some countries than in others. The Spanish possessions of Cuba and Puerto Rico and the Empire of Brazil continued to depend on slavery, as did the Southern United States. In the years before the American Civil War, the rise of support for the abolition of slavery was one of several divisive issues in the United States. The slave population there had continued to grow due to natural increase even after the ban on international trade. It was concentrated in the Deep South on large plantations devoted to cotton and sugar cane commodity crops. Still, it was the basis of agricultural and other labor throughout the southern states.

==Early history==
George W. L. Bickley, a doctor, editor, and adventurer who was born in Indiana and lived in Cincinnati, Ohio, founded the association, organizing the first &quot;castle,&quot; or local branch, in Cincinnati in 1854, although records of the KGC convention held in 1860 state that the organization &quot;originated at Lexington, Kentucky, on the fourth day of July 1854, by five gentlemen who came together on a call made by Gen. George Bickley&quot;. Hounded by creditors, Bickley left Cincinnati in the late 1850s and traveled through the eastern and southern United States, promoting an armed expedition to Mexico. The group&#x27;s original goal was to provide a force to colonize the northern part of Mexico and the West Indies and add them to the U.S. as states, which would extend the power of the slavery states, which was felt to be jeopardized by the power and population of the northern states. The membership, scattered from New York to California and into Latin America, was never large. Bickley received little encouragement on this journey, except in Texas, since attention in the South was focused on the 1860 United States presidential election and the possible election of an enslaver, John C. Breckinridge.

In August 1861, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the order as a successor to the Order of the Lone Star, which had been organized to conquer Cuba and Nicaragua, succeeding in the latter cause in 1856 under William Walker before being driven out by a coalition of neighboring states. At that time, the order&#x27;s prime objective was said to be to raise an army of 16,000 men to conquer and &quot;Southernize&quot; Mexico, which meant making slavery, not legal in Mexico, again legal while supporting the &quot;Knights of the Columbian Star&quot;—those in the KGC&#x27;s highest level of membership—for public office.

In the North, the KGC was cited by a Senator from Wisconsin as an exemplar of &quot;Southern fanaticism&quot;, an exposé of the organization was published in Indiana in 1861, and its secret rituals were publicized in Boston in that year as well. Some members active in northern states, such as Illinois, were accused of anti-Union activities after the Civil War began in 1861.

===Requirements and rituals===
The initiation ritual of the KGC began: &quot;the first field of our operations is in Mexico; but we hold it to be our duty to offer our services to any Southern State to repel a Northern army ... The Southern States must foster any scheme having for its object the Americanization and Southernization of Mexico. ...&quot; Using numbers to represent important phrases, it was specified that candidates &quot;must have been born in a Slave State or if in a Free State he must be citizen; a Protestant and a Slaveholder. A candidate who was born in a Slave State need not be a Slaveholder provided he can give Evidence of character as a Southern man.&quot; Initiates had to swear that &quot;should my State or any other Southern State be invaded by Abolitionists I will muster the largest force I can, and go to the scene of the danger.&quot;

==Plans to seize Lincoln and inaugurate Breckinridge as president==
Several members of President James Buchanan&#x27;s administration were members of the order, as well as Virginia&#x27;s secessionist Senator James M. Mason. The Secretary of War, John Floyd and of Treasury, Howell Cobb, were members of the circle, in addition to Vice President John Breckinridge. Floyd received instructions from the Order to &quot;seize Navy-yards, Forts, etc. while KGC members were still Cabinet officers and Senators&quot;. The plan was to prevent Lincoln from reaching Washington by capturing him in Baltimore. Then, they would occupy the District of Columbia and install Breckinridge as president instead of Lincoln. Floyd used his position as Secretary of War to move munitions and men to the South toward the end of Buchanan&#x27;s presidency. His plot was discovered and led to greater distrust of secret societies and Copperheads in general. This distrust resulted from a confirmed plot to overthrow the U.S. government rather than general discontent.

Robert Barnwell Rhett, who has been called &quot;the father of secession&quot;, said a few days after Lincoln&#x27;s election:
==American Civil War==
===Southwest===
In 1859, future Confederate States Army brigadier general Elkanah Greer established KGC castles in East Texas and Louisiana. Although a Unionist, United States Senator Sam Houston introduced a resolution in the U.S. Senate in 1858 for the &quot;United States to declare and maintain an efficient protectorate over the States of Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and San Salvador.&quot; This measure, which supported the goal of the KGC, failed to be adopted. In the spring of 1860, Elkanah Greer had become general and grand commander of 4,000 Military Knights in the KGC&#x27;s Texas division of 21 castles. The Texas KGC supported President of the United States James Buchanan&#x27;s policy of, and draft treaty for, protecting routes for U.S. commerce across Mexico, which also failed to be approved by the U.S. Senate.

With the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States, the Texas KGC changed its emphasis from a plan to expand U.S. territory into Mexico to focus its efforts on providing support for the Southern States&#x27; declared secession from the United States. On February 15, 1861, Ben McCulloch, United States Marshal and former Texas Ranger, began marching toward the U.S. Army arsenal at San Antonio, Texas, with a cavalry force of about 550 men, about 150 of whom were Knights of the Golden Circle (KGC) from six castles. As volunteers continued to join McCulloch the following day, United States Army Brevet Maj. Gen. David E. Twiggs surrendered the arsenal peacefully to the secessionists. Twiggs was appointed a major general in the Confederate States Army on May 22, 1861.

KGC members also figured prominently among those who, in 1861, joined Lt. Col. John Robert Baylor in his temporarily successful takeover of southern New Mexico Territory. In May 1861, members of the KGC and the Confederate Rangers attacked a building that housed a pro-Union newspaper, the &quot;Alamo Express,&quot; owned by J. P. Newcomb, and burned it down. Other KGC members followed Brig. Gen. Henry Hopkins Sibley on the 1862 New Mexico Campaign, which sought to bring the New Mexico Territory into the Confederate fold. Both Baylor and Trevanion Teel, Sibley&#x27;s captain of artillery, had been among the KGC members who rode with Ben McCulloch.

===North===
In early 1862, Radical Republicans in the Senate, aided by Secretary of State William H. Seward, suggested that former president Franklin Pierce, who was exceedingly critical of the Lincoln administration&#x27;s war policies, was an active member of the Knights of the Golden Circle. In an angry letter to Seward, Pierce denied that he knew anything about the KGC and demanded that his letter be made public. California Senator Milton Latham subsequently did so when he entered the entire PierceSeward correspondence into the &quot;Congressional Globe&quot;.

Appealing to the Confederacy&#x27;s friends in both the North and the border southern states, the Order spread to Kentucky and Tennessee, as well as the southern parts of such Union states as Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, and Missouri. It became strongest among Copperheads, who were Democrats who wanted to end the Civil War via settlement with the South. Some supported slavery, and others were worried about the power of the federal government. In the summer of 1863, Congress authorized a military draft, which the administration soon put into operation. Leaders of the Democratic Party opposed to Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s administration denounced the draft and other wartime measures, such as the arrest of seditious persons and the president&#x27;s temporary suspension of the writ of &quot;habeas corpus.&quot;

During the 1863 Gettysburg Campaign, scam artists in south-central Pennsylvania sold Pennsylvania Dutch farmers $1 (~$ in ) paper tickets purported to be from the Knights of the Golden Circle. Along with a series of secret hand gestures, these tickets were supposed to protect the horses and other possessions of ticket holders from seizure by invading Confederate soldiers. When Confederate Maj. Gen. Jubal Early&#x27;s infantry division passed through York County, Pennsylvania, they took what they needed anyway. They often paid with Confederate States dollars or with drafts on the Confederate government. The Confederate cavalry commander J.E.B. Stuart also reported the alleged KGC tickets when documenting the campaign.

That same year, Asbury Harpending and California members of the Knights of the Golden Circle in San Francisco outfitted the schooner &quot;J. M. Chapman&quot; as a Confederate privateer in San Francisco Bay, with the object of raiding commerce on the Pacific Coast and capturing gold shipments to the East Coast. Their attempt was detected and they were seized on the night of their intended departure.
In late 1863, the KGC reorganized as the Order of American Knights. In 1864, it became the Order of the Sons of Liberty, with the Ohio politician Clement L. Vallandigham, the most prominent of the Copperheads, as its supreme commander. In most areas, only a minority of its membership was radical enough to discourage enlistments, resist the draft, and shield deserters. The KGC held numerous peace meetings. A few agitators, some encouraged by Southern money, talked of a revolt in the Old Northwest intending to end the war.

==Influence==
In &quot;The Idea of a Southern Nation&quot; (1979), historian John McCardell called the KGC &quot;that most bizarre offshoot of Southern expansionism.&quot; He wrote: In reality, the influence of the K.G.C. was practically nonexistent. ... Viewed in isolation, the K.G.C. would seem to be an aberration hardly deserving attention. But viewed in the context of the developments of the 1850s, the organization seems perhaps the logical extension of Southern expansionist rhetoric.&quot;

==Survival conspiracy theory==
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that one theory, among many, on the origin of the Saddle Ridge Hoard of gold coins is that it was cached by the KGC, which &quot;some believe buried millions in ill-gotten gold across a dozen states to finance a second Civil War&quot;.

* In the Southern Victory Series by Harry Turtledove, the Confederacy&#x27;s post-war territorial expansion into Latin America amounts only to the purchase of Cuba from Spain in 1878 and the purchase of Sonora and Chihuahua from the Second Mexican Empire in 1881, to construct a transcontinental railway and establish a Confederate naval presence in the Pacific. In the 1890s, the Confederacy attempted to build the Panama Canal but was dissuaded by an ultimatum from Union President Alfred Thayer Mahan.

<text>The Tenshō embassy (Japanese: 天正の使節, named after the Tenshō Era in which the embassy took place) was an embassy sent by the Japanese Christian Lord Ōtomo Sōrin to the pope and the kings of Europe in 1582. The embassy was led by Mancio Itō (伊東 マンショ &quot;Itō Mansho&quot;, 1570–1612), a Japanese nobleman, who was the first official Japanese emissary to Europe.

==Embassy==
The idea of sending a Japanese embassy to Europe was originally conceived by the Jesuit Alessandro Valignano, and sponsored by the three Kirishitan &quot;daimyōs&quot; Ōmura Sumitada (1533–1587), Ōtomo Sōrin (1530–1587), and Arima Harunobu (1567–1612). Mancio Itō was chosen to act as a spokesman for the group dispatched by Ōtomo Sōrin, who was daimyō of the Bungo Province on Kyūshū and a close relative of Mancio&#x27;s father; Shurinosuke Itō. On February 20, 1582, Mancio Itō left Nagasaki in company with three other noblemen: 
* Miguel Chijiwa (千々石 ミゲル &quot;Chijiwa Migeru&quot;)
* Julião Nakaura (中浦 ジュリアン &quot;Nakaura Jurian&quot;)
* Martinho Hara (原 マルチノ &quot;Hara Maruchino&quot;)

They were accompanied by two servants, their tutor and interpreter Diogo de Mesquita, and their mentor Valignano, who only accompanied them as far as Goa in Portuguese India, where he was to take up new responsibilities. They spent nine months visiting the Portuguese territories of Macau, Kochi, Madagascar and Goa on their way to Lisbon, where they arrived on 11 August 1584. From there, the ambassadors went on to Madrid and then to Rome, which were the two main goals of their journey. In Spain they visited Talavera de la Reina, Toledo, Madrid, where they met with Philip II who was king of Spain and Portugal. They visit El Escorial monastery, the Alcalá University, Murcia and Alicante. In Rome, Mancio Itō became an honorary citizen and taken into the ranks of European nobility with the title &quot;Cavaliere di Speron d&#x27;oro&quot; (&quot;Knight of the Golden Spur&quot;). During their stay in Europe, they met with King Philip II of Spain, Francesco I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, Pope Gregory XIII, and his successor Pope Sixtus V.
The ambassadors arrived back in Japan on July 21, 1590. On their eight-year-long voyage they had been instructed to take notes. These notes provided the basis for the &quot;De Missione Legatorum Iaponensium ad Romanam Curiam&quot; (&quot;The Mission of the Japanese Legates to the Roman Curia&quot;), a Macau-based writing by Jesuit Duarte de Sande published in 1590. According to Derek Massarella, &quot;Valignano conceived the idea of a book based on the boys’ travels, one that could also be used for teaching purposes in Jesuit colleges in Japan,&quot; but &quot;despite its authors’ intentions,&quot; &quot;De Missione&quot; &quot;made no lasting impact on Japanese perceptions of Europe.

The four were subsequently ordained as the first Japanese Jesuit fathers by Alessandro Valignano.

Mancio Itō died in Nagasaki on November 13, 1612. Martinho Hara was banished from Japan by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1614, and acted in Macau. He died in Macau on October 23, 1629. Miguel Chijiwa left the Society of Jesus before 1601, and died in Nagasaki on January 23, 1633. Although he is generally believed to have abandoned Christianity, the discovery of what appear to be rosary beads in his grave in 2017 place this in some doubt. Julião Nakaura was caught by the Tokugawa shogunate, and died a martyr by torture in Nagasaki on November 21, 1633. He was beatified on November 24, 2008.

<doc id="1205533" wikidata="Q7195435" url="?curid=1205533" title="Pineapple Primary">
<text>The Pineapple Primary was the name given to the primary election held in Illinois on April 10, 1928. The campaign was marked by numerous acts of violence, mostly in Chicago and elsewhere in Cook County. In the six months prior to the primary election, 62 bombings took place in the city, and at least two politicians were killed. The term &quot;Pineapple Primary&quot; originates with the contemporary slang term &quot;pineapple&quot; to describe a hand grenade.

Underlying the violent campaign was the lucrative Prohibition-era bootlegging trade, a corrupt city government, politicians with ties to organized crime, and a deep-seated and bitter political rivalry between several of the Illinois Republican candidates. The threat of election day violence was so severe that Chicago&#x27;s U.S. Marshal requested the U.S. Attorney General for authority to deputize 500 additional federal marshals to assure the electorate to cast their ballots in safety.

==Background==
The Pineapple Primary took place in 1928, during the administration of the notoriously corrupt Chicago Mayor William Hale (&quot;Big Bill&quot;) Thompson, a Republican. Thompson had served two corruption-marred terms as mayor in 1915 and 1919. Following exposure of several scandals tied to his political organization, Thompson sat out the 1923 contest, with the result that reformer William E. Dever, a Democrat, was elected mayor.

After four years away from City Hall, Thompson cast his hat into the ring for the 1927 mayoral campaign, capitalizing on public displeasure with the zealous enforcement of the Prohibition laws under Dever. The always-bombastic Thompson campaigned for a wide open town, at one time hinting that he&#x27;d reopen illegal saloons closed by Dever&#x27;s police. Such a proclamation helped Thompson&#x27;s campaign gain the support of mobster Al Capone. Thompson&#x27;s campaign allegedly accepted a contribution of $250,000 ($ in 2017) from the gangster. In the 1927 mayoral race, Thompson beat Dever by a relatively slim margin.

Once he returned to City Hall in the spring of 1927, Thompson turned the city&#x27;s resources away from fighting the bootleggers, and toward fighting those who advocated reforming the city government.

==The competing factions==
Chicago Mayor &quot;Big Bill&quot; Thompson was the leader of one faction of the state Republican Party. Leading the opposition to the Thompson camp was former Governor and incumbent U.S. Senator Charles Deneen. Thompson and Deneen had been rivals for control of the Illinois Republican Party, and the bad blood between the two politicians dated at least as far back as the 1904 state convention.

Neither Thompson nor Deneen themselves were standing for election to their respective offices during the 1928 campaign. Deneen&#x27;s faction was considered less corrupt than the Thompson faction, but Thompson&#x27;s faction had the advantage of his Cook County political organization. At the time of the campaign, Thompson&#x27;s political organization controlled every office in the city, county, and state governments except for one municipal clerkship and the office of Secretary of State, the latter seat held by Emmerson.

The State&#x27;s Attorney for Cook County prosecutes public corruption cases in Cook County. Thompson threatened to resign if Crowe lost the state&#x27;s attorney. &quot;I don&#x27;t have to stand this abuse,&quot; Thompson quipped. Most of Chicago&#x27;s newspapers, however, urged for Crowe&#x27;s defeat, one news account describing his office as &quot;the overlordship of Chicago crime and vice.&quot;

The Deneen faction charged that Thompson and Crowe had done little to combat crime, observing that none of the bombings had led to a conviction, and none of the shotgun or machine gun murders during the months prior to the election had been solved. Deneen&#x27;s forces proclaimed that, if elected, they would improve conditions in Chicago. Small, Thompson, and Crowe, accused the Deneen faction of exaggerating the amount of crime, and accused their opponents of setting bombs in their own homes, and for sending Federal prohibition agents to Chicago to discredit Thompson.

Most of Chicago&#x27;s newspapers supported the reformers in the Deneen faction. Some out-of-town papers were less sanguine; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; lamented that the primary was fundamentally a choice between &quot;which particular gang [was] going to harvest the $100 million a year of graft&quot; flowing from liquor bootlegging and gambling.

The Democrats had few primary contests during the 1928 election, and contented themselves with a few jabs at the Republicans. They were generally considered to have little to lose, given the enmity and strife taking place in the Republican campaign.

==Response to the violence==
As the violence heightened, the focus of the voters turned to crime and Prohibition. Chicago&#x27;s violent campaign drew attention and scorn from out-of-town newspapers. In the days before the election, a Federal grand jury was sworn in with instructions that it would be called upon to protect the voters of Chicago under the federal statutes about intimidation or conspiracy to prevent a citizen from exercising his right to vote. Special federal Prohibition officers swarmed into the city after the Deneen and Swanson bombings, and a city court bailiff who was a Thompson supporter was shot and wounded by a federal agent during a raid on a saloon.

Under a finding by the Illinois Supreme Court, election judges were ruled as officers of the county court, and that any election judge who tampered with votes or intimidated voters could be jailed for contempt. Under the same court decision, some 3,000 persons drawn from the ranks of the local bar association and other civic organizations were deputized as pollwatchers, and were empowered to compel a policeman to arrest anyone involved in vote fraud. The same ruling deprived Governor Small from the power to pardon politicians arrested under this contempt ruling. This unprecedented ruling was estimated to have the potential to cut the stolen votes from about 75,000 to 25,000 within Cook County.

==Esposito slaying==
On March 21, Giuseppe &quot;Diamond Joe&quot; Esposito was shot and killed on the street near his home at 800 S. Oakley Blvd. Esposito was the Republican ward committeeman for the 25th Ward, a leader of his ward&#x27;s Italian community, and was linked to organized crime. According to contemporary accounts, Esposito was reputed to provide protection for gamblers and was tied to bootlegging as well as shootings and bombings, but also Esposito had friends among the city and state governments.

Esposito had received repeated warnings that he was marked for death unless he fled Chicago. Esposito was struck down after a day of campaigning within sight of his home while in the company of his bodyguards. While passing the house at 806 S. Oakley Blvd., a volley of shots rang out from a passing automobile. The shots were heard by Esposito&#x27;s wife, who ran the hundred feet from her home to the side of her dying husband. Two double-barrel shotguns and a revolver were found at the crime scene.

Neither of his bodyguards were struck – they dropped to the ground at the first sound of shots – and police suspected that Esposito may have been set up by his bodyguards. Shortly after Esposito&#x27;s slaying, a witness to the murder was found shot to death. The bodyguards were interrogated and released, and no one was ever charged with Esposito&#x27;s killing.

==Deneen and Swanson bombings==
On the night of March 26, a bomb went off at Senator Deneen&#x27;s residence at 457 W. 61st Place, damaging the front porch and breaking windows in the Deneen house and elsewhere in the vicinity. Deneen was not home at the time of the blast, having departed for Washington, D.C. by train earlier in the day after attending Esposito&#x27;s funeral. Deneen and Esposito were political allies despite Deneen&#x27;s reputation as a political reformer and Esposito&#x27;s ties to organized crime. Almost at the same time as the Deneen house was bombed, a bomb was thrown at the residence of State&#x27;s Attorney candidate Swanson, a Deneen ally, at 7217 Crandon Ave. The bomb caused severe damage but narrowly missed Swanson.

In the aftermath of the bombing, Senator Deneen stated from Washington that the bombings were &quot;the work of organized and protected [criminals] ... in their desperate effort to retain political control.&quot; State&#x27;s Attorney Crowe responded that he was satisfied that the &quot;bombings were done by Deneen forces, and done mainly to discredit Mayor Thompson and myself.&quot;

==Granady murder==
On the day of the primary, Octavius C. Granady, a candidate for committeeman in the 20th ward, was chased in his car and killed. He was an Afro Caribbean attorney from St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands who was running on a reform platform.

==Outcome==
The voters sided with Deneen&#x27;s slate, with all three of his candidates winning the Primary. Louis Emmerson defeated Len Small by 400,000 votes and went on to win the Governor&#x27;s office. John Swanson defeated Crowe by 120,000. The &quot;Tribune&quot; attributed his win to Democrats crossing over to vote Republican following the earlier bombings. Otis Glenn defeated Small for the Senate seat. Glenn&#x27;s victory spelled the end of Smith&#x27;s convoluted attempts to be seated in the Senate following an earlier appointment that the Senate denied.

<text>Maria Cristina Falls is a waterfall of the Agus River in the Northern Mindanao region of the Philippines. It is sometimes called the &quot;twin falls&quot; as the flow is separated by a rock at the brink of the waterfall. The name come from the Spanish queen, Maria Christina of Austria. It is located 9.3 kilometers away southwest of Iligan City at the boundaries of Barangays Maria Cristina, Ditucalan, and Buru-un. Known for its natural grandeur, the high waterfall is also the primary source of electric power for the city&#x27;s industries, being harnessed by the Agus VI Hydroelectric Plant.

==Agus VI hydroelectric plant==
Maria Cristina Falls powers the Agus VI Hydroelectric Plant, one of the several hydroelectric plants that harness Agus River. The power plant has a 200 MW potential capacity supplied by a water flow of about 130 cubic meters per second.

Agus VI is operated by the National Power Corporation. It was authorized by President Elpidio Quirino was later commissioned on May 31, 1953. Under President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&#x27;s Mindanao Super Region development plan, the Agus VI is planned to undergo a 1.856-billion-peso upgrading project.

<text>Satoru Okada (岡田 智 &quot;Okada Satoru&quot;, born January 10, 1947) is the former general manager of Nintendo Research &amp; Engineering, the division designing and developing Nintendo handheld game consoles. He is best known for creating the original Game Boy and its successors. He was also assistant producer and director of and contributor to several Nintendo games, notably &quot;Metroid&quot;, released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986.

Okada entered Nintendo in 1969 and went on to work as an engineer at Nintendo Research &amp; Development 1 with Gunpei Yokoi, who developed the hugely successful Game &amp; Watch and Game Boy handheld game consoles. In 1996, Yokoi left Nintendo which caused R&amp;D1 to split, its engineers creating a portable hardware division of which Okada became the general manager. His team lacked Yokoi but nevertheless developed hugely successful handheld consoles: the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP and Nintendo DS. Okada initially opposed the Nintendo DS&#x27; dual-screen design but was overruled by Hiroshi Yamauchi.

Okada also participated in the development of several Nintendo games, as the chief director of &quot;Metroid&quot;, director of &quot;Kid Icarus&quot;, &quot;Solar Striker&quot; (along with Keisuke Terasaki) and &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; and contributed to many other titles.

Okada retired from Nintendo in January 2012.

<text>Highclere Castle is a Grade I listed country house built in 1679 and largely renovated in the 1840s, with a park designed by Capability Brown in the 18th century. The estate is in Highclere in Hampshire, England, about south of Newbury, Berkshire, and north of Andover, Hampshire. The 19th-century renovation is in a Jacobethan and Italianate style produced by architect Charles Barry. It is the country seat of the Earls of Carnarvon, a branch of the Anglo-Welsh Herbert family.

Highclere Castle has been used as a filming location for several films and television series, including 1990s comedy series &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot;, and achieved international fame as the main location for the ITV historical drama series &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; (2010–15) and the 2019 and 2022 films based on it.

The house, Egyptian exhibition, and gardens are open to the public for self-guided tours during the summer months and at other times during the rest of the year, such as Christmas and Easter. The house also holds ticketed events, such as the Battle Proms picnic concert, and special guided tours throughout the year.

==History==

===Early years===
The first written records about the estate are dated 749, when an Anglo-Saxon king granted the estate to the Bishops of Winchester. The original site was also recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. In the late 14th century William of Wykeham, Bishop of Winchester, built a medieval palace (bishop&#x27;s residence) and gardens in the park. An itinerary of King Edward II lists him as spending 2 September 1320 with Rigaud of Assier, the Bishop of Winchester, at Bishop&#x27;s Clere, alias Highclere. The same tour has him on 31 August 1320 at Sandleford Priory, where he apparently stayed for the night, and on 29 and 30 August he was at Crookham, Berkshire. In 1551 during the English Reformation King Edward VI confiscated the property from the Church of England.

===Robert Sawyer===
Originally granted by the king to the Fitzwilliam family, Highclere Castle had several owners during the next 125 years.

The palace was rebuilt as Place House in 1679 when it was purchased by Sir Robert Sawyer, the Attorney General to Charles II and James II, who was a lawyer, MP, Speaker, and college friend of Samuel Pepys. In 1692, Sawyer bequeathed the mansion at Highclere to his only daughter, Margaret Sawyer, the first wife of the 8th Earl of Pembroke, Thomas Herbert. Their second son, Robert Sawyer Herbert, inherited Highclere, began its portrait collection and created the garden temples. His nephew and heir Henry Herbert was created Baron Porchester and later Earl of Carnarvon by George III.

===Milles and Pococke families===
In 1680 Sir Robert Sawyer presented the living of Highclere to the Rev. Isaac Milles (1638–1720) the elder, who remained there till his death. White Oak was the parsonage where Milles took pupils, including the many children of Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke, who was by marriage the new proprietor of Highclere. The Rev. Isaac Milles the younger (fl. 1701–1727) carried on his father&#x27;s school at Highclere. Elizabeth, the daughter of Milles the younger, married Reverend Richard Pococke LL.B. (1660–1710) and had the Rt. Rev. Richard Pococke (1704–1765), who, having been educated by his grandfather Milles at his school at Highclere rectory, went on to become domestic chaplain to Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, and then Bishop of Ossory and Meath, as well as a renowned travel writer and orientalist.

Bishop Pococke was one of the first to collect seeds of the Cedar of Lebanon, which he did during his tour of Lebanon in 1738. Some of these seeds germinated and grew at Highclere and Wilton House, but probably also at nearby Sandleford and his family&#x27;s own Newtown House, Hampshire.

Coincidentally, the apparently unrelated (and earlier) Rev. Edward Pococke (1604–1691), another orientalist, was sometime vicar of Chieveley and then rector of Childrey (both nearby in Berkshire), and was an even earlier importer of the cedar. And of his six sons, the eldest, Edward Pococke (1648–1727) was chaplain to the Earl of Pembroke, and rector of Minall or Mildenhall, Wiltshire (1692), and canon of Salisbury (1675).

===William Cobbett&#x27;s description===
William Cobbett (1763–1835) in his journal of 2 November 1821, while at Hurstbourne Tarrant wrote:
I came from Berghclere this morning, and through the park of Lord Caernarvon, at Highclere. It is a fine season to look at woods. The oaks are still covered, the beeches in their best dress, the elms yet pretty green, and the beautiful ashes only beginning to turn off. This is, according to my fancy, the prettiest park that I have ever seen. A great variety of hill and dell. A good deal of water, and this, in one part, only wants the colours of American trees to make it look like a creek; for the water runs along at the foot of a steepish hill, thickly covered with trees, and the branches of the lowermost trees hang down into the water and hide the bank completely.

I like this place better than Fonthill, Blenheim, Stowe, or any other gentleman&#x27;s grounds that I have seen. The house I did not care about, though it appears to be large enough to hold half a village. The trees are very good, and the woods would be handsomer if the larches and firs were burnt, for which only they are fit. The great beauty of the place is, the lofty downs, as steep, in some places, as the roof of a house, which form a sort of boundary, in the form of a part of a crescent, to about a third part of the park, and then slope off and get more distant, for about half another third part. A part of these downs is covered with trees, chiefly beech, the colour of which, at this season, forms a most beautiful contrast with that of the down itself, which is so green and so smooth! From the vale in the park, along which we rode, we looked apparently almost perpendicularly up at the downs, where the trees have extended themselves by seed more in some places than others, and thereby formed numerous salient parts of various forms, and, of course, as many and as variously formed glades. These, which are always so beautiful in forests and parks, are peculiarly beautiful in this lofty situation and with verdure so smooth as that of these chalky downs.

Our horses beat up a score or two of hares as we crossed the park; and, though we met with no gothic arches made of Scotch-fir, we saw something a great deal better; namely, about forty cows, the most beautiful that I ever saw, as to colour at least. They appear to be of the Galway-breed. They are called, in this country, Lord Caernarvon&#x27;s breed. They have no horns, and their colour is a ground of white with black or red spots, these spots being from the size of a plate to that of a crown-piece; and some of them have no small spots. These cattle were lying down together in the space of about an acre of ground: they were in excellent condition, and so fine a sight of the kind I never saw.
===19th century===
The house was then a square, classical mansion, but, after an abortive exterior remodelling by Thomas Hopper in Greek Revival style for the second Earl, it was remodelled and largely rebuilt for the third Earl following a design by Sir Charles Barry in 1842–49 during his construction of the Houses of Parliament. It is in the Jacobethan style and faced in Bath stone, reflecting the Victorian revival of English architecture of the late 16th century and early 17th century, when Tudor architecture was being challenged by newly arrived Renaissance architecture influences.

During the 19th century, there was a Renaissance Revival movement, of which Sir Charles Barry was an exponent, Barry described the style of Highclere as Anglo-Italian. Barry had been inspired to become an architect by the Renaissance architecture of Italy and was very proficient at working in the Renaissance-based style that became known in the 19th century as Italianate architecture. At Highclere, however, he worked in the Jacobethan style, but added to it some of the motifs of the Italianate style. This is particularly noticeable in the towers, which are slimmer and more refined than those of Mentmore Towers, the other great Jacobethan house built in the same era. Barry produced an alternative design in a more purely Italian Renaissance style, which was rejected by Lord Carnarvon. The external walls are decorated with strapwork designs typical of Northern European Renaissance architecture. The Italian Renaissance theme is more evident in the interiors. In the saloon, in an attempt to resemble a medieval English great hall, Barry&#x27;s assistant Thomas Allom introduced a Gothic influence evident in the points rather than curves of the arches, and the mock-hammerbeam roof.

Although the exterior of the north, east and south sides were completed before the 3rd Earl died in 1849 and Sir Charles Barry died in 1860, the interior and the west wing (designated as servants&#x27; quarters) were far from complete. The 4th Earl turned to the architect Thomas Allom, who had worked with Barry, to supervise work on the interior of the castle, which was completed in 1878. The 1st Earl had his park laid out according to a design by Capability Brown in 1774–1777, moving the village in the process—the remains of the church of 1689 are at the north-west corner of the castle. The Lebanon Cedars are believed to be descended from seeds brought to England from Lebanon by the 17th-century seed collector Edward Pococke.

====The founding of Canada====
In the 1860s, the 4th Earl drafted the British North America Act of 1867 at the castle alongside the first Prime Minister of Canada John A. Macdonald, George-Étienne Cartier and Alexander Tilloch Galt, who signed the visitor book in 1866. The 4th Earl presented the Act to Parliament in February 1867. The passage of the Act later that year represented the legal expression of Canadian Confederation and the establishment of Canada in its present institutional form; the Act forms the framework of the Constitution of Canada to this day. After the discovery of documents between him and John A. Macdonald, showing eight weeks of nearly daily correspondence, Janice Charette, the Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, recognised the central role of the 4th Earl in the creation of Canada by planting a maple tree on the lawn on 11 January 2018.

===20th century===
George Herbert, the 5th Earl married the rich heiress Almina Wombwell, the daughter of the bank heir Alfred de Rothschild (1842-1918), a son of Lionel de Rothschild. Thus Lord Carnarvon received a very large dowry. Rothschild &quot;père&quot; also made her the heiress to his vast fortune.

At the beginning of World War I, a hospital for war wounded was opened at Highclere Castle, with Lady Carnarvon helping with the organisation and assisting as a nurse.

The castle became home to Egyptian artefacts after the 5th Earl, an enthusiastic amateur Egyptologist, sponsored the excavation of nobles&#x27; tombs in Deir el-Bahari (Thebes) in 1907, and employed archaeologist Howard Carter in the search for the tomb of Tutankhamun.

The Egyptian Museum at Highclere Castle was established after the discovery of Tutankhamen&#x27;s tomb, in 1922. After the death of the 5th Earl in 1923, Lady Carnarvon continued to support Howard Carter and his team. She resided at Highclere but spent much of her time in Egypt supporting the famous excavations. Her legacy is one of the less noted in the history of Egyptology, but her contribution is immeasurable.

During World War II the castle housed evacuee children. Some allied aircraft crashed onto the estate, sections of a downed B-17 Flying Fortress are held at the castle.

===21st century===
In the 21st century Lord and Lady Carnarvon undertook repairs to the roof. In 2007, they created the Egyptian Exhibition, which lies in the cellars of the castle and tells the story of the discovery of Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb by the 5th Earl. By 2009, the castle was again in need of major repairs, with only the ground and first floors remaining usable. Water damage had caused stonework to crumble and ceilings to collapse; at least 50 rooms were uninhabitable. The 8th Earl and his family were living in a &quot;modest cottage in the grounds&quot;; he said a lack of repair by his ancestors caused the castle&#x27;s long-term problems. Repairs needed for the entire estate were estimated to cost around £12 million, £1.8 million of which was urgently needed just for the castle.

The castle was used as the main filming location for the ITV/PBS drama series &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, which brought the castle international fame. The increased numbers of visitors to the castle have allowed for repairs on Highclere&#x27;s turrets and its interior.
The family now live in Highclere Castle at various times throughout the year, but return to their cottage when the castle is open to the public.

==Highclere Park==

The parkland surrounding the castle is listed Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens and is listed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

The park is the earliest documented estate in Hampshire, having been given in 749 to the Church of Winchester as a deer park. In 1706, under the ownership of Robert Sawyer Herbert, the park became a rococo landscape of walks. Then in 1770 it became a landscaped park designed by Capability Brown.

In 1991 Highclere Park was registered as an SSSI. The park&#x27;s listing as an SSSI is due to a mixture of habitats that contain many regional uncommon plants, and its diverse range of lichen.

==Details==
There are various follies on the estate. To the east of the house is the Temple of Diana, erected before 1743 with Ionic order columns from Devonshire House in Piccadilly, which had burnt in 1733, and remodelled by Barry. &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; is a folly about 60 feet high on Sidown Hill, built in 1749 by Hon. Robert Sawyer Herbert (d. 1769). Other 18th-century follies that can be found on the grounds of the estate include Milford Lake House and Jackdaw&#x27;s Castle, both attributed to the architect earl of Pembroke, brother of the owner, and the Etruscan Temple.

The 2nd Earl of Carnarvon was a passionate horticulturalist and was vice-president of the Royal Horticultural Society from 1829 until his death in 1833. Many hybrids and cultivars of ornamental plants were produced on the castle grounds during that time. The hybrid azalea &quot;Rhododendron × altaclerense&quot; was first produced on the castle grounds in 1826, with over 25 Highclere azalea cultivars later being produced. The hybrid holly &quot;Ilex x altaclerensis&quot; (Highclere holly) was developed here in 1835 by hybridising the Madeiran &quot;Ilex perado&quot; (grown in a greenhouse) with the local native &quot;Ilex aquifolium&quot;. This hybrid and its offspring are still used as garden plants almost 200 years later.

Highclere Castle launched its own gin brand in 2019 called Highclere Castle Gin. It is the first gin to earn a perfect score, 100 points from the Major League Spirits Association (MLSA)

The castle, Egyptian exhibition and gardens are open to the public during the summer months and at other times during the rest of the year. The castle also holds special ticketed events throughout the year.

==As film and television location==
==As event venue==
In 2007, the grounds were the venue for the Countryside Rocks concert, to raise funds for the UK rural advocacy organisation Countryside Alliance, featuring Bryan Ferry, Steve Winwood, Eric Clapton, Steve Harley and Kenney Jones. As of March 2023, the castle will no longer be used to host large weddings due to staffing shortages. &quot;We have stopped being able to offer any weddings of any substantial size because of Brexit,&quot; the owner told Reuters.

<doc id="1205574" wikidata="Q1052150" url="?curid=1205574" title="Cc65">
<text>cc65 is a cross development package for 6502 and 65C02 targets, including a macro assembler, a C cross compiler, linker, librarian and several other tools.

==Overview==
cc65 is based on a native C compiler that was originally adapted for the Atari 8-bit computers by John R. Dunning in 1989, which originated as a Small-C descendant. It has several extensions, and some of the limits of the original Small C compiler are gone.

The toolkit has largely been expanded by Ullrich von Bassewitz and other contributors. The actual cc65 compiler, a complete set of binary tools (assembler, linker, etc.) and runtime library are under a license identical to zlib&#x27;s.

The compiler itself comes close to ANSI C compatibility, while C library features depend on the target platform&#x27;s hardware. stdio is supported on many platforms, as is Borland-style screen handling. GEOS is also supported on the Commodore 64 and the Apple II. The library supports many of the Commodore platforms (C64, C128, C16/116/Plus/4, P500 and 600/700 family), Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, Oric Atmos, Nintendo Entertainment System, Watara Supervision game console, Synertek Systems SYM-1 and Ohio Scientific Challenger 1P.

Officially supported host systems include Linux, Microsoft Windows, MS-DOS and OS/2, but the source code itself has been reported to work almost unmodified on many platforms beside these.

The ca65 macro assembler supports 6502, 65C02, and 65C816 processors, and can be used standalone without the C compiler.

==Supported API==

===static===
*conio (text-based console I/O non-scrolling)
*dio (block-oriented disk I/O bypassing the file system)

===dynamic===
*em (expanded memory, used for all kinds of memory beyond the 6502&#x27;s 64K barrier, similar EMS)
*joystick (relative input devices)
*mouse (absolute input devices)
*serial (communication)
*tgi (2D graphics primitives inspired by BGI)

Note: For static libraries, &quot;Yes&quot; means the feature is available. For dynamic libraries, the columns list the number of available drivers.

<doc id="1205575" wikidata="Q330039" url="?curid=1205575" title="Cape Verde national football team">
<text>The Cape Verde national football team (Portuguese: ; recognized as Cabo Verde by FIFA) represents Cape Verde in men&#x27;s international football, and is controlled by the Cape Verdean Football Federation. The team has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup, but has qualified for four Africa Cup of Nations tournaments, in 2013, 2015, 2021 and 2023. The team achieved their best result in 2023 after making it past the first round of the knockout stage.

==History==

===Overview===
Cape Verde became independent from Portugal in 1975. The national team&#x27;s first international was a 1–0 defeat to Guinea on 29 May 1978, in a tournament in Guinea-Bissau. The Cape Verdean Football Federation was formed in 1982, and joined FIFA in 1986.

Cape Verdeans abroad, who are more numerous than the population of the islands themselves, are a major source of players for the national team. Most of Cape Verde&#x27;s current international footballers play outside Cape Verde (mainly in Europe, but also in Asia), and some were born outside the islands.

Several players of Cape Verdean origin have chosen to play for other national teams. These include Eliseu, Nani, Oceano, Manuel Fernandes, Rolando, Nélson Marcos, Jorge Andrade, Miguel and Silvestre Varela, who all represent Portugal, as well as Mickaël Tavares, Jacques and Ricardo Faty (Senegal), Patrick Vieira (France), Gelson Fernandes (Switzerland), Henrik Larsson (Sweden), David Mendes da Silva, Lerin Duarte, Jerson Cabral (Netherlands) and Rui (Equatorial Guinea), among other examples.

===World Cup and African Nations Cup qualifiers===
Cape Verde has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup but have qualified for the 2013 African Cup of Nations. Its first World Cup qualifying campaign was the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, in which Cape Verde was eliminated in the first round after one draw and one defeat against Algeria.

In the qualification campaign for the 2006 World Cup and the 2006 African Nations Cup, Cape Verde advanced to the Final Round after its first victory in a World Cup qualifier, beating Swaziland. In the Final Round, the team made an impression with its first-ever away victory against Burkina Faso, but finished fifth in its group and failed to qualify for either finals.

Old coach João de Deus from Portugal brought in several new players from European leagues for the 2010 World Cup/2010 African Nations Cup qualifiers. Cape Verde finished second in its group in the Second round, ahead of Tanzania and Mauritius, but behind Cameroon, and did not advance to the Third round. Cape Verde&#x27;s top goal scorer of the qualifying campaign was Dady.

Then, finally, Cape Verde qualified for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, after stunning Cameroon 3–2 on aggregate.

====2013 Africa Cup of Nations====
On 14 October 2012, Cape Verde managed to secure their first ever berth in the Finals of the Africa Cup of Nations, when they defeated Cameroon 3–2 on aggregate score, following a 2–1 defeat to Cameroon at the Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo in Yaoundé, having won the home leg 2–0 in Praia just weeks prior to their qualification.

On 24 October 2012, Cape Verde were drawn into Group A of the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, alongside Angola, Morocco and the host nation South Africa. Furthermore, Cape Verde played the opening match of the tournament at Soccer City in Johannesburg, Gauteng, against South Africa on 19 January 2013 – Soccer City being the host venue for the 2010 World Cup Final. Pulled from the fourth pot during the group stage drawing of the tournament, Cape Verde actually had the highest FIFA ranking of any team in their group at the time of the drawing, ranking at 51st overall, followed by Morocco (71st), South Africa (72nd) and Angola (83rd). Cape Verde also had the 10th highest FIFA ranking in the CAF zone at the time of the drawing as well.

Cape Verde drew with South Africa 0–0 in the tournament&#x27;s first match, before drawing with Morocco 1–1. Platini scored Cape Verde&#x27;s first ever goal at the AFCON, who were unfortunate to let an early lead slip. They however did win their first ever AFCON match against Angola, which they won 2–1 (despite an early own goal by captain Nando Maria Neves), through the late goals from Fernando Varela and Héldon Ramos, thus qualifying for the quarter-finals, and thus reaching the last eight in their maiden appearance at the Africa Cup of Nations.

On 2 February 2013, Cape Verde faced Ghana in the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth, in the quarter-finals of the tournament. Cape Verde played a good match, with 16 shots on Ghana&#x27;s goal to their eight, with seven shots on target to their two, Cape Verde proved to be especially dangerous from set-pieces, however Ghana&#x27;s keeper Abdul Dauda managed to keep a clean sheet making some spectacular saves, and with Mubarak Wakaso scoring a penalty kick for Ghana in the 54&#x27; minute, and then scoring again in the closing minute of the game (90+5&#x27;) on an open goal, Ghana would win the match 2–0, to move on to the semi-finals, and ending Cape Verde&#x27;s exceptional 2013 Africa Cup of Nations campaign.

====2015 Africa Cup of Nations====
On 15 October 2014, Cape Verde became the first of two nations to qualify for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations alongside Algeria, joining the host nation Equatorial Guinea after defeating Mozambique 1–0 at home. The team, under newly appointed manager Rui Águas, picked up where Lúcio Antunes left off and managed to finish in the top two of the group stage with two matches remaining to play in the qualification process, having been drawn in a group together with Mozambique, Niger and Zambia. On 15 November 2014, Cape Verde secured first place in their group, finishing as Group F winners by defeating Niger 3–1 at home, with one match remaining to play for qualification.

Pooled from Pot 3 on 3 December 2014, Cape Verde were drawn into Group B of the final tournament, together with Zambia, Tunisia and DR Congo. On 18 January 2015 they played their first match against Tunisia at the Estadio de Ebibeyin. The match ended in a 1–1 draw, with Héldon leveling the score off a penalty kick in the 78-minute. Cape Verde then drew 0–0 against DR Congo four days later, with the advancement out of the group stage depending on the final match results of both teams.

Facing off against Zambia on 26 January 2015, with both teams depending on the result of the other match between Tunisia and DR Congo and having to finish with a win themselves, the match ended in 0–0 draw, leaving both Cape Verde and Zambia eliminated from the Cup. Contested during a tropical storm, with 26 mm of heavy rainfall, Cape Verde exited the tournament tied with DR Congo for points and undefeated, yet losing to DR Congo on goal difference. Exhibiting good form, poise and defensive prowess, the team were only able to score one goal, while exiting at the group stage of their second appearance in the finals of the tournament, while remaining unbeaten in any Cup of Nations group stage match.

===Other tournaments and notable matches===

Cape Verde has two titles: It hosted and won the Amílcar Cabral Cup in 2000, and won the gold medal in the football tournament at the 2009 Lusophony Games. The team also won a bronze medal at the 2006 Lusophony Games. For the first time in its history, on 2 November 2002, it faced a non-African team, Luxembourg, in a friendly, resulting in a scoreless draw. On 4 September 2009, it faced Malta in a friendly, resulting in a 2–0 victory. On 24 May 2010, Cape Verde played out a 0–0 draw in a friendly match against a full-strength Portugal. At the time, Portugal was third in the FIFA rankings and Cape Verde were 117th. On 31 March 2015, a second friendly against Portugal resulted in a 2–0 victory in Portugal.

==Stadiums==

The team used to play their games at Estádio da Várzea. It is located in the capital city, Praia, on the Santiago Island. The stadium opened in 2006 and holds 10,000 people.

In 2014 the new stadium Estádio Nacional de Cabo Verde was opened, able to host a capacity of 15,000 people. On 15 October 2014 the team qualified for their second Africa Cup of Nations at the new stadium, in a 1–0 victory over Mozambique, making them the first of all teams in CAF to qualify for the tournament.

Hulanicki worked as a fashion illustrator after studying at Brighton Art College in the late 1950s. In 1961 she married advertising executive Stephen Fitz-Simon and in 1963 they set up a Mail order fashion business selling inexpensive outfits. She named the company Biba&#x27;s Postal Boutique; Biba was the nickname of her younger sister Biruta.

The company had its first significant success in May 1964 when it offered a pink gingham dress with a hole cut out of the back of the neck with a matching triangular kerchief to readers of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. The dress had celebrity appeal, as a similar dress had been worn by Brigitte Bardot. By the morning after the dress was advertised in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, over 4,000 orders had been received. Ultimately, some 17,000 outfits were sold. Following this success, a shop was opened at 87 Abingdon Road in Kensington in September 1964. At around this time Anna Wintour, the future editor-in-chief of &quot;Vogue&quot;, became an employee of Biba as a 15-year-old. Another teenage employee was the future actress Madeline Smith. The artist, novelist and journalist Molly Parkin made hats for Biba, and the actress Katy Manning worked for the company as a model.

In 1966, Biba moved to larger premises at 19-21 Kensington Church Street while continuing to operate a successful mail-order arm. Also in that year, Biba was described by Time as &quot;The most in-shop for gear&quot;. The shop had many celebrities among its customers but its clothing was at a low price point. Cutting-edge fashion had previously been confined to the wealthy but Biba made it affordable to a large number of consumers. Effort was put into the ambience of the shops. They used ornate, Victorian antique furniture, were dimly lit and played loud pop music. The staff resembled the customers in age and appearance, typically women under the age of 25.

The larger shop offered the space for the company to expand into cosmetics. These were supplied by an East Grinstead factory that manufactured products for Revlon. Hulanicki was interested in producing cosmetics in a large range of new, bright colours, that would enable her customers to create a complete &quot;Biba look&quot;. This included items such as green lipstick that were extremely unusual for the time. The company was also the first to sell cosmetics for Black skin and for men. The cosmetics range was very successful and was being sold in 30 countries within two years.

By 1969, the shop&#x27;s weekly takings were around £10,000 (£ in ). The decision was made to move to larger site, 120 Kensington High Street. This was a former shop of the collapsed Cyril Lord carpet company and was nine times larger than the Kensington Church Street premises. This expansion was funded by selling a 75% stake in the business to the fashion retailer Dorothy Perkins and clothing manufacturer Dennis Day Ltd. Biba&#x27;s Over-the-knee boots were a notably popular item at this time. They were made in suede or canvas in many different colours, and were so sought-after that queues would form outside the store when a delivery was due. 

In 1971, The Angry Brigade, a far-left terrorist group, were planning to bomb Biba and other targets as part of their ongoing bombing campaign. However, members of the group were arrested and the plans discovered before this took place.
In 1972, a Biba dress was chosen as a Dress of the Year, that best represented that year&#x27;s fashion.

==Big Biba==

In 1973, Dorothy Perkins was bought by British Land, this gave British Land a 70% ownership of Biba. The store moved to the seven-storey Derry &amp; Toms department store on Kensington High Street, which immediately attracted up to a million customers weekly, making it one of the most visited tourist attractions in London. There were different departments, and each floor had its own theme, such as a children&#x27;s floor, a floor for men, a book store, a food market, and a &quot;home&quot; floor which sold items such as wallpaper, paint, cutlery, soft furnishings and even statues. The overall design was produced by Whitmore-Thomas Partnership, run by artist/designers Steve Thomas and Tim Whitmore. Each department had its own logo or sign, which was based on the Biba logo and had a picture describing the department. These were commissioned by Thomas and Whitmore and designed by Kasia Charko.

The store had an Art Deco-interior reminiscent of the Golden Age of Hollywood and non-traditional displays, such as a giant Snoopy and his doghouse in the children&#x27;s department, where merchandise based on the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip was sold. In the Biba Food Hall, each part was aimed at one particular kind of product; a unit made to look like a dog (based on Hulanicki&#x27;s own dog, a Great Dane named Othello) consisted of dog food; a huge baked beans tin can consisted of only tins of Baked beans; a can of &quot;Warhol&#x27;s Condensed Soup&quot; etc., all foods having individual innovative units.

Also at the new &quot;Big Biba&quot; was the Rainbow Room restaurant, which was located on the fifth floor. The restaurant served 1,200 lunches per day and became a major hang-out for rock stars such as the New York Dolls and Liberace, but which was not solely the reserve of the elite. With all of these renovations and additions, Biba became known as a &quot;theatre for fashion.&quot;

Also at the site was the Kensington Roof Gardens, which predated Biba and are still there today.

==Demise==
Big Biba was a huge responsibility in terms of expense and organization, but Hulanicki and Fitz felt they needed to &quot;keep moving forward.&quot; Because of this massive undertaking, Hulanicki said, &quot;Every time I went into the shop, I was afraid it would be for the last time.&quot;

After disagreements with the Board over creative control, Hulanicki left the company and, shortly afterwards in 1975, Biba was closed by the British Land Company. For a period after it closed, Biba&#x27;s department store on Kensington High Street was occupied by squatters. The Dorothy Perkins shareholders decided that the Derry &amp; Toms building that housed Big Biba was worth more than the ailing business itself. In 1975, the Derry &amp; Toms interiors were replaced by the utilitarian interiors for Marks &amp; Spencer and British Home Stores. Dorothy Perkins sold the trademark to a consortium with no connection to Barbara Hulanicki, who opened a store in London on 27 November 1978, on two floors in Conduit Street in London&#x27;s Mayfair. The store was not a success, and closed less than two years later.

==Relaunches==
There have been several attempts to relaunch Biba, the first occurring as soon after its closure as 1977. There was another relaunch in the mid-1990s, with Monica Zipper as head designer. Barbara Hulanicki has not been involved with any of these relaunches, and owing to the use of Biba&#x27;s logo and similar labels, these garments are easy to pass off as original vintage pieces.

The Biba label was relaunched again in May 2006 under designer Bella Freud. Again, Biba&#x27;s founder, Barbara Hulanicki, was not contacted for the relaunch and said it was &#x27;very, very painful&#x27;, believing that the new Biba would &#x27;betray its heritage.&#x27; Freud&#x27;s first collection Spring/Summer 2007 was unveiled at London Fashion Week in September 2006, and was criticised for straying from the original concept of low-priced clothes for teenagers, needing &#x27;more polish&#x27;, as they &#x27;had a Biba flavour but lacked the retro details that the original Biba designs had.&#x27; Freud&#x27;s second attempt, Autumn/Winter 2007 was also panned as &#x27;the kind of thing that&#x27;s already over-available in fast fashion chains.&#x27; Freud left the company after just two seasons in June 2007 to relaunch her own label. The Biba relaunch failed and the company went into administration for a second time in 2008.

House of Fraser (HoF) bought the company in November 2009 for a second relaunch by an in-house design team, announcing Daisy Lowe as the new face of the label. Hector Castro and a five-strong team were selected to replace Freud with couture hats created by Prudence Millinery. This relaunch was highly successful, outselling House of Fraser&#x27;s other in-house brands in just two weeks of its launch, boosting its year end sales. Meanwhile, Hulanicki instead designed capsule collections for rival high-street company Topshop, and once again expressed her unhappiness with the relaunch, attacking the new Biba as &quot;too expensive&quot; and &quot;for failing to reflect the original Biba style&quot;. She also signed with Asda to produce three to four collections of clothing retailing between £11 and £18.

In 2014, it was announced that Hulanicki would be a consultant to the Biba brand, after signing an agreement with House of Fraser. Biba continued to be an HoF brand .

<doc id="1205598" wikidata="Q17039038" url="?curid=1205598" title="United States cities with teams from four major league sports">
<text>There are 12 United States cities (along with their corresponding metropolitan areas) with teams competing in each of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada: Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Football League, and the National Hockey League. These four leagues are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Big Four&quot;, in reference to their prominent position in North American sports. 

Only the country&#x27;s two largest metropolitan areas—New York and Los Angeles—have at least two teams in each major sports league.

==Overview by metro area==
&quot;Italicized&quot; teams play outside the city limits of the metropolitan area&#x27;s core city or cities; the specific location is given in parentheses. The core city or cities of a metropolitan area are identified in this reference.

==Cities formerly with teams in all four leagues==
Atlanta, Cleveland, Kansas City, St. Louis, and Phoenix formerly hosted teams in all four major sports leagues simultaneously. Kansas City and St. Louis currently have two teams each, while the other cities have three.
*Atlanta had teams from all four sports (MLB’s Atlanta Braves, NFL’s Atlanta Falcons, NBA’s Atlanta Hawks, and NHL’s Atlanta Flames) from 1972, when the expansion Flames began play, until 1980, when the Flames moved to Calgary. The city regained its four sport status in 1999, when the city was granted the Atlanta Thrashers as an NHL expansion team, but lost it again in 2011 when the Thrashers moved to Winnipeg. Atlanta is the only city to have lost four-sport status, regained it, and then lost it a second time.
*Cleveland briefly held four-sport status (MLB&#x27;s Indians, NFL&#x27;s Browns, NBA&#x27;s Cavaliers, and NHL&#x27;s Barons) from 1976 when the NHL&#x27;s California Golden Seals moved to the city to become the Barons, only to lose it when the Barons merged with the Minnesota North Stars (where the combined team would continue to play) in 1978. The Cleveland Browns relocation controversy left the city without an active NFL team from 1996 to 1999, with the NFL officially regarding the Browns as suspended.
*Kansas City had teams from all four sports (MLB&#x27;s Royals, NFL&#x27;s Chiefs, NBA&#x27;s Kings, and NHL&#x27;s Scouts) from 1974, when the expansion Scouts began play, to 1976, when the Scouts moved to Denver (and later to New Jersey). The Kings moved to Sacramento in 1985.
*St. Louis was briefly a four-sport city (MLB&#x27;s Cardinals, NFL&#x27;s Cardinals, NBA&#x27;s Hawks, and NHL&#x27;s Blues) from October 1967, when the NHL expanded to the city, until 1968, when the Hawks moved to Atlanta.
*Phoenix was a four-sport city (MLB&#x27;s Diamondbacks, NFL&#x27;s Cardinals, NBA&#x27;s Suns, and NHL&#x27;s Coyotes) from 1998, when the Diamondbacks began play, until 2024, when the Coyotes franchise was suspended and the team&#x27;s hockey operations moved to Salt Lake City.

Only two cities have played each other in the championship series of all four major North American sports leagues: St. Louis and Boston. In baseball, the Cardinals met the Red Sox in the 1946, 1967, 2004, and 2013 World Series. In hockey, the Blues played the Bruins in the 1970 and 2019 Stanley Cup Finals. In basketball, the Hawks and Celtics met in the 1957, 1958, 1960, and 1961 NBA Finals. And in football, the Rams played the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI. (Note that because each major sports league&#x27;s final generally has the champion from one conference against the champion from another conference, and conferences are often aligned based on geography, it is often not possible for teams from cities in the same region of the country to play each other in the final.)

Cities that have lost, then regained four-sport status are Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Minneapolis–St. Paul, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Per the above, Atlanta has also lost and regained four-sport status, but lost it again and does not currently have it.
* Boston had the Yanks of the NFL at the start of the four-major-sport era in 1946, along with the Red Sox, Celtics, Bruins, and Braves. Four-sport status ended when the Yanks became the New York Bulldogs in 1949, and then resumed with the formation of the Boston Patriots (now the New England Patriots) in 1960.
* Chicago had a BAA/NBA team fold in 1950, then attracted an expansion franchise in 1961 only to see it move to Baltimore two years later. Chicago rejoined the four-sport club in 1966 with the expansion Bulls.
*Detroit had a charter franchise of the NBA (then called the Basketball Association of America) in 1946, but the Falcons folded after one season. Detroit rejoined the four-sport club when the Fort Wayne Pistons moved to Detroit in 1957.
* Greater Los Angeles became a four-sport city in 1967 and remained so for 28 years. In 1993, it joined New York in having two teams in each of the four major sports (MLB&#x27;s Dodgers and Angels, NFL&#x27;s Rams and Raiders, NBA&#x27;s Lakers and Clippers, and NHL&#x27;s Kings and Mighty Ducks), but lost both of its NFL teams in 1995. The Rams moved back to Los Angeles in 2016, restoring the city to four-sport status. A year later, the city once again joined New York in having two teams from each of the four leagues with the arrival of the former San Diego Chargers.
* Minneapolis–St. Paul became a member with the arrival of the Minnesota Timberwolves as an expansion NBA franchise in 1989, only to see the NHL&#x27;s North Stars depart for Dallas in 1993. The Twin Cities regained their status with the NHL&#x27;s expansion Minnesota Wild in 2000.
*The San Francisco Bay Area had teams in all four sports from the NHL expansion in 1967 until the Seals left for Cleveland in 1976. It regained four-sport status when the expansion San Jose Sharks joined the NHL in 1991. (Oakland itself had teams in all four leagues from 1971 to 1976 – the Athletics, the Raiders, the Warriors, and the Golden Seals. The A&#x27;s plan to move from Oakland to Las Vegas would leave the city with no major league sports teams.)

If the American Basketball Association (1967–1976) were considered a major professional sports league, three more cities would be former four-sport metropolises. Pittsburgh—home to the MLB Pirates, the NFL Steelers, and the NHL Penguins—also hosted the ABA&#x27;s Pittsburgh Condors, originally called the Pipers, in 1967 and from 1969 until the team&#x27;s demise in 1972. St. Louis would have regained four-sport status between 1974 and 1976, when the city was home to the Spirits of St. Louis. And Minneapolis–St. Paul would have been a four-sport city from 1967 to 1969, having hosted the ABA&#x27;s Minnesota Muskies in 1967–68 and the Minnesota Pipers in 1968–69.

If the World Hockey Association (1972–1979) were considered a major league, Houston would have made the list; the Houston Aeros operated from 1972 to 1978, but were left out of the NHL-WHA merger negotiations and folded before the merger. Under the same assumption, Cleveland would have joined the four-sports club in 1972 with the arrival of the WHA Cleveland Crusaders, which were displaced in 1976 by the NHL&#x27;s Barons.

If the ABA and WHA were &quot;both&quot; considered major leagues, then San Diego would have made the list from fall 1974 through fall 1975. Alongside the MLB Padres (since 1969) and the AFL/NFL Chargers (1961 to 2016), there were the ABA Conquistadors/Sails (1972–1975) and the WHA Mariners (1974–1977).

==Fifth major league: Major League Soccer==
Major League Soccer in the United States was founded in 1993, and has been active since 1996. Of the 12 metro areas with all Big Four teams, only Detroit lacks an MLS team.

Media/television market rankings are based on the official government designation from the Code of Federal Regulations.

&quot;Italicized&quot; teams play outside the city limits of the metropolitan area&#x27;s core city or cities; the specific location is given in parentheses.

Miami and the San Francisco Bay Area have lost and regained five-sport status. The former lost it in 2002 when the Miami Fusion folded, and the latter in 2006 when the San Jose Earthquakes moved to Houston to become the Dynamo. The Bay Area resumed being a five-sport city in 2008 when the Earthquakes were reactivated, Miami in 2020 with the arrival of Inter Miami CF.

Of cities that formerly held four-sport status, only Atlanta, Kansas City, and St. Louis have current MLS franchises. If the WHA is counted, Houston is also included in the figure. San Diego will be included as well in 2025 if both the ABA and the WHA are counted.

No Ohio city can claim five-sport (or four-sport) status, but the state itself can via Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus sports teams with the Columbus Crew and FC Cincinnati.

The debut of MLS&#x27;s Toronto FC in 2007 gave Toronto five major professional sports teams, although its football team plays in the Canadian Football League.

<text>John Heard Couch ( ; February 28, 1811 – January 19, 1870) was an American sea captain and pioneer in the Oregon Country in the 19th century. Often referred to as Captain Couch, he became famous for his singular skill at navigation of the Columbia Bar. He was a founder of Portland, Oregon.

==Biography==

He was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts. As a boy, he developed a desire to be a sailor and shipped on a voyage to the East Indies on the brig &quot;Mars&quot;. The &quot;Mars&quot; was owned by the uncle of Capt. George H. Flanders, with whom he would later go into business. The financial success of his first voyage led to his receiving a command of the &quot;Maryland&quot; in 1840 from John Newmarch Cushing, the father of diplomat Caleb Cushing. His first voyage in the &quot;Maryland&quot; was from Newburyport to the Columbia River, where he intended to exchange various goods for a cargo of salmon. At the time, the mouth of the Columbia was considered one of the most hazardous places for navigation on earth, because of the presence of a large sand bar. His attempt at a trading voyage was rebuffed by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, which controlled commerce in the Oregon Country. The &quot;Maryland&quot; was subsequently sent to the Hawaiian Islands, where it was sold. Couch returned to Massachusetts by finding passage on another vessel.

Cushing did not attribute the failure of the trading voyage to Couch, however, and entrusted him with a command a second vessel &quot;Chenamos&quot;, named after a Native American chief along the Columbia with whom Couch had established friendly relations on his first voyage. He arrived in the Pacific Northwest in June 1842, navigating up the Columbia and the Willamette River to just below Oregon City, which was the largest settlement in the Oregon Country, which at the time was still disputed between the U.S. and Great Britain. Couch successfully established a general store and sent his brig home, remaining in the Oregon Country for five years. In 1845, during his stay in Oregon, he took a claim of land, now known as &quot;Couch&#x27;s Addition&quot;, in present-day Northwest Portland. The dispute between the U.S. and Great Britain over the Oregon Country, however, prevented him from perfecting the claim at the time. On March 4, 1846, Couch was appointed as treasurer of the Provisional Government of Oregon after Francis Ermatinger resigned. In 1847 he took passage back to Massachusetts via China, arriving in Newburyport in 1848.

Later in 1848 he was convinced by a shipping firm in New York City to take command of another vessel, the &quot;Madonna&quot;, on a voyage to the Pacific Ocean. Captain Flanders, who had been for years master of vessels for the Cushing shipping company, agreed to serve as chief mate, and to assume command of the vessel so that Couch could remain in the Oregon Territory to discharge the cargo. The &quot;Madonna&quot; sailed from New York Harbor on January 12, 1849, and arrived in Portland the following August. His passengers included United States Senator Benjamin Stark. Following his instructions, Couch stayed in Oregon City while Flanders took the vessel on short trips between Portland and San Francisco. In 1850 Flanders and Couch began a trading and wharf business together. The Oregon Treaty of 1846 (in which the U.S. acquired the Oregon Country below the 49th parallel north) and the subsequent passage of the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850 allowed Couch to perfect the land claim in Portland he had filed on his previous voyage to Oregon. From 1850 onward, he was a resident of Portland and became one of its most well-known and well-respected citizens. Couch served on the Portland Public Schools board from 1856 to 1858. His residence was near present-day Union Station. John Couch died on January 19, 1870, in Portland and was buried at River View Cemetery in that city.

==Legacy==

The contribution to Portland for which he is most remembered today is the platting of his land claim in Northwest Portland, which stretched from Burnside Avenue north for , between Northwest 23rd Avenue and the Willamette River. In laying out the streets, Couch named the east–west thoroughfares in alphabetical order as A Street, B Street, etc. The streets were later renamed, retaining the alphabetic ordering, with &quot;C Street&quot; renamed &quot;Couch Street&quot; in his honor. &quot;F Street&quot; was named in honor of his business partner Flanders.

Couch Park in the district is also named for him. The park was formerly the estate of Cicero Hunt Lewis, who married Couch&#x27;s daughter Clementine. The area has become known more recently as the Alphabet District.

The side-wheel river steamer &quot;John H. Couch&quot;, built in 1863, was named after John H. Couch.

Couch Elementary School, now called the Metropolitan Learning Center, is named for him. The signage for Couch School is still on the building.

<text>Jonathan Moss Tucker (born May 31, 1982) is an American actor. He is known for his roles in the films &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; (1999), &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; (2003), &quot;Hostage&quot; (2005), &quot;In the Valley of Elah&quot; (2007), &quot;The Ruins&quot; (2008), and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (2019). He has appeared in the television series &quot;The Black Donnellys&quot; (2007), &quot;Parenthood&quot; (2011–2013), &quot;Kingdom&quot; (2014–2017), &quot;Justified&quot; (2015), &quot;Snowfall&quot; (2018), &quot;Westworld&quot; (2018–2022), &quot;City on a Hill&quot; (2019), and &quot;Debris&quot; (2021).

==Early life==
Tucker was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to parents Maggie Moss, a public relations and marketing analyst and executive, and Paul Hayes Tucker, a professor of art at the University of Massachusetts Boston and a leading expert on Claude Monet. His paternal great-grandfather was historian and ambassador Carlton J. H. Hayes. His aunt and uncle, Mary Evelyn Tucker and John Grim, founded and co-direct the Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology.

His father is Irish Catholic and his mother is Jewish and of Romanian Jewish descent.

Tucker was raised in Charlestown, Massachusetts, and attended The Park School in Brookline, Massachusetts. He attended the Boston Ballet and played Fritz in their production of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; for 5 years starting when he was in the third grade. He was featured in a Boston Ballet calendar and attended The Thacher School in Ojai, California. Tucker said of his ballet experience, &quot;Ballet is one of the more difficult rigors that I&#x27;ve ever done. The Ballet instructors are some of the most intimidating people I&#x27;ve met.&quot;

==Career==
Tucker first started off in film by appearing in the early 1990s films &quot;Botte di Natale&quot; (1994), &quot;Two If by Sea&quot; (1996) and &quot;Sleepers&quot; (1996) before being cast in the 1999 film &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; as Tim Weiner.

He starred as Matthew in the 2000 comedy film &quot;100 Girls&quot;. A year later, he co-starred in Sundance hit &quot;The Deep End&quot; with Tilda Swinton and Josh Lucas. In 2003, Tucker was cast in the much anticipated re-imagining of the 1974 horror film of the same name, &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; produced by Michael Bay and directed by Marcus Nispel. In 2004, he appeared in the films &quot;Stateside&quot; and &quot;Criminal&quot;.

In the 2005 film &quot;Hostage,&quot; Tucker worked alongside Bruce Willis and Ben Foster. Tucker plays Dennis Cooper, one of the brothers that, along with their mysterious accomplice Mars, holds a family hostage. Tucker was directed by Paul Haggis twice in 2007: he starred as Tommy Lee Jones&#x27;s son in the film &quot;In the Valley of Elah&quot; as a soldier who is permanently changed by war after returning from Iraq; he also played Tommy Donnelly in the NBC TV series &quot;The Black Donnellys&quot;.

In 2008, he was cast in &quot;The Ruins&quot;, a thriller based on the novel by Scott Smith and directed by Carter Smith.

He portrayed emerging artist Patrick Angus in the 2009 film &quot;An Englishman in New York&quot;, opposite John Hurt as Quentin Crisp. The biographical drama chronicles Crisp&#x27;s later years spent in New York City. He then appeared in the 2010 film &quot;The Next Three Days&quot; with Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks, marking his third collaboration with Haggis.

It was announced in November 2011 that Tucker had signed on to the TV series &quot;Parenthood&quot;. He played the role of Mayor Bob Little from 2011 to 2014.

Tucker had a main role on the 2014 DirecTV drama series &quot;Kingdom&quot;. He played Jay, a mixed martial artist and son of trainer, Alvey Kulina, for which he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, which described his work as &quot;one of the most electric performances on television.&quot;

In 2015, Tucker also appeared in the final five episodes of the TV series &quot;Justified&quot; on FX as the crazy-eyed Boon — a cross between Billy the Kid and Travis Bickle.

Continuing his collaboration with Bryan Fuller, having appeared in the second season of &quot;Hannibal&quot;, Tucker starred as Low-Key Lyesmith in Starz&#x27;s &quot;American Gods&quot;, adapted from Neil Gaiman&#x27;s 2001 novel.

Tucker co-wrote the song &quot;Champagne Problems&quot; on Nick Jonas&#x27; 2016 album &quot;Last Year Was Complicated&quot;.

Beginning in 2019, Tucker played Frankie Ryan, a Boston gangster, in the Showtime crime drama &quot;City on a Hill&quot;.

In 2021, Tucker played the lead role of CIA operative Bryan Beneventi in the short-lived NBC science fiction series &quot;Debris&quot;.

==Personal life==
On June 16, 2012, Tucker married Tara Ahamed, daughter of economic historian Liaquat Ahamed. They have twins, a son and daughter born May 15, 2019.

Tucker practices Transcendental Meditation to offset loneliness on film locations. He is the founder of the nonprofit organization Pegasus Fund.

In 2023, Tucker wrote a letter of support for actor Danny Masterson before he was due to be sentenced for two counts of rape.

In June 2024, he helped evacuate a neighboring family from their home during a home invasion.

<doc id="1205637" wikidata="Q423746" url="?curid=1205637" title="Pyridoxine">
<text>Pyridoxine (PN) is a form of vitamin B6 found commonly in food and used as a dietary supplement. As a supplement it is used to treat and prevent pyridoxine deficiency, sideroblastic anaemia, pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy, certain metabolic disorders, side effects or complications of isoniazid use, and certain types of mushroom poisoning. It is used by mouth or by injection.
It is usually well tolerated. Occasionally side effects include headache, numbness, and sleepiness. Normal doses are safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Pyridoxine is in the vitamin B family of vitamins. It is required by the body to metabolise amino acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. Sources in the diet include meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, and grain.

==Medical uses==
As a treatment (oral or injection), it is used to treat or prevent pyridoxine deficiency, sideroblastic anaemia, pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy, certain metabolic disorders, side effects of isoniazid treatment and certain types of mushroom poisoning. Isoniazid is an antibiotic used for the treatment of tuberculosis. Common side effect include numbness in the hands and feet. Co-treatment with vitamin B6 alleviates the numbness. Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy is a type of rare infant epilepsy that does not improve with typical anti-seizure medications.

Pyridoxine in combination with doxylamine is used as a treatment for morning sickness in pregnant women.

==Side effects==
It is usually well tolerated, though overdose toxicity is possible. Occasionally side effects include headache, numbness, and sleepiness. Pyridoxine overdose can cause a peripheral sensory neuropathy characterized by poor coordination, numbness, and decreased sensation to touch, temperature, and vibration. Healthy human blood levels of pyridoxine are 2.1–21.7 ng/mL. Normal doses are safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

==Mechanism==
Pyridoxine is in the vitamin B family of vitamins. It is required by the body to make amino acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. Sources in the diet include fruit, vegetables, and grain.
It is also required for muscle phosphorylase activity associated with glycogen metabolism.

==Metabolism==
The half-life of pyridoxine varies according to different sources: one source suggests that the half-life of &quot;pyridoxine&quot; is up to 20 days, while another source indicates half-life of &quot;vitamin B6&quot; is in range of 25 to 33 days. After considering the different sources, it can be concluded that the half-life of pyridoxine is typically measured in several weeks.

==History==
Pyridoxine was discovered in 1934, isolated in 1938, and first made in 1939. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Pyridoxine is available both as a generic medication and over the counter product. Foods, such as breakfast cereal have pyridoxine added in some countries.

<doc id="1205639" wikidata="Q629511" url="?curid=1205639" title="Gammalsvenskby">
<text>Gammalsvenskby (; ; ) is a former village that is now a neighbourhood of Zmiivka () in Beryslav Raion of Kherson Oblast, Ukraine. It was briefly known as Verbivka () prior to being integrated with Zmiivka. Gammalsvenskby is known for its Estonian Swedish cultural heritage.

Zmiyivka also includes three former villages settled by ethnic Germans: The Lutheran villages of Schlangendorf and Mühlhausendorf and the Roman Catholic village of Klosterdorf. In the nineteenth century, the whole region, and large parts of southern Russia, contained villages settled by Germans belonging to various Protestant faiths, particularly Lutherans and Mennonites, as well as Roman Catholics.

In April 2022, Russian military forces reached Gammalsvenskby as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The village remained occupied until 11 November 2022, when it was reclaimed by the Ukrainian army. After the Ukrainian liberation, Russia has repeatedly targeted the civilian population in Gammalsvenskby with bombings including use of white phosphorus munitions.

== History ==

=== Resettlement of Estonian Swedes and founding of Gammalsvenskby ===
The population of Gammalsvenskby traces its origins to Hiiumaa (Dagö) in present-day Estonia, once a part of the Duchy of Estonia. Under the Treaty of Nystad, the island was among the territory ceded to the Russian Empire in 1721 at the end of the Great Northern War.

A few decades later, a portion of the peasant population in conflict with the local aristocracy, answered Catherine the Great&#x27;s 1762 &quot;ukase&quot; calling for settlers in Novorossiya on territory newly conquered from the Ottoman Empire; today this land is in Southern Ukraine. Enticed by promises of new fertile land along the Dnieper, about 1,200 people departed Dagö on 20 August 1780, and trekked overland to Novorossiya, arriving on 1 May 1781. Only about 400 Swedes remained behind in Dagö. While some sources call the Estonian Swedes&#x27; migration an outright expulsion from their Estonian homeland, other accounts stress the fact that these poor and oppressed serfs were given what may have seemed like a generous offer.

Regardless of the impetus, the outcome of this mass migration was disastrous. Of the 1,200 villagers who left Estonia, only 900 made it to Novorossiya. On arrival, there was no trace of the houses they had expected to find. Moreover, during their first year in Ukraine, an even larger portion of the settlers died, mainly due to dysentery. That first year, 318 died along with another 116 the following year. By 1794, only 224 people remained in Gammalsvenskby. In 1802, the Russian government ordered all male Swedes to marry by the age of 30 in an effort to boost the population.

=== Maintaining the Swedish heritage ===
From 1787 to 1805, German colonists were invited to Gammalsvenskby to bolster the region&#x27;s population. The Germans referred to the area as the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Swedish District&quot;) and the village as &quot;Alt-Schwedendorf&quot;. They soon founded three neighbouring villages: Schlangendorf, Mühlhausendorf, and Klosterdorf. With the arrival of these Germans, the Swedes were quickly outnumbered and eventually many of the area&#x27;s pastors and teachers were German-speakers who did not know Swedish.

Although the Swedes did not make full use of the arable land they had been allocated — they focused their industry more on fishing than farming — the reallocation of farm land to the German newcomers strained relations between Gammalsvenskby&#x27;s Swedes and their German neighbors, although intermarriage between the communities did occur, as is evidenced by parish register entries for weddings in both communities&#x27; churches. While the Swedes and Germans were sometimes rivals, they were never enemies and the two communities cooperated when times were bad.

Despite this, the people of Gammalsvenskby maintained their traditions, Church of Sweden Lutheran faith, and old Swedish dialect. At the end of the 19th century, some ties with Sweden were re-established, with the Ukrainian Swedes viewed as a &quot;lost tribe&quot; that preserved older Swedish traditions, such as writing in runes and maintaining an older form of the Church of Sweden&#x27;s liturgy. Prince Carl raised more than 6,000 rubles in Sweden and Finland to support construction of a new Swedish church in the village to replace the previous wooden church given by Prince Potemkin that burned in the mid-19th century. The new parish church of St. John opened in 1885. For a time, before the revolutions that followed World War I, visits from Sweden became frequent, and some villagers subscribed to Swedish newspapers.

Despite this, there were efforts by Russia to better integrate the Ukrainian Swedes with the Russian Empire. The original settlement plans exempted Ukrainian Swedes from conscription into the tsar&#x27;s army, but this changed by the end of the 1800s and 130 men from Gammalsvenskby were inducted into the Russian army during World War I.

=== Relocation attempt to Sweden ===

During the Russian Civil War, Gammalsvenskby was largely held by the Red Army, although the village did come under artillery fire from the White Army under General Anton Denikin. After fighting moved away from the villages in 1921, villagers sought aid from Sweden, including writing to Archbishop of Uppsala Nathan Söderblom. In 1922, the Swedish Red Cross led an expedition to Gammalsvenskby to provide aid and guidance in developing the region and its farmland. Under this plan, two new Swedish villages, Nysvenskby (&quot;New Swedish Village&quot;) and Svenskåker (&quot;Swedish Field&quot;), were established in part to preserve their right to the land. The neighboring German villages similarly established additional outposts, Friedenheim and Neuklosterdorf.

Conflicts with Soviet authorities over taxation, collectivization policies, and the right to maintain their Lutheran faith increased the efforts by some villagers to seek return to Sweden. On 1 September 1927, 136 farmers from the village petitioned &quot;the people of Sweden, Finland, and America&quot; for aid to reunite them with their fellow Swedes. These efforts were not immediately embraced by Sweden&#x27;s representative to Moscow, , who urged caution. On 28 June 1928, 429 villagers voted to emigrate back to Sweden under the Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia&#x27;s support for ethnic self-determination. At this time, pressure in Sweden to allow the return of the people from Gammalsvenskby increased, and on 22 February 1929, the Riksdag approved their right to come to Sweden. By June 1929, the Soviet government reached an agreement with the Swedes regarding disposition of their property in Ukraine and passport fees, and most of the people of Gammalsvenskby began preparing to leave. The villagers could only take with them what could be packed on a passenger train.

On 22 July 1929, the Swedes of Gammalsvenskby who had received an exit permit were brought downriver to Kherson on two steamers. From there, the Swedish Red Cross brought them on the cargo ship &quot;Firuzan&quot; to Constanța, Romania, where the overland journey began. They travelled by train through Hungary and Austria to Germany, passing through Sinaia, Brașov, Lőkösháza, Budapest, Vienna, Passau, and Stralsund on the way to Sassnitz. From there, they took the ferry across the Baltic Sea to Sweden. On 1 August 1929, 885 Ukrainian Swedes arrived in Trelleborg, Sweden, where they were received by Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland. Of those who opted to remain in Gammalsvenskby, 19 families (94 people) soon moved on to Manitoba, Canada, where earlier emigrants from Gammalsvenskby had settled. Six of these families later returned to Sweden.

The majority of the villagers stayed in Sweden, many of them settling in Gotland, as well as in Västergötland and Småland. In an effort to integrate these &quot;ancient Swedes&quot; with modern Sweden, officials did not allow them to stay in a single, common settlement. Instead, the government took a very paternalistic approach towards the Gammalsvenskby emigrants, requiring them to apprentice with established farmers to learn Swedish agricultural practices.

About four months after arriving in Sweden, some emigrants requested to return to Ukraine. Peter Knutas and Waldemar Utas wrote to the Ukrainian SSR that the move to Sweden was a thoughtless step and sought permission for three families to return to Ukraine. Some emigrants also joined the Communist Party of Sweden in hope of reflecting their loyalty to Soviet authorities. The movement of Ukrainian Swedes — both to Sweden and then back to the Ukrainian SSR — was used for propaganda purposes by both anti-Soviet and pro-Soviet media.

=== Soviet repression, Holodomor, and World War II ===
In total, around 250 villagers chose to return to Gammalsvenskby. With the support of the Communist Party of Sweden, they established a minor collective farm called &quot;Röd Svenskby&quot; (Red Swedish Village).

Life in the Soviet Union turned out to be hard. In 1929, the church in Gammalsvenskby was closed by the Soviet government. The famine of 1932–1933 renewed interest in the idea of returning to Sweden, and some villagers signed a list stating that they wanted to leave the country. This led to the arrest of 20 people by the secret police, the GPU. Five of them were sent to prison. Several villagers were killed in the Stalinist purge of the following years. In the 1930s, the majority of the 3,500 Scandinavian descendants living in the Southern Ukraine were accused of spying and sent with their families to &quot;katorga&quot; in Siberia and Karelia.

With the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, the German army arrived in Gammalsvenskby on 25 August 1941, where the soldiers were welcomed as liberators. During the Nazis&#x27;s three-year occupation, they granted the Swedish Ukrainians German citizenship and many of the men from Gammalsvenskby joined the German forces — both voluntarily and through conscription. As Soviet troops advanced in October 1943, Swedes and Germans were removed from the Reichskommissariat Ukraine under Germany&#x27;s evacuation plans. Many evacuees from Gammalsvenskby ended up in Krotoschyn, in the German Warthegau that had been annexed from Poland. Nearly 150 residents of Gammalsvenskby were caught by Soviet authorities at the end of the war and sent to labor camps, but were allowed to return to Ukraine as early as 1947. Others managed to go to Sweden or directly back to Gammalsvenskby.

In 1947, under a Soviet policy to remove Germanic place names, Schlangendorf became &quot;Zmiivka&quot;, Mühlhausendorf became &quot;Mykhailivka&quot;, and Klosterdorf became &quot;Kostirka&quot;. Gammalsvenskby was renamed &quot;Verbivka&quot;.

In 1951, after the exchange of territories by Poland and the Soviet Union, around 2,500 people were relocated to the area from the Drohobych Oblast villages of Lodyna, Dolyshni Berehy, and Naniv. Due to the resulting increase in population, the four villages were united under the name Zmiivka. With this migration, Zmiivka became home to the largest Boykos (Ukrainian Highlander) diaspora in Kherson Oblast, making up nearly 80% of the villagers. The newly relocated populace was officially prohibited from celebrating their traditional holidays, such as Vertep during Christmas. To make matters worse, the locals among whom they were settled considered the newcomers to be anti-Soviet nationalists.

In 1955 the Kakhovka Dam was constructed on the Dnieper, creating the Kakhovka Reservoir. This submerged part of the village along with several islands and fishing waters. On 6 June 2023, the dam was destroyed while it was under control of the Russian forces during the Russian invasion in 2022. 

=== Gammalsvenskby post-1991 ===
Prior to the fall of the Soviet Union, contacts with Sweden and Canada were re-established, and in the 1990s the Church of Sweden, Gotland Municipality, and other Swedish organizations lent economic support and led relief efforts. Chumak, a Swedish-owned producer of oil, ketchup and canned food, was established in the nearby town of Kakhovka. In early October 2008, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia visited Zmiivka and Gammalsvenskby as part of a state visit to Ukraine.

, the village had only around 108 people who share a Swedish cultural heritage. Only a few of them still speak the local Swedish dialect fluently and German is often used instead. However, the Swedish heritage is reflected in Zmiivka&#x27;s emblem, which incorporates the Swedish national symbol (the Tre Kronor), as well as a blue cross on a yellow field, which inverses the Swedish flag&#x27;s colors. On 15 April 2001, Gotland signed a sister city agreement with the village. Tourism from Sweden remains an important aspect of the village&#x27;s economy and an impetus for preservation of the Gammalsvenska dialect.

The whole of Beryslav Raion is now heavily Ukrainianized due to the resettlement of many people from western Ukraine in the region, including to the local villages of , , and .

==== Russian invasion of Ukraine ====
During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Gammalsvenskby was occupied by Russian troops, who later destroyed a monument dedicated to Ukrainian independence in the village. During the 2022 annexation referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine, the Russian occupiers shut off the internet and mobile communications in the village, and the population of Gammalsvenskby refused to take part in the balloting. People reportedly locked themselves in their homes, refusing to open their doors, although some people did manage to vote no.

During the 2022 Kherson counteroffensive, the village was about southeast of the frontlines, and it was reported that the population was hoping for liberation by Ukrainian forces. The village was liberated by the Ukrainian army on 11 November 2022, following Russian troops&#x27; withdrawal to the left (east) bank of the Dnipro.

After the liberation by Ukrainian forces, Russia has continued to target the village, in one attack destroying the local school in a bombing attack that killed one and wounded one of the school&#x27;s employees. The village has also been the target of several attacks by Russia making use of white phosphorus munitions to deliberately cause as much devastation to the local civilian population as possible. These attacks have been described as direct terror bombings targeted at civilians as the village is not of any particular military value. These bombings are under investigation for possible war crimes. Russian drones have also targeted individual civilians walking the streets, as well as humanitarian aid cars. Due to the constant bombings, and lack of electricity and water, many residents have fled to neighbouring villages. Due to Gammalsvenskby&#x27;s close proximity to the Kakhovka Dam, its destruction created another water supply threat for the village.

On 11 November 2023, exactly one year after the liberation of Gammalsvenskby, it was reported that 80% to 90% of the village had been destroyed and that only about 200 people remained, mostly elderly or ill.

<text>Samye (, ), full name Samye Mighur Lhundrub Tsula Khang (Wylie: &quot;Bsam yas mi ’gyur lhun grub gtsug lag khang&quot;) and Shrine of Unchanging Spontaneous Presence, is the first Tibetan Buddhist and Nyingma monastery built in Tibet, during the reign of King Trisong Deutsen. Shantarakshita began construction around 763, and Tibetan Vajrayana founder Guru Padmasambhava tamed the local spirits for its completion in 779. The first Tibetan monks were ordained there. Samye was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution then rebuilt after 1988.

Samye Monastery is located in the Chimpu valley (&quot;Mchims phu&quot;), south of Lhasa, next the Hapori mountain, in the Yarlung Valley. The site is in the present administrative region of Gra Nang or Drananga Lhoka.

==History==

According to the Blue Annals, completed in 1476, the temple was constructed between 787 and 791 under the patronage of King Trisong Detsen. Earlier in date is the Testament of Ba, the oldest account of the construction of the temple. This records that the foundations were laid in the &#x27;Hare Year&#x27;. This corresponds to 763 or 775, with the completion and consecration of the main shrine taking place in the &#x27;Sheep Year&#x27;. This is thought to correspond to 779.

The plan was supposedly modeled on the design of Odantapuri in what is now Bihar, India. The arrangement of the temple with a main shrine in the middle with fours shrines, each with a different color representing the cardinal points, and the whole surrounded by a circular wall, represents the Buddhist universe as three dimensional mandala. This idea is found in a number of temples of the period in South East Asia and East Asia such as the Tōdai-ji in Japan. As at the Tōdai-ji, the Samye temple is dedicated to Vairocana. A seminal text of Vairocana is the &quot;Mahavairocana Tantra&quot;, composed in India in the seventh century and translated into Chinese and Tibetan soon after. The history of Samye is dealt with in this section; for the art and architectural features and their history, see below. 
The Samye pillar or ་ and its inscription

There are many traditions about Samye compiled after the tenth century. One of the few documents belonging to the eighth century proper—but not carrying an actual date—is an inscription on the stone pillar (རྡོ་རིང་) preserved in front of the temple. This records the building of temples at Lhasa and Brag Mar (i.e. Samye), and that the king, ministers and other nobles made solemn oaths to preserve and protect the endowments of the monastery. The term used for these endowments is &#x27;necessities&#x27; or &#x27;meritorious gifts&#x27; (Tib. ཡོ་བྱད་ Sanskrit &quot;deyadharma&quot;).

The Samye bell inscription

A second dynastic record at Samye is on the large bronze bell in the entrance to the temple. This gives an account of the making of the bell by one of the queens of King Trisong Detsen. The text has been translated as follows:
&quot;Queen Rgyal mo brtsan, mother and son, made this bell in order to
worship the Three Jewels of the ten directions. And [they] pray that, by the
power of that merit, &quot;Lha Btsan po&quot; Khri Srong lde brtsan, father and son,
husband and wife, may be endowed with the harmony of the sixty
melodious sounds, and attain supreme enlightenment.&quot;

Histories of Samye after the Dynastic Period

According to post-dynastic accounts such as the Testament of Ba and other accounts, such as that compiled by Bsod-nams-rgyal-mtshan (1312–1374), the Indian monk Śāntarakṣita made the first attempt to construct the monastery while promoting his sutra-centric version of Buddhism. Finding the Samye site auspicious, he set about to build a structure there. However, the building would always collapse after reaching a certain stage. Terrified, the construction workers believed that there was a demon or obstructive tulku in a nearby river making trouble.

When Shantarakshita&#x27;s contemporary Padmasambhava arrived from northern India, he was able to subdue the energetic problems obstructing the building of Samye. According to the 5th Dalai Lama, Padmasambhava performed the Vajrakilaya dance and enacted the rite of namkha to assist Trisong Detsen and Śāntarakṣita clear away obscurations and hindrances in the building of Samye: 
The abovementioned quotation makes reference to the relationship of the kīla to the stupa and mentions torma and namkha. Moreover, the building of Samye marked the foundation of the original school of Tibetan Buddhism, the Nyingma. This helps explain how Padmasambhava&#x27;s Tantra-centric version of Buddhism gained ascendance over the sutra-based teaching of Śāntarakṣita.

Pearlman succinctly charts the origin of the institution of the Nechung Oracle:
The Great Debate

One of the key events in the history of Samye was the debate between Buddhist schools hosted by Trisong Detsen in the 790s. Adamek (2007: p. 288) provides a five-year range when Moheyan of the East Mountain Teaching of Chan Buddhism and Kamalaśīla may have debated at Samye in Tibet:

Broughton identifies the Chinese and Tibetan nomenclature of Moheyan&#x27;s teachings and identifies them principally with the East Mountain Teaching:

The great debate of the Council of Lhasa between the two principal debators or dialecticians, Moheyan and Kamalaśīla is narrated and depicted in a specific cham dance once held annually at Kumbum Monastery in Qinghai.

==Influences==

The 18th century Puning Temple built by the Qianlong Emperor of Qing China in Chengde, Hebei was modeled after Samye.

==Architectural features of the monastery and their history==
Samye Monastery is laid out on the shape of a giant mandala; in its center lies the main temple representing the legendary Mount Meru. Other buildings stand at the corners and cardinal points of the main temple, representing continents and other features of tantric Buddhist cosmology. The three-storied main building has been designed with the first floor in Indian style, the second in Chinese style and the third in Khotanese (Tibetan) style. The original building was completed in 780 CE. 

In corners are 4 chörtens - white, red, green (or blue) and black.
There are 8 main temples:
* Dajor ling བརྡ་སྦྱོར་གླིང་ (brda sbyor gling)
* Dragyar ling སྒྲ་བསྒྱར་གླིང་ (sgra bsgyar gling)
* Bétsa ling བེ་ཙ་གླིང་ (be tsa gling)
* Jampa ling བྱམས་པ་གླིང་ (byams pa gling)
* Samten ling བསམ་གཏན་གླིང་ (bsam gtan gling)
* Natsok ling སྣ་ཚོགས་གླིང་ (sna tshogs gling)
* Düdül ling བདུད་འདུལ་གླིང་ (bdud &#x27;dul gling)
* Tamdrin ling རྟ་མགྲིན་གླིང་ (rta mgrin gling)

The original buildings have long disappeared. They have been badly damaged several times — by civil war in the 11th century, fires in the mid 17th century and in 1826, an earthquake in 1816, and in the 20th century, particularly during the Cultural Revolution. As late as the late 1980s pigs and other farm animals were allowed to wander through the sacred buildings. Heinrich Harrer quoted his own words he said to the 14th Dalai Lama of what he saw in 1982 from his airplane en route to Lhasa, Each time it has been rebuilt, and today, largely due to the efforts of Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama from 1986 onward, it is again an active monastery and important pilgrimage and tourist destination. Samye still preserves the original design of Trisong Detsen the 8th century Tibetan monarch (Van Schaik 2013:36).

== Recent events ==
===Imprisonment and suicide===
In 2009, the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD) reports that, according to the information they have received, nine monks studying at Samye Monastery had been sentenced to prison terms varying from two to fifteen years for participating in the protest on 15 March 2008 held at the Samye government administrative headquarters in Dranang County. The monks were joined by hundreds of Tibetans demanding religious freedom, human rights for Tibetans and the return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet. They were held at the Lhoka Public Security Bureau (PSB) Detention Centre.

The TCHRD also reported that on 19 March 2008, a visiting scholar from Dorje Drak Monastery, Namdrol Khakyab, committed suicide, leaving a note speaking of unbearable suppression by the Chinese regime, citing the innocence of other monks of the monastery, and taking full responsibility for the protest.

===Statue of Padmasambhava dismantled by Chinese Authorities===
In May 2007, a 30 ft (9 metre) gold and copper plated statue of Guru Rinpoche, known as Padmasambhava, at Samye Gompa, and apparently funded by two Chinese devotees from Guangzhou in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, was reportedly demolished by Chinese authorities.

<text>The Dukla Pass (, , , ; AMSL) is a strategically significant mountain pass in the Laborec Highlands of the Outer Eastern Carpathians, on the border between Poland and Slovakia (Lemkivshchyna) and close to the western border of Ukraine.

The Dukla Pass is the lowest mountain pass in the Carpathian Mountains main range. Located south of Dukla in Poland and northeast of Prešov in Slovakia, the pass is acknowledged as an area where Eastern and Western Slavic cultures meet.

In the 17th century, it was the haunt of a bandit and folk hero, Andrij Savka.
The Dukla Pass was the scene of bitterly contested battles on the eastern fronts of both World War I and World War II (Battle of the Dukla Pass).

<text>The Battle of the Dukla Pass, also known as the Dukla, Carpatho–Dukla, Rzeszów–Dukla, or Dukla–Prešov offensive, was the battle for control over the Dukla Pass on the border between Poland and Slovakia on the Eastern Front of World War II between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in September–October 1944. It was part of the Soviet East Carpathian strategic offensive that also included the Carpathian–Uzhgorod offensive. The operation&#x27;s primary goal, to provide support for the Slovak rebellion, was not achieved, but it concluded the full liberation of the Ukrainian SSR.

The German resistance in the eastern Carpathian region was much stronger than expected. The battle which began on 8 September would not see the Soviet forces on the other side of the pass until 6 October, and German forces would stop their heavy resistance in the region only around 10 October. Five days to Prešov turned into fifty days to Svidník alone with over 70,000 casualties on both sides. Prešov that was to be reached in six days remained beyond the Czechoslovaks&#x27; grasp for four months. The battle would be counted among the most bloody in the entire Eastern Front and the history of Slovakia; one of the valleys in the pass, near the villages of Kapišová, Chyrowa, Iwla and Głojsce, would become known as the &quot;Valley of Death&quot;.

==Background==
In summer 1944, Slovaks rebelled against the Nazis and the Czechoslovak government appealed to Soviets for help. On 31 August, Soviet marshal Ivan Konev was ordered to prepare plans for an offensive to destroy Nazi forces in Slovakia. The plan was to push through the old Slovak-Polish border in the Carpathian Mountains via the Dukla Pass near Svidník to penetrate Slovakia proper.

In the meantime, however, the Germans had fortified the region, forming the &quot;Karpatenfestung&quot; (&quot;Carpathian fortress&quot;) or &quot;Árpád Line&quot;.

==Battle==
The Soviet operation plan called for the Soviet forces to cross the pass and capture the town of Prešov within five days.

The operation started on 8 September. It took the Soviets three days to take Krosno (it was liberated on 11 September). One of the biggest battles in the pass took place on and around Hill 534 in the northwest from the town of Dukla; the battle to capture this hill lasted from 10 to 20 September, and during that period the control of the hill changed more than 20 times. The town of Dukla was liberated on 21 September. The area of the former Czechoslovak state border—heavily fortified by the Germans—was liberated on 6 October; it took almost a month for the Soviet forces to reach Slovakia.

The Dukla operation did not end when the Soviets forced the pass. The combat zone shifted to Eastern Slovakia, with Soviet forces trying to outflank and push back the German forces, still strong and having many fortified positions. South of the pass and directly west of the village of Dobroslava lies an area that has come to be known as the &quot;Valley of Death&quot;. Here Soviet and German armor clashed in a miniature reenactment of the great tank battle of Kursk. Soviet and Czechoslovak forces would enter Svidník on 28 October. A major German fortified position near the pass, Hill 532 &quot;Obšár&quot;, would be secured as late as on 25 November 1944.

==Aftermath==
The Slovak National Uprising had been mostly crushed by the time Soviet units secured Slovak territories; one of the main reasons for this was that the German resistance in the Dukla Pass was much heavier than expected. Another factor was that the Slovak insurgent forces failed to secure the other side of the pass, as planned by the Slovak and Soviet commanders during early preparations.

In 1949, the Czechoslovak government erected a memorial and cemetery southeast of the Dukla border crossing in Vyšný Komárnik village. It contains the graves of several hundred Soviet and Czechoslovak soldiers. Several other memorials and cemeteries have also been erected in the region.

In 1956, the football club ATK Praha changed their name to Dukla Praha (Dukla Prague) in honour of those who had fallen in the battle.

In October 2024, an article in Czech news was published reviewing 80 years since the battle took place. According to the article 617 Czech soldiers of the 2000 killed during the battle are not mentioned on any memorial. The article also stated the Ministry of Defence wants to build a memorial in honour of those soldiers in Poland.
