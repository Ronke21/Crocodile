<text>The Royal Grammar School (RGS), Newcastle upon Tyne, is a coeducational private day school for pupils aged between 7 and 18 years. Founded in 1525 by Thomas Horsley, the Mayor of Newcastle upon Tyne, it received royal foundation by Queen Elizabeth I and is the city&#x27;s oldest institution of learning. It is one of seven schools in the United Kingdom to bear the name &quot;Royal Grammar School&quot;, of which two others are part of the independent sector.

The school is located in Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne, in North East England, and is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference. In 2008, RGS became fully co-educational after nearly 500 years as an all boys&#x27; school. Former students are known as &quot;Old Novocastrians&quot; or &quot;Old Novos&quot; (&quot;Novocastrian&quot; is macaronic Latin for &quot;citizen of Newcastle&quot;).

In 2012 and again in 2015, the Sunday Times Schools Guide named RGS the top performing school in the North of England based on academic results from A-levels and GCSEs.

==History==
The RGS was founded in 1525 by Thomas Horsley, within the grounds of St Nicholas&#x27; Church, Newcastle. Planning is believed to have begun as early as 1477. The site has moved five times since then, most recently to Jesmond in 1906. The new school building, designed by Sir Edward Cooper, was officially opened on 17 January 1907 by the 7th Duke of Northumberland.

An 1868 description reads:
There are many public schools, the principal one being the Royal Free Grammar school founded in 1525 by Thomas Horsley, Mayor of Newcastle, and made a royal foundation by Queen Elizabeth. It is held in the old hall of St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital, built in the reign of James I., and has an income from endowment of about £500, besides a share in Bishop Crew&#x27;s 12 exhibitions at Lincoln College, Oxford, lately abolished, and several exhibitions to Cambridge. The number of scholars is about 140. Hugh Moises, and Dawes, author of &quot;Miscellanea Critica,&quot; were once head-masters, and many celebrated men have ranked among its pupils, including W. Elstob, Bishop Ridley, Mark Akenside, the poet, Chief Justice Chambers, Brand, the antiquary and town historian, Horsley, the antiquary, and Lords Eldon, Stowell, and Collingwood.

George III, on reading one of Admiral Collingwood&#x27;s despatches after Trafalgar, asked how the seaman had learned to write such splendid English, but he answered himself, recalling that, along with Eldon and Stowell, he had been a pupil of Hugh Moises: &quot;I forgot. He was one of Moises&#x27; boys.&quot;

For the duration of the Second World War the school was evacuated en masse to Penrith, Cumbria, where a special train carrying staff and around 800 pupils arrived on 1 September 1939. Meanwhile, the main school building was transformed into the Regional War Room, which undertook the vital strategic role of collating details of air raids across the region and passing these on to RAF Fighter Command. Several rudimentary air raid shelters were built above ground for military personnel, which although substantial enough to survive as store rooms until the end of the century would have offered little protection, even from an indirect hit. The school was one of several places in Newcastle upon Tyne where a small supply of ammunition to be used in the event of a German invasion was stored.

==Student life==

===Organisation===

Throughout the school (years 3–13) are four houses, named Collingwood (gold), Eldon (green), Horsley (blue) and Stowell (red), although the Junior School previously had separate houses, named after colours (red, white, and blue). 

There are 91 members of teaching staff in the Senior School. In the Junior School there are 16 members of teaching staff including the Headmaster James Miller. There are also approximately 68 members of maintenance staff and 14 private music tutors.

===Clubs and societies===

The RGS has Combined Cadet Force (CCF) Army, Navy and RAF contingents, open to both boys and girls. Cadets have weekly training sessions after school, and opportunities to go on extended training and adventure trips during the holidays. The Army section of NRGS CCF is affiliated to the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, and the Navy Section is affiliated to HMS &quot;Calliope&quot;, a stone frigate which is situated on the Tyne next to the Baltic Art Gallery.

In 2004 the school hosted the first Northern Junior Debating Championship, which has now become an annual competition. The school&#x27;s debating society also regularly enters teams for other competitions, and has reached the finals&#x27; day of both the Oxford Union and Cambridge Union schools&#x27; competitions in recent years, winning the Cambridge Union competition in 2010. At a junior level, RGS won the Northern Junior Debating Competition in 2005, 2006, 2010 and 2014.

The primary sports that are played at RGS are rugby, hockey, fencing, football, netball, cricket, swimming, and athletics.

===Magazines===

The school magazine, &quot;Novo&quot;, comes out annually. A student-run newspaper, &quot;the Issue&quot;, came into being in the late 1990s; after a period of inactivity, it was relaunched as &quot;the re-Issue&quot; in September 2003. It ran roughly twice per term until its demise in summer 2005, but was replaced in early 2006 by &quot;The Grammar&quot;. At the end of the 2009–2010 academic year, &quot;The Grammar&quot; folded. In 2011 a new magazine called &quot;Vox&quot; was set up but is currently out of print. In 2017, an online group &quot;RGmemeS&quot; came into being. It is currently inactive.

==Buildings and grounds==

The RGS is located opposite the Newcastle Prep School, and close to Newcastle High School for Girls, a single-sex girls&#x27; school formed through the merger of the Central High and Church High girls&#x27; schools.

The RGS&#x27;s main buildings are in a complex located on Eskdale Terrace, Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne. The school hall houses an organ donated by Sir Arthur Sutherland to commemorate the 138 former pupils who were killed during the First World War.

In 1996, a new Sports&#x27; Hall containing basketball courts and updated gymnastics facilities was opened. The building also provides facilities for table tennis, fencing, and weight-training, plus a gymnasium and climbing wall.

In 1997, Professor Richard Dawkins opened the new Science and Technology Centre (STC), with Physics and Design &amp; Technology laboratories downstairs, and Chemistry and Biology laboratories upstairs. In 2003 the STC was renamed &quot;The Neil Goldie Centre&quot; in memory of Neil Goldie, who died earlier that year. At the time he was the school&#x27;s Head of Science and Technology.

In 2005, the music and economics block was demolished. A new Performing Arts Centre and Modern Languages department was completed in September 2006. It includes a 300-seat auditorium, named the &quot;Miller Theater&quot; in memory of former headmaster James Miller, for school concerts and productions, a musical recital hall, a drama/dance studio, recording facilities, a band room, a percussion room, and a number of classrooms.

A floodlit all-weather surface has been in use since January 2006, on land that once was part of the school field. Aside from the school field, which is primarily used for rugby union, the school also owns land in nearby Jesmond for sports use. This was given to the school in recompense for the land it lost when the flyover was created at the top of the school – eating into some of the land owned by the school. The school is also the landlords of Sutherland Park in Benton. Sutherland Park is named after Arthur Sutherland (1878–1883), who bought the grounds of Benton Lodge in 1925 for Novocastrians Rugby Football Club. The ground and clubhouse was sold to the school at a later date. The club was set up by former pupils of the school in 1899; many Old Novos still represent and play for the club to this day. The school has also recently agreed a 50-year lease of the County Cricket Ground on Osborne Avenue, Jesmond.

In October 2015, the school was the team base for the Scottish national rugby union team during the 2015 Rugby World Cup.

In October 2019 a new library, art facilities and pastoral care centre, was opened. In addition, the school also redeveloped the sixth form area, which opened in January 2020.

<doc id="1216581" wikidata="Q8075301" url="?curid=1216581" title="Zunior">
<text>Zunior.com is a Canadian online independent record label and music store founded in 2004 by Dave Ullrich, formerly of The Inbreds.

The store primarily sells digital music from independent artists, in MP3 format without digital rights management protection. Most albums are sold at a price of $8.88 per album, although discounted sale prices are also available on some releases. Customers also have the option of downloading music files in a lossless format (FLAC) at a slightly higher price. The architecture of the Zunior technology is maintained by Ullrich&#x27;s business partner Terry Scott and runs on the Shopify platform.

Zunior releases are normally also released in conventional CD format on other independent labels, although some albums are also released in download-only format exclusively from Zunior. Some artists, including Rheostatics and Wooden Stars, have also made previously released albums available for download through Zunior.

Each month, Zunior also releases a free sampler compilation of songs by artists with releases available for purchase on the site. The service also frequently releases exclusive compilation albums, including the Rheostatics tribute album &quot;The Secret Sessions&quot;, a series of annual Christmas-themed albums and Tony Dekker&#x27;s 2014 covers album &quot;Sings 10 Years of Zunior&quot;, as fundraising benefits for Toronto&#x27;s Daily Bread Food Bank.

Zunior also distributes audio recordings of Stuart McLean&#x27;s &quot;Vinyl Cafe&quot; books, as well as music-related ebooks.

<doc id="1216583" wikidata="Q3030189" url="?curid=1216583" title="Farewell speech">
<text>A farewell speech or farewell address is a speech given by an individual leaving a position or place. They are often used by public figures such as politicians as a capstone to the preceding career, or as statements delivered by persons relating to reasons for their leaving. The term is often used as a euphemism for &quot;retirement speech,&quot; though it is broader in that it may include geographical or even biological conclusion.

In the Classics, a term for a dignified and poetic farewell speech is &quot;apobaterion&quot; (ἀποβατήριον), standing opposed to the &quot;epibaterion&quot;, the corresponding speech made upon arrival.

== U.S. presidential farewell addresses ==
Many U.S. presidential speeches have been given the moniker &quot;farewell address&quot; since George Washington&#x27;s address in 1796. Some notable examples:

<text>The Östergötland Infantry Regiment () was a Swedish Army infantry regiment with origins tracing back to the 16th century. In 1791, they were merged into another unit to form a new regiment, the Life Grenadier Regiment. The regiment&#x27;s soldiers were recruited from the province of Östergötland.

== History ==
The regiment originated in 16th century Östergötland as &quot;fänikor&quot; (companies). In 1619, these units—along with the fänikor from nearby Jönköping County—were organised by Gustav II Adolf into the Östergötland Grand Regiment, where 9 out of 24 companies were recruited from Östergötland. &quot;Östergötlands storregemente&quot; consisted of three field regiments, one of which was the Östergötland Infantry Regiment. Sometime between 1623 and 1628, the Östergötland Grand Regiment was split into three smaller regiments.

The regiment was officiated in 1636 although it had existed since the 1620s. The Östergötland Infantry Regiment was one of the original 20 Swedish infantry regiments mentioned in the Swedish constitution of 1634. The regiment&#x27;s first commander was Johan Banér. It was allotted in 1685.

In 1791, the Östergötland Infantry Regiment was merged with the Östergötland Cavalry Regiment to form the Life Grenadier Regiment. The reorganisation and renaming to &quot;life grenadier&quot; was done because of the regiment&#x27;s achievements during the 1788 Russo-Swedish War. Within the new regiment, the Östergötland Infantry Regiment was renamed to &quot;Livgrenadjärregementets rotehållsdivision&quot; and retained some form of independence.

<doc id="1216588" wikidata="Q4874720" url="?curid=1216588" title="Bayou Classic">
<text>The Bayou Classic is an annual college football classic rivalry game between the Grambling State University Tigers and the Southern University Jaguars, first held under that name in 1974 at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans, although the series itself actually began in 1932. A trophy is awarded to the winning school.

==Background==
Since 1974 the game has been held the Saturday after Thanksgiving Day, at the Superdome. Following the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, organizers moved the 2005 event from the Superdome to Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas, where many of New Orleans&#x27; evacuees were living. This was the only time that the Bayou Classic was held outside of Louisiana. The 2006 Bayou Classic returned to the Superdome.

It is the best known annual game and rivalry in historically black college or university (HBCU) football and was nationally televised in the U.S. by NBC from 1991 to 2014. Beginning in 2015, it aired on the NBC Sports Network (NBCSN); after NBCSN shut down at the end of 2021, the Bayou Classic returned to NBC. The Bayou Classic was the only National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Football Championship Subdivision game to be shown regularly on broadcast television. Fans have been known to refer to it as the &quot;Black Super Bowl&quot;, although that name is not used in any official capacity by either school due to the National Football League&#x27;s restrictions on the use of the &quot;Super Bowl&quot; name. Both schools typically forgo FCS playoff eligibility to participate in the Bayou Classic. The game is one of two black college football classics to be associated with Thanksgiving weekend (the other is the older Turkey Day Classic).

The game had State Farm Insurance as its title sponsor from 1996 to 2011.

==Other activities==
Of the many activities held in conjunction with the game, the most anticipated and well-attended is the two-part Battle of the Bands, where both universities&#x27; marching bands—Grambling&#x27;s &quot;World Famed&quot; Tiger Marching Band and Southern&#x27;s Human Jukebox—perform. Following the Greek show, the two renowned bands stage elaborately choreographed performances on the Friday night before the game. The final part is held during the football game&#x27;s halftime show. There is no official judge for the band battle.

Since 1992, members of Grambling&#x27;s Army ROTC, Southern&#x27;s Army ROTC, and the Navy ROTC run with the game ball from Southern&#x27;s campus in the Scotlandville area of Baton Rouge to the Caesars Superdome in the New Orleans Central Business District for the annual &quot;Bayou Classic Motivation Run.&quot; The event happens the day before the game begins and is an approximately 100 mile run that takes between seven and ten hours to complete. ROTC members take turns running with the ball while a police escort trails them along the way.

Other activities usually include a press conference, black business showcase, golf tournament, coaches luncheon, a concert/fan festival, tailgating, fashion show, pep rally, alumni functions, a Louisiana high school battle of the bands, college recruitment fair, a Bayou Classic Parade, and a job fair for graduating students of both institutions. An annual Grambling vs. Southern &quot;Miss Bayou Classic&quot; beauty pageant was also held from 1976 to 2002.

==Financial impact==
The Bayou Classic is a major source of revenue ($50 million) to the city of New Orleans and the state of Louisiana. 250,000 visitors descend upon New Orleans over the course of the events leading up to the game, and the national television audience has attracted between four and five million viewers. The success of the game has inspired the promotion of numerous other HBCU classics. Historically, the stadium attendance had averaged between 50,000 and 70,000 annually which makes it one of the highest attended Division I FCS matchups every season. Hurricane Katrina brought some challenges, first with a one-year move to Houston, then with a slight drop-off in attendance upon the classic&#x27;s return to New Orleans—all while the Florida Classic and Magic City Classic gained significantly in prominence over that same time period. Though the Bayou Classic also lost its title sponsor in 2011 and GSU faced numerous issues during its 2013 season, officials in 2014 rejected suggestions to remove GSU as a participant and instead resolved to quickly rejuvenate the classic. Attendance has now climbed significantly each year since 2011 and is again near pre-Katrina levels. The game also remains nationally televised, although NBC did briefly move the game broadcast over to its old sister sports-only network between the years of 2015 and 2021.

==Series history==
Historically, Grambling State and Southern have arguably had the two most successful football teams in the Southwestern Athletic Conference. Through the 2021 season, Grambling has more SWAC football titles than any other school (25, not including their vacated 1975 title); Southern has the second most with 18. GSU and SU also have more black national titles than any other SWAC schools; as of 2021, Grambling has the second most in the entire country with 15 total, while SU has the fourth most at the FCS-level (11). The two schools also represented the SWAC in 11 of the 12 Pelican and Heritage bowls, as well as in multiple Celebration Bowls. Through 2015 Florida A&amp;M, formerly of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, was the only FCS-level HBCU school with more football wins (588) than Southern (578) or Grambling (565). However, Florida A&amp;M, Southern, and Grambling were ordered by the NCAA to vacate wins in multiple sports due to the questionable eligibility of hundreds of their student athletes in the 2010s. It is not immediately clear just which football games are effected by these rulings, but the NCAA did make a special point to specify that Grambling&#x27;s 2011 season record and championships remain fully intact; games played between 2012 and 2015, however, appear to remain possible candidates for being vacated (the 2015 Bayou Classic was one that was apparently vacated). Southern, meanwhile, had to vacate all of its 2013 and 2014 wins, at the very least (which also includes 2 Bayou Classic wins).

Southern leads the overall series with Grambling, begun in 1932, by a 41–34 margin. This total does not take into account the 2 wins vacated by Southern or the 1 vacated by Grambling, but it does include the 1 game forfeited by Southern.) Grambling State claims the longest winning streak in the all-time series, 9 games from 1970 to 1978 (including the 1972 forfeit). Southern claims the longest winning streak in the Bayou Classic era, 8 games from 1993 to 2000 (the Jaguars also had a previous 8-game winning streak at the start of the series, in the games played between 1932 and 1946). SU&#x27;s 49–7 victory in 2020 ranks as the largest margin of victory in the Bayou Classic, while SU&#x27;s 1935 victory (64–6) is the largest margin in the all-time series. Multiple trophies have been awarded to the winner of the Bayou Classic over the years. The most recent trophy, consisting of Waterford Crystal, was retired after the 2014 game after more than 25 years of service and presented to the Smithsonian Institution for its National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. A newly designed trophy has been showcased since the 2015 game.

People prominently involved in the series include Ace Mumford (SU coach from 1936 to 1942 and again 1944–61), Eddie Robinson (SU student—for just a week, as a freshman—in the 1930s and GSU coach from 1941 to 1942 and again 1945–97), Doug Williams (GSU player from 1974 to 1977, SU consultant in 1985, and GSU coach from 1998 to 2003 and again 2011–13), Marino Casem (SU athletic director from 1986 to 1999 and coach from 1987 to 1988 and again 1992), Pete Richardson (SU coach from 1993 to 2009), and Rod Broadway (GSU coach from 2007 to 2010). Mumford once had the third most wins among all college football coaches (behind Pop Warner and Amos Alonzo Stagg), and Robinson later had the most. Today Robinson still has the third most wins (behind John Gagliardi and Joe Paterno) and also has the most wins among all who coached at HBCU schools; Mumford now has the fourth most wins among HBCU coaches behind Robinson, Billy Joe, and John Merritt. Broadway holds the distinction of being the only coach to have ever won a black national title at three different schools, one of which was Grambling.

Prior to 1974, the game was viewed as a big in-state rivalry between the two schools (in the days of Jim Crow, Southern and Grambling usually had the pick of most of the good black high school players in Louisiana). However, it was not nearly the media spectacle that it is today. After it was re-branded as the Bayou Classic and moved to New Orleans, a trophy was added and numerous events were also scheduled to be held throughout the week leading up to the game itself. Games in the series played before 1974 are generally not included within the context of the Bayou Classic&#x27;s historical lineage (SU led the series 15–10 up until that point). The annual game was known to be touted as a &quot;classic&quot; as early as the 1948 meeting, a game that the Jaguars won in an 18–0 upset before 10,000 fans. A brawl during that game led to a suspension of the series for the next decade (a period in which the Jaguars won three black national championships) and delayed GSU&#x27;s admittance to SWAC membership until 1958, shortly before the rivalry was resumed. With the renewal of the series in 1959, the game was again billed as a &quot;classic&quot; but proved a bittersweet return as five fans were killed in a vehicular accident on their way to the game. The series was again interrupted in 1972, this time due to political unrest on host Southern&#x27;s campus—which resulted in a forfeiture by SU. The game was then permanently moved to off-campus neutral sites the following year, drawing a large crowd of 40,000 in Shreveport, Louisiana, and influencing the decision to create the Bayou Classic.

<doc id="1216597" wikidata="Q3736114" url="?curid=1216597" title="Alan Turing Memorial">
<text>The Alan Turing Memorial, situated in Sackville Gardens in Manchester, England, is a sculpture in memory of Alan Turing, a pioneer of modern computing. 

Turing is believed to have taken his own life in 1954, two years after being convicted of gross indecency (i.e. homosexual acts). As such, he is as much a gay icon as an icon of computing, and the memorial is situated near to Canal Street, Manchester&#x27;s gay village.

Turing is depicted sitting on a bench situated in a central position in the park, holding an apple. On Turing&#x27;s left is the University of Manchester and on his right is Canal Street. Sculptor Glyn Hughes said the park was chosen as the location for the statue because &quot;It&#x27;s got the university science buildings...on one side and it&#x27;s got all the gay bars on the other side, where apparently he spent most of his evenings.&quot; 

The statue was unveiled on 23 June, Turing&#x27;s birthday, in 2001. It was conceived by Richard Humphry, a barrister from Stockport, who set up the Alan Turing Memorial Fund in order to raise the necessary funds. Humphry had come up with the idea of a statue after seeing Hugh Whitemore&#x27;s play &quot;Breaking the Code&quot;, starring Derek Jacobi. Jacobi became the patron of the fund. Hughes, an industrial sculptor from Adlington near Westhoughton, was commissioned to sculpt the statue. 

Roy Jackson (who had previously raised funds for HIV/AIDS and Gay Awareness in Manchester) was asked to assist in the funding raising to make the memorial happen. Within 12 months, through donations and a &quot;village lottery&quot;, £15,000 was raised. It would have cost £50,000 to cast the statue at a British foundry, and so it was instead cast by the Tianjin Focus Company in China.
The inscription in relief on the cast bronze bench reads &quot;Alan Mathison Turing 1912–1954&quot; and &quot;IEKYF ROMSI ADXUO KVKZC GUBJ&quot;. The latter is described by Hughes as &quot;a motto as encoded by the German &#x27;Enigma&#x27;&quot;. The original message is often given as &quot;Founder of Computer Science&quot;, however this is unlikely as the Enigma ciphering system does not allow a letter to be enciphered to itself, while the fourteenth letter of that message (the &quot;U&quot; in &quot;Computer&quot;) is the same as the fourteenth letter of the encoded inscription.

A planning application held by Manchester Archives and Local Studies contains two additional codes that were seemingly intended to be included in the memorial: &quot;MBJSU UEZGQ VKMXC AFROI HHKYD&quot; which decodes to &quot;Pioneer of digital computing&quot; and also &quot;LJYDN VCDTO BAWQL PURCX IZNVE&quot; which was intended to be on the plaque by Turing&#x27;s feet.

A plaque at the statue&#x27;s feet reads &quot;Father of Computer Science, Mathematician, Logician, Wartime Codebreaker, Victim of Prejudice&quot;, followed by the Bertrand Russell quotation &quot;Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth but supreme beauty, a beauty cold and austere like that of sculpture.&quot; Hughes buried his own old Amstrad computer beneath the statue, in tribute to Turing.

<doc id="1216600" wikidata="Q172567" url="?curid=1216600" title="Beşiktaş J.K.">
<text>Beşiktaş Jimnastik Kulübü (, ), abbreviated as BJK, is a Turkish professional sports club founded in 1903 that is based in the Beşiktaş district of Istanbul. The club&#x27;s football team is one of the Big Three in Turkey and one of the most successful teams in the country, having never been relegated to a lower division. It was the first registered sports club in the country and one of the few that acquired the right to bear the Turkish flag on its crest.

Its football team has won 21 league titles including 16 Turkish Süper Lig, three Turkish National Division and two Turkish Football Championship titles. Beşiktaş is also the only team to have won the Süper Lig undefeated, in the 1991–92 campaign. The team last won the Turkish Süper Lig title and Turkish Cup during the 2020–21 season. The club is widely known for scouting international talents around the world, the latest scouted player was a 16 year old (20th July 2008) Maldivian Left-Back. The club&#x27;s home ground is Beşiktaş Stadium, a 42,590-capacity all-seater stadium located by Dolmabahçe Palace. The stadium has been considered one of the best in the world for location, design, comfort, technology, atmosphere, and transportation.

The team also participates in European competitions regularly. Beşiktaş reached the quarter-finals of the 1986–87 European Cup and displayed the best Turkish team performance in the Champions League group stage by earning 14 points and progressing undefeated in the 2017–18 campaign. Beşiktaş have also reached the UEFA Europa League quarter-finals twice, in the 2002–03 and 2016–17 seasons. Based on its UEFA coefficient, Beşiktaş is currently the 5th highest ranked Turkish team and is ranked second all-time after its rival Galatasaray.

The club&#x27;s fan base, Çarşı, is well known globally. They were chosen as the best fan group in voting conducted by American sports viewers due to their 132-decibel noise record at a 2007 match against Liverpool. The group is involved with sociopolitical causes and is traditionally considered to be working-class and left-wing, supporting what is known as &quot;the people&#x27;s team&quot;. The highest ever football attendance in Turkish league history was recorded in a Beşiktaş-Galatasaray derby with 76,127 spectators.

The club also competes in other sports such as women&#x27;s football, basketball (men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and wheelchair), volleyball (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), handball, athletics, beach football, boxing, bridge, chess, gymnastics, athletics, parasports, rowing, table tennis, wrestling and esports.

==History==
===1902–1911: establishment of the club===

Bereket Gymnastics Club was founded on 3 March 1903 under special permission from the authorities. Their sporting activities gained more freedom with the declaration of the Constitutional Monarchy in 1908. After the political events of 31 March 1909, Fuat Balkan and Mazhar Kazancı, who were in Edirne, came to Istanbul with the National Movement. After the restoration of political order, Fuat Balkan, a proven fencing coach, and Mazhar Kazancı, a wrestler and weight lifter, found the youths involved in gymnastics in Serencebey and persuaded them to train together. Refik Bey and Şerafettin Bey, friends of Fuat Bey, were also fencing practitioners. Fuat Balkan made the first floor of his own home as the club&#x27;s headquarters, located in Ihlamur neighbourhood of Beşiktaş. The title of &quot;Bereket Gymnastics Club&quot; was renamed as &quot;Beşiktaş Ottoman Gymnastics Club&quot;. The club was turned into a more comprehensive structure, in which gymnastics, wrestling, boxing, fencing and athletics were emphasized. Mehmet Şamil Şhaplı, one of the founding members, was elected the first president of the club.

On 13 January 1910, the club became the first registered Turkish sports club in Ottoman Empire, with the encouragement of the Governor of Beyoğlu District. The interest among the youths of the neighbourhood in the sports club grew, and the number of members involved in sports quickly grew to 150. The headquarters of the club was moved from Ihlamur, Beşiktaş to Building No. 49 in Akaretler, Beşiktaş. When this building became too small, Building 84, also in Akaretler, Beşiktaş, became their headquarters. The yard behind this building was turned into a sports pitch.

Some of the young patriots from the Beşiktaş district of Istanbul formed two football clubs called &quot;Valideçeşme&quot; and &quot;Basiret&quot; under the leadership of Şeref Bey. Local football clubs &quot;Valideçeşme&quot; and &quot;Basiret&quot; joined the club, in 1911.

For years, the original colours of Beşiktaş were believed to be &quot;Red and White&quot;; and then temporarily changed into &quot;Black and White&quot;, commemorating the martyrs of Balkan Wars, including players of the club. Although most written sources endorse this claim, a detailed study carried out for Beşiktaş&#x27;s 100th anniversary documentary had shown that colour red was never used in club&#x27;s first colours; and colours of the club were always &quot;black and white&quot;.

===1911–1959: initial years of football===

With football becoming the main sport of the Ottoman Empire around 1910, Beşiktaş members slowly started to give more attention to football. In August 1911, Ahmed Şerafettin started the football team. With the outbreak of World War I following the Balkan Wars, sporting activities at the club effectively came to a halt as many athletes left to serve on the front lines. While the end of the war allowed surviving athletes to return, the team faced a difficult period during the Occupation of Istanbul, but was able to recover with the hard work of Şeref Bey. Beşiktaş did not enter the Istanbul Friday and Sunday leagues, and did not have any championships until 1918, when they won the Istanbul Turkish 1st Sports League.

In 1921, that particular league&#x27;s final season, they won it again. In 1924, Beşiktaş entered the Istanbul Football League along with Galatasaray, Fenerbahçe and other Istanbul teams. Beşiktaş became the league&#x27;s first champion of 1923–24 season, but was unable to have more success in the league. Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe were the two dominant teams through the middle of the 1930s.

Beşiktaş won their 2nd Istanbul League title in 1933–34 season, as well as their first Turkish Football Championship in the same year, beating Altay in the final 3–1 on 29 October 1934. In 1937, the Turkish National League was formed. In 1936–37 Istanbul Football League season prior to the National League&#x27;s inaugural season, Beşiktaş finished in fourth place, which earned them a berth in the National League. Beşiktaş finished 3rd place in the National League, behind Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray. In 1937–38 season, Beşiktaş finished in 3rd place in the Istanbul League and, 2nd place in the National League, behind Güneş. Beşiktaş won a record five consecutive Istanbul League championships between 1939 and 1943. In the National League, Beşiktaş finished 4th in 1939, 5th in 1940, 1st in 1941 and 3rd in 1943 (in 1942 the league was not held). The club won 1944–45 and 1945–46 seasons in Istanbul League, as well as the national league in 1944 and 1947. The team visited the United States for a month-long visit in May 1950, and on their return to Turkey, visited president Celâl Bayar.

===1959–2001: from Milli Lig to Süper Lig===
Professionalism in football in Turkey entered into force in 1952. In 1959, the Millî Lig was formed, the nation&#x27;s first professional football league. Finishing in 2nd place at White Group and failing to reach the 2-legged-final in inaugural year of the competition, Beşiktaş won their first title in the following season. In 1960, the club also participated in the European Cup, becoming the first Turkish team ever to participate in the tournament. In subsequent years, Beşiktaş finished third in both 1961 and 1962, as well as second in 1963, 1964 and 1965. In 1966 and 1967, meanwhile, the club won back-to-back championship titles, and in the latter year, they also won their first Turkish Super Cup. In 1968, Beşiktaş finished second.

After 1967, Beşiktaş&#x27;s performance declined slightly, finishing in 8th, 12th, 5th, 4th many times, while Trabzonspor, Fenerbahçe and occasionally Galatasaray continued their success. Beşiktaş only finished in second place once in the decade, in 1973–74 season.

Following a period of 15 seasons with no league title, Beşiktaş put an end to their poor performances in 1981–82 season with a surprise championship title under the management of Yugoslav trainer Đorđe Milić, earning another in 1985–86 season. They finished the league as runners-up four times in the second half of the decade.

Hooliganism was a major problem that had started in Europe and had also spread throughout Turkey. Beşiktaş fan hooliganism had been an issue with many fights inside and outside the stadium, although this has become less of an issue in more recent years.

====1987–1993: Gordon Milne era====

Beşiktaş had their most successful run in the Süper Lig with three consecutive championships under the management of Gordon Milne in the early 1990s. Three players of the squad – Metin Tekin, Ali Gültiken and Feyyaz Uçar – were notable for significant contributions to the team during this period. These players were known as Metin-Ali-Feyyaz (&quot;MAF&quot;) and they formed the front of the team&#x27;s line-up. The trio is regarded by supporters as the best ever attacking line of the club. The supporters composed various chants for the trio devoted to their delighting style on the pitch, their goals, and above all for their friendship and modesty.

The only three-in-a-row title term in club history occurred in the 1989–90, 1990–91 and 1991–92 seasons. Most notably, Beşiktaş became the first and only undefeated champions in Süper Lig history.

Under Milne&#x27;s management, the team adopted the 4–4–2 system. By playing down the lines, crossing and winning balls in the air, the team were in fine form and scored many goals. On 15 October 1989, Beşiktaş broke the Süper Lig record for the biggest winning margin in a game with a 10–0 victory over Adana Demirspor. This match was designated as one of the 16 biggest matches in club history. Collecting 79 points in 34 matches, Beşiktaş won the 1994–95 1. Lig with the German coach Christoph Daum with 79 points, 3 points ahead of Trabzonspor.

===2001–present: recent years===

The club won the Süper Lig title in 2002–03, the centenary year of its existence, under management of Romanian coach Mircea Lucescu, Following a major squad change with 9 arrivals in summer transfer window, including the return of former players Sergen Yalçın and Serdar Topraktepe, winning all 4 Istanbul derbies, losing only 1 game in league fixtures, Beşiktaş secured the title in the penultimate round against Galatasaray with a last minute winner by Sergen Yalçın, concluding the game 1–0 at İnönü Stadium. They also reached the quarter-finals of the 2002–03 UEFA Cup. In the 2008–09 season, Beşiktaş won the league title with coach Mustafa Denizli.

Following the arrival of Şenol Güneş as the head coach in 2015, Beşiktaş won the league back to back in 2015–16 and 2016–17. Following season, they made history as they became the first Turkish club to advance to the UEFA Champions League knockout phase undefeated.

Beşiktaş won the league again in 2020–21, under the management of former player and club legend Sergen Yalçın. On October 27, chaos broke out at the team general assembly, as supporters of the previous presedint and the current one clashed. On June 5, the club signed Giovanni van Bronckhorst as its coach. On November 30 the club fired him following a 3-1 defeat to Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Europa league.

==Grounds==

Between establishing their football department and entering the Istanbul Football League, Beşiktaş played at various grounds. From 1924 they started to play their games at Taksim Stadium.

İnönü Stadium hosted the home games of Beşiktaş for 66 years, between 1947 and 2013. The first football match was played there on 23 November 1947, when Beşiktaş hosted Swedish side AIK, in a friendly game which ended 3–2 in favour of the away team. The club hosted their testimonial game against Gençlerbirliği in the 33rd match-day of the 2012–13 season, which ended in favour of the home side 3–0, on 11 May 2013.

Since 2016, Beşiktaş have played their home games at Beşiktaş Stadium, the successor of İnönü Stadium. The inaugural encounter was held between Beşiktaş and Bursaspor on week 28 of 2015–16 season, ending 3–2 as the first ever win of the hosting Beşiktaş, on 11 April 2016.

<text>Dawn Records was a subsidiary of Pye Records. Active from 1969 to 1975, it was established as Pye&#x27;s &#x27;underground and progressive&#x27; label rivalling the EMI and Phonogram equivalents, Harvest and Vertigo.

The most successful act on the label was Mungo Jerry, whose first two singles reached No. 1 on the UK singles chart. The label also released the 1970 and 1971 Donovan albums, &quot;Open Road&quot; and the double-album&quot; HMS Donovan&quot;. It also released recordings by Man, Paul Brett&#x27;s Sage, Titus Groan, Trifle, Mike Cooper, Heron, John Kongos (before he found greater success on the Fly label), Comus, Atlantic Bridge, Pluto, Atomic Rooster and the Mungo Jerry offshoot, the King Earl Boogie Band.

In October 1970, the UK music magazine &quot;NME&quot; reported that Dawn label acts Demon Fuzz, Titus Groan, Heron and Comus were due to take part in a series of UK concerts in November 1970. At all venues the price of admission was one penny.

Two other acts were Brotherhood of Man in their Eurovision-winning line-up, who released their first album, &quot;Good Things Happening&quot;, in 1974; and Prelude, whose a cappella version of the Neil Young song &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; (No. 21, 1974) was the label&#x27;s only other UK hit single.

<doc id="1216618" wikidata="Q5030931" url="?curid=1216618" title="Spanish Canadians">
<text>Spanish Canadians () are Canadians of full or partial Spanish heritage or people who hold a European Union citizenship from Spain as well as one from Canada. They likely also include many Canadians of Latin-American ethnic origin who use the term &quot;Spanish&quot; as a panethnic ethnonym rather than only their specific country of ancestry. For example, someone whose familial origins are from El Salvador, Honduras, Colombia or Guatemala may call themself &quot;Spanish&quot; to identify with the larger Spanish speaking community. See Latin American Canadian for more information. 

The laws in Spain (see Spanish nationality law) limit who may be granted Spanish citizenship from Latin America to parents and grandparents who once held Spanish citizenship. More recently the legal system in Spain has granted citizenship to Cubans who can prove that their grandparents immigrated to Cuba during the Spanish Civil War (see Historical Memory Law).

==History==

===Spanish claims and presence in Canada===
Spain had land claims to all of Canada since Christopher Columbus claimed the New World for Spain on 12 October 1492. Through the Treaty of Tordesillas signed 7 June 1494 the Pope Alexander VI divided the New World between Spain and Portugal. Portugal received the eastern portion of Brazil and Spain received the rest, which included Canada.(see Treaty of Tordesillas)
Later the Spanish conquistador and explorer Vasco Núñez de Balboa became the first European to see and stand in the waters of the eastern shore of the Pacific Ocean. He accomplished this feat after an arduous trek through the jungles of what is now Panama. Once there Balboa with raised hands, his sword in one and a standard with the image of the Virgin Mary in the other, he walked knee-deep into Ocean, and claimed possession of the Pacific Ocean and all adjoining lands (which included British Columbia) for Spain in the name of his Spanish sovereigns on 13 September 1513.

Then a Greek born Spanish explorer Juan de Fuca in the service of the king of Spain, Philip II, explored the Strait of Anián in 1592, now known as the Strait of Juan de Fuca, between Vancouver Island, now part of British Columbia, Canada and northwestern Washington state, United States.

People from northwestern Spain known as Basques have been landing in Newfoundland since the late 14th century to dry their cod fish, which they caught in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. By 1578, Anthony Parkhurst, a merchant, explorer, and advocate of English settlement in Newfoundland, was able to count over 100 Spanish vessels at Newfoundland, all seeking cod. In contrast, the level of English activity during this period was quite small. Parkhurst claimed that in 1573, there were only four English vessels at Newfoundland.

===Spanish presence in the Pacific Northwest===

Starting in the mid-18th century, Spain&#x27;s claim began to be challenged in the form of British and Russian fur trading and colonization. King Charles III of Spain and his successors sent a number of expeditions to present-day Canada and Alaska between 1774 and 1793, to counter the threat of Russian and British colonizers and to strengthen the Spanish claim. During this period of history it was important for a nation&#x27;s claims to be backed up by exploration and the &quot;first European discovery&quot; of particular places.

Since Spain was busy colonizing Latin America, Canada was ignored until the 18th century when Spain made an effort to explore and set up forts in British Columbia. While it is thought that Sir Francis Drake may have explored the British Columbian coast in 1579, it was Juan Pérez who completed the first documented voyage, which took place in 1774. Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra explored the coast in 1775. In doing so, Pérez and de la Bodega reasserted the Spanish claim for the Pacific coast, first made by Vasco Núñez de Balboa in 1513.

===Spanish dispute with Britain===

A major war between Spain and Britain over British Columbia could have begun via the Nootka Sound dispute in 1789. Spain at the time sent José Martínez to occupy Nootka Sound and establish exclusive Spanish sovereignty. During the summer of 1789, a number of fur trading vessels, British and American, arrived at Nootka. A conflict over sovereignty arose between the captain of the British &quot;Argonaut&quot;, James Colnett, and Martínez. By the end of the summer Martínez had arrested Colnett, seized several British ships, and arrested their crews. Colnett had come to Nootka Sound intending to build a permanent trading post and colony on land previously acquired by his business associate John Meares. At the end of the summer Martínez abandoned Nootka and took the captured ships and prisoners to San Blas, New Spain. The news about these events triggered a confrontation between Spain and Britain known as the Nootka Crisis which nearly led to war. A major war over British Columbia with the British was peacefully resolved via the Nootka Convention, with both parties retaining their claims until a future solution could be finalized.

===The United States inherits Spain&#x27;s dispute with Great Britain===
In the early 19th century, Spain was weakened due to the Napoleonic Wars and the Spanish American Wars of Independence it had to fight in South America against Simón Bolívar and José de San Martín. Eventually, Spain felt that in its weakened state it might lose its North American territories to Britain. As a result of this, Spain decided to transfer its claims to parts of North America to its old ally United States during the American Revolutionary War through the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819. In exchange, the U.S. promised to pay U.S. residents claims against the Spanish government totaling $5,000,000. Consequently, the United States of America has used its inherited Spanish rights to support its claims to the Oregon country which consisted of the Oregon Territory and British Columbia during the Oregon boundary dispute with Britain.

==Population==
The population of Canadians self-identified as of Spanish descent is 325,740, including those with multiple ethnic backgrounds. However, the laws in Spain limit the people who may be called Spaniard to those who can hold a European Union Spanish citizenship. For example, a Latin American would not be considered Spanish or a Spaniard in Spain until he can prove that his most recent parents or grandparents once held a Spanish passport or citizenship. The actual population that can legally be called Spaniard is probably only a fraction of the 325,730. This error originates with the actual Canadians who tend to blindly group all Latin Americans who speak the Spanish language as Spanish.

Spanish Canadians who hold Spanish citizenship from Spain are mostly concentrated in Edmonton, Winnipeg, Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, London, and Mississauga.

Spaniards are found in all areas of the city of Montreal as well as in suburbs such as Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Laval, Brossard, and Greenfield Park. There is no &quot;Spanish quartier&quot;, but Montreal&#x27;s Rue Saint-Laurent is home to Spanish associations, which should not be confused with Latin American Associations, as well as to the Librería Española. They tend to congregate with other Southern Europeans such as Portuguese, Italians, and Greeks, as well as Latin Americans.

The Spanish population in Ontario and Quebec were relatively minor until after World War II and have not really had a profound impact in developing or promoting their language and culture, unlike the Hispanophone Latin American community. This in part is due to the fact that the Spanish population in Canada is much smaller in comparison to the Hispanophone Latin American population. As a rule of thumb, second generation Spanish Canadians seem to have become indifferent or have lost interest in having any ties to Spain and have easily been absorbed into the Anglophone or Francophone Canadian culture. Those Spanish Canadians who retained their language live along with and/or intermarried with Hispanophone Latin American Canadians; Spanish and French are Romance languages and share similarities in morphology and syntax.

The Spanish population in Nova Scotia has been growing in size and popularity in the last years. Atiantic Flamenco, a charitable organization to promote Flamenco in the Atlantic Provinces, is based in Halifax and was founded by Madrid born María Osende Flamenco and Ballet dancer and teacher. This organization hosts events regularly such as the “Halifax Feria de Abril” (Halifax April’s fair in English).

<text>Orford is a suburb of Warrington, in the Warrington district, in the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England.

Originally a small area north of the township of Warrington, it is now a large area between the town centre and the M62, incorporating other small communities, such as Longford. Orford area had a population of 10,950 at the 2001 census.

Orford Hall was demolished in the 1930s after the grounds were given to the town for Orford Park. Jubilee Park, a £30m project providing community and sporting facilities on former waste land between the park and Winwick Road, opened May 2012.

William Beamont, a Victorian solicitor and philanthropist, lived at Orford Hall, which had previously been the seat of the Blackburne family. He founded Warrington&#x27;s municipal library, the first rate-aided library in England, in 1848. His diaries are a valuable source of social history. Another notable local family were the Booths, who built Orford House in the late 18th century, ancestors of Charles Booth of the Liverpool shipowning family.

There is one high school, Beamont Collegiate Academy, and several primary schools.

==Geography==
The area is primarily given over to housing, most being built as council housing, though many council houses are now in private ownership. Boundaries are Greenwood Estate to the east (after which it becomes Cinnamon Brow), Winwick Road to the west (where it becomes Bewsey), the M62 to the north (where it becomes Winwick) and Marsh House Lane to the south (where it becomes Fairfield).

==Transport==
The area is well served by bus services. The services that serve the main part of the district are the Orford circulars (services 20 and 21), services to Gorse Covert and Birchwood (services 25-27), also several services serve Winwick Road on the western edge of the district (services 19, 22, 329 and 360). With the exceptions of the 329 and 360 (operated by Arriva North West), all services are operated by Warrington&#x27;s Own Buses.

The nearest railway stations are those in the town centre, (Central (for services to Manchester and Liverpool) and Bank Quay (for services via the West Coast Main Line)).

<doc id="1216627" wikidata="Q1420025" url="?curid=1216627" title="Ludus Tonalis">
<text>Ludus Tonalis (&quot;Play of Tones&quot;, &quot;Tonal Game&quot;, or &quot;Tonal Primary School&quot; after the Latin &quot;Ludus Litterarius&quot;), subtitled &quot;Kontrapunktische, tonale, und Klaviertechnische Übungen&quot; (&quot;Counterpoint, tonal and technical studies for the piano&quot;), is a piano work by Paul Hindemith that was composed in 1942 during his stay in the United States. It was first performed in 1943 in Chicago by Willard MacGregor. The piece explores &quot;matters of technique, theory, inspiration, and communication. It is in effect, a veritable catalogue of the composer&#x27;s mature style.&quot;

The piece, which comprises all 12 major and/or minor keys, starts with a three-part Praeludium in C resembling Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s toccatas, and ends with a Postludium which is an exact retrograde inversion of the Praeludium. In between, there are twelve three-part fugues separated by eleven interludes, beginning in the tonality of the previous fugue and ending in the tonality of the next fugue (or in a different tonality very close to that). The tonalities of the fugues follow the order of his Serie 1 and use the keynote C (see &quot;The Craft of Musical Composition&quot;).

&quot;Ludus Tonalis&quot; was intended to be the twentieth-century equivalent to J.S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;. Unlike Bach&#x27;s work, though, the non-fugal pieces in &quot;Ludus Tonalis&quot; frequently repeat the work&#x27;s main theme.

&quot;Ludus Tonalis&quot; can be thought of as the most direct application of Hindemith&#x27;s theory that the twelve tones of the equally tempered scale all relate to a single one of them (called a tonic or keynote). The affinity of each note with the keynote is directly related to its position on the harmonic scale. In this system, the major-minor duality is meaningless and the practice of modulation is dropped, although subject modulation occurs in the second fugue, to create growing tension.

The first performance of &quot;Ludus Tonalis&quot; in Italy was played by Eunice Katunda in 1948 at the Teatro Piccolo in Milan.

==Structure==

&quot;Ludus Tonalis&quot; consists of 25 movements:

# Praeludium. Partly in C (mm. 1–32) and partly in F (mm. 34–47)
# Fuga prima in C: Triple fugue
# Interludium: Romantic improvisation
# Fuga secunda in G: Dance in time
# Interludium: Pastorale
# Fuga tertia in F: Mirror fugue, where the second half is an exact retrograde of the first, except with voice paddings at their end exits.
# Interludium: Folk dance (Gavotte)
# Fuga quarta in A: Double fugue
# Interludium: Baroque prelude
# Fuga quinta in E: Gigue
# Interludium: Romantic miniature (Chopin style)
# Fuga sexta in E: Rococo style
# Interludium: March 
# Fuga septima in A: Romantic style
# Interludium: Romantic miniature (Brahms style)
# Fuga octava in D: Dance in time (though notated in )
# Interludium: Baroque toccata
# Fuga nona in B: Subject transformation fugue
# Interludium: Pastorale
# Fuga decima in D: Inversion fugue
# Interludium: Folk dance (Courante)
# Fuga undecima in B (canon): Accompanied canon
# Interludium: Romantic waltz
# Fuga duodecima in F: Stretto fugue
# Postludium: Retrograde inversion of the Praeludium.

There is a striking symmetry around the center of the cycle (the march).

<text>The Democratic Left Party (, abbreviated DSP) is a Turkish political party, founded on 14 November 1985 by Rahşan Ecevit.

==History==

===1985–1999===
The DSP, a social-democratic oriented party, was registered on 14 November 1985 by Rahşan Ecevit, wife of Bülent Ecevit, as he was banned from political life after the 1980 coup d&#x27;état.

In 1986, Bülent Ecevit addressed the DSP convention in Ankara, declaring his support for the party. The address landed him in court for allegedly violating the political bans. The DSP was unable, however, to achieve a substantial showing in the 1986 Turkish parliamentary by-elections even though Ecevit, despite his ban, continued to campaign at the party&#x27;s rallies as a &quot;guest speaker&quot;.

The political ban on Ecevit was lifted following a referendum in 1987. Later that year, Rahşan Ecevit handed over the rule of the party to her spouse. But the party failed to pass the 10% national threshold needed for a political party to have a seat in Parliament in the 1987 elections, prompting the Ecevits to step down from their positions in the party.

In 1988, Necdet Karababa was elected as the new party leader. However, the next year, Ecevit was reelected as party chairman in the party convention. Two years later in 1991, the DSP received 10.75% of the votes in the elections allowing the party to have seven seats in the Parliament. This also meant the return of Ecevit to the Parliament after 11 years.

It was a minor party until it won 76 parliamentary seats in the December 1995 elections. Again in 1995, the party started to suffer from inner conflicts after years of serenity. The inner conflicts in the party ended with the dismissal of Erdal Kesebir, MP for Edirne and three other DSP members.

In 1997, the DSP became a partner of a three-way coalition government led by Mesut Yılmaz who at the time was the leader of the Motherland Party (Turkish: Anavatan Partisi). Ecevit became the deputy prime minister.

In 1998, the 55th government of Turkey was toppled by a censure motion. Ecevit received the mandate to form a new government. He founded a minority government of DSP in 1999 to carry the country to general elections.

=== 1999–2002 ===
Boosted by the capture of the leader of the PKK, Abdullah Öcalan, during his premiership, Ecevit and the DSP won 22,19% of the votes in the elections of April 1999 and took 136 of the 550 seats in the Turkish Parliament becoming the leading party in a coalition with ANAP and MHP. Its leader Bülent Ecevit became the Prime Minister of Turkey for the fifth time.

This government passed many important laws, including banking reform, unemployment insurance, a law to ensure the autonomy of the Central Bank, qualified industrial zones, tender law, employment incentive law, to name a few. The government also changed 34 articles of the Constitution to widen fundamental rights and freedoms, and did this with the approval of all the parties in parliament. Turkey became a candidate country to the European Union (without any political preconditions and with equal treatment as all other candidate countries). Three major EU harmonisation packages were passed during this government, including the most comprehensive package of 3 August 2002, which included the removal of the death penalty and many changes in fundamental rights and freedoms. An economic crisis which resulted from long overdue problems from previous governments caused a drop in the currency in February 2001. But two months later, the government passed a series of very comprehensive economic reforms which included changes to the tender law, economic social council law, unemployment insurance, the restructuring of state banks, accreditation law, law on capital markets, and a law on industrial zones which enabled the high growth of 2002–2007.

The party staunchly opposed the invasion of Iraq by the US. Ecevit himself was a vocal critic of the invasion, arguing that it would destabilize the region and cause harm to innocent civilians. Ecevit said he favors lifting some economic sanctions against Iraq, the first such statement by a Turkish leader since the sanctions were imposed following Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

The DSP was weakened by internal divisions in 2001, when Deputy Prime Minister Hüsamettin Özkan and several other leading DSP politicians and MPs founded the New Turkey Party. The year after, its government coalition partner MHP called for early elections, which were held on 3 November 2002. None of the three coalition parties were able to pass the 10% national threshold in those elections.

=== 2002–present ===
Before the 6th Party Congress on 25 July 2004, Bülent Ecevit announced that he would step down as party leader and leave active politics. During the congress, Zeki Sezer, deputy chairman since 2001, was elected as the new chairman of the party.

DSP entered the 2007 elections together with the Republican People&#x27;s Party (Turkish: Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi, CHP). The DSP-CHP alliance won 20.85% of the votes, with the DSP getting 13 seats in Parliament.

In 2008, together with many other politicians joining the DSP before the local elections of 2009, Mustafa Sarıgül, the Mayor of the Istanbul district of Şişli officially joined the party.

DSP got only 2.75% of votes in the local elections of 2009. Zeki Sezer resigned and Masum Türker succeeded him. After Türker&#x27;s succession, both Mustafa Sarıgül, the deputy of Şişli, and Rahşan Ecevit, the widow of Bülent Ecevit, resigned from the party and created short lived Democratic Left People&#x27;s Party. Democratic Left People&#x27;s Party dissolved itself after six months. After 2011 general elections, DSP received a major decline in Turkish politics, getting less than 0.25% votes in subsequent elections in 2011 and 2015. In 2015, Önder Aksakal succeeded Türker as party leader. The party lost eligibility to contest in 2018 elections, and they supported Nation Alliance.

==== 2023 general election ====
In February 2023, Muharrem İnce, the leader of the Homeland Party announced that his party was discussing an electoral alliance with the Democratic Left Party, the Victory Party, True Party and the Justice Party for the 2023 Turkish general election. On 8 March 2023, the party announced that it would not support the candidacy of CHP&#x27;s Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu for the 2023 Turkish presidential election. Furthermore, on 9 March 2023, a pro-Erdoğan journalist, Mahmut Övür claimed that DSP would join the People&#x27;s Alliance.

On 7 April 2023, DSP decided to support Erdoğan in the 2023 presidential elections and run under the AKP lists in the parliamentary elections. The decision to support Erdoğan caused 74 former DSP ministers and deputies to split from DSP and support Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu.

==Political views==
The term &quot;Demokratik Sol&quot; (Democratic Left) was created by Bülent Ecevit in his late CHP period with the left of center movement, as a mix of social democracy, social liberalism, democratic socialism, secularism and Kemalism. With this term, the party established a link between universal values of the left and national-cultural heritage which makes the ideology &quot;domestic&quot;. In other words, contemporary social democracy is made compatible with the conditions of Turkey. With Democratic Left, Ecevit made up a new synthesis by articulating new dimensions such as democratic socialism and social democracy to the national independence movement or Kemalism. The symbol of the white dove (&quot;Ak Güvercin&quot;) was selected to symbolize the pacifism and social accordance.

Under Ecevit, DSP approved of the Turkish adhesion to the European Union, although it criticized the content of the European Union Customs Union. During the premiership of Ecevit in 1999, Turkey became a candidate for the EU. However, under its current leader Önder Aksakal, it has started to take a more critical approach towards the EU.

DSP is against the idea of a united Cyprus state.

<doc id="1216635" wikidata="Q159227" url="?curid=1216635" title="Karel Kramář">
<text>Karel Kramář (27 December 1860 – 26 May 1937) was a Czech politician. He was a representative of the major Czech political party, the Young Czechs, in the Austrian Imperial Council from 1891 to 1915 (where he was also known as Karl Kramarsch), becoming the party leader in 1897.

During the First World War, Kramář was imprisoned for treason against Austria-Hungary but later released under an amnesty. In 1918, he headed the Czechoslovak National Committee in Prague, which declared independence on 28 October. Kramář became the first Prime Minister of the new state but resigned over policy differences less than a year later. Although he remained a member of the National Assembly until his death in 1937, his conservative nationalism was out of tune with the main political establishment, represented by the figures of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk and Edvard Beneš.

==Early life==
He was born in Vysoké nad Jizerou (Hochstadt an der Iser), near the northern border of what is now the Czech Republic, into a wealthy family. He was the only one of five children to survive to school age.

Kramář was educated at the universities of Prague, Strasbourg and Berlin, and also at the École libre des sciences politiques in Paris, completing his studies with a doctorate in law. In the 1880s, Kramář played a prominent role in the agitation against the fact that Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague offered instructions almost exclusively in German; demands were made for a Czech language university so that Czech students could be educated in their own language. The issue of whether the language of instruction at Charles-Ferdinand University would be German or Czech was an extremely controversial one in the early 1880s, leading to frequent fights on the streets of Prague between ethnic German and ethnic Czech students. Finally in 1882, the Emperor Franz-Josef approved breaking Charles-Ferdinand University into two independent branches, with one that offered instructions in Czech and another instructions in German.

==Early career==
He became the leader of the Young Czech Party in Austria-Hungary and later of the National Democratic Party in Czechoslovakia. In 1896, Kramář become the Austrian Minister of Finance. Like other Slavic politicians in the Dual Monarchy, Kramář disliked the Compromise of 1867 that he felt had elevated the Magyars to a position of political power that their numbers did not warrant and wanted the Austrian Empire to abandon its alliance with Germany in favor of an alliance with Russia. Kramář believed that with time and democracy in the form of universal suffrage would transform the Austrian Empire into a Slavic state as the Slavic peoples were the most numerous of the various ethnic groups in the empire.

Like many other Young Czechs, Kramář was a Russophile, seeing Russia as the world&#x27;s only Slavic great power that counterbalanced the dominant ethnic Germans of the Habsburg monarchy. Kramář&#x27;s wife was a Russian socialite, the daughter of a Moscow industrialist and until 1917 they owned a lavish villa in the Crimea. Kramář was fascinated with Russian culture and loved Russian literature. Tomáš Masaryk often criticized Kramář for the contradiction between his push for universal suffrage and democracy in the Austrian Empire and his support of closer ties with the autocracy of Imperial Russia. The October Manifesto of 1905 was hailed by Kramář as a sign that Russia was liberalizing and would soon become a democratic power in the near-future.

His aim of transforming Austria, coupled with his belief that Russia had turned towards democracy, led Kramář to launch a movement for Slav unity. In 1908, he founded Neo-Slavism, based on the principle of equality among the Slav nations in contrast with Russian-dominated Pan-Slavism of the past. Despite staging two congresses - in Prague in 1908 and Sofia in 1910 – and attempts to found a Slav bank and to stage a Slav industrial exhibition, the initiative failed to achieve Slav unity and reorientate the Habsburg Empire towards Russia. Disagreements amongst the Slav nations proved insurmountable and Neo-Slavism faded away in the atmosphere of increasing international tension prior to the outbreak of the First World War.

Kramář pushed the government to provide greater legal expression of the Czech language, for instance allowing court cases in Bohemia to be conducted in Czech rather than German and for bilingual signs in both German and Czech at Army bases in the &quot;Czech lands&quot; of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia. Kramář had little love for the House of Habsburg, but he was willing to accept that the Czechs remain part of the Austrian Empire, provided that the empire was reorganized to give greater autonomy to the &quot;Czech lands&quot; that consisted of the provinces of Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia.

A liberal nationalist with close ties to the political elite in Prague and Vienna, Kramář pursued a policy of cooperation with the Austrian state as the best means of achieving Czech national goals before the First World War, even as he favored closer ties between the Czechs and the Russian Empire. His commitment to this policy of cooperation with the Austrian government (&quot;positive politics&quot; in the parlance of the day) led him to resign his leadership of the Young Czech party in 1914 as the party drifted toward a more nationalist and oppositional stance. By 1914, Kramář was already drifting out of the political mainstream.

==World War I==
When the First World War began in 1914, Kramář concluded that a victory for Germany and Austria would mark the end of the possibility of reform in the Austrian Empire and to work against the Habsburg monarchy. In the fall of 1914, Kramář advised the other Czech politicians to wait as &quot;the Russians will do it for us alone&quot;. Kramář was referring to the Russian victories in Galicia in September 1914 that saw about 50% of the entire Austrian Army killed, wounded or captured, a crippling blow that ended whatever possibility that might had existed for Austria to be an equal partner with Germany and reduced the Austrians down to very much junior partners of the Germans. The way in Austria-Hungary started to function more and more as a satellite state of Germany led to increasing Czech support for independence during the war as it became clear that if the Central Powers won then there would be no possibility of the Slavic peoples of the Austrian Empire ever becoming the equals of the ethnic Germans and the Magyars. In March 1915, Kramář was together with Přemysl Šámal, Alois Rašín, Josef Scheiner and Edvard Beneš a founding member of an underground group called the &quot;Maffie&quot; which was dedicated to winning Czech independence from the Austrian empire. The &quot;Maffie&quot; was in contact with Russian military intelligence and used secret codes to pass on messages to Petrograd. On 3 April 1915, Kramář learned that the entire 28th Infantry Regiment of the Imperial Austrian and Royal Hungarian Army, which had been recruited from the working class districts of Prague, had surrendered en masse to the Russians in Galicia. Kramář sent a message to the Russians asking that Czech independence be declared to be one of the war aims of the Allies.

On 3 May 1915, Kramář told the Agrarian deputy in the &quot;Reichsrat&quot; Josef Dürich who was about to go abroad to seek Allied support for independence that he should seek a &quot;great Slav empire&quot; under the House of Romanov in which Bohemia would be an autonomous kingdom ruled by some Romanov grand duke. During the First World War the Austrian authorities charged Kramář with treason, tried him and ultimately sentenced him to 15 years of hard labour. Kramář was arrested and charged with high treason on 21 May 1915. His imprisonment acted however to galvanise Czech nationalist opinion against the Austrian state. Kramář&#x27;s imprisonment sidelined him for much of World War I, and allowed his rival Masaryk who was in London at the time to become the public face of the Czech independence movement. On 3 June 1916, Kramář was convicted of treason and sentenced to death. In March 1917, when waiting on death row in prison, Kramář heard of the February Revolution in Russia, which marked the end of his dream that after the war a Romanov would sit on the throne of a restored Bohemian kingdom. Kramář&#x27;s cellmate Alois Rašín remarked &quot;We are finished!&quot;. The new Austrian Emperor Karl I released Kramář as part of a general political amnesty in 1917.

On 13 July 1918 Kramář founded the Czechoslovak National Committee in Prague, in which all the Czech political parties were represented to work for independence from Austria. On 28 October 1918, Kramář had the National Committee issue a declaration in Prague announcing &quot;The independent Czechoslovak state has come into being&quot; and the long centuries of rule by the House of Habsburg over the Czechs had now ended. For the first two days a standoff ensured as the Austrian authorities proclaimed martial law and ordered the arrest of National Committee leaders, but the unwillingness of the troops of the Prague garrison, consisting mostly of ethnic Hungarians and Romanians from Transylvania, to obey orders ensured the Czechs triumphed peacefully. The soldiers had little desire to fight for the collapsing Austrian empire and many of the troops from Transylvania allowed themselves to be draped in the new Czechoslovak flag as they fraternized with the people of Prague.

==Independence==
On 31 October, Kramář, who had gone to Geneva to meet with Beneš, representing the Paris-based National Council, concluded that a new Czechoslovak state would be a parliamentary republic with Masaryk as president, Kramář as premier and Beneš as foreign minister. Kramář was impressed with Beneš&#x27;s skills as a diplomat, reporting to Prague: &quot;If you saw our Dr. Beneš and his mastery of global questions...you would take off your hat and say it was truly marvelous!&quot; Masaryk, was in the United States lobbying for American support for Czechoslovakia when was named president, and as such, Kramář as the premier in Prague was largely the man who ran Czechoslovakia in its first months.

Formerly a close associate of Masaryk, later the first president of Czechoslovakia, the two had been barely on speaking terms by 1914. Kramář, as the most prominent politician in Czechoslovakia, was named the country&#x27;s first prime minister (14 November 1918 – 8 July 1919), much to the displeasure of Masaryk.

In January 1919, the Polish–Czechoslovak War between Poland and Czechoslovakia began over the Duchy of Teschen. The Teschen region, which had a Polish majority and a Czech minority, was very rich in coal. However, the main reason that Kramář gave the Poles an ultimatum, demanding their withdrawal from Teschen, was to strengthen the Czechoslovak claim on the Sudetenland. To allow Teschen to join Poland because it had a Polish majority would create a precedent for the German-speaking Sudetenland to join Germany. Like other Czech politicians, Kramář insisted on the indivisibility of the former Austrian crownlands of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, arguing that everything that was once part of the Austrian Empire&#x27;s &quot;Czech lands&quot; was now part of Czechoslovakia, and maintaining the claim on the Sudetenland that led Kramář to insist so forcefully that Teschen was part of Czechoslovakia.

In first months of Czechoslovakia, wages in the cities fell by 60% in real terms owing to inflation and 350,000 workers, making up 8% of the population were unemployed. Inflation was a major problem in the first months of the new republic, all the more so as Czechoslovakia continued to use the old Habsburg notes, in common with other former nations of the Habsburg Empire, which printed their notes in abandon, in a sense &quot;exporting&quot; their inflation. In February 1919, a degree ordered that only Habsburg notes stamped with the Czechoslovak lion were legal tender, and in April 1919, the Czechoslovak crown was introduced as the new currency. The February degree largely ended the inflation that was threatening the economical destabilisation of Czechoslovakia.

Within the new state, about 150 families owned a tenth of all the land, but half of Czech farmers owned only a half a hectare, and two-thirds Slovak peasant families were landless. In April 1919, Kramář issued a land reform act that limited the amount of land any farmer could own to 150 hectares, thus breaking up all large estates, owned mostly by the German-speaking and Hungarian-speaking nobility. The land was redistributed to smallholders and landless farm labourers. Even Kramář&#x27;s opponent Masaryk called the land reform act &quot;the greatest act of the new republic&quot;, as it stabilised the countryside, creating a class of small farmers who owned the land they worked and contributed to the subsequent political stability of Czechoslovakia in the 1920s. In an attack on the power of the aristocracy, which Kramář viewed as &quot;foreign&quot; because they usually spoke German or Hungarian, all titles of nobility were abolished in the new republic. In an attempt to ward off the appeal of the left, another degree established 8 hours as the maximum that could be worked on a single day, thus giving to one of the key demands of the trade union movement. In May 1919, an anarchist, Alois Šťastný, made an unsuccessful attempt to kill Kramář.

Once independence had been won, Kramář&#x27;s National Democrat Party, whose supporters were mostly conservative and middle-class, had lost much of its &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot;. The conservative Kramář was out of touch with the left-leaning mood of the voters, and because he was in Paris for the first months of 1919, credit for his reforms went to his finance minister, Alois Rašin, and Antonín Švehla. Kramář, a strong Russophile who was married to a Russian, represented Czechoslovakia at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919 but resigned over Foreign Minister Beneš&#x27;s failure to support anti-communist forces in Russia.

Kramář wanted to keep the Czechoslovak Legions fighting in the Russian Civil War until all of Russia was &quot;liberated&quot; from the Bolsheviks, arguing the Czechoslovak Legion should be headed towards Moscow, not Vladivostok. Kramář further believed that once all of Russia came under the rule of Admiral Alexander Kolchak, a &quot;Slavic federation&quot; would be created uniting Russia, Poland and Czechoslovakia together. Both Masaryk and his protégée Beneš saw Kramář as the main danger to Czechoslovak democracy, regarding him as a &quot;reactionary&quot; Czech chauvinist who was opposed to their plans for Czechoslovakia as a multicultural, multiethnic state. Masaryk and Beneš both doubted Kramář&#x27;s commitment to &quot;Western values&quot; such as democracy, enlightenment, rationality and tolerance, seeing him as a romantic Pan-Slavist, who looked towards the east rather the west for ideas, which meant the weight of &quot;the Hrad&quot; (&quot;the castle&quot;), as Czechs called the presidency, was thrown to marginalize Kramář as a political force. Kramář resented the way in which Masaryk openly groomed Beneš as his successor, noting that Masaryk put in articles into the constitution saying the age limit for senators was 45, but the age limit for the presidency was 35, which conveniently made Beneš eligible for the presidency. The charge of Czech chauvinism against Kramář had some substance, as he openly proclaimed his belief that the Czechs should be the dominant people in Czechoslovakia, denounced Masaryk and Beneš for their belief that the Sudeten Germans should be equal to the Czechs and made it clear his opposition to having German as one of the official languages of Czechoslovakia. Kramář announced that the state should strive that within 50 years, the state border corresponds with the linguistic border, so that the German-language areas are eliminated.

After the first general election in Czechoslovakia, Kramář&#x27;s party, now the National Democratic Party, became a minor player in the various interwar governments of the new state. Later, Kramář worked together with Jiří Stříbrný and František Mareš in the National Union (&quot;Národní sjednocení&quot;). As part of their effort to marginalise Kramář, Masaryk and Beneš started to promote a historical narrative that portrayed &quot;the resistance abroad&quot; in the war as the &quot;true&quot; liberators and the founders of the republic, and the &quot;domestic resistance&quot; were disparaged as collaborators with the House of Habsburg. In what became known as the &quot;Boj legendistů&quot; (&quot;the battle of the legend makers&quot;), until the 1920s Kramář and his allies fought Masaryk and Beneš in a war of words in the press over who was the &quot;true&quot; founders of Czechoslovakia.

The &quot;Boj legendistů&quot; began in 1922, when Kramář published his book &quot;Five Lectures on Foreign Affairs&quot;. An extremely hostile book review of &quot;Five Lectures on Foreign Affairs&quot; was published in the newspaper &quot;Čas&quot; under the initials V.S., but it was quickly realised the author was Masaryk. A number of articles were subsequently published in which Masaryk accused &quot;the domestic resistance&quot; of having done nothing of note during the war, and he accused Kramář of still being loyal to the House of Habsburg as late of 1919, taking out of context Kramář&#x27;s remark at the Paris Peace Conference that he was still a monarchist at heart. Masaryk further argued, based on the memoirs of Count Maximilian von Coundenhove, the Austrian commander in Prague in 1918, that the work of the &quot;domestic resistance&quot; in proclaiming Czechoslovak independence on 28 October 1918 had been ineffective and implied that Kramář was actually working with Coundenhove to preserve Austrian rule over the Czech lands.

Writing in 2009, the American historian Andrea Orzoff wrote that the extent that Kramář lost the &quot;Boj legendistů&quot; of the 1920s could be seen even today since most Czechs still revere Masaryk as the &quot;President-Liberator&quot; and, to a lesser extent, the memory of Beneš is still venerated, but Kramář has largely been forgotten in popular memory.

During his time in the National Assembly (1918–1937), Kramář worked in the Committee for Foreign Affairs and made many speeches on foreign policy. Kramář developed a system of dividing countries into popular and unpopular nations. Countries such as the United Kingdom, France and the Russian Empire were in the popular category. On the other hand, Germany, the Soviet Union and Hungary were in the unpopular category.

===Views on Bolshevism and the Soviet Union===
Kramář saw Bolshevism as a dangerous German creation and believed that they would remain loyal to Germany. He also consistently rejected the idea of centralised production and the utopian vision of a classless society. Still, Kramář doubted the long-term viability of Bolshevism, which he thought was unpopular and maintained only through terror. He sincerely hoped that the Soviet Union would collapse during his lifetime.

<text>Florence Marina State Park is a Georgia state park located near Omaha on the eastern shore of Walter F. George Lake. The park is known for its deep-water marina and its water recreation sports, such as fishing and waterskiing. The park also attracts bird-watchers with the chance of seeing herons, egrets and, possibly, bald eagles. The park is home to the Kirbo Interpretive Center, which teaches visitors about Native Americans and displays snakes, turtles, fish, and other artifacts from prehistoric times to the early 20th century. Located just southeast of the park is Providence Canyon State Outdoor Recreation Area.

==History==
The park is on the site of the frontier town of Florence, which was originally named Liverpool, after the English port city. Florence was a prosperous town with a covered bridge linking it to Alabama, a newspaper, bank and hotel. The town went into decline after a flood washed away the bridge in 1846 and the town was bypassed by the railroad. Florence was officially incorporated as a town from 1837 until 1995.

<text>Fly Ashtray is an American rock band, formed in 1983 in the Bronx, New York, by Chris Thomas, James Kavoussi, Eric Thomas, John Beekman and Mike Anzalone. At some point, Thomas and Anzalone left the band which led to Beekman moving from lead vocalist to bassist/guitarist, and then Kavoussi switched from keyboard to guitar. Glen Luttman joined the band at this juncture to play the drums.

Spoog, a side project, resulted with impromptu gigs when one or another member of the band was out of town. Anzalone and Kavoussi also played in Uncle Wiggly. Kavoussi has made solo records billed as Phoaming Edison. The line-up of Thomas, Kavoussi, Beekman and Luttman was stable for a lengthy period until Beekman&#x27;s duties were taken over in 1998 by Dave Abel.

In 2003, Luttman requested a leave of absence from Fly Ashtray, and in the same year Eric Marc Cohen took over drum duties.

The band released two records on Shimmy Disc and worked with Kramer.

The band&#x27;s music was featured in &quot;Responsible Ballet and What We Need Is a Bench to Put Books On&quot;, a dance piece choreographed by Jon Kinzel, and performed at The Kitchen in New York City.

<doc id="1216665" wikidata="Q378223" url="?curid=1216665" title="Chongming Island">
<text>Chongming (), formerly romanized as Chungming, is an alluvial island at the mouth of the Yangtze River in East China covering as of 2010. Together with the islands Changxing and Hengsha, it forms Chongming District, the northernmost area of the provincial-level municipality of Shanghai. At the time of the 2010 Chinese census, its population was .

A stretch of the north shore of the island is not part of Chongming District of Shanghai but are instead two pene-exclaves of Jiangsu, formed by the connection of Chongming to the formerly-separate island of Yonglongsha.

==Etymology==
The island is named for Chongming, an early settlement on the island of Xisha that was named for its placement on relatively high and clear ground.

==History==
Present-day Chongming first developed as two separate shoals—Xisha and Dongsha—during the Wude Era (AD 618–626) of the Tang dynasty. These were initially about apart and located south of the larger island of Dongbuzhou ( ,  ,  &quot;Dōngbùzhōu&quot;), which came to form part of the peninsula of Qidong in Jiangsu. Xisha was also known as Gujunsha. By the first year of Shenlong (705), a town was established on Xisha which was known as &quot;Chongming&quot;. The number, size, and shapes of the islands fluctuated repeatedly over time and with the floods of the Yangtze: In the 3rd year of Tiansheng (1025), a new island arose a little to the northwest of Dongsha which became known as Yaoliusha from the surnames of its early settlers. In the first year of Jiangzhong Jingguo (1101), Sansha rose for the third time, stabilizing 50 Chinese miles northwest of Yaoliusha. During the 12th- and 13th-century Yuan dynasty, Yingqiansha, Matuosha, Zhangpusha, and around six other islands also formed. The early settlers of these islands were mostly fishermen and salt collectors, with their principal saltern at Tianci.

In the 14th year of Zhiyuan (1277) under Kublai Khan of the Yuan, was organized within Yangzhou. Owing to the shifting sands of the islands, however, the county seat needed to be repeatedly moved. During the late Yuan and early Ming, the sparsely-inhabited shoals of the area began to fill with migrants from Pudong and other areas of Songjiang Prefecture. These immigrants introduced cotton cultivation, which spread widely prior to China&#x27;s opening to international trade in the later Qing. There was small-scale textile production in the area, but most of the cotton was exported for use in Songjiang, Hangzhou, and other more developed areas of Jiangnan. In the 2nd year of Hongwu (1396) under the Ming, the prefecture was downgraded to a county but, shortly afterwards, a major subsidence—sinking the entirety of Dongsha and most of Xisha—provoked a mass emigration back to the mainland. Around the same time, however, Sansha expanded towards the north while Yaoliusha simultaneously eroded in the south while building up in the north, &quot;migrating&quot; it towards Sansha.

Chongming County was later placed in Suzhou and then Taicang Prefectures. Over the course of the Ming, numerous shoals arose in succession: Ma&#x27;ansha, Chen&#x27;ensha, Gaomingsha, Xiaoyinsha, Changsha, Yuanjiasha, Xiangsha, Gaotousha, and around 20 others. Over the two hundred years from the beginning of Jiajing (1522) under the Ming to the end of Kangxi (1722) under the Qing, these shoals frequently flooded or collapsed back into the river. Yaoliusha and Sansha eroded away; Xisha, Chenensha, Fanliansha, and others sank. In the west, Pingyangsha arose, then sank, then finally merged with nearby Yuanjiasha, Wujiasha, Xiangsha, and Nansha. Around the end of the Ming dynasty in 1644, these islands were merged all the way to Gaotousha in the west, forming a single mass 200 Chinese miles east to west by 40 north to south. Their unification with remaining nearby islands by 1681 effectively created present-day Chongming, although it remained much smaller at the time. Between the Shunzhi and Kangxi Eras (1644–1722), Rilongsha, Yongansha, Ping&#x27;ansha, Dongsansha, and around 25 others arose without sinking.

Under the Republic, it was organized first under the Nantong and then Songjiang Special Administration District. During the Second World War, Chongming was administered first by a separate pacification team, then as part of Shanghai&#x27;s Great Way Government, and finally as a county of the Wang Jingwei regime, a Japanese puppet state in Nanjing. Nine years after the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, it was placed under the municipality of Shanghai in December 1958. During the Down to the Countryside Movement, many of the &quot;sent-down youth&quot; from Shanghai travelled no further than Chongming. Reclamation, particularly large-scale work on the island&#x27;s northern and eastern tidal flats in the 1960s and &#x27;90s, doubled the size of the island between 1950 and 2010. It began to absorb the separate island of Yonglongsha—creating an enclave of Jiangsu on the northern shore of the island—in 1972.

Dongtan was a proposed ecocity which was planned to open along with the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai but stalled following the 2006 ouster of the Communist Party Chief Chen Liangyu.

==Geography==

Chongming is about running east and west and generally between north to south, covering . The island has an average elevation of above sea level, with the northwest and central areas somewhat higher than the southwest and eastern ones.

===Location===
Chongming is located in the Yangtze River, dividing the river into northern and southern channels immediately prior to its entrance into the East China Sea. The island forms the northernmost part of the municipality of Shanghai, separated by the Yangtze from Baoshan and Pudong New Area, which face each other across the mouth of the Huangpu. In Jiangsu, most of Haimen and Qidong are separated from Chongming by the northern channel of the Yangtze; Taicang County, meanwhile, lies across the southern channel next to Shanghai&#x27;s Baoshan District.

Chongming is about two hours&#x27; distance from central Shanghai.
===Enclaves===

Owing to the continuous expansion of the island, there are two pene-exclaves of Jiangsu present on the north shore of Chongming Island. The island of Yonglongsha appeared in the north channel of the Yangtze most recently in 1937 and was stabilized and expanded by workers from Nantong in Jiangsu during the late 1960s. Administration of the island was divided between Nantong&#x27;s cities of Haimen and Qidong. Farms and then townships were established in both areas. Qidong&#x27;s community of Qilong was connected in 1972 and Haimen&#x27;s Haiyong township joined separately in 1975. Haiyong is now around while Qilong now stretches along of the north shore of the island. As it is usually only about wide, however, its area is only around .
==Environment==
Efforts to improve water quality in local areas successfully resulted in notable recoveries. Furthermore, stable numbers of endangered finless porpoises, have been discovered along the island where two subspecies may occur.

==Landmarks==
Under its poetic name of &quot;Yingzhou&quot;, various locales around the island were treated as its &quot;8 views&quot; during the Ming and Qing dynasties.

Today, Dongping National Forest Park is located in the central part of the island. Dongping Forest Farm was established in 1959, opened to the public in 1989, and became a nationally protected area in 1993. It is Shanghai&#x27;s largest forest park, with artificially-planted trees covering . The island is also home to the Dongtan Nature Reserve and the Chongxi Wetland Park, as well as the Chongming National Geological Park.

==Tourism==
The county runs two 4A-class attractions and four 3A-class attractions. The tourism of the island focuses on three zones - East Chongming, Central Chongming and West Chongming. East Chongming features Dongtan Wetland Park and agritainment options in Yingdong Village and Nanjiang Village. Central Chongming features Dongping National Forest Park, agritainment options at Qianwei Village, Gaojia Zhuangyuan and Ruihua Orchard, Genbao Football Base, Chongming Xuegong (Chongming Museum), Jinaoshan Park, Shou&#x27;an Temple and Sanmin Cultural Village. West Chongming offers Mingzhu Lake Park, Xiling Resort, Xisha Wetland and agritainment at Lugang Village.

==Economy==
Chengqiao&#x27;s Chongming Industrial Zone was established in March 1994 and promoted to municipal status in February 1996. It lies west of the town center and north of Nanmen Port.

Chongming is also a center of Shanghai&#x27;s shipbuilding and maritime equipment industries, whose main base is on nearby Changxing.

==Culture==
Chongming boasts one of Shanghai&#x27;s three Confucian temples, along with Shou&#x27;an and Hanshan Temples, Mount Jin&#x27;ao, and the tomb of Tang Yicen.

Annual festivals on Chongming include the Shanghai Chongming Forest Travel Festival, Chongming Hairy Crab Festival, the Mingzhu Lake Cup Fishing Competition, the Qianwei Autumn Ecological and Cultural Festival, the Shanghai Fishermen Fun Festival, and the Chongming Cook Stove Painting Festival. The Yu Sheng Cup, a national cricket fighting tournament, is held annually outside the Xilai Ranch in Lühua during the National Day holiday in early October, with a purse of .

The Tour of Chongming Island is an annual elite international women&#x27;s cycling race consisting of a one-day race and a stage race.

==Government==

Administratively, the Shanghai side of Chongming Island is divided among 15 towns and 1 township of Chongming County. The township of Xincun occupies the northernmost corner of the island. From northwest to southeast, the towns are Xinhai Lühua Sanxing Miaozhen Dongping Gangxi Jianshe Chengqiao Xinhe Shuxin Gangyan Buzhen Xianghua Zhongxing and Chenjia The Jiangsu side of the island is divided into Haiyong Township and Qilong Township.

==Infrastructure==
Whereas the island was previously only connected to the mainland by ferry service, the Shanghai Yangtze Bridge and Tunnel now connects Chenjia in southeastern Chongming with Shanghai via Changxing and the Chongqi Bridge connects Chenjia to Qidong in southeastern Jiangsu. The Chonghai Bridge under construction will link Xinhai at the west end of the island with Haimen District in Nantong, Jiangsu, while the proposed S7 (Huchong) Expressway would connect Chengqiao directly with Baoshan across the Yangtze.

The new bridges form part of the G40 (Hushan) Expressway connecting Shanghai and Xi&#x27;an. Chongming is also spanned by another 38 highways. The two major highways of the island run along its length, Beiyan Highway to the north and Chenhai Highway to the south. There are 41 bus lines in Chongming County, accessing over 98% of its 227 communities.

18 ferries still connect the island. Chengqiao&#x27;s Nanmen Port offers service to Shidongkou and Baoyang Rd in Baoshan and to Liuhegang in southern Jiangsu; Xinhai&#x27;s Niupeng Harbor to Qinglonggang in Haimen; and other ports offer connections with Wusong and the two other islands of the county, Changxing and Hengsha.

<text>David Rees Rees-Williams, 1st Baron Ogmore, PC, TD (22 November 1903 – 30 August 1976) was a British politician.

==Career==
Rees-Williams was born in Bridgend, Wales, the son of William Rees Williams, of Garth-celyn, Bridgend, and Jennet, daughter of Morgan David, of Bridgend. William Rees Williams was a veterinary surgeon (a Fellow of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons), and had served as a captain in the Royal Army Veterinary Corps. He qualified as a solicitor in 1929. Commissioned into the 6th (Territorial Army) Battalion, Welch Regiment, he was promoted Captain in 1936 and Major in 1938, by which time his battalion had become a searchlight unit. He transferred to the Royal Artillery in 1940, when all searchlight units did so, and ended the Second World War as a Lieutenant-Colonel.

Rees-Williams was elected Labour Member of Parliament for Croydon South in 1945, defeating the incumbent MP, Sir Herbert Williams. In the government he was a minister in the Colonial Office, travelling to East Asia to consider the movements towards independence. His seat was redistributed at the end of the Parliament and he narrowly lost the successor seat at the 1950 general election and was raised to the peerage as Baron Ogmore, of Bridgend in the County of Glamorgan, on 10 July 1950. He served as Minister of Civil Aviation in 1951 and was made a Privy Councillor the same year. Lord Ogmore was President of the London Welsh Trust, which ran the London Welsh Centre, Gray&#x27;s Inn Road, from 1955 until 1959.

Lord Ogmore joined the Liberal Party in 1959 and served as Liberal Party President, 1963–1964.

==Personal life==
In 1930, Lord Ogmore married (Alice Alexandra) Constance, daughter of Walter Robert Wills, Lord Mayor of Cardiff from 1945 to 1946. He had three children. His daughter, Elizabeth Rees-Williams, married the actors Richard Harris and Sir Rex Harrison, the businessman Peter Aitken, and more recently Jonathan Aitken, the former Conservative MP. His grandsons are actors Jared Harris and Jamie Harris and director Damian Harris.

==Honours==
===Foreign honour===
** Agga-Maha-Thayay-Sithu of the Order of the Pyidaungsu Sithu Thingaha (1956)
** Honorary Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (P.M.N. (K)) - Tan Sri (1959)

<text>The Erya or Erh-ya is the first surviving Chinese dictionary. The sinologist Bernhard Karlgren concluded that &quot;the major part of its glosses must reasonably date from the 3rd century BC.&quot;

==Title==
Chinese scholars interpret the first title character &quot;ěr&quot; (; &quot;you, your; adverbial suffix&quot;) as a phonetic loan character for the homophonous &quot;ěr&quot; (; &quot;near; close; approach&quot;), and believe the second &quot;yǎ&quot; (; &quot;proper; correct; refined; elegant&quot;) refers to words or language. According to W. South Coblin: &quot;The interpretation of the title as something like &#x27;approaching what is correct, proper, refined&#x27; is now widely accepted&quot;. It has been translated as &quot;The Literary Expositor&quot; or &quot;The Ready Rectifier&quot; (both by Legge), &quot;Progress Towards Correctness&quot; (von Rosthorn), &quot;Near Correct&quot; (Xue), &quot;The Semantic Approximator&quot; (Needham), and &quot;Approaching Elegance&quot; (Mair).

==History==
The book&#x27;s author is unknown. Although it is traditionally attributed to the Duke of Zhou, Confucius, or his disciples, scholarship suggests that someone compiled and edited diverse glosses from commentaries to pre-Qin texts, especially the &quot;Shijing&quot;. Joseph Needham et al. place the &quot;Erya&quot;&#x27;s compilation between the late 4th and early 2nd centuries BCE, with the possible existence of some core text material dating back to the 6th century BCE, and the continued additions to the text as late as the 1st century BCE.

The first attempts to date the different parts of the &quot;Erya&quot; separately began when the Tang scholar Lu Deming (556–627) suggested that the Duke of Zhou only compiled the &quot;Shigu&quot; () chapter (1), while the rest of the text dated from later. The Japanese historian and sinologist Naitō Torajirō analyzed the &quot;Erya&quot; text and concluded it originated in the early Warring States period, with the Jixia Academy having a considerable hand in it from c. 325 BCE onwards, and the text was enlarged and stabilized during the Qin and Western Han dynasty. Naitō connects the &quot;Shigu&quot; chapter (1) with the first generations of the Confucian School (450-400 BCE), places the family relationships, astronomy, and meteorology chapters (4-8) in the time of Xun Qing (300-230 BCE) with additions as late as 90 BCE, allocates the geographical chapters (9-12) to the late Warring States, Qin, and beginning of Han (300-200 BCE), puts the natural history chapters (13-18) between 300 and 160 BCE, and ascribes the last chapter (19) on domestic animals to the time of Emperor Wen or Emperor Jing of Han (180 to 140 BCE).

The &quot;Erya&quot; was considered the authoritative lexicographic guide to Chinese classic texts during the Han dynasty, and Song dynasty Confucians officially categorized it as one of the Thirteen Classics, &quot;making it one of the more revered works in the history of Chinese literature, not to mention lexicography&quot;. Although the only ancient &quot;Erya&quot; commentary that has come down to us is the (c. 310) &quot;Erya zhu&quot; (, &quot;&quot;Erya&quot; Commentary&quot;) by Guo Pu (276–324), there were a number of others, including the (early 1st century) &quot;Erya Fanshi zhu&quot; (, &quot;Mr. Fan&#x27;s &quot;Erya&quot; Commentary&quot;) by Liu Xin, and the (late 3rd century) &quot;Erya Yinyi&quot; (, &quot;Sounds and Meanings of &quot;Erya&quot;) by Sun Yan, which popularized the &quot;fanqie&quot; system of pronunciation glosses.

Most of these texts about the &quot;Erya&quot; were still extant in the Tang dynasty (618-907) but had disappeared by the Song dynasty (960-1279), when there was a revival of interest in the &quot;Erya&quot;. The Northern Song dynasty scholar Xing Bing () wrote the (c. 1000) &quot;Erya shu&quot; (, &quot;Erya&quot; Subcommentary&quot;), which quoted many descriptions from both ordinary literature and medicinal &quot;bencao&quot; (, &quot;pharmacopoeia; herbal&quot;) texts. A century later, Lu Dian () wrote the (1096) &quot;Piya&quot; (&quot;Increased [Er]ya&quot;) and the (1099) &quot;Erya Xinyi&quot; ( &quot;New Interpretations of the &quot;Erya&quot;&quot;) commentary. The Southern Song dynasty scholar Luo Yuan () subsequently wrote the (1174) &quot;Eryayi&quot; (, &quot;Wings to the &quot;Erya&quot;&quot;) interpretation. During the Qing dynasty, Shao Jinhan (, 1743–1796) published the &quot;Erya Zhengyi&quot; (, &quot;Correct Meanings of the &quot;Erya&quot;&quot;) and the naturalist Hao Yixing () wrote the (1808-1822) &quot;Erya yishu&quot; (, &quot;Subcommentary on Meanings of the &quot;Erya&quot;).

In the history of Chinese lexicography, nearly all dictionaries were collated by graphic systems of character radicals, first introduced in the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;. However, a few notable exceptions, called &quot;yashu&quot; &quot;[Er]ya&quot;-type books&quot;, adopted collation by semantic categories such as Heaven and Earth. The Ming dynasty scholar Lang Kuijin () categorized and published the &quot;Wuya&quot; ( &quot;Five [Er]yas&quot;): &quot;Erya&quot;, (c. 150 BCE) &quot;Xiao Erya&quot; (&quot;Little Erya&quot;), (c. 200) &quot;Yiya&quot; (&quot;Lost Erya&quot; or the &quot;Shiming&quot;), (c. 230) &quot;Guangya&quot; (&quot;Expanded Erya&quot;), and (1125) &quot;Piya&quot; (&quot;Increased Erya&quot;). The more important &quot;Erya-&quot;type books of the subsequent period are the 1579 &quot;Tongya&quot; (, Analogous to &quot;Erya&quot;) compiled by Fang Yizhi (), 1587 &quot;Pianya&quot; (, A Book of Two-Syllable Words) by Zhu Mouwei (), c. 1745 &quot;Bieya&quot; (, Another &quot;Erya&quot;) by Wu Yujin (), and 1864 &quot;Dieya&quot; (, A Book of Double-Syllable Words) by Shi Menglan (). Chinese &quot;leishu&quot; encyclopedias, such as the (1408) &quot;Yongle Encyclopedia&quot;, were also semantically arranged. Needham takes the &quot;Eryas derivative literature as the main line of descent for the encyclopedia in China.

==Content==
The &quot;Erya&quot; has been described as a dictionary, glossary, synonymicon, thesaurus, and encyclopaedia. Karlgren explains that the book &quot;is not a dictionary &quot;in abstracto&quot;, it is a collection of &quot;direct glosses to concrete passages in ancient texts&quot;.&quot; The received text contains 2094 entries, covering about 4300 words, and a total of 13,113 characters. It is divided into nineteen sections, the first of which is subdivided into two parts. The title of each chapter combines &quot;shi&quot; (&quot;explain; elucidate&quot;) with a term describing the words under definition. Seven chapters (4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, and 19) are organized into taxonomies. For instance, chapter 4 defines terms for: paternal clan (), maternal relatives (), wife&#x27;s relatives (), and marriage (). The text is divided between the first three heterogeneous chapters defining abstract words and the last sixteen semantically arranged chapters defining concrete words. The last seven – concerning grasses, trees, insects and reptiles, fish, birds, wild animals, and domestic animals – describe more than 590 kinds of flora and fauna. It is a notable document of natural history and historical biogeography.

The format of &quot;Erya&quot; definitions varies between the first section treating common terms (chapters 1–3) and the second treating specialized terms (4-19). Entries for common terms are defined by grouping synonyms or near-synonyms and explaining them in terms of a more commonly used word, and additional explanations if one of the words had multiple meanings. For instance, &quot;&quot;Qiáo&quot; (), &quot;sōng&quot; (), and &quot;chóng&quot; () all mean &#x27;high&#x27; (). &quot;Chóng&quot; also means &#x27;to fill&#x27; ().&quot; (ch. 1). Entries for specialized terms are defined by grouping related words and giving them a description, explanation, classification, or comparison. For example: &quot;A woman calls her husband&#x27;s father &quot;jiù&quot; (), and her husband&#x27;s mother &quot;gū&quot; (). While alive they are called &quot;jūnjiù&quot; () and &quot;jūngū&quot; (). After their death they are called &quot;xiānjiù&quot; () and &quot;xiāngū&quot; ().

Owing to its laconic lexicographical style, the &quot;Erya&quot; is one of a few Chinese classics that have not been fully translated into English.

<doc id="1216678" wikidata="Q649680" url="?curid=1216678" title="Bạch Mã National Park">
<text>Bạch Mã National Park () is a protected area in central Vietnam, near the city of Huế. It covers 220 km2 and comprises three zones: a strictly protected core area, an administrative area and a buffer zone. The park can be accessed by foot, moped or with a park guide&#x27;s car.

==History==
In 1932, the summit of Bạch Mã was selected by the French engineer Girard to become a hill station for the colonial administration of Hue. In the following years, a village including 139 villas and hotels was created. To accommodate holidaymakers and to avoid commuting on the steep, road to the next major town, there was a post office, a market, and a hospital. By 1937 the number of holiday homes had reached 139 and it became known as the &quot;Dalat of central Vietnam&quot;. Most of the visitors were high-ranking French VIPs. Not surprisingly the Viet Minh tried hard to spoil the holiday – the area saw some heavy fighting in the early 1950s. After independence from the French, Bạch Mã was soon forgotten and the villas abandoned; today they are in total ruin and only a few stone walls remain. At an elevation of 1250 meters above sea level, the national park is a popular summer retreat for the Vietnamese, who come to feel the relief of the cooler temperatures of Bạch Mã.

The area around Bach Ma was first protected as a series of forest reserves in 1937 and was declared a protected area by the government of South Vietnam in 1962. In 1986 the area was established as a national park. The forests of the park, like Cát Tiên National Park, suffered from the use of defoliants like Agent Orange during the Vietnam War.

In 2004, the park was being considered for expansion in order to create a corridor from the border with Laos to the sea.

==Environment==
Bạch Mã National Park is situated in the Annamite Mountains and is one of the wettest places in Vietnam. Its mountains are composed mainly of granite, and the topography of the park is generally very steep. Its position, at the biogeographical border between northern and southern Vietnam, combined with its variety of habitats, ranging from the coast to high mountains, means the park is rich in biodiversity.

===Flora===
The park is located in an area that is considered a centre of plant diversity in Vietnam. The main vegetation type is moist evergreen and montane forest, as well as areas of scrub and grassland where human disturbance has been high.

===Fauna===
The mammals of the park are not well known, though historically it held important species such as the Asian elephant, white-cheeked gibbon and red-shanked douc langur. It also protects important bird species, especially Vietnamese endemics such as the Vietnamese crested argus, Annam partridge and Edwards&#x27;s pheasant, which had been thought extinct. The park has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of many bird species.

<doc id="1216685" wikidata="Q5471725" url="?curid=1216685" title="Fort Mountain State Park">
<text>Fort Mountain State Park is a Georgia state park located between Chatsworth and Ellijay on Fort Mountain. The state park was founded in 1938 and is named for an ancient rock wall located on the peak. The nomination form for the National Register of Historic Places describes the wall as &quot;more of a marker than a fortification, separating the north peak from the southern end.&quot;

==History==
Fort Mountain State Park officially opened in 1936 on land donated by Ivan Allen, Sr. The park was originally . The Civilian Conservation Corps built many of the park&#x27;s facilities, such as the stone fire tower, the lake, the trails and some park buildings. With help from state and federal funding, the park expanded its boundaries during the late 1990s to .

===Ancient wall===
The state park derived its name from an ancient rock wall located on the peak. The zigzagging wall contains 19 or 29 pits scattered along the wall, in addition to a ruin of a gateway. The wall was constructed out of local stones from the surrounding regions around the summit. A 1956 archaeological report concluded only that the structure &quot;represents a prehistoric aboriginal construction whose precise age and nature cannot yet be safely hazarded until the whole problem, of which this is a representative, has been more fully investigated,&quot; while a modern online tourist website states that the wall was built by local Native Americans around 500 AD for religious purposes.

There are several legends concerning the wall. One legend claims that the wall is a remnant of one of the several stone forts legendary Welsh explorer Madoc and his group built throughout the present-day United States. The wall has also been related to the &quot;moon-eyed people&quot; of Cherokee lore. Other speculations of the wall&#x27;s origins and purposes have included a fortification for Hernando de Soto&#x27;s conquistadors and a honeymoon haven for Cherokee newlyweds. A plaque mentioning the Madoc/Welsh legend and the &quot;moon-eyed Indians&quot; was in the park, but has been removed.

==Description==
Situated in the Chattahoochee National Forest, Fort Mountain State Park offers many outdoor activities, such as hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding. There are more than 25 miles of trails inside the park, including paved and unpaved trails. The park is also known for its unique scenery, a mixture of both hardwood and pine forests, several blueberry thickets, and waterfalls. In addition, the park contains a mountain lake. Atop Fort Mountain itself is a tower constructed by members of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). Picnic shelters and the trails to the rock wall were also constructed by the CCC.

The summit of a different mountain in the south-southwest part of the park contains a radio tower for Georgia Public Broadcasting, transmitting TV station WCLP-TV (now WNGH-TV) since 1967; and radio station WNGH-FM since May 2008.

The park is accessible via Woody Glenn Highway (Georgia 2 and Georgia 52).

<doc id="1216688" wikidata="Q1330871" url="?curid=1216688" title="Hardcourt">
<text>A hardcourt (or hard court) is a surface or floor on which a sport is played, most usually in reference to tennis courts. It is typically made of rigid materials such as asphalt or concrete, and covered with acrylic resins to seal the surface and mark the playing lines, while providing some cushioning. Historically, hardwood surfaces were also in use in indoor settings, similar to an indoor basketball court, but these surfaces are rare now.

==Tennis==
Tennis hard courts are made of synthetic/acrylic layers on top of a concrete or asphalt foundation and can vary in color. These courts tend to play medium-fast to fast because there is little energy absorption by the court, as with grass courts but unlike clay courts. The ball tends to bounce high and players are able to apply many types of spin during play. Speed of rebound after tennis balls bounce on hard courts is determined by how much sand is in the synthetic/acrylic layer placed on top of the asphalt foundation. More sand will result in a slower bounce due to more friction.

Of the Grand Slam tournaments, the US Open and Australian Open currently use hard courts, and it is the predominant surface type used on the professional tour.

===Maintenance===
There are numerous hardcourt maintenance methods which are commonly used to keep these facilities in top condition. Some of these include brushing, pressure washing with a cleaning solution and applying chemical treatments to prevent the growth of moss and algae. Anti-slip paint is also applied to hardcourts to give better playing qualities which enhance player safety and performance.

==Prominent brands== 
Some prominent brands of hardcourt surfaces used at professional tournaments include:
*DecoTurf
*GreenSet
*Laykold
*Plexicushion
*Rebound Ace
*SportMaster Sport Surfaces

<text>The Life Grenadier Regiment (), designations I 4 and I 4/Fo 41, was a Swedish Army infantry regiment that traced its origins back to the 16th century. It was disbanded in 1997. The regiment&#x27;s soldiers were originally recruited from the provinces of Östergötland, and it was later garrisoned there.

== History ==
The regiment has its origins in fänikor (companies) raised in the 16th century, these units formed Östergötland Infantry Regiment and Östergötland Cavalry Regiment which merged in 1791 and formed the Life Grenadier Regiment. It consisted of two semi-independent units, &quot;Livgrenadjärregementets rotehållsdivision&quot; and &quot;Livgrenadjärregementets rusthållsdivision&quot; originating from the two merged infantry and cavalry regiments.

The regiment was split in two in 1816, forming 1st Life Grenadier Regiment and 2nd Life Grenadier Regiment. These two units were later merged and reformed the Life Grenadier Regiment in 1928, and the regiment was given the designation I 4 (4th Infantry Regiment). In 1973, the regiment gained the new designation I 4/Fo 41 as a consequence of a merge with the local defence district Fo 41. The Life Grenadier Regiment was garrisoned in Linköping and was disbanded in 1997.

<doc id="1216697" wikidata="Q728867" url="?curid=1216697" title="Gordon Jackson (actor)">
<text>Gordon Cameron Jackson (19 December 1923 – 15 January 1990) was a Scottish actor. He is best remembered for his roles as the butler Angus Hudson in &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; and as George Cowley, the head of CI5, in &quot;The Professionals&quot;. He also portrayed Capt Jimmy Cairns in &quot;Tunes of Glory&quot;, and Flt. Lt. Andrew MacDonald, &quot;Intelligence&quot;, in &quot;The Great Escape&quot;.

==Early life==
Jackson was born on 19 December 1923 in Glasgow, the youngest of five children. He attended Hillhead High School, and in his youth he took part in BBC radio shows including &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;. He left school aged 15 and became a draughtsman for Rolls-Royce.

==Early career==
Jackson&#x27;s film career began in 1942, when producers from Ealing Studios were looking for a young Scot to act in &quot;The Foreman Went to France&quot; and he was suggested for the part. After this, he returned to his job at Rolls-Royce, but he was soon asked to do more films, and he decided to make acting his career. Jackson soon appeared in other films, including &quot;Millions Like Us&quot;, &quot;San Demetrio London&quot;, &quot;The Captive Heart&quot;, &quot;Eureka Stockade&quot; and &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot;. In the early years of his career, Jackson also worked in repertory theatre in Glasgow, Worthing and Perth.

In 1949, Jackson starred in the film &quot;Floodtide&quot;, along with actress Rona Anderson. He and Anderson married two years later on 2 June 1951. They had two sons, Graham and Roddy. The same year, he made his London stage debut, appearing in the play &quot;Seagulls Over Sorrento&quot; by Hugh Hastings.

In the 1950s and 1960s Jackson appeared on television in programmes such as &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;ABC of Britain&quot;, &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Way&quot; and &quot;The Avengers&quot;. In 1955 he had a small part in &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot;, the film version of the BBC TV serial. He later had supporting roles in the films &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, &quot;The Bridal Path&quot; and &quot;The Ipcress File&quot;. In 1969, he and his wife had important roles in &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot;. That year, he played Horatio in Tony Richardson&#x27;s production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; and he won a Clarence Derwent Award for Best Supporting Actor, having also taken part in the film version.

==Later career==
Jackson became a household name playing the stern Scottish butler Angus Hudson in sixty episodes of the period drama &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; from 1971 to 1975. In 1976, he won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Single Performance by a Supporting Actor for the episode &quot;The Beastly Hun&quot;. In 1974, he was named British Actor of the Year and in 1979 he was made an OBE. Jackson was cast opposite Bette Davis for the American television film &quot;Madame Sin&quot; (1972), which was released in overseas markets as a feature film.

Jackson&#x27;s next big television role was in the hard-hitting police drama &quot;The Professionals&quot; from 1977. He played George Cowley in all 57 episodes of the programme, which ended in 1983, although filming finished in 1981. He played Noel Strachan in the Australian Second World War drama &quot;A Town Like Alice&quot; (1981), winning a Logie Award for his performance.

After &quot;A Town Like Alice&quot; and &quot;The Professionals&quot;, Jackson continued his television work with appearances in &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, &quot;Campion&quot; and &quot;Shaka Zulu&quot; and the films &quot;The Shooting Party&quot; and &quot;The Whistle Blower.&quot; He also appeared in the theatre, appearing in &quot;Cards on the Table&quot;, adapted from the novel by Agatha Christie at the Vaudeville Theatre in 1981 and in &quot;Mass Appeal&quot; by Bill C. Davis at the Lyric Hammersmith in 1982. From 1985 to 1986, Jackson narrated two afternoon cookery shows in New Zealand for TVNZ called &quot;Fresh and Fancy Fare&quot; and its successor &quot;Country Fare&quot;. His last role before his death was in &quot;Effie&#x27;s Burning&quot;, and this was broadcast posthumously.

==Death==
In December 1989, Jackson was diagnosed with bone cancer; he died on 15 January 1990, aged 66, in London. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium.

<text>Holme Pierrepont Country Park, home of The National Water Sports Centre is located in the hamlet of Holme Pierrepont near Nottingham, England and on the River Trent. It is used for many differen sports and has received investment which has enabled a major refurbishment of existing facilities as well as introduction of new facilities.

Run by Serco on behalf of Nottinghamshire County Council, it was previously one of five National Sports Centres.

==History==
The centre was constructed during 1970 and 1971 on a former gravel works and required the excavation of one and a half million cubic yards of material. The centre opened in 1971 and won second prize in the 1972 Times/RICS Conservation Awards and was consequently chosen to host the first National Rowing Championships in 1972.

Until 2009 the centre was operated on behalf of Sport England however control was returned to Nottinghamshire County Council due to priority changes around the 2012 Summer Olympics. In 2013 a new management team from Serco Leisure was put in place, on a 21 year contract with an obligation to maintain and upgrade the site&#x27;s facilities.

== Facilities ==
Set in of parkland, Holme Pierrepont Country Park offers water and land based activities. The centre is made up of three pieces of water:

* Regatta lake, a 2,000 metre regatta rowing facility which features either a six lane rowing course or a nine lane Sprint Kayak course,
* A 700 m white water canoe slalom course,
* An open water swimming and Canoe polo lagoon. This used to be the site of a wakeboard cabletow, however this suffered neglect and eventually collapsed into the lake and was removed.

=== Outdoor Adventure Park ===
The Outdoor Adventure Park was formerly known as the Family Fun Park. Opened in 2014, it is located in the Country Park area of the site. It includes:

* Sky Trail High Ropes course
* Mini golf
* Children&#x27;s play area
* Country Park café

=== Skytrail and Sky Tykes ===
The Skytrail is a high ropes course that allows participants to challenge themselves to cross obstacles on two levels without needing to be detached at any point. Sky Tykes is a miniature version for smaller children.

=== Mini golf === 
Beneath the Skytrail is a 9-hole mini golf course that increases in difficulty with each hole.

=== Gym ===
There are two gyms which were opened in 2014 - these include a 60 station Life Fitness gym which overlooks the Regatta Lake and a Strength and Conditioning gym. Equipment includes:

* The New Life Fitness Discovery Range
* Resistance equipment
* Power plate
* Life Fitness
* Training Bikes
* Kayak simulator
* Squat rack
* Two lifting platforms
* Free weights
* Benches
* Assisted chin dip

=== Accommodation ===

The site has 54 refurbished en-suite bedrooms in the main Lakeside building, as well as a self-contained cottage called The Elms, which sleeps up to 11 people. The site also has an 18-acre campsite containing a mixture of grass and hard standing pitches, some available with electric hook up, 5 tipis (introduced in 2016) and 10 camping arches (insulated wooden huts for camping in).

=== Conferencing facilities ===
The centre offers conference and meeting facilities and has four refurbished conference rooms, with the largest room catering for up to 150 people.

Holme Pierrepont Country Park offers team building activities alongside their conferencing packages.

A sports science and medicine centre, ran by the English Institute of Sport, is available for use by governing bodies for physiology, sports injury/rehabilitation and physiological testing.

== Whitewater course ==
The course is a focal point for English whitewater rafting and kayaking, holding international events for slalom, freestyle and wild water racing. One hosted event is the National Student Rodeo, the largest freestyle kayaking event in the world. During this event the Centre received coverage in local news, and publications such as Canoe &amp; Kayak UK magazine.

=== Location ===
The whitewater course is located between the weir on the canalised River Trent and the regatta lake.

=== Construction ===
Built in 1986, the course is made primarily from concrete. It is approximately 700 metres long, drops just over 4 metres in height to produce Grade 3 whitewater rapids. The course is gravity fed, does not use electricity to power it, and therefore is relatively cheap to run.

Due to the nature of the design, swimming through the course is safer than many other locations around the UK due to deep channels and few significant underwater obstructions.

The amount of water flowing through the course depends on rainfall, and canal usage, but due to the large catchment of the Trent, flows between 16 and 25 cubic metres per second are common. As the course is directly connected to the Trent high river levels cause the course to progressively flood from the bottom upwards. The whitewater course is open to the public up to a river level of 2.2m as measured at the Environment Agency Colwick gauging station.

The course was renovated in 2009. Along with maintenance work, some of the original concrete obstacles were removed and Omniflots (large plastic movable blocks) were installed.

== Sports ==

Holme Pierrepont National Watersports Centre is home of British Canoeing, the national governing body for canoeing and kayaking in the UK, whose headquarters are at the site.

The Holme Pierrepont Canoe Club gives lessons on the flat water lake and the course, which is also used for water safety and water rescue training. It also hosts rafting, playboating, slalom; kayaking plus squirt boaters, open boat canoeists and wild water racing.

One of the main sports held at the centre is rowing, using the 2000 metre multi-lane rowing lake. The centre was the venue for the World Rowing Junior Championships in 1973, and for the World Rowing Championships in 1975 and 1986, and many competitions for UK rowing. The safety is outsourced to local lifeguard unit Colwick Park Lifeguards who have been part of the team at Holme Pierrepont since 1979.

The centre is the venue for running and triathlon events, using the lake, internal tracks and easy access to local roads

The centre is the base for the &quot;Holme Pierrepont Running Club&quot;.

The centre was chosen to host the Sea Scout 100 national Sea Scout Centenary Jamboree in August 2009. Over 3000 Sea Scouts attended including the USA and New Zealand.

<text>Holme Pierrepont is a hamlet and civil parish located south-east of the city of Nottingham in Nottinghamshire, England. It is in the Gamston ward of the Rushcliffe local authority in the East Midlands region. The population of the civil parish (which envelops Adbolton, Bassingfield and a fringe portion of Lady Bay) as at the 2011 census was 528, and this reported 568 residents at the 2021 census.

The word &quot;Holme&quot; comes from the Old English and Old Norse words for a small island or low-lying land by a river. &quot;Pierrepont&quot; is northern French for &quot;Stone Bridge&quot; and is the surname of an Anglo-Norman family that once held the manor. Henry Perpount, of Holme by Nottingham, appears as a defendant in a Common Pleas record of 1433.

== National Water Sports Centre ==
The National Water Sports Centre was purpose-built to facilitate the training of elite athletes and the holding of National and International competitions primarily in the disciplines of rowing and both white water and placid water kayaking/canoeing, although it is used to run many other activities. The Centre is set in of country park and boasts a 2000 m Regatta Lake, White Water Slalom Course and Water Skiing Lagoon.

The National Water Sports Centre is currently owned by Nottinghamshire County Council and leased to Sport England. As part of the re-profiling of National Centres, Sport England did not continue to fund the National Water Sports Centre after its management contract ended in 2009.

== Holme Pierrepont Hall ==
Holme Pierrepont Hall is a Grade I listed medieval hall. The hall was built by Sir William Pierrepont around 1500, and inhabited by subsequent generations of the Pierrepont family.

== History ==
There is evidence that Holme Pierrepont was settled by farming communities at least as long ago as the Neolithic era. Archaeological remains from the Bronze Age, Iron Age and Roman period have been found in the parish.

The main historic features of Holme Pierrepont are the Church of St Edmund and Holme Pierrepont Hall.

*1086 – the place comprised a mill, of meadow, and was worth £6
*1257 – Sir Henry Pierrepont marries Annora de Manvers, heir to Holme, and the name Pierrepont becomes attached to the hamlet
*1628 – Sir Robert Pierrepont created Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull by King Charles I
*1715 – Evelyn Pierrepont created Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull by King George I
*1940 – Holme Pierrepoint Estate broken up and sold
*1960 – Proposed power station
* 1971 – Holme Pierrepont National Watersports Centre opens

=== Holme Pierrepoint power station ===
In 1960 the Central Electricity Generating Board put forward a proposal to build a 2,000 MW power station on a 525 acre (213 ha) site at Holme Pierrepoint. The site was convenient for coal supplies delivered by rail; for the availability of cooling water from the Trent; and could be conveniently linked to the nearby national grid. Most conspicuous on the site were two chimneys 600 ft (183 m) high and 8 cooling towers each 375 feet (114 m) high. The site was large enough for a second 2,000 MW station, making potentially a total of 4 chimneys and 16 cooling towers. A Public Inquiry was held over 14 days in 1960. The Inquiry inspector rejected the proposal on the basis of being in conflict with proposed green belt; depressing property values; adding to traffic congestion; and preventing access to sand and gravel deposits. The Minister of Power, Richard Wood, announced he would reject the proposal.

<text>The Vympel R-23 (NATO reporting name AA-7 &quot;Apex&quot;) is a medium-range air-to-air missile developed by Vympel in the Soviet Union for fighter aircraft. An updated version with greater range, the R-24, replaced it in service. It is comparable to the American AIM-7 Sparrow, both in terms of overall performance as well as role.

==Development==
Design of a new missile to arm the MiG-23 fighter started in the mid-1960s under the direction of V.A. Pustyakov&#x27;s design team. Known as the K-23 during its design, the new weapon was intended for use against bomber-sized targets, with &quot;snap-up&quot; capability to attack targets at higher altitude than the launch aircraft. It originally was intended to have a dual-mode seeker using both semi-active radar homing (SARH) and infrared (IR) guidance, but this proved unfeasible, and separate SARH and IR models (&quot;Izdeliye&quot; (Product) 340 and 360, respectively) were developed instead. Test firings were carried out in 1967, although the SARH missile&#x27;s seeker head proved to be extremely problematic.

In 1968 the Soviets acquired an AIM-7 and a Vympel team started copying it as the K-25. A comparison of the two led to the K-23 entering production, based largely on its better range and countermeasures resistance. The K-25 work ended in 1971. Nevertheless, several features of the Sparrow were later used in the Vympel R-27 design.

The missile, designated R-23, entered service in January 1974, the SARH version as the R-23R, the IR version R-23T. The R-23R, weighing , used a monopulse radar which gave it better ECM resistance compared to the AIM-7E-2. The R-23T was lighter at and used a liquid nitrogen-cooled infrared seeker which required it be locked on to the target before launching, either by the launching aircraft&#x27;s radar or IRST. Both versions used the same radar fused warhead, which had a lethal radius of and could bring down bomber-sized targets. In the West these were known as the AA-7A and AA-7B, respectively. An inert training round, the R-23UT, was also developed.

The airframe featured four delta wings arranged cruciform just behind the midpoint of the fuselage, and cropped-delta control surfaces at the extreme rear in-line with the wings. Smaller cropped-triangular surfaces are mounted in-line near the nose: known as &quot;destabilizers&quot;, they serve to improve the rudders&#x27; efficiency at high angles of attack (the R-60 missile uses the same feature). The only external difference between the two versions was the nose cone, which was an ogive for the SARH seeker, and shorter (by 30 cm) and more rounded for the IR version.

The R-23 had a probability of kill of 0.8-0.9, though it could not hit a target maneuvering at greater than 5 G. The launching aircraft was also limited to 4 G when it wished to fire the missile. The infrared R-23T had a minimum launch range of 4 km against a target head-on, but only 1.3 km against a target in a tail-chase engagement. Its maximum range also depended on the target&#x27;s facing in addition to the launcher&#x27;s altitude: at low altitudes this was 11 km against head-on targets and 8–10 km against tail-chase targets; at high altitudes it was 11 km and 4 km respectively. The radar-guided R-23R had similar minimum launch ranges, but much greater maximum ranges: 14 km and 4 km against a head-on target at low altitudes, and 25 km and 8–10 km respectively at high altitudes.

Large numbers of R-23s were built, both by Molniya (ex OKB-4) as well as Vympel (ex OKB-134).

Starting in 1975 an improved version of the weapon was developed to arm the MiG-23ML/MLD, entering service as the R-24 in 1981. Both SARH and IR variants were heavier at and featured a larger warhead with a lethal radius of . The warhead also had a more reliable radar fuse, which greatly reduced the minimum range to for a rear-quarter engagement and for a head-on attack. Both could also be launched by and against fighter-sized targets maneuvering at 7 G.

The SARH R-24R featured a RGS-24 seeker head with superior ECM resistance and lock-on-after-launch capability, which avoided interference from the launching aircraft&#x27;s own radar as the missile passed by its nose. This feature, along with a larger rocket motor and a lengthening of the missile&#x27;s inertial phase of flight, gave it a 30% longer range than its predecessor: 17 km and 4 km against a head-on and tail-chase target at low altitudes, and 35 km and 20 km respectively at high altitudes. The missile could hit targets at altitudes of and even glide into helicopters which were hovering. The IR R-24T had a much improved TGS-23T4 seeker with greater sensitivity, but still required lock-on before it could be launched. At low altitudes its maximum range was similar to the R-23, but at high altitudes it could be used against a tail-chase target from 20 km and a head-on target from 12 km. The missiles were known officially as &quot;izdeliye&quot; (Product) 140 and 160 in the USSR, and AA-7C and AA-7D in the west. The R-23/24 was also produced under license in Romania as the A-911/A901.

The R-24 remained in at least limited Russian service until the withdrawal of the last Russian MiG-23s in 1997.

==Combat record==
===Syria===
The R-23 was used in the Beqaa Valley in June 1982, during the 1982 Lebanon War. However, it is hard to judge its success. Soviet and Syrian sources claim that it achieved a few kills while the Israelis deny this. According to Austrian researcher Tom Cooper, Syrian claims include using the R-23/24 against six F-16As and one E-2C, however, the only confirmed kill is against a BQM-34 drone.

During the Syrian civil war Syrian MiG-23s used R-24R missiles to shoot down 2 Jordanian Selex ES Falcos in the vicinity of Daraa province on 15–16 June 2017.

===Iraq===
Many R-23 / R-24 kills are reported in the war between Iran and Iraq when Iraqi MiG-23s fired them at Iranian F-14As, F-4D/Es and F-5Es.

===Angola===
On 27 September 1987, during Operation Moduler, an attempt was mounted to intercept two Cuban FAR MiG-23MLs. Captain Arthur Piercy&#x27;s F1CZ was damaged by either an R-24 or R-60 AAM fired head-on by Major Alberto Ley Rivas. The explosion destroyed the aircraft&#x27;s drag chute and damaged the hydraulics. Piercy was able to recover to AFB Rundu, but the aircraft overshot the runway. The impact with the rough terrain caused Piercy&#x27;s ejection seat to fire, but he failed to separate from the seat and suffered major spinal injuries.

On 5 April 1985 at 14:30 GMT, two SAAF C-130B Hercules took off to resupply UNITA troops when they were intercepted on their return by a MIG-23ML flown by Cuban pilot Major Eduardo Gonzalez. An R-24R SARH missile was launched first and exploded prematurely against a hill or mountain. This was followed by a R-24T IR missile launched from 5 kilometres away which tracked well but passed between the engines 1 and 2 without exploding. Both Hercules were able to return to base intact.

===Soviet Union===
On 28 September 1988, two Soviet MiG-23MLDs piloted by Vladmir Astakhov and Boris Gavrilov shot down two Iranian AH-1J Cobras that had trespassed into Afghan airspace using R-23s.

<text>Shimmy-Disc is a New York City–based independent record label founded in 1987 by Mark Kramer. Before it was sold to the Knitting Factory, artists like Bongwater, Daniel Johnston, Low, Fly Ashtray, Galaxie 500, King Missile, Boredoms, Ruins, Ween, Gwar, The Semibeings, and Uncle Wiggly recorded on the label. Label founder, Kramer, also has production credits on records by Half Japanese, White Zombie, Yo La Tengo, John Zorn, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, memorable parts of the &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; soundtrack, the Butthole Surfers and many others (some of whom he toured with or otherwise performed alongside). The label also released compilation albums such as &quot;Rutles Highway Revisited (A Tribute To The Rutles)&quot;, 1990, which featured various artists from the label, and also introduced new artists like Paleface. 

In 2020, Kramer revived the Shimmy-Disc label in partnership with Joyful Noise Recordings in conjunction with their artist-in-residence series. Since then the label has released a slew of new records by Paul Leary (of Butthole Surfers), J.D. Pinkus (of Butthole Surfers and Melvins), Hunter S. Thompson, remastered and unreleased material from Daniel Johnston, Bruce Haack, Allen Ginsberg, Edgar Allan Poe (feat. Thurston Moore, Lydia Lunch et. al), Laraaji and others.

<doc id="1216719" wikidata="Q410836" url="?curid=1216719" title="Geraniol">
<text>Geraniol is a monoterpenoid and an alcohol. It is the primary component of citronella oil and is a primary component of rose oil and palmarosa oil. It is a colorless oil, although commercial samples can appear yellow. It has low solubility in water, but it is soluble in common organic solvents. The functional group derived from geraniol (in essence, geraniol lacking the terminal −OH) is called geranyl.

==Uses and occurrence==
In addition to being found in rose oil, palmarosa oil, and citronella oil, it also occurs in small quantities in geranium, lemon, and many other essential oils. With a rose-like scent, it is commonly used in perfumes and in scents such as peach, raspberry, grapefruit, red apple, plum, lime, orange, lemon, watermelon, pineapple, and blueberry.

Geraniol is produced by the scent glands of honeybees to mark nectar-bearing flowers and locate the entrances to their hives. It is also commonly used as an insect repellent, especially for mosquitoes.

The scent of geraniol is reminiscent of, but chemically unrelated to, 2-ethoxy-3,5-hexadiene, also known as geranium taint, a wine fault resulting from fermentation of sorbic acid by lactic acid bacteria.

Geranyl pyrophosphate is important in biosynthesis of other terpenes such as myrcene and ocimene. It is also used in the biosynthesis pathway of many cannabinoids in the form of CBGA.

==Reactions==
In acidic solutions, geraniol is converted to the cyclic terpene α-terpineol. The alcohol group undergoes expected reactions. It can be converted to the tosylate, which is a precursor to the chloride. Geranyl chloride also arises by the Appel reaction by treating geraniol with triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrachloride. It can be oxidized to the aldehyde geranial. Hydrogenation of the two C=C bonds over a nickel catalyst gives tetrahydrogeraniol.

==Health and safety==
Geraniol is classified as D2B (Toxic materials causing other effects) using the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS).

== History ==

Geraniol was first isolated in pure form in 1871 by the German chemist Oscar Jacobsen (1840–1889). Using distillation, Jacobsen obtained geraniol from an essential oil produced in India which was obtained from the so-called geranium grass. This essence, after which the compound was named, was a 50% cheaper substitute for the essence of the proper geranium flower with a similar, although less delicate, odor.

The chemical structure of geraniol was determined in 1919 by the French chemist Albert Verley (1867–1959).

<text>In signal processing, the Wiener filter is a filter used to produce an estimate of a desired or target random process by linear time-invariant (LTI) filtering of an observed noisy process, assuming known stationary signal and noise spectra, and additive noise. The Wiener filter minimizes the mean square error between the estimated random process and the desired process.

==Description==
The goal of the wiener filter is to compute a statistical estimate of an unknown signal using a related signal as an input and filtering it to produce the estimate. For example, the known signal might consist of an unknown signal of interest that has been corrupted by additive noise. The Wiener filter can be used to filter out the noise from the corrupted signal to provide an estimate of the underlying signal of interest. The Wiener filter is based on a statistical approach, and a more statistical account of the theory is given in the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator article.

Typical deterministic filters are designed for a desired frequency response. However, the design of the Wiener filter takes a different approach. One is assumed to have knowledge of the spectral properties of the original signal and the noise, and one seeks the linear time-invariant filter whose output would come as close to the original signal as possible. Wiener filters are characterized by the following:
# Assumption: signal and (additive) noise are stationary linear stochastic processes with known spectral characteristics or known autocorrelation and cross-correlation
# Requirement: the filter must be physically realizable/causal (this requirement can be dropped, resulting in a non-causal solution)
# Performance criterion: minimum mean-square error (MMSE)

This filter is frequently used in the process of deconvolution; for this application, see Wiener deconvolution.

==Wiener filter solutions==
Let formula_1 be an unknown signal which must be estimated from a measurement signal formula_2, where formula_3 is a tunable parameter. formula_4 is known as prediction, formula_5 is known as filtering, and formula_6 is known as smoothing (see Wiener filtering chapter of for more details). 

The Wiener filter problem has solutions for three possible cases: one where a noncausal filter is acceptable (requiring an infinite amount of both past and future data), the case where a causal filter is desired (using an infinite amount of past data), and the finite impulse response (FIR) case where only input data is used (i.e. the result or output is not fed back into the filter as in the IIR case). The first case is simple to solve but is not suited for real-time applications. Wiener&#x27;s main accomplishment was solving the case where the causality requirement is in effect; Norman Levinson gave the FIR solution in an appendix of Wiener&#x27;s book.

===Noncausal solution===
:formula_7

where formula_8 are spectral densities. Provided that formula_9 is optimal, then the minimum mean-square error equation reduces to 
:formula_10

and the solution formula_9 is the inverse two-sided Laplace transform of formula_12.

===Causal solution===

:formula_13

where
*formula_14 consists of the causal part of formula_15 (that is, that part of this fraction having a positive time solution under the inverse Laplace transform)
*formula_16 is the causal component of formula_17 (i.e., the inverse Laplace transform of formula_16 is non-zero only for formula_19)
*formula_20 is the anti-causal component of formula_17 (i.e., the inverse Laplace transform of formula_20 is non-zero only for formula_23)

This general formula is complicated and deserves a more detailed explanation. To write down the solution formula_24 in a specific case, one should follow these steps:

# Start with the spectrum formula_17 in rational form and factor it into causal and anti-causal components: formula_26 where formula_27 contains all the zeros and poles in the left half plane (LHP) and formula_28 contains the zeroes and poles in the right half plane (RHP). This is called the Wiener–Hopf factorization.
# Divide formula_29 by formula_20 and write out the result as a partial fraction expansion.
# Select only those terms in this expansion having poles in the LHP. Call these terms formula_14.
# Divide formula_14 by formula_16. The result is the desired filter transfer function formula_24.

==Finite impulse response Wiener filter for discrete series==

The causal finite impulse response (FIR) Wiener filter, instead of using some given data matrix X and output vector Y, finds optimal tap weights by using the statistics of the input and output signals. It populates the input matrix X with estimates of the auto-correlation of the input signal (T) and populates the output vector Y with estimates of the cross-correlation between the output and input signals (V).

In order to derive the coefficients of the Wiener filter, consider the signal &quot;w&quot;[&quot;n&quot;] being fed to a Wiener filter of order (number of past taps) &quot;N&quot; and with coefficients formula_35. The output of the filter is denoted &quot;x&quot;[&quot;n&quot;] which is given by the expression

:formula_36

The residual error is denoted &quot;e&quot;[&quot;n&quot;] and is defined as &quot;e&quot;[&quot;n&quot;] = &quot;x&quot;[&quot;n&quot;] − &quot;s&quot;[&quot;n&quot;] (see the corresponding block diagram). The Wiener filter is designed so as to minimize the mean square error (MMSE criteria) which can be stated concisely as follows:

:formula_37

where formula_38 denotes the expectation operator. In the general case, the coefficients formula_39 may be complex and may be derived for the case where &quot;w&quot;[&quot;n&quot;] and &quot;s&quot;[&quot;n&quot;] are complex as well. With a complex signal, the matrix to be solved is a Hermitian Toeplitz matrix, rather than symmetric Toeplitz matrix. For simplicity, the following considers only the case where all these quantities are real. The mean square error (MSE) may be rewritten as:

:formula_40

To find the vector formula_41 which minimizes the expression above, calculate its derivative with respect to each formula_42

:formula_43

Assuming that &quot;w&quot;[&quot;n&quot;] and &quot;s&quot;[&quot;n&quot;] are each stationary and jointly stationary, the sequences formula_44 and formula_45 known respectively as the autocorrelation of &quot;w&quot;[&quot;n&quot;] and the cross-correlation between &quot;w&quot;[&quot;n&quot;] and &quot;s&quot;[&quot;n&quot;] can be defined as follows:

:formula_46

The derivative of the MSE may therefore be rewritten as:

:formula_47

Note that for real formula_48, the autocorrelation is symmetric:formula_49Letting the derivative be equal to zero results in:

:formula_50

which can be rewritten (using the above symmetric property) in matrix form

:formula_51

These equations are known as the Wiener–Hopf equations. The matrix T appearing in the equation is a symmetric Toeplitz matrix. Under suitable conditions on formula_52, these matrices are known to be positive definite and therefore non-singular yielding a unique solution to the determination of the Wiener filter coefficient vector, formula_53. Furthermore, there exists an efficient algorithm to solve such Wiener–Hopf equations known as the Levinson-Durbin algorithm so an explicit inversion of T is not required.

In some articles, the cross correlation function is defined in the opposite way:formula_54Then, the formula_55 matrix will contain formula_56; this is just a difference in notation.

Whichever notation is used, note that for real formula_57:formula_58

=== Relationship to the least squares filter ===
The realization of the causal Wiener filter looks a lot like the solution to the least squares estimate, except in the signal processing domain. The least squares solution, for input matrix formula_59 and output vector formula_60 is

:formula_61

The FIR Wiener filter is related to the least mean squares filter, but minimizing the error criterion of the latter does not rely on cross-correlations or auto-correlations. Its solution converges to the Wiener filter solution.

=== Complex signals ===
For complex signals, the derivation of the complex Wiener filter is performed by minimizing formula_62 =formula_63. This involves computing partial derivatives with respect to both the real and imaginary parts of formula_39, and requiring them both to be zero.

The resulting Wiener-Hopf equations are:
:formula_65

which can be rewritten in matrix form:

:formula_66
Note here that:formula_67

The Wiener coefficient vector is then computed as:formula_68

==Applications==
The Wiener filter has a variety of applications in signal processing, image processing, control systems, and digital communications. These applications generally fall into one of four main categories:

* System identification
* Deconvolution 
* Noise reduction
* Signal detection

For example, the Wiener filter can be used in image processing to remove noise from a picture. For example, using the Mathematica function:
codice_1 on the first image on the right, produces the filtered image below it.

It is commonly used to denoise audio signals, especially speech, as a preprocessor before speech recognition.
== History ==
The filter was proposed by Norbert Wiener during the 1940s and published in 1949. The discrete-time equivalent of Wiener&#x27;s work was derived independently by Andrey Kolmogorov and published in 1941. Hence the theory is often called the &quot;Wiener–Kolmogorov&quot; filtering theory (&quot;cf.&quot; Kriging). The Wiener filter was the first statistically designed filter to be proposed and subsequently gave rise to many others including the Kalman filter.

<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotive wheel arrangements, a 2-10-10-2 is a locomotive with two leading wheels, two sets of ten driving wheels, and a pair of trailing wheels.

Other equivalent classifications are:
:UIC classification: 1EE1 (also known as German classification and Swiss classification)
:Italian and French classification: 150+051
:Turkish classification: 56+56
:Swiss classification: 5/6+5/6

The equivalent UIC classification is refined to (1′E)E1′ for Mallet locomotives. All 2-10-10-2 locomotives have been articulated locomotives of the Mallet type.

This wheel arrangement was rare. Only two classes of 2-10-10-2 locomotives have been built: the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway&#x27;s 3000 class, and the Virginian Railway&#x27;s class AE. The 3000 class performed poorly, so the railroad returned them to their original 2-10-2 configuration after no more than seven years of service. The class AE locomotives were much more successful, providing between 25 and 31 years of service; some were scrapped between 1943 and 1945, and the rest were scrapped between 1947 and 1949. None of either class were preserved.

== ATSF 3000 class ==

In 1911 and 1912, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway modified ten 2-10-2 Baldwin-built locomotives into a new 2-10-10-2 configuration dubbed the 3000 class. They were the largest locomotives in the world from their introduction until 1914. They performed well in helper service, but could only go before losing steam. The ATSF reverted them to their 2-10-2 configurations between 1915 and 1918.

== Virginian Railway class AE ==

These ten locomotives were built in 1918 by ALCO for the Virginian Railway. With a width of , they were delivered without their cabs and front low-pressure cylinders and were assembled after delivery. The low-pressure cylinders (on centers) were the largest on any U.S. locomotive; these had to be inclined a few degrees to provide clearance. The boiler was also the widest of any locomotive; Railway Mechanical Engineer says &quot;the outside diameter of the largest course is .&quot; but the drawing shows diameter at the rear tube sheet. Their accompanying fuel tenders were shorter than usual so the locomotive would fit on the Virginian&#x27;s turntables.

This class were compound Mallet locomotives. The rear, high-pressure cylinders exhausted their steam into the huge front cylinders. They could also be operated in simple mode for starting; reduced-pressure steam could be sent straight from the boiler to the front cylinders at low speed, for maximum tractive effort.

The calculated tractive effort was in compound, or in simple for the Virginian locomotives.

The class remained in service until the 1940s. No examples have been preserved.

<text>Adansi is part of Asante group inhabiting the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Adansi forms part of the Paramouncies under Asanteman. Adansihene is the Paramount Chief of Adansi.

== History ==
According to imminent historian F.K.Buah, the Adansiland is considered the origin of some Akan people. In the 17th century, the Adansi were powerful people known for their ability to build beautiful structures. The Akan office of Okyeame (linguist) is said to have originated in Adansi.

History also tells the ancestors of Adanis &#x27;Akrofuom&#x27; may lived at Kokobiante nearby the Seben River in Adansi Town.

In 1873, Adansi Kobina Obeng sought independence from Ashanti because to his geographic location near the British protectorate, just north of the River Pra. After Sir Garnett Wolseley attacked Kumasi and dethroned Kofi Karikari, his successor, Mensah Bonsu, made every attempt to reclaim lost Ashanti dependencies after taking office late in 1874. With the exception of Kwahu, he was able to accomplish this over the course of several years. Adansi is part and parcel of Asante. 

==Distribution==
The Adansi land stretches from the Pra River to the south to the Asante paramountcy of Bekwai to the north. It is also bound to the southwest by the Twi-speaking Denkyera tribe. 

Obuasi is a town in the southern Ashanti Region and is the capital of Obuasi Municipal, a district lying south of Kumasi in the Ashanti Region. Obuasi is the second-largest urban settlement in the Ashanti Region and the eighth-most populous settlement in terms of population, with a population of 168,641 people, according to Ghana&#x27;s 2010 Population and Housing Census. It is the largest settlement of the Adansi people.

Situated on the railway line from Kumasi to Sekondi, it is known for its Obuasi Gold Mine, now one of the nine largest on Earth, gold having been mined on the site since at least the seventeenth century.

<doc id="1216743" wikidata="Q7095919" url="?curid=1216743" title="Open (Cowboy Junkies album)">
<text>Open is an album by the Canadian band Cowboy Junkies, released in 2001. It was the band&#x27;s third independent release after the end of their contract with Geffen Records, and the first of those to feature new material. The album was released on Latent Recordings in Canada, and on Zoë Records internationally.

== Album development ==
While the Cowboy Junkies were touring to support their live album &quot;Waltz Across America&quot;, they began working on new material for what would become &quot;Open&quot;. The &quot;Waltz Across America&quot; tour lasted nine months, with many breaks in the schedule. During the breaks, sometimes Michael Timmins retreated to his hide-a-way to work on new song material. The band would then add two to three new songs a month into their performances, allowing them to evolve on stage. During other breaks, the Cowboy Junkies would go to sound engineer Daryl Smith&#x27;s studio, Chemical Sound, to live record the material they had created that month. The band had worked in several studios that were sterile and impersonal, and always were on the look-out for a comfortable studio they could relax in, especially one where they could set up the whole band. The Junkies had discovered Chemical when they contributed a song for a Gram Parsons tribute album, and they returned there to record &quot;Highway Kind&quot; for a Townes Van Zandt tribute album. They found they could set up in a couple hours, record some tracks, and be done by the end of the day, which took away the pressure of trying to complete the songs in a set recording period. Each visit to the studio, the band would record two or three songs at most, and they took the opportunity to re-record songs later as needed. After the band had recorded about fifteen tracks, they listened to their material, and decided they had the songs for their next album.

Not all the songs were recorded in Chemical. Two of the songs were recorded at Peter Moore&#x27;s home studio. Those two songs required a greater amount of technical control, which is why the Cowboy Junkies turned to Moore. When the band had captured all the tracks for the album, they edited and sequenced the tracks into a cohesive whole, starting very dark with &quot;I Did It All for You&quot;, rising throughout the album to end with a glimmer of hope with &quot;Close My Eyes&quot;, only to bring back some of the dark with a reprise of the opening feedback.

The title of the album, &quot;Open&quot;, has dual meanings. One meaning is being open in a way that is dangerous, and the other meaning is the beneficial idea of open arms, open smile. Perennial art director David Houghton used an image of a venus flytrap to express both meanings. The plant is wide open, ready to catch its prey, being both open and threatening. The Cowboy Junkies also explore, defining and re-defining the meaning of open through their music.

<text>The Susquehannock, also known as the Conestoga, Minquas, and Andaste, were an Iroquoian people who lived in the lower Susquehanna River watershed in what is now Pennsylvania. Their name means “people of the muddy river.”

The Susquehannock were first described by John Smith, who explored the upper reaches of Chesapeake Bay in 1608. The Susquehannocks were active in the fur trade and established close trading relationships with Virginia, New Sweden, and New Netherland. They were in conflict with Maryland until a treaty was negotiated in 1652, and were the target of intermittent attacks by the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois).

By the 1670s, their population had declined sharply as a result of disease and war. The Susquehannock abandoned their town on the Susquehanna River and moved south into Maryland. They erected a palisaded village on Piscataway Creek, but in September 1675, the Susquehannock were besieged by militias from Maryland and Virginia. The survivors of the siege scattered, and those who returned to the north were absorbed by the Haudenosaunee.

In the late 1680s, a group of Susquehannock and Seneca established a settlement on the Conestoga River in present-day Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, where they became known as the Conestoga. The population of this community gradually declined, and in 1763, the last members were massacred by the vigilante group known as the Paxton Boys. While there are a significant number of Indigenous people alive today of Susquehannock ancestry, the Susquehannock as a distinct cultural entity are considered extinct.

==Language==

The Susquehannock were an Iroquoian speaking people. Little of the language has been preserved. The chief source is the &quot;Vocabula Mahakuassica&quot; compiled by the Swedish missionary Johannes Campanius during the 1640s. Campanius&#x27;s vocabulary contains about 100 words and is sufficient to show that Susquehannock is a Northern Iroquoian language, closely related to the languages of the Haudenosaunee and in particular that of the Onondaga. The language is considered extinct as of 1763 when the last remnant community of the Susquehannock was massacred at Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

==Names==

The Europeans who colonized the Mid-Atlantic coast of North America typically adopted the names that were used by the coastal Algonquian-speaking peoples for interior tribes. The Europeans adapted and transliterated these exonyms to fit their own languages and spelling systems, and tried to capture the sounds of the names. What the Susquehannock called themselves is not known.
* The Wendat, an Iroquoian-speaking people, called these people &quot;Andastoerrhonon&quot;, meaning &quot;people of the blackened ridge pole.&quot; The French adapted the Wendat term and called them &quot;Andaste&quot;, but later referred to them as &quot;Gandastogues&quot;.
* The Lenape, an Algonquian-speaking people, referred to them by an exonym, &quot;Menkwe&quot;, from which Dutch and Swedish colonists derived the name &quot;Minqua&quot;.
* The Algonquian-speaking peoples of coastal Virginia and Maryland called the tribe the &quot;Sasquesahanough,&quot; meaning &quot;people of the muddy river.&quot; English settlers in Maryland and Virginia transliterated the Algonquian term, referring to the people as the &quot;Susquehannock&quot;.
* In the eighteenth century, British colonists in Pennsylvania called them the Conestoga, referring to the settlement established on the Conestoga River about 1690. The name may be based on the Mohawk word &quot;tekanastoge&quot;, possibly meaning &quot;place of the upright pole.&quot; Conestoga may also be the anglicized form of &quot;Gandastogue&quot; which is possibly the closest to what the Susquehannock called themselves.

== History ==
===Protohistory===
In the late 15th and early 16th centuries the Susquehannock lived in scattered hamlets on the North Branch of the Susquehanna River in what is now Bradford County, Pennsylvania, and Tioga County, New York. Of Northern Iroquoian ancestry, the Susquehannock became culturally and linguistically distinct before 1500.

A southward migration towards Chesapeake Bay began in the second half of the 16th century, possibly the result of conflict with the Haudenosaunee to the north. The shortening of the growing season during the Little Ice Age, and the desire to be closer to sources of trade goods may also have been factors. The Susquehannock assimilated the Shenks Ferry people in the lower Susquehanna River valley, and established a palisaded village in present-day Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. An archaeological excavation in 1931 revealed that the village (known as the Schultz Site) contained at least 26 longhouses. The Schultz site was largely abandoned due to overcrowding and depletion of local resources. A larger fortified town was constructed near what is today Washington Boro. The town is estimated to have been 250,000 square feet in size with a population of about 1,700 people.
Several smaller Susquehannock sites have been found in the upper Potomac River valley in what is now Maryland and West Virginia that date roughly from 1590 to 1610. Archaeological evidence also exists for a palisaded settlement 30 miles upstream of Washington Boro in what is now Cumberland County that was occupied from about 1610 to 1620.

===European contact===
The first recorded European contact with the Susquehannock was in 1608 when English explorer John Smith met with a group of about 60 &quot;gyant-like&quot; warriors and &quot;weroances&quot; at the mouth of the Susquehanna River, two days journey downriver from their settlement at Washington Boro. Smith wrote of the Susquehannock, &quot;They can make neere 600 able and mighty men, and are pallisadoed [palisaded] in their Townes to defend them from the Massawomekes, their mortal enemies.&quot; Smith also recorded that some of the Susquehannock were in possession of hatchets, knives, and brass ornaments of French origin.

Significant Susquehannock involvement in the fur trade began in the 1620s. Because of their location on the Susquehanna River, the Susquehannock had access to English traders on the Chesapeake, as well as Dutch and Swedish traders on Delaware Bay. Furs, primarily beaver, were traded for cloth, glass beads, brass kettles, hawk bells, axes, hoes, and knives. Although many Europeans were hesitant to trade firearms for furs, the Susquehannocks began to obtain muskets in the 1630s.

In 1626, a group of Susquehannock travelled to New Amsterdam seeking to establish a trading relationship with the Dutch. Isaack de Rasière, the Secretary of New Netherland noted that the Lenape living on the Delaware River were unable to supply furs because of Susquehannock raids. The following year the Dutch established Fort Nassau on the east side of the Delaware River opposite the mouth of the Schuylkill River.

To trade with the Dutch, the Susquehannock had to pass through Lenape territory. English explorer Thomas Yonge (Yong) noted that in 1634 the &quot;people of the river&quot; were at war with the Minquas who had &quot;killed many of them, destroyed their corne, and burned their houses.&quot; By 1638, however, the Lenape and the Susquehannock had reached an accommodation, with the later having been given access to trading posts on the Delaware. It is said that the Lenape became &quot;subject and tributary&quot; to the Susquehannock but this is disputed.

Contact with English settlers on the Chesapeake was limited until English merchant William Claiborne began trading with the Susquehannock . Claiborne established a settlement on Kent Island in 1631 to facilitate this trade, and later erected an outpost on Palmer&#x27;s Island near the mouth of the Susquehanna River.

Relations with the English deteriorated following the establishment of the Province of Maryland in 1634. The new colony formed an alliance with the Piscataway, who were the frequent target of Susquehannock raids. The founding of the colony also disrupted Claiborne&#x27;s trade alliance with the Susquehannock as he refused to acknowledge Maryland&#x27;s authority. When a legal dispute forced Claiborne to return to England in 1637, Maryland seized Kent Island.

The focus of Susquehannock trade now turned to the newly established colony of New Sweden on Delaware Bay. Swedish settlers had built Fort Christina on the west side of the bay near the mouth of the Schuylkill River in 1638. This gave them the advantage over the Dutch in the fur trade with the Susquehannock.

Following a raid on a Jesuit mission in 1641, the Governor of Maryland declared the Susquehannock &quot;enemies of the province.&quot; A few attempts were made to organize a military campaign against the Susquehannock, however, it was not until 1643 that an ill-fated expedition was mounted. The Susquehannock inflicted numerous casualties on the English and captured two of their cannon. 15 prisoners were taken and afterwards tortured to death.

===Alliance with Maryland, 1651–1674===
 Raids on Maryland and the Piscataway continued intermittently until 1652. In the winter of 1652, the Susquehannock were attacked by the Mohawk, and although the attack was repulsed, it led to the Susquehannock negotiating the Articles of Peace and Friendship with Maryland. The Susquehannock relinquished their claim to territory on either side of Chesapeake Bay, and reestablished their earlier trading relationship with the English.

In 1660, the Susquehannock used their influence to help end the First Esopus War between the Esopus and the Dutch.

An Oneida raid on the Piscataway in 1660 led Maryland to expand its treaty with the Susquehannock into an alliance. The Maryland assembly authorized armed assistance, and described the Susquehannock as &quot;a Bullwarke and Security of the Northern Parts of this Province.&quot; 50 men were sent to help defend the Susquehannock village. Muskets, lead and powder were acquired from both Maryland and New Netherland. Despite suffering a smallpox epidemic in 1661, the Susquehannock easily withstood a siege by 800 Seneca, Cayuga and Onondaga in May 1663, and destroyed an Onondaga war party in 1666.

The Susquehannock abandoned their village on the east side of the Susquehanna and moved across the river to the west side. Their new village appears on Augustin Herrman&#x27;s 1670 map of Virginia and Maryland. The Jesuit Relations for 1671 reported that the Susquehannock had 300 warriors, and described a rout of a Seneca and Cayuga raiding party by a group of Susquehannock adolescents.

===Diaspora===
By the 1670s, epidemics and years of war with the Haudenosaunee had taken their toll on the Susquehannock. In 1675, they left their village on the Susquehanna River and moved south into Maryland.

Two reasons for the move have been proposed. Most historians believe that the Haudenosaunee inflicted a major defeat on the Susquehannock since the &quot;Jesuit Relations&quot; for 1675 reports that the Seneca &quot;utterly defeated ... their ancient and redoubtable foes.&quot; Historian Francis Jennings, however, proposed that the Susquehannock were coerced by Maryland into moving. Jennings argued that the Haudenosaunee could not have mounted an attack in 1674 since a munitions shortage in New France meant that the French were unable to supply them with muskets, lead and powder.

Although Governor Charles Calvert of Maryland wanted the Susquehannock to settle on the Potomac River above the Great Falls, the tribe instead chose to occupy a site on Piscataway Creek where they erected a palisaded fort. In July 1675, a group of Virginians chasing Doeg raiders crossed the Potomac into Maryland and mistakenly killed several Susquehannock. Subsequent raids in Virginia and Maryland were blamed on the tribe. In September 1675, a thousand-man expedition against the Susquehannock was mounted by militia from Virginia and Maryland led by John Washington and Thomas Truman. After arriving at the Susquehannock town, Truman and Washington summoned five sachems to a parley but then had them summarily executed. Sorties during the ensuing six-week siege resulted in 50 English deaths. In early November the Susquehannock escaped the siege under cover of darkness, killing ten of the militia as they slept.

Most of Susquehannock crossed the Potomac into Virginia and took refuge in the Piedmont of Virginia. Two encampments were established on the Meherrin River near the village of the Siouan-speaking Occaneechi on the Roanoke River In January 1676, the Susquehannock raided plantations on the upper Rappahannock River, killing 36 colonists, and at the falls of the James River. Nathaniel Bacon, unhappy with Governor Sir William Berkeley&#x27;s response to the raids, organized a volunteer militia to hunt down the Susquehannock. Bacon persuaded the Occaneechi to attack the closest Susquehannock encampment. After the Occaneechi returned with Susquehannock prisoners, Bacon turned on his allies and indiscriminately massacred Occaneechi men, women and children.

The Susquehannock who survived the Occaneechi attack moved downriver and may have merged with the Meherrin.

Other Susquehannock refugees fled to hunting camps on the North Branch of the Potomac or took refuge with the Lenape. Some of these refugees returned to the lower Susquehanna River valley in 1676 and established a palisaded village near the site of their previous village.

In March 1677, Susquehannock refugees living among the Lenape were invited to settle with the Haudenosaunee. While 26 families chose to remain with the Lenape, the remainder merged with the Cayuga, Oneida and Onondaga, and were joined by some of the Susquehannock from the village on the Susquehanna River. Roughly three years later the village was abandoned when the remaining inhabitants also joined the Haudenosaunee.

===Conestoga Town===

In the late 1680s, a group of Susquehannock and Seneca established a village near the Conestoga River in what is now Manor Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania where they became known as the Conestoga. They were later joined by a number of Oneida and Cayuga families. In 1700, William Penn, founder of the Province of Pennsylvania, visited the Conestoga and obtained from them a deed for their lands in the Susquehanna River watershed. In return, a tract of land in Manor Township was set aside for their use. This was confirmed by treaty in 1701.

For the next few decades, Conestoga Town, as it came to be known, was an important trading center, and a meeting place for negotiations between Pennsylvania and various Indigenous groups. Its importance, however, waned as the focus of the fur trade and European settlement moved west. The population declined due to out-migration, and the remaining Conestoga became increasing impoverished and dependent on the Pennsylvania government, who occasionally provided clothing and provisions. By the 1740s, Seneca had become the dominant language with only a few Conestoga still able to speak the &quot;ancient tongue.&quot;.

The Conestoga remained neutral during the Seven Years&#x27; War and Pontiac&#x27;s War. They bartered brooms and baskets, fished, and tended their gardens. By 1763, only seven men, five women and eight children lived in Conestoga Town.

In December 1763, the Paxton Boys, in response to raids by the Lenape and Shawnee during Pontiac&#x27;s War attacked Conestoga Town in the mistaken belief that the inhabitants were aiding and abetting the attacks. The Paxton Boys slaughtered the six Conestoga they found there, and burned the settlement to the ground. Fourteen of the Conestoga had been absent from the village and were given shelter in the Lancaster workhouse. Two weeks later, however, the Paxton Boys broke into the workhouse and slaughtered the remaining Conestoga including women and children.

Two former two inhabitants, a couple named Michael and Mary, escaped the massacre as they were living on Christian Hershey&#x27;s farm near Manheim. Their burial site is recorded in the Historical Marker Database, listed as part of Kreider Homestead.

In 1768, John Penn, the Governor of Pennsylvania paid the Haudenosaunee £200 in goods for the 500 acres of land on which Conestoga Town had stood. In 1775, Cayuga relatives of the Conestoga leader Sheehays received an additional payment of £300.

=== 19th century ===
In 1845, six Conestoga descendants living among the Oneida in New York commissioned Peter Doxtater to obtain restitution for land that had originally belonged to their ancestors in Lancaster County. Doxtater, whose maternal grandmother had lived at Conestoga Town before the massacre, later turned over all legal negotiations to Christian Shenk, an attorney in Lancaster County.

An 1869 property deed shows that Doxtater bequeathed 200 acres in Lancaster County to Huldah Hall, who had been a missionary teacher among the Oneida. Hall advocated for the Conestoga descendants, and may have lobbied for the 1872 joint resolution of the United States Congress. The resolution was introduced by Representative Holland Duell of New York would have recognized the remaining &quot;Conestoga Indians&quot; and would have returned their land on the Manor Township tract. This resolution states that a remnant of Conestoga had been with the Oneida during the massacre of 1763, and that their descendants should have use of the land set aside for them in perpetuity. The resolution died in committee.

===20th century===
In 1941, a bill was introduced by Ray E. Taylor and William E. Habbyshaw of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to provide a reservation for the Susquehannock in Dauphin County. The bill was triggered by the claims of &quot;Chief Fireway&quot; who said he was the &quot;sole surviving chief&quot; of 85–100 Susquehannock in Pennsylvania. The bill made arrangements for tribal members to lease land for a nominal fee and establish a central community in their historic homelands. Under the provisions of the bill, the tract of land would have been called &quot;The Susquehannock Indian Reservation&quot;. While this appropriation bill for $20,000 was passed unopposed in the state legislature, it was vetoed by Governor Arthur James, who was advised by the Pennsylvania Historical Commission that the last of the Susquehannocks had died in the 1763 massacre.

===21st century===
The Conestoga-Susquehannock Tribe, an organization in Pennsylvania that self-identifies as a tribe, offers membership to those who can show documented descent from a known Susquehannock or the 1845 land claimants, for example, those descended from Skenandoa, a war leader of the Oneida during the Revolutionary War. The organization is neither a federally recognized tribe nor a state-recognized tribe. 

Those with partial Susquehannock ancestry &quot;may be included among today&#x27;s Seneca–Cayuga Nation&quot; as well as other recognized Haudenosaunee nations in Canada and the United States.

==Culture==

Little ethnographic information is available about the Susquehannock due to their relative isolation from European settlement. It is widely assumed that their culture was similar to that of other Northern Iroquoian peoples: clan-based, matrilineal, semi-sedentary, and horticultural.

The Susquehannock lived in semi-permanent palisaded villages that were built on river terraces and surrounded by agricultural fields. Although John Smith named six villages on his 1612 map, archaeological evidence indicates that at any one time the Susquehannock had just one or two large settlements in the lower Susquehanna River valley. Roughly every 25 years, when soil fertility and nearby resources became depleted, they would move to a new location and begin anew. Until these villages were located on the east side of the Susquehanna River, however, from to 1675 the Susquehannock occupied a village on the west side of Susquehanna known as the Upper Leibhart site.
Susquehannock villages contained numerous longhouses surrounded by a double palisade. Each bark-covered shelter was up to in length and housed as many as 60 individuals. Multiple families related through the female family line would live in one longhouse. Sons lived within this extended family household until they married, upon which time they would move to their wife&#x27;s family&#x27;s longhouse.

Archaeological evidence from trash and burn pits indicates that the Susquehannock had a varied and seasonal diet. Maize, beans and squash were staple foods, with maize-based meals, usually in the form of soup, making up nearly half of their caloric intake. Deer was the most common animal protein but elk, black bear, fish, freshwater mussels, wild turkey and waterfowl were also eaten. Wild plants, fruits, and nuts supplemented their diets.

Iroquoian people called maize, beans and squash the Three Sisters. In a technique known as companion planting, maize and climbing beans were planted together in mounds, with squash planted between the mounds. Dried crops were kept in circular or bell-shaped subterranean storage pits lined with bark and dried grasses.

Susquehannock women made shell-tempered pottery of various sizes primarily for cooking. Three different pottery types, corresponding to three different phases of occupation in what is now Lancaster County, have been identified. Schultz Incised is a high-collared, cordmarked pottery type that was produced until . The collars are marked with incised lines that form geometric patterns. Schultz Incised has also been found at sites near Tioga Point. Washington Boro Incised, produced between 1600 and 1635, is similar in some respects to Schultz Incised, however, the collar is not as wide. Known as &quot;face pots&quot; their distinguishing feature is the presence of two to four expressionless human faces on the collars. In the mid-17th century, as European goods became more common, pot design became simpler, and many of the pots used for cooking were replaced by brass kettles. Strickler Cordmarked, produced between 1635 and 1680 lacked the collars, geometric designs and face effigies of the earlier pottery types.

While Susquehannock women cultivated crops and managed the household, the men engaged in extended periods of travel for hunting, trading, and raids against neighbouring tribes. They also constructed and tended the fishing weirs that were used to catch American shad and eels.

The Susquehannock relied on a network of footpaths to cross their territory. Of particular importance was the Great Minquas Path between the Susquehanna River and the Delaware River which the Susquehannock used to reach Dutch and Swedish trading posts. For fishing and carrying cargoes of meat, pelts and people across the Susquehanna River, dugout canoes were used.

The Susquehannock typically buried their dead in individual graves in cemeteries located outside the palisade walls. A number of multiple burials have also been found, especially at the Strickler site which was occupied from to . These burials typically were of an adult and one or more children. Bodies were flexed and usually accompanied by a variety of grave goods such as bead or shell necklaces, pendants, tobacco pipes, combs, knives, clay pots, brass kettles, and occasionally gun parts.

Among the gifts that Smith received from the Susquehannock in 1608 were several long-stemmed clay pipes. Tobacco was an important aspect of Susquehannock culture, but its use did not become widespread until the mid-16th century. Almost all graves dating from this period, including those of women and older children, contained pipes among the grave goods. The vocabulary compiled by Campanius includes words specifically meaning &quot;smoking tobacco&quot;, as well as a word for &quot;pipe for smoking tobacco.&quot; Pipes were either formed from clay or carved from soapstone. The bowls were frequently decorated with geometric designs or with human or animal effigies.

Smith described the Susquehannock as &quot;gyant-like people,&quot; however, osteoarchaeological evidence from burial sites in the lower Susquehanna River valley has not shown that the Susquehannock were exceptionally tall compared to Europeans and other Indigenous groups. A recent reevaluation of the skeletal remains in the collection of Franklin &amp; Marshall College has provided an average height for Susquehannock adult males of 174.7 centimeters (68.8 inches), however, skeletal remains in England show a similar average height for adult males in the early 17th century. Smith&#x27;s description was based on an arranged meeting he had with 60 adult males who were likely chosen because they were physically intimidating.

==Legacy==

A number of locations have been named after the Susquehannock:
*Susquehannock State Park in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania
*Susquehannock High School in York County, Pennsylvania.
*Susquehannock State Forest in Potter County, Pennsylvania
*The Susquehannock Camps in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania

Barry Kent&#x27;s &quot;Jacob My Friend: His 17th Century Account of the Susquehannock Indians&quot; is a historical novel about Dutch fur-trader and interpreter Jacob Young who married a Susquehannock woman and had several children.

A graphic novel, documentary, and teaching material, under the title &quot;Ghost River&quot;, a project of the Library Company of Philadelphia and supported by The Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage, addresses the Paxton massacres of 1763 and provides &quot;interpreters and new bodies of evidence to highlight the Indigenous victims and their kin.&quot;

<doc id="1216757" wikidata="Q559237" url="?curid=1216757" title="John Levene">
<text>John Anthony Woods (born 24 December 1941), known professionally as John Levene, is an English actor, producer, entertainer and singer. Although he has appeared in a large number of films and television series, Levene&#x27;s best-known role is that of Sergeant Benton, of UNIT in the science-fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, a role he played from 1968 to 1975.

==Early life==
Levene was born John Anthony Woods in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on Christmas Eve 1941, the eldest child of Austin and Vera Woods (née Blake); he has a younger brother called Michael. Levene was born breeched, jaundiced and was dead for the first couple of minutes of his life after he suffocated from a piece of afterbirth being stuck in his airways and his heart stopped beating for two minutes until the doctor removed the blockage. Levene&#x27;s father was a sergeant in the army and was on board the ; upon his return he was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal by King George VI. Shortly after being temporarily blinded in one eye from falling onto a pen knife, Levene was left bed-ridden for two years after contracting a severe blood infection; he had to have a blood transfusion although the blood he was given was contaminated which made his condition worse giving him severe hallucinations. Levene attended St. Thomas&#x27;s school in Salisbury although missing two years of school due to his illness, being dyslexic and being bullied resulted in him failing his eleven-plus exams.

After leaving school, Levene&#x27;s first job was being a car mechanic at a garage during the day and then being a nurse at the local hospital in the evenings. Other jobs that Levene had later on included being a tallyman, a window cleaner and a cement mixer at a building site at Boscombe Down. Wanting to leave Wiltshire due to having no work prospects and a bad relationship with his father, Levene moved to Jersey and became a menswear salesman in the biggest shop on the island, Noel and Porter. After Leven&#x27;s girlfriend became pregnant with their daughter Samantha, the two married and relocated to London where they had a son, Jason. The family lived next door to Anthony Hopkins before he became famous. Levene would often help the actor learn his lines.

Levene began working in Hope Brothers, a men&#x27;s clothing store on Regent Street in London when Telly Savalas came to the store and encouraged him to sign up as an actor for &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1967). Although he failed to secure a part in the film, since he was not a union member, he became interested in acting. Upon joining Equity, he adopted the professional name John Levene to avoid confusion with another John Woods who was already registered with the union.

==Career==
Levene&#x27;s first acting role was in the television series &quot;Adam Adamant Lives!&quot; in 1967 and shortly after secured a regular role as the desk sergeant in &quot;Z Cars&quot;. Levene formed a good working relationship with the director Douglas Camfield who made roles for Levene in his other television series. Other TV roles included episodes of &quot;The Newcomers&quot; (1966), &quot;UFO&quot; (1970), &quot;Callan&quot; (1972), &quot;The Adventurer&quot; (1972) and &quot;Carry On Laughing&quot; (1975). Levene also featured in the opening titles of the television series &quot;Paul Temple&quot; as the man running down the corridor; there is a moment when the man turns around that he can be easily identified as Levene.

Levene&#x27;s first film part was due to be in &quot;The Man Who Haunted Himself&quot; (1970) with Roger Moore, a film about two versions appearing of the same man, played by Moore. Levene was to play the double when Moore&#x27;s character is in shot with Levene&#x27;s back to the camera. After winning the part and getting on well with Moore, the producers told Levene shortly after that he would no longer star in the film as Moore was concerned that Levene was smarter than he was. Despite this, Levene went on to appear in the films &quot;When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth&quot; (1970), &quot;Zeppelin&quot; (1971), &quot;Go for a Take&quot; (1972), &quot;Psychomania&quot; (1973), &quot;The Blockhouse&quot; (1973), &quot;Dark Places&quot; (1974) and &quot;Permission to Kill&quot; (1975).

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
Levene made his first appearances in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as an uncredited Cyberman due to his tall stature in the 1967 serial &quot;The Moonbase&quot; and as a Yeti in &quot;The Web of Fear&quot;, before appearing in &quot;The Invasion&quot; (1968), again as a Cyberman, in the iconic scene where the Cybermen march down the steps in front of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Levene also made his first appearance as then-Corporal Benton of UNIT in the same episode after the original actor was sacked for being late; Levene was hired instead at the insistence of Douglas Camfield. UNIT were featured heavily in early-1970s &quot;Doctor Who,&quot; and the promoted Sergeant Benton also became a regular, appearing in a total of 67 episodes. Levene struck up a rapport with his co-stars Jon Pertwee (The Doctor), Nicholas Courtney (The Brigadier), Katy Manning (Jo Grant), Richard Franklin (Captain Mike Yates) and Roger Delgado (the Master). Fans of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; often refer to these characters as the UNIT family, and as this era as a &#x27;golden age&#x27; of the show. Levene&#x27;s last regular appearance was in the Fourth Doctor serial &quot;The Android Invasion&quot; in 1975.

===After &quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
In 1977, following his final appearance on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, Levene gave up acting as a career to set up his own audio-visual company, Genesis Communications. He has since directed more than 45 audio-visuals and live events for various clients including the Ford Motor Company, British Airways, KFC, Amway and Revlon.

In 1983 Levene turned down the opportunity to reprise the role of Benton for the 20th-anniversary &quot;Doctor Who&quot; special &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;. Five years later he did return to the role for the 1988 Reeltime Pictures video production &quot;Wartime&quot;.

Levene has worked as an entertainer on cruise liners and has also lived in the United States, where he returned to acting under the name John Anthony Blake. (&quot;Blake&quot; was the maiden name of Levene&#x27;s mother, and as he informed the writers Steve Lyons and Christopher Howarth, he had had a much better relationship with her than with his father.) He has also performed voice-over work for Disney and The Queen Mary Hotel, among other companies.

Levene&#x27;s most recent acting work was in an independent film titled &quot;Satan Hates You&quot;. He has also appeared in an episode of &quot;Big Bad Beetleborgs&quot; and industrial videos. In 2008, Levene co-starred with Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred in &quot;Twice Upon a Timelord&quot;, a video production in which the Seventh Doctor and Ace attend Benton&#x27;s wedding.

Levene&#x27;s music album &quot;The Ballads of Sergeant Benton&quot; was released in September 2012. The same year, he returned to the UK to promote himself and his album at a number of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; events. In 2015 he recorded vocals for an audio adaptation of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; charity novel &quot;Time&#x27;s Champion&quot;.

In September 2017, he joined other &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stars, including showrunner Steven Moffat, in recording audio contributions for the YouTube anniversary video of mutimedia artist Stuart Humphryes.
Levene has also reprised the character of Sergeant Benton for the Big Finish &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio series in &quot;Council of War&quot; (2013), &quot;UNIT: Assembled&quot; (2017) &quot;The Scream of Ghosts&quot; (2019) and &quot;Poison of the Daleks&quot; (2020).

In 2019, Levene published his autobiography, entitled &quot;Run the Shadows, Walk the Sun&quot;. In 2021, Levene took part in a special documentary in which he and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; co-star Katy Manning revisit the village of Aldbourne where they filmed an episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fifty years previously.

<doc id="1216758" wikidata="Q704051" url="?curid=1216758" title="Bo Yang">
<text>Bo Yang (; 7 March 1920 – 29 April 2008), sometimes also erroneously called Bai Yang, was a Chinese historian, novelist, philosopher, poet based in Taiwan. He is also regarded as a social critic. His best-known work is &quot;The Ugly Chinaman&quot;, a controversial book that was banned in mainland China; in it he harshly criticized Chinese culture and the national character of Chinese people. According to his own memoir, the exact date of his birthday was unknown even to himself. He later adopted 7 March, the date of his 1968 imprisonment, as his birthday.

== Biography ==
Boyang was born as Guō Dìngshēng () in Kaifeng, Henan Province, China, with family origins in Huixian. Boyang&#x27;s father changed his son&#x27;s name to Guō Lìbāng () to facilitate a transfer to another school. Bo Yang later changed his name to Guo Yìdòng, also spelled Kuo I-tung (). In high school, Boyang participated in youth organisations of the Kuomintang, the then-ruling party of the Republic of China, and joined the Kuomintang itself in 1938. He graduated from the National Northeastern University, and moved to Taiwan after the Kuomintang lost the civil war in 1949.

In 1950, he was imprisoned for six months for listening to Communist Chinese radio broadcasts. He had various jobs during his life, including that of a teacher. During this time, he began to write novels. In 1960, he began using the pen name Boyang when he started to write a political commentary column in the &quot;Independent Evening News&quot;. The name was derived from a place name in the mountains of Taiwan; he adopted it because he liked the sound of it. In 1961, he achieved acclaim with his novel &quot;The Alien Realm&quot; ( &quot;Yìyù&quot;), which told the story of a Kuomintang force which fought on in the borderlands of southwestern China long after the government had retreated to Taiwan. He became director of the Pingyuan Publishing House in 1966, and also edited the cartoon page of &quot;China Daily&quot; ().

Boyang was arrested again in 1967 because of his sarcastic &quot;unwitting&quot; criticism of Taiwan&#x27;s dictator Chiang Kai-shek and in particular a translation of a comic strip of Popeye. In the strip, Popeye and Swee&#x27;Pea have just landed on an uninhabited island. Popeye says: &quot;You can be crown prince,&quot; to which Swee&#x27;Pea responds, &quot;I want to be president.&quot; In the next panel, Popeye says, &quot;Why, you little...&quot; In the final panel, Popeye&#x27;s words are too faint to be made out. Chiang was displeased because he saw this as a parody of his arrival (with a defeated army) in Taiwan, his brutal usurpation of the presidency (a KMT competitor favored as head of government by the Truman administration was executed) and his strategy of slowly installing his son Chiang Ching-kuo as heir apparent. Boyang translated the word &quot;fellows&quot; as &quot;my fellow soldiers and countrymen,&quot; a phrase used by Chiang Kai-shek. Having detained Bo Yang, the KMT&#x27;s &quot;military interrogators told him that he could be beaten to death at any time the authorities desired&quot; when the writer refused to swallow their trumped-up charges. &quot;Several interrogators&quot; including Liu Chan-hua and Kao Yi-rue &quot;played cat and mouse with him, alternating promise of immediate release with threats&quot; and torture. In order to make him confess, they broke his leg. Western allies of the regime were not unaware of this. Shelley Rigger says that &quot;Peng Ming-min, Bo Yang and Lei Chen&quot; were &quot;high-profile White Terror cases&quot; in the 1960s but in fact, many &quot; of Taiwanese and Mainlanders were swept up by the White Terror, suffering imprisonment, torture, (…) execution.&quot; The prosecutor initially sought the death sentence but due to US pressure this was reduced to twelve years in the Green Island concentration camp. From 1969 Bo Yang was incarcerated as a political prisoner (for &quot;being a Communist agent and attacking national leaders&quot;) on Green Island for nine years. The original 12-year sentence was commuted to eight years after the death of Chiang Kai-shek in 1975. However, the government refused to release Bo Yang after his sentence expired, and released him only in 1977, giving in to pressure from international organizations such as Amnesty International. After his release, Bo Yang continued to campaign for human rights and democracy in Taiwan. Towards the end of his life Bo Yang stated in his memoirs that he did not have the slightest intention to insult Chiang Kai-shek with his &quot;Popeye&quot; translation. This was due to the fact that in his view objective criticism mattered whereas personal insults were irrelevant.

=== Works ===
Lin Zi-yao notes that during his life &quot;Bo Yang covered a wide range of subjects from culture, literature, politics and education to love, marriage, family planning, fashion and women.&quot; Much of this is not fiction, although he also published a significant body of short stories, novels, and poetry. Howard Goldblatt says that &quot;it is significant&quot; that an anthology of his short stories entitled &quot;Secrets&quot; in English was &quot;published in Chinese under the author&#x27;s true name Kuo I-tung, for &#x27;Bo Yang&#x27; is not essentially a writer of fiction.&quot; Goldblatt adds, &quot;Yet like &#x27;Bo Yang&#x27; [the writer of essays], Kuo I-tung [the novelist and short story writer] is a social critic; his fiction is written with an eye to the recording of events and to the social inequities that gave rise to them.&quot;

Aside from his Golden Triangle novel Yiyu, (, 1961), Boyang is best known for his non-fiction works on Chinese history (collated and translated into modern colloquial Chinese from historical records in the prison library on Green Island) and &quot;The Ugly Chinaman&quot; ( &quot;Chǒulòu de Zhōngguórén&quot;, 1985; English translation, with the subtitle &quot;... and the Crisis of Chinese Culture&quot;, 1992). In the introduction to excerpts from &quot;The Ugly Chinaman&quot;, the editors of an anthology entitled &quot;Sources of Chinese Tradition from 1600 through the Twentieth Century&quot; state that &quot;(t)he sharply negative tone of the (…) essay reflects a sense of (…) despair (…) as well as a feeling that age-old weaknesses have persisted through revolutionary change.&quot; Also referring to &quot;The Ugly Chinaman&quot;, Rana Mitter says that Bo Yang&#x27;s position as a critical observer and analyst of the world is similar to Lu Xun&#x27;s. Both were skeptical, yet committed writers and less naive than younger &#x27;romanticists&#x27;. Edward M. Gunn agrees, saying that &quot;(t)he fact that Bo Yang is a prolific author of satirical essays (zawen) inevitably recalls the work of Lu Xun.&quot; Gunn also emphasizes Bo Yang&#x27;s &quot;particular interest in history&quot; and the &quot;acerbic wit in defense of democracy and social welfare&quot; (or social rights of the common people).
Bo Yang gained attention internationally when a volume of poetry entitled &quot;Poems of a Period&quot; was published in Hong Kong in 1986. These poems recall his arrest and imprisonment.

===Later years===
Bo Yang lived in Taipei in his later years. He became the founding president of the Taiwan chapter of Amnesty International. In 1994, Boyang underwent heart surgery, and his health never fully recovered. He carried the honorary title of national policy advisor to the administration of President Chen Shui-bian. In 2006, Boyang retired from writing, and donated the bulk of his manuscripts to the Chinese Modern Literature Museum in Beijing. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the National Tainan University, to which he also donated many memorabilia and some manuscripts.

Boyang died of pneumonia in a hospital near his Xindian residence on 29 April 2008. He was married five times, and is survived by his last wife, Chang Hsiang-hua, and five children born by his former wives. On 17 May 2008, his ashes were scattered along the seashore of Green Island, where he was once imprisoned.

<text>The Beijing Hotel () is a five-star state-owned hotel complex in the Dongcheng District of Beijing, China. It is located at the southern end of Wangfujing Street, at the corner with East Chang&#x27;an Avenue, 1.5 km from Beijing railway station with views of the Forbidden City and part of Tiananmen Square.

==Overview==
The first wing of the Grand Hôtel de Pékin, a five-story red brick structure, was completed in 1915. A second wing, today known as Block B, was completed in 1917, making the hotel one of the oldest in Beijing. In 1933 Zhang Jingyao was shot in the building by an assassin. Following the July 7 incident in 1937, the hotel was taken over by Japanese forces and later by the Kuomintang government. Later, the banquet hall served guests such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai at the inauguration of the People&#x27;s Republic.

A new wing was added on the west side of the 1917 wing of the Beijing Hotel in 1954, it is today known as Block C. The original red brick 1915 wing was demolished for the construction of Block D, on the east, in 1974. At 89 meters, the tower was the tallest building in Beijing at the time. Finally, Block E was built directly behind the 1917 wing in 2001.

The hotel complex today operates under three separate names. In April 2005, Raffles Hotels and Resorts Limited signed an agreement with the Beijing Tourism Group (BTG), to re-brand and manage the historic 1917 Block B in the middle and the modern Block E behind it under the Raffles brand. After carrying out renovations and refurbishment, that portion of the complex was re-launched as Raffles Beijing Hotel () in 2006. The contract ended in 2016 and those blocks were renamed Beijing Hotel NUO on December 1, 2016. Block C, on the left, is today the Grand Hotel Beijing. The towering Block D, on the right, is today the only remaining wing to use the name Beijing Hotel.

The hotel usually caters to foreigners and wealthy domestic guests, providing restaurants and bars in a Western and Asian style. Various members of state have stayed there, including Richard Nixon, U Nu, Nikita Khrushchev, Ho Chi Minh and Sun Yat-sen. The hotel has been awarded the Five Star Diamond Award for consecutive years. During the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2022 Winter Olympics, the hotel served as the headquarters of the International Olympic Committee.

==Significance==
Many foreign journalists were based in the hotel during the spring of 1989. This was the site where Associated Press photographer Jeff Widener took the famous &quot;Tank Man or Unknown Rebel&quot; picture during the Tiananmen Square protests. According to journalist Zhang Boli, the last meetings between the students and government took place at the hotel on May 30, 1989, where no agreement was reached.

<text>HD 49674 is a solar-type star with an exoplanetary companion in the northern constellation of Auriga. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 8.10 and thus is an eighth-magnitude star that is too faint to be readily visible to the naked eye. The system is located at a distance of 140.6 light-years from the Sun based on parallax, and is drifting further away with a radial velocity of +12 km/s.

HD 49674, and its planetary system, was chosen as part of the 2019 NameExoWorlds campaign organised by the International Astronomical Union, which assigned each country a star and planet to be named. HD 49674 was assigned to Belgium. The winning proposal named the star Nervia and the planet Eburonia, both after prominent Belgic tribes, the Nervii and Eburones, respectively.

This is an ordinary G-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of G3V, which indicates it is generating energy through hydrogen fusion at its core. Spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 4.7 km/s, it is younger than the Sun, roughly two billion years of age, and is a metal-rich star. HD 49674 has a similar mass and radius as the Sun. It is radiating 96% of the Sun&#x27;s luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of .

==Planetary system==
At the time of discovery of the planet HD 49674 b in 2002, it was the least massive planet known, very close to the boundary between sub-Jupiter mass and Neptune mass at 0.1 MJ. This planet orbits very close to the star, with a semimajor axis of .

<text>David Coffin is an American traditional folk musician specializing in early music and maritime music, based in Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States. He is the song leader for the Revels music programs in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He also presents music enrichment programs for schools throughout New England. One program is based on the history of the recorder, and the other is called &quot;Life at Sea: A Voyage in Song&quot;.

Coffin has a bass-baritone voice and plays various types of concertinas, recorders, and whistles, in addition to archaic instruments like the shawm, rackett, or gemshorn. He comes from a musical background: his father, Reverend William Sloane Coffin, studied to be a concert pianist with Nadia Boulanger in Paris, his grandfather was pianist Arthur Rubinstein, and his great-grandfather was Polish conductor Emil Młynarski.

He leads several sea shanties, including the title song, onscreen in the 2019 Maine-set film &quot;Blow the Man Down&quot;.

== Discography ==
In addition to contributing to a variety of collaborative CDs for Revels Records and North Star Records (both are local New England recording labels), Coffin has also recorded four solo albums: &quot;Flight of Time&quot;, &quot;Nantucket Sleighride&quot;, &quot;Safe in the Harbour&quot;, and &quot;Last Trip Home&quot; which he recorded with his daughter Linnea. All feature traditional and maritime music, some of which is taken from the singing of Ewan MacColl and Stan Rogers.

He is credited on four songs on the 2020 soundtrack album for &quot;Blow the Man Down&quot;.

<doc id="1216766" wikidata="Q365141" url="?curid=1216766" title="Philippe de Broca">
<text>Philippe Claude Alex de Broca de Ferrussac (; 15 March 1933 – 26 November 2004) was a French film director.

He directed 30 full-length feature films, including the highly successful &quot;That Man from Rio (&quot;L&#x27;Homme de Rio&quot;)&quot;, &quot;The Man from Acapulco (Le Magnifique)&quot; and &quot;On Guard (Le Bossu)&quot;. His works include historical, romantic epics such as &quot;Chouans!&quot; and &quot;King of Hearts (Le Roi de cœur)&quot;, as well as comedies with a charismatic, breezy hero ready to embark upon any adventure which comes his way, so long as it means escaping everyday modern life: &quot;Practice Makes Perfect (Le Cavaleur)&quot;, &quot;The Devil by the Tail (Le Diable par la queue)&quot;, &quot;The African (L&#x27;Africain)&quot;. He had links with the actor Jean-Paul Belmondo, with whom he made six films, as well as with Jean-Pierre Cassel, Philippe Noiret and Jean Rochefort.

== Biography ==
Philippe de Broca was born on 15 March 1933 in Paris. He was the son of a cinema set designer and the grandson of a well-known painter, Alexis de Broca. He studied at the Paris Photography and Cinematography School (école Vaugirard), graduating in 1953. He carried out his military service with the French Army&#x27;s &quot;service cinématographique des armées&quot; (army film service) in Germany and then in Algeria, directing or acting as head cameraman on short films. Greatly affected by the war he witnessed in Algeria, he vowed to show life in its best light in his future films &quot;because laughter is the best defence against upsets in life&quot;. After his discharge from the military, he set off on a journey taking in the length of Africa in Berliet trucks before returning to Paris.

He began working as an intern with Henri Decoin, before finding assistant positions with Claude Chabrol: &quot;Bitter Reunion (Le Beau Serge)&quot;, &quot;The Cousins (Les Cousins)&quot;, &quot;Web of Passion (À Double Tour)&quot;, François Truffaut: &quot;The 400 Blows (Les 400 Coups)&quot; and Pierre Schoendoerffer: &quot;Ramuntcho&quot;. In 1959, Claude Chabrol produced de Broca&#x27;s first film for him, &quot;The Love Game (Les jeux de l&#x27;amour)&quot; with Jean-Pierre Cassel. De Broca went on to work with Cassel again in &quot;The Joker&quot; (&quot;Le Farceur&quot;, 1960), &quot;Five Day Lover&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Amant de cinq jours&quot;, 1961), and &quot;Male Companion&quot; (&quot;Un Monsieur de Compagnie&quot;, 1964).

De Broca&#x27;s first commercial success came with &quot;Swords of Blood (Cartouche)&quot;, filmed in 1962. This film also saw two more names become associated with de Broca: the actor Jean-Paul Belmondo and the producer Alexandre Mnouchkine. International acclaim came with &quot;That Man from Rio (L&#x27;Homme de Rio)&quot; in 1964, &quot;Up to His Ears (Les tribulations d&#x27;un Chinois en Chine)&quot; in 1965, &quot;The Man from Acapulco (Le Magnifique)&quot; in 1973 and &quot;Incorrigible (L&#x27;Incorrigible)&quot; in 1975.

In 1966, he co-wrote, directed and produced &quot;King of Hearts (Le Roi de Cœur)&quot;. This parody of the Great War, which some cinema-lovers consider his masterpiece, was a commercial and personal failure, to de Broca&#x27;s dismay. Yet it eventually achieved genuine cult-film status during the mid 1970s when it was presented in repertory movie theaters as well as non-theatrical college and university film series across the United States, eventually running for five years at the now defunct film house, the Central Square Cinemas in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Next his career took a turn towards seemingly straightforward comedy and fun: &quot;The Devil by the Tail (Le Diable par la queue)&quot; featuring Yves Montand in 1969, then &quot;Dear Detective (Tendre Poulet)&quot; in 1978 and &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Thigh (On a volé la cuisse de Jupiter)&quot; in 1980 with Philippe Noiret and Annie Girardot, and finally &quot;Practice Makes Perfect (Le Cavaleur)&quot; in 1979 with Jean Rochefort.

In 1988, his film &quot;Chouans!&quot; with Sophie Marceau and Philippe Noiret, which questioned historical philosophies, was not as successful as expected.

He then directed ten or so telefilms, enjoying the speed of filming as well as the teamwork involved. De Broca found success again in 1997 with his adaptation of &quot;On Guard (Le Bossu)&quot; for Daniel Auteuil.

In 2004 Philippe de Broca filmed the adaptation of the novel &quot;Viper in the Fist (Vipère au poing)&quot; with Jacques Villeret and Catherine Frot. This movie was to be his last hit with the cinema-going public, although he was not able to enjoy the success, passing away from cancer on 26 November 2004.

Throughout his career, de Broca&#x27;s work alternates between two styles: large-scale productions like &quot;Swords of Blood (Cartouche)&quot;, &quot;King of Hearts (Le Roi de cœur)&quot; or &quot;On Guard (Le Bossu)&quot;, and lively, punchy contemporary adventure-comedies like &quot;That Man from Rio (L&#x27;Homme de Rio)&quot;, &quot;The Man from Acapulco (Le Magnifique)&quot; or &quot;Practice Makes Perfect (Le Cavaleur)&quot;. Yet even this dual classification is not easily applied to Philippe de Broca&#x27;s work, because the man himself hated conventions and enjoyed blurring the line between the real world and the imaginary. His films, which may at first glance seem lightweight, are being re-assessed by cinema-lovers as a thoughtful life&#x27;s work, which asks questions about society in the second half of the 20th century.

De Broca remained loyal to his actors throughout his films, as well as to the writers Daniel Boulanger and Michel Audiard, and enjoyed an exceptional musical affinity with Georges Delerue.

Today, Philippe de Broca is acknowledged by the younger generation of movie directors, such as Ryan Coogler, Antonio Negret or Emmanuel Issanchou, who frequently cite his work.

== Personal life ==

Philippe de Broca was married to Michelle de Broca, with whom he founded the production company Fildebroc. He has two daughters, Chloé and Jade, with Michelle; and one son Alexandre, with Marthe Keller.

For over 30 years he lived in the village of Vert in the Yvelines department to the west of Paris, where he greatly enjoyed tending his garden. He felt a strong connection with Brittany since his childhood, his painter grandfather having lived there, as well as being fond of his boat. He died of cancer, aged 71, and chose to be buried in Sauzon cemetery on Belle-Ile.

The majority of the music featured in Philippe de Broca&#x27;s films has been published in its own right. Below are a few notable compilations.
*In 2003, the label Universal Music Jazz issued two records called &quot;Le cinéma de Philippe de Broca – musiques de Georges Delerue&quot;. The first covers the period from 1959 to 1968, with the second covering 1969 to 1988. They feature the themes from seventeen of the director&#x27;s films, from &quot;Playing at Love (Les Jeux de l&#x27;amour)&quot; to &quot;Chouans&quot;.
*In 2007, the Canadian label Disques Cinémusique released &quot;Les Plus beaux Thèmes pour le Piano&quot;, a new recording compiling piano, flute and cello arrangements for several of Georges Delerue&#x27;s themes. The themes come from thirteen films, seven of which were directed by de Broca, to whom a special dedication is made. Details online.
*From 2011, the French label Music Box Records reissued two original motion picture soundtracks for de Broca films: &quot;Incorrigible (L&#x27;Incorrigible)&quot; (music by Georges Delerue) and &quot;The Gypsy (La Gitane)&quot; (music by Claude Bolling).

== Award ==

* 1960: Philippe de Broca received the Silver Bear Extraordinary Jury Prize at the Berlin Film Festival for &quot;Playing at Love (Les Jeux de l&#x27;amour)&quot;.

<doc id="1216767" wikidata="Q3281301" url="?curid=1216767" title="Plain English Campaign">
<text>The Plain English Campaign (PEC) is a commercial editing and training firm based in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1979 by Chrissie Maher, the company is concerned with plain English language advocacy, working to persuade organisations in the UK and abroad to communicate with the public in plain language. Maher was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1994 for her services to plain communication.

In 1990, PEC created the Crystal Mark, its seal of approval. This is a symbol printed on documents that it considers to be as clear as possible for the intended audience. The symbol appears on over 20,000 documents worldwide. They also give out the annual Foot in Mouth Award for &quot;a baffling comment by a public figure&quot; and the Golden Bull Award for &quot;the worst examples of written tripe&quot;. Notable winners of the Foot in Mouth Award include Donald Trump, George W. Bush, Gordon Brown, Richard Gere, and Donald Rumsfeld.

PEC has worked all over the world for companies and organisations including British Gas, British Telecom, Irish Life, Telefónica O2 and the World Bowls association. It has also worked with the majority of UK council and government departments. Many UK forms and bills carry the Crystal Mark, including the British passport application form.

PEC is often described in the media as a pressure group, and regularly makes public comments about language-related news stories, particularly jargon. In 2008 it criticised a consultation document sent to residents living near Heathrow Airport. The year before, it mocked signs put up by police in Hertfordshire that warned the public not to commit crime.

In 2006 its supporters voted Bill Shankly the author of the greatest footballing quotation of all time: “Some people believe football is a matter of life and death. I&#x27;m very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it is much, much more important than that.”. A 2004 survey revealed that &quot;At the end of the day&quot; was considered the most irritating cliché.

Famous supporters of PEC include Margaret Thatcher and broadcaster John Humphrys.

PEC has been criticised by writer Oliver Kamm, who wrote: &quot;The joke – not that it&#x27;s funny – is that a body ostensibly concerned with clarity of language is both incompetent in its own use of English and heedless of the task it sets itself.&quot;

A different point of view was given by Tom McArthur, editor of &quot;The Oxford Companion to the English Language&quot;, who said: &quot;In all the history of the language, there has never been such a powerful grassroots movement to influence it as Plain English Campaign.&quot;

In 2011 PEC criticised the Met Office for using the phrase &quot;probabilities of precipitation&quot; instead of &quot;rain is likely&quot;. The Met Office responded by explaining that precipitation does not mean only rain. A Met Office spokesman said: &quot;Precipitation covers a wide range of stuff falling from the sky including rain, sleet, snow, hail, drizzle, and even cats and dogs – but sums it up in just one word.&quot;

<doc id="1216770" wikidata="Q7794557" url="?curid=1216770" title="Thomas Tresham (speaker)">
<text>Sir Thomas Tresham (died 6 May 1471) was an English politician, soldier and administrator. He was the son of Sir William Tresham and his wife Isabel de Vaux, daughter of Sir William Vaux of Harrowden. Thomas&#x27;s early advancement was due to his father&#x27;s influence. In 1443 he and his father were appointed as stewards to the Duchy of Lancaster&#x27;s estates in Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire, and by 1446 Thomas was serving as an esquire for Henry VI, being made an usher of the king&#x27;s chamber in 1455. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Huntingdonshire in 1446, a position he held until 1459, and was returned to Parliament for Buckinghamshire in 1447 and Huntingdonshire in 1449. Despite the Tresham family&#x27;s close links with the royal court they were also on good terms with Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, and when he returned from Ireland in 1450 Tresham and his father went to greet him. Shortly after leaving home on 23 September they were attacked by a group of men involved in a property dispute with his father; William Tresham was killed, and Thomas was injured.

After recovering from his injuries he again began to take government appointments; he was High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire between 1451 and 1452, a justice of the peace between 1452 and 1460 for Northamptonshire and a Member of Parliament in 1453 for Northamptonshire. Tresham stayed in favour throughout the disturbances of 1456, and was again made High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire between 1457 and 1458, and for Sussex and Surrey between 1458 and 1459. He was returned to parliament in 1459 for Northamptonshire again, and the parliament, packed with anti-Yorkists, chose him to act as Speaker of the House of Commons. After the Parliament ended he was appointed to various anti-Yorkist commissions of Oyer and terminer, followed by an appointment as Comptroller of the Household in 1460.

He fought at the Battle of Northampton in 1460, but denied having been at the Battle of Wakefield, an odd thing for a Lancastrian. He joined up with Margaret of Anjou in January 1461 and fought at the Second Battle of St Albans, where he was knighted. He fought at the Battle of Towton and was captured; despite being one of the lords on whom Edward IV had placed a £100 bounty, he only suffered forfeiture. He secured a pardon in 1464 and again represented Northamptonshire in Parliament in 1467, but failed to regain his lands and possessions. As a result, he took part in the plots of John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, and was imprisoned in the Tower of London from 1468 until Henry VI regained the throne in 1470. He was rewarded for his services and loyalty with various grants, including that of Huntingdon Castle, to be held for seven years.

After the Battle of Barnet he fled to meet Margaret of Anjou but was captured and executed on 6 May 1471.

His children by Mary, daughter of William, Lord Zouche of Harringworth, included a son, John, who was born in 1462. John was restored to his father&#x27;s estates after the reversal of the attainder by Henry VII in 1485. John&#x27;s son was Sir Thomas Tresham (d.1559). A daughter, Isabella, was born in 1460 and married Sir Henry de Vere of Addington, thus establishing a long line of descendants.

== History ==
=== Māori history ===
The Māori name for the area from Panmure south-west towards the Manukau Harbour area was Tauoma. Te Tō Waka and Karetu, two of the traditional portages between the Waitematā Harbour and the Manukau Harbour were near here. 4.6 km up the Tāmaki River Māori would beach their waka (canoes) at the end of a small creek (that now passes under the southern motorway) and drag them overland (where Portage Road is now) to the Manukau Harbour.

In the mid to late 18th century, land along the Western shores of the Tāmaki River were given as a &quot;tuku&quot; (strategic gift) by Te Tahuri, daughter of Te Horetā of the Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei hapū Ngā Oho, to the Hauraki Gulf iwi Ngāti Pāoa. Te Tahuri&#x27;s sister Te Kehu had been married to Te Putu, an important figure within Ngāti Pāoa, for which Te Tahuri was derided and called foolish by people concerned by what the outcomes of such a &quot;tuku&quot; would cause. Ngāti Pāoa leader Tangi-te-ruru built Mauināina pā (also known as Maunga-inaina and Taumata-inaina) at the headland between the Panmure Basin and Tāmaki River, and along the Tāmaki River was an extensive kāinga (unfortified village) called Mokoia. In the late 18th century, war broke out between Ngāti Whātua and Ngāti Pāoa after a joint shark hunting trip, and both Te Tahuri and her husband Tomoaure were killed in the resulting skirmishes, with hostilities ending around the year 1793. By the time missionaries Samuel Marsden and John Gare Butler visited the isthmus in 1820, there were thousands of inhabitants living along the shores of the Tāmaki River at Mokoia.

During the Musket Wars in late September 1821, Mokoia and Mauināina pā were attacked by a Ngāpuhi taua led by Hongi Hika, Pōmare I (Ngati Manu) and Tuhi (Te Ngare Raumati of Pāroa), during a time when the Tāmaki isthmus was relatively unprotected, as many Ngāti Whātua warriors were touring the lower North Island on the Āmiowhenua war party expedition. Defenders of the pā placed stakes into the landing areas to slow the Ngāpuhi taua&#x27;s progress, and over the course of two days, the taua was pelted with stones. When the pā was under siege, the taua found that the muskets were ineffective due to the defenders sheltering behind an earthen wall, so built a platform which overlooked the pā, and shot at those who were inside. The fighting devastated what had been the Ngāti Pāoa population centre of the Auckland isthmus during pre-European times which had a population of about 7,000. Three thousand men with up to 100 muskets took part in the defense of the pā but after a close and bitter battle were defeated by the combined northern alliance who had between 500 and 1000 muskets. Mokoia and Mauināina pā were destroyed, and the land became tapu for Ngāti Pāoa due to the large number of deaths, and was not resettled.

=== European history ===

In 1841, the Government bought the Kohimaramara block from Ngāti Pāoa. In January 1842 Felton Mathew surveyed &quot;Tehmaki&quot; (sic.) into 37 farms totalling 3,856 acres. Part of this became the Fencible settlement of Panmure, between Maungarei and the Tāmaki River. In 1848, 80 Fencible families came here from Ireland and England on the ship Clifton and established a settlement with 99 raupo huts on the eastern shores of the lagoon. They called the area Maggotty Hollow. Located on the Tāmaki River, Panmure was favoured by Felton Mathew to be the new capital of New Zealand. William Hobson, however, decided otherwise, and the new town of Auckland arose further to the west along the shores of the Waitematā Harbour.

Panmure was then instead created as a fencible settlement, where retired soldiers were contracted to defend the settlement in return for land. The soldiers had to give 12 days military service per year and parade on Sunday in full military equipment. The only time they were called to arms was in 1851 when a flotilla of 20 waka took about 350 warriors to Mechanics Bay to attack Auckland. The Panmure fencibles were issued ammunition to defend the Tamaki River and stop any armed Maori attack. Only the Onehunga fencibles were marched to the hill overlooking Mechanics Bay to join a British line regiment. In the 1863 attack on Auckland the government used mainly professional soldiers instead.

Panmure was an important town and port as it was strategically placed near the narrowest part of the isthmus, and during the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s it became a very busy place. In 1865 the Panmure Bridge opened, connecting the Auckland isthmus to eastern Auckland farmland and the fencible settlement at Howick. Even after the railway reached Auckland in 1908, Panmure somewhat continued as a transport hub – steamers from Auckland en route to the goldfields in the Coromandel and Firth of Thames would call in here. Panmure prospered partly due to being on the route between Auckland and the much larger fencibles settlement of Howick in the 1800s. People and goods used the ferry at the narrow point below Mokoia Pa.

Until about the middle of the 20th century, Panmure remained a prosperous but mostly pastoral setting, the smallest borough of Auckland, and described as &quot;a quarter of a square mile of farmlets surrounding a sleepy village that boasted little more than a church, post office, a handful of shops, and a two-storey hotel that was widely known from horse and buggy days&quot;. Panmure Township merged with Mount Wellington Borough in 1955.

It was only with the explosive growth of suburbia around it after World War II, and better bridges to Pakuranga that Panmure relatively suddenly started to grow significantly, and become a commercial centre.

== Recent developments ==
Work was completed on the Panmure section (Stage 1) of the Auckland Transport project called AMETI (Auckland-Manukau Eastern Transport Initiative) which aims to improve the connections of eastern Auckland towards the south-east (Manukau central). As part of this, Panmure railway station underwent a major upgrade, increasing capacity and frequency of trains into the city (now a 17-minute travel time to Britomart station). The new Te Horeta Rd, the last major milestone, opened on 2 November 2015. Other related upgrades included the building of three new bridges, new cycle paths and foot paths.

Stage 2 of AMETI will see the completion of the 7 km Eastern Busway which will link Panmure railway station with Pakuranga and Botany. This is expected to cut public transport journey times significantly and relieve congestion on roads. The busway is expected to attract 5.5 million passengers a year. The Panmure Roundabout will become an intersection, a change that will see new investment in the redevelopment of the land adjacent to and north of the rail station.

The Tamaki Transformation Programme was announced in early 2012 by Housing Minister Phil Heatley. This will be the country&#x27;s first urban regeneration programme. Heatley said that east Auckland was chosen because it was an area with &quot;significant potential&quot;. &quot;It is close to the Auckland and Manukau central business districts. It has a young population, a sense of history and community, green spaces and near-coastal location&quot;. Following this announcement, Auckland Council and the New Zealand government formed the Tamaki Redevelopment Company to deliver the Tamaki Transformation Programme with the aim of creating a &quot;thriving, attractive, sustainable and self-reliant community through a series of interlinking and economic, social, urban space and housing projects&quot;. Substantial Central and Local Government partnership investment into the Tamaki Regeneration Programme will see change over the next 25 years, aiming to improve the overall quality of life to the residents of Tamaki with an expected doubling of the population in this area.

<text>Lionel Tyrone Willingham (born December 30, 1953) is a former American football player and coach. He was the head coach at Stanford University (1995–2001), the University of Notre Dame (2002–2004), and the University of Washington (2005–2008), compiling a career college football record of 76–88–1.

==Early career==
Willingham attended Jacksonville Senior High School in Jacksonville, North Carolina and lettered in football, basketball, and baseball. He went on to Michigan State University, where he played football and baseball and graduated in 1977 with a degree in physical education. Willingham held assistant coaching positions at his alma mater (1977, 1980–82), Central Michigan University (1978–79), North Carolina State University (1983–85), Rice University (1986–88), and Stanford University (1989–91). When Stanford head coach Dennis Green was hired as the Minnesota Vikings head coach in 1992, Willingham followed him as running backs coach (1992–94).

==Head coaching positions==
===Stanford===
Following the 1994 season, despite having never been more than a position coach at any level, Willingham returned to Stanford as head coach, succeeding Bill Walsh. In his seven seasons (1995–2001) as coach, he led the Cardinal to a 44–36–1 record and four bowl game appearances. Notably, Willingham&#x27;s teams went undefeated (7–0) against arch-rival California. In 2000, he was presented with the Eddie Robinson Coach of Distinction Award that is given annually to honor &quot;an outstanding college football coach and role model for career achievement&quot;.

His best team was the 1999 team, which won the school&#x27;s first outright Pacific-10 Conference title in 29 years and appeared in the 2000 Rose Bowl. Willingham&#x27;s 44 wins were the most by a Stanford coach since John Ralston, who left the school for the Denver Broncos of the NFL after the 1971 season.

===Notre Dame===
====2002====
On December 31, 2001, Willingham was hired as head coach at Notre Dame. Willingham began the 2002 season by going 8–0, and went on to become the only first-year coach in Notre Dame history to win 10 games. For his efforts, he was named the ESPN/Home Depot College Coach of the Year, the Scripps College Coach of the Year, the Black Coaches Association Male Coach of the Year, and the George Munger Award College Coach of the Year by the Maxwell Football Club.

In the 2002 regular-season finale, ND was blown out by arch-rival USC, 44–13, and was outgained 610–109—the worst such margin in school history. That loss knocked ND from a likely Bowl Championship Series berth down to the 2003 Gator Bowl—where they were beaten by North Carolina State, 28–6.

====2003====
The 2003 team finished 5–7 and was beaten badly in four of those losses, getting shut out twice in one season for the first time since 1960, including a 37–0 loss to Florida State and finishing with a point differential of 243–315—the worst of any Fighting Irish team since the 2–8 team of 1956.

====2004====
In 2004, Notre Dame posted a 6–5 record in the regular season, including a 41–16 loss to Purdue (the second-worst home loss ever to Purdue) and ending with Willingham&#x27;s third consecutive loss to USC for his fifth loss by 30 points or more, and eighth by 22 points or more, in his three seasons. The following Tuesday, November 30, after an overall record in South Bend of 21–15 (an 8–0 start followed by a 13-15 finish), Notre Dame terminated Willingham as head coach. Defensive coordinator Kent Baer served as acting head coach for the Insight Bowl, a 38–21 loss to Oregon State.

===Washington===
On December 13, 2004, Willingham was hired as the new head coach at Washington, succeeding Keith Gilbertson. The Huskies returned 19 of 22 starters from the previous season, in which they had gone 1–10 (0–8 in conference play).

Willingham&#x27;s primary task was to change the program&#x27;s image, which had been marred by off-the-field legal problems under Rick Neuheisel. He instituted a strict hair policy and was known to occasionally show up in his players&#x27; classes unannounced to make sure they were attending.

====2005====
As chance would have it, Willingham found himself facing his former team on September 24, 2005. Notre Dame prevailed, 36–17. His first season at Washington ended with a 2–9 record (1–7 in conference play, tied for 9th place), capped by a scuffle after a close loss to Washington State.

====2006====
His 2006 Washington team started October with a 4–1 record, with its most notable victory a stunning 29–19 upset over previously undefeated UCLA, before losing its next 6 games after starting quarterback Isaiah Stanback suffered a season-ending foot injury in a loss to Oregon State in their sixth game. The Huskies ended the season at 5–7 (3–6 in conference play, 9th place), this time defeating state rival Washington State (WSU) by three points. This win held WSU from defeating the Huskies for three consecutive seasons years, something that has never happened in the history of the century-long rivalry.

====2007====
The 2007 Washington Huskies football team faced what a preseason CBS Sports opinion piece called &quot;the toughest schedule in the country&quot; Washington went on to a 4–9 record overall (2–7 in conference play, 10th place) with wins against Syracuse, Boise State, Stanford, and California. There was considerable debate after the season over whether Willingham should be fired as no other coach in the history of the program had ever tallied three straight losing seasons. Washington State won the Apple Cup again, making it three out of the last four. In the end, it was decided that he would return for the upcoming season with the expectation that the team become more competitive. Additionally, several boosters were pleased at Willingham&#x27;s effort to clean up the program.

====2008====
Willingham&#x27;s stiff demeanor resulted in a somewhat acrimonious relationship with fans, boosters, and the Seattle media. The turning point came at the end of his third (losing) season when there was a big question as to whether he would be retained. However, President Emmert gave him a vote of confidence and he was retained for a fourth year.

The 2008 season started off inauspiciously with #21 Oregon defeating Washington 44–10. This marked the first time Oregon had ever beaten Washington five consecutive times in the history of the century-long rivalry. The second game against #15 BYU was a nail biter and Washington scored the final touchdown in the final minute. The PAT would have tied the game, however an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty was called against quarterback Jake Locker who had thrown the ball up in the air in celebration after scoring the touchdown. This moved the PAT attempt to 35 yards which was blocked and the BYU escaped with a 28–27 victory. In the next game, the Huskies were dismantled 55–14 by the #3 Oklahoma Sooners, giving the overmatched Huskies their greatest margin of defeat at home since 1929. In the fourth game, the Huskies lost to Stanford leaving them as the only winless team in a BCS conference. The Huskies were without a sack, leaving them as the only school without a sack at this point of the season. It was the second 0–4 start in the last five years and only the fourth time ever in the history of the program. Starting quarterback Jake Locker was lost for the season, injuring his left hand during a block on a reverse.

In the fifth game, Arizona put Washington away early and the game ended with a 48–14 wipeout of the Huskies. This was the biggest margin of victory by Arizona over Washington ever, and started a watch of just how bad the team could get. The Huskies had a flat performance in their sixth game to lose to Oregon State 34–13. This was the fifth consecutive loss to the Beavers, something that had never happened in the long history of the series. Game 7 was another loss versus his former team Notre Dame. The Huskies were nearly shutout in suffering a 33–7 loss that left them 0–7 and ineligible for a bowl game yet again. On October 27, 2008, seven games into the 2008 season, Willingham announced that his contract was being terminated and he would be leaving UW after the regular season. Game 8 was a shutout by USC.

At 0–11, Washington was the only winless team in the FBS, and the owner of a 13-game losing streak stretching from the last season. Washington closed out the season with a loss at 1–10 Washington State in double-overtime, making it four of the last five, and with a season-ending loss at California. Willingham finished the season with an 0–12 record, the Huskies&#x27; first winless season in 119 years, as well as the only winless season in the PAC-10, PAC-12 era.

==Post coaching career==
In 2014, Willingham was named as a member of the College Football Playoff selection committee. Willingham also volunteered as a coach on the Stanford women&#x27;s golf team in 2011. Willingham served as president on the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) Board of Trustees in 2008. On July 18, 2010, at the age of 56 and nearly two years after he had coached his last game, Willingham announced he was retired from coaching.

==Personal life==
Willingham is married and has three children.

<text>HD 117618, named Dofida by the IAU, is a single, yellow-hued star in the southern constellation of Centaurus. With an apparent visual magnitude of 7.17, it is too faint to be visible to the naked eyes of a typical observer. The distance to this star, as determined from its annual parallax shift of as seen from Earth&#x27;s orbit, is about 124 light years. It is moving further away with a heliocentric radial velocity of around +1.6 km/s.

This star is similar to the Sun, being a G-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of G0 V. It is about 10% more massive and 17% larger than the Sun, with an estimated age of roughly four billion years and a projected rotational velocity of 3.67 km/s. The star is radiating 1.6 times the Sun&#x27;s luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,019 K.

==Name==

HD 117618, and its planet HD 117618b, were chosen as part of the 2019 NameExoWorlds campaign organised by the International Astronomical Union, which assigned each country a star and planet to be named. HD 117618 was assigned to Indonesia. The winning proposal named the star &quot;Dofida&quot; meaning &quot;our star&quot; in Nias language, and its planet &quot;Noifasui&quot; meaning &quot;revolve around&quot; in Nias language (derived from the word &quot;ifasui&quot;, meaning &quot;to revolve around&quot;, and &quot;no&quot;, indicating that the action occurred in the past and continued to the present time).

==Planetary system==

In 2005, the Anglo-Australian Planet Search program announced the discovery of a low-mass planet in orbit around HD 117618. This object was found through measurements of radial velocity variation, which were larger than those produced by the intrinsic jitter of the host star. The best Keplerian fit to the data gave a periodicity of 25.8 days with an eccentricity of around 0.37 and a semimajor axis of . The lower bound on the object&#x27;s mass was estimated to be . These values were subsequently refined, as shown in the table below.

<doc id="1216778" wikidata="Q553870" url="?curid=1216778" title="Ernest Nagel">
<text>Ernest Nagel (November 16, 1901 – September 20, 1985) was an American philosopher of science. Along with Rudolf Carnap, Hans Reichenbach, and Carl Hempel, he is sometimes seen as one of the major figures of the logical positivist movement. His 1961 book &quot;The Structure of Science&quot; is considered a foundational work in the logic of scientific explanation.

==Life and career==
Nagel was born in Nové Mesto nad Váhom (now in Slovakia, then Vágújhely and part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) to Jewish parents. His mother, Frida Weiss, was from the nearby town of Vrbové (or Verbo).

He emigrated to the United States at the age of 10 and became a U.S. citizen in 1919. He received a BSc from the City College of New York in 1923, and earned his PhD from Columbia University in 1931, with a dissertation on the concept of measurement.

Through the award of a Guggeheim Fellowship he was able to spend a year in Europe (from August 1934 to July 1935) to learn about the new trends in philosophy on the continent.

Except for one year (1966-1967) at Rockefeller University, Nagel spent his entire academic career at Columbia. He became the first John Dewey Professor of Philosophy there in 1955. And then University Professor from 1967 until his retirement in 1970, after which he continued to teach. In 1977, he was one of the few philosophers elected to the National Academy of Sciences.

His work concerned the philosophy of mathematical fields such as geometry and probability, quantum mechanics, and the status of reductive and inductive theories of science. His book &quot;The Structure of Science&quot; (1961) practically inaugurated the field of analytic philosophy of science. He expounded the different kinds of explanation in different fields, and was sceptical about attempts to unify the nature of scientific laws or explanations. He was the first to propose that by positing analytic equivalencies (or &quot;bridge laws&quot;) between the terms of different sciences, one could eliminate all ontological commitments except those required by the most basic science. He also upheld the view that social sciences are scientific, and should adopt the same standards as natural sciences.

Nagel wrote &quot;An Introduction to Logic and the Scientific Method&quot; with Morris Raphael Cohen, his CCNY teacher in 1934. In 1958, he published with James R. Newman &quot;Gödel&#x27;s proof&quot;, a short book explicating Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems to those not well trained in mathematical logic. He edited the &quot;Journal of Philosophy&quot; (1939–1956) and the &quot;Journal of Symbolic Logic&quot; (1940-1946).

As a public intellectual, he supported a skeptical approach to claims of the paranormal, becoming one of the first sponsors and fellows of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry in 1976, along with 24 other notable philosophers like W. V. Quine. The committee posthumously inducted him into their &quot;Pantheon of Skeptics&quot; in recognition of Nagel&#x27;s contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism. Nagel was an atheist.

Nagel was an elected member of the American Philosophical Society (1962) and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1981).

He died in New York. He had two sons, Alexander Nagel (professor of mathematics at the University of Wisconsin) and Sidney Nagel (professor of physics at the University of Chicago).

Nagel&#x27;s doctoral students include Morton White, Patrick Suppes, Henry Kyburg, Isaac Levi, and Kenneth Schaffner.

A festschrift, &quot;,&quot; was published in 1969.

<text>Geranic acid, or 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienoic acid, is a pheromone used by some organisms. It is a double bond isomer of nerolic acid.

==Pharmacology==
Choline geranate (also described as Choline And Geranic acid, or CAGE) has been developed as a novel biocompatible antiseptic material capable of penetrating skin and aiding the transdermal delivery of co-administered antibiotics.

The antibacterial properties of CAGE were analyzed against 24 and 72 hour old biofilms of 11 clinically isolated ESKAPE pathogens (defined as Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter sp, respectively), including multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates. 

CAGE was observed to eradicate in vitro biofilms at concentrations as low as 3.56 mM (0.156% v:v) in as little as 2 hours, which represents both an improved potency and rate of biofilm eradication relative to that reported for most common standard-of-care topical antiseptics in current use. In vitro time-kill studies on 24 hour old Staphylococcus aureus biofilms indicate that CAGE exerts its antibacterial effect upon contact and a 0.1% v:v solution reduced biofilm viability by over three orders of magnitude (a 3log10 reduction) in 15 minutes. 

Furthermore, disruption of the protective layer of exopolymeric substances in mature biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus by CAGE (0.1% v:v) was observed in 120 minutes. Insight into the mechanism of action of CAGE was provided with molecular modeling studies alongside in vitro antibiofilm assays. The geranate ion and geranic acid components of CAGE are predicted to act in concert to integrate into bacterial membranes, affect membrane thinning and perturb membrane homeostasis.

<text>HD 102117 or Uklun is a star in the southern constellation of Centaurus. With an apparent visual magnitude of 7.47, it is too dim to be seen without binoculars or a small telescope. It is located at a distance of approximately 129 light years from the Sun based on parallax. HD 102117 is drifting further away with a radial velocity of +50 km/s, having come to within some 692,000 years ago. It has one known planet.

The stellar classification of HD 102117 is G6V, which matches the spectrum of an ordinary G-type main-sequence star. It is roughly five billion years old and is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 0.9 km/s. The star shows only a low level of chromospheric activity and is photometrically stable, meaning it doesn&#x27;t vary significantly in brightness. It appears metal-enriched, showing a higher abundance of heavy elements compared to the Sun.

==Planetary system==
In 2004, the Anglo-Australian Planet Search announced a planet orbiting the star. A short time later the HARPS team also announced the presence of a planet around this star. Both groups detected this planet with the radial velocity method.

HD 102117, and its planet HD 102117b, were chosen as part of the 2019 NameExoWorlds campaign organised by the International Astronomical Union, which assigned each country a star and planet to be named. HD 102117 was assigned to Pitcairn Islands. The winning proposal named the star Uklun, from the word &quot;aklan&quot; &#x27;we/us&#x27; in the Pitcairn language, and the planet Leklsullun , from the phrase &quot;lekl salan&quot; &#x27;child/children&#x27; (lit. &#x27;little person&#x27;).

<doc id="1216788" wikidata="Q7759233" url="?curid=1216788" title="The Radio One Sessions (Cowboy Junkies album)">
<text>The Radio One Sessions is a 2002 album by the Canadian alt-country band Cowboy Junkies. The compilation album was released only in Canada and the United Kingdom, and compiles tracks that the band recorded for BBC Radio One in the UK. &quot;The Radio One Sessions&quot; was released on Strange Fruit Records in the UK, and Latent Recordings in Canada.

== BBC sessions ==
The Cowboy Junkies promoted their music when touring by performing radio sessions, like most other bands. They have performed sessions by squeezing three or four bodies in DJ booths that are designed for one person, and in state of the art recording studios where there is room for several band members. Radio One is BBC&#x27;s premier station for contemporary pop music, and has been hosting sessions with almost every touring band for over 40 years, setting the standard for radio sessions, hosting the like of the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Cream, Captain Beefheart, and others. The Cowboy Junkies were invited to perform at Radio One on various tours when they were in the UK. Each visit to the recording studio had a different line-up of players. For their first session in 1989, only Michael and Margo Timmins from the Junkies, plus two members of their touring band, Jeff Bird and Jano Czerwinec performed, for the 1992 session, Michael, Margo, and Jeff Bird performed, and for the 1996 session, only the core members of the Cowboy Junkies were present.

<doc id="1216791" wikidata="Q352733" url="?curid=1216791" title="Randy Couture">
<text>Randall Duane Couture (; born June 22, 1963) is an American mixed martial arts commentator, actor, former United States Army sergeant, former professional mixed martial artist, and former collegiate and Greco-Roman wrestler. During his tenures in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), he became a three-time UFC Heavyweight Champion, two-time UFC Light Heavyweight Champion, an interim UFC Light Heavyweight Champion, making him a six-time UFC Champion and the UFC 13 Heavyweight Tournament winner. He is the first of nine fighters to hold two UFC championship titles in two different divisions. He currently serves as a commentator and analyst for the Professional Fighters League.

Couture has competed in a record 16 title fights. He is tied for the record for the most wins in UFC Heavyweight Championship bouts (6) with former UFC Heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic. He had the most title reigns in the UFC, with six. His last fight with Lyoto Machida marked his 24th fight in the UFC. He is the fourth member of the UFC Hall of Fame. He is one of only 2 over the age of 40 to have won a UFC championship fight, having done so four times. He is one of the few MMA champions to regain a title he had lost, and the only to have done it three times (twice at heavyweight, once at light heavyweight).

Couture was an Olympic wrestling alternate and has lived in Corvallis, Oregon throughout much of his career, where he served as an assistant wrestling coach and a strength and conditioning coach for Oregon State University. He established Team Quest with Matt Lindland and Dan Henderson, a training camp for fighters, based out of Gresham, Oregon, and headed by coach Robert Folis. In 2005, he moved to Las Vegas, where he opened his own extensive chain of gyms under the name Xtreme Couture. He partnered with Bas Rutten to open Legends Gym in Hollywood, California.

Couture is generally recognized as a clinch and ground-and-pound fighter who uses his wrestling ability to execute take downs, establish top position and successively strike the opponent on the bottom. He has displayed a variety of skills in boxing and catch wrestling. He is the only UFC fighter to win a championship after becoming a Hall-of-Famer and is the oldest champion in MMA history with his title victory over Tim Sylvia at age 43.

==Background==
Couture was born in Everett, Washington, the son of Sharan Amelia (née King) and Edward Lewis &quot;Ed&quot; Couture. He wrestled at Lynnwood High School in Lynnwood, Washington, where he won a state championship during his senior year in wrestling. Afterwards he served in the U.S. Army from 1982 to 1988, attaining the rank of Sergeant in the 101st Airborne, where he &quot;wrestled and did a little boxing.&quot;

While he was in the Army he applied for tryouts with the U.S. Army freestyle wrestling team; however, due to a clerical error his application was sent to the Greco-Roman wrestling tryouts and rather than wait until the next year he decided to pursue it. Despite never having competed in Greco-Roman he made the team.

Upon discharge, Couture became a three-time Olympic team alternate (1988, 1992 and 1996), a semifinalist at the 2000 Olympic Trials, a three-time NCAA Division I All-American and a two-time NCAA Division I runner-up (1991 and 1992) at Oklahoma State University. In 1992, he was the Division I runner-up at , coming in second after Mark Kerr. From 1989 to 1992 he accumulated a collegiate wrestling record of 113-42. He graduated from Oklahoma State University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in literature.

==Mixed martial arts career==
===Ultimate Fighting Championship and RINGS===
Being called to the tournament as an alternate on three weeks&#x27; notice, Couture made his professional mixed martial arts debut at UFC 13 on May 30, 1997, as part of a four-man heavyweight tournament. His first opponent was Tony Halme, who outweighed him by nearly . Couture immediately hit a double-leg takedown and, after some ground and pound, moved to back mount and secured a rear naked choke submission to win in under a minute. In the tournament final, he defeated Steven Graham, another larger opponent (290 lb), by TKO at 3:13 into the first round.

On October 17, 1997, at UFC 15, Couture fought Vitor Belfort to determine the number one contender for the UFC Heavyweight Championship. Couture was an underdog, as 19-year-old Belfort was the UFC 12 Heavyweight Tournament Champion, winning all of his matches with devastating punches. After circling away from Belfort&#x27;s left hand, Couture got the clinch. The fighters broke up and, when Belfort attempted a flurry of punches, Couture hit a takedown. He immediately gained side control and landed strikes. As Belfort scrambled to his feet, Couture landed knee strikes. He clinched again and wore Belfort down with dirty boxing. By the 7-minute mark, Belfort was exhausted. Couture again took him down, and finished him with punches from back mount, for one of the biggest upsets in MMA at the time.

At UFC Japan on December 21, Couture challenged the UFC Heavyweight Champion, Maurice Smith to his second title defense since winning the belt from Mark Coleman earlier that year. It was a slow-paced fight, and neither fighter significantly damaged the other, but Couture hit several takedowns and held positional control throughout the fight. After 21 minutes, he won a majority decision and became the new UFC Heavyweight Champion. Though this win was controversial as many believe Smith did enough to win the fight.

In 1998, UFC matchmakers wanted Couture to defend the belt against Bas Rutten, former King of Pancrase. Couture instead signed with Vale Tudo Japan, and was stripped of the title. He had his first and only match against Shooto veteran and grappling specialist Enson Inoue. After taking the fight to the ground, Couture tapped out to an armbar, just over 90 seconds into the bout.

Still in Japan, Couture was signed up with Fighting Network RINGS, debuting against Mikhail Illoukhine on March 20, 1999, in RINGS. Couture submitted to a kimura, though the loss was controversial due to Illoukhine locking the hold while they were being re-positioned on the center of the ring. After that loss, he took a break from MMA to focus on his amateur wrestling career.

Couture returned to MMA in October 2000, for the RINGS King of Kings Tournament 2000. He won a unanimous decision over UFC veteran Jeremy Horn in his first fight, and then another over Pancrase veteran Ryūshi Yanagisawa. These two wins qualified him for the final event of the tournament, in March 2001. Before that, he was offered a shot at the UFC Heavyweight Championship against Kevin Randleman on November 17, 2000. He was taken down in the first two rounds, but defended well from his back, negating most of Randleman&#x27;s ground and pound attempts. In the third round, he tripped Randleman to the mat and landed several strikes from full mount for a TKO victory and his second UFC Heavyweight Championship.

In March 2001, Couture continued in the RINGS King of Kings Tournament 2000 Final. After winning an even decision over veteran Tsuyoshi Kohsaka in the first fight, he got caught in a guillotine choke by Valentijn Overeem after committing himself in a takedown and had to submit. Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira won the tournament, and Couture returned to the UFC.

His first title defense was against Brazilian kickboxer Pedro Rizzo, at UFC 31. This was the first UFC event under Zuffa management, with Dana White as the new president. Both fighters inflicted substantial damage. After five 5-minute rounds, Couture won a close unanimous decision. Some fans felt Rizzo had won, so the UFC set up an immediate rematch for UFC 34, in November 2001. This time, Couture won decisively by TKO in the third round.

His third title defense was in March 2002, against up-and-comer Josh Barnett. In the second round, Barnett mounted Couture and landed several strikes to win the title by TKO. After the fight, it was revealed Barnett had tested positive for anabolic steroids. He was subsequently stripped of the title and cut from the UFC.

Couture then faced Ricco Rodriguez for the vacant UFC Heavyweight Championship at UFC 39, in late 2002. After dominating the first three rounds, 39-year-old Couture became noticeably fatigued. In the fifth round, Rodriguez took him down and landed an elbow strike to his orbital bone, breaking it and making him submit. This was the first time a UFC fight had finished in the fifth round.

====Move to light heavyweight and trilogy with Chuck Liddell====

After two consecutive losses to larger opponents in the heavyweight division, Couture moved down to the light heavyweight division. In his light heavyweight debut, he fought long-time number one contender Chuck Liddell for the UFC Interim Light heavyweight Championship. He was again the underdog but, after outstriking Liddell for three rounds, took the fight to the ground and won by TKO via strikes from full mount, becoming the first UFC fighter to win titles in two weight classes.

His next match, against five-time defending champion Tito Ortiz, was billed as a &quot;Champion vs. Champion&quot; fight. 40-year-old Couture won a unanimous decision to become the undisputed UFC Light heavyweight Champion.

Couture&#x27;s first title defense was against Vitor Belfort, whom he had previously defeated in 1997 at UFC 15. In the first round, as Couture closed the distance to attempt a clinch, Belfort grazed his right eye with a left hook. His glove opened a cut, and Belfort was declared the winner when the cageside doctor advised the fight be stopped. A rubber match took place later that year. Couture dominated all three rounds before winning by doctor stoppage due to a cut, and became a two-time UFC Light heavyweight Champion.

On April 16, 2005, in a rematch with Liddell, Couture lost his title and suffered the first knockout loss of his career. He came back in August to defeat Mike van Arsdale and reestablish himself as a top contender. He faced Liddell for the third and final time in a championship match at UFC 57, on February 4, 2006. He was knocked out in the second round and, immediately afterwards, announced his retirement from MMA.
On June 24, 2006, on The Ultimate Fighter 3 Finale, Couture became the fourth inductee to the UFC Hall of Fame, joining Royce Gracie, Dan Severn, and Ken Shamrock.

====Retirement====
After retiring from MMA, Couture became a regular broadcast commentator for UFC events and co-host of &quot;Before the Bell&quot; and &quot;After the Bell&quot; on The Fight Network. He appeared in the Rob Schneider movie &quot;Big Stan&quot;, with fellow mixed martial artists Don Frye and Bob Sapp.

On November 17, 2006, Couture fought and drew with Brazilian jiu-jitsu champion Ronaldo &quot;Jacare&quot; Souza in a submission wrestling contest. After the match Couture invited Souza to train at his gym. Souza accepted and started training at Xtreme Couture in Las Vegas.

Couture was featured in the season two premiere episode of the Spike TV show &quot;Pros vs. Joes&quot;, which aired January 25, 2007. His teammates on the episode were Michael Irvin, Kevin Willis, and José Canseco. He returned for the finale, where he took part in a football-based round. His teammates were Willis, Randall Cunningham, Bruce Smith, Roy Jones Jr., and Tim Hardaway.

====Reclaiming the Heavyweight Championship====

On January 11, 2007, Couture announced his return from retirement in an interview on the Spike TV magazine show, &quot;Inside the UFC&quot;. In a conversation with Joe Rogan, he confirmed he would face Tim Sylvia for the UFC Heavyweight Championship at UFC 68, on March 3, 2007. He also announced he had signed a four-fight, two-year deal with the UFC.

At the age of 43, Couture defeated Sylvia by unanimous decision to become UFC Heavyweight Champion for a third time (a UFC record). Couture&#x27;s first punch, eight seconds into the fight, sent the (2.03 m) Sylvia to the mat. He controlled the pace of the fight for five rounds, smothering Sylvia with strikes and numerous takedowns. All three judges scored the bout 50–45 for Couture.

At UFC 74 on August 25, 2007, Couture successfully defended the title against Brazilian Gabriel Gonzaga, defeating him via TKO by strikes. This fight earned him a &quot;Fight of the Night&quot; award. Couture suffered a broken left arm when he blocked one of Gonzaga&#x27;s kicks. The kick cleanly split his ulna, requiring him to wear a splint for six weeks.

====Resignation and dispute with the UFC====
On October 11, 2007, Couture announced he was severing all ties with the UFC, leaving two contracted fights, a position as an on-air analyst and the UFC Heavyweight Championship behind. He received $250,000 (plus $936,000 of PPV revenue) for his comeback fight with Tim Sylvia. He received a $250,000 purse for defeating Gabriel Gonzaga (plus a $35,000 &quot;Fight of the Night&quot; bonus and $787,000 in PPV revenue). He complained Chuck Liddell was allegedly paid more than he was, despite losing his previous two fights. Couture cited the UFC&#x27;s failure to sign #1 ranked Heavyweight fighter Fedor Emelianenko, as well as disputes with UFC management, for his decision.

====Transition from fighter to coach====
Couture coached Oregon Fighter Musio Chavez for the Inter-collegiate Fight League.

On October 18, 2007, UFC president Dana White said Couture remained the UFC Heavyweight Champion despite his plans to quit, and reiterated he would not release Couture from the final two fights on his contract. Couture held a press conference on October 25, 2007, where he denied his departure from UFC was a &quot;retirement&quot;, set forth his grievances about his pay, and reiterated his belief that he would be free from any contractual obligations to the UFC after nine months.

On October 30, 2007, White and Zuffa CEO Lorenzo Fertitta held another press conference, where White reiterated the UFC&#x27;s position of twelve days prior, and released documents refuting Couture&#x27;s claims about the pay he received.

They met again on Thanksgiving weekend to discuss a possible UFC return, but Couture said he had no desire to do so at the time.

Cornering some of his fighters from Xtreme Couture at HDNet Fights on December 15 in Dallas, Couture answered questions about Fedor Emelianenko, stating that he would like to fight him in October, once his UFC contract expired, if the UFC could not come to a co-promotion agreement with Russia&#x27;s M-1 Global beforehand.

On January 15, 2008, Zuffa filed a lawsuit in Clark County District Court in Nevada, citing breach of contract and irreparable damage, seeking over $10,000 in damages. This suit only concerned Couture&#x27;s employment contract and not his promotional contract. On February 28, 2008, Judge Jennifer Togliatti handed down the first ruling in the case, issuing a preliminary injunction barring Couture from participating in an IFL event held the following day.

On August 2, 2008, a Texas appeals court granted Zuffa&#x27;s request for a stay against a motion for a declaratory judgment in a suit filed by HDNet regarding Couture&#x27;s contractual status with the UFC. The stay effectively ended the dispute in the state of Texas, and Zuffa was allowed to move forward with the Nevada suit.

====Return to the UFC====
On September 2, 2008, the UFC announced it had signed Couture to a new three-fight contract. On November 15, he returned at UFC 91 in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he lost the UFC Heavyweight Championship to Brock Lesnar. At first a closely contested match, Lesnar knocked Couture down in the second round and struck him with hammerfists for a TKO victory at 3:07. In a post-fight interview with Joe Rogan, Couture declared his desire to keep fighting and said he felt he was still becoming a better fighter, blaming the loss on his performance, not his age.

On August 29, 2009, Couture faced former UFC Interim Heavyweight Champion and former PRIDE Heavyweight Champion Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira at UFC 102 in Portland, Oregon, and lost by unanimous decision (30–27, 30–27, and 29–28). After the bout, Couture stated he felt he was in the best shape of his life, and would wait and see what the UFC had in store for him. The fight received the &quot;Fight of the Night&quot; award.

====Return to light heavyweight and retirement====
After the Nogueira loss, Couture signed a new six-fight deal, which superseded his previous contract.

On November 14, 2009, at UFC 105, Couture faced Brandon Vera. Vera landed effective strikes and scored a takedown, but Couture won a somewhat controversial unanimous decision. The fight was his first at Light heavyweight since losing to Chuck Liddell in 2006. With the win, the 46-year-old Couture became the oldest fighter to win a UFC bout.

Couture fought fellow UFC Hall of Famer Mark Coleman at UFC 109. The bout marked the first time UFC Hall of Famers fought each other in the UFC. They were scheduled to meet at UFC 17 in 1998, but an injury to Couture forced the cancellation of the bout. They wrestled each other in a freestyle match at the 1989 Olympic Festival at Oklahoma State University; Coleman won the match by one point. Couture modified his training for this bout, focusing on catch wrestling and refining his boxing under coach Gil Martinez. The combined age of these fighters (91) is the highest in any UFC match. Couture made Coleman pass out to a rear-naked choke submission in the second round, getting his first submission win in over four years.

Couture was scheduled to fight Rich Franklin at UFC 115, but Franklin instead fought Chuck Liddell, replacing Liddell&#x27;s original opponent, Tito Ortiz. Couture instead faced three-time boxing world champion James Toney at UFC 118. Couture dominated Toney, taking him down and mounting him within seconds, and quickly making him submit to an arm triangle choke. The match achieved notoriety, though it drew criticisms of being a freak show fight, among them by UFC President Dana White himself. Many also felt that this fight had been made as an attempt to repair damage done to the credibility of MMA after Ray Mercer knocked out former UFC Heavyweight Champion Tim Sylvia.

Couture had stated he was interested in fighting either Lyoto Machida or Maurício Rua (in a non-title bout). Since Rua had an upcoming title defense against Jon Jones, UFC matchmakers gave him Machida. They fought on April 30, 2011, at UFC 129, before 55,000 fans in Toronto. Couture had stated before the bout it would be his final fight. Machida knocked him out in the second round with a jumping front kick. After the fight, Couture announced he was &quot;finally done fighting&quot;, at the age of 47.

===Bellator Fighting Championships===
On January 29, 2013, Couture signed with Bellator to be a coach in the first season of their reality show, &quot;Fight Master: Bellator MMA&quot; which debuted in June 2013. Couture also did commentary for Bellator 96.

==Acting==
Couture made a cameo appearance in the direct-to-video Steven Seagal film &quot;Today You Die&quot; and on the season finale of the CBS show &quot;The Unit&quot;, as a military guard. He played fight commentator Terry Flynn in the film &quot;Redbelt&quot;. He appeared on an episode of The History Channel show &quot;Human Weapon&quot; on September 27, 2007, and starred in the 2008 film &quot;The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior&quot;. He played Toll Road in the 2010 movie &quot;The Expendables&quot; and reprised the role in the 2012, 2014 and 2023 sequels. He did several public service announcements, one against crystal meth. He starred alongside 50 Cent and Bruce Willis in the 2011 film, &quot;Setup&quot;, as an enforcer named Petey.

In 2012, he played the leading role of hard-bitten cop Paul Ross in Brandon Nutt&#x27;s action film &quot;Hijacked&quot;, alongside Dominic Purcell.

On September 4, 2014, it was announced that Couture would be one of the celebrities competing on the 19th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He paired with professional dancer Karina Smirnoff. The couple was eliminated on the third week of competition finishing in eleventh place.

Couture has appeared in 4 episodes of the TV series &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; as Jason Duclair.

Couture appeared on &quot;Impractical Jokers&quot; as a guest during Sal Vulcano&#x27;s punishment in the episode &quot;Pantsing with the Stars&quot;. In that episode, Vulcano, who refused an instruction during a challenge where he was posing as a Krav Maga instructor, was given a surprise punishment by the other Jokers in that he then had to wrestle Couture and attempt to “pants” him.

In 2019, Couture starred alongside Luke Goss and Michael Jai White in the movie &quot;The Hard Way&quot;, which was among the most popular watched movies on Netflix. He also appeared in the film &quot;Outlaw Johnny Black&quot;.

In July 2019, Couture appeared on an episode of the Outdoor Channel show &quot;Gunnytime&quot; entitled &quot;Teamwork Makes the Dream Work&quot;.

==Personal life==

He has three children, including Aimee, Ryan, and Caden “Cooter” Couture as well as four grandchildren. He often works with and is the long-term partner of Mindy Robinson.

Asked if MMA could be improved, he suggested health insurance, retirement plans as well as more equal compensation regarding other athletes and sports. He lives in Las Vegas.
He enjoys hunting.

In 2012 Randy Couture was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame (ISHOF) presented by sports legend Dr. Robert M. Goldman.

<text>HD 76700 is a star in the southern constellation of Volans. It is yellow in hue and is too faint to be visible to the naked eye, having an apparent visual magnitude of 8.16. This object is located at a distance of 197 light years from the Sun based on stellar parallax. It is drifting further away with a radial velocity of +39 km/s.

== Properties ==
This object is a G-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of G6V, which indicates it is generating energy through core hydrogen fusion. It is a metal-enriched star, showing a much higher metallicity than the Sun. This may be explained by prior accretion of refractory-rich planetary bodies into the stellar atmosphere. The mass of HD 76700 is very similar to (1.1 times) that of the Sun, but it is cooler and brighter (with an effective temperature of 5,694 K and luminosity of 1.69 Suns) and thus much older—around 6.9 billion years old.

== Planetary ==
HD 76700 is orbited by a giant planet that was discovered in 2003 via the radial velocity method. Designated , this planet is orbiting very close to the star with a period of just four days.

<text>Stanisław of Skarbimierz (1360–1431; Latinised as &quot;Stanislaus de Scarbimiria&quot;) was the first rector of the University of Krakow following its restoration in 1399. He was the author of &quot;Sermones sapientiales&quot; (), comprising 113 sermons.

Stanisław was born in Skalbmierz, a town some 50 km north-east of Kraków. His sermons were the foundation of Polish political doctrine that culminated in the system of Nobles&#x27; Democracy (&quot;Golden Liberty&quot;) in Poland and, from 1569, in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Many ideas central to this doctrine may be found in subsequent works by Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki (1530–1607) that appear to have influenced the 17th-century English Commonwealth as well as the Founding Fathers of the United States.

Along with Paweł Włodkowic, Stanisław framed the Polish position at the Council of Constance, pioneering ideas of modern human rights and international law. His sermons &quot;About Just War&quot; (&quot;De bellis justis&quot;) and &quot;About robbery&quot; (&quot;De rapina&quot;) laid foundations of the medieval theory of just war. The sermons justified the position of the Kingdom of Poland in its war against the Teutonic Knights. Stanisław died in 1431 in Kraków.

His &quot;Sermons&quot; were influenced by earlier works of Augustine of Hippo and Wincenty Kadłubek.

<doc id="1216801" wikidata="Q1454599" url="?curid=1216801" title="Simplified Technical English">
<text>ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English (STE) is a controlled language designed to simplify and clarify technical documentation. It was originally developed during the 1980&#x27;s by the European Association of Aerospace Industries (AECMA), at the request of the European Airline industry, who wanted a standardized form of English for technical documentation that could be easily understood by non-English speakers. It has since been adopted in many other fields outside the aerospace, defense, and maintenance domains for its clear, consistent, and comprehensive nature. The current edition of the STE Specification, published in April 2021, consists of 53 writing rules and a dictionary of approximately 900 approved words.

==History==
The first attempts towards controlled English were made as early as the 1930s and 1970s with Basic English, Caterpillar Fundamental English and Eastman Kodak (KISL). In 1979, aerospace documentation was written in American English (Boeing, Douglas, Lockheed, etc.), in British English (Hawker Siddeley, British Aircraft Corporation, etc.) and by companies whose native language was not English (Fokker, Aeritalia, Aerospatiale, and some of the companies that formed Airbus at the time).

Because European airlines needed to translate parts of their maintenance documentation into other languages for local mechanics, the European Airline industry approached AECMA (the European Association of Aerospace Industries) to investigate the possibility of using a controlled or standardized form of English. In 1983, after an investigation into the different types of controlled languages that existed in other industries, AECMA decided to produce its own controlled English. The AIA (Aerospace Industries Association of America) was also invited to participate in this project. The result of this collaborative work was the release of the AECMA Document, PSC-85-16598 (known as the AECMA Simplified English Guide) in 1986. Subsequently, several changes, issues and revisions were released up to the present issue (the current Issue 8 of STE is dated April 2021).

After the merger of AECMA with two other associations to form the Aerospace, Security and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) in 2004, the specification was renamed &quot;ASD Simplified Technical English, Specification ASD-STE100&quot;. ASD-STE100 is maintained by the Simplified Technical English Maintenance Group (STEMG), a working group of ASD, formed in 1983; the copyright of ASD-STE100 is fully owned by ASD. 

Due to the ever-evolving nature of technology and technical language, the STEMG also relies on user feedback for suggested changes and updates. Starting from Issue 6 in 2013, the Specification became free of charge. Over the years, more than 11,800 official copies of Issues 6 and 7 were distributed. Since Issue 8 was released in April 2021, over 3,200 official copies have been distributed (distribution log updated August 2022). Usually, a new issue is released every three years.

A free official copy of the ASD-STE100 Specification can be requested through the ASD-STE100 website and through ASD-STAN.

==Benefits==
Simplified Technical English can:
* provide a single word to replace English words with multiple meanings (e.g., &quot;includes&quot; instead of &quot;comes with&quot;)
* improve the clarity of technical writing, especially procedural writing
* improve comprehension for people whose first language is not English
* make human translation easier, faster, and more cost-effective
* facilitate computer-assisted translation and machine translation
* improve reliability concerns of maintenance and assembly by reducing their probability to introduce defects or human-factor risks.
These claims come mostly from those who have invested in developing, implementing, or supporting STE. To date, there are no published scientific studies to provide evidence about the benefits of STE, suggesting the need for more research.

==Specification structure==
The ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English specification consists of two parts:
# The writing rules
# The dictionary

=== Writing rules ===
The writing rules differentiate between two types of topics: procedural and descriptive writing. The rules also cover aspects of grammar and style. A non-exhaustive list of the writing rules includes the concepts that follow:

* Use the approved words and only as the part of speech and meaning given in the dictionary.
* Make instructions as clear and specific as possible.
* Do not write noun clusters that have more than three words.
* Use the approved forms of the verb to make only:
** The infinitive
** The imperative
** The simple present tense
** The simple past tense
** The past participle (only as an adjective)
** The future tense
* Do not use helping verbs to make complex verb structures.
* Use the &quot;-ing&quot; form of a verb only as a technical name or as a modifier in a technical name.
* Do not use passive voice in procedures.
* Use the active voice as much as possible in descriptive texts.
* Write short sentences: no more than 20 words in instructions (procedures) and 25 words in descriptive texts.
* Do not omit parts of the sentence (e.g. verb, subject, article) to make your text shorter.
* Use vertical lists for complex text.
* Write one instruction per sentence.
* Write only one topic per paragraph.
* Do not write more than six sentences in each paragraph.
* Start safety instructions with a clear command or condition.

===Dictionary===
The table that follows is an extract from a page of the ASD-STE100 dictionary:

Explanation of the four columns:

Word (part of speech) – This column has information on the word and its part of speech. Every approved word in STE is only permitted as a specific part of speech. For example, the word &quot;test&quot; is only approved as a noun (the test) but not as a verb (to test). There are few exceptions to the &quot;One word, one part of speech, one meaning&quot; principle.

Approved meaning/ALTERNATIVES – This column gives the approved meaning (or definition) of an approved word in STE. In the example table, &quot;ACCESS&quot; and &quot;ACCIDENT&quot; are approved (they are written in uppercase). The text in these definitions is not written in STE. If a meaning is not given in the dictionary, you cannot use the word in that meaning. Use an alternative word. For words that are not approved (they are written in lowercase, such as &quot;acceptance&quot; and &quot;accessible&quot; in the example table), this column gives approved alternatives that you can use to replace the unapproved words. These alternatives are in uppercase, and they are only suggestions. It is possible that the suggested alternative for an unapproved word has a different part of speech. Usually, the first suggested alternative has the same part of speech as the unapproved word.

APPROVED EXAMPLE – This column shows how to use the approved word or how to use the approved alternative (usually a word-for-word replacement). It also shows how to keep the same meaning with a different construction. The wording given in the approved examples is not mandatory. It shows only one method to write the same information with approved words. You can frequently use different constructions with other approved words to say the same thing.

Not approved example – This column (text in lowercase) shows examples of how the unapproved word is frequently used in standard technical writing. The examples also help you to understand how you can use the approved alternatives and/or different constructions to give the same information. For approved words, this column is empty unless there is a help symbol (lightbulb) related to other meanings or restrictions.

The dictionary includes entries of both approved and unapproved words. The approved words can only be used according to their specified meaning. For example, the word &quot;close&quot; (v) can only be used in one of two meanings:

# To move together, or to move to a position that stops or prevents materials from going in or out
# To operate a circuit breaker to make an electrical circuit

The verb can express &quot;to close a door&quot; or &quot;to close a circuit&quot;, but it cannot be used with other connotations (e.g., &quot;to close a meeting&quot; or &quot;to close a business&quot;). The adjective &quot;close&quot; appears in the dictionary as an unapproved word with the suggested approved alternative &quot;NEAR.&quot; Thus, STE does not allow &quot;do not go close to the landing gear&quot;, but it does allow &quot;do not go near the landing gear&quot;. In addition to the general STE vocabulary listed in the dictionary, Section 1, Words, gives specific guidelines for using technical names and technical verbs that writers need to describe technical information. For example, words, noun clusters, or verbs such as &quot;grease&quot;, &quot;discoloration&quot;, &quot;propeller&quot;, &quot;aural warning system&quot;, &quot;overhead panel&quot;, &quot;to ream&quot;, and &quot;to drill&quot; are not listed in the dictionary, but they qualify as approved terms according to Part 1, Section 1 (specifically, writing rules 1.5 and 1.12).

==Aerospace and defense standards==
&quot;Simplified Technical English&quot; is sometimes used as a generic term for a controlled language. The aerospace and defense specification started as an industry-regulated writing standard for aerospace maintenance documentation, but it has become a requirement for an increasing number of military land vehicles, seacraft, and weapons programs. Although it was not initially intended for use as a general writing standard, it has been successfully adopted by other industries and for a wide range of document types. The US government&#x27;s Plain English lacks the strict vocabulary restrictions of the aerospace standard, but represents an attempt at a more general writing standard.

Since 1986, STE has been a requirement of the ATA Specification i2200 (formerly ATA100) and ATA104 (Training). STE is also a requirement of the S1000D Specification. The European Defence Standards Reference (EDSTAR) recommends STE as one of the best practice standards for writing technical documentation to be applied for defense contracting by all EDA (European Defence Agency) participating member states.

Today, the success of STE is such that other industries use it beyond its initial purpose for maintenance documentation and outside the aerospace and defense domains; as of August 2022, the STE distribution log shows that 56% of users come from outside these two industries. It is successfully applied in the automotive, renewable energies, and offshore logistics sectors, and is further expanding within medical devices and the pharmaceutical sector. STE interest is also increasing within the academic world, including the disciplines of information engineering, applied linguistics, and computational linguistics).

==Tools==
Several outside software products exist to support the application of STE, but the STEMG does not endorse or certify these products.

Boeing developed the Boeing Simplified English Checker (BSEC). This linguistic-based checker uses a sophisticated 350-rule English parser, which is augmented with special functions that check for violations of the Simplified Technical English specification.

HyperSTE is a plugin tool offered by Etteplan to check content for adherence to the rules and grammar of the specification.

Congree offers a Simplified Technical English Checker based on linguistic algorithms. It supports all rules of Simplified Technical English issue 7 that are relevant to the text composition and provides an integrated Simplified Technical English dictionary.

The TechScribe term checker for ASD-STE100 helps writers to find text that does not conform to ASD-STE100.

<text>The Winnemem Wintu (&quot;middle river people&quot; or &quot;middle water people&quot;) are a Native American band of the Wintu tribe originally located along the lower McCloud River, above Shasta Dam near Redding, California.

==History==

Forty-two Winnemem men, women and children were killed by white settlers at Kabyai Creek, on the McCloud River, in 1854. This action is known as the Kaibai Creek Massacre.

Around the late 19th century and early 20th century, local militias were awarded $5 for proof of every Native American person killed.

Since 1945, portions of the lower McCloud River have been flooded by Shasta Lake, the reservoir created by the Shasta Dam. In 1971, a group of Winnemem Wintu occupied Toyon-Wintu Center, a government-owned property where housing had been built for dam construction workers. They were granted a temporary permit to remain at the site in 1973, but the government moved to evict the thirty remaining Wintu residents in 1988, completing the eviction in 1989.

The Winnemem Wintu have been in a protracted fight with the State of California and the federal Bureau of Reclamation over the proposed raising of the height of Shasta Dam to secure more water for California cities and agriculture. The Winnemem Wintu argue that the proposed higher lake level would flood many Winnemem Wintu sacred sites. From September 12 to 16, 2004, one faction of Winnemem Wintu held a &quot;war dance&quot; as a protest. They claim it was the first war dance held since 1887.

The Winnemem Wintu claim important sacred sites on Mount Shasta and Cold Spring Mountain. They are one of several groups of Native Americans who feel that casinos and their proceeds destroy culture from the inside out and refuse to participate in the gaming industry.

The Winnemem healer Florence Jones (Puilulimet) (1907–2003) was portrayed in a nationally broadcast PBS documentary, &quot;In the Light of Reverence&quot;, in 2001, as she successfully led her community&#x27;s fight to stop construction of a new ski resort on sacred Mount Shasta.

== Language ==
The Winnemem Wintu traditionally spoke the North Eastern Dialect of the Northern Wintun Language, a member of the Wintuan languages, and a member of the larger Penutian language &quot;stock&quot;. Chief Caleen Sisk has been working with linguist Stefan Liedtke and the Indigenous Language Institute on the revitalization of the Winnemem Wintu language.

== Federal recognition ==

The Winnemem are one of what anthropologists have hypothesized to be nine total bands of Wintu. They are not a federally recognized tribe, although they are working toward federal recognition. The Winnemem Wintu are divided politically into several groups, with members participating in at least three organized groups attempting to obtain federal recognition. In addition, there are several Winnemem Wintu descendants who decline to participate in these groups for various reasons.

Some Winnemem Wintu feel that the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) does not recognize them because of government error rather than termination. BIA officials have informed some Wintu representatives of Winnemem heritage that &quot;Bureaucratic Oversight&quot; resulted in the entire Wintu being omitted from the list of federally recognized tribes as early as the 1940s.

One Winnemem Wintu group argues that they were accidentally erased from the Bureau of Indian Affairs list of recognized tribes during the 1980s. They have not been able to regain this recognition. Legislation sponsored by Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell in 2004 gave these Winnemem Wintu the opportunity to regain recognition. However, the Winnemem Wintu were informed that the group&#x27;s inclusion on an omnibus bill related to all Native American tribal people would have put the entire bill at risk. Rather than have other tribal people put at risk, the Winnemem Wintu agreed with Senator Campbell to remove their name from the bill.

<text>Pont-Audemer () is a commune in the Eure department in the Normandy region in northern France. On 1 January 2018, the former commune of Saint-Germain-Village was merged into Pont-Audemer.

==Geography==
The commune is situated on the river Risle, 13 km upstream from its outflow into the Seine. It lies on the border between the regions Roumois and Lieuvin.

The commune along with another 69 communes shares part of a 4,747 hectare, Natura 2000 conservation area, called Risle, Guiel, Charentonne.

==Population==
The population data in the table below refer to the commune of Pont-Audemer proper, in its geography at the given years. The commune of Pont-Audemer absorbed part of the former commune of Saint-Aignan in 1835, Saint-Paul-sur-Risle in 1963 and Saint-Germain-Village in 2018.
==Sights==
The commune was spared substantial damage to its historic buildings during the Battle of Normandy. Nowadays the half-timbered buildings and the canals running between them are a tourist attraction. The church of Saint-Ouen is noted for its Renaissance stained glass.

==Personalities==
*Laetitia Casta, supermodel, was born there in 1978.
*Delphine Philippe-Lemaître, 19th-century historian, archaeologist
*Hervé Morin, politician, former French Minister of Defence was born there in 1961.
*Alexis Vastine, boxer, was born there in 1986.

==Transport==
Pont-Audemer has a railway station, Gare de Pont-Audemer, but passenger services were ceased in 1969. The station is served by TER Haute-Normandie buses. PontAuRail, a heritage railway association, ran two Diesel multiple units (a X4500 and a X2400) from Pont-Audemer to Honfleur between 1995 and 2006.

==Administration==
Until 1926, Pont-Audemer was a sub-prefecture of the Eure department.

==Media==
The city is evoked in a poem of Paul Verlaine called &quot;The Apollo of Pont-Audemer.&quot;
The area is included in Ted Fahrenwald&#x27;s book &quot;Bailout Over Normandy: A Flyboy&#x27;s Adventures&quot; as the site where he met Riri, his sweetheart.

<text>Protaras () is a predominantly tourist resort which comes under the administrative jurisdiction of Paralimni Municipality in Cyprus. In ancient times, where Protaras is now located, stood the old city-state of Leukolla. The city possessed a small safe harbour where Demetrius Poliorketes sought refuge in the year 306 BC, lying in wait for Ptolemy, one of the successors of Alexander the Great. In the ensuing battle, Ptolemy was defeated and fled to Egypt, leaving Cyprus in the hands of Demetrius for a short time. Protaras is also referred to as &quot;the land of windmills&quot;, maintaining the nostalgic quality of the past.

Protaras has clear sky-blue waters and sandy beaches, the most well-known of which is Fig Tree Bay. Building on the success of Ayia Napa, located about southwest, it has expanded into a modern holiday resort of considerable size with tens of high capacity hotels, hotel apartments, villas, restaurants, pubs and associated facilities. Being quieter than Ayia Napa and having less of a club scene, it has a reputation of catering more for family and Cypriot tourism. Cape Greco is a 10-minute drive from the center of Protaras.

Protaras is a diving destination. Green Bay is the most popular dive site and has statues placed underwater for the thousands of first timers to enjoy while trying their scuba skills. The Blue Hole, the chapel, the Decosta Bay, Malama bay. Protaras most famous dive site for Technical Diving is the Cyclops bay located on the border with Ayia Napa.

<text>The Andersonville National Historic Site, located near Andersonville, Georgia, preserves the former Andersonville Prison (also known as Camp Sumter), a Confederate prisoner-of-war camp during the final fourteen months of the American Civil War. Most of the site lies in southwestern Macon County, adjacent to the east side of the town of Andersonville. The site also contains the Andersonville National Cemetery and the National Prisoner of War Museum. The prison was created in February 1864 and served until April 1865.

The site was commanded by Captain Henry Wirz, who was tried and executed after the war for war crimes. The prison was overcrowded to four times its capacity, and had an inadequate water supply, inadequate food, and unsanitary conditions. Of the approximately 45,000 Union prisoners held at Camp Sumter during the war, nearly 13,000 (28%) died. The chief causes of death were scurvy, diarrhea, and dysentery.

== Conditions ==

The prison, which opened in February 1864, originally covered about of land enclosed by a high stockade. In June 1864, it was enlarged to . The stockade was rectangular, of dimensions by . There were two entrances on the west side of the stockade, known as &quot;north entrance&quot; and &quot;south entrance&quot;. This allowed for a space of about 5 feet by 6 feet (1.5 x 2 m) for each prisoner.

=== Descriptions of Andersonville ===

Robert H. Kellogg, sergeant major in the 16th Regiment Connecticut Volunteers, described his entry as a prisoner into the prison camp, May 2, 1864:

As we entered the place, a spectacle met our eyes that almost froze our blood with horror, and made our hearts fail within us. Before us were forms that had once been active and erect;—&quot;stalwart men&quot;, now nothing but mere walking skeletons, covered with filth and vermin. Many of our men, in the heat and intensity of their feeling, exclaimed with earnestness. &quot;Can this be hell?&quot; &quot;God protect us!&quot; and all thought that he alone could bring them out alive from so terrible a place. In the center of the whole was a swamp, occupying about three or four acres of the narrowed limits, and a part of this marshy place had been used by the prisoners as a sink, and excrement covered the ground, the scent arising from which was suffocating. The ground allotted to our ninety was near the edge of this plague-spot, and how we were to live through the warm summer weather in the midst of such fearful surroundings, was more than we cared to think of just then.

Further descriptions of the camp can be found in the diary of Ransom Chadwick, a member of the 85th New York Infantry Regiment. Chadwick and his regimental mates were taken to the Andersonville Prison, arriving on April 30, 1864. An extensive and detailed diary was kept by John L. Ransom of his time as a prisoner at Andersonville.

Father Peter Whelan arrived on June 16, 1864, to muster the resources of the Catholic church and help provide relief to the prisoners.

=== The dead line ===
At Andersonville, a light fence known as &quot;the dead line&quot; was erected approximately inside the stockade wall. It demarcated a no-man&#x27;s land that kept prisoners away from the wall, which was made of rough-hewn logs about high and stakes driven into the ground. Anyone crossing or even touching this &quot;dead line&quot; was shot without warning by sentries in the guard platforms (called &quot;pigeon roosts&quot;) on the stockade. (It is considered possible, although not established, that the modern term in the sense of a time limit derives from this.)

=== Health problems ===

At this stage of the war, Andersonville Prison was frequently under-supplied with food. By 1864, civilians in the Confederacy and soldiers of the Confederate Army were all struggling to obtain sufficient quantities of food. The shortage of fare was suffered by prisoners and Confederate personnel alike within the fort, but the prisoners received less than the guards. Unlike the captives, the guards did not become severely emaciated or suffer from scurvy as a consequence of vitamin C deficiency due to a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables in their diet. The poor diets and resulting scurvy was likely a major cause of the camp&#x27;s high mortality rate, as well as dysentery and typhoid fever. These resulted from filthy living conditions and poor sanitation. The only source of drinking water was a creek that also served as the camp&#x27;s latrine. It was filled at all times with fecal matter from thousands of sick and dying men. Even when sufficient quantities of supplies were available, they were of poor quality and inadequately prepared.

There were no new outfits given to prisoners, whose own clothing was often falling to pieces. In some cases, garments were taken from the dead. John McElroy, a prisoner at Andersonville, recalled &quot;Before one was fairly cold his clothes would be appropriated and divided, and I have seen many sharp fights between contesting claimants&quot;.

Although the prison was surrounded by forest, very little wood was allowed to the prisoners for warmth or cooking. This, along with the lack of utensils, made it almost impossible for the prisoners to cook the meager food rations they received, which consisted of poorly milled cornflour. During the summer of 1864, Union prisoners suffered greatly from hunger, exposure and disease. Within seven months, about a third had died from dysentery and scurvy; they were buried in mass graves, the standard practice for Confederate prison authorities at Andersonville. In 1864, the Confederate Surgeon General asked Joseph Jones, an expert on infectious disease, to investigate the high mortality rate at the camp. He concluded that it was due to &quot;scorbutic dysentery&quot; (bloody diarrhea caused by vitamin C deficiency). In 2010, the historian Rosemary Drisdelle said that hookworm disease, a condition not recognized or known during the Civil War, was the major cause of many of the fatalities among the prisoners.

=== Survival and social networks ===
At the time of the Civil War, the concept of a prisoner of war camp was still new. It was not until 1863 that President Lincoln demanded a code of conduct be instituted to guarantee prisoners of war an entitlement to food and medical treatment and to protect them from enslavement, torture and murder. Andersonville did not provide its occupants with these guarantees; the prisoners at Andersonville, without any sort of law enforcement or protections, functioned more closely to a primitive society than a civil one. As such, survival often depended on the strength of a prisoner&#x27;s social network within the prison. A prisoner with friends inside Andersonville was more likely to survive than a lone prisoner. Social networks provided prisoners with food, clothes, shelter, moral support, trading opportunities and protection against other prisoners. One study found that a prisoner having a strong social network within Andersonville &quot;had a statistically significant positive effect on survival probabilities, and that the closer the ties between friends as measured by such identifiers as ethnicity, kinship and the same home town, the bigger the effect.&quot;

=== The Raiders ===
A group of prisoners, calling themselves the Andersonville Raiders, attacked their fellow inmates to steal food, jewellery, money and clothing. They were armed mostly with clubs and killed to get what they wanted. Another group started up, organized by Peter &quot;Big Pete&quot; Aubrey, to stop the larceny, calling themselves &quot;Regulators&quot;. They caught nearly all of the Raiders, who were tried by the Regulators&#x27; judge, Peter McCullough, and a jury, selected from a group of new prisoners. This jury, upon finding the Raiders guilty, set punishment that included running the gauntlet, being sent to the stocks, ball and chain and, in six cases, hanging.

The conditions were so poor that in July 1864, Captain Henry Wirz paroled five Union soldiers to deliver a petition signed by the majority of Andersonville&#x27;s prisoners asking that the Union reinstate prisoner exchanges to relieve the overcrowding and allow prisoners to leave these terrible conditions. That request was denied. The petitioners, who had sworn to return, reported this to their comrades.

===Deaths===
During the war, 45,000 prisoners were received at Andersonville prison; of these nearly 13,000 died. The nature and causes of the deaths are a source of controversy among historians. Some contend that the deaths resulted from Confederate policy and were war crimes against Union prisoners, while others state that they resulted from disease promoted by severe overcrowding, the widespread food shortage in the Confederate States, the prison officials&#x27; incompetence, and the breakdown of the prisoner exchange system, caused by the Confederacy&#x27;s refusal to include black Union troops in the exchanges. The stockade became severely overcrowded.

During the war, disease was the primary cause of death in both armies. Infectious disease was a chronic problem, due to poor sanitation in regular as well as prison camps.

=== Dorence Atwater ===
A young Union prisoner, Dorence Atwater, was chosen to record the names and numbers of the dead at Andersonville, for use by the Confederacy and the federal government after the war ended. He believed, correctly, the federal government would never see the list. Therefore, he sat next to Henry Wirz, who was in charge of the prison pen, and secretly kept his own list among other papers. When Atwater was released, he put the list in his bag and took it through the lines without being caught. It was published by the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; when Horace Greeley, the paper&#x27;s owner, learned the federal government had refused the list and given Atwater much grief. Atwater believed that the commanding officer Wirz had been trying to ensure that Union prisoners would be rendered unfit to fight if they survived the prison.

=== Newell Burch ===
Prisoner of war (POW) Newell Burch also recorded Andersonville&#x27;s poor conditions in his diary. A member of the 154th New York Volunteer Infantry, Logan was captured on the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg; he was first imprisoned at Belle Isle in Richmond, Virginia and then Andersonville. He is credited with having been the longest-held Union prisoner of war during the Civil War, having survived a total of 661 days in Confederate hands. His diary is in the collection of the Dunn County Historical Society in Menomonie, Wisconsin; a mimeographed copy is held by the Wisconsin Historical Society.

=== Prisoner population ===
== Escapes ==
Planning an escape from this camp was routine among the thousands of prisoners. Most men formed units to burrow out of the camp using tunnels. The locations of the tunnels would aim towards nearby forests fifty feet from the wall. Once out, escape was nearly impossible due to the poor health of prisoners. Prisoners caught trying to escape were denied rations, chain ganged, or killed. Playing dead was another method of escape. The death rate of the camp being around a hundred per day made disposing of bodies a relaxed procedure by the guards. Prisoners would pretend to be dead and carried out to the row of dead bodies outside of the walls. As soon as night fell the men would get up and run. Once Wirz learned of this practice he ordered an examination by surgeons on all bodies taken out of the camp.

Confederate records show that 351 prisoners (about 0.7% of all inmates) escaped, though many were recaptured. The US Army lists 32 as returning to Union lines; of the rest, some likely simply returned to civilian life without notifying the military, while others probably died.

== Confederacy&#x27;s offer to release prisoners ==
In the latter part of the summer of 1864, the Confederacy offered to conditionally release prisoners if the Union would send ships to retrieve them (Andersonville is inland, with access possible only via rail and road). In the autumn of 1864, after the Battle of Atlanta, all the prisoners who were well enough to be moved were sent to Florence Stockade (near Florence, South Carolina) and Camp Lawton (near Millen, Georgia). At Millen, better arrangements prevailed, and prisoners were transported by rail to the port of Savannah. After General William Tecumseh Sherman began his march to the sea and destroyed Millen, the remaining prisoners were returned to Andersonville.

== Liberation ==
Andersonville Prison was liberated by the Union Army in May 1865, with the prisoners inside being found and described as &quot;human skeletons amid hellish scenes of desolation&quot;.

==Trial==

After the war, Henry Wirz, commandant of the inner stockade at Camp Sumter, was tried by a military tribunal on charges of war crimes. The trial was presided over by Union General Lew Wallace and featured chief Judge Advocate General (JAG) prosecutor Norton Parker Chipman.

A number of former prisoners testified about conditions at Andersonville, many accusing Wirz of specific acts of cruelty. The court also considered official correspondence from captured Confederate records. Perhaps the most damaging was a letter to the Confederate surgeon general by James Jones, who in 1864 was sent by Richmond to investigate conditions at Camp Sumter. Jones had been appalled by what he found, and reported he vomited twice and contracted influenza from the single hour he&#x27;d toured the camp. His graphically detailed report to his superiors all but closed the case for the prosecution.

Wirz presented evidence that he had pleaded to Confederate authorities to try to get more food and that he had tried to improve the conditions for the prisoners inside. He was found guilty, and sentenced to death. On November 10, 1865, he was hanged. Wirz was one of three men executed after the war for war crimes and the only Confederate official; the others were guerrillas Champ Ferguson and Henry C. Magruder. The revelation of the prisoners&#x27; sufferings was one of the factors that affected public opinion in the North regarding the South after the close of the Civil War.

Contrary to common belief, Wirz was not the only person prosecuted for his actions at Andersonville. James Duncan, who had worked in the quartermaster&#x27;s office at Camp Sumter, was convicted of manslaughter for allegedly withholding food from some of the prisoners. Duncan had previously been called as a defense witness for Wirz, but was arrested when he arrived to give evidence.

==Aftermath==

In 1890, the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), Department of Georgia, bought the site of Andersonville Prison through membership and subscriptions. It found that as their number was growing less year by year, and as it required a great deal of money to keep up the place, it would be better for them to offer it to the Woman&#x27;s Relief Corps (WRC), the auxiliary to the GAR.

When the WRC was in annual session in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1896, representatives of the Georgia GAR came before them, and offering the old prison, asked them to accept the gift and keep it from desecration. The women accepted it as a sacred trust, and immediately appointed Lizabeth A. Turner , as chairman of a board to beautify the grounds and make a park of them. A house for a caretaker was needed, and as the women did not want to build it within the old stockade, more land was purchased making the acreage within the enclosure about . A ten-room house was erected, a caretaker installed, and then the tedious process of making a park was begun. Bermuda grass was planted root by root, a pear and pecan orchard set out, and a rose garden planted, with rose bushes sent from almost every state in the Union. Several states were given ground upon which to erect monuments to their dead soldiers. These were Massachusetts, Ohio, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. Turner having died while in discharge of her duty, the WRC also erected a monument to her memory in the park.

In 1910, the site was donated by the WRC to the federal government. In the following year, the memorial tablet set up by the donors was unveiled. Upon the tablet are the names of the incorporators of the WRC as well as the names of the Board of Trustees for 1909-10, and the names of the committee on transfer to the government.

== National Prisoner of War Museum ==
The National Prisoner of War Museum opened in 1998 as a memorial to all American prisoners of war. Exhibits use art, photographs, displays, and video presentations to depict the capture, living conditions, hardships, and experiences of American prisoners of war in all periods. The museum also serves as the park&#x27;s visitor center.

== Andersonville National Cemetery ==

The cemetery is the final resting place for the Union prisoners who died while being held at Camp Sumter/Andersonville as POWs. The prisoners&#x27; burial ground at Camp Sumter has been made a national cemetery. It contains 13,714 graves, of which 921 are marked &quot;unknown&quot;.

As a National Cemetery, it is also used as a burial place for more recent veterans and their dependents.

Visitors can walk the site of Camp Sumter, which has been outlined with double rows of white posts. Two sections of the stockade wall have been reconstructed: the north gate and the northeast corner.

<text>Henry Thomas Muggeridge (26 June 1864 – 25 March 1942) was a British politician. He was the father of the author and journalist Malcolm Muggeridge and also Eric Muggeridge who is one of the founders of Plan International.

==Life==
Muggeridge was born the son of undertaker Henry Ambrose Muggeridge in Penge, which was then a small village but is now incorporated into the city of London, on 26 June 1864. When the family was abandoned by his father, Muggeridge left school and began work as an office boy in the City of London. The little money he kept for himself was spent on books, and it was his avid lunchtime reading that led to a keen interest in politics. His second job was again as an office boy for a firm of shirtmakers, where he stayed until he retired. He eventually became Company Secretary, but had turned down a directorship, as he felt it would be at odds with his political principles.

In 1893, Muggeridge married Annie Booler, the daughter of a Sheffield factory foreman, and they had five sons, Malcolm being the middle child. Malcolm Muggeridge&#x27;s biographer Richard Ingrams described H.T. as &quot;a small bearded man with a large frame, a twinkling eye, and a rather bulbous nose which he passed on to his son.&quot; Malcolm&#x27;s first name, Thomas, was chosen by H.T. in honor of his hero Thomas Carlyle.

One of Malcolm&#x27;s quoted memories of his father is of his visits to the Surrey Street Market, where he would set up his platform and expound his views on the need for socialism: &quot;Now ladies and gentlemen. It&#x27;s His Majesty&#x27;s Government, His Majesty&#x27;s Navy, His Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office, His Majesty&#x27;s this and His Majesty&#x27;s that. But it&#x27;s the National Debt. Why isn&#x27;t that His Majesty&#x27;s? We&#x27;ll gladly let His Majesty have that, won&#x27;t we?&quot;

Muggeridge&#x27;s early interest in politics at first led to his joining the Penge Liberals, and with them he campaigned for local improvements. By his late twenties he was a socialist, and he joined first the Fabians, then the Independent Labour Party. An excellent public speaker, he founded and became secretary of the Croydon Socialist Society in 1895, and stood for the Croydon Borough Council in Norwood in 1896 and 1897. He was not to be successful until November 1911, although Croydon had already had several Labour councillors. Muggeridge was the first President of Ruskin House, the Labour and Trade Union centre in Croydon, having been instrumental in its relocation and refounding.

Muggeridge remained a Croydon councillor until 1930, at which time he also became a Justice of the Peace. He was instrumental in getting Croydon&#x27;s first council houses built and campaigned for Trade Union rates of pay for all municipal employees.

Although he stood for Parliament in Croydon South four times, in 1918, 1922, 1923, and 1924, Muggeridge finally became a member of parliament for Romford in 1929. He lost his seat in 1931 and returned to Croydon Council in 1933, retiring in 1940, at the age of 75.

==Death==
He died in Hastings, East Sussex, in 1942 and was buried in Whatlington, near Battle, East Sussex.

<text>Santo António is a civil parish in the municipality of São Roque do Pico on the northern coast of the island of Pico in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2011 was 815 in an area of approximately .

==History==

The parish remotes to the end of the 17th century, when it was ecclesiastical parish of Santo António, in honour of Anthony of Padua. Its principal centre of worship was dedicated to the invocation of the saint, the single-belfry Church of Santo António (which was unique at the time for having only one belltower, as compared to the other churches on the island). The church was dotted with a valuable retable located in the presbytery, elaborated in thin guildwork and its stoic large images dedicated to St. Anthony and the Sacred Heart of Jesus.

In addition, the parish included several hermitages dedicated to their respective saints, including the Hermitage of São Vicente, the Hermitage of Santa Ana, the chapel of Santo António da Furna, the Church of Santo António and the Império of the Divine Holy Spirit of Santo António, which all characterize the history of their localities.

==Geography==
Santo António is one of the northern parishes of the municipality of São Roque do Pico; the administrative division, in the form of a trapezoid extends from the northern coast into the interior, partially dividing the mountain of Pico with its neighbours. It contains the localities Almas, Areal, Ginjal, Santana and São Vicente.

Also in the civil parish is the &quot;Vigia da Baleia&quot; (a whalewatching outpost) situated at the top of the &quot;Cabeço da Vigia&quot; in Santana, which was constructed in the 20th century. Used originally for spotting whales transiting the region&#x27;s waters, the outpost was part of the signaling system for hunting whales. Today it is an important local viewpoint, providing views of the coastal landscape and horizon. A simple rectangular structure, the structure is formed from reinforced concrete and the site accessible by pedestrian trail.

The developed human spaces includes the &quot;Jardim das Furnas&quot; (&quot;Furnas Garden&quot;), that includes children&#x27;s playground and campsite. In addition, the coastal geomorphology has been responsible for the formation of inlets and coves that support maritime activities, that include the &quot;Piscinas Naturais da Furna de Santo António&quot; (&quot;Natural Pools of Furna de Santo António&quot;), a swimming area hewed from the crags and volcanic rocks of the northern coast.

<text>Sir William Tresham JP (1404 – 22 September 1450) was an English lawyer who served as Speaker of the House of Commons until 1450.

Born in Northamptonshire, the son of Thomas Tresham of Sywell, he went on to become a major landowner in the region. He was elected as a Knight of the shire for the parliament of 1423, and again in 1427, 1429, 1432, 1433, 1435, 1439, 1442, 1445, 1447 and February and November 1449, serving in twelve successive parliaments overall. In 1424 he was also appointed a Justice of the Peace for Northamptonshire; a man born of common stock relied on advancement in his home county for advancement nationally. Having trained as a lawyer, Tresham spent intermittent periods in the service of the king, such as in 1415, when he reviewed the accounts of the King&#x27;s officials in southern Wales.

It is assumed he concentrated on his legal career in the 1420s, where there are few records of his activities, but in 1430 he was appointed as a councillor to Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and continued to receive a salary until at least 1447. In 1432 he was made one of the two Attorneys-general of Henry Beaufort, and spent much of the 1430s on various commissions of the crown, including one to Northamptonshire in 1434 to investigate the hiding of royal funds, and another in 1439 to look at the value of royal lands, again in Northamptonshire. He was employed by the royal household as an apprentice-at-law and thus secured a tie with them; this is likely why he was elected Speaker of the House of Commons for the 1439 Parliament, when there were attempts to reform the King&#x27;s household. In 1438 he bought Rushton Hall in Northamptonshire as a family seat.

He was again elected Speaker in 1442 and 1447 and continued his royal service, mainly for the Duchy of Lancaster, and worked as an Apprentice-at-law between 1444 and 1447. He was made a feoffee of the duchy estates in 1446 and in 1448 was made a chancellor of those feoffees, followed by an appointment as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on 3 July 1442.

He was much-liked at court, and as a result was appointed to politically sensitive cases, such as the 1444 commission to investigate charges of treason against Thomas Carver, and a 1447 commission directed at members of the household of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. In 1450 he was himself indicted for treason in the aftermath of Jack Cade&#x27;s rebellion in Kent, but before any sort of commission could take place he was murdered. While travelling to meet with Richard of York with his son, Sir Thomas Tresham, the pair were assaulted by a group of local men with whom Tresham was in a property dispute. William was killed, and Thomas escaped injured.

Operating through its local chapters nationwide, Thrivent and its subsidiaries offer financial products and services including life insurance, annuities, mutual funds, disability income insurance, credit union products, money management, brokerage services, and retirement planning.

The organization and its members provide volunteer services to charitable organizations and schools. For example, Thrivent members reportedly volunteered more than 8.6 million hours in 2013 and contributed $182.7 million in that year to organizations and activities that aim to strengthen families and communities.

In June 2013, members voted to allow non-Lutheran Christians to join, and as a result in March 2014 the marketing name for Thrivent Financial for Lutherans was shortened to Thrivent Financial. In the summer of 2020, the marketing name was changed to Thrivent.

==Predecessor groups==
Thrivent Financial was officially formed on January 1, 2002, with the merger of Aid Association for Lutherans (AAL) and Lutheran Brotherhood (LB), which had been established in 1902 and 1917 respectively. The merger formed the largest fraternal benefit society in the United States.

===Aid Association for Lutherans===

====History====
In the late 19th and early 20th century, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod forbade its members to join fraternal societies because they required initiation rites and secret oaths. Life insurance was also frowned upon in some quarters since Martin Luther had written against similar enterprises in his day, as the practice could be considered a form of usury and reflected distrust in God.

In 1899, Albert Voecks, a member of St. Paul Lutheran Church in Appleton, Wisconsin, broached the idea of creating an insurance society for Lutherans to fellow church members Gottlieb Ziegler and William Zuehlke. They each gave $13 to the fund, and found several hundred others willing to contribute $5 each. In 1902, the founders of the society recruited the 500 applicants necessary to receive a charter from the State of Wisconsin for their group. It was chartered on November 24, 1902, as the Aid Association for Lutherans in Wisconsin and Other States.

Like most fraternal benefit societies of the time, the AAL operated on the actuarially unsound graded assessment system. In 1905, it began a move to the legal reserve system, a transformation that was completed in 1911. Women were also admitted as members in 1905. Most of the early business was conducted in German, until this was discontinued in 1927.

Membership was open only to members of the Missouri Synod and other Lutherans who were in fellowship with it until the mid-1960s, when it became open to Lutherans of all denominations. In the late 1960s, the association had 792,000 members, which increased to about 1.2 million members in 5,019 branches in 1978. By 1979, it was the largest member of the National Fraternal Congress of America and ranked 13th among the 1,800 insurance firms in the country.

====Rituals====
Neither AAL, Lutheran Brotherhood, nor Thrivent Financial for Lutherans has (or had) initiation rites, oaths or other rituals.

==== Nonprofit organization====
The association was organized on two levels: the local branches attached to Lutheran congregations and the national level, which consisted only of a board of directors that met four times a year. The AAL was particular about its locals &quot;not&quot; being called &quot;lodges&quot; because that was too similar to the nomenclature of oath-bound, ritualistic groups such as the Freemasons or the Oddfellows. The AAL was headquartered in Appleton, Wisconsin.

====Philanthropy====
The AAL was also involved philanthropically, giving money to scholarships, support for educational institutions and training for church workers. Grants were made to agencies, boards, minorities, and homes for the aged and disabled. The association also had its own family health program and sponsored blood drives and family health workshops. It joined the National Center for Voluntary Action.

===Lutheran Brotherhood===
====History====
The Lutheran Brotherhood dates to the founding convention of the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America, when J. A. O. Preus, Minnesota&#x27;s state insurance commissioner, proposed launching a not-for-profit aid society. As with other Lutheran denominations, this move proved controversial, with some saying it indicated lack of faith in God. Those who favored the society prevailed by arguing that the aid society would prevent Norwegian Lutherans from joining unacceptable secret beneficial societies or &quot;lodges&quot;, which was forbidden by conservative Lutheran doctrine.

The organization authorized by the convention was called the Luther Union, and was incorporated in the state of Minnesota on September 18, 1918. That month, the Luther Union entered into negotiations with Lutheran Brotherhood of America of Des Moines, Iowa. These two organizations merged in the Lutheran Brotherhood in 1920.

The articles of incorporation of Lutheran Brotherhood stated its purpose:To aid the Lutheran Church in extending the Lutheran Faith, to foster patriotism, loyalty, justice, charity and benevolence, to provide education, instruction, proper entertainment and amusements, to encourage industry, saving, thrift and development on the part of its members, to give aid in the case of poverty, sickness, accident or old age, and otherwise promote the spiritual, intellectual and physical welfare of its members.Membership was open only to Lutherans. There were 550,000 members in 1965 and 900,000 in 1979.

====Non-profit organization====
Local units were called &quot;branches&quot;, and were divided into three categories: A-1, affiliated to Lutheran congregations; A-2, usually sponsored by a group within a Lutheran parish; and A-3, geographic branches. The Lutheran Brotherhood had a quadrennial convention and a board of directors who managed its business. It was headquartered in Minneapolis.

====Philanthropy====
The LB helped establish new Lutheran congregations through the Church Extension Fund, sponsored scholarships for Lutheran clergy, and arranged seminars on Christian topics.

===Mergers===
====Lutheran Life Insurance Society of Canada====
In 1972, the Canadian branches of the Lutheran Brotherhood and the Aid Association for Lutherans merged as a result of the desire for an indigenous Canadian fraternal benefit society. They formed a new fraternal order called the Faith Life. Like the AAL and LB, the LLISC was organized into branches and run by a board of directors. There were 120 branches in 1979. The society was based in Kitchener, Ontario. The LLISC provided scholarships to Lutheran educational institutions, gave grants to churches and church-related organizations and projects, and gave reduced-rate mortgages for Lutheran churches.

====Thrivent Financial for Lutherans====
The AAL and LB functioned independently throughout the 20th century. In June 2001, after close consideration of how combining the two organizations would benefit members, the AAL and LB merged, with the merger completed by the end of that year. After the merger, in 2002, a new name was voted upon and approved by the members of the merged organization: Thrivent Financial for Lutherans.

==Financial services==
Thrivent provides advice center products.

==Financial standing==
In 2016, Thrivent Financial ranked 318 on the Fortune 500 and received an A.M. Best rating of AA+ (Superior) and a Fitch rating of AA+ (Very Strong).

==Outreach==
Thrivent members made donations to Haiti relief following the 2010 Haiti earthquake through Lutheran World Relief, ELCA Domestic Disaster Response, LCMS World Relief/Human Care, and WELS Committee on Relief. Thrivent Financial provided funding for the 2003 film &quot;Luther&quot;.

===Thrivent Choice===
Through its Thrivent Choice program, members gave 43 million dollars in 2016. The program offers members the opportunity to make recommendations for where some of Thrivent&#x27;s charitable outreach funds are directed. The list of charities comes from members and non-profits can apply to be eligible for choice dollars.

===Thrivent builds with Habitat for Humanity===
Thrivent has formed an alliance with Habitat for Humanity called Thrivent Builds with Habitat for Humanity through which it contributes financial assistance for building affordable homes. The initiative also sponsors homebuilding trips by Thrivent members throughout the world.

The Thrivent Builds alliance began in September 2005, with a four-year commitment of $105 million. Thrivent Financial chose Habitat for Humanity as an ally because, in the previous ten years, its members had already proven their interest in volunteering with them by building over 500 homes. In December 2007, Thrivent Financial increased its total commitment to $125 million. The alliance makes Thrivent Financial one of Habitat&#x27;s largest single allies and aims to increase Habitat&#x27;s annual house production by hundreds of U.S. homes per year and more around the world.

====Programs====
There are two programs within the Thrivent Builds alliance.

*Through Thrivent Builds Homes, Thrivent Financial and other Lutheran volunteers help build more than 300 homes a year within the United States with more than 200 Habitat for Humanity affiliates. By year-end 2008, over 1,000 homes had been built with Habitat for Humanity families through this program.
*Thrivent Builds Worldwide offers Thrivent Financial members the opportunity to volunteer for one- to three-week homebuilding trips around the world where there are existing Habitat for Humanity programs. Thrivent Builds volunteers have helped build Habitat homes in Romania, Poland, South Africa, New Zealand, Guatemala, El Salvador, the Mississippi Gulf Coast and many more destinations.

Additionally, there are two whole communities being built:

*In the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Thrivent Builds is sponsoring a community of 28 homes with families displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
*An additional community of 75 homes is being sponsored in Santa Ana, El Salvador, with 40 teams of Thrivent volunteers helping to build in 2009.

===Library===
Aid Association for Lutherans maintained a library of over 12,000 books on business management, fraternalism, and life and health insurance.

==Recognition==
Since 2012, Thrivent has been named on the list of The World&#x27;s Most Ethical Companies, eight years running, by &quot;Ethisphere Magazine&quot;. Assessment is based upon the Ethisphere Institute&#x27;s Ethics Quotient (EQ) framework which offers a quantitative way to assess a company&#x27;s performance in an objective, consistent and standardized way. Scores are generated in five key categories: ethics and compliance program (35%), corporate citizenship and responsibility (20%), culture of ethics (20%), governance (15%) and leadership, innovation and reputation (10%), and provided to all companies who participate in the process.

==Private prison controversy==
Thrivent has been the subject of awareness campaigns by migrant rights groups and other activists for its holdings in CoreCivic and the GEO Group, the two largest U.S. Government immigration detention contractors, whose assets include detention facilities at the U.S.-Mexico border. In its first quarter 2019 SEC filings, Thrivent reported 87,038 shares of CoreCivic, Inc—currently valued at over $1.5 million—and 142,432 shares of GEO Group—currently valued at just under $2.5 million. Banks such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and others have divested from these companies after calls from migrant rights groups.

<doc id="1216853" wikidata="Q1281957" url="?curid=1216853" title="Eclipse Comics">
<text>Eclipse Comics was an American comic book publisher, one of several independent publishers during the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1978, it published the first graphic novel intended for the newly created comic book specialty store market. It was one of the first to offer royalties and creator ownership of rights.

Creators whose early work appears in Eclipse publications included Scott McCloud, Timothy Truman, Dan Brereton, James Hudnall and Chris Ware, while the publisher also produced creator-owned work by Don McGregor, Mark Evanier, Gene Colan, Alan Moore, Steve Englehart, Steve Gerber and P. Craig Russell.

==History==
===Foundation===
The company was founded as Eclipse Enterprises by brothers Jan and Dean Mullaney – the sons of early electronica musician Dave Mullaney of the band Hot Butter – in April 1977. Dean Mullaney later claimed that he was inspired to create the company after learning of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster&#x27;s struggles to gain recognition for creating Superman in 1968, and that this led him to create a company with an ethos that respected creator ownership and royalty payments over the then-standard industry practice of work-for-hire. Jan Mullaney, a session keyboardist who had toured with the Bee Gees and Bad Company, put up the $2000 starting money.

The name was thought up by Sue Pollina, a friend of the Mullaneys, while the company&#x27;s first logo was designed by Mark Gruenwald. The company was initially headquartered at 81 Delaware Street, Staten Island, New York.

====Early graphic novels====
Eclipse published one of the first original graphic novels, and the first to be sold through the new &quot;direct market&quot; of comic-book stores, &quot;Sabre: Slow Fade of an Endangered Species&quot; by Don McGregor and Paul Gulacy. Published on 30 September 1978 and previewed in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, the book was a success. This led to the Mullaneys being contacted by P. Craig Russell, McGregor&#x27;s collaborator on Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot;. Eclipse published Russell&#x27;s experimental &quot;Night Music 1&quot; in November 1979, by which time the company had also released a compilation of Fred Hembeck&#x27;s parody &quot;Dateline: @!!?#&quot; strips from &quot;The Buyer&#x27;s Guide to Comics Fandom&quot;. Russell later created comic adaptations of numerous operas for Eclipse. A more sophisticated logo was also commissioned from Tom Orzechowski; it remained the company&#x27;s insignia for the rest of its existence, minor alterations aside. The profits earned to date were used to fund publication of McGregor&#x27;s &quot;Detectives, Inc.: A Remembrance of Threatening Green&quot; (with artist Marshall Rogers) and Steve Gerber&#x27;s &quot;Stewart the Rat&quot;. In 1980, Mullaney moonlighted as co-editor of the brand-new hobbyist publication &quot;Comics Feature&quot;, produced by Hal Schuster&#x27;s New Media Publishing, but left after a year to focus on Eclipse.

====Ongoing titles====
Not wanting to limit the company to graphic novels alone, the brothers devised &quot;Eclipse, the Magazine&quot;, a 68-page bi-monthly black-and-white anthology title with a rotating group of creator-owned characters. The first issue, dated May 1981, introduced the hard-boiled female detective Ms. Tree by Max Allan Collins and Steve Ditko&#x27;s &quot;Static&quot;. The title later introduced Steve Englehart&#x27;s &quot;Coyote&quot;, Trina Robbins&#x27; adaptation of Sax Rohmer&#x27;s &quot;Dope&quot;, McGregor and Colan&#x27;s &quot;Ragamuffins&quot; (which Mullaney later described as &quot;perhaps the finest thing we ever published&quot;) and B.C. Boyer&#x27;s &quot;Masked Man&quot;. October 1981 saw the publication of Jim Starlin&#x27;s Dreadstar graphic novel &quot;The Price&quot; when the writer-artist was having contractual issues with Marvel. The success of the volume enabled Starlin to leverage a better deal with Marvel, and led to the creation of Marvel&#x27;s Epic Comics imprint in 1982. Dean Mullaney later claimed Epic&#x27;s name was purposefully picked to cause confusion with Eclipse. Another disgruntled Marvel creator to work for Eclipse was Gerber; Eclipse commissioned his &quot;Destroyer Duck&quot; series. Another anthology, it was partly motivated to allow Gerber to raise funds to sue Marvel over the ownership of Howard the Duck. The first issue of &quot;Destroyer Duck&quot; sold 80,000 copies and proved to the Mullaneys that colour ongoing comics were viable; a &quot;Saber&quot; series started in 1982 and ran for 14 issues.

In December 1981 production of &quot;Destroyer Duck&quot; introduced Dean Mullaney to Cat Yronwode, then news reporter for &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;. At the time, Yronwode was working as an archivist for Will Eisner. Yronwode recalled that Eisner and his wife Ann &quot;hosted a party for me with all these comic book men I was flirting with. All these men came up; they all wanted to meet Will. One of them was Dean Mullaney, the co-owner of Eclipse Comics, a small independent publishing house. He was the most flirtatious.&quot; The pair began a personal and professional relationship, though the former aspect was initially kept private. Yronwode rapidly became Eclipse&#x27;s de facto editor-in-chief.

===Expansion===

While Jan Mullaney remained based in New York to handle the economic side of the business, Dean Mullaney focused on the role of publisher and Yronwode that of editor-in-chief for Eclipse&#x27;s growing number of titles, and the pair briefly relocated to Columbia, Missouri. After meeting Mark Evanier and Will Meugniot Eclipse published their first superhero regular series, &quot;The DNAgents&quot;. It was joined by &quot;Eclipse Monthly&quot;, a colour successor to &quot;Eclipse, the Magazine&quot; that continued &quot;Static&quot;, &quot;Dope&quot; and &quot;Masked Man&quot; as well as introducing further characters. &quot;Ms. Tree&quot; was spun off into its own title, while Yronwode rediscovered Will Eisner&#x27;s lost 1948 story &quot;John Law&quot;, which was published for the first time. After the stopover in Missouri, Dean Mullaney and Yronwode established Eclipse&#x27;s main offices in the small town of Guerneville in July 1983. In October 1984 Jan Mullaney opted to discontinue his involvement in order to focus on his music career, leaving his brother as sole publisher and Yronwode officially promoted to editor-in-chief. Eclipse&#x27;s advertising copy flagged their stance on creator ownership, the maturity of the material and the individuality of the output

Increased output included Scott McCloud&#x27;s &quot;Zot!&quot; (which the writer-artist originally submitted through the mail) and Doug Moench&#x27;s &quot;Aztec Ace&quot;. Yronwode effectively became the face of the company, continuing to write her influential &quot;Fit to Print&quot; comic in &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; and from late 1984 penning the &quot;Penumbra&quot; column printed in most Eclipse titles; it had previously been named &quot;Notes from Surf City&quot; in reference to the 1963 Jan and Dean song, an in-joke between the similarly named Mullaney brothers. During this time her name was professionally rendered as &quot;cat ⊕ yronwode&quot; in &quot;CBG&quot; and Eclipse material, though other publishers were less exhaustive. The comic market experienced a downturn in 1984 due to a crowded market but Eclipse were successful enough to weather it; when rival Pacific Comics folded, Mullaney was able to arrange purchasing their titles. This included Dave Stevens&#x27; &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;, &quot;Mr. Monster&quot; and &quot;Somerset Holmes&quot;, as well as a recently signed deal for the American rights to Quality Communications&#x27; acclaimed British anthology &quot;Warrior&quot;. They also set up the Independent Comics Group to publish two issues of the anthology &quot;Twisted Tales&quot;, while Fred Burke also joined the company in 1984. Burke subsequently edited and wrote numerous titles for Eclipse.

The inherited deal with Quality was fortuitously timed; Alan Moore had recently taken over writing &quot;Saga of the Swamp Thing&quot; for DC Comics, triggering the so-called British invasion. The &quot;Warrior&quot; deal brought in &quot;Axel Pressbutton&quot; and &quot;The Spiral Path&quot;, which were coloured by Eclipse and printed in limited series, as well as taking over Peter Milligan&#x27;s &quot;Strange Days&quot; anthology, starring Johnny Nemo. The deal also included the acclaimed revival of &quot;Marvelman&quot; written by Moore, though legal issues – resulting in the book being retitled &quot;Miracleman&quot; – had to be resolved before Eclipse could run the title. &quot;Miracleman&quot; was originally one of three 75¢ books launched by Eclipse (along with &quot;The New Wave&quot; and the new-material &quot;Laser Eraser and Pressbutton&quot;) as part of a short-lived deal with a Finnish printer at the time they were the cheapest direct market full colour comics ever made. However, the results of the printing were severely lacking and the price soon became unviable, with Eclipse reverting the books to their standard 95¢ bracket after the initial printing contract expired. After the &quot;Warrior&quot; material ran out Moore continued the series at Eclipse. Other new additions around this time were Timothy Truman&#x27;s &quot;Scout&quot;, Larry Marder&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the Beanworld&quot; and &quot;Adolescent Radioactive Black Belt Hamsters&quot;, Don Chin&#x27;s spoof of the already-parodic &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, while Russell continued his adaptations with comic versions of the operas &quot;Salome&quot; and &quot;Pelleas and Melisandre&quot; under the &quot;Night Music&quot; banner. Eclipse also produced a series of Murray Ward&#x27;s indexes to various DC titles, continuing from his deal with Pacific; to avoid the complication of Eclipse&#x27;s logo appearing on books featuring another publisher&#x27;s intellectual property, these were published via a sub-label named the Independent Comic Group.

Eclipse attempted to innovate with new publishing models for comics. Among these were so-called &quot;micro-series&quot;, limited series of two bi-weekly or even weekly issues; a line of 3-D stereoscopy books in collaboration with Ray Zone (including the official adaptation of Disney Michael Jackson vehicle &quot;Captain EO&quot;) and – later – flexi disc records containing theme songs for titles. By this point, Eclipse was selling around half a million comics a month, and was the third largest comics publisher after Marvel Comics and DC Comics.

====Flooding====
Eclipse suffered a major setback on February 14, 1986, when the Russian River flooded after heavy rainfall. Eclipse&#x27;s offices were swamped; the water reached the second floor of their building, as well as Mullaney and Yronwode&#x27;s homes. Mullaney recalled that Yronwode had to be rescued from her office by a Red Cross canoe; while he was able to save much of the original artwork in the offices by moving it up to the third floor It destroyed the company&#x27;s inventory of back issues, as well as colour separations for planned reprints of &quot;Zot!&quot; and Yronwode&#x27;s notes for a non-fiction book about Steve Ditko. The subject was covered in &quot;Fit to Print&quot; and &quot;Penumbra&quot; columns. The events were alluded to in a tongue-in-cheek framing sequence Yronwode wrote for &quot;Miracleman&quot; #8. The damage caused was estimated at $200,000.

Despite the material and financial losses, in July 1986 the company launched its first regular bi-weekly title, &quot;Airboy&quot;. A revival of a defunct Golden Age aviator hero originally published by Hillman Periodicals between 1942 and 1953, the series was written by the prolific Chuck Dixon. The title initially had another unusual format, being a 16-page 50¢ full-colour title initially. While this was eventually dropped, &quot;Airboy&quot; was a critical and commercial success for Eclipse, and several spin-off titles followed. Superhero series &quot;The New Wave&quot; also launched using the bi-weekly model before becoming a standard monthly. To deal with the increasing output both Burke and Letita Glozer (Yronwode&#x27;s half-sister) were added to the full-time editorial staff, while Beau Smith joined as Sales Manager.

To avoid further flooding the company also relocated to Forestville in Sonoma County, California. In July 1987, Yronwode used her &quot;Fit to Print&quot; column to announce her forthcoming marriage to Dean Mullaney, set to take place on August 15 in Forestville; readers were encouraged to write in to receive invitations.

=== Political comics and trading cards ===
In the period 1987–1993, Eclipse became involved with a selection of comics and trading cards on real-world political topics. The early political comics were the results of partnerships with activist groups like Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors, Citizen Soldier, and the Christic Institute.

In 1987, the company published the antiwar comic &quot;Real War Stories&quot; #1, edited by Joyce Brabner, with work by Mike W. Barr, Steve Bissette, Brian Bolland, Paul Mavrides, Dean Motter, Denny O&#x27;Neil and John Totleben (among others). In 1991, Eclipse published &quot;Real War Stories&quot; #2, the final issue of the series.

In 1988 Eclipse had become the first comics company to produce trading cards with the &quot;Iran-Contra Scandal&quot; Trading Cards, with text written by Paul Brancato and featuring art by Salim Yaqub. 

In 1989, Eclipse co-published (with Warner Books) the graphic novel flip book &quot;Brought to Light&quot;. The comic, by writers Alan Moore and Joyce Brabner and artist Bill Sienkiewicz, dealt in part with the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s involvement in the Iran–Contra affair.

The commercial success of the Iran-Contra Scandal trading cards set led to similar sets on other deliberately provocative subjects – gaining Eclipse considerable mainstream publicity in the process. These included:
*&quot;Friendly Dictators Trading Cards&quot; in 1989 by Dennis Bernstein, Laura Sydell and Bill Sienkiewicz.
*&quot;Bush League Trading Cards&quot; in 1990 by Brancato and Yaqub.
*&quot;Savings &amp; Loan Scandal Trading Cards&quot; in 1991 by Bernstein, Sydell and Stewart Stanyard.
*&quot;Coup D&#x27;Etat – The Assassination of John F. Kennedy Trading Cards&quot; in 1991, by Brancato and Sienkiewicz. These benefitted from an increased interest in conspiracy theories about the killing due to Oliver Stone&#x27;s film &quot;JFK&quot; bringing it to a wider audience.
*&quot;Crime and Punishment Trading Cards&quot; in 1992 by Bruce Carroll and Bill Lignante, featuring excerpts from famous criminal cases such as Sirhan Sirhan and Squeaky Fromme; Lignante was a former courtroom sketch artist.
*&quot;AIDS Awareness Trading Cards&quot; in 1993, which sought to provide a greater awareness of the effects and history of the disease; the set was packaged with a condom and mixed information about the disease with images of both everyday and celebrity victims (including Freddie Mercury, Liberace and Rudolf Nureyev, as well as including a theory that AIDS had been &quot;developed by teams of American and Soviet bio-warfare technicians and tested on people in Africa and Haiti before being introduced to North America&#x27;s homosexual population&quot;

Less sensational trading card sets included &quot;The Comedy Channel presents the Rock Bottom Awards&quot; by Peggy Gordon and Sienkiewicz; this was a more light-hearted set that mixed political and celebrity targets; as well as cards on baseball bloopers, James Bond, country music, and &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Loaded Weapon&quot;.

The company&#x27;s 1992 trading card set, &quot;True Crime&quot; by Max Allan Collins, George Hagenauer, Paul Lee, Valarie Jones, Peggy Collier and Jon Bright, covering both mafia and gang figures such as Al Capone and Hymie Weiss to more recent mass killers such as John Wayne Gacy and Jeffrey Dahmer, drew considerable controversy after an Eclipse press release was picked up by &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, leading to accusations of sensationalism. The series was also lambasted on &quot;The Today Show&quot; and &quot;The Maury Povich Show&quot;, while Michigan senators put forward a resolution to ban the cards before they had even been released, while legislators in Maryland and Arkansas made similar moves. Reporting on the issue, comics industry magazine &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; noted that Shel-Tone Publications&#x27; similar &quot;Bloody Visions&quot; set had attracted no such censure when released previously. Yronwode later claimed Eclipse received around 10,000 items of hate mail, and wrote about the controversy when the cards were collected as a pair of albums, &quot;True Crime Vol 1 – G-Men &amp; Gangsters&quot; and &quot;True Crime Vol 2 – Serial Killers &amp; Mass Murderers&quot; in 1993.

Following the success of the True Crime trading cards, in 1993 Eclipse published the two-issue series &quot;True Crime Comics&quot; as well as the &quot;True Crime Comics Special&quot;.

===Setbacks===
Eclipse&#x27;s creator-owned ethos had commercial flaws; as the company owned few of its properties it was dependent on its freelancing creators to keep popular titles going as fill-in issues and spin-offs had to be cleared with the creators, who also had the rights to take their work to other publishers when contracts expired. After losing his lawsuit over &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;, Gerber wound down &quot;Destroyer Duck&quot; to return to his former employers Marvel as a freelancer; &quot;Aztec Ace&quot; was cancelled due to the inability to find satisfactory artists; Scott McCloud&#x27;s work on the Creator&#x27;s Bill of Rights caused delays on the award-winning &quot;Zot!&quot;; Dave Stevens struck a deal with to serialise new &quot;Rocketeer&quot; material; &quot;DNAgents&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Crossfire&quot; were abandoned when Mark Evanier took on work for DC Comics; Ty Templeton abandoned &quot;Stig&#x27;s Inferno&quot; soon after transferring it to Eclipse when he received offers to work on &quot;Booster Gold&quot;; and &quot;Miracleman&quot; slowed to a point where the bi-monthly title shipped three issues between April 1988 and December 1989 due to artist John Totleben&#x27;s health issues.

While &quot;Airboy&quot; and &quot;Scout&quot; remained solid sellers for the company further attempts to expand into superhero comics, such as &quot;The New Wave&quot;, Kurt Busiek&#x27;s &quot;The Liberty Project&quot;, Tim Truman&#x27;s &quot;The Prowler&quot; and Chuck Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Strike!&quot; encountered little long-term success. Between 1987 and 1988 Eclipse&#x27;s share of the market fell from around 8% to 3.6% (also falling behind First Comics. The successful emergence of Dark Horse Comics (who also took on &quot;Mr. Monster&quot;) further ate into Eclipse&#x27;s share. The company began to explore non-fiction; Yronwode and Robbins co-wrote &quot;Women and the Comics&quot;, a volume on the history of female comic strip and comic book creators. As the first book on this subject, its publication was covered in the mainstream press in addition to the fan press.

===Eclipse International===
Attempting to diversify, in 1988 the company created a new division, Eclipse International, to publish material from overseas. One source was Japan, where manga was produced in prodigious amounts; the success of imported anime such as &quot;Robotech&quot; and &quot;Voltron&quot; had showed a large potential market for such subject matter. A deal was struck with Shogakukan&#x27;s subsidiary Viz Communication for some of their titles, which were translated and modified for the American market by Toren Smith&#x27;s Studio Proteus. The first titles were &quot;Area 88&quot;, &quot;Kamui&quot; and &quot;Mai, the Psychic Girl&quot;. These were successful and were followed by other similar titles, including &quot;Appleseed&quot;. However, before Eclipse could publish the heavily advertised &quot;Lum * Urusei Yatsura&quot; the title was halted due to &quot;circumstances beyond [either party]&#x27;s control&quot;. In November 1988 Viz chose not to renew their contract with Eclipse, instead setting up their own American publishing wing. Eclipse continued to work with Studio Proteus on other manga imports, including &quot;Dominion&quot; and &quot;The Lost Continent&quot;. The company also commissioned Adam Warren to create an English-language version of &quot;Dirty Pair&quot;.

Alongside this, it partnered with the British independent publisher Acme Press to distribute their comics in the American market. Highlights from the relationship included &quot;Power Comics&quot;, a four-issue superhero title with art by Dave Gibbons and Brian Bolland; &quot;Aces&quot;, a five-issue black-and-white anthology of serialized Jazz Age genre stories which were originally published in Europe; licensed James Bond material in the form of the official adaptation of latest film &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; and three issue mini-series &quot;James Bond: Permission to Die&quot; — the first James Bond comic book storyline not adapted from a previous work — both featuring art from Mike Grell; mini-series &quot;Steed and Mrs. Peel&quot; (based on television show &quot;The Avengers&quot; but renamed to avoid confusion with the highly prominent Marvel Comics series of that name) by Grant Morrison and Ian Gibson; and Eddie Campbell&#x27;s &quot;The Complete Alec&quot;. The collection won the 1991 UK Comic Art Award for Best Graphic Novel Collection. The deal ended in 1992.

===&quot;Total Eclipse&quot;===
As their tenth anniversary approached, Eclipse planned &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;, a company-wide crossover in the style of DC&#x27;s blockbuster &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. Due to most of its characters being creator-owned permission had to be sought from each individually; many acceded. Eclipse put considerable resources into the prestige-format &quot;super series&quot;, including hiring &quot;Crisis&quot; writer Marv Wolfman to script the series and commissioning covers from Bill Sienkiewicz. Despite promotional stunts such as bespoke plastic bags for comics stores, &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; was beset by delays and a commercial and critical failure, nixing any hopes of relaunching the likes of &quot;Strike!&quot; and &quot;The New Wave&quot; on the back of its success. Soon afterwards production problems saw the stalwart &quot;Airboy&quot; put on hiatus after 50 issues, while &quot;Scout&quot; likewise stalled before mooted third series &quot;Scout: Marauder&quot; could begin. At the end of 1989 Eclipse announced they were turning away from mainstream comics to &#x27;special projects&#x27; (including their trading card business).

===Decline and closure===
After the failure of &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;, Eclipse largely discontinued superhero comics bar the ongoing &quot;Zot!&quot; (which ended in 1991) and &quot;Miracleman&quot;. Instead, comics output largely focused on literary adaptations, including J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Anne McCaffrey&#x27;s &quot;Dragonflight&quot; and several Clive Barker works, either as mini-series, one shots or graphic novels. Otherwise the company focused on collected editions, and only occasional titles – such as Truman&#x27;s revisiting of pulp hero &quot;The Spider&quot; or zeitgeist-tapping spoofs such as &quot;X-Farce&quot; (a satire on Rob Liefeld&#x27;s &quot;X-Force&quot;) and &quot;Loco vs. Pulverine&quot; (based on Lobo and Wolverine)--made any impression on sales charts. Several titles, such as a new &quot;Aztec Ace&quot; mini-series and several titles under the Eclipse F/X horror label, were announced but failed to reach publication.

By 1991 Eclipse typically held around 1% of the market and had been definitively overtaken by Malibu, Valiant and Image. Having always done most of their business with comic stores rather than larger retailers, Eclipse were one of many small publishers adversely affected by the post-speculator boom contraction of the direct market, and by a problematic contract with the book publisher HarperCollins.

====Bankruptcy====
Problems were exacerbated when Mullaney and Yronwode underwent a messy divorce during 1993; Yronwode later claimed that Mullaney began behaving erratically and emptying Eclipse accounts. The company was left so low on resources that, despite receiving completed versions of &quot;Miracleman&quot; #25 and spin-off &quot;Miracleman Triumphant&quot; #1, no printer would extend them credit to print the comics. Eclipse&#x27;s last publication was its Spring 1993 catalog, which was a complete bibliography of its publications, and it ceased business in 1994 before finally filing for bankruptcy in 1995.

====Assets====
The company&#x27;s intellectual property rights were later acquired by Todd McFarlane for a total of $25,000. Due to most of the company&#x27;s titles being creator-owned this largely consisted of the &quot;Airboy&quot; characters and trademarks for some of the anthology titles; at the time McFarlane and others involved believed it also included a two-third share in &quot;Miracleman&quot;. Eventually it was discovered that Quality Communications, and thus Eclipse, had never correctly licensed the characters from creator Mick Anglo.

==Controversies==
===Payment of creators===
After their contract with Eclipse ended in 1988, manga translator Toren Smith&#x27;s Studio Proteus signed with Dark Horse. Finding his income suddenly increasing despite similar sales, Smith instigated an audit of Eclipse&#x27;s finances, revealing the keeping of two sets of books to avoid paying the agreed royalties. A large judgement was eventually made against Eclipse, the losses from which were a factor in the company&#x27;s strained finances.

Garry Leach, Dez Skinn, Alan Davis, Neil Gaiman, Mark Buckingham, Dave Stevens and Mike Deodato have all gone on the record to state they were either not paid or not paid correctly for work with Eclipse, while Davis has also stated his work was published without his permission.

===Lawsuits===
In 1992, the convicted serial killer Kenneth Bianchi, one-half of the pair known as the Hillside Stranglers, sued Yronwode for USD$8.5 million for having an image of his face depicted on a trading card; he claimed his face was his trademark. The judge dismissed the case after ruling that, if Bianchi had been using his face as a trademark when he was killing women, he would not have tried to hide it from the police.

Eclipse was also a plaintiff when Nassau County, New York, seized a crime-themed trading card series of theirs under a county ordinance prohibiting sales of certain trading cards to minors. The case, in which Yronwode testified and the American Civil Liberties Union provided Eclipse&#x27;s representation, reached the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. It ruled against the county, overturning the ordinance.

<text>The Puerto Rico campaign was the American military sea and land operation on the island of Puerto Rico during the Spanish–American War. The offensive began on May 12, 1898, when the United States Navy attacked the capital, San Juan. Though the damage inflicted on the city was minimal, the Americans were able to establish a blockade in the city&#x27;s harbor, San Juan Bay. On June 22, the cruiser &quot;Isabel II&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Terror&quot; delivered a Spanish counterattack, but were unable to break the blockade and &quot;Terror&quot; was damaged.

The land offensive began on July 25, when 1,300 infantry soldiers led by Major General Nelson A. Miles disembarked off the coast of Guánica. After controlling the first skirmish, the Americans advanced to Coamo, where they engaged Puerto Rican and Spanish troops in battle. The battle concluded when the allied soldiers retreated after the battle left two dead on their side, and four on the American side. The United States was able to seize control of Fajardo on August 1, but was forced to withdraw on August 5 after a group of 200 Puerto Rican–Spanish soldiers led by Pedro del Pino gained control of the city, while most civilian inhabitants fled to a nearby lighthouse. The Americans encountered larger opposition as they advanced towards the main island&#x27;s interior. They engaged in two crossfires in Guamani River and Coamo, both of which were inconclusive as the allied soldiers retreated. A battle in San Germán concluded in a similar fashion with the Spanish retreating to Lares.

On August 9, 1898, American troops that were pursuing units retreating from Coamo and Asomante encountered heavy resistance in Aibonito and retreated after six of their soldiers were injured. They returned three days later, reinforced with artillery units and attempted a surprise attack. After about an hour of fighting, Spanish artillery batteries had been silenced. American guns advanced some 2,150 yards and set up positions, but soldiers reported seeing Spanish reinforcements nearby and the guns were withdrawn back to the main line. Shortly before the launch of a flanking movement on the Spanish, all military actions in Puerto Rico were suspended on August 13, after U.S. President William McKinley and French ambassador Jules Cambon, acting on behalf of the Spanish government, signed an armistice whereby Spain relinquished its sovereignty over the territories of Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Philippines and Guam.

== Prelude ==
In 1890, Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, a member of the Navy War Board and leading U.S. strategic thinker, wrote a book titled &quot;The Influence of Sea Power upon History&quot; in which he argued for the creation of a large and powerful navy modeled after the Royal Navy. Part of his strategy called for the acquisition of colonies in the Caribbean Sea that would serve as coaling and naval stations, being strategic points of defense upon the construction of an Isthmusian canal.

This idea was not new, since William H. Seward, the former secretary of state under the administrations of various presidents, among them Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant, had stressed that a canal be built either in Honduras, Nicaragua or Panama and that the United States annex the Dominican Republic and purchase Puerto Rico and Cuba. The idea of annexing the Dominican Republic failed to receive the approval of the U.S. Senate and Spain did not accept the 160 million dollars which the U.S. offered for Puerto Rico and Cuba. Mahan made the following statement to the War Department: &quot;Having therefore no foreign establishments either colonial or military, the ships of war of the United States, in war will be like land birds, unable to fly far from their own shores. To provide resting places for them where they can coal and repair, would be one of the first duties of a government proposing to itself the development of the power of the nation at sea.&quot;

Since 1894, the Naval War College had been formulating plans for war with Spain. By 1896, the Office of Naval Intelligence had prepared a plan which included military operations in Puerto Rican waters. Not only was Puerto Rico considered valuable as a naval station, Puerto Rico and Cuba were also abundant in a valuable commercial commodity which the United States lacked: sugar.
On February 15, 1898 USS &quot;Maine&quot; exploded and sank in Havana Harbor, Cuba. According to the Navy&#x27;s leading weapons expert, Philip Alger, the explosion was due to a coal fire igniting a reserve magazine of six tons of gunpowder, much of which was already degrading due to the humid climate. However, the United States forwarded an ultimatum to Spain to withdraw from Cuba following the sinking of &quot;Maine&quot;. In response, Spain broke off diplomatic relations with the United States, and on April 23, 1898, Spain declared war. On April 25, the U.S. Congress declared that a state of war between the United States and Spain had existed since April 20. One of the United States&#x27; principal objectives in the Spanish–American War was to take control of Spanish possessions in the Atlantic—Puerto Rico and Cuba—and their possessions in the Pacific—the Philippines and Guam.

On April 27, U.S. ships, the monitor , and the armored cruisers , and , bombarded the Spanish fortifications at Matanzas Bay in Cuba. By July 16, an armistice was signed at the Arbol de La Paz (a large ceiba tree) in Santiago de Cuba by U.S. and Spanish forces ending hostilities in Cuba and its waters. The United States then directed its undivided military resources to Puerto Rico. Two leaders of the Puerto Rican section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party, Julio J. Henna and Roberto H. Todd, had written to U.S. President McKinley asking that Puerto Rico be included in whatever intervention was planned for Cuba as early as March 10. They even provided the U.S. government with information about the Spanish military presence on the island.

=== Spanish preparations ===
On April 21, 1898, the &quot;Gaceta de Puerto Rico&quot; published a decree signaling martial law for the island, suspending all constitutional rights in the preparation for war.

With the outbreak of war, the Spanish Crown sent the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Puerto Rican provisional battalions to defend Cuba against the Americans, depleting the Puerto Rican troops in the island. The 1st Puerto Rican Provisional Battalion, composed of the Talavera Cavalry and Krupp artillery, was sent to Santiago de Cuba where they battled the American forces in the Battle of San Juan Hill. After the battle, the Puerto Rican battalion suffered a total of 70 casualties which included their dead, wounded, missing and prisoners. The Spanish-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Manuel Macías y Casado, declared martial law, resolving to resist the American forces. He declared: &quot;Providence will not permit that in these countries which were discovered by the Spanish nation the echo of our language should ever cease to be heard, nor that our flag should disappear before the eyes. ... Long live Puerto Rico, always Spanish. Long live Spain.&quot; Macías y Casado hoped that a grant of autonomy would ensure that Puerto Ricans would remain loyal to the Spanish Crown.
=== American preparations ===

On May 24, 1898, in a letter to Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Cabot Lodge wrote, &quot;Porto Rico is not forgotten and we mean to have it&quot;.

The Spanish Crown was unaware that, at the time, the United States had successfully infiltrated the island with a number of spies, among them Henry Howard Whitney, Henry Ward, George Bronson Brea, William Freeman, James Dewel, Frederick Ober and Edwin Emerson, Jr.

According to a story published in &quot;Century&quot; magazine in September 1898, Emerson Jr. was pretending to be a German journalist. He presented himself to the German consul in St. Thomas and asked for the names of Puerto Ricans of German descent whom he could interview. Among the names which the consul gave him were those of the Riefkohl family of the town of Maunabo. Upon his arrival in the town of Maunabo he met 14-year-old Rudolph W. Riefkohl and asked him in German if he had a map of Puerto Rico (Emerson had lost his). Riefkohl answered that he did, however it was decidedly too big for Emerson&#x27;s use. Riefkohl returned home, not knowing that Emerson was a spy, and quickly drew another with a depiction of the major ports and harbors of Puerto Rico. Emerson used the map and it is believed by some that he may have given the map to the U.S. Army commanding general, Nelson A. Miles, influencing Mile&#x27;s decision on the landing points for the invasion of Puerto Rico. A photostatic copy of Riefkohl&#x27;s map was published in the &quot;Century&quot; article.

== Naval campaign in Puerto Rico (May 8–August 13) ==

=== First actions ===
The first engagement between the belligerents occurred on May 8, 1898, when the converted liner captured a Spanish freighter, &quot;Rita&quot;, in San Juan Bay. On May 9, &quot;Yale&quot; fought a brief battle with &quot;Alfonso XIII&quot;, a Spanish auxiliary cruiser, resulting in a Spanish victory. Around this time, Captain Ángel Rivero Méndez was assigned the command of the Spanish forces at the fortress of San Cristóbal in San Juan. On May 10, when &quot;Yale&quot; returned to San Juan Bay, Rivero-Méndez ordered his men to open fire on the steamer with an Ordoñez 15 centimeter cannon, in the first attack against American forces in Puerto Rico during the Spanish–American War. For his actions, Rivero-Mendez was awarded the &quot;Cruz de la Orden de Merito Militar&quot; (the Cross of the Order of the Military Merit) first class.

=== Bombardment of San Juan ===
The Bombardment of San Juan or the First Battle of San Juan (not to be confused with the Battle of San Juan Hill or the Battle for the Río San Juan de Nicaragua) refers to an American naval attack on the fortifications of San Juan, Puerto Rico, during the Spanish–American War. The American naval commanders believed the bulk of the Spanish fleet under Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete was steaming from the Cape Verde Islands to the Antilles and ultimately to Puerto Rico. With this understanding, Rear Admiral William T. Sampson and a squadron of ten American warships, the battleships , , , cruisers and , monitors and , torpedo boat , two unidentified auxiliary cruisers, and an unarmed collier had stood out from Havana at noon on May 2 bound for Puerto Rico. Sampson intended to intercept and destroy the Spanish squadron and then move on to attack secondary shore targets- San Juan&#x27;s castles, forts and batteries. He was unaware that Topete had already eluded them and slipped his squadron into the Bay of Santiago.
On May 12, Sampson&#x27;s squadron arrived at San Juan, finding an empty harbor. Making the best of the situation and as an exercise for his untested gunners, Sampson ordered the bombardment of the city&#x27;s citadels. Captains Ramón Acha Caamaño and José Antonio Iriarte were among those who defended the city, from Castillo San Felipe del Morro. They had three batteries under their command, which were armed with at least three 15 cm Ordóñez cannons. The battle lasted three hours and resulted in the death of Justo Esquivies, the first Puerto Rican soldier to die in the Puerto Rico campaign. Caamaño was awarded the &quot;Cruz de la Orden de Merito Militar&quot; (the Cross of the Order of the Military Merit) first class for his actions.

After causing much damage to the Spanish defenses and receiving minor damage, low on coal and ammunition, Sampson ordered a cease fire and returned to Havana, Cuba, and then on to Key West, Florida, for repairs and supplies.

=== Second Battle of San Juan ===
On June 22, 1898, under the command of Captain Charles Sigsbee arrived at San Juan Bay from Cuba and joined the blockade. Shortly after midday the old Spanish cruiser set off from San Juan to engage &quot;Saint Paul&quot; with support from shore batteries. &quot;Isabel II&quot; opened fire on &quot;Saint Paul&quot; at long range without success in an attempt to break the blockade. , a Spanish destroyer docked in San Juan for repairs, attempted to cover the cruiser&#x27;s escape with a torpedo attack but was thwarted when her rudder was damaged by a direct hit from &quot;Saint Paul&quot;. Losing steerage, &quot;Terror&quot; inadvertently turned broadside, allowing &quot;Saint Paul&quot; to score direct hits near &quot;Terror&quot;″s waterline, disabling one of her engines and causing her to list. &quot;Terror&quot; abandoned the attack and returned to port, followed by &quot;Isabel II&quot;. On June 26, USS &quot;Saint Paul&quot; was relieved by , which continued the blockade of San Juan Bay.

=== Third Battle of San Juan ===
On June 28, 1898, the American auxiliary cruiser fought with a squadron of Spanish warships. This squadron consisted of one cruiser, two gunboats and one blockade runner. During the engagement, SS &quot;Antonio López&quot;, a transoceanic steamer belonging to the Compañía Transatlántica Española carrying a cargo of needed military supplies, was pursued by &quot;Yosemite&quot; until the Spanish freighter ran aground at Ensenada Honda, Puerto Rico, with her valuable cargo. Captain Caamaño was in charge of retrieving the ship&#x27;s cargo and the men under his command quickly removed as much of it as possible. The desperate efforts proved fruitful, and nearly the entire cargo was salvaged from the hulk with only minor articles and a cannon that had fallen overboard during salvage attempts being lost.

On 15 July, the cruiser arrived to relieve &quot;Yosemite&quot;, and then quickly finished off &quot;Antonio Lopez&quot; the next day by firing twenty incendiary shells into the vessel and sinking her. Though &quot;Antonio Lopez&quot; had been sunk, her cargo was successfully delivered and ensured that any American assault on San Juan would be met with stronger resistance. Caamaño was awarded the &quot;Cruz de la Orden de Merito Naval&quot; by the Spanish government.

The residents of San Juan were furious with Captain Rivero-Méndez and blamed him for the destruction wreaked on their city by American bombardments. Nothing came of those recriminations and Captain Rivero-Méndez was ordered to turn over the keys of all the military installations in San Juan to Captain Henry A. Reed of the U.S. Army after the Treaty of Paris of 1898 was signed.

== Land campaign in Puerto Rico (July 25 – August 13) ==

=== Landing in Guánica ===
The Spanish forces expected the Americans to attack the northern region of the island and concentrated their defenses around San Juan and Arecibo. The Spanish government was also aware of a planned landing by the Americans at Fajardo, located on the east coast and had that town fortified. However, the southern and western regions of Puerto Rico were left with little or no defenses at all.

After Cuba was taken, President William McKinley approved the land invasion of Puerto Rico by way of Fajardo, taking into consideration that the Spaniards had fortified San Juan, where they expected the initial attack. A convoy of ships left Tampa, Florida, and on July 21 another convoy, which included USS &quot;Yale&quot;, USS &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, USS &quot;Gloucester&quot; and USS &quot;Dixie&quot;, departed from Guantánamo for a four-day journey to Puerto Rico.

Major General Miles traveled aboard USS &quot;Yale&quot;. While approaching the Mona Passage that separates Puerto Rico from the island of Hispaniola to the east, Miles opted to land his troops in the southern region of the island, choosing Guánica as his landing zone. Miles dispatched patrol boats to notify all other convoys of his decision and to order them to proceed to Guanica. Miles&#x27; decision to change the invasion site was based on his belief that the town of Fajardo would be fortified and he feared that Spanish coastal gun boats would disrupt a landing there.
On July 25, General Miles, 1,300 infantry soldiers of the 3,300 total that were assigned for the initial invasion and a convoy of ships, under the command of naval captain Francis J. Higginson of arrived at Guánica Bay. The following Navy ships and Army troopships were part of the convoy: USS &quot;Yale&quot; with Generals Miles and George A. Garretson embarked, carrying General Guy V. Henry, , , , and the U.S. Army transports &quot;Lampasas&quot;, &quot;Unionist&quot;, &quot;Stillwater&quot; and &quot;Specialist&quot;. Two captured Spanish ships, &quot;Nueces&quot; and &quot;Rita&quot; that had been confiscated by USS &quot;Yale&quot; as war prizes were also used.

In 1898, Guánica was a small barrio within the jurisdiction of the town of Yauco. It had 60 houses in all and its only defense was eleven members of the 4th Volante de Yauco, a Puerto Rican militia unit, under the command of Lieutenant Enrique Méndez López. When the Guánica lighthouse keeper Robustiano Rivera spotted the approaching convoy, he immediately gave the alert to the residents of the barrio. All of the residents, with the exception Agustín Barrenechea, Vicente Ferrer, Juan María Morciglio, Simón Mejil, Salvador Muñoz, Cornelio Serrano and Pascual Elena, who welcomed the invaders, abandoned their homes and joined Rivera on his journey to Yauco where he broke the news of the invading forces to the city&#x27;s mayor.

=== First skirmish ===
&quot;Gloucester&quot; was the first ship to set anchor in the Bay of Guánica. Twenty-eight sailors and marines, under the command of lieutenants H. P. Huse and Wood, departed from the ship on rafts and landed on the beach. The marines lowered the Spanish flag from the beach flagpole and replaced it with the American flag. They then proceeded to set up a machine gun nest and placed barbed wire around their perimeter. The first land skirmish in Puerto Rico between the Puerto Rican militia and the American forces occurred when Lieutenant Méndez López and his men attacked and opened fire on the Americans. During the small battle which followed, the Americans returned fire with their machine gun and &quot;Gloucester&quot; began to bombard the Spanish position. Lieutenant Méndez López and three of his men were wounded and the militia unit was forced to retreat to the town of Yauco.

=== Invasion ===
After the skirmish was over, men from &quot;Lampasas&quot; landed on the beach to secure the area and to build a landing dock. Three thousand and three-hundred American soldiers under the command of General Miles landed. The units that landed were the 6th Volunteer Regiments of Illinois and Massachusetts, an artillery battalion, five battery companies, two engineer companies and a medical unit. The men who had not abandoned the barrio of Guanica swore allegiance to the United States. Garretson named Agustín Barrenechea mayor of Guanica and Simón Mejil the chief of police. On the afternoon of the 25th, Garretson left Guánica with seven companies of the 6th Massachusetts and one company of the 6th Illinois and headed towards Yauco.

Secretary of War Russell A. Alger learned about the landing at Guanica the next day when he read an Associated Press report in a local Washington, D.C., newspaper. The War Department had ordered Miles to invade Puerto Rico by way of San Juan and therefore Alger was completely surprised with the report. Miles would have been subject to disciplinary actions had the invasion not gone so smoothly. Alger received the following cable from Miles three days after the invasion: &quot;Spanish troops are retreating from southern part of Puerto Rico. This is a prosperous and beautiful country. The Army will soon be in mountain region. Weather delightful; troops in the best of health and spirit. Anticipate no insurmountable obstacles in future results. Results thus far have been accomplished without loss of a single life.

=== Battle of Yauco ===

After Rivera, the keeper of the Guánica lighthouse notified Atilio Gaztambide, the mayor of the town of Yauco, located north of Guánica, of the American invasion of Guánica, the mayor in turn notified Governor Macías via telegraph. Governor Macías ordered Captain Salvador Meca and his 3rd Company of the 25th Patria Battalion from Yauco to head for Guánica. Meca and his men were joined by Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Puig, who assumed command of the Spanish forces at Hacienda Desideria from Guánica. Puig arrived with two companies known as &quot;Cazador Patria Battalion&quot;, and they were joined by Puerto Rican volunteers, the civil guards, and mounted guerrillas from the towns of Yauco and Sabana Grande. Puig had the men positioned on both sides of the road that ran from Guánica to the coffee Hacienda Desideria (owned by Antonio Mariani) in Yauco, as well as an infantry company positioned on a hill south of the hacienda.

In the meantime, Garretson set out of Guánica with his men towards Yauco with the intention of capturing the Yauco rail terminus that ran between that town and the city of Ponce, the largest in the southern region of the island. Garretson and his men arrived in the darkness of night and were informed by his scouts of the possibility of a hostile situation at the Hacienda Desideria. He ordered the Illinois company and two companies (companies L and M) of the 6th Massachusetts to occupy a small hill on his right that overlooked the hacienda.
Captain San Pedro detected the movements of the American troops from his positions on a nearby hill and ordered his men to open fire. Garretson then ordered a direct attack on the Spanish and Puerto Rican forces in the hacienda. At day break, the 6th Massachusetts overran the Spanish forces and suffered four casualties. Puig was expecting reinforcements from Yauco which did not arrive and was ordered to disengage and retreat. Before retreating the right wing of the Spanish force, which was not overrun, initiated a flanking attack against two positions held by the Illinois and Massachusetts companies. The unexpected strength of the Spanish force caused some of the 6th Massachusetts troops to momentarily withdraw, but the Spanish forces were eventually driven off. Puig and his forces suffered two officers and three soldiers wounded and two soldiers dead.
Puig and his men retreated towards Yauco, but failed to destroy the rail terminus which connected the town to the city of Ponce, and proceeded to march towards the town of Peñuelas. Garretson&#x27;s troops entered Yauco on the afternoon of July 26 and on July 27 Puig&#x27;s men continued their march, leaving their artillery and heavy equipment behind, passing the towns of Adjuntas and Utuado and finally arriving at the town of Arecibo on the northern coast of the island on July 29. Colonel Puig, believing that he would be dishonored and accused by the Spanish government of abandoning military equipment during his retreat, committed suicide on August 2.

Miles, upon learning about the lack of discipline of the 6th Massachusetts during the battle, ordered an investigation. The 6th Massachusetts was sent on a hard march from Guánica to Ponce as punishment and the regimental commander, a lieutenant colonel, a major, and a captain resigned upon request.

=== Battle of Fajardo ===

On August 1, the monitors , , armed tug , and collier were sailing off the coast of Fajardo on the northeast corner of Puerto Rico, when Captain Frederick W. Rodgers, &quot;Puritan&quot;″s commanding officer and senior officer afloat, spotted the &quot;Faro de Las Cabezas de San Juan&quot; (Cape San Juan Lighthouse) that had been designated the landing site for the US Army&#x27;s invasion of Puerto Rico. Rodgers ordered a reconnaissance landing party ashore, including Puerto Rican volunteers. The sailors advanced to within a of Fajardo, about from the coast, but withdrew when they encountered Spanish troops.

The 25-man Spanish garrison stationed in Fajardo was alerted to the American presence and ordered to withdraw after notifying their superiors in San Juan. When Santiago Veve Calzada, a Fajardan, realized that the garrison was abandoned and his town defenseless against the Americans, he implored the Spanish authorities in San Juan to dispatch troops to defend Fajardo. Losing hope that Spanish troops would come to the town&#x27;s aid, Veve went to the lighthouse to seek protection for the town from the Americans. On the afternoon of August 5, Veve entered Fajardo with a contingent of bluejackets and United States flags were hoisted over the Fajardo Customs House at the harbor and city hall. On the evening of August 6, Captain Charles J. Barclay of &quot;Amphitrite&quot; ordered 28 sailors and 7 officers commanded by Lieutenant Charles N. Atwater and Assistant Engineer David J. Jenkins ashore to relight and occupy the Fajardo Light. They were also ordered to quarter 60 women and children of the town&#x27;s families that were deemed in danger for having sided with the Americans. As the first group of sailors was entering the darkened lighthouse, naval cadet William H. Boardman was mortally wounded when his revolver fell from a faulty holster and discharged into his thigh, cutting the femoral artery. His was one of only two Navy deaths during the Puerto Rico campaign.

On August 4, Governor General Manuel Macías y Casado sent Colonel Pedro del Pino and about 220 troops, including civil guardsmen to recapture the city. When Colonel Pino entered Fajardo on August 7, he found it nearly deserted because the residents, fearing a battle, had fled to the Fajardo Light and the surrounding hills. At close to midnight on August 8, Pino&#x27;s troops began their assault on the lighthouse. The landing party of &quot;Amphitrite&quot;″s sailors occupying the lighthouse doused the light and signaled the ships offshore, initiating shore bombardment as the naval guns began firing a protective pattern. After two hours, the Spanish forces retreated back to the town. The Americans suffered no casualties, despite a close call when a wayward naval shell smashed through the thick walls of the lighthouse within touch of six men but failed to explode. The Spanish losses were two dead and three wounded, including a lieutenant.

Early the next morning, Barclay decided the continued occupation of the lighthouse was of marginal value and ordered his men back to the ship. A landing party of 30 sailors from &quot;Amphitrite&quot; and a similar number of U.S. Marines from under Lieutenant John A. Lejeune came ashore to secure the area while the 60 Fajardan civilians boarded &quot;Leyden&quot; for passage to Ponce and the lighthouse was abandoned to the Spaniards. In Fajardo, Pino&#x27;s men tore down the U.S. flags that flew over the harbor Customs House and City Hall, returning to San Juan after verifying that the lighthouse was abandoned. The contingent of about 20 civil guards that had accompanied Pino, were left to maintain order in the town. The skirmish at Fajardo was the only time that American forces withdrew from a position during the Puerto Rico campaign.

=== Battle of Guayama ===
After the town of Yauco was taken, Miles decided to attack the City of Ponce by sea and by land. Garretson&#x27;s 6th Illinois and 6th Massachusetts had returned to Guanica and after the troops rested, Garretson and his men were ordered to move eastward to Ponce. Lt. Col. Rafael Martinez Illecas, in charge of the Spanish forces in that city, had pulled out, leaving behind a small garrison of 300 volunteers to hold the town. When the American forces arrived in Ponce they met no resistance and the Spanish volunteers surrendered. The American forces were not the only ones who participated in the taking of Ponce. Members of the Puerto Rican Commission, which included the leader of the Intentona de Yauco revolt, Antonio Mattei Lluberas and his group, arrived in Ponce aboard USS &quot;St. Louis&quot; and were assigned to the headquarters of General Miles. From this group Miles organized the &quot;Porto Rican Scouts&quot;, which was later assigned to General Theodore Schwan, under the command of Edwardo Lugo Viñas. Miles then ordered Brigadier General Peter G. Hains and the men of the 3rd Illinois, 4th Ohio and 4th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiments to take Arroyo, a small port east of Ponce that served the larger, nearby coastal town of Guayama. Arroyo was taken on August 2 and on August 5 Hanes ordered the 4th Ohio, the 3rd Illinois and a battery of Sims-Dudley guns, manned by Company G of the 4th Ohio, to capture Guayama.

Spanish forces were entrenched on the crest of two small hills, between which the road from Arroyo to Guayama ran. The Americans had crossed a stream in front of the hills when suddenly the Spanish opened fire. The Americans protected their position by the stream and increased their firepower as more reinforcements arrived. The outnumbered Spanish troops retreated to Guayama as the Americans made their advance on the hills. The firefight, which lasted half an hour, left three American wounded. When the 4th Ohio entered the town they discovered that the Spaniards had fled north and abandoned the city, ending the Battle of Guayama. General John Rutter Brooke used the Cautiño Residence (Casa Cautiño) by the town square in Guayama as his military headquarters.

=== Battle of the Guamaní River Bridge ===
On August 6, Colonel Alonzo B. Coit sent two companies of the 4th Ohio on a reconnaissance mission across and beyond a cast iron bridge that crossed the Río Guamaní (Guamaní River). The road beyond the bridge was essential for General Hains&#x27; projected advance to the town of Cayey. The 4th Ohio observed elements of Spain&#x27;s 6th Provisional Battalion under the command of Julio Cervera Baviera entrenched in Guamaní Heights, six miles north of the bridge. The 4th felt that they were too strongly entrenched to attempt an assault at the time. The 4th Ohio requested reinforcements and on August 9, attacked the Spaniards and a short firefight erupted. The numerical superiority of the Americans forced the Spanish to retreat from Guamaní Heights. This battle was the costliest battle yet for the Americans since their landing at Guánica, as it resulted in seven wounded. The Spanish forces suffered 2 dead and 15 wounded.

=== Battle of Coamo ===
Shortly after the American soldiers disembarked, a group of Spanish and Puerto Rican units began moving from Ponce to Aibonito, marching through the Carretera Central (Central Road). The caravan was composed of two companies of the &quot;Batallón de Cazadores de la Patria&quot; (Battalion of the Motherland&#x27;s Hunters) and some members of the Civil Guard and a Puerto Rican guerilla force. A total of 248 infantry men and 42 members of the cavalry formed the battalions under the command of Lt. Col. Rafael Martínez Illescas, the same commander who was in charge of the Ponce garrison. Traveling by foot, the journey would last two days. The group decided to spend one night in the resort of the town of Coamo known as the Baños de Coamo before continuing their march in the morning. Martínez Illescas immediately ordered the construction of several trenches; while building these, the soldiers were ambushed by an anti-Spanish guerilla force, led by Pedro María Descartes, who managed to kill a member of the Civil Guard.
Meanwhile, two battalions of volunteers from Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, led by Generals Oswald H. Ernst and James H. Wilson, settled on opposite sides of the road to Coamo. On August 9, 1898, the Americans began their offensive, opening cannon fire against the city and completing their attack with artillery fire, the 3rd and 4th Regular Pennsylvania Artillery to provide artillery support for the frontal assault on the Baños, damaging the resort. The Americans intended to encircle and defeat the defenses in the city. A group of soldiers entered the city from the backside, having advanced through a river nearby. The rear assault was reinforced by Wilson&#x27;s army under General Ernst, attempting to trap the allied soldiers in a crossfire, employing a tactic known as the pincer movement. Martínez Illescas was surprised by the attack and led an improvised attack, but he was killed in the crossfire along with his second-in-command, leaving Captain Hita in charge; he ordered his men to surrender. Half of the allied troops ignored the order, and continued the attack, Troop C galloped at top speed north from the Baños de Coamo, after finding the resort abandoned by the Spanish. Hita&#x27;s men were sent to a prisoner-of-war camp located at Río Descalabrado, while the men who continued to attack retreated to Aibonito when they realized that the Americans were using a pincer movement.

=== Battle of Silva Heights ===
Brigadier General Theodore Schwan and 2,896 men of his Independent Brigade had landed in Guanica and marched towards occupied Yauco. Schwan and his men were ordered to move westward and to capture the city of Mayagüez. Colonel Julio Soto Villanueva ordered 1,500 Spanish Regulars of the 24th Rifle Battalion, six companies of the Alfonso XIII auxiliaries, and other scattered Spanish and Puerto Rican guerilla forces dispatched from the garrison at Mayagüez to meet and defeat Schwan. The Spanish forces entrenched themselves at a high ridge called Silva Heights, located at a road near the town of Hormigueros.

Schwan&#x27;s troops arrived in the town of San Germán and continued the march towards their objective. Troop A of Schwan&#x27;s 5th Cavalry approached Silva Heights and were soon engaged in a firefight when the Spanish forces opened fire. The Americans were aided by two companies of the 19th Infantry, supported by artillery and Gatling guns, as well as the 11th Infantry. The Spanish forces retreated after the American reinforcements brought them under intense fire. Schwan&#x27;s men set up camp on Silva Heights for the night and the following day they continued their drive to Mayagüez. They arrived the following morning to find that the Spanish forces had abandoned the city to retreat to the east towards Lares. Schwan decided to send forces in order to follow and capture Soto Villanueva and his forces, as he was additionally ordered to take the town of Las Marías which was in the way of the retreating army&#x27;s path. The outcome of the Silva Heights Battle left 3 Spanish dead, 6 wounded, and 136 prisoners. Schwan&#x27;s brigade suffered 15 wounded and 2 killed in action.

=== Battle of Asomante ===
The American cavalry pursued the soldiers that had retreated from Coamo, but were not able to reach them until the units had entered Aibonito Pass, a region more commonly known as Asomante. The region had been prepared by allied Puerto Rican and Spanish troops, who had built a trench and placed soldiers and equipment around the foliage. As soon as the soldiers noticed the presence of the invading unit they opened cannon fire. The cavalry received infantry reinforcements, which were received by battery fire. Six American soldiers were injured in the crossfire, prompting a retreat order. The allied units (Spanish and Puerto Rican) lost five soldiers and two civil guards. During the following two days the Americans decided to do a battlefield reconnaissance and Colonel Samuel Reber II, developed a croquis of the Aibonito Pass. Spies were deployed throughout Coamo, including a Puerto Rican separatist named Carlos Patterne, who was able to enter the city without suspicion and contact Rufino Huertas, a separatist teacher. Huertas gave Patterne a series of defense plans that were previously developed and organized by Martínez Illescas. While inactive, the Puerto Rican soldiers deployed in Asomante completed rounds every two hours, working four hours daily. They mostly ate beans, some rice and meat, while conserving several cracker packs for Spanish reinforcements that were supposed to arrive. They slept in improvised huts that did not protect them from the rain.

The American commanders decided to attack the trenches with artillery, while sending a large group to Barranquitas, from which they would try to attack the allied troops from the back. At 10:30 a.m. Captain Ramsay D. Potts led part of the 3rd Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment through the central highway to Aibonito. Lieutenants Bliss and O&#x27;Hern led two units with similar equipment. At 1:00 p.m. the allied troops opened cannon fire as the Americans entered their range. Potts ordered the deployment of two batteries while O&#x27;Hern received orders from Commander Landcaster to set a cannon at a distance of a 100 yards to the vanguard&#x27;s right. They intended to defeat a small group led by Captain Hernaíz. Shrapnel from allied cannon fire was falling close to Lancaster&#x27;s location, and he asked Potts to help him by deploying a battery nearby. One of Hernaíz&#x27;s Placensias cannons overheated, which forced him to order a temporary cease to the offensive. Landcaster believed that the opposition had been annihilated, ordered an advance. However, the allied fire was renewed, this time supported by Mauser rifle fire. The sudden attack caused confusion among some soldiers, who reported seeing a second Spanish unit nearby. Fearing that the allied units could capture the American equipment, Landcaster ordered a retreat. Lieutenant Hains was gravely injured by a Mauser bullet, being replaced by Sergeant John Long. Meanwhile, most of Potts&#x27; men fled the battlefield. In the crossfire the allied forces overpowered the American infantry, using Mauser fire to disorganize their artillery, during which time four American officials were gravely injured including Long, Lieutenant Harris, Captain E.T. Lee and Corporal Oscar Sawanson. Private Frederick Yough, Corporal August Yank, George J. Bruce and Private Sices also received injuries, with Yough subsequently dying. Harris&#x27; position was filled by O&#x27;Hern, while Sawanson was fatally shot while trying to support the artillery. In total the allied units had only an injured artillery man, while the American side had two dead and five injured. Wilson&#x27;s camp was the first to receive a telegram from General Miles notifying him that the war had ended. The Americans sent Bliss to Asomante, but Nouvilas refused to suspend the hostilities after receiving a telegram from Macías denying any peace treaty. All military actions in Puerto Rico were supposed to be suspended on August 13, after President William McKinley and French Ambassador Jules Cambon, acting on behalf of the Spanish government, signed an armistice whereby Spain relinquished its sovereignty over the territory of Puerto Rico. However a final engagement took place on the same day.

=== The Guacio Disaster ===
The retreating Mayagüez army marched for the next two days after leaving the city. At 10:30 am on August 11, Soto Villanueva was injured in the leg after falling through a bridge he was trying to cross. He became convinced his leg had been broken and needed to be carried by four men in a hammock for the remainder of the march. The marching army reached Las Marias on the same day. Soto Villanueva then ordered a private meeting at the house of the town Mayor between himself, Lieutenant Colonel Antonio Oses, Lieutenant Colonel Salvador Suau and Lieutenant Rodolfo Olea Mora in which it is decided to make a final stand in the town against the incoming enemy forces. Soto sent a telegram to General Macias informing him of the choice, but as a response received orders to continue the march towards Lares. Feeling incapable of leading the march, Soto once again set up a meeting between himself and the aforementioned officers. During the meeting, Soto ordered the army to leave him and relinquished his command to Lieutenant Colonel Oses. As his first order as commanding officer, Oses followed the Governor&#x27;s command. However, when attempting to leave las Marias the army was halted at 11:00 pm on August 12 by the roaring Guacio River which had grown massive enough as to prevent passage through it. Oses ordered the army to wait until morning to see if the current died down. On August 13 the river currents remained at the same level. In the morning Colonel Suau remembered a crossing at the north of the river and at 9:00 am ordered troops under his command to march north in order to pass through it. At this point the American troops were spotted, beginning the battle. Oses saw victory as unlikely and ordered Lieutenant Olea to launch a barrage of cannon fire at the American troops as his forces attempted to cross the river by force. In the ensuing melee Oses and the majority of the Spanish forces were captured, taken prisoner and forced to march back to Mayagüez. The forces under Colonel Suau found the crossing and retreated from the battle, later successfully arriving in Lares where they learned of the surrender. Schwan, upon receiving news of the prisoners wished to continue the pursuit of the remaining forces, but was halted by news of the surrender. The battle at Las Marías was perceived to have been a colossal military failure by the Spanish and local population, who named it the Guacio Disaster.

== Aftermath ==

=== Treaty of Paris of 1898 ===
The Puerto Rico campaign, which began with &quot;Yales&quot;″s capture of &quot;Rita&quot; on May 8 and ended on December 10, after the Treaty of Paris was signed, was short compared to the other campaigns in the Spanish–American War, because it came to an end before the military objective of the campaign was completed. Among the factors which benefited the invaders in the short campaign was that the Puerto Ricans who resided in the southern and western towns and villages resented Spanish rule and tended to view the Americans as their liberators. The Treaty of Paris came into effect on April 11, 1899, when the documents of ratification were exchanged. Some Puerto Rican leaders such as José de Diego and Eugenio María de Hostos expected the United States to grant the island its independence and in the case of Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón and the committee which he headed, greeted General Miles and the invaders in Ponce with banquets. Believing that Puerto Rico would gain its independence, a group of men staged an uprising in Ciales on August 13, 1898, which became known as &quot;El Levantamiento de Ciales&quot; or the &quot;Ciales Uprising of 1898&quot; and proclaimed Puerto Rico to be a republic. The Spanish authorities who were unaware that the cease fire had been signed brutally suppressed the uprising. Another reason which can explain why the campaign was short and not as violent as the others is that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Puerto Rican provisional battalions were in Cuba defending that island against the American invaders.
The Puerto Rican Battalion suffered a total of 70 casualties which included their dead, wounded, MIAs and prisoners. The Spanish, Puerto Ricans and Americans that participated in the campaign totaled 33,472. Of this total 8,000 were Spanish, 10,000 were Puerto Rican and 15,472 were American military personnel. The Spanish and Puerto Ricans suffered 429 casualties which included 17 dead, 88 wounded and 324 captured. The American forces suffered 43 casualties: 3 dead and 40 wounded. The commander of Spain&#x27;s 6th Provisional Battalion, Julio Cervera Baviera, gained notoriety as the author of a pamphlet called &quot;La defensa de Puerto Rico&quot;, which supported Governor General Manuel Macías y Casado and in an attempt to justify Spain&#x27;s defeat against the United States, blamed the Puerto Rican volunteers in the Spanish Army as the reason behind the fiasco. A group of angry &quot;Sanjuaneros&quot; agreed to challenge Cervera to a duel if the commander did not retract his pamphlet. The men drew lots for this honor; it fell to José Janer y Soler and was seconded by Cayetano Coll y Toste y Leonidas Villalón. Cervera&#x27;s seconds were Colonel Pedro del Pino and Captain Emilio Barrera. The duel never took place, as Cervera explained his intentions in writing the pamphlet, and all parties were satisfied.

Under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898, ratified on April 11, 1899, Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States. Spain had lost its last colony in the Western Hemisphere and the United States gained imperial strength and global presence. The United States established a military government and appointed Miles the first head of the military government established on the island, acting as both head of the army of occupation and administrator of civil affairs. Members of the Spanish forces and civilians who were loyal to the Spanish Crown were allowed to return to Spain. By October 18, the Spanish withdrawal from Puerto Rico was completed as the final troops left San Juan for Spain. Those who belonged to the Spanish military and who decided to stay in Puerto Rico were offered the option by the United States to serve in the newly formed &quot;Porto Rico Regiment&quot;. Some took the offer, such as Teófilo Marxuach, a former lieutenant in the Spanish Army, and others, such as Captain Angel Rivero Méndez, declined the offer and retired from the military.

=== &quot;Americanization&quot; of Puerto Rico ===
From 1898 to 1900, Puerto Rico was governed by four military officers, commanding general Miles, Major General John R. Brooke (1898–1898), Major General Guy Vernon Henry (1898–1899) and Major General George Whitefield Davis (1899–1900). Miles, Brooke and Henry were experienced veterans of the Indian Wars and, even though they were accustomed to the pacification and administration of the Native Americans, the U.S. Army had no previous experience in the administration of overseas territories. Henry stated: &quot;It was an entirely new duty for American Army officers. There was no precedent in the experience of these so suddenly placed in charge of this our first real colony, upon which their policy could be based.&quot;

The administration of Puerto Rico was the responsibility of the United States Department of War&#x27;s Division of Insular Affairs which was modeled after the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Almost immediately, the United States began the &quot;Americanization&quot; process of Puerto Rico. The U.S. occupation brought about a total change in Puerto Rico&#x27;s economy and polity and did not apply democratic principles to the colony. Puerto Rico was classified as an &quot;unincorporated territory&quot; which meant that the protections of the United States Constitution did not automatically apply because the island belonged to the U.S., but was not part of the U.S.

In 1899, U.S. Senator George Frisbie Hoar described Puerto Ricans as &quot;uneducated, simple-minded and harmless people who were only interested in wine, women, music and dancing&quot; and recommended that Spanish should be abolished in the island&#x27;s schools and only English should be taught. Schools became the primary vehicle of Americanization, and initially all classes were taught in English, which also made for a large dropout rate.

On January 15, 1899, the military government changed the name of Puerto Rico to Porto Rico (On May 17, 1932, U.S. Congress changed the name back to &quot;Puerto Rico&quot;) and the island&#x27;s currency was changed from the Puerto Rican peso to the American dollar, integrating the island&#x27;s currency into the U.S. monetary system. The United States exerted its control over the economy of the island by prohibiting Puerto Rico from negotiating commercial treaties with other nations, from determining tariffs, and from shipping goods to the mainland on other than U.S. carriers.

=== Civil disorder ===
A state of civil disorder existed in the island&#x27;s mountainous region after the invasion of the United States. The local Criollo, who now found themselves unemployed and felt that they had been exploited by their former employers, formed bands called &quot;Partidas&quot;. The Partidas at first attacked and robbed many of the wealthy plantation owners, who were loyal to the Spanish Crown, in vengeance, however they later began to attack the businesses owned by the local natives. One of the most notable leaders of the Partidas was José Maldonado Román a.k.a. &#x27;Aguila Blanca&quot;. Maldonado, who operated in the areas of Juana Díaz and Ponce, harassed the Spanish Civil Guard and later did the same to the American forces. Another factor contributing to the state of civil disorder on the island was the lack of discipline of the American troops who were stationed there. These troops were not professional soldiers and were composed of volunteers. Many instances were reported where these men would act disorderly, under the influence of alcohol, and get into fights with the local residents. The state of civil disorder came to a halt on the island after the military government began to rebuild Puerto Rico&#x27;s infrastructure, thereby providing employment for many of the discontented and unemployed population, and when the volunteer troops were replaced by the regular army.

=== End of military rule and rise of the sugar economy ===
Military rule was replaced by a civilian government by way of the Foraker Act of 1900. However, the act stipulated that the governor, chief of police and top officials were presidentially appointed and they were all to be Americans.

In 1901, the first civilian U.S. governor of Puerto Rico, Charles H. Allen, installed himself as president of the largest sugar-refining company in the world, the American Sugar Refining Company. This company was later renamed the Domino Sugar company. In effect, Allen leveraged his governorship of Puerto Rico into a controlling interest over the entire Puerto Rican economy.

=== 54 years after the end of the Puerto Rico campaign ===
In 1947, the U.S. granted Puerto Ricans the right to democratically elect their own governor, which they first exercised in 1948. The Constitution of Puerto Rico was approved by a Constitutional Convention on February 6, 1952, ratified by the U.S. Congress, and approved by President Truman on July 3 of that year. Puerto Rico adopted the name of &quot;Estado Libre Asociado&quot; (literally translated as &quot;Free Associated State&quot;), officially translated into English as Commonwealth, for its body politic.

== Markers, monuments and tombstones ==
In Puerto Rico there are no monuments to commemorate the Spanish–American War as such. There are various markers where some of the historical events took place and some tombstones which honor both the American invaders and the Spanish and Puerto Rican defenders of the island. In the town of Guánica there is a rock on the coastal port with an inscription indicating that Major General Nelson A. Miles and his men landed on that spot. There is also a monument in the town dedicated to the veterans of the Spanish–American War, though the monument does not specify to which veterans it is dedicated, the Americans or the Spanish/Puerto Ricans. In Yauco there is a monument/tombstone dedicated to an unknown Spanish soldier who had fallen in combat and was left there on that very spot. In Coamo there are two markers that indicate where Rafael Martínez Illescas and Frutos López died. López&#x27;s tomb is located in the old cemetery of Coamo next to that of the tomb of the three unknown Puerto Rican soldiers who perished in that conflict. Martínez Illescas&#x27; body was transferred in 1916 to his hometown of Cartagena in Spain, where he is buried. The town of Guayama has a monument dedicated to the members of the 4th Ohio Infantry. In Asomante, there is a marker which indicates the place where the &quot;Battle of Asomante&quot; took place.

<text>Rhodinol is the chemical compound 3,7-dimethyloct-7-en-1-ol. As the (3S) isomer it is CAS 6812-78-8, and as the racemate it is CAS 141-25-3.

In the field of perfumery materials, the term may refer to L-citronellol, to mixtures comprising mostly L- or racemic citronellol and geraniol, or to mixtures comprising mostly racemic 3,7-dimethyloct-7-en-1-ol and racemic citronellol.

Two example synthetic Rhodinol products are Rhodinol 70, a racemic mixture comprising 40–60% 3,7-dimethyloct-7-en-1-ol and 40–60% citronellol, and Sigma-Aldrich Rhodinol, which consists of L-citronellol and geraniol.

Rhodinol is also provided in perfumery in natural grades as materials extracted from geranium or citronella, comprising principally citronellol and geraniol.

Rhodinol products are used in cosmetics and perfumery to impart flowery odors, particularly but not limited to being a component of rosy odor.

3,7-Dimethyloct-7-en-1-ol does not appear substantively in nature.

<text>Lajes do Pico () is a town and municipality in the central Azores. It is one of three municipalities of the island of Pico. It has 4,342 inhabitants as of 2021, in an area of 155.31 km2. It is bordered by Madalena to the west and by São Roque do Pico to the north.

==History==
The first settlement to be established on the southern part of the island of along Penedo Negro, in the cove of Castelete (south of the actual town of Lajes) sometime around 1460. The rough seas at the time only allowed the navigator Fernando Álvares Evangelho to offload at the time, and he and his dog would occupy the land near the ravine (along the western edge of the town) for many years: the ravine of potable water took its name &quot;Ribeira Fernado Álvares&quot; from this early colonist. His former residence still remains near the site. When his colleagues arrived later, they disembarked farther east in the area designated &quot;Santa Cruz das Ribeiras&quot;. A few remain at this site, including Jordão Álvares Caralta, while other stayed along the coast, near Maré (named for the local tidal pool). In addition to their homes, they constructed the small Hermitage of São Pedro, where its first priest was friar Pedro Gigante, whom some historians consider the first person to introduce the Verdelho caste to the islands.

The town of Lajes never received a foral (&quot;charter&quot;) typical of continental settlements; in 1500, the first municipal &quot;chamber&quot; was composed of various &quot;good men&quot; of stature in the community and by charter (dated 14 May 1501) the Captain-Donatary Jôs d&#x27;Utra conferred power and authority to Fernando Álvares to assigned licenses to various settlers in his name, for the monarchy of Portugal. Lajes was the first municipality on Pico and, until 1542, the only one on the island. Lacerda Machado, in &quot;Espelho Cristalino&quot; estimated that the population was no more than about 250 inhabitants by 1506. From this point, Lajes do Pico was constituted by a few parishes: among them were São João, Santíssima Trindade (Lajes do Pico), Calheta de Nesquim and Piedade. In 1540, the municipality of Lajes (which constituted all of the island) included the parishes of Santa Bárbara (Ribeiras), Santíssima Trindade (Lajes), São Mateus, Santa Maria Madalena, São Roque e Nossa Senhora da Ajuda. Over time, though, this island-wide governmental authority would be ceded to local constituent authorities, as the populations grew and demanded autonomy from distant Lajes, who understood little of their regional demands. In 1542, King D. John III decided to divide the municipal in two, constituting the municipality of &quot;Vila Nova de São Roque&quot;, with its parishes of São Roque (seat of municipal authority), Nossa Senhora da Ajuda and Madalena. Its first constituent assembly was seated in 1543. It would be several decades before the municipality of Madalena would be a distinct local authority: on 8 March 1723, the parishes of Madalena (town), Bandeiras and São Mateus would become its own authority. Extinguished in 1895, the municipality would nevertheless be reestablished on 13 January 1898 by royal decree.

Álvaro de Ornelas, then the first Captain-Donatary for the island of Pico (similar to a Civil Governor) never arrived on the island, and never took power. Jôs d&#x27;Utra (Jobst de Van Huertere), then Donatary-Captain of Faial, took over this role in 1482, as the Captaincy of Pico.

:&quot;When the first men arrived on the Island, the found a raised stone, that was vomitted by the volcanoes: colossal stones, huddled at random, like those which are loosened over the pebbles and cliffs of the coast. But the bastards raised their foreheads. They were men...They smashed, excavated, removed stone, opened paths...and the earth began to rise!&quot;

On 15 September 1980, by decree of the regional assembly of the Azores (24/80/A), the civil parish of Ribeirinha was de-annexed from the territory of Piedade to form its own autonomous parish.

==Geography==

The six civil parishes form the municipality of Lajes do Pico, with their own local authority, including:
* Calheta de Nesquim
* Lajes do Pico 
* Piedade
* Ribeiras
* Ribeirinha
* São João

It is native only to the White River, Sac River, James River, and Pomme de Terre River drainages of Missouri and Arkansas. The species is commonly referred to as &quot;goggle-eye&quot;.

==Description==
The Ozark bass is a comparatively slender species of rock bass with a large eye which has a red iris. The brownish-green body has an irregular pattern of black speckling. This species attains a maximum total length of , but they are normally around and the maximum published weight is .

==Distribution==
The Ozark bass is native to the Ozarks upland reaches of the White River system in Missouri and Arkansas. They have been introduced elsewhere but have failed to establish populations in those areas.

==Habitat and biology==
The Ozark bass occurs in creeks and small to medium permanent rivers with high levels of dissolved oxygen, plentiful aquatic vegetation, low turbidity, and sand or rocky beds substrates, with a preference for clear rocky pools close to the banks, boulders, or submerged wood. Males create nests in gravel or small stone substrates, and these are normally situated around a metre of cover. Spawning starts when the water temperature reaches . The male excavates a nest in sand or gravel which is in diameter at depths of . The females lay eggs in the nest, and the male guards the nest until the fry depart.

== Relationship with humans ==
They are a popular game fish in small streams and rivers. The IGFA world record for the species is a twoway tie with fish weighing caught from Bull Shoals Lake in Arkansas and the James River in Missouri.

<text>Wheels is an Australian automotive magazine owned by Motoring Media Network. The publication is well-renowned by Australian car enthusiasts. Its main competitor within the Australian car magazine market was &quot;Motor&quot;, though &quot;Wheels&quot; and &quot;Motor&quot; were stablemates in the Bauer Media Group catalogue and were aimed at slightly different readers as &quot;Motor&quot; put more attention on performance cars. &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine is sold in Australia and New Zealand through online delivery and some retail stores. The magazine was published monthly by Bauer Media before Bauer sold its Australian media interests to Are Media in June 2020. Wheels was sold to Motoring Media Network in July 2024.

==History==
Athol Yeomans first suggested a new car magazine in 1950. He was 21 and working in the production department of K.G. Murray Publishing.

Fred Smith, Murray’s general manager, scoffed at the idea and, instead, started Man’s Life, Adventure Story and Master Detective. Predictably they soon disappeared, while Yeomans was fired for a practical joke on Smith that went spectacularly wrong. The motoring magazine didn’t happen.

Two years later, a freelancing (i.e. unemployed) Yeomans applied for a job at Hudson Publications. Only to be told by Norman Hudson that the advertised job had disappeared because he wanted to start a motoring magazine. Upon hearing this, Yeomans claimed “he almost passed out with desire” and persuaded Hudson that, with his editing experience on the short-lived monthly motoring journal Through The Windscreen, he should be employed on the new magazine. Hudson planned to call it Wheels.

In September, 1952 Yeomans found himself “in a musty smelling stationery storeroom sitting at a table looking at a bare sheet of paper.” With photographer Barrie Loudon, the only other full-time staffer, Yeomans spent months planning the first issue, writing most of it himself. That first Wheels – May 1953, price two shillings and sixpence (25 cents) – was a sensation. Success was immediate - the 30,000 copies printed sold out in a couple of days. A few months later Wheels was selling 60,000 copies a month.

Since 1963, &quot;Wheels&quot; has annually announced its Car of the Year award, although this has been withheld in 1972, 1979 and 1986. The award was created by Bill Tuckey, who also instigated comparisons tests within the title.

It was announced in September 2010 that Bill Thomas, former deputy editor of &quot;BBC Top Gear Magazine&quot; in the UK, would take over as editor in November 2010.

In October 2012, it was announced that former &quot;Top Gear Australia&quot; magazine editor Stephen Corby was to become editor of &quot;Wheels&quot;, replacing Bill Thomas.

For the October 2013 issue, Ben Oliver drove a Volvo S60 Polestar from Melbourne to Sydney along the Hume Highway, and Wheels launched the &quot;Raise the limit, lower the toll&quot; petition to raise the speed limit to 130 km/h, as it is in the Northern Territory. The campaign has since received lots of media coverage and acclamation among Australian motoring enthusiasts.

Glenn Butler was the publication’s editor from 2014 through 2016. He was replaced by Alex Inwood, former deputy editor of the magazine, who was appointed editor of &quot;Wheels&quot; in March 2017.

In the February 2018 issue, the magazine was redesigned with new fonts, thicker paper, a cleaner style and appearance and a greater emphasis on hero photography.

In the October 2020 issue, the publication’s editor, Alex Inwood, left the magazine. His replacement was former &quot;Motor&quot; editor, Dylan Campbell.

In 2020, &quot;Wheels&quot; was acquired by Are Media, the successor to Bauer Media Australia.

From June 2022, the former editor of &quot;Motor&quot;, Andy Enright, was appointed as editor of &quot;Wheels&quot;. From June 2023, &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine celebrated its 70th anniversary with a trilogy of monthly issues themed around Past, Present and Future.

According to Roy Morgan, Wheels&#x27; 70th year saw an increase in circulation of 40.8% to reach 290,000 readers.

In 2023, Wheels won Brand Relaunch of the Year at the Mumbrella Publish Awards. 

Wheels was acquired by Motoring Media Network in July 2024.

<doc id="1216889" wikidata="Q7389323" url="?curid=1216889" title="SCSI initiator and target">
<text>In computer data storage, a SCSI initiator is the endpoint that initiates a SCSI session, that is, sends a SCSI command. The initiator usually does not provide any Logical Unit Numbers (LUNs).

On the other hand, a SCSI target is the endpoint that does &quot;not&quot; initiate sessions, but instead waits for initiators&#x27; commands and provides required input/output data transfers. The target usually provides to the initiators one or more LUNs, because otherwise no read or write command would be possible.

==Detailed information==
Typically, a computer is an initiator and a data storage device is a target. As in a client–server architecture, an initiator is analogous to the client, and a target is analogous to the server. Each SCSI address (each identifier on a SCSI bus) displays behavior of initiator, target, or (rarely) both at the same time. There is nothing in the SCSI protocol that prevents an initiator from acting as a target or vice versa. 

SCSI initiators are sometimes wrongly called &quot; controllers&quot;.

==Other protocols==
&quot;Initiator&quot; and &quot;target&quot; terms are applicable not only to traditional parallel SCSI, but also to Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP), iSCSI (see iSCSI target), HyperSCSI, (in some sense) SATA, ATA over Ethernet (AoE), InfiniBand, DSSI and many other storage networking protocols.

==Address versus port==
In most of these protocols, an address (whether it is initiator or target) is roughly equivalent to physical device&#x27;s port. Situations where a single physical port hosts multiple addresses, or where a single address is accessible from one device&#x27;s multiple ports are not very common, . Even when using multipath I/O to achieve fault tolerance, the device driver switches between different targets or initiators statically bound on physical ports, instead of sharing a static address between physical ports.

<doc id="1216895" wikidata="Q7093216" url="?curid=1216895" title="One Soul Now">
<text>One Soul Now is a 2004 album by the Canadian alt-country band Cowboy Junkies. It is their first album of new material since &quot;Open&quot; in 2001. It was released on Latent Recordings in Canada, and Zoë Records internationally.

== Album development ==
The album title emerged from a quote from John Steinbeck&#x27;s novel, The Grapes of Wrath: &quot;Maybe it&#x27;s all men and all women we love; maybe that&#x27;s the Holy Sperit – the human sperit – the whole shebang. Maybe all men got one big soul ever&#x27;body’s a part of.&quot; The idea behind &quot;One Soul Now&quot; is that everyone is interconnected.

While the Cowboy Junkies was touring to support &quot;Open&quot;, the band members started collecting second-hand recording equipment without a plan or purpose, just a need. When the band was back home, they looked at all the recording studios, and decided to set up the recording equipment in their rehearsal area, eventually turning their space into a recording studio, The Clubhouse. &quot;One Soul Now&quot; is the first album the band made in their new studio. Having their rehearsal space become their recording studio changed the process of creating their tracks. Previously, they would start in the rehearsal space, determine how the songs would work, then go to a studio when ready. Now, the band recorded everything as they worked through the rehearsal process. Later, when they listened to the recordings, the Junkies could pick out the recording where the songs were most vibrant. Per the band, &quot;For example &quot;He Will Call You Baby&quot; was recorded as the band was learning the arrangement and still unsure; &quot;No Long Journey Home&quot; was a trial run through with embellishments added later; &quot;The Stars of Our Stars&quot; was broken down into individual instruments and recorded piece by piece over the course of many weeks…&quot; The band&#x27;s ninth studio album is their first album recorded without an outside producer or engineer. One song, &quot;Simon Keeper&quot;, was recorded much earlier, during the &quot;Open&quot; sessions at Daryl Smith&#x27;s recording studio, Chemical Sound.

The Cowboy Junkies also recorded a 5 song bonus EP of cover songs that they labeled &quot;&#x27;neath your covers, part 1&quot;. They gave away the bonus CD free with every purchase of the &quot;One Soul Now&quot; CD while supplies lasted.

<doc id="1216897" wikidata="Q7257421" url="?curid=1216897" title="Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998">
<text>The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (c. 23) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that protects whistleblowers from detrimental treatment by their employer. Influenced by various financial scandals and accidents, along with the report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, the bill was introduced to Parliament by Richard Shepherd and given government support, on the condition that it become an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996. After receiving the Royal Assent on 2 July 1998, the Act came into force on 2 July 1999. It protects employees who make disclosures of certain types of information, including evidence of illegal activity or damage to the environment, from retribution from their employers, such as dismissal or being passed over for promotion. In cases where such retribution takes place the employee may bring a case before an employment tribunal, which can award compensation.

As a result of the Act, many more employers have instituted internal whistleblowing procedures, although only 38 percent of individuals surveyed worked for a company with such procedures in place . The Act has been criticised for failing to force employers to institute such a policy, containing no provisions preventing the &quot;blacklisting&quot; of employees who make such disclosures, and failing to protect the employee from libel proceedings should their allegation turn out to be false.

Under the Act a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) between an employer and employee, often a condition of compensation for loss of employment for some reason, does not remove a worker’s right to make a protected disclosure, i.e. to blow the whistle. In 2019 a consultation was held on adding limitations on confidentiality clauses, following evidence that some employers used confidentiality clauses to intimidate victims of harassment or discrimination into silence, suggesting that the worker did not have the right to blow the whistle, take a matter to a tribunal, or even discuss with people such as the police, a doctor, or a therapist.

==Background==
Prior to the 1998 Act, whistleblowers in the United Kingdom had no protection against being dismissed by their employer. Although they could avoid being sued for breach of confidence thanks to a public interest defence, that did not prevent subtle or open victimisation in the workplace, including disciplinary action, dismissal, failure to gain promotion or a pay rise. During the early to mid-1990s, interest in whistleblower protection grew, partially because of a series of financial scandals and health and safety accidents, which investigations into showed could have been prevented if employees had been permitted to voice their concerns, and partially because of the work of the Committee on Standards in Public Life.

In 1995 and 1996, two private member&#x27;s bills dealing with whistleblowers were introduced to Parliament, by Tony Wright and Don Touhig respectively, but both efforts fell through. When Richard Shepherd proposed a similar bill, however, he got government support for it on the condition that it be an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996 rather than a new area of law in its own right. Public Concern at Work, a UK-based whistleblowers charity, was involved in the drafting and consultation stages of the bill. The case of Graham Pink added to the pressure to introduce whistleblower protection legislation.

The Public Interest Disclosure Bill was introduced to the House of Commons by Shepherd in 1997, and given its second reading on 12 December before being sent to a committee. After being passed by the Commons it moved to the House of Lords on 27 April 1998, and was passed on 29 June, receiving the Royal Assent on 2 July and becoming the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. Originally scheduled to come into force on 1 January 1999, the Act instead became applicable law on 2 July.

==Contents==
Section 1 of the Act inserts sections 43A to L into the Employment Rights Act 1996, titled &quot;Protected Disclosures&quot;. It provides that a disclosure which the whistleblower makes to their employer, a &quot;prescribed person&quot;, in the course of seeking legal advice, Ministers of the Crown, individuals appointed by the Secretary of State for that purpose, or, in limited circumstances, &quot;any other person&quot;, is protected. In addition, the disclosure must be one which the whistleblower &quot;reasonably believes&quot; shows a criminal offence, a failure to comply with legal obligations, a miscarriage of justice, danger to the health and safety of employees, damage to the environment, or the hiding of information which would show any of the above actions. These disclosures do not have to be of confidential information, and this section does not abolish the public interest defence; in addition, it can be the disclosure of information about actions which have already occurred, are occurring, or could occur in the future. In &quot;Miklaszewicz v Stolt Offshore Ltd&quot;, the Employment Appeal Tribunal confirmed that the disclosure does not have to have been made after the Act came into force; it is sufficient for the dismissal or other persecution by the employer to have happened after that time.

The list of &quot;prescribed persons&quot; is found in the Public Interest Disclosure (Prescribed Persons) Order 1999, and includes only official bodies; the Health and Safety Executive, the Data Protection Registrar, the Certification Officer, the Environment Agency and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. An employee will be protected if he &quot;makes a disclosure in good faith&quot; to one of these people, and &quot;reasonably believes that the relevant failure...is a matter in respect of which the person is prescribed and the information is substantially true&quot;. Other prescribed persons include the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, in relation to &quot;acts or omissions which have an actual or potential effect on the environment... including those relating to pollution&quot;.

If an employee makes such a disclosure, Section 2 inserts a new Section 47B, providing that the employee shall suffer no detriment in their employment as a result. That includes both negative actions and the absence of action and so covers discipline, dismissal, or failing to gain a pay rise or access to facilities which would otherwise have been provided. If an employee suffers a detriment, he is permitted to make a complaint before an employment tribunal under Section 3. In front of an employment tribunal, the law is amended in Sections 4 and 5 to provide compensation, and to reverse the burden of proof. If an employee has been dismissed for making a protected disclosure, this dismissal is automatically considered unfair. Similarly, under Section 6, an employee cannot be given priority when he discusses redundancies simply because he made such a disclosure. These sections take into account Section 7, which notes that there is no requirement of age or length of employment before they come into effect.

Under Section 8, the Secretary of State could pass a statutory instrument setting out the rules and limits surrounding compensation for the employee&#x27;s dismissal after making a protected disclosure; until this is done, Section 9 provided interim remedies, which were the same as in other cases of unfair dismissal. The Secretary of State passed such an instrument, the Public Interest Disclosure (Compensation) Regulations 1999, but Section 8 has now been repealed under Section 44 of the Employment Relations Act 1999. Under Section 10, the Act applies to crown servants, excepting under Section 11, those who are employees of MI5, MI6 or GCHQ. The Act does exclude, in Sections 12 and 13, serving police officers and those employed outside the United Kingdom.

==Assessment and impact==
Terry Corbin, writing in the &quot;Criminal Law and Justice Weekly&quot;, notes that the result of the Act has been that many more employers have developed internal processes for reporting issues, partially because desire to fix problems before they become publicly reported and partially because if employees choose not to use those processes and instead act under the 1998 Act, there is a greater chance that the employer can depict their behaviour as &quot;unreasonable&quot;. However, a survey done by Public Concern At Work showed that in 2010, only 38 percent of those surveyed worked for companies with whistleblowing policies in place, and only 23 percent knew that legal protection for whistleblowers existed. The number of cases brought by whistleblowers to employment tribunals has increased more than tenfold, from 157 in 1999/2000 to 1,761 in 2008/9.

David Lewis, writing in the &quot;Industrial Law Journal&quot;, highlights what he perceives as weaknesses in the legislation. Firstly, it does not force employers to make a policy relating to disclosures. Secondly, it does not prevent employers from &quot;blacklisting&quot; and refusing to hire those who are known within the industry to have made disclosures in previous jobs. The complexity of the law was also criticised, as was the fact that if such a disclosure turns out to be incorrect, the employee may be sued for libel by his employer. Volunteers and self-employed people are not covered, and the same goes for those who, in disclosing the information, commit a criminal offence. Also, the law does not make any provision for psychological harm caused by whistleblowing, which research shows is common.

<text>Ellerslie is a suburb of the city of Auckland, in the North Island of New Zealand. Ellerslie lies seven kilometres to the southeast of the city centre, close to State Highway 1.

Administratively, Ellerslie forms part of the Ōrākei Local Board, which also includes the suburbs of Orakei, Mission Bay, Kohimarama, Saint Heliers, Glendowie, St Johns, Meadowbank and Remuera. To the west, Ellerslie borders on the One Tree Hill area and Cornwall Park. Largely a residential suburb, the area is arguably best-known as the site of Auckland&#x27;s main horse-racing venue, Ellerslie Racecourse, as well as the original site of the Ellerslie Flower Show. (From 2008 the Flower Show moved to Christchurch in the South Island.)

==History==

===The Development of Ellerslie===
The suburb was named by early local politician and entrepreneur Robert Graham, after his father&#x27;s home in Elderslie (sic) in Renfrewshire, Scotland. Graham arrived in Auckland in October 1842 as an assisted immigrant from Scotland.

In 1848 Graham bought two blocks of land where, after his marriage to Sophia Swann in 1852, he built the ‘Ellerslie House’ as a family homestead. Adjacent to this home was a track along which Mrs Graham was in the habit of riding her horse every morning, now a street called Ladies Mile. Many of the local streets bear names of Graham family members.

In 1873 the railway from Auckland was extended to reach Ellerslie. It is likely that Graham developed part of his property as the &#x27;Ellerslie Zoological Gardens&#x27; because of this development. The gardens included flower beds, fountains, a bandstand, dance pavilion and a zoo. This made Ellerslie a popular leisure centre for Aucklanders. In 1886 much of the Graham farm was subdivided for housing. Horse races were already being held in Ellerslie since 1857, but in 1886 the Racing Club acquired a permanent site from the Graham family, including the Zoological Gardens. The racecourse had its own railway station for race days, and was a prominent feature of the Ellerslie area up until its heyday in the 1920s and 1930s.

Next to Ellerslie Train Station a small township developed, servicing not only the local residents but also the race day crowds. As the 20th century progressed the surrounding rural land disappeared and Ellerslie became absorbed into suburban Auckland. The building of the Southern Motorway was to both strengthen the strategic location already created by the railway, as well as weaken the local cohesion of the area because of the physical divide the motorway created.

The original local authority was Ellerslie Town District, established in 1908. The Borough of Ellerslie was formally declared on 1 April 1938. In 1989 Ellerslie was amalgamated into Auckland City Council. The area has seen strong population growth in the recent past, growing 32% in the inner Ellerslie area between 1991 and 2001.

Ellerslie is now a desirable suburb with convenient access to the city centre for commuting (via rail and bus links) and ready access to the nearby Southern Motorway for road users. The town centre is pleasant with good services, while retaining a sense of community. Housing in the area is well planned and close to a number of attractive parks, such as Michaels Avenue Reserve and Waiatarua Reserve.

===Singing Caves===
Māori gave the name ‘Waiatarua’ to the site which later became the Ellerslie Racecourse. Translated as &quot;two songs&quot; the name refers to a waiata or song that emanated from caves. It was believed that this ‘singing’ was created by water and air blowing from a larger cave into a smaller passage, making a vibrating sound. In the 1960s a new grand stand was constructed at the racecourse and the caves were filled with concrete to create a seal. This was not wholly successful, and it is said that the singing could still be heard coming from the caves.

===The Town Centre===
The Ellerslie Town Centre is on Main Highway near where it intersects with the Ellerslie-Panmure Highway. The construction in the 1960s of the Southern Motorway cut Ellerslie off nearby Greenlane, resulting in a downturn in trade and many empty shops. However, in the 2000s, Ellerslie recovered with a strong upturn in employment in the nearby business parks on the southern side of the motorway (connected to the area with a pedestrian overbridge). The overbridge was the location of the opening scene of the New Zealand film &quot;Once Were Warriors (film)&quot;. In 2006, the overbridge was transformed with a ‘Bridge of Memories’ mosaic storyboard portraying different landmark buildings, houses (past and present), and images from the local schools. Thanks to the long-term strategy of the local business association, it is now increasingly oriented towards lunchtime shoppers and again has many prosperous smaller businesses.

===The Ellerslie Meteorite===

At 9.00 am on 12 June 2004 a meteorite crashed through the roof of the home of the Archer family in Ellerslie. The meteorite landed into the living room of the house, bouncing off the couch and hitting the ceiling. The home owners heard an explosion and saw dust everywhere, but nobody was hurt. This meteorite is officially named the Auckland Meteorite, despite tradition demanding that a meteorite is named after the nearest post office. However, an Ellerslie Meteorite had already fallen in Australia. The rock weighs 1.3 kg and is estimated to be around 4,600 million years old. It is the ninth meteorite found in New Zealand and the first to hit a home. According to Auckland University experts, a meteorite that crashes through a roof is a very rare event. This meteorite received world-wide attention and an American collector offered the Archer family $50,000 for the space rock. The Archers declined this offer, favouring the public display of the rock in New Zealand, so that anyone interested could view it. The meteorite has been since on display in the Auckland Museum, where it can be seen in the &quot;Origins Gallery&quot;.

===The Ellerslie Flower Show===
The Ellerslie International Flower Show was first held in Ellerslie in 1994 at the Ellerslie Racecourse. This is New Zealand’s annual garden show. After 3 years in Ellerslie, it moved to the Auckland Botanic Gardens in Manurewa, Auckland. In 2008 the Flower Show moved again, this time to Hagley Park in Christchurch.

==Landmarks and features==

===The Ellerslie Race Course===

The Ellerslie area has been known as the centre for horseracing since New Zealand’s first race meeting was organised there in 1842. The property was first used as farmland by Robert Graham, who was a supporter of racing. He later developed both the Alexandra Park Racecourse and the Ellerslie Racecourse. In 1873, Graham sold both racecourses to the Auckland Racing Club. The Auckland Jockey Club bought around 36 hectares (90 acres) in 1872. Today, the club owns around 72 hectares (180 acres) and race meetings are regularly held at the race course, including the New Zealand Derby and the Auckland Cup, the main races at the summer meeting. The racecourse is also home to a golf driving range and a nine-hole pitch and putt. In recent years, associated activities like fashion shows and socialising have become as important as watching the races.

<doc id="1216900" wikidata="Q494210" url="?curid=1216900" title="National Governors Association">
<text>The National Governors Association (NGA) is an American political organization founded in 1908. The association&#x27;s members are the governors of the 55 states, territories and commonwealths. Members come from across the political spectrum. NGA declares itself as nonpartisan.

The NGA serves as a public policy liaison between state governments and the federal government. NGA provides governors and their senior staff members with services that range from representing states on Capitol Hill and at the White House when discussing federal issues to developing policy reports on state programs and hosting networking seminars for state executive branch officials. The NGA Center for Best Practices focuses on state innovations and best practices on issues that range from education and health to technology, welfare reform, and the environment. NGA also provides management and technical assistance to both new and incumbent governors.

The current NGA chair is Governor Jared Polis of Colorado, a Democrat. The current vice chair is Governor Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, a Republican.

==History==

In 1907, the Inland Waterways Commission thought it necessary to ask the Conference of Governors to provide both state and national views relating to practical questions dealing with natural resources utilization and management in the Progressive Era. The NGA represents the governors of the fifty U.S. states and five U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). It is funded primarily by state dues, federal grants and contracts, and private contributions.

NGA adopted a policy in 1977 formalizing its standard practice dating back to 1941: The position of NGA chair alternates yearly between Republican and Democratic governors, so that neither party can control the position for two consecutive years. The vice chair is of the opposite party to the chair, and generally assumes the role of NGA chair the following year.

, Bill Clinton is the only former NGA chair to become president of the United States. Janet Napolitano became the first female chair in 2006.

The association&#x27;s declaration of bipartisanship has been challenged after incidents such as statements made at the White House and on air by Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal during the 2014 annual summer meeting.

In February 2020, then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned the National Governors Association that the Chinese Communist Party was actively attempting to influence U.S. policy through state governors and local officials. In October 2020, the United States Department of State discontinued U.S. participation in the U.S.-China Governors Forum to Promote Sub-National Cooperation due to alleged attempts by the Chinese People&#x27;s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, a front organization for the CCP&#x27;s United Front Work Department, to &quot;malignly influence state and local leaders&quot; in the U.S.

==Chairs==
Formally adopted as policy in 1977, chairs preside for a one-year term and alternate party affiliation, so the same party never serves for two terms in a row.

The following states have never produced an NGA chair: Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, and South Dakota; nor have any of the five territories: American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The shadow bass&#x27; native range includes the southeastern United States from the Apalachicola River drainage in Georgia to the lower Mississippi basin in Louisiana. Two isolated populations reported in the St. Francis, Black Arkansas Red, and upper Ouachita River drainages in Missouri and Arkansas in the Ozark regions may either not represent this species or are hybrids with &quot;Ambloplites rupestris&quot;. In Tennessee, the shadow bass can be found in most drainages south of the Tennessee River. Other river drainages that shadow bass inhabit are Blackwater and Chattahoochee Rivers in southern Georgia and northern Florida. The apparent absence of shadow bass in Black Belt streams is probably the result of low stream flow and poor water-quality conditions during the late summer when temperatures are high. Channelization is a possible factor in the distribution of the shadow bass in Mississippi River systems, but no difference in the distribution of shadow bass was found.

==Ecology==
The shadow bass is a freshwater fish that inhabits a climate range of 38 to 29°N in the United States. It prefers slow-flowing water over substrates of silt-free mud, sand, gravel, and pebbles. Brushy and vegetated pools are preferred microhabitat in most streams. Undercut banks and woody debris in small to medium-sized rivers and streams are also preferred habitat. The quantitative diet of shadow bass consists mostly of small invertebrates, mainly crayfish when less than three inches; after three inches, they can begin feeding on small fish species such as darters, madtoms, and minnows. The main predator and competitor of the shadow bass is the smallmouth bass which inhabits the same microhabitat. Research on the introduction of rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;) in shadow bass habitat to measure competition between the species, the data showed no effect on shadow bass populations. Factors by humans that might attribute to population decline of the shadow bass channelization, sedimentation from logging, and habitat encroachment.

==Life history==
Shadow bass normally spawn from January to August, spawning season being determined by water temperature and so by location to some extent too. Spawning is earlier in southern Alabama or southern Georgia as the water is warmer in these regions, while fish found at higher latitudes typically spawn later when the water reached the ideal spawning temperature of . The breeding males show obvious darkening to the membranes of the pelvic and anal fins while these remain yellow or white in the females. Sexual maturity is attained at a year old and a mature female may lay 1,300 eggs in a spawning season, although after cold winters fewer, larger eggs are laid and this means that spawn hatching rates are not affected by temperature. This strategy of laying a smaller number of larger eggs after colder winters or a larger number of smaller eggs after milder winters ensures that the population of shadow bass has a consistent recruitment rate.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The shadow bass is a member of the centrarchids or sunfish family and is closely related to the rock bass &quot;Ambloplites rupestris&quot; along with one more related species occurring naturally. The shadow bass was previously considered to be a subspecies of the rock bass (&quot;A. rupestris&quot;). It was first formally described in 1936 by Peter Viosca Jr. with the type locality given as Little Bogue Falaya Creek, 3 miles north of Covington, Louisiana. The generic name is derived from Greek and is a compound of &quot;ambloo&quot; meaning &quot;blunt&quot; and &quot;oplites&quot; meaning &quot;shield&quot;, while the specific name means &quot;large-eyed&quot;.

==Relationship with humans==
=== Management ===
Through its range even for the two isolated populations, the shadow bass is not listed as being in any danger, and the shadow bass is federally listed as G5 secure, while the IUCN classify its status as Least Concern. Current management for the shadow bass in the rivers in Mississippi was to protects pools and prevent sediment pollution in areas of shadow bass populations. In most places, shadow bass are not considered a game fish and receive little management attention. In Missouri, however, where shadow bass has a demand in the game fish market, biologists are conducting population studies using mark and recapture methods and information for anglers to provide data to determine what, if any, angling restrictions need to apply to shadow bass fishing.

=== Angling ===
The IGFA all tackle world record for the shadow bass stands at caught from the Spring River in Arkansas.

<text>Obelism is the practice of annotating manuscripts with marks set in the margins. Modern obelisms are used by editors when proofreading a manuscript or typescript. Examples are &quot;stet&quot; (which is Latin for &quot;Let it stand&quot;, used in this context to mean &quot;disregard the previous mark&quot;) and &quot;dele&quot; (for &quot;Delete&quot;).

The obelos symbol (see obelus) gets its name from the spit, or sharp end of a lance in ancient Greek. An obelos was placed by editors on the margins of manuscripts, especially in Homer, to indicate lines that may not have been written by Homer. The system was developed by Aristarchus and notably used later by Origen in his &quot;Hexapla&quot;. Origen marked spurious words with an opening obelus and a closing metobelos (&quot;end of obelus&quot;).

There were many other such shorthand symbols, to indicate corrections, emendations, deletions, additions, and so on. Most used are the editorial coronis, the paragraphos, the forked paragraphos, the reversed forked paragraphos, the hypodiastole, the downwards ancora, the upwards ancora, and the dotted right-pointing angle, which is also known as the . Loosely, all these symbols, and the act of annotation by means of them, are obelism.

These nine ancient Greek textual annotation symbols are also included in the supplemental punctuation list of ISO/IEC 10646 standard for character sets.

==Modern encoding==

Unicode encodes the following:

Some of these were also used in Ancient Greek punctuation as word dividers. The two-dot punctuation is used as a word separator in Old Turkic script.

<doc id="1216914" wikidata="Q1440048" url="?curid=1216914" title="Discrete-time Fourier transform">
<text>In mathematics, the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) is a form of Fourier analysis that is applicable to a sequence of discrete values.

The DTFT is often used to analyze samples of a continuous function. The term &quot;discrete-time&quot; refers to the fact that the transform operates on discrete data, often samples whose interval has units of time. From uniformly spaced samples it produces a function of frequency that is a periodic summation of the continuous Fourier transform of the original continuous function. In simpler terms, when you take the DTFT of regularly-spaced samples of a continuous signal, you get repeating (and possibly overlapping) copies of the signal&#x27;s frequency spectrum, spaced at intervals corresponding to the sampling frequency. Under certain theoretical conditions, described by the sampling theorem, the original continuous function can be recovered perfectly from the DTFT and thus from the original discrete samples. The DTFT itself is a continuous function of frequency, but discrete samples of it can be readily calculated via the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) (see ), which is by far the most common method of modern Fourier analysis.

Both transforms are invertible. The inverse DTFT reconstructs the original sampled data sequence, while the inverse DFT produces a periodic summation of the original sequence. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm for computing one cycle of the DFT, and its inverse produces one cycle of the inverse DFT.

== Relation to Fourier Transform ==

Let formula_1 be a continuous function in the time domain.
We begin with a common definition of the continuous Fourier transform,
where formula_2 represents frequency in hertz and formula_3 represents time in seconds:

:formula_4

We can reduce the integral into a summation by sampling formula_1 at intervals of formula_6 seconds
(see ).
Specifically, we can replace formula_1 with a discrete sequence of its samples, formula_8, for integer values of formula_9,
and replace the differential element formula_10 with the sampling period formula_6.
Thus, we obtain one formulation for the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT):

:formula_12

This Fourier series (in frequency) is a continuous periodic function, whose periodicity is the sampling frequency formula_13.
The subscript formula_13 distinguishes it from the continuous Fourier transform formula_15,
and from the angular frequency form of the DTFT.
The latter is obtained by defining an angular frequency variable, formula_16 (which has normalized units of &quot;radians/sample&quot;), giving us a periodic function of angular frequency, with periodicity formula_17:

The utility of the DTFT is rooted in the Poisson summation formula, which tells us that the periodic function represented by the Fourier series is a periodic summation of the continuous Fourier transform:
The components of the periodic summation are centered at integer values (denoted by formula_18) of a normalized frequency (cycles per sample). Ordinary/physical frequency (cycles per second) is the product of formula_18 and the sample-rate, formula_20   For sufficiently large formula_21 the formula_22 term can be observed in the region formula_23 with little or no distortion (aliasing) from the other terms.  Fig.1 depicts an example where formula_13 is not large enough to prevent aliasing.

We also note that formula_25 is the Fourier transform of formula_26 Therefore, an alternative definition of DTFT is:
The modulated Dirac comb function is a mathematical abstraction sometimes referred to as &quot;impulse sampling&quot;.

== Inverse transform ==
An operation that recovers the discrete data sequence from the DTFT function is called an &quot;inverse DTFT&quot;. For instance, the inverse continuous Fourier transform of both sides of produces the sequence in the form of a modulated Dirac comb function:

:formula_27

However, noting that formula_28 is periodic, all the necessary information is contained within any interval of length formula_29  In both and , the summations over formula_9 are a Fourier series, with coefficients formula_31  The standard formulas for the Fourier coefficients are also the inverse transforms:
\displaystyle &amp;= \frac{1}{2 \pi}\int_{2\pi} S_{2\pi}(\omega)\cdot e^{i \omega n} d\omega \quad \scriptstyle{\text{(integral over any interval of length }2\pi\textrm{)}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;     |}}

== Periodic data ==
When the input data sequence formula_32 is formula_33-periodic, can be computationally reduced to a discrete Fourier transform (DFT), because:
* All the available information is contained within formula_33 samples.
* formula_28 converges to zero everywhere except at integer multiples of formula_36 known as harmonic frequencies. At those frequencies, the DTFT diverges at different frequency-dependent rates. And those rates are given by the DFT of one cycle of the formula_32 sequence.
* The DTFT is periodic, so the maximum number of unique harmonic amplitudes is formula_38

The DFT of one cycle of the formula_32 sequence is:

:formula_40

And formula_32 can be expressed in terms of the inverse transform, which is sometimes referred to as a Discrete Fourier series (DFS):

:formula_42
With these definitions, we can demonstrate the relationship between the DTFT and the DFT:

:formula_43      

Due to the formula_33-periodicity of both functions of formula_45 this can be simplified to:

:formula_46

which satisfies the inverse transform requirement:

:formula_47

== Sampling the DTFT ==
When the DTFT is continuous, a common practice is to compute an arbitrary number of samples formula_48 of one cycle of the periodic function formula_49:  

:formula_50

where formula_51 is a periodic summation:

:formula_52     (see Discrete Fourier series)

The formula_51 sequence is the inverse DFT. Thus, our sampling of the DTFT causes the inverse transform to become periodic. The array of formula_54 values is known as a &quot;periodogram&quot;, and the parameter formula_33 is called NFFT in the Matlab function of the same name.

In order to evaluate one cycle of formula_51 numerically, we require a finite-length formula_32 sequence. For instance, a long sequence might be truncated by a window function of length formula_58 resulting in three cases worthy of special mention. For notational simplicity, consider the formula_32 values below to represent the values modified by the window function.

Case: Frequency decimation. formula_60 for some integer formula_61 (typically 6 or 8)

A cycle of formula_51 reduces to a summation of formula_61 segments of length formula_64  The DFT then goes by various names, such as:
*&quot;window-presum FFT&quot;
*&quot;Weight, overlap, add (WOLA)&quot;

*&quot;polyphase DFT&quot;
*&quot;polyphase filter bank&quot;
*&quot;multiple block windowing&quot; and &quot;time-aliasing&quot;.

Recall that decimation of sampled data in one domain (time or frequency) produces overlap (sometimes known as aliasing) in the other, and vice versa. Compared to an formula_58-length DFT, the formula_51 summation/overlap causes decimation in frequency, leaving only DTFT samples least affected by spectral leakage. That is usually a priority when implementing an FFT filter-bank (channelizer). With a conventional window function of length formula_67 scalloping loss would be unacceptable. So multi-block windows are created using FIR filter design tools.  Their frequency profile is flat at the highest point and falls off quickly at the midpoint between the remaining DTFT samples. The larger the value of parameter formula_68 the better the potential performance.

Case: formula_69

When a symmetric, formula_58-length window function (formula_71) is truncated by 1 coefficient it is called &quot;periodic&quot; or &quot;DFT-even&quot;. That is a common practice, but the truncation affects the DTFT (spectral leakage) by a small amount. It is at least of academic interest to characterize that effect.  An formula_33-length DFT of the truncated window produces frequency samples at intervals of formula_73 instead of formula_74  The samples are real-valued,  but their values do not exactly match the DTFT of the symmetric window. The periodic summation, formula_75 along with an formula_33-length DFT, can also be used to sample the DTFT at intervals of formula_77  Those samples are also real-valued and do exactly match the DTFT (example: :File:Sampling the Discrete-time Fourier transform.svg). To use the full symmetric window for spectral analysis at the formula_78 spacing, one would combine the formula_79 and formula_80 data samples (by addition, because the symmetrical window weights them equally) and then apply the truncated symmetric window and the formula_33-length DFT.


Case: Frequency interpolation. formula_82

In this case, the DFT simplifies to a more familiar form:

:formula_83

In order to take advantage of a fast Fourier transform algorithm for computing the DFT, the summation is usually performed over all formula_33 terms, even though formula_85 of them are zeros. Therefore, the case formula_86 is often referred to as zero-padding.

Spectral leakage, which increases as formula_58 decreases, is detrimental to certain important performance metrics, such as resolution of multiple frequency components and the amount of noise measured by each DTFT sample. But those things don&#x27;t always matter, for instance when the formula_32 sequence is a noiseless sinusoid (or a constant), shaped by a window function. Then it is a common practice to use &quot;zero-padding&quot; to graphically display and compare the detailed leakage patterns of window functions. To illustrate that for a rectangular window, consider the sequence:

:formula_89 and formula_90

Figures 2 and 3 are plots of the magnitude of two different sized DFTs, as indicated in their labels. In both cases, the dominant component is at the signal frequency: formula_91. Also visible in Fig 2 is the spectral leakage pattern of the formula_92 rectangular window. The illusion in Fig 3 is a result of sampling the DTFT at just its zero-crossings. Rather than the DTFT of a finite-length sequence, it gives the impression of an infinitely long sinusoidal sequence. Contributing factors to the illusion are the use of a rectangular window, and the choice of a frequency (1/8 = 8/64) with exactly 8 (an integer) cycles per 64 samples. A Hann window would produce a similar result, except the peak would be widened to 3 samples (see DFT-even Hann window).

== Convolution ==

The convolution theorem for sequences is:

:formula_93
An important special case is the circular convolution of sequences and defined by formula_94 where formula_51 is a periodic summation. The discrete-frequency nature of formula_96 means that the product with the continuous function formula_97 is also discrete, which results in considerable simplification of the inverse transform:

:formula_98

For and sequences whose non-zero duration is less than or equal to , a final simplification is:

:formula_99

The significance of this result is explained at Circular convolution and Fast convolution algorithms.

== Relationship to the Z-transform ==
formula_100 is a Fourier series that can also be expressed in terms of the bilateral Z-transform.  I.e.:

:formula_101

where the formula_102 notation distinguishes the Z-transform from the Fourier transform. Therefore, we can also express a portion of the Z-transform in terms of the Fourier transform:

:formula_103

Note that when parameter changes, the terms of formula_100 remain a constant separation formula_105 apart, and their width scales up or down. The terms of remain a constant width and their separation scales up or down.

== Table of discrete-time Fourier transforms ==
Some common transform pairs are shown in the table below. The following notation applies:

*formula_106 is a real number representing continuous angular frequency (in radians per sample). (formula_2 is in cycles/sec, and formula_6 is in sec/sample.) In all cases in the table, the DTFT is 2π-periodic (in formula_109).

<doc id="1216924" wikidata="Q494661" url="?curid=1216924" title="Pepero Day">
<text>Pepero Day is held annually on November 11, and is an observance in South Korea similar to Valentine&#x27;s Day. It is the biggest annual day-marketing event in South Korea, and involves the gifting or exchange of Pepero snacks, a line of chocolate-dipped cookie sticks, with the intention of displaying affection for friends and loved ones. It is held on this day due to the resemblance of Pepero sticks to the shortened date of 11/11.

There&#x27;s a similar Pocky &amp; Pretz Day in Japan.
Surprisingly, Pepero Day started in Korea before Pocky Day in Japan.
Pepero Day has gained huge advertising effects and commercial results by using this observance.
The Japanese company belatedly copied it and made Pocky &amp; Pretz Day, and it was promoted through it.

==History==

The exact origins of this day are unknown. The origins are usually traced to a news story set in 1983. In the story, two female middle school students in the Yeongnam region exchanged Pepero wishing that they would both become tall and thin. However, there is some doubt about this story. Some argue that the origin was due to the shape of 1&#x27;s in the date (November 11 – 11/11) resembling Pepero sticks, while some others attribute the similarity of shapes as factors that attributed to the popularity but not its origin.

The fad spread with the idea that, for maximum effectiveness for height and thinness, one must eat 11 packets of Pepero on November 11, 11:11am and 11:11pm at 11 seconds exactly. From 1997, Lotte started to use the aforementioned school story to successfully promote Pepero Day. The trend led to other companies creating similarly shaped snacks to participate on Pepero Day. , Lotte was making 50% of its annual sales on Pepero Day. , several department stores including Hyundai Department Store, Shinsegae, and Lotte Department Store were benefiting for people celebrating the day while stores such as E-mart and Homeplus were specially displaying and selling peperos on the day.

==Controversy==

Pepero Day has been criticized as a business tool and marketing strategy of certain companies, as well as for promoting unhealthy, fattening food that contradicts its original meaning (about becoming tall and thin). In addition, some say the day is an insult to hardworking farmers as Farmers&#x27; Day, enacted in Korea in 1996 to promote farming, also falls on November 11.

Thus the alternative &quot;Garaetteok Day&quot; has been proposed to promote the exchange of garaetteok (sticks of white tteok, a type of Korean rice cake, which unlike pepero are commonly made and sold by smaller businesses).
