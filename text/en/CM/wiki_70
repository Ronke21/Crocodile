<text>A master of ceremonies, abbreviated MC or emcee, is the official host of a ceremony, staged event, conference, convention, or similar performance.

The term is earliest documented in the Catholic Church since the 5th century, where the master of ceremonies is an official of the Papal Court responsible for the proper and smooth conduct of the elaborate rituals involving the pope and the sacred liturgy.

The master of ceremonies sometimes also refers to the protocol officer during an official state function, especially in monarchies.

Today, the term is often used to connote a person who presents performers, speaks to the audience, entertains people, and generally keeps an event moving. This usage occurs in the entertainment industry, for example in reference to television game show hosts, as well as in contemporary hip-hop and electronic dance music culture.

In addition, the term also exists in various chivalric orders and fraternal orders.

==Name==
Alternative names include &quot;compère&quot; (for men), &quot;commère&quot; (for women), host, presenter, announcer, and microphone controller.

== Catholic Church ==

The office of the Master of Ceremonies itself is very old. The Master of Ceremonies is an official of the Papal household responsible for the proper and smooth conduct of the elegant and elaborate rituals involving the Pope and the sacred liturgy. He may also be an official involved in the proper conduct of protocols and ceremonials involving the Roman Pontiff, the Papal Court, and other dignitaries and potentates. Examples of official liturgical books prescribing the rules and regulations of liturgical celebrations are &quot;Cæremoniale Romanum&quot; and &quot;Cæremoniale Episcoporum&quot;. The role of the master of ceremonies is outlined in the &quot;Ceremonial of Bishops&quot;, Nos. 34–36.

According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, the most ancient ceremonials and rituals of the Catholic Church are the &quot;Ordines Romani&quot;. Names of Masters of Ceremonies are known since the late Middle Ages (15th century) and the Renaissance (16th century). However, copies of books prescribing the forms of rituals, rites and customs of pontifical ceremonies are known to have been given to Charles Martel in the 8th century. The rules and rituals themselves are known to have been compiled or written by the pontifical masters of ceremonies, dating back to the time of Pope Gelasius I (492–496) with modifications and additions made by Pope Gregory the Great (590–604). It is reasonable to assume that the ceremonials themselves pre-date Gelasius. The duties of the Master of Ceremonies may have developed from the time Emperor Constantine the Great gave the Lateran Palace to the popes (324) or from the time Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire (380), and were no doubt influenced by imperial practices, customs and norms. However, documentary evidence from the late Roman period is scarce or lost. The ceremonies and practices of the Byzantine emperors are also known to have influenced the papal court. The accumulation of elaborations and complications since the Renaissance and Baroque eras continued well into the 20th century, until some of the ceremonies (i.e. the court, the rituals and norms) were simplified or eliminated by Pope Paul VI in the 1970s after Vatican II; much of the Renaissance pomp and ceremony has been completely abandoned by the popes of the modern era.

Since the apostolic constitution &quot;Pastor bonus&quot; of June 28, 1988, the organizing and conducting of liturgies and other religious ceremonies performed by the pope comes under the Office for the Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff. It is headed by a &quot;Master&quot; appointed for a term of five years. Papal masters of ceremonies who assist him in sacred celebrations are likewise appointed to a term of the same length.

According to the &quot;General Instruction of the Roman Missal&quot;, &quot;It is desirable, at least in cathedrals and in larger churches, to have some competent minister or master of ceremonies, to see to the appropriate arrangement of sacred actions and to their being carried out by the sacred ministers and lay faithful with decorum, order, and devotion.&quot; The Master of Ceremonies may also have responsibility for the physical security of the place of worship during the liturgy, and be familiar with appropriate procedures in case of a medical emergency. The Master of Ceremonies coordinates with any concelebrating priests, deacons, altar servers and sometimes the lectors and music ministers to ensure each knows when and how to perform their liturgical functions. At major festivities such as Christmas and Easter, when the liturgies are long and complex, the Master of Ceremonies plays a vital role in ensuring that everything runs smoothly.
The current (2021-2026) papal Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations is Monsignor Diego Giovanni Ravelli, who succeeded Bishop Guido Marini. (See the full list of appointments.)

== Monarchies ==
Historically certain European royal courts maintained senior offices known as Masters of Ceremonies (or some variant thereof), responsible for conducting stately ceremonies such as coronations and receptions of foreign ambassadors. Examples included:

* Kingdom of Denmark: Ceremonimester (Office currently held by Colonel Lasse Harkjær) 
* Spanish Empire: Maestro de Ceremonias
* British Empire: Master of the Ceremonies
* France: Grand Master of Ceremonies
* Japan: Master of Ceremonies
* Russian Empire: see Table of Ranks
* Kingdom of Sweden: Grand Master of the Ceremonies
* Ottoman Empire: Kapıcıbaşı, literally &quot;chief doorkeeper&quot; of the Topkapi Palace

== Orders ==
The function is prevalent in the culture of chivalric orders, as well as in more modern fraternal orders, such as Freemasons and Odd Fellows.

== Corporate ==
Most large corporate and association conferences and conventions use an MC to keep the events running smoothly. This role is sometimes performed by someone inside the group but usually by an outside professional expert MC. Their role could include – introducing and thanking speakers, introducing the theme of the conference, facilitating a panel discussion and interviewing guests.

== Weddings ==
During the wedding reception, the multifaceted responsibility of the Master of Ceremony (MC) is to keep the agenda flowing smoothly by:

* skillfully capturing and maintaining the attention of the wedding guests
* effectively directing their attention to whatever the bride and groom have chosen to include
* keeping the wedding attendees informed so that at any given moment they know what is happening
* comfortably guiding the bride&#x27;s and groom&#x27;s friends and family so they know what they are supposed to do to participate

The role of the wedding master of ceremonies incorporates a wide range of skills, and those who serve in this capacity have frequently undergone extensive training in the following areas:

* Delivering applause cues
* Presenting introductions
* Microphone technique
* Posture and stance
* Voice inflection
* Staging

Masters of ceremonies at weddings and private events also ensure the coordination of their event, including liaison with catering staff.

== In music and cultural events ==
In hip hop and electronic dance music, MCs are rap artists or performers who perform vocals for their own or other artists&#x27; original material. Genres of electronic dance music where MCs perform include house, drum and bass, UK garage and grime.

=== Hip hop ===

In the late 1970s, the term emcee, MC or M.C. became used for rappers and for their role within hip hop music and culture. Initially, MCs were those who introduced the DJs to the crowd and explained what was taking place during the event. Often these events were parties at locations including clubs or outdoor public spaces. The term is typically used as a term of distinction, referring to an artist with good performance skills. Many rappers have MC in their stage name, such as MC Hammer, MC Lyte, MC Ren, MC Shan, MC Eiht or MC Serch.

=== Comedy clubs ===

In the context of a comedy club, the role of MC is traditionally filled by a &quot;compère&quot;. In any comedy show, the compère is the host of the evening&#x27;s events, but the precise role and responsibilities will vary depending on the country, venue, and style of event. The compère is usually a working comedian, and whilst they may incorporate elements of their regular set, the role broadly requires a greater level of improvisation – creating a sense of place and community, interacting with the audience, dealing with any hecklers, and encouraging them to focus on the other acts. The compère will normally do longer bits at the start of the show and after any interval, and shorter bits between acts. They may also be required to make announcements, such as birthdays, anniversaries, and bar promotions.

==Other==
In some circles, the title &quot;Master of Ceremonies&quot; is also known as &quot;Minister of Ceremonies&quot;.

In the 1940 Disney film &quot;Fantasia&quot;, Deems Taylor is the film&#x27;s Master of Ceremonies.

In the role-playing game &quot;Apocalypse World&quot;, the game master is named Master of Ceremonies (MC).

<doc id="1217337" wikidata="Q5599063" url="?curid=1217337" title="Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge">
<text>The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge was created in 1974 to help protect and preserve a portion of the Great Dismal Swamp, a marshy region on the Coastal Plain of southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina between Norfolk, Virginia, and Elizabeth City, North Carolina in the United States. It is located in parts of the independent cities of Chesapeake and Suffolk in Virginia, and the counties of Camden, Gates, and Pasquotank in North Carolina.

==Description==

The Great Dismal Swamp is a southern swamp, the northernmost of many swamps along the Atlantic Ocean&#x27;s coast, including the Everglades and the Big Cypress in Florida, the Okefenokee of Georgia, the Congress and Four Holes swamps of South Carolina, and some of the Carolina Bays.

Essential to the swamp ecosystem are its water resources, native vegetative communities, and varied wildlife species. The Great Dismal Swamp&#x27;s ecological significance and its wealth of history and lore make it a unique wilderness. It is one of the last large wild areas remaining in the Eastern United States.

==History==

The Great Dismal Swamp is in southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina between the James River (Norfolk, Virginia) and the Albemarle Sound (Edenton, North Carolina). The aboriginal swamp was estimated to be over ; however, human encroachment has destroyed up to 90% of the original swampland.

Beginning in the 1660s, an established community of escaped slaves known as the Great Dismal Swamp maroons lived freely within the Great Dismal Swamp. Most maroons settled in mesic islands, the high and dry parts of the swamp. Maroons were not the only people who lived inside the swamp – some residents had bought their freedom, others were still slaves who lived semi-independently. In addition, some escaped slaves used the swamp as a stop on the Underground Railroad as they made their way further north. Nearby whites often left the maroons alone so long as they paid a quota in logs or shingles.

After centuries of logging and other human activities that devastated the swamp&#x27;s ecosystems, in 1973, the Union Camp Corporation donated 49,100 acres (199 km2) of land. The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge was established by the U.S. Congress through The Dismal Swamp Act of 1974. The Refuge has grown to just over in size.

In 1805, the Dismal Swamp Canal began serving as a commercial highway for timber coming out of the swamp. The canal continues to serve recreational boaters as part of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, administered by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

==Habitat and wildlife==
The refuge consists of over of forested wetlands. Lake Drummond, a natural lake, is located in the heart of the swamp. Outside the boundaries of the National Refuge, the state of North Carolina has preserved and protected additional portions of the swamp.

The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge is located not only between two states, but also between two eco-regions, allowing for a wide range of plant and animal species. Bald cypress, black gum, maple, Atlantic white cedar, and pine are the predominant tree species found on the refuge and support the wildlife within. Many mammals, including black bears, bobcats, otters, and weasels along with over 70 species of reptiles and amphibians call the swamp home. More than 200 bird species can be seen at the swamp throughout the year, while 96 of those are known to nest on the refuge. The peak influx of neotropical migratory songbirds, such as numerous species of warblers, is from late April to mid-May.

==Recreation==
The refuge is open daily during daylight hours. There is no entrance fee. The refuge headquarters, at the western edge of the refuge, is open on weekdays, except national holidays.

Visitor activities include birdwatching, photography, hiking, bicycling, boating and canoeing (a boat-launching ramp, offering access to Lake Drummond, is provided onto the Feeder Ditch, at the eastern edge of the refuge), fishing, and deer hunting on parts of the refuge during the designated season. Camping is permitted at a campsite maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers on the feeder ditch canal close to Lake Drummond.

Lake Drummond is the middle of activity in the swamp today, though, with many fishermen, sightseers, and boaters. Boat tours are given from the Dismal Swamp Canal, to Lake Drummond.

Hiking opportunities include the nearly (wheelchair-accessible) Dismal Town Boardwalk Trail, located on Washington Ditch Road, that winds through part of the swamp habitat; a number of the refuge&#x27;s unpaved roads that are also open to bicycling; and the Dismal Swamp Canal Trail, an former section of Route 17 converted into a multi-use trail. The Dismal Swamp Canal Trail follows the eastern side of the swamp from a trailhead near Dominion Blvd south to within of the North Carolina border.

<text>Yetisports is a series of online flash games created in 2004 by Austrian studio Edelweiss Medienwerkst and later by ROOT9 Medialab.

==Original titles==
===Yetisports: Pingu Throw===
Release date: January 19, 2004
Platforms: Flash, Mobile, PlayStation Portable, iOS, Android
In this game, the player must click the mouse to hit the penguin with a baseball bat. Depending on when the player clicks the mouse, the yeti will hit the penguin a long distance, a short distance, or not hit the penguin at all. The goal is to hit the penguin as far as you can. It was originally released for Flash and mobile devices in 2004. In 2009 (2010 in the USA), it was also released for the PlayStation Portable as part of its PlayStation minis line. There is also an iOS version. A second iOS version was also released, which is based on the PSP version. Later, a remake was released for iOS and Android featuring updated graphics.

===Yetisports: Pingu Throw SE===
Release date: 2010
Platforms: PC
A remake of Yetisports: Pingu Throw featuring updated graphics.

===Yetisports: Pingu Throw HD===
Platforms: iOS
An HD remake of Yetisports: Pingu Throw. It is based on the PSP version of Yetisports: Pingu Throw.

===Yetisports: Orca Slap===
Release date: February 12, 2004
Platforms: Flash, Mobile, iOS, Android
In this game, you must aim with the mouse cursor, and once you have aimed, you must click the mouse cursor to throw a snowball to hit a penguin towards a target. If the penguin hits the bullseye, you get the most points. It was originally released for Flash and mobile devices, and later, a remake was made for iOS and Android with updated graphics.

===Yetisports: Seal Bounce===
Release date: March 18, 2004
Platforms: Flash, Mobile, PC, iOS, Android
In this game, you play with 2 clicks of the mouse. The first click starts the yeti windmilling his arms (which holds a penguin), and the second click makes him release the penguin between two glaciers with seals sticking out at regular intervals. The seals hit the penguin higher, which is useful as the penguin will not go higher than 300 if thrown straight up, whereas with bounces it is possible to go substantially past 400. It was originally released in 2004 for Flash and mobile devices. In 2010, the game was remade for the PC featuring updated graphics. Later, the game was also remade for iOS and Android with updated graphics.

===Yetisports: Albatros Overload===
Release date: April 29, 2004
Platforms: Flash, Mobile, PC, iOS, Android
This game is set in Australia. The penguin stands on one side of a see-saw while the yeti stomps on the other end. If the stomp is executed with good timing, the penguin lands on an albatross flying overhead. The player then has control over when the albatross flaps its wings. The closer to the ground the bird flaps, the more efficient it is. When the albatross&#x27; energy bar (which slowly recharges when the bird is not flapping) reaches 0, the bird will soon crash. It was originally released in 2004 for Flash and mobile devices. In 2010, the game was remade for the PC featuring updated graphics. Later, the game was also remade for iOS and Android with updated graphics.

===Yetisports: Flamingo Drive===
Release date: June 17, 2004
Platforms: Flash, Mobile, PC, iOS, Android
This game, set in Africa, involves using a flamingo as a golf club to hit a penguin. The angle is set by clicking while an arrow points at various angles, and power is set by clicking while a bar moves up and down. You have five shots per game. There are many game elements that will affect the final score, such as giraffes, which will catch the penguin in their mouths and throw it further if the penguin flies near their heads; Elephants and acacias that block low shots; Vultures that catch the penguin, bring it lower and drop it, if it flies too high; and snakes that bounce the penguin higher if it hits them. There is always the same pattern of animals and trees: A giraffe at 0, an acacia at 1000, and a giraffe at 2000, for example. The pattern can be used to help determine the best angle of the first shot. It is definitely a lower angle, but the exact best angle is hard to achieve. A tiny difference can mean a score on the first shot of 350 or 1000. It was originally released in 2004 for Flash and mobile devices. In 2010, the game was remade for the PC featuring updated graphics. Later, the game was also remade for iOS and Android with updated graphics.

===Yetisports: Ylympics===
Release date: 2004
Platforms: Flash
This game is a compilation of Yetisports: Pingu Throw, Yetisports: Orca Slap, Yetisports: Seal Bounce, Yetisports: Albatros Overload, and Yetisports: Flamingo Drive. The player plays through the games in order. The game keeps the score for each game as well as the total score.

===Yetisports: Big Wave===
Release date: September 2, 2004
Platforms: Flash, iOS, Android
This game, controlled by the arrow keys, is the first of a series of games focusing more on the yeti, instead of the penguin and his attempts at flight. The yeti surfs up and down a big wave, trying to pull off tricks and hit penguins out of the air. The wave gradually shrinks until the end of the game. If you press the Y (&quot;motivation&quot;) key, when playing the game, an unseen penguin loudly yodels, which then echoes in the background. It was originally released in 2004 for Flash. Later, the game was also remade for iOS and Android with updated graphics.

===Yetisports: Stage Dive===
Release date: September 15, 2004
Platforms: Flash, Mobile
Influenced by the new media on his travels the Yeti gets into rock music, and to prove his &quot;popstar&quot; credentials, dives headfirst into the mosh-pit where the penguins are headbanging. They struggle to the task of getting the Yeti around the room. The Yetis movements are controlled with the left mouse button: you have ten clicks to get the Yeti as far as possible. This game was released as a &quot;special stage&quot;.

===Yetisports: Snowboard Freeride===
Release date: October 14, 2004
Platforms: Flash, Mobile, iOS, Android
In this game, the yeti snowboards down a long slope, racing 10 penguins. The slope has many jumps and ibexes that send the yeti into the air, where he can do tricks for points. The point is not to win the race, but to get the most points, though you get bonus points for doing well in the race. Hitting a penguin slows it down for a few seconds, but then the penguin gets angry and moves faster. It was originally released in 2004 for Flash and mobile devices. Later, the game was also remade for iOS and Android with updated graphics.

===Yetisports: Jungle Swing===
Release date: April 4, 2005
Platforms: Flash, Mobile, iOS, Android
This game involves swinging up a series of branches in a tree, jumping with a mouse click. It requires precise timing, as the angle of the jump changes based on when the click is. When the yeti jumps off a green branch, the branch turns gold. When the yeti jumps off a gold branch, the branch turns red. When the yeti jumps off a red branch, the branch falls off and 3 green branches grow on the 3 next branchless spaces. There are only 25 branches at the start, all of which are green, so to get to the top yeti must swing off of 9 different branches 3 times each to get to the top, as well as the 50 branches that must be climbed to get to the top at all. It was originally released in 2005 for Flash. Later, the game was also remade for iOS and Android with updated graphics.

===Yetisports: Final Spit===
Release date: July 7, 2005
Platforms: Flash, Mobile
In this game, the yeti has kidnapped a llama and makes it spit at penguins. The other animals don&#x27;t like being spat at and spitting them costs points. Missing 10 penguins or running out of time ends the game. Hitting the ox gives you a time bonus. This was originally planned to be the final Yetisports game.

===Yetisports X: Icicle Climb===
Platforms: Flash, PC
In this game, the yeti has 12 icicles to throw into the side of a cliff. There is a penguin next to this cliff, and he jumps up the icicles. The only limitation is the fact that the penguin only jumps 1.2 meters up. It was originally released for Flash. In 2010, the game was remade for the PC featuring updated graphics. There is also a Christmas version of this game called Yetisports Xmas Climb.

===Yetisports Game Pack: Vol. 1===
Platforms: Mobile

<text>The three L-1 Mallet steam locomotives of the Erie Railroad, built in July 1907 by ALCO, and numbered 2600, 2601 and 2602 (ALCo construction numbers 42269, 42270 and 42271 respectively); were unique in that they were the only articulated camelback locomotives ever built. 

When built in 1907, they were the largest steam locomotives in the world, weighing . The L-1 Class was also called the &quot;Angus&quot; Type in homage to Angus Sinclair, who was the publisher of Railway &amp; Locomotive Engineering, a leading trade journal. A rarely seen photograph of #2602 shows his name under the windows on the cab sides.

The use of an intercepting valve allowed the locomotive to be used in simple or single expansion steam capacity. This meant that if desired, high pressure steam could be supplied to the front and rear cylinder groups for additional power at the cost of exhausting the boiler of steam pressure quicker. 

These locomotives were built as pushers for the heavy grades of the Erie Railroads&#x27; Susquehanna Division over Gulf Summit on the Pennsylvania and New York State border; and these locomotives primarily operated between Port Jervis, NY, and Susquehanna, PA.

==Two doors, one fireman==
The L-1s were fired by one fireman. Most camelback locomotives have large Wootten fireboxes that burn anthracite coal. Anthracite, is harder and slower burning than bituminous coal, so a larger grate area is needed to achieve the same amount of heating. 

==Baldwin Locomotive Works rebuild==
In 1921 the locomotives were sent out by Erie to be rebuilt by Baldwin Locomotive Works, as s with more conventionally rear located cabs, Standard DuPont Type B automatic mechanical stokers, Schmidt Type A superheaters, and Elasco feedwater heaters to make them more efficient. The valves on the front cylinders were changed from slide valves to piston valves. 

The L-1&#x27;s were retired in December 1930 and subsequently scrapped.

<text>Alexander Grant Dexter (1896–1961) was a Canadian journalist in the mid-20th century. Dexter spent his entire career with the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot;, which he joined in 1912 at the age of 16. He served in Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse from 1915 until he was invalided to England in 1917. For many years (1923–44) he was parliamentary reporter in Ottawa for John Dafoe&#x27;s &quot;Free Press&quot;. He served as associate editor of the &quot;Free Press&quot; from 1946 to 1948, then as editor from 1948 to 1954. Dexter was very well-connected to official Ottawa. He sent detailed memoranda on politics and Ottawa intrigues to his employers. These have been preserved at Queen&#x27;s University and a collection of his wartime memoranda has been published.

<doc id="1217345" wikidata="Q6813850" url="?curid=1217345" title="Melville (album)">
<text>Melville is the second studio album by the Canadian rock band Rheostatics, released in 1991. This album garnered wide airplay across Canada, and the single &quot;Record Body Count&quot; was a significant hit for the band on Canadian alternative rock stations and MuchMusic in 1991.

The album&#x27;s title was a complex, multilayered reference, meant to simultaneously evoke both writer Herman Melville and the town of Melville, Saskatchewan, as well as Lewis Melville, a frequent collaborator with the band who appeared as a session musician on the album.

The song “You Are Very Star”, a bonus track on the CD release, ends with a hockey announcer’s narration in which the band is presented as a hockey team competing for the league’s top ranking against 13 Engines, Scott B. Sympathy and Tom Cochrane.

In 1996, the Canadian music magazine &quot;Chart&quot; conducted a reader poll to determine the best Canadian albums of all time. &quot;Melville&quot; placed 16th in that poll. When the magazine conducted a follow-up poll in 2000, &quot;Melville&quot; placed fifth, behind only Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Sloan and Rheostatics’ 1992 album &quot;Whale Music&quot;. In the magazine’s third poll in 2005, &quot;Melville&quot; placed 44th, but was one of only 25 albums to have placed in the Top 50 in all three polls.

==Track listing==
All songs are credited to the Rheostatics, except where noted.

The last two songs are bonus tracks available only on the CD version of the album.

The album cover is part of a painting by guitarist Martin Tielli.

==Honours==

In 1996, the Canadian music magazine &quot;Chart&quot; conducted a reader poll to determine the greatest Canadian albums of all time. &quot;Whale Music&quot; placed fifth in that poll, behind only Sloan, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and The Tragically Hip. When the magazine conducted a follow-up poll in 2000, &quot;Whale Music&quot; placed fourth behind Mitchell, Young and Sloan, and was followed in fifth by the band&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Melville&quot;. In the magazine&#x27;s third poll in 2005, &quot;Whale Music&quot; placed tenth. It is one of six albums to have ranked in the top ten in all three polls.

It was ranked 19th in Bob Mersereau&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;The Top 100 Canadian Albums&quot;.

==Covers==
Barenaked Ladies, who had been guest musicians on the album, also covered &quot;Legal Age Life at Variety Store&quot; on the 2007 Rheostatics tribute album &quot;The Secret Sessions&quot;. Their version also included guest performers Jason Plumb and Tim Mech. On the same album, The Inbreds covered &quot;Dope Fiends and Boozehounds&quot; and By Divine Right covered &quot;Shaved Head&quot;.

<doc id="1217358" wikidata="Q2033252" url="?curid=1217358" title="Misuse of statistics">
<text>Statistics, when used in a misleading fashion, can trick the casual observer into believing something other than what the data shows. That is, a misuse of statistics occurs when
a statistical argument asserts a falsehood. In some cases, the misuse may be accidental. In others, it is purposeful and for the gain of the perpetrator. When the statistical reason involved is false or misapplied, this constitutes a statistical [[fallacy]].

The consequences of such misinterpretations can be quite severe. For example, in medical science, correcting a falsehood may take decades and cost lives.

Misuses can be easy to fall into. Professional scientists, mathematicians and even professional statisticians, can be fooled by even some simple methods, even if they are careful to check everything. Scientists have been known to fool themselves with statistics due to lack of knowledge of probability theory and lack of standardization of their tests.

==Definition, limitations and context==
One usable definition is: &quot;Misuse of Statistics: Using numbers in such a manner that – either by intent or through ignorance or carelessness – the conclusions are unjustified or incorrect.&quot; The &quot;numbers&quot; include misleading graphics discussed in other sources. The term is not commonly encountered in statistics texts and there is no single authoritative definition. It is a generalization of lying with statistics which was richly described by examples from statisticians 60 years ago.

The definition confronts some problems (some are addressed by the source):

# Statistics usually produces probabilities; conclusions are provisional
# The provisional conclusions have errors and error rates. Commonly 5% of the provisional conclusions of significance testing are wrong
# Statisticians are not in complete agreement on ideal methods
# Statistical methods are based on assumptions which are seldom fully met
# Data gathering is usually limited by ethical, practical and financial constraints.

&quot;How to Lie with Statistics&quot; acknowledges that statistics can &quot;legitimately&quot; take many forms. Whether the statistics show that a product is &quot;light and economical&quot; or &quot;flimsy and cheap&quot; can be debated whatever the numbers. Some object to the substitution of statistical correctness for moral leadership (for example) as an objective. Assigning blame for misuses is often difficult because scientists, pollsters, statisticians and reporters are often employees or consultants.

An insidious misuse of statistics is completed by the listener, observer, audience, or juror. The supplier provides the &quot;statistics&quot; as numbers or graphics (or before/after photographs), allowing the consumer to draw conclusions that may be unjustified or incorrect. The poor state of public statistical literacy and the non-statistical nature of human intuition make it possible to mislead without explicitly producing faulty conclusion. The definition is weak on the responsibility of the consumer of statistics.

A historian listed over 100 fallacies in a dozen categories including those of generalization and those of causation. A few of the fallacies are explicitly or potentially statistical including sampling, statistical nonsense, statistical probability, false extrapolation, false interpolation and insidious generalization. All of the technical/mathematical problems of applied probability would fit in the single listed fallacy of statistical probability. Many of the fallacies could be coupled to statistical analysis, allowing the possibility of a false conclusion flowing from a statistically sound analysis.

An example use of statistics is in the analysis of medical research. The process includes experimental planning, the conduct of the experiment, data analysis, drawing the logical conclusions and presentation/reporting. The report is summarized by the popular press and by advertisers. Misuses of statistics can result from problems at any step in the process. The statistical standards ideally imposed on the scientific report are much different than those imposed on the popular press and advertisers; however, cases exist of advertising disguised as science, such as Australasian Journal of Bone &amp; Joint Medicine. The definition of the misuse of statistics is weak on the required completeness of statistical reporting. The opinion is expressed that newspapers must provide at least the source for the statistics reported.

==Simple causes==
Many misuses of statistics occur because
* The source is a subject matter expert, not a statistics expert. The source may incorrectly use a method or interpret a result.
* The source is a statistician, not a subject matter expert. An expert should know when the numbers being compared describe different things. Numbers change, as reality does not, when legal definitions or political boundaries change.
* The subject being studied is not well defined, or some of its aspects are easy to quantify while others hard to quantify or there is no known quantification method (see McNamara fallacy). For example:
** While IQ tests are available and numeric, it is difficult to define what they measure, as intelligence is an elusive concept.
** Publishing &quot;impact&quot; has the same problem. Scientific papers and scholarly journals are often rated by &quot;impact&quot;, quantified as the number of citations by later publications. Mathematicians and statisticians conclude that impact (while relatively objective) is not a very meaningful measure. &quot;The sole reliance on citation data provides at best an incomplete and often shallow understanding of an understanding that is valid only when reinforced by other judgments. Numbers are not inherently superior to sound judgments.&quot;
** A seemingly simple question about the number of words in the English language immediately encounters questions about archaic forms, accounting for prefixes and suffixes, multiple definitions of a word, variant spellings, dialects, fanciful creations (like ectoplastistics from ectoplasm and statistics), technical vocabulary, and so on.
* Data quality is poor. Apparel provides an example. People have a wide range of sizes and body shapes. It is obvious that apparel sizing must be multidimensional. Instead it is complex in unexpected ways. Some apparel is sold by size only (with no explicit consideration of body shape), sizes vary by country and manufacturer and some sizes are deliberately misleading. While sizes are numeric, only the crudest of statistical analyses is possible using the size numbers with care.
* The popular press has limited expertise and mixed motives. If the facts are not &quot;newsworthy&quot; (which may require exaggeration) they may not be published. The motives of advertisers are even more mixed.
* &quot;Politicians use statistics in the same way that a drunk uses lamp posts—for support rather than illumination&quot; – Andrew Lang (WikiQuote) &quot;What do we learn from these two ways of looking at the same numbers? We learn that a clever propagandist, right or left, can almost always find a way to present the data on economic growth that seems to support her case. And we therefore also learn to take any statistical analysis from a strongly political source with handfuls of salt.&quot; The term statistics originates from numbers generated for and utilized by the state. Good government may require accurate numbers, but popular government may require supportive numbers (not necessarily the same). &quot;The use and misuse of statistics by governments is an ancient art.&quot;

==Types of misuse==

===Discarding unfavorable observations===
To promote a neutral (useless) product, a company must find or conduct, for example, 40 studies with a confidence level of 95%. If the product is useless, this would produce one study showing the product was beneficial, one study showing it was harmful, and thirty-eight inconclusive studies (38 is 95% of 40). This tactic becomes more effective when there are more studies available. Organizations that do not publish every study they carry out, such as tobacco companies denying a link between smoking and cancer, anti-smoking advocacy groups and media outlets trying to prove a link between smoking and various ailments, or miracle pill vendors, are likely to use this tactic.

Ronald Fisher considered this issue in his famous lady tasting tea example experiment (from his 1935 book, &quot;The Design of Experiments&quot;). Regarding repeated experiments, he said, &quot;It would be illegitimate and would rob our calculation of its basis if unsuccessful results were not all brought into the account.&quot;

Another term related to this concept is cherry picking.

===Ignoring important features===
Multivariable datasets have two or more features/dimensions. If too few of these features are chosen for analysis (for example, if just one feature is chosen and simple linear regression is performed instead of multiple linear regression), the results can be misleading. This leaves the analyst vulnerable to any of various statistical paradoxes, or in some (not all) cases false causality as below.

===Loaded questions===

The answers to surveys can often be manipulated by wording the question in such a way as to induce a prevalence towards a certain answer from the respondent. For example, in polling support for a war, the questions:
* Do you support the attempt by the US to bring freedom and democracy to other places in the world?
* Do you support the unprovoked military action by the USA?
will likely result in data skewed in different directions, although they are both polling about the support for the war. A better way of wording the question could be &quot;Do you support the current US military action abroad?&quot; A still more nearly neutral way to put that question is &quot;What is your view about the current US military action abroad?&quot; The point should be that the person being asked has no way of guessing from the wording what the questioner might want to hear.

Another way to do this is to precede the question by information that supports the &quot;desired&quot; answer. For example, more people will likely answer &quot;yes&quot; to the question &quot;Given the increasing burden of taxes on middle-class families, do you support cuts in income tax?&quot; than to the question &quot;Considering the rising federal budget deficit and the desperate need for more revenue, do you support cuts in income tax?&quot;

The proper formulation of questions can be very subtle, but nonetheless can yield significant differences in results. Additionally, the responses to two questions can vary dramatically depending on the order in which they are asked. &quot;A survey that asked about &#x27;ownership of stock&#x27; found that most Texas ranchers owned stock, though probably not the kind traded on the New York Stock Exchange.&quot;

===Overgeneralization===
Overgeneralization is a fallacy occurring when a statistic about a particular population is asserted to hold among members of a group for which the original population is not a representative sample.

For example, suppose 100% of apples are observed to be red in summer. The assertion &quot;All apples are red&quot; would be an instance of overgeneralization because the original statistic was true only of a specific subset of apples (those in summer), which is not expected to be representative of the population of apples as a whole.

A real-world example of the overgeneralization fallacy can be observed as an artifact of modern polling techniques, which prohibit calling cell phones for over-the-phone political polls. As young people are more likely than other demographic groups to lack a conventional &quot;landline&quot; phone, a telephone poll that exclusively surveys responders of calls landline phones, may cause the poll results to undersample the views of young people, if no other measures are taken to account for this skewing of the sampling. Thus, a poll examining the voting preferences of young people using this technique may not be a perfectly accurate representation of young peoples&#x27; true voting preferences as a whole without overgeneralizing, because the sample used excludes young people that carry only cell phones, who may or may not have voting preferences that differ from the rest of the population.

Overgeneralization often occurs when information is passed through nontechnical sources, in particular mass media.

===Biased samples===
Scientists have learned at great cost that gathering good experimental data for statistical analysis is difficult. Example: The placebo effect (mind over body) is very powerful. 100% of subjects developed a rash when exposed to an inert substance that was falsely called poison ivy while few developed a rash to a &quot;harmless&quot; object that really was poison ivy. Researchers combat this effect by double-blind randomized comparative experiments. Statisticians typically worry more about the validity of the data than the analysis. This is reflected in a field of study within statistics known as the design of experiments.

Pollsters have learned at great cost that gathering good survey data for statistical analysis is difficult. The selective effect of cellular telephones on data collection (discussed in the Overgeneralization section) is one potential example; If young people with traditional telephones are not representative, the sample can be biased. Sample surveys have many pitfalls and require great care in execution. One effort required almost 3,000 telephone calls to get 1,000 answers. The simple random sample of the population &quot;isn&#x27;t simple and may not be random.&quot;

===Misreporting or misunderstanding of estimated error===

If a research team wants to know how 300 million people feel about a certain topic, it would be impractical to ask all of them. However, if the team picks a random sample of about 1,000 people, they can be fairly certain that the results given by this group are representative of what the larger group would have said if they had all been asked.

This confidence can actually be quantified by the central limit theorem and other mathematical results. Confidence is expressed as a probability of the true result (for the larger group) being within a certain range of the estimate (the figure for the smaller group). This is the &quot;plus or minus&quot; figure often quoted for statistical surveys. The probability part of the confidence level is usually not mentioned; if so, it is assumed to be a standard number like 95%.

The two numbers are related. If a survey has an estimated error of ±5% at 95% confidence, it also has an estimated error of ±6.6% at 99% confidence. ±formula_1% at 95% confidence is always ±formula_2% at 99% confidence for a normally distributed population.

The smaller the estimated error, the larger the required sample, at a given confidence level; for example, at 95.4% confidence:
* ±1% would require 10,000 people.
* ±2% would require 2,500 people.
* ±3% would require 1,111 people.
* ±4% would require 625 people.
* ±5% would require 400 people.
* ±10% would require 100 people. 
* ±20% would require 25 people. 
* ±25% would require 16 people. 
* ±50% would require 4 people.

People may assume, because the confidence figure is omitted, that there is a 100% certainty that the true result is within the estimated error. This is not mathematically correct.

Many people may not realize that the randomness of the sample is very important. In practice, many opinion polls are conducted by phone, which distorts the sample in several ways, including exclusion of people who do not have phones, favoring the inclusion of people who have more than one phone, favoring the inclusion of people who are willing to participate in a phone survey over those who refuse, etc. Non-random sampling makes the estimated error unreliable.

On the other hand, people may consider that statistics are inherently unreliable because not everybody is called, or because they themselves are never polled. People may think that it is impossible to get data on the opinion of dozens of millions of people by just polling a few thousands. This is also inaccurate. A poll with perfect unbiased sampling and truthful answers has a mathematically determined margin of error, which only depends on the number of people polled.

However, often only one margin of error is reported for a survey. When results are reported for population subgroups, a larger margin of error will apply, but this may not be made clear. For example, a survey of 1,000 people may contain 100 people from a certain ethnic or economic group. The results focusing on that group will be much less reliable than results for the full population. If the margin of error for the full sample was 4%, say, then the margin of error for such a subgroup could be around 13%.

There are also many other measurement problems in population surveys.

The problems mentioned above apply to all statistical experiments, not just population surveys.

===False causality===
When a statistical test shows a correlation between A and B, there are usually six possibilities:

# A causes B.
# B causes A.
# A and B both partly cause each other.
# A and B are both caused by a third factor, C.
# B is caused by C which is correlated to A.
# The observed correlation was due purely to chance.

The sixth possibility can be quantified by statistical tests that can calculate the probability that the correlation observed would be as large as it is just by chance if, in fact, there is no relationship between the variables. However, even if that possibility has a small probability, there are still the five others.

If the number of people buying ice cream at the beach is statistically related to the number of people who drown at the beach, then nobody would claim ice cream causes drowning because it&#x27;s obvious that it isn&#x27;t so. (In this case, both drowning and ice cream buying are clearly related by a third factor: the number of people at the beach).

This fallacy can be used, for example, to prove that exposure to a chemical causes cancer. Replace &quot;number of people buying ice cream&quot; with &quot;number of people exposed to chemical X&quot;, and &quot;number of people who drown&quot; with &quot;number of people who get cancer&quot;, and many people will believe you. In such a situation, there may be a statistical correlation even if there is no real effect. For example, if there is a perception that a chemical site is &quot;dangerous&quot; (even if it really isn&#x27;t) property values in the area will decrease, which will entice more low-income families to move to that area. If low-income families are more likely to get cancer than high-income families (due to a poorer diet, for example, or less access to medical care) then rates of cancer will go up, even though the chemical itself is not dangerous. It is believed that this is exactly what happened with some of the early studies showing a link between EMF (electromagnetic fields) from power lines and cancer.

In well-designed studies, the effect of false causality can be eliminated by assigning some people into a &quot;treatment group&quot; and some people into a &quot;control group&quot; at random, and giving the treatment group the treatment and not giving the control group the treatment. In the above example, a researcher might expose one group of people to chemical X and leave a second group unexposed. If the first group had higher cancer rates, the researcher knows that there is no third factor that affected whether a person was exposed because he controlled who was exposed or not, and he assigned people to the exposed and non-exposed groups at random. However, in many applications, actually doing an experiment in this way is either prohibitively expensive, infeasible, unethical, illegal, or downright impossible. For example, it is highly unlikely that an IRB would accept an experiment that involved intentionally exposing people to a dangerous substance in order to test its toxicity. The obvious ethical implications of such types of experiments limit researchers&#x27; ability to empirically test causation.

===Proof of the null hypothesis===
In a statistical test, the null hypothesis (formula_3) is considered valid until enough data proves it wrong. Then formula_3 is rejected and the alternative hypothesis (formula_5) is considered to be proven as correct. By chance this can happen, although formula_3 is true, with a probability denoted formula_7 (the significance level). This can be compared to the judicial process, where the accused is considered innocent (formula_3) until proven guilty (formula_5) beyond reasonable doubt (formula_7).

But if data does not give us enough proof to reject that formula_3, this does not automatically prove that formula_3 is correct. If, for example, a tobacco producer wishes to demonstrate that its products are safe, it can easily conduct a test with a small sample of smokers versus a small sample of non-smokers. It is unlikely that any of them will develop lung cancer (and even if they do, the difference between the groups has to be very big in order to reject formula_3). Therefore, it is likely—even when smoking is dangerous—that our test will not reject formula_3. If formula_3 is accepted, it does not automatically follow that smoking is proven harmless. The test has insufficient power to reject formula_3, so the test is useless and the value of the &quot;proof&quot; of formula_3 is also null.

This can—using the judicial analogue above—be compared with the truly guilty defendant who is released just because the proof is not enough for a guilty verdict. This does not prove the defendant&#x27;s innocence, but only that there is not proof enough for a guilty verdict.

&quot;...the null hypothesis is never proved or established, but it is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation. Every experiment may be said to exist only in order to give the facts a chance of disproving the null hypothesis.&quot; (Fisher in &quot;The Design of Experiments&quot;) Many reasons for confusion exist including the use of double negative logic and terminology resulting from the merger of Fisher&#x27;s &quot;significance testing&quot; (where the null hypothesis is never accepted) with &quot;hypothesis testing&quot; (where some hypothesis is always accepted).

===Confusing statistical significance with practical significance===
Statistical significance is a measure of probability; practical significance is a measure of effect. A baldness cure is statistically significant if a sparse peach-fuzz usually covers the previously naked scalp. The cure is practically significant when a hat is no longer required in cold weather and the barber asks how much to take off the top. The bald want a cure that is both statistically and practically significant; It will probably work and if it does, it will have a big hairy effect. Scientific publication often requires only statistical significance. This has led to complaints (for the last 50 years) that statistical significance testing is a misuse of statistics.

===Data dredging===

Data dredging is an abuse of data mining. In data dredging, large compilations of data are examined in order to find a correlation, without any pre-defined choice of a hypothesis to be tested. Since the required confidence interval to establish a relationship between two parameters is usually chosen to be 95% (meaning that there is a 95% chance that the relationship observed is not due to random chance), there is thus a 5% chance of finding a correlation between any two sets of completely random variables. Given that data dredging efforts typically examine large datasets with many variables, and hence even larger numbers of pairs of variables, spurious but apparently statistically significant results are almost certain to be found by any such study.

Note that data dredging is a valid way of &quot;finding&quot; a possible hypothesis but that hypothesis &quot;must&quot; then be tested with data not used in the original dredging. The misuse comes in when that hypothesis is stated as fact without further validation.

&quot;You cannot legitimately test a hypothesis on the same data that first suggested that hypothesis. The remedy is clear. Once you have a hypothesis, design a study to search specifically for the effect you now think is there. If the result of this test is statistically significant, you have real evidence at last.&quot;

===Data manipulation===
Informally called &quot;fudging the data,&quot; this practice includes selective reporting (see also publication bias) and even simply making up false data.

Examples of selective reporting abound. The easiest and most common examples involve choosing a group of results that follow a pattern consistent with the preferred hypothesis while ignoring other results or &quot;data runs&quot; that contradict the hypothesis.

Scientists, in general, question the validity of study results that cannot be reproduced by other investigators. However, some scientists refuse to publish their data and methods.

Data manipulation is a serious issue/consideration in the most honest of statistical analyses. Outliers, missing data and non-normality can all adversely affect the validity of statistical analysis. It is appropriate to study the data and repair real problems before analysis begins. &quot;[I]n any scatter diagram there will be some points more or less detached from the main part of the cloud: these points should be rejected only for cause.&quot;

===Other fallacies===
Pseudoreplication is a technical error associated with analysis of variance. Complexity hides the fact that statistical analysis is being attempted on a single sample (N=1). For this degenerate case the variance cannot be calculated (division by zero). An (N=1) will always give the researcher the highest statistical correlation between intent bias and actual findings.

The gambler&#x27;s fallacy assumes that an event for which a future likelihood can be measured had the same likelihood of happening once it has already occurred. Thus, if someone had already tossed 9 coins and each has come up heads, people tend to assume that the likelihood of a tenth toss also being heads is 1023 to 1 against (which it was before the first coin was tossed) when in fact the chance of the tenth head is 50% (assuming the coin is unbiased).

The prosecutor&#x27;s fallacy assumes that the probability of an apparently criminal event being random chance is equal to the chance that the suspect is innocent. A prominent example in the UK is the wrongful conviction of Sally Clark for killing her two sons who appeared to have died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). In his expert testimony, now discredited Professor Sir Roy Meadow claimed that due to the rarity of SIDS, the probability of Clark being innocent was 1 in 73 million. This was later questioned by the Royal Statistical Society; assuming Meadows figure was accurate, one has to weigh up all the possible explanations against each other to make a conclusion on which most likely caused the unexplained death of the two children. Available data suggest that the odds would be in favour of double SIDS compared to double homicide by a factor of nine. The 1 in 73 million figure was also misleading as it was reached by finding the probability of a baby from an affluent, non-smoking family dying from SIDS and squaring it: this erroneously treats each death as statistically independent, assuming that there is no factor, such as genetics, that would make it more likely for two siblings to die from SIDS. This is also an example of the ecological fallacy as it assumes the probability of SIDS in Clark&#x27;s family was the same as the average of all affluent, non-smoking families; social class is a highly complex and multifaceted concept, with numerous other variables such as education, line of work, and many more. Assuming that an individual will have the same attributes as the rest of a given group fails to account for the effects of other variables which in turn can be misleading. The conviction of Sally Clark was eventually overturned and Meadow was struck from the medical register.

The ludic fallacy. Probabilities are based on simple models that ignore real (if remote) possibilities. Poker players do not consider that an opponent may draw a gun rather than a card. The insured (and governments) assume that insurers will remain solvent, but see AIG and systemic risk.

===Other types of misuse===
Other misuses include comparing apples and oranges, using the wrong average, regression toward the mean, and the umbrella phrase garbage in, garbage out. Some statistics are simply irrelevant to an issue.

Certain advertising phrasing such as &quot;[m]ore than 99 in 100,&quot; may be misinterpreted as 100%.

Anscombe&#x27;s quartet is a made-up dataset that exemplifies the shortcomings of simple descriptive statistics (and the value of data plotting before numerical analysis).

<text>Music Inspired by the Group of Seven is a 1995 album by Rheostatics.

The album was commissioned by the National Gallery of Canada to accompany its Group of Seven retrospective show. The album has twelve pieces, most of which are instrumental music. However, snippets of recorded dialogue from the Group of Seven artists, and other contemporaneous figures such as Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, Mackenzie King and John Diefenbaker, are mixed in.

None of the twelve pieces are titled on the album cover. However, track 7 is a reworking of &quot;Northern Wish&quot;, from the band&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Melville&quot;, and a Rheostatics fansite has compiled a set of unofficial titles for the other tracks which is commonly accepted by the band&#x27;s fans. Many of these alternate titles were taken from the band&#x27;s actual set lists, when available.

It is also the band&#x27;s first album to feature Don Kerr. Kerr replaced Dave Clark on drums. Kerr also interviewed artist Winchell Price, a landscape painter, whose comments on the link between music and visual art open the album as the introduction to the first track.

<text>The Blue Hysteria is a 1996 album by Rheostatics.

&quot;Bad Time to Be Poor&quot;, a protest song about life in Ontario during the government of Mike Harris, was the album&#x27;s first single. The band also contributed this song to the compilation album &quot;GASCD&quot; in 2001 to support citizen media and social justice groups in protesting the Quebec City Summit of the Americas.

To support the album, the band were invited on tour as the opening act for The Tragically Hip. At the beginning of the Hip&#x27;s 1997 live album &quot;Live Between Us&quot;, singer Gordon Downie acknowledges the Rheostatics, and towards the end of the album, Downie works a verse from &quot;Bad Time to Be Poor&quot; into &quot;Nautical Disaster&quot;.

The 1997 Rheostatics album &quot;Double Live&quot; also partially documents the band&#x27;s tour with the Hip.

&quot;Bad Time to Be Poor&quot; was covered by The Weakerthans on the 2007 Rheostatics tribute album &quot;The Secret Sessions&quot;. Their version reached #1 on CBC Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;R3-30&quot; chart.

<text>Double Live is a 1997 album by Rheostatics. It collects a variety of live performances by the band, ranging from intimate club settings to record store sessions to their arena tour with The Tragically Hip in 1996.

The album includes a number of tracks which have never appeared on any previous Rheostatics album. One of these tracks, &quot;Good Canadian&quot;, was improvised on the spot, while the version of &quot;Record Body Count&quot; was recorded in the lobby of Calgary&#x27;s Uptown Theatre after the end of their show there, when the band decided on the spur of the moment to run out and play an extra encore for the fans as they left the venue.

The Hip&#x27;s live album &quot;Live Between Us&quot;, released the same year, documents a show for which Rheostatics were the opening band. Gordon Downie acknowledges and thanks Rheostatics at the beginning of that album.

It was the second-biggest selling album of the band&#x27;s entire career, behind only their major label debut &quot;Melville&quot;, and was the #1 album of the entire year on Canada&#x27;s campus radio charts.

== Cover ==
On the cover of the album, Martin Tielli is playing a double neck guitar which he painted himself with a &quot;never quite presented idea&quot; for the new Canadian flag designed by A.Y. Jackson.

==Critical response==
Tom Harrison of &quot;The Province&quot; praised the album, writing that &quot;the quintessential thinking Canadian band might have gone overboard with two CDs that log more than two hours but it would be hard to deny the group&#x27;s feeling that this collection of live recordings taken from a variety of sources is a defining statement. Always literate, maybe too intelligent for their own good, Rheostatics can make complex music that is both beautiful and imploring, simple country songs by smart city boys that have real compassion and hard rock that serves as essays on pop sociology, all the while communicating a Canadian character that exhibits a real love and appreciation of our culture. The true north strong and free of jingoism.&quot;

For the Southam News service, Ted Shaw wrote that &quot;Rheostatics have never been zany enough to compete with the likes of the Barenaked Ladies, or career-oriented enough to take on the mainstream with The Tragically Hip. But this live CD, recorded during the band&#x27;s spring tour of 1997, shows they have elements of what makes both those other bands successful. If the Hip are the musical equivalent of an Atom Egoyan film, Rheostatics would be Bruce McDonald.&quot; He concluded that &quot;Double Live is the most honest, if not the most musically accomplished, CD yet from this hard-not-to-like Canadian band.&quot;

==Track listing==
As with many of the band&#x27;s albums, the songwriting is credited to varying combinations of the band members: Martin Tielli, Dave Bidini and Tim Vesely.

<text>The Nightlines Sessions is a 1998 album by Rheostatics.

The album was recorded as a live session for the final episode of CBC Stereo&#x27;s late night music program &quot;Night Lines&quot;, hosted by David Wisdom. It is a largely tossed-off and improvised affair, showing the band indulging their silly sides. It is an enjoyable diversion for fans, but even the band acknowledges that casual listeners will likely find it weird and unlistenable.

The session aired on August 31, 1997.

One song from the session, &quot;Stolen Car&quot;, had appeared on an earlier Rheostatics album (1997&#x27;s &quot;Double Live&quot;). Another song, &quot;The Junction Foil Ball&quot;, was rerecorded for the later &quot;Night of the Shooting Stars&quot;.

==Track listing==
As with many of the band&#x27;s albums, songwriting is credited to varying combinations of the band members: Martin Tielli, Dave Bidini and Tim Vesely. (Don Kerr does not receive songwriting credits.) Credits for each song are listed next to the title.

<doc id="1217373" wikidata="Q224101" url="?curid=1217373" title="Guanabara Bay">
<text>Guanabara Bay (, , ) is an oceanic bay located in Southeast Brazil in the state of Rio de Janeiro. On its western shore lie the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Duque de Caxias, and on its eastern shore are the cities of Niterói and São Gonçalo. Four other municipalities surround the bay&#x27;s shores. Guanabara Bay is the second largest bay in area in Brazil (after the All Saints&#x27; Bay), at , with a perimeter of .

Guanabara Bay is long and wide at its maximum. Its wide mouth is flanked at the eastern tip by the Pico do Papagaio (Parrot&#x27;s Peak) and the western tip by Pão de Açúcar (Sugar Loaf).

The name Guanabara comes from the Tupi language, &quot;goanã-pará&quot;, from &quot;gwa&quot; &quot;bay&quot;, plus &quot;nã&quot; &quot;similar to&quot; and &quot;ba&#x27;ra&quot; &quot;sea&quot;. Other glosses include &quot;hidden water&quot;, &quot;lagoon of the sea&quot;, and &quot;bosom of the sea&quot;.

==History==

Guanabara Bay was first encountered by Europeans on January 1, 1502, when Portuguese explorers Gaspar de Lemos and Gonçalo Coelho arrived on its shores. According to some historians, the name given by the exploration team to the bay was originally &quot;Ria de Janeiro&quot; (&quot;January&#x27;s Ria&quot;). Then confusion took place between the words &quot;ria&quot; and &quot;rio&quot; (&quot;river&quot;). As a result, the name of the bay was soon fixed as &quot;Rio de Janeiro&quot;.
Later, the city was named after the bay. Natives of the Tamoio and Tupiniquim tribes inhabited the shores of the bay.

After the initial arrival of the Portuguese, no significant European settlements were established until French colonists and soldiers, under the Huguenot Admiral Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon invaded the region in 1555 to establish the France Antarctique. They stayed briefly on Lajes Island, then moved to Serigipe Island, near the shore, where they built Fort Coligny. After they were expelled by Portuguese military expeditions in 1563, the colonial government built fortifications in several points of Guanabara Bay, rendering it almost impregnable against a naval attack from the sea. They were the Santa Cruz, São João, Lajes and Villegaignon forts, forming a fearsome crossfire rectangle of big naval guns. Other islands were adapted by the Navy to host naval storehouses, hospitals, drydocks, oil reservoirs and the National Naval Academy.

Underwater exploration in the bay was disallowed by the Brazilian government in 1985 amid a dispute with American writer and treasure hunter Robert Marx, who claimed to have found evidence of a Roman shipwreck. Carl Feagans tells of 16 amphorae made for antiques-lover Americo Santarelli in 1960 or 1961, all 16 of which deliberately sunk in the bay for them to acquire the look of ancient artefacts covered in barnacles and corals; 4 of the 16 original amphorae were subsequently recovered, leaving 12 scattered about the bay, where two were found by lobster divers in 1974.

==Description==

There are more than 130 islands dotting the bay, including:

* Lajes
* Ilha do Governador – site of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s Galeão - Antônio Carlos Jobim International Airport
* Ilha de Paquetá
* Ilha das Cobras
* Flores
* Ilha Fiscal
* Ilha da Boa Viagem
* Villegagnon
* Fundão

The bay is crossed by the Rio-Niterói Bridge ( long and with a central span high) and there is heavy boat and ship traffic, including regular ferryboat lines. The Port of Rio de Janeiro, as well as the city&#x27;s two airports, Galeão - Antônio Carlos Jobim International Airport (on Governador Island) and Santos Dumont Airport (on reclaimed land next to downtown Rio), are located on its shores. The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro main campus is located on the artificial Fundão Island. A maze of smaller bridges interconnect the two largest islands, Fundão and Governador, to the mainland.

There is an Environmental Protection Area (APA), which is located mostly in the municipality of Guapimirim and given the name of Guapimirim APA.

==Environment==

Guanabara Bay&#x27;s once rich and diversified ecosystem has suffered extensive damage in recent decades, particularly along its mangrove areas. The bay has been heavily impacted by urbanization, deforestation, and pollution of its waters with sewage, garbage, and oil spills. As of 2014, more than 70% of the sewage from 12 million inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro now flows into the bay untreated.

There have been three major oil spills in Guanabara Bay. The most recent was in 2000 when a leaking Petrobras underwater pipeline released of oil into the bay, destroying large swaths of the mangrove ecosystem. Recovery measures are currently being attempted, but more than a decade after the incident, the mangrove areas have not returned to life.

One of the world&#x27;s largest landfills is located at Jardim Gramacho adjacent to Guanabara Bay. It was closed in 2012 after 34 years of operation. The landfill attracted attention from environmentalists and it supported 1,700 people scavenging for recyclable materials.

In June 2014, Dutch windsurfer and former Olympic and world champion Dorian van Rijsselberghe made an urgent appeal to government and industry in the Netherlands to collaborate in cleaning up the bay, together with the Plastic Soup Foundation. The Dutch government picked up the message and formulated a Clean Urban Delta Initiative Rio de Janeiro together with a consortium of Dutch industry, knowledge institutes and NGOs which will be presented to the Brazilian authorities in the State of Rio de Janeiro.

As part of the preparations for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, the government was supposed to improve the conditions, but progress has been slow. There have been concerns that the efforts may only be short-term and abandoned following the Games, as there would be little political incentive to continue with them.

The marine ecosystem of Guanabara Bay was severely damaged; the bay was once a whaling ground, and today, whales are no longer or rarely seen while Bryde&#x27;s whales can be seen around the bay entrance. The bay is also home to a population of botos and this population faces severe risks of population decline.

<text>The Story of Harmelodia is a 1999 album by Rheostatics.

Billed as a children&#x27;s album, the album is a narrative detailing the adventures of Dot and Bug, two children from the land of Harmelodia who fall through a hole (as in &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;) into the land of Popopolis. In Harmelodia, the children attend weekly lessons where they learn highly regimented music, but in Popopolis, they learn to make music using their own creativity on fantastical instruments such as the &quot;wingophone&quot;.

The album is based on a story by Dave Bidini, and is packaged in a book containing Bidini&#x27;s text with illustrations by Martin Tielli. Narration on the album is by Bidini&#x27;s wife, Janet Morassutti.

A different version of &quot;Song of the Garden&quot; was recorded for the band&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Night of the Shooting Stars&quot;.

Guest musicians on the album include Sarah Harmer, Kurt Swinghammer, Mia Sheard and Kevin Hearn. It is also the only Rheostatics album which includes a songwriting credit for Don Kerr, the band&#x27;s drummer from 1995 to 2001.

==Other notes==

In 2004, Centennial Secondary School in Belleville, Ontario created and performed a stage musical version of the album. The show itself did a trial at the legendary Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto.

<text>2067 is a 2004 album by Canadian indie rock band Rheostatics. It was the band&#x27;s first album with longtime producer Michael Phillip Wojewoda as an official member, as well as its final studio album for 15 years. The album was billed as a concept album imagining Canada on the 200th anniversary of Canadian Confederation in 1867, although this concept is only loosely evident in the album itself.

The album was released on True North Records. It contains a hidden track which is officially billed as a &quot;mystery song&quot;; it is in fact a revamped synthpop version of one of the band&#x27;s first notable singles, &quot;Record Body Count&quot; (from 1991&#x27;s &quot;Melville&quot;).

The first single from the album was &quot;Marginalized&quot;. The second single, &quot;The Tarleks&quot;, was loosely inspired by the character of Herb Tarlek from the 1970s sitcom &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;. Frank Bonner, who played Tarlek in the series, reprises that role in the WorldFest-Houston Gold Award-winning video.

<text>Tinea capitis (also known as &quot;herpes tonsurans&quot;, &quot;ringworm of the hair&quot;, &quot;ringworm of the scalp&quot;, &quot;scalp ringworm&quot;, and &quot;tinea tonsurans&quot;) is a cutaneous fungal infection (dermatophytosis) of the scalp. The disease is primarily caused by dermatophytes in the genera &quot;Trichophyton&quot; and &quot;Microsporum&quot; that invade the hair shaft. The clinical presentation is typically single or multiple patches of hair loss, sometimes with a &#x27;black dot&#x27; pattern (often with broken-off hairs), that may be accompanied by inflammation, scaling, pustules, and itching. Uncommon in adults, tinea capitis is predominantly seen in pre-pubertal children, more often boys than girls.

At least eight species of dermatophytes are associated with tinea capitis. Cases of &quot;Trichophyton&quot; infection predominate from Central America to the United States and in parts of Western Europe. Infections from &quot;Microsporum&quot; species are mainly in South America, Southern and Central Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The disease is infectious and can be transmitted by humans, animals, or objects that harbor the fungus. The fungus can also exist in a carrier state on the scalp, without clinical symptomatology. Treatment of tinea capitis requires an oral antifungal agent; griseofulvin is the most commonly used drug, but other newer antimycotic drugs, such as terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole have started to gain acceptance.

==Symptoms==

It may appear as thickened, scaly, and sometimes boggy swellings, or as expanding raised red rings (ringworm). Common symptoms are severe itching of the scalp, dandruff, and bald patches where the fungus has rooted itself in the skin. It often presents identically to dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis. The highest incidence in the United States of America is in American boys of school age.

There are three type of tinea capitis, microsporosis, trichophytosis, and favus; these are based on the causative microorganism, and the nature of the symptoms. In &quot;microsporosis&quot;, the lesion is a small red papule around a hair shaft that later becomes scaly; eventually the hairs break off 1–3 mm above the scalp. This disease used to be caused primarily by &quot;Microsporum audouinii&quot;, but in Europe, &quot;M. canis&quot; is more frequently the causative fungus. The source of this fungus is typically sick cats and kittens; it may be spread through person to person contact, or by sharing contaminated brushes and combs. In the United States, &quot;Trichophytosis&quot; is usually caused by &quot;Trichophyton tonsurans&quot;, while &quot;T. violaceum&quot; is more common in Eastern Europe, Africa, and India. This fungus causes dry, non-inflammatory patches that tend to be angular in shape. When the hairs break off at the opening of the follicle, black dots remain. &quot;Favus&quot; is caused by &quot;T. schoenleinii&quot;, and is endemic in South Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by a number of yellowish, circular, cup-shaped crusts (scutula) grouped in patches like a piece of honeycomb, each about the size of a split pea, with a hair projecting in the center. These increase in size and become crusted over, so that the characteristic lesion can only be seen around the edge of the scab.

==Pathophysiology==
From the site of inoculation, the fungus grows down into the stratum corneum, where it invades keratin. Dermatophytes are unique in that they produce keratinase, which enables them to use keratin as a nutrient source. Infected hairs become brittle, and after three weeks, the clinical presentation of broken hairs is evident.

There are three types of infection:

Ectothrix: Characterized by the growth of fungal spores (arthroconidia) on the exterior of the hair shaft.  Infected hairs usually fluoresce greenish-yellow under a Wood&#x27;s lamp (blacklight). Associated with &quot;Microsporum canis&quot;, &quot;Microsporum gypseum&quot;, &quot;Trichophyton equinum&quot;, and &quot;Trichophyton verrucosum&quot;.

Endothrix: Similar to ectothrix, but characterized by arthroconidia restricted to the hair shaft, and restricted to anthropophilic bacteria.  The cuticle of the hair remains intact and clinically this type does not have fluorescence.  Associated with &quot;Trichophyton tonsurans&quot; and &quot;Trichophyton violaceum&quot;, which are anthropophilic.

Favus: Causes crusting on the surface of the skin, combined with hair loss.  Associated with &quot;Trichophyton schoenleini&quot;.

==Diagnosis==
Tinea capitis may be difficult to distinguish from other skin diseases that cause scaling, such as psoriasis and seborrhoeic dermatitis; the basis for the diagnosis is positive microscopic examination and microbial culture of epilated hairs. Wood&#x27;s lamp examination will reveal bright green to yellow-green fluorescence of hairs infected by &quot;M. canis&quot;, &quot;M. audouinii&quot;, &quot;M. rivalieri&quot;, and &quot;M. ferrugineum&quot; and a dull green or blue-white color of hairs infected by &quot;T. schoenleinii&quot;. Individuals with &quot;M. canis&quot; infection trichoscopy will show characteristic small comma hairs. Histopathology of scalp biopsy shows fungi sparsely distributed in the stratum corneum and hyphae extending down the hair follicle, placed on the surface of the hair shaft. These findings are occasionally associated with inflammatory tissue reaction in the local tissue.

==Treatment==
The treatment of choice by dermatologists is a safe and inexpensive oral medication, griseofulvin, a secondary metabolite of the fungus &quot;Penicillium griseofulvin&quot;. This compound is &quot;fungistatic&quot; (inhibiting the growth or reproduction of fungi) and works by affecting the microtubular system of fungi, interfering with the mitotic spindle and cytoplasmic microtubules. The recommended pediatric dosage is 10 mg/kg/day for 6–8 weeks, although this may be increased to 20 mg/kg/d for those infected by &quot;T. tonsurans&quot;, or those who fail to respond to the initial 6 weeks of treatment. Unlike other fungal skin infections that may be treated with topical therapies like creams applied directly to the affected area, griseofulvin must be taken orally to be effective; this allows the drug to penetrate the hair shaft where the fungus lives. The effective therapy rate of this treatment is generally high, in the range of 88–100%.
Other oral antifungal treatments for tinea capitis also frequently reported in the literature include terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole; these drugs have the advantage of shorter treatment durations than griseofulvin. A 2016 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole were at least equally effective as griseofulvin for children infected with &quot;Trichophyton&quot;, and terbinafine is more effective than griseofulvin for children with &quot;T. tonsurans&quot; infection&quot;.&quot; However, concerns have been raised about the possibility of rare side effects like liver toxicity or interactions with other drugs; furthermore, the newer drug treatments tend to be more expensive than griseofulvin.

On September 28, 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration stated that Lamisil (Terbinafine hydrochloride, by Novartis AG) is a new treatment approved for use by children aged 4 years and older. The antifungal granules can be sprinkled on a child&#x27;s food to treat the infection. Lamisil carries hepatotoxic risk, and can cause a metallic taste in the mouth.

==Epidemiology==

Tinea capitis caused by species of &quot;Microsporum&quot; and &quot;Trichophyton&quot; is a contagious disease that is endemic in many countries. Affecting primarily pre-pubertal children between 6 and 10 years, it is more common in males than females; rarely does the disease persist past age sixteen. Because spread is thought to occur through direct contact with affected individuals, large outbreaks have been known to occur in schools and other places where children are in close quarters; however, indirect spread through contamination with infected objects (&quot;fomites&quot;) may also be a factor in the spread of infection. In the US, tinea capitis is thought to occur in 3-8% of the pediatric population; up to one-third of households with contact with an infected person may harbor the disease without showing any symptoms.

The fungal species responsible for causing tinea capitis vary according to the geographical region, and may also change over time. For example, &quot;Microsporum audouinii&quot; was the predominant etiological agent in North America and Europe until the 1950s, but now &quot;Trichophyton tonsurans&quot; is more common in the US, and becoming more common in Europe and the United Kingdom. This shift is thought to be due to the widespread use of griseofulvin, which is more effective against &quot;M. audounii&quot; than &quot;T. tonsurans&quot;; also, changes in immigration patterns and increases in international travel have likely spread &quot;T. tonsurans&quot; to new areas. Another fungal species that has increased in prevalence is &quot;Trichophyton violaceum&quot;, especially in urban populations of the United Kingdom and Europe.

Buses ply to all major towns and cities within Tamil Nadu and neighboring state of Karnataka. KSRTC buses also connect to the town due to its proximity to Karnataka.

The nearest major railway station is Erode Junction located from the town. A proposal to construct a railway line connecting Mysore with Erode via Gobichettipalayam was mooted during the British rule in 1915. Four official surveys were made in 1922, 1936, 1942 and as recently as 2008, but the plan failed to take off due to the concerns of railway line passing through the Sathyamangalam Wildlife Sanctuary. The nearest airport is Coimbatore International Airport, located from the town. The airport has regular flights from/to major domestic destinations and international destinations like Sharjah, Colombo and Singapore.

==Education==
Gobichettipalayam has a good educational infrastructure. Notable schools are Diamond Jubilee Higher Secondary School, established over 100 years ago and visited by Mahatma Gandhi and Shree Vidyalaya which has a full-time dyslexic center. The town is home to Gobi Arts and Science College, one of the oldest arts colleges in the state. The city itself has only a few colleges, but its proximity to Coimbatore and Erode makes it an ideal educational hub.

==Economy==

The town has been described by the government as &quot;Bi-functional&quot;, with 31% of the work force engaged in agriculture, 56% in trading and other activities and 13% in industry.

<doc id="1217420" wikidata="Q1887877" url="?curid=1217420" title="Tinea barbae">
<text>Tinea barbae is a fungal infection of the hair. Tinea barbae is due to a dermatophytic infection around the bearded area of men. Generally, the infection occurs as a follicular inflammation, or as a cutaneous granulomatous lesion, i.e. a chronic inflammatory reaction. It is one of the causes of folliculitis. It is most common among agricultural workers, as the transmission is more common from animal-to-human than human-to-human. The most common causes are &quot;Trichophyton mentagrophytes&quot; and &quot;T. verrucosum&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==
Main symptoms that occur when affected with tinea barbae is pimple or blister amongst affected area, swelling and redness around infected area, red and lumpy skin on infected area. Crusting around hairs in infected area will occur, hairs on infected area will also be effortless to pull out. Tinea barbae can be itchy or painful to touch but these symptoms do not always occur.

== Transmission ==
The transmission of tinea barbae to humans occurs through contact of an infected animal to the skin of a human. Infection can occasionally be transmitted through contact of infected animal hair on human skin. Tinea barbae is very rarely transmitted through human to human contact but is not completely impossible.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of tinea barbae will firstly include questions being asked from doctors about interactions with farm animals and lifestyle experiences. Doctor will then gain knowledge on possible disease by microscopy, this is viewing the skin under a microscope to get an enlarge view of infected area. Skin scraping and removal of hairs on infected area will occur for medical examination. To acquire causation of tinea barbae putting infected area under ultraviolet light can achieve this, as infection caused by animal and human contact will not show up as fluorescent under the ultraviolet light, compared to other causes of this disease.

==Treatment==
Treatment can vary with severity of the infection. Moderate cases of tinea barbae can be treated with topical antifungal medications. Topical antifungal medications will come in the form of cream, which can normally be obtained over the counter. More serious cases of tinea barbae warrant an oral antifungal medication.

<text> () is the second of the two parts of an Islamic wedding It is the wedding reception banquet and is performed after the (marriage ceremony). It designates a feast in Arabic. The is used as a symbol to show domestic happiness in the household post-marriage, and to announce the marriage openly for recognition of the new couple. The walima generally takes place in the locale where the newly married couple is to reside. While cultural practices may differ, marriage expenses and costs of the walima are generally borne by the groom or his family. 
==Debate: The Time of &quot;Walima&quot;==
Scholars have different views on what the correct time of is. The timing varies by culture and opinion; for example some believe it should take place:
# At the time of the marriage contract,
# After the marriage contract and before the consummation of marriage, 
# At the time of the wedding procession (bride leaving for her husband’s house). [Ibn Hajar, Fath al-Bari, 9/287]

However, the majority of the scholars (jumhur) are of the opinion that is a meal that is prepared after the marriage has been consummated. This was the practice of the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him &amp; give him peace), as explicitly mentioned in one narration. 

Scholars are in agreement that the Walima must be organized, hosted, and paid for by the Groom&#x27;s side. 

==&quot;Translation Notes&quot;==

Walima in literal translation means &quot;to assemble&quot; and is used to describe an assembly or party celebrating a wedding. Walima is essentially interchangeable with the English terms &quot;wedding reception&quot; and &quot;celebration&quot; (when held to celebrate a marriage). The word is generally interchangeable with the various terms in other languages/cultures that essentially mean to assemble for the purposes of celebrating a marriage. While it is an Arabic term, it is not necessarily a term reserved for Muslims per se, as the word simply describes an event that celebrates a new wedding.

<doc id="1217440" wikidata="Q2006230" url="?curid=1217440" title="Soviet atomic bomb project">
<text>The Soviet atomic bomb project was authorized by Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union to develop nuclear weapons during and after World War II.

Russian physicist Georgy Flyorov suspected that the Allied powers were secretly developing a &quot;superweapon&quot; since 1939. Flyorov urged Stalin to start a nuclear program in 1942. Early efforts mostly consisted of intelligence gathering from the Soviet spy rings working in the Manhattan Project in the United States.

After Stalin learned of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the nuclear program was accelerated through intelligence gathering about the German nuclear weapon project and the American Manhattan Project. The Soviet army forced captured German scientists to assist nuclear program.

On 29 August 1949, the Soviet Union secretly conducted its first successful weapon test in Kazakhstan. 

==Early efforts==
===Background origins and roots===

As early as 1910 in Russia, independent research was being conducted on radioactive elements by several Russian scientists. Despite the hardship faced by the Russian academy of sciences during the national revolution in 1917, followed by the violent civil war in 1922, Russian scientists had made remarkable efforts toward the advancement of physics research in the Soviet Union by the 1930s. Before the first revolution in 1905, the mineralogist Vladimir Vernadsky had made a number of public calls for a survey of Russia&#x27;s uranium deposits but none were heeded. Such early efforts were independently and privately funded by various organizations until 1922 when the Radium Institute in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg) opened and industrialized the research.

From the 1920s until the late 1930s, Russian physicists had been conducting joint research with their European counterparts on the advancement of atomic physics at the Cavendish Laboratory run by a New Zealand physicist, Ernest Rutherford, where Georgi Gamov and Pyotr Kapitsa had studied and researched.

Influential research towards the advancement of nuclear physics was guided by Abram Ioffe, who was the director at the Leningrad Physical-Technical Institute (LPTI), having sponsored various research programs at various technical schools in the Soviet Union. The discovery of the neutron by the British physicist James Chadwick further provided promising expansion of the LPTI&#x27;s program, with the operation of the first cyclotron to energies of over 1 MeV, and the first &quot;splitting&quot; of the atomic nucleus by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton. Russian physicists began pushing the government, lobbying in the interest of the development of science in the Soviet Union, which had received little interest due to the upheavals created during the Russian revolution and the February Revolution. Earlier research was directed towards the medical and scientific exploration of radium; a supply of it was available as it could be retrieved from borehole water from the Ukhta oilfields.

In 1939, German chemist Otto Hahn reported his discovery of fission, achieved by the splitting of uranium with neutrons that produced the much lighter element barium. This eventually led to the realization among Russian scientists, and their American counterparts, that such reaction could have military significance. The discovery excited the Russian physicists, and they began conducting their independent investigations on nuclear fission, mainly aiming towards power generation, as many were skeptical of the possibility of creating an atomic bomb anytime soon. Early efforts were led by Yakov Frenkel (a physicist specialised on condensed matter), who did the first theoretical calculations on continuum mechanics directly relating the kinematics of binding energy in fission process in 1940. Georgy Flyorov&#x27;s and Lev Rusinov&#x27;s collaborative work on thermal reactions concluded that 3–1 neutrons were emitted per fission only days after similar conclusions had been reached by the team of Frédéric Joliot-Curie.

===World War II and accelerated feasibility===

After a strong lobbying of Russian scientists, the Soviet government initially set up a commission that was to address the &quot;uranium problem&quot; and investigate the possibility of chain reaction and isotope separation. The Uranium Problem Commission was ineffective because the German invasion of Soviet Union eventually limited the focus on research, as Russia became engaged in a bloody conflict along the Eastern Front for the next four years. The Soviet atomic weapons program had no significance, and most work was unclassified as the papers were continuously published as public domain in academic journals.

Joseph Stalin, the Soviet leader, had mostly disregarded the atomic knowledge possessed by the Russian scientists as had most of the scientists working in the metallurgy and mining industry or serving in the Soviet Armed Forces technical branches during the World War II&#x27;s eastern front in 1940–42.

In 1940–42, Georgy Flyorov, a Russian physicist serving as an officer in the Soviet Air Force, noted that despite progress in other areas of physics, the German, British, and American scientists had ceased publishing papers on nuclear science. Clearly, they each had active secret research programs. The dispersal of Soviet scientists had sent Abram Ioffe&#x27;s Radium Institute from Leningrad to Kazan; and the wartime research program put the &quot;uranium bomb&quot; programme third, after radar and anti-mine protection for ships. Kurchatov had moved from Kazan to Murmansk to work on mines for the Soviet Navy.

In April 1942, Flyorov directed two classified letters to Stalin, warning him of the consequences of the development of atomic weapons: &quot;the results will be so overriding [that] it won&#x27;t be necessary to determine who is to blame for the fact that this work has been neglected in our country.&quot; The second letter, by Flyorov and Konstantin Petrzhak, highly emphasized the importance of a &quot;uranium bomb&quot;: &quot;it is essential to manufacture a uranium bomb without a delay.&quot;

Upon reading the Flyorov letters, Stalin immediately pulled Russian physicists from their respective military services and authorized an atomic bomb project, under engineering physicist Anatoly Alexandrov and nuclear physicist Igor V. Kurchatov. For this purpose, the Laboratory No. 2 near Moscow was established under Kurchatov. Kurchatov was chosen in late 1942 as the technical director of the Soviet bomb program; he was awed by the magnitude of the task but was by no means convinced of its utility against the demands of the front. Abram Ioffe had refused the post as he was too old, and recommended the young Kurchatov.

At the same time, Flyorov was moved to Dubna, where he established the Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions, focusing on synthetic elements and thermal reactions. In late 1942, the State Defense Committee officially delegated the program to the Soviet Army, with major wartime logistical efforts later being supervised by Lavrentiy Beria, the head of NKVD.

In 1945, the Arzamas 16 site, near Moscow, was established under Yakov Zel&#x27;dovich and Yuli Khariton who performed calculations on nuclear combustion theory, alongside Isaak Pomeranchuk. Despite early and accelerated efforts, it was reported by historians that efforts on building a bomb using weapon-grade uranium seemed hopeless to Russian scientists. Igor Kurchatov had harboured doubts working towards the uranium bomb, but made progress on a bomb using weapon-grade plutonium after British data was provided by the NKVD.

The situation dramatically changed when the Soviet Union learned of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

Immediately after the atomic bombing, the Soviet Politburo took control of the atomic bomb project by establishing a special committee to oversee the development of nuclear weapons as soon as possible. On 9 April 1946, the Council of Ministers created KB–11 (&#x27;Design Bureau-11&#x27;) that worked towards mapping the first nuclear weapon design, primarily based on the American approach and detonated with weapon-grade plutonium.

Work on the program was accelerated by constructing a nuclear research reactor near Moscow which went critical for the first time on 25 October 1946. Even while this facility was still in the planning stage, a government commission inspected and approved a location east of the Urals for a plutonium production facility similar to the American Hanford Site, with nuclear production reactor much larger in size than the research reactor, combined with a radiochemical extraction factory. Constructed some fifteen miles east of the small town of Kyshtym, this plutonium production complex came to be known as Chelyabinsk-40 and later still, as Mayak.

The area was chosen in part because of its proximity to the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant which had merged during the war with the evacuated Kharkov Diesel Works and parts of the Leningrad Kirov Plant into a major tank production complex popularly known as &quot;Tankograd&quot;. To supply the complex and dozens of other armament works in the area, a huge new power station had gone up in 1942 from which electricity could be drawn. Chelyabinsk province, particularly around the small town of Kyshtym, was also a major gulag station, with some twelve forced labor camps in the area.

== Organization and administration ==
===The German assistance===

From 1941 to 1946, the Soviet Union&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs handled the logistics of the atomic bomb project, with Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov controlling the direction of the program. However, Molotov proved to be a weak administrator, and the program stagnated. In contrast to American military administration in their atomic bomb project, the Russians&#x27; program was directed by political dignitaries such as Molotov, Lavrentiy Beria, Georgii Malenkov, and Mikhail Pervukhin—there were no military members.

After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the program&#x27;s leadership changed, when Stalin appointed Lavrentiy Beria on 22 August 1945. Beria is noted for leadership that helped the program to its final implementation.

The new Committee, under Beria, retained Georgii Malenkov and added Nikolai Voznesensky and Boris Vannikov, People&#x27;s Commissar for Armament. Under the administration of Beria, the NKVD co-opted atomic spies of the Soviet Atomic Spy Ring into the American program, and infiltrated the German nuclear program whose nuclear scientists were later instrumental in attaining the feasibility of Soviet nuclear weapons. 

The German assistance and the roles of the German nuclear scientists in advancing the Soviet program is subjected to the controversy as Russians had played down their contributions or passed their research to Russian scientists.

== Espionage ==

===Soviet atomic ring===

The nuclear and industrial espionages in the United States by American sympathisers of communism who were controlled by their &quot;rezident&quot; Russian officials in North America greatly aided the speed of the Soviet nuclear program from 1942–54. The willingness in sharing classified information to the Soviet Union by recruited American communist sympathizers increased when the Soviet Union faced possible defeat during the German invasion in World War II. The Russian intelligence network in the United Kingdom also played a vital role in setting up the spy rings in the United States when the State Defense Committee approved resolution 2352 in September 1942. This resolution instructed the Academy of Sciences of Ukrainian SSR to renew research efforts on nuclear energy and uranium nuclear fission and also directed the academy to report on the possibilities of a bomb or fuel source by April 1 of the following year.

For this purpose, the spy Harry Gold, controlled by Semyon Semyonov, was used for a wide range of espionage that included industrial espionage in the American chemical industry and obtaining sensitive atomic information that was handed over to him by the British physicist Klaus Fuchs. Knowledge and further technical information that were passed by the American Theodore Hall, a theoretical physicist, and Klaus Fuchs had a significant impact on the direction of Russian development of nuclear weapons.

Leonid Kvasnikov, a Russian engineer turned KGB officer, was assigned for this special purpose and moved to New York City to coordinate such activities. Anatoli Yatzkov, another NKVD official in New York, was also involved in obtaining sensitive information gathered by Sergei Kournakov from Saville Sax.

The existence of Russian spies was exposed by the U.S. Army&#x27;s secretive Venona project in 1943.

In 1943, Molotov shared with Kurchatov the intelligence data accumulated through NKVD espionage. Kurchatov told Molotov, &quot;The materials are magnificent. They add exactly what we have been missing.&quot; According to Richard Rhodes, &quot;...Kurchatov learned enough, to transform the Soviet program...information that would accelerate the Soviet program by a full two years.&quot; This included an alternative to the problem of uranium isotope separation in making a bomb. Instead, Plutonium-239 could be used, which could be produced in a uranium-graphite pile through the absorption of neutrons by Uranium-238. Additionally, according to Kurchatov, the espionage material &quot;made us include diffusion experiments in our plans along with centrifuge.&quot;

===Soviet intelligence management in the Manhattan Project===

In 1945, the Soviet intelligence obtained rough blueprints of the first U.S. atomic device. Alexei Kojevnikov has estimated that the primary way in which the espionage may have sped up the Soviet project was that it allowed Khariton to avoid dangerous tests to determine the size of the critical mass. These tests in the U.S., known as &quot;tickling the dragon&#x27;s tail&quot;, consumed a good deal of time and claimed at least two lives; see Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin.

The published Smyth Report of 1945 on the Manhattan Project was translated into Russian, and the translators noted that a sentence on the effect of &quot;poisoning&quot; of Plutonium-239 in the first (lithograph) edition had been deleted from the next (Princeton) edition by Groves. This change was noted by the Russian translators, and alerted the Soviet Union to the problem (which had meant that reactor-bred plutonium could not be used in a simple gun-type bomb like the proposed Thin Man).

One of the key pieces of information, which Soviet intelligence obtained from Fuchs, was a cross-section for D-T fusion. This data was available to top Soviet officials roughly three years before it was openly published in the &quot;Physical Review&quot; in 1949. However, this data was not forwarded to Vitaly Ginzburg or Andrei Sakharov until very late, practically months before publication. Initially both Ginzburg and Sakharov estimated such a cross-section to be similar to the D-D reaction. Once the actual cross-section become known to Ginzburg and Sakharov, the Sloika design become a priority, which resulted in a successful test in 1953.

Comparing the timelines of H-bomb development, some researchers came to the conclusion that the Soviets had a gap in access to classified information regarding the H-bomb at least between late 1950 and some time in 1953. Earlier, e.g., in 1948, Fuchs gave the Soviets a detailed update of the classical super progress, including an idea to use lithium, but did not explain it was specifically lithium-6. By 1951 Teller accepted the fact that the &quot;classical super&quot; scheme wasn&#x27;t feasible, following results obtained by various researchers (including Stanislaw Ulam) and calculations performed by John von Neumann in late 1950.

Yet the research for the Soviet analogue of &quot;classical super&quot; continued until December 1953, when the researchers were reallocated to a new project working on what later became a true H-bomb design, based on radiation implosion. This remains an open topic for research, whether the Soviet intelligence was able to obtain any specific data on Teller–Ulam design in 1953 or early 1954. Yet, Soviet officials directed the scientists to work on a new scheme, and the entire process took less than two years, commencing around January 1954 and producing a successful test in November 1955. It also took just several months before the idea of radiation implosion was conceived, and there is no documented evidence claiming priority. It is also possible that Soviets were able to obtain a document lost by John Wheeler on a train in 1953, which reportedly contained key information about thermonuclear weapon design.

== Initial design of thermonuclear weapons ==


Early ideas of the thermonuclear bomb came from the Russian espionages in the United States, and the internal Soviet studies. Though the espionage did help the Soviet studies, the early American thermonuclear designs and concepts had substantial flaws, so it may have confused, rather than assisted, the Soviet effort to achieve the nuclear capability. The designers of the early thermonuclear bombs envisioned using an atomic bomb as a trigger to provide the needed heat and compression to initiate the thermonuclear reaction in a layer of liquid deuterium between the fissile material and the surrounding chemical high explosive. The group would realize that a lack of sufficient heat and compression of the deuterium would result in an insignificant fusion of the deuterium fuel.

The Andrei Sakharov&#x27;s study group at FIAN in 1948 came up with a second concept in which adding a shell of natural, unenriched uranium around the deuterium would increase the deuterium concentration at the uranium-deuterium boundary and the overall yield of the device, because the natural uranium would capture neutrons and itself fission as part of the thermonuclear reaction. This idea of a layered fission-fusion-fission bomb led Sakharov to call it the sloika, or layered cake. 

It was also known as the RDS-6S, or Second Idea Bomb. This second bomb idea was not a fully evolved thermonuclear bomb in the contemporary sense, but a crucial step between pure fission bombs and the thermonuclear &quot;supers&quot;. Due to the three-year lag in making the key breakthrough of radiation compression from the United States the Soviet Union&#x27;s development efforts followed a different course of action. In the United States they decided to skip the single-stage fusion bomb and make a two-stage fusion bomb as their main effort. Unlike the Soviet Union, the analog RDS-7 advanced fission bomb was not further developed, and instead, the single-stage 400-kiloton RDS-6S was the Soviet&#x27;s bomb of choice.

The RDS-6S Layer Cake design was detonated on 12 August 1953, in a test given the code name by the Allies of &quot;Joe 4&quot;. The test produced a yield of 400 kilotons, about ten times more powerful than any previous Soviet test. Around this time the United States detonated its first super using radiation compression on 1 November 1952, code-named Mike. Though the Mike was about twenty times greater than the RDS-6S, it was not a design that was practical to use, unlike the RDS-6S.

Following the successful launching of the RDS-6S, Sakharov proposed an upgraded version called RDS-6SD. This bomb was proved to be faulty, and it was neither built nor tested. The Soviet team had been working on the RDS-6T concept, but it also proved to be a dead end.

In 1954, Sakharov worked on a third concept, a two-stage thermonuclear bomb. The third idea used the radiation wave of a fission bomb, not simply heat and compression, to ignite the fusion reaction, and paralleled the discovery made by Ulam and Teller. Unlike the RDS-6S boosted bomb, which placed the fusion fuel inside the primary A-bomb trigger, the thermonuclear super placed the fusion fuel in a secondary structure a small distance from the A-bomb trigger, where it was compressed and ignited by the A-bomb&#x27;s x-ray radiation. The KB-11 Scientific-Technical Council approved plans to proceed with the design on 24 December 1954. Technical specifications for the new bomb were completed on 3 February 1955, and it was designated the RDS-37.

The RDS-37 was successfully tested on 22 November 1955 with a yield of 1.6 megaton. The yield was almost a hundred times greater than the first Soviet atomic bomb six years before, showing that the Soviet Union could compete with the United States, and would even exceed them in time.

== Logistics ==


=== Mining of raw uranium ===
The single largest problem during the early Soviet program was the procurement of raw uranium ore, as the Soviet Union had limited domestic sources at the beginning of their nuclear program. The era of domestic uranium mining can be dated exactly, to November 27, 1942, the date of a directive issued by the all-powerful wartime State Defense Committee. The first Soviet uranium mine was established in Taboshar, present-day Tajikistan, and was producing at an annual rate of a few tons of uranium concentrate by May 1943. Taboshar was the first of many officially secret Soviet closed cities related to uranium mining and production.

Demand from the experimental bomb project was far higher. The Americans, with the help of Belgian businessman Edgar Sengier in 1940, had already blocked access to known sources in Congo, South Africa, and Canada. In December 1944 Stalin took the uranium project away from Vyacheslav Molotov and gave to it to Lavrentiy Beria. The first Soviet uranium processing plant was established as the Leninabad Mining and Chemical Combine in Chkalovsk (present-day Buston, Ghafurov District), Tajikistan, and new production sites identified in relative proximity. This posed a need for labor, a need that Beria would fill with forced labor: tens of thousands of Gulag prisoners were brought to work in the mines, the processing plants, and related construction.

Domestic production was still insufficient when the Soviet F-1 reactor, which began operation in December 1946, was fueled using uranium confiscated from the remains of the German atomic bomb project. This uranium had been mined in the Belgian Congo, and the ore in Belgium fell into the hands of the Germans after their invasion and occupation of Belgium in 1940. In 1945, the Uranium enrichment through electromagnetic method under Lev Artsimovich also failed due to USSR&#x27;s inability to build the parallel American Oak Ridge site and the limited power grid system could not produce the electricity for their program.

Further sources of uranium in the early years of the program were mines in East Germany (via the deceptively-named SAG Wismut), Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania (the Băița mine near Ștei) and Poland. Boris Pregel sold 0.23 tonnes of uranium oxide to the Soviet Union during the war, with the authorisation of the U.S. Government.

Eventually, large domestic sources were discovered in the Soviet Union (including those now in Kazakhstan).

The uranium for the Soviet nuclear weapons program came from mine production in the following countries,

=== Plutonium production ===
Reactors in italics were built for tritium production.
== Important nuclear tests ==

=== RDS-1 ===
The RDS-1, (Russian: PДC), was the first Soviet nuclear device that was test fired in Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan on August 29, 1949. The first nuclear test, that proved the Russia&#x27;s nuclear capability, has many codenames within Russian political community including the internally code-named &quot;First Lightning&quot; (&quot;Первая молния&quot;, or Pervaya Molniya).

Nonetheless, the test was widely known as &quot;RDS-1&quot; (&quot;Россия делает сама,&quot; Rossiya Delayet Sama, which translate as &quot;Russia Does it Herself&quot;), which was suggested by Igor Kurchatov– all Russian nuclear tests were then followed the &quot;RDS&quot; nomenclature. The Americans codenamed the test as &quot;Joe 1&quot;. The energy yield measurement and its design was mostly based on the American design &quot;Fat Man&quot;, using a TNT/hexogen implosion lens design.

=== RDS-2 ===

The RDS-2 was a second important nuclear test that was conducted on September 24, 1951. The Soviet physicists measured the energy yield of the device at the 38.3 kiloton; this device based on a tritium &quot;boosted&quot; uranium implosion device with a levitated core. The U.S. codenamed the test as &quot;Joe-2&quot;.

=== RDS-3 ===

The RDS-3 was a third nuclear explosive device that was test fired on October 18, 1951, also in Semipalatinsk. Known as &quot;Joe 3&quot; in America, this was a boosted fission device using a composite construction of levitated plutonium core and a uranium-235 shell with estimated blast yield of 41.2 kt. The &quot;RDS-3&quot; was also distinguished of being the first Russian air-dropped bomb test which was released at an altitude of 10 km, it detonated 400 meters above the ground.

=== RDS-4 ===
RDS-4 represented a branch of research on small tactical weapons. It was a boosted fission device using plutonium in a &quot;levitated&quot; core design. The first test was an air drop on August 23, 1953, yielding 28 kilotons. In 1954, the bomb was also used during Snowball exercise at the Totskoye range, dropped by Tu-4 bomber on the simulated battlefield, in the presence of 40,000 infantry, tanks, and jet fighters. The RDS-4 comprised the warhead of the R-5M, the first medium-range ballistic missile in the world, which was tested with a live warhead for the first and only time on February 5, 1956

=== RDS-5 ===
RDS-5 was a small plutonium based device, probably using a hollow core. Two different versions were made and tested.

=== RDS-6 ===
RDS-6, the first Soviet test of a hydrogen bomb, took place on August 12, 1953, and was nicknamed &quot;Joe 4&quot; by the Americans. It used a layer-cake design of fission and fusion fuels (uranium 235 and lithium-6 deuteride) and produced a yield of 400 kilotons. This yield was about ten times more powerful than any previous Soviet test. When developing higher level bombs, the Soviets proceeded with the RDS-6 as their main effort instead of the analog RDS-7 advanced fission bomb. This led to the third idea bomb which is the RDS-37.

=== RDS-9 ===
A much lower-power version of the RDS-4 with a 3-10 kiloton yield, the RDS-9 was developed for the T-5 nuclear torpedo. A 3.5 kiloton underwater test was performed with the torpedo on September 21, 1955.

=== RDS-37 ===
The first Soviet test of a &quot;true&quot; hydrogen bomb in the megaton range was conducted on November 22, 1955. It was dubbed &quot;RDS-37&quot; by the Soviets. It was of the multi-staged, radiation implosion thermonuclear design called &quot;Sakharov&#x27;s &quot;Third Idea&quot;&quot; in the USSR and the Teller–Ulam design in the U.S.
Joe 1, Joe 4, and RDS-37 were all tested at the Semipalatinsk Test Site in Kazakhstan.

=== Tsar Bomba (RDS-220) ===

The Tsar Bomba (Царь-бомба) was the largest, most powerful thermonuclear weapon ever detonated. It was a three-stage hydrogen bomb with a yield of about 50 megatons. This is equivalent to ten times the amount of all the explosives used in World War II combined. It was detonated on October 30, 1961, in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, and was capable of approximately 100 megatons, but was purposely reduced shortly before the launch. Although weaponized, it was not entered into service; it was simply a demonstrative testing of the capabilities of the Soviet Union&#x27;s military technology at that time. The heat of the explosion was estimated to potentially inflict third degree burns at 100 km distance of clear air.

=== Chagan ===

Chagan was a shot in the Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy (also known as Project 7), the Soviet equivalent of the US &quot;Operation Plowshare&quot; to investigate peaceful uses of nuclear weapons. It was a subsurface detonation. It was fired on January 15, 1965. The site was a dry bed of the river Chagan at the edge of the Semipalatinsk Test Site, and was chosen such that the lip of the crater would dam the river during its high spring flow. The resultant crater had a diameter of 408 meters and was 100 meters deep. A major lake (10,000 m3) soon formed behind the 20–35 m high upraised lip, known as &quot;Chagan Lake&quot; or &quot;Balapan Lake&quot;.

The photo is sometimes confused with RDS-1 in literature.

== Secret cities ==
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union created at least nine closed cities, known as Atomgrads, in which nuclear weapons-related research and development took place. The code names were generally given by the name of the nearest large city, suffixed with the last two digits of the postcode. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, all of the cities changed their names. All are still legally &quot;closed&quot;, though some have parts of them accessible to foreign visitors with special permits (Sarov, Snezhinsk, and Zheleznogorsk).

== Environmental and public health effects ==

The Soviets started experimenting with nuclear technology in 1943 with very little regard of nuclear safety as there were no reports of accidents that were ever made public to learn from, and the public was kept in hidden about the radiation dangers. Many of the nuclear devices left behind radioactive isotopes which have contaminated air, water and soil in the areas immediately surrounding, downwind and downstream of the blast site. According to the records that the Russian government released in 1991, the Soviet Union tested 969 nuclear devices between 1949 and 1990— more nuclear testing than any nation on the planet. Soviet scientists conducted the tests with little regard for environmental and public health consequences. The detrimental effects that the toxic waste generated by weapons testing and processing of radioactive materials are still felt to this day. Even decades later, the risk of developing various types of cancer, especially that of the thyroid and the lungs, continues to be elevated far above national averages for people in affected areas. Iodine-131, a radioactive isotope that is a major byproduct of fission-based weapons, is retained in the thyroid gland, and so poisoning of this kind is commonplace in impacted populations.

The Soviets set off 214 nuclear devices in the open atmosphere between 1949 and 1963, the year the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty came into effect (there were no Soviet tests in 1950, 1959, 1960, or 1962). The billions of radioactive particles released into the air exposed countless people to extremely mutagenic and carcinogenic materials, resulting in a myriad of deleterious genetic maladies and deformities. The majority of these tests took place at the Semipalatinsk Test Site, or the Polygon, located in northeast of Kazakhstan. The testing at Semipalatinsk alone exposed hundreds of thousands of Kazakh citizens to the harmful effects, and the site continues to be one of the most highly irradiated places on the planet. When the earliest tests were being conducted, even the scientists had only a poor understanding of the medium-and long-term effects of radiation exposure— many did not notify each other of their work if they had serious accidents or expose of radiation. In fact, the Semipalatinsk was chosen as the primary site for open-air testing precisely because the Soviets were curious about the potential for lasting harm that their weapons held.

Contamination of air and soil due to atmospheric testing is only part of a wider issue. Water contamination due to improper disposal of spent uranium and decay of sunken nuclear-powered submarines is a major problem in the Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia. Although the Russian government states that the radioactive power cores are stable, various scientists have come forth with serious concerns about the 32,000 spent nuclear fuel elements that remain in the sunken vessels. There have been no major incidents other than the explosion and sinking of a nuclear-powered submarine in August 2000, but many international scientists are still uneasy at the prospect of the hulls eroding, releasing uranium into the sea and causing considerable contamination. Although the submarines pose an environmental risk, they have yet to cause serious harm to public health. However, water contamination in the area of the Mayak test site, especially at Lake Karachay, is extreme, and has gotten to the point where radioactive byproducts have found their way into drinking water supplies. It has been an area of concern since the early 1950s, when the Soviets began disposing of tens of millions of cubic meters of radioactive waste by pumping it into the small lake. Half a century later, in the 1990s, there are still hundreds of millions of curies of waste in the Lake, and at points contamination has been so severe that a mere half-hour of exposure to certain regions would deliver a dose of radiation sufficient to kill 50% of humans. Although the area immediately surrounding the lake is devoid of population, the lake has the potential to dry up in times of drought. Most significantly, in 1967, it dried up and winds carried radioactive dust over thousands of square kilometers, exposing at least 500,000 citizens to a range of health risks. To control dust, Soviet scientists piled concrete on top of the lake. Although this was effective in helping mediate the amount of dust, the weight of the concrete pushed radioactive materials into closer contact with standing underground groundwater. It is difficult to gauge the overall health and environmental effects of the water contamination at Lake Karachay because figures on civilian exposure are unavailable, making it hard to show causation between elevated cancer rates and radioactive pollution specifically from the lake.

Contemporary efforts to manage radioactive contamination in the former Soviet Union are few and far between. Public awareness of the past and present dangers, as well as the Russian government&#x27;s investment in current cleanup efforts, are likely dampened by the lack of media attention STS and other sites have gotten in comparison to isolated nuclear incidents such as Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island. The domestic government&#x27;s investment in cleanup measures seems to be driven by economic concerns rather than care for public health. The most significant political legislation in this area is a bill agreeing to turn the already contaminated former weapons complex Mayak into an international radioactive waste dump, accepting cash from other countries in exchange for taking their radioactive byproducts of nuclear industry. Although the bill stipulates that the revenue go towards decontaminating other test sites such as Semipalatinsk and the Kola Peninsula, experts doubt whether this will actually happen given the current political and economic climate in Russia.

<text>Peter Gennaro (November 23, 1919 – September 28, 2000) was an American dancer and choreographer.

==Biography==
Gennaro was born in Metairie, Louisiana. He made his Broadway debut in the ensemble of &quot;Make Mine Manhattan&quot; in 1948. He followed this with &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; (1948) and &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1950). He first drew notice from theatergoers as a member of the trio that danced the Bob Fosse number &quot;Steam Heat&quot; in &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; (1954), and continued to hold their attention with the &quot;Mu Cha Cha&quot; number with Judy Holliday in &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; (1956). A year later, he broke out of the chorus line and into choreography when he collaborated with Jerome Robbins on &quot;West Side Story&quot;, notably choreographing (without credit) a majority of the &quot;America&quot; and &quot;Mambo&quot; dance sequences.

In addition to his theater chores, Gennaro worked steadily in television, appearing in and/or choreographing such shows as &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;, &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;, Judy Garland&#x27;s CBS variety program, and the Kraft Music Hall. With his dance troupe, he was a guest on Ed Sullivan&#x27;s CBS Sunday night variety show dozens of times, and was a member of the regular repertory company on the short-lived CBS variety show &quot;The Entertainers&quot; (1964–1965), which starred, among others, Ruth Buzzi, Carol Burnett, John Davidson and Bob Newhart. He also served for many years as choreographer for Radio City Music Hall, staging routines for The Rockettes.

He was inducted, posthumously, into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 2002.

===Personal life===
Gennaro met his wife, Jean Kinsella, while working in Chicago and the two married in 1948. His daughter, Liza, is also a dancer and choreographer and Dean of Musical Theatre at Manhattan School of Music. His son Michael is the Executive Director for Trinity Repertory Company and previously served as executive director of both the Steppenwolf Theatre Company and the Paper Mill Playhouse. The family lived for a time in Paramus, New Jersey up to 1972. 

Gennaro died in New York City on September 28, 2000, age 80. He is survived by wife, Jean, daughter, Liza, and son, Michael.

<text>In comic books and other stories with a long history, first appearance refers to the first issue to feature a fictional character. These issues are often highly valued by collectors due to their rarity and iconic status.

==Reader interest in first appearances==
Collectors value first appearances for their rarity and historical value, while many regular readers are interested in viewing how their favorite characters were originally portrayed. Reprints of first appearances are often published, both as single comic books and in trade paperbacks, usually with other early appearances of the character. Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Essential&quot; line has become popular by giving readers an affordable glimpse into characters&#x27; early history.

Historically, first appearances tell the origin story for the character, although some, such as Batman and Green Goblin, remained dubious figures for several issues. Modern writers prefer to tell a character&#x27;s origin across an entire story arc or keep a newly introduced character mysterious until a &quot;secret origin&quot; issue. Some fans consider this a gimmick and prefer the older method.

The artistic merit of many first appearances is debatable. The events portrayed in most famous first appearances are continuously retconed, rebooted, or expanded upon by subsequent writers. Like many golden and silver age comics, first appearances often become dated and do not fit the modern portrayal of the character.

However, some first appearances are considered classics. 1990s-era Spider-Man writer Howard Mackie said that his favorite story featuring the character was his first appearance and origin story in &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 (August 1962), stating that writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko &quot;gave us everything we needed, I wanted or could ask for in the least possible space. Every single person who retells the origin never improves on the original, they simply expand it.&quot;

==Monetary value of first appearance issues==
First appearances of popular characters are among the most valuable comic books in existence. Of the &quot;ten most valuable comic books&quot; listed in the spring 2002 issue of &quot;The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide&quot;, seven are first appearances of popular superheroes. Another, &quot;Marvel Comics&quot; #1 (October 1939), is the first appearance of the Golden Age Human Torch, but is more noteworthy as the first comic published by Marvel Comics.

It can take many years for a character to attain sufficient popularity after their first appearance to be considered &quot;iconic.&quot; By the point a character reaches that level of popularity, it is common for few copies of their first appearance issues to remain. Furthermore, even fewer of those remaining copies will be in the pristine condition prized by collectors. What few remain can be worth thousands of dollars to interested collectors. For example, in 2004, a copy of &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #1 (January 1940), the first appearance of The Flash, was auctioned for $42,000 and a copy of &quot;Captain America Comics&quot; #1 (March 1941), the first appearance of Captain America sold for $64,400. In 2010, another copy of &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #1 sold privately for $450,000.

The first appearance of Superman, &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 (June 1938), has been regarded as the &quot;holy grail&quot; of comic books due to its cultural significance and rarity; fewer than one hundred copies are thought to exist. Superman is widely considered to have solidified, if not created, the superhero archetype; therefore, his first appearance is not only important to fans of the character but to fans of superheroes and comic books as a whole. Well-preserved copies of &quot;Action&quot; &quot;Comics&quot; #1 have been sold at auction for record-breaking prices. A copy graded at 8.0 (&quot;very fine&quot;) on the 10-point scale typically used by collectors was sold at auction for $1,000,000 in 2010. Even a copy graded at a much lower 5.5 (&quot;fine minus&quot;) sold for $956,000 in 2016.

Shortly after the record-breaking million-dollar sale of &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 in 2010, a copy of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #27 featuring the first appearance of Batman was sold for $1,075,000 in a Heritage auction.

Several factors determine the value of a first appearance. All values are according to ComicsPriceGuide.com and are for editions certified by the Certified Collectibles Group (see below):
*The importance of the character(s) that debuted; the first appearance of Spider-Man in fine condition is listed at $45,150; the first appearance of the similarly popular Iron Man, in the same condition, is listed at $3,837; and the first appearances of most characters are not valued significantly higher than other comics published the same month.
*The rarity of comic book itself; comics from the Golden Age are usually more valuable than later comic books because they are older and fewer copies survive. Spider-Man is more popular than The Spectre but Spider-Man&#x27;s 1962 first appearance is valued at $45,150 while a copy of The Spectre&#x27;s 1940 debut, in fine condition, is valued at $54,000. Also, first appearances often lack value if they are relatively recent issues of high-profile, best-selling titles. Except during a 1990s collector&#x27;s bubble, the first appearances of several Image Comics characters and newer X-Men have not been as valuable as one may expect for such popular characters because those comics were widely produced.
*Other reasons for historical importance; &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; (November 1961) #1 is not only the first appearance of the eponymous group but also represents a turning point in the history of Marvel Comics and is the first issue of a long-running series.
*Occasionally, a comic book is the first appearance of more than one important character. Usually the characters are related; &quot;X-Men&quot; #1 (September 1963) introduced the X-Men and their archenemy Magneto. However, rarely a comic book is the first appearance of two unrelated, important characters. &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; #73 (November 1941) introduced both Green Arrow and Aquaman, who have little relation to one another. This is also the case with &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1, which contained the first appearances of Zatara and Tex Thompson, as well as Superman.
*Occasionally a first appearance will lack the value expected for a character of such stature because the debut was not splashy. Wonder Woman, a popular and historically important hero, debuted in the anthology title &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #8 (December 1941), and was not featured on the cover. This issue is valued at $30,000 in fine condition. Comparatively, the first appearances of equally (or even less) important peers Green Lantern and The Flash, boldly introduced on their covers, are worth $131,250 and $69,000, respectively. Arguably, the first appearance of Wonder Woman is worth much less because she did not make a flashy debut that lent the comic book an air of history.
*As is the case with all collectibles, condition greatly affects the value of comic books, although considerable wear is expected for decades-old comics. Most comic books are worth more if their condition is certified and they are protectively packaged (or &quot;slabbed&quot;) by the Certified Collectibles Group, a professional grading service involved in the sale of most high-value comic books, although some fans accuse the group of inflating the value of comics.

==Ambiguous cases==
While seemingly a simple concept, determining the first appearance may be complex. The following are instances in which a character&#x27;s first appearance may be difficult to determine:
*Those unfamiliar to comics may assume that Iron Man&#x27;s first appearance is &quot;The Invincible Iron Man&quot; #1 (May 1968). However, in the golden and early silver ages of comic books, few superheroes debuted in magazines carrying their names. More often a character first appeared in a generically titled anthology series. If the character proved popular, a new series was launched. For example, Iron Man first appeared in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #39 (March 1963) and appeared regularly in that series for five years before Marvel launched a series properly named &quot;Iron Man&quot;. Wonder Woman, Spider-Man, Thor, and many others also first appeared in anthology series.
*The first appearance of &quot;all-star&quot; teams is given as the first instance in which that team banded together regardless of whether or not it consists of previously existing characters. The first appearance of The Justice League of America is considered &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #28 (May 1960), the issue in which they first operated as a group, although none of its members first appeared in that issue. Alternatively, &quot;X-Men&quot; #1 (September 1963) is both the first appearance of the X-Men and its original members.
*Sometimes a character first appears in the last page of an issue, foreshadowing his or her greater role in the next issue. Arguments can ensue over whether the first appearance is the issue containing the final page cameo or the subsequent issue which more adequately introduced the character. Wolverine was first seen in the last page of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #180 (October 1974) but makes a more full appearance in issue #181 (November 1974). Stricter fans may consider &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #180 Wolverine&#x27;s first appearance but most consider it #181. ComicsPriceGuide.com lists a copy of issue #180, rated very fine, at $149 and #181 at $2,075. Comparatively, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #179 (September 1974), which has no special importance, is listed at $11, so both types of first appearance add value to a comic book.
*Retconning can also complicate first appearances. Initially, Cable was portrayed as a wholly new character, first appearing in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #87 (March 1990). However, writers later changed his background, stating that Cable is an adult, time-traveling Nathan Summers, the son of Cyclops and Madelyne Pryor, first seen in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #201 (January 1986). Both issues could be given as the first appearance of Cable. Further complicating the matter, Cable was seen in a cameo at the end of &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #86 (February 1990).
*Some superhero identities are used by more than one character. The original Green Lantern first appeared in &quot;All-American Comics&quot; #16 (April 1940). During the Silver Age, Green Lantern, like many DC heroes, was rebooted with a totally new identity. The second Green Lantern, Hal Jordan, debuted in &quot;Showcase&quot; #22 (October 1959). &quot;All-American Comics&quot; #16 is still considered the first appearance of Green Lantern, both of the original title-bearer and the superhero identity itself. To avoid confusion, &quot;Showcase&quot; #22 is called the first appearance of Hal Jordan, of Green Lantern II or of the Silver Age Green Lantern.
*Occasionally, a character will appear in the background of a comic book before fully introduced. Spider-Man&#x27;s early love interest Liz Allan is first addressed by name in &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #4 (September 1963). However, an unnamed character in &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #1 (March 1963) is, based on her appearance and dialogue, probably Allan. Plus, &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 (August 1962), shows an unnamed, unspeaking character who looks exactly like Allan. Thus Allan&#x27;s first appearance may be given as any of the three.
*Some characters appear in more than one continuity. While the first appearance of Nightcrawler is &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1 (May 1975), the first appearance of &quot;Ultimate Nightcrawler&quot; (Nightcrawler in the alternate Ultimate Marvel universe) is &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #6 (August 2001).
*Sometimes new characters are created for television or film adaptations of a franchise and are later added to the comic book continuity. The Batman adversary Harley Quinn debuted in the 1992 &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Joker&#x27;s Favor&quot;. Her first appearance in comic format was the graphic novel &quot;The Batman Adventures #12&quot;, which took place in the continuity of &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot;. Her first appearance in the regular &quot;DC Universe&quot; was the 1999 one-shot &quot;Batman: Harley Quinn&quot;. Thus, her first appearance is technically &quot;Joker&#x27;s Favor&quot;, her first appearance in a comic book was &quot;The Batman Adventures #12&quot; and her first appearance in the regular DC Comics continuity was &quot;Batman: Harley Quinn&quot;. Similarly, Firestar first appeared in &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot; #1, which adapted the first episode of the TV series. Her first Earth-616 appearance was in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #193.
*Rarely, a character debuts in a publisher&#x27;s foreign branch and then appears in a domestic series. Psylocke first appeared in &quot;Captain Britain&quot; #8 (December 1976), an original series of Marvel UK not widely available outside Great Britain. Her debut in an American series was &quot;The New Mutants Annual&quot; #2 (1986). Her first appearance is sometimes given as either but more correctly it is &quot;Captain Britain&quot; #8 while &quot;The New Mutants Annual&quot; #2 is her first US appearance.
*Some characters appear first in a normal supporting role before becoming a superhero or villain. For example, Roderick Kingsley first appeared as a minor supporting character in &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; #43 (June 1980). However, he would later take on the villainous role of the Hobgoblin in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #238 (March 1983), becoming one of Spider-Man&#x27;s most dangerous foes. The latter issue, featuring his first appearance as the Hobgoblin, is worth quite more than his original debut.

==Notes==
* Nicolas Cage&#x27;s 9.0 graded &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 sold in 2011.
* &quot;Batman&quot; #1, the first appearance of the Joker and Catwoman, is especially valuable since it is also the first issue of a long-running series and the first comic book to bear Batman&#x27;s name as its title.

<doc id="1217453" wikidata="Q4732053" url="?curid=1217453" title="Allentown (song)">
<text>&quot;Allentown&quot; is a song by American singer Billy Joel and the lead track on Joel&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;The Nylon Curtain&quot;. Released as the album&#x27;s second single, it was accompanied by a conceptual music video. Upon its release, and especially in subsequent years, &quot;Allentown&quot; emerged as an anthem of blue-collar America, representing both the aspirations and frustrations of America&#x27;s working class in the late 20th century. 

&quot;Allentown&quot; reached No. 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, spending six consecutive weeks at that position and certified gold. It was No. 43 on Billboard&#x27;s year-end Hot 100 chart for 1983. The song later appeared on Joel&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits: Volume II&quot; (1985), &quot;Концерт&quot; (1987), &quot;2000 Years: The Millennium Concert&quot; (2000), &quot;The Essential Billy Joel&quot; (2001), &quot;12 Gardens Live&quot; (2006), &quot;The Hits&quot; (2010), and &quot;Live at Shea Stadium&quot; (2011) albums.

==Theme==

The song&#x27;s theme centers around the resilience of Allentown, Pennsylvania and the surrounding Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania in the 1980s as it coped with the decline of its historically strong manufacturing sector and its emergence as a part of the Rust Belt in the latter part of the 20th century, including the depressed, blue-collar livelihood of Allentown residents following the decline and eventual closure of Bethlehem Steel, which was the world&#x27;s second-largest steel manufacturer for most of the 20th century.

The introductory rhythm for the song is designed to be the sound of a rolling mill converting steel ingots into I-beams or other shapes. Such a sound was commonly heard throughout South Bethlehem when the Bethlehem Steel plant was in operation from 1857 through 1995.

Joel regards the song as being &quot;hopeful&quot; towards the plight of the unemployed steel workers. Even though the lyrics tell a sad tale, Joel says the song&#x27;s message is &quot;we&#x27;re not moving out or giving up...we&#x27;re going to try.&quot;

==History==
When Joel started writing the song, it was titled &quot;Levittown,&quot; after the Long Island town next to Hicksville where Joel grew up. He originally wrote a chord progression and lyrics for the song, but struggled for a topic for the song. Joel remembered reading about the decline of the steel industry in the Lehigh Valley, which includes the cities of both Bethlehem and Allentown. Joel then changed the title to &quot;Bethlehem&quot; briefly, before switching to &quot;Allentown&quot; saying that Bethlehem carried too much of a religious connotation and he liked the rhyming potential of Allentown better anyway. Although Joel started writing the song in the late 1970s, it was not finished until 1982. The booklet in the 2-CD set &quot;Greatest Hits Volumes 1 and 2&quot; lists the song as &quot;copyrighted 1981&quot; on page 17. 

When Joel performed the song in Leningrad during a 1987 concert in the Soviet Union that was recorded and later released as &quot;Концерт&quot;, he introduced the song by analogizing the situation to that then faced by Soviet youths: &quot;This song is about young people living in the Northeast of America. Their lives are miserable because the steel factories are closing down. They desperately want to leave... but they stay because they were brought up to believe that things were going to get better. Maybe that sounds familiar.&quot;

==Critical reception==
In November 1982, &quot;Cashbox&quot; wrote that, &quot;The melody is a great deal more upbeat than the lyrics would indicate, but the message comes through nonetheless.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; said that &quot;it uses expert pop structure to put over a message of bleak suburban despair.&quot;

==Reception in Allentown==
The song met with mixed responses in Allentown. Some criticized the song as degrading and full of working-class stereotypes. But when Joel returned to the area after the album&#x27;s release and the song became a hit, he was awarded the key to the city by Allentown&#x27;s mayor, who praised it as &quot;a gritty song about a gritty city.&quot;

On December 27, 1982, Joel played before a sold-out crowd at Stabler Arena in neighboring Bethlehem. He opened and closed his set at Stabler Arena with &quot;Allentown,&quot; receiving a five-minute standing ovation following its second performance. At the end of the song and ovation, Joel was greeted with even more sustained applause when, in an apparent defense of the song&#x27;s meaning, he pointedly told the Bethlehem crowd, &quot;Don&#x27;t take any shit from anybody.&quot; 

Also in 1983, Allentown&#x27;s mayor Joseph Daddona sent a letter to Joel inquiring about Joel&#x27;s willingness to share some royalties from the song for music scholarships in Allentown. Part of the letter read: &quot;Not only would this fund be a great way to share a tiny part of your good fortune to others in Allentown, it would also help keep alive the &#x27;Allentown&#x27; song and the Billy Joel legend (which you&#x27;ve already become here).&quot;

==Music video==
The video, directed by Russell Mulcahy and featuring choreography by Kenny Ortega, was in heavy rotation on MTV throughout 1982 and 1983. The original version of the video features partial male nudity at the beginning when male coal miners are taking a shower, which was edited out for its MTV airings.

==Other versions==
*&quot;Allentown&quot; also has been covered by other artists, including John Mellencamp, who performed a slower, acoustic version of the song at a Kennedy Center tribute to Billy Joel on November 19, 1994.
*In the 2011 movie &quot;The Hangover Part II&quot;, Ed Helms sings a profane, modified version of &quot;Allentown&quot; to Zach Galifianakis as they ride in a boat in Thailand. The version appears on the film&#x27;s soundtrack, &quot;The Hangover Part II: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;.

<doc id="1217460" wikidata="Q672416" url="?curid=1217460" title="Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa">
<text>The Scuola Normale Superiore (commonly known in Italy as &quot;la Normale&quot;) is a public university institution in Pisa and Florence, Tuscany, Italy, currently attended by about 600 undergraduate and postgraduate (PhD) students. Together with the University of Pisa and Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies, it is part of the Pisa University System.

It was founded in 1810 with a decree by Napoleon as a branch of the École normale supérieure in Paris, with the aim of training the teachers of the Empire to educate its citizens. In 2013 the Florentine site was added to the historical site in Pisa, following the inclusion of the Institute of Human Sciences in Florence (SUM). Since 2018 the Scuola Normale Superiore has been federated with the Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa, with the Institute for Advanced Studies of Pavia, and the Scuola Superiore Meridionale of Naples the only other three university institutions with special status that, in the Italian panorama, offer, in accordance with standards of excellence, both undergraduate and postgraduate educational activities.

Eminent personalities from the world of science, literature and politics have studied at the Normale, among them Giosuè Carducci, Carlo Rubbia, Enrico Fermi, Aldo Capitini, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Giovanni Gronchi, Giovanni Gentile as well as Alessio Figalli, in more recent times.

==History==

The Scuola Normale Superiore was founded in 1810 by Napoleonic decree, as a twin institution of the École normale supérieure in Paris, itself dating back to the French Revolution jurisdiction.

The term &#x27; (&#x27;) was coined by Joseph Lakanal who, in submitting a report to the National Convention of 1794 on behalf of the Committee of Public Instruction, explained it as follows: &quot; &quot;, &quot;&quot; &quot;Normal : from the Latin &quot;norma &quot;, rule. These schools must indeed be the kind and rule of all others.&quot;

=== The Napoleonic period ===
The Napoleonic decree of 18 October 1810, concerning &quot;public education establishments&quot; in Tuscany – a province of the French empire since 1807 – established an &quot;Academic student residence&quot; in Pisa for university students. Twenty-five places were made available for students of the Faculties of Arts and Sciences, to create a branch of the Parisian École normale supérieure in countries where the use of the Italian language was authorized.

The Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa was thus established at the behest of Napoleon. The term &quot;Normale&quot; refers to its primary teaching mission, that is to train high school teachers to educate citizens according to coherent teaching and methodological &quot;norms&quot;.

On 22 February 1811, the first call was issued, but the Pisa-based Normale began its activity only in 1813, when the first students of Arts and Sciences attended the Scuola.
The first site of the Scuola was the convent of San Silvestro in Pisa: it was a student residence halfway between a military order and a convent, in which the life of the students was characterized by strict disciplinary regulations similar to those of the French &quot;Scuola&quot; of reference regarding admissions, occupations, punishments, rewards and even student clothing. Following the model of the École normale supérieure, the Scuola was entrusted to a &quot;Director&quot;, assisted by the &quot;Sub-director&quot; and by the &quot;&quot;Economo&quot;, in charge of administration, supervision of studies and the safeguarding of order.

The Normale was reserved at that time to the best high school students, aged between 17 and 24, who during their two years of studies also obtained degrees at the faculties of Arts and Sciences of the Imperial University. The students had particular commitments and were obliged to take additional courses: they were supervised by four &quot;ripetitori&quot;&quot;, chosen by the Director among the students of the Normale, who &quot;repeated&quot; the university lessons daily and coordinated the &quot;conferences&quot;, which were a sort of seminar. With this qualifying training, after graduation the students committed themselves to teaching in secondary schools for at least ten years.

The Napoleonic Scuola Normale had a short life: the only academic year was 1813/14, during which the physicist Ranieri Gerbi was Director. On 6 April 1814, Napoleon signed the act of abdication: the return of Grand Duke Ferdinand III to the throne of Tuscany coincided with the closure of the Scuola despite the various attempts to save it in the name of its function.

=== The grand-ducal period ===
The period of closure of the Scuola after the Napoleonic phase was actually quite short. The Grand Duke&#x27;s decree of 22 December 1817 re-established the ancient Ordine dei Cavalieri di Santo Stefano (the Order of the Knights of St. Stephen) in Pisa: in 1843 the Council of the Order proposed to establish a &quot;boarding school for young nobles&quot; in the Palazzo della Carovana together with a Scuola Normale. It has to be said that even in the previous period novice Knights were often students of the University of Pisa and therefore the &quot;Palazzo&quot; was already, in effect, a &quot;noble college&quot;.

To study the feasibility of the new project, Grand Duke Leopold II of Lorraine nominated a commission, which re-established the original function of the Scuola Normale Superiore, that of preparing secondary school teachers. On 28 November 1846, a grand-ducal &quot;Motuproprio&quot; established the Scuola Normale Toscana, also called &quot;Imperial Regia Scuola Normale&quot; (because it was connected to the Austrian system). On 15 November 1847, the new headquarters in Palazzo della Carovana were inaugurated.

The new Scuola was &quot;theoretical and practical&quot;, intended to &quot;train teachers of secondary schools&quot;; it was a boarding school that offered ten free places (with advantages reserved for the Knights of the Order), which could be accessed by call at the age of eighteen, as well as other paid places.

The boarding school was attended exclusively by students of Philosophy and Philology, while students of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at the University were aggregated to the Scuola: the latter, however, were required to attend the pedagogy course and to practice teaching by doing teacher training in schools, in keeping with a strong professional connotation which was later to be abandoned. The course of studies lasted three years.

In the grand-ducal period the Scuola was affected by the political climate: following the enthusiasm of the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;, the fear of subversive movements and tumults led to reactionary and confessional attitudes much lamented by the students themselves, including Giosuè Carducci, who was a student there between 1853 and 1856.

=== The post-unification period ===
With the new unified state, the legislative and administrative structure of the Savoy Kingdom was extended to the whole of Italy. The Italian school system was therefore regulated for over sixty years by the Casati law of 1859, originally issued for the Piedmontese and Lombard institutions: based on a centralized model, it gave private bodies the possibility to provide education, at the same time establishing the &quot;&quot;diritto dello Stato all’insegnamento universitario&quot;(the right of the State regarding university education) &quot; as well as the right to &#x27;supervise&#x27; all the levels of the school system.

In Tuscany the provisional government (1859–60) tried to protect the most illustrious local traditions, such as the Normale. After a long debate, in the Senate and in the press, on the opportuneness of maintaining this unique and anomalous institution, in 1862 it was officially named &quot;Scuola Normale del Regno d&#x27;Italia&quot;.

Various draft laws were submitted to the &quot;Camera&quot; to establish the Pisan model by extending it to other universities or to reorganize and expand the Scuola Normale of Pisa. But the new unified State, engaged in financial measures and public works deemed to be more urgent, approved, with the decree of 17 August 1862, only some modifications to the Scuola&#x27;s regulations, so that it could continue to function as a &quot;Scuola Normale italiana&quot;.

The &quot;new&quot; Normale was introduced into the national legal system by the Matteucci Regulations of 1862, which eliminated any religious and confessional aspects, in line with the secular orientation of Italian politics. The years of study became four by ministerial decree in 1863, and a new organizational structure was established.

At the educational level, the board of directors was divided into two &quot;sections&quot;, Letters and Philosophy and Physics-Mathematics, formed by the relative teaching staff; the latter sections were the forerunners of the current Faculties, under the control of the &quot;Director of Studies&quot;.

The publishing activity of the Scuola began with the foundation of the two journals (&quot;Annali della classe di scienze&quot; in 1871 and &quot;Annali della classe di lettere e filosofia&quot; in 1873). With the development of the postgraduate course, the Scuola was increasingly taking on the function, as well as of a university college, of a higher institute of scientific education and research. At the political level the role of the &quot;President&quot; of the board of directors was defined as the authority responsible for the moral, educational and economic governance of the Scuola. Finally, at an organizational level, there was the increasingly important role of the &quot;Provveditore-Economo&quot;, who managed the services as well as the human and financial resources, and had disciplinary jurisdiction over the students. The Matteucci regulations followed those issued by Education Minister Coppino in 1877, establishing the opening of the boarding school also to the section of Sciences and simplifying the complex structure of the previous &quot;Regulations of studies and examinations&quot;.

=== The Gentile Reform ===
In 1927, three years after the entry into force of the Gentile Reform, new regulations of the Scuola Normale were approved, which removed its qualification function while maintaining that of &quot;preparing for teaching in secondary schools and for the examinations which award qualifications for such teaching&quot; and of promoting postgraduate studies, accessible by all graduates at national level.

Nationalist propaganda also took hold within the Normale and the control of the Regime became increasingly more invasive, up until the first serious episode of repression, with the arrest in 1928 of three &quot;normalisti&quot; for anti-Fascist activity. To deal with the disturbances caused by the political events and the decline of the Scuola, which had increasingly fewer students, the philosopher Giovanni Gentile, a &quot;normalista,&quot; as well as a prominent figure of Italian Fascism, ideologue of the Regime and minister of education, was nominated as commissioner; he later became Director of the Normale, in 1928.

Gentile carried out a structural revision of the institution so that it would acquire national importance; to this end he oversaw the expansion of the headquarters and a considerable increase in the number of students and internal activities. His authority, together with the consensus of the Regime, allowed him to find means and collaboration for his project. Meanwhile, the relationship between the State and the Church inaugurated by the Lateran Treaty facilitated negotiations with the Archbishopric to obtain the availability of the Puteano College building which, together with that of the Timpano, would later be used to house the young &quot;normalisti&quot; while the expansion of the Palazzo della Carovana took place.

The &quot;Normale Gentiliana&quot;, recognized by the Royal Decree of 28 July 1932, was inaugurated on 10 December. Equipped with a new Statute, the Scuola became an independent higher education institution, albeit still connected to the University of Pisa, and acquired legal status and administrative, educational and disciplinary autonomy. The Normale, affirming its uniqueness in the Italian school system, was expanded above all to educate an increasingly more selected cultural élite.

In 1938 the Scuola Normale, like all the universities of the Italian Kingdom, endorsed the racial laws, which affected students and teaching staff. The Normale at that time still had many free-spirited souls in its midst: it was also the Scuola of Carlo Azeglio Ciampi – who, a few years from then, would join the Resistance – and formerly of Aldo Capitini, theorist of non-violence and firm opponent of the Fascist Regime.

=== The war and post-war period ===
The Scuola Normale continued its activity despite the Second World War, although with some regulatory limitations and many practical difficulties. In the meantime, also after the issuing of the racial laws, the dissent towards the Regime was becoming increasingly more evident among students and teaching staff.

With the deposition of Mussolini by the Grand Council on 25 July 1943, the Normale remained under German domination, since geographically it belonged to the territory of the Republic of Salò.

After the tragic air raid on Pisa on 31 August 1943, the new Director, Luigi Russo, threatened with arrest for political reasons, had to leave the city and was replaced by the mathematician Leonida Tonelli, who protected the library and the furnishings of the Palazzo della Carovana, transformed into German barracks, and transferred the most important collections to the nearby Certosa di Calci.

On 2 September 1944 the city was liberated, but Palazzo della Carovana was requisitioned by the Anglo-American army: students and teaching staff were relegated to the Puteano College. [Luigi Russo, reinstated as Director, continued the work of safeguarding the material of the Scuola and of its library, while the temporary site resumed its activities.

On 25 September 1945, the &quot;Palazzo&quot; was liberated and, in addition to the restoration of the building, it was decided to issue a call for seventy places for veteran or partisan students. Luigi Russo and Leonida Tonelli initiated a long awareness campaign that allowed them to find financial resources, including contributions not coming from the state, and to create a heritage through donations and purchases, in accordance with a policy that would continue in the following years.

The post-war Normale was also the era of women: seventy years from the admittance of the first woman to the Normale, in 1959 a &quot;Female Section&quot; was finally established, with headquarters in Palazzo del Timpano, to enable women to lead a collegial life within the Scuola.

=== From the post-war period to today ===
In the 1960s, the Scuola Normale faced the challenges of the &quot;university for the masses&quot;. Between 1964 and 1977, under the firm management of Gilberto Bernardini, it affirmed its original vocation for the pure disciplines, renouncing the management of the medical and juridical Colleges (to which the Collegio Pacinotti for applied sciences had been added) : the process that would lead to the establishment of the Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies began from the latter Colleges.

Between 1967 and 1968 students and teachers of the Normale took part in the protests that had started in Pisa and had spread throughout Italy; at the Normale not only was the entire university system challenged, but also the approach of the Scuola and its fundamental regulations. The difficult dialogue between the institution and its students gave rise to the 1969 Statute, from which the new educational framework of the Scuola and the profile of Institute of Scientific Higher Education emerged: in particular, a significant increase in the internal teaching staff, the foundation and the strengthening of research structures and a rise in the number of undergraduate and postgraduate students were achieved. Finally, the law of 18 June 1989 recognized the equivalence of the Scuola&#x27;s post-graduate diploma to that of PhDs issued by Italian universities.

In the academic year 2014/2015 the teaching curriculum for the postgraduate courses was expanded thanks to the merger with the Istituto di Scienze Umane di Firenze (SUM) (the Institute of Human Sciences of Florence, SUM), now named Department of Political and Social Sciences of the Normale. In 2018 the Normale was federated with the Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa and with the University Institute of Advanced Studies in Pavia, to offer new educational opportunities that could integrate the skills of the three institutions in certain areas such as economic-political disciplines and the study of the physical-chemical dynamics that influence climate change and the repercussions in the agri-food sector. Following the merger between the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa and the Istituto Italiano di Scienze Umane (the Italian Institute of Human Sciences), Palazzo Strozzi in Florence and the Residenza Aldo Capitini were added to the buildings dedicated to the activities of the Scuola; the latter building, following its renovation, was assigned to the students of the postgraduate courses of the Department.

The Palazzone di Cortona (in the province of Arezzo) must also be added to this real estate; it is a branch of the Scuola used for conferences and summer schools organized also in collaboration with other authorities and academic and research institutions.

== Academic structures ==

The Faculty of Humanities is divided into subject areas, within which the individual courses are organized. The subject areas refer to: Literature, philology and linguistics; Philosophy; History and paleography; History of Art and Archaeology; Ancient history and classical philology. The Faculty of Sciences is divided into subject areas, within which the individual courses are organized. The subject areas are:Chemistry and geology; Physics; Mathematics and computer science; Biological sciences. The Department of Political and Social Sciences covers the subject areas of political and social sciences.

== Teaching curriculum ==
The Scuola Normale Superiore offers both undergraduate education (which corresponds to the university curriculum of the bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree) and postgraduate (PhD) education.

=== Undergraduate courses ===
The undergraduate courses of the SNS (Bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees) cover the teaching curriculum of three macro-disciplinary areas: Letters and Philosophy, Sciences and Political-Social Sciences (the latter only for master&#x27;s degrees).The students selected through competition must follow both the courses taught at the Normale and the corresponding courses of study of the University, respecting rigorous study obligations. Studies are free of charge.

== Admission ==
Admission to the undergraduate courses and to the postgraduate courses (PhD) takes place by competition. You can access the Normale from the first year of university, or after obtaining a three-year degree. Finally, you can be admitted to the Scuola as a postgraduate student (PhD).

For admission to the undergraduate courses, a commission formed by the research staff of the Scuola Normale and of other universities assesses candidates, attempting to identify talent for study and research. The tests, which usually take place in August and September, are written and oral, and concern the disciplinary fields chosen by candidates for their academic career. The exam topics are studied in such a way that admission to the Scuola is guaranteed not for notional and mnemonic skills but rather for originality and intuition.

For access to the first year, A-level results and any other previous qualifications are not assessed during the exam. For access to the fourth year, results obtained for the bachelor&#x27;s degree and any other previous qualifications are not assessed during the exam. The selection is rigorous: only about 5% of those who take part in the competition are usually admitted. Students of the Scuola Normale Superiore do not pay any fees for their studies: university fees are reimbursed and accommodation and board are free.

For admission to the Postgraduate Course (PhD) the competition, open to graduates from all over the world, is based on qualifications and exams. Those selected receive a scholarship, as well as additional ad hoc grants for research activities in Italy and abroad.

== Campus ==
The Scuola Normale is located in its original historical building, called Palazzo della Carovana, in Piazza dei Cavalieri, in the medieval centre of Pisa.

=== Library ===
The Library was established at the same time as the Scuola and is an essential tool for teaching and research. It currently occupies three locations overlooking Piazza dei Cavalieri – the Palazzo dell&#x27;Orologio, the Palazzo della Canonica and a part of the Palazzo della Carovana – and, a short distance away, the location of Palazzo del Capitano. The book collection, for the most part with open shelves, has now exceeded one million volumes in total. It focuses on the disciplines under study at the Normale, and also houses texts on information science, bibliography and librarianship. In addition to the regular acquisitions, it has also been enriched by donations by various scholars connected to the Scuola; among these we can mention Eugenio Garin, Michele Barbi, Francesco Flamini, Cesare Luporini, Vittore Branca, Giorgio Pasquali, Arnaldo Momigliano, Paul Oskar Kristeller, Delio Cantimori, Sebastiano Timpanaro, Clifford Truesdell and Ettore Passerin d&#x27;Entrèves. A digital library is also being developed as part of the library service.
=== Archives ===
The Archival Centre of the Scuola Normale Superiore, established in October 2013, preserves, in addition to the rich documentary heritage of the Scuola, numerous archives of 19th and 20th century cultural figures acquired through testamentary legacies, gifts and deposits but also thanks to a targeted purchasing policy. Many collections come from former students and / or former lecturers of the Scuola Normale (collections from the directors Enrico Betti, Alessandro d&#x27;Ancona, Ulisse Dini, Luigi Bianchi and Gilberto Bernardini), but also from gifts or purchases: among these, mention must be made of the Salviati archive, which, among its important documents, also preserves an autograph manuscript by Machiavelli.

=== Research centres and laboratories ===
The research centres and the laboratories operating at the Normale are:

* Bio@SNS – Laboratorio di Biologia(Biology Laboratory)
* CRM – Centro di Ricerca Matematica Ennio De Giorgi (Ennio De Giorgi Mathematics Research Centre)
* DocStAr – Documentazione Storico Artistica (Artistic Historical Documentation)
* NEST – National Enterprise for nanoScience and nanoTechnology

=== Colleges and canteen ===
The students of the Scuola Normale, in Pisa, are currently housed in four colleges, located in the town:

* The Carducci College is located in via Turati, not far from Pisa central station; it has been owned by the Scuola since 1994. Partially restored in 2002, it is also being renovated at the moment. This building was dedicated to the illustrious poet and scholar, Giosuè Carducci, who was an undergraduate student of the faculty of humanities from 1853 to 1856 and a Nobel Prize winner for literature in 1906.
* The Fermi college, owned by the Scuola since 1993, is located a few steps away from the Palazzo della Carovana and has been used as accommodation for students since 1996. It is dedicated to the distinguished Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, a &quot;normalista&quot; as well as Nobel Prize winner for physics in 1938.
* The Faedo College, which opened in 2006, is the last residential college acquired by the Scuola Normale and is shared with the Scuola Superiore Sant&#x27;Anna. The building is located in Via del Giardino, near the Palazzo di Giustizia, and is dedicated to Alessandro Faedo, a &quot;normalista&quot; who subsequently became rector of the University of Pisa, president of the National Research Council and senator.
* The Timpano College was the first real estate donation to the Scuola, in 1932: located on the Lungarno Pacinotti, it was donated to the Scuola by a singular character, the Calabrian Domenico Timpano, who had made a fortune selling, in the United States at the time of Prohibition, alcohol-based restorative products from his pharmaceutical industry. The building, damaged during the Second World War by the explosion of the nearby Ponte Solferino, was rebuilt in the 1950s, and was initially the female housing section for students of the Scuola Normale Superiore. Currently it is assigned to students and scholarship holders and is divided into three colleges: Timpano, Timpanino and Acconci (the latter acquired in 1967).

Students of the postgraduate course do not usually stay in the colleges, but receive a monthly grant for accommodation; in Florence, however, the Residenza Capitini – a building owned by the City of Florence, recently renovated with funds made available by the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research – can accommodate students of the postgraduate courses of the Department of Political and Social Sciences .

Those who have right of access to the canteen of the Scuola Normale, located on the lower floors of Palazzo D&#x27;Ancona (in the immediate vicinity of the Palazzo della Carovana, in Via Consoli del Mare 5) are: undergraduate students, Italian and international PhD students, research grant holders, scholarship holders, teaching and administrative staff, and guests of the Scuola.

== The &quot;Associazione Normalisti&quot; and the &quot;Normale&quot; bulletin ==
Various associations of alumni and professors have been operative at the Scuola at various stages of its history. After the first initiative by the philosopher Giovanni Gentile in 1933, later revitalized in the 1950s, in 1997, at the proposal of Alessandro Faedo, the current Association was founded, simply called &quot;Associazione Normalisti&quot;.

The current president is Roberto Cerreto; previous presidents were Luigi Arialdo Radicati di Brozolo, Claudio Cesa, Franco Montanari and Umberto Sampieri. Carlo Azeglio Ciampi was an honorary president.

The Association publishes the Normale bulletin every six months or every year; the bulletin is the official organ of the association, registered at the Tribunal of Pisa; its current graphic design is the work of Paolo Peluffo, former &quot;Consigliere per la Stampa e l&#x27;Informazione del Presidente della Repubblica&quot; (Press and Information Councillor of the President of the Republic) and &quot;sottosegretario di Stato alla Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri&quot; (Undersecretary of State at the President&#x27;s Office of the Cabinet) of the Monti Government. The director is Andrea Bianchi.

== Cinema and literature ==
Some narrative works of the 21st century are set at the Scuola Normale Superiore, such as &quot;L&#x27;etica dell&#x27;Aquario&quot; by Ilaria Gaspari and some pages by Walter Siti of &quot;Scuola di nudo&quot;. The Scuola Normale also features in Elena Ferrante&#x27;s &quot;The Story of a New Name&quot; (2013), second installment of the four-volume work known as the &quot;Neapolitan Novels&quot;: the protagonist of the novel, Elena Greco, is admitted to the Normale and describes her years in Pisa. The Scuola Normale Superiore has also appeared in the following films: &quot;Now or Never (Ora o mai più)&quot; and &quot;Il Giocatore invisibile.&quot;

<doc id="1217461" wikidata="Q701647" url="?curid=1217461" title="Orchid Island">
<text>Orchid Island, also known by other names, is a volcanic island off the southeastern coast of Taiwan, which Orchid Island is part of. It is separated from the Batanes of the Philippines by the Bashi Channel of the Luzon Strait. The island and the nearby are governed as in Taitung County, which is one of the county&#x27;s two insular townships (the other being Lyudao Township).

It is considered a potential World Heritage Site.

==Names==
Orchid Island is known by the Tao people indigenous to the island as Pongso no Tao (&quot;island of human beings&quot;). It was also known by the Tao as Ma&#x27;ataw (&quot;floating in the sea&quot;) or Irala (&quot;facing the mountain&quot;); the latter being contrasted with the Tao name for the Taiwanese mainland – &quot;Ilaod&quot; (&quot;toward the sea&quot;). 

In the 17th century, it appeared on Japanese maps as &quot;Tabako&quot;, a name borrowed into French and English as &quot;Tabaco&quot;. It is still known by Filipinos as , a name also formerly used in English. Lesser Orchid Island was similarly known as &quot;Little Botel-Tobago&quot;.

&quot;Orchid Island&quot; is a calque of the Chinese name, written in traditional characters, although strictly the second character means an islet rather than an island. The name honors the local &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; orchids and was established by the Republic of China government in 1947. It is also sometimes known as Lanyu or , derived from Pinyin romanization of the name&#x27;s Mandarin reading (Mandarin ). It is also known in Taiwanese Hokkien .

The island had previously been known to the Chinese as &quot;Redhead Island&quot; (Mandarin ; Taiwanese Hokkien ), referring to the island&#x27;s northwestern mountain peaks, which resemble red human heads when illuminated by the setting sun. These characters were borrowed into Japanese as Kōtōsho during their rule of Taiwan.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Based on genetic studies, Orchid Island was settled by the ancestors of the Tao people during the Austronesian Expansion (approximately 4000 BP) from the mainland of Taiwan. They maintained close contact through trade and intermarriage with the Ivatan people of the neighboring Batanes Islands of the Philippines until the beginning of the Colonial Era.

===Great Qing===
The island first appears on surviving charts in the 17th century, when it was noted by Japanese sailors.

The island was visited by a surveying party from in 1867. In the early 1870s, William Campbell saw the island from aboard the &quot;Daphne&quot;, and wrote:

===Imperial Japan===
During Japan&#x27;s rule of Taiwan, its government declared Kōtō Island an ethnological research area off-limits to the general public.

===Republic of China===
After the Republic of China took over Taiwan, the island was administered as the Hong-tou-yu &quot;township&quot; of Taitung County after 19 January 1946 but the Japanese restrictions on visitors remained in effect. Because of these policies, the Tao continue to have the best-preserved traditions among the Taiwanese aborigines despite the end of the ban on settlement and tourism in 1967.

Since 1967, schools have been built on the island and education in Mandarin is compulsory.

Lesser Orchid Island has been used for target practice drills by the Republic of China Air Force.

A nuclear-waste storage facility was built in 1982 without prior consultation with the island&#x27;s inhabitants. Tao Aborigines have protested, and since the early 1990s demonstrated, their desire to rid their island of the &quot;evil spirits&quot; of nuclear waste. The plant receives nuclear waste from Taiwan&#x27;s three nuclear power plants, all operated by the state utility Taipower. About 100,000 barrels of nuclear waste have been stored at the Lanyu complex. In 2002 and 2012, there were major protests from local residents, calling on Taipower to remove the waste from the island.

== Geography ==

There are eight mountains over high. The tallest mountain is or Hongtoushan at . The rock on the island is volcanic tholeiite andesite and explosive fragments. The volcano last erupted in the Miocene period. It is part of the Luzon Volcanic Arc. Magma was formed from underthrusting oceanic crust under compression about deep. The andesite rock contains some visible crystals of pyroxene or amphibole. The geochemistry of the rock shows that it is enriched in sodium, magnesium, and nickel but depleted in iron, aluminum, potassium, titanium, and strontium.

As the island is within the tropics, the island experiences a warm and rainy tropical climate throughout the year with humidity often reaching more than 90%. Rainfall, abundant throughout the year, cools the temperature significantly. The climate is classified as a monsoon-influenced Köppen&#x27;s tropical rainforest climate (Af) with frequent cyclones therefore not equatorial, with annual temperatures averaging around on the mountains and on the coasts, one of the highest in Taiwan.

Lesser Orchid Island is an uninhabited volcanic islet nearby. It is the southernmost point of Taitung County. It is home to a critically endangered endemic orchid, &quot;Phalaenopsis equestris f. aurea&quot;.

Forest Belle Rock is located south of Lesser Orchid Island.



==Administrative divisions==

There are seven neighborhoods (社) in Lanyu Township, four of which are also administrative villages (村):

== Flora and fauna ==
Orchid Island hosts many tropical plant species, sharing many species with tropical Asia but also many endemics: there are 35 plant species found nowhere else. For example, &quot;Pinanga tashiroi&quot; is a species of palm tree found nowhere else than Orchid Island.

Green sea turtles make nests on the island, which is surrounded by coral reefs. Four species of sea snake inhabit the waters around the island. Humpback whales were historically common in the area, and there were continuous sightings of them in the 2000s, which marked the first return of the species into Taiwanese waters since the cessation of whaling. Sightings are reported almost every year, although the whales do not stay for long, as they once did. They appear instead to be migratory visitors.

== Demographics ==
Out of a total current population of 5036, approximately 4200 belong to the indigenous Tao people and the remaining 800 are mainly Han Chinese.

== Economy ==

The islanders are mostly farmers and fishermen relying on a large annual catch of flying fish and on wet taro, yams, and millet.

On 19 September 2014, the first 7-Eleven store in the island was opened. During the opening ceremony, the township chief said that the store could provide conveniences to the local residents such as fee and tax collection.

== Energy ==
=== Nuclear waste ===

The Lanyu nuclear waste storage facility was built at the southern tip of Orchid Island in 1982. The plant receives nuclear waste from Taiwan&#x27;s three nuclear power plants operated by state utility Taiwan Power Company (Taipower). Islanders did not have a say in the decision to locate the facility on the island.

In 2002, almost 2000 protesters, including many residents and elementary and high school students from the island, staged a sit-in in front of the storage plant, calling on Taipower to remove nuclear waste from the island. The government had pledged and then failed to withdraw the 100,000 barrels of waste from their island by the end of 2002. Aboriginal politicians successfully obstructed legislative proceedings that year to show support for the protests. In a bid to allay safety concerns, Taipower has pledged to repackage the waste since many of the iron barrels used for storage have become rusty from the island&#x27;s salty and humid air. Taipower has for years been exploring ways to ship the nuclear waste overseas for final storage, but plans to store the waste in an abandoned North Korean coal mine have met with strong protests from neighboring South Korea and Japan due to safety and environmental concerns, while storage in Russia or China is complicated by political factors. Taipower is &quot;trying to convince the islanders to extend the storage arrangement for another nine years in exchange for payment of NT$200 million (about $5.7 million)&quot;.

Following years of protests by residents, more concerns arose about the facility after Japan&#x27;s Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. A report released in November 2011 said a radioactive leak had been detected outside the facility and this has added to residents&#x27; concerns. In February 2012, hundreds of Tao living on Orchid Island held a protest outside the nuclear waste storage facility. Chang Hai-yu, a preacher at a local church, said &quot;it was a tragedy that Tao children are being born into a radiation-filled environment&quot;. Lanyu mayor Chiang To-li &quot;urged Taipower to remove nuclear waste from the island as soon as possible&quot;.

In March 2012, about 2,000 people staged an anti-nuclear protest in Taiwan&#x27;s capital Taipei. Scores of aboriginal protesters &quot;demanded the removal of 100,000 barrels of nuclear waste stored on Orchid Island, off south-eastern Taiwan. Authorities have failed to find a substitute storage site amid increased awareness of nuclear danger over the past decade&quot;.

=== Power generation ===

The island houses its only power generation facility, the fuel-fired Lanyu Power Plant. Commissioned in 1982, the plant has a total installed capacity of 6.5 MW and is owned and operated by Taipower. Stipulated under Article 14 of the Offshore Islands Development Act, households on the island enjoy free electricity. The situation on the island resulted from the preferential policy given to the island residents due to the construction of the Lanyu Storage Site on the island in 1982.

Due to the free electricity, electricity consumption on the island is generally much higher than in other parts of Taiwan. In 2011, the average annual electricity consumption per household in Lanyu was 6,522 kWh, almost twice the 3,654 kWh Taiwan average. In 2002, Taipower provided an equivalent of NT$6.35 million worth of electricity to the island, and in 2011 the amount rose to NT$24.39 million. Due to this suspected abuse, members of Control Yuan called for an investigation into the electricity subsidy to Lanyu Island in 2012.

== Tourist attractions ==

* Lanyu Flying Fish Cultural Museum
* Lanyu Lighthouse
* Lanyu Weather Station

== Transport ==

The island is accessible by sea or air. Daily Air offers flights from Taitung Airport in Taitung City to Lanyu Airport on Orchid Island. The flight duration is half an hour and the daily frequency is dependent on weather conditions. Ferry trips to the island are available from Taitung City&#x27;s Fugang Fishery Harbor year round. In the summer, there is a ferry from Houbihu port in Kenting.

* Badaiwan de Shenhua 《八代灣的神話》 (Myths from Ba-dai Bay). Taipei: Morning Star Publishing Co., 1992.—Syaman Rapongan&#x27;s first book; a collection of myths and his personal reflections on contemporary Tao; divided into two parts, with the first on myths, and the second on personal reflections.
* Lenghai Qing Shenhaiyang Chaosheng Zhe 《冷海情深—海洋朝聖者》(Deep Love for Cold Sea: The Oceanic Pilgrim). Taipei: Unitas Publishing Co., Ltd., 1997.—A collection of short stories about Syaman Rapongan&#x27;s life on Lanyu; the book marks the writer&#x27;s constant struggles with himself and his family because he voluntarily went unemployed and devoted himself solely to the ocean as a bare-hand diver in order to explore Tao civilization and find the meaning of life. The book also marks the writer&#x27;s initial identity transition from a Sinicized man to a real Tao who embraces the value of physical labor and learns to cultivate the art of story-telling. The book was the Annual Reading for 1997 by United Daily News.
* Heise de Chibang 《黑色的翅膀》 (Black Wings). Taipei: Morning Star Publishing Co., 1999.—Syaman Rapongan&#x27;s first novel; it questions the future of Tao people through the characterization of four young men (Kaswal, Gigimit, Jyavehai and Ngalolog) Should they run rigorously after the tempting ‘white body’ on the land or wait patiently for the arrival of ‘black wings’ on the sea? Although this appears a rhetorical question, Syaman Rapongan reveals that the conflicts are severe and their impact profound. This novel won Wu Zhuo-liou Literary Award in 1999.
* Hailang de Jiyi 《海浪的記憶》 (Memory of the Ocean Waves). Taipei: Unitas Publishing Co., Ltd., 2002.—Another collection of short stories; divided into two parts, with the first on the countless ties between Tao and the sea (six stories), and the second on Tao&#x27;s staunch fights against foreign influences. Experimenting boldly with different genre and languages, the writer combines verses with prose and juxtaposes Tao and Chinese languages. As another Taiwanese writer and critic, Song Ze-lai, points out, Syaman Rapongan deliberately defamiliarizes his language and syntax in order to praise traditional Tao values and to guide his readers, especially Tao, back to the original way of living, far from influences of Chinese culture and modern civilization.
* Hanghaijia de Lian 《航海家的臉》 (The Face of a Navigator). Taipei: INK Literary Publishing Co., 2007.—Also a collection of articles; it continues the oceanic theme but exposes more of Syaman Rapongan&#x27;s personal battles with modernity or traditionality and his pursuit of prosperity or return to innocence. Calling him-self a nomadic soul, Syaman Rapongan knows there may be no end to his battle. His course is a romantic one, without any definite plan. Nor will his beloved sea offer any answer or guidance. Nevertheless, consolation can be found in sweet solitude and family understanding. Syaman Rapongan&#x27;s first attempt at trans-Pacific navigation with a Japanese captain and five Indonesian crew members is also included here.
* Lao Hairen 《老海人》 (Old Ama Divers). Taipei: INK Literary Publishing Co., Ltd., 2009.—Syaman Rapongan&#x27;s second novel; highly praised and awarded (The Wu Lu-chin Prize for Essays, Chiu Ko Publishing Co. Annual Selection in 2006). Instead of following the previous semi-biographical direction, Syaman Rapongan focuses on three outcasts on his island, Ngalomirem, Tagangan and Zomagpit, whose pretty names fail to bring them pretty lives. Ngalomiren is regarded as a psychopath, Tagangan a miserable student though a brilliant octopus-catcher, and Zomagpit a hopeless drunkard. Through these figures, Syaman Rapongan portrays how Tao society stumbles between traditionality and modernity, and how broken the society has become in both material and mental terms as its humble and simple way becomes recognized again. In spite of a slight hope for reconciliation, this way back to the humble and simple Tao world is arduous, sometimes painful, and fully filled with regrets.

<text>Julie Louise Gerberding (born August 22, 1955) is an American infectious disease expert who was the first woman to serve as the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As of May 2022, she is the CEO of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH). Gerberding grew up in Estelline, South Dakota, attended Brookings High School, and earned undergraduate and graduate degrees from Case Western Reserve University. She was the chief medical resident at the University of California, San Francisco where she treated hospitalized AIDS patients in the first years of the epidemic. Gerberding became a nationally-recognized figure during the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States during her tenure as the acting deputy director of the National Center for Infectious Diseases, where she was a prominent spokeswoman for the CDC during daily briefings regarding the attacks and aftermath. Gerberding then served as CDC director from 2002 to 2009, and was then hired as an administrator at Merck.

==Education and early career==
Gerberding grew up in Estelline, South Dakota and attended Brookings High School and Case Western Reserve University, where she earned an undergraduate degree in biology in 1977 and an M.D. in 1981. She completed her internship and was the chief medical resident at the University of California San Francisco, where she also completed a fellowship in clinical pharmacology and infectious diseases. Gerberding was an assistant professor at UCSF from 1988 to 1995 and the director of the Epidemiology and Prevention Interventions Center at San Francisco General Hospital from 1990 to 1998. She also earned an M.P.H. degree from the University of California Berkeley in 1990 and was an associate clinical professor of medicine (infectious diseases) at Emory University.

==AIDS research==
During her medical residency at San Francisco General Hospital, Gerberding treated some of the first hospitalized AIDS patients. She completed several studies on the risks of HIV to healthcare workers, created guidelines to prevent their infections, and established a treatment and research unit focused on HIV/AIDS cases among the urban poor.

==US CDC==
In 1998, Gerberding was hired by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as the Director of the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion. There, she &quot;developed CDC&#x27;s patient safety initiatives and other programs to prevent infections, antimicrobial resistance and medical errors in healthcare settings.&quot; 

In September 2001, she became the acting deputy director of the National Center for Infectious Diseases (NCID). During the 2001 anthrax attacks, Gerberding was part of a CDC team who regularly communicated with Congress, briefed the United States Health and Human Services senior staff, and communicated with the public about the crisis via daily press conferences.

In April 2002, after the resignation of CDC Director Jeffrey Koplan, Gerberding became the acting principal deputy director of the CDC and deputy director of the NCID.

== CDC director ==
In July 2002, Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson named Gerberding as the director of the CDC and administrator for the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR).

In May 2004, the CDC announced a significant restructuring to improve its preparedness for several types of threats, to promote health, and to better prevent disease, injury and disability. The reorganization was controversial, and Gerberding received bipartisan criticism from individuals and occupational health &amp; safety groups, mainly centered around the implications of the restructuring for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

Other challenges of Gerberding&#x27;s tenure as CDC Director included the American response to the global outbreak of Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and to several natural disasters, including Hurricane Katrina.

Gerberding resigned as CDC director effective on January 20, 2009, Barack Obama&#x27;s inauguration day, to enable Obama&#x27;s appointment for CDC director, Tom Frieden, to assume his position.

==Private sector==
In December 2009, Gerberding became president of Merck&#x27;s vaccine division. In December 2014, the company announced her appointment as executive vice president for strategic communications, global public policy and population health. In March 2022 it was announced that she would be retiring from Merck in May in order to assume the role as CEO of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH).

In April 2021, Gerberding told a Michigan news outlet that the United States&#x27; response to the COVID-19 pandemic was inadequate and that herd immunity to the virus would be challenging to achieve due to widespread vaccine hesitancy.

On May 30, 2021, Gerberding delivered the commencement address to the Washington University in St. Louis Class of 2020, whose commencement ceremonies were postponed until May 2021 due to the pandemic.

<doc id="1217477" wikidata="Q6879217" url="?curid=1217477" title="Mississippi Legislature">
<text>The Mississippi Legislature is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Mississippi. The bicameral Legislature is composed of the lower Mississippi House of Representatives, with 122 members, and the upper Mississippi State Senate, with 52 members. Both representatives and senators serve four-year terms without term limits. The Legislature convenes at the Mississippi State Capitol in Jackson.

== History ==
From 1800 until 1833, the legislative body of the Mississippi Territory and the state of Mississippi was known as the &quot;General Assembly&quot;. Thereafter, it was known as &quot;the Legislature of the State of Mississippi&quot;. During the Reconstruction era, the legislature met for biennial sessions. In 1890, constitutional revisions allowed the body to regularly convene only once every four years. In 1910, the legislature reverted to biennial meetings, and in 1968 it began meeting annually. In 1977, the state constitution was amended to require that legislative districts be apportioned equally in terms of population.

===List of past sessions===
== Membership ==
The Mississippi Legislature has 174 elected members, with 122 members of the Mississippi House of Representatives and 52 members of the Mississippi Senate. Members are elected to four-year terms to represent districts. Among the states, Mississippi has the 14th largest lower house and fifth largest upper house. House districts are drawn such that each encompasses about 24,000 people, while Senate districts are drawn such that each encompasses about 55,000 people. Candidates for the House must be at least 21 years old, while candidates for the Senate must be at least 25 years old. Each house has the authority to judge the qualifications of its own members. The Mississippi Legislature is a citizen legislature; most legislators have full-time occupations unrelated to their official roles. Members receive a base salary of $23,000 per year. As of April 2022, most legislators garnered a total compensation of $40,000 to $50,000 per year from salary, per diem payments, and other reimbursements and payments, with several collecting around $70,000 per year.

All legislators swear a state constitutionally-prescribed oath of office, which requires them to declare allegiance to the state and federal constitutions, pledge to be responsible in the exercise of their duties, and promise not to engage in vote trading. The constitution provides legislators with a limited immunity from arrest during a legislative session and 15 days before or after a session except in cases of &quot;treason, felony, theft, or breach of the peace&quot;. In the event of a vacancy in a legislative seat in between regular elections, the governor issues a writ of election to enable a contest to be held to fill the seat for the remainder of its term.

==Structure and process==
The Constitution of Mississippi provides for a bicameral legislature of the state, composed of a Senate and a House of Representatives, in which all lawmaking authority is vested. The constitution requires the legislature to convene in regular annual sessions, with most lasting for 90 days and sessions on every fourth year lasting for 125 days, though the legislature can extend their sessions with the approval of two-thirds of its members. The governor may also at their discretion call the legislature into a special session to a consider a specific issue of the governor&#x27;s choosing. Since 1903, the legislature has met in the Mississippi State Capitol in Jackson. One house cannot adjourn its proceedings for over three days without the agreement of the other. A basic majority of one house&#x27;s members constitutes a quorum to do business, though a smaller group can convene and vote to compel the attendance of absent members.

Each house elects their own officers. The House of Representatives is led by a speaker, who is elected among the preexisting membership in the House. The Senate is led by the lieutenant governor, who is popularly elected by voters in statewide elections and is &quot;ex officio&quot; president of the Senate. Second to these officers in their respective houses are the speaker &quot;pro tempore&quot; and president of the Senate &quot;pro tempore&quot;. The presiding officers determine the leadership of legislative committees in their own houses. In the event of a tied vote in a joint session, the lieutenant governor is empowered to cast a tie-breaking vote. The constitution gives the state legislature the authority to determine rules of its own proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and expel a member with a two-thirds vote of the membership of his or her chamber. Legislative proceedings are open to the public unless a closed session for secrecy is deemed necessary, and each house has the power to punish public observers for disorderly and disruptive behavior. Each house keeps an official journal to record its proceedings, including votes on bills.

A bill may originate in either house, and be amended or rejected in the other, and must be read by its title on three different days in each house, unless two-thirds of the house vote to suspend the rules. The Mississippi Constitution prohibits amending a bill to change its original purpose. Bills amended in the second house, must return it to the first for a vote to accept amendments. All bills must be considered by a committee in each house. No bills can be introduced in the last three days of a session. Most bills are passed by a simple majority vote of each chamber. Any revenue bill or measure that alters the assessment of taxable property requires the approval of three-fifths of legislators present and voting. Every bill passed by both houses is signed by the presiding officers of each house.

== Powers ==
The Mississippi Legislature has the power to write state laws and craft appropriations to fund state government. All bills passed by the legislature become law unless vetoed by the governor, though the body may override the veto with the approval two-thirds of the members of each House. The legislature has the power to convene hearings to investigate any matter it desires. Unable to compel testimony from any individual in such instances, or prosecute crimes, or enforce any other desired outcome, such hearings are usually held only to gather information to aid in policy-making and budgeting decisions. 

The legislature is responsible for election of the state librarian. During instances of rebellion or foreign invasion, the legislature may suspend the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. The House of Representatives is empowered to impeach any state official with the agreement of two-thirds of its members and subject them to a trial in the Senate, which can remove an official from office with the agreement of two-thirds of its members. The legislature can pass amendments to the state constitution with the approval of two-thirds of the members of each house, subject to ratification in a popular referendum.

== Political dynamics ==
Bills typically have to be passed out of committee before being passed by the legislature. A chair of a committee can choose not to bring up the bill for a vote before the committee or a full house and thus let it expire. The chairs of the Finance Committee in the Senate and the Ways and Means Committee and Appropriations Committee in the House often exercise significant influence over legislation. Mississippi judges have usually deferred to the legislature on legal questions involving its internal decisions and operations; such things are not subject to regular judicial review.

In 2011, 63% of the seats in the legislature had candidates with no significant opposition in upcoming elections. In 2023, that figure was 85%. That year the Associated Press stated that this &quot;raises questions about the ability of American voters to hold their elected representatives accountable.&quot;

<text>Beverly John &quot;Bev&quot; Harrison (born May 10, 1942) is a former teacher and New Brunswick politician.

==Early life==
The son of William and Jean Harrison, Harrison received bachelor degrees in Arts and Education from the University of New Brunswick.

==Political career==
Harrison was first elected to the legislature in 1978 to represent Saint John-Fundy and was re-elected in 1982. In 1985, he, and two other Saint John-area MLAs, undertook a caucus revolt calling for the resignation of Premier Richard Hatfield. Hatfield made some concessions to them and they were re-integrated to caucus.

Harrison was defeated in the 1987 election which saw the Opposition Liberals sweep every seat in the province. Harrison was again defeated in Saint John-Fundy in the 1991 election. He did not contest the 1995 election.

==Return to teaching==
From 1987 to 1997, in private life, Harrison returned to teaching, becoming principal of Saint John High School (1992). He retired from teaching in 1997.

==Re-election==
In the 1999 election, he was re-elected to the legislature for the riding of Hampton-Kings. He was acclaimed as Speaker on July 6, 1999. Re-elected to the legislature in the 2003 election, he was also re-elected, again by acclamation, as Speaker on July 29, 2003. He resigned from his post as speaker on February 14, 2006 when he was named to the cabinet as Government House Leader in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick and Minister of Supply and Services.

He was re-elected in the 2006 general election, however his party lost and as a result Harrison sat on the opposition benches for the first time in his 15 years in the legislature.

In 2010, Harrison was re-elected with 57% of the vote with his nearest opponent garnering 22%. Harrison announced that he would be seeking the New Democratic Party nomination in the district of Hampton for the 2014 election. Harrison lost the election to Progressive Conservative candidate [Gary Crossman].

<doc id="1217488" wikidata="Q4726095" url="?curid=1217488" title="Alice Springs Youth Detention Centre">
<text>The Alice Springs Youth Detention Centre formerly known as Alice Springs Juvenile Holding Centre is an Australian medium to maximum security prison for juvenile males and females located in Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia.

== Facilities ==
The centre was designed for use as a short-term holding and remand centre for up to four days, and could originally hold up to ten juveniles of either sex; longer remand periods or sentences were moved to Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre in Darwin.

Expansion and re-configuration of the facility allowed for longer-term detention of up to 18 detainees: a maximum of 15 males in eight rooms, and up to three females in three rooms in a separate wing. However by 2018 there was overcrowding at the facility, with 24 youths held there. Improvements made after the Royal Commission into Juvenile Detention had been made, including provision for school lessons; however in June 2019 it was found that the Centre was failing to provide nearly half of the classes.

==&quot;Four Corners&quot; program==

Graphic footage of repeated abuse of children at Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre and in Alice Springs was featured in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Four Corners&quot; episode &quot;Australia&#x27;s Shame&quot;, which aired on 25 July 2016. The program also showed a 17-year-old boy shackled and hooded in a chair in Alice Springs (adult) correctional centre. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said it was &quot;shocked&quot; at the &quot;appalling treatment&quot; of the detainees, which violates the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment, to which Australia is party.

Following national outrage, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced a Royal Commission into Juvenile Detention in the Northern Territory. John Elferink was sacked as Corrections Minister the morning after the program aired. The corrections and justice portfolios were taken on by Northern Territory Chief Minister Adam Giles. Use of restraint chairs and spithoods were then suspended.

<doc id="1217500" wikidata="Q582280" url="?curid=1217500" title="Rose Bowl (stadium)">
<text>The Rose Bowl is an outdoor athletic stadium located in Pasadena, California. Opened in October 1922, the stadium is recognized as a National Historic Landmark and a California Historic Civil Engineering landmark. With a modern all-seated capacity of 89,702, the Rose Bowl is the 16th-largest stadium in the world, the 11th-largest stadium in the United States, and the 10th-largest NCAA stadium. The stadium is 10 miles (16 km) north-northeast of downtown Los Angeles.

The Rose Bowl is best known as a college football venue, specifically as the host of the annual Rose Bowl Game for which it is named. Since 1982, it has served as the home stadium of the UCLA Bruins football team of the Big Ten Conference. Five Super Bowl games, third most of any venue, have been played in the stadium. The Rose Bowl is a noted soccer venue, having hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup Final, 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup Final, and the 1984 Olympic Soccer Gold Medal Match, as well as numerous CONCACAF and United States Soccer Federation matches.

The stadium and adjacent Brookside Golf and Country Club are owned by the city of Pasadena and managed by the Rose Bowl Operating Company, a non-profit organization whose board is selected by council members of the city of Pasadena. UCLA and the Pasadena Tournament of Roses also have one member on the company board. The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager was Darryl Dunn from 1999 until he retired in June 2022.

==History==
===Design and construction===

Through January 1922, the bowl now known as the Rose Bowl Game was played at Tournament Park, about southeast, adjacent to the campus of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). The Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association, the game&#x27;s organizer, realized the temporary stands were inadequate for a crowd of more than 40,000, and sought to build a better, permanent stadium.

The stadium was designed by architect Myron Hunt in 1921. His design was influenced by the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut, which opened in 1914. The Arroyo Seco was selected as the location for the stadium. The Rose Bowl was under construction from February 27, 1922, to October 1922. The nearby Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum also was under construction during this time and would be completed in May 1923, shortly after the Rose Bowl was completed. Originally built as a horseshoe, the stadium was expanded several times. The southern stands were completed in 1928, enclosing the stadium into a complete bowl.

The field&#x27;s alignment is nearly north–south, offset slightly northwest, and the elevation at street level is approximately above sea level.

The stadium&#x27;s name was alternatively &quot;Tournament of Roses Stadium&quot; or &quot;Tournament of Roses Bowl&quot;, until being settled as &quot;Rose Bowl&quot; before the 1923 Rose Bowl game, in reference to the unusually named (at the time) Yale Bowl.

The stadium can be very difficult to access due to the traffic caused by single-lane residential street access. It has little dedicated parking for visitors and parking issues have routinely caused visitors to spend two to three hours completing the last mile to the stadium on game days. When constructed, the majority of visitors arrived to the bowl via the Pacific Electric interurban streetcar system; however, this service ended in 1958. Weather permitting, the 36 holes of Brookside Golf Course are used for parking. In 2016, Rose Bowl contracted ParkJockey to streamline parking in and around the stadium. There is improved signage, a shuttle service to help visitors get to the stadium and mobile generator-powered lighting for visitors walking on the golf course at night.

===Dedication===
The first game was a regular season contest in 1922, when California defeated USC 12–0 on October 28. This was the only loss for USC and Cal finished the season undefeated. California declined the invitation to the 1923 Rose Bowl game and USC went instead. The stadium was dedicated officially on January 1, 1923, when USC defeated Penn State 14–3.

===Seating===
The stadium seating has been reconfigured several times since its construction in 1922. The South end was filled in to complete the bowl and more seats have been added. The original wooden benches were replaced by aluminum benches in 1969. New grandstand and loge seats were installed in 1971. New red seat backs were added to 22,000 seats prior to the 1980 Rose Bowl. A Rose Bowl improvement was conducted because of UCLA&#x27;s 1982 move and the 1984 Summer Olympics. This resulted in new seat backs for 50,000 seats.

For many years, the Rose Bowl had the largest football stadium capacity in the United States, eventually being surpassed by Michigan Stadium (107,601). The Rose Bowl&#x27;s maximum stated seating capacity was 104,091 from 1972 to 1997. Some of the seats closest to the field were never used during this time for UCLA regular season games, and were covered by tarps. Official capacity was lowered following the 1998 Rose Bowl. Slightly different figures are given for the current capacity because the lower-level seats behind the team benches are not used for some events since the spectators can not see through the standing players or others on the field. UCLA reports the capacity at 91,136. The Tournament of Roses reports the capacity at 92,542. The 2006 Rose Bowl game, which was also the BCS championship game, had a crowd of 93,986. In the 2011 contest between TCU and Wisconsin, the listed attendance was 94,118. As of 2008, the Rose Bowl is the 11th largest football stadium, and is still the largest stadium that hosts post-season bowl games. For concerts held there, the Rose Bowl holds almost 60,000 people. The stadium&#x27;s 2014 remodeling removed the lower &quot;lettered row&quot; seats on each side behind the players&#x27; benches and provided access in and out of the stadium for the lower sections of the Rose Bowl, restoring its original design.

For the 2021 season, UCLA began using a tarp to decrease capacity and cover the north upper end zone, the tarp spells out U-C-L-A with advertisements on the side. This brought official capacity down to 69,747 seats.

===Renovations===

The press box was updated before the 1962 Rose Bowl with an elevator and two rows. The cost was $356,000. The Press Box was refurbished for UCLA&#x27;s move in 1982 and the 1984 Summer Olympics. In 2011 and 2012, the press box was undergoing renovation as part of the larger renovation originally budgeted at $152 million in 2010. Costs had increased to $170 million during construction. Work proceeded during the 2011 football season, and was expected to be completed before the UCLA Bruins&#x27; first home game in 2012. Some unforeseen problems had been encountered due to the stadium&#x27;s age and some renovations done in the early 1990s. Most of the planned renovations were completed in 2013. Because of the increased construction cost, items deferred for the future are additional new restrooms, the historic field hedge, new entry-gate structures, ribbon boards and additional new concession stands. The stadium started &quot;The Brick Campaign&quot; to help pay for some of the cost of the renovations. The Brick Campaign, completed in 2014, features a large logo of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses and the donor bricks arranged by universities in front of the south main entrance to the stadium. A large tall by wide LED video display board was added to the north end of the stadium as a part of the renovation.

===Court of Champions and Rose Plaza===
The Court of Champions is at the stadium&#x27;s south end. Rose Bowl game records along with the names of the coaches and the MVP players, are shown on the plaques attached to the exterior wall. The Hall of Fame statue is also at the Court of Champions. The 2014 renovation allows more plaques to be placed on the wall and floor for future games. The statue of Jackie Robinson, who played football with Pasadena City College, was dedicated in 2017. In 2019, Brandi Chastain&#x27;s statue was added outside of the south gate. The statue portrays Brandi in her celebration of her winning penalty kick in the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup final, where she exposed her sports bra after removing her jersey. The image of her celebration was described in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;most iconic photograph ever taken of a female athlete&quot;, and it has been considered one of the more famous photographs of a woman celebrating an athletic victory. A statue to honor Keith Jackson, the longtime ABC broadcaster who had called many games from the Rose Bowl, was unveiled on December 14, 2019, at the stadium&#x27;s Rose Plaza. The commemorative bricks are located in front of Gate A. There are sections reserved for the City of Pasadena, Tournament of Roses, Rose Bowl, and each school of the Pac-12 and Big Ten conferences.

===Terry Donahue Pavilion===
The seven-story Terry Donahue Pavilion is named for the former UCLA football head coach, who was the most successful coach in UCLA and Pac-12 history. It houses the press boxes, broadcast booths, premium seating, boxes and suites. There are 54 luxury suites, 48 loge boxes, 1,200 club seats, state-of-the-art press boxes and a new broadcast center. The previous press box was replaced by a new self-contained media area capable of accommodating 318 credentialed working press, along with a separate level dedicated to game day operations, including TV and radio broadcasting, instant replay booths, coaching staffs and an emergency command center. The radio and TV booths were renamed &quot;The Keith Jackson Broadcast Center&quot; in December 2015. Jackson, the former ABC-TV sportscaster, coined the phrase &quot;The Granddaddy of Them All&quot; for the Rose Bowl game.

===1922 Locker Room Museum===
The old 1922 Rose Bowl locker room was restored in 2017 and converted into a little museum. Sections are dedicated to the construction of the Rose Bowl, the Rose Bowl games, UCLA football, and the NFL Super Bowl games played at the Rose Bowl.

===Venue rankings===
In 1999, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; listed the Rose Bowl at number 20 in the Top 20 Venues of the 20th Century. In 2007, Sports Illustrated named the Rose Bowl the number one venue in college sports.

==Football==

===Rose Bowl Game===

The Rose Bowl stadium is best known in the U.S. for its hosting of the Rose Bowl, a postseason college football game. The game is played after the Tournament of Roses Parade on New Year&#x27;s Day, or, if January 1 is a Sunday, on Monday, January 2. The stadium&#x27;s name has given rise to the term &quot;bowl game&quot; for postseason football games, regardless of whether they are played in a bowl-shaped or &quot;Bowl&quot;-named stadium. The Rose Bowl Game is commonly referred to as &quot;The Granddaddy of Them All&quot; because of its stature as the oldest of all the bowl games. The visual of the afternoon sun setting on the San Gabriel Mountains on New Year&#x27;s Day is recognized as an important part of the tradition of the game. Since 1945, the Rose Bowl has been the highest attended college football bowl game.

Since its opening, the Rose Bowl stadium has hosted the bowl game every year except in 1942 and 2021. The 1942 Rose Bowl was moved to Durham, North Carolina, at the campus of Duke University. Duke, which played in the game on January 1, volunteered to host the contest because of security concerns on the West Coast in the weeks following the attack on Pearl Harbor. The 2021 Rose Bowl was played at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas due to capacity restrictions in place in California due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

===BCS National Championship===

Starting with the 1998 season, the Rose Bowl became part of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). The 2002 and 2006 games also were the BCS Championship games, matching the #1 and #2 BCS teams in the nation. The 2010 BCS National Championship Game was played six days after the Rose Bowl game as a completely separate event from the Tournament of Roses, though it managed the event. The stadium hosted the 2014 BCS National Championship Game, the final game before the BCS was replaced by the current College Football Playoff, when it celebrated its 100th anniversary of the Rose Bowl game.

&quot;Note: *USC later vacated all wins during the season.&quot;

===College Football Playoff semifinals===

The Rose Bowl Game is one of the six primary bowls of the College Football Playoff (CFP), which replaced the BCS effective with the 2014 season. Every three years, the Rose Bowl will match two of the top four teams selected by the system&#x27;s selection committee to compete for a spot at the national championship game. The first CFP semifinal game at the Rose Bowl was the 2015 Rose Bowl, whose winner advanced to the championship game on January 12 at AT&amp;T Stadium in Texas. AT&amp;T Stadium later hosted the 2021 Rose Bowl, also a CFP semifinal, with limited attendance due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Though the Rose Bowl is eligible to bid on hosting the College Football Playoff Championship Game in years it is not hosting a semifinal, it has no plans to do so. The first championship game held in Southern California was at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood in January 2023.

===College Football Playoff quarterfinals===

===UCLA Bruins football===


The Rose Bowl stadium has been the home football field for UCLA since 1982. The UCLA Bruins had played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum since 1928. There was an attempt to build a 44,000-seat stadium on campus, at the site where Drake Stadium eventually was built. However, the proposal was blocked by influential area residents, as well as some politicians.

At the start of the 1982 NFL season, with the Oakland Raiders scheduled to move into the Coliseum, UCLA decided to relocate its home games to the Rose Bowl Stadium. The Bruins went on to play two straight Rose Bowl games in their new home stadium, the 1983 Rose Bowl and the 1984 Rose Bowl. UCLA has participated in five Rose Bowl games since moving to the stadium. The stadium is the host of the UCLA–USC rivalry football game on even numbered years, alternating with the Coliseum. In the first rivalry game at the stadium between UCLA and USC in 1982, USC fans sat on the west side of the stadium and UCLA fans sat on the east side of the stadium, mirroring an arrangement that existed when the teams shared the Coliseum. Both teams also wore their home uniforms. In 1984, USC fans were moved to the end zone seats, which ended the tradition of shared stadium. Because of the shared arrangement, and the participation of USC in a number of Rose Bowl games, both schools have winning records in each other&#x27;s home stadium. The Bruins travel 26 miles from campus to Pasadena to play home games, but only 14 miles to their biggest road game at USC every other year. The Bruins have played 12 Rose Bowl games in the stadium. The attendance of 105,464 for the 1976 Rose Bowl is the largest crowd to ever watch a UCLA football game in the stadium. It is a record that is not likely to be broken, as the Rose Bowl seating has been reduced to 91,136 for UCLA Bruins Football and 92,542 for the Rose Bowl Game.

===Caltech Beavers football===
Caltech, a university located in Pasadena, played most home games in the Rose Bowl from the time of its construction until the school dropped football in 1993. Caltech jovially claimed to play before the greatest number of empty seats in the nation.

===Junior Rose Bowl===
The stadium hosted the Junior Rose Bowl from 1946 to 1971 and 1976 to 1977. Between 1946 and 1966 and 1976 and 1977, the game pitted the California Junior College football champions against the NJCAA football champions for the national championship. It was organized by the Pasadena Junior Chamber of Commerce. The Junior Rose Bowl became the Pasadena Bowl from 1967 to 1971; it was billed as the Junior Rose Bowl the first two years, but instead two teams from the NCAA College Division competed (then later the University Division, usually featuring teams that were not invited to other major bowls).

=== The Pasadena Turkey Tussle ===
The Turkey Tussle is a football game that takes place at the Rose Bowl Stadium between the two rival schools in the Pasadena Unified School District. The yearly competition between John Muir High School and what is now Pasadena High School began in the 1940s. Before switching to the current games within Pasadena High School and John Muir High School, the event initially featured Pasadena Community College and John Muir Junior College (CBS News). The stadium usually gets hundreds of fans, students, alumni, and parents/families from both sides filling the seats at the Rose Bowl Stadium. The winner of the football matchup takes home the iconic Victory Bell, which is then displayed in the halls of either school.

===1983 Army–Navy game===
The Rose Bowl stadium is the only site west of the Mississippi River to host an Army–Navy Game (1983). The city of Pasadena paid for the traveling expenses of all the students and supporters of both the U.S. Naval Academy and U.S. Military Academy. The attendance was 81,000. The game was brought to the Rose Bowl as there are a large number of military installations and servicemen and women, along with many retired military personnel, on the West Coast. While the game has been held in multiple locations, only the 1926 game in Chicago, this 1983 game, and the 2023 game in Boston have been played outside the Mid-Atlantic region. The game is most frequently played in Philadelphia, followed by the New York area and the Baltimore–Washington area.

===Super Bowl===

The stadium has hosted the Super Bowl five times. The first was Super Bowl XI in January 1977, when the Oakland Raiders beat the Minnesota Vikings 32–14. The game was also played there in 1980 (XIV), 1983 (XVII), 1987 (XXI) and 1993 (XXVII). The Rose Bowl is one of two venues (with Stanford Stadium) to host a Super Bowl though having never served as the full-time home stadium for an NFL or AFL team (Stanford Stadium hosted one San Francisco 49ers game after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake).

The NFL has a policy limiting the hosting of a Super Bowl to metropolitan areas with NFL teams. The Rose Bowl was not considered as a Super Bowl site after the Rams and Raiders departed the Los Angeles area in . The most recent Super Bowl held in Southern California was Super Bowl (LVI) in February 2022 at the Rams&#x27; and Chargers&#x27; SoFi Stadium in Inglewood (the Rams returned to Los Angeles in 2016, the Chargers the following year).
Although proposed, no NFL team has called the Rose Bowl a regular season home. After losing both its local teams in the Los Angeles market in 1995, the National Football League began looking to either start or relocate a franchise to the Los Angeles area. The closest the Rose Bowl came to being the home of an NFL team was in 1996 when the Seattle Seahawks announced a relocation to Los Angeles with the Rose Bowl as their planned stadium but the move was blocked by the NFL. After many years of varying offers, no deal could be struck between the NFL owners, the stadium&#x27;s owner, and the City of Pasadena, following a vote of disapproval by its residents in November 2006.

On November 19, 2012, Pasadena officials approved a proposal which could have allowed an NFL team to temporarily play in the Rose Bowl. The Rose Bowl, however, never ended up acting as a home field for an NFL team. When the Los Angeles Rams moved from St. Louis prior to the 2016 NFL season, the Rose Bowl was considered as a temporary home before the Rams ultimately settled on playing in USC&#x27;s Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Rams&#x27; home from 1946 to 1979. The Los Angeles Chargers went to Dignity Health Sports Park as their temporary venue in 2017.

==Soccer ==
Though best known as an American football stadium, the Rose Bowl is also one of the most decorated soccer (association football) venues in the world. The stadium hosted the prestigious 1994 FIFA World Cup Final (an event watched by over 700 million people worldwide), the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup Final (at the time the most attended women&#x27;s soccer match in history), and the 1984 Olympic Gold Medal Match, making it the only venue in the world to host all three of international soccer&#x27;s major championship matches. The United States men&#x27;s national soccer team has played 17 games in the Rose Bowl, the fourth most of any venue. It has hosted 5 U.S. women&#x27;s national team matches. It has also hosted MLS Cup 1998 and the 2002 and 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup Finals. Mexico has played a number of friendlies in the stadium against nations other than the United States.

In the past, it was also the home ground of two North American Soccer League clubs, the Los Angeles Wolves in 1968 and the Los Angeles Aztecs in 1978 and 1979. From 1996 through 2002, the stadium was the home ground of Major League Soccer club Los Angeles Galaxy. The stadium once again hosted the Galaxy on July 4, 2023, in a one-off game (nicknamed El Tráfico) with city rivals Los Angeles FC, being previously delayed from its original date of February 25, 2023. The match set a new MLS attendance record for a standalone match, with 82,110 spectators.

=== Major soccer tournaments ===
The Rose Bowl is one of two stadiums to have hosted the FIFA World Cup finals for both men and women. The Rose Bowl hosted the men&#x27;s final in 1994 and the women&#x27;s final in 1999. (The only other stadium with this honor is the Råsunda Stadium near Stockholm, Sweden, which hosted the men&#x27;s final in 1958 and the women&#x27;s final in 1995.) Both Rose Bowl finals were scoreless after double extra time and decided on penalty shootouts; Brazil beating Italy in the 1994 FIFA World Cup Final 3–2, and the United States beating China in the 1999 women&#x27;s final 5–4.

The Rose Bowl also hosted group stage matches of the Copa América Centenario in 2016. It also hosted several matches including the final of the 1984 Olympics men&#x27;s soccer tournament. On July 27, 2016, the Rose Bowl hosted a 2016 International Champions Cup match between Chelsea and Liverpool. Chelsea won the match 1–0. The Rose Bowl also hosted a 2018 International Champions Cup match between F.C. Barcelona and Tottenham Hotspur where Barcelona won 5–3 in penalty kicks after a 2–2 draw. It has also regularly featured CONCACAF Gold Cup matches including two finals.

The Rose Bowl was a candidate to host matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, but FIFA selected SoFi Stadium instead. The Rose Bowl will be a venue during the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics.

==Other events and usage==

===Pasadena events===

The Rose Bowl has hosted the Pasadena &quot;Americafest&quot; Independence Day celebration annually since 1927. The annual fireworks show is considered one of the top fireworks shows in the nation. In 2023, AmericaFest did not take place, being replaced by a rescheduled El Tráfico (originally scheduled for February 25), however a firework show did occur after the game. Another local event is the Rose Bowl Flea Market held the second Sunday of each month, on the stadium parking lots. Hosted by promoter R.G. Canning, it claims to be the largest Flea market on the West Coast. The stadium hosts the annual &quot;Turkey Tussle&quot; homecoming football game between John Muir High School and Pasadena High School, in late October. The Rose Bowl hosted its annual graduation ceremonies for Blair High School, John Muir High School and Pasadena High School until 1984, before staging it at the individual schools until 1998. Currently all three high schools along with John Marshall Fundamental Secondary School hold their graduation ceremonies at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in early June until 2019. On June 4, 2021, the Pasadena Unified School District used the Rose Bowl to hold their high school graduation ceremonies for all four high schools, along with Rose City High School and Center for Independent Studies.

===1932 Summer Olympics===

The Rose Bowl was the track cycling venue for the 1932 Summer Olympics.

===Concerts===
===Other events===
The stadium was used for midget car racing in the 1940s and early 1950s.

The stadium held its first country music festival in June 1981, named A Day in the Country.
The event was produced by Richard Flanzer of AtlanticPacific Music.

The stadium hosted the 2007 Drum Corps International World Championships August 7 through August 11, 2007. The Rose Bowl was the final stadium to host the championship before DCI moved their corporate offices to Indianapolis with the championships being held at Lucas Oil Stadium until at least 2028. This was the first (and only) time the DCI championships had ever been held west of Denver, Colorado in the 45-year history of DCI.

It hosted auditions for the top American television show, &quot;American Idol&quot;, on August 8, 2006. The stadium has also been used as part of the music video shoot for the song &quot;The Last Song&quot;, the second single released by the American rock band the All-American Rejects, which features the band performing the song in the middle of the stadium to an empty crowd.

The stadium&#x27;s Court of Champions was the site of a &quot;Roadblock&quot; from seventeenth season of the CBS reality TV show &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; where teams had to help decorate three sections of the theme float for the 2011 New Year&#x27;s Day Rose Parade.

In November 1997, the International Churches of Christ (Los Angeles) gathered at the Rose Bowl for their Worship Service, with an attendance of 17,000.

The Brookside Golf Course hosted the Los Angeles Open on the PGA Tour in 1968, won by Billy Casper in late January.

The Rose Bowl was used for high school graduation ceremonies for the Alhambra Unified School District&#x27;s Alhambra High School, Mark Keppel High School and San Gabriel High School on May 27, 2021, La Cañada Unified School District&#x27;s La Cañada High School on June 3, 2021, and Glendale Unified School District&#x27;s Glendale High School and Herbert Hoover High School on June 10, 2021, and Crescenta Valley High School on June 11, 2021, instead of holding at their respective campuses due to the COVID-19 restrictions.

==Present status==
The Rose Bowl and adjacent golf course are managed by the Rose Bowl Operating Company, a non-profit organization whose board is selected by council members of the City of Pasadena. UCLA and the Pasadena Tournament of Roses also have one member on the company board. In 2007 it was reported that Rose Bowl stadium itself runs on a yearly operational loss. While it generated funds with the annual lease with UCLA ($1.5 million), the Tournament of Roses ($900,000), and a regularly hosted flea market ($900,000), it makes up the loss by relying on funds generated by the adjacent city-owned golf course ($2 million). The stadium at the time was unable to finance many of the capital improvements it needed to be considered a modern facility, including new seats, wider aisles, additional exits, a wider concourse, a renovated press box, a state-of-the-art video scoreboard, new field lighting, ribbon boards, extra suites and a club. The estimated cost for such improvements ranges from $250 million and $300 million. The stadium had long-term leases with its two major tenants, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses (2019) and UCLA (2023). In 2006, the Rose Bowl and the City of Pasadena launched a $16.3 million capital improvement program that benefited both UCLA and the Tournament of Roses. New locker rooms for both UCLA and visiting teams, as well as a new media interview area were constructed. The USC Athletic department attempted to negotiate with the Rose Bowl to play games there in 2007, out of concerns that the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission would not negotiate, in a decade-long rent impasse between the commission and the university.

In April 2009, The Rose Bowl Operating Company unveiled a Rose Bowl Strategic Plan, which addressed the objectives to improve public safety; enhance fan experience; maintain national historic landmark status; develop revenue sources to fund long-term improvements; and enhance facility operations. On October 11, 2010, the Pasadena City Council approved a $152 million financing plan for the major renovation of the stadium. Groundbreaking ceremonies for the first of three phases of the project were held on January 25, 2011. The newly constructed video board was used for the June 25, 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup Final. The costs increased as the project went on, and by December 2012 were estimated at $194 Million and the project to be completed by 2015. The Rose Bowl and UCLA leases were extended to 2043 and 2044 respectively. The renovations were completed in 2016.
In 2019, the Rose Bowl reported a profit of $335,000 However, golf course usage has declined year after year, and UCLA football attendance has waned. The stadium had reported $211.8 million in outstanding debt at the beginning of 2020. The Rose Bowl is limited by law to 15 events per year with more than 20,000 in attendance. But it can host an unlimited number of small events, such as weddings, for which it made $1.5 million in 2019.

In 2024, Stephen A. Smith proposed moving The Rose Bowl Game from the Rose Bowl. His argument being traffic to and from the stadium was unacceptable, taking way too long for fans to arrive at the stadium and leave in a timely manner. His proposed alternative being newly built SoFi Stadium for the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers as it has much better supporting infrastructure and location in Inglewood. This was immediately slammed by college football fans calling it the worst take of all time, noting the Rose Bowl as an important site in the history of both college and professional sports. In December 2024, it was announced that the Rose Bowl would be renovated to prepare for the 2028 Summer Olympics by adding one of the largest video boards, field level clubs, improved seats, and add new field level clubs.

<text>The tamarillo (&quot;Solanum betaceum&quot;) is a tree or shrub in the flowering plant family Solanaceae (the nightshade family). It bears the tamarillo, an egg-shaped edible fruit. It is also known as the &quot;tree tomato&quot;, &quot;tomate de árbol&quot;, &quot;tomate andino&quot;, &quot;tomate serrano&quot;, &quot;blood fruit&quot;, &quot;poor man&#x27;s tomato&quot;, &quot;tomate de yuca&quot;, &quot;tomate de españa&quot;, &quot;sachatomate&quot;, &quot;berenjena&quot;, &quot;chilto&quot; and &quot;tamamoro&quot; in South America, &quot;tyamtar&quot;, &quot;rambheda&quot; or &quot;rukh tamatar&quot; (lit. tree tomatoes) in Nepal, and &quot;terong Belanda&quot; (Dutch eggplant) in Indonesia. It is popular globally, especially in Peru, Colombia, New Zealand, Ecuador, Nepal, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Australia, and Bhutan.

== Description ==

=== Plant origin and regions of cultivation ===
The tamarillo is native to the Andes of Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina and Bolivia. Today it is still cultivated in gardens and small orchards for local production, and it is one of the most popular fruits in these regions. Other regions of cultivation are the subtropical areas throughout the world, such as Ethiopia, Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, Nepal, Hong Kong, China, the United States, Australia, Bhutan, New Zealand and Nagaland, Manipur, Darjeeling and Sikkim in India. It has also been seen in Cantabria, a province in Spain.

The tamarillo is a fruit harvested permanently in Colombia, the average annual production exceeds 150,000 tons. Antioquia has the largest number of hectares planted with La Meseta being the place where more than 900 hectares are located and from which the main cities of the country are supplied.

In 1993, in New Zealand, about 2,000 tons were produced on 200 hectares of land and exported to the United States. By 2020, there was a decrease from 150 after the discovery of the tomato potato psyllid (TPP) in 2006. This was reflected in a corresponding reduction in volume from 800 tonnes worth $3.5 million, to 250 tonnes valued at $1.3 million at that time. In 2021, growers sold 414 tonnes through the domestic wholesalers at a value of $3.1 million, and 8 tonnes exported to the USA from two growers at a value of $0.02 million. For the export, the existing marketing channels developed for the kiwifruit are used.

The first internationally marketed crop of tamarillos in Australia was produced around 1996.

The tamarillo is also successfully grown at higher elevations of Malaysia and the Philippines, Ethiopia and in Puerto Rico. In the hot tropical lowlands, it develops only small fruits and fruit setting is seldom.

Prior to 1967, the fruit was known as the &#x27;tree tomato&#x27;, but the New Zealand Tree Tomato Promotions Council dubbed it the &#x27;tamarillo&#x27; in order to distinguish it from the ordinary garden tomato and increase its exotic appeal. However, the name &#x27;tamarillo&#x27; is not universally used, and this plant has a different name in many regions.

=== Plant ===

The plant is a fast-growing tree that grows up to 5 metres. Peak production is reached after 4 years, and the life expectancy is about 5 to 12 years. The tree usually forms a single upright trunk with lateral branches. The flowers and fruits hang from the lateral branches. The leaves are large, simple and perennial, and have a strong pungent smell. The flowers are pink-white, and form clusters of 10 to 50 flowers. They produce 1 to 6 fruits per cluster. Plants can set fruit without cross-pollination, but the flowers are fragrant and attract insects. Cross-pollination seems to improve fruit set. The roots are shallow and not very pronounced, therefore the plant is not tolerant of drought stress and can be damaged by strong winds. Tamarillos will hybridize with many other solanaceae, though the hybrid fruits will be sterile, and unpalatable in some instances.

=== Fruit ===
The fruits are egg-shaped and about 4-10 centimeters long. Their color varies from yellow and orange to red and almost purple. Sometimes they have dark, longitudinal stripes. Red fruits are more sour, yellow and orange fruits are sweeter. The flesh has a firm texture and contains more and larger seeds than a common tomato. The fruits are very high in vitamins and iron and low in calories (only about 40 calories per fruit).

== Cultivation ==

=== Soil and climate requirements ===
The tamarillo prefers a subtropical climate, with rainfall between 600 and 4000 millimeters and annual temperatures between 15 and 20 °C. It is intolerant to frost (below -2 °C) and drought stress. It is assumed that fruit set is affected by night temperatures. Areas where citrus are cultivated provide good conditions for tamarillos as well, such as in the Mediterranean climate.
Tamarillo plants grow best in light, deep, fertile soils, although they are not very demanding. However, soils must be permeable since the plants are not tolerant to water-logging. They grow naturally on soils with a pH of 5 to 8.5.

=== Growth ===
Propagation is possible by both using seeds or cuttings. Seedlings first develop a straight, about 1.5 to 1.8 meters tall trunk, before they branch out. Propagation by seeds is easy and ideal in protected environments. However, in orchards with different cultivars, cross-pollination will occur and characteristics of the cultivars get mixed up. Seedlings should be kept in the nursery until they reach a height of 1 to 1.5 metres as they are very frost-sensitive.

Plants grown from cuttings branch out earlier and result in more shrub-like plants that are more suitable for exposed sites. Cuttings should be made from basal and aerial shoots, and should be free of pathogenic viruses. Plants grown from cuttings should be kept in the nursery until they reach a height of 0.5 to 1 meter.

The tree grows very quickly and is able to bear fruit after 1.5 to 2 years. The plant is daylength-insensitive. The fruits do not mature simultaneously, unless the tree has been pruned. A single tree can produce more than 20 kg of fruit per year; an orchard yields in 15 to 17 tons per hectare. One single mature tree in good soil will bear more fruit than a typical family can eat in about 3 months.

Tamarillos are suitable for growing as indoor container plants, though their swift growth, their light, water and humidity requirements and their large leaves can pose a challenge to those with limited space.

=== Plant management ===

The tamarillo trees are adaptable and very easy to grow. However, some plant management strategies can help to stabilize and improve plant performance.

==== Planting ====
Planting distances depend on the growing system. In New Zealand, with mechanized production, single row planting distances of 1 to 1.5 metres between plants and 4.5 to 5 metres between rows are recommended. In traditional growing regions such as the Andean region, plantations are much more dense, with 1.2 to 1.5 metres between plants. Dense planting can be a strategy to protect plants against wind. On poorly drained soils, plants should be planted on ridges.

==== Pruning ====
Pruning can help to control fruit size, plant size, harvest date and to simplify the harvesting of fruits. Cutting the tip of young plants leads to the desired branch height. Once the tree shape has been formed, pruning is reduced to the removal of old or dead wood and previously fruited branches, since branches that have already carried fruits will produce smaller fruits with lower quality the next time. Light pruning leads to medium-sized, heavy pruning to large-sized fruits. Basal shoots should be removed. When plants are grown in greenhouses, pruning prevents excessive vegetative growth.

When the tree is about 1 to 1.5 metres in height, it is advisable to cut the roots on one side and lean the tree to the other (in the direction of the midday sun at about 30 to 45 degrees). This allows fruiting branches to grow all along the trunk rather than just at the top.

==== Mulching ====
Since the plants are sensitive to drought stress, mulching can help to preserve moisture in the soil. It can also be a strategy to suppress weeds, as other soil management techniques, such as plowing, are not possible due to the shallow and sensitive root system.

====Shelter====
The plants have to be protected from wind. Their shallow root system does not provide enough stability, and the lateral branches are fragile and break easily when carrying fruits.

====Irrigation and fertilization====
To maximize and stabilize production, water and nutrient inputs should be provided when needed. The plants need continuous supply of water due to their shallow root system. Drought stress results in a decrease of plant growth, fruit size and productivity. Recommended fertilizer rates per hectare are 170 kg of nitrogen, 45 kg of phosphorus and 130 to 190 kg of potassium for intensive New Zealand production systems. Phosphorus and potassium are applied in the beginning of the season; nitrogen applications are distributed throughout the year.

====Pest management====
The tamarillo tree is, compared to similar crops such as tomatoes, quite resistant to pests in general. Still, to reduce risk in intensive production systems, some pests have to be controlled to avoid major crop damage. To control pests, the same control methods as for other &quot; Solanaceae&quot; can be used.
=== Harvest ===
Ripening of fruits is not simultaneous. Several harvests are necessary. In climates with little annual variation, tamarillo trees can flower and set fruit throughout the year. In climates with pronounced seasons (such as New Zealand), fruits ripen in autumn. Premature harvest and ethylene induced ripening in controlled-atmosphere chambers is possible with minimal loss of fruit quality. The fragile lateral branches can break easily when loaded with fruits, so premature harvest helps to reduce this risk and allows storage of fruits up to 20 days at room temperature. A cold-water dipping process, developed by the New Zealand Department of Scientific and Industrial Research also allows further storage of 6–10 weeks.

==Usage==

===Culinary use===
The fruit is eaten by scooping the flesh from a halved fruit. When lightly sugared and chilled, the flesh is used for a breakfast dish. Some people in New Zealand cut the fruit in half, scoop out the pulpy flesh and spread it on toast. Yellow-fruited cultivars have a sweeter flavor, occasionally compared to mango or apricot. The red-fruited variety, which is much more widely cultivated, is more tart, and the savory aftertaste is far more pronounced. In the Northern Hemisphere, tamarillos are most frequently available from July until November, and fruits early in the season tend to be sweeter and less astringent.

They can be made into compotes, or added to hollandaise, chutneys and curries. Desserts using this fruit include bavarois and, combined with apples, a strudel.
In Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Venezuela, and parts of Indonesia (including Sumatra and Sulawesi), fresh tamarillos are frequently blended together with water and sugar to make a juice. It is also available as a commercially pasteurized purée.

In Nepal, a version of the South American fruit is very popular. It is typically consumed as a chutney or a pickle during the autumn and winter months. It is known as &quot;Tyamtar&quot; and &quot;Ram Bheda&quot;. The fruit is boiled or roasted in open fire till the skin breaks and then mashed with chillies, timur, garlic and other spices of choice. Similar to Nepal, the Indian regions of Ooty, Darjeeling and Sikkim also consume Tamarillo. In Northeast India, it is roasted and chutneys are made with it by blending roasted or fried dried or fermented fish, chillies and garlic. In Ecuador, the tamarillo, known as &quot;tomate de árbol&quot;, is blended with chili peppers to make a hot sauce commonly consumed with local dishes of the Andean region. The sauce is simply referred to as &quot;ají&quot; and is present at a wide variety of meals in Ecuador.

In Rwanda, tree tomatoes are often served alongside other tropical fruits, such as mango and pineapple.

In Yunnan, China, the Dai people make a tamarillo &quot;nanpie&quot;, a sauce like dish made with roasted tamarillo, sawtooth coriander, chillies and garlic.

The flesh of the tamarillo is tangy and variably sweet, with a bold and complex flavor, and may be compared to kiwifruit, tomato, guava, or passion fruit. The skin and the flesh near it have a bitter taste and are not usually eaten raw.

The tamarillo has been described as having a taste similar to that of a passion fruit and a piquant tomato combined. 

The red and purple types of fruits are preferred in import countries of Europe: Even though they taste more acidic, their color is favoured by consumers.

===Industrial use===
The fruits are high in pectin and therefore have good properties for preserves. However, they oxidize and lose color when not treated. Yellow fruit types are better suited to industrial use.

== Prospects ==
Research and breeding should improve plantation management, fruit quality and postharvest treatment. A better understanding of plant physiology, nutritional requirements of plants and fruit set mechanisms will help to improve growing systems. Breeding goals are to break seed dormancy, to improve sweetness of fruits and to increase yield. For industrial uses, little &quot;stones&quot; of sodium and calcium that occasionally appear in the fruit skin form a problem. Those stones have to be eliminated by breeding.

==Naga Tree Tomato==
Tamarillo is known as Naga Tree Tomato in Nagaland, and it is registered under the Geographical Indications (GI) of Nagaland by Government of India. It is locally called &quot;Si Binyano&quot; or &quot;Khwüdi&quot;.

<doc id="1217510" wikidata="Q1201739" url="?curid=1217510" title="WWE Bad Blood">
<text>WWE Bad Blood (originally stylized as Badd Blood) is a professional wrestling event produced by WWE, a Connecticut-based professional wrestling promotion. The event was first held in October 1997 when the promotion was still called the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and that first event was held as the 18th In Your House pay-per-view (PPV) event. After six years and after the promotion had been renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), Bad Blood returned as its own PPV event in June 2003, replacing King of the Ring. In 2005, One Night Stand replaced Bad Blood; Vengeance had also moved to June that year as The Great American Bash moved to July. Bad Blood had been announced to be revived in 2017; however, these plans were scrapped in favor of an event titled Great Balls of Fire. After a 20-year hiatus, Bad Blood returned in October 2024, and became the first Bad Blood to air on WWE&#x27;s livestreaming platforms.

The first Bad Blood is known for introducing the Hell in a Cell match, a 20-foot high roofed cell structure that surrounds the ring and ringside area. It has been contested at every Bad Blood with the match headlining the events in 1997, 2003, and 2004. To coincide with the first brand extension, the 2003 and 2004 Bad Blood events were both held exclusively for wrestlers of the Raw brand division. The brand split ended in 2011 but it returned in 2016. Since April 2018, all of WWE&#x27;s main roster PPV and livestreaming events have featured wrestlers from both the Raw and SmackDown brands.

==History==

Bad Blood was first held as an In Your House pay-per-view (PPV) event. In Your House was a series of monthly PPVs first produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in May 1995. They aired when the promotion was not holding one of its major PPVs and were sold at a lower cost. Badd Blood: In Your House was the 18th In Your House event and took place on October 5, 1997, at the Kiel Center in St. Louis, Missouri. The event was notable for introducing the Hell in a Cell match and the debut of Kane.

In May 2002, the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as a result of a lawsuit from the World Wildlife Fund over the &quot;WWF&quot; initialism. Also around this time, the promotion held a draft that split its roster into two distinctive brands of wrestling, Raw and SmackDown!, where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform. In 2003, WWE reinstated Bad Blood as its own PPV (with the stylization being &quot;Bad Blood&quot; instead of the previous &quot;Badd Blood&quot;) to replace the previously annual King of the Ring PPV; King of the Ring ceased being produced as a PPV (until 2024), but the titular tournament continued to be produced periodically. To coincide with the brand extension, both the 2003 and 2004 Bad Blood events, which were both held in June, exclusively featured wrestlers from the Raw brand. Like the original event, the 2003 and 2004 events featured a Hell in a Cell match as the main event. After the 2004 event, however, Bad Blood was discontinued and doubly replaced by One Night Stand and Vengeance; the latter had also moved into the June slot as The Great American Bash moved into the July slot that Vengeance previously held.

In March 2017, WWE announced that it would be reviving Bad Blood to be held on July 9, 2017, from the XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut. However, these plans were scrapped in favor of an event titled Great Balls of Fire. After 20 years since the last Bad Blood event, WWE announced that Bad Blood would in fact return and be held at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia on October 5, 2024, the 27-year anniversary of the first Bad Blood. Like the previous editions, the 2024 event also featured the Hell in a Cell match but it opened that year&#x27;s show instead of closing it. This would also be the first Bad Blood to air via WWE&#x27;s livestreaming platforms, a medium that WWE began using in 2014. The event also featured wrestlers from both Raw and SmackDown as WWE&#x27;s pay-per-view and livestreaming events have featured wrestlers from both since 2018.

<doc id="1217519" wikidata="Q1559651" url="?curid=1217519" title="Paul Cosgrove">
<text>Paul James Cosgrove, (born December 30, 1934), is a former Canadian jurist as well as a former politician.

==Political career==
A lawyer by profession, Cosgrove entered municipal politics and served as mayor of the Toronto suburb of Scarborough, Ontario from 1973 until 1978.

Cosgrove entered federal politics running as the Liberal Party candidate in York—Scarborough in a 1978 by-election for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada. He was defeated in that run, as well as in the 1979 election.

In the 1980 election, however, Cosgrove was elected, and was appointed Minister of Public Works, Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and Minister responsible for National Capital Commission in the Canadian Cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.

He was reassigned in a 1982 cabinet shuffle to the position of Minister of State for Finance. He was dropped from the Cabinet in August 1983 but remained an MP until the dissolution of parliament the next year.

==Judicial career==
Cosgrove retired from the House of Commons to accept an appointment by John Turner to the bench of the Ontario Superior Court on July 9, 1984, shortly after Parliament was dissolved for the 1984 election. Cosgrove&#x27;s judicial circuit was in eastern Ontario with his court based in Brockville, Ontario.

In 1999, Judge Cosgrove stayed charges of murder against Julia Elliott after a 22-month trial. He ruled that the Crown attorney, police and a deputy attorney general had committed 150 constitutional violations, findings that were unanimously rejected by the Ontario Court of Appeal in the fall of 2003 with the Court ordering a new trial. Julia Elliott subsequently pleaded guilty to manslaughter.

As a result, the attorney-general of Ontario, Michael Bryant filed a complaint against Cosgrove, calling him unfit to be a judge, and accusing him of sullying reputations and of having &quot;vilified the state&quot;. As a result of the complaint, Cosgrove was suspended pending a hearing into his conduct that was scheduled for December 2004. Cosgrove complained to the Canadian Judicial Council that the scheduled hearing was unconstitutional and damaging to judicial independence. His lawyer claimed that Bryant&#x27;s action created a situation in which the Attorney-General could punish judges for making controversial decisions, since a complaint by an Attorney-General automatically would result in suspension pending a hearing. According to Cosgrove&#x27;s lawyer:

:It creates a &#x27;chilling effect&#x27; that will undermine the ability of judges to adjudicate fearlessly cases, as justice requires. This chilling effect undermines and is wholly inconsistent with judicial independence.

According to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper, Cosgrove&#x27;s affidavit warned that judges might become afraid to criticize or rule against the Crown if they thought a vindictive attorney-general could, in effect, end their careers simply by lodging a complaint. The consequences of this were argued to be so negative that the process effectively permitted an attorney-general to become &quot;the judge in his own cause&quot;. .

Both the Canadian Superior Courts Judges Association and the Ontario Criminal Lawyers&#x27; Association supported Cosgrove&#x27;s case.

In October, 2005, the trial division of the Federal Court of Canada ruled in favor of Judge Cosgrove and stripped the attorney-general of the power to force the Canadian Judicial Council to conduct hearings that could remove judges from the bench.

The federal court ruling temporarily halted the proceedings against Judge Cosgrove who had been on a paid leave of absence since Bryant&#x27;s April 2004 request for a disciplinary hearing. On March 12, 2007, however, the appellate division of the Federal Court of Canada reversed the trial division, and found against Justice Cosgrove. The Federal Court of Appeal set aside the decision of the Federal Court, dismissed the application for judicial review, and referred the matter back to the Inquiry Committee of the Canadian Judicial Council.

On December 4, 2008, in a 4-1 decision, a committee of the Canadian Judicial Council found grounds for recommending to the federal justice minister that Cosgrove be removed from office.

The full Canadian Judicial Council, made up of the 22 of Canada&#x27;s chief justices and senior judges, met to consider the committee&#x27;s recommendation and, on March 31, 2009, formally recommended to Parliament that Cosgrove be removed saying that &quot;We find that Justice Cosgrove has failed in the execution of the duties of his judicial office and that public confidence in his ability to discharge those duties in the future has been irrevocably lost.&quot; The decision also stated that &quot;We find that there is no alternative measure to removal that would be sufficient to restore public confidence in the judge in this case.&quot; This was the second time in the council&#x27;s history that it has recommended the removal of a judge. The same recommendation was made in 1996 in regards to then Justice Jean Bienvenue who resigned rather than wait for Parliament to decide his fate.

On April 2, 2009, Cosgrove resigned from the bench. If he had not done so, and had also not taken the option of making an application to the Federal Court for a judicial review of the finding, the House of Commons and Senate would have had to vote on whether to remove him from office, something which has never happened since Canadian confederation.

<text>No New York is a no wave compilation album released in 1978 by record label Antilles under the curation of producer Brian Eno. Although it only contains songs by four different artists, it has been considered important in defining and documenting the scene and movement, with the name &quot;no wave&quot; being influenced by that of the album according to some accounts.

==Background and production==

Early in 1978, New York&#x27;s Artists Space hosted a five night underground no wave music festival, organized by artists Michael Zwack and Robert Longo, that featured ten local bands; including Rhys Chatham&#x27;s The Gynecologists, Communists, Glenn Branca&#x27;s Theoretical Girls, Terminal, Chatham&#x27;s Tone Death (performing his composition for electric guitars &quot;Guitar Trio&quot;) and Branca&#x27;s Daily Life (with Barbara Ess, Paul McMahon and Christine Hahn). The final two days of the show featured DNA and the Contortions on Friday, followed by Mars and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks on Saturday. English musician and producer Brian Eno, who had originally come to New York to produce the second Talking Heads album &quot;More Songs About Buildings and Food&quot;, was in the audience. Impressed by what he saw and heard, and advised by Diego Cortez to do so, Eno was convinced that this movement should be documented and proposed the idea of a compilation album with himself as a producer.

When Eno recorded &quot;No New York&quot;, some of the sessions were done without much of the stylized production he was known for on other artists&#x27; albums. James Chance stated that the Contortions tracks were &quot;done totally live in the studio, no separation between the instruments, no overdubs, just like a document.&quot; In 1979 Eno stated in his now famous lecture, &quot;The Studio as Compositional Tool&quot;, that, &quot;On &#x27;Helen Thormdale&#x27; from the &quot;No New York&quot; album, I put an echo on the guitar part&#x27;s click, and used that to trigger the compression on the whole track, so it sounds like helicopter blades.&quot;

== Release ==

&quot;No New York&quot; was released in 1978 by Antilles Records. The original pressing of the LP contained a lyric sheet that was intentionally printed on the inside of the record sleeve, which forced the owner to have to tear apart the sleeve to read the lyrics. The album was first reissued on CD by Island Records in Japan. It was reissued in 2005 by Lilith Records on vinyl and digipak form on CD.

==Reception==
Critic Richard C. Walls, writing for &quot;Creem&quot;, described &quot;No New York&quot; as the most &quot;ferociously avant-garde and aggressively ugly music since Albert Ayler puked all over my brain back in – what? – 64&quot; and stated &quot;If you&#x27;re intrepid enough to want to hear this stuff (a friend, 3/4 into the first side, complained that the music was painful – she wasn&#x27;t referring to any abstract reaction, she was grimacing), be advised that Antilles is a division of Island Records, which ain&#x27;t exactly Transamerica Corp. You&#x27;ll probably have to make a little effort to procure it, because there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s going to come to you.&quot;

Retrospective reviews of the album have been positive. Todd Kristel of the online music database AllMusic stated that &quot;this seminal album remains the definitive document of New York&#x27;s no wave movement&quot;, but also echoed Walls&#x27;s statement from 1978, saying, &quot;Some listeners may be fascinated by the music on &quot;No New York&quot; while others may find it unbearable&quot;.

In December 2007, &quot;Blender&quot; placed the album at number 65 on their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Indie-Rock Albums Ever&quot;.

<text>Belconnen Remand Centre, or BRC, was an Australian remand custody facility located in Belconnen, Australian Capital Territory, Australia. The centre opened in 1976 and closed in 2009. At times, it held a small number of illegal immigrants.

When it was first established in 1976, the Belconnen Remand Centre was intended to hold around 16 people. The centre&#x27;s construction had been considered and approved by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam&#x27;s Cabinet in 1973.

Four men escaped the remand centre in July 1988 through a roof in the exercise yard.

In December 1992, then ACT Attorney-General Terry Connolly flagged that the remand centre should be replaced, due to its outmoded architecture and the high operating costs identified at the time.

The ACT Government made the decision to build a new prison, the Alexander Maconochie Centre, and to decommission the Belconnen Remand Centre, in 2003.

A human rights audit of the operation of the Belconnen Remand Centre and other ACT correctional facilities was conducted in 2007, identifying issues to be avoided in the new Alexander Maconochie Centre, and matters to be improved in the meantime prior to the new prison&#x27;s establishment.

<doc id="1217544" wikidata="Q13118878" url="?curid=1217544" title="Paul Wiseman">
<text>Paul John Wiseman (born 4 May 1970) is a New Zealand former international cricketer. &quot;Wiz&quot;, as he was nicknamed, was an off spinner who took nine wickets in an innings for Canterbury against Central Districts in Christchurch to record the second best bowling figures in New Zealand domestic cricket. Internationally, however, he was unable to forge a significant career due to the incumbency of first-choice spinner Daniel Vettori. Wiseman was a member of the New Zealand team that won the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy.

==Domestic career==
Wiseman was born at Auckland in 1970 and educated at Long Bay College in the city. He played for Auckland age-group sides during the 1989–90 season before making his first-class cricket debut for the Auckland cricket team in January 1992. He played for the side for three seasons before moving to play for Otago in 1994–95. After 85 matches for Otago across seven seasons, Wiseman moved to play for Canterbury in 2001–02, playing another 85 matches for the side in the five seasons he played.

Having played for several seasons in English club cricket, including for Winchester Cricket Club and for Lancashire League sides Rishton and Haslingden, Wiseman spent the 2005 season as the professional with the Central Lancashire Cricket League side Milnrow. He made connections with Durham County Cricket Club, playing Second XI cricket for the county in 2005 before making his County Championship debut the following season. He signed for the side for the following two seasons and played 45 top-level matches for the side between 2006 and 2008. At the end of the 2009, having been overlooked for the spinners berth throughout the season in the county First XI, he retired from professional cricket at the age of 39.

==International career==
On his Test Match debut, he took five wickets in the second innings against Sri Lanka in Colombo in 1998.

==After cricket==
Wiseman returned to New Zealand taking up the position of Network Coach for Canterbury Cricket in October 2009. He led both the Canterbury Under 17 and Under 19 teams to wins at their National tournaments in the 2009/10 season.

Wiseman is the coach of the New Zealand national under-19 cricket team for the 2020 Under-19 Cricket World Cup in South Africa.

<doc id="1217547" wikidata="Q5239878" url="?curid=1217547" title="David Smith (Canadian senator)">
<text>David Paul Smith, (May 16, 1941 – February 26, 2020) was a Canadian lawyer, politician and senator.

==Municipal politics==
Smith was an alderman on Toronto City Council in the 1970s. He served a period as deputy mayor and president of city council. He ran for Mayor of Toronto in 1978, but was defeated by John Sewell in a three-way split. Smith became a backroom lobbyist for developers and was instrumental in helping Art Eggleton defeat Sewell in 1980.

==Member of Parliament==
After his defeat in municipal politics, Smith ran for and was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1980 election as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Don Valley East in a suburb of Toronto.

In 1982, he became Deputy Government House Leader, and joined the Canadian Cabinet in 1983 as Minister of State for Small Businesses and Tourism. Smith was appointed to the same position when John Turner succeeded Pierre Trudeau as Prime Minister of Canada in 1984. Smith was defeated in the subsequent 1984 election.

==Out of parliament==
Smith returned to the legal profession and served as Chairman Emeritus of Dentons LLP, one of Canada&#x27;s largest law firms. In the 1990s, he worked as a senior backroom adviser to Liberal leader Jean Chrétien and played a leading role in the party&#x27;s election campaigns.

==Senate career==
A Chrétien loyalist, Smith was appointed to the Senate in 2002 and was outspoken in his support for Chrétien against attempts by Paul Martin to force the Prime Minister to retire. After Martin became Liberal leader, Smith urged party unity.

He was a key backer of former Liberal leadership candidate Michael Ignatieff. He was later appointed by Liberal leader Stéphane Dion to serve as party&#x27;s National Campaign Co-Chair with Mark Marissen and Nancy Girard.

<doc id="1217553" wikidata="Q2504585" url="?curid=1217553" title="Unico">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Osamu Tezuka. It was serialized in Sanrio&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;&quot; from November 1976 to March 1979 and collected in two volumes. The series follows the titular unicorn as he uses his magic to help friends from around the world across different time periods. The series was drawn in a western style, being published in full color and read from left to right. It has since been published in different collections and has been adapted into film and comics. A modern-day reboot of the series began publication by Scholastic under its Graphix imprint in 2024.

== Plot ==
Unico is a young, innocent male unicorn who possesses a special ability to bring happiness to anyone near him. The story begins in ancient Greece with a young mortal girl named Psyche. She is the first friend to Unico, and is apparently so beautiful that the goddess Venus becomes jealous. The goddess attributes Psyche&#x27;s beauty to her happiness and decides to separate the two. After kidnapping Unico in an pet contest, she calls upon the second star, Zephyrus, also known as the West Wind. The West Wind is commanded to take Unico through space and time, to the Hill of Oblivion with no memories of Psyche where he will wander forever. The West Wind takes pity on Unico, and decides to pass over the Hill of Oblivion and send him to different places in different time periods. Unico befriends the people he meets there and helps them achieve happiness, before the West Wind takes him away once more to avoid detection from Venus, wiping his memories in the process.

In the 1981 film adaptation &quot;The Fantastic Adventures of Unico&quot;, the gods believe that only they should have the ability to control others&#x27; emotions and decide that Unico must die. However, the gods feel that punishment may be too harsh and instead choose to send the West Wind to capture Unico and take him to the Hill of Oblivion. Upon learning of the West Wind&#x27;s defiance, they send the Night Wind to capture Unico.

In the reboot series, Unicorns were born from &quot;life&#x27;s secret undercurrent&quot;, and the friendship between Unico and Psyche sends an inspiring force between people throughout time, angering Venus. After a long time of transporting Unico to different places, the West Wind follows a whisper promising to break the cycle, sending the unicorn to the modern day.

The movie&#x27;s other songs include &quot;Unico no Teemu&quot; (Unico&#x27;s Theme), &quot;Hontou wa Subishikute&quot;/&quot;Lonely&quot; (Beezle/Akuma-kun&#x27;s image song), and &quot;Majo Neko Chao&quot; (Witch Cat Chao)/&quot;Katy The Kitty Witch&quot;, all sung by Iruka, O&#x27;Connell or Banquells. For the US release, all of the songs were dubbed into English along with the spoken dialogue, except for the ending song over the closing credits, which is an instrumental in the English version. Unico was voiced by Katsue Miwa in the original version, Barbara Goodson in the English dub, and Helena Rojo in the Spanish dub.

==== &quot;Unico in the Island of Magic&quot; ====
Moribi Murano (often miscredited as &quot;Mami Sugino&quot;) directed the second movie, titled in Japanese and &quot;Unico in the Island of Magic&quot; in English, which was released to Japanese theaters on July 16, 1983, five days before the release of the first &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot; movie, which used many of the same production staff. It was also released direct-to-video in the United States by RCA Columbia Pictures Home Video on November 10, 1983, and on Canal de las Estrellas in Mexico on January 30, 1988.

This film essentially picks up after &quot;The Fantastic Adventures of Unico&quot; with the West Wind dropping Unico off in a new location where the gods will be unable to locate him. The story begins with the West Wind erasing Unico&#x27;s memory of the past events and he is left to once again fend for himself. Unico runs into a Heathcliff-like cat named Melvin Magnificat who is the apparent boss of the forest which Unico has stumbled upon. Later, Unico meets a kind-hearted young girl named Cheri (also spelled &quot;Cherry&quot;, voiced by Sumi Shimamoto). Cheri&#x27;s older brother, Toby (in Japanese, &quot;Torubi&quot;, voiced by Shuichi Ikeda), is working for the evil Lord Kuruku (in Japanese, &quot;Kukuruku&quot;), who plans to turn all living creatures, animals and people alike, into unusual zombie-like beings called &quot;Living Puppets&quot; to be his slaves. Toby&#x27;s job is to change people into Living Puppets and then lure the Living Puppets to Kuruku&#x27;s fortress on Nightmare Island off the East Coast of Sweden in exchange for learning more of Kuruku&#x27;s magic. His plan is to obey and serve until he learns enough to be the master, but fails to protect Cheri twice. Toby also takes on Melvin Magnificat (&quot;Yamaneko&quot; in Japanese) – who hates Unico because Unico &quot;intruded&quot; in &quot;his&quot; forest (the forest in which the West Wind left Unico) – as his assistant. After Cheri&#x27;s parents and neighbors all get turned into Living Puppets, she and Unico team up to stop Kuruku.

Seeking advice from the Trojan Horse, Unico and Cheri learn that Kuruku is a puppet who was mistreated by his owners and discarded. He washed up at the Ends of the Earth – where all unwanted &quot;junk&quot; ends up eventually – and was brought to life with the power of 200 years of sunlight exposure, determined to take revenge on the human race. With help from the Sphinx&#x27;s daughter (voiced by Noriko Tsukase; named &quot;Marusu&quot; in Japanese but not given a proper name in the English version), Unico – who realizes that Kuruku is really just a lonely, friendless creature – is able to break Kuruku&#x27;s spell, but since Kuruku&#x27;s hatred was the only thing that kept him alive, Kuruku dies, reverts to puppet form, and Cheri keeps him as a toy. Soon afterward, the West Wind finds Unico and spirits him away once again to avoid detection by the gods.

As with the first movie, the second movie&#x27;s ending song (&quot;Do-Re-Mi-Fa Lullaby&quot; performed by Emiko Shiratori) became an instrumental in the Spanish and English dub. Katsue Miwa in the original version and Barbara Goodson in the English dub reprised their roles as Unico in this film, while Verónica Castro played Unico in the Spanish dub.

==== &quot;Saving Our Fragile Earth: Unico Special&quot; ====
&quot;Saving Our Fragile Earth: Unico Special&quot; is a 2000 animated short starring Unico that was a Japanese–Chinese co-production. Unico is voiced by Aracely Arámbula in the Spanish dub, while Akiko Yajima voiced the character in the original Japanese version.

==== Home media ====
The 1981 and 1983 theatrical films were dubbed into English and received North American exposure through VHS releases in the mid-1980s and airings on the Disney Channel.

In 2012, Discotek Media released &quot;The Fantastic Adventures of Unico&quot; and &quot;Unico in the Island of Magic&quot; on DVD, with both the Japanese and English audio tracks. The 1979 &quot;Unico&quot; pilot film was featured as an English-subtitled extra on the &quot;Island of Magic&quot; DVD.

Discotek Media re-released &quot;The Fantastic Adventures of Unico&quot; and &quot;Unico in the Island of Magic&quot; on a double-feature DVD on April 29, 2014. The DVD did not contain the pilot. Discotek also released the Blu-ray versions of both films in 2014. Crunchyroll began streaming the films online in 2016, while RetroCrush began streaming them in 2020.

=== Other appearances ===
Unico made cameo appearances in several episodes of the &quot;Black Jack&quot; TV series adapted from the &quot;Black Jack&quot; manga.

Unico also made an appearance in the Game Boy Advance game &quot;Astro Boy: Omega Factor&quot;, where he gives Astro Boy the ability to have a warm and tender talk with Dr. Tenma, his father. Unico also appears in the &quot;Astro Boy&quot; manga in a comic book. In the story, he is Dr. Foola&#x27;s inspiration for a new robot: a mechanical unicorn.

Unico can also be seen in a brief cameo in &quot;Columns GB: Osamu Tezuka Characters&quot; for the Game Boy Color.

The &quot;Unico&quot; films (the pilot, &quot;Fantastic Adventures&quot;, and &quot;Island of Magic&quot;) were produced by Sanrio, so some of Sanrio&#x27;s characters, such as Hello Kitty, Tuxedo Sam, and the Little Twin Stars, make cameo appearances in the films.

Unico co-starred alongside Pinoko in the 2005 animated short &quot;Dr. Pinoko&#x27;s Forest Adventures&quot;. In the short, Unico was voiced by Rumiko Tezuka, Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s eldest sibling and daughter.

On February 18, 2021, Tezuka Productions and &quot;Kemono Friends&quot; collaborated to add Unico into the Japanese mobile game &quot;Kemono Friends 3&quot; as a special DLC character. The titular character was given a humanized design and was depicted as a female.

== Reception ==
Writing for Anime News Network, Shaenon K. Garrity called &quot;Unico&quot; &quot;a good-looking manga&quot;, saying the &quot;artwork looks like a comic-book version of the prettiest Disney movie never made&quot;.

<text>Junee Correctional Centre is a prison in Junee, Australia, operated by GEO Group Australia under a contract with the Government of New South Wales. The prison houses sentenced male inmates with a maximum, medium or minimum security classification, along with a small number of female remand inmates in transit to other locations. The centre has a capacity of 1200. 

The prison is made up of three sections: a medium-security facility for male inmates, a minimum-security facility for male inmates, and a new maximum-security facility for male inmates, due to open in 2020.

Junee opened in 1993 as the first privately operated prison in NSW.

==History==
During 1989, representatives of the New South Wales Department of Corrections, including the Minister for Corrective Services, Michael Yabsley, visited the United States to learn first-hand about private corrections management. They toured US state and federal managed corrections facilities as well as privately managed correction facilities. Once satisfied that substantial benefits could be gained from private contract management, coalition support was gained and laws were amended. Instructions went out to government agencies to develop a competitive process to bring private corrections management to New South Wales. It was also decided that to allow for maximum efficiencies in management, the government would also call for tenders for private design and construction of a new
prison.

Following a call to local government authorities for an expression of interest in a privately managed correctional facility being located within local government boundaries, Junee town leaders and the elected representatives strongly supported the concept, and the town was selected as the site for a new correctional centre. The ensuing years saw extensive community consultation by both Corrective Services NSW and NSW Public Works as the government went about selecting an appropriate building contractor and final operator. By 1991, the NSW Government executed a contract with Australasian Correctional Services (ACS) for design and construction, and another contract with the same company for the management of the centre. ACS in turn executed two contracts, one with Thiess Contractors for the design and construction of the facility and one with Australasian Correctional Management for the management of the centre.

The centre, completed in 1993 at a cost of A$53m, was expected upon opening to have a 30 per cent cost saving compared to traditional government prison operations. A special focus of this facility was the establishment of a private industry program to provide employment, valuable skills training and wages to inmates. Two other correctional centres built by the NSW Government at that time, but with each half capacity, were budgeted to cost A$57m each.

New South Wales was the second state in Australia, after Queensland, to introduce private prisons. Junee was the first prison in Australia to be designed, constructed and managed by the private sector under a single contractual arrangement. The prison is managed by the GEO Group Australia, which was granted a new contract in 2001. Following the October 2009 privatisation of Parklea Correctional Centre, Junee is one of two privately operated correctional centres in New South Wales, both operated by GEO Group Australia.

<doc id="1217565" wikidata="Q4545521" url="?curid=1217565" title="0-8-8-0">
<text>In the Whyte notation for classifying the wheel arrangement of steam locomotives, an 0-8-8-0 is a locomotive with two sets of eight driving wheels and neither leading wheels nor trailing wheels. Two sets of driving wheels would give far too long a wheelbase to be mounted in a fixed locomotive frame, so all 0-8-8-0s have been articulated locomotives of the Mallet type, whether simple or compound. In the UIC classification, this arrangement would be, refined to Mallet locomotives, (D)D. The type was sometimes called Angus in North America.

Other equivalent classifications are:
UIC classification: DD (also known as German classification and Italian classification)
French classification: 040+040
Turkish classification: 44+44
Swiss classification: 4/4+4/4

The lack of leading and trailing wheels to assist the tracking and stability of the locomotive means that the 0-8-8-0 type is not suited to high speeds. The vast majority were used as very heavy switcher locomotives (generally for hump yard work), transfer switchers for hauling cuts of cars between rail yards, or pusher engines for assistance on grades.

Most locomotives of this arrangement were built and served in North America, but there were exceptions. The Bavarian State Railways (K.Bay.St.B) built a total of 25 0-8-8-0T tank locomotives of class Gt 2×4/4 between 1913 and 1923, classified after unification of Germany&#x27;s railway systems as class 96. These worked trains over heavily graded stretches of line, mostly as bankers (US: pushers) and were the largest locomotives in Europe when introduced.

O gauge models of PRR Class CC2 0-8-8-0s were made by Lionel 

HO scale brass importers of the L-1 Camelback locomotives include NJ Custom Brass and Overland Models. 

The Bavarian locomotives have been modelled in HO gauge by Marklin/Trix and by Rivarossi.

<text>Strasbourg Cathedral or the Cathedral of Our Lady of Strasbourg (, or &quot;Cathédrale de Strasbourg&quot;, ), also known as Strasbourg [[Minster (church)|Minster]] (), is a Catholic cathedral in Strasbourg, Alsace, France. Although considerable parts of it are still in Romanesque architecture, it is widely considered to be among the finest examples of Rayonnant Gothic architecture. Architect Erwin von Steinbach is credited for major contributions from 1277 to his death in 1318, and beyond through his son Johannes von Steinbach, and his grandson Gerlach von Steinbach, who succeeded him as chief architects. The Steinbachs&#x27; plans for the completion of the cathedral were not followed through by the chief architects who took over after them, and instead of the originally envisioned two spires, a single, octagonal tower with an elongated, octagonal crowning was built on the northern side of the west facade by master Ulrich Ensingen and his successor, Johannes Hültz. The construction of the cathedral, which had started in the year 1015 and had been relaunched in 1190, was finished in 1439.

Standing in the centre of the Place de la Cathédrale, at , Strasbourg Cathedral was the world&#x27;s tallest building from 1647 to 1874 (227 years), when it was surpassed by St. Nikolai&#x27;s Church, Hamburg. Today it is the sixth-tallest church in the world and the tallest extant structure built entirely in the Middle Ages.

Described by Victor Hugo as a &quot;gigantic and delicate marvel&quot;, and by Goethe as a &quot;sublimely towering, wide-spreading tree of God&quot;, the cathedral is visible far across the plains of Alsace and can be seen from as far off as the Vosges Mountains or the Black Forest on the other side of the Rhine. The reddish-brown sandstone from the Vosges mountains gives the cathedral its distinctive colour.

The construction, and later maintenance, of the cathedral is supervised by the &quot;Fondation de l&#x27;Œuvre Notre-Dame&quot; (&quot;Foundation of Our Lady&quot;) since at least 1224. The Musée de l&#x27;Œuvre Notre-Dame, a municipal museum located in the Foundation&#x27;s buildings, displays original works of art from the cathedral, such as sculptures and stained-glass, but also the surviving original medieval buildings plans.

In 1988, the Strasbourg Cathedral was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List along with the historic centre of the city (called the &quot;Grande Île&quot;) because of its outstanding Gothic architecture.

==History==
The history of Strasbourg&#x27;s cathedral is well documented thanks to the archives of the Notre-Dame Foundation, the city of Strasbourg, and of the diocese. Archaeological excavations below and around the cathedral have been conducted in 1896–1897, 1907, 1923–1924, 1947–1948, between 1966 and 1972, and finally between 2012 and 2014.

===Previous buildings on the site===

A Roman settlement called Argentoratum, twenty hectares in size, existed on the site since about 12 B.C., at a strategic point where bridges crossed the Rhine and two of its tributaries. It became a major trading center for wine, grain, and later for textiles and luxury products. Christianity was first imposed in 313 by the Edict of Constantine. The first recorded bishop, Amand, participated in the Councils of Cologne and Sardique in 346 and 347. A paleochristian church or cathedral is believed to have been founded by an edict of Clovis I, but its exact location and appearance is unknown.

The first cathedral built on the present site was erected by the bishop Saint Arbogast in about 550–575. Under Charlemagne, the Bishop Remi consecrated the altar and built a funeral crypt in about 778. This Carolingian church is believed to have had an apse flanked by two chapels and a nave covered with a wooden beamed roof, but no trace remains today.

===The Romanesque Cathedral===

In 1002, following the death of the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, a battle broke out between his potential successors. When Bishop Werner I supported the winning candidate, Henry II of Germany, one of his Henry&#x27;s rivals, Hermann of Germany, raided Strasbourg and burned down the cathedral. The Bishop appealed to the new Emperor, who granted one eighth of his revenues in the province toward the construction of a new Cathedral. In 1015, bishop Werner laid the first stone of a new cathedral on the foundations of the Carolingian church.

The new church was exceptionally large, just ten meters shorter than the present cathedral, and just ten meters narrower on its west front. The west front was also exceptional because it was flanked by two towers, the &quot;harmonic&quot; style which became common in Gothic cathedrals during the following century. The chevet, or east end, probably also had a tower, and was flanked by two chapels. The transept of the cathedral was 55 meters long, the same length as the nave and choir. The nave and choir were composed of three vessels, each with two traverses. The central vessel was higher than the two collaterals. 

The new building, with its wooden roof beams, was unfortunately prone to fire; it suffered from fires in 1136, 1140,1150, and 1176. The church was repaired after each fire, and reconstructions and modifications made, but it retained its essentially Romanesque form, with thick walls, small windows and massive columns. Work on the church was frequently interrupted by wars and political crises.

=== The Romanesque-Gothic Cathedral ===
Bishop Heinrich I von Hasenburg (1181 – March 25, 1190) decided to construct a new cathedral, to be more beautiful than that of Basel Munster, which was just being finished. Construction of the new cathedral began on the foundations of the preceding structures. The original Romanesque crypt was kept and expanded westwards. The architects of the rebuilding began to include Gothic elements, following the style that had appeared in northern France in the 12th century, while still preserving the existing Romanesque features. Between 1200 and 1228, the Romanesque vaults of the north transept were replaced by the pointed Gothic rib vault, which were stronger and shifted the thrust of the weight outwards, reducing the need for massive pillars in the interior. This was then carried out in the south transept. The next major step toward Gothic took place with the raising of the vaults of the south transept, creating thinner walls and more space for high windows. The Gothic style also appeared in the statuary, particularly the Pillar of the Angels, and in the tympanums over the double portals on the south transept, which showed the influence of the sculpture in French Gothic cathedrals. 

The next major step was the reconstruction of the nave into the Gothic style, which took place between 1240 and 1274. Thanks to the installation of rib vaults, the nave was raised in height to 27 meters, and the upper walls were filled with stained glass windows. The first traverses were made in what was known as the Lorraine style, with two levels of quadripartite windows, traversed by a narrow passageway. However, between 1250 and 1255 they decided to become more ambitious, and used what was called the &quot;Parisian style&quot;; this created three levels with a total height of 32 meters from the floor to the vaults. The Gothic pillars of the new section were copied exactly from those of the Basilica of Saint Denis.

=== Rayonant additions (1277–1439) ===

The next major project was the rebuilding of the west front, or facade, in the Gothic style. The first stone was placed on May 25, 1277, by Bishop Conrad of Lichtenberg. The new plan was inspired in part by French cathedrals, particularly the Basilica of Saint-Urbain of Troyes. The design called for a west front taller and wider than the nave behind it. By the use of buttresses and a double wall, the outer wall decorative with wide spaces, and the inner wall bearing the weight and having large windows, the interior of the cathedral could have more light. At the same time, the planned two spires on either side of the facade would reach an extraordinary height of 122 meters. Erwin von Steinbach&#x27;s son Johannes von Steinbach served as &quot;magister operis&quot;, or &quot;Werkmeister&quot; (chief architect) from (at least) 1332 until his death in 1341. From 1341 until 1372 (or according to other sources: 1339–1371), the post of chief architect was held by a Master Gerlach (not to be confused with Erwin&#x27;s other son, Gerlach von Steinbach, architect of the Niederhaslach Church), who has been identified as Erwin&#x27;s grandson Johannes Gerlach von Steinbach. He completed the installation of the rose window, and above it twelve statues of the apostles. In 1372 the work was taken over by a master Conrad, also known as Kuntze, about whom little is known, until 1382. He was followed by a Michael von Freiburg (also known as Michael von Gmünd, or Michael Parler, from the Parler family of architects), recorded as &quot;magister operis&quot; in 1383–1387, who was then succeeded by Claus von Lohre (1388−1399). The three men completed the bell tower over the central part of the façade, in a design that moved away from Gerlach von Steinbach&#x27;s initial idea of a central tower and whose precise authorship is unknown.

The octagonal north tower was the combined work of architects Ulrich Ensingen (shaft) and Johannes Hültz of Cologne (top). Ensingen worked on the cathedral from 1399 to 1419, taking over from Claus von Lohre, and Hültz from 1419 to 1439, completing the building at last. The building of the second tower was often discussed, and was seriously proposed when Alsace became part of Germany after the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, but was coldly received by the population of Strasbourg, who considered it would be a symbol of German occupation.

The north tower was the world&#x27;s tallest building from 1647 (when the taller spire of St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Stralsund burnt down) until 1874 (when the tower of St. Nikolai&#x27;s Church in Hamburg was completed). The planned south tower was never built and as a result, with its characteristic asymmetrical form, the cathedral is now the premier landmark of Alsace. One can see 30 kilometers from the observation level, which provides a view of the Rhine banks from the Vosges all the way to the Black Forest.

In 1505, architect Jakob von Landshut and sculptor Hans von Aachen finished rebuilding the Saint-Lawrence portal (Portail Saint-Laurent) outside the northern transept in a markedly post-Gothic, early-Renaissance style. As with the other portals of the cathedral, most of the statues now to be seen &quot;in situ&quot; are copies, the originals having been moved to the Musée de l&#x27;Œuvre Notre-Dame.

Like the city of Strasbourg, the cathedral connects German and French cultural influences, while the eastern structures, e.g. the choir and south portal, still have very Romanesque features, with more emphasis placed on walls than on windows.

The tower is one of the first to rely substantially on craftsmanship, with the final appearance being one with a high degree of linearity captured in stone. While previous façades were certainly drawn prior to construction, Strasbourg has one of the earliest façades whose construction is inconceivable without prior drawing. Strasbourg and Cologne Cathedral together represent some of the earliest uses of architectural drawing. The work of Professor Robert O. Bork of the University of Iowa suggests that the design of the Strasbourg façade, while seeming almost random in its complexity, can be constructed using a series of rotated octagons.

===Later history===
In the late Middle Ages, the city of Strasbourg had managed to liberate itself from the domination of the bishop and to rise to the status of Free Imperial City. The outgoing 15th century was marked by the sermons of Johann Geiler von Kaisersberg and by the emerging Protestant Reformation, represented in Strasbourg by figures such as John Calvin, Martin Bucer and Jacob Sturm von Sturmeck. In 1524, the city council assigned the cathedral to the Protestant faith, while the building suffered some damage from iconoclastic assaults.

After the annexation of the city by Louis XIV of France, on 30 September 1681, and a mass celebrated in the cathedral on 23 October 1681 in presence of the King and prince-bishop Franz Egon of Fürstenberg, the cathedral was returned to the Catholics and its inside redesigned according to the Catholic liturgy of the Counter-Reformation. In 1682, the choir screen (built in 1252) was broken out to expand the choir towards the nave. Remains of the choir screen are displayed in the Musée de l&#x27;Œuvre Notre-Dame and in The Cloisters. The main or high altar, a major work of early Renaissance sculpture, was also demolished that year. Fragments can be seen in the Musée de l&#x27;Œuvre Notre-Dame.

A round, Baroque sacristy of modest proportions was added north-east of the northern transept in 1744 by the city&#x27;s chief architect Joseph Massol according to plans by Robert de Cotte and between 1772 and 1778 architect Jean-Laurent Goetz surrounded the cathedral by a gallery in early Gothic Revival style in order to reorganise the merchants&#x27; shops that used to settle around the building (and would do so until 1843).

=== The French Revolution and 19th century ===

Following the outbreak of the French Revolution, on 2 November 1789, all church property was seized by the French state and was soon vandalised by the most ardent revolutionaries, the Enragés. The Director of public works of Strasbourg, Gérold, quickly took down and protected the statues of the portal, but 215 statues of the voussures over the portals were smashed with hammers, as were the angels atop the gables on the facade, and the crowns and sceptres of the statues of the kings. The sculpture over the central tympanum and over the south portal of the transept was saved because it was covered with wooden planks with the revolutionary motto &quot;Liberté-Égalité-Fraternité&quot;,

In April 1794, the Enragés started planning to tear the spire down, on the grounds that it hurt the principle of equality. The tower was saved, however, when in May of the same year citizens of Strasbourg crowned it with a giant tin Phrygian cap of the kind the Enragés themselves wore. This artifact was later kept in the historical collections of the city until they were all destroyed during the Siege of Strasbourg in a massive fire in August 1870.

Seven church bells were removed and melted down to made into cannon, and gold and other precious objects in the interior confiscated and taken away, and in November 1793 the cathedral was formally proclaimed a &quot;Temple of Reason&quot;.

The cathedral was not returned to church control until July 15, 1801, along with confiscated property that had not been destroyed. The sculpture of the portals was returned to its place or restored between 1811 and 1827. However, the official ownership of the structure was given, and belongs today, to the French state, and it is administered by the Mayor of Strasbourg.

A series of major reconstructions and restorations were carried out in the second of the century from 1837 to 1888. This included rebuilding the crypt and the addition of new stained-glass windows. The choir was given its multicolour painted decoration, by Édouard Steinlé and Charles Auguste Steinheil, finished in 1879. Construction of the Neo-Romanessque dome over the transept was begun, and new bronze doors were installed in 1879. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, the city was under siege. The roof was set afire and the cross at the top of the spire was bent by a German artillery shell. After the French defeat, Alsace was ceded to the new German Empire until 1918. Following the war, Klotz took German nationality so he could continue his work. He reconstructed the dome over the transept in a grander, Romanesque Revival style.

=== 20th-21st century ===

In 1903, the architect Johann Knauth discovered cracks on the first pillar of the northern side of the nave. In 1905 he began taking measures to consolidate and strengthen the north side of the west facade, which supports the spire. After trying several temporary measures, in 1915, during the First World War, he launched a large-scale project to replace the entire foundation of the cathedral with concrete. This project was completed in 1926, after the end of the war. In 1918 Alsace and Strasbourg were once again attached to France.
During World War II, the cathedral was seen as a symbol for both warring parties. Adolf Hitler, who visited it on 28 June 1940, intended to transform the church into a &quot;national sanctuary of the German people&quot;, or into a monument to the Unknown German Soldier. On 1 March 1941, General Leclerc made the &quot;Oath of Kufra&quot; (&quot;serment de Koufra&quot;), stating he would &quot;rest the weapons only when our beautiful colours fly again on Strasbourg&#x27;s cathedral&quot;. During the war, the stained glass was removed in 74 [storage] cases. and stored in a salt mine near Heilbronn, Germany. After the war, it was returned to the cathedral by the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives section of the United States military.

The cathedral was hit by British and American bombs during air raids on the centre of Strasbourg on 11 August 1944, which also heavily damaged the Palais Rohan and the Sainte-Madeleine Church. In 1956, the Council of Europe donated the famous choir window by Max Ingrand, the &quot;Strasbourg Madonna&quot; (see also ). Repairs to war damage were completed only in the early 1990s.

In October 1988, when the city celebrated its 2,000th anniversary (as the first official mention of Argentoratum dates from 12 BC), pope John Paul II visited and celebrated mass in the cathedral. The bishopric of Strasbourg had been elevated to the rank of archbishopric a few months before, in June 1988.

In 2000, an Al-Qaeda plot to bomb the adjacent Christmas market was prevented by French and German police.

The restoration of the tower was completed in 2006, and in 2014 a new campaign of restoration begun on the south transept.

== Exterior ==
=== The West Front ===

The west front or façade, the main entrance of the cathedral, is a relatively late addition, constructed between 1275 and 1399. The façade is supported and divided vertically by four narrow buttresses, each decorated with sculpture. It rises in three levels; the portals on the ground level; the level of the rose window above them, and the top level, with a balustrade. The rose window, with a rayonnant Gothic design, is fourteen metres in diameter and was finished in 1345. The pointed gable over the central portal, decorated with a sculpture of the Virgin Mary and child, reaches up into the space in front of the rose window. A gallery of statues of the Apostles, each in his own arch, is placed above the rose window.

The west front takes its distinctive appearance and sense of verticality from the dense network of lacelike pointed gables, pinnacles and tall, slender columns that cover it. The columns are purely decorative, and are so thin they are compared to the strings of a harp. The visual effect of the façade is enhanced by its unusual darkish red stone.

=== West Portals ===

The cathedral has three portals, corresponding to the three vessels of the nave. Each has a particular theme of decoration; the left portal is dedicated to the infancy of Christ, the central portal to redemption, and the right portal to the Last Judgement. The portals are set forward from the front of the church by the network of slender columns, spires and arches which form an outer decorative wall. The sculpture largely dates to the late 13th century and is similar in theme and style to that of the sculpture of Reims Cathedral made between 1250 and 1260, though the Strasbourg sculpture shows greater realism.

The arched tympanum over the doors of the central portal is crowded with sculpture, as are the voussures, the stone arches around the door. The central figures depict the entry of Christ into Jerusalem, and the Crucifixion and Passion of Christ, all with exceptional expression and detail.

The portal of the infancy of Christ (left) depicts angels, bishops and saints in the voussures, and figures representing the virtues, carrying spears, prod the figures representing the vices. In the portal of the Last Judgement, (right) Christ sits on his throne sorting the virtuous from the wicked. The wicked attempt, without success, to seduce the noble Virgins, but succeed with the foolish virgins.

Unlike the sculpture of earlier cathedrals, the Strasbourg statues clearly show emotions; the prophets look severe, the Virgins appear serene, the Virtues look noble, and the frivolous Virgins appear foolish. The statues in the portals are all standing upon realistically carved capitals decorated with the signs of the zodiac.

=== Portal of Saint Lawrence (North transept) ===

The portal of Saint Lawrence, was added to the north transept between 1495 and 1505 by Jacob von (or Jacques de) Landshut, with sculptures by Hans von Aachen (aka Johan von Ach, or Jean d&#x27;Aix-la-Chapelle) and Conrad Sifer. The original statues were replaced by copies in the 20th century and are today kept in the Musée de l&#x27;Œuvre Notre-Dame. The tympanum was destroyed in the French Revolution and replaced by a work by the sculptor (1765–1833). It presents a virtual theater of late Gothic flamboyant architecture and decoration, including three interlocking arches over the doors, containing a statue of the Saint during his martyrdom. The supporting buttresses on either side also have very expressive sculpture representing the Virgin Mary and the three Magi on one side, and a group of Saints on the other, both sheltered beneath lacelike flamboyant sculpture and pinnacles. A balustrade crosses the face of the transept, and above is a wall of two bays filled with stained glass.

=== Portal of the Virgin (South transept) ===

The south portal, or Portal of the Virgin, dates to about the 1220s, the same time as the Pillar of the Angels and the Astronomic clock in the interior. Decrees of the Emperor rendering justice were traditionally read out in front of this doorway. The rounded arches of tympanum over the doorway contain sculpture of the Virgin Mary dying, surrounded by the Twelve Apostles and being crowned by Christ. The original statue-columns of the Apostles from the 1220s which supported the tympanum were smashed in 1793 during the French Revolution.

The mid-level of the transept over the portal, built in about 1230, has lancet windows and a statue of Virgin, flanked by Saint Peter and Saint Lawrence. Above this is a colourful clock with the signs of the zodiac. Above this is a flamboyant Gothic balustrade with an original sundial from about 1493, and above that are two small rose windows from the same period. Following their destruction during the French Revolution, several of the sculptures have been replaced in the 19th century by works by Philippe Grass, Jean-Étienne Malade, and Jean Vallastre.

As with all the other portals, several of the statues have been replaced by copies &quot;in situ&quot; and are today displayed in the Musée de l&#x27;Œuvre Notre-Dame. This is also true for Ecclesia and Synagoga, arguably the most famous statues of the cathedral, if not of Strasbourg.

=== Octagon bell tower and spire ===

The cathedral was originally intended to have two towers on the west front, but only the north one was built. The octagon tower was begun in 1399 by Ulrich Ensingen (chief architect until 1419), and crowned with a spire by his successor Johannes Hültz. The work was completed in 1439.

The eight-sided tower is three times higher than wide, more elongated than other Gothic towers of the 14th century. It is surrounded and supported by four more slender towers containing circular stairways. The walls of the tower have tall lancet openings, which show the bells and bring light into the interior, and are decorated on the exterior with interlocking pointed gables. Between the lower tower and spire there is a balustrade, almost hidden by pinnacles and other architectural decoration.

The spire above the tower is composed of eight stages of elaborate octagonal structure, linked together by interlaced arches and pinnacles, which contain a stairway to the lantern at the top. Originally the lantern was topped by a statue of the Virgin Mary, the patron saint of the cathedral, but in 1488 it was replaced by a fleuron, or flower-shaped ornament. This is crowned by the cross, which is surrounded by four smaller crosses and images of the host and chalice, elements of the liturgy of the Eucharist.

=== Crossing dome and chevet ===

The crossing dome is placed over the meeting point of the transept and the choir, and, like the bell tower, has eight sides. It was constructed beginning in about 1330, following the rebuilding of the transept. Its base is topped by a gallery with pointed arches, beneath a level with large arched bays, two on each side, side, divided by clusters of columns. Above this are blind arcades, an ornate cornice, and then a pointed roof with a pair of dormer or skylight windows, a small window above a large one, on each side, which brought light to the choir below. The medieval crossing dome&#x27;s aspect was altered several times over the centuries. The currently visible, much higher crossing dome was designed in grand Romanesque Revival style by the architect Gustave Klotz, after the original dome had been heavily damaged by Prussian shelling during the Siege of Strasbourg. Klotz&#x27;s dome was in turn heavily damaged by bombing raids during World War II, and restored between 1988 and 1992.

The chevet, at the northeast end of the cathedral, close to the transept, has vestiges that go back to the Romanesque cathedral, particularly at the lower levels. It looks over the former cloister of the canons of the cathedral. It is the least decorated side of the cathedral. A large arched bay occupies the central portion, just below a balustrade. Above that are three narrow windows and then a triangular gable with a small circular oculus window and blind arches. The face is flanked by two cylindrical towers with narrow lancet windows and pointed roofs. The walls are pierced with narrow slits, like a medieval fortress, giving it a very military appearance.

Two chapels, devoted to Saint Andrew and Saint John the Baptist, were attached to the two sides of the apse. The Chapel of John the Baptist preserves its thick Romanesque walls and two Romanesque windows.

== Interior ==
=== Narthex ===

The narthex is the portion of the cathedral just inside the west front, beneath the tower. It is separated from the nave by two massive pillars, 8.5 by 5 meters, which support the tower above. The primary decorative element is the rose window, added between 1320 and 1340, and substantially restored since. Rays of yellow glass radiate outwards like a sun, surrounded mosaic-like pieces of green and blue and by small oculi with red floral designs. The tracery and decoration of the interior are very much like of that exterior, with blind galleries and delicate parallel vertical lines, like the strings of a harp. A pointed arch frames the window, and a row of blind arches at the lower level completes the decoration.

The reverse of the central doors of the portal has a column statue of Saint Peter holding the keys of the kingdom and above it a blind rose, without glass, a miniature version of the large rose window above it.

=== Stained glass of narthex ===

The lower bay on the south has stained glass windows that depict the Last Judgement, while the north bay windows illustrate twelve episodes from the Book of Genesis, including the creation of Adam and Eve, the original sin, the expulsion from Paradise, and Noah&#x27;s ark. These windows date to about 1345.

=== Nave ===
The nave is the section of the cathedral between the narthex and the choir where ordinary parishioners are seated and worship. At Strasbourg it is long and wide, not counting the two collateral aisles, which are each wide. In height to the vaults it is . It takes its reddish-brown color from the sandstone of the Vosges mountains.

The nave is dominated by the two rows of massive pillars. Each pillar bundles sixteen smaller columns, of which five reach upward to support the vaults overhead. The meeting points between the columns and the vault ribs is decorated with vegetal sculpture. The elevation has the traditional High Gothic or Rayonnant Gothic three levels; large arcades below, with windows on the collateral aisles; a narrow triforium, or gallery, also with windows, for passing along the walls; and above that, of equal height with the arcades the upper windows which reach up into the vaults. The upper windows at Strasbourg fill the entire space between the triforium and the vaults. An additional element of decoration is given by the small sculpted, painted, and gilded heads on the keystones of the vaults, where the ribs meet.

=== Nave stained glass - The Emperor Windows ===

The five lower bays on the north side contain some of the oldest stained glass of the cathedral, installed in the old Romanesque cathedral in about 1180. When the nave was rebuilt in Gothic style in the 13th century, the old windows were reinstalled in random locations. In 1877, architect Gustave Klotz reconstituted the windows in their original arrangement. The windows are devoted to nine Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire. Each holds a sceptre in his right hand and an orb in the left hand, symbols of their responsibility as both sovereigns and religious figures. Some of the windows were assembled with glass from different periods: in the windows devoted to the Emperors Frederick II and Henry II of Bamberg, the heads were made between 1250 and 1275, but in 1522 were remounted onto the bodies of other kings from earlier windows made in about 1180. The small circular windows above the Emperors depict scenes from the life of Christ.

The complete Emperor windows are:

* First Emperor Window: HENRICUS REX (presumably Henry the Fowler), FRIDERICUS REX (Frederick I), HENRICUS BABINBERGENSIS (Henry II of Bamberg); 
* Second Emperor Window: OTTO REX (Otto I), OTTO II REX (Otto II), OTTO III REX (Otto III), CONRADUS II REX (Conrad II), the latter depicted together with an imperial prince who may be Henry III; 
* Third Emperor Window: REX PHILIPPUS (Philip of Swabia), HENRICUS REX (possibly Henry II), REX HENRICUS CLAUDUS (Henry the lame = also possibly Henry II), FRIDERICUS SUBMERSUS (Frederick I); 
* Fourth Emperor Window: KAROLUS MARTEL PATER BIPPINI (Charles Martel), KAROLUS MAGNUS REX (Charlemagne), REX BIPPINUS KAROLI (Pepin the Short), LUDEVICUS REX FILIUS KAROLI (Louis the Pious); 
* Fifth Emperor Window: LOTHARIUS ROMANORUM IMPERATOR (Lothair I), LUDEWICUS FILIUS LOTHARII VIII (identification unclear, may be Louis II of Italy), LUDEWICUS FILIUS LOTHARI VI (identification unclear), KAROLUS REX IUNIOR (identified with Charles of Provence).

The upper windows of the nave depict eighty-four saints, added by various artists between 1250 and 1275.

On the south side of the nave, the upper walls have windows depicting female saints, including local saints from Alsace or Strasbourg. They wear diadems and have flowers in their hair, and carry twigs of the tree of life, or fruit. On the south side, the upper windows depict soldiers, popes, bishops, and other masculine figures. 

The windows of the triforium, between the upper and lower window, contain 19th-century reconstitutions of early windows depicting the ancestors of Christ, but little of the original glass remains.

=== Pulpit ===

The pulpit, attached to the fourth pillar of the north side of the nave, was sculpted in 1485 following a design by Hans Hammer. It is reached by a stairway with a curling sculpted design called &quot;butterfly wings&quot;. The pulpit itself, in the form of a very ornate corbeille or basket, is entirely covered with colonettes, gables, pinnacles, and niches filled with sculpture, including images of Christ on the cross, a crowned Virgin Mary, Apostles, the Crucifixion, and well as Kings and doctors of the Church. A statue on the west side of the pillar represents a famed preacher contemporary with the cathedral; Johann Geiler von Kaysersberg (d. 1510); a small sculpture along the railing of the stairs depicts Geiler&#x27;s dog, mourning his master on steps of the pulpit where he once preached.

=== The grand organ ===

The grand organ, located high on the wall of the north side of the nave, is recorded as existing in 1260. It was rebuilt 1298, in 1324–1327, in 1384, 1430, and 1489 and finally in 1716 by André Silbermann. It was hoisted up to its present position in 1327. The ornate and colourful decoration of pinnacle, spires, and sculpture Sculpture also hangs beneath the organ, including a moving figure of Samson opening the jaws of a lion. Other moving figures include a trumpet player carrying a banner and a pretzel vendor being offered flour, water, and salt by the caryatides on the console.

The Silbermann organ had three keyboards, thirty-nine &quot;jeux&quot;, or effects and two thousand, two hundred forty-two pipes. It was electrified after 1807, and was restored and modified several times, most recently in 1934–35 and in 1975–81, giving it the current forty-seven &quot;jeux.&quot;

The current organists of Strasbourg Cathedral are Pascal Reber, Damien Simon, Guillaume Nussbaum, Arthur Skoric and Benoît Clavier.

In addition to the grand organ in nave, the cathedral has two smaller organs: 
* Choir pipe organ, north side of the choir, Joseph Merklin, 1878
* Crypt pipe organ, 1998

=== North Transept ===

The transept and the apse were built atop the Romanesque crypt, making them a little higher than the nave; they are reached by a short stairway, giving the impression that the choir and apse are the stage of a theater. The crossing of the transept and the choir is topped by the central cupola or dome, which is supported by four gigantic pillars, each wrapped in eight columns, which reach up to support the vaults under the cupola. The cupola itself rests upon four squinches, a base made of rounded arches, which make the connection between the Gothic and Romanesque elements. The columns are lavishly decorated with sculpted foliage. 

Formerly the floor of the crossing was filled with tombs of notable religious figures, but they were moved in later reconstructions. Only the names remain carved on the walls. There are two altars fixed to west pillars of the crossing, both from the 16th century; one devoted to Saint Pancras of Rome and the other to Saint Maurice. The crossing is filled with statues and busts of saints set into niches as well as bas-reliefs of the Nativity and the Adoration of the Magi. Other scenes are painted onto the reverse of the bas-reliefs.

The first overhead vault before the cupola features a 19th-century painting of the Last Judgement by Charles Auguste Steinheil, a collaborator of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc and other notable cathedral-restorers. It is in a Neo-Byzantine style, with Christ in a red frame in the center. The other vaults in the crossing were also intended to be painted, but funding was insufficient.

The Romanesque north transept has four traverses, which were the first in the cathedral to receive Gothic rib vaults. The vaults are supported by a circular pillar with modest decorative stone rings. The two lower lancet windows were put together in the 19th century out of glass from different centuries. They feature a Tree of Jesse (The Genealogy of Christ) and the judgement of Solomon (right window) and the Virgin Mary with John the Baptist and John the Evangelist) as well as King Solomon, the Queen of Sheba and King David on the left. The two rose windows above are later, from the 14th century, with vegetal designs. On the east wall, the windows depict Christ in Majesty, Saint Lawrence, a Virgin and Child, and John the Baptist. The capitals of the columns are decorated with dragons and other mythical creatures. 

The north transept also contains the two baptismal fonts, one circular and one octagonal, in their own architectural settings, They were made by Jost Dotzinger in 1453. The octagonal vault is covered with arches and lacelike interlaced sculpture in the late Gothic Flamboyant style.

The north transept connects with the Chapel of Saint John, entered through a pointed Gothic arch containing a rounded Romanesque arch. The central art work of the North Transept is a large statue of Christ on the cross, over a sculptural landscape depicting the Mount of Olives, crowded with carved figures in dramatic poses. It was originally made in 1498 by Nicolas Roder for the cemetery of Saint-Thomas, and was based on engravings by Martin Schongauer and Albrecht Dürer.

===South Transept===
In the south transept, the lancet and oculus windows in the two large bays on the east, built in 1220–1227, are modelled after those in the lower choir of Chartres Cathedral. A pointed arch, a tribune for singers, and a balustrade were added in the 15th century. A sculpture of a head, wearing the hat of an architect or magistrate, gazes from the balustrade at the pillar of angels. Under the balustrade is a large painting on wood illustrating the Nativity, in a sweeping landscape. It also dates from the 15th century.

The South Transept contains the Pillar of Angels, a massive supporting pillar for the ceiling. It is composed of an octagonal pillar surrounded by four engaged columns, which reach upwards to support the vaults, and four slender colonettes. It is decorated with four vertical groups of statue-columns, depicting scenes from Christ and the Last Judgement, as well as four angels carrying the instruments of the Passion, and above that, four more angels sounding trumpets. At the lower level are statues of the four Evangelists. The pillar was created in the middle of the 13th century, most probably by a group of sculptors from France or Burgundy. Other parts of the vaults are upheld by Atlantes, supports in the form of human figures.

The rose windows of the west transept facade were made between 1230 and 1235, Above the rose are smaller round oculi from the same period, depicting Biblical symbols; the Alpha and Omega, the Candelabra of the Ancient Alliance, and others which combine floral and geometric designs.

=== Astronomical clock ===

The astronomical clock, located in the south transept, is one of the most famous features of the cathedral. The first astronomical clock was installed in the cathedral from 1352–54 until 1500. It was called the Dreikönigsuhr (&quot;three-king clock&quot;), and was located at the opposite wall from where today&#x27;s clock is. At noon, a group of three mechanical kings would prostrate themselves before the infant Jesus, while the chimes of the clock sounded the hour. 

In 1547 a new clock was begun by Christian Herlin and others, but the construction was interrupted when the cathedral was handed over to the Roman Catholic Church. Construction was resumed in 1571 by Conrad Dasypodius and the Habrecht brothers, and this clock was given a more ambitious program of mechanical figures. It was decorated with paintings by the Swiss painter Tobias Stimmer. This clock functioned until 1788, and can be seen today in the Strasbourg Museum of Decorative Arts. The present clock was built by Jean-Baptiste Schwilgué between 1837 and 1842.

All the parts of the clock together are high. The clock shows much more than the official time; it also indicates solar time, the day of the week (each represented by a god of mythology), the month, the year, the sign of the zodiac, the phase of the moon and the position of several planets. The lower part of the massive base of the clock has statues of Apollo and the Goddess Diana presenting a circular calendar of the liturgical year, whose revolving face with a globe points to the dates of major religious festivals and events. This part of the clock is surrounded by painted figures representing the ancient empires – Greece, Assyria, Persia, and Rome.

The level above displays a group of mechanical chariots, with allegorical figures representing the days of the week, which move daily to bring to the front the current day of the week. Figures of two reclining women hold a cadran (clock face) between them which tells the minutes.

Above this level is a celestial globe in a sky of painted stars which makes a complete revolution every 23 hours, fifty-six minutes and four seconds. As it turns, it shows the 1,022 stars identified by Ptolemy, as viewed above the horizon of Strasbourg.

The central tower is composed of three levels. On the bottom, figures of the Four Seasons surround a mechanical astrolabe, which indicates the location of the planets according to Copernicus, and is surrounded by the signs of the zodiac. Above this is a globe, with painted figures of the Church and the Antichrist confronting each other. This mechanism displays the phases of the moon. Above this are two levels of animated mechanical figures, above that a figure of Christ and the four Evangelists, under a dome formed by crossed arches.

Animated characters launch into movement at different hours of the day. One angel sounds the bell while a second turns over an hourglass. Different characters, representing the ages of life (from a child to an old man) parade in front of Death. On the last level are the Apostles, passing in front of Christ. All these automata are put into operation daily at 12:30 pm except Sundays.

=== Apse ===

The apse of the cathedral, the hemispherical vault behind the altar on the northeast end, features Romanesque and Gothic architecture overlaid with 19th-century Neo-Romanesque decoration, The paintings on the half-dome and walls were made by Édouard Steinlé in 1877–79, in the style of a Byzantine mosaic. The painted figures on the wall represent fathers of the church and founders of religious orders, depicted in Byzantine style.

In 2004 the apse and choir received some of its historic furnishings; fifteen choir stalls made by Claude Burdy and Claude Bergerat in 1692, as well as a group of busts of the apostles originally placed there in the 18th century.

The stained glass window in the axis of the apse depicts the Virgin of Alscace. The window was a gift to the Cathedral in 1956 from the Council of Europe, which has headquarters in Strasbourg. It replaces the original window which was one of the few windows not put into safe storage before World War II; it was destroyed by Allied bombing in 1944.

The main altar, in the form of a tomb, is a recreation of an earlier altar in the rocaille or late baroque style, which had been damaged in a fire in 1759 and then ruined during the French Revolution. The altar was recreated in 1809 by the architect Pierre-Valentin Boudhors, who discovered the old central medallion of the original altar and combined it with white and black marble panels. The sculptor Jacques Zimmer added the heads of cherubs made of bronze.

=== The Chapel of Saint Catherine ===
The chapel of St. Catherine is located in the southwest end of the cathedral, between the gift shop and the astrological clock. Enter through a gate across from the chapel of Saint John the Baptist. It was constructed between 1830 and 1839 by Bishop Berthold the II. Within the chapel are many furnishings, including a sculpture of The Mother Mary cradling Christ, a contemporary stained glass window: the stained glass window of a hundred faces. The two vertical windows in the chapel of Sainte Catherine measure almost 9 m high by visual artist Véronique Ellena and master glassmaker Pierre-Alain Parot. Perhaps most curious to an unfamiliar visitor is the toe bone of Saint Alphonse-Marie Eppinger encased in a wooden and red velvet box, which was placed in the chapel upon her beatification in 2016.

=== Chapel of Saint John the Baptist ===

The Chapel of Saint John the Baptist is located just to the left of the apse, at the northeast end of the cathedral. It is one of the oldest parts of the cathedral, constructed in about 1170 and then rebuilt in Gothic style in 1230, with the same height as the adjoining nave. The sacristy occupies the upper level over the chapel. The chapel contains the tomb of Bishop Conrad de Lichtenberg, made between 1310 and 1320, and now framed by flamboyant tripe arch. It also contains the tomb of Conrad de Bussnang, a prominent member of the chapter, whose image is portrayed in sculpture praying before the Virgin and child. It dates to the end of the 15th century. A door opens from the chapel to an adjoining cloister behind the cathedral.

=== Chapel of Saint Andrew ===

The Chapel of Saint Andrew is on the southeast side, to the right of the apse. It is also a very early part of the cathedral, built shortly after 1150, with nine crossings and three naves of slightly different sizes, covered by Romanesque groin vaults. The chapel is devoted to memorials to six canons who were entombed there between 1478 and 1681. The central decoration is sculptural work dedicated to the Virgin Mary donated by the de Barby brothers in 1521. A Romanesque portal opens to the cloister outside.

=== Crypt ===

The cathedral has two Romanesque crypts, the oldest parts of the cathedral. The more recent one is under the transept, from about 1150, and the older one, under the apse, was built in about 1110 to 1120. They are covered with Romanesque groin vaults, formed by the intersection of rounded barrel vaults, and supported by massive cruciform pillars and cylindrical columns with palm leaf decoration on their capitals. Some of the capitals also have sculpted monsters and lions on the corners. The larger crypt has three naves, of equal size, divided by slender columns. There are three stairways down to the crypt, the oldest, from the apse, dates to about 1150. The pilasters between the stairways are older, from 1015. Further modifications were made to the crypts in the 12th century.

== Bells ==
In 1519 Strasbourg Cathedral commissioned Jerg von Speyer to create what was said to be the largest bell in Europe; 2.74 meters in diameter and weighing twenty tons. This enormous bell was installed but cracked shortly afterwards. Its place as the bourdon, or largest and deepest-sounding bell, was taken by an older bell, the &quot;Totenglock&quot;, or &quot;Death bell&quot;, which was traditionally used for mourning. It weighs 7.5 tons and 2.2 meters in diameter, and was cast in 1447 by Hans Gremp. It is still in place.

During the French Revolution nine bells were taken out and melted down to make cannon, but the &quot;Totonglock&quot; and a second bell, the &quot;Zehrnerglock&quot; (1.58 meters, 2.225 tons), made in Mathieu Edel in 1786, were preserved to ring the hours and serve as alarm bells for the city. More recently, a group of six modern bells was cast in Heidelberg between 1974 and 1976; they range from 1.7 meters to 0.9 meters in diameter, and from 3.9 to 5.7 tons in weight. Other 
two bells are from 1987 and 2006.

The four bells in the octagon tower are rung on the hour. These include an old bell made by Jean Rosier and Cesar Bonbon (1691). Another two old bells by Mathieu Edel (1787) ring on the quarter hours. An even older bell, by Jean Jacques-Miller (1595), repeats the sounding of the hours one minute later.

Under the roof of the Klotz tower are the six bells that ring the weekly masses but also the baptisms, marriages and deaths of parishioners. 

== Tapestries ==
The cathedral has a group of fourteen tapestries depicting the life of the Virgin Mary. They were commissioned by Cardinal Richelieu for the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris, and were made to accompany a painting there, &quot;The Vow of Louis XIII&quot;. They were manufactured between 1638 and 1657 in Paris by Pierre Damour. They were purchased by the Chapter of Strasbourg Cathedral in 1739, and were an example of the importation of the French style of that period into Alsace. They are traditionally hung in the arcades of the nave during Advent.

== Cathedral Art in Strasbourg Museums ==
The Musée de l&#x27;Œuvre Notre-Dame, or Museum of the Work of Notre-Dame, is located in a medieval and Renaissance building not far from the cathedral, and displays a collection of some of the most delicate original works of sculpture and art from Cathedral, moved there to protect them from environmental damage. These include some of the original statues from the portals and façade dating from the 13th century, including the statues of &quot;The Church&quot; and &quot;The Synagogue&quot; from the portal of the south transept. The statue of the &quot;Synagogue&quot; is blindfolded, since Jews did not recognise the divinity of Christ. It also preserves the earliest plans of the cathedral, as well as paintings and tapestries and other objects.

Other objects and works from the cathedral, including the mechanism of the original astronomical clock, are found in the Musée des arts décoratifs de Strasbourg.

==Furnishing==
Protestant and Revolutionary iconoclasm, the war periods of 1681, 1870 and 1940–1944, as well as changes in taste and liturgy, have taken a toll on some of Strasbourg Cathedral&#x27;s most outstanding features such as the choir screen of 1252 and the successive high altars (ca. 1500 and 1682), but many treasures remain inside the building; others, or fragments of them, being displayed in the Musée de l&#x27;Œuvre Notre-Dame.

Lower school average class sizes are 16-18 and middle and upper school average class sizes are 13–14. The student: teacher ratio is 7:1 and students of color in all grades make up approximately 33 percent of the student body.

For the 2017–18 academic year, tuition and fees total $49,980 for all grades. Its sister schools are the all-girls Brearley School, the all-girls Chapin School and the all-boys Collegiate School, all in New York City. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked Spence ninth on its &quot;America&#x27;s Best Prep Schools&quot; list in 2010.

==History==
The Spence School was founded in 1892 by Clara B. Spence, who was its head for 31 years. The school&#x27;s motto is (Latin for &#x27;Not for school, but for life we learn&#x27;). The first building was located on New York City&#x27;s West 48th Street. The school once had a boarding option, but all current girls are day students.

Clara B. Spence described her school as: &quot;A place not of mechanical instruction, but a school of character where the common requisites for all have been human feeling, a sense of humor and the spirit of intellectual and moral adventure.&quot;

Spence read from Shakespeare in dramatic declamation every week. She was known for her conservative comportment and strictness, but also her devotion to women&#x27;s rights. She arranged for Edith Wharton, Helen Keller, and George Washington Carver to speak at the school. Isadora Duncan taught dance classes.

In a commencement address from an unknown year, Spence said that cultivating imagination was an important skill, since “sympathy, that great bond between human beings, is largely dependent on imagination—that is, upon the power of realizing the feelings and the circumstances of others so as to enable us to feel with and for them.”

The school has been located on East 91st Street since 1929. In 1999, the school purchased the William Goadby Loew House at 53 E 93rd Street for use as it&#x27;s Lower School building. In 2008, Spence acquired the adjoining Wanamaker-Munn townhouse on 90th street for use as it&#x27;s Upper School facilities.

==Academics==
Spence offers a liberal arts and science curriculum, including programs in the arts and foreign languages. In a &quot;Worth&quot; magazine study, out of the 31,700 private and public high schools in the United States, Spence ranked the sixth most successful school in the country in placing its graduates in Harvard, Yale and Princeton.

<text>Club Santos Laguna S.A. de C.V., simply known as Santos Laguna or Santos, is a Mexican professional football club based in Torreón, Mexico. The club competes in Liga MX, the top division of Mexican football.
Founded in 1983 as Club Santos IMSS Laguna by the Mexican Social Security Institute of the state of Durango, and the following year it changed to its current name.

Santos Laguna reached Mexico&#x27;s top division after buying Ángeles de Puebla. The club debuted in first division in the 1988–89 season. Domestically, Santos Laguna has won 6 Liga MX championships, as well as 1 Copa MX and 1 Campeón de Campeones cup. It has also reached the finals of the CONCACAF Champions League twice, finishing runners-up on both occasions.

Santos is the third football club formed in the Comarca Laguerna region, after the unsuccessful Laguna and Torreón. In 2018, the club celebrated its 35th anniversary with a change in their logo. In a February 17, 2013 poll, by Consulta Mitofsky, it was the fifth-most-popular team in Mexico.

==History==
===Formation and early years===
Santos Laguna was founded in 1983 by the IMSS of the state of Durango. Since the late 1970s, the IMSS had sponsored a national football tournament with teams from across the country. Jose Diaz Couder, IMSS head of social services in Gómez Palacio, was invited to participate in the tournaments despite the fact that he did not have a team. He appealed to the players he knew to form a team, based on Asturias F.C.

In 1987 Tuberos de Veracruz, part of the Segunda División de México, was purchased by IMSS and moved to Santa Cruz, Tlaxcala. The first Santos Laguna team spent less than a year in Tlaxcala before moving to Gómez Palacio. A lack of facilities spurred efforts to obtain Moctezuma Stadium (Estadio Corona) in Torreon, owned by John Abusaid, and the Saints made their first home in the former Estadio Corona. On September 4, 1988 Los Guerreros played their first game as Santos Laguna, winning 2–0.

====Segunda Division A====
When the IMSS sold its professional sports clubs, Salvador Necochea Sagi bought Santos Laguna. In their first year in the Second Division A, the Warriors avoided relegation with three wins, two draws and one loss. William (the Clash) Galindo, Carlos González, Julio Cesar Armendáriz, Tomas Moreno and Fernando de la Rosa were notable players.

In 1989 Los Guerreros earned their nickname when, after a poor start, they finished 10th. Their fan base grew, and the club&#x27;s owners bought the first Estadio Corona. The club underwent changes the following year, replacing its logo with the current one and playing in green and white stripes. Of the 18 founding members of the Second Division B, two won promotion to the first division: the Autonomous University of Tamaulipas and Santos Laguna.

===Promotion to Primera Division===

In 1988 Santos Laguna purchased the Puebla Angels, giving them Christian Saavedra, Wilson Graniolatti, Martin Zuniga and Miguel Herrera and a record of three wins, four draws and one loss. Lucas Ochoa scored the club&#x27;s first First Division goal and the Warriors, led by Carlos Ortiz, avoided relegation with Herrera&#x27;s two goals paving the way for a 3–1 defeat of Atletico in Potosino.

In 1991, Grupo Modelo became majority owner of the club and Ramon Ramirez made his First Division debut with a goal against Club Deportivo Guadalajara. Late the following year, club president Armando Navarro Gascón and his wife were killed in an automobile accident.

President Alberto Canedo and Chilean coach Pedro García arrived in 1993. Grupo Modelo made a strong investment in reinforcements, Antonio &quot;El Turco&quot; Apud, Daniel Guzmán, Olaf Heredia, Diego Silva, Héctor Adomaitis and Richard Zambrano who joined players coming from Second Division such as José Guadalupe Rubio and Pedro Muñoz. The 1993–94 season saw the team for the first time qualify for the playoffs in the First Division and managed to reach the final coinciding with their tenth anniversary of founding, though lost in overtime in the second leg of the final against Club Deportivo Estudiantes Tecos who were coached by Victor Manuel Vucetich.

In 1994, key player Ramón Ramírez left for Guadalajara but Santos qualified for the playoffs a second time. Los Guerreros participated in the 1995 CONCACAF Champions Cup, and were eliminated in the first round by Deportivo FAS of El Salvador. Argentine Mauro Camoranesi played 13 games with Santos, scoring one goal before returning to Uruguay. Other notable players that season and the following one were Gabriel Caballero, Francisco Gabriel de Anda and Miguel España.

Chilean Cristian Montecinos reached the third league during the 1996 regular season, and Santos Laguna won their first First División title with new player Jared Borghetti. In the Verano 1997 tournament, Santos Laguna was eliminated by Guadalajara 5–0 in the Estadio Jalisco. Santos Laguna played poorly in the Invierno 1997 tournament, winning three games out of 17 and tied for last in the standings with Pumas UNAM and UAG Tecos. In 1998 the club reached one of the two qualifying finals for the Copa Libertadores, which was played on September 9 in Los Angeles.

===2000s===

In the summer 2000 season, Santos Laguna was strengthened by the arrivals of Rodrigo Ruiz and Luis Romero. During the regular season, the Warriors lost only two games and finished second in the overall standings behind Toluca.

In the 2001 summer season, the club won their second league championship. During the winter 2001 season Santos Laguna, with eight losses, failed to qualify for the playoffs and finished eighth overall. In summer 2002, the Warriors were fourth in the overall standings but were eliminated 1–0 in the semi-finals by Necaxa at the Estadio Corona. Santos Laguna qualified for the CONCACAF Champions Cup that year for the second time. The Warriors defeated Tauro FC of Panama by aggregate score of 5–3; in the next round, at home, Santos Laguna lost 3–2 overall to the U.S. champion Kansas City Wizards. At the end of the summer tournament, Fernando Quirarte and his coaching staff stepped down; Quirarte was replaced by Sergio Bueno, who was soon sacked in favor of Luis Fernando Tena. Finishing eighth overall, Santos Laguna defeated defending champion and leader Global America 5–4 at Azteca Stadium. The Warriors qualified for the group stage of the Merconorte Cup, defeating the Kansas City Wizards and Barcelona of Guayaquil twice each and Sporting Cristal once; their only loss was to Sporting Cristal, 2–1.

For the 2003 Apertura tournament (the club&#x27;s 20th anniversary) reinforcements arrived in the form of Vicente Matias Vuoso and Sixto Peralta, Argentines who had played for Manchester City and Inter Milan. In the match at Estadio Corona against Monterrey, 10 goals were scored. The Warriors qualified for the playoffs, but were eliminated in the quarter-finals, Luis Fernando Tena&#x27;s contract was not renewed, and he was replaced by Eduardo De la Torre.

The Warriors began 2004 well, qualifying for the Copa Libertadores by defeating Atlas Guadalajara 4–3, but were injured, inconsistent and tired in the Clausura. The club, put up for sale, was in a precarious financial position but played two tournaments and finished 14th overall. In the Copa Libertadores, despite unpaid wages, Santos Laguna ended the group stage undefeated. In the second round, the Warriors were eliminated by River Plate after a struggle.

During Apertura 2004 the club was abandoned by the Ministry of Finance, who withdrew financial support and returned it to former owner Grupo Modelo with instructions not to invest more money in the franchise until current owner Carlos Ahumada Kurtz solved his legal problems. The club payroll was restructured, players were cut and Santos Laguna did not qualify for the playoffs.

In the 2005 Clausura, the Warriors&#x27; Vicente Matias Vuoso won the scoring championship with 15 points and Rodrigo Ruiz set a Mexican record for scoring passes with 12 assists. Santos Laguna was plagued by injuries during the Apertura tournament. The Clausura 2006 tournament was disastrous for the club.

The Apertura 2007 was one of the team&#x27;s best seasons. With the arrival of the Ecuadorian Christian Benitez, Santos Laguna lost only one match and was visited by Pele.
For the Clausura 2008, the club scored 36 goals in the regular season. On June 1, 2008 Santos Laguna won their third Clausura championship, defeating Cruz Azul. The club began Apertura 2008 at Azteca Stadium against America.

Clausura 2009 was disastrous for the Warriors; coach Daniel Guzman was dismissed and replaced by Sergio Bueno, and the club&#x27;s fortunes improved somewhat. In the CONCACAF Champions League quarter-finals against the Montreal Impact in Montreal&#x27;s Olympic Stadium before a crowd of 55,571, the Impact surprised and won 2–0. Apertura 2009 opened the Nuevo Estadio Corona; Bueno was dismissed and replaced by Ruben Omar Romano.

===2010s===
In 2010 Santos fell just short of the title, losing 4–3 to Toluca. For the Apertura Christian Benitez returned to the club, contributing to their rise to the top of the table and scoring 14 goals. The Saints lost 3–0 to Monterrey, their second consecutive final loss.
In the Clausura Ruben Omar Romano, unpopular with fans, was dismissed on February 20, 2011. Two days later, Diego Cocca debuted as coach in a 2–0 loss to Cruz Azul. Cocca lost his first six games before a 3–0 Week 12 victory over Cruz Azul, and the team did not qualify for the playoffs.

Cocca began Apertura 2011 with the support of the board and players, but was dismissed on September 3 and Eduardo Rergis became the interim coach. On September 12 Benjamin Galindo was appointed as new coach, with Hector Lopez his assistant. Under Galindo, Santos won five consecutive games and reached fourth place.

In the 2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League, Santos defeated the Seattle Sounders FC in the quarter-finals and Toronto FC in the semi-finals. In the final, the club lost to Rayados of Monterrey. In the 2012 Clausura, Santos Laguna finished in first place for the second time in its history. In the quarter-finals, the club won 6–4 on aggregate. The first game of the semi-finals, against the UANL Tigres at the Estadio Universitario, ended in a 1–1 draw and Santos won the second game to advance to the final. After playing Monterrey to a 1–1 draw at Estadio Tecnologico, Santos Laguna won the second game 2–1 with goals by Daniel Ludueña and Oribe Peralta for the club&#x27;s fourth title.

The Apertura 2012 featured Edgar Gerardo Lugo and rising defensive stars Monarcas Morelia and Oswaldo Alanis. However, Santos did not qualify for the playoffs and was unable to repeat its championship. At the end of the season, Benjamín Galindo sacked his two assistants before he himself was dismissed.

In the Clausura 2013, Portuguese manager Pedro Caixinha was hired based on a recommendation by former Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho. Daniel Ludueña and Christian Suarez were transferred to the Pachuca Soccer Club in exchange for Mauro Cejas, Nestor Calderon and promising Colombian Andres Renteria. Santos Laguna finished sixth during the regular season. They defeated Atlas 3–1 on aggregate in the quarter-finals and lost to Cruz Azul 0–3 and 2–1 in the semi-finals. In the 2012–13 CONCACAF Champions League, Santos again reached the final against Club de Fútbol Monterrey. The first game was a scoreless tie, and Monterrey won the second game 4–2.

For the Apertura 2013, Santos sold Ivan Estrada to Pachuca and transferred Herculez Gomez, Gerardo Lugo and Aaron Galindo. After the June purchase of Grupo Modelo by Belgian-Brazilian company AB InBev, on August 8 Grupo Modelo announced the sale of Santos Laguna to new company Orlegi Sports (led by Alejandro Irarragorri and other Mexican businessmen). The new owners said that they would continue their sponsorship.

After defeating Atlante 3–1 in the latter half of the Apertura 2013, Santos Laguna secured a berth in the Copa Libertadores for the second time in their history. &quot;Los Guerreros&quot; finished undefeated at the top of Group 8, which included Copa Argentina winners Arsenal de Sarandí, Uruguayan league champions Peñarol and Venezuelan league runners-up Deportivo Anzoátegui. In the away leg of the Round of 16, Santos Laguna faced Argentinian side Lanús, which they lost 2-1. Darwin Quintero scored the only goal for &quot;Los Laguneros&quot;. &quot;Los Guerreros&quot; sealed their elimination by losing 2-0 in the home leg after Ismael Blanco and Paolo Goltz scored for the Argentinian side. Following the two clashes in the tournament, several Lanús players were transferred to Santos Laguna in the latter months of the year, namely defender Carlos Izquierdoz, midfielder Diego &quot;Pulpo&quot; González and goalkeeper Agustín Marchesín.

In the Clausura 2015, Santos rebounded from a six-match losing streak to qualify for the playoffs. The club defeated top-ranked Tigres UANL 2–1 on aggregate to reach the semi-finals. They faced another favorite, Chivas del Guadalajara, whom they defeated 3–0 on aggregate. In the finals they faced Gallos Blancos del Querétaro in their first Liga MX final. Santos defeated Querétaro in the first leg of the finals at Territorio Santos Modelo with a record-breaking score of 5–0; Javier &quot;Chuletita&quot; Orozco scored four of the goals. In the second leg, at Corregidora Stadium, Gallos won 3–0 but Santos won their fifth championship 5–3 on aggregate.

In the Clausura 2018 tournament, under the management of former goalkeeper Robert Dante Siboldi, Santos Laguna earned twenty-nine points, tied with América and Monterrey, but placed fourth due to goal difference. In the playoffs, the team faced defending champions Tigres UANL and lost 2-0 in the first leg of the quarterfinals. In the second leg, Santos Laguna played with ten players for most of the match as Jonathan Rodriguez was sent off in the 28th minute but managed to win 2-0 and advance to the semi-finals. At this stage, &quot;Los Guerreros&quot; defeated América 6-3 on aggregate and qualified for the finals against league leader Toluca. In the final first leg, played in Estadio Corona, both Djaniny Tavares and Julio Furch netted for Santos Laguna, helping the team defeat Toluca 2-1. In the second leg, Furch scored in the 10th minute but Toluca&#x27;s Gabriel Hauche levelled in the final minutes of the match, which finished 1-1. Santos Laguna earned its sixth league title, whilst Djaniny Tavares finished the tournament as the top goal scorer, netting fourteen times, the eighth time a Santos Laguna player has achieved this feat.

The team qualified for the sixth time for the CONCACAF Champions League, in the 2019 edition. In the Round of 16, &quot;Los Guerreros&quot; achieved an 11-2 win on aggregate against Honduran side Marathón. In the following stage, Santos Laguna defeated the New York Red Bulls in both legs, by 2-0 and 4-2 respectively. In the semi-finals, however, the team lost 5-3 on aggregate against Tigres UANL and failed to advance to the finals.

==Sponsors==
Santos Laguna has always worn green, with white or black accessories. Their uniform originated after the acquisition of Angeles de Puebla and their sponsorship by the Mexican Social Security Institute during the 1983–84 season.

The first home uniform was white with green sleeves and a green vertical stripe, green shorts and socks; the away uniform was white, in tribute to Club Torreon. In 1986, they adopted a home uniform of green-and-white horizontal stripes, green shorts and white socks and a white-and-green away uniform. In 2000, Santos Laguna signed a sponsorship agreement with Soriana.
===Kit===


==Grounds==
===Corona Stadium===

Corona Stadium, in Torreón, Coahuila, was one of the smallest football stadiums in Mexico with a capacity of 20,100. Known as Montezuma Stadium, it opened on July 2, 1970, for a friendly match between the now-defunct CF Torreón and Guadalajara. The stadium was demolished on November 2, 2009.

===New Corona Stadium===
Santos Laguna plays at the $100 million Estadio Corona, with a capacity of 30,050. Construction began on February 22, 2008, and on November 11, 2009, the stadium opened for a friendly match between Santos Laguna and Santos FC from the Brazilian Série A. The sellout crowd included Mexican president Felipe Calderón and Brazilian legend Pelé. Santos Laguna won, 2–1.

==Symbols==

===Insignia===
Santos Laguna&#x27;s home colors are green and white. When Santos Laguna was founded in 1983, its crest was white with green stripes and letters (similar to that of Santos FC). In 1991, when Grupo Modelo bought the club, the crest became similar to the current one. In 1996, a star was added to the badge after winning their first title in the Invierno 1996 tournament. After winning their second title in 2001, another star was added and switched to a darker shade of green with a black outline. As of 2012, the stars have been placed outside of the badge. In 2018, the club used a special badge, incorporating the number &#x27;35&#x27; for the club&#x27;s 35th anniversary. A sixth star was added after winning the Clausura 2018 tournament.

===Songs===
In 1991, when the club was in danger of relegation to the second division, Santos adopted their first team song: &quot;Es hora de ganar&quot;, by Ricardo Serna. In April 1994, Serna wrote &quot;Santos Campeon&quot;. Two years later, Chilean composer Martin Ibarreche Wilt Labarca was commissioned to write &quot;Verdiblanco el corazon&quot;. In 1997 Serna wrote &quot;Hymn to the Fans&quot;, and in May 2001 the club introduced &quot;Venceremos&quot;. Yahir of &quot;La Academia&quot; sang a song celebrating the club&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

==Partnerships==

On December 9, 2010, Santos formed a partnership with Scottish champions Celtic. Like Celtic, Santos wear a green-and-white hooped kit and the clubs regularly mention each other on Twitter and Facebook. On January 10, 2013, Santos formed a partnership with Atlético Nacional.

==Rivalries==
Santos has a regional rivalry with state neighbors Monterrey, with whom they played finals in the First Division of Mexico and two finals in the CONCACAF Champions League. To a lesser extent Santos also has a rivalry with Tigres UANL.

<doc id="1217591" wikidata="Q183288" url="?curid=1217591" title="National Olympic Committee">
<text>A National Olympic Committee (NOC) is a national constituent of the worldwide Olympic movement. Subject to the controls of the International Olympic Committee, NOCs are responsible for organizing their people&#x27;s participation in the Olympic Games. They may nominate cities within their respective areas as candidates for future Olympic Games. NOCs also promote the development of athletes and the training of coaches and officials at a national level within their geographies.

== National Olympic Committees ==
As of 2023, there are 206 National Olympic Committees. These include each of the 193 member states of the United Nations, one UN observer state (Palestine), two states without UN recognition (Kosovo and Taiwan) and one associated state of New Zealand (the Cook Islands).

There are also nine dependent territories with recognized NOCs: four territories of the United States (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands), three British Overseas Territories (Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, and the Cayman Islands), one constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Aruba) and one special administrative region of China (Hong Kong).

Prior to 1996, rules for recognizing dependent territories or constituent countries as separate countries within the IOC were not as strict as those within the United Nations, which allowed these territories to field teams separately from their sovereign state. Following an amendment to the Olympic Charter in 1996, NOC recognition can only be granted after recognition as an independent country by the international community. Since the rule does not apply retroactively, the dependent territories and constituent countries which were recognized before the rule change are allowed to continue sending separate teams to the Olympics, while the Faroe Islands and Macau send their own Paralympic teams.

The only state which thus qualifies to participate in the future is the Vatican City, a UN observer state. Niue, an associated state of New Zealand, could also be eligible as it conducts its own foreign relations and participates independently in UN specialized agencies and treaties, though this is unclear. Currently, all other remaining states are ineligible to join the IOC as they are not recognized by a majority of United Nations member countries. Constituent countries and dependent territories such as Curaçao, the Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Greenland, Macau, New Caledonia and French Polynesia can also no longer be recognized, so athletes from these territories can only participate in the Olympics as part of their parent nation&#x27;s national team. This rule also applies to territories experiencing a change in status – the Netherlands Antilles Olympic Committee was dissolved at the 123rd IOC session in July 2011 as the Netherlands Antilles ceased to exist in 2010.

For those countries and territories that are part of the Commonwealth of Nations, their National Olympic Committees usually also serve as the members of the Commonwealth Games Association, though not for the constituent countries of the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), nor for Canada or Australia, who maintain separate organisations for Commonwealth and Olympic sport. For the other Commonwealth members, their NOCs are responsible for organising and overseeing their national teams at the Commonwealth Games.

===Listed NOCs===
This section lists the current:

* 206 National Olympic Committees who are recognised by the International Olympic Committee, and so are the members of the Association of National Olympic Committees. 
* 7 National Olympic Committees who are recognised by their continental Olympic associations, but are not recognised by the International Olympic Committee (&quot;Italics&quot;).

The ANOC members are eligible to enter the Olympic Games. Some National Olympic Committees who are members of a continental Olympic association but not ANOC members compete in continental-level and subregional-level tournaments. These committees, however, are not allowed to participate in the Olympic Games.

The five continental Olympic associations are:

* Africa – &quot;Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa&quot; (ANOCA)
* America – &quot;Pan American Sports Organization&quot; (PASO)
* Asia – &quot;Olympic Council of Asia&quot; (OCA)
* Europe – &quot;European Olympic Committees&quot; (EOC)
* Oceania – &quot;Oceania National Olympic Committees&quot; (ONOC)

The IOC runs the Summer Olympic Games and the Winter Olympic Games as competitions in which all IOC-recognized NOCs can participate. Each continent also runs its own championships for their members:

* ANOCA – African Games
* PASO – Pan American Games and Pan American Winter Games
* OCA – Asian Games and Asian Winter Games
* EOC – European Games
* ONOC – Pacific Games

While not continental unions in themselves, the Union of Arab National Olympic Committees (UANOC) and International Committee of Mediterranean Games (CIJM) organize multi-sport events between Arabic-speaking countries and Mediterranean countries respectively. All 22 National Olympic Committees that form the UANOC and the 26 from CIJM are also members of either the ANOCA, EOC or OCA and are eligible to send their athletes to either the African, European or Asian Games. National Olympic Committees from the UANOC and CIJM are noted in the list below.

==== Africa (ANOCA) ====


==== Americas (Panam Sports) ====


==== Asia (OCA) ====


==== Europe (EOC) ====


==== Oceania (ONOC) ====


===Notes===
==Divisions==
The NOCs are all members of the &quot;Association of National Olympic Committees&quot; (ANOC), which is also split among five continental associations:

See the article for each continental association for the complete lists of all NOCs.

==Unrecognized National Olympic Committees==
The Faroe Islands and Macau both have recognized National Paralympic Committees and compete at the Paralympic Games. However, neither territory&#x27;s National Olympic Committee is recognized by the IOC, so they cannot participate in the Olympics. Macau remains recognized by the Olympic Council of Asia and takes part in the Asian Games.

Other existing countries/regions with unrecognized Olympic committees: Catalonia, Gibraltar, French Polynesia, Niue, New Caledonia, Curaçao, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Sint Maarten, the Northern Mariana Islands, Anguilla, Montserrat, Turks &amp; Caicos Islands, Transnistria, Kurdistan, Northern Cyprus, Somaliland, Abkhazia, and Native Americans.

It was reported in 2014 that South Ossetia intend to establish a National Olympic Committee.

<doc id="1217594" wikidata="Q7138599" url="?curid=1217594" title="Parklea Correctional Centre">
<text>Parklea Correctional Centre, a privately managed Australian maximum and minimum security prison for males, is located at Parklea, in the north-western suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales. The facility is operated by MTC Ventia and has a current capacity for 1,350 inmates. The Centre accepts prisoners charged and convicted under New South Wales and/or Commonwealth legislation and incorporates a minimum-security work-release centre for inmates nearing release with a capacity of 120. A Compulsory Drug Treatment Correctional unit is incorporated within the centre.

==History==
Following a recommendation of the Royal Commission into New South Wales Prisons (1976–1978), a prison was established at Parklea and initially designated as a maximum-security prison. The prison was scheduled to open in October 1983, but following a scandal involving Rex Jackson, the opening did not take place until September 1985, although the first inmates were received in November 1983. The Centre opened with about 220 maximum-security inmates with about the same number of prison officers.

=== 1st riot (1987) ===
On 13 December 1987, prisoners began a disturbance that was attributed to the consumption of &quot;gaol brew&quot; alcohol from fermenting fruit and sugar. During the riot, ten prison officers were injured, one officer was struck over the head with a typewriter, and several required transport to hospital. A subsequent review of procedures resulted in the withdrawal of oranges and sugar from all NSW correctional facilities.

=== 2nd riot (1990): down-grading to medium-security ===
A second riot occurred on 23 September 1990, following the introduction of a restrictive policy for prisoners private property by Minister Yabsley. The incident caused massive damage to the gaol and a number of other prison institutions across the state who rioted in protest against the policy. Lockdowns in the prison system occurred across the state, which led the Australian Human Rights Commission to describe the conditions in NSW as &quot;a very serious violation of human rights&quot;. A large number of prisoners remained locked in their cells for one month following the riots.

After the riots, the prison was reclassified from maximum-security to medium-security, and in 1992 was designated as a correctional prison for young offenders, after a campaign to create such a facility led by Children&#x27;s Magistrate Barbara Holborow. In 2001 Parklea was reclassified to maximum security, and inmate numbers were expanded as an additional 92 cells were completed.

=== Creation of Compulsory Drug Treatment Correctional Centre (CDTCC) (2006) ===
The Compulsory Drug Treatment Correctional Centre (CDTCC) was set up at Parklea adjacent to the Parklea Correctional Centre in 2006. The CDTCC is a stand-alone prison with a stable sentenced inmate population, where patients with repeat drug-related charges participate in comprehensive drug treatment and rehabilitation.

CDTCC can accommodate 70 inmates undergoing Stage 1 &amp; 2 of the Compulsory Drug Treatment Program, with a further 30 inmates undertaking Stage 3 which comprises detention in the community. Entry to the program is by way of an order issued by the Drug Court.

=== Privatisation (2008) ===
In the 2008 &#x27;mini-budget&#x27;, the New South Wales Government announced its plans to privatise two prisons, Parklea and Cessnock Correctional Centre. Protesting against the privatisation plans, prison officers commenced industrial action during May 2009. While the privatisation of Cessnock was eventually ruled out, on 30 September 2009 it was announced that GEO Group Australia had been awarded the contract to manage Parklea Correctional Centre, commencing on 1 November 2009.

==Current operations==
GEO Group Australia assumed responsibility for operations at 06:00 AM on 31 October 2009, the handover representing the first time an operational publicly managed prison in Australia had been transferred to private management. In response to parliamentary questions in November 2009, the NSW Minister for Corrections, John Robertson, described the transition as &#x27;hugely successful&#x27;. The transition involved GEO Group Australia seconding staff from its other prisons in NSW, Victoria, and Queensland. To ensure robust oversight of the transition process and that GEO complied with its obligations, Corrective Services NSW installed a team of senior staff on-site for the period of transition.

The financial impact of the privatisation of Parklea Correctional Centre was immediate with media reporting on 9 November that the correctional staff overtime budget across the NSW publicly managed prisons had reduced by A$70,000 a day.

In January 2011, Ron Woodham, the Commissioner for Corrective Services NSW, ordered that GEO Group Australia move all 73 inmates from Parklea Correctional Centre as part of a &quot;major security upgrade&quot; following the escape of three inmates from the minimum-security facility. Following the installation of new perimeter fencing and a review of the classification of all minimum-security inmates, the minimum-security facility was reopened.

==Notable prisoners==
The following individuals have served all or part of their sentence at the Parklea Correctional Centre:

<text>Gochujang or red chili paste is a savory, sweet, and spicy fermented condiment popular in Korean cooking. It is made from &quot;gochu-garu&quot; (red chili powder), glutinous rice, &quot;meju&quot; (fermented soybean) powder, &quot;yeotgireum&quot; (barley malt powder), and salt. The sweetness comes from the starch of cooked glutinous rice, cultured with saccharifying enzymes during the fermentation process. Traditionally, it would be naturally fermented over years in &quot;jangdok&quot; (earthenware) on an elevated stone platform called &quot;jangdokdae&quot; in the backyard.

== History ==
&quot;Shiyi xinjian&quot; (), a mid-9th century Chinese document, recorded the Korean pepper paste as (). The second-oldest documentation of pepper paste is found in the 1433 Korean book &quot;Collected Prescriptions of Native Korean Medicines&quot;. Pepper paste is again mentioned in a 1445 medical encyclopedia named &quot;Compendia of Medical Prescriptions&quot;. However, all these sources are from the time before the actual chilli peppers were introduced to Korea.

Chili peppers, which originated in the Americas, were introduced to East Asia by Portuguese traders in the early 16th century. There is mention of a type of chili pepper brought to Korea found in &quot;Collected Essays of Jibong&quot;, an encyclopedia published in 1614. &quot;Farm Management&quot;, a book from , discussed the cultivation methods of chili peppers.

The history of Sunchang gochujang&#x27;s becoming a regional specialty dates back to the 14th century at the start of the Joseon Dynasty era (1392–1910) when the founder Yi Seong-gye made gochujang from the Sunchang region a part of Korean palace cuisine.When Yi Seong-gye, who went on to become the founder and first king of Joseon as King Taejo, was on a trip to Manilsa Temple to pray to the mountain god, he is said to have eaten a bowl of barley &quot;bibimbab&quot; (spicy mixed rice with vegetables) with &quot;gochujang&quot; that he found unforgettably delicious. He loved it so much that he ordered it served to the royal family when he became king. Thus Sunchang &quot;gochujang&quot; gained fame as a regional specialty.In the 18th-century books, &quot;Somun saseol&quot; () and &quot;Revised and Augmented Farm Management&quot;, &quot;gochujang&quot; is written as , using hanja characters and . It is also mentioned that Sunchang County was renowned for its &quot;gochujang&quot; production. China and Japan, the countries with which Korea has historically shared the most culture and trade, do not include gochujang in their traditional cuisines.

=== Historical recipes ===
Gochujang ingredients reported in &quot;Jeungbo sallim gyeongje&quot; were of powdered and sieved &quot;meju&quot; (fermented soybeans), of chili powder, and of glutinous rice flour, as well as soup soy sauce for adjusting the consistency. The gochujang recipe in &quot;Gyuhap chongseo&quot;, an 1809 cookbook, uses powdered &quot;meju&quot; made from of soybeans and of glutinous rice, then adding of chili powder and &quot;bap&quot; made from of glutinous rice.

==Ingredients==

&quot;Gochujang&#x27;s&quot; primary ingredients are red chili powder (), glutinous rice powder, powdered fermented soybeans, and salt. Korean chili peppers, of the species &quot;Capsicum annuum&quot;, are spicy yet sweet, making them ideal for &quot;gochujang&quot; production. According to, gochujang is typically made from 25% red pepper powder, 22.2% glutinous rice, 5.5% meju powder (60% cooked soybeans and 40% non-glutinous rice), 12.8% salt, 5% malt, and 29% water.

Other recipes use glutinous rice (), normal short-grain rice (), or barley. Less common additions include whole wheat kernels, jujubes, pumpkin, and sweet potato. A small amount of sweetener, such as sugar, syrup, or honey, is also sometimes added. The finished product is a dark red paste, with a rich, piquant flavor.

The making of &quot;gochujang&quot; at home began tapering off when commercial production came into the mass market in the early 1970s. Now, most Koreans purchase &quot;gochujang&quot; at grocery stores or markets. It is still used extensively in Korean cooking to flavor stews (&quot;jjigae&quot;), such as in &quot;gochujang jjigae&quot;; to marinate meat, such as in &quot;gochujang bulgogi&quot;; and as a condiment for &quot;naengmyeon&quot; and &quot;bibimbap&quot;.

Gochujang is also used as a base for making other condiments, such as &quot;chogochujang&quot; () and &quot;ssamjang&quot; (). &quot;Chogochujang&quot; is a variant of gochujang made by adding vinegar and other seasonings, such as sugar and sesame seeds. It is usually used as a sauce for &quot;hoe&quot; and &quot;hoedeopbap&quot;. Similarly, &quot;ssamjang&quot; is a mixture of mainly gochujang and &quot;doenjang&quot;, with chopped onions and other spicy seasonings, and it is popular with &quot;sangchussam&quot; ().

== Gochujang hot-taste unit ==
Gochujang hot-taste unit (GHU) is a unit of measurement for the pungency (spicy heat) of gochujang, based on the gas chromatography and the high-performance liquid chromatography of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin concentrations.

Gochujang products are assigned to one of the five levels of spiciness: Mild, Slight Hot, Medium Hot, Very Hot, and Extreme Hot.
==Uses==
Gochujang is used in various dishes such as &quot;bibimbap&quot; and &quot;tteokbokki&quot;, and in salads, stews, soups, and marinated meat dishes. Gochujang may make dishes spicier (depending on the capsaicin in the base chili), but also can make them sweeter and smokier.

<text>4923 Clarke, provisional designation , is a stony background asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 2 March 1981, by American astronomer Schelte Bus at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. The spheroidal S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 3.14 hours. It was named after British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke. On the same night, Schelte Bus also discovered 5020 Asimov.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Clarke&quot; is a non-family asteroid from the main belt&#x27;s background population. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.7–2.6 AU once every 3 years and 2 months (1,147 days; semi-major axis of 2.14 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 7° with respect to the ecliptic.

The asteroid was first observed as at Crimea–Nauchnij in July 1972. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins at the Siding Spring Observatory two weeks prior to its official discovery observation on 12 February 1981.

== Physical characteristics ==

In the SMASS classification, &quot;Clarke&quot; is a common, stony S-type asteroid.

=== Rotation period ===

Three rotational lightcurves of &quot;Clarke&quot; have been obtained from photometric observations by the APT Observatory Group in Spain, by astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory in California, and by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec at Ondřejov Observatory (). Analysis of the best-rated lightcurve gave a rotation period of 3.143 hours with a consolidated brightness amplitude between 0.03 and 0.14 magnitude, which indicates that the body has a nearly spheroidal, non-elongated shape ().

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, &quot;Clarke&quot; measures between 3.367 and 3.532 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.3259 and 0.366. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes an albedo of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 4.10 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 14.3.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke (1917–2008), author of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. The official naming citation was prepared with assistance from Richard Binzel and published by the Minor Planet Center on 3 May 1996 (). The asteroid&#x27;s name independently suggested by Duncan Steel ().

In the postscript to his novel &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey&quot;, Clarke jokingly expresses disappointment that he did not receive asteroid 2001 as his namesake; instead, it was named for Albert Einstein.

<text>The Hellissandur longwave radio mast ( ) is a tall guyed radio mast formerly used for longwave radio transmissions of RÚV (The Icelandic National Broadcasting Service). It is situated at  , near Hellissandur on the Snæfellsnes peninsula of West Iceland. It is currently the tallest longwave radio mast in the world and the tallest above ground structure in Western Europe. 

It formed part of RÚV&#x27;s longwave service. It was intended to fill in gaps of the FM radio, serve seafarers and as a critical communications facility. It previously operated in parallel with the less powerful Eiðar longwave transmitter to form nationwide longwave coverage, but Eiðar was demolished in 2023.

The mast, which is among the tallest structures in Western Europe, is insulated against the ground, and guyed at five levels by steel ropes, which are subdivided by insulators. It was built in 1963 to replace the tall LORAN-C mast, constructed in 1959 for the North Atlantic LORAN-C chain (GRD 7970). A second, smaller, tall tower was installed by the US Coast Guard in the autumn of 1961 as part of a LORAN-A network paired with Greenland.

The LORAN-C scheme closed in 1994. In 1991, the original RÚV 1930 longwave transmitter tower at Vatnsendi (near Reykjavík) collapsed. As the Hellissandur mast was free for use, it was converted for use by RÚV (The Icelandic National Broadcasting Service) for its longwave transmissions on 189 kHz at a power of 300 kilowatts in the 1997.

In 2023 RÚV announced the retirement of all its longwave transmissions by 2024, citing its inadequacy as a backup service as most vehicles and radios do not support longwave broadcasts anymore. The Hellissandur transmitter went off the air on 5 September 2024 and on 17 October it was officially announced as closed.

<doc id="1217611" wikidata="Q2037996" url="?curid=1217611" title="Inverloch, Victoria">
<text>Inverloch is a town in Victoria, Australia. It is south east of Melbourne via the South Gippsland Highway on the Bass Highway in the Bass Coast Shire of Gippsland. Known originally for the calm waters of Anderson Inlet, it is now also known for the discovery of Australia&#x27;s first dinosaur bone.

The town had a population of 6,526 as of the 2021 census.

Inverloch is a popular tourist destination, particularly for swimming, kitesurfing and windsurfing at the calm waters of Anderson Inlet. Fishing and surfing are also popular.

The town is named after Loch Inver (Lake Entrance) in Scotland.

==History==

The Bunurong aboriginal people were custodians of this stretch of coast for thousands of years prior to settlement by Europeans.

The first European to settle in the Inverloch area was Samuel Anderson who, together with his brothers and Robert Massie, owned cattle and grew wheat in the area. The Post Office opened on 1 September 1883 as Anderson&#x27;s Inlet and was renamed Inverloch in 1889. The inlet on which the town is situated on is named Anderson Inlet after Samuel Anderson.

As the area developed, Inverloch became a port for the shipment of black coal from Wonthaggi to Melbourne.

Australia&#x27;s first discovered dinosaur bone, known as the Cape Paterson Claw, was discovered here in 1903 by William Ferguson in Cape Paterson in what is now Eagles Nest in the Bunurong Marine National Park.

==Population==
At the 2016 Census, there were 5,437 people in Inverloch. 79.6% of people were born in Australia, with the next most common country of birth was England at 4.6%. 89.1% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion at 39.5%, Catholic at 20.0% and Anglican at 14.9%.

==Today==

===Anderson Inlet===
Anderson Inlet is a shallow and dynamic estuary where the Tarwin River enters Bass Strait. It forms a 2,400 hectare almost-enclosed bay next to Inverloch, for which it provides a popular and protected beach. At low tide its intertidal mudflats provide important feeding habitat for migratory waders. It is named after the Anderson brothers, the first Europeans to settle in the area. Anderson Inlet is classified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area. It supports internationally significant numbers (over 6,000) of red-necked stint. It has also been known to support the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot, with six birds seen there in 1998 and two in 1999.
Seashell collecting is permitted from The Caves (beach) to the north-east, past the main shopping precinct. Seashell collecting is prohibited in the Bunurong Marine National Park, namely The Oaks, Twin Reefs, Shack Bay and Eagles Nest (beaches), heading south-west after Flat Rocks and The Caves.

===Shell Museum===
Inverloch has a Shell Museum which also has a dinosaur exhibition. It is located opposite the Rainbow Park. Australia&#x27;s first dinosaur bone, and many other dinosaur bones, were discovered in Inverloch.

===Coast===
Inverloch&#x27;s beaches include Twin Reefs, Shack Bay, Eagles Nest, The Caves, Flat Rocks, Main Surf Beach, two more surf beaches, Anderson Inlet-Western Beach, Anderson Inlet-Browns Beach, Anderson Inlet-Venus Street and Anderson Inlet-The Glades. Twin Reefs, Shack Bay and Eagles Nest make up most of the Bunurong Marine National Park (excluding The Oaks in Cape Paterson). The Caves and Flat Rocks are a part of the Bunurong Marine Park, which starts at Coal Point in Harmers Haven.
===Bunurong Marine Parks===

Bunurong Marine Park is a 17 km marine and coastal park along the coast of Harmers Haven, Cape Paterson and Inverloch, namely Coal Point to Wreck Creek.

Bunurong Marine National Park is an outstretching middle section of Bunurong Marine Park. The National Park part is about 21 km2 or about 5 km in length along the coast and stretching from 2.5 km east of Cape Paterson eastwards to a point 6 km south-west of Inverloch, extending seawards for 3 nm to the limit of Victorian waters. The restricted zone/state park (Bunurong Marine National Park inside Bunurong Marine Park), on foot begins after Undertow Bay heading towards Inverloch from Cape Paterson. It is an area past Safety Beach and rockpool and past Undertow Bay beach namely The Oaks, Twin Reefs, Shack Bay and Eagles Nest. It ends at Wreck Creek in Inverloch. It is prohibited to kill or take any matter (i.e., fishing, collecting seashells or kill or take any sea or land animal, living or dead) from the smaller of the two parks; Bunurong Marine National Park.

Both parks are named after the Bunurong Aboriginal people.

Bunurong Marine Park is considered special due to the unusual set of environmental conditions. It supports many marine animals including seastars, featherstars, crabs, snails, 87 species of fish, Whales and Seals. It has the highest recorded diversity of intertidal and subtidal invertebrates in eastern Victoria. The range of seaweed species is large.

Flat Rocks is a beach which has large rockpools for rockpooling/rambling and direct access from Cape Paterson-Inverloch Road. Bunurong Marine Park is seen and accessed at many different points along this coast, a popular one being near Cape Paterson caravan park on Surf Beach Road as it has a modified rockpool for swimming. The National Park is around to the left. Direct and more difficult access to the National Park is via car parks off Cape Paterson-Inverloch Road. Exploring, snorkelling and scuba diving are popular. There are boat launching facilities at Inverloch on Anderson Inlet.

===Eagles Nest===
Eagles Nest is a large rock structure adjacent to the coastline that resembles the top half of a map of Australia.

===Fishing===
Inverloch is very popular for surf and bay fishing. Anderson Inlet and Inverloch Surf Beach are popular for fishing and a good catch is usually found. Surf fishing usually produces fish such as Silver Trevally, King George Whiting, Flathead, Mullet and Juvenile Snapper (pinky). There are two boat launches on in Inverloch on Anderson Inlet.
==Climate==
Inverloch&#x27;s location on the north shore of Bass Strait gives it an oceanic climate, with the moderating effect of the ocean allowing a narrower temperature range throughout the year compared to other regions in Victoria. Average daily maximum temperatures range from 23.5 °C in summer to 13.5 in winter. Frost is rare, occurring on average 6 mornings a year. On 10 August 2005 Inverloch received its first snowfall since July 1951, with snow even settling briefly on the beach.

<text>USS &quot;Piranha&quot; (SS-389/AGSS-389), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the piranha. &quot;Piranha&quot; conducted six war patrols during World War II, receiving five battle stars. She was scrapped in 1970.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Piranha&quot; was laid down 21 June 1943 by Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine; launched 27 October 1943; sponsored by Mrs. William S. Farber; and commissioned 5 February 1944.

==World War II==
After East Coast training, &quot;Piranha&quot; departed Key West 3 April 1944 for the Panama Canal and her base, Pearl Harbor, arriving 18 May for final training. With , , and , she made her first war patrol between 14 June and 8 August. The coordinated attack group prowled waters west and north of Luzon, striking fiercely and with notable success at Japanese convoys. &quot;Piranha&quot;’s victims were &quot;Nichiran Maru&quot;, sunk 12 July, and &quot;Seattle Maru&quot;, sunk four days later. Several times attacked by enemy aircraft and dodging surface patrol craft, &quot;Piranha&quot; returned safely to Majuro.

For the first part of her second patrol, &quot;Piranha&quot; joined 9 other submarines in offensive reconnaissance covering the Third Fleet during the assault on Peleliu, patrolling 30 August to 25 September. When Peleliu, deemed essential for the liberation of the Philippines, had been seized, &quot;Piranha&quot;’s group dissolved and she searched for targets westward along the 20th parallel, engaging an enemy patrol craft 9 October. She endured a heavy depth charge attack, but outsmarted the patrol vessel, returning to Pearl Harbor 23 October.

During her third war patrol, again with an attack group, besides seeking worthwhile targets in the East China Sea 19 November to 13 January 1945, &quot;Piranha&quot; served as lifeguard during B-29 strikes on Kyūshū. She scored two hits on a merchantman 8 January {No.2 Shinto Maru}, only to be driven off by an escort without being able to regain attack position.

Refitted at Guam, &quot;Piranha&quot; sailed 11 February for her fourth war patrol, a classic exhibition of submarine versatility. With her attack group she sought targets on the convoy lanes from Luzon to Formosa and Hong Kong. She spent 17 days on lifeguard during airstrikes on Formosa, on 27 February sinking a junk presumably serving as aircraft spotter.

&quot;Piranha&quot; was foiled by a large fleet of fishing junks from making a rapid approach on a convoy reported leaving Hong Kong 5 March. Daringly resorting to an ancient ruse of naval warfare, she improvised an Imperial Japanese Navy naval ensign and ran it up. The deception was successful, and she threaded her way through the fishermen at flank speed, but was unable to locate the convoy.

On 9 March 1945, an unidentified plane attacked &quot;Piranha&quot;, dropping a flare and two bombs. On 11 March, a U.S. Navy PBM Mariner flying boat attacked her, dropping four bombs as she took evasive action and headed for deeper water on the surface. On 20 March, an Allied aircraft which &quot;Piranha&quot;′s crew thought was most likely a United States Army Air Forces B-24 Liberator bomber bombed &quot;Piranha&quot; as she maneuvered evasively and submerged. &quot;Piranha&quot; sustained no damage in any of the attacks.

&quot;Piranha&quot; bombarded Pratas Island on 26 March 1945 with 100 shells. Three times during this patrol, which concluded with 10 days off Wake Island, the submarine successfully maneuvered to avoid hits from attacking aircraft. She returned to Midway to refit 21 April – 17 May, then sailed for patrol, lifeguard, and bombardment at Marcus Island 22 May – 31 May. Here she was attacked several times by shore batteries. After refueling at Saipan, &quot;Piranha&quot; sailed to complete this patrol off Honshū.

With the decimated Japanese merchant marine hugging its own coast, &quot;Piranha&quot; was frequently frustrated by shallow water and omnipresent escorts in her attacks. Hair-raising encounters with submarine chasers and aircraft were rendered infinitely more dangerous by being fought so close offshore, where she had little water depth for maneuver. Her persistence and courage paid off; she heavily damaged a freighter 14 June, sank a coastal tanker and destroyed a trawler laden with oil drums by gunfire 17 June. On 22 June 1945, she fired two torpedoes at the escort ship &quot;CD-196&quot; at blowing off her rudder and killing two crewman. Two more trawlers fell to her gun 23 June. Though slightly damaged when their escort retaliated with depth charges, &quot;Piranha&quot; returned safely to Pearl Harbor 10 July.

==End of war and fate==

Her sixth and last war patrol lasted 14 hours; she had sailed from Pearl Harbor 14 August and was ordered back when hostilities ended the next day. Returning to San Francisco 11 September, &quot;Piranha&quot; decommissioned at Mare Island Naval Shipyard 31 May 1946. There she lay in reserve, redesignated AGSS-389 on 6 November 1962, until stricken from the Naval Register 1 March 1967 and sold for scrap. 

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Piranha&quot; received 5 battle stars for World War II service.

<text>William Benjamin K.C. Ross (December 12, 1855 – January 10, 1929) was a Canadian politician, lawyer and businessman.

A lawyer by training, Ross practised law in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He also pursued business interests such as helping found the Halifax Electric Tramway Company Limited. Ross was appointed to the Senate of Canada as a Conservative in 1912 by Sir Robert Borden.

In January 1926, he was appointed Leader of the Opposition in the Canadian Senate by Tory leader Arthur Meighen, and served briefly as Government Leader in the Canadian Senate when Meighen formed a short-lived government later that year. After the Conservatives lost the 1926 election, Ross resumed his position as Opposition Leader. Ross remained in that position until his death in 1929.

<doc id="1217639" wikidata="Q652818" url="?curid=1217639" title="Siem Reap province">
<text>Siem Reap, officially Siemreap ( , ), is a province (&quot;khaet&quot;) of northwestern Cambodia. It borders the provinces of Oddar Meanchey to the north, Preah Vihear and Kampong Thom to the east, Battambang to the south, and Banteay Meanchey to the west. Its capital and largest city is Siem Reap.

Siem Reap province is the tenth largest province in Cambodia. Having reached a population of one million in 2019, it ranks as the nation&#x27;s fourth most populous province. A large portion of Siem Reap province&#x27;s southern border is demarcated by the Tonle Sap and as such, it is one of the nine provinces that making up the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve. In modern times the province is best known as the site of Angkor and the Angkor Wat temple ruins, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is also the home of Banteay Srei, Roluos (temples), the UNESCO tentative site of Beng Mealea, and the UNESCO tentative site of Phnom Kulen National Park, home to the country&#x27;s largest reclining Buddha.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Siem Reap&quot; literally means &#x27;Siam defeated&#x27; and emerged after the victory of Ang Chan I over the Siamese in 1530 at Angkor, a reminder of the centuries-old conflict between the Siamese and the Khmer. In Siam, the province and its capital were called &quot;Siemmarat&quot; (), literally meaning &#x27;Siam&#x27;s territory&#x27;.

The capital was again renamed &quot;Siem Reap&quot; (siam defeated) after it was returned back to Cambodia in 1907 under the reign of Sisowath I (1904-1927) after military pressure on Siam by the joint forces of Cambodia and the French colonial government.

==History==
The province came under the control of the Thai kingdom of Siam in 1795 and was later returned to Cambodia in 1907 after the French colonist authority made a treaty with Siam for the exchange of Trat and Dan Sai for the Siamese province of Inner Cambodia which included Phra Tabong (Battambang), Siemmarat (Siem Reap), and Nakhon Wat (Angkor Wat). The Inner Cambodia province was split into Battambang and Siem Reap by the royal decree of King Sisowath the same year. This area became part of a disputed territory between France and Siam (now Thailand) which led to the Franco-Thai War in 1941, resulting in victory for Thailand and a return to Thai control (with exception of Siem Reap and Angkor Wat). The province again reverted to Cambodia in 1946, after the end of World War II with French and UN international pressure.

==Religion==
The state religion is Theravada Buddhism. More than 99.3% of the people in Siem Reap province are Buddhists. About 0.4% population of Siem Reap province follow Christianity. Islam which is mostly followed by Chams is 0.2% in the province.

==Subdivisions==
The province is divided into 2 municipalities and 11 districts, and further subdivided into 100 communes and 907 villages.

<text>Wāṇa or Wanna (, &quot;Wāṇə&quot; ; ) is the largest town in the South Waziristan District of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. It is the summer headquarters for the agency&#x27;s administration, Tank located in the neighbouring Tank District being the winter headquarters.

Wanna is also one of the three subdivisions of South Waziristan along with Ladha and Sarwakai. The subdivision of Wanna is further divided into three tehsils: Wanna, Barmal, and Toi Khwla.

==History==
===Colonial history===
During the British Empire, beginning in the late 19th century, the British established a cantonment on the Wanna Plain which was used as a headquarters by the British forces in South Waziristan till the partition of India in 1947. During their rule, the Pashtun tribes of Waziristan - part of the Karlanri Tribal Confederation - gave the British much headache. In fact, the British, known then as the &#x27;foreigners&#x27; , had to deal with a full-fledged insurgency in Waziristan in the 1930s. At one point during the 1930s, the British had up to 18,000 troops in and around Waziristan, with Wanna being used as the forward headquarters and airbase.

===Post-Independence===
During 1989, the city underwent a striking increase in Malaria with a village Azam Warsak suffering the most.

===Wanna in the War on Terror===

Wanna has been involved in the War on Terror due to the Al-Qaeda members affiliated with the Taliban-aligned Ahmadzai Waziris of the Wanna Plain. The Pakistan Armed forces have conducted several armed operations against these Al-Qaeda members since August 2003 off and on with limited success. Perhaps the town&#x27;s most violent incident in the War on Terror was the Battle of Wanna which took place in March 2004 and included fighters from the Pakistani Army against Al-Qaeda and Taliban forces. More than 100 armed personnel were killed during the week of the fighting.

==Ethnic background of inhabitants==
Inhabitants of Wanna are Muslim Pashtuns, primarily Ahmedzai Waziris from the Wazir tribe but other Pashtun tribes such as Mahsud and Bettani also live in the surroundings of Wanna.

<text>Club Sporting Cristal S.A. is a Peruvian sports club located in the city of Lima, best known for its football team. It was founded on 13 December 1955 in the Rímac district by engineer Richard Bentín Mujica and his wife Esther Grande de Bentín, stockholders of the Peruvian brewery Backus and Johnston. The club and the brewery have been closely linked since its inception, and it is for this reason that it is popularly known as &quot;los Cerveceros&quot; (&quot;the brewers&quot;).

The team has played in the Primera División since 1956, where it obtained the title that year. Due to this achievement, Cristal is often referred to as &quot;El club que nació campeón&quot;. Since their first participation, they have won the league title 19 times and are one of the few teams in Peru to have never been relegated from the top division. Sporting Cristal is also the first Peruvian team to have been crowned &quot;tricampeóns&quot;, successively winning the 1994, 1995, and 1996 seasons. In 1997, they were runners-up of the Copa Libertadores, losing the final to Brazilian side Cruzeiro. Cristal holds the longest undefeated streak in the tournament; 17 games without suffering a loss.

Cristal has a heated rivalry with Club Universitario de Deportes. One of the main reasons for the enmity between the two sides is the series of transfers of Universitario&#x27;s star players to &quot;los Celestes&quot;. The club also has rivalries with Alianza Lima, Deportivo Municipal, and Sport Boys.

Sporting Cristal plays its home games at the Estadio Alberto Gallardo. They play at the Estadio Nacional for international competitions such as the Libertadores or Sudamericana. The Estadio Nacional is also the venue for matches against Universitario and Alianza Lima.

In addition to football, the club has teams specializing in Esports, futsal, women&#x27;s football, and volleyball.

==History==
Ricardo Bentín Mujica, with the support of his wife, co-owners of Backus and Johnston brewery, was the man who is credited with achieving the company&#x27;s goal. A club from Rímac ward, known as Sporting Tabaco founded in 1926 and originally belonging to the tobacco growers&#x27; union, was already playing in the professional Peruvian First Division. Never having won a national championship, the club was in dire economic straits. Bentín decided to buy the club and search for a playing ground, so that the club could develop and be able to play better at the professional level. The club found a lot in the neighborhood of &quot;La Florida&quot; of 137,000 m2.

On 13 December 1955 the club was founded as Sporting Cristal , after Backus&#x27; best-known beer brand, &quot;Cristal&quot;. The new club from the Rímac ward debuted in 1956 in the professional Primera Division and won their first national title that same year. Journalists thus called them the club born a champion (&quot;nació campeon&quot;). The team managed to win more titles over the years and was known as one of the best football clubs in Peru after Universitario and Alianza Lima.

Even before its foundation, the Sporting Cristal Backus project had more than one opponent: articles from the time point out how certain sports journalists and football clubs viewed with displeasure that a team was financed by a private company. Even the Peruvian Football Federation itself put legal obstacles in the way of the team before and after its merger; until March 1956 the FPF did not authorize Cristal&#x27;s participation in that year&#x27;s championship, arguing from the prohibition of advertising in the clubs to the fact that they should have names of national heroes, places or institutions of the country. Various legal outlets were used for the impositions of the Federation, however, the controversy did not end until 1968,when the word &quot;Backus&quot; was finally removed from the club&#x27;s name.

As a champion of Peru in 1956, Cristal was invited to tour various parts of the world, this being the first tour made by a champion team of Peru. The series of matches began in the United States, continued through several Asian cities such as Kuala Lumpur, Malacca City and Tehran, and culminated in Spain. There were a total of 30 matches played over two months, of which 20 were won, 7 were drawn and there were only 3 defeats. The star of this tour was Alberto Gallardo, who scored 37 goals. The club shook up the market again when they signed the legendary Brazilian player, Didí in 1962, a world-famous footballer who had just won the 1962 World Cup title with his national team. Didí arrived to be the team&#x27;s coach and implemented the attacking and possession style of play characteristic of Brazil&#x27;s football. The Brazilian formed an eye-catching team that used to provide a show, however, he had to settle only for the runners-up in 1962 and 1963.

After retiring from football, Didí returned to take over the technical direction of the club for 1967, again obtaining the runner-up position that year. The revenge came the following season, in which Sporting Cristal obtained the highest score along with the Juan Aurich club, due to this the champion of the Descentralizado 1968 had to be defined in an extra match in which the &quot;brewers&quot; were victorious 2-1 thanks to two goals by Alberto Gallardo. In addition to its local titles, the young institution gained prestige for its international performances. During the 1962 edition until the 1969 edition of the Copa Libertadores, Sporting Cristal went on a 17-game undefeated streak, the longest unbeaten streak in the Copa Libertadores history, winning 8 games, and drawing 9.

The following years would bring new titles, the first of them in 1970, under the technical direction of the Argentine Vito Andrés Bártoli, in a tournament that was hard fought with Universitario de Deportes and that was defined in the Final Liguilla of the tournament. In this last stage, Cristal had the best performance and the highest accumulated score, thus winning a new title. Their last match was against Juan Aurich, defeating them 4-2.Of the 32 games played that year, the team won 18, drew 9 and lost 5.

Sporting Cristal changed its shirt color from blue to light blue. They are known as &quot;Los Celestes&quot;. During a brief period between 1978 and 1981, they again used blue shirts. In 1982 they returned to light blue as the color of the club.

The 1990s were the most successful decade as they claimed 4 national titles (including 3 in a row) with coach Juan Carlos Oblitas. Under Oblitas, Cristal won 1991, 1994 and 1995 domestic league. Then, guided by Sergio Markarián head coach they won 1996 league. By 1997, the team, led by Uruguayan coach Sergio Markarián, reached the finals of the Copa Libertadores, where they faced the Brazilian club &quot;Cruzeiro&quot;. The first leg was a home game, in which they ended in a scoreless draw; in the second leg, they lost 1–0. This is the closest Team Peru has come to the Copa Libertadores Final since 1972, when Universitario had a similar fate playing against Independiente.

The club stayed on the top spots of the national tournament during most of the 2000s and gained qualification to the Copa Libertadores eight years in a row from 2000 to 2007. It would only win two titles during the decade which were obtain in 2002 and 2005 with many notable players as Sergio Leal, Jorge Soto and Luis Alberto Bonnet. However, during the 2007, Cristal would come four points away from relegation. It would make a comeback during the 2008 season and qualify to the Copa Libertadores once again.

In 2009, the Primera División Peruana would change the tournament structured which caused Sporting Cristal to have mediocre results for the next few years into the new decade. After a seven-year dry spell it would become the national champion once more during the 2012 season when it defeated Real Garcilaso in the finals. They qualified to the 2013 Copa Libertadores where they did not pass the tournament&#x27;s group stage. In the 2013 season, they played on the same liguilla as Real Garcilaso and fought for a place in the final up to the last match of the season in which they finished third and qualified for the 2014 Copa Libertadores once more.

In the 2018 season, they conquered another historical feat, they became the best Team Peru in the Historic Table during the Professional Era (1966 - 2018). As of 2018, they surpassed Universitario for the first spot, 3264 points to Universitario&#x27;s 3236 points.

In the 2020 season, after a bad start in Liga 1 and Copa Libertadores, the club announced the departure of coach Manuel Barreto, days later Roberto Mosquera returned as technical director after 7 years. Sporting Cristal was unable to play in Phase 3 of the 2020 Copa Libertadores, as they lost 4-0 to Barcelona S.C., but won 2-1 in Lima, as an aggregate result of 5-2 against them. On March 12, the Torneo Apertura was stopped due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru. When the competition returned, the team finished in third place. In the Clausura Tournament they won group A and qualified for the definition against Ayacucho FC, they would be defeated by the &quot;foxes&quot; in the penalty kicks. Cristal, for being first in the accumulated table, would also play the semifinal with Ayacucho, in the first match they would win 2-1 and in the second they would win again with a resounding 4-1 qualifying for the national final. Sporting Cristal would achieve its twentieth title by beating Universitario in an aggregate of 3-2 in the final.

<text>Point Chevalier (; commonly known as Point Chev and originally named Point Bunbury after Thomas Bunbury) is a residential suburb and peninsula in the city of Auckland in the north of New Zealand. It is located five kilometres to the west of the city centre on the southern shore of the Waitematā Harbour. The suburb was originally a working-class area, with some state houses in the area, but over the past several decades the suburb has seen growth into becoming a middle-class suburb, with several redevelopment projects either completed or underway. Like most of the suburbs surrounding, Point Chevalier is known for its Californian style bungalows.

The suburb stretches from the town centre / shopping area of the same name on its southern edge (Great North Road, and near the SH16 motorway) to the tip of the peninsula in the north. Its postcode is 1022.

==Geography==

The suburb is situated to the north of State Highway 16 and the campus of Unitec Institute of Technology and to the west of the suburb of Western Springs. It is largely sited on the triangular peninsula, which extends north into the harbour for 1800 metres. The soil is mostly clay without the overlay of volcanic material which covers much of the Auckland isthmus; this means the vegetation of the area is less lush than some of the other suburbs of Auckland.

Visible from Coyle Park is Meola Reef, which is situated to the east of the Point Chevalier peninsula and bordering the suburb of Westmere. Meola Reef is an outcrop of black basalt rock which extends some distance north into the Waitematā Harbour. This is the end of the lava flow emanating from Three Kings volcano several miles south of this area. Formerly a landfill site, it has now been rehabilitated as a park and nature reserve. Other parks in the suburb include Walker Park, Eric Armshaw Reserve and Coyle Park. The latter is located at the northern tip of the peninsula.

== History ==

===Early history and European settlement===

Before the European settlement of the Auckland isthmus in the 1840s, small Maori settlements existed in the area which later became Point Chevalier, including one at Meola Reef and a fishing settlement at Rangi-mata-rau (later Point Chevalier Beach). The latter was a staging point for shark fishing off Kauri Point on the inner Waitematā Harbour.

As the city of Auckland grew, Point Chevalier gained strategic importance as it lay on what was then the main land route out of Auckland, the Great North Road. Because of this, a military encampment was located here during the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s. The name &#x27;Point Chevalier&#x27; comes from Captain George Robert Chevalier (1825 - 1871), a musketry instructor serving in the 65th Regiment, stationed at this camp.

The Point Chevalier area had a largely rural character up until the period between the two World Wars.

===As summer destination===

Coyle Park and Point Chevalier Beach were popular destinations for family outings during the interwar period, particularly in summer. Tramlines ran down Point Chevalier Road to Coyle Park, near the beach; during summer, special trams were laid on during summer to transport people from Grey Lynn, while buses brought others from Mount Albert and West Auckland suburbs. Following the Second World War, the combination of increased car ownership and the Auckland Harbour Bridge (1959) resulted in a complete reversal of this activity. The once crowded beach was deserted, and the various businesses that had prospered on the summer trade closed down or relocated. Whilst the tramlines were removed during the 1950s, the broadness of Point Chevalier Road - otherwise atypical for a fairly small suburb - and the paved-over roundabout terminus near Coyle Park both remain as evidence of their presence.

Due to sand loss and degradation over the 20th century, Point Chevalier Beach was resanded in 2008 with 16,000 cubic metres of sand from Pakiri Beach pumped onto the foreshore, creating a more usable beach area. The resanding has attracted larger numbers of summer visitors in the years since, making the northern part of Point Chevalier busy (and sometimes congested with vehicles) on fine weekends and holidays and at festival times.

===Demographic changes===

Up until the 1980s Point Chevalier&#x27;s population was largely blue-collar or elderly, the latter particularly due to the Selwyn Village retirement community (one of the largest in New Zealand). Over the 1980s and 1990s the suburb became home to increasing numbers of young families and middle-class professionals. However, 2013 census data suggested that Point Chevalier experienced a strong decrease in its young adult population (ages 20–34) after 2001; analysts have ascribed this to the increasing cost of housing in the central-western suburbs of Auckland.

==Demographics==
Point Chevalier covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Point Chevalier had a population of 8,535 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 78 people (0.9%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 369 people (4.5%) since the 2013 census. There were 3,927 males, 4,554 females and 51 people of other genders in 3,174 dwellings. 5.7% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 41.3 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally).

The results were 80.8% European (Pākehā); 10.5% Māori; 8.7% Pasifika; 11.4% Asian; 2.5% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA); and 1.4% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as &quot;New Zealander&quot;. English was spoken by 96.3%, Māori language by 2.8%, Samoan by 1.9%, and other languages by 14.4%. No language could be spoken by 2.1% (e.g. too young to talk). New Zealand Sign Language was known by 0.5%. The percentage of people born overseas was 24.3, compared with 28.8% nationally.

Of those at least 15 years old, 3,042 (43.8%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, 2,808 (40.4%) had a post-high school certificate or diploma, and 1,104 (15.9%) people exclusively held high school qualifications. The median income was $52,300, compared with $41,500 nationally. 1,845 people (26.6%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 3,564 (51.3%) people were employed full-time, 975 (14.0%) were part-time, and 180 (2.6%) were unemployed.

==Architecture and landmarks==
The Liverpool Estate is a piece of land bordered at one end by Great North and Point Chevalier Roads. Besides housing, it now contains a supermarket, assorted shops and the Point Chevalier Community Library. The estate was created in 1913 by a group known as the Liverpool Estate Syndicate and was marketed as a &quot;last opportunity&quot; to acquire main road frontage close to the city. It was only a fifteen-minute walk to the Arch Hill terminus and a significant selling point was that a motorbus passed by. The Point Chevalier Motor Bus Company ran from 1915-1920 and was owned by prominent locals, including a member of the Dignan family. Following the First World War with the rising price of oil, it went into voluntary liquidation. Estate land was also connected to sewerage and drainage, gas and water were available on the boundary and a school was nearby. Another factor was that it was not far from the &quot;beautiful Point Chevalier beach.&quot;

Several of the streets in the Liverpool Estate were named after New Zealand birds – Moa, Huia and Kiwi Roads and Tui Street - and according to the book Rangi-Mata-Rau: Pt Chevalier Centennial 1861-1961, it was a bird-loving (although unnamed) member of the Dignan family who got the honour of naming them.

The houses of the area are predominantly 1920s California-style bungalows and 1930s and 1940s Art Deco houses, which gives the suburb an interesting interwar atmosphere. Rising property values have spurred gentrification and subdivision in recent years, particularly north of Meola Road and in locations near to the water. Towards the northern end of the peninsula there are many houses from the postwar period, and a number of larger architect-designed homes have recently appeared close to Point Chevalier Beach.

There is a certain amount of light industry located in the area, especially close to Great North Road. Up until the mid-2000s car yards were a common land use along this road.

There is a retirement community, Selwyn Village, on the western side, overlooking the Waitematā Harbour. This community is run by an Anglican church trust and includes self-contained houses and apartments, bed-sits, a hospital, and a chapel.

The main shopping area at the intersection of Point Chevalier Road and Great North Road was developed during the interwar period; the most notable of the buildings here are:

* The former cinema (1920s designed by Sinclair O&#x27;Connor) later known as the &#x27;Ambassador&#x27; theatre, and currently the Ambassador Bar. The bar is owned by sculptor Peter Roche, who works on his artworks in the building.
*ASB Bank: Great North Road. This small neo-classical building is one of the many buildings commissioned by the Auckland Savings Bank from the architect Daniel B. Patterson. Similar buildings appear in Auckland suburban centres and in provincial towns throughout the Auckland Province. As of late 2016, the branch is now closed
*The current Point Chevalier Public Library located at the junction of Point Chevalier Road and Great North Road was opened in 1989.
*The former Point Chevalier Fire Station located on the corner of Point Chevalier Road and Tui Street. This 1920s classical style building is now occupied by a hostel.
*Carrington Hospital is a former lunatic asylum that was Auckland&#x27;s main psychiatric hospital for over a century. It has a category 1 heritage registration and has had two wings demolished to make way for a road.
*&quot;The Old Homestead&quot;, a 19th-century wooden farmhouse, was located until 2013 at the corner of Alberta Street and Point Chevalier Road. It was removed for storage and renovation at Kumeu by its owners, the Homestead Community Church. The church has built a new replica building on the same site.

<doc id="1217659" wikidata="Q7771470" url="?curid=1217659" title="The Unforgiving Sounds of Maow">
<text>The Unforgiving Sounds of Maow is a 1996 album by Vancouver punk band Maow. It was the band&#x27;s only full-length album, 21 minutes in length.

The album is notable primarily for being Neko Case&#x27;s debut as a lead vocalist, although her loud, punk-rock singing on this project is not typical of her later style. On the album, Case shares lead vocal duties with bandmates Tobey Black and Corrina Hammond. 

Many of the songs are about partying. The album&#x27;s best-known song, &quot;Ms. Lefevre&quot;, celebrates the character &quot;Renee Lefebvre&quot; from Woody Allen&#x27;s movie &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot; A music video was created to publicize the song.

The album also includes covers of songs by Wanda Jackson (&quot;Mean Mean Mean&quot;) and Nancy Sinatra (&quot;How Does That Grab You?&quot;).

==Critical reception==
Jim Smith compared the group&#x27;s style to early work by the Go-Gos. The Washington City Paper called the album &quot;unexceptional&quot;. Robert Kaups at AllMusic gave the album a mixed review. Michael Panontin of Canuckistan praised &quot;Ms. Lefevre&quot;.

<doc id="1217660" wikidata="Q4944291" url="?curid=1217660" title="Borallon Correctional Centre">
<text>Borallon Training and Correctional Centre is an Australian prison. Despite its name, it is not located in Borallon but on Ivan Lane, Ironbark, City of Ipswich, Queensland, Australia, approximately 15 minutes from Ipswich. When first opened as Borallon Correctional Centre, it was the first private correctional facility operated in Australia. It had a capacity of 492 prisoners. The centre reopened as Borallon Training and Correctional Centre in 2016.

The prison houses a library and gym. 

==History==
Whilst the prison buildings, equipment and land are owned by the Queensland Department of Corrective Services, Borallon Correctional Centre was originally operated by Corrections Company of Australia (which was in turned owned by Wormald International, Corrections Corporation of America and John Holland Group). It opened on 2 January 1990. In September 2007, Serco Australia won the bid to take over management at the prison. The facility cost $22 million to construct.

The management company was responsible for the day-to-day running of the centre, financial management and the hiring of staff, within the bounds laid down by the Corrective Services Act 2000. Whilst they were not public servants, staff employed at Borallon Correctional Centre had the same powers and responsibilities as government prison counterparts with respect to the management of prisoners and are offered the same access to Departmental training as their government colleagues; the only exception was Custodial Officer training which was conducted in-house. Employees couldn&#x27;t transfer to another prison nor receive public service benefits. Prisoners within Borallon Correctional Centre could work or take courses to correct their behavior. They could also complete schooling, TAFE and university studies.

The contract to manage Borallon Correctional Centre was subject to tender between February and May 2007, with GEO, MTC, GSL and Serco selected as bidders. On 4 September 2007, Serco was selected as preferred bidder.

Borallon Correctional Centre was decommissioned in early 2012, in conjunction with the opening of the new Southern Queensland Correctional Centre. The final date for visits to prisoners was on 22 January 2012.

Borallon re-opened on 11 April 2016 as Borallon Training and Correctional Centre promoted as Queensland&#x27;s first dedicated training prison, with a focus on education, training and employment outcomes. Prisoners can undertake 50 TAFE courses and complete certificates, under an &quot;earn and learn&quot; system.

Borallon has different types of cells, including 95 &#x27;residential&#x27; cells and 153 &#x27;secure&#x27; cells. A further 244 cells require major changes to meet current standards due to recognised &quot;hanging points&quot;.

Borallon opened 100 new cells in 2018, to make way for an influx of prisoners from Southern Queensland Correctional Centre which was turned into a women&#x27;s prison.

<doc id="1217662" wikidata="Q7772828" url="?curid=1217662" title="The Virginian (album)">
<text>The Virginian is the 1997 debut studio album by American vocalist Neko Case, whose backing band at that time consisted of a rotating group of musicians referred to as &quot;Her Boyfriends&quot;. It was Case&#x27;s first solo record after previously being a member of Vancouver pop punk bands Maow and Cub.

Guest musicians on the album include Carl Newman, Carolyn Mark, Rose Melberg, Matt Murphy, Brian Connelly, and Darryl Neudorf. Case and Newman would later form the New Pornographers with other Vancouver musicians.

The song &quot;Karoline&quot; was a re-recording of the song &quot;Rebecca Lash&quot; which Case had written and recorded with her previous band Maow. &quot;Misfire&quot; is a cover of a Queen song, originally recorded on the band&#x27;s &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; album. A video for &quot;Timber&quot; was shot; however, CMT did not air it, calling it too dark. Case herself was unhappy with the video and did not want it aired.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote that Case &quot;comes across like a latter-day Brenda Lee, warbling about bluegrass and honky-tonks as if she&#x27;d been raised on them, filling her songs with inventive word play, heartbreak and humour while refugees from bands such as Sloan, Copyright and Zumpano bang out their best impersonation of 1950s Nashville session guys.&quot;

<text>Furnace Room Lullaby is the second studio album by Neko Case and Her Boyfriends, released in February 2000, on Mint Records.

Said Case of the title track at a performance at Austin City Limits in 2003, &quot;I wanted to write a murder ballad, simply because I was such a huge fan of the Louvin Brothers. Not that this song is anywhere as good as a Louvin Brothers song, but I tried.&quot;

Guest musicians on the album include Scott Betts, Brian Connelly, Bob Egan, Dallas Good and Travis Good, Kelly Hogan, Evan Johns, Kevin Kane, Don Kerr, Linda McRae, Darryl Neudorf, Carl Newman, Ford Pier, John Ramberg, Henri Sangalang, Ron Sexsmith and Joel Trueblood.

The title track was included on the soundtrack to Sam Raimi&#x27;s film &quot;The Gift&quot;.

<text>Port-Menier, Quebec () is a fishing town at the western end of Anticosti Island, Quebec, Canada, part of the L&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Anticosti municipality. The port village was built during the late 19th century by French chocolate maker Henri Menier.

The village is the hub of Anticosti Island. Its population doubles in the summer with seasonal workers and tourists. The economic mainstays are outdoor tourism, especially deer hunting, and forestry/logging. Services available in Port-Menier are: general and grocery stores, gas station, banking (Caisse populaire Desjardins), car rental (Location Sauvageau), restaurant, and lodging.

Port-Menier can be reached via a ferry that runs between Sept-Îles, Port-Menier and Havre-Saint-Pierre, as well as other destinations along the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River. This service is operated by Relais Nordik and runs from April through January. The nearby Port-Menier Airport also provides transportation options for the town.

== History ==

In 1680, Louis Jolliet became the first owner and Seigneurial Lord of the entire Anticosti Island. Together with him, the first few settlers arrived on the island. But no significant development took place until 1895 when Henri Menier bought the island and hoped to set up a seignory that could be self-supporting.

He first established a settlement at Bay Sainte-Claire in 1895 but the bay proved too shallow for the large ships he would need. In 1900, he moved the settlement to Ellis Bay and established Port-Menier along the waterfront with a 1,000 metre (1000 yard) wharf. He invested a substantial amount of money to construct a sawmill to service the logging operations that harvested softwood timber for building lumber and Wood pulp for the manufacture of paper products. The community was centred on a new cannery business designed to take advantage of the abundant supply of fish and lobsters. The town had its own hospital, school, Roman Catholic church, general store, bank, bakery, hotel, plus homes and rooming houses for the workers, and a 30-room Scandinavian-style mansion for himself. Once completed, the island was home to 800 permanent residents, most of whom were French Canadians. Residents and businesses obtained supplies from a sailing ship Menier operated between Quebec City and the Gaspé, and obtained coal from the mines at Sydney, Nova Scotia.

After Henri Menier&#x27;s death, the island and the village remained in his family until 1926 after which it became property of a succession of logging companies. The village was thereby not much more than a company town and saw little development. In 1974, the Quebec government bought the island and set up a working municipal council in 1984.

<doc id="1217668" wikidata="Q4923119" url="?curid=1217668" title="Blacklisted (Neko Case album)">
<text>Blacklisted is the third studio album by American musician Neko Case, released on August 20, 2002.

&quot;Blacklisted&quot; marked a departure from the alternative country sounds of Case&#x27;s first two solo albums(?). Guest musicians on the album include Howe Gelb, Kelly Hogan, Mary Margaret O&#x27;Hara, Joey Burns, John Convertino, and Dallas Good.

As of 2009, sales in the United States have exceeded 113,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

== Critical reception ==
Upon original release, &quot;Blacklisted&quot; was met with critical applause, with particular praise towards Case&#x27;s vocals. AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Deming wrote that it contained &quot;some of her finest and most insightful performances to date&quot;, as well as noting her progressions as a lyricist and composer. Eric Carr for &quot;Pitchfork&quot; echoed this, dubbing her vocals &quot;dense with emotional heft and more richly expressive&quot; than her previous work in power pop collective The New Pornographers. Carr also applauded the backing musicians, calling their contributions &quot;roundly excellent and evocative&quot;.

===Legacy===
&quot;Blacklisted&quot; has continually earned praise in recent years, with critics applauding the results that came from Case&#x27;s then-newfound artistic control. In a 20th anniversary review, &quot;Spectrum Culture&quot;″s Susan Darlington saw it show Case &quot;at her sharpest and most fearless&quot;, writing that its songs&#x27; &quot;confidence… [are] so great that it makes the listener wonder why it took her so long to take sole writing credits.&quot; In another retrospective review, &quot;Stereogum&quot;″s Rachel Brodsky saw it announce Case &quot;forging her own country-noir sound&quot;, noting its &quot;then-new&quot; qualities such as &quot;pioneering&quot; genre fusion and more. Brodsky wrote of &quot;legions of younger artists&quot; who would try to replicate &quot;Blacklisted&quot;″s sound in the years since its release.

In 2016, &quot;Exclaim!&quot;″s Sarah Greene ranked the album second out of five essential Case records. She called its songs &quot;decadently dark and beautifully scary, providing a sympathetic backdrop for [her] torchy performances.&quot; In 2020, &quot;Consequence&quot; ranked it the best of Case&#x27;s nine solo works.

Online music magazine &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed &quot;Blacklisted&quot; at number 141 on their list of top 200 albums of the 2000s.

<text>Bonneville International Corporation is a media and broadcasting company, wholly owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) through its for-profit arm, Deseret Management Corporation. It began as a radio and TV network in the Triad Center Broadcast House in Salt Lake City, Utah. Bonneville&#x27;s name alludes to Benjamin Bonneville and the prehistoric Lake Bonneville that once covered much of modern-day Utah, which was named after him.
Bonneville owns 13 radio stations in four major markets as well as one television station in its home market; it also manages eight additional radio stations in two markets under a local marketing agreement. Additionally, its Bonneville Communications division provides marketing and communications strategy and branding services. Bonneville Distribution, another division, provides broadcast syndication and distribution services to non-profit organizations.

==History==
Bonneville International was formed in 1964, with the approval of the LDS Church&#x27;s First Presidency. It was formed to acquire KSL (AM)-FM-TV in its hometown of Salt Lake City, as well as KIRO-AM-FM-TV in Seattle, which had previously been subsidiaries of the &quot;Deseret News&quot;. The LDS Church divested itself of the Seattle stations between 1995 and 1997, but reacquired KIRO-AM 10 years later. The company has also owned stations in New York City, Dallas, Kansas City, and Los Angeles at one point.

In 1980 it formed Bonneville Communications Corporation, primarily to broadcast LDS General Conference.

Bonneville prided itself on &quot;values-oriented programming&quot; and community involvement, in line with the company&#x27;s mission as set forth by its first president and founder, Arch L. Madsen. According to Bonneville International&#x27;s website, their values reflect an understanding that &quot;families are the basic unit of society... and that strong families build strong communities.&quot;

Due to a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) media cross-ownership rule, Bonneville was unable to purchase additional media outlets in Salt Lake City beyond its flagship cluster. In anticipation of a rule change, Bonneville purchased four additional Salt Lake radio stations in 2002. The FCC did not grant approval for this purchase until 2003, upon which the stations were acquired by Bonneville. The status of this deal is still uncertain—the FCC has only granted a waiver to Bonneville, and a recent court ruling has put the FCC cross-ownership rule changes into question.

On October 4, 2004, Bonneville International announced plans to buy three stations from Emmis Communications in the Phoenix, Arizona market, in exchange for WLUP &quot;The Loop&quot; in Chicago and cash.

On January 4, 2006, Bonneville and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; announced that the frequencies currently used by WTOP, 1500 kHz AM and 107.7 MHz FM, would be reassigned to a new station, &quot;Washington Post Radio.&quot; WTOP would move to 103.5 MHz, the frequencies currently used by classical music station WGMS, which in turn would move to 104.1 and 103.9 MHz, the frequencies used by WWZZ, which would be closed.

WGMS itself would fall silent a little more than a year later, on January 22, 2007. In its place is 1970s-1980s-adult-hits-station WXGG (&quot;George 104&quot;). Simultaneously, public radio station WETA-FM dropped its news/talk format in order to revive its previous classical format, via a partnership with Bonneville. WETA would also receive WGMS&#x27; entire music library, hired WGMS&#x27; last program director, and also retained the usage of the WGMS call sign. George 104 would last less than four months, when in April 2007, it was announced that the 104.1 frequency would be LMA&#x27;d to Radio One. On April 7, 2007, the frequency would flip to a Gospel and Inspiration format, known as Praise 104.1.

The Washington Post Radio experiment ended in September 2007, as the three stations (including the powerful AM 1500 signal) became WWWT, or &quot;3WT&quot;. Hosts include syndicated hosts from the Right (Bill O&#x27;Reilly, Glenn Beck, Neal Boortz) and Left (Stephanie Miller) as well as Washington Nationals baseball. The station&#x27;s morning show will continue.

Rush Limbaugh once worked for Bonneville Communications, after his stint with the Kansas City Royals.

CBS Radio has announced that it would sell 50 radio stations in 12 markets to focus on major market stations. As of September 22, 2008, Bonneville is one of the seven candidates to make first-round bids.

On August 12, 2009; Citadel Broadcasting has rumored that they&#x27;re planning to sell the former Disney/ABC&#x27;s 23 stations to reduce its debt load, however several financial factors may put the deal at risk. While not all the stations can be sold off, Bonneville has expressed interest in 2 FM stations in Washington D.C. (WJZW and WRQX).

On January 19, 2011, Bonneville announced it would sell 17 radio stations in Cincinnati, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and St. Louis to Hubbard Broadcasting for $505 million. The deal closed May 2, 2011.

On November 17, 2017, Bonneville began operating four San Francisco radio stations and four Sacramento radio stations under a local marketing agreement on behalf of the Entercom Divestiture Trust, following Entercom&#x27;s merger with CBS Radio. On August 3, 2018, Bonneville acquired the stations outright for $141 million; the deal had been delayed by succession issues related to the death of LDS Church president Thomas S. Monson the preceding January.

On September 30, 2021, it was announced that Bonneville International, owner of the KSL (AM) and KSL-FM, would be taking over operations of The Zone sports network. The arrangement with Bonneville will result in select Utah Jazz games being aired on KSL. Founding host Gordon Monson and some producers were laid off by the new management. The Zone introduced a new lineup effective October 20.

On September 30, 2021, Bonneville International, owner of KSL and KSL-TV, began operating KZNS/KZNS-FM &quot;The Zone&quot; in Salt Lake City under a local marketing agreement with Jazz Communications LLC, through the sports division of KSL News Radio. The operating agreement will allow select Utah Jazz games to be simulcast on KSL-AM 1160 and KSL-FM 102.7. Gordon Monson and Austin Horton were among the long time employees of The Zone who were dismissed as a result of KSL Sports assuming operations of KZNS. Although KSL Sports is responsible for overseeing daily operations of KZNS, Ryan Smith dba Jazz Communications LLC retains ownership of both 1280 AM and 97.5 FM according to the FCC database. The Zone&#x27;s website at 1280thezone.com is now a dead link. The stations can now be streamed at kslsports.com/thezone/. In June 2022, The Zone officially moved its operations from Vivint Arena to newly built studios and office space in the Triad Center, joining the other radio stations (KSL (radio network), KSFI, KRSP-FM) and KSL-TV, as well as Deseret News, a print newspaper owned by the parent company of Bonneville International. KSL News Radio, KSL-TV, KSL.com, and Deseret News share a consolidated newsroom.

From 2010 to 2016, Bonneville International also operated an independent TV station, KJZZ-TV (channel 14), in Salt Lake City, under a local marketing agreement with Larry H. Miller Communications Corporation. The arrangement ended when Sinclair Broadcast Group acquired KJZZ-TV.
