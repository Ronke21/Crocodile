<text>In French, liaison () is the pronunciation of a linking consonant between two words in an appropriate phonetic and syntactic context. For example, the word () is pronounced , the word () is pronounced , but the combination is pronounced , with a linking .

Liaison only happens when the following word starts with a vowel or semivowel, and is restricted to word sequences whose components are linked in sense, e.g., article + noun, adjective + noun, personal pronoun + verb, and so forth. This indicates that liaison is primarily active in high-frequency word associations (collocations).

Most frequently, liaison arises from a mute word-final consonant that used to be pronounced, but in some cases it is inserted from scratch, as in (), which is the inverted form of (). In certain syntactic environments, liaison is impossible; in others, it is mandatory; in others still, it is possible but not mandatory and its realization is subject to wide stylistic variation.

==Realization of liaison==
Silent final consonants may be pronounced, in some syntactic contexts, when the following word begins with a vowel or non-aspirated &quot;h&quot;. It is important to note that many words with silent final consonants have utterly lost them, e.g. neither the &#x27;n&#x27; in &quot;million&quot; nor the &#x27;t&#x27; in &quot;art&quot; is ever pronounced. A liaison should not be made just because a word ends in a silent consonant and the next one starts with a vowel.

The following list describes liaison from an orthographic point of view. Since the latent sound is an ancient one, spellings that are based on the etymology of the word may use a different consonant. Liaison consonants are pronounced as follows (the transcription uses IPA; in IPA, liaison is indicated by placing an undertie between the consonant and the vowel):

There is also a type of liaison where an adjective changes its form before a vowel-initial noun: adjectives ending on &quot;-ain&quot;, &quot;-ein&quot;, &quot;-en&quot;, &quot;-in&quot; or &quot;-on&quot; denasalize their vowels. The word &quot;bon&quot; is but &quot;bon ami&quot; is . Similarly, &quot;certain ami&quot; , &quot;divin enfant&quot; and &quot;Moyen Âge&quot; . This makes the adjectives sound like their feminine forms, so &quot;bon ami&quot; is pronounced the same as &quot;bonne amie&quot;. In some cases, this alternation is reflected in the orthography: &quot;un beau cygne&quot; but &quot;un bel oiseau&quot; (both masculine singular).

As indicated in the phonetic representations above, liaison consonants are typically realized with &quot;enchainement&quot; – that is, the originally word-final consonant is pronounced as the onset of the following syllable. Enchainement is also observed for &quot;pronounced&quot; (in contrast to the silent ones of this section) word-final consonants when followed by a vowel-initial word in connected speech, as in &quot;cher ami&quot; (&quot;dear friend&quot;). In both cases, &quot;enchainement&quot; can be seen as a strategy for avoiding syllables without onsets in French.

===Liaison on French numerals===
Some numbers pattern in complex ways, allowing up to three different pronunciations depending on context. For brevity, from now on &quot;vowel-initial&quot; means
&quot;phonologically vowel-initial, excluding aspirated &quot;h&quot;&quot;, while &quot;consonant-initial&quot; means &quot;phonologically consonant-initial, including aspirated &quot;h&quot;&quot;. Also note that these rules may slightly vary depending on dialect.

* &quot;cinq&quot; (&quot;five&quot;): It is always pronounced as . However, an oral stop in French may assimilate to a nasal one when it appears after a nasal vowel and before another consonant, so &quot;cinq minutes&quot; is frequently pronounced .

* &quot;six&quot; (&quot;six&quot;): It is pronounced before a vowel-initial noun, adjective or month name, i.e. &quot;six hommes&quot; , &quot;six avril&quot; . However, it is pronounced before a consonant-initial noun, adjective or month name, i.e. &quot;six pommes&quot; , &quot;six beaux oiseaux&quot; , &quot;six mars&quot; . Elsewhere, it is pronounced , i.e. &quot;six ou neuf&quot; .

* &quot;sept&quot; (&quot;seven&quot;): It is consistently pronounced the same: , as a homophone of &quot;cette&quot;.

* &quot;huit&quot; (&quot;eight&quot;): It is when before a consonant-initial noun, adjective or month name, i.e. &quot;huit minutes&quot; . Elsewhere, it is , i.e. &quot;huit ou neuf&quot; .

* &quot;neuf&quot; (&quot;nine&quot;): It is pronounced , with the exception of in &quot;neuf ans&quot;, &quot;neuf heures&quot; and, rarely, &quot;neuf hommes&quot;. Traditionally &quot;neuf&quot; is also pronounced before a consonant-initial noun, adjective or month name, like its homophone &quot;neuf&quot; meaning &quot;new&quot; (&quot;see Neuf-Brisach&quot;).

* &quot;dix&quot; (&quot;ten&quot;): With respect to liaison, it behaves like &quot;six&quot;. However, the common combinations &quot;dix-sept&quot; (&quot;seventeen&quot;), &quot;dix-huit&quot; (&quot;eighteen&quot;) and &quot;dix-neuf&quot; (&quot;nineteen&quot;) are respectively pronounced , and .

* &quot;vingt (&quot;twenty&quot;)&quot;: It is pronounced before a vowel-initial noun, adjective or digit from one to nine, i.e. &quot;vingt-six&quot; , &quot;vingt amis&quot; . Elsewhere, it is pronounced . However, in Belgium, Switzerland, and most of eastern and northern France, &quot;vingt&quot; is generally pronounced regardless of the context.

* &quot;quatre-vingt&quot; (&quot;eighty&quot;): The &quot;t&quot; is never pronounced: &quot;quatre-vingt-dix-neuf&quot; (99) is , &quot;quatre-vingt-un&quot; (81) is and &quot;quatre-vingt-onze&quot; (91) is . However, &quot;quatre-vingts&quot; makes a liaison before vowel-initial nouns or adjectives.

==Constraints on liaison==
Although the actual realization of liaison is subject to interacting syntactic, prosodic, and stylistic constraints, the primary requirement for liaison at a given word boundary is the phonological and lexical identity of the words involved. The preceding word must supply a potential liaison consonant and the following word must be vowel-initial (and not exceptionally marked as disallowing liaison). If the two words are separated by a prosodic break, a &quot;liaison non enchaînée&quot; may happen, as in (&#x27;ils ont... entendu&#x27;), where the liaison consonant is pronounced at the onset of the word after the hesitation pause.

Grammatical descriptions of French identify three kinds of liaison contexts: Those where liaison is mandatory, those where it is impossible, and those where it is optional. Pedagogical grammars naturally emphasize what is mandatory or forbidden, and these two categories tend to be artificially inflated by traditional prescriptive rules. Speakers&#x27; natural behavior in spontaneous speech shows that in fact relatively few contexts can be said to systematically give rise to, or fail to give rise to, liaison. Any discussion of liaison must take both descriptive and prescriptive perspectives into account, because this is an area of French grammar where speakers can consciously control their linguistic behavior out of an awareness of how their speech diverges from what is considered &quot;correct&quot;.

===Mandatory liaison===
There are a small number of contexts where speakers consistently produce liaison in all speech styles, and where the absence of liaison is immediately perceived as an error of pronunciation. These are the contexts where liaison is truly mandatory: 
* between a determiner and a following adjective or noun: &quot;les enfants&quot; (&quot;the children&quot;), &quot;ton ancien prof&quot; (&quot;your former teacher&quot;), &quot;tout homme&quot; (&quot;every man&quot;)
* between a subject or object pronoun and the verb, or vice versa, or between two pronouns: &quot;nous avons&quot; (&quot;we have&quot;), &quot;prenez-en&quot; (&quot;take some&quot;), &quot;elles en achètent&quot; (&quot;they buy some&quot;)
* in some lexicalized expressions and compound words: &quot;États-Unis&quot; (&quot;USA&quot;), &quot;porc-épic&quot; (&quot;porcupine&quot;)
Note that the first two contexts also require mandatory vowel elision for the relevant determiners and pronouns (&quot;le&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, &quot;je&quot;, &quot;me&quot;, &quot;se&quot;, etc.)

The following contexts are often listed as mandatory liaison contexts, but they are more accurately characterized as contexts where liaison is frequent:
* between an adjective and a noun that follows it: &quot;important effort&quot; (&quot;important effort&quot;), &quot;certaines études&quot; (&quot;some studies&quot;)
* between an adverb and the word it modifies: &quot;assez intéressant&quot; (&quot;quite interesting&quot;), &quot;trop amusé&quot; (&quot;amused too much&quot;)
* after a (monosyllabic) preposition: &quot;chez un ami&quot; (&quot;at a friend&#x27;s house&quot;)
Specific instances of these combinations reveal varying tendencies. For certain lexical items (e.g. &quot;petit&quot;, &quot;très&quot;), speakers may have a preference for liaison approaching that of the mandatory liaison contexts.

====Liaison on inverted verbs====
The consonant is obligatorily realized between the finite verb and a vowel-initial subject pronoun (&quot;il(s)&quot;, &quot;elle(s)&quot; or &quot;on&quot;) in inversion constructions. Orthographically, the two words are joined by a hyphen, or by &quot;-t-&quot; if the verb does not end in &quot;-t&quot; or &quot;-d&quot;:

The written linking consonant &quot;-t-&quot; is necessary for 3rd person singular verbs whose orthographic form ends in a letter other than &quot;-t&quot; or &quot;-d&quot;. This situation arises in the following cases: 
* ending in &quot;-e&quot;: present tense indicative of all regular &quot;-er&quot; verbs, and some &quot;-ir&quot; verbs, such as &quot;ouvrir&quot; (&quot;ouvre&quot; &quot;opens&quot;)
* ending in &quot;-a&quot;: &quot;va&quot; &quot;goes&quot;, &quot;a&quot; &quot;has&quot;, simple past tense of &quot;-er&quot; verbs, future tense of all verbs
* ending in a consonant: &quot;vainc&quot; &quot;conquers&quot;, &quot;convainc&quot; &quot;convinces&quot;
The appearance of this consonant in modern French can be described as a restoration of the Latin 3rd person singular ending &quot;-t&quot;, under the influence of other French verbs that have always maintained final &quot;-t&quot;.

The earliest examples of this analogical &quot;t&quot; in writing date to the mid-15th century, although this practice (and the corresponding pronunciation) was not fully accepted by grammarians until the 17th century.

When the first-person singular present tense form of the indicative or subjunctive is found in inversion, the writer must change the final &quot;e&quot; to either &quot;é&quot; (traditional usage) or &quot;è&quot; (rectified modern usage), in order to link the two words : &quot;Parlè-je ?&quot;, , &quot;Am I speaking?&quot; (This is a very rare construction, however.)
====Liaison on imperative verbs====
Imperative verbs followed by &quot;en&quot; and &quot;y&quot; always acquire liaison, and respectively.
The imperative suffixes &quot;moi + en&quot; and &quot;moi + y&quot; give as a result &quot;m’en&quot; and &quot;m’y&quot;, and analogically &quot;toi + en&quot; and &quot;toi + y&quot; become &quot;t’en&quot; and &quot;t’y&quot;. However, in colloquial speech the expressions &quot;moi-z-en&quot;, &quot;toi-z-en&quot;; &quot;moi-z-y&quot; and &quot;toi-z-y&quot; have become widespread (also registered as &quot;-z’en&quot; and &quot;-z’y&quot;). The possible reason for this phonological trend is because it follows the same logic, in which all verbs ending on &quot;en&quot; and &quot;y&quot; always use the liaison , like in &quot;parles-en&quot; (talk [about it]!), &quot;vas-y&quot; (go [here/there]!).
===Impossible liaison===
There are other contexts where speakers produce liaison only erratically (e.g. due to interference from orthography while reading aloud), and perceive liaison to be ungrammatical.
* between a non-pronominal noun phrase (e.g. a non-pronominal subject) and the verb: &quot;Mes amis arrivent&quot; (&quot;My friends are arriving.&quot;)
* between two complements of a ditransitive verb: &quot;donner des cadeaux à Jean&quot; (&quot;give presents to Jean&quot;)
* between two complete clauses: &quot;Ils parlent et j&#x27;écoute.&quot; (&quot;They talk and I listen.&quot;)
* after certain words, for example &quot;et&quot; (&quot;and&quot;), and all singular nouns. This can help disambiguate between word uses: &quot;un précieux insolent&quot; (pronounced without liaison) could mean &quot;an insolent member of the &quot;précieuses&quot; literary movement&quot; (&quot;précieux&quot; can be a noun), but with liaison &quot;un précieux insolent&quot; can only refer to a precious insolent person (&quot;précieux&quot; can also be an adjective).

In fixed expressions, singular nouns can allow liaison (&quot;accentaigu&quot;, &quot;faitaccompli&quot;, &quot;caséchéant&quot;, &quot;motà mot&quot;, &quot;de partet d&#x27;autre&quot;).
* before &quot;aspirated &quot;h&quot;&quot; words: These are phonetically vowel-initial words that are exceptionally marked as not allowing liaison. Most of these words are written with a leading &quot;h&quot; (&quot;haricot&quot;, &quot;héros&quot;, &quot;haleter&quot;) which is not pronounced itself, but a few begin with a vowel or glide (&quot;onze&quot;, &quot;oui&quot;, &quot;yaourt&quot;). Note that some words beginning in &quot;h&quot; do experience liaison (e.g. &quot;homme&quot; in &quot;tout homme&quot;). Such words are said to begin with a &quot;mute h&quot; or &quot;h muet&quot;.

Grammars mention other contexts where liaison is &quot;forbidden&quot;, despite (or precisely because) speakers sometimes do produce them spontaneously.
* &quot;Règle de Littré&quot;. A liaison consonant should not be pronounced immediately after , as in &quot;pars avec lui&quot; , &quot;fort agréable&quot; or &quot;vers une solution&quot; . Plural is recognized as an exception to this rule, and various other counterexamples can be observed, like &quot;de part et d&#x27;autre&quot; .

===Optional liaison===
All remaining contexts can be assumed to allow liaison optionally, although exhaustive empirical studies are not yet available. Preferences vary widely for individual examples, for individual speakers, and for different speech styles. The realization of optional liaisons is a signal of formal register, and pedagogical grammars sometimes turn this into a recommendation to produce as many optional liaisons as possible in &quot;careful&quot; speech. The conscious or semi-conscious application of prescriptive rules leads to errors of hypercorrection in formal speech situations (see discussion below).
Conversely, in informal styles, speakers will semi-consciously avoid certain optional liaisons in order not to sound &quot;pedantic&quot; or &quot;stilted&quot;. Other liaisons lack this effect. For example, &quot;Ilsont () attendu&quot; (&quot;they have waited&quot;) is less marked than &quot;tu asattendu&quot; (&quot;you have waited&quot;), and neither liaison is likely to be realized in highly informal speech (where one might instead hear and , or simply .) On the other hand, the liaison in &quot;pasencore&quot; can be either present or absent in this register.

==Liaison errors==
As can be seen, liaison is only mandatory in a small set of frequent cases. The omission of such a liaison would be considered an error, not simply as taking liberties with the rule. In cases of optional liaison, the omission is common, and liaison appears only in careful speech.

On the other end, producing a liaison where one is impossible is perceived as an error. For example, pronouncing a liaison consonant instead of respecting hiatus before an aspirated &quot;h&quot; is taken to indicate an uncultivated or unsophisticated speaker. While all speakers know the rule, there is variation as to which words it is applied to. The effect is less noticeable with rare words (such as &quot;hiatus&quot; itself), which many speakers may not spontaneously identify as aspirated &quot;h&quot; words.

Errors due to hypercorrection or euphony are also observed: a liaison is pronounced where it does not exist (where it is possible by spelling, but forbidden, as with &quot;et (-t-) ainsi&quot;, or where it is impossible even by spelling, as with &quot;moi (-z-) avec&quot;). This phenomenon is called &quot;pataquès&quot;.

Numerals that lack a final orthographic &#x27;s&#x27; may sometimes be followed by an epenthetic , as in &#x27;cinq-z-amis&#x27; , to form a &quot;fausse liaison&quot; (or &#x27;pataquès&#x27;) in colloquial/non-formal speech and in some modern popular songs, a common practice for children or in imitations of their spoken language by adults.

Liaison errors are perceived in the same way as omissions of disjunction, suggesting an &quot;uncultivated&quot; speaker or extremely informal speech. Such an error is sometimes called &quot;cuir&quot; (‘leather’) when the inserted consonant is , &quot;velours&quot; (‘velvet’) when it is , although dictionaries do not all agree on these terms:

* &quot;Cuir&quot; (addition of erroneous -t-):
** &quot;Tu peux-t-avoir&quot;, instead of &quot;tu peuxavoir&quot; (with ).
* &quot;Velours&quot; (addition of erroneous -z-):
** &quot;moi-z-aussi&quot;.
** &quot;cent-z-euros&quot; (100 €), instead of &quot;centeuros&quot; (with ) — although &quot;deux centseuros&quot; (200 €) is correct (with ).

==Special cases: poetic verse and applied diction==
The reading of poetry (whether said or sung) requires that all liaisons be used (except those described above as impossible), even those of &quot;-e&quot;″s in the second-person singular as well as the reading of all necessary &quot;null &quot;e&quot;″s&quot; (see the French article on poetry for more details). The reading of the liaisons affects the number of syllables pronounced, hence is of chief importance for the correct pronunciation of a verse. French speakers tend as much as possible to avoid a hiatus or a succession of two consonants between two words, in a more or less artificial way.

The Académie Française considers careful pronunciation (but without the mandatory reading of &quot;null &quot;e&quot;″s&quot;) to be necessary in a formal setting. However, pushed too far, the over-proliferation of liaisons can render a speech ridiculous. It has been pointed out that French politicians and speakers (Jacques Chirac, for example) pronounce some liaison consonants, independently of the following word, introducing a pause or a schwa afterwards. For example, &quot;ils ont entendu&quot; (&quot;they heard&quot;) is normally pronounced or, in more careful speech, . A speaker using this &quot;politician&quot; pronunciation would say | (where /|/ represents a pause; &quot;ils ont ... entendu&quot;). One might even hear &quot;ils ont décidé&quot; (&quot;they decided&quot;) pronounced | (&quot;ils ont ... décidé&quot;) or (&quot;ils ont -euh .. décidé&quot;). In the first example, we have liaison without &quot;enchainement&quot;, not the normal configuration in ordinary speech. In the second, the liaison is completely non-standard, since it introduces a liaison consonant before another consonant.

==Mechanics of liaison==
Liaison is a form of vestigial enchainement that involves a follow-through between a final consonant and an initial vowel. However, what is particularly distinct for both liaison and enchainement is that the final consonant in both cases resyllabifies with the following vowel. Liaison is therefore a phonological process occurring at word boundaries, specifically an external sandhi phenomenon that may be disrupted in pausa.

Like elision (as in *&quot;je aime&quot; → &quot;j&#x27;aime&quot;), liaison can be characterized functionally as a euphonic strategy for avoiding hiatus. This type of analysis is called a synchronic approach. This approach does not explain cases where the first word already ends in a consonant, such as &quot;tels‿amis&quot;, and is therefore already perfectly euphonic.

It is also possible to analyse liaison diachronically. With this approach, the liaison consonant has always been there since the days of Latin, and has merely been elided in other contexts over time. So, the &quot;s&quot; pronounced in &quot;mes amis&quot; can be seen as simply preserving the &quot;s&quot; that was always pronounced in &quot;meos amicos&quot;. Seen in this way, it is &quot;mes frères&quot; that is exceptional, having lost the &quot;s&quot; that was pronounced in &quot;meos fratres&quot;.

French liaison and enchainement are essentially the same external sandhi process, where liaison represents the fixed, grammaticalized remnants of the phenomenon before the fall of final consonants, and enchainement is the regular, modern-day continuation of the phenomenon, operating after the fall of former final consonants. The process is the movement of final consonants across word boundaries to initial position in vowel-initial words so as to better conform to the French language&#x27;s preference for open syllables (over 70%), i.e., V, CV, or CCV, especially where two vowels might otherwise link together (vowel hiatus). Whereas enchainement occurs in all places in a sentence, liaison is restricted to within sense units (&quot;groupes rythmiques&quot;) and are strictly forbidden across these intonational boundaries. This implies that liaison, like enchainement, is restricted by open juncture, and in general, resyllabified consonants maintain their articulatory traits as if not in onset position. This difference helps French speakers distinguish between liaised consonants, pronounced as if before open juncture, and regular onset consonants, pronounced as if before closed juncture.

===Medieval consonants===
For example, the word &quot;grand&quot; is written &quot;grant&quot; in medieval manuscripts (&quot;grant&quot; served for both masculine and feminine gender). The orthography of that age was more phonetic; the word was in all likeliness pronounced , with an audible final , at least until the twelfth century. When that consonant became mute (like the majority of ancient final consonants in French), the word continued to be written &quot;grant&quot; (the preservation of this written form is explained by other reasons; see note), and then became &quot;grand&quot; by influence of its Latin etymology &quot;grandis&quot;, with a new (analogic) feminine form &quot;grande&quot;. The current spelling with a final mute &quot;d&quot; allows to better show the alternation between &quot;grand&quot; and &quot;grande&quot; (an alternation &quot;gran&quot; ~ &quot;grande&quot; or &quot;grant&quot; ~ &quot;grande&quot; would look less regular to the eye), as well as the lexical relation to &quot;grandeur&quot;, &quot;grandir&quot;, &quot;grandiloquent&quot;, etc. The root &quot;grand&quot; is written thus regardless of whether the &quot;d&quot; is pronounced , or it is silent, in order for its derivatives to have a single graphic identity, which facilitates memorization and reading.

However, the ancient final of &quot;grand&quot; did not cease to be pronounced when the following word began with a vowel and belonged to the same sense unit. Effectively, the consonant was no longer pronounced at the end of the word, but at the beginning of the next. Now an initial consonant rather than a final one, it did not undergo the same sound changes, so it continued to be pronounced.

Bearing in mind that grammatical stress in French falls on the final full syllable of a phrase, this situation can be symbolized as follows (the symbol ˈ indicates stress):
* &quot;grand&quot; is , which loses its final consonant at the end of a stress group and is realized as ;
* &quot;grand&quot; + &quot;homme&quot; = , which becomes &quot;grand homme&quot; (with a single stress); &quot;grand&quot; does not lose its final consonant because it is treated as the onset of the following syllable.

This has to do with what the hearer considers to be a word. If &quot;grand homme&quot; is analyzed as , the ear in fact understands , a continuous group of phonemes whose tonic accent signals that they form a unit. It is possible to make a division as instead of . Then this will no longer be felt to be a final consonant but a pre-stress intervocalic consonant, and therefore it will resist the deletion that it would undergo if it were at the end of a stressed syllable. It can however undergo other modifications thereafter.

The written form, though, was adapted to criteria that are not phonetic, but etymological (among others): where &quot;grand&quot; is written, is pronounced in front of certain vowels, without that being really awkward: the maintenance of the visual alternation &quot;-d&quot; ~ &quot;-de&quot; is more productive.

The other cases are explained in a similar fashion: &quot;sang&quot;, for example, was pronounced (and written &quot;sanc&quot;) in Old French, but the final &quot;-g&quot; has replaced the &quot;-c&quot; in order to recall the Latin etymology, &quot;sanguis&quot;, and derivatives like &quot;sanguinaire&quot;, &quot;sanguin&quot;. Currently this liaison is almost never heard except sometimes in the expression &quot;suer sang et eau&quot;. Outside those, the hiatus is tolerated.

Finally, the case of &quot;-s&quot; and &quot;-x&quot; pronounced in liaison is explained differently. One must be aware, firstly, that word-final &quot;-x&quot; is a medieval shorthand for &quot;-us&quot; (in Old French people wrote &quot;chevax&quot; for &quot;chevaus&quot;, later written &quot;chevaux&quot; when the idea behind this &quot;-x&quot; was forgotten) (except in words like &quot;voix&quot; and &quot;noix&quot; where &#x27;s&#x27; was changed to &#x27;x&#x27; by restoration of Latin usage (&quot;vox&quot; and &quot;nux&quot;)). The sound noted &quot;-s&quot; and &quot;-x&quot; was a hard , which did not remain in French after the twelfth century (it can be found in words like &quot;(tu) chantes or &quot;doux), but which was protected from complete elision when the following word began with a vowel (which effectively means, when it was found between two vowels). However, in French, such is voiced and becomes (which explains why, in words like &quot;rose&quot; and &quot;mise&quot;, the &quot;s&quot; is pronounced and not ).

====Note====
If the final &quot;-t&quot; of &quot;grant was kept in the Middle Ages in spite of the disappearance of the corresponding , it is because there existed, along with this form, others like &quot;grants (rather written &quot;granz&quot;), wherein the was heard, protected from elision by the following . The ancient orthography rendered this alternation visible before another one replaced it (the one with &quot;d&quot;). Indeed, it would be false to state that the orthography of Old French did not follow usage, or that it was without rules.

==Fluctuating usages==
From the sixteenth century onward, it was common for grammarians who wished to describe the French language or discuss its orthography to write documents in a phonetic alphabet. From some of these documents, we can see that the liaisons have not always been pronounced as they are today.

For example, the &quot;Prayer&quot; by Gilles Vaudelin (a document compiled in 1713 using a phonetic alphabet, and introduced in the &quot;Nouvelle manière d&#x27;écrire comme on parle en France&quot; [&quot;A New Way of Writing as We Speak in France&quot;]), probably representative of oral language, maybe rural, of the time, shows the absence of the following liaisons (Vaudelin&#x27;s phonetic alphabet is transcribed using equivalent IPA):

* &quot;Saint Esprit&quot;: instead of ;
* &quot;tout à Vous glorifier&quot;: ... instead of ;
* &quot;qui êtes aux cieux&quot;: instead of or .

<doc id="1215687" wikidata="Q2898293" url="?curid=1215687" title="Bernard Marcus">
<text>Bernard Marcus (May 12, 1929 – November 4, 2024) was an American billionaire businessman. He co-founded Home Depot in 1978. He was the company&#x27;s first CEO and first chairman until retiring in 2002. In November 2024, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his net worth at US$10.3 billion. He was a major donor to the Republican Party, including Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaigns.

==Early life==
Marcus was born to Russian Jewish immigrant parents, cabinet maker Joe and Sara Marcus, in Newark, New Jersey, on May 12, 1929. He was the youngest of four children and grew up in a tenement. He graduated in 1947 from South Side High School (since renamed as Malcolm X Shabazz High School). Marcus wanted to become a doctor, and was accepted to Harvard Medical School, but could not afford the tuition. He graduated from Rutgers University with a pharmacy degree. He was a member of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity.

==Career==
Marcus initially worked at a drugstore as a pharmacist but later moved to the retailing side of the business. He worked at a cosmetics company and various other retail jobs. He worked for Odell Inc. in California beginning in 1968 and then joined Daylin in Los Angeles in 1970. He became the CEO of Handy Dan Improvement Centers, a Los Angeles-based chain of home improvement stores. In April 1978, he and future Home Depot co-founder Arthur Blank were fired during a corporate power struggle at Handy Dan.

In 1978, they co-founded the home-improvement retailer Home Depot, with the help of merchandising expert Pat Farrah and New York investment banker Ken Langone who assembled a group of investors. The first two stores opened on June 22, 1979, in Atlanta.

Marcus served as the company&#x27;s first CEO until May 1997 and also served as chairman of the board until his retirement on May 31, 2002. He was succeeded as CEO by Blank, who served until December 2000. Marcus was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 2006.

Marcus was one of several business tycoons who opposed the Employee Free Choice Act, a proposal they claimed gave unfair advantage to labor unions. The EFCA would outlaw conducting employee union votes with secret ballots while allowing fines and injunctions when employees show they are being punished for union activity on the job. 

In 2010, Marcus founded the Job Creators Network, a conservative advocacy group, with $500,000 in seed funding.

==Political activity==
In 2012, Marcus donated $10.7 million to Mitt Romney&#x27;s 2012 presidential campaign, the maximum personal donation one can make, and was the biggest contributor to the campaign. In 2015, Marcus donated $1.5 million to super political action committees, supporting Jeb Bush and Scott Walker.

On June 1, 2016, Marcus publicly announced his support for Republican presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump. He was one of Trump&#x27;s largest donors, giving $7 million to his campaign. When Marcus announced in 2019 that he would financially support the Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign, it triggered calls for a boycott of Home Depot. Together with his spouse, Marcus contributed $731,200 directly to Trump&#x27;s 2020 presidential campaign and $10.7million to political action committees supporting Trump.

In 2023, he donated $2 million to the pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC. In 2023, Marcus announced he would back Trump&#x27;s third consecutive campaign. Job Creators Network, founded by Marcus, backed a lawsuit to overturn federal student loan forgiveness, which became part of the successful Supreme Court case &quot;Biden v. Nebraska&quot;.

==Philanthropy==
Marcus was a longtime philanthropist who made plans to give away 90% of his $5.9 billion fortune to charity. Bernie and Billi Marcus were signatories of The Giving Pledge, a commitment to give away the majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes. 

By 2019, Bernard Marcus had given away $2 billion to various philanthropic causes and pledged to give away most of his fortune, which had doubled to $9.8 billion in 2024. The previous year, Marcus was recognized as one of the Top 10 individuals who gave or pledged the most to charity in the United States. He was one of the first signees of the Jewish Future Promise, a charitable campaign launched in 2020 modeled after The Giving Pledge to encourage American Jews to designate at least 50% of their charitable giving to Jewish or Israel-related causes.

Marcus was the chairman of the Marcus Foundation, whose focuses include children, medical research, free enterprise, military veterans, Jewish causes, and the community. Marcus was on the Board of Directors and an active volunteer for the Shepherd Center. One of his main initiatives was providing care for war veterans with traumatic brain injuries. In May 2005, Marcus was awarded the Others Award by The Salvation Army, their highest honor.

He was named a Georgia Trustee in 2009. The award is given by the Georgia Historical Society, in conjunction with the Governor of Georgia, to individuals whose accomplishments and community service reflect the ideals of the founding body of Trustees, which governed the Georgia colony from 1732 to 1752. In 2012, Marcus was awarded the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership.

===Jewish and Israeli causes===
Marcus co-founded the Israel Democracy Institute in 1991, contributing $5 million for the construction of the institute&#x27;s building in Jerusalem&#x27;s Talbiya neighborhood and investing hundreds of millions of shekels in its ongoing operation over the years. In 2016, Marcus and his wife Billi donated $25 million to the construction of the $133 million MDA Marcus National Blood Services Centre in Israel.

===Georgia Aquarium===
Bernard Marcus heavily contributed to the launch of Georgia Aquarium, which opened in downtown Atlanta in 2005 based mostly on the $250 million donation for the aquarium.

===Medical research===
Marcus funded and founded The Marcus Institute, a center for the provision of services for children and adolescents with developmental disabilities. Marcus founded and donated $25 million to Autism Speaks to spearhead its efforts to raise money for research on the causes and cure for autism. He was an active member of the board of directors.

==Books==
In 1999, Marcus, along with Arthur Blank and Bob Andelman, wrote the book &quot;Built from Scratch: How a Couple of Regular Guys Grew The Home Depot from Nothing to $30 Billion&quot;. Marcus, with Catherine Lewis, wrote a book titled &quot;Kick Up Some Dust: Lessons on Thinking, Giving Back and Doing It Yourself&quot;. The book debuted at The Book Festival of the Marcus Jewish Community Center of Atlanta on November 6, 2022.

==Personal life and death==
Marcus was married twice. He had two children with his first wife, Ruth (, div. 1972, died 2023): Frederick, a professor at Emory University, and Susanne (1956–2021), a musician, music manager and philanthropist. She ran her own charity, The Susanne Marcus Collins Foundation. Bernard had a stepson, Michael Morris, the owner and publisher of &quot;The Atlanta Jewish Times&quot;, from his second wife, philanthropist Billi Morris (m. 1973). He had 7 grandchildren.

Marcus lived in Atlanta in 2006. He died from natural causes at his home in Boca Raton, Florida on November 4, 2024, at age 95.

<doc id="1215692" wikidata="Q1871848" url="?curid=1215692" title="Kirby Super Star">
<text>Kirby Super Star, released as Kirby&#x27;s Fun Pak in PAL regions, is a 1996 anthology action-platform game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is part of the &quot;Kirby&quot; series of video games by HAL Laboratory. The game was advertised as a compilation featuring eight games: seven short subsections with the same basic gameplay, and two minigames.

An enhanced remake titled &quot;Kirby Super Star Ultra&quot; was released for the Nintendo DS in 2008 and 2009 to commercial and critical success, selling just under 3 million copies. The original game has also been digitally rereleased multiple times.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Kirby Super Star&quot; is a side-scrolling platform game. Similar to previous entries in the &quot;Kirby&quot; series, the player controls the titular character Kirby to complete various levels while avoiding obstacles and enemies. Kirby can walk or run, jump, swim, crouch, slide, and inhale enemies or objects to spit them out as bullets. He can fly for a limited time by inflating himself; while flying, Kirby cannot attack or use his other abilities, though he can release a weak puff of air. By eating certain enemies, Kirby can gain copy abilities, power-ups allowing him to take on the properties the enemy possessed. In &quot;Kirby Super Star&quot;, Kirby gains the ability to guard so he can defend himself from weak attacks.

If Kirby uses a copy ability, he can produce a Helper, a character that can be controlled automatically or by another player. Like Kirby, Helpers can float continuously, but can only use the copy ability they were based on. The player can also grant the Helper a different form or revert them into a power-up in an emergency. The player characters lose health if they are hit by enemies or hazards. If the Helper loses all their health, there is a short time for Kirby to grant it a new power before it disappears. If Kirby loses all of his health, the player will lose a life. Health can be replenished by eating food scattered across levels. Losing all lives results in a game over.

===Game modes===
&quot;Kirby Super Star&quot; is split into seven smaller games, six primary and one supplemental, in addition to two minigames. While most retain the same game mechanics, they have different stories and objectives. Some games must be unlocked by playing others, and all must be finished to complete the game.

* Spring Breeze: an abridged remake of the first &quot;Kirby&quot; game, &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; (1992), with the gameplay enhancements of &quot;Kirby Super Star&quot;. King Dedede has stolen food from the citizens of Dream Land, and Kirby must make reach the King&#x27;s castle to challenge him. Several levels from the original have been merged, while some boss fights were cut.
* Dyna Blade: Kirby must stop Dyna Blade, a giant bird, from disturbing Dream Land&#x27;s crops. The mode consists of four levels that the player must clear before facing off against Dyna Blade. There are also two secret areas and a mini-boss that moves across the world map.
* Gourmet Race: a racing game in which Kirby races King Dedede while eating as much food as possible. It takes place across three levels of varying length. Players earn points from eating food and bonus points for finishing first in a race; whoever earns the most points by the end of all levels wins. Players can choose to race either King Dedede or a &quot;ghost&quot; (the player&#x27;s best attempt at the race), or simply race alone for the fastest time.
* The Great Cave Offensive: a Metroidvania adventure that sees Kirby explore a cave that he has fallen into for treasure. Sixty treasure chests are hidden across four areas. Some treasures reference other Nintendo franchises, such as the Triforce (&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;), Captain Falcon&#x27;s helmet (&quot;F-Zero&quot;), and Mr. Saturn (&quot;EarthBound&quot;); others reference valuable items that appear in role-playing video games, such as Orichalcum.
* Revenge of Meta Knight: a story-driven mode chronicling Kirby&#x27;s efforts to stop Meta Knight, who attempts to take over Dream Land and end the inhabitants&#x27; &quot;lazy&quot; lifestyle by invading in his signature airship, the &quot;Halberd&quot;. Each level has a time limit, and Kirby will lose a life if the player does not finish in time. The &quot;Halberd&quot; takes damage after every level, and a meter at the bottom of the screen shows the ship&#x27;s status. The player fights numerous bosses, and the mode culminates in a chase to escape the falling &quot;Halberd&quot;.
* Milky Way Wishes: the largest mode in the game. Because the Sun and Moon around planet Popstar are fighting, a jester-like creature named Marx tells Kirby he must travel across nine planets and restore the giant wish-granting comet-clock Nova. In the end, Marx—who masterminded the conflict—wishes to Nova to control Popstar, but Kirby stops him. Unlike the other modes, Kirby cannot use copy abilities; instead, he collects &quot;Copy Essence Deluxes&quot;. Once in Kirby&#x27;s possession, they allow the player to select a copy ability from a list and are kept permanently. The mode also features scrolling shooter levels.
* The Arena: a boss attack mode that challenges the player to fight every boss in the game with only one life and a free selection of power-up at the start of the game. The player can replenish their health up to five times total between rounds, and are granted two power-ups at random. Completing &quot;The Arena&quot; unlocks a sound test.
* Sub-games: two minigames that can be played single-player or multiplayer. They include &quot;Samurai Kirby&quot;, in which the player must be the first to press a button after a prompt, similar to &quot;Wild Gunman&quot; (1984); and &quot;Megaton Punch&quot;, in which the player must accurately time three button presses to throw a stronger punch than their opponent.

==Development==

&quot;Kirby Super Star&quot; was developed in Japan by HAL Laboratory and directed by Kirby creator Masahiro Sakurai. It was the third &quot;Kirby&quot; game he directed, following &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; and &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot;. Although a Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) title, the &quot;Kirby Super Star&quot; prototype was developed for the original Nintendo Entertainment System. According to Sakurai, although the prototype was for internal use only, it was almost complete and some of Kirby&#x27;s animations were nearly identical in the final game. The prototype was used to test out ideas before implementing them in the final product; Sakurai said having the game operating on an internal build made it easier to develop ideas. HAL president Satoru Iwata had little involvement with the game, and left development under Sakurai&#x27;s supervision.

For &quot;Kirby Super Star&quot;, Sakurai &quot;had three pillars in mind. One was two-player cooperative gameplay and another was including actions similar to those in fighting games. The third was an omnibus format.&quot; The addition of cooperative gameplay was something Shigeru Miyamoto requested. While Sakurai knew a SNES &quot;Kirby&quot; game would mean bigger, more detailed characters and graphics, he wanted to hear from Miyamoto before thinking about the foundation and other important aspects. Sakurai and Iwata traveled to Kyoto; there, Miyamoto told them he wanted cooperative gameplay, something uncommon in side-scrolling platform games. Miyamoto had dreamed of creating a cooperative game in his &quot;Super Mario&quot; franchise for many years, but was unable to until &quot;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&quot; in 2009 because of how fast the series&#x27; gameplay is. &quot;Kirby&quot;, on the other hand, is slower-paced, so Miyamoto figured it would be possible. Sakurai thought about it and came up with the idea to have a main player and an assisting one; this led to the conception of Helpers, which he thought opened the door for inexperienced players.

 As for including fighting game-like moves, Sakurai made enemies stronger. He did this because &quot;[t]he main player would simply hurl blades and lay waste to opponents while the Helper just watched.&quot; Additionally, he expanded copy abilities&#x27; possibilities so players could perform multiple actions by pressing the same button, similar to fighting games. The game was also the first in the series in which Kirby&#x27;s appearance changed depending on his copy ability. The omnibus format was chosen because Sakurai noted most SNES and some NES games were of considerable length, and prices were high. &quot;Kirby Super Star&quot; served as &quot;the antithesis to that trend,&quot; with Sakurai hoping to create sections with different stories and gameplay that appealed to both experienced and inexperienced players. &quot;Spring Breeze&quot;, a remake of &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot;, was designed for beginners and is thus &quot;Super Star&quot; first mode. The title is a quote from the &quot;Dream Land&quot; manual that &quot;describe[s] Kirby as a youth who came with the spring breeze,&quot; and was chosen to signify its simplicity. Originally, Sakurai was going to remove copy abilities to remain faithful to the original game while teaching beginners how to play, but ultimately did not.

Development lasted three years, longer than usual for the era. This was partially due to the influence of Rare&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; (1994), a game that incorporated computer-generated (CG) graphics. Sakurai was certain using CG would be beneficial, so the team redid the artwork about halfway through development. HAL&#x27;s development schedule also lengthened development. Sakurai planned to include an additional game mode, &quot;Kagero Mansion&quot;, which was discarded due to time constraints. &quot;Kagero Mansion&quot; was a horror game with an emphasis on action and puzzle elements; it saw Kirby stuck in a mansion and unable to inhale. HAL also planned to add a move that allowed Kirby to create an explosion from guarding, but cut the idea. The game&#x27;s working title was &quot;Kirby of the Stars: Active&quot;, which &quot;suggest[ed] that the game was more proactive and had more active gameplay.&quot; &quot;Mother&quot; series creator Shigesato Itoi came up with the final title, which Sakurai said &quot;convey[s] how rich it is in content&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Kirby Super Star&quot; was one of the last SNES games, released just three months before the launch of the system&#x27;s successor, the Nintendo 64. Publisher Nintendo released the game in Japan on March 21, 1996, in North America on September 20, 1996, and in Europe on January 23, 1997. In Japan, the title is &quot;Kirby of the Stars: Super Deluxe&quot;, while in Europe, it is &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Fun Pak&quot;. The Japanese packaging was designed to resemble a Paulownia wooden box, an idea that originated from Itoi. In Japan, expensive sake and silverware is often sold in Paulownia boxes; the team thought the packaging would convey that the game was special. While noting that it seems unrelated to the game, Sakurai commented that this cover illustrated the heart of &quot;Kirby Super Star&quot; and praised Itoi&#x27;s idea.

&quot;Kirby Super Star&quot; was rereleased on the Wii and Wii U via Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console digital distribution service. The Wii version was released in Japan in October 2009 and in the West in May 2010, and the Wii U version was released worldwide in May 2013. The game was also included in &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Collection&quot; (2012), a 20th anniversary compilation of &quot;Kirby&quot; titles for the Wii. &quot;Kirby Super Star&quot; is also included in the &quot;Super NES Classic Edition&quot;. Nintendo released the game on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System app via its Nintendo Switch Online subscription service on December 12, 2019. A special version with the secret modes unlocked was later released on June 9, 2022.
==Reception==

&quot;Kirby Super Star&quot; was both a critical and commercial success, selling over one million copies in Japan. It received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings, and is widely regarded as one of the best games of the franchise. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; applauded the large amount of content, simultaneous two-player mode, graphics, and Kirby&#x27;s power-absorbing ability. Captain Cameron of &quot;GamePro&quot; gave it a perfect 5 out of 5 in sound, control, and FunFactor, and a 4.5 out of 5 in graphics. He commented that &quot;The perfect execution of the varied controls leads to simple-but-charming fun.&quot; Reviewing the Virtual Console release, &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; praised the &quot;impressive&quot; musical score and &quot;colorful&quot; visuals.

===Accolades===
&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; named &quot;Kirby Super Star&quot; a runner-up for Side-Scrolling Game of the Year (behind &quot;Guardian Heroes&quot;). &quot;Gamesradar&quot; ranked the game at number 19 in their &quot;The Best SNES Game of All Time.&quot; In 2018, &quot;Complex&quot; listed Kirby Super Star number 51 in its &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; rated Kirby Super Star 47th on their &quot;Top 100 SNES Games.&quot; They praised the game calling it an incredible game and having incredible value.

==Legacy==

&quot;Kirby Super Star&quot; was given an enhanced remake in the form of &quot;Kirby Super Star Ultra&quot; to celebrate the series&#x27; 15th anniversary. The remake features four new modes, three new minigames, and multiple additions to the base game including new sub-bosses and enemies. The remake was released in North America on September 22, 2008, to critical and commercial success, selling just under three million copies worldwide.

Many of the music tracks in &quot;Kirby Super Star&quot; have been remixed in various games, such as the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series; the Nintendo 64 game, for instance, had a new version of the Gourmet Race theme as Kirby&#x27;s theme song.

Meta Knight&#x27;s battleship, the &quot;Halberd&quot;, would reappear in several games such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Epic Yarn&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.

A stage based on &quot;The Great Cave Offensive&quot; appears in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Wii U&quot;. In reference to the scope of the mode of the same name, the arena is amongst the largest stages in the game&#x27;s catalog, and thus supports up to eight players. It features a unique mechanic dubbed the &quot;Danger Zones&quot;, stage hazards that instantly KO any fighter whose damage percentages exceed 100%. The stage was also included in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;.

In 2021, Charlie Rosen and Jake Silverman arranged the composition &quot;Meta Knight&#x27;s Revenge&quot; for the 8-Bit Big Band. Their cover was subsequently nominated for and won the Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella.

<doc id="1215697" wikidata="Q7094932" url="?curid=1215697" title="Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance">
<text>The Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance (OUSA) is an alliance of students&#x27; unions in Ontario, Canada. Their common objective is to protect the interests of over 160,000 professional and undergraduate, full-time and part-time university students, and to provide research and recommendations to the government on how to improve accessibility, affordability, accountability, and quality of post-secondary education in Ontario.

==History==
The initial catalyst for the creation of OUSA was disagreement over the position of the provincial and national student association in Ontario on the first Gulf War. In 1992, The student associations of Brock University, Queen&#x27;s University, the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University, and the Association of Part-Time Undergraduate Students at the University of Toronto approached the Ontario Federation of Students(OFS) to host a roundtable discussing the prospect of pushing for an increase in tuition fees. When this idea was rejected, the roundtable occurred informally and resulted in the formal incorporation and creation of OUSA.

Part-time students at the University of Toronto withdrew from the Alliance, as did Queen&#x27;s Alma Mater Society, citing concerns over the organization&#x27;s management in the mid-1990s. Queen&#x27;s then rejoined the Alliance as an associate member in 2001 and then as a full member in 2004. In May 2011, OUSA welcomed two new members, the Trent in Oshawa Student Association (later the Trent Durham Student Association) as associate members, and the McMaster Association of Part-Time Students as full members, who had rejoined after a 7-year absence. In May 2013, the University of Windsor Students&#x27; Alliance voted, through a referendum, to leave the Alliance. On April 29, 2014, the McMaster Association of Part-Time Students also withdrew from membership in OUSA.

The Students&#x27; General Association (SGA-AGÉ) of Laurentian University was admitted into OUSA in April 2016, with membership taking effect May 2016. Most recently, the Ontario Tech Student Union (OTSU) joined OUSA as a full member in April 2023.

==Members==
As of 2023, OUSA&#x27;s membership consists of:
*Trent Durham Student Association
*Laurentian University Students&#x27; General Association/Association Générale des Étudiants
*Wilfrid Laurier University Students&#x27; Union
*McMaster Students Union
*Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association
*Brock University Students&#x27; Union
*University Students&#x27; Council of Western University
*Alma Mater Society of Queen&#x27;s University
*Ontario Tech Student Union

==Steering Committee==
OUSA&#x27;s Steering Committee is the body responsible for setting and monitoring the organization&#x27;s priorities and strategic initiatives. It is also the non-profit organization&#x27;s board of directors. One executive member of each constituent student union sits on the board as a voting member. According to the organization&#x27;s Bylaws, each association is entitled to appoint one additional non-voting resource member to OUSA&#x27;s Steering Committee. Alma Mater Society of Queen&#x27;s University is the only OUSA member in recent years that regularly uses this provision to appoint an additional member.

Due to its moderate leanings when compared with other student advocacy groups and close working relationship with many decision makers, OUSA has faced criticism that they are too cooperative with the government. OUSA has also received criticism for a mid 1990s proposal that asked for increased government spending towards universities along with increased tuition fees, however this recommendation was reversed a few years later, and OUSA has called for tuition freezes and decreases since at least 1999.

<doc id="1215711" wikidata="Q1284408" url="?curid=1215711" title="Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso">
<text>The Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso () (PUCV), also known as Universidad Católica de Valparaíso (UCV), is one of six Catholic universities in Chile and one of the two pontifical universities in the country, along with the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. Founded in 1928, it is located in Valparaíso Region and has about 18,000 students.

It is recognized in Chile as an institution with high academic prestige and as a research university due to its acquired research funds and offered postgraduate degrees in the fields of science, engineering, humanities and arts. As a Catholic university, it answers directly to the Holy See and the Bishopric of Valparaíso. The PUCV is a traditional university and one of the twenty-five institutions within the Chilean Rectors&#x27; Council (&quot;Consejo de Rectores&quot;). Although it is not state-owned, a substantial part of its budget is given by state transfers under different programs.

PUCV is an urban university. It has a central campus known as &quot;Casa Central&quot; (Central House) located in downtown Valparaíso, only a few blocks away from the Chilean Congress, the Metro, and the Pacific Ocean. One of the drawbacks of being an urban university is the difficulty of growing at the original site of its foundation, close to the city center. Hence, while some PUCV buildings are on the historic palm-tree-lined Avenida Brasil, several of its schools are dispersed throughout Valparaíso, Viña del Mar, Quilpué and Quillota.

At the 2019 edition of the &quot;América Economía&quot; magazine university ranking, the university was positioned 4th nationwide and the QS Latin America University Ranking of 2023 has placed it 22nd out of 428 qualifying institutions (and 5th nationwide). The university is accredited for seven years, the maximum number of years awarded by the National Accreditation Commission, for the period between 2021 and 2028. The PUCV, the University of Chile, the Catholic University, the University of Santiago and the University of Concepción are the only institutions in Chile that have received the highest number of years in accreditation. 

PUCV attracts students from different regions of Chile, as well as hundreds of exchange students from Europe, North America and several countries from South America, due to its student exchange programs.

==Profile==
The PUCV offers undergraduate degrees subjects including architecture, design, horticulture, industrial engineering, business, law, accounting and finance and Spanish.

The school of architecture, also called &quot;The Valparaíso School&quot;, constructed an experimental city called the Open City, a few kilometers North of Valparaíso, where the professors teach and live in the houses that they and the students design and build. Similarly, in the Quillota campus the program in horticulture is offered within an experimental station. This campus is visited by more than 1,500 people each year, and has collections of subtropical and temperate fruit trees, and a nursery. The station of 500,000 square metres has more than 50,000 square metres of greenhouses.

The diversity of the PUCV is one of its strengths, with a rainbow trout farm near Los Andes, a legislative consultancy group (CEAL), a farm in Quillota with an area of 6 km2, a fruit packing house specialized in avocados and citrus fruits (joint venture with Exportadora Santa Cruz), a TV station, that has been on the air since 1957 (the first in the country), a radio station, a publishing house, and an experimental grade school and high school for boys in Viña del Mar. All of these units welcome interns and scholars, both from PUCV and other universities.

The PUCV houses the editorial offices of journals in marine biology, law, religion, philosophy, psychology, and biotechnology. Explora, a special government program to promote science in primary and secondary schools, is also hosted by the PUCV.

==History==
It was founded in March 1928, supported by the generous contribution of Isabel Caces de Brown. Even older, the Law School was established in 1894 as an independent college by the Sacred Heart Fathers, and was later incorporated into the university (since both were units of the Roman Catholic Church). The first undergraduate majors offered by the PUCV were electrical engineering, construction, chemistry, mining, business administration, mechanical engineering, decorative arts, and merchant marine studies.

The Pontifical title was conferred by Pope John Paul II and announced at the inauguration of the 2003 academic year by Zenon Grocholewski, Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for Catholic Education.

==Administration==

PUCV is a private institution dependent upon the Roman Catholic Church. As some other old private universities in Chile, PUCV receives some funding from the Chilean government. PUCV&#x27;s Grand Chancellor is the Bishop of Valparaíso, who appoints representatives in the Academic Council but does not directly run the university (responsibility of a faculty-elected Rector). The Council includes the Deans of each faculty, all of whom are elected by the faculty.

The appointment of PUCV officers and structural changes in its administration need the approval of the Holy See, with periodic reviews by the Congregation for Catholic Education of the Roman Curia. Doctoral honoris causa degrees need to be approved by the Congregation.

==Faculties and undergraduate programs==
Currently, PUCV has 62 undergraduate programs, 19 doctorate programs, 39 master programs and 82 other postgraduate programs.

The list of institutions includes some of the oldest universities in the world, such as Université catholique de Louvain (founded in 1425 by Pope Martin V), Università di Pisa (founded in 1343 by Pope Clement VI) and Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg.

<text>Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan (, ) (&quot;fl.&quot; 16th century) was a Malayalam devotional poet, translator and linguist. He was one of the prāchīna kavithrayam (old triad) of Malayalam literature, the other two being Kunchan Nambiar and Cherusseri. He has been called the &quot;Father of Modern Malayalam Literature&quot;, and the &quot;Primal Poet in Malayalam&quot;. He was one of the pioneers of a major shift in Kerala&#x27;s literary culture (the domesticated religious textuality associated with the Bhakti movement). His work is published and read far more than that of any of his contemporaries or predecessors in Kerala.

He was born in a place called Thunchaththu in present-day Tirur in the Malappuram district of northern Kerala, in a traditional Hindu family. Little is known with certainty about his life. He was not from a brahmin community and for long brahmins of kerala was reluctant to accept him.His success even in his own lifetime seems to have been great.&quot;&quot; Later he and his followers shifted to a village near Palakkad, further east into the Kerala, and established a hermitage (the &quot;Ramananda ashrama&quot;) and a Brahmin village there. This institution probably housed both Brahmin and Sudra literary students. The school eventually pioneered the &quot;Ezhuthachan movement&quot;, associated with the concept of popular Bhakti, in Kerala. Ezhuthachan&#x27;s ideas have been variously linked by scholars either with philosopher Ramananda, who found the Ramanandi sect, or Ramanuja, the single most influential thinker of devotional Hinduism.

For centuries before Ezhuthachan, Kerala people had been producing literary texts in Malayalam and in the Grantha script. However, he is celebrated as the &quot;Primal Poet&quot; or the &quot;Father of Malayalam Proper&quot; for his Malayalam recomposition of the Sanskrit epic &quot;Ramayana.&quot; This work rapidly circulated around Kerala middle-caste homes as a popular devotional text. It can be said that Ezhuthachan brought the then unknown Sanskrit-Puranic literature to the level of common understanding (domesticated religious textuality). His other major contribution has been in mainstreaming the current Malayalam alphabet.

== Sources ==
The first Western scholar to take an interest in Ezhuthachan was Arthur C. Burnell (1871).

The following two texts are the standard sources on Ezhuthachan.

* &quot;Eluttaccan and His Age&quot; (1940) by C. Achyuta Menon (Madras: University of Madras).
* &quot;Adhyatma Ramayanam&quot; (1969) edited by A. D. Harisharma (Kottayam: Sahitya Pravarthaka Co-operative).

=== Historical Ezhuthachan ===
There is no completely firm historical evidence for Ezhuthachan the author.

Main historical sources of Ezhuthachan and his life are

* Quasi-historical verses referring to Ezhuthachan (from Chittur Madhom).
* An institutional line of masters or gurus, beginning with one Thunchaththu Sri Guru, is mentioned in one oral verse from Chittur Madhom. This lineage can be historically verified.
* An inscription giving the details of the founding of the residence (agraharam), hermitage (mathom), and temples in Chittur. This was under the direction of Suryanarayanan Ezhuthachan (with support of the local chieftain). This locale can be historically verified.

== Period ==

Ezhuthachan is generally believed to have lived around the sixteenth or seventeenth century.

* Arthur C. Burnell (1871) dates Ezhuthachan to seventeenth century. He discovered the date from a title deed (found in a manuscript collection preserved in Chittur). The deed relates to the date of the founding of the Gurumadhom of Chittur.
* William Logan (1887) dates Ezuthachan to the seventeenth century (he supports the dates given by Burnell).
* Hermann Gundert dates Ezuthachan to the seventeenth century.
* Kovunni Nedungadi dates Ezuthachan to the fifteenth century. 
* Govinda Pillai dates Ezuthachan to the fifteenth or sixteenth century. He cites the Kali chronogram &#x27;ayurarogyaa saukhyam&#x27; that appears at end of the Narayaneeyam of Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri (a possible senior contemporary of Ezhuthachan).
* A. R. Kattayattu Govindra Menon cites the Kali chronogram &#x27;pavitramparam saukhyam&#x27; as a reference to the date of Ezuthachan &#x27;s samadhi. 
* Chittur Gurumadhom authorities also cites the chronogram &#x27;pavitramparam saukhyam&#x27; as a reference to the date of Ezuthachan &#x27;s samadhi. The word &#x27;surya&#x27; is sometimes suffixed to the chronogram.
* R. Narayana Panikkar supports Govinda Pillai&#x27;s date (the fifteenth or sixteenth century). The date is based on Ezhuthachan&#x27;s contemporaneity with Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri (whom he dates to c. 1531 – c. 1637 AD). He also mentions certain Nilakantan &quot;Nambudiri &quot;, a possible senior contemporary of Ezhuthachan (fl. c. 1565 and c. 1601 AD).
* P. K. Narayana Pillai cites a Kali chronogram &#x27;nakasyanyunasaukhyam&#x27; or 1555 AD (from a verse relating to the founding of the matham of Chittur) on the date of Ezhuthachan. He dates Nilakanthan, the possible master of Ezhuthachan, to c. 1502 AD.
* Poet-turned-historian Ulloor S. Parameshwara Iyer has argued that Ezhuthachan was born in 1495 AD and lived up to 1575 AD
* A time frame similar to Ulloor was proposed by scholar C. Radhakrishnan.
* Scholar Sheldon Pollock dates Ezuthachan to the sixteenth century.
* Rich Freeman dates Ezhuthachan to late sixteenth-early seventeenth century.

== Life and career ==


=== Biography ===
Little is known with certainty about Ezhuthachan&#x27;s life.

Ezhuthachan was born at Trikkandiyoor, near the modern-day town of Tirur, in northern Kerala. It is known that his lineage home was &quot;Thunchaththu&quot;. His parents&#x27; names are not known, and there are disputes about his given name as well. The name Ezhuthachan, meaning Father of Letters, was a generic title for any village schoolteacher in premodern Kerala.

As a boy he seems to have exhibited uncommon intelligence. He was probably educated by his elder brother (early in his life). After his early education he is believed to have travelled in the other parts of India (outside Kerala) and learned Sanskrit and some other Dravidian languages.

It is believed that Ezhuthachan on his way back from Tamil Nadu had a stopover at Chittur (in Palakkad) and in due course settled down at Thekke Gramam near Anikkode with his disciples. A hermitage (the &quot;Ramananda ashrama&quot;) and a Brahmin residence (agraharam), at a site now known as the Chittur Gurumadhom, were established by him (on a piece of land bought from the landlord of Chittur). The institution was flanked by temples of gods Rama and Siva. It probably housed both Brahmin and Sudra students. The street still has an array of agraharas (where the twelve Brahmin families migrated along with Ezhuthachan live).

Ezhuthachan was eventually associated with an institutional line of masters (gurus). The locale and lineage of these masters can be historically verified. He and his disciples seem to have ignited a whole new literary movement in Kerala. Its style and content nearly overshadowed the earlier Sanskrit poetry. He is believed to have attained samadhi at the Gurumadhom at Chittur. A verse chanted by the ascetics of the mathom during their daily prayers makes a reference to the following line of masters.

* Thunchaththu Sri Guru
* Sri Karunakaran
* Sri Suryanarayanan
* Sri Deva Guru
* Sri Gopala Guru

== Myths and legends ==
* Legends consider Ezhuthachan as a &quot;gandharva&quot; (divine being) who in his previous birth was a witness to the Great War in the Mahabharata.
* As a young boy Ezhuthachan corrected the Brahmins at Trikkandiyoor Temple.
* The Brahmins grew uneasy and gave the boy some plantains to eat, and as a resulting inebriety the boy lost his speech. To counteract this Ezhuthachan&#x27;s father gave him palm beverage and the boy had his speech restored. Ezhuthachan remained addicted to intoxicants.
* Saraswati, the Goddess of Learning and Arts, is believed to have helped him to complete the Devi Mahatmya.
* Ezhuthachan is credited with endowing a monkey with the gift of speech.
* It is believed that the Raja of Ambalappuzha requested him to decipher a Telugu manuscript on Adhyatma Ramayanam.
* It is also said that Ezhuthachan had a young daughter, who copied his works for the first time.
* Ezhuthachan or his follower Suryanarayanan predicted the downfall of zamorin&#x27;s family (the then rulers of Kozhikode). And the zamorin sought his help to perform a Sakteya Puja.
* It is said that Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri sought the advice of Ezhuthachan on how to start his &quot;Narayaneeyam&quot;.

== Contributions ==

Ezhuthachan—although he lived around sixteenth century AD—has been called the &quot;father of modern Malayalam&quot;, or, alternatively, the &quot;father of Malayalam literature&quot;. His success even in his own lifetime seems to have been great.&quot;&quot; No original compositions are attributed to Ezhuthachan.&quot;&quot; His main works generally are based on Sanskrit compositions.&quot;&quot; Linguists are unanimous in assigning Adhyatma Ramayanam and Sri Mahabharatam to Ezhuthachan. The Ramayanam—the most popular work—depicts the hero, Rama, an ideal figure both as man and god.&quot;&quot; Sri Mahabharatam omits all episodes not strictly relevant to the story of the Pandavas and is generally considered as a work of greater literary merit than the Ramayanam. However, there is no unanimity among the scholars about the authorship of certain other works generally ascribed to him. These include the Brahmanda Puranam, Uttara Ramayanam, Devi Mahatmyam, and Harinama Kirtanam.

Ezhuthachan&#x27;s other major contribution has been in mainstreaming (the current) Malayalam alphabet (derived chiefly from the Sanskrit Grantha, or the Arya Script) as the replacement for the old Vattezhuthu (the then-30-letter script of Malayalam). The Arya script permitted the free use of Sanskrit in Malayalam writing.

=== Ezhuthachan movement ===

Ezhuthachan introduced a movement of domesticated religious textuality in Kerala. He was a significant voice of the Bhakti movement in south India. The Bhakti movement was a collective opposition to Brahmanical excesses and the moral and political decadence of the then-Kerala society. The shift of literary production in Kerala to a largely Sanskritic, puranic religiosity is attributed this movement. Ezhuthachan&#x27;s school promoted popular and non-Brahman (Bhakti) literary production. His works were also a general opposition against the moral decadence of the 16th century Kerala society.

== &quot;Father of Modern Malayalam&quot; ==
The Middle Malayalam (&quot;Madhyakaala Malayalam&quot;) was succeeded by Modern Malayalam (&quot;Aadhunika Malayalam&quot;) by 15th century CE. The poem &quot;Krishnagatha&quot; written by Cherusseri Namboothiri, who was the court poet of the king Udaya Varman Kolathiri (1446 – 1475) of Kolathunadu, is written in modern Malayalam. The language used in &quot;Krishnagatha&quot; is the modern spoken form of Malayalam. During the 16th century CE, Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan from the Kingdom of Tanur and Poonthanam Nambudiri from the Kingdom of Valluvanad followed the new trend initiated by Cherussery in their poems. The &quot;Adhyathmaramayanam Kilippattu&quot; and &quot;Mahabharatham Kilippattu&quot; written by Ezhuthachan and &quot;Jnanappana&quot; written by Poonthanam are also included in the earliest form of Modern Malayalam. 
It is Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan who is also credited with the development of Malayalam script into the current form through the intermixing and modification of the erstwhile scripts of &quot;Vatteluttu&quot;, &quot;Kolezhuthu&quot;, and Grantha script, which were used to write the inscriptions and literary works of Old and Middle Malayalam. He further eliminated excess and unnecessary letters from the modified script. Hence, Ezhuthachan is also known as &quot;The Father of modern Malayalam&quot;. The development of modern Malayalam script was also heavily influenced by the Tigalari script, which was used to write the Tulu language, due to the influence of Tuluva Brahmins in Kerala. The language used in the Arabi Malayalam works of 16th-17th century CE is a mixture of Modern Malayalam and Arabic. They follow the syntax of modern Malayalam, though written in a modified form of Arabic script, which is known as Arabi Malayalam script.

P. Shungunny Menon ascribes the authorship of the medieval work &quot;Keralolpathi&quot;, which describes the Parashurama legend and the departure of the final Cheraman Perumal king to Mecca, to Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan.

== &quot;Adhyatma Ramayanam Kilippattu&quot; ==
&quot;Adhyatma Ramayanam Kilippattu&quot;, written in the parrot-song style, is Ezhuthachan&#x27;s principle work. It is not an adaptation from the original Valmiki &quot;Ramayana&quot;, but a translation of the &quot;Adhyatma Ramayana&quot;, a Sanskrit text connected with the Ramanandi sect. The poem is composed in nearly-modern Malayalam. It depicts Rama, the prince of Ayodhya, as an ideal figure (both as man and god-incarnate, the Bhakti interpretation).&quot;&quot;

The text spread with phenomenal popularity throughout Kerala middle-caste homes as a material for domestic devotional recitation. Throughout the Malayalam month of Karkkidakam, &quot;Adhyatma Ramayanam&quot; is still recited—as a devotional practice—in the middle-caste homes of Kerala.

According to critic K. Ayyappa Panicker, those who see &quot;Adhyatma Ramayanam&quot; merely as a devotional work &quot;belittle&quot; Ezhuthachan.

== Style ==

===Parrot-song style===
* Known in Malayalam as the Kilippattu genre.
* A convention Ezhuthachan adapted from Old Tamil.
* Recited to a poet by a parrot (the frame of the parrot-narrator).
* Thematic focus: epic or Puranic traditions.
* Intended for recitation or singing.
Lexicon and grammar
* Heavily Sanskritic lexicon with many Sanskrit nominal terminations (lexical distinctions between Manipravalam and the Pattu styles are not visible).
* No Sanskrit verbal forms or long compounds.
* Most of the grammatical structures are in Malayalam (the frame of the parrot-narrator and the constituent meters).
* Assembled in an array of Dravidian meters (in simple metrical couplets).
** &quot;Keka&quot; for Bala Kandha and Aranya Kandha
** &quot;Kakali&quot; for Ayodhya, Kishkindha and Yuddha Kandha
** &quot;Kalakanchi&quot; for Sundara Kandha

== Caste ==
Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan&#x27;s caste is arguable. It is only known that he belonged to a lower caste (Shudra or Shudra-grade).&quot;&quot;

The two most popular opinions are Ezhuthachan and Nair, with Kaniyar being less popular.

=== Ezhuthachan ===
Ezhuthachan caste is a socio-economic caste of village school teachers.

According to Arthur C. Burnell, Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan belonged to the Ezhuthachan or &quot;school master&quot; caste. Writer K. Balakrishna Kurup also reports the same, in his book &quot;Viswasathinte Kanappurangal&quot;. E. P. Bhaskara Guptan, a writer and independent researcher of local history from Kadampazhipuram; supports Kurup&#x27;s conclusion. Historian Velayudhan Panikkassery expresses the same opinion.

=== Nair ===
The Chakkala Nair caste had the rights to enter brahmanical temples and to participate in worships.

The Malayalam poet and historian Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer agree that Ezhuthachan belonged to this caste and conclude that he could be Vattekattu Nair because he visited brahmanical temples and engaged in worship, which is not allowed for the Ezuthacan caste.

William Logan, officer of the Madras Civil Service under the English India Company Government, expresses a similar opinion in his &quot;Malabar Manual&quot; and states that Thunchaththu Ezuthachan was &quot;a man of Sudra (Nayar) caste&quot;. Kottarathil Shankunni wrote in his Aithihyamala that the term Ezhuthachan is nothing but a title taken up by school teachers belonging to several castes mainly by Nairs in Northern kerala indicating that Ezhuthachan was a Nair.

=== Kaniyar ===
Some sources consider him to be Kaniyar. This community of traditional astrologers were well versed in Sanskrit and Malayalam. During the medieval period, amongst the non-Brahmin castes which traditionally learnt Sanskrit, the Kaniyar community was involved in Sanskrit learning as part of their craft. They were learned people and had knowledge in astrology, mathematics, mythology and Ayurveda. They were generally assigned as preceptors of martial art and literacy.

In addition to the common title Panicker, the members of Kaniyar from the South Travancore and Malabar region were known as Aasaan, Ezhuthu Aasans, or Ezhuthachans (Father of Letters), by virtue of their traditional avocational function as village school masters to non-Brahmin pupils.

== Legacy ==

The parrot-song genre, pioneered by Ezhuthachan, inaugurated the production of many similar works in Malayalam.

The highest literary honour awarded by the Government of Kerala is known as the &quot;Ezhuthachan Puraskaram&quot;. Sooranad Kunjan Pillai was the first recipient of the honour (1993). The Malayalam University, established by Kerala Government in 2012, is named after Ezhuthachan.

=== Initiation to Letters ===
The sand from the compound where the house of Ezhuthachan stood once is considered as sacred. It is a tradition in north Kerala to practise the art of writing in the beginning on the sand with the first finger.

=== Monuments ===

* Ezhuthachan was born at Trikkandiyoor in northern Kerala. His birthplace is now known as Thunchan Parambu.
* Chittur Gurumadhom is located near present-day Palakkad. The madhom is flanked by temples of gods Rama and Siva. The street has an array of agraharas (where the twelve Brahmin families who migrated along with Ezhuthachan live).
* Ezhuthachan&#x27;s samadhi is also situated at Chittur (in Palakkad).

=== Relics ===

* Some relics of Ezhuthachan or his age were sacredly preserved at the Chittur madhom. This included the original manuscripts and the clogs used by him. These artifacts were destroyed in a fire 30 or 40 years before William Logan. Only the &quot;Bhagavatam&quot; was saved from the fire. 
* Scholar A. C. Burnell examined this &quot;Bhagavatam&quot; (and a stool, clogs and a staff) in the late 19th century. These objects probably belongd to one of the first followers of Ezhuthachan.
* Stool, clog and the staff (seen by Burnell) were destroyed in a second fire. This fire destroyed the original &quot;Bhagavatam&quot; also.
* Copies of a sri chakra and the idols worshipped by Ezhuthachan, the stylus, the wooden slippers, and a few old manuscripts are exhibited for visitors at Chittur madhom.

<doc id="1215732" wikidata="Q1253365" url="?curid=1215732" title="Radiant intensity">
<text>In radiometry, radiant intensity is the radiant flux emitted, reflected, transmitted or received, per unit solid angle, and spectral intensity is the radiant intensity per unit frequency or wavelength, depending on whether the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. These are &quot;directional&quot; quantities. The SI unit of radiant intensity is the watt per steradian (), while that of spectral intensity in frequency is the watt per steradian per hertz () and that of spectral intensity in wavelength is the watt per steradian per metre ()—commonly the watt per steradian per nanometre (). Radiant intensity is distinct from irradiance and radiant exitance, which are often called &quot;intensity&quot; in branches of physics other than radiometry. In radio-frequency engineering, radiant intensity is sometimes called radiation intensity.

==Mathematical definitions==
===Radiant intensity===
Radiant intensity, denoted &quot;I&quot;e,Ω (&quot;e&quot; for &quot;energetic&quot;, to avoid confusion with photometric quantities, and &quot;Ω&quot; to indicate this is a &quot;directional&quot; quantity), is defined as
:formula_1
where
*∂ is the partial derivative symbol;
*Φe is the radiant flux emitted, reflected, transmitted or received;
*&quot;Ω&quot; is the solid angle.

In general, &quot;I&quot;e,Ω is a function of viewing angle &quot;θ&quot; and potentially azimuth angle. For the special case of a Lambertian surface, &quot;I&quot;e,Ω follows the Lambert&#x27;s cosine law &quot;I&quot;e,Ω = &quot;I&quot;0 cos &quot;θ&quot;.

When calculating the radiant intensity emitted by a source, &quot;Ω&quot; refers to the solid angle into which the light is emitted. When calculating radiance received by a detector, &quot;Ω&quot; refers to the solid angle subtended by the source as viewed from that detector.

===Spectral intensity===
Spectral intensity in frequency, denoted &quot;I&quot;e,Ω,ν, is defined as
:formula_2
where &quot;ν&quot; is the frequency.

Spectral intensity in wavelength, denoted &quot;I&quot;e,Ω,λ, is defined as
:formula_3
where &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength.

==Radio-frequency engineering==
Radiant intensity is used to characterize the emission of radiation by an antenna:
:formula_4
where
*&quot;E&quot;e is the irradiance of the antenna;
*&quot;r&quot; is the distance from the antenna.

Unlike power density, radiant intensity does not depend on distance: because radiant intensity is defined as the power through a solid angle, the decreasing power density over distance due to the inverse-square law is offset by the increase in area with distance.

<text>The Department of Social Security (DSS) was a governmental agency in the United Kingdom from 1988 to 2001.

==History==

After the Fowler report, the Department of Health and Social Security separated during 1988 to form two departments, one of which was the DSS. During 2001, the department was largely replaced by the Department for Work and Pensions, with the other responsibilities of the department assumed by the Treasury and the Ministry for Defence.

Beginning in 1989, the Department of Social Security was subdivided into six executive agencies - firstly into the &quot;Resettlement agency&quot;, in 1990 &quot;ITSA&quot; (Information Technology Services Agency), the &quot;Benefits Agency&quot; and &quot;Contributions Agency&quot; in 1991, the &quot;Child Support Agency&quot; in 1993 and the &quot;War Pensions Agency&quot; in 1994.

As part of the UK government&#x27;s spending review (March 1998), a paper &quot;New Ambitions for our Country: A New Contract for Welfare&quot; (1998) announced plans to increase efficiency (&quot;streamline&quot;) in the administration of &quot;benefits&quot; from policy of social welfare, plans subsequently adopted as the &quot;single gateway to benefits&quot;. The Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 brought reforms to the DSS guided by the principle of &quot;work for those that can and security for those that cannot&quot;.

<text>The Caution Horses is the third studio album by the Canadian alt-country band Cowboy Junkies, released in 1990.

The first album following their 1988 breakthrough &quot;The Trinity Session&quot;, &quot;The Caution Horses&quot; features a more conventional, polished sound than the earlier album&#x27;s spare, haunting country blues. As a consequence, the album received average reviews from music critics, who said that the band had sacrificed their distinctive style.

== Reception ==
However, the album&#x27;s accessibility to mainstream pop and rock audiences also meant that it received more radio airplay and spawned bigger chart hits (&quot;Sun Comes Up, It&#x27;s Tuesday Morning&quot; and &quot;Rock and Bird&quot;, which featured Bruce Hornsby on the piano on the single version) than &quot;The Trinity Session&quot; had. A number of critics have also noted that while the album is undeniably a disappointment when compared to its predecessor, when taken on its own merits it is a better album than its initial reception would suggest. The album focuses on the band&#x27;s slow, languorous style, a style that has been called simplistic, or narcoleptic, or uncategorizable. Margo states &quot;It&#x27;s not country, it&#x27;s not blues, it&#x27;s not rock, we just do what we do.&quot; The album peaked at number 47 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 33 on the UK Charts.

== Album development ==

=== The Sharon Temple sessions ===
The band decided to record in a live setting as they had on &quot;The Trinity Session&quot;. This time they chose the Sharon Temple, a National Historic Site north of Toronto, as their studio. The recording proved challenging, as they had to adapt to the unique acoustics of the Sharon Temple and also the cool temperatures of a Canadian spring (they were not allowed to bring heaters into this unheated building due to its heritage designations). The cover of the album shows the band outside of this historic building. The intent of the recording was to use a single ambisonic mic like the one used for &quot;The Trinity Session&quot;, but this time Peter Moore was unfamiliar with the building, and the songs the band had written were more lush, which created recording problems, such as the music spilling over into Margo&#x27;s vocal mic and causing feedback. Of the three days for the recording, the first two days were spent solving the musical challenges, and fighting the cold temperatures. Moore explained to the band why cold temperatures were perfect to record in, and the band explained to Moore that cold temperatures negatively affected human anatomy, and prolonged exposure caused extremities such as fingers to stop working.

On the third day, the sound problems were resolved, both by configuring the band around the microphone, and also by banishing Margo to a far corner of the building in a small makeshift sound booth made of baffles and sound blankets which they named the &quot;witches hut&quot;. For the rest of their last day there, they made and recorded their music, and when the closed up, they were happy that they had some decent recordings, if not anything special. A few days later, they listened to the recordings, and decided to call it good. The band called the record company, and told them their album was finished. The record company executives told the band that the results were not what they were hoping for. However the company was patient with the band, and everyone agreed to live with the material for a while before deciding anything. While the Cowboy Junkies were touring Europe, they worked the new songs into their sets. As they played the songs, the songs changed and matured. When they came back they re-listened to the Sharon tapes and agreed that the tracks were not what they wanted to release, and they decided to re-record the music.

These songs were released in 2022, when Cowboy Junkies put out &quot;Sharon&quot;. The recordings were mastered for the musicians&#x27; benefit, but there were no serious plans to release it until 2010, when renewed interest in &quot;The Trinity Sessions&quot; made them reconsider putting out a finalized version of these sessions.

=== The Caution Horses sessions ===
When the band returned to Toronto, they made a decision to go to Eastern Studios in downtown Toronto, and find a new way to record their sound. The band really liked the one-mic sound, but wanted to take advantage of the multi-track equipment at the studio. Moore arranged the group around a mic, and spent a fair amount of time balancing the sound, but at the same time they placed individual mics on each instrument to capture each individual performance on a separate track, allowing them to augment the sound of the central mic as needed. The recording arrangement allowed them to capture the intimacy of live recordings. The sessions went relatively smoothly, they just rolled tape and played over a handful of days in December. Because of using multiple mics and tracks, for the first time the band had created an album which had to be mixed. The band felt they were too close to the material, so they brought in an outsider to mix the music. When they listened to the results, they trashed the mixes and decided to redo them themselves, spending a couple of weeks in the studio with Moore and their engineer, Tom Henderson.

<doc id="1215747" wikidata="Q347939" url="?curid=1215747" title="Prince Adalbert of Prussia (1811–1873)">
<text>Prince Heinrich Wilhelm Adalbert of Prussia (29 October 1811 – 6 June 1873) was a son of Prince Wilhelm of Prussia and Landgravine Marie Anna of Hesse-Homburg. He was a naval theorist and admiral. He was instrumental during the Revolutions of 1848 in founding the first unified German fleet, the Reichsflotte. During the 1850s he helped to establish the Prussian Navy.

==Biography==
Adalbert was born in Berlin, the son of Prince William, the youngest brother of King Frederick William III.

As a young man, Adalbert entered the Prussian army and by 1839, had become commander of the Guards Artillery brigade, a position he held until 1942. Several journeys led him between 1826 and 1842 to the Netherlands, Britain, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, Greece, and Brazil. He recognized during his many sea voyages the importance that sea power had for a modern commercial and industrial nation. He studied carefully the theory of naval warfare and in 1836 wrote a plan for the construction of a Prussian fleet, which would be centered on three paddle steamers. The cost of the ships meant that it had no chance of being enacted. Prussia at that time was a land power focused on Continental Europe, possessing practically no navy of its own; rather, it relied on the allied powers of Britain, the Netherlands, and Denmark. During the First Schleswig War of 1848–1851, however, the failure of this strategy became apparent: Britain and the Netherlands remained neutral and Denmark became the enemy. Within a few days, the Danish navy had destroyed German maritime commerce in the North Sea and the Baltic.

In 1843, upon returning from the cruise to Brazil, Adalbert was made the General Inspector of Artillery. He recruited then-Major Albrecht von Stosch as his adjutant in 1847; Stosch would go on to become the first chief of the German Imperial Admiralty in 1871.

During the Revolutions of 1848, and contemporaneously during the First Schleswig War against Denmark, the German National Assembly embarked on a project to establish a unified German fleet to combat the Danish blockade of the northern German states. The assembly named Prince Adalbert to lead the (Naval Technical Commission), along with Karl Rudolf Brommy, Jan Schröder, among others; he was also placed in charge of Prussia&#x27;s own initiative to build a fleet. He presented his recommendations in a &quot;Memorandum on the Construction of a German Fleet&quot; (&quot;Denkschrift über die Bildung einer deutschen Flotte&quot;) (Potsdam, 1848). In this memorandum, still regarded highly for its insights on naval strategy, Adalbert distinguished between three fleet models:
*A naval force intended solely for defensive actions in relation to coastal defense;
*An offensive naval force intended for national defense, and for the most necessary protection of commerce; or
*An independent naval power.

Adalbert favored the middle solution, because it would not provoke the great sea powers (such as Britain), but would provide the German navy with significant value as an ally.

In 1849 his cousin, King Frederick William IV, ordered Adalbert to resign his office in the fledgling Imperial Navy. The reactionary king mistrusted the National Assembly because of its revolutionary nature, and had already turned down its offer to assume the German Imperial crown. Despite the setback, Adalbert continued to give active support to the construction of a fleet.

In 1852 Adalbert argued that Prussia needed to build a naval base on the North Sea. He arranged the Jade Treaty of 20 July 1853, in which Prussia and the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg jointly withdrew from a region on the west bank of the Jade bay, where from 1854 onward Prussia established the fortress, naval base and city of Wilhelmshaven.

On 30 March 1854, Adalbert was named Admiral of the Prussian Coast and Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. In the summer of 1856, while on a training cruise of Prussian warships, he led Prussian forces at the Battle of Tres Forcas. He was shot by Riffians during the fighting. 

During the Second Schleswig War of 1864 (also known as the &quot;Danish-Prussian War&quot;) he commanded the Prussian Navy, though operational command of its main unit, the Baltic Squadron, fell to Eduard von Jachmann. He spent time aboard the aviso , and on 14 April he conducted a sweep into the Bay of Pomerania that resulted in an encounter with the Danish ship of the line and the steam frigate . opened fire at long range, leading to an indecisive two-and-a-half-hour battle in which easily outran the more powerful Danish vessels and escaped back to Swinemünde.

After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, which led to the creation of the German Empire, Adalbert laid down his title of &quot;Prince-Admiral&quot; and retired from the now-renamed Imperial Navy. He died two years later of liver disease, aged 62, in Karlsbad.

Adalbert was married to the dancer Therese Elssler (Frau von Barnim); their only son, Adalbert v. Barnim (born 22 April 1841), died in July 1860 during an expedition on the Nile.

<text>Sir Peter le Page Renouf (23 August 1822 – 14 October 1897) was a British professor, Egyptologist, and museum director, best known for his translation of &quot;The Book of the Dead&quot;.

==Personal life==

Renouf was born in Guernsey on the Channel Islands on 23 August 1822.
He married Ludovica von Brentano, member of a well-known German literary family in 1857. He died in London on 14 October 1897. His daughter Edith Renouf founded Guernsey&#x27;s first residential care home, &quot;Le Platon&quot;.

== Education ==

Renouf was educated at Elizabeth College, Guernsey. He matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford in 1840. He became a Roman Catholic, under the influence of John Henry Newman, and left without taking a degree since he was unable to subscribe to the Thirty Nine Articles, as required in those days.

== Religious background ==

Like many other Anglican converts, he proved a thorn in the side of the Ultramontane party in the Roman Church, though he did not, like some of them, return to the communion of the Church of England. He opposed the promulgation of the dogma of Papal Infallibility, and his treatise (1868) upon the condemnation of Pope Honorius for heresy by the council of Constantinople in AD 680 was placed upon the index of prohibited books.

== Career ==

=== Professorship ===

He had been from 1855 to 1864 professor of ancient history and Oriental languages in the Roman Catholic university which Newman vainly strove to establish in Dublin, and during part of this period edited the &quot;Atlantis&quot; and the &quot;Home and Foreign Review&quot;, which latter had to be discontinued on account of the hostility of the Roman Catholic hierarchy.

Renouf was one of the defenders of Champollion and of his method of decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphics in England when he was being criticized unfairly by other scholars.

=== Museum directorship ===

In 1864 he was appointed a government inspector of schools, which position he held until 1886, when his growing celebrity as an Egyptologist procured him the appointment of Keeper of Oriental Antiquities in the British Museum, in succession to Dr Samuel Birch. His understudy was E. A. Wallis Budge with whom he had an acrimonious relationship. He didn&#x27;t want Budge to succeed him as keeper, through a perceived lack of social skills (Budge didn&#x27;t come from a privileged background) and doubts about his abilities, objecting strongly to Budge being appointed as his successor and preferring Edouard Naville instead. 
Renouf was elected in 1887 president of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, to whose &quot;Proceedings&quot; he was a constant contributor.

Renouf was removed from his position as Keeper in the British Museum on reaching retirement age despite the signed opposition of twenty-five leading European Egyptologists of the day who wrote to the prime minister. Renouf gave &quot;excoriating evidence in court against Budge&quot; when the latter was found to have &quot;falsely accused Hormuzd Rassam of being corruptly involved in illicit trade of cuneiform tablets.&quot; Renouf continued to feel animosity towards Budge, accusing him of plagiarism and being a charlatan.

== Academic works ==

The most important of his contributions to Egyptology are his Hibbert Lectures on &quot;The Religion of the Egyptians&quot;, delivered in 1879; and the translation of &quot;The Book of the Dead&quot;, with an ample commentary, published in the &quot;Transactions&quot; of the society over which he presided. He retired from the Museum under the superannuation rule in 1891 and was knighted for services to the British Museum in 1896.

<text>The malong is a traditional Filipino-Bangsamoro rectangular or tube-like wraparound skirt bearing a variety of geometric or okir designs. The malong is traditionally used as a garment by both men and women of the numerous ethnic groups in the mainland Mindanao and parts of the Sulu Archipelago. They are wrapped around at waist or chest-height and secured by tucked ends, with belts of braided material or other pieces of cloth, or are knotted over one shoulder. They were traditionally hand-woven, with the patterns usually distinctive to a particular ethnic group. However, modern malong are usually machine-made or even imported, with patterns that mimic the traditional local designs.

==Description==

Handwoven malongs are made by Maranao, Maguindanaon, and T&#x27;boli weavers on a backstrap loom. The pattern or style of the malong may indicate the weaver&#x27;s tribal origin, such as the Maranao &quot;malong landap&quot;. Very rare malong designs and styles can indicate the village in which the malong was made, for example, the extremely intricate &quot;malong rawatan&quot; made only by a handful of Maranao weavers in Lanao del Sur, Mindanao and the handmade fabric &quot;inaul&quot; decorated with colorful designs by the Maguindanao weavers in Maguindanao province, Mindanao. Handwoven malongs, which are costly, are likely to be used only at social functions, to display the social and economic status of the wearer. While modern malongs are made of cotton and Lurex threads, some contemporary handwoven malongs are made of inexpensive rayon thread, to reduce the manufacturing cost to the weaver and ultimate cost to the consumer. There are many grades of cotton thread, and the cost of a malong can also be reduced by using the lesser grades of cotton thread, or by creating a loose or coarse weave.

Machine-made printed cotton malongs are made in Indonesia specifically for export to the Philippines, and are commonly referred to as &quot;batik&quot; because the item is imported; those inexpensive machine-made malongs are used for everyday purposes. The designs of traditional handwoven designs are used in imported cotton from Thailand, allowing the purchaser to have a cotton machine-printed malong which, from a distance, convincingly mimics the look of a much more expensive handwoven malong.

==Uses==

The malong can function as a skirt for both men and women, a turban, Niqab, Hijab, a dress, a blanket, a sunshade, a bedsheet, a &quot;dressing room&quot;, a hammock, a prayer mat, and other purposes. A newborn is wrapped in a &quot;malong,&quot; and as he grows this piece of cloth becomes a part of his daily life. When he dies, he is once again wrapped in a &quot;malong&quot;. Among traditional tribal peoples, the malong is used in everyday life. Even in areas where people wear Western-style clothing during the day, the malong is commonly used as sleepwear. The malong is also used in very big festivals, they wear this to show respect. 
Two are represented in the Ayala Museum Collection: The &quot;malong a andon&quot; on the left, and the &quot;malong a landap&quot; on the right.

==Similar clothing==
Similar wraparound skirts were also worn by other Filipino ethnic groups in the pre-colonial period, like the identical Visayan and Tausug &quot;patadyong&quot; and the shorter Tagalog &quot;tapis&quot;. However, most of these later evolved into a component of the &quot;baro&#x27;t saya&quot; worn over a longer skirt (the &quot;saya&quot; or &quot;falda&quot;) due to Spanish influence. Some of them survive among more isolated highlander groups like among the Ifugao people.

The malong and other Philippine wraparound skirts are related to the sarong worn by peoples in other parts of Maritime Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Brunei, East Timor, and Indonesia), as well as the barkcloth skirts worn by other Austronesian peoples like the direct Polynesian cognate malo or lavalava.

<doc id="1215757" wikidata="Q2732296" url="?curid=1215757" title="Foggy Dew (English song)">
<text>&quot;Foggy Dew&quot; or &quot;Foggy, Foggy Dew&quot; is an English folk song with a strong presence in the South of England and the Southern United States in the nineteenth century. The song describes the outcome of an affair between a weaver and a girl he courted. It is cataloged as Laws No. O03 and Roud Folk Song Index No. 558. It has been recorded by many traditional singers including Harry Cox, and a diverse range of musicians including Benjamin Britten, Burl Ives, A.L. Lloyd and Ye Vagabonds have arranged and recorded popular versions of the song.

==History and lyrics==
The song is a ballad, first published on a broadside in the early nineteenth century. Cecil Sharp collected eight versions of the song, particularly in Somerset, England, but also in the United States. Early versions of the song refer to her fear of the &quot;bugaboo&quot; rather than the foggy dew, as do many recent traditional American versions. In these older versions, an apprentice seduces his master&#x27;s daughter with the help of a friend disguised as a ghost (&quot;bugaboo&quot; or &quot;bogulmaroo&quot;). &quot;Bugaboo&quot; changed to &quot;the foggy dew&quot;, which seems to have sent the song in different directions.

Peter Kennedy, who collected several traditional English versions, has suggested that &quot;Foggy Dew&quot; is &quot;an Englishman&#x27;s attempt to pronounce the Irish &quot;orocedhu&quot;, which means &quot;dark&quot;, or &quot;black night&quot;...&quot;, but also points to James Reeves&#x27; observation that &quot;foggy&quot; in Middle English refers to &quot;coarse, rank marsh grass&quot; whilst &quot;dew&quot; represents virginity or chastity.

A.L. Lloyd wrote the following about the nature of the song and its regional variants:

The following lyrics are the first two verses as sung by Norfolk farmworker and traditional singer Harry Cox in 1953:

== East Anglian version ==
The East Anglian version of the song (which inspired A.L. Lloyd and Ye Vagabonds) appears to have been particularly popular. A.L. Lloyd recorded Douglas Morling of Eastbridge, Suffolk singing this variant in 1938 or 1939. Harry Cox was recorded singing this version of the song on different occasions in 1953 by Alan Lomax (available online via the Alan Lomax archive) and Peter Kennedy. Alec Bloomfield of Benhall, Suffolk was also recorded by Kennedy in 1952, and the recording can be heard on the British Library Sound Archive website.

The tune used in these East Anglian versions was also used by Robert Burns from &quot;Ye Banks and Braes of Bonnie Doon.&quot; Peter Kennedy suggests that Burns may have heard the tune used in a &quot;Border version&quot;, despite the fact that it seems particular to the East Anglian region. The tune has also been used for other traditional songs in Scotland, such as a recording of Maggie Stewart (Aunt of Jeannie Robertson) singing her version of Sir Hugh.

== Other traditional recordings ==
Other tunes have been recorded across England, particularly in the South, including two versions which can be heard via the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library from Sussex and Surrey.

The song was less frequently found in Scotland and Ireland. Willie Mathieson of Aberdeenshire, Scotland was recorded by Hamish Henderson singing a traditional version in 1952, with lyrics very similar to many English versions, which can be heard on Tobar an Dualchais.

A few traditional recordings have been made in the United States under the title of &quot;The Bugaboo&quot; and &quot;The Foggy Dew&quot;, including those of Georgia Ann Griffin (1937), Dan Tate (1960) and Doug Wallin (1992-1993) in the Appalachian region, two recordings made by Alan Lomax in Michigan which can be heard on the Library of Congress website, and a version recorded in 1940 by Helen Hartness Flanders of Lena Bourne Fish of New Hampshire.

== Popular adaptations ==
Benjamin Britten arranged a version of the song for voice and piano in 1942. Britten&#x27;s arrangement was a Suffolk variant, extremely similar to a traditional version sung by a Mrs. Saunders of Lingfield, Surrey in 1960 (audio available via Vaughan Williams Memorial Library). BBC Radio restricted broadcast of the song to programmes covering folk tunes or the works of Britten because of its suggestive nature. The tune is a late 18th- or early 19th-century revision of &quot;When I First Came to Court&quot;, licensed in 1689.

Burl Ives popularized a version of the song called &quot;The Foggy, Foggy Dew&quot; in the United States in the 1940s, and was once jailed in Mona, Utah, for singing it in public, when authorities deemed it a bawdy song. He claimed that a version dated to colonial America.

A.L. Lloyd recorded a cover version of the song in 1956 after learning it from Douglas Morling of Eastbridge, Suffolk, a typical East Anglian version similar to those of Harry Cox and Alex Bloomfield listed above. A.L. Lloyd&#x27;s recording inspired a popular 2019 version by Ye Vagabonds, who released it as the second track on their album &quot;The Hare&#x27;s Lament&quot;.

Other prominent artists including Ewan MacColl (1958) and Shirley Collins (1958) recorded versions of the song.

<text>Jennifer Chambers Lynch (born April 7, 1968) is an American filmmaker. The daughter of filmmaker David Lynch, she made her directorial debut with the film &quot;Boxing Helena&quot; in 1993. Following a troubled production, the film was a critical and commercial failure, with Lynch receiving a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director. The negative reception to her feature debut and controversy surrounding its release led to Lynch taking a 15-year hiatus from filmmaking.

Lynch returned to directing with 2008&#x27;s &quot;Surveillance&quot;. The film received mixed reviews, although it won the top prize at the Sitges Film Festival. A year later, Lynch began work on her next film, &quot;Hisss&quot;, which she disowned after the production was completed without her involvement. Her fourth film, &quot;Chained&quot;, released in 2012, was met with a positive critical reception. Since 2012, Lynch has focused on directing episodes of television series, including &quot;Psych&quot;, &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;, &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, &quot;American Horror Story&quot;, &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;, &quot;Elementary&quot;, &quot;The Strain&quot;, &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;, &quot;9-1-1&quot;, and &quot;Ratched&quot;.

Outside of her career as a director, Lynch wrote the book &quot;The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer&quot; in 1990. Told from the perspective of the character of the same name from her father&#x27;s television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, the novel was a commercial success, reaching number four on &quot;The New York Times&quot; paperback fiction best seller list that year.

==Early life==
Jennifer Chambers Lynch was born on April 7, 1968, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She is the daughter of artist and filmmaker David Lynch, through whom she has Finnish ancestry, and his first wife, painter Peggy Reavey ( Margaret Vosburgh Lentz). She began practicing Transcendental Meditation at the age of six. Lynch graduated from the Interlochen Art Academy where she studied visual arts and creative writing.

==Career==
===Film===
Lynch was educated in Los Angeles and Michigan at Interlochen Arts Academy. Together with her mother, Lynch made a brief appearance in her father&#x27;s debut feature film &quot;Eraserhead&quot;, but her appearance was not included in the final cut. Lynch subsequently worked as a production assistant on &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986), also directed by her father.

====&quot;Boxing Helena&quot; (1993)====
Lynch&#x27;s commissioned screenplay for &quot;Boxing Helena&quot;, which she would later go on to direct, attracted many actresses, including Madonna. Sherilyn Fenn, one of the stars of both her father&#x27;s television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and his film &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;, was ultimately cast as leading character Helena. Kim Basinger was also attached and was famously sued after resigning from the project. The controversy surrounding that case, as well as feminist outcry over &quot;Helena&quot;″s sadistic subject matter and accusations of nepotism, accompanied the movie&#x27;s critical drubbing upon its release in 1993.

In a 2009 interview with &quot;The Hollywood Interview&quot;, Lynch mentions her reactions to the critical reception of &quot;Boxing Helena&quot;:
I would love to know why people were so mad at me for telling a crazy fairy tale. I&#x27;m the first to say I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing. I did the best I could at 19, and all these crazy things happened. The idea that the film was faulted when everyone involved worked so fucking hard and believed in me, and there were these adults believing in me, who was essentially a child…when the National Organization of Women slammed me, that was sort of the final straw. It was no wonder I put my legs behind my ears and got pregnant. (laughs) Not that I didn&#x27;t love sex before then, but seriously. It was my child, essentially, who saved my life.

====&quot;Surveillance&quot; (2008)====
Following a lengthy hiatus, Lynch directed &quot;Surveillance&quot;, which won the top prize at the Festival de Cine de Sitges. A month later, Lynch became the first woman to receive the New York City Horror Film Festival&#x27;s Best Director award.

==== &quot;Hisss&quot; (2009) ====
Lynch was announced as director of the film &quot;Nagin&quot; (the film is also known as &quot;Hisss&quot;) that featured Bollywood actress Mallika Sherawat, but the film that was released was not Lynch&#x27;s work, even though the producers attached her name to the final product. Lynch explained in a 2012 interview:
Well, ultimately, I didn&#x27;t get to make that film. I put my director&#x27;s cut together, and the producers decided it was not what they wanted. They took it back to India. I never did any scoring or cutting or color-timing or any of the things you do to make the movie. They took the footage and changed it into what they wanted it to be. So it&#x27;s not my film. I went to India and shot some footage, but I have nothing to do with the movie they made.

==== &quot;Chained&quot; (2012) ====
Lynch then directed and co-wrote the 2012 thriller film &quot;Chained&quot;, in which Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio stars as a cab-driving serial killer. It received mostly positive reviews from critics, with a 68% rating on review aggregator website, Rotten Tomatoes.

==== Future film projects ====
Lynch was scheduled to film &quot;Visibility&quot; for the Motion Picture Corporation of America in 2011, but, as of August 2021, this project is not completed.

, Lynch was preparing &quot;A Fall from Grace&quot;, a film set and filmed in St. Louis and inspired by the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge.

===Television===
Lynch has directed episodes of many television series such as &quot;Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story&quot;, &quot;The Watcher&quot;, &quot;Jessica Jones&quot;, &quot;Finding Carter&quot;, &quot;Psych&quot;, &quot;Quantico&quot;, &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;, &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, &quot;The Last Ship&quot;, &quot;Wayward Pines&quot;, &quot;American Horror Story&quot;, &quot;The Strain&quot;, &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; and &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;

===Other projects===
Lynch authored &quot;The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer&quot; to accompany the television show &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; which was created by her father David Lynch and Mark Frost.

In 1993, Lynch directed the music video &quot;Living in the Rose&quot; by the British rock band New Model Army.

On March 21, 2010, Lynch was a judge at the International Surrealist Film Festival and she worked as producer for the Corey Brandenstein natural horror film &quot;The Compound&quot;.

An Australian documentary titled &quot;Despite the Gods&quot;, which chronicles Lynch&#x27;s struggle to make the film &quot;Hisss&quot;, was released in 2012. The documentary was shown at the Canadian International Documentary Festival and the program described the film: &quot;Out of her depth shooting on location with an Indian crew and two top Bollywood stars, Lynch turns her production into a vehicle for her own self-actualization, paying no regard to timeline, budget or reality. As the story in front of the camera derails, the story behind the camera explodes&quot;. She eventually disowned &quot;Hisss&quot;.

As of 2015, she is also a member of the board of advisers for the Hollywood Horror Museum.

==Awards and nominations==
&quot;Boxing Helena&quot; received incredibly scathing reviews upon its release and a Razzie Award for &quot;Worst Director&quot;. Nevertheless, it was nominated for Grand Jury Prize in the Dramatic category at the Sundance Film Festival.

==Personal life==
Lynch revealed in a 2009 interview that she underwent three spinal surgeries following the release of &quot;Boxing Helena&quot; due to a car accident that occurred when she was 19 years old. In the same interview, Lynch stated that she has a daughter.

<doc id="1215764" wikidata="Q8170996" url="?curid=1215764" title="'t Hooft–Polyakov monopole">
<text>In theoretical physics, the ″t Hooft–Polyakov monopole is a topological soliton similar to the Dirac monopole but without the Dirac string. It arises in the case of a Yang–Mills theory with a gauge group formula_1, coupled to a Higgs field which spontaneously breaks it down to a smaller group formula_2 via the Higgs mechanism. It was first found independently by Gerard &#x27;t Hooft and Alexander Polyakov.

Unlike the Dirac monopole, the &#x27;t Hooft–Polyakov monopole is a smooth solution with a finite total energy. The solution is localized around formula_3. Very far from the origin, the gauge group formula_1 is broken to formula_2, and the &#x27;t Hooft–Polyakov monopole reduces to the Dirac monopole.

However, at the origin itself, the formula_1 gauge symmetry is unbroken and the solution is non-singular also near the origin. The Higgs field formula_7,
is proportional to formula_8,
where the adjoint indices are identified with the three-dimensional spatial indices. The gauge field at infinity is such that the Higgs field&#x27;s dependence on the angular directions is pure gauge. The precise configuration for the Higgs field and the gauge field near the origin is such that it satisfies the full Yang–Mills–Higgs equations of motion.

==Mathematical details==
Suppose the vacuum is the vacuum manifold formula_9. Then, for finite energies, as we move along each direction towards spatial infinity, the state along the path approaches a point on the vacuum manifold formula_9. Otherwise, we would not have a finite energy. In topologically trivial 3 + 1 dimensions, this means spatial infinity is homotopically equivalent to the topological sphere formula_11. So, the superselection sectors are classified by the second homotopy group of formula_9, formula_13.

In the special case of a Yang–Mills–Higgs theory, the vacuum manifold is isomorphic to the quotient space formula_14 and the relevant homotopy group is formula_15. This does not actually require the existence of a scalar Higgs field. Most symmetry breaking mechanisms (e.g. technicolor) would also give rise to a &#x27;t Hooft–Polyakov monopole.

It is easy to generalize to the case of formula_16 dimensions. We have formula_17.

==Monopole problem==
The &quot;monopole problem&quot; refers to the cosmological implications of grand unification theories (GUT). Since monopoles are generically produced in GUT during the cooling of the universe, and since they are expected to be quite massive, their existence threatens to overclose it. This is considered a &quot;problem&quot; within the standard Big Bang theory. Cosmic inflation remedies the situation by diluting any primordial abundance of magnetic monopoles.

<doc id="1215771" wikidata="Q4907894" url="?curid=1215771" title="Bill Alley">
<text>William Edward Alley (3 February 1919 – 26 November 2004) was a cricketer who played 400 first-class matches for New South Wales, Somerset and a Commonwealth XI. After retiring as a cricketer, Alley continued as a cricket umpire for many years.

Whilst in Australia, Alley was also a middleweight boxer, and was undefeated in 28 contests when he was forced to give it up after being hit on the head in the nets at cricket practice. His cricket career was interrupted and delayed both by his boxing career, and by World War Two, which saw first class cricket matches cancelled for 6 years.

He was tipped to play Tests by Don Bradman, the Australian cricket captain, but missed out after fracturing his jaw. This prompted him to leave New South Wales and come to Lancashire, England, playing league cricket there for Colne Cricket Club for five years from 1948, becoming the only player to score 1,000 runs in each of five consecutive seasons in the league&#x27;s history.

This 5-year spell at Colne fulfilled the requirement at that time that any foreign player coming to England had to reside in England for 5 years before he could play first-class cricket in England. From Colne he moved to play for Blackpool CC in the newly established Northern League where he scored 19 centuries.

As the professional for Blackpool, he was able to earn more money than any first class cricketer anywhere in the world. Each League side in Lancashire was permitted to pay only one professional. During the 1950s and early 1960s, in the summer at any one time there were more than 150,000 holidaymakers in Blackpool, and there were very large crowds indeed paying at the turnstiles of Blackpool Cricket Club. Every season, moreover, the Blackpool pro was given a benefit match. Illustrating the value of the Blackpool job, Alley was succeeded as Blackpool&#x27;s pro by many of the all-time greats of the game. These included Sir Conrad Hunte, Garfield Sobers, Pankaj Roy, Hanif Mohammad and Rohan Kanhai. Playing only 2 days a week would also have given the pro the opportunity to take a second job if he had so wanted, including playing for a Minor County or a first class County Second Eleven.

Alley was eventually tempted into joining Somerset CCC in 1957, when he was 38, since they offered a 3-year contract, while Blackpool could not commit to one of such length. Alley played 350 first-class games for Somerset, the last one being when he was 49.

After stopping playing, he umpired first-class games for 16 years and also stood in 10 Test matches and 9 One Day Internationals as umpire. He so loved the West Country area of England that he chose to remain there after retirement rather than move back to his native Australia.

Alley was married to Betty, whom he met when playing cricket in the north of England, and they had two sons. His first wife died in childbirth; they had a son, who died in an Army accident.

==Record in first-class cricket==
Alley was an all-rounder. He scored 19,612 runs at an average of 31.88 batting left-handed. He took 768 wickets at 22.68 runs per wicket, with a best of 8 for 65, bowling right arm medium fast. He also took 267 catches in the field. His best season was his testimonial season in 1961 when, at the age of forty-two, he scored over 3,000 runs for Somerset and in one match achieved his highest score of 221 not out, out of Somerset&#x27;s total of 311 all out. During the same season, he hit in excess of 300 runs in a match against the visiting Australians (184 not out in the first innings and 134 not out in the second).

His was the last instance of a batsman scoring 3,000 runs in an English season. Only eight batsmen in history have achieved the feat of 3,000 runs in an English season. At the end of that season, he topped the first-class averages, ahead of all the England and Australian Test cricketers, who in those days all played among the Counties six days a week throughout the season except when they were playing Test cricket.

Alley&#x27;s 10 centuries for Somerset in 1961 remained a county record for thirty years. In 1962 he received the honour of being one of &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; five cricketers of the year, based on his performances in 1961 and during his career. In the 1962 season, he made over 1,900 runs and took 112 wickets. It was in 1962 that he got his best bowling return of 8 for 65 against a strong Surrey side, that included Ken Barrington, Peter May and Bernie Constable.
Many people expressed doubts about his exact age, and on being presented by Denis Compton with the Cricketer of the Year Award for 1962, Compton said &quot;it is stated that you are only 43 years old. Well if you are only 43, then I am still a baby in a nappy.&quot; Compton had retired 5 years earlier, in 1957, the same year Alley had started his English first-class career.

<doc id="1215776" wikidata="Q1544731" url="?curid=1215776" title="Lake Peigneur">
<text>Lake Peigneur is a brackish lake in the U.S. state of Louisiana, north of Delcambre and west of New Iberia, near the northernmost tip of Vermilion Bay. With a maximum depth of , it is the deepest lake in Louisiana. Its name comes from the French word &quot;peigneur&quot;, meaning &quot;one who combs.&quot;

Previously, it had been a freshwater lake, popular for recreation, until human activity caused an unusual disaster on November 20, 1980, that changed its structure and the surrounding land.

==Drilling disaster==

In petroleum geology, the formation of a salt dome often pushes terrain upward from the surrounding land, while also creating a subterranean salt dome trap, holding petroleum deposits. On Thursday, November 20, 1980, the drill assembly of a Texaco contracted oil rig, just offshore of the salt dome-caused Jefferson Island (itself in the east southeast section of Lake Peigneur), pierced an inactive third level of the Diamond Crystal Salt Company salt mine. The hole produced a vortex that drained the lake into the mine, filling the enormous caverns that had been left by the removal of salt. 

The mine, in operation since 1919, was made up of several levels up to below the surface. Each tunnel was about . Pillars of salt had been left in place to support the ceiling at each level. The pillars were dissolved by the encroaching fresh water and caused the mine tunnels to collapse.

The resultant sinkhole swallowed the drilling platform, eleven barges holding supplies for the drilling operation, a tugboat, many trees, and of the surrounding terrain, including much of Jefferson Island. So much water drained into the caverns that the flow of the Delcambre Canal that usually empties the lake into Vermilion Bay was reversed, causing salt water from the Gulf of Mexico to flow into what was now a dry lakebed. This backflow created for a few days the tallest waterfall ever in the state of Louisiana, at , as the lake refilled with salty water from the Delcambre Canal and Vermilion Bay. Air displaced by water flowing into the mine caverns erupted through the mineshafts as compressed air and then later as geysers.

Although there were no human deaths, three dogs were reported killed. All 55 employees in the mine at the time of the accident escaped, with six employees later given awards by Diamond Crystal for heroism. Their successful evacuation was thanks to the mine&#x27;s electrician who noticed a torrent of water and sounded the alarm, as well as the employees&#x27; discipline and training making their escape via the only elevator in an orderly fashion. The crew of seven on the drilling rig fled the platform shortly before it collapsed into the new depths of the lake. A fisherman who was on the lake at the time piloted his small boat to shore and escaped. Days after the disaster, once the water pressure equalized, nine of the eleven sunken barges popped out of the whirlpool and refloated on the lake&#x27;s surface.

=== Cause ===

On the date of the disaster, the oil rig was conducting exploratory drilling in the lake alongside a salt dome under the water, that contained a salt mine.

The rig&#x27;s drill assembly had become stuck at two-and-a-half hours before the drilling rig began to tilt. 

The drill assembly punctured the salt mine beneath the lake, and the water entered the mine. Over the course of several hours, the fresh lake water dissolved the salt and enlarged the hole, causing the lake to drain into the mine. 

The Mine Safety and Health Administration was unable to determine blame because they could not determine whether Texaco was drilling in the wrong place or if the mine&#x27;s maps were inaccurate. 

Evidence that could have confirmed the cause was washed away in the maelstrom. Engineers from Texaco and Diamond Crystal worked together after the fact and pinpointed the likely location of the hole within a mined out portion of the level of the mine.

===Aftermath===
In 1983, Texaco and the drilling contractor Wilson Brothers paid million (equivalent to $ million in ) to Diamond Crystal, while Texaco, Wilson Brothers and Diamond Crystal also paid a total of $12.8million (equivalent to $ million in ) to the Live Oak Gardens botanical garden and plant nursery, in out-of-court settlements to compensate for the damage caused. The Mine Safety and Health Administration released a report on the disaster in August 1981 which exhaustively documented the event but stopped short of identifying an official reason for the disaster. The mine was finally closed in December 1986.

Since 1994, AGL Resources has used Lake Peigneur&#x27;s underlying salt dome as a storage and hub facility for pressurized natural gas. There was concern from local residents in 2009 over the safety of storing the gas under the lake and nearby drilling operations.

<text>Mendrisio (; ) is a municipality in the district of Mendrisio in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.

Mendrisio is the seat of the Accademia di Architettura of the university of Italian-speaking Switzerland (USI).

The municipality was boosted in size on 4 April 2004 when it incorporated the former municipality of Salorino. On 5 April 2009 it incorporated the former municipalities of Arzo, Capolago, Genestrerio, Rancate and Tremona. On 14 April 2013 the former municipalities of Besazio, Ligornetto and Meride merged into the municipality of Mendrisio.

Mendrisio is served by Mendrisio railway station and Mendrisio San Martino railway station.

==History==
Mendrisio was first mentioned in 793 as &quot;Mendrici&quot; and was also known by its German name, &quot;Mendris&quot; though this name is no longer used. However, the area was inhabited during the Roman era. Around thirty tombs, a villa and coins from a Roman settlement have been discovered in the area. Following the collapse of the Roman Empire, Mendrisio was the center of a Lombard district and grew into a town. During the Middle Ages, several fortifications were built on the valley floor between the Porta S. Giovanni and the Moree river. In the Late Middle Ages the Torriani family built their castle on the rocky hills above the town. Mendrisio became an independent town in the County of Seprio in 1140. The county was taken over by Como three decades later in 1170. Como ruled over Mendrisio until 1335, when Como was brought under Milan&#x27;s control. Mendrisio then remained under Milanese control until 1402. At some point in the 15th century, the town was given as a fief to the Rusca and Sanseverino families.

In the late 15th and early 16th century, the Swiss Confederation canton of Uri began expanding down into the Leventina valley. After a number of setbacks, by 1512 Uri and the rest of the Confederation captured the city of Lugano and incorporated the Landvogtei of Mendrisio. Nine years later, in 1521, the Swiss Confederation established a system of shared responsibility over the Italian Bailiwicks and appointed a bailiff to manage Mendrisio. Mendrisio remained a conquered territory with limited autonomy and rights until the 1798 French invasion and the creation of the Helvetic Republic.

Despite Mendrisio&#x27;s early growth, it remained a part of the large parish of Balerna until the 15th century. Over the following years, two parishes were formed in the town, under the parish churches of SS Cosma e Damiano and S. Sisinio. The Church of SS Cosma e Damiano was built in the Baroque style in 1672. The first building was demolished in the 19th century and a new Classicist style church was built nearby in 1863–75. The church of S. Sisino was built outside the town in the village of La Torre. A number of religious orders also settled in Mendrisio, including the Humiliati, the Servite Order, the Ursulines and the Capuchins. The Servites established a boys school in 1644 in the Convent of S. Giovanni. In 1852 that school became a cantonal secondary school. During the 19th century the religious orders&#x27; convents and monasteries were all secularized.

In the past century, the town has expanded away from the Moree river and developed a large industrial sector. During the late 19th century, one of the first factories in town, the Torriani-Bolzani spinning mill employed about 350 women and children (over 10% of the population in 1900). The factories brought jobs to the town and encouraged villagers to move into Mendrisio. The population doubled over the last 60 years of the 19th century. Wealthy industrialists built large villas and the Beata Vergine hospital. The construction of a railroad through the town brought more residents and industry. During the 20th century, a number of service companies opened in the town and industry began to decline. In 2000 almost three-quarters of the working population worked in the services sector. Mendrisio&#x27;s location near the Italian border means that many of the residents and workers are cross-border commuters.

As a district capital, Mendrisio provides services for the surrounding communities. A neuro-psychiatric clinic was opened in 1898. This was followed by primary and secondary schools in 1944 and in 1996 the School of Architecture (Accademia di Architettura di Mendrisio) of the Università della Svizzera italiana opened thanks to Mario Botta.

<text>Black Eyed Man is the fourth studio album by Cowboy Junkies, released in 1992. The album continues the band&#x27;s evolution from a spare country blues style (exemplified by the 1988 album &quot;The Trinity Session&quot;) to a more mainstream country rock style.

== Album development ==
The Cowboy Junkies approach each album looking to see where they can change or improve. With &quot;Black Eyed Man&quot; Michael Timmins wanted to explore music structure, specifically time shifts and tempo shifts. Margo wanted to expand her singing style and her range. Michael states &quot;We also wanted to approach each song individually rather than the whole album being one long song. I wanted this one to have different perspectives in each song.&quot; Another change the band made was to record the album over several months instead of in one session. They also decided to try using a new mixture of musicians, instruments, and recording personnel. The band concentrated on two or three songs at a time instead of the album as a whole. Each month they would write and arrange song ideas for the first three weeks, and then on the final week would head into the studio at Grant Avenue Studios in Hamilton, Ontario. One musical choice was to make the album diverse in its arrangements, unlike &quot;The Caution Horses&quot;. Each song would have its own unique collection of musicians. The theme to hold the album together was &quot;the lyrical theme of love found, love lost and love betrayed - it was to be the journey of the faceless, nameless and haunted Black Eyed Man,&quot; according to Michael Timmins.

The band experimented with each track. Several musicians from previous albums showed up during the rehearsal sessions, along with about twenty five other Toronto players that were known to the band, or recruited because of their skills with instruments the band wanted to consider including in the album. Many of the songs were minimally rehearsed if at all, in an attempt to capture the freshness and spontaneity. Several musical ideas did not work, but some of the rejected attempts lead the band to try different sounds and directions. One example is &quot;Murder, Tonight, in the Trailer Park&quot;, which blended the jazz guitar sensibilities of Tony Quarington with the guitar work of Ken Mhyr to develop a song that was different than was first envisioned.

When the Cowboy Junkies were touring for &quot;The Caution Horses&quot; in 1990, they invited American singer/songwriter Townes Van Zandt to tour with them. During the tour, Van Zandt wrote &quot;Cowboy Junkies Lament&quot; especially for the band. Michael Timmins returned the favor, penning &quot;Townes&#x27; Blues&quot; as a tribute to Van Zandt. The band also cover Van Zandt&#x27;s &quot;To Live is to Fly&quot; at the end of the album.

John Prine appears as a guest vocalist on &quot;If You Were the Woman and I Was the Man.&quot; The band had initially asked Jimmie Dale Gilmore to duet with Margo, but although he showed up and recorded with the band, his voice was never able to mesh with Margo&#x27;s.

<text>Horace Newton Allen (April 23, 1858 – December 11, 1932) was an American diplomat, missionary and physician who was American ambassador to Korea from 1897 to 1905. Along with Robert Samuel Maclay, Allen was one of the first Western Protestant missionaries in Korea, arriving there on September 15, 1884.

After treating , a royal relative injured during the Gapsin Coup, Allen became close to the king of Joseon, Gojong. At his suggestion, Gojong founded the first western hospital, Chejungwon (now known as Severance Hospital). Allen was in charge of the core function of the hospital. A year after the establishment of the hospital, Allen started a medical school, which offered the first formal western medical education in Korea.

Due to Allen&#x27;s relationship with the emperor and other officials, Allen became part of the United States Legation to Korea. He was appointed as secretary in 1890 and was promoted to US minister and consul general in 1897. However, Allen was recalled in 1905, over disagreements with the United States government regarding the Taft-Katsura Agreement.

Horace Newton Allen was born in Delaware, Ohio, on April 23, 1858. He received his Bachelor of Science at Ohio Wesleyan University in 1881. He studied medicine at the Miami Medical School in Cincinnati, Ohio, graduating in 1883.

== Career ==
Allen was appointed a medical missionary and sent to China by the Board of Foreign Missions of the Northern Presbyterian Church and arrived in Shanghai on October 11, 1883. After a while, he decided to serve in Korea, which had just opened its doors to the western world. After obtaining the mission board&#x27;s permission, he went to Korea on September 20, 1884, to explore. As government law prohibited foreign religion at the time, he was appointed medical officer of the United States Legation to Korea in Seoul, thus hiding his true identity. He went back to Shanghai to bring back his wife Francis &quot;Fannie&quot; and their son, Harry to Korea on October 26.

On December 4, 1884, the Gapsin Coup, a coup d&#x27;état staged with the help of the Japanese army by a handful of elite progressive officials, took place. The progressive government collapsed in 3 days as the Chinese army entered Seoul and defeated the Japanese army. This event started with the assassination attempt on the life of the queens nephew, , who was hosting a banquet to celebrate the opening of the nation&#x27;s first postal office with dignitaries including foreign diplomats and he was inflicted with 7 severe sword wounds. Dr. Allen was summoned and treated Min&#x27;s near mortal wounds, applying western medical methods against the objection of 14 of the court&#x27;s medicine men. It is noted that wounds soon became infected and Dr. Allen treated the infected wounds with &quot;baked mud&quot; to absorb pus and wash away with water and it took 3 months before Dr. Allen&#x27;s treatment on him was completed. Upon hearing the wide spread rumor that a foreigner with bushy red beard revived a dead prince, many people flocked to his house. 

He submitted to the Foreign Ministry &quot;A proposal of founding a hospital for the government of His Majesty in Seoul Corea&quot; with an introductory letter by J. C. Foulk, charge de&#x27; affair of the U.S. Legation. Gojong granted his proposal readily and a western hospital named Gwanghyewon () was opened in a traditional Korean estate on April 10, 1885. The name quickly was changed to Chejungwon (). The hospital had 5 separate in-patient rooms, eye treatment room for extraction of cataracts, vaccination room for smallpox, etc. A year later, Dr. Allen, John William Heron and Horace Underwood opened the Medical and Scientific School of the Royal Corean Hospital and admitted 16 medical students. The adjoining school building had a large classroom, a chemistry lab and 2 dormitory rooms.

It is noteworthy that since September 1894 the Board of Foreign Mission started to operate the nation&#x27;s first western hospital and medical school in Korea and in September 1904 Chejungwon built a new ultra modern brick building outside the South Gate with help from Louis Severance, a philanthropist in Cleveland Ohio, moving patients from &quot;the old to new buildings&quot; on September 23. The invitation to the dedication of the building read &quot;the New Chejungwon/Severance Hospital&quot;. For a while after the transition the popular daily newspaper Donga Ilbo called the new hospital &quot;New Chejungwon&quot; and government official document also referred the new hospital as Shin Chejungwon (New Chejungwon). The newly renamed Severance Hospital was the direct descendant of Chejungwon.

The Severance Hospital and Medical school on June 5, 1962, moved to a new location in Sinchon after building a huge medical complex which included the Eighth U.S. Army Memorial Chest Hospital as an integral part and a separate unit ($400,000 worth of building material and $70,000 for medical equipment as American Forces Aids to Korea Program 1955). This institution now is called Yonsei Health System, part of Yonsei University after union with Yonsei University on Jan 5, 1957.

Allen&#x27;s post Chejungwon activities related to Korea are; King Gojong of Korea asked Allen to help open the Korean Legation in the United States of America and Allen led a 12-man delegation to Washington, D.C. in November 1887 and established the Korean Legation in January 1888 when Minister Park J. Y presented appointment letter to President Cleveland. Allen helped operate the Korean Legation and carried out diplomatic activities (his position was &quot;foreign secretary&quot; &quot;참찬관&quot; ).

Upon his return from North America he started working in July 1890 as Secretary at the United States Legation in Seoul and left 15 years later in June 1905 as the Envoy Extraordinaire and the Minister Plenipotential before his successor Morgan closed the United States legation in November 1905.

== Death and legacy ==
He died in Toledo, Ohio, on December 11, 1932. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Toledo. Allen and his wife, Francis Ann &quot;Fannie&quot;, had two sons, Horace Ethan &quot;Harry&quot; who in turn had 3 sons and Maurice who left no children. There are 5 surviving great grandchildren.

Allen was decorated 3 times by King Gojong and the last one, the highest Tae Guk Order was donated to Yonsei Health System in 2015 by his great granddaughter Lydia Allen.

Dr. Allen&#x27;s contribution to Korea: 1. Introduction of western medicine to Korea. 2. Opening the door to the proselytization of Christianity to Korea 3. Industrialization of Korea; arranging building a railroad system, trolley, electric company, etc. by American companies. 4. Faithful supporter of King Gojong and Korea.

<doc id="1215806" wikidata="Q6780017" url="?curid=1215806" title="Mary King (political scientist)">
<text>Mary Elizabeth King (born July 30, 1940) is a professor of Peace and Conflict Studies at the United Nations affiliated University for Peace, a political scientist, and author of several publications. She is a graduate of Ohio Wesleyan University and received a doctorate in international politics from Aberystwyth University in 1999. She is also a Fellow of the Rothermere American Institute and a distinguished Scholar at the American University Center for Global Peace in Washington D.C.

She received the Jamnalal Bajaj International Award in 2003. In 2009 she was awarded the El-Hibri Peace Education Prize. In May 2011, her alma mater Ohio Wesleyan University awarded her a doctor of laws (honorary) degree.

== Biography ==
After graduating college, King became a staff member for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). She wrote a book on that four-year experience,&quot; Freedom Song: A Personal Story of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement&quot; and won a Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Book Award for it.

King&#x27;s participation in the Civil Rights Movement prompted her to co-write essays on women&#x27;s issues with fellow activist Casey Hayden, most notably &quot;Sex and Caste: A Kind of Memo&quot; (1965), which criticized sexism within the civil rights movement. Sara Evans attributes King and Hayden as founding activists for the women&#x27;s liberation movement in her book &quot;Personal Politics.&quot; Evans claims that King and Hayden used their knowledge of participatory democracy, learned through SNCC membership, to critique women&#x27;s position in a system of patriarchy. She says their essays stirred the beginning of women&#x27;s liberation.

Between 1968 and 1972 King worked for the federal government during the Johnson and Nixon administrations under the U.S. office of economic opportunity helping to set up neighborhood health services for America&#x27;s rural and urban poor. And in 1974 King, with five other women, established the National Association of Women Business Owners. She was president of the Organization in 1976.

King was appointed deputy director of the independent subcabinet federal agency that housed the Peace Corps, VISTA, and various programs of the ACTION agency under president Jimmy Carter.

Mary resides with her husband, Dr. Peter G. Bourne, in Virginia in the United States and in Oxford in the United Kingdom.

== Civil rights activism and feminism ==

Mary King joined the civil rights movement at the age of 22. She got her start in activism in college when she participated in a study tour across the south. On this tour in 1962 King and other students, both white and black, stayed at black colleges such as Fisk University, Clark College, and Tuskegee Institute. This group of students also visited white schools, such as Vanderbilt University, Agnes Scott College, and Georgia Tech. On the Study tour King was introduced to SNCC when she met John Lewis and Bernard Lafayette. Both of the men King met had been Freedom Riders and were affiliated with SNCC. Also on this study tour King met another student activist, Casey Hayden. Hayden would also become a staff member of SNCC and close friend to King.

King marked this study tour as &quot;a turning point in [her] life.&quot; When King returned to Ohio Wesleyan University after her study tour she set up her own student organization. The organization she created was called The Student Committee on Race Relations (SCORR). With this organization, King linked together sixty students to change University policies; such as, Ohio Wesleyan&#x27;s policy of rooming black freshman in single dorms or only with each other, along with the University&#x27;s policies of limiting black enrollment.

King graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University in June 1962 and following in the same path as Casey Hayden was introduced to civil rights activist, Ella Baker, through the Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association in the southern region. Through this organization, Baker and professor Howard Zinn of Spelman College asked King to participate in their human-relations project. This project would involve King travelling with a recent black graduate to different colleges to assess the extent of academic freedom in the south. King agreed to participate. For this job King moved to Atlanta, Georgia and was partnered with a young black woman, Roberta Yanci &quot;Bobbi.&quot; As part of the project, King and Bobbi wrote and distributed a six-page newsletter, &quot;Notes from the South.&quot; The newsletter chronicled litigation, student direct action, token integration occurring on college campuses and on what SNCC was doing. The goal of the human-relations project was to help southern whites meet and know educated black counterparts from the same area, so that they could develop relationships with them as human beings.

SNCC&#x27;s office headquarters were also in Atlanta, so during the year that King worked for the human-relations project she also volunteered at SNCC, mostly doing office clerical work. Volunteering helped King establish connections with SNCC staff members, leading to her obtaining a staff position with the organization. In June 1963 when her job ended with the human-relations project, King began working for SNCC. She was to assist the organizations press secretary Julian Bond.

After being hired by SNCC, King was sent to Danville, Virginia to run SNCC&#x27;s communications operation there. She was to manage everything related to the information SNCC gave to the news media representatives in Danville. This role also made her the direct telephone link between SNCC&#x27;s Danville office and its headquarters in Atlanta. In Danville King participated in protests against Danville mills. Protesters wanted fair employment policies at the mills and also led a boycott of Dan River Mills products. In July 1963, Leonard W. Holt, a black attorney, told King that she was about to be indicted for acts of violence and war by Danville courts; therefore, she needed to leave Danville. King fled to a Roman Catholic convent in North Carolina and eventually returned to SNCC headquarters in Atlanta only to be sent to Mississippi.

King was sent to Mississippi to prepare a brochure and while there she encountered many leading activists for the Mississippi movement; such as Fannie Lou Hamer and Bob Moses. By December 1963 King was back at SNCC headquarters in Atlanta, occasionally running its communications program under Julian Bond. While in Atlanta, King was arrested and jailed for participating in a lunch counter sit-in.

King did communications work for SNCC in Atlanta between 1963 and 1964. Then between 1964 and 1965 her work was stationed in Jackson, Mississippi. The goals of communication were to create public and national awareness of the movement. Kings job entailed calling jails when activists were arrested, calling news media to give them stories about the movement, connecting SNCC offices to transfer news, and also help publish SNCC&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Student Voice.&quot;

King had been in Mississippi during the Freedom Summer project of 1964. After the summer project had ended a SNCC staff meeting was called to discuss the future of the organization. For this meeting King wrote two papers. One paper she wrote reflected on SNCC&#x27;s need for a better communication system and how that need interfered with SNCC&#x27;s lack of bureaucracy. The second paper King co-wrote with Casey Hayden, also in Mississippi with the SNCC. This paper addressed what it meant to be a woman SNCC staff member and the unequal treatment that resulted because of the patriarchal system. In King&#x27;s words, it addressed the issue &quot;of how my growing perception of myself as a woman might affect the structure and program of SNCC.&quot;

In 1965 King and Hayden expanded on this paper, elaborating on its central thesis that not only in society at large, but also within the civil rights movement itself, women are &quot;caught&quot; in a &quot;common-law caste system&quot; that limits their opportunity and voice. King and Hayden sent &quot;Sex and Caste - A Kind of Memo&quot; to forty women activists across the U.S. These women were involved in organizations such as Students for a Democratic Society, the National Student Association, the Northern Student Movement, the Student Peace Union, and SNCC. The document was subsequently published under the title &quot;Sex and Caste&quot; in the pacificst periodical Liberation, and entreated women to &quot;start to talk with each other more openly.&quot;

In the summer of 1965 King began planning and conducting workshops to help movement volunteers remain active in civil rights issues once they went home. The workshops were &quot;to discuss ways of using new skills, experiences, and lessons learned from community organizing in other parts of the country and in other phases of the movement.&quot; In her autobiography, King describes feeling estranged from SNCC for various reasons. This estrangement led to her resignation from SNCC at the end of 1965.

<text>&quot;Forty Years On&quot; is a song written by Edward Ernest Bowen and John Farmer in 1872.

It was originally written for Harrow School, but has also been adopted by many other schools including Westville Boys&#x27; High School, Simon Langton Boys School Canterbury Kent,Starehe Boys&#x27; Centre and School, Beverley Grammar School (reputedly the oldest state school in England), Dover Grammar School for Boys, Wellington College, Wellington, Otahuhu College, Auckland, Melbourne High School, Netherthorpe School, Tormead School, Spalding Grammar School, Pretoria Boys High School, Nelson College, Napier Boys&#x27; High School, Woodford County High School for Girls, Colyton Grammar School, Camberwell Grammar School, Bolton School, Bolton School Boys Division, Bolton School Girls Division, Frensham (Mittagong, NSW) Mayfield Comprehensive School, Putney, now defunct Middlesbrough Junior Technical School, London in the early 1960s and Wroxall Abbey School. 

It is specifically about life at school, and is meant to give pupils now an idea of what it will be like in forty years when they return to their old school, and to remind old boys about their school life.

It is the main school song of Harrow School, and is sung there at the end of any &quot;Songs&quot; – occasions when old boys of the school return to hear the schools songs being sung by current boys, or an occasion within houses for singing the same songs at the end of each term – followed by &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; and the British national anthem (&quot;God Save the King&quot;). The &quot;Churchill&quot; verse, written to celebrate the life of one most famous Old Harrovian, Sir Winston Churchill is only sung once a year at a special Churchill Songs. Traditionally, verse three is sung by Old Harrovians in attendance at School Songs. The Churchill verse The penultimate &quot;Follow Up!&quot; in each chorus is sung unaccompanied by the School XII, which is made up of the best singers in the top year.

&quot;With the tramp of the twenty-two men&quot; refers to the twenty-two players on the field during a game of Harrow football, a game that is ancestral to association football and played exclusively at Harrow School - this part may be likewise altered at other schools for other sports like rugby or football that may be more significant to the school.

It inspired the title of (and is sung in) &quot;Forty Years On&quot;, a play by Alan Bennett. The song was also used in the films &quot;Young Winston&quot; (1972) and &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; (2010).

==Lyrics==
&lt;poem&gt;
Forty years on, when afar and asunder
Parted are those who are singing today,
When you look back, and forgetfully wonder
What you were like in your work and your play,
Then, it may be, there will often come o’er you,
Glimpses of notes like the catch of a song –
Visions of boyhood shall float them before you,
Echoes of dreamland shall bear them along,

&quot;Follow up! Follow up! Follow up&quot;
&quot;Follow up! Follow up&quot;
&quot;Till the field ring again and again,&quot;
&quot;With the tramp of the twenty-two men.&quot;
&quot;Follow up! Follow up!&quot;

Routs and discomfitures, rushes and rallies,
Bases attempted, and rescued, and won,
Strife without anger and art without malice, –
How will it seem to you, forty years on?
Then, you will say, not a feverish minute
Strained the weak heart and the wavering knee,
Never the battle raged hottest, but in it.
Neither the last nor the faintest, were we!

&quot;Follow up! etc.&quot;...

Oh the great days, in the distance enchanted,
Days of fresh air, in the rain and the sun,
How we rejoiced as we struggled and panted –
Hardly believable, forty years on!
How we discoursed of them, one with another,
Auguring triumph, or balancing fate,
Loved the ally with the heart of a brother,
Hated the foe with a playing at hate!

&quot;Follow up etc.&quot;

Forty years on, growing older and older,
Shorter in wind, as in memory long,
Feeble of foot, and rheumatic of shoulder,
What will it help you that once you were strong?
God give us bases to guard or beleaguer,
Games to play out, whether earnest or fun;
Fights for the fearless, and goals for the eager,
Twenty, and thirty, and forty years on!

&quot;Follow up etc.&quot;

Churchill Verse:

Blazoned in honour! For each generation
You kindled courage to stand and to stay;
You led our fathers to fight for the nation,
Called &quot;Follow up&quot; and yourself showed the way.
We who were born in the calm after thunder
Cherish our freedom to think and to do;
If in our turn we forgetfully wonder,
Yet we&#x27;ll remember we owe it to you.

&quot;Follow up! etc.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

The original Churchill verse, sung to him on 12 November 1954, was as follows:
&lt;poem&gt;
Sixty years on—though in time growing older,
Younger at heart you return to the Hill:
You, who in days of defeat ever bolder,
Led us to Victory, serve Britain still.
Still there are bases to guard or beleaguer,
Still must the battle for Freedom be won:
Long may you fight, Sir, who fearless and eager
Look back to-day more than sixty years on
&lt;/poem&gt;

==The Starehe Boys&#x27; Centre and School rendition==
Adapted from the Harrow School version, written in 1872:

Forty years on, when afar and asunder,
Parted are those who are singing today,
When we look back and forgetfully wonder
What we were like in our work and our play:
Brotherhood strong and our teachers devoted,
Assembly, Chapel, the House where we grew,
Posho, Githeri, the Founders&#x27; Day dinner,
Talks in Baraza, the friendship we knew.

&quot;Lenga Juu! Lenga Juu! Lenga Juu! Lenga Juu!&quot;
&quot;Lenga Juu! Lenga Juu!&quot;
&quot;Give honour again and again,&quot;
&quot;To Starehe where we became men,&quot;
&quot;Lenga Juu! Lenga Juu!&quot;

O the great days in the distance enchanted,
Hours in the classroom and hours in the field,
In games and athletics we struggled and panted,
Learning to strive hard and never to yield,
Scouting, exploring, those long expeditions,
Fighting of fires, swimming and First Aid,
Playing of music, debating and drama,
Voluntary service – our first steps we made.

&quot;Lenga Juu! Lenga Juu!&quot; etc.

Forty years on growing older and older,
Shorter in wind as in memory long,
Feeble of foot and rheumatic of shoulder,
What will it help us that once we were strong?
God gives us duty for us to discharge it,
Problems to face, struggle with and overcome,
Service to render and glory to covet,
Twenty and thirty and forty years on!

&quot;Lenga Juu! Lenga Juu!&quot; etc.

===Other uses===
&quot;Forty Years On&quot; is the school song of Wellington College in Wellington, New Zealand. It is also sung at Napier Boys&#x27; High School in Napier, at the breakup ceremony at Waitaki Boys&#x27; High School in the 1960s, and at Timaru Boys&#x27; High School at least from 1913. A variation of the song was also sung at Christchurch Boys&#x27; High School at least during the later 1940s and early 1950s. Feilding Agricultural High School (F.A.H.S), in Feilding, also used it as its school song for a number of years.

In Australia, the song is sung at a number of schools. In the Australian state of Victoria, the song is sung regularly at prestigious independent schools Wesley College, Melbourne, Haileybury, Melbourne, Carey Baptist Grammar School, Camberwell Grammar School and Scotch College, Melbourne, being the official Old Boy anthem and at Melbourne High School&#x27;s Speech Night (Graduation Night). Wynnum State high and Rockhampton Girl&#x27;s Grammar School (School Song). Only the first and last verses (excluding the Winston Churchill verse) are sung. Rather than the &quot;tramp of the twenty-two men&quot;, Haileybury College, Carey, Camberwell Grammar School, Scotch College and Melbourne High School all replace the line with the &quot;tramp of the thirty-six men&quot; in reference to Australian rules football being the dominant football code in Victoria. It is also the school song of Frensham School in NSW, an all-girls boarding school, where it is traditionally sung on the school&#x27;s birthday and at Old Girl&#x27;s reunions.

In the United Kingdom: the school song of the old Brewood Grammar School for boys, Netherthorpe School, Colyton Grammar School, Dover Grammar School, Woodford County High School in Essex, Beverley Grammar School in East Yorkshire, Bolton School, Manchester Grammar School, Stand Grammar School Whitefield, High Storrs Grammar School, Sheffield, Ecclesfield Grammar School, Sheffield (1931–1973) the now-defunct Salford Grammar School, the former Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys, Leicester (succeeded by Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College) and Harrow School&#x27;s affiliated school, The John Lyon School. In the 1950s and 1960s, it was also the school song of Clifton High School in Bristol, an all-girls school at the time. It is also the school song of Wycombe High School for girls and was also sung at the end of term in the 1980s at Wycombe Abbey School, in whose songbook it figured. It was also sung by King Edward&#x27;s Grammar School for Boys, Five Ways, Birmingham, in the 1950s by all the school leavers. It was also the school song of Lawnswood (formerly Leeds Modern School) hence the title of Alan Bennett&#x27;s play since he is a former pupil. Also sung at the now-defunct Helston Grammar School in Helston, Cornwal, England.

In the King&#x27;s School, Canterbury, the song was sung in the 1920s. It was replaced with &#x27;The School of Theodore&#x27; hymn.

In the United States: sung at the Cranbrook Kingswood School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan (excluding the Winston Churchill verse) at the commencement ceremony. Also sung at St. Timothy&#x27;s School in Stevenson, Maryland as part of a tradition dating back to 1882 (though it is sung faster and with some major alterations in the lyrics).

In India: the Cathedral and John Connon School of Bombay&#x27;s school song, &quot;Prima in Indus&quot;, is an adaptation of this.

In Sri Lanka: it is used as the school anthem of Kandy Girls&#x27; High School, a prestigious school. 

In Kenya: it is sung on Founders&#x27; Day at Starehe Boys&#x27; Centre and School.

In South Africa: at Pretoria Boys High School, Pretoria, it is sung at all School Valedictions and assemblies at which Old Boys are present, with certain minor adaptions. &quot;Twenty-two good men&quot; is substituted by &quot;thirty good men&quot;. It is also sung at Westville Boys&#x27; High School, Durban, when the matrics have their speech night and ring the Swain bell symbolizing their departure from the school and continued ties to its family. The ringing of the bell is the final act of the Matric group before the final exams. Also the school song for girls&#x27; school Girls Collegiate School, Pietermaritzburg - references to males replaced with female one&#x27;s.

In Thailand, at Vajiravudh College considered to be the country&#x27;s best boarding school built by King Rama VI (King Vajiravudh) in 1910, the &quot;tramp of twenty-two men&quot; became &quot;The Might of Thirty Best Men&quot; in reference to the school&#x27;s supremacy in Rugby. There are also lyrics in Thai which is sung each year before the King of Thailand at the Graduation Ceremony.

In Hong Kong, the melody is used by Queen&#x27;s College as its school song, with its lyrics written by Headmaster Mr. William Kay (1920). The school song of Heep Yunn School is also adapted from this song but its lyrics are in Chinese, rather than English which Queen&#x27;s College uses.

In Canada, the girls at Havergal College in Toronto also sing this at their candlelight ceremony - a &quot;passing of the torch&quot; between the incoming and outgoing graduating classes.

A shortened and slightly altered version of this song is used near the beginning of the 2010 film adaptation of &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot;.

<text>James Mark Ward (born June 28, 1941) is an American body piercer. In a 2004 documentary, entitled &quot;The Social History of Piercing&quot;, MTV called him &quot;the granddaddy of the modern body piercing movement.&quot;

==Early years==
Ward was born in 1941 in Western Oklahoma and moved to Colorado when he was eleven.
In 1967, in New York he joined the New York Motorbike Club, a gay S&amp;M group, and experimented with nipple piercing. During this time he also studied jewelry making. Ward then moved to Colorado, where he joined the gay Rocky Mountaineer Motorcycle Club and further experimented with piercing, genital in particular. In 1973, Ward moved to West Hollywood (a gay village of Los Angeles) where he met Doug Malloy. Together they developed the basic techniques and equipment that have become piercing industry standard.

==Innovations==
Ward pioneered many jewelry designs including the fixed bead ring and internally threaded barbells. He was introduced to barbell style jewelry by Horst Streckenbach (&quot;Tattoo Samy&quot;), a tattooist and piercer from Frankfurt, Germany, and his student Manfred &quot;Tattoo&quot; Kohrs from Hanover, Germany.

Ward stated, &quot;The first barbells I recall came from Germany. Doug had made contact with Tattoo Samy, a tattooist and piercer from Frankfurt. Over the years Samy came to the States a number of times and frequently showed up in LA to visit Doug. On one of his first visits he showed us the barbell studs that he used in some piercings. They were internally threaded, a feature that made so much sense that I immediately set out to recreate them for my own customers.&quot;

With funding from Malloy (derived from his work with the Muzak corporation), Ward began using his home as a private piercing studio in 1975. Dubbing his studio the Gauntlet, he drew an initial clientele from a mailing list provided by Doug and by running classified ads in local gay and fetish publications. After three years of continued refinement with techniques and equipment, Ward opened the Gauntlet as a commercial storefront operation in West Hollywood on 17 November 1978. The establishment of this business — considered the first of its type in the United States — was the beginning of the body piercing industry.

In 1977, with the assistance of Malloy and Fakir Musafar, Ward started the piercing magazine &quot;Piercing Fans International Quarterly&quot; (&quot;PFIQ&quot;).

==Honors== 
In 2020, he was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame.

He is an inductee of the Society of Janus Hall of Fame.

<text>Giuseppe &quot;Joe&quot; Profaci (; October 2, 1897 – June 6, 1962) was an Italian-American Cosa Nostra boss who was the founder of what became the Colombo crime family of New York City. Established in 1928, this was the last of the Five Families to be organized. He was the family&#x27;s boss for over three decades.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Giuseppe Profaci was born in Villabate, in the Province of Palermo, Sicily, on October 2, 1897. In 1920, Profaci spent one year in prison in Palermo on theft charges.

===Family ties===
Profaci&#x27;s sons were Frank Profaci and John Profaci Sr. Frank eventually joined the Profaci crime family while John Sr. followed legitimate pursuits. Two of Profaci&#x27;s daughters married the sons of Detroit Partnership mobsters William Tocco and Joseph Zerilli.

Profaci&#x27;s brother was Salvatore Profaci, who served as his &quot;consigliere&quot; for years, and is known to have been heavily into dealing of pornographic materials. One of Profaci&#x27;s brothers-in-law was Joseph Magliocco, who would eventually become Profaci&#x27;s underboss. Profaci&#x27;s niece Rosalie Profaci was married to Salvatore Bonanno, the son of Bonanno crime family boss Joseph Bonanno. Profaci was the uncle of Salvatore Profaci Jr., also a member of the Profaci crime family.

Rosalie Profaci offered the following description of her uncle:

He was a flamboyant man who smoked big cigars, drove big black Cadillacs, and did things like buy tickets to a Broadway play for us cousins. But he didn&#x27;t buy two or three or even four seats, he bought a whole row. 

Released from prison in 1921, Profaci emigrated to the United States, arriving in New York City on September 4. Profaci settled in Chicago, where he opened a grocery store and bakery. However, the business was unsuccessful, and in 1925, Profaci relocated to New York, where he entered the olive oil import business. On September 27, 1927, Profaci became a United States citizen. At some point after his move to Brooklyn, Profaci became involved with local gangs.

===Rise to family boss===
On December 5, 1928, Profaci attended a mob meeting in Cleveland, Ohio. The agenda of the meeting included resolving conflicts arising from assassinations, and a vote on recognition of the Profaci crime family in Brooklyn. The 1963 McClellan hearings introduced some erroneous facts about the origins of the Profaci family, one being that it was an offshoot of Maranzano&#x27;s crime family. His brother-in-law, Joe Magliocco, was Profaci&#x27;s second-in-command.

Given Profaci&#x27;s lack of experience in organized crime, it is unclear why the New York gangs gave him power in Brooklyn. Some speculated that Profaci received this position due to his family&#x27;s status in Sicily, where they may have belonged to the Villabate Mafia. Profaci may have also benefited from contacts made through his olive oil business. Cleveland police eventually raided the meeting and expelled the mobsters from Cleveland, but Profaci&#x27;s business was accomplished.

By 1930, Profaci was controlling numbers, prostitution, loansharking, and narcotics trafficking in Brooklyn. In 1930, the Castellammarese War broke out in New York City. Some sources say that Profaci remained neutral, while others say that Profaci was firmly aligned with Castellammarese boss Salvatore Maranzano. When the war finally ended in 1931, top mobster Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano reorganized the New York gangs into five organized crime families. At this point, Profaci was recognized as boss of what was now the Profaci crime family, with Magliocco as underboss and Salvatore Profaci as &quot;consigliere&quot;.

When Luciano created the National Crime Syndicate, also known as the Mafia Commission, he gave Profaci a seat on the governing board. Profaci&#x27;s closest ally on the board was Bonanno, who would cooperate with Profaci over the next 30 years. Profaci was also allied with Stefano Magaddino, the boss of the Buffalo crime family.

===Business and faith===
Profaci obtained most of his wealth through traditional illegal enterprises such as protection rackets and extortion. However, to protect himself from federal tax evasion charges, Profaci still maintained his original olive oil business, known as Mamma Mia Importing Company, leading to his nickname as &quot;Olive Oil King&quot;. As the demand for olive oil skyrocketed after World War II, his business thrived. Profaci owned 20 other businesses that employed hundreds of workers in New York.

Profaci owned a large house in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, a home in Miami Beach, Florida, and a estate near Hightstown, New Jersey, which previously belonged to President Theodore Roosevelt. Profaci&#x27;s estate had its own airstrip and a chapel with an altar that replicated one in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome.

Profaci was a devout Catholic who made generous cash donations to Catholic charities. A member of the Knights of Columbus, Profaci would invite priests to his estate to celebrate Mass. In May 1952, a thief stole valuable jeweled crowns from the Regina Pacis Votive shrine in Brooklyn. Profaci sent his men to recover the crowns and reportedly kill the thief. However, accounts of the thief being strangled with a rosary are unfounded.

In 1949, the Vatican received a petition from a group of New York Catholics to confer a knighthood on Profaci. However, when the Brooklyn District Attorney complained about the move, the Vatican denied the petition.

===Legal problems===
In 1953, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service sued Profaci for over $1.5 million in unpaid income taxes. The taxes were still unpaid when Profaci died nine years later.

In 1954, the US Department of Justice moved to revoke Profaci&#x27;s citizenship. The government claimed that when Profaci entered the United States in 1921, he lied to immigration officials about having no arrest record in Italy. In 1960, a U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Profaci&#x27;s deportation order, ending the legal action.

In 1956, law enforcement recorded a phone conversation between Profaci and Antonio Cottone, a Sicilian mafioso, about exporting Sicilian oranges to the United States. In 1959, US Customs agents intercepted one of those orange crates in New York. The crate contained 90 wax oranges containing a total of pure heroin. Smugglers in Sicily had filled the hollow oranges with heroin until they weighed as much as real oranges, then packed them in the crate. Profaci was never prosecuted for this crime.

In 1957, Profaci attended the Apalachin Conference, a national mob meeting, at the farm of mobster Joseph Barbara in Apalachin, New York. While the conference was in progress, New York State Troopers surrounded the farm and raided it. Profaci was one of over 60 mobsters arrested that day. On January 13, 1960, Profaci and 21 others were convicted of conspiracy and he was sentenced to five years in prison. However, on November 28, 1960, a United States Court of Appeals overturned the verdicts.

===First Colombo war===
In contrast to Profaci&#x27;s generosity to his relatives and the church, many of his men considered him miserly and mean with money. One reason for their rancor was that Profaci required each family member to pay him a $25 a month tithe, an old Sicilian gang custom. The money, which amounted to approximately $50,000 a month, was meant to support the families of mobsters in prison. However, most of this money stayed with Profaci. In addition, Profaci did not tolerate any dissent from his policies, and people who expressed discontent were murdered.

On February 27, 1961, the Gallos, led by Joe Gallo, kidnapped four of Profaci&#x27;s top men: underboss Magliocco, Frank Profaci (Joe Profaci&#x27;s brother), capo Salvatore Musacchia and soldier John Scimone. Profaci himself eluded capture and flew to sanctuary in Florida. While holding the hostages, Larry and Albert Gallo sent Joe Gallo to California. The Gallos demanded a more favorable financial scheme for the hostages&#x27; release. Gallo wanted to kill one hostage and demand $100,000 before negotiations, but his brother Larry overruled him. After a few weeks of negotiation, Profaci made a deal with the Gallos. Profaci&#x27;s consigliere Charles &quot;the Sidge&quot; LoCicero negotiated with the Gallos and all the hostages were released peacefully. However, Profaci had no intention of honoring this peace agreement. On August 20, 1961, Joseph Profaci ordered the murder of Gallo members Joseph &quot;Joe Jelly&quot; Gioielli and Larry Gallo. Gunmen allegedly murdered Gioielli after inviting him to go fishing. Larry Gallo survived a strangulation attempt in the Sahara club of East Flatbush by Carmine Persico and Salvatore &quot;Sally&quot; D&#x27;Ambrosio after a police officer intervened. The Gallo brothers had been previously aligned with Persico against Profaci and his loyalists; The Gallos then began calling Persico &quot;The Snake&quot; after he had betrayed them. the war continued on resulting in nine murders and three disappearances. With the start of the gang war, the Gallo crew retreated to the Dormitory.

===Mob standoff===
By 1962, Profaci&#x27;s health was failing. In early 1962, Carlo Gambino and Lucchese crime family boss Tommy Lucchese tried to convince Profaci to resign to end the gang war. However, Profaci strongly suspected that the two bosses were secretly supporting the Gallo brothers and wanted to take control of his family. Profaci vehemently refused to resign; furthermore, he warned that any attempt to remove him would spark a wider gang war. Gambino and Lucchese did not pursue their efforts.

===Death===
On June 6, 1962, Profaci died in South Side Hospital in Bay Shore, New York of liver cancer. He is buried at Saint John Cemetery in the Middle Village section of Queens, in one of the largest mausoleums in the cemetery.

After Profaci&#x27;s death, Magliocco succeeded him as head of the family. In late 1963, the Mafia Commission forced Magliocco out of office and installed Joseph Colombo as family boss. At this point, the Profaci crime family became the Colombo crime family.

<doc id="1215818" wikidata="Q1353938" url="?curid=1215818" title="Hummer H1">
<text>The Hummer H1 is a full-size four-wheel-drive utility vehicle based on the M998 Humvee, which was developed by AM General when it was a subsidiary of American Motors Corporation (AMC). Originally designed strictly for military use, the off-road vehicle was released to the civilian market.

The civilian version was produced from 1992 through 2006 and was the first of what became the Hummer line. AM General built both the H1 and the Humvee in its Mishawaka, Indiana, facility. GM stopped marketing the H1 in the 2006 model year, but AM General continued production of the military Humvee versions through 2018.

==History==
On March 22, 1983, AM General Corporation was awarded a production contract for 55,000 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV). Nicknamed the Humvee, the vehicles were used by the U.S. military and featured in photographs from the Persian Gulf War during the early 1990s. The vehicle was also promoted by actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was so interested in the Humvee design that he specifically advocated for AM General to produce a civilian version of the vehicle. After the Gulf War was over, AM General modified the M998 Humvee military version for the civilian marketplace powered by 6.2 L GM Diesel V8 engine. The civilian version of the Humvee, marketed as the Hummer, went on sale in 1992. The interior was largely influenced by semi-trucks. 

Under a 1999 deal, General Motors bought marketing rights to the Hummer name, began marketing Hummer-branded vehicles designed by GM, and rebadged the original version built by AM General as the Hummer H1. At the time, GM began marketing the Hummer H2 that was also assembled by AM General on a modified GMC Sierra 2500HD chassis.

General Motors announced that 2006 would be the last model year for the Hummer H1, with civilian market production winding down in June 2006 due to new emission regulations for diesel-engined vehicles that were to take effect in 2007. The final 2006 models had the most powerful engine and also improved fuel efficiency—about . 

AM General continued the production of military Humvee versions until 2018.

==Specifications==
The Hummer H1 was available in three major variants: a convertible-like soft top, a four-door hard top Sport Utility Truck, and an &quot;Alpha Wagon&quot; body version. Less known variants were a two-door pickup truck and a four-door slantback, which shares the same body style as the Humvee employed by the U.S. military. The convertible/soft top and the station SUV versions were the last types available to individual consumers.

There were five engine types and three automatic transmission types available. Typical engine/automatic transmission combinations included:

* 5.7 L (350 ci) &quot;L05&quot; gasoline V8 TBI/GM 4L80-E 4-speed
* 6.2 L &quot;GM Diesel&quot; V8/GM TH400/3L80 3-speed
* 6.5 L &quot;GM Diesel&quot; V8/GM 4L80-E 4-speed
* 6.5 L turbo &quot;GM Diesel&quot; V8/GM 4L80-E 4-speed
* 6.6 L turbo &quot;Duramax LLY&quot; V8 turbo Diesel/Allison 1000 5-speed (2006 only)

The Hummer H1 shares some common driveline parts with the HMMWV. These include brakes, axles, and frame, as well as major body panels (hood, tailgate, and quarter panels) that are shared between the HMMWV and Hummer H1. All H1s and HMMWVs were produced on the same assembly line; of which the civilian H1s were painted and finished in a separate building.

The H1 models feature a wide track and 86.5 in width due to the original Humvees necessity to be able to drive in the tracks left by military tanks. They can ford of water and climb a step. The standard ground clearance is achieved by positioning driveline components high inside a wide channel in the center of the passenger compartment, meaning that despite the large interior volume, the H1 only had seating for four. Approach and departure angles are 72 and 37.5 degrees. A Central Tire Inflation System (CTIS) controls the tire air pressure allowing lower tire pressures for off-road and higher tire pressures on-road.

Other features include inboard brakes and portal gears to position drivetrain&#x27;s half shafts higher for greater ground clearance. The radiator is mounted high, sloping over the engine on a forward-hinged hood. The air intake is high, enabling the H1 to ford waist-level water. Options included magnesium-aluminum alloy or rubber inserts for run-flat tire ability. Other options include leather seats, a winch kit, and running boards.

==2006 H1 Alpha==
The &quot;Alpha&quot; was a re-engineered H1 equipped with GM&#x27;s 6.6 L Duramax Diesel and 5-speed Allison transmission. This replaced the previous GM 6.5 L diesel engine.

The update program commenced in late 2002 with a production launch in the fall of 2004. To fit into the H1 engine bay, 23 engine component changes were incorporated as well as a body lift to accommodate the taller engine and its turbo housing (a prior lift had been done for MY96 to accommodate the turbo on the 6.5 L engine). The 8th digit of the VIN is 3, setting this version of the 6.6L Duramax apart from the versions used in pickup trucks. The GMT560 engine output was and of torque. The engine was equipped with cooled exhaust gas recirculation and an internal engine oil cooler, thus, requiring a 40% heat rejection increase to engine coolant. Because space was limited between the air-lift brackets that protruded from the hood, the fan system was modified by putting it directly under the cool pack and driving it through a special gearbox directly off the crankshaft damper pulley. Several other cooling system modifications were required to assist with cold starting from .

Other major modifications included the use of special high-strength steel in the chassis frame, a more powerful steering gear; quieter axle differentials, redesign of the geared hubs to use quieter helical gears, new induction, exhaust, and electrical power systems; and re-engineering of the fuel supply and filtration system.

The Duramax engine delivered more torque at lower engine speeds than the 6.5 L, combined with a lower gearing ratio (about 44.5 to 1 in the low lock) made the vehicle more powerful. Other changes included centralized tire inflation and a new interior.

Production launch was early in 2005 with vehicles built classified as model year 2006 - the 10th digit in VIN is a 6.

The program was canceled in May 2006, because sales of the nearly $129,000 vehicle had not improved, with production ending in June 2006.

==The Hummer brand==
On June 2, 2009, General Motors attempted a sale of its Hummer brand to a Chinese company, Tengzhong, as part of its bankruptcy settlement. By October 2009, an agreement was reached following a year-long effort by GM to unload a brand &quot;that had become synonymous with gas-guzzling excess.&quot;

On February 24, 2010, General Motors announced that the company was shutting down its Hummer brand due to Tengzhong withdrawing its bid. Tengzhong stated that the bid was withdrawn due to a failure to get approval from the Chinese government.

On January 30, 2020, General Motors announced the revival of the Hummer nameplate, which would be used as a new electric off-road vehicle within its GMC brand. The new vehicle, now known as the GMC Hummer EV, will have two variants, an SUV and a truck (&quot;SUT&quot;).

==Production ==
While there was no 2005 model year Hummer H1, the 2006 model year H1 Alphas were manufactured in both 2005 and 2006. A total of 448 H1 Alphas were produced from January through May 2005, and 281 H1 Alphas were produced from September 2005 through May 2006, when the production for the Hummer H1 officially ended.

in 2017, VLF Automotive was contracted to build about 100 H1s from kits supplied by AM General. Called the Humvee C-Series, these will be exported to Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and China.

<text>Sir Thomas Tresham (died 8 March 1559) was a leading Catholic politician during the middle of the Tudor dynasty in England.

==Family==
Thomas Tresham was the eldest son of John Tresham of Rushton Hall, Northamptonshire, and Elizabeth Harrington, daughter of Sir James Harrington, of Hornby, Lancashire.

==Career==
Tresham was knighted by 1524. He was chosen Sheriff in 1524, 1539, 1548 and 1555/6, and returned as a Member of Parliament for Northamptonshire in 1541 and twice in 1554. In 1530 he served on a Royal Commission inquiring into Cardinal Wolsey&#x27;s possessions. In 1537 he served on another to inquire into the Lincolnshire rebellion.

In 1539 he was one of those appointed to receive Henry VIII&#x27;s future fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, at Calais. In 1540, he had licence to impark the Lyveden estate in the Aldwinkle St Peter&#x27;s parish, where the &quot;New Bield&quot; erected by his grandson Thomas Tresham II still stands.

In the same year, although his main estates were in Northamptonshire, it was noted that he had a house with twenty-nine household servants at Wolfeton in Charminster, Dorset.

In 1544 he supplied men for the king&#x27;s army in France, and a little later was one of the commissioners to collect the &quot;benevolence&quot; for the defense of the realm. In 1546 he was appointed assessor to the &quot;Contribution Commission&quot;, and was summoned to Court to meet the French ambassador. In 1549 he assisted in suppressing Kett&#x27;s Rebellion, and received £272, 19.6 for his services.

On 18 July 1553, he proclaimed Queen Mary at Northampton, and accompanied her on her entry into London. He was one of those appointed on 3 August 1553, &quot;to staye the assemblies in Royston and other places of Cambridgeshire&quot;. That year he was also MP for Lancaster.

He was named Grand Prior of England in the Order of Knights Hospitallers of St John of Jerusalem by Royal Charter dated 2 April 1557, qualifying him for a seat in the House of Lords. It was not till 30 November that the order was re-established in England with four knights under him, and he was solemnly invested. In the meantime, Sir Richard Shelley had been made turcopolier at Malta. The order was endowed by the queen with lands to the yearly value of £1436. He took his seat in the House of Lords in January, 1557–58, but sent a proxy to the first parliament of Queen Elizabeth, possibly due to illness. He died in 1559. He was buried at All Saints Church, Rushton, Northamptonshire with great pomp on 16 March 1559.

==Marriages and issue==
He married firstly Mary Parr, youngest daughter and co-heir of William Parr, 1st Baron Parr of Horton, by whom he had three sons:

*John Tresham, who died in the lifetime of his father. His son, also named Sir Thomas Tresham, succeeded his grandfather.
*William Tresham.

He married, secondly, Lettice Peniston, widow, successively, of Sir Robert Knollys and Sir Robert Lee (d. 1539), and daughter of Sir Thomas Peniston of Hawridge. She predeceased him without issue.

<doc id="1215824" wikidata="Q7082048" url="?curid=1215824" title="Okir">
<text>Okir, also spelled okil or ukkil, is the term for rectilinear and curvilinear plant-based designs and folk motifs that can be usually found among the Moro and Lumad people of the Southern Philippines, as well as parts of Sabah. It is particularly associated with the artwork of the Maranao and Sama (Badjao) tribes, although it can also be found to a lesser extent among the Maguindanao, Iranun, Tausug, Yakan, and Lumad groups. The design elements vary among these ethnic groups, with the greatest refinement being found among the Maranao.

==History==

The origins of &quot;okir&quot; are pre-Islamic. They are believed to have originated from the much earlier &quot;okil&quot; or &quot;okil-okil&quot; decorative carving traditions of the Sama (Badjao) people, which are often highly individualistic and rectilinear. The Sama are master carvers, and they made lavish decorations on ritual animistic objects, grave markers (both in wood and stone), and their houseboats. These precursor forms of the &quot;okir&quot; designs can still be found in the art traditions of the Maranao in the &quot;basak&quot; (lowland) regions of Lake Lanao, and they contrast markedly from the later flowing &quot;okir&quot; designs.

The rectilinear designs of the Sama were adopted and refined by the Maranao to decorate the &quot;torogan&quot; houses of the ruling &quot;dato&quot; class. The most prominent parts of the &quot;torogan&quot; are the &quot;panolong&quot;, the carved floor beams modeled after &quot;awang&quot; boat prows. These protrude in the front of the house and styled with elaborate &quot;okir&quot; designs, usually that of a &quot;naga&quot; (a sea serpent or dragon). These were meant to drive away evil spirits. &quot;Okir&quot; were also featured in the central housebeam, the &quot;tinai a walai&quot; (&quot;intestine of the house&quot;), which had ritual significance. 

Unlike the decorative carving traditions of the Sama, the &quot;panolong&quot; of the &quot;torogan&quot; became a symbol of power and status. As such, they increasingly became more and more elaborate, developing the flowing characteristics that it possesses today. It influenced other Maranao artforms greatly due to its association with rank and prestige, becoming used in textiles, musical instruments, betel quid containers, sculptures, weaponry, silver inlays, and so on. These designs became the standard for what came to be known as &quot;okir&quot;. 

From the Maranao, this spread to nearby regions through the migrations of the Iranun people (the descendants of the merchant and outcast clans of Maranao). Elements of &quot;okir&quot; have been adopted by the neighboring Maguindanao, Lumad, Yakan, and Tausug peoples of the Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago; even influencing the carving traditions of the Sama later on. However, it had limited penetration among the Visayan-descended heavily-Islamized Tausug, the dominant ethnic group of Sulu. They viewed such carvings as &quot;pagan&quot;. &quot;Okir&quot; among the Tausug is usually limited to the hilts and scabbards of weapons.

The older Sama carving traditions (&quot;okil&quot; or &quot;okil-okil&quot;, sometimes spelled &quot;ukkil&quot; among Malaysian Sama) differ markedly from the &quot;okir&quot; of the Maranao, although elements of the &quot;okir&quot; were incorporated into later Sama carvings. Sama &quot;okil&quot; aren&#x27;t bound to rules like the &quot;okir&quot;, and thus tend to be highly variable. Each artist carves according to his own tastes. Despite this, there are still shared motifs that bind them all together as Sama.
Sama &quot;okil&quot; can be divided into two types. The most ancient &quot;okil&quot; which still survive among the animist Sama, usually the sea-going Sama Dilaut branches, feature representational artforms like human figures. These are absent in the &quot;okil&quot; versions of the Sama that converted to Islam. Sama &quot;okil&quot; also feature designs which are realistic copies of natural forms, rather than stylized designs like in &quot;okir&quot;. Marine themes are particularly common, including depictions of dugongs (&quot;duyong&quot;), usually with a person riding on its back. The three most common &quot;okil&quot; motifs used by the Muslim Sama are &quot;dauan-dauan&quot; (leaf motifs), &quot;kaloon&quot; (curlicues and curved lines), and &quot;agta-agta&quot; or &quot;buaya&quot; (fish or crocodile motifs).

Nevertheless, Sama &quot;okil&quot; share some common motifs with &quot;okir&quot;. The Maranao &quot;naga&quot; (sea serpent) figure is believed to be related to the Sama &quot;agta-agta&quot; motifs. They are a particularly common motif in the beautifully-carved prows, sterns, and gunwales of various Sama-Bajau boats. 

&quot;Okil&quot; are also highly important among Sama grave markers (&quot;sunduk&quot;) which are found in the ancient traditional burial grounds of the Sama people in some (usually uninhabited) islands of Sulu and Tawi-Tawi. These include some of the oldest examples of &quot;okil&quot;, which are usually carved from coral and limestone. Wooden carved grave markers are common later on, usually made from or carved from the boat belonging to the deceased. These are usually carved into human figures that represent the deceased. With graves of women identifiable by the presence of combs and mirrors, and graves of men by the depiction of head coverings. Graves of children usually have smaller figures. A common relatively recent tradition is the carving of elaborate stylized bed frames as grave markers. These graves are often decorated with buntings and food offerings, again reflecting the ancient ancestor worship (&quot;anito&quot;) traditions of the Sama.

===Maranao===

Maranao &quot;okir&quot; motifs are so stylized that it is often easy to tell whether a carving is Maranao or not. Other ethnic groups usually introduce other elements or motifs that are non-traditional to the original Maranao &quot;okir&quot; designs. In the past, &quot;okir&quot; designs, particularly for textiles, are distinctive enough that a Maranao can usually distinguish which region someone is from based only on the patterns of their &quot;malong&quot; and their woven decorative strips (&quot;langkit&quot;).

Maranao &quot;okir&quot; can be divided into two traditions, the predominantly curvilinear &quot;male&quot; &quot;okir-a-dato&quot;, and the predominantly rectilinear &quot;female&quot; &quot;okir-a-bai&quot;. Unlike Sama &quot;okil&quot;, &quot;okir&quot; designs are deliberately stylized when depicting living things, due to Islamic beliefs against idolatry. Traditional creatures featured in &quot;okir&quot; are the &quot;naga&quot; (sea serpent) and the &quot;sarimanok&quot; (feminine &quot;papanok&quot;, a rooster-like bird with a fish in its beak and another fish in its claws). The &quot;naga&quot; is common in the &quot;panolong&quot; designs, while &quot;sarimanok&quot; are usually placed on top of poles during celebrations. Other creature motifs traditionally depicted in &quot;okir&quot; include crocodiles, parrots, grasshopper heads, and swallowtails. After contact with other cultures, &quot;okir&quot; has also depicted non-native animals, including lions, peacocks, and elephants. 

The most common individual elements of &quot;okir&quot; include the following:
;Male (&quot;okir-a-dato&quot;)

*&quot;Dapal&quot; or &quot;raon&quot; - a leaf
*&quot;Dianawi&quot; - a pattern resembling a &quot;nawi&quot;, a bladed carpenter&#x27;s tool
*&quot;Gaglat&quot; - a pattern resembling a &quot;glat&quot;, a small kitchen knife
*&quot;Kianoko&quot; - fingernail-like patterns
*&quot;Matilak&quot; - a circle
*&quot;Naga&quot; - a sea serpent in the shape of an &#x27;S&#x27;
*&quot;Onga&quot; - fruit
*&quot;Pako&quot; - a fern frond or a spiral
*&quot;Pako lawi&quot; - a fern frond resembling a rooster feather
*&quot;Pako longat&quot; - a fern frond with a cut at one edge
*&quot;Pako nai&quot; - a fern frond with two or more cuts on one edge
*&quot;Piowas&quot; - betel nut seed
*&quot;Potyok&quot; - a bud
*&quot;Todi&quot; - a flower

;Female (&quot;okir-a-bai&quot;)

*&quot;Olan-olan&quot; - a circle or moon
*&quot;Biangon&quot; - rectangle
*&quot;Pialang&quot; - square
*&quot;Katimbuang&quot; - diamond
*&quot;Onsod&quot; - zigzag
These elements can be put together to create motifs. Some examples include:

;Male
*Armalis - a combination of a fern, leaf, and bud
*Birdo - a motif of combined complex designs propagating horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
*Magoyoda - a motif of simple elements repeating horizontally
*Niaga - a motif which features the &quot;naga&quot; along with &quot;todi&quot; designs of leaves, vines, and flowers
*Obid-obid or tiali-tali - rope-like designs that are usually used for borders
*Pako rabong - a motif of a fern growing vertically, with a central point from which the design radiates outwards

;Female
*Binotoon - star patterns
*Pinagapat - four-sided designs in a series
*Pinatola - a pattern of squares of different colors
*Saragonting - a cross

Complete designs using these motifs are usually given poetic names like &quot;sapak a madanding&quot; (&quot;branch of happiness&quot;), &quot;raon a kayo&quot; (&quot;tree leaves&quot;) or &quot;tring indawa&quot; (&quot;yellow bamboo&quot;).

==Modern traditions==
&quot;Okir&quot;-carving traditions among the Maranao is prominent in the town of Tugaya, Lanao del Sur. It is the traditional center of Maranao artisans and is the industrial capital of Lanao del Sur.

<doc id="1215825" wikidata="Q3219878" url="?curid=1215825" title="Lawn, Newfoundland and Labrador">
<text>Lawn, (population 583 ), is a town located at the tip of the Burin Peninsula on Newfoundland&#x27;s South coast, Newfoundland and Labrador. Lawn is spread around a small harbour in a relatively lush valley. According to one local tradition it was this lushness that inspired Captain James Cook to name the place Lawn Harbour. But it has also been speculated that a Frenchman named the community after a doe caribou that he spotted there.

Lawn is a community whose survival over the past two hundred years has depended entirely on the fishery. The abundance of fish in the waters surrounding Lawn (formerly known as Laun) attracted seasonal fishermen from France, Portugal, Spain and England. These fishermen came over in large fishing ships and returned to their homelands in the fall. This type of migratory fishery continued to exist on the Burin Peninsula well into the eighteen hundreds. However, in 1763 an important event occurred which had a tremendous impact on the development of permanent settlements on the Burin Peninsula.
The town of Lawn was formed as Community Council in 1952 and was changed to a Town Council in 1968.

== History ==
One of Newfoundland&#x27;s first hydroelectric generators was commissioned in Lawn in 1930.

=== 1942 naval disaster ===
In the pre-dawn hours of February 18, 1942, three United States Navy ships ran aground on the shore of the Burin Peninsula between Lawn and the nearby community of St. Lawrence. It was determined that the USS &quot;Pollux&quot;, USS &quot;Truxtun&quot; and USS &quot;Wilkes&quot; made a navigation error while en route to Naval Station Argentia. Under exceptionally difficult storm and ice conditions eight residents of Lawn assisted in the rescue of survivors. 185 sailors survived and 203 died as a result of the disaster.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Lawn had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="1215827" wikidata="Q7127075" url="?curid=1215827" title="Pale Sun, Crescent Moon">
<text>Pale Sun, Crescent Moon is the fifth studio album by Canadian country rock band Cowboy Junkies, released in 1993. It was the band&#x27;s last album of new material for RCA Records, although a live album and a were subsequently released on the label. Canadian guitarist Ken Myhr appears on every track on this album.

== Album development ==
The Cowboy Junkies created the album within months of getting off the road from the &quot;Black Eyed Man&quot; tour. While touring, Michael Timmins started work on several new songs, and after getting home he cleaned up and finished the tracks. Ken Myhr, who had been on the last tour with the band, was invited to join the band in working out arrangements for the songs. In April over the Easter weekend the four band members and Ken went to Studio 306 in Toronto, operated by Bob Cobban, to record the basic tracks in three very long sessions. The band had previously worked with Cobban at Studio 306 when recording &quot;Lost My Driving Wheel&quot;. After the initial sessions, the band started working on the overdub sessions, which were spread out over the next few weeks. In this cycle, Michael Timmins and Myhr added more guitar, Margo added some harmonies, Jeff Bird added embellishments, and Richard Bell added a keyboard. Richard Bell had been in the industry for a while, working with The Band, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and can be heard on Janis Joplin&#x27;s album &quot;Pearl.&quot; He added a classic style of rock with his piano and organ work during the recording sessions. The album from conception to final mixing is one of the quickest the band created. One goal with the album was to raise the volume a bit from the Junkies earlier albums. With every album, they try to add a different element, and for this album, they opened the album with a power chord.

&quot;Pale Sun, Crescent Moon&quot; is about male-female relationships. The track show different faces of relationships, showcasing mystical with &quot;Crescent Moon&quot;, reality with &quot;First Recollection&quot; and &quot;Ring on the Sill&quot;, romantic with &quot;Anniversary Song&quot; and &quot;White Sail&quot;, investigates dark corners with &quot;Seven Years&quot;, &quot;Pale Sun&quot;, and &quot;The Post&quot;, moves on to metaphysical with &quot;Cold Tea Blues&quot;, delves into the unexplainable with &quot;Hard to Explain&quot; and &quot;Hunted&quot;, and finally ends with a song showcasing the distrust between one man and one woman in &quot;Floorboard Blues&quot;. Margo Timmins describes the theme of the album as &quot; &quot;is that there is love and there is all that conspires to steal love away.&quot;

<text>Edward Timothy Razzall, Baron Razzall, (born 12 June 1943), is a British Liberal Democrat politician and parliamentarian.

==Early life==
He was the son of Humphrey Razzall, a Liberal Party member who stood as Liberal Parliamentary Candidate for Scarborough and Whitby in the 1945 general election.

Razzall attended St Paul&#x27;s School, London, before going to Worcester College, Oxford, representing the university at cricket in 1964.

==Career==
Razzall qualified as a solicitor in 1969 and worked for Frere Cholmeley (later Frere Cholmeley Bischoff), becoming a partner in 1973, and chief executive in 1990 before leaving in 1995 to set up his own corporate finance business (Argonaut Associates). Frere Cholmeley Bischoff encountered financial difficulties and dissolved shortly after his departure, for which some blame was attributed to Razzall.

In 1974, he was elected as a councillor for Mortlake ward in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, which he represented for 24 years. During that time, he served as chair of Richmond Council&#x27;s Policy and Resources Committee for 13 years and as deputy leader 1983–1996. He was succeeded in both roles by Serge Lourie.

In 1986, he became joint-treasurer of the Liberal Party, and then treasurer of the newly merged Liberal Democrats in 1988. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1993 New Year Honours and created a life peer on 22 October 1997 as Baron Razzall, &quot;of Mortlake in the London Borough of Richmond&quot;. In July 2002, he was the best man at the marriage of Charles Kennedy (the then Liberal Democrat Leader) to Sarah Gurling.

From 2000 to 2006, he was chair of the Liberal Democrats&#x27; Campaigns and Communications Committee. Along with Lord Rennard, he was responsible for running the Liberal Democrats&#x27; election campaigns. He stepped down from this post in May 2006, saying he wanted a change and to give his successor a chance to settle into the role before the 2010 general election.

A former House of Lords Liberal Democrat Spokesman on Trade and Industry and Treasurer of the All Party Parliamentary Intellectual Property Group in Parliament, he now serves on various parliamentary committees.

Razzall married first in 1965 (divorced 1974) Elizabeth Christina née Wilkinson, and they had a daughter, journalist Katie Razzall, and a son, James Razzall. Through his marriage in 1982 (dissolved 2003) to Deirdre Martineau née Taylor-Smith, he became step-father to her two sons and two daughters. In 2008 he was reported to be the partner of Jane Bonham Carter, Baroness Bonham-Carter of Yarnbury. Bonham-Carter has declared the relationship in the House of Lords Register of Interests.

==Memoirs==
His memoirs, &quot;Chance Encounters,&quot; were published in October 2014.

==Controversy==
Lord Razzall attracted criticism in 2008 when it was revealed that he and his partner, Jane Bonham-Carter, a fellow life peer, had both claimed House of Lords expenses for a flat that they shared, although it was not claimed that a breach of the rules had occurred. The House of Lords expenses system was later changed to give peers a flat rate irrespective of their residence.

<text>Teresa de la Parra (October 5, 1889 – April 23, 1936) was a Venezuelan novelist.

==Life==
She was born Ana Teresa Parra Sanojo in Paris, the daughter of Rafael Parra Hernáiz, Venezuelan Ambassador in Berlin, and Isabel Sanojo de Parra.

As a member of a wealthy family, Ana Teresa spent part of her childhood at her father&#x27;s hacienda &quot;Tazón&quot;. After the death of her father, Ana Teresa and her sisters were taken by their mother to study at the Sacred Heart School, in Godella, Spain. Under fervent religious precepts, they received a solid education, suitable for upper-class young ladies. Ana Teresa returned to Caracas at the age of 19.

After she settled in Paris, de la Parra travelled and had an intense social life. She began to research a biography of Simón Bolívar, perhaps inspired by the centenary of his death. However, her idea was interrupted when she was diagnosed with tuberculosis. Teresa de la Parra wandered in several European sanatoriums, mainly in Switzerland and Spain, but did not find a cure. It was then that she met Cuban poet and anthropologist Lydia Cabrera who would play an important role in de la Parra&#x27;s life during her last years. She reflected about her philosophical and literary ideas, and studied her own work and life evolution through the years. 

Teresa de la Parra died in Madrid. Her remains were exhumed and brought to Caracas in 1947. In 1989, the 100th anniversary of her birth, she was reburied with honors at the National Pantheon in Caracas.

==Works==
She rebelled against the limited expectations for women of her class by long hours of reading and writing. Her fantastic stories were published in the newspaper &quot;El Universal&quot;, and her &quot;Diary of a Caraqueña in the Far East&quot; was published in the magazine &quot;Actualidades&quot;. De la Parra&#x27;s story &quot;Mama X&quot; earned first prize in a contest held in a provincial Venezuelan city. This story, as well as her &quot;Diary of a young lady who writes because she is bored&quot; (which was published in the magazine &quot;La Lectura Semanal&quot;) was the beginning of her first major work.

===&quot;Iphigenia&quot;===

De la Parra&#x27;s novel &quot;Iphigenia: Diary of a young lady who wrote because she was bored&quot;, published in 1924, marked a change in Venezuelan literature. Teresa de la Parra wrote most of the novel in 1921 and 1922 during the dictatorship of Juan Vicente Gómez. Some of the characters in the novel were maliciously close to caricatures of people who were then well known in Caracas society. The characters Abuelita, Tía Clara and César Leal represent strict adherence to morality. Ambitious and politically corrupt characters like Gabriel Olmedo and Tío Pancho also reflect moral freedom given to men, in contrast against the passive role assigned to women.

The protagonist of &quot;Iphigenia&quot;, María Eugenia Alonso, a well-educated and intelligent young woman, is partly a self-portrait of the author. María Eugenia struggles against being confined in a marriage that threatens to stifle her intellectual development. She strives to determine whether it is possible for an intelligent and educated woman to evade marriage without losing her respectability in a society where women are expected to become wives and mothers.

The tone, thematic nature and social-historic context of &quot;Iphigenia&quot; made it controversial among some social and literary circles in Venezuela and Colombia. Juan Vicente Gómez&#x27;s government would not give Venezuelan publishers money to publish &quot;Iphigenia&quot;. Teresa de la Parra travelled to Paris, where she had friends such as Simón Barceló, Alberto Zérega Fombona, Ventura García Calderón and Gonzalo Zaldumbide.

Winner of the annual award given by Casa Editora Franco-Ibero-Americana in Paris in 1924, Teresa de la Parra finally had her work published and received a prize of 10,000 French francs. &quot;Iphigenia&quot; became a categorical success among Parisian intellectuals and readers. It was soon translated into French. Two years after multiple trips and works — which included lectures in Nations Society and exquisite answers to critics — the writer began her second major work.

===&quot;Mama Blanca&#x27;s Memoirs&quot;===

&quot;Memorias de Mamá Blanca&quot; (&quot;Mama Blanca&#x27;s Memoirs&quot;), published in 1929, was a nostalgia-filled fictionalized memoir of De la Parra&#x27;s childhood. The spirit of the four sisters living on the hacienda &quot;Tazón&quot; is reflected in the six sisters living on the hacienda &quot;Piedra Azul&quot;. The moral &quot;correctness&quot; of &quot;Souvenirs of Mama Blanca&quot; received favorable attention from those who had criticized &quot;Iphigenia&quot;. In her letters, de la Parra wrote that there was no &quot;Iphigenia&quot; scent in &quot;Souvenirs of Mama Blanca&quot;, which had no protest speech, revolutionary ideas or social criticism.

De la Parra became a sought-after lecturer. Her more important speeches took place in Havana and Bogotá; this last one was very meaningful about her personal ideas of women&#x27;s roles in American society from colonial times to the 20th century.

<text>Replevin () or claim and delivery (sometimes called revendication) is a legal remedy which enables a person to recover personal property taken wrongfully or unlawfully, and to obtain compensation for resulting losses.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;replevin&quot; is of Anglo-Norman origin and is the noun form of the verb &quot;replevy&quot;. This comes from the Old French , derived from (&quot;to pledge&quot;), which is derived from the Latin (&quot;to redeem a thing taken by another&quot;).

==Nature==
In &quot;The Law of Torts&quot;, John Fleming has written:

In common law, several types of action existed with respect to deprivation of possession (being subdivided into the wrongful taking of chattels and the unjust detention of them, even where the original taking was lawful):

* In the case of wrongful taking:
** A writ of replevin was available only for an unlawful taking in the nature of a wrongful distress, where restitution could be made for the goods wrongfully taken (being in the nature of a redelivery of the pledge or the thing taken in distress) with damages for the loss sustained by such action. As distrained goods are in the custody of the law, any attempt to take them back by force without a writ of replevin could be contested by writ of &quot;rescous&quot; or &quot;de parco fracto&quot;, with a remedy in damages.
** A writ of trespass &quot;vi et armis&quot; was available in the taking of goods, with a remedy in damages.
** An action of trover and conversion was available for the non-forcible taking of goods, with a remedy in damages.
* In the case of unjust detention:
** Replevin lay to recover goods still held after a tender of amends.
** Detinue lay to recover lent goods where the holder refused to return them to the owner. However, the defendant was allowed to exculpate himself by oath, so this action was displaced by that of trover and conversion.

At common law, the ordinary action for the recovery of goods wrongfully taken was originally one of detinue, but no means of immediate recovery was possible until the action was tried. Replevin arose to deal with the matter of the illegal distress of goods for rent or &quot;damage feasant&quot;, in order to procure their restoration to the owner. Illegal distress has been held to occur where:

#no relationship of landlord and tenant exists at all,
#there is no demise at a fixed rent,
#no rent is due, or none due to the person who has distrained,
#goods have been released before the distress, or tendered before the impounding,
#the entry was illegal, or
#things privileged from distress (ie, neither goods nor chattel) have been seized.

Replevin will not lie where if any part of the rent claimed was due, but this defence is not effective where the only rent claimed by the landlord is not recoverable by distress.

It has been held that replevin applies to any wrongful taking of goods and chattel.

A party seeking relief may elect to adjudicate the right to possession prior to obtaining immediate relief to obtain the property in question. In such cases, replevin actions are still designed to afford the petitioning party a relatively speedy process for obtaining judgment, as compared to typical lawsuits. The summary remedy afforded by replevin statutes can be thwarted by defendants who contest the claimant&#x27;s right to possession, by contesting the plaintiff&#x27;s complaint, and insisting on traditional litigation involving discovery, and in some cases, trial by jury.

Replevin actions are often filed by secured creditors seeking to take possession of collateral securing loans or other debt instruments, such as retail installment contracts. A common example is where an automobile finance company initiates a replevin action to gain possession of a vehicle, following payment default. Replevin actions are usually employed when the lender cannot find the collateral, or cannot peacefully obtain it through self-help repossession. Replevin actions may also be pursued by true owners of property, e.g., consignors seeking return of consigned property that the party in possession will not relinquish for one reason or another.

Replevin is an action of civil law, not criminal law. Therefore, because of the differing standard of proof, a defendant found not guilty of criminal theft may nevertheless be required to return the disputed item or items in civil court.

Replevin does not provide compensation for any monetary loss arising from the loss of use of some income-producing property item. Replevin involves return of an actual specific item or items, not monetary compensation for loss. Thus, it would not normally be used in a case regarding a sum of money, as distinct from the loss of a rare coin, for instance, where the return of the actual coin itself was at issue. In occasional cases of no particular numismatic interest, however, &quot;e.g.,&quot; a bag of money whose contents have not yet been counted, an action may be filed to recover the actual coins and/or bills in question if they are still together.

The question of replevin becomes moot should the item in question no longer exist as an entity, &quot;i.e.&quot; if it is destroyed, or in the case of a bag of money, for instance, if the money has been spent. For this reason, the item is normally seized by the court when the action is filed and held until the decision is reached to prevent the waste of a legal action over a nonexistent object and, further, to ensure that the item in question is not destroyed, spent, etc., during the action. This can be used to force a settlement from the defendant, just or unjust, as he or she is deprived of the use of the disputed object for the duration of the action; if this results in a financial loss, the defendant may find it advantageous to merely pay a relatively small settlement and have the item returned quickly.

Replevin remains the modern action, albeit defined by statute, for recovery of chattels pending a decision of the right of possession. It lies only where the possession was taken from the plaintiff, whether under colour of legal process or otherwise, by an act having the nature of a trespass.

==History==
One of the oldest actions in the royal courts, replevin had its roots in the law of customary courts, and its formal origin can be attributed to Glanvil, Chief Justiciar of England during the reign of Henry II (1154–1189). Strictly speaking, replevin in its original form was a provisional remedy. Its provision was to procure for the plaintiff the return of chattels taken out of his possession until the right to their possession could be decided by a court of law. No doubt, it was designed to avoid quarrels likely to cause a breach of the peace pending a settlement of the dispute about the right to possession. In other words, the rule of law was beginning to replace that of local force of arms and personal conflict as the resolution of disputes over chattels. The action was in direct succession to the efforts made to regulate self-help, which were the origin of the law of tort. The form of legal recourse was in connection of distress (&quot;distractio&quot;). This was the practice of taking some chattel from the peasant or underling until some action was performed. In the medieval era the services for which distress could be levied were numerous, since the incidents of tenure were then very numerous. Distress was also leviable as &quot;damage feasant&quot;. When animals strayed and did damage to a neighbor, they could be retained until the damage was made good. Whether or not the distress was levied for rent or for livestock &quot;damage feasant&quot;, the owner of the animals could obtain their release by giving &quot;gage and pledge&quot; – a form of security that the damage would be made good. One peculiarity of distraint lay in the fact that the distrainor did not get any form of legal possession. The goods and chattels were considered to be in the custody of the law. As a result, there was no taking of possession by the distrainor that was unlawful, since no possession was technically inferred.

The action in replevin began to appear in the thirteenth century. It seems clear that originally the action of replevin lay simply where the question to be determined was that of wrongful distress. Excess and abuse of distress was punished.

Since the distrainor did not get possession he was not originally liable in trespass, and the spheres of the two forms of action remained distinct. During the fourteenth century, after some vacillation by judges, it was held that the plaintiff could elect which remedy he chose when the chattels had been distrained. It was also held that replevin could be used in place of the writ of &quot;trespass de bonis aspotatis&quot; (trespass by the asportation of goods). In reality, there is little evidence this substitution ever occurred with any frequency, if at all. The rule involved interference with the possession of a chattel by the rightful owner. In 1856, &quot;Mennie v. Blake&quot; summarized the law of replevin by stating, &quot;... it seems clear that replevin is not maintainable unless in a case in which there has been first a taking out of the possession of the owner. This stands upon authority and the reason of the thing&quot;.

The mere claim by the distrainor that he had a right to the chattels distrained was a technicality that ended the action in replevin. It was then necessary to re-file using a new writ invented in the early fourteenth century, called the writ &quot;de proprietate probanda&quot; – a writ &quot;concerning the proof of ownership&quot;.

During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the action of trover also arose, which largely replaced that of trespass in the matter of wrongful distress. Replevin and trover never completely coincided, because there was a limitation on replevin.

Until the Common Law Procedure Act 1854 came into effect in England and Wales, a defendant was able to exercise an option of paying damages instead of restoring the actual goods.

Section 65 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 made provision for the common law rules governing replevin in England and Wales to be replaced, although this provision did not become effective until 6 April 2014.

==Use==
Replevin actions are common and fall into two types of action: if immediate possession of the property is sought and if the party filing the action is content to wait for an adjudication of final rights. In a case in which immediate possession of property is sought, the petitioning creditor is often required to post a bond to protect the defendant against wrongful detention. That approach can be a very powerful weapon in a case of someone holding property wrongly because it deprives the holder of the use of the property while the case is awaiting trial, thereby putting pressure on the holder to settle the matter quickly.

This replevin process falls into two stages:
#the replevy, the steps that the owner takes to secure the physical possession of the goods, by giving security for prosecuting the action and for the return of the goods if the case goes against him and
#the action (suit) of replevin itself (at common law, the ordinary action for the recovery of goods wrongfully taken would be one of detinue; but no means of immediate recovery liable to be seized).

Replevin is used when the party having the right of property cannot simply invoke self-help and take the property back. If the party has the ability to do so directly, the action is referred to as repossession. For example, in the states of Wisconsin and Louisiana, if a person who finances an automobile, becomes a registered owner of that vehicle and fails to make payments as agreed, the lienholder cannot simply repossess the vehicle. The lienholder must go to court and obtain an order of replevin.

In many cases, parties initiating a replevin action will elect not to gain immediate possession of the collateral or other wrongfully-held property and will instead file the replevin action without posting a bond. Once service of process is achieved, the defendant will likely be required to attend a court hearing on a specific date, then the parties&#x27; rights to possession will be adjudicated. A plaintiff creditor can typically prevail in the case by offering testimony and business records showing the borrower/defendant&#x27;s obligation to pay, and default in payment. The Court will thereafter issue a judgment and authorize issuance of a writ of replevin, which is served by a sheriff&#x27;s deputy, working in conjunction with persons hired or employed by the creditor to take the collateral or other property into its possession. The sheriff&#x27;s role is to keep the peace and allow the creditor to get its property, without threat from the borrower. Once the creditor takes the property into its possession, it can sell the collateral, and apply the proceeds to the debt owed by the borrower.

In other cases, replevy is used to prevent damages that may occur from the continued use of an item, such as a public utility meter. In the case of non-payment of a public utility, a meter is typically left on the premise to allow reconnection should the balance due be paid, or if the person owing the bill sells the premise to another person who does not owe arrears to the utility, however, it is possible for one to reconnect the device and continue obtaining the commodity in question. In such cases, the utility could seek replevin for the utility meter itself, thereby preventing this practice.

==Law of replevin in other jurisdictions==
In the 1899 case of &quot;McGregor v. McGregor&quot;, Irving J of the British Columbia Supreme Court wrote:

Provisions analogous to replevin in the case of distraint are found in the Civil Code of Quebec (known as movable hypothec without delivery, at &quot;et seq&quot;.) and St Lucia (arts. 1888 &quot;et seq&quot;.), which was reproduced in substance from French law, which is also in force in Mauritius. There are analogous provisions in the Spanish Civil Code (art. 1922).

Similar provisions are also found in:

* New South Wales;
* Newfoundland;
* Ontario (not available without court order, except with respect to distraint for commercial property rent, where a commercial tenant is to be given five days for tender of rent and expenses after distress);
* Jamaica (Law 17 of 1900, certification of landlords bailiffs); and
* Queensland.

<text>CCGS &quot;Alexander Henry&quot; is a former Canadian Coast Guard light icebreaker and buoy tender that served on the Great Lakes from 1959 to 1984. In 1986, the vessel was handed over to the Marine Museum of the Great Lakes in Kingston, Ontario for preservation as a museum ship. Previously, during the summer months the vessel was also operated as a bed and breakfast. In 2017, the ship was sold to the Lakehead Transportation Museum Society in Thunder Bay, Ontario and in June, was relocated to the Pool 6 site on the town&#x27;s harbour front, where &quot;Alexander Henry&quot; continues as a museum ship.

==Design and description==
&quot;Alexander Henry&quot; is a light icebreaker and buoy tender that was designed to serve on the Great Lakes. The vessel displaces and is measured at . The ship is long overall and long between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of . The ship is powered by two Fairbanks-Morse 10-cylinder 2-cycle 37F16 diesel engines driving two shafts creating . This gives the ship a maximum speed of . No helicopter facilities were added to the ship as they were considered unnecessary for freshwater operations.

==Operational history==
The vessel was constructed by Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. at their yard in Port Arthur, Ontario and launched on 18 July 1958. The icebreaker entered service in July 1959 with the Department of Transport&#x27;s Marine Service as CGS &quot;Alexander Henry&quot; using the prefix &quot;Canadian Government Ship&quot;. Named after Alexander Henry the elder, an 18th-century British explorer and fur trader, she was transferred in 1962 to the newly created Canadian Coast Guard and given the new prefix Canadian Coast Guard Ship (CCGS).

CCGS &quot;Alexander Henry&quot; served her entire coast guard career on the Great Lakes, stationed on Lake Superior. In 1976, the vessel was used for an experiment testing the icebreaking capability of a hover platform pushed in front of the ship. Attached to the ship&#x27;s bow, the hover platform worked well in certain conditions, but required too much fuel and made excess noise. The hover platform also became an impediment to the ship should the platform breakdown. The planned deployment to cargo ships was never approved and though the experiment failed, self-propelled hovercraft are now utilised for icebreaking. 
The vessel was docked in Kingston, Ontario by Bernard Rashotte and &quot;Alexander Henry&quot; retired from service in 1985 after entered service. 

===Museum ship===
In June 1985, &quot;Alexander Henry&quot; was turned over the Marine Museum of the Great Lakes in Kingston, Ontario to become a museum ship. The vessel was used as floating maritime gallery and seasonal bed and breakfast by the museum.

&quot;Alexander Henry&quot; entered Kingston&#x27;s drydocks in 2010 to undergo inspection for conservation issues. Following the sale of the property in early 2016 that the Marine Museum was housed in, the museum was forced to find a new location for &quot;Alexander Henry&quot;. The ship was temporarily housed by a local entrepreneur until the former Coast Guard vessel&#x27;s fate can be determined. The icebreaker was moved to a wharf near Prinyer&#x27;s Cove in Prince Edward County, Ontario. The city of Kingston was given three options to deal with the ship; offer to sell &quot;Alexander Henry&quot; to Thunder Bay, where the vessel was constructed. This was the cheapest alternative in disposing of the ship, as converting it to an artificial reef would cost over $422,000 and to scrap the vessel, $326,000.

The Lakehead Transportation Museum Society purchased the vessel for $2 and on 11 April 2017, received $125,000 provided by the City of Thunder Bay to cover towing costs to bring the ship from Kingston to Thunder Bay. &quot;Alexander Henry&quot; departed Kingston on 20 June and arrived in Thunder Bay on 28 June. The vessel was docked temporarily at the C.N. Ore Dock until &quot;Alexander Henry&quot;″s permanent site was ready at the Pool 6 site along the city&#x27;s waterfront. The museum ship opened to public tours on 18 July 2018.

<text>Bicaz () is a town in Neamț County, Western Moldavia, Romania situated in the eastern Carpathian Mountains near the confluence of the Bicaz and Bistrița Rivers and near Lake Bicaz, an artificial lake formed by the Bicaz Dam on the Bistrița. Bicaz used to be a border town until 1918. Six villages are administered by the town: Capșa, Dodeni, Izvoru Alb, Izvoru Muntelui, Potoci, and Secu.

==Economy==
Before the construction of the dam (1950–1960) the settlement was just a mountain village in Eastern Carpathians where the main economic activity was timber harvesting. By tradition, the tree trunks were linked together, forming a raft (&quot;pluta&quot;); a raftman () used to drive the raft on the Bistrița river downstream to wood processing facilities in Piatra Neamț.

Building the dam created also a horizontal industry: two cement and aggregate plants were built in Bicaz proper and nearby Tașca. This, together with the construction of the Bicaz-Stejaru Hydroelectric Power Station ( to the east) triggered a relative economic boom during the communist period.

The Bicaz cement plant was shut down after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 and is slowly being taken apart. On the other hand, the Tașca cement plant was acquired by the German group HeidelbergCement and was completely overhauled.
The town has also a few timber factories and wood processing facilities.

==Access==
The town has access to two national roads: DN15 and DN12C while Bicaz railway station is the terminus station on CFR Line 509 with scheduled daily service to Bucharest North. The town served also as a port with scheduled ferry service with the villages on lake shore in the 1960s and 1970s. Today the facility offers only seasonal leisure cruises.

==Tourism==
The town is located in the proximity of two important tourist destinations in Romania: the Ceahlău Massif ( north) and Cheile Bicazului-Hășmaș National Park ( to the west). The impressive Bicaz Dam built on the river Bistrița in the 1950s (one of the biggest in Romania) and the resulting Bicaz Lake are also popular tourist sights. Durău, the only ski resort in the Ceahlău Massif, is located about north.

<text>A centered octagonal number is a centered figurate number that represents an octagon with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center dot in successive octagonal layers. The centered octagonal numbers are the same as the odd square numbers. Thus, the &quot;n&quot;th odd square number and &quot;t&quot;th centered octagonal number is given by the formula
:formula_1
The first few centered octagonal numbers are
:1, 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, 169, 225, 289, 361, 441, 529, 625, 729, 841, 961, 1089, 1225

Calculating Ramanujan&#x27;s tau function on a centered octagonal number yields an odd number, whereas for any other number the function yields an even number.

formula_2 is the number of 2x2 matrices with elements from 0 to n that their determinant is twice their permanent.

John Bouvier was born in 1787 in Codognan, France, in the department du Gard, to Jean Bouvier (1760–1803) and Marie Benezet (1760–1823). They were members of the Quakers. John Bouvier was educated in Nimes.

In 1802, Jean and Marie Bouvier, John Bouvier, and his brother Daniel emigrated to America and settled in Philadelphia. Bouvier&#x27;s father died within a year of yellow fever, and his mother later returned to France. John Bouvier was apprenticed to age 21 to a Philadelphia Quaker, Benjamin Johnson, a printer and bookseller who had known the family while traveling in France.

In 1808, John Bouvier began a printing business on Cypress Alley in west Philadelphia. 
In 1810, he married Elizabeth Widdifield (1789–1870), by whom he had one daughter, astronomical writer and cookbook author Hannah Mary Bouvier Peterson (1811–1870).
Bouvier became a citizen of the United States in 1812.

By 1814, Bouvier was living in Brownsville, Pennsylvania, where on Wednesday, November 9, 1814, he published the first issue of &quot;The American Telegraph&quot;. In the weekly newspaper, he resolved to &quot;discountenance factions and factious men&quot; while following an editor&#x27;s duty of &quot;exposure and support of the truth&quot;. In 1818, Bouvier moved to Uniontown, Pennsylvania, where he joined with another periodical to publish &quot;The Genius of Liberty and American Telegraph&quot;. He continued to be involved in its publication until July 18, 1820.

==Legal career==
While active as a printer and publisher, Bouvier began to study law, under the tutelage of Andrew Stewart.
He was admitted to the bar in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, in 1818. In 1822, he was admitted to serve as an attorney in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. In 1823, he moved back to Philadelphia. Bouvier was appointed Recorder of the City of Philadelphia in 1836, by Governor Joseph Ritner, and became an associate justice of the court of criminal sessions of Philadelphia in 1838.

He was best known, however, for his legal writings. Having himself experienced the difficulty of studying treatises based on British laws that no longer applied to the United States, Bouvier wrote his own American law dictionary, &quot;Law Dictionary Adapted to the Constitution and Laws of the United States of America and of the Several States of the American Union&quot; (1839). He hoped that being &quot;written entirely anew, and calculated to remedy those defects, [it] would be useful to the profession&quot;. It is believed to be the first legal dictionary to be based on American law. It was well received by bibliographer Samuel Austin Allibone and by other jurists including Chancellor James Kent of the New York Supreme Court and Justice Joseph Story of the United States Supreme Court. Bouvier himself revised and published new editions in 1843 and 1848. After his death, it continued to be updated and published, and was retitled &quot;Bouvier&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot; by Francis Rawle in 1897. Bouvier also published an edition of Matthew Bacon&#x27;s &quot;Abridgment of the Law&quot; (10 volumes, 1842–1846), and a compendium of American law entitled &quot;The Institutes of American Law&quot; (4 volumes, 1851) that outlined legal principles such as bailment, contracts, and property.

Bouvier died on November 18, 1851, a week after being &quot;stricken with apoplexy&quot; while working at his office. He is buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

<text>Sebeș (; German: &quot;Mühlbach&quot;; Hungarian: &quot;Szászsebes&quot;; Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Melnbach&quot;) is a city in Alba County, central Romania, southwestern Transylvania.

== Geography ==
The city lies in the Mureș River valley and straddles the river Sebeș. It is at the crossroads of two main highways in Romania: the A1 motorway coming from Sibiu and going towards Deva and the A10 motorway going towards Alba Iulia and Cluj-Napoca. Their national road counterparts passing through the city are the DN1 (E81) and the DN7 (E68), both of which also come from Sibiu.

Sebeș is situated south of the county capital, Alba Iulia. It has three villages under its administration:
* Petrești (&quot;Petersdorf&quot;; &quot;Péterfalva&quot;) – south
* Lancrăm (&quot;Langendorf&quot;; &quot;Lámkerék&quot;) – north
* Răhău (&quot;Reichau&quot;; &quot;Rehó&quot;) – east.

== Climate ==
Sebeș has a humid continental climate (&quot;Cfb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification).

== History ==

It is believed that there has been an earlier rural settlement in this area, with Romanian and Pecheneg population, situated east of today&#x27;s city. The city itself was built by German settlers — later referred as Transylvanian Saxons, but actually originating from the region of Rhine and Moselle — on the territory of the Hungarian Kingdom in the second half of the 12th century and became an important city in medieval Transylvania. Its city walls were reinforced after the Tatar (Mongol) invasions from 1241 to 1242, but the city was occupied in 1438 by the Ottoman Empire. Transylvania&#x27;s voivode John I Zápolya died in Sebeș in 1540. The Transylvanian Diet met in Sebeș in 1546, 1556, 1598, and 1600. The location of the meetings, the Zápolya House, is now a museum. In the oldest documents that attest the existence of Sebeș, the city is named &quot;Malebach&quot;(1245), &quot;Millenbach&quot;(1309), names that derive from the German &quot;Malemboch&quot;, which means &quot;the river that carries a lot of rocks&quot;, which corresponds to the geography of the city.

Johannes Tröster&#x27;s work &quot;Das alt und neue Teutsche Dacia&quot; published in 1666 in Nuremberg sets the date of the city&#x27;s founding in 1150. The great Mongol invasion destroyed the city in 1242, after which the inhabitants rebuilt it. The old two-towered Romanesque basilica was rebuilt in early Gothic style. The current tower was built on the foundations of the two original towers. The fourteenth century brought with it a period of development of the city, it being listed in 1376 as the third commercial importance among the Saxon cities. A royal deed from 1387 enshrines the right of Sebeș to build fortress walls, although their construction had probably begun before the middle of the 14th century. It thus becomes, despite its small size, the first city in Transylvania to be completely surrounded by masonry fortifications.

After the union with Romania in December 1918, the first mayor of the city was Lionel Blaga, the brother of the Romanian poet and philosopher Lucian Blaga, who was born in the nearby village of Lancrăm.

== Politics and administration ==
The town&#x27;s current local council has the following multi-party political composition, based on the results of the ballots cast at the 2020 Romanian local elections:

== Economy ==

Today Sebeș is a city with a dynamic economy, having received in the last decade important foreign investments: wood processing and leather goods manufacturing are the chief domains of the local industry. As of March 2015, the unemployment rate was under 2%, the lowest of any city in Romania at the time.

In April 2016, Daimler AG&#x27;s subsidiary &quot;Star Assembly&quot; started producing Mercedes-Benz nine-speed automatic transmissions in Sebeș.

== Population ==
At the 2021 census, Sebeș had a population of 26,490. According to the 1850 census, the population of the city at that time was 8,701 inhabitants in total, with a substantial minority of ethnic Germans. At the 2011 census, Sebeș had 24,165 inhabitants, of which:
* Romanians: 22,551, representing 93.3% (in 1850: 69.4%)
* Romani: 1,168, representing 4.8% (in 1850: 2.7%)
* Germans (Transylvanian Saxons): 261, representing 1.1% (in 1850: 27.0%)
* Hungarians: 131, representing 0.5% (in 1850: 0.47%)
* Others: 52, representing 0.3%
From a confessional point of view, the majority of the inhabitants were Orthodox (80.1%), with a minority of Pentecostals (3.05%). For 11.58% of the population, the confessional affiliation was not known.

<text>The Thorold Tunnel is an underwater tunnel in Thorold, Ontario, Canada carrying Highway 58 underneath the Welland Canal. Built between 1965 and 1967, the tunnel is 840 metres in length and consists of two separate tubes each containing two lanes of traffic. The westbound tube has a sidewalk for pedestrians.

It is one of three tunnels under the Welland Canal (the other two being the Main Street and Townline Tunnels in Welland), and the only tunnel to be constructed after the waterway opened.

The tunnel has been used as a filming location due to its relatively low traffic levels, including for the television series &quot;American Gothic&quot; and the movie &quot;Highwaymen&quot;.

Due to repair work on the tunnel&#x27;s ceiling tiles, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation began daily closures of the westbound tube in April 2018 outside of morning rush hour. The repairs are an interim measure and a tender for full rehabilitation of the tunnel was issued by the Ministry on April 4, 2018.
In April, 2024 construction began on the Thorold Tunnel, resulting in nighttime closures and daytime lane restrictions.

<text>Frederic (or Frederick) Dan Huntington (May 28, 1819, Hadley, Massachusetts – July 11, 1904, Hadley, Massachusetts) was an American clergyman and the first Protestant Episcopal bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Central New York.

==Early life, education and career==
Frederic Dan, the youngest of the eleven children born to Dan and Elizabeth Huntington, was born in Hadley, Massachusetts on May 28, 1819. He grew up on the family farm &quot;Forty Acres,&quot; the home of both his mother and his grandmother, Elizabeth Porter Phelps.

He graduated at Amherst College in 1839 and at the Harvard Divinity School in 1842. In 1843 he married Hannah Sargent, the sister of Epes Sargent. From 1842 to 1855 he was pastor of the South Congregational Church of Boston, and in 1855-1860 as preacher to the university and Plummer professor of Christian Morals at Harvard; he then left the Unitarian Church, with which his father had been connected as a clergyman at Hadley, resigned his professorship and became pastor of the newly established Emmanuel Church of Boston.

=== Syracuse, New York ===

Rev. Huntington founded the St. John&#x27;s School, a military school, in 1869 in Manlius, New York, and was its president until his death in 1904. In the 1920s, St. John&#x27;s became known as the renowned military school, The Manlius School, today integrated into the Manlius Pebble Hill School.

He had refused the bishopric of the Episcopal Diocese of Maine when, in 1868, he was elected to the Diocese of Central New York. He was consecrated on April 9, 1869, and thereafter lived in Syracuse, New York.

He was the first president of the Church Association for the Advancement of the Interests of Labor.

===Consecrators===
* The Most Reverend Benjamin B. Smith
* The Right Reverend Manton Eastburn
* The Right Reverend Horatio Potter
N.B.: 93rd bishop consecrated in the Episcopal Church.

== End of life ==
Huntington remained throughout his life attached to the family&#x27;s ancestral farm in Hadley, Massachusetts, in the 1860s purchasing his siblings&#x27; shares so that he could inherit the house. He continued to manage it as a working farm, and spent summers there throughout his life. Huntington died in Hadley on July 11, 1904, aged 85.

== Publications ==

His more important publications included:

* &quot;Lectures on Human Society&quot; (1860)
* &quot;Memorials of a Quiet Life&quot; (1874)
* &quot;The Golden Rule applied to Business and Social Conditions&quot; (1892)

From 1845 to 1858 he was the editor of &quot;The Monthly Religious Magazine,&quot; a Unitarian review.

== Legacy ==
Huntington&#x27;s ancestral family home, the Porter-Phelps-Huntington House in Hadley, became a historic house museum in the 1940s, and is open seasonally. His daughter Ruth Huntington Sessions wrote a memoir, &quot;Sixty Odd&quot; (1936), which includes details about her childhood with Huntington.

Huntington Hall at Syracuse University campus was named after him in 1964.

<text>The Tonga men&#x27;s national football team () represents Tonga in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Tonga Football Association, which is a part of the Oceania Football Confederation.

==History==
==Information==

===Football in Tonga===
Tonga&#x27;s greatest football triumph to date was their triumph in the first ever Polynesian Cup held in 1993 over Samoa and the Cook Islands. Although local players have not yet made their mark on big leagues abroad, the Chief Executive of the Tonga Football Association, Joe Topou, was appointed to the FIFA Executive Committee in 2002.

In July 2023, Tonga became unranked within the FIFA rankings due to not having played any matches since they lost 8-0 to Papua New Guinea on 18 July 2019.

===The second Goal project===
Tonga&#x27;s second Goal project will develop and improve the national football academy and the association&#x27;s headquarters in Atele, Tongatapu, which was built in the country&#x27;s first Goal project. This development work has the aim that all of the Tonga Football Association&#x27;s needs are fully satisfied. Local matches will be held at the football academy, while the administration&#x27;s requirements, including the needs of players, officials and spectators, will also be covered. The football school will be transformed into a House of Football.

<doc id="1215894" wikidata="Q69880" url="?curid=1215894" title="2005 Formula One World Championship">
<text>The 2005 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 59th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 56th FIA Formula One World Championship, contested over a then-record 19 Grands Prix. It commenced on 6 March 2005 and ended 16 October.

Fernando Alonso and the Renault team won the World Drivers&#x27; and World Constructors&#x27; championships, ending five years of dominance by Michael Schumacher and Ferrari since 2000 and also ending nine years of Ferrari, McLaren and Williams dominance triopoly since 1996. Alonso&#x27;s success made him the youngest champion in the history of the sport, a title he held until Lewis Hamilton&#x27;s 2008 title success. Renault&#x27;s win was their first as a constructor. Alonso started the season off strongly, winning three of the first four races and his title success was in little doubt. He sealed the title in Brazil with two races left after a controlled third-place finish. Alonso&#x27;s championship was also the first for a Renault-powered driver since Jacques Villeneuve&#x27;s championship in 1997.

Alonso and Renault had to contend with the pace of the resurgent McLaren team with lead driver Kimi Räikkönen outshining teammate Juan Pablo Montoya, who came highly regarded from his time at Williams. Räikkönen won seven races like Alonso but would have won more if not for a series of reliability issues, resulting in qualifying engine change penalties and retirements from the lead on three occasions. Nevertheless, Räikkönen grabbed the headlines winning from near the back of the grid in Japan, passing Alonso&#x27;s Renault teammate Giancarlo Fisichella on the final lap. Reigning champions Michael Schumacher and Ferrari had a poor season by their standards, with Bridgestone unable to compete with Michelin after the tyre-change ban that only affected the 2005 season. Their only win came when Michelin deemed their own tyres unsafe after several incidents in the oval turn at Indianapolis. As a result, only the six Bridgestone cars took part. Schumacher just held on for third in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, in spite of the superior pace of McLaren, underlining the disappointing season Montoya had. The Colombian missed two races early on due to a tennis injury. He then won three races, showing glimpses of pace, but was well beaten by his teammate Räikkönen in the championship.

The 2005 season was the last before the Minardi, BAR and Jordan teams were taken over by new owners and changed names to Toro Rosso, Honda, and Midland respectively in the season. The former Jaguar team was sold from Ford to Red Bull GmbH and made its debut as Red Bull Racing during the 2005 season.

== Teams and drivers ==
The following teams and drivers were competitors in the 2005 FIA Formula One World Championship.
* † All engines were 3.0-litre, V10 configuration. 2005 was the final year of this engine formula.
* No Michelin-shod cars participated in the United States Grand Prix for safety reasons, leaving just six cars on the grid at the start of the race.

===Free practice drivers===
Five constructors entered free practice only drivers over the course of the season. Sauber Petronas were also eligible to enter a free practice driver, but elected not to do so.
* Enrico Toccacelo, Minardi&#x27;s third driver was not present in Brazil as he competed for the Italian team in the opening round of the A1 Grand Prix series at Brands Hatch.
* Robert Kubica was due to drive Minardi&#x27;s third car Japanese or Chinese GP, but he did not get the FIA Super License required to drive.

===Team changes===


* Red Bull Racing, which took over the Jaguar team, ran with Cosworth engines. Red Bull&#x27;s lead driver was veteran Scotsman David Coulthard who switched from McLaren, paired with Austrian Christian Klien, the 2004 Jaguar driver.
* Toyota-powered Jordan Grand Prix was purchased by Midland Group, although the team continued as Jordan until 2006.
* Sauber switched from Bridgestone to Michelin tyres over the winter, further severing their ties with the Ferrari team.
* The BAR team was banned from the Grands Prix in Spain and Monaco, after both their cars were found to be underweight at the San Marino Grand Prix.
* At the Hungarian Grand Prix, West McLaren Mercedes became Team McLaren Mercedes.
* Shortly after the United States Grand Prix, Peter Sauber announced that Credit Suisse had sold BMW their majority share in his Sauber team, which announced its intention to run as BMW&#x27;s factory team in 2006.

===Driver changes===
* Renault partnered Fernando Alonso with the 2004 Sauber driver Giancarlo Fisichella, in a straight swap with Jacques Villeneuve (who had taken over from Jarno Trulli at Renault for the last three races of the season).
* Williams employed an all-new driver line-up in 2005, having signed Jaguar&#x27;s Mark Webber and Jordan&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld to replace Juan Pablo Montoya and Ralf Schumacher. Montoya moved to McLaren, in place of the Red Bull-bound David Coulthard (who took Webber&#x27;s vacated seat), while Ralf Schumacher signed for Toyota. This meant that Ricardo Zonta, who had raced for Toyota in five of the final six races of 2004, returned to a third driver role in 2005. Olivier Panis, who had driven in seventeen out of eighteen races for Toyota in 2004, was retained by the team in the dual capacity of advisor and test driver. Cristiano da Matta, who had started the 2004 season with Toyota, returned to Champ Car in 2005. Jarno Trulli joined as Toyota&#x27;s second driver.
* Jordan&#x27;s other driver from the end of 2004, Timo Glock, also switched to Champ Car for 2005, leaving Jordan with two vacant seats. They were taken by Tiago Monteiro (a test driver for Minardi in 2004) and Narain Karthikeyan, both Formula One debutants, who had both competed in the previous year&#x27;s World Series by Nissan season. Giorgio Pantano, who raced for Jordan for the majority of 2004, left Formula One altogether, joining the Super Nova Racing team for the inaugural GP2 Series season.
* Minardi also ran an all-new line-up in 2005, with their 2004 drivers—Gianmaria Bruni (who switched to GP2 in 2005) and Zsolt Baumgartner—being replaced by a pair of debutants: Patrick Friesacher and Christijan Albers, who had competed in International Formula 3000 and DTM, respectively, during the previous season.

;Mid-season changes
* BAR test driver Anthony Davidson raced in Malaysia in place of an ill Takuma Sato. Sato returned to the seat for the next race.
* Following a shoulder injury to Juan Pablo Montoya, McLaren reserve driver Pedro de la Rosa raced for the team in Bahrain, with Alexander Wurz taking on third driver duties in place of de la Rosa. For the San Marino Grand Prix, de la Rosa and Wurz swapped roles. Montoya returned for the following race.
* Vitantonio Liuzzi and Christian Klien were both contracted to Red Bull Racing to participate in at least three races, and agreed to share their race seat for the season. While Klien, who had raced for the team&#x27;s forerunners Jaguar in 2004, drove in the first three races, Liuzzi replaced him for the San Marino, Spanish, Monaco, and European Grands Prix. Klien returned for the Canadian Grand Prix, and completed the remainder of the season.
* Robert Doornbos was Jordan&#x27;s third driver for nine of the first eleven races of the season. Franck Montagny replaced him at the European Grand Prix, while Jordan were banned from using a third car at the Canadian Grand Prix after using too many tyres at the previous race. Nicolas Kiesa replaced Doornbos for the German Grand Prix onwards, when the Dutchman replaced Patrick Friesacher at Minardi due to sponsorship issues.
* Chanoch Nissany became Minardi&#x27;s third driver for the Hungarian Grand Prix. He was replaced by Enrico Toccacelo for the Turkish Grand Prix and Italian Grand Prix. Nissany was the first Israeli to participate in a Formula One weekend.
* Antônio Pizzonia replaced Nick Heidfeld at Williams for the Italian Grand Prix, when Heidfeld decided to withdraw after complaining of a severe headache. Earlier in the week, he had crashed heavily during a test session at Monza. Heidfeld had been due to return for the Brazilian Grand Prix, but after having a motorcycle accident he was forced to sit out the remainder of the season, with Pizzonia continuing to race for Williams in Heidfeld&#x27;s absence.

==Calendar==
The 2005 Formula One calendar featured one new event, the Turkish Grand Prix.

===Calendar changes===
* With the Brazilian Grand Prix being run in late September, the Chinese Grand Prix became the final race of the season.
* The Turkish Grand Prix was added to the calendar after the Hungarian Grand Prix on 21 August.

== Regulation changes ==
For a time there existed a distinct possibility that some teams would be running three race cars per Grand Prix: fewer than 10 teams, or 20 cars, starting on the grid would have resulted in some teams running three cars, under a term in the Concorde Agreement. By the first round of the season, there were ten teams, as Red Bull completed their takeover of Jaguar and were ready to race in Australia. Minardi, which initially received an injunction allowing them to compete despite their cars&#x27; non-conformity to new 2005 technical regulations, later modified their cars to adhere to 2005 regulations.

=== Technical regulations ===
* A major change in 2005 was the outlawing of tyre changes during pit stops. Now a driver had to use one set of tyres during qualifying and the race itself. The reason for this rule change was to motivate the teams to select harder tyre compounds with less grip, reducing cornering speeds, which was intended to improve safety. Tyre changes were allowed for punctures and for wet weather, under the direction of the FIA. The FIA had to post a &quot;change in climatic conditions&quot; notice in order for tyre changes to occur normally as a force majeure. After Kimi Räikkönen&#x27;s disastrous accident at the Nurburgring when his suspension collapsed after a flat-spotted tyre ripped the carbon fibre suspension apart, team principals and the FIA agreed that a single tyre change per car could be made without penalty, provided it was to change a tyre that had become dangerously worn like Räikkönen&#x27;s had. Preserving a single set of tyres for the entire race became a new challenge for drivers; the challenge for tyre manufactures was to produce more durable, long-lasting compounds. Michelin-shod runners had a distinct advantage over their Bridgestone counterparts.
* Formula One engines had to last two race weekends, double that demanded by 2004 regulations. A driver who needed to change an engine was subject to a 10-place grid penalty for the race. Designed to limit revs and power outputs demanded by greater reliability, this regulation was also a cost-cutting measure for engine manufacturers. After the initial race of the season, the FIA acted to close a loophole in this new regulation exposed by BAR, who deliberately pitted their cars rather than finish the race.
* The technical aerodynamics regulations were modified to improve competition, especially for cars travelling in another car&#x27;s air flow wake in order to overtake. By changing the size and placement of both front and rear wings, as well as requiring higher noses, the new rules attempted to reduce downforce by roughly one-quarter, but teams developed other chassis innovations to reclaim much of that &quot;lost&quot; downforce, which made following another car even harder than the previous season. Front wings have been lifted by , to reduce downforce, while the rear wings have been brought forward relative to the centre line between the rear wheels.
* This was the final season in which the 3.0-litre V10 engine configuration was used by all teams. New changes in the technical regulations saw a 2.4-litre V8 engine configuration being introduced by the FIA for the 2006 Formula One season; however, the FIA granted an exemption for teams who were unable to re-engineer or could not afford a V8 engine in time for 2006. Budget or resource-limited teams were allowed to run a rev-limited 3.0-litre V10. Ten of the eleven teams ran with a conventional 2.4L V8 for 2006, with the exception of Scuderia Toro Rosso, who continued and were permitted by the FIA to use a rev-limited &quot;Cosworth TJ2006&quot; 3.0L V10 powerplant.

=== Sporting regulations ===
* The first six races of the 2005 season used a new qualifying format, marking the third year in five with sharply revised qualifying rules. Grid position was determined by aggregate times from two single-lap flying runs, one Saturday afternoon and one Sunday morning. Refueling was allowed after the first qualifying run Saturday; however, the car must have been fuelled for the race for Sunday&#x27;s qualifying. (Although some rules changes are brought about to even the playing field or to reduce costs, this rule change was prompted by the typhoon which rescheduled qualifying for the 2004 Japanese Grand Prix). Adverse weather conditions affecting either qualifying session impacted the final, aggregate time. On 24 May, the ten team bosses met with Max Mosley and recommended a return to a single, one-lap qualifying run on Saturday on race fuel and race tyres, which, having been approved by the FIA World Motor Sport Council, took effect at the European Grand Prix on 29 May.
* If a driver stalled his car while entering the final grid, the other cars were sent instantly to a new warm-up lap, instead of all drivers stopping their cars and waiting a couple of minutes for a new start. The stalled car is pushed to the pit lane and the grid is clear when the drivers return.
* When the race was red-flagged, the timekeeping system would not stop. The drivers would stop on the start/finish straight, and the restart would take place behind the safety car instead of a standing start which was used earlier. Although this rule came in effect in 2005, it was first used at the 2007 European Grand Prix.
* Also in safety car situations, the rules were changed to allow the safety car to use the pit lane if necessary. This rule change was made following Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s accident in 2004 United States Grand Prix.

==Season report==
The most-noted aspect of the season was Ferrari&#x27;s lack of pace caused mainly by a new rule prohibiting tyre changes during the course of a race. The Bridgestone tyres used by Ferrari could not find the right balance between performance and reliability, leaving the Michelin runners to battle for race victories. Further rule changes emphasised the new focus on reliability, with engines required to last two Grands Prix without being changed.

Renault appeared the fastest team in pre-season testing and it was no surprise they dominated the early fly-away rounds. Giancarlo Fisichella won the season opener in Australia before teammate Alonso demonstrated his title credentials with a series of victories in Malaysia, Bahrain and San Marino. As the season progressed the McLarens of Kimi Räikkönen and Juan Pablo Montoya became increasingly competitive and by the latter stages of the season the McLaren was generally considered the faster package. However, constant technical failures meant neither the team nor Räikkönen were able to translate their speed into championship success.

Alonso secured his Drivers&#x27; Championship with a third-place finish in the Brazilian Grand Prix. Despite both him and Räikkönen having six victories to their name at this point in the season, Alonso&#x27;s greater consistency meant he was able to claim the championship with two rounds to spare. The Constructors&#x27; Championship was secured by Renault at the final race, with Alonso&#x27;s seventh victory of the year. This gave Renault their first championship as a constructor (after only previously triumphing as an engine supplier) despite winning two fewer races than McLaren.

Ferrari finished third in the Constructors&#x27; Championship with only one win, at the United States Grand Prix, a race that was only contested by the six Bridgestone cars after Michelin declared their tyres unsafe to run in the Indianapolis Motor Speedway&#x27;s unique banked corner.

After a high-flying 2004 season the most conspicuous drop in performance after Ferrari was BAR-Honda, who were banned from two races after scrutineers in San Marino discovered a hidden fuel compartment that allowed their cars to run underweight. They were beaten in the championship by Williams, whose engine partner BMW had announced they were leaving to join Sauber in June, and Toyota, who achieved 5 podium finishes and were only beaten to third in the championship because of Ferrari&#x27;s 1–2 in Indianapolis.

All the teams scored world championship points over the course of the season, Minardi scoring rare points in their final season courtesy of being able to run in the US race. The 2005 season also saw nine different drivers score a pole position - setting a new record for the number of different polesitters in a season eclipsing the previous record of eight different polesitters set in the 1968 season. This tally of different polesitters remains a record as of the end of the 2022 championship.
== Results and standings ==
The 2005 Formula One calendar featured a new event in Turkey, just miles from the Europe–Asia dividing line. The newly built circuit in Istanbul joined the 2004 newcomers Bahrain and China. The 2005 season witnessed two of the hottest Grands Prix ever: the track temperature at the beginning of the Malaysian event was 51 °C (124 °F), while in Bahrain the mercury soared past 56 °C (133 °F).

<text>Benjamin Huntsman (4 June 170420 June 1776) was an English inventor and manufacturer of cast or crucible steel.

==Biography==

Huntsman was born the fourth child of William and Mary (née Nainby) Huntsman, a Quaker farming couple, in Epworth, Lincolnshire. Some sources suggest that his parents were German immigrants, but it seems that they were both born in Lincolnshire.

Huntsman started business as a clock, lock and tool maker in Doncaster, Yorkshire. His reputation enabled him to also practice surgery in an experimental fashion and he was also consulted as an oculist.

Huntsman experimented in steel manufacture, first at Doncaster. Then, in 1740, he moved to Handsworth, near Sheffield. Eventually, after many experiments, Huntsman was able to make satisfactory cast steel, in clay pot crucibles, each holding about of blistered steel. A flux was added, and they were covered and heated by means of coke for about three hours. The molten steel was then poured into moulds and the crucibles reused. The first object to contain Crucible Cast Steel, was a longcase clock, made by Huntsman. It is on display in the Enid Hattersley Gallery at Kelham Island Museum. The local cutlery manufacturers refused to buy Huntsman&#x27;s cast steel, as it was harder than the German steel they were accustomed to using. For a long time, Huntsman exported his whole output to France.

The growing competition of imported French cutlery made from Huntsman&#x27;s cast-steel alarmed the Sheffield cutlers, who, after trying unsuccessfully to get the export of the steel prohibited by the British government, were compelled to use it in the interests of self-preservation. Huntsman had not patented his process, and his secret was discovered by a Sheffield iron-founder called Walker. Walker, according to legend, entered Huntsman&#x27;s works in the disguise of a starving beggar asking to sleep by a fire for the night.

In 1770, Huntsman moved his enterprise to Worksop Road in Attercliffe, where he prospered until his death in 1776 and was laid to rest with a commemorative tomb in the Hilltop Cemetery, Attercliffe Common. The business was taken over by his son, William Huntsman (1733–1809).

At Sheffield&#x27;s Northern General Hospital one of the original main buildings is named after him, and in the city centre is a Wetherspoons pub called &quot;The Benjamin Huntsman&quot;.

<doc id="1215906" wikidata="Q1043820" url="?curid=1215906" title="Carmine Galante">
<text>Carmine Galante (; February 21, 1910 – July 12, 1979) was an American Mafioso who was &quot;de facto&quot; boss of the Bonanno crime family of New York City. Galante was rarely seen without a cigar hanging from his mouth, leading to the nickname &quot;The Cigar&quot; and &quot;Lilo&quot;, &quot;after the Italian slang word for a stubby little cigar.&quot; He was assassinated on Commission orders in 1979 while dining in a restaurant.

== Background ==
Camillo Carmine Galante was born on February 21, 1910, in a tenement building in the East Harlem section of Manhattan. His parents, Vincenzo &quot;James&quot; Galante and Vincenza Russo, had emigrated from Castellammare del Golfo, Sicily, to New York City in 1906, where Vincenzo was a fisherman.

Carmine Galante had two brothers, Samuel and Peter Galante, and two sisters, Josephine and Angelina Galante. On February 10, 1945, Galante married Helen Marulli, by whom he had three children: James Galante, Camille Galante, and Angela Galante. For the last 20 years of his life, Carmine Galante lived with Ann Acquavella; the couple had two children together. He was the uncle of Bonanno crime family capo James Carmine Galante.

While in prison in 1931, doctors diagnosed Galante as having a psychopathic personality. Galante owned the Rosina Costume Company in Brooklyn, New York and was associated with the Abco Vending Company of West New York, New Jersey.

== Criminal career ==
=== Early years ===
At the age of 10, Galante was sent to reform school due to his criminal activities. He soon formed a juvenile street gang on New York&#x27;s Lower East Side. By the age of 15, Galante had dropped out of seventh grade. As a teenager, Galante became a Mafia associate during the Prohibition era, becoming a leading enforcer by the end of the decade. During this period, Galante also worked as a fish sorter and at an artificial flower shop. On December 12, 1925, the 15-year-old Galante pleaded guilty to assault charges. On December 22, 1926, Galante was sentenced to at least two and a half years in the state prison.

In August 1930, Galante was arrested for the murder of police officer Walter DeCastilla that occurred during a payroll robbery. However, Galante was never indicted. Also in 1930, New York Police Department (NYPD) officer Joseph Meenahan caught Galante and other gang members attempting to hijack a truck in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In the ensuing gun battle, Galante wounded Meenahan and a six-year-old bystander; both survived. On February 8, 1931, after pleading guilty to attempted robbery, Galante was sentenced to 12 and a half years in the state prison. On May 1, 1939, Galante was released from prison on parole.

By 1940, Galante was carrying out &quot;hits&quot; for Vito Genovese, the official underboss of the Luciano crime family. Galante had an underworld reputation for viciousness and was suspected by the NYPD of involvement in over eighty murders. Galante reportedly had a cold, dead-eyed stare with eyes that betrayed an utter indifference to human life, scaring both law enforcement officers and other Mafia members. Ralph Salerno, a former NYPD detective, once said, &quot;Of all the gangsters that I&#x27;ve met personally, and I&#x27;ve met dozens of them in all of my years, there were only two who, when I looked them straight in the eye, I decided I wouldn&#x27;t want them to be really personally mad at me. Aniello Dellacroce was one and Carmine Galante was the other. They had bad eyes, I mean, they had the eyes of killers. You could see how frightening they were, the frigid glare of a killer.&quot;

In 1943, Galante allegedly murdered Carlo Tresca, the publisher of an anti-fascist newspaper in New York. Genovese, living in exile in Italy, offered to kill Tresca as a favor to Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini. Genovese allegedly gave the murder contract to Galante. On January 11, 1943, Galante allegedly shot and killed Tresca as he stepped outside his newspaper office in Manhattan, and then got in a car and drove away. Although Galante was arrested as a suspect, no one was ever charged in the murder. After the Tresca murder, Galante was sent back to prison on a parole violation. On December 21, 1944, Galante was released from prison.

=== Later years ===
In 1953, boss Joseph Bonanno sent Galante to Montreal, Quebec, to organize the family’s drug business and rackets there. He worked with Vincenzo Cotroni of the Cotroni crime family in the French Connection. The Bonannos were importing huge amounts of heroin by ship into Montreal and then sending it into the United States. Police also estimated that Galante was collecting gambling profits in Montreal worth about $50 million per year. In April 1956, due to Galante&#x27;s strong-arm extortion tactics, the Canadian Government deported him back to the United States.

In October 1957, Bonanno and Galante, now a &quot;consigliere&quot;, held a hotel meeting in Palermo, Sicily, on plans to import heroin into the United States. Attendees included Lucky Luciano and other American mobsters, with a Sicilian Mafia delegation led by Giuseppe Genco Russo. As part of the agreement, Sicilian mobsters would come to the U.S. to distribute the narcotics. Galante brought many young men, known as Zips, from his family home of Castellammare del Golfo, Trapani, to work as bodyguards, contract killers and drug traffickers.

In 1958, after being indicted on drug conspiracy charges, Galante went into hiding. On June 3, 1959, New Jersey State Police officers arrested Galante after stopping his car on the Garden State Parkway close to New York City. Federal agents had recently discovered that Galante was hiding in a house on Pelican Island off the Jersey shore. After posting $100,000 bail, he was released. On May 18, 1960, Galante was indicted on a second set of narcotics charges; he surrendered voluntarily.

Galante&#x27;s first narcotics trial started on November 21, 1960; one of his co-defendants was William Bentvena, a Gambino made man who was murdered by Henry Hill&#x27;s associates James Burke and Thomas DeSimone. From the beginning, the first trial was characterized by jurors and alternates dropping out and coercive courtroom displays by the defendants. On May 15, 1961, the judge declared a mistrial. The jury foreman fell down some stairs at an abandoned building in the middle of the night and was unable to continue the trial due to injury. Galante was sentenced to 20 days in jail for contempt of court. On July 10, 1962, after being convicted in his second narcotics trial, Galante was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison and fined $20,000.

=== Power grab ===

In January 1974, Galante was released from prison on parole. Following his release from prison, Galante allegedly ordered the bombing of the doors to the private mausoleum of his enemy Frank Costello, who had died in 1973, in St. Michael&#x27;s Cemetery.

On February 23, 1974, at a meeting at the Americana Hotel in Manhattan, the Commission named Philip &quot;Rusty&quot; Rastelli as boss. When Rastelli was sent to prison in 1976, Galante seized control of the Bonannos as unofficial acting boss and in turn becoming &quot;de facto&quot; boss.

During the late 1970s, Galante allegedly organized the murders of at least eight members of the Gambino family, with whom he had an intense rivalry, to take over a massive drug-trafficking operation.

On March 3, 1978, Galante&#x27;s parole was revoked by the United States Parole Commission for allegedly associating with other Bonanno mobsters, and he was sent back to prison. However, on February 27, 1979, a judge ruled that the government had illegally revoked Galante&#x27;s parole and ordered his immediate release.

== Assassination ==
The New York crime families were alarmed at Galante&#x27;s brazen attempt to take over the narcotics market. Genovese crime family boss Frank Tieri began contacting Cosa Nostra leaders to build a consensus for Galante&#x27;s murder, even obtaining approval from the retired Joseph Bonanno. In 1979, they received a boost when the official boss, Rastelli, sought Commission approval to kill Galante. Joseph Massino, a Bonanno soldier loyal to Rastelli, relayed the request to the Commission, which swiftly approved a contract on Galante.

On July 12, 1979, Galante was killed just as he finished eating lunch on an open patio at Joe and Mary&#x27;s Italian-American Restaurant at 205 Knickerbocker Avenue in Bushwick, Brooklyn. He was dining with Leonard Coppola, a Bonanno capo and staunch Galante loyalist, and restaurant owner/cousin Giuseppe Turano, a Bonanno soldier. Also sitting at the table were Galante&#x27;s Sicilian bodyguards, Baldassare Amato and Cesare Bonventre. At 2:45 pm, three ski-masked men entered the restaurant, walked into the patio, and opened fire with shotguns and handguns. Galante, Turano, and Coppola were killed instantly. A picture of the murdered Galante showed a cigar still in his mouth. Amato and Bonventre, who had done nothing to protect Galante, were left unharmed. The gunmen then ran out of the restaurant.

=== Aftermath ===
The Archdiocese of New York refused to allow a funeral mass for Galante due to his notoriety. Galante was buried at Saint John&#x27;s Cemetery in Middle Village, Queens.

In 1984, Bonventre was found murdered in a New Jersey warehouse, allegedly to guarantee his silence in the Galante murder. On January 13, 1987, Anthony Indelicato was sentenced to 40 years in prison, as a defendant in the Commission trial, for the Galante, Coppola, and Turano murders.

Galante is depicted in the first episode of the UK history TV channel Yesterday&#x27;s documentary series &quot;Mafia&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;.

<text>Josiah Hornblower (February 23, 1729 – January 21, 1809) was an English engineer and statesman in Belleville, New Jersey. He was a delegate for New Jersey in the Continental Congress in 1785 and 1786.

==Personal life==
Josiah was born in Staffordshire, England, the son of steam power pioneer Joseph Hornblower. As a young man, he studied mechanics and mathematics.

==Career==
===Early career===
In 1745, he started working for his elder brother Jonathan as an engineering apprentice. They went to Cornwall, England and built Newcomen steam engines for use in tin mines. Josiah became an expert in both the engines and mining operations.

===Engineering and military career===
On September 9, 1753, Hornblower was brought to America by the Schuyler family to support their copper mines on New Barbadoes Neck. Hornblower settled in Belleville and is credited with building the first steam engine in America in 1755. There is some dispute about the validity of the project, since he apparently (and illegally) brought two or three sets of critical engine parts with him from England.

He continued to practice mechanical and civil engineering for much of his life. In 1794, he built the first stamping mill in America. (A stamping mill mechanically crushes raw ore for further processing.)

Over the years, Hornblower became American in his attitude as well as by residence. In the French and Indian War, he was a captain in the Essex County Regiment of the New Jersey militia. However, his company was assigned for defence and he didn’t see action. In 1760, he opened a hardware store as an adjunct to his engineering work, and became a prosperous merchant.

===Political career===
For several years, Josiah had acted as a leading citizen. He served as clerk in various town meetings and for his county. As New Jersey established a revolutionary government, Essex County sent him to the state’s Assembly from 1779–1780, and in 1780, the Assembly named him its speaker. From 1781 until 1784, he represented Essex County as a member of the New Jersey Legislative Council, which functioned as an upper house in the legislature.

Then in 1785, the New Jersey assembly sent Hornblower as one of their delegates to the Continental Congress. His term started in November 1785 and ran for a year. While he was diligent in attendance and voting, he wasn’t a leading member of the Congress. After his year, he returned home to attend to his engineering and mercantile pursuits. He was a candidate for Congress in 1788.

==Personal life==
In 1755, Josiah married Elizabeth Kingsland, the daughter of William Kingsland, a Colonel and Judge of Bergen County and neighbor of Schuyler, and Mary (née Pinhorne) Kingsland, daughter of Judge William Pinhorne – a Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court. One of their twelve children was Joseph Coerten Hornblower, who later became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New Jersey.

==Later life and death==
Josiah remained active in engineering circles, and for a time served as the head of a mine association. He expanded his operations, opening various mills in along the Second River and the Passaic River over the next two decades.

He remained somewhat active in public life as well, serving as a County Judge from 1790 until 1808, when his failing health forced him to resign. Josiah died in Newark on January 21, 1809, and is buried in the yard of the Dutch Reformed Church at Belleville.

<text>Târgu Neamț (; , , , ) is a town in Neamț County, Western Moldavia, Romania, on the river Neamț. It had, , a population of 18,029. Three villages are administered by the town: Blebea, Humulești, and Humuleștii Noi.

== History ==
Originally a market town, hence its name (in Romanian &quot;târg&quot; = &quot;market&quot;), it had an important role in Moldavian culture. It was first mentioned in a late-14th century document.

The name &quot;&quot; is a generic name of Slavic origin for the German people in the Romanian language. This has led to speculation of a German foundation of Târgu Neamț, according to which Saxon colonists crossed the Carpathians from the Bistrița area and built a commercial township. Some Romanian historians, including Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu consider that Târgu Neamț was probably a German settlement from the 13th century, when the Teutonic Order made incursions from Transylvania against the Cumanic peoples that were living in Moldavia.

Nowadays, historians disagree with this possibility mostly because of the long-lasting influences of the communist-nationalistic historiography which refused to accept the town was anything else than a Romanian-founded settlement.

==Access==
The town is located at the crossing of two national roads: and . The planned East-West Motorway will bypass the town on its south when completed, providing access to Iași (to the east) and Târgu Mureș to the west. The railroad station is the terminus station of CFR Line 517 linking it to Pașcani via an electrified railway.

==Tourism and attractions==
* The Neamț Fortress (&quot;Cetatea Neamțului&quot;) was built in the 14th century by Voivode Petru I (possibly on the ruins of a smaller Teutonic castle), and is located on the north bank of the Neamț River.
* Târgu Neamț is an appropriate starting point for trips to the monasteries in the region, located all on an average radius: Neamț Monastery, , Agapia Monastery, Văratec Monastery, , and . It is close to the Ceahlău Massif, Durău, and the Bistrița Valley.
* Ion Creangă memorial house in Humulești, across the Ozana river: This is the house where the famous Romanian writer was born and where he spent his childhood. The stories from Ion Creangă&#x27;s masterpiece, &quot;Amintiri din copilărie&quot; (&quot;Memories of my childhood&quot;), revolve around Humulești, Târgu Neamț, and the surrounding villages.
* &quot;Monumentul Eroilor&quot; (Heroes&#x27; Monument): an obelisk that commemorates the Romanian soldiers who fought in World War I is found on Pleșu Hill, near the Pometea suburb. It commands views of the town and the surrounding mountains.
* The Vânători-Neamț Natural Park, housing a herd of wisent, the European bisons that once roamed the Eastern Carpathians.
* The Nicolae Popa ethnographic museum în Târpești.

<text>The Brock University Students&#x27; Union (BUSU) is the students&#x27; union representing the over 17,000 undergraduate students of Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. BUSU is a founding and current member of the Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance.

==Governance==
===Executive===
The Brock University Students&#x27; Union executive is made up of four popularly elected students: the President, the Vice President Student Services, the Vice President External Affairs and the Vice President University Affairs. 

===Administrative Council===
The Brock University Students Administrative Council (BUSAC) is a popularly elected legislative body composed of representatives from all academic faculties of the university as well as representatives for Residence, Off-Campus, and International students.

===Board of Directors===
The Brock University Students&#x27; Union Board of Directors comprises seven members, the president and one other executive member, two members of BUSAC as appointed by BUSAC, as well as three student at large members elected in general elections. The board of directors is responsible for overseeing the human resources of the students&#x27; union, as well as having a fiduciary relationship with the organization, particularly in regard to its corporate and legal responsibilities. The Board also serves a quasi-judicial function as the highest level of appeal for all redresses of grievance with, or within BUSU.

==Services==
BUSU operates student services that have the goal to improve the quality of students on campus experience at Brock.

BUSU is responsible for running the O-Week in conjunction with Brock University during the first week of the school year, putting on all-ages events and information fairs for first-year students at Brock as well as returning students.

BUSU provides extended health and accident insurance programs for Brock students through their health and dental plan. The goal is to provide peace of mind through insurance and to offset costs associated with their health needs. Coverage includes prescription drug coverage, accidental travel insurance, emergency dental coverage, and optical coverage.

BUSU provides every Brock student taking 1.5 credits or more with unlimited use of St. Catharines, Welland, and Niagara Falls Transit. This service is paid for by an ancillary fee collected with student tuition. The U-Pass was first implemented after a student referendum in 2003.

BUSU operates Brock Aid, which is a first aid responders team that provides emergency medical response during BUSU events.

BUSU also oversees BrockTV, the online campus television network. BrockTV provides all facets of student-made content from news briefs and guest lectures, to varsity highlights, musician interviews and entertainment parodies.

===Clubs===
The Brock University Students&#x27; Union ratifies student clubs and provides them with funding and organizational assistance. BUSU provides clubs with room bookings, BUSU.net e-mail addresses, postings on the BUSU bulletin boards and advertising in the Brock Press. BUSU clubs are overseen by the BUSU Vice President Student Services.

==Businesses==
The Brock University Students&#x27; Union operates several businesses on campus, including the campus bar, Isaac&#x27;s; the Students&#x27; Centre cafeteria, Union Station; and the on-campus convenience store General Brock. BUSU is unique to many other students unions in relation to their campus bar as they are one of the few student unions that hold their own liquor license, as opposed to the university holding it.

==Alumni Student Centre==
The Alumni Student Centre is the head office of BUSU and is owned and operated by BUSU. All BUSU offices are housed in the Alumni Student Centre. The Alumni Student Centre contains a lounge for off-campus students, discount photocopiers for student use, and a coffee shop. The offices of the Brock Press and BrockTV are also in the Student Centre. The campus bar, Isaac&#x27;s, Skybar Lounge, and the Union Station food court also occupy the Alumni Student Centre. 

==Representation==
The Brock University Students&#x27; Union was a founding member of the Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance. The student association is also an observer member of Canadian Alliance of Student Associations.

==Controversies==
===Black face incident===
In 2015 a group of Brock students dressed as the Jamaican bobsled team for a Halloween night at Isaac&#x27;s Bar. Some students in the costume were found to have put on black faces, prompting controversy. BUSU has since begun monitoring costumes entering their bar as a result. This was the third time a black face incident had happened on campus, as former students also won for the bobsled team costume, and one in 2009 won the contest for dressing up as Lil&#x27; Wayne.

=== 2022 Student Election Sexual Assault Scandal ===
In February 2022 an anonymous Reddit post alluded to reports of sexual misconduct against one of the student executive candidates. While BUSU was not aware of any such incidents prior to this Reddit post, there was a statement made on Instagram that was later deleted as it was viewed as not supportive of survivors. BUSU apologized for the original statement with the following statement.

“&quot;We recognize that a previous statement made via this social media channel was not written in a way that was supportive of survivors of sexual violence. It was for this reason taken down. We apologize to those who were made to feel unsafe, triggered, or that they could not come forward. This was truly not our intention.&quot;

&quot;We do not believe, and it was not our intention to convey that because this allegation came through certain channels, that it is not fully valid. We do take all allegations very seriously. With full transparency, yes, there have been serious allegations made online against certain candidates in this election. We aim through this statement, and the actions we plan to take, to convey the severity with which we acknowledge any allegations of harassment or misconduct.“&quot;

As a result of the accusations, some portions of the student election were postponed. BUSU staff and board also committed to an action plan that included additional student representation, increasing their Board of Directors to 13 voting students, changing the election process to a nomination process that includes a stricter vetting process of candidates, further Gender and Sexual Violence education and training for all staff and board members through Brock&#x27;s Human Rights and Equity services, and further transparency with all BUSU Board Meetings now filmed and available via YouTube.

<text>Whites Off Earth Now!! is a 1986 studio album by Cowboy Junkies. It was the band&#x27;s debut album, and is composed almost entirely of rock and blues covers. Only one song, &quot;Take Me&quot;, is an original song by the band.

== Album development ==
The Cowboy Junkies formed as a band when Michael Timmins and Alan Anton returned to Canada from England in 1985 and started assembling a new band and a new sound. They rented a house on 547 Crawford Street in Toronto and insulated the garage to form their own rehearsal space, later referred to as Studio 547. They recruited Michael&#x27;s younger brother Pete Timmins for drums and started exploring new sounds, drawing improvisation from jazz musicians Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman, and John Coltrane while applying the sound to the early blues of Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, John Lee Hooker, Bukka White, and Robert Johnson. They recruited Michael&#x27;s older brother John, but he left before the group coalesced. Instead, they recruited Michael&#x27;s younger sister, Margo, who was working as a social worker and not interested in pursuing music and was considering going to graduate school. The musicians developed their languid tempos and whispery tones of their early works by necessity. Their rehearsal space bordered right on their neighbors, and during their first jam session, the neighbors called the police complaining about the noise. The band toned down their sound, and Margo realized that her voice was more effective when sung quiet. The musicians felt if they could get under her quiet voice, the sound was more effective. Pete started using brushes for his drum work, learning to play drums as they went. The band learned to play with less volume.

The band&#x27;s first gig was in 1986 at The Rivoli, a restaurant on Toronto&#x27;s Queen Street bar strip. The music was a rhythmic groove while Margo improvised melodies and sang portions of old blues songs. In the audience was Peter Moore. He states that &quot;The very first show, people weren&#x27;t paying attention to them, because they were playing so softly and quietly. Margo had her back to the audience a lot of the time&quot;. Peter Moore and the band met again later at a dinner party held by Blue Rodeo&#x27;s Greg Keelor, and when they got talking about recording equipment and techniques, Moore found that his interest in single-mic recording meshed with their desire of capturing the intimate sound of their rehearsal garage. Moore had just purchased a high-end Calrec Ambisonic microphone at the wholesale price of $9,000, and would soon have it delivered. The Cowboy Junkies and Moore came together at the Crawford Street house and rehearsal space on June 26, 1986 and turned the garage into a recording studio. Moore arranged the group around his Calrec, jury-rigged a control room in the kitchen, and started recording. Except for a bad moment when the microphone got knocked on the floor, the recording session went smoothly, recording the sound on standard Betamax tapes. Moore placed a mattress in front of the drums to prevent them from over-powering the other instruments. He had Margo sing through a PA to have an electrified voice go with the electric guitars.

The Cowboy Junkies shopped their material around for a bit, but were unable to find a label to distribute their work, so they created their own indie label, Latent Recordings, to release the recording in October 1986.

== Reception ==

The Cowboy Junkies had to distribute the album themselves, but managed to sell four thousand copies, and started to develop a cult following in Toronto. Their audience continued to grow in southern Ontario, and they started getting gigs throughout southern Canada and reaching into southern US by 1987.

&quot;Whites Off Earth Now!!&quot; establishes the sparse country blues sound that took the band to international fame with their next album, 1988&#x27;s &quot;The Trinity Session&quot;. Due to the success of &quot;The Trinity Session&quot;, this album has received far less critical attention over the years.

The album was released on Latent Recordings in 1986, and re-released internationally on RCA Records in 1991. Paul Davies in Q Magazine called the album &quot;a shadow X-ray of the blues, haunting and mesmeric&quot;.

On March 27, 2007, audiophile label Mobile Fidelity reissued the album on SACD and high density vinyl.

<doc id="1215947" wikidata="Q497334" url="?curid=1215947" title="Guadeloupe national football team">
<text>The Guadeloupe national football team () represents the French overseas department and region of Guadeloupe in men&#x27;s international football. The team is controlled by the Ligue guadeloupéenne de football (), a local branch of French Football Federation ().

As an overseas department of the French Republic, Guadeloupe is an integral part of France and is not a member of FIFA and is therefore not eligible to enter the FIFA World Cup or any competition organized first-hand by the organization. Guadeloupeans, being French citizens, are eligible to play for the France national football team. Guadeloupe is, however, a member of CONCACAF and the CFU and is eligible for all competitions organized by both the organizations. Indeed, according to the status of the FFF (article 34, paragraph 6): &quot;[...]Under the control of related continental confederations, and with the agreement of the FFF, those leagues can organize international sport events at a regional level or set up teams in order to participate to them.&quot;

Guadeloupe&#x27;s highest honor to date was reaching the final at the 2010 Caribbean Championship where they were defeated by Jamaica on penalties. In the CONCACAF Gold Cup, Guadeloupe reached the semi-finals in 2007. The team performed well in the group stage defeating Canada and drawing with Haiti. In the knockout stage of the competition, Guadeloupe eliminated Honduras in the quarterfinals. In the semi-finals, Guadeloupe lost to Mexico 1–0.

The regional team also participated in the Caribbean Cup and the Coupe de l&#x27;Outre-Mer. Guadeloupe did not win either competition before they became defunct (2017 and 2013 respectively).

==History==
===International success===
Guadeloupe was a surprise qualifier for the CONCACAF Gold Cup in 2007. The regional team earned qualification to the tournament after finishing in 4th place at the 2006–07 Caribbean Nations Cup. The appearance in the Gold Cup marked Guadeloupe&#x27;s first in the competition and they opened the campaign on 6 June 2007 with a 1–1 draw against Haiti. In the team&#x27;s following match against Canada, Guadeloupe recorded a 2–1 victory in front of 20,000 spectators at the Orange Bowl in Miami. The team finally succumbed to defeat losing 1–0 to the reigning champions of UNCAF, Costa Rica, to close out group play.

Guadeloupe advanced to the knockout stage of the competition as a result of being the second best performing third-place team in group play. In the quarterfinals, Guadeloupe were pitted against Honduras and earned an upset victory defeating the Hondurans 2–1 at the Reliant Stadium in Houston. Prior to its elimination, Honduras had been equal to the task of Guadeloupe having beaten Mexico 2–1 and dominating Cuba 5–0. In the ensuing round, Guadeloupe were defeated by Mexico 1–0. However, despite the loss, Guadeloupe were praised for its strong defensive performance. Guadeloupe&#x27;s finish in the tournament was the best finish by a Caribbean island team since Trinidad and Tobago reached the semifinals of the 2000 tournament.

Guadeloupe&#x27;s respectable third-place finish in the 2008 Caribbean Championship meant a consecutive appearance in the Gold Cup. Ahead of the competition, regional team coach Roger Salnot sought to increase Guadeloupe&#x27;s chances of winning by calling up players of Guadeloupean descent who were born in metropolitan France. Salnot named notable players to his preliminary squad such as goalkeeper Yohann Thuram, defenders Daniel Congré, Michaël Ciani, Ronald Zubar, midfielders Étienne and Aurélien Capoue, and Ludovic Sylvestre, and attackers Alexandre Alphonse, Claudio Beauvue, and Richard Socrier. All players had been effective players in Ligue 1 and abroad. However, despite calling up an abundance of talent, only Alexandre Alphonse was allowed participation by his club. Every other player either personally turned down the invitation or was denied by his parent club with Salnot expressing his disappointment at the latter issue.

In the tournament, Guadeloupe were inserted to Group C alongside Mexico, Panama, and Nicaragua. The team started off the group with two straight victories defeating Panama 2–1 at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum and defeating the Nicaraguans 2–0 at the Reliant Stadium in Houston. In the team&#x27;s final group stage match against Mexico, Guadeloupe was beaten 2–0 in Phoenix. Guadeloupe&#x27;s second-place finish in the group meant another appearance in the knockout stage, where the team was pitted against Costa Rica in the quarter-finals at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. In the match, it was Costa Rica who dominated scoring twice within the first 20 minutes of the match. Costa Rica finished the match with five goals with Guadeloupe getting a consolation goal from Alphonse in the second half.

In 2021, Guadeloupe once again qualified to compete for the Gold Cup.

On 27 June 2023, Guadeloupe was able to tie with Canada 2-2 in the remaining minutes of a 2023 Gold Cup Group Stage match.

<text>The Västmanland Regiment (), designations I 18 and Fo 48, was a Swedish Army infantry regiment that traced its origins back to the 16th century. It was disbanded for the first time in 1927 but later reraised and disbanded again in 1997. The regiment&#x27;s soldiers were originally recruited from the province of Västmanland, and it was later garrisoned there.

== History ==
The regiment has its origins in fänikor (companies) raised in Västmanland in the 1550s and 1560s. In 1617, these units—along with fänikor from the nearby provinces of Dalarna and Uppland—were organised by Gustav II Adolf into Upplands storregemente, of which six of the total 24 companies were recruited in Västmanland. Upplands storregemente consisted of three field regiments, of which Västmanland Regiment was one. Sometime around 1623, the grand regiment was permanently split into three smaller regiments, of which Västmanland Regiment was one.

The regiment was officially raised in 1628 although it had existed since 1623. Västmanland Regiment was one of the original 20 Swedish infantry regiments mentioned in the Swedish constitution of 1634. The regiment&#x27;s first commander was Bengt Bagge. It was allotted in 1682 as one of the first regiments to be so.

The regiment was given the designation I 18 (18th Infantry Regiment) in a general order in 1816. Västmanland Regiment was garrisoned in Västerås from 1906. The regiment was disbanded in 1927, but was reorganised in 1994 as a local defence district with the designation Fo 48, although disbanded again just three years later in 1997.

==Heraldry and traditions==

===Colours, standards and guidons===
The regiment was presented with its last colours (two battalion colours) in 1859 (m/1859), which it received at Ladugardsgärdet in Stockholm. It was used until the regiment was disbanded in 1927. The colour came after a government decision to be used by the Västmanland Wing (F 1). Västmanland Wing took over the colour on 26 September 1943, which also included the regimental battle honours, and it then became Sweden&#x27;s only air force wing with battle honours on its colour. The colour was used until Västmanland Wing was disbanded in 1983.

The new regiment which was raised on 1 July 1994, sought its traditions Västmandland Regiment which was disbanded in 1927. However, the regiment did not inherit the 1859 colour, but received a new colour. The colour was presented to the Västmanland Regiment (Fo 48) in Västerås by the Chief of the Army, lieutenant general Åke Sagrén in 1994. It was used as regimental colour by Fo 48 until 1 September 1997. The colour was drawn by Ingrid Lamby and embroidered by machine in insertion technique by Gunilla Hjort. Blazon: &quot;On white cloth the provincial badge of Västmanland; a threepointed blue mountain, flamed proper. On a blue border at the upper side of the colour, battle honours (Narva 1700, Düna 1701, Kliszów 1702, Fraustadt 1706, Helsingborg 1710, Gadebusch 1712, Valkeala 1790) in white.&quot;

===Coat of arms===
The coat of the arms of the Västmanland Regiment (Fo 48) 1994–1997 and the Västmanland Group (&quot;&quot;) 1997–2004. Blazon: &quot;Argent, the provincial badge of Västmanland, a three-pointed mountain azure, flammant proper. The shield surmounted two muskets in saltire or&quot;.

===Medals===
In connection with the disbandment of Uppsala and Västmanland Defence District on 30 June 2000, the &#x27; (&quot;Uppland-Västmanland Defence District Commemorative Medal&quot;) in silver (UpplVästmlfoMSM) was established. In 2005, the &#x27; (&quot;Västmanland Regiment Commemorative Medal&quot;) in silver (VästmanlfoMSM) was established.

===Heritage===
After the regiment was disbanded in 1997, the regimental traditions was passed on to the Västmanland Group (&#x27;). From 1 July 2013, the traditions are continued by the Västmanland Battalion (&#x27;) within the Uppland and Västmanland Group (&quot;&quot;).

===Other===
The regimental march was &quot;Prinz Friedrich Carl-March&quot;. After the regiment was disbanded, the march was taken over by the Västmanland Wing. However, it came to be titled &quot;&quot;. When the new regiment was raised in 1994, the march regained its original title.

<doc id="1216013" wikidata="Q1587799" url="?curid=1216013" title="Centered nonagonal number">
<text>A centered nonagonal number, (or centered enneagonal number), is a centered figurate number that represents a nonagon with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center dot in successive nonagonal layers. The centered nonagonal number for &quot;n&quot; layers is given by the formula

:formula_1

Multiplying the (&quot;n&quot; - 1)th triangular number by 9 and then adding 1 yields the &quot;n&quot;th centered nonagonal number, but centered nonagonal numbers have an even simpler relation to triangular numbers: every third triangular number (the 1st, 4th, 7th, etc.) is also a centered nonagonal number.

Thus, the first few centered nonagonal numbers are
:1, 10, 28, 55, 91, 136, 190, 253, 325, 406, 496, 595, 703, 820, 946.

The list above includes the perfect numbers 28 and 496.
All even perfect numbers are triangular numbers whose index is an odd Mersenne prime. Since every Mersenne prime greater than 3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3, it follows that every even perfect number greater than 6 is a centered nonagonal number.

In 1850, Sir Frederick Pollock conjectured that every natural number is the sum of at most eleven centered nonagonal numbers. Pollock&#x27;s conjecture was confirmed as true in 2023.

==Congruence Relations==
*All centered nonagonal numbers are congruent to 1 mod 3.
**Therefore the sum of any 3 centered nonagonal numbers and the difference of any two centered nonagonal numbers are divisible by 3.

<text>Charles Baudin (; 21 July 1784 – 7 June 1854), was a French admiral, whose naval service extended from the First Empire through the early days of the Second Empire.

==Biography==
Charles Baudin was born on 21 July 1784 in Paris. His father was Pierre Charles Louis Baudin, a politician who became president of the National Convention.

From 1800 to 1803, Baudin served as a midshipman on &quot;Géographe&quot; and took part in her expedition to Australia.

Baudin then served in the West Indies on board the frigate Piémontaise and later the , where he lost an arm in 1808 during her battle against . In 1809, he became Lieutenant and Commander of the brig , which escorted convoys of merchant vessels between Genoa and Toulon. In 1812, he received the order to convey 14 munitions-laden cargo vessels to Toulon. Although he was pursued by English cruisers, he was able to take his squadron safely to St. Tropez, notably engaging on 11 June. In Toulon he was promoted to Captain. After the battle of Waterloo he was prepared to lead his defeated Emperor Napoleon I through the midst of the English cruisers; Napoleon, however, could not make up his mind in time.

After the Restoration, Baudin was forced into retirement, and in 1816 joined the merchant marine. Under the July Monarchy, he returned to military service and was promoted to Captain in 1934. In 1838, he became a Rear Admiral and became Commander-in-Chief of the squadron sent to Mexico during the so-called &quot;Pastry War&quot;. In this conflict he commanded the French forces at the Battle of Veracruz on 27 November 1838, against the fort of Vera Cruz, San Juan de Ulúa. The fort gave itself up the next day.

In January 1839, Baudin was named a Vice Admiral and in the following year he was entrusted with a military and diplomatic mission to Buenos Aires. He also received command over the fleet in South American waters. In 1841, he took over the Ministry of Marine, but quickly resigned and became maritime prefect in Toulon.

In 1848, after the February Revolution, he became commander-in-chief of France&#x27;s Mediterranean Fleet. In this position, he took part in the Battle of Lazzaroni and of troops against Naples, and then moved toward Sicily, where he was defeated by the forces of Carlo Filangieri.

In 1849, Baudin returned with his family to Ischia, where he died on 7 June 1854. Not long beforehand, he had been named a full Admiral.

<text>Lay It Down is the sixth studio album by the Canadian alt-country band Cowboy Junkies. Released on February 27, 1996, it was the group&#x27;s first album for Geffen Records after the end of their contract with RCA Records. It was the band&#x27;s first album that could be described as straight-ahead rock, rather than country rock, country or blues. It was also their first album consisting entirely of original material, with no covers. &quot;A Common Disaster&quot; and &quot;Speaking Confidentially&quot; were notable hits for the band on Canadian radio.

The album also includes two versions of the track &quot;Come Calling&quot;, which is presented in male and female versions representing two sides of a relationship of an elderly couple, dealing with the pain and anguish of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The &quot;Angel Mine&quot; music video, featuring Janeane Garofalo, was filmed at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles. The song &quot;Hold on to Me&quot; was used in the soundtrack of the 1998 film &quot;Homegrown&quot;.

== Album development ==
The Junkies chose to step outside of Toronto to make &quot;Lay It Down&quot;. They looked for a location that was remote, but a comfortable drive from Toronto, and found Rock Island on Lake Kashabog, which was an island with one house on it. The Junkies visited the house one week at a time, spending time chopping wood, cooking, boating, and hiking, and also working on songs that had the same laid back feeling that the location had. A local person who ferried supplies and equipment over to the island was a gentleman that they knew as Zolt. Zolt had fought in the Korean war on the communist side, flying MIGs for the Bulgarian Air Force. He and his wife came over to the west in the 60s, and settled at Lake Kashabog. Unfortunately, latter in life, Zolt&#x27;s wife developed Alzheimer&#x27;s and had to be hospitalized. Their story became the basis for the song &quot;Come Calling&quot;, one performed uptempo from the man&#x27;s perspective as the survivor, and one performed more subdued, from the woman&#x27;s perspective as the stricken.

When the band was ready to record the music, they looked for a studio that had the same vibe as Rock Island, with a sense of relaxed but focused mood, and a remoteness from the music industry. In Athens, Georgia, they found John Keane and his studio in a big-porched southern house. Keane was selected by the band for his laid-back, independent approach to recording, and also for an impressive resume of artists he had previously worked for. After touring with an expanded cast for the last three albums, the Cowboy Junkies felt a desire to pare back down to a foursome for their next work. The Junkies decided to focus on recording as a four-piece for this album, with Michael Timmins doing all the guitar work. Additional instrumentation was kept to a minimum, although the band introduced strings for the first time, on four of the tracks. Keane&#x27;s assistant David Henry also played cello who recorded solo tracks and with the string quartet. Henry also toured with the band after the album&#x27;s release. With the band&#x27;s history of recording as a whole instead of individually, they wanted to record the strings in the same manner, in order to create a sound of playing with the band instead of just adding more sound. Andy Carlson wrote the arrangements and led the quartet with him on violin, Henry on Cello, Carl Schab also on violin, and Peter Schab on viola. The Junkies kind of let the quartet take over on &quot;Speaking Confidentially&quot;. After the basic tracks were done, Michael Timmins spent a week doing guitar overdubs, and Margo followed up by doing vocal doubling and accompaniments, with Keane mixing the tracks into a whole.

<text>Castleford Tigers are a professional rugby league club in Castleford, West Yorkshire, England. They play their home games at Wheldon Road (currently known as the Mend-A-Hose Jungle for sponsorship reasons) and compete in the Super League, the top flight of the British rugby league system.

Castleford have won the Challenge Cup on four occasions, most recently in 1986. Although the club has never won a League Championship, they have been runners up three times and finished as League Leaders in 2017.

The club has rivalries with neighbours Featherstone Rovers, Leeds Rhinos and Wakefield Trinity. The club&#x27;s traditional home colours are black and amber, with orange also being used in recent years.

== History ==

=== 1896–1906: First Castleford club ===

Castleford RFC joined the Northern Rugby Football Union for the 1896–97 season, its second and remained in the ranks of the semi-professionals until the end of the 1905–06 season. Not much is known about the original Castleford club, except that they have no connection with the present Castleford Tigers RLFC.

=== 1926–1950s: Establishment of second club ===
Castleford joined the league for the 1926–27 season. Many official records state that they were founded at this time but they had played successfully in the lower Yorkshire County Cup for several years before this date. They actually joined the League &quot;code&quot; around 1920 and played in these early years at the Sandy Desert ground, which is now used by amateur club Castleford Lock Lane youth and junior teams. The club went professional in 1926 and moved to their current home ground on Wheldon Road in 1927.

The club soon started to make a mark on northern rugby, winning their first major trophy when they topped the Yorkshire League in 1932, followed by victory in the Challenge Cup in 1935. In 1938, they made it to the Championship finals, but failed to take the cup. The Second World War meant the league was suspended soon after, and Castleford officially abstained from league competition until the 1944–45 season.

=== 1960–1972: Success ===
Castleford finished fourth in the national league in the 1962/63 season. The following season they lost 7–5 to Widnes in the Challenge Cup semi-final replay at Belle Vue, Wakefield in front of a 28,700 crowd after drawing at Station Road, Swinton in the first meeting of the two clubs. Under the direction of coach George Clinton, Castleford won many fans in the &#x27;60s by playing an open and free-flowing style of rugby, earning them the nicknames &quot;Classy Cas&quot; and &quot;High Speed Cas&quot;, the latter playing off the slogan for British Gas in use at the time.

Castleford picked up where they left off when they were again beaten in the Championship finals in 1969, this time conceding defeat to arch-rivals Leeds. However, this loss seemed to spur the team on, and 1969 (v. Salford) and 1970 (v. Wigan) saw Castleford win the Challenge Cup for two consecutive years, with clubs legends Alan Hardisty and Keith Hepworth leading the team.

=== 1973–1995: Consistency ===
John Sheridan was appointed head coach in 1973 for a spell. Castleford finished a respectable ninth in a one-division table but Sheridan stepped down following criticism from fans. During the late 1970s, Castleford edged up the league, and in 1985 they made it to the Premiership final, where they were beaten by Hull Kingston Rovers. A Yorkshire Cup defeat at the beginning of the following season to Hull Kingston Rovers was bettered with a 15–14 triumph at Wembley, again with Hull Kingston Rovers being the opponents. They finished consistently high over the next few years, and finished in the top four clubs in the Championship for four years during 1990–1995.

Darryl van der Velde took Castleford to the Challenge Cup final at Wembley in 1992 where they were defeated by Wigan. A year later, Darryl van der Velde left to become chief executive of the South Queensland Crushers, and was succeeded by his assistant John Joyner.

Through the Darryl van der Velde and early Joyner years Castleford were lauded for their style and were labelled &#x27;Classy Cas&#x27;. This enjoyable playing style was to come to fruition most spectacularly in 1994, when Castleford were dominating the league. As well as defeating a legendary Wigan team to take the Regal Trophy 33–2, they were also semi-finalists in the Challenge Cup and were also narrowly defeated in the Premiership final. That season, John Joyner was named Coach of the Year by the RFL. St. John Ellis scored a then club record 40 league tries over the 1993–94 season.

=== 1996–2004: Super League era ===
When a Super League was suggested, Castleford resisted a merger with Wakefield Trinity and Featherstone Rovers, and became a founder member of the Super League in 1996. The team performed weakly at the start of the season causing the resignation of coach John Joyner. The team avoided relegation by a whisker in 1997 following the appointment of Stuart Raper.

The next season, they managed to frustrate the bleak predictions of pundits to move up the league, finishing sixth at the end of the season, after putting in some good performances and pleasing their fans with a sprinkling of victories.

In 1999, they continued on this upward trajectory, finishing fifth, as well as making the semi-finals of both the Challenge Cup and the Grand Final play-offs. This became one of the most famous seasons in the clubs recent past, with fans still remembering it with reverence. The team included many home grown players, such as Danny Orr, and boasted that years Man of Steel winner Adrian Vowles. In 2000, the rise seemed to stall, as they repeated their fifth-place ranking and made the play-offs for a consecutive season. Raper left Castleford midway through the 2001 campaign to take charge of Wigan and his assistant Graham Steadman took over the reins as head coach.

Castleford made the semi-final of the Challenge Cup in 2002, however the team was to fall down the table over the years to come. Gary Mercer guided Castleford to five wins in their last 10 games after replacing Steadman in 2004 but it was too little to save them from the drop as Castleford were relegated for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. Since the introduction of two divisions for the 1973–74 Northern Rugby Football League season, Castleford had spent 32 years in the top flight of British rugby league. Gary Mercer left the club following their relegation from Super League.

=== 2005–2007: Life in the second tier of Rugby League ===
Dave Woods was appointed head coach and Castleford finished second in the Co-operative Championship in 2005. They were promoted back to the Super League via play-offs following victory in the playoff final against Whitehaven, as well as competing in the Northern Rail Cup final, where they lost to Hull Kingston Rovers.

Terry Matterson joined Castleford in November 2005 in replacement of Woods. Castleford were celebrated for playing a good brand of rugby league, however it was not good enough to stop them from contesting a relegation dog fight which was to culminate in a historic match at Wakefield Trinity&#x27;s Belle Vue, dubbed &#x27;The Battle of Belle Vue&#x27;. It was a fight to stay in the league, and when Castleford lost to Wakefield Trinity, it confirmed their relegation. Many Castleford fans do not accept this relegation and it became a grave point of contention with the governing body. Castleford were relegated from second bottom in front of the newly inducted French side, Catalans Dragons, who had been given immunity from relegation that season, and behind Wigan who had been found guilty of a breach of the salary cap rules.

In 2007, Castleford again made a quick return to Super League as they finished top of the Championship with only one loss all season and defeated Widnes 42–10 in the Co-operative Championship play-off final. Castleford finished bottom of Super League in 2008, but were not relegated due to the newly in place franchise rules.

=== 2009–2012: Re-establishment in Super League ===
In 2009, Castleford saw a brief return to success by reaching the Grand Final play-offs for the first time since Super League VII and made the semi-final of the Challenge Cup in 2011 before being knocked out by Leeds in an 8–10 defeat after extra time. At the end of the season, standout halfback Rangi Chase was announced as the winner of the 2011 Man of Steel award.

Terry Matterson stepped down at the end of the 2011 season to take up a coaching role in Australia and was replaced by former St Helens coach Ian Millward. Millward was released by mutual consent on 9 April 2013 after a poor run of results with 1 win in 18 games and with the team at the bottom of the Super League table. Daryl Powell was appointed head coach in May 2013 taking over from assistant coach Danny Orr, who had been in temporary charge of the club.

=== 2013–2021: Daryl Powell era ===
Under the guidance of Daryl Powell and his assistants Danny Orr and Ryan Sheridan, the Castleford Tigers once again started to see success on and off the field. The 2014 side were again lauded as &#x27;Classy Cas&#x27; for their fast-paced and exciting style, built around home grown players such as captain Michael Shenton, Daryl Clark, and Andy Lynch. The team reached the Challenge Cup final in August 2014, losing to local rivals Leeds Rhinos 23–10 in front of a crowd of 77,914 at Wembley Stadium. Castleford missed out on the League Leaders&#x27; Shield on the final day of the regular season, eventually finishing 4th after defeat to Catalans. In the play-offs, they were defeated 41–0 by St Helens in their qualifying final, and beaten 14–30 by Warrington in their preliminary semi-final to bring the season to a close. At the end of season awards, Daryl Clark was named both Man of Steel and Young Player of the Year, and Powell was awarded Coach of the Year.

On 29 September 2015, the club announced the death of chairman Jack Fulton.

In 2017, the Tigers enjoyed a phenomenal 23 game regular season as they finished 10 points clear at the top of the table before the split, having won 20 and lost just 3 of their games. They went into the Super 8s having already secured a top four play-off spot and lifted the League Leaders&#x27; Shield in August, topping the table for the first time in their 91-year history. In the play-off semi-final against St Helens, Luke Gale - just days after undergoing an emergency appendectomy - kicked a drop goal in golden point extra time to send Cas to their first Grand Final with a 23–22 victory. At Old Trafford, Castleford were defeated 24–6 by Leeds Rhinos with a late consolation score from Alex Foster their sole try. Gale was voted Man of Steel, while Powell picked up the Coach of the Year award for the second time. The Tigers were also represented by six inclusions in the Super League Dream Team.

2018 saw Castleford finish the regular season in 3rd position after an injury-hit year, including the loss of key man Luke Gale for several months with a fractured knee-cap.

Castleford finished the 2019 Super League season in 5th place on the table. Castleford reached the second week of the 2019 Super League play-offs where they were defeated by eventual Grand Finalists Salford Red Devils 22–0 in the elimination semi-final.

In the 2020 Super League season, the club finished a disappointing ninth on the table, their lowest finish since 2013. Despite Castleford&#x27;s poor season, Paul McShane won the 2020 Man of Steel award.

On 5 June 2021, Castleford reached the 2021 Challenge Cup final after defeating Warrington 35–20. In the 2021 Challenge Cup final, Castleford lead St Helens 12–6 at half time but lost the match 26–12 after Saints scored 20 unanswered points in the second half. Castleford finished the 2021 Super League season in 7th place and missed out on the playoffs.

=== 2022–present: New era ===
At the conclusion of the 2021 season, Daryl Powell - by then Super League&#x27;s longest serving head coach - departed Castleford, saying &quot;For both me and the club, it is the right time.&quot; Alongside him, numerous long-serving and influential players moved on, including captain Michael Shenton, Grant Millington, and Oliver Holmes. The new head coach was announced as Lee Radford, ushering the club into a new era with a host of signings. Castleford started the 2022 season poorly before climbing into the playoff places by July. The final match of the year, against Leeds, would see the winners advance to the playoffs - the Tigers conceded two late tries to lose 14–6, finishing their season in 7th place.

After a bleak start to the 2023 season, Radford was terminated as head coach on 6 March and replaced by assistant coach Andy Last. Castleford&#x27;s continued poor form saw them drawn into a relegation scrap with Wakefield, and Last too was dismissed after registering just four wins from nineteen matches. Danny Ward took charge for the final six rounds, with the Tigers eventually finishing in 11th place and narrowly surviving.

Castleford went into the 2024 season under Craig Lingard with a large squad turnover and reduced average age. The team operated with a reduced playing budget as the club prioritised off-field improvements to secure Super League status under the new IMG grading system. They finished the year in 10th place, representing a marginal improvement on the previous campaign. In October 2024, the club announced that board member and investor Martin Jepson had agreed to the purchase of shares owned by the Fulton family, making him majority shareholder and chairman. In the following days, Castleford parted company with Lingard, and it was announced they had achieved a Grade A score in the 2024 club gradings.

== Stadiums ==

=== 1926–27: Sandy Desert ===

In February 1926, Castleford RLFC were accepted into the Northern Rugby Football League from the 1926–27 season. Within a week of their successful application, the club announced that they had agreed to the purchase of Wheldon Road for their future home. While improvements were carried out, they played their first season as professionals at the Sandy Desert ground, located on the west side of Lock Lane, which had been their home as an amateur side. The site is now used by amateur club Castleford Lock Lane.

=== 1927–present: Wheldon Road ===
Wheldon Road was built in 1926, originally intended to be the home of association football club Castleford Town. In February 1926, within a week of Castleford RLFC&#x27;s successful application to join the Northern Rugby Football League, the club announced that they had agreed to buy the ground. They had negotiated an £800 loan from the RFL to finance the purchase. The club spent a year making improvements to spectator facilities, reseeding the playing area and replacing the perimeter fencing before finally moving in from the 1927–28 season.

On 9 March 1935, the ground set its record attendance when 25,449 spectators watched Castleford play a third-round Challenge Cup match against Hunslet.

Castleford installed floodlights at Wheldon Road ahead of the 1965–66 season, becoming the seventh rugby league club to do so. This enabled their participation in the inaugural BBC2 Floodlit Trophy.

In the early 2000s, the stadium was renamed The Jungle as a result of sponsorship from online retailer Jungle.com. This moniker proved popular with supporters, with the club seeking to reinstate the name alongside subsequent naming rights holders.



=== Proposed relocations ===
The Lateral Property group submitted a planning application for a proposed £135 million development and Five Towns Stadium in Glasshoughton. Outline planning permission was given to the development in 2015, with Reserved Matters applications to follow. In early 2018, Lateral Property Group announced that site had been renamed Axiom, working with partner Highgrove Plc, a scheme which would include food, a country park and an omni-retail experience. Numerous planning applications have been submitted through Wakefield MDC Planning Department to discharge conditions as well as amend the scheme slightly, with a Reserved Matters application for Phase 1 and 2a of the work approved. The schedule provided by the developers is that work on supporting roads and groundworks will begin in Summer/Autumn 2018 with the stadium to be completed in time for the 2021 season. In July 2018, an application was submitted to increase the capacity of the proposed ground from 10,000 to 10,245.

<text>Scott Garlick (born May 29, 1972, in Phoenix, Arizona) is an American retired soccer goalkeeper who played 10 seasons in Major League Soccer from 1997 to 2006.

Garlick went on trial to Waterford United in 1994. Initially for a month he stayed for two seasons before returning home in the hope of signing for a MLS club.

Garlick was not initially drafted by an MLS team; instead, he signed with the Greensboro Dynamo of the USISL. D.C. United called him up early in the 1997 MLS season, and then signed him for good later in the year. Garlick promptly backstopped DC to the MLS Cup, but the emergence of Tom Presthus led United to trade Garlick to the Tampa Bay Mutiny prior to the 1999 season.

Garlick spent two and a half seasons in Tampa, until he was traded to the Colorado Rapids in a deal that saw him packaged with Carlos Valderrama. He left Tampa as the team&#x27;s all-time leader in most goalkeeping categories. He recorded 184 saves in the year 2000, an MLS single-season record that still stands today.
Garlick spent two and a half seasons with the Rapids as well, but the arrival of Joe Cannon and Scott&#x27;s subsequent controversial benching for the 2003 playoffs opened the door for his departure. He was traded to the Dallas Burn prior to the 2004 season. Although Garlick began the season as the starter, he lost his job to Jeff Cassar down the stretch. He was traded to Real Salt Lake at the conclusion of the 2005 season.

Garlick is a graduate of Brophy College Preparatory in Phoenix.

In late February 2007 Garlick retired from soccer. In March 2007, he joined Cushman and Wakefield as a Senior Director of tenant representation.

<text>Hell is a lunar crater in the south of the Moon&#x27;s near side, within the western half of the enormous walled plain Deslandres. To the southeast, also within Deslandres, is the larger crater Lexell, and about 9° to the south lies the prominent Tycho crater. The crater received its name in 1935 after the Hungarian astronomer and ordained Jesuit priest Maximilian Hell. It has 19 satellite craters with diameters ranging between about 3 and 22 km. Nearly all Hell craters are relatively flat and shallow, with a sharp, well-defined rim and a typical diameter-to-depth ratio of about 10.

==Description==
Hell is somewhat circular but with an outward bulge along the western rim. The interior floor is rolling and uneven, with several hills and a central peak about 1 km tall. The sharp-edged rim is not significantly eroded, and has a narrow inner wall; it is 2–3 times higher on the north-west than on the east where it rises by about 820 meters.

==Satellite craters==

Nineteen satellite craters were found near Hell. Whereas many of them were described in the 19th century, their naming was officially recognized by the IAU only in 2006. They are labeled by capital Latin letters following the nomenclature established by Johann Heinrich von Mädler in the 1820s. However, their order is not systematic, either by diameter, by distance from the central crater or by the azimuthal angle, as agreed for some other lunar craters. Their shape is similar to that of the main crater, with nearly flat bottom, nearly round shape and a distinct thin rim. Hell A, B and C – the largest satellites – have one irregularity in the rim for each crater, facing south-west, north-west and south, respectively. Whereas most Hell satellites are separated from one another, Hell L and M merge forming an elongated shape. The rim is rather diffuse in Hell T, V and W and could have been smoothened by the ejecta of the main Hell crater. Letters I and O are omitted in the modern nomenclature, in order to keep the number of available symbols 24, that is equal to the number of azimuthal sectors (clock system). However, the reason for lacking Hell D, F, G is uncertain. Hell Q has two sub-satellites, 7 and 8 o&#x27;clock from it. These three craters, all of similar size, were sometimes referred to as Q, QA and QB, but only one was recognized by the IAU in 2006, and named Hell Q. It is a relatively recent crater with the age estimated as younger than that of Tycho, that is younger than about 108 million years.

==History and etymology==
The crater was named after the Hungarian astronomer and an ordained Jesuit priest Maximilian Hell (1720–1792). The name was first given by Johann Hieronymus Schröter to the entire plane, Hell plane, which is now known as Deslandres, but Mädler reassigned it to the crater. It was officially recognized by Mary Adela Blagg and Karl Müller in the first official version of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) nomenclature for lunar features in 1935. Hell B was previously known as Schupmann and Hell Q as Cassini&#x27;s Bright Spot.

<text>Nicodemo Domenico Scarfo Sr. (March 8, 1929 – January 13, 2017) also known as &quot;Little Nicky&quot;, was an American mobster who served as boss of the Philadelphia crime family from 1981 to 1990. Infamously known for his murderous reputation, Scarfo led the family through its bloodiest period until his conviction in 1988.

During his criminal career Scarfo engaged in organized crime activities such as drug trafficking, extortion, labor union racketeering and gambling. In 1988, he was convicted of multiple charges including conspiracy, racketeering and first degree murder. His trial consisted of the damaging testimonies of several informants, who had carried out his murders. Scarfo died in prison on January 13, 2017, while serving his 55-year sentence.

He was the father of Nicky Scarfo Jr., a Lucchese family soldier, who was sentenced in 2015 to 30 years in prison for security fraud, racketeering, and illegal gambling.

==Early life==
Scarfo was born on March 8, 1929, in Brooklyn, New York, to Philip and Catherine Scarfo, Italian immigrants from Naples and Calabria. At the age of 12, Scarfo and his family moved to South Philadelphia, where he worked as a day laborer and later graduated from Benjamin Franklin High School in 1947. He was 5 feet 5 inches tall. He became an amateur boxer, fighting in small clubs throughout Philadelphia, earning himself a reputation for his aggressive temper in the ring. After failing to become a success in the boxing world, Scarfo joined his uncle Nicky Buck, a Philly Mob soldier, in illegal activities in Philadelphia. He also worked as a bartender at a club owned by his uncle while being apprenticed by Buck, alongside his two other uncles.

==Criminal years==
In 1954, Scarfo was proposed for membership into the Philadelphia crime family. He was inducted by then boss Joseph Ida at a ceremony held in New Jersey, alongside two of his uncles who were also inducted as full-fledged soldiers. Scarfo was reportedly arrogant and stubborn, having declined to marry the daughter of Consigliere Joe Rugnetta, leaving him embarrassed and disrespected, briefly causing friction within the family. In 1963, Scarfo pleaded guilty to manslaughter for fatally stabbing a longshoreman; he spent about six months in prison. After his release, he was sent to Atlantic City, New Jersey by Angelo Bruno to oversee the operations there. Scarfo served almost two years in prison from 1971 to 1973 for refusing to testify to the New Jersey State Commission of Investigation. He served time with boss Angelo Bruno and Genovese crime family members Gerardo Catena and Louis Manna, the latter of whom he formed a close relationship with.

In 1976, Atlantic City legalized gambling, and Scarfo prioritized gambling as his main source of income. At the time he was dispatched to Atlantic City, it was considered a backwater. However, its rise as a gambling mecca made Scarfo a powerhouse.

His cement contracting company &quot;Scarf, Inc&quot;, which was shared with his nephew, received business as developers built new casinos in Atlantic City; Scarfo would intimidate businesses into buying from his company. In 1978, Scarfo and his associate, Nicholas &quot;Nick the Blade&quot; Virgilio, shot and murdered judge Edwin Helfant for refusing to cooperate with them and to help Virgilio receive a lighter sentence as he was facing murder charges, in exchange for $12,500. Scarfo acted as the getaway driver. Meanwhile, Virgilio fired numerous rounds into the judge as he dined with his wife in a restaurant. He made it a public execution and made him an example to anyone that wasn&#x27;t willing to give him what he wanted. In 1979, criminal associate and contractor Vincent Falcone was shot twice and killed by Scarfo&#x27;s nephew Phil Leonetti on Scarfo&#x27;s orders, after making negative remarks about the company and Scarfo.

==Power struggle==
Longtime Boss Angelo Bruno was murdered in 1980. His murder was orchestrated by his Consigliere, Antonio Caponigro. Weeks later, Caponigro faced the consequence of killing a Boss without the approval of the American Mafia Commission. He was found shot dozens of times in a car trunk and $300 in bills were jammed in his mouth and anus as a sign of his own greed. Phil Testa became the new Boss of the Philadelphia crime family, appointing Scarfo as his Consigliere. However, his tenure as Boss would be a short one. Testa was killed by a nail bomb under his porch in 1981, on orders of his Underboss and drug trafficker Peter Casella and Capo Frank Narducci Sr., which later resulted in Narducci being gunned down and Casella being banished from the Mob and fleeing to Florida.

Testa&#x27;s murder sparked a war within the family. Scarfo seized the top position for himself, promoting Salvatore Merlino as his Underboss and Frank Monte as his Consigliere. Scarfo would go on to lead the family for a decade with a bloody rampage, fueled by paranoia and aggression. Between August 1982 and January 1984, Scarfo was imprisoned in FCI La Tuna for gun possession. While in prison, Scarfo always had two bodyguards accompanying him; who were associates of the Mexican Mafia, whom he referred to as his “pistoleros”. During that time, aging Capo Harry Riccobene began to form another faction that opposed Scarfo. The war would cost him his little brother&#x27;s life, his brother Mario to become a government informant and Riccobene himself to be given a life sentence for first degree murder.

In 1984, Scarfo ordered the death of Salvatore Testa, one of his Capos and top hitmen, as Testa&#x27;s ambition and growing popularity made Scarfo feel threatened. Testa was the son of former Boss Phil Testa, who had been Scarfo&#x27;s close friend and mentor. As a result of Salvatore Testa&#x27;s murder, Scarfo gained a reputation for disloyalty, and several criminal organizations across the United States began to distrust him.

==Downfall of Scarfo==
In 1985, Scarfo plotted to extort $1 million from major commercial developer Willard Rouse, sending his soldier Nicholas Caramandi and another associate to do it. Rouse refused and immediately contacted the FBI. The FBI began a case to tackle Scarfo, sending an undercover agent to pose as a representative of Rouse. This led Caramandi, a notable and feared hitman, to cooperate and testify against the organization. In 1986, Caramandi was indicted for his role in the extortion case and decided to testify in court. Between 1987 and 1989, Scarfo was convicted three times—for conspiracy, racketeering, and first-degree murder, being sentenced to consecutive prison terms of 14 years, 55 years and life, although the life sentence was later overturned. Scarfo&#x27;s nephew, Phil Leonetti, who he had promoted to Underboss in 1986, also turned state&#x27;s evidence in 1989 after a RICO conviction.

During the trial, Scarfo&#x27;s son Mark Scarfo attempted suicide on November 1, 1988. Mark, then only 17 years old, had been taunted for years by classmates about his father&#x27;s criminal activities. Increasingly despondent over his father&#x27;s possible imprisonment, Mark Scarfo hanged himself in the office of his father&#x27;s concrete supply company in Atlantic City. He was discovered by his mother, and paramedics were able to resuscitate him. He suffered cardiac arrest and his brain was deprived of oxygen. He entered a coma where he remained until his death in April 2014.

==Death==
Scarfo began his sentence at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary. He was later transferred to the Federal Medical Center in Butner, North Carolina, where he died of natural causes on January 13, 2017. His register number was 09813–050.

<text>Telesilla () was an ancient Greek lyric poet from Argos, active in the fifth century BC. She is known for her supposed role in the defence of Argos in 494 BC, which is doubted by modern scholars. Only a few fragments of her poetry survive, several of which reference the gods Apollo and Artemis. The longest surviving fragment, only two lines, is quoted by the grammarian Hephaestion to illustrate the Telesillan metre, named after her. She was apparently famous in antiquity, included by Antipater of Thessalonica in his canon of women poets; in the twentieth century she inspired a poem by the imagist poet H.D.

==Life==
Little is known of Telesilla&#x27;s life. She was from the Peloponnesian city of Argos. A tradition reported by both Plutarch and Pausanias associates her with the defence of the city after the Battle of Sepeia in 494 BC; according to Eusebius her floruit was around 450 BC. If both these dates are correct, she would have lived a relatively long life. Alternatively, Maria Elisabetta Colonna has proposed that she was born . Plutarch says that Telesilla was from an aristocratic family; Martin Litchfield West suggests that she held a hereditary priesthood, as names beginning &quot;Telesi–&quot; were sometimes associated with such families.

Plutarch reports that Telesilla was sickly; on the instructions of an oracle she became a poet, and was cured. According to both Plutarch and Pausanias, when Cleomenes I of Sparta attacked Argos in 494 BC and defeated the Argive army at Sepeia, Telesilla organised the old men, slaves, and women of the city to defend it until the Spartans withdrew. Plutarch says that Telesilla&#x27;s victory was celebrated by the festival of Hybristica. The battle is described by Herodotus, who does not mention Telesilla&#x27;s defence of the city, and modern scholars mostly doubt the historicity of the story. It is generally believed to be invented to explain a Delphic oracle which referred to the female driving out the male; the inclusion of Telesilla in the legend was perhaps inspired by something in her poetry. However, some scholars such as R. A. Tomlinson and Jennifer Martinez Morales have argued that the story of women defending the city is plausible, though Tomlinson suggests that Telesilla&#x27;s role was exaggerated.

==Poetry==

Nine fragments of Telesilla&#x27;s poetry survive in quotation or paraphrase, with only one being longer than a single word. What little survives suggests that, like Corinna, Telesilla concentrated on local legends. Both Pausanias and Plutarch state that she was well regarded by women in particular, and her surviving fragments suggest that she was interested in women&#x27;s lives. Five fragments of her poetry relate to the gods Artemis and Apollo, and one apparently comes from a poem about the wedding of Zeus and Hera. According to Maximus of Tyre, Telesilla&#x27;s poetry inspired the Argives. Umbertina Lisi suggested that this referred to war poetry, though Telesilla&#x27;s surviving fragments are religious rather than martial.

A glyconic meter, the Telesillan, was named for her. The longest surviving fragment of Telesilla is two lines quoted by the grammarian Hephaestion to illustrate this meter, about the myth of Alpheus. It is addressed to &quot;maidens&quot; (κοραι), and was possibly a choral poem written for performance at a local festivals, used in the education of girls of noble families.

Telesilla&#x27;s poetry was apparently admired in antiquity. According to Eusebius she was as famous as Bacchylides, and Antipater of Thessalonica included her in his canon of nine women poets. According to Pausanias, there was a stele to Telesilla in front of the temple of Aphrodite in Argos which depicted her holding a helmet and with her poems on the ground around her, and Tatian reports that Niceratus sculpted her.

In the modern world, Telesilla inspired H.D.&#x27;s poem &quot;Telesila&quot;, and she is included in Judy Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Heritage Floor&quot;, accompanying the place setting for Aspasia in &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;.

<doc id="1216056" wikidata="Q5406097" url="?curid=1216056" title="Euclid Avenue (Cleveland)">
<text>Euclid Avenue is a major street in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. It runs northeasterly from Public Square in Downtown Cleveland, passing Playhouse Square and Cleveland State University, to University Circle, the Cleveland Clinic, Severance Hall, Case Western Reserve University&#x27;s Maltz Performing Arts Center (formerly the Temple Tifereth Israel), Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Case Medical Center. The street runs through the suburbs of East Cleveland, Euclid, and Wickliffe, to Willoughby as a part of U.S. Route 20 and U.S. Route 6. The HealthLine bus rapid transit line runs in designated bus lanes in the median of Euclid Avenue from Public Square to Louis Stokes Station at Windermere in East Cleveland.

It received nationwide attention from the 1860s to the 1920s for its beauty and wealth, including a string of mansions that came to be known as Millionaires&#x27; Row. There are several theaters, banks, and churches along Euclid, as well as Cleveland&#x27;s oldest extant building, the Dunham Tavern. It can be reached through the Healthline.

==Millionaires&#x27; Row==

In the second half of the 19th century and early in the 20th century, Euclid Avenue was internationally known. Baedeker&#x27;s Travel Guides called the elm-lined avenue &quot;The Showplace of America&quot;, and designated it as a must see for travelers from Europe. The concentration of wealth was unparalleled; the tax valuation of the mansions along &quot;the Avenue&quot; far exceeded the valuation of New York&#x27;s Fifth Avenue in the late 19th century. Accounts at the time compared it to the Avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris and the Unter den Linden in Berlin.

Families living along &quot;Millionaires&#x27; Row&quot; included those of John D. Rockefeller (during the period, 1868–84), Sylvester T. Everett, Isaac N. Pennock I (inventor of the first steel railway car in the US), arc light inventor Charles F. Brush, George Worthington, Horace Weddell, Marcus Hanna, Ambrose Swasey, Amasa Stone, John Hay (personal secretary to Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of State under William McKinley), Jeptha Wade (Cleveland benefactor and founder of Western Union Telegraph), Samuel Augustus Fuller (steel industrialist), Alfred Atmore Pope (iron industrialist and art collector), Charles E.J. Lang (automobile industrialist), Worthy S. Streator (railroad baron, coal mine developer, and founder of the city of Streator, Illinois), Mary Corinne Quintrell (clubwoman), and Charles Lathrop Pack. Euclid Avenue&#x27;s most infamous resident was con artist Cassie Chadwick, the wife of Leroy Chadwick, who was unaware that his wife was passing herself off to bankers as the illegitimate daughter of steel magnate Andrew Carnegie.

Architect Charles F. Schweinfurth designed at least 15 mansions on the street. Samuel Mather&#x27;s Mansion, built around 1910, &quot;was among the last&quot; to be built on Euclid Avenue. The Mather Mansion remains as part of Cleveland State University, but most of the homes were later demolished.

==Growth of commercial district and decline of Millionaires&#x27; Row==

Charles Lathrop Pack is credited with at least part of the development of Euclid Avenue, on which he lived from about 1888 to the early years of the 20th century, into a thriving business district. According to Eyle, &quot;In 1913, an article about Charles reported that &#x27;inside of ten years...the [one-story, commercial buildings that he had developed at the lower end of Euclid Avenue] have disappeared. In their stead are skyscrapers, great retail establishments, magnificent banks, and a hotel that cost $2,000,000. Much of the land is owned by Mr. Pack and is leased for long periods. He helped to organize the companies which erected the buildings. It is said that his rentals, out of which not a penny is subtracted for taxes or anything else, amount to $100,000 a year.&quot;

As Cleveland&#x27;s commercial district began to push eastward along Euclid Avenue, families moved east towards University Circle. However, southeast of University Circle, the topography of the area rises sharply into what is referred to as &quot;The Heights&quot;, and the development of Cleveland Heights and Shaker Heights, along with more efficient means of travel, became more attractive than the increasingly commercialized Euclid Avenue.

By the 1920s, the former &quot;Millionaires&#x27; Row&quot; was in decline. During the Great Depression, many mansions were converted by their owners into rooming houses, which accelerated the decline. In the 1950s, Cleveland&#x27;s Innerbelt Freeway cut through the Euclid Avenue neighborhood between downtown and the rail crossing at East 55th Street. By the 1960s, the street that once rivaled Fifth Avenue as the most expensive address in the United States was a two-mile (3 km) long slum of commercial buildings and substandard housing. In the late 1960s, Cleveland Cavaliers owner Nick Mileti announced plans to move the basketball club from Euclid Avenue&#x27;s Cleveland Arena to a new arena in suburban Richfield Township.

==Legacies and redevelopment==
Eight houses from the era remain on Euclid, including the Samuel Mather and Howe mansions owned and used by Cleveland State University. One of the most recent to be demolished was the Lyman Treadway Mansion, which served as part of the Cleveland Museum of Health from the 1930s until it was razed in 2002 for a new museum building.

The Euclid Avenue Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

On August 5, 1914, the American Traffic Signal Company installed a traffic signal system on the corner of East 105th Street and Euclid Avenue, the first traffic light installed in the United States and the first electric traffic light in the world.

===Theaters of Playhouse Square===
In their 1949 musical &quot;South Pacific&quot;, Rodgers and Hammerstein indirectly acknowledged the street&#x27;s fame. In the script, Captain Brackett sends a grass skirt to one &quot;Amelia Fortuna, 325 Euclid Avenue, Shaker Heights, Cleveland, Ohio&quot;. Theaters on Euclid include the Allen Theatre, State Theatre, Ohio Theatre, and Palace Theater.

==Recent events==

In April 2006, parts of Euclid Avenue were closed to traffic for the filming of a scene from the film &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;. No major stars were on location, but the filming drew thousands of gawkers. Most of the filming involved explosions and destroyed cars, with hired extras walking the sidewalks. The sections of the street that were closed off were redressed to resemble a city street in New York City, complete with magazine stands and poster-covered walls.

The Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority completely refurbished the western section of Euclid Avenue as part of the Euclid Corridor Transportation Project, which opened fully in 2008. A bus rapid transit line, the HealthLine, now runs from Public Square to the Stokes Rapid Transit station in East Cleveland, which is the eastern terminus of the Red Line rapid transit route. The refurbishing also entailed development – , more than $3.3 billion worth of completed or proposed urban renewal projects lined the street and surrounding area.

== Route designations ==
Euclid Avenue, originally known as part of the Buffalo Stage Road, has carried various route designations throughout history:

* Prior to 1923 Euclid Avenue carried Inter-county Route 2 and Main Market Road VI in parts.
* In 1923, when Ohio introduced the modern numbering system, State Route 2 and State Route 15 were assigned to Euclid Avenue from Public Square in Cleveland to Mayfield Road in the University Circle neighborhood, and SR 2 was assigned to it from there to Willoughby.
* In 1926 SR 2 was rerouted onto Superior Avenue, leaving Euclid Avenue as only SR 15 from Public Square to Mayfield Road, and undesignated from there to Superior Avenue in East Cleveland.
* In 1927 U.S. Route 20 replaced SR 2 in most places including along Euclid Avenue, and U.S. Route 322 replaced SR 15.
* In 1932 U.S. Route 6 was added to the US 20 portion from Superior Avenue eastward to Euclid.
* In 1936 U.S. Route 6 Alternate and U.S. Route 20 Alternate were created to run along the US 322 portion from Public Square to Mayfield Road then along the previously undesignated section from there to Superior Avenue.
* In 1950 US 322 was shifted north to run along Superior Avenue and Chester Avenue from Public Square to Euclid Avenue in University Circle. US 322 remains on Euclid Avenue from Chester Avenue to Mayfield Road.
* In 1967 US 20 was removed from Superior Avenue and US 6 and placed on Euclid Avenue from Public Square to Superior Avenue in East Cleveland, replacing Alt. US 6 and Alt. US 20.

<doc id="1216060" wikidata="Q410851" url="?curid=1216060" title="Nitride">
<text>In chemistry, a nitride is a chemical compound of nitrogen. Nitrides can be inorganic or organic, ionic or covalent. The nitride anion, N3- ion, is very elusive but compounds of nitride are numerous, although rarely naturally occurring. Some nitrides have a found applications, such as wear-resistant coatings (e.g., titanium nitride, TiN), hard ceramic materials (e.g., silicon nitride, Si3N4), and semiconductors (e.g., gallium nitride, GaN). The development of GaN-based light emitting diodes was recognized by the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics. Metal nitrido complexes are also common.

Synthesis of inorganic metal nitrides is challenging because nitrogen gas (N2) is not very reactive at low temperatures, but it becomes more reactive at higher temperatures. Therefore, a balance must be achieved between the low reactivity of nitrogen gas at low temperatures and the entropy driven formation of N2 at high temperatures. However, synthetic methods for nitrides are growing more sophisticated and the materials are of increasing technological relevance.

==Uses of nitrides==
Like carbides, nitrides are often refractory materials owing to their high lattice energy, which reflects the strong bonding of &quot;N3−&quot; to metal cation(s). Thus, cubic boron nitride, titanium nitride, and silicon nitride are used as cutting materials and hard coatings. Hexagonal boron nitride, which adopts a layered structure, is a useful high-temperature lubricant akin to molybdenum disulfide. Nitride compounds often have large band gaps, thus nitrides are usually insulators or wide-bandgap semiconductors; examples include boron nitride and silicon nitride. The wide-band gap material gallium nitride is prized for emitting blue light in LEDs. Like some oxides, nitrides can absorb hydrogen and have been discussed in the context of hydrogen storage, e.g. lithium nitride.

==Examples==
Classification of such a varied group of compounds is somewhat arbitrary. Compounds where nitrogen is not assigned −3 oxidation state are not included, such as nitrogen trichloride where the oxidation state is +3; nor are ammonia and its many organic derivatives.

===Nitrides of the s-block elements===
Only one alkali metal nitride is stable, the purple-reddish lithium nitride (), which forms when lithium burns in an atmosphere of . Sodium nitride and potassium nitride has been generated, but remains a laboratory curiosity. The nitrides of the alkaline earth metals that have the formula are however numerous. Examples include beryllium nitride (), magnesium nitride (), calcium nitride (), and strontium nitride (). The nitrides of electropositive metals (including Li, Zn, and the alkaline earth metals) readily hydrolyze upon contact with water, including the moisture in the air:

===Nitrides of the p-block elements===
Boron nitride exists as several forms (polymorphs). Nitrides of silicon and phosphorus are also known, but only the former is commercially important. The nitrides of aluminium, gallium, and indium adopt the hexagonal wurtzite structure in which each atom occupies tetrahedral sites. For example, in aluminium nitride, each aluminium atom has four neighboring nitrogen atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron and similarly each nitrogen atom has four neighboring aluminium atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron. This structure is like hexagonal diamond (lonsdaleite) where every carbon atom occupies a tetrahedral site (however wurtzite differs from sphalerite and diamond in the relative orientation of tetrahedra). Thallium(I) nitride () is known, but thallium(III) nitride (TlN) is not.

===Transition metal nitrides===
Most metal-rich transition metal nitrides adopt a relatively ordered face-centered cubic or hexagonal close-packed crystal structure, with octahedral coordination. Sometimes these materials are called &quot;interstitial nitrides&quot;. They are essential for industrial metallurgy, because they are typically much harder and less ductile than their parent metal, and resist air-oxidation. For the group 3 metals, ScN and YN are both known. Group 4, 5, and 6 transition metals (the titanium, vanadium and chromium groups) all form chemically stable, refractory nitrides with high melting point. Thin films of titanium nitride, zirconium nitride, and tantalum nitride protect many industrial surfaces.

Nitrides of the group 7 and 8 transition metals tend to be nitrogen-poor, and decompose readily at elevated temperatures. For example, iron nitride, decomposes at 200 °C. Platinum nitride and osmium nitride may contain units, and as such should not be called nitrides.

Nitrides of heavier members from group 11 and 12 are less stable than copper nitride () and zinc nitride (): dry silver nitride () is a contact explosive which may detonate from the slightest touch, even a falling water droplet.

===Nitrides of the lanthanides and actinides===
Nitride containing species of the lanthanides and actinides are of scientific interest as they can provide a useful handle for determining covalency of bonding. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy along with quantum chemical analysis has often been used to determine the degree to which metal nitride bonds are ionic or covalent in character. One example, a uranium nitride, has the highest known nitrogen-15 chemical shift.

===Molecular nitrides===

Many metals form molecular nitrido complexes, as discussed in the specialized article. The main group elements also form some molecular nitrides. Cyanogen () and tetrasulfur tetranitride () are rare examples of a molecular binary (containing one element aside from nitrogen) nitrides. They dissolve in nonpolar solvents. Both undergo polymerization. is also unstable with respect to the elements, but less so that the isostructural . Heating gives a polymer, and a variety of molecular sulfur nitride anions and cations are also known.

Related to but distinct from nitride is pernitride diatomic anion () and the azide triatomic anion (N3−).

<doc id="1216061" wikidata="Q1940281" url="?curid=1216061" title="Twist and Shout (album)">
<text>Twist and Shout is the Beatles&#x27; second album released in Canada, in mono by Capitol Records (catalogue number T-6054) on 3 February 1964. It consists of songs mostly drawn from &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, their first LP released in the United Kingdom. This album, like its parent album, contains both original Beatles songs, as well as covers (including its namesake, &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;), denoted in the track listing.

==Track listing==


==Differences from &quot;Please Please Me&quot;==
*&quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; (the opening track of &quot;Please Please Me&quot;) and &quot;Misery&quot; were omitted from &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;. They both appear on the next Canadian LP release, &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Long Tall Sally&quot;. 
*&quot;From Me to You&quot; and &quot;She Loves You&quot; were added to &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;. They were issued as the A-sides of singles in the UK.
* The two albums&#x27; front and back covers differ significantly.

==Reissues==
&quot;Twist and Shout&quot; received miscellaneous reissues since the initial release date. The initial release was exclusively mono audio, because stereo record players were not popular in Canada at the time of release and therefore not profitable. Early copies of the record were manufactured with a limited edition 8x10 inch poster of the Beatles. The subsequent reissues attributed Parr&#x27;s, the printer commissioned by Capitol to create the cardboard record jackets as well as other minor variations in the label, font size, and catalogue numbers. &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; was eventually reissued in stereo in the 1970s, bearing catalogue number ST-6054 to denote stereo audio; all tracks were in stereo except for &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;, and &quot;She Loves You&quot;, which remained mono. The stereo reissue is considered to be the definitive version.

<text>Data rooms are spaces used for housing data, usually of a secure or privileged nature. They can be physical data rooms, virtual data rooms, or data centers. They are used for a variety of purposes, including data storage, document exchange, file sharing, financial transactions, legal transactions, and more.

In mergers and acquisitions, the traditional data room will genuinely be a physically secured and continually monitored room, normally in the vendor&#x27;s offices (or those of their lawyers), which the bidders and their advisers will visit in order to inspect and report on the various documents and other data made available. Often only one bidder at a time will be allowed to enter and if new documents or new versions of documents are required these will have to be brought in by courier as hardcopy. Teams involved in large due diligence processes will typically have to be flown in from many regions or countries and remain available throughout the process. Such teams often comprise a number of experts in different fields and so the overall cost of keeping such groups on call near to the data room is often extremely high. Combating the significant cost of physical data rooms is the virtual data room, which provides for the secure, online dissemination of confidential information.

A virtual data room (VDR) is essentially a website with limited controlled access (using a secure log-on supplied by the vendor/authority which can be disabled at any time by the vendor/authority if a bidder withdraws) to which the bidders and their advisers are given access. Much of the information released will be confidential and restrictions should be applied to the viewers&#x27; ability to release this to third parties by forwarding, copying or printing. Digital rights management is sometimes applied to control information.

With annual growth of about 16% over seven years the virtual data room market forecast is $1.6 Billion. Detailed auditing must be provided for legal reasons so that a record is kept of who has seen which version of each document.

Data rooms are commonly used by legal, accounting, investment banking and private equity companies performing mergers and acquisitions, fundraising especially with startups, insolvency, corporate restructuring, and joint ventures including biotechnology and tender processes.

<text>Georgina King Lewis (1847 – 5 December 1924) was a British writer and philanthropist in the Quaker tradition, described as a &quot;Friend of the Oppressed&quot;, for her work in Croydon, South London, England, and in war zones in South Africa and Bulgaria.

== Early life ==
Lewis was born in Kensington, the daughter of John Stoughton and Mary Vyse Stoughton. Her father was a Congregationalist minister. Her older brother Thomas Wilberforce Stoughton was the co-founder of Hodder &amp; Stoughton, the publishing house.

== Philanthropy ==
Lewis donated £1,200 to the first Ruskin House, and was active in the Temperance movement. Lewis was appointed a member of the Women&#x27;s Central Committee on Temperance in 1899. From 1899 to 1901 she worked in a hospital in South Africa during the Boer War; in 1903 she went to Macedonia as a relief worker. In 1906 she had an audience with Pope Pius X to discuss the humanitarian crisis in the Congo Free State. She was an officer of the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society.

== Publications ==
Lewis published a biography of her father in 1898. She also wrote &quot;Critical Times in Turkey&quot;, and pamphlet biographies of George Fox, Elizabeth Fry and John Greenleaf Whittier, as well as a memoir published posthumously.

* &quot;John Stoughton, D.D.: A Short Record of a Long Life&quot; (1898)
* &quot;How Best to Keep up the Interest of our Young People in our Society&quot; (1899)
* &quot;George Fox&quot; (1903)
* &quot;Elizabeth Fry&quot; (1903)
* &quot;John Greenleaf Whittier&quot;
* &quot;Critical Times in Turkey and England&#x27;s Responsibility&quot; (1905)
* &quot;The Inner Light&quot; (1921)

== Personal life ==
Stoughton was the second wife of publisher Henry King Lewis. Her husband died in 1898, and she died in 1924, at the age of 77. Her funeral was attended by councillors and clergy, and representatives of Ruskin House. To quote her obituary in the &quot;Croydon Advertiser&quot;, December 13, 1924, Mrs. King Lewis left behind &quot;the practical results and inspiring memory of a wonderful life of discriminating service for others.&quot;

<text>Charles de Téligny ( 153524 August 1572) was a French soldier and diplomat.

==Biography==
De Téligny belonged to a respected Huguenot family of Rouerque, and received an excellent training in letters and arms at the house of Gaspard de Coligny.

He was employed on several peace missions; he represented the Protestants before the king, and was entrusted by Condé with the presentation of his terms to the queen-mother Catherine in 1567, and in the following year he assisted at the conference at Châlons and signed the Peace of Longjumeau, which was destined to be of short duration.

On the outbreak of war, he took part in the siege of Poitiers, directed an unsuccessful attack on Nantes, fought bravely under Coligny at Moncontour, and participated in the negotiations ending in the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (8 August 1570).

In 1571 he retired to La Rochelle and married Louise de Coligny, but was speedily recalled to Paris to serve on the bi-partisan commission of adjustment. Although he won the special favour of Charles IX, he became one of the first victims in the massacre of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Day. He was murdered in the halls of the Louvre after refusing to recant his Protestant beliefs. His remains were taken to the Castle of Téligny in 1617, but eight years later were thrown into the river by the Bishop of Castres.

<doc id="1216076" wikidata="Q2499441" url="?curid=1216076" title="On the Threshold of a Dream">
<text>On the Threshold of a Dream is the fourth album by the Moody Blues, released in April 1969 on the Deram label. The album reached the top of the album charts, the group&#x27;s first No. 1 album in the UK. According to guitarist Justin Hayward, &quot;I think &quot;Threshold&quot; is the defining album for the Moody Blues. And it&#x27;s the one in the &#x27;60&#x27;s that you would find in people&#x27;s homes when you went, they would have that album.&quot; 

==Background==
The album was recorded in January 1969 after concluding the group&#x27;s first tour of North America. Released in April 1969, nine months after its predecessor, &quot;In Search of the Lost Chord&quot; and seven months before its successor, &quot;To Our Children&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Children&quot;, the album marked a busy time of rapid creative output from the band. Guitarist Justin Hayward remembers, &quot;We were on a fast train in the &#x27;60s with our heads down, plowing away at this stuff, never really doing that much on the road. Just going back in the studio and moving forward.&quot;

==Writing==
Like its predecessors, &quot;On the Threshold of a Dream&quot; is a concept album, but carries a looser theme than &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; and &quot;In Search of the Lost Chord&quot;. The album&#x27;s title reflects the hopes of the flower power zeitgeist and Woodstock free-love era, and the hope that society was on the cusp of a new era of consciousness, a new enlightenment. The title was coined by Mike Pinder in conversation with his friend and BBC presenter David Symonds. Pinder remembers, &quot;About halfway through making the album, when we were kicking some titles around, I remember talking about how here we are, we&#x27;d just come through &#x27;67 in kaftans; everybody was out in the street and it was a fun time, and flower power and all that kind of thing. So, we were thinking, &#x27;Hey, we&#x27;re on the brink of a new consciousness, a new way of looking at things.&#x27; And so we were talking about that, and it was like we were &#x27;on the verge of a human dream, a dream of humanity&#x27;, and Dave said &#x27;threshold&#x27;, and I came up with &#x27;of a dream&#x27;, and it was like perfect.&quot; Guitarist Justin Hayward continues, &quot;We probably were [taking ourselves too seriously]. But quite rightly. To do what we were doing we had to believe in it. It was from the heart. But at the time we got the reputation for that. I felt I was speaking for a lot of other people in the late &#x27;60s. I wanted to write about our search for enlightenment, as simple as that. I&#x27;m still kind of doing it.&quot;

Bassist John Lodge remembers the band&#x27;s creative process, how each member would bring ideas to the group related to the album&#x27;s theme, and then work on the songs together as they produced the album: &quot;Collectively we all had the same subject. But because we were all different people and we all played different things and would sound differently, every song was different even though the subject was the same.&quot; He continues, &quot;When we came into the studio, we had a coffee table; we used to sit around there and talk about a song. If I had written a song I wanted on the album, I played it to the rest of the guys when we sat around that table, and everyone around that table would put their interpretation into that song. As soon as you played the song to the rest of the guys, it really became a Moody Blues song. You had total faith in the rest of the guys that they were going to be as creative as they can be in making that song work to its highest degree.&quot;

The album begins with a spoken word introduction inspired by René Descartes&#x27;s philosophical argument Cogito, ergo sum, where the narrator questions and then confirms his own existence, and then questions the meaning of his existence. Written by drummer Graeme Edge, keyboardist Mike Pinder remembers the introduction&#x27;s production being a collaborative effort among the group&#x27;s members. &quot;In the Beginning&quot; features three characters, listed as &quot;First Man&quot;, &quot;Establishment&quot; and &quot;Inner Man&quot; in the printed lyrics provided in the album gate-fold sleeve. Hayward takes the role of a slightly bemused lone person who confirms his own existence. Edge, a mocking establishment figure, confirms the first man&#x27;s existence, but insists his purpose is to be a cog in a corporate machine. The first man sheepishly asserts that he thinks his existence is about more than that, finding encouragement from his &quot;Inner Man, spoken by Pinder, who tells him to &quot;keep cool&quot; and &quot;keep thinking free.&quot;

The upbeat &quot;Lovely to See You&quot; opens the album. With its welcoming lyrics, the song later served as a concert opener during the later part of the group&#x27;s career.

The lyrics of &quot;Dear Diary&quot; reflect on a feeling of being unable to relate to the world as it rushes by around you. The song presents a bit of cutting social commentary by closing with a mundane diary entry recounting a day of posting letters and window shopping followed by a subdued recounting that &quot;Somebody exploded an H-bomb today...But it wasn&#x27;t anybody I knew&quot; as the song fades out. Engineer Derek Varnals remembers Thomas adlibbing the final narration during recording. When mixing the album, Varnals was careful to fade out the track at the right moment for maximum effect: &quot;Yeah, we wanted to keep that in because it was witty and quite amusing. All we had to do was to get the timing right on the fade out. We didn&#x27;t want it to be too loud - it had to be part of the fade, and I think we got it right.&quot; 

The upbeat &quot;Send Me No Wine&quot; and &quot;To Share Our Love&quot; are both written by bassist John Lodge. The lyrics of &quot;Send Me No Wine&quot; reflect a country music style. Varnals suggests, &quot;&#x27;Wine&#x27; is really a country and western song. When you play it, imagine it slower, with some of the repetition taken out. Listen to the song and note that the Mellotron parts are very much like a pedal steel guitar as well.&quot; 

Mike Pinder&#x27;s &quot;So Deep Within You&quot; was later recorded by the Four Tops with instrumental backing by members of the Moody Blues.

Side two opens with Hayward&#x27;s &quot;Never Comes the Day&quot;, an ode to unrequited love. He remembers the song being influenced by his struggles to find meaning in his life at the time: &quot;It was quite a difficult time in my life. It was a real painful situation for someone who was as young as me then. I wasn&#x27;t quite sure about my own life and what I was doing and what was weird and where I was living and the people around me, including the people in the group. I was just kind of questioning everything and at the same time trying to live out some of the philosophies of the time. It was a time of strong philosophical roads and routes that people were writing about. It was a kind of age of enlightenment and searching for enlightenment.&quot; The song&#x27;s plaintive mood builds to a crescendo with an exhortation for listeners to share their feelings with each other. He explains, &quot;I felt it needed to build to something that was happier and more optimistic. It just came naturally to me. I like dynamics in songs: light and shade. I liked starting quiet and getting loud.&quot; The song employs an open G tuning, which Hayward remembers learning while touring with Richie Havens: &quot;I learned a lot in those early years about chords, open tunings. &quot;Question,&quot; which is a big open C tuning, and &quot;Never Comes a Day,&quot; an open G. We played a few times with Richie Havens, and he showed me quite a few tunings backstage at gigs on that lovely good old guitar of his.&quot;

Ray Thomas&#x27; &quot;Lazy Day&quot; and Hayward&#x27;s &quot;Are You Sitting Comfortably&quot; introduce a mood of drowsiness, preparing the listener for the album&#x27;s centerpiece, Mike Pinder&#x27;s &quot;Have You Heard&quot; suite. 

&quot;Lazy Day&quot; incorporates a bit of satire, poking fun at those who while away their days in a sense of contentment. With the line &quot;must be lamb today because beef was last week&quot; the re-release liner notes describe the lyrics as &quot;an acerbic comment on the average Sunday for the British working man&quot;. The contentment of the verses is contrasted with ethereal yet cynical backing vocals: &quot;It&#x27;s such a crying shame / Week after week the same / That&#x27;s how your life goes by / Until the day you die&quot;

According to Hayward, &quot;Are You Sitting Comfortably&quot; is &quot;about storytelling, but elevated to a bit of a psychedelic story&quot;. Its lyrics recall the days of medieval minstrels, featuring finger-picked guitar and lyrics full of vibrant imagery including &quot;a fleet of golden galleons on a crystal sea&quot; and the &quot;glorious days of Camelot&quot; while Merlin casts a spell of slumber. The song takes its first line from a popular children&#x27;s show, &quot;Listen with Mother&quot;, that always began with the same line and became associated with the phrase. &quot;Are You Sitting Comfortably&quot; was written towards the end of the sessions, and apart from &quot;The Dream&quot;, was the last track recorded for the album. Hayward remembers, &quot;I already had the guitar riff and the chord sequence, and I had the first line and the title. And then we just took it from there. Ray contributed a lot of lyrics. I know the first thing he did was that second line, &quot;A fleet of golden galleons, on a crystal sea,&quot; which is a very Ray Thomas phrase.&quot;

Mike Pinder&#x27;s recitation of Graeme Edge&#x27;s poem &quot;The Dream&quot; introduces the album&#x27;s dream sequence. Its words suggest that just as new life springs from death in nature, a spirit of love and selflessness can help society realize its dream and achieve enlightenment. Edge explains, &quot;My job back then was to write a poem that kind of hinted at all of the various themes to make sure that people&#x27;s heads were pointed in the right direction.&quot;

&quot;Have You Heard&quot; dates from at least 1966, when an early version appeared in the band&#x27;s live set. Its lyrics repeat the album&#x27;s theme of enlightenment. The song bookends &quot;The Voyage&quot;, an instrumental piece that builds with Mellotron-produced orchestral strings and reaches a crescendo with a repeated melody on piano before cellos lead a transition back to a reprise of &quot;Have You Heard&quot;. Varnals remembers the introductory section of &quot;The Voyage&quot; being influenced by &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot;, having been used in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, which was released several months before the album&#x27;s sessions. The track took three days to record, with Mike Pinder largely working alone on Mellotron, with overdubbed cellos, piano and other instruments played by the group.

At the end of the &quot;Have You Heard&quot; reprise, the album concludes with the droning electronic sound that opens the album. Produced by Mellotron, the sound plays continuously into the album&#x27;s run-out groove, causing it to play continuously until the record player&#x27;s tonearm is lifted.

==Recording==
The album was recorded from 12 to 31 January 1969, once again at Decca&#x27;s Studio One at their West Hampstead studio with producer Tony Clarke and engineer Derek Varnals, employing the studio&#x27;s newly installed Sculley 8 track recording equipment. Final mixing on the album was completed on 3 and 4 February. The sessions typically ran from the afternoon until well into the night, with the creative team sequestering themselves inside of the studio. Producer Tony Clarke remembers, &quot;We brought in carpets and lamps and ashtrays and recorded in the dark. It had to be comfortable and cozy. The sessions tended to go from midday until midnight.&quot;

Justin Hayward remembers, &quot;It was certainly a time for me when I was sort of searching and seeking different religions, psychedelic experiences; it was a real time of discovery for me as a young man. So, I was getting stoned a lot and going deeper into music and things. I certainly saw it as a real chance at musical freedom on this record...a way to express the sort of searching, seeking things that we were doing in our lives.&quot; 

Drummer Graeme Edge remembers the creative environment: &quot;The album was our one where we actually concentrated on recording and weren&#x27;t rushing off to do gigs here and there. As we&#x27;d just come off tour the music we created combined the knowledge of studio techniques that we had acquired recording &quot;In Search of the Lost Chord&quot; together with the craft we had learnt through performing on stage every night. That may explain the presence of &quot;On The Threshold Of A Dream&quot; of more instrumental parts.&quot; 

The opening &quot;In the Beginning&quot; in particular offered much opportunity for the group plus Clarke and Varnals to express their studio creativity. The album begins and ends with &quot;the sound of everything but also of nothing&quot;, created by producing high and low frequencies on the Mellotron combined with &quot;pink noise&quot;: Varnals explains, &quot;We chose the pitch and put lots of reverb on it to make it sound everywhere and nowhere, if you like. It worked and seemed quite atmospheric.&quot; To back up Graeme Edge&#x27;s maniacal establishment-computer voice during the spoken section, the group placed everyone&#x27;s ticking wristwatches and placed them inside a funnel with a microphone. The sound was combined with the sound of the clanking rotating spindle that made up the internal mechanics of a Mellotron. The overall effect intended to mimic machinery and the vibes a mad professor bent on domination. 

John Lodge reflects on how the group&#x27;s creative process evolved on the album: &quot;I think with &quot;On The Threshold Of A Dream&quot; and &quot;To Our Children&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Children&quot;, we started to become a studio band. We were exploring what you could do recording-wise, and not playing live-wise. So, we would experiment in all other places to try to make different sounds which we recorded completely differently. It was an interesting time because we pulled the elastic on our musical travels as far as we could go, I think.&quot; Clarke adds, &quot;This album set the standard for how we recorded future concept albums. It&#x27;s quite important in so many ways. It was the first time we had true freedom in the studio. This was our first chance at being left alone - no men in white coats or people with clipboards. It&#x27;s still quite lovely. I&#x27;m proud of a great deal of it. All in all, I&#x27;m glad we did it.&quot; 

==Album cover==
The album cover, like its predecessor, is designed by Phil Travers. For the first time, the album incorporates a gate-fold sleeve allowing a larger canvas for album artwork. The band would repeat this practice on their next several albums. Flautist Ray Thomas remembers negotiating with their record label, Decca, over the additional cost: &quot;They were concerned that it would increase the cost of the sleeve by 2 pence an album. We were originally told by the head of production that if the album was as good as we said it was, it could be housed in a brown paper bag! Eventually, after a great deal of protest we managed to get our way.&quot; The additional space allowed for inclusion, for the first time, the album&#x27;s lyrics, as well as an essay by composer Lionel Bart.

The imagery on the cover features &quot;a metallic, robot-type entity clutching different, various life forms and squeezing tight representing freedom of thought and expression and creativity&quot;, explains Mike Pinder, as well as an image of Merlin casting a spell, Camelot, and a fleet of golden galleons on a crystal sea, images inspired by the lyrics to &quot;Are You Sitting Comfortably&quot;. Bassist John Lodge recalls, &quot;We would get our graphic artist, Phil Travers, in to the studio to listen to each track as it was completed. We also gave him the lyrics in order for him to get further ideas. Phil would then sketch out various rough sleeve designs and we would all sit around a coffee table and discuss what we wanted. We all felt that both the music and the album sleeve design had to be part of one special package and had to be right&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;On the Threshold of a Dream&quot; was released on 25 April 1969 in the UK and 30 May 1969 in the US. &quot;On the Threshold of a Dream&quot; provided the Moody Blues with their first British number-one album, and also boosted their American fortunes by becoming their first top-20 album there. It proved to be one of the group&#x27;s more enduring records in the US, staying in the &quot;Billboard&quot; LPs chart for more than two and a half years.

The album, along with the subsequent &quot;To Our Children&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Children&quot;, was among the tapes carried by Apollo 15 astronaut Al Worden to the moon.

In March 2006 the album was completely remastered into SACD format and repackaged with nine extra tracks. In 2008 a remaster for standard audio CD was issued with the same bonus tracks.

<doc id="1216077" wikidata="Q899027" url="?curid=1216077" title="Electrophilic addition">
<text>In organic chemistry, an electrophilic addition (AE) reaction is an addition reaction where a chemical compound containing a double or triple bond has a π bond broken, with the formation of two new σ bonds.

The driving force for this reaction is the formation of an electrophile X+ that forms a covalent bond with an electron-rich, unsaturated C=C bond. The positive charge on X is transferred to the carbon-carbon bond, forming a carbocation during the formation of the C-X bond.
In the second step of an electrophilic addition, the positively charge on the intermediate combines with an electron-rich species to form the second covalent bond. The second step is the same nucleophilic attack process found in an SN1 reaction. The exact nature of the electrophile and the nature of the positively charged intermediate are not always clear and depend on reactants and reaction conditions.

In all asymmetric addition reactions to carbon, regioselectivity is important and often determined by Markovnikov&#x27;s rule. Organoborane compounds give anti-Markovnikov additions. Electrophilic attack to an aromatic system results in electrophilic aromatic substitution rather than an addition reaction.

== Typical electrophilic additions ==
Typical electrophilic additions to alkenes with reagents are:
* Halogen addition reactions: X2
* Hydrohalogenations: HX
* Hydration reactions: H2O
* Hydrogenations: H2
* Oxymercuration reactions: mercuric acetate, water
* Hydroboration-oxidation reactions: diborane
* the Prins reaction: formaldehyde, water

<text>Huggins is a lunar impact crater that lies in the rugged southern highlands of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It was named after British astronomer Sir William Huggins in 1935.

This crater lies across the eastern rim of the larger crater Orontius. The eastern rim of Huggins is laid across in turn by the slightly smaller crater Nasireddin. Thus these three craters form a triplet of decreasing age from west to east. To the northwest of Huggins is Miller, which is attached to the northern rim of Nasireddin.

This crater has been somewhat eroded, but the surviving rim remains relatively well-defined and is only overlaid by a few tiny craterlets. The western half of the interior floor is relatively level, although a small crater, Huggins A, is attached to the inner wall of the northwest rim. There is a central peak formation next to the outer of the intruding Nasireddin.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Huggins. Huggins A lies within the Huggins crater.

<doc id="1216087" wikidata="Q1587812" url="?curid=1216087" title="Centered decagonal number">
<text>A centered decagonal number is a centered figurate number that represents a decagon with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center dot in successive decagonal layers. The centered decagonal number for &quot;n&quot; is given by the formula

:formula_1

Thus, the first few centered decagonal numbers are

:1, 11, 31, 61, 101, 151, 211, 281, 361, 451, 551, 661, 781, 911, 1051, ... 

Like any other centered &quot;k&quot;-gonal number, the &quot;n&quot;th centered decagonal number can be reckoned by multiplying the (&quot;n&quot; − 1)th triangular number by &quot;k&quot;, 10 in this case, then adding 1. As a consequence of performing the calculation in base 10, the centered decagonal numbers can be obtained by simply adding a 1 to the right of each triangular number. Therefore, all centered decagonal numbers are odd and in base 10 always end in 1.

Another consequence of this relation to triangular numbers is the simple recurrence relation for centered decagonal numbers:
:formula_2
where
:formula_3

==Relation to other sequences==
* N is a Centered decagonal number iff 20N + 5 is a Square number.

==Generating Function==
The generating function of the centered decagonal number is formula_4 

==Continued fraction forms==
formula_5 has the simple continued fraction [5n-3;{2,2n-2,2,10n-6}].

<doc id="1216091" wikidata="Q7016442" url="?curid=1216091" title="New localism">
<text>New [[Localism (politics)|localism]] is a concept associated with Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour government in the United Kingdom. It was intended to indicate a cautious devolution of power to the local level in an attempt to better implement national goals.

==Labour&#x27;s first term approach==
New localism arose from the experience of Labour&#x27;s first term of office (1997–2001), during which the government&#x27;s policy approach was characterised as being highly centralised and only partly effective. The most emblematic of its policies were the centrally-driven literacy and numeracy hours in schools.

Labour also introduced new and more complex forms of performance management in an attempt to drive up the standard of local public services through inspection and target setting.

In Whitehall, this was achieved through public service agreements between departments and the Treasury, setting out what was expected of a particular department in return for its funding.

In the wider public sector, local government was required to undertake a heavy service review and inspection programme known as Best Value, while the NHS got a new Commission for Healthcare Inspection and a system of &#x27;star rating&#x27; based league tables.

However, these policies were rapidly seen to be too bureaucratic. Indeed, they could sometimes have perverse consequences as public service organisations changed their priorities to meet centrally set targets. One example of this is arguably the way the government&#x27;s focus on education and social services drove councils to focus their spending and effort in these areas.

While positive in itself, the result was that local environmental services were relatively less well resourced, despite the fact that they are key determinants of public satisfaction with local government. The result was that councils were seen to be improving rapidly by Whitehall, but not by the public, whose satisfaction with local government declined.

New localism emerged from an increasing understanding of the limitations of centrally-driven policy implementation. It involved an acceptance that local problems could not be solved by standardised approaches imposed from above, and that local agencies needed space to adapt and innovate within the policy framework.

==New localism and &#x27;old localism&#x27;==

New localism is therefore characterised by a cautious devolution of power to the local level in an attempt to better implement national goals. It emphasises the devolution of managerial over political power - the aim is generally to allow local managers to meet national priorities more effectively, rather than to allow local politicians to derogate from national goals.

New localism differs from the implicit &#x27;old localism&#x27; in two important senses. First, it accepts the role of central government in driving change at the local level, something that the localists of the 1980s strongly resisted. Second, it does not centre on the role of the local authority, but takes a wider view of the locality that includes communities and other public service organisations such as health and police services.

==New localism in practice==
New localism has been most strongly advocated by the New Local Government Network think tank. Advocates in the Labour government have included Alan Milburn, the former health secretary, and Hazel Blears.

Nick Raynsford, the local government minister from 2001 to 2005, used his tenure to launch a process called Local:Vision, which aimed at creating a 10-year strategy for local government policy and took a distinctively new localist perspective. His successor, David Miliband developed this approach further, suggesting the continuing development of a new localist agenda in Labour&#x27;s third term (which began in 2005).

Key new localist policies include:

Foundation hospitals - the granting of more autonomy to NHS hospital trusts that score the highest marks in their inspections, including freedom to borrow money on the markets and adjust staff pay levels. The foundation trusts must create an elected board including representatives from the local community to oversee their work.

Freedoms for local government - Labour granted a number of new freedoms to councils, including the right to freely borrow capital on the financial markets and a general reduction in the number of plans that must be submitted for central government approval. Further freedoms were promised to those councils that scored the top &#x27;excellent&#x27; grade in the key Comprehensive Performance Assessment inspection process. These include freedom from council tax capping and a three-year holiday from inspection. The local government community has complained that these freedoms are not always granted in practice.

Neighbourhoods - Labour showed a growing interest in creating new forms of more direct neighbourhood governance in the hope of improving the responsiveness of public services and engaging local people in both local democracy and the delivery of their own services through service level contracts and co-production.

Education reform - it might also be argued that the government&#x27;s policy of transferring power to school headteachers from local education authorities represented a new localist approach to devolving beyond the council to local communities.

<doc id="1216092" wikidata="Q1940343" url="?curid=1216092" title="The Beatles' Long Tall Sally">
<text>The Beatles&#x27; Long Tall Sally is an album by the English rock band the Beatles, their final album to be released exclusively in Canada. It was a mono release on the Capitol Records label (catalogue number T 6063) in May 1964.

After the release of this album, Beatles&#x27; records in Canada would match the group&#x27;s United States releases, starting with the United Artists version of the &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; album, and, on Capitol, &quot;Something New&quot;. This was done under orders from Capitol president Alan W. Livingston. Earlier American Beatle album releases were also issued in Canada.

This album borrows its name—and two tracks—from the Beatles&#x27; British EP &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;. Four of the tracks had already been released on the Canadian album &quot;Beatlemania! With the Beatles&quot;.

The cover design is almost identical to the US release &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot;.

The album was deleted in 1967 but was reissued in 1971 along with the two other unique Canadian Beatles albums in Capitol&#x27;s &quot;6000 Series&quot;. The album was issued in stereo for the first time in 1976, though nearly all the &quot;stereo&quot; tracks are in the &quot;reprocessed for stereo&quot; format. This process involves creating a &quot;dual mono/simulated stereo&quot; sound by emphasizing the higher frequencies on the right channel and lower frequency on the left.

<doc id="1216093" wikidata="Q581117" url="?curid=1216093" title="The Cocoanuts">
<text>The Cocoanuts is a 1929 pre-Code musical comedy film starring the Marx Brothers (Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo). Produced for Paramount Pictures by Walter Wanger, who is not credited, the film also stars Mary Eaton, Oscar Shaw, Margaret Dumont and Kay Francis. The first sound film to credit more than one director (Robert Florey and Joseph Santley), it was adapted to the screen by Morrie Ryskind from the George S. Kaufman Broadway musical play. Five of the film&#x27;s tunes were composed by Irving Berlin, including &quot;When My Dreams Come True&quot;, sung by Oscar Shaw and Mary Eaton.

On January 1, 2025, &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; entered the public domain.

==Plot==
&quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; is set in the Hotel de Cocoanut, a resort hotel, during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. Mr. Hammer runs the hotel, assisted by Jamison. Harpo and Chico arrive with empty luggage, which they apparently plan to fill by robbing and conning the guests. Wealthy Mrs. Potter is one of the few paying customers. Her daughter Polly is in love with struggling young architect Bob Adams. He works to support himself as a clerk at the hotel, but has grand plans for the development of the entire area as Cocoanut Manor. Mrs. Potter wants her daughter to marry Harvey Yates, whom she believes to be of higher social standing than Adams. Yates is actually a confidence man out to steal the dowager&#x27;s expensive diamond necklace with the help of his partner in crime, Penelope.

==Analysis==

The somewhat thin plot primarily provides a framework for the running gags of the Marx Brothers to take prominence. The film is, however, notable for its musical production numbers, including cinematic techniques which were soon to become standard, such as overhead shots of dancing girls imitating the patterns of a kaleidoscope. The musical numbers were not pre-recorded, but were shot live on the soundstage with an off-camera orchestra. The main titles are superimposed over a negative image of the &quot;Monkey-Doodle-Do&quot; number photographed from an angle that does not appear in the body of the film.

One of the more famous gag routines in the film involves Chico not knowing what a &quot;viaduct&quot; is, which Groucho keeps mentioning, prompting Chico to ask, &quot;why-a-duck&quot;.

In another sequence, while he is acting as auctioneer for some land of possibly questionable value (&quot;You can have any kind of a home you want to; you can even get stucco! Oh, how you can get stuck-oh!&quot;), Groucho has hired Chico to act as a shill to inflate the sale prices by making bogus bids. To Groucho&#x27;s frustration, Chico keeps outbidding everyone, even himself. During the auction, Mrs. Potter announces that her necklace has been stolen and offers a reward of one thousand dollars, whereupon Chico offers two thousand. Unbeknownst to anyone except the thieves and to Harpo (who intercepted the map drawn by the villains while hiding under their hotel room bed) the jewellery&#x27;s hiding place is a hollow tree stump adjacent to where the land auction takes place.

Thereupon, Detective Hennessy who entered the plot earlier, decides that the guilty party is Polly&#x27;s suitor. He is aided by the real villains, who attempt to frame Bob Adams for the crime. However, Harpo, by producing the necklace, and later the note, is able to prove that Bob Adams is innocent of the charges laid against him.

At various points, Harpo and Chico both provide musical solos – Harpo on the harp, and Chico at the piano.

Still another sequence has Groucho, Mrs. Potter and Harvey Yates (the necklace thief) make formal speeches. Harpo repeatedly walks off, with a grimace on his face, to the punch bowl. (His staggering implies that the punch has been spiked with alcohol.) Another highlight is when the cast, already dressed in traditional Spanish garb for a theme party, erupts into an operatic treatment about Hennessy&#x27;s lost shirt to music from Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; (specifically, Habanera and the Toreador Song). An earlier scene shows Harpo and Chico abusing a cash register while whistling the Anvil Chorus from &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, a piece also referenced in several other Marx Brothers films.

Immediately following the revelation that an injustice has been done to Polly&#x27;s original suitor, Bob Adams, Mr. Adams himself comes in saying there&#x27;s a man outside asking for Mr. Hammer: it is tycoon John W. Berryman, who is about to buy Bob&#x27;s architectural designs for Cocoanut Manor, and asking if the hotel can accommodate 400 guests for the weekend. The Marxes immediately beat a hasty retreat, and Mrs. Potter declares the wedding will take place &quot;exactly as planned, with the exception of a slight change,&quot; announcing that Mr. Robert Adams will be the bridegroom.

== Production ==
Principal photography began on Monday, 4 February 1929, at Paramount’s Astoria studio. The Marx Brothers shot their contributions during the day. At night, they traveled to the 44th Street Theatre, where they were concurrently performing the 1928 Broadway musical &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;.

Referring to directors Robert Florey and Joseph Santley, Groucho Marx remarked, &quot;One of them didn&#x27;t understand English and the other didn&#x27;t understand Harpo.&quot;

As was common in the early days of sound film, to eliminate the sound of the camera motors, the cameras and the cameramen were enclosed in large soundproof booths with glass fronts to allow filming. This resulted in largely static camera work. For many years, Marxian legend had it that Florey, who had never seen the Marxes&#x27; work before, was put in the soundproof booth because he could not contain his laughter at the brothers&#x27; spontaneous antics.

Every piece of paper in the movie is soaking wet, in order to keep crackling paper sounds from overloading the primitive recording equipment of the time. Director Florey struggled with the noises until the 27th take of the &quot;Viaduct&quot; scene. He finally got the idea to soak the paper in water; the 28th take of the &quot;Viaduct&quot; scene used soaked paper, and this take was quiet and used in the film.

The &quot;ink&quot; that Harpo drank from the hotel lobby inkwell was actually Coca-Cola, and the &quot;telephone mouthpiece&quot; that he nibbled was made of chocolate, both inventions of Robert Florey.

Paramount brought conductor Frank Tours (1877–1963) over from London to be the film&#x27;s musical director, as he had also been the conductor for the show&#x27;s original Broadway production in 1925. At the time, Tours had been conducting at the Plaza Theatre in Piccadilly Circus (Paramount&#x27;s premier exhibition venue in the UK). Filming took place at the Paramount studios in Astoria, Queens; their second film, &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;, was also shot there. After that, production of all Marx films moved to Hollywood.

== Songs ==
*&quot;Florida by the Sea&quot; (instrumental with brief vocal by chorus during opening montage)
*&quot;When My Dreams Come True&quot; (theme song, Mary Eaton and Oscar Shaw variously, several reprises)
*&quot;The Bell-Hops&quot; (instrumental, dance number)
*&quot;Monkey Doodle Doo&quot; (vocal by Mary Eaton and dance number)
*&quot;Ballet Music&quot; (instrumental, dance number)
*&quot;Tale of the Shirt&quot; (vocal by Basil Ruysdael, words set to music from &quot;Carmen&quot; by Georges Bizet)
*&quot;Tango Melody&quot; (vocal included in the stage production, used in the film as background music only)
*&quot;Gypsy Love Song&quot; (by Victor Herbert, piano solo by Chico Marx)

Several songs from the stage play were omitted from the film: &quot;Lucky Boy&quot;, sung by the chorus to congratulate Bob on his engagement to Polly and &quot;A Little Bungalow&quot;, a love duet sung by Bob and Polly that was replaced with &quot;When My Dreams Come True&quot; in the film.

Irving Berlin wrote two songs entitled &quot;Monkey Doodle Doo&quot;. The first was published in 1913, the second introduced in the 1925 stage production and featured in the film. They are very different songs.

Although legend claims Berlin wrote the song &quot;Always&quot; for &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot;, he never meant for the song to be included, writing it, instead, as a gift for his fiancée.

==Reception==
When the Marx Brothers were shown the final cut of the film, they were so horrified they tried to buy the negative back and prevent its release. Paramount wisely resisted — the movie turned out to be a big box office hit, with a $1,800,000 gross making it one of the most successful early talking films.

It received mostly positive reviews from critics, with the Marx Brothers themselves earning most of the praise while other aspects of the film drew a more mixed reaction. Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the film &quot;aroused considerable merriment&quot; among the viewing audience, and that a sequence using an overhead shot was &quot;so engaging that it elicited plaudits from many in the jammed theatre.&quot; However, he found the audio quality during some of the singing to be &quot;none too good&quot;, adding, &quot;a deep-voiced bass&#x27;s tones almost fade into a whisper in a close-up. Mary Eaton is charming, but one obtains little impression of her real ability as a singer.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a comedy hit for the regular picture houses. That&#x27;s all it has – comedy – but that&#x27;s enough.&quot; It reported the sound had &quot;a bit of muffling now and then&quot; and that the dancers weren&#x27;t always filmed well: &quot;When the full 48 were at work only 40 could be seen and those behind the first line could be seen but dimly.&quot;

&quot;It is as a funny picture and not as a musical comedy, not for its songs, pretty girls, or spectacular scenes, that &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; succeeds&quot;, wrote John Mosher in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. &quot;Neither Mary Eaton, nor Oscar Shaw, who contribute the &quot;love interest&quot;, is effective, nor are the chorus scenes in the least superior to others of the same sort in various musical-comedy-movies now running in town. To the Marxes belongs the success of the show, and their peculiar talents seem, surprisingly enough, even more manifest on the screen than on the stage.&quot;

&quot;Film Daily&quot; called it &quot;a good amount of fun, although some of it proves tiresome. This is another case of a musical comedy transferred almost bodily to the screen and motion picture treatment forgotten. The result is a good many inconsistencies which perhaps may be overlooked provided the audience accepts the offering for what it is.&quot;

<text>The God gene hypothesis proposes that human spirituality is influenced by heredity and that a specific gene, called vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), predisposes humans towards spiritual or mystic experiences. The idea has been proposed by geneticist Dean Hamer in the 2004 book called &quot;The God Gene: How Faith is Hardwired into our Genes&quot;.

The God gene hypothesis is based on a combination of behavioral genetic, neurobiological and psychological studies. The major arguments of the hypothesis are: (1) spirituality can be quantified by psychometric measurements; (2) the underlying tendency to spirituality is partially heritable; (3) part of this heritability can be attributed to the gene VMAT2; (4) this gene acts by altering monoamine levels; and (5) spirituality provides an evolutionary advantage by providing individuals with an innate sense of optimism.

==Proposal==

According to the God Gene hypothesis, spirituality has a genetic component, of which (VMAT2) comprises one component by contributing to sensations associated with mystic experiences, including the presence of God and feelings of connection to a larger universe.

The research uses the self-transcendence scale developed by psychologist Robert Cloninger to quantify spirituality using three sub-scales: &quot;self-forgetfulness&quot; (as in the tendency to become totally absorbed in some activity, such as reading); &quot;transpersonal identification&quot; (a feeling of connectedness to a larger universe); and &quot;mysticism&quot; (an openness to believe things that remain unproven, such as ESP). Cloninger suggests that taken together, these measurements are a reasonable way to quantify (make measurable) an individual&#x27;s propensity to be spiritual.

The self-transcendence measure was shown to be heritable by classical twin studies conducted by Lindon Eaves and Nicholas Martin. Their work demonstrated that approximately 40% of the variation in self-transcendence was due to genes. By contrast, specific religious beliefs (such as belief in a particular deity) were found to have no genetic basis and are instead cultural units or memes. Similar conclusions were drawn from studies of identical twins reared apart.

In order to identify some of the specific genes involved in self-transcendence, Hamer analyzed DNA and personality score data from over 1,000 individuals and identified one particular locus, VMAT2, with a significant correlation. VMAT2 codes for a vesicular monoamine transporter that plays a key role in regulating the levels of the brain chemicals serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. These monoamine transmitters are in turn postulated to play an important role in regulating the brain activities associated with mystic beliefs.

Hamer hypothesized that self-transcendence might provide an evolutionary advantage by providing human beings with an innate sense of optimism that gives people the will to keep on living and procreating, despite the inevitability of death, and promoting better health and recovery from diseases.

==Scientific response==
In the brain, VMAT2 proteins are located on synaptic vesicles. VMAT2 transports monoamine neurotransmitters from the cytosol of monoamine neurons into vesicles. Developmental biologist and science blogger PZ Myers argues: &quot;It&#x27;s a pump. A teeny-tiny pump responsible for packaging a neurotransmitter for export during brain activity. Yes, it&#x27;s important, and it may even be active and necessary during higher order processing, like religious thought. But one thing it isn&#x27;t is a &#x27;god gene.&#x27;&quot;

Popular science writer Carl Zimmer said that VMAT2 can be characterized as a gene that accounts for less than one percent of the variance of self-transcendence scores. These, Zimmer says, can signify anything from belonging to the Green Party to believing in ESP. Zimmer also points out that the God Gene theory is based on only one unpublished, unreplicated study. 

However, Hamer notes that the importance of the VMAT2 finding is not that it explains all spiritual or religious feelings, but rather that it points the way toward one neurobiological pathway that may be important. Currently, there are several VMAT2 inhibitors marketed as drugs including deutetrabenazine, tetrabenazine, and valbenazine. The question of the God Gene could be answered by experimental studies.

==Religious response==
John Polkinghorne, a theoretical physicist and Anglican priest, member of the Royal Society and Canon Theologian at Liverpool Cathedral, was asked for a comment on Hamer&#x27;s theory by the British national daily newspaper, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. He replied: &quot;The idea of a God gene goes against all my personal theological convictions. You can&#x27;t cut faith down to the lowest common denominator of genetic survival. It shows the poverty of reductionist thinking.&quot;

Walter Houston, the chaplain of Mansfield College, Oxford, and a fellow in theology, told the &quot;Telegraph&quot;: &quot;Religious belief is not just related to a person&#x27;s constitution; it&#x27;s related to society, tradition, character—everything&#x27;s involved. Having a gene that could do all that seems pretty unlikely to me.&quot;

Hamer responded that the existence of such a gene would not be incompatible with the existence of a personal God: &quot;Religious believers can point to the existence of God genes as one more sign of the creator&#x27;s ingenuity—a clever way to help humans acknowledge and embrace a divine presence.&quot; He repeatedly notes in his book that, &quot;This book is about whether God genes exist, not about whether there is a God.&quot;

<text>Edward Shortt, KC (10 March 1862 – 10 November 1935) was a British lawyer and Liberal Party politician. He served as a member of David Lloyd George&#x27;s cabinet, most significantly as Home Secretary from 1919 to 1922.

==Background and education==
Shortt was born in Newcastle upon Tyne and was the son of the Church of England vicar Rev. Edward Shortt of Woodhorn, Northumberland. Though born and bred in England, Shortt came from a family with roots in County Tyrone. Shortt was educated at Durham School, where he was a King&#x27;s scholar and competed for the school boat club. He continued his education at the neighbouring Durham University, where he was Lindsay scholar at University College and for two years competed for Durham University Boat Club. He did not excel academically, taking a gentleman&#x27;s degree in Classics in 1884.

Shortt had three brothers. One, Dr William Rushton Shortt, was a surgeon who acted as a Civil Surgeon to the Natal Field Force during the Second Boer War and was present at the Relief of Ladysmith. However, his health having declined in South Africa, he was forced to retire early, and died in November 1913. An older brother, the Rev. Joseph Rushton Shortt (1860–1919), having previously attended Exeter College, Oxford, joined the Durham University staff as a lecturer in Classics and was Bursar of Hatfield College from 1889 to 1898.

==Legal career==
He was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1890 and practised on the North Eastern Circuit. He soon acquired a large junior practice in both civil and criminal cases, with his &#x27;breezy personality&#x27; making him an effective advocate in front of juries. His business being mostly in the North East, he was little known in London at this time. He was appointed as Recorder (part-time judge) of Sunderland in 1907 and took silk in 1910.

==Political career==
Shortt became active in politics for the Liberal Party. In 1908, Shortt was an unsuccessful candidate for Newcastle upon Tyne in a by-election, losing a seat previously held by the party when the Social Democratic Federation put up a candidate against him. However, in the January 1910 election he was elected, and remained an MP until 1922, transferring in 1918 to the new Newcastle upon Tyne West constituency. Within the Liberal Party, Shortt allied with David Lloyd George in the party split which occurred between him and H. H. Asquith. When Lloyd George came to power in 1916, Shortt was soon appointed to the government.

===Chief Secretary of Ireland===
Shortt took an active interest in Irish affairs and became known for his frequent interventions during the debates over the Third Home Rule Bill. His appointment to chair a Select committee to review the operation of the Military Service Acts proved to be the turning-point in his political career. The public hearings of this committee, with witness after witness coming forward to tell stories of medical and administrative chaos, caused a major political storm and sounded the end of the old system. In August 1917 the committee produced a report whose main recommendation was the transfer of medical examinations of recruits from the War Office to a civilian authority. This apparently impressed Lloyd George, and would lead to the advancement of Shortt&#x27;s career after several years of relative obscurity in public life. In May 1918, Lloyd George appointed him as Chief Secretary for Ireland, at a pivotal stage in the First World War and when Irish Republicanism was on the increase. Taking to this new role with great energy and, suspicious of any alleged German intrigue to encourage sedition, he had 150 members of Sinn Féin arrested as a precaution.

The government had also decided to introduce conscription in Ireland to provide more soldiers for the Western Front, linked to support for Irish home rule, but still found that opposition to the British increased. Shortt gave his support to an unusual plan to encourage Irish soldiers to join the French army, while persuading the Roman Catholic hierarchy in Ireland to support conscription. However, both parts of the plan collapsed due to infighting within the government and the military establishment. Conscription was never implemented in Ireland.
===Home Secretary===
Once the war was over, Shortt was promoted to Home Secretary in January 1919, during the middle of a police strike.

On the issue of the fate of enemy aliens who had been detained on the outbreak of war, he resisted demands made by Charles Yate in February 1919 that all foreign waiters on strike should be immediately deported, arguing that &#x27;the fact that an alien takes part in a strike in company with British subjects of the same occupation is not alone a sufficient reason for his deportation&#x27;. Shortt oversaw the deportation of the Estonian anarchist Eduard Sõrmus, the so-called &#x27;Red Violinist&#x27;, who was ultimately removed from the country on 15 February 1919.

In a November 1919 meeting with representatives from the Board of Deputies of British Jews Shortt rejected their proposals for an appeal to a judge in chambers prior to the making of a deportation order, arguing that the necessity of tackling political subversives in the aftermath of the Great War depended on the government holding on to what he described as &#x27;abnormal&#x27; powers. He also reprieved Ronald True, who had been condemned to death for murder, after finding the issue of his sanity in doubt. He was unpopular with some people in Parliament because of his regional partiality: tending to appoint barristers from the North East to many top posts.

Shortt was in favour of denying entry to Mormon missionaries, with the Home Office believing such a policy would prove unpopular with the public. Malcolm R. Thorp has suggested that Shortt&#x27;s position as Recorder of Sunderland before he entered parliament may have influenced his feelings, as Sunderland experienced anti-Mormon riots in 1912, which Shortt presumably witnessed. These experiences could have convinced him that a more generous policy towards the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints would have prompted renewed violence.

When Lloyd George&#x27;s coalition government fell in October 1922 in the aftermath of the Carlton Club meeting, he realised his Cabinet career was effectively over and stood down from Parliament.

==Career after Parliament==
He subsequently held a number of official posts, including the chairmanship of the committees on the rating of machinery, trusts, heavy motor traffic, and the investigation into the Agricultural Marketing Act.

In November 1929, Shortt was appointed as second President of the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) succeeding T.P. O&#x27;Connor. This was an odd appointment as Shortt had no real interest and actively disliked sound films, and was also known to be critical of Hollywood.

The Board had been set up by the film industry and had no statutory role (local councils being technically responsible for judging who could see a film) but in practice its rulings were always obeyed. In March 1930 the BBFC rejected &quot;Her Unborn Child&quot; after a viewing by Shortt. This was the first time that the BBFC had been presented with a film that depicted the act of childbirth, and the decision to reject was never reversed. At the time, educational bodies were keen to exploit the emergence of sound films in Europe with serious scientific films. After academic pressure, Shortt would soften his position later that year and the BBFC would become more open to such productions. One beneficiary was the 1927 German film &quot;Nature and Love&quot;.

Shortt, however, generally followed previous policy of a highly restrictive licensing. In the Board&#x27;s report for 1931, he outlined his concern about the increasing number of films dealing with sexual topics, and promised further restrictions. In 1932 he rejected the Tod Browning film &quot;Freaks&quot;, a ban that would not be lifted until 1963. The following year he had to contend with &quot;Island of Lost Souls&quot; by the American director Erle C. Kenton, which had already caused some controversy in the US over its alleged portrayal of cruelty to animals. Consequently, Shortt was concerned enough to view the film himself instead of one of his censors, and he imposed a ban throughout the country. He banned 120 films in five years and in 1932 ordered cuts to 382, a record number; one of which was &quot;Red-Headed Woman&quot;, starring Jean Harlow. He also introduced the &#x27;H&#x27; rating (for horror), which was the origin of the later X rated film.

Shortt was very upfront about the power of cinema to shape public opinion:

:&quot;There is in our hands as citizens an instrument to mould the minds of the young, to mould the mind of the adolescent, and to create great and good and noble citizens for our future. There is the instrument right to our hands. If we control it, if we work public opinion up to the pitch of controlling it properly, there is a great future for our old country, and I cannot understand why with our united cooperation, we should not finally attain to that perfect ideal&quot;.

In the last year of his life he founded the security firm &quot;Nightwatch Services&quot;, which would later develop into Securicor. His company was one of the first specialist security firms to be established in the modern era, and provided guarding services.

==Assessment==
Shortt was described by John Maynard Keynes in &quot;The Economic Consequences of the Peace&quot; as &#x27;a capable but obstinate man too much bound to preconceived opinions&#x27;, though Michael Bentley wryly notes that such qualities may have been useful in his position as President of the BBFC.

He was &#x27;sociable, good-humoured and well-meaning&#x27;, remembered affectionately as &#x27;Teddie&#x27; in his native Newcastle, though very much shaped by his traditional 19th century education and experience. Liberal in politics, he was paternalistic in matters of human behaviour, art, and entertainment.

==Personal life==
Shortt married Isabella Stewart Scott, who had been born in Valparaiso, Chile to British parents. They had one son, Lieutenant William Edward Dudley Shortt, who was killed on 12 October 1917 while serving as a junior officer with the Scots Guards at the Battle of Passchendaele. He also had three daughters, including Doreen Ingrams. His old university, Durham, conferred the honorary degree of DCL upon him in 1920.

Shortt was an active freemason and was a member of University of Durham Lodge no. 3030, a London-based masonic lodge formed for alumni of Durham University. He served as Worshipful Master of the lodge in 1919 and again in 1926 and 1927.

He died on 10 November 1935 at his home in London, 140 Oakwood Court in Kensington at the age of 73. His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; described the cause of death as blood poisoning after influenza.

At the time of his death he was President of Den Norske Klub.

<text>Wilhelm Abraham Teller (9 January 17349 December 1804) was a German Protestant theologian who championed a rational approach to Christianity.

==Life and career==
Teller was born in Leipzig. His father, Romanus Teller (1703–1750), was a pastor at Leipzig, and afterwards became professor of theology in the University of Leipzig. He edited the earlier volumes of a (&quot;Bible Book&quot;, 19 volumes, 1749–1770) which was designed as an adaptation for German readers of the exegetical works of Andrew Willet, Henry Ainsworth, Simon Patrick, Matthew Poole, Matthew Henry and others. Wilhelm Abraham studied philosophy and theology in the university of his native town. Amongst the men whose influence mainly determined his theological position and line of work was Johann August Ernesti.

Teller&#x27;s writings presented rationalism in its course of development from biblical supernaturalism to the borders of deistical naturalism. His first learned production was a Latin translation of Benjamin Kennicott&#x27;s &quot;Dissertation on the State of the Printed Hebrew Text of the Old Testament&quot; (1756), which was followed the next year by an essay in which he expounded his own critical principles.

In 1761 he was appointed pastor, professor of theology and general superintendent in the University of Helmstedt. Here he pursued his exegetical, theological and historical researches, the results of which appeared in his &quot;Lehrbuch des christlichen Glaubens&quot; (&quot;Textbook of Christian Faith&quot;, 1764). This work caused some commotion, as much by the novelty of its method as by the heterodoxy of its matter, and more by its omissions than by its positive teaching, though everywhere the author sought to put theological doctrines in a decidedly modern form.

In 1767 Teller, whose attitude had made his position at Helmstedt intolerable, accepted an invitation from the Prussian minister for ecclesiastical affairs to the post of provost of Cölln, with a seat in the Lutheran Supreme Consistory of Berlin. Here he found himself in the company of the rationalistic theologians of Prussia: Friedrich Samuel Gottfried Sack (1738–1817), Johann Joachim Spalding (1714–1804) and others and became one of the leaders of the rationalistic party, and one of the chief contributors to CF Nicolai&#x27;s &quot;Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek&quot;. Teller was not long in making use of his freer position in Berlin.

In 1772 appeared the most popular of his books, &quot;Wörterbuch des Neuen Testamentes zur Erklärung der christlichen Lehre&quot; (&quot;Dictionary of the New Testament for the Explanation of Christian Doctrine&quot;, 6th ed., 1805). The object of this work was to recast the language and ideas of the New Testament and give them the form of 18th-century . The author maintains that the Graeco-Hebraic expressions must not be interpreted literally but explained in terms intelligible to the modern mind. By this lexicon Teller had put himself amongst the most advanced rationalists, and his opponents charged him with the design of overthrowing positive Christianity altogether. In 1786 the author became a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences.

The Wollner Edict of 9 July 1788, for the enforcement of Lutheran orthodoxy, and Teller&#x27;s action, as member of the consistorial council, in defiance of it (cf. his &quot;Wohlgemeinte Erinnerungen&quot;, &quot;Well-Meaning Reminders&quot;, 1788), led the Prussian government to pass upon him the sentence of suspension for three months, with forfeiture of his stipend. He was not, however, moved by such means, and (1792) issued his work &quot;Die Religion der Vollkommeneren&quot; (&quot;The Religion of the More Perfect&quot;), an exposition of his theological position, in which he advocated at length the idea, subsequently often urged, of the perfectibility of Christianity, that is, of the ultimate transformation of Christianity into a scheme of simple morality, with a complete rejection of all specifically Christian ideas and methods. This book represented the culminating point of German Enlightenment theology and is separated by a long process of development from the author&#x27;s . In the same year he published his &quot;Anleitung zur Religion überhaupt und zum Allgemeinen des Christenthums besonders; für die Jugend höherer und gebildeter Stünde aller Religions parteien&quot; (&quot;Manual of All Religion and the Generalities of Christianity Especially; for the Youth of Upper and Educated Classes of all Religious Denominations&quot;).

Besides his contributions to the &quot;Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek&quot;, he edited a popular and practically useful &quot;Magazin für Prediger&quot; (&quot;Magazine for Preachers&quot;, 1792–1801).

He died in Berlin.

<text>Chersonesus, contracted in medieval Greek to Cherson (), was an ancient Greek colony founded approximately 2,500 years ago in the southwestern part of the Crimean Peninsula. Settlers from Heraclea Pontica in Bithynia established the colony in the 6th century BC.

The ancient city was located on the shore of the Black Sea on the outskirts of present-day Sevastopol on the Crimean Peninsula, where it is referred to as &quot;Khersones&quot;. The site is part of the &quot;National Preserve of Tauric Chersonesos&quot;. The name &quot;Chersonesos&quot; in Greek means &quot;peninsula&quot; and aptly describes the site on which the colony was established. It should not be confused with the &quot;Tauric Chersonese&quot;, a name often applied to the whole of the southern Crimea.

During much of the classical period, Chersonesus operated as a democracy ruled by a group of elected archons and a council called the &quot;Damiorgi&quot;. As time passed, the government grew more oligarchic, with power concentrated in the hands of the archons. A form of oath sworn by all the citizens from the 3rd century BC onwards has survived to the present day. In 2013 UNESCO listed Chersonesus as a World Heritage Site.

== History ==
=== Greek colony ===
In the 5th century BC, Dorians from Heraclea Pontica on the Black Sea coast of Asia Minor founded the sea port of Chersonesos in southwestern Crimea (outside modern Sevastopol). It was a site with good deep-water harbors located at the edge of the territory of the indigenous Taurians. During much of the Classical Period, Chersonesus was a democracy ruled by a group of elected archons and a council called the Demiurgi. As time passed the government grew more oligarchic, with power concentrated in the hands of the archons. Up to the middle of the 4th century BC, Chersonesos remained a small city. It then expanded to lands in northwest Crimea, incorporating the colony of Kerkinitida and constructing numerous fortifications.

After defending itself against the Bosporan Kingdom, and the native Scythians and Tauri, and even extending its power over the west coast of the peninsula, it was compelled to call in the aid of Mithradates VI and his general Diophantus, c. 110 BC, and submitted to the Bosporan Kingdom. It was subject to Rome and received a garrison from the middle of the 1st century BC until the 370s AD, when it was captured by the Huns.

=== Byzantine era ===
It became a Byzantine possession during the Early Middle Ages and withstood a siege by the Göktürks in 581. Byzantine rule was slight: there was a small imperial garrison more for the town&#x27;s protection than for its control and it exercised a measure of self-government. It was useful to Byzantium in two ways: it was an observation point to watch the barbarian tribes, and its isolation made it a popular place of exile for those who angered the Roman and later Byzantine governments. Among its more famous &quot;inmates&quot; were Pope Clement I and Pope Martin I, and the deposed Byzantine Emperor Justinian II.

According to Theophanes the Confessor and others, Chersonesus was the residence of a Khazar governor (&quot;tudun&quot;) in the late 7th century. Between approximately 705 and 840, the city&#x27;s affairs were managed by elected officials called &quot;babaghuq&quot;, meaning &quot;father of the city&quot;.

In 833, Emperor Theophilus sent the nobleman Petronas Kamateros, who had recently overseen the construction of the Khazar fortress of Sarkel, to take direct control over the city and its environs, establishing the theme of Klimata/Cherson. It remained in Byzantine hands until the 980s, when it reportedly fell to Vladimir the Great of the Kievan Rus&#x27;. Vladimir agreed to evacuate the fortress only if Basil II&#x27;s sister Anna Porphyrogeneta would be given him in marriage. The demand caused a scandal in Constantinople. As a pre-condition for the marriage settlement, Vladimir was baptized here in 988, thus paving the way to the Baptism of Kievan Rus&#x27;. Thereafter Korsun&#x27; was evacuated.

Since this campaign is not recorded in Greek sources, historians have suggested that the account actually refers to the events of the Rus&#x27;–Byzantine War (1043) and to a different Vladimir. In fact, most valuables looted by the Slavs in Korsun&#x27; made their way to Novgorod (perhaps by way of Joachim the Korsunian, the first Novgorodian bishop, as his surname indicates ties to Korsun), where they were preserved in the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom until the 20th century. One of the most interesting items from this &quot;Korsun Treasure&quot; is the copper Korsun Gate, supposedly captured by the Novgorodians in Korsun&#x27; and now part of the St. Sophia Cathedral.

After the Fourth Crusade (1202–04), Chersonesus became dependent on the Byzantine Empire of Trebizond as the Principality of Theodoro. After the Siege of Trebizond (1461) the Principality of Theodoro became independent. The city fell under Genoese control in the early 13th century, which forebode the Greeks to trade there. In 1299, the town was sacked by the Mongol armies of Nogai Khan&#x27;s Golden Horde. Byzantine sources last mention Chersonesus in 1396, and based on archaeological evidence the site is presumed to have been abandoned in the following decades.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Chersonesus had been a Roman pre-Great Schism, later Greek/Orthodox, episcopal see for centuries, elevated early to the rank of archbishopric, since it is mentioned as such in the &quot;Notitiae Episcopatuum&quot;; it disappeared after the Turkish conquest in 1475 and the destruction of the city.

In the late 19th century, the grand Russian Orthodox St Vladimir&#x27;s Cathedral (completed 1892) was built on a small hill overlooking the site; designed in Byzantine style, it was intended to commemorate the site of Vladimir&#x27;s baptism.

In 1333, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chersonesus in Zechia was established, but it appears that it had only a bishop, a Dominican called Richard the Englishman. It is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular archbishopric, and is called specifically Chersonesus in Zechia to avoid confusion with other sees called Chersonesus.

== Remains ==
=== Archaeological site ===


Chersonesus&#x27;s ancient ruins are presently located in one of Sevastopol&#x27;s suburbs. They were excavated by the Russian government, starting from 1827. They are today a popular tourist attraction, protected as an archaeological park.

The buildings mix influences of Greek, Roman and Byzantine culture. The defensive wall was approximately long, 3.5 to 4 metres wide and 8 to 10 metres high with towers at a height of 10 to 12 metres. The walls enclosed an area of about . Buildings include a Roman amphitheatre and a Greek temple. The fact that the site has not been inhabited since the 14th century makes it an important representation of Byzantine life.

The surrounding land under the control of the city, the chora, consists of several square kilometres of ancient but now barren farmland, with remains of wine presses and defensive towers. According to archaeologists, the evidence suggests that the locals were paid to do the farm work instead of being enslaved.

The excavated tombstones hint at burial practices that were different from the Greek ones. Each stone marks the tomb of an individual, instead of the whole family and the decorations include only objects like sashes and weapons, instead of burial statues. Over half of the tombs archaeologists have found have bones of children. Burned remnants suggest that the city was plundered and destroyed.

In 2007, Chersonesus tied for fifth in the Seven Wonders of Ukraine poll.

On February 13, 2009, Ukrainian Defence Minister Yuriy Yekhanurov called on Russia&#x27;s Black Sea naval fleet to move its automobile depot from the site to another place. The location of the Russian Black Sea naval fleet&#x27;s automobile depot was one of the obstacles to the inclusion of the reserve on UNESCO&#x27;s list of world heritage sites.

In 2017, archaeologists discovered on the outskirts of Sevastopol, fragments of an ancient Greek altar with figures of gods.

In 2022, researchers analyzed human skeletal remains from a necropolis in the northern part of Chersonesus, dating to the earliest period of the colony (between the 5th and the 4th century BC). Most of the deceased individuals were positioned in a flexed burial position with their legs crouched and folded up to the chest, while a smaller number were buried in an extended position on their back with arms and legs straight. The researchers found that most individuals were genetically similar to each other, regardless of the burial position. This result challenges the widely held opinion that burial position in the northern Black Sea region was determined by the ancestry of the deceased, with flexed burials belonging to local Taurians, and extended burials belonging to Greek colonists.

=== The 1935 basilica ===
The 1935 basilica is the most famous basilica excavated in Chersonesus. The original name is unknown so &quot;1935&quot; refers to the year it was uncovered. The basilica was probably built in the 6th century on the site of an earlier temple, assumed by historians to be a synagogue, itself replacing a small temple dating from the early days of Christianity. The 1935 basilica is often used as an image representing Chersonesos. Its picture appears on one Ukrainian banknote.

=== Museum contents ===
As well as the archaeological sites, the museum has around 200,000 smaller items from 5 AD to the 15th century, over 5,000 of which are currently exhibited. These include:

*ancient texts, including the Oath of Chersonese citizens (3rd century BC), decrees in honour of Diophantus (2nd century BC) 
*a collection of coins
*a mosaic of black and white pebbles and coloured stones
*ancient ceramics
*architectural fragments, including ancient and medieval abacuses, reliefs, the remains of ancient murals

=== Current studies ===
The Institute of Classical Archaeology of the University of Texas at Austin and the local Archaeological Park has investigated the site since 1992. The Ukrainian government has included the site on its tentative World Heritage List. The site, however, is in danger of further urban encroachment and coastal erosion.

In 2013, the ruins of the ancient Greek city and the territory it controlled were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This World Heritage Site consists of seven locations that encompass the city of Chersonesus and six plots of agricultural land. The site was designated as a World Heritage site under the UNESCO criterion (ii), as an &quot;outstanding physical testimony&quot; to cultural exchange between ancient Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines, and (v), as a well-preserved example of how these ancient societies organized agricultural land. UNESCO considers these areas to show cultural lifestyles and land use of ancient populations that inhabited these areas.

In 2014, the Crimean peninsula was annexed by Russia, but UNESCO has maintained that it will continue to recognize Crimea and its heritage sites as belonging to Ukraine.

=== Problems and controversies ===
The encroachment of modern building in and around the ancient archaeological site, coupled with a lack of funding to prevent such development pressures, has left the site of Chersonesus firmly at risk.

In an October 2010 report titled &quot;Saving Our Vanishing Heritage&quot;, Global Heritage Fund identified Chersonesus as one of 12 worldwide sites most &quot;On the Verge&quot; of irreparable loss and destruction, citing insufficient management and development pressures as primary causes.

On July 29, 2015, the governor of Sevastopol, Sergey Menyaylo, controversially fired the director of the National Preserve of Tauric Chersonesos, Andrey Kulagin. He then appointed the head priest of the Russian Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Vladimir in Chersonesus, Sergiy Khalyuta, as the new director of the Preserve. This move caused heated protests from the staff of the Preserve, and all 109 members unanimously refused to work under the new director. The conflict attracted significant attention from the media, particularly due to its political connotations, given that Menyaylo had been appointed governor by Russian president Vladimir Putin, shortly after Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea in 2014. The workers claim that the conflict between Menyaylo and Kulagin started on July 11, when Kulagin complained about a road construction project on the territory of the Preserve which had been approved by governor Menyaylo without the permits necessary for construction works in protected areas. Eventually, under pressure from the workers and locals, Father Sergiy stepped down.

<text>The Bancroft treaties, also called the Bancroft conventions, were a series of agreements made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries between the United States and other countries. They recognized the right of each party&#x27;s nationals to become naturalized citizens of the other and defined circumstances in which naturalized persons were legally presumed to have abandoned their new citizenship and resumed their old one.

==Origin==

Named for historian and diplomat George Bancroft (1800–1891), who negotiated the first of these agreements with Prussia, the Bancroft treaties were mainly intended to prevent individuals from using naturalization as a way to avoid military service and other legal obligations in their native countries.

From 1868 to 1937, the United States entered into 25 Bancroft treaties covering 34 foreign countries. A typical Bancroft treaty had three major provisions. The first specified the terms under which each party would recognize the naturalization of its citizens by the other. (Five years&#x27; uninterrupted residence in the adopted country was the usual requirement.) The second provided that naturalized citizens who returned to their native country could be prosecuted for crimes that they allegedly committed before they emigrated. The third and most important provided that naturalized citizens who returned to their country of origin and stayed there for two continuous years would be presumed to have resumed their former nationality. That would require them to meet any unfulfilled military service obligation in their native country and deny them the diplomatic protection of their adopted one. Article III of the 1908 treaty with Portugal was typical:

==Constitutional infirmity==


Conceived in an era when the right of individuals to change their citizenship was not universally recognized, the Bancroft treaties represented an important step forward in securing recognition by foreign governments of the right of their nationals to become American citizens. But American constitutional law eventually made the treaties obsolete.

In &quot;Schneider v. Rusk&quot;, 377 U.S. 163 (1964), the Supreme Court invalidated a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (the McCarran-Walter Act) that would strip naturalized Americans of their citizenship after &quot;three&quot; years&#x27; continuous residence in their country of origin; and in &quot;Afroyim v. Rusk&quot;, 387 U.S. 253 (1967), the Supreme Court, reviewing part of the Nationality Act of 1940, held that Congress has no power to strip anyone of their citizenship, whether it is acquired by birth or by naturalization. These decisions strongly suggested that any future case of involuntary loss of citizenship under one of the Bancroft treaties probably would not survive a Supreme Court challenge.

==Termination of the Bancroft treaties==

Concluding that the Bancroft treaties were unenforceable, the administration of President Jimmy Carter, acting in consultation with the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, gave notice in 1980 terminating the treaties with 18 of the 21 countries with which they were still in force. The exceptions were the treaties with Albania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. The treaty with Albania was terminated in 1991 when Albania and the United States re-established diplomatic relations at the end of the Cold War. The treaty with the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic as successor states to the former Czechoslovakia was terminated by the United States in 1997. In the last years of Barack Obama&#x27;s Presidency the treaty with Bulgaria was terminated.

<doc id="1216133" wikidata="Q1138032" url="?curid=1216133" title="Covenant Chain">
<text>The Covenant Chain was a series of alliances and treaties developed during the seventeenth century, primarily between the Iroquois Confederacy (Haudenosaunee) and the British colonies of North America, with other Native American tribes added. First met in the New York area at a time of violence and social instability for the colonies and Native Americans, the English and Iroquois councils and subsequent treaties were based on supporting peace and stability to preserve trade. They addressed issues of colonial settlement, and tried to suppress violence between the colonists and Indian tribes, as well as among the tribes, from New England to the Colony of Virginia.

==History==
The Covenant Chain is embodied in the Two Row Wampum of the Iroquois, known as the people of the longhouse - Haudenosaunee. It was based in agreements negotiated between Dutch settlers in New Netherland (present-day New York) and the Five Nations of the Iroquois (or &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;) early in the 17th century. Their emphasis was on trade with the Native Americans. As the historian Bernard Bailyn has noted, all the colonies, Dutch and English, were first established to create profits.

Through the Beaver Wars in the seventeenth century, the Iroquois conquered other tribes and territories for new hunting grounds and to take captives to add to their populations depleted from warfare and new European infectious diseases. The tribes in New England suffered even more depletion. The Iroquois expanded their influence, conquering or displacing other tribes from Maritime Canada west to the Mississippi Valley, and from the Canadian Shield south to the Ohio Valley.

When the English took over New Netherland in 1664 and established the Province of New York, they renewed these agreements. Conflicts erupted in New England in King Philip&#x27;s War in 1675, &quot;the most destructive war&quot; in seventeenth-century North America, in which more than 600 colonists and 3,000 Indians died. Nearly at the same time was Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion in Virginia. Both resulted in widespread suffering and loss among Native Americans and colonists.

Because of the standing relationship with the Iroquois and the extensive influence of the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;, in August 1675, New York&#x27;s Governor Sir Edmund Andros asked them for help in ending regional conflicts of the time in New England and the Chesapeake. He worked with the Onondaga leader Daniel Garacontié.

The term &quot;Covenant Chain&quot; was derived from the metaphor of a silver chain holding the English sailing ship to the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot; (Iroquois) Tree of Peace in the Onondaga Nation. A three-link silver chain was made to symbolize their first agreement. The links represent &quot;Peace, Friendship and Respect&quot; between the Haudenosaunee and the Crown. It was also the first written treaty to use such phrases as:

::...as long as the sun shines upon the earth;
::as long as the waters flow;
::as long as the grass grows green, peace will last.

===Treaties===
They negotiated the signing of several treaties that expanded the number of tribes and colonies involved:
* A 1676 treaty between the Mohawk nation and the colonies of Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut which ended King Philip&#x27;s War in New England, as the Mohawk denied Metacom gunpowder and attacked his winter camp. It also addressed relations between the Iroquois and a number of other tribes, including the Mahican of the Hudson River, and the Nipmuc, Mohegan, and Massachusett of New England.
* A 1677 treaty between the Five Nations of the Iroquois and the Delaware (Lenape), on one side, and the colonies of Virginia and Maryland, allied with the Susquehannock on the other, to obtain peace.

Many of the Susquehannock migrated north into western New York, re-settling with the Seneca and Onondaga of the Iroquois.

The treaties marked a new era in colonial history, in which the Chesapeake had nearly eighty years of peace. New York and the Haudenosaunee became the focus of English Indian policy. In the mid-eighteenth century, Sir William Johnson, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Northern Department and based in central New York, had great influence and was knighted for his service. Through the early decades of the eighteenth century, New England continued to have conflicts with New France and its Abenaki allies, leading to years of raiding by both sides and ransoming of captives.

In these agreements, the colonies agreed to hold negotiations generally at Albany, New York, under the auspices of the New York governor, as the covenant had first been established there. As a result, according to the historian Daniel Richter, &quot;Iroquois and New Yorkers played dominant but seldom dictatorial roles&quot; in the maintenance of these treaties.

At a council meeting in 1684, Virginia Governor Lord Effingham used the phrase &quot;covenant chain&quot; to describe these agreements. The metaphor was continued by a Seneca speaker, who said: &quot;Let the Chaine be Kept Cleane and bright as Silver that the great tree that is can not break it a peeces if it should fall upon itt.&quot;

Later colonial administrators assumed that these treaties granted the English sovereign control over the Iroquois and other tribes involved in the chain. The Iroquois did not agree with this and believed themselves at least to be equals. In a Covenant Chain council that took place in 1692, the Iroquois leaders asserted:

::You say that you are our father and I am your son...
::...We will not be like Father and Son, but like Brothers.

===Dissolution===
The Covenant Chain continued until 1753, when the Mohawk, claiming to have been cheated out of lands rightfully theirs in New York, declared that the chain was broken.

Howard Zinn, in his &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot; discusses the taking of the Mohawk land: 


The Albany Congress was called to help repair the chain. Colonial delegates failed to work together to improve the diplomatic relationship with the Iroquois, a serious shortcoming on the eve of the French and Indian War. As a result, the British government took the responsibility of Native American diplomacy out of the hands of the colonies and established the British Indian Department in 1755.

In a 1755 council with the Iroquois, William Johnson, Superintendent of the Northern Department based in central New York, renewed and restated the chain. He called their agreement the &quot;Covenant Chain of love and friendship&quot;, saying that the chain has been attached to the immovable mountains and that every year the British would meet with the Iroquois to &quot;strengthen and brighten&quot; the chain. He developed great influence among the Iroquois and was later knighted for his contributions to development in the Northeast.

==Commemoration==
In June 2010, Queen Elizabeth II of Canada renewed the Covenant Chain Treaties by presenting 8 silver hand bells each to Band Chiefs from Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory and Six Nations of the Grand River in commemoration of 300 years of the Covenant Chain. The bells were inscribed &quot;The Silver Chain of Friendship 1710–2010&quot; (which was a common term often used throughout history when the Chain was renewed).

<text>Jerry&#x27;s Girls is a musical revue based on the songs of composer/lyricist Jerry Herman.

==Production history==
Created by Herman and Larry Alford in 1981, the show originated as a modest presentation at Onstage, a nightclub located in the Theater District in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The revue consisted of four actresses and Herman. Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John S. Wilson called it &quot;a brilliantly lively and scintillating evening of cabaret.&quot;

After &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; opened to rave reviews two years later, producer Zev Buffman approached the pair and suggested they mount a full-scale, all-star version. On February 28, 1984, the expanded &quot;Jerry&#x27;s Girls&quot; premiered at the Royal Poinciana Playhouse in Palm Beach, Florida, with Carol Channing, Andrea McArdle, and Leslie Uggams, backed by an all-female chorus, recreating scenes and songs from Herman&#x27;s hits, including &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, &quot;Mame&quot;, and &quot;Mack and Mabel&quot;. &quot;Jerry&#x27;s Girls&quot;, the show&#x27;s opening number set to the music of &quot;It&#x27;s Today&quot; from &quot;Mame&quot;, enumerated the many actresses who had appeared in Herman&#x27;s shows over the years. The show then toured, playing at the Kennedy Center&#x27;s Eisenhower Theater for six weeks in June 1984. The revue went on to play engagements in 1984: in Kansas City, Missouri, Seattle, Vancouver, British Columbia, San Francisco, Denver, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and New Orleans. An original cast recording was released by Polydor Records.

The revue premiered on Broadway, directed by Alford and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, on December 18, 1985 at the St. James Theatre, where it ran for 141 performances and 14 previews. Uggams was joined by new cast members Dorothy Loudon and Chita Rivera. (Channing had other commitments and Chita Rivera was cast for her strong dancing.) A chorus of eight singers was added. Some reviewers praised the revue, with Clive Barnes writing &quot;It can stay at the St. James Theatre forever, at the very least.&quot;

In a critical review, Frank Rich of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;The only thing that &quot;Jerry&#x27;s Girls&quot; has in common with a bona fide Jerry Herman musical is that it occupies the St. James, the theater where Dolly once promised she&#x27;d never go away again... Whatever the point of the all-female cast, one must still wonder why the show&#x27;s particular female stars were chosen. None of them have been associated with Mr. Herman&#x27;s musicals. Only one (Miss Uggams) is primarily a singer. All three have strident mannerisms that the director, Larry Alford, takes sadistic glee in calling to our attention.&quot;

Chita Rivera received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical.

=== International productions ===
An Australian production featuring Debbie Byrne, Judi Connelli, Marcia Hines and Jeanne Little played in Sydney and Melbourne in 1987. It was staged by Alford with set and costume design by Roger Kirk.

The revue was presented in London at the St. James Studio in March 2015, Produced by Katy Lipson for Aria Entertainment and Guy James, starring Anna-Jane Casey, Ria Jones and Sarah-Louise Young, with direction by Kate Golledge and choreography by Matthew Cole. The revue transferred to the Off-West End Jermyn Street Theatre for a 3-week run in May 2015, with Emma Barton, Ria Jones and Sarah-Louise Young. The reviewer of the Jermyn Street Theatre production wrote: &quot;When all three are singing and dancing together, the production cannot be faulted. The harmonies are strong and secure, and give real substance to Herman’s magnificent tunes.&quot;

The Production Company presented the revue at the Playhouse, Arts Centre, Melbourne, Australia from 21 November to 6 December 2015. This production included eleven leading actresses. The director Dean Bryant set the revue in a rehearsal hall.

Infinity coves range from a simple roll of paper to whole studios (often used for photographing cars). The principle of design is that everything behind the object is curved so that no edges can be seen.</text><links>

<doc id="1216149" wikidata="Q215853" url="?curid=1216149" title="Christoph Friedrich Nicolai">
<text>Christoph Friedrich Nicolai (18 March 1733 – 11 January 1811) was a German writer, bookseller, critic, and regional historian, who authored satirical novels and travelogues.

==Life==

Nicolai was born in Berlin, where his father, (d. 1752), was the founder of the bookseller &quot;&quot;. He received a good education, and in 1749 went to Frankfurt (Oder) to learn his father&#x27;s business, finding time also to become acquainted with English literature.

In 1752 Nicolai returned to Berlin, and began to take part in literary controversy by defending John Milton against the attacks of JC Gottsched. His &quot;Briefe über den jetzigen Zustand der schönen Wissenschaften in Deutschland&quot;, published anonymously in 1755 and reprinted by G Ellinger in 1894, were directed against both Gottsched and Gottsched&#x27;s Swiss opponents, Johann Jakob Bodmer and Johann Jakob Breitinger; his enthusiasm for English literature won for him the friendship of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Moses Mendelssohn. In association with Mendelssohn he established in 1757 the &quot;Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften&quot;, a periodical which he conducted until 1760. Together with Lessing and Mendelssohn, Nicolai edited the famous book review journal &quot;Briefe, die neueste Literatur betreffend&quot; between 1759 and 1765; and from 1765 to 1792 he edited another book review journal &quot;Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek&quot;. This latter periodical served as the organ of the so-called popular philosophers, who warred against authority in religion and against what they conceived to be extravagance in literature.

His romances are largely forgotten, although &quot;Das Leben und die Meinungen des Herrn Magister Sebaldus Nothanker&quot; (1773–1776), and his satire on Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Werther&quot;, &quot;Freuden des jungen Werthers&quot; (1775), had a certain reputation in their day. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, his &quot;Anekdoten von König Friedrich II. von Preussen&quot; (1788–92), an account of events in the court of Frederick II the Great, has some historical value. Between 1788 and 1796, Nicolai published in twelve volumes a &quot;Beschreibung einer Reise durch Deutschland und die Schweiz&quot;, which bears witness to the conservatism of his views in later life. The sober narrow-mindedness and grumpy stubbornness of the aging writer, who willingly pretended to be Lessing&#x27;s spiritual heir, eventually led to the fact that his true merits were forgotten.

Nicolai also offered an early account of visual hallucinosis with preservation of insight and unrelated to madness: &quot;suddenly I observed, at the distance of ten paces, the figure of a deceased person. I asked my wife whether she saw it. She saw nothing but being much alarmed … sent for the physician.&quot; The visions were beyond his control and could not be elicited at will. In a short story by Wilkie Collins entitled &quot;Mrs. Zant and the Ghost,&quot; the narrator compares the main character to the &quot;celebrated case of the bookseller, Nicolai, of Berlin&quot; in regards to illusions &quot;without being accompanied by derangement of the intellectual powers.&quot;

Nicolai died in 1811 in Berlin.

Nicolai&#x27;s &quot;Bildniss und Selbsbiographie&quot; was published by Moses Samuel Löwe in the &quot;Bildnisse jetzt lebender Berliner Gelehrter&quot;, in 1806.

<doc id="1216153" wikidata="Q7794558" url="?curid=1216153" title="Thomas Tresham (died 1605)">
<text>Sir Thomas Tresham (1543 – 11 September 1605) was a prominent recusant Catholic landowner in Elizabethan Northamptonshire. He died two years after the accession of James VI and I.

==Life==
Tresham was brought up in the Throckmorton household. He inherited large estates in 1559 from his grandfather and namesake Thomas Tresham I, establishing him as a member of the Catholic elite. Through his grandmother, a daughter of William Parr, 1st Baron Parr of Horton, he was related to Queen Catherine, sixth wife of Henry VIII. He was widely regarded as clever and well educated, a correspondent of William Cecil, the Secretary of State to Queen Elizabeth, and Sir Christopher Hatton, the Lord Chancellor.

Well read, Tresham dedicated much of his life to collecting books. He was pricked as High Sheriff of Northamptonshire in 1573 and was knighted at the Queen&#x27;s Royal Progress at Kenilworth in 1575. He frequently entertained large numbers of friends and acquaintances and pursued a successful reforming estate policy. His recusancy, Jesuit connections and arguments for the state&#x27;s lack of jurisdiction in matters of conscience made him the subject of official attention, and he was imprisoned several times and fined heavily. At a time when Queen Elizabeth was anxious about the Catholic threat posed by Spain and by her cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, Catholics were made targets for persecution by their spiritual loyalty to another temporal power (the Pope and, consequently, in the view of Protestants, the Catholic king of Spain). Between 1581 and 1605, Tresham paid penalties totalling just under £8,000 (equivalent to £ million in ). These heavy financial demands were, in reality, overshadowed by the expense of his building projects and his insistence on making advantageous marriages for his six daughters, bringing with them sizeable dowries (£12,200). His credit was thus impaired, and the ill-advised involvement of his son, Francis, in the Earl of Essex&#x27;s rebellion, cost him over £3,000. As a Catholic known for his connection to the Jesuit Edmund Campion, and who argued for an individual&#x27;s right to act according to his conscience unmolested, he was tarred with the brush of disloyalty, a mark he fiercely rejected. Ultimately, his son Lewis successfully ate through what little family money was left.

He left three notable buildings in Northamptonshire, the extraordinary Rushton Triangular Lodge and the unfinished Lyveden New Bield, both of which embody the strength of his faith. The Triangular Lodge bears witness to Tresham&#x27;s fidelity to the doctrine of the Trinity. There was also a more personal connection: above the door, we find the inscription &#x27;Tres testimonium dant&#x27; (&#x27;the three bear witness&#x27;, or, perhaps, &#x27;Tres bears witness&#x27;). &#x27;Tres&#x27; may be a moment of self-reference; it was his wife&#x27;s pet name for him. Tresham himself was the architect of these designs, and the extant family papers in the British Library reveal some of his plans. His sense of civic responsibility in local society, occasioned by his gentility and the expectations of his rank and family practice, led him to begin building the Market House at Rothwell in 1577, thought to be a sessions house and decorated with the arms of other local families. Sir Thomas was a considerable landowner at his death in 1605, but his estate had £11,000 of debt (equivalent to £ million in ).

==Marriage and children==
In 1566, he married Muriel, a daughter of Sir Robert Throckmorton and Elizabeth Hussey. Throckmorton was the grandson of Elizabeth FitzHugh, who was mother to William Parr, 1st Baron Parr of Horton by her first marriage. Lord Parr was a great-grandfather of Tresham. The Throckmorton family was a wealthy Catholic family from Coughton Court in Warwickshire and Tresham had been Sir Robert&#x27;s ward. Muriel Tresham once wrote to the Countess of Bedford for her help, as a &quot;lowly wife on my knees with importunacy.&quot;

Thomas and Muriel had eleven children, including;
*Francis (d. December 1605)
*Mary (d. 13 October 1664); married Thomas Brudenell, 1st Earl of Cardigan
*Elizabeth; married William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle
*Frances; married Edward Stourton, 10th Baron Stourton
*Catherine (died 1623), who married Sir John Webb and was mother to Sir John Webb, 1st Baronet. Catherine, Lady Webb, was killed in the accident known as the Fatal Vespers.
*Bridget; married Edward Parham (died 1633).

His elder son, Francis, inherited the titles, estate and debt, and became embroiled in the Gunpowder Plot later that year along with his cousins Robert Catesby and Thomas Wintour. Imprisoned for his actions, Francis met an early death from natural causes in December 1605, avoiding certain execution. Nevertheless, he was decapitated after his death and his head was displayed as that of a notorious traitor. His role in the plot has been the subject of debate by historians and it has been largely accepted that he was the author of the famous &#x27;Monteagle Letter&#x27;. However widely agreed his authorship of the letter to his relative, it remains conjectural.

<text>Matthew Poole (1624–1679) was an English Non-conformist theologian and biblical commentator.

==Life to 1662==
He was born at York, the son of Francis Pole, but he spelled his name Poole, and in Latin Polus; his mother was a daughter of Alderman Toppins there. He was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, from 1645, under John Worthington. Having graduated B.A. at the beginning of 1649, he succeeded Anthony Tuckney, in the sequestered rectory of St Michael le Querne, then in the fifth classis of the London province, under the parliamentary system of presbyterianism. This was his only preferment. He proceeded M.A. in 1652. On 14 July 1657 he was one of eleven Cambridge graduates incorporated M.A. at Oxford on occasion of the visit of Richard Cromwell as chancellor.

Poole was a &quot;jure divino&quot; presbyterian, and an authorised defender of the views on ordination of the London provincial assembly, as formulated by William Blackmore. After the Restoration of the English monarchy, in a sermon of 26 August 1660 before the lord mayor Sir Thomas Aleyn at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, he made a case for simplicity in public worship. On the passing of the Uniformity Act 1662 he resigned his living, and was succeeded by R. Booker on 29 August 1662.

==Later life==
Though he occasionally preached and printed some tracts, Poole made no attempt to gather a congregation. He had a patrimony of £100 a year, on which he lived.

He was one of those who presented to the king &quot;a cautious and moderate thanksgiving&quot; for the indulgence of 15 March 1672, and were offered royal bounty. Gilbert Burnet reports, on Edward Stillingfleet&#x27;s authority, that Poole received for two years a pension of £50. Early in 1675 he entered with Richard Baxter into a negotiation for comprehension, promoted by John Tillotson, which came to nothing. According to Henry Sampson, Poole made provision for a nonconformist ministry and day-school at Tunbridge Wells, Kent.

In his depositions relative to the alleged Popish plot (September 1678), Titus Oates had represented Poole as marked for assassination, because of his tract (1666) on the &quot;Nullity of the Romish Faith&quot;. Poole gave some credit to this, reportedly after a scare on returning home one evening near Clerkenwell with Josiah Chorley. Poole left England, and settled at Amsterdam. Here he died on 12 October 1679 (N.S.), and was buried in a vault of the English Reformed Church, Amsterdam. His wife was buried on 11 August 1668 at St Andrew Holborn, Stillingfleet preaching the funeral sermon. He left a son, who died in 1697.

==Works==

In 1654 Poole published a tract against John Biddle. In 1658 he put forward a scheme for a scholarship for university courses, for those intending to enter the ministry. The plan was approved by Worthington and Tuckney, and had the support also of John Arrowsmith, Ralph Cudworth, William Dillingham, and Benjamin Whichcote. Money was raised, and supported William Sherlock at Peterhouse. His &quot;Vox Clamantis&quot; gives his view of the ecclesiastical situation after 1662.

The work with which his name is principally associated is the &quot;Synopsis criticorum biblicorum&quot; (5 vols fol., 1669-1676), in which he summarizes the views of one hundred and fifty biblical critics. On the suggestion of William Lloyd, Poole undertook the &quot;Synopsis&quot; as a digest of biblical commentators, from 1666. It took ten years, with relaxation often at Henry Ashurst&#x27;s house. The prospectus of Poole&#x27;s work mustered of eight bishops and five continental scholars. A patent for the work was obtained on 14 October 1667, and the first volume was ready for the press, when difficulties were raised by Cornelius Bee, publisher of the &quot;Critici Sacri&quot; (1660); the matter was decided in Poole&#x27;s favour. Rabbinical sources and Roman Catholic commentators are included; little is taken from John Calvin, nothing from Martin Luther. The book was written in Latin and is currently being translated into English by the Matthew Poole Project.

Poole also wrote &quot;English Annotations on the Holy Bible&quot;, completing the chapters as far as Isaiah 58 before his death in 1679. The rest of the Annotations were completed by friends and colleagues among his Nonconformist brethren. The first printing of the completed edition was in 1685 [1683?], 2 volumes folio, followed by editions in 1688, 1696 (with valuable chapter outlines added by the editors, Samuel Clark and Edward Veale), and the 4th and definitive edition in 1700, the basis of all others. The other authors, by Biblical book, were:
* Isaiah 59-60 – John Jackson
* Isaiah 61-66, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Gospels, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Revelation – Dr. John Collinges
* Ezekiel, Minor Prophets – Henry Hurst
* Daniel – William Cooper
* Acts – Peter Vinke
* Romans – Richard Mayo
* Ephesians, James, 1 and 2 Peter – Edward Veale
* 1 and 2 Thessalonians – Matthew Barker
* Philippians, Colossians – Richard Adams
* Hebrews – Obadiah Hughes
* 1, 2 and 3 John – John Howe

<text>Iguaçu National Park () is a national park in Paraná State, Brazil. It comprises a total area of and a length of about , of which are natural borders by bodies of water and the Argentine and Brazilian sides together comprise around . Iguaçu National Park was created by federal decree nr. 1035 of 10 January 1939 and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986. The park is managed by Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio).

The park shares a border with Iguazú National Park in Argentina. It also has one of the world&#x27;s largest waterfalls, extending over some . It is home to many rare and endangered species of flora and fauna, among them the giant otter and the giant anteater. The clouds of spray produced by the waterfall are conducive to the growth of lush vegetation.

==History==

The Iguaçu National Park owes its name to the fact it includes an important area of the Iguazu River (Portuguese: Rio Iguaçu). Approximately of the length of the river makes up the Iguaçu Falls.

It is the most important park of the Prata Basin and, since it is a haven to a significant genetic asset of animal and vegetal species, it was the first park in Brazil to receive a Management Plan. As foreseen by Rebouças, the park&#x27;s basic goal is the preservation of the highly relevant ecologically and scenic natural ecosystems, thus enabling scientific research and the development of environmental education and interpretation activities, recreation in natural surroundings and the ecological tourism.

The Iguaçu National Park is spectacular as well as pioneering. The first proposal for a Brazilian national park aimed at providing a pristine environment to &quot;future generations&quot;, just as &quot;it had been created by God&quot; and endowed with &quot;all possible preservation, from the beautiful to the sublime, from the picturesque to the awesome&quot; and &quot;an unmatched flora&quot; located in the &quot;magnificent Iguaçu waterfalls&quot;. These were the words used by André Rebouças, an engineer, in his book &quot;Provinces of Paraná, Railways to Mato Grosso and Bolivia&quot;, which started up the campaign aimed at preserving the Iguaçu Falls way back in 1876, when Yellowstone National Park, the first national park on the planet, was four years old.

On November 17, 1986, during the UNESCO conference held in Paris, the Iguaçu National Park was listed as Natural Heritage of Humanity and is one of the largest forest preservation areas in South America.

In Brazil, the Park has boundaries with the following municipalities: Foz do Iguaçu, Medianeira, Matelândia, Céu Azul, São Miguel do Iguaçu, Santa Terezinha de Itaipu, Santa Tereza do Oeste, Capitão Leônidas Marque, Capanema and Serranópolis.

The Park is located in the westernmost region of the state of Paraná, in the Iguaçú river basin, from downtown Foz do Iguaçú. It borders Argentina, where the Iguazu National Park, which was implemented in 1934, is located. The border between the two countries and their national parks is made by the Iguaçú river, whose source is near the Serra (mountain range) do Mar near Curitiba and runs for throughout the state of Paraná. The river estuary is located 18 km downriver from the Falls, where it flows into the Paraná river. This meeting of rivers forms the triple Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay border.

Fishing regulations were published on 2 October 2008, covering conservation areas and their buffer zones in the Paraná River basin.
They were the Morro do Diabo State Park, Rio do Peixe State Park, Aguapeí State Park, Mico Leão Preto Ecological Station, Ivinhema State Park, Ilha Grande National Park, Caiuá Ecological Station and Iguaçu National Park. The Santa Maria Ecological Corridor connects the Iguaçu National Park with the protected margins of Lake Itaipu, and via these margins with the Ilha Grande National Park.
The park would be part of the proposed Trinational Biodiversity Corridor, which aims to provide forest connections between conservation units in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina in the Upper Paraná ecoregion.
==Tourism==
The area of the park open for visitation and where the concession areas of Cataratas do Iguaçú S/A are located, accounts for approximately 0.3% of the total area of the park.

The most spectacular sightseeing of the park is the Iguaçú Falls, which form a 2,700m wide semicircle, while the water falls from a height of . The number of waterfalls ranges from 150 and 300 depending on the Iguaçú river flow. Besides the exuberant waterfalls, there are other attractions such as rich fauna, the Poço Preto (the Black Well), the Macuco Waterfall, the Visitors Center, the Santos Dumont Statue, a homage paid by VASP (a defunct airline company) to the &quot;Father of Aviation&quot;, who lent all his prestige and efforts in turning the falls area into a National Park. The park received 1,550,700 visitors in 2014.

<text>Dara (, also Δάρας - &quot;Daras&quot;) is a community in the municipal unit of Levidi, northern Arcadia, Greece. It is situated on a mountain slope near the border with Achaea. It is 2 km southeast of Pankrati (Achaea), 5 km northeast of Prasino, 16 km north of Vytina and 16 km northeast of Levidi. The Greek National Road 33 (Patras - Levidi) passes south of the village. Dara has a historical folklore museum displaying the woodcarvings of Giannis Bakopoulos.

==Historical population==

The Arvanites historically lived in this village, as it was founded and named by medieval Albanian migrants into the region. The Dara family was one of the first to migrate from Albania to Italy and Greece after Skanderbeg&#x27;s death. They migrated from the region of Rrjoll, northern Albania, Malësia. They named the village Dara after themselves when they settled here in the Middle Ages.

The Dara family in southern Italy exist as a part of the Arbëreshë community in Palazzo Adriano, a town in Sicily. Gabriele Dara, was an Arbëreshë politician and poet of the 19th century. He is regarded as one of the early writers of the Albanian National Awakening. He was a part of the Dara family of southern Italy which is also related to the Dara family which founded this settlement of Dara.

Arvanitika is not spoken here anymore due to gradual assimilation over time and the population identify as Greeks.

<doc id="1216176" wikidata="Q2361986" url="?curid=1216176" title="Legend of Mana">
<text>Legend of Mana is a 1999 action role-playing game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) for the PlayStation. It was the fourth game released in the &quot;Mana&quot; series, following 1995&#x27;s &quot;Trials of Mana&quot;. Set in a high fantasy universe, the game follows an unnamed hero as they restore the land of Fa&#x27;Diel by creating the world around them and completing a number of interrelated quests in order to restore the Tree of Mana.

While incorporating action role-playing elements from the prior games in the series, such as real-time battles, &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; has its own distinct style of gameplay. Most notably, it gives the player the ability to shape the world&#x27;s structure through the Land Make system, generating regions and quests in a non-linear gameplay system rather than a strong main plotline. &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; was directed by series creator Koichi Ishii, designed by Akihiko Matsui, and produced by veteran Square director and producer Akitoshi Kawazu.

The game had high sales, selling 400,000 copies in its first week of release and 700,000 by the end of 1999. Reviews were less positive than for prior games in the series. Critics gave considerable acclaim to its vibrant and colorful hand-drawn graphics and soundtrack by Yoko Shimomura, but were critical of the lack of a clear main storyline, stating that it left the game feeling disjointed. The game was re-released as a part of both the PlayStation&#x27;s and Square Enix&#x27;s best-sellers lines. It was released as a PSOne Classic in Japan and North America. A remastered version was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Windows on June 24, 2021, for Android and iOS on December 7, 2021, and for Xbox Series X/S on September 26, 2024. An anime adaptation by Yokohama Animation Laboratory and Graphinica titled &quot;Legend of Mana: The Teardrop Crystal&quot; aired from October to December 2022.

==Gameplay==
Like previous games in the &quot;Mana&quot; series, &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; displays an angled top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls the unnamed main character, and is assisted by up to two companions. One of these companions is an optional support character, which depends on what quest the player is performing, while another companion can be chosen by the player out of a roster of monsters, pets, and golems. Both companions are typically controlled by the game&#x27;s AI, though a second player can take control of the support character, or load in their own character from a different save file, if present. The main character and companions each have their own set of numerical attributes including hit points and strength, which represent the amount of damage the player can take or cause. These stats grow whenever the player advances a level, after gaining enough experience points from battle with enemies.

Battles occur when the player character encounters an enemy while traversing the world. Combat takes place in real-time, and in the location the player found the enemy rather than a separate battle screen. The main character can equip a variety of weapons, armors, and accessories. Weapons let the player perform abilities in combat. Referred to as Special Techs, these abilities are powerful attacks by the main characters and support characters that can be used when the special move meter is full. This meter fills as the player damages enemies. Each weapon, such as a sword or spear, has a set number of special attacks to learn, which can hit single or multiple targets and can be assigned to different buttons on the controller.

&quot;Legend of Mana&quot;, unlike previous games in the Mana series, does not feature a set journey through a fixed world. Instead, it features a unique &quot;Land Make&quot; system where the player generates the structure of the game world by placing objects, named Artifacts, on empty square plots on a map. This map takes the form of a grid of spaces presented in an isometric viewpoint on a map screen. When an Artifact is placed in a space on the map, it creates a Land, and the player can enter that Land by selecting the position on the map. Adjacent Lands are not connected; to move from one land to another the player must first return to the map screen. Different Lands are generated from different Artifacts, each containing a quest which upon completion usually gives the player another Artifact to place. Lands can also contain additional quests. Each Land is ranked from 0 (no presence) to 3 (strong presence) in its strength in each Spirit of Mana; this in turn causes magic of that element to be stronger in that Land. The strength of the rankings is dependent on the Artifact, its position on the Map, and the rankings of adjacent Lands. Many locations have non-player characters who give quests and information or sell equipment. Other areas feature enemies and bosses with which the player can battle.

In addition to the main game, after certain quests are completed &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; gives the player the option to delve into optional gameplay aspects centered around the hero or heroine&#x27;s house. The player can forge or improve weapons and armor using raw materials found throughout the game, or combine equipment with items to change their power or add special effects. They can grow different types of fruit in the orchard, raise pets to use as adventuring companions, create items, and build golems. Pets can also be raised with the Japan-only PocketStation peripheral, and two players can battle each other in an arena.

==Plot==
===Setting===
&quot;Legend of Mana&quot; is set in the fictional world of Fa&#x27;Diel. The Mana Tree, the giver of mana and life for the world, burned down almost entirely nine centuries prior to the events of the game. A war erupted between faeries, human, and others seeking the scarce power of mana that was left. When the war concluded, the burnt Mana Tree slept as it regrew and the many lands of the world were stored in ancient artifacts. A hero, controlled by the player, is self-charged with restoring the world, and mana, to its former self. The Lands of Fa&#x27;Diel are populated with a large number of different creatures, including humans, faeries, demons, the jewel-hearted Jumi race, plant-like Sproutlings and Flowerlings, miner bears called Dudbears, and shadowy beings of the Underworld known as Shadoles. Fa&#x27;Diel is also the home of a host of anthropomorphic animals and objects, as well as monsters from other &quot;Mana&quot; titles such as Rabites, Chobin Hoods, and Goblins. The player controls the protagonist of the game, who is either a male or female silent protagonist. The character is unnamed and no information is given about their past; their history and personality is meant to be determined by the player.

===Characters and story branches===
Rather than a single, overarching plot, the story of &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; is composed of a multitude of quests split into three main quest arcs, numerous other quests, and a final quest arc. Each main quest arc contains optional side-quests in addition to the main quests. Whenever the player completes the required portions of one of the quest arcs they are allowed to begin the final arc and finish the game, even if the other arcs have not yet been started or completed. The three main quest arcs prior to the final arc are: the Jumi arc, the Larc and Sierra arc, and the Matilda and Irwin arc.

The first main arc is the story of the Jumi, a dying race of people who have external jewel hearts which are considered valuable. The Jumi have long been a persecuted people, and many magic characters in this game refer to them as &quot;dirt&quot; as a pejorative on their jewel cores. This branch focuses on Elazul and Pearl, who are among the few survivors of the Jumi. Elazul is a Jumi Knight, and the mission of his life is to protect the Jumi Guardian Pearl at any cost, even in the face of the jewel hunter, Sandra. The player assists them in helping the Jumi.

The second arc is the story of Larc and Sierra—brother and sister dragoons who serve different dragon masters and fight on opposite sides of the same war for power. Larc serves the dragon Drakonis, who wants to kill the other three dragons so that he can rule the world. Larc blackmails the game&#x27;s protagonist to help him in this quest. Sierra, a dragoon for Vadise the White Dragon, wants to stop Drakonis without hurting her brother Larc. In the end, Drakonis is defeated again and banished to the underworld, and Larc is freed from Drakonis&#x27; rule.

The third arc is the complicated love story of four childhood friends: Matilda, Irwin, Daena and Escad. Irwin is a half-demon who is angry that society prevents him from a relationship with the holy leader Matilda, and seeks to destroy the world in retribution. Escad seeks to destroy Irwin, and Daena tries to act as a mediator between all parties while keeping Matilda away from Irwin. The conflict eventually escalates into a war between humans and faeries. Depending on the choices of the player, either Daena or Escad will die, while the player helps bring an end to the conflict.

Regardless of which path(s) the hero decides to take, they begin the game&#x27;s final story, titled &quot;Legend of Mana&quot;. This arc concerns the re-appearance of the Mana Tree. The player journeys to the Mana Tree and scales it, but upon reaching the top they find that the Mana Goddess has become corrupted and the tree is rotten. The player is forced to fight the Mana Goddess, and after winning a Sproutling plants itself in the Mana Tree&#x27;s rotten trunk. Calling upon the other Sproutlings to join them, they restore the Mana Tree.

==Development and release==

&quot;Legend of Mana&quot; was directed by &quot;Mana&quot; series creator Koichi Ishii, who had worked on the three previous games in the series. Many of the other developers were new to the series, including producer Akitoshi Kawazu, the director and producer of many games in Square&#x27;s &quot;SaGa&quot; series, and designer Akihiko Matsui, who had been the director for &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;. The game&#x27;s character designs and illustrations were done by Shinichi Kameoka. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, in 2011, stated that although Ishii kept the game tied to previous titles in the series by reusing gameplay elements, Kawazu had a heavy influence on the gameplay design of the game.

&quot;Legend of Mana&quot; was designed as a 2D game, despite the PlayStation&#x27;s 3D-focus, as the console could not handle the full 3D world Ishii envisioned where one could interact with natural shaped objects. Kawazu initially let Ishii have a relaxed schedule and budget, as Ishii had a great number of ideas he wanted in the game, but when the project began to get out of control and out of time Kawazu tightened down the rest of the development schedule and convinced the Square executives to delay the game by two months—even though it had already been announced to the public—to allow it to be completed as Ishii envisioned. Content such as numerous character sprites and item game mechanics had to be scrapped for the sake of fitting the whole game on one CD-ROM. Kawazu has said that this experience taught him that his true skill in game development lay in working as a producer.

&quot;Legend of Mana&quot; was first announced by Square in March 1999 just before its debut at the Tokyo Game Show. The game was released in Japan in July 1999 with considerable hype, packaged with demos of Square&#x27;s future releases &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;, &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;, &quot;Front Mission 3&quot;, and &quot;Threads of Fate&quot;. It was planned to be released in North America alongside the July and August 2000 releases of &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; and &quot;Threads of Fate&quot;, but was instead released early on June 6.

===Music===


The original score for &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; was composed, arranged, and produced by Yoko Shimomura. Shimomura was a newcomer to the series; the previous two &quot;Mana&quot; games were scored by Hiroki Kikuta, and the first by Kenji Ito. Shimomura said in 2002 that she considered the soundtrack to &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; to be the one that best expresses herself. She claims that she prefers &quot;passionate music that comes from the heart&quot;, and that she has to &quot;feel the emotions of a piece in the extreme before I am able to write&quot; the music by putting herself in the same mood as the piece is supposed to be in. &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; featured the first vocal track of any &quot;Mana&quot; game, &quot;Song of Mana&quot;, which also serves as the game&#x27;s opening theme. It was sung by Swedish vocalist Annika Ljungberg, who was chosen by Shimomura because she &quot;wanted to stay away from working with someone popular that everyone already knows&quot;. After hearing a sample of Ljungberg&#x27;s music, she flew to Sweden &quot;straight away&quot; to do an analog recording of the song.

The 1999 soundtrack album &quot;Seiken Densetsu / Legend of Mana Original Soundtrack&quot; collects 55 tracks of music from &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; on two discs. The music covers many styles including piano, hard rock, and electronic music. The soundtrack was published by DigiCube, and was reprinted by Square Enix in 2004. The album reached #65 on the Japanese Oricon music charts and stayed on the charts for two weeks. &quot;Song of Mana&quot; was later made available on the &quot;Square Vocal Collection&quot; album in 2001. Four of the game&#x27;s tracks were released as part of &quot;Drammatica: The Very Best Works of Yoko Shimomura&quot;, an album of arrangements highlighting the composer&#x27;s work.

===Merchandise===
Upon the game&#x27;s Japanese release, several promotional items were made available from Square, including stuffed toy dolls of the rabite enemy and mascot of the series, a necklace, and lighters. As a promotion for Square&#x27;s &quot;Summer of Adventure&quot; release schedule in 2000, which the North American release of the game was a part of, those who preordered the game were given a free music CD with select tracks from the game. &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; was re-released in Japan late in 2000 as part of the Square Millennium Collection at a budget price along with a special music box and two character figurines. A companion book titled &quot;Seiken Densetsu: Legend of Mana Ultimania&quot; including artwork and interviews was released as part of Square&#x27;s &quot;Ultimania&quot; series. It was published by DigiCube in 1999 and later reprinted by Square Enix in 2004 after the subsidiary&#x27;s closing. An artbook, &quot;Legend of Mana: Making of Mana&quot;, was published in 2000 by ASCII. A five-volume manga series, created by Shiro Amano, was published between 2000 and 2002.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; was a bestseller at the time of release, and sold over 400,000 units in its first week alone as the highest-selling release that week in Japan. By the end of the year, it had sold over 700,000 copies in Japan. &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; was also the top selling PlayStation game during the week of its release in North America.

&quot;Legend of Mana&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. The game&#x27;s presentation was almost universally praised, especially its use of vibrant and colorful hand-drawn graphics. David Smith of IGN claimed that the graphics were one of the game&#x27;s best points, and RPGamer&#x27;s Andrew P. Bilyk noted that the visuals &quot;may be the most impressive two-dimensional graphics ever to grace an RPG&quot;. Andrew Pfister of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; praised them even more, calling them &quot;the most impressive 2D artwork ever seen on a console&quot;. Damian Thomas&#x27;s RPGFan review likened the graphics to Disney animation for having &quot;a very storybook, cutesy cartoony feel to them&quot;, while Andrew Vestal of GameSpot said that the graphics were some of the most lush and ornate 2D graphics ever made. The game won an award for best graphics at the 4th Japan Game Awards from the Computer Entertainment Supplier&#x27;s Association. The music in &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; was also a high point in many reviews; the reviewers for &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; called it &quot;fantastic&quot; and &quot;wonderful&quot;. Smith of IGN&#x27;s review stated that the soundtrack is &quot;as good as any you&#x27;ll hear today&quot; with a good mix of intensity, suspense, and subtle nuance, and Vestal of GameSpot termed it &quot;excellently orchestrated&quot; and a perfect fit for the game in each environment.

Much of the game&#x27;s criticism stemmed from its substitution of mostly unrelated quests over a main storyline. &quot;GamePro&quot;, while praising the Land Make system, found that the &quot;focus of &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; is obscured by the over-abundance of subplots&quot;. Similarly, Game Revolution&#x27;s Johnny Liu commented that the game lacked depth and felt like a collection of short quests rather than a single game, while Vestal of GameSpot noted that the game&#x27;s use of miniquests will likely disappoint those seeking an action-RPG classic, and said that, although fun, the gameplay had a &quot;schizophrenic and disjointed nature&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; agreed, saying that the Land Make system was an &quot;innovative feature&quot; but that it left the game disjointed without a solid plot to keep everything together. The Japanese &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot; reviewers felt that the system was ambitious, but left the game feeling disconnected, and that the divided plotlines kept the beginning of the game from having the charm of the end.

Gary Steinman of &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; said that the lack of a plotline gave the player no incentive to keep playing through what he felt was a poor combat system. Both of those criticisms were repeated by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s Sam Kennedy in his review. RPGamer&#x27;s Bilyk felt that the smaller plots, while sometimes simplistic and not focused on the player, were enjoyable experiences. IGN&#x27;s Smith concluded that while he enjoyed the game, he felt that it was not a complete game like &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;, but instead a collection of fun experiences.

===Legacy===
In November 2000, &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; was ranked number 48 on &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot;″s list of top 100 PlayStation games of all time. The game was re-released on February 21, 2002, as part of the PSone Books best-sellers series in Japan, in 2006 as part of Square Enix&#x27;s Ultimate Hits collection, and re-released on the PlayStation 3 PlayStation Network store as part of the PSone Classics series on March 22, 2011. A remastered version was released on June 24, 2021, for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PC. This version of the game was later released for Android and iOS on December 7, 2021. An anime adaptation by Yokohama Animation Laboratory and Graphinica titled &quot;Legend of Mana: The Teardrop Crystal&quot; aired from October to December 2022. The series premiered in October 2022.
