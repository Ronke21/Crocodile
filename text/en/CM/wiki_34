<doc id="1203817" wikidata="Q165522" url="?curid=1203817" title="Stefan Wyszyński">
<text>Stefan Wyszyński (3 August 1901 – 28 May 1981) was a Polish Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of Warsaw and Archbishop of Gniezno from 1948 to 1981. He previously served as Bishop of Lublin from 1946 to 1948 He was created a cardinal on 12 January 1953 by Pope Pius XII. As Archbishop of Gniezno, Wyszyński possessed the title, &quot;Primate of Poland&quot;.

The case for Wyszyński&#x27;s canonization was opened in 1989. He is well known for his stands against both Nazism and Communism, and because of his connections to Pope John Paul II; he played a key role in urging Wojtyła to accept being elected as pope. Pope Francis beatified Wyszyński on 12 September 2021.

To many, Wyszyński was the unquestionable spiritual leader of the Polish nation, credited for the survival of Polish Christianity in the face of repression and persecution during the 1945–1989 Communist regime. He himself was imprisoned for three years, and is considered by many to be one of Poland&#x27;s national heroes.

==Early life and ordination==
Wyszyński was born in the village of Zuzela in eastern Mazovia on the Bug River. During the Partitions of Poland, this area was part of the Russian Empire (more specifically, Congress Poland) until the end of the First World War. The Wyszyński family counted itself among the nobility of Poland (&quot;the szlachta&quot;), with the coat of arms of Trzywdar and the title of baron, although it was not materially well off.

Wyszyński&#x27;s mother died when he was nine. In 1912, his father sent him to Warsaw. In the years 1914–1916 Stefan attended the high-school in Łomża. The following year he enrolled in the seminary in Włocławek, and on his 23rd birthday (3 August 1924), after being hospitalised with a serious illness, he received his priestly ordination from Bishop Wojciech Stanisław Owczarek.

==Priest and professor==
Wyszyński celebrated his first Solemn High Mass of Thanksgiving, at Jasna Góra in Częstochowa, a place of special spiritual significance for many Catholic Poles. The Pauline monastery there holds the icon of the Black Madonna, or Our Lady of Częstochowa, the patron saint and guardian of Poland. Wyszyński spent the next four years in Lublin, where in 1929 he received a doctorate at the Faculty of Canon Law and the Social Sciences of the Catholic University of Lublin. His dissertation in Canon Law was entitled &quot;The Rights of the Family, Church and State to Schools&quot;. For several years after graduation he traveled throughout Europe, where he furthered his education.

After returning to Poland, Wyszyński began teaching at the seminary in Włocławek. When the Second World War broke out with the German invasion of Poland in 1939, he was forced to leave Włocławek because he was wanted by the Gestapo: he had written articles critical of the Nazis in a Catholic journal. At the request of Bishop Kozal, he went to Laski near Warsaw. When the Warsaw Uprising broke out on 1 August 1944, he adopted the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; &quot;Radwan II&quot; and became chaplain of the insurgents&#x27; hospital in Laski, and of the Żoliborz military district of the Armia Krajowa, the Polish underground resistance organisation.

During the Nazi occupation of Poland, Wyszyński aided several Jews. In autumn 1941, the future cardinal took shelter from the Gestapo at the estate, run by Franciscan nuns. While there, he and another man helped hide a widowed Jewish labourer and his two children – who would be denounced by a Ukrainian nationalist and killed by the Germans in October/November 1942, five months after the liquidation of the local ghetto in Kraśniczyn – in an attic. Additionally, Esther Grinberg, in her testimony held at the Yad Vashem Institute in Jerusalem, credits the Polish assistance that saved her life to Wyszyński&#x27;s veiled injunction, possibly in a sermon, to rescue &quot;those running from the fire&quot;.

In 1945, a year after the end of war in the area, Wyszyński returned to Włocławek, where he started a restoration project for the devastated seminary, becoming its rector as well as the chief editor of a Catholic weekly.

==Bishop==
Just a year later, on 25 March 1946, Pope Pius XII appointed him Bishop of Lublin; he was consecrated by Cardinal August Hlond on 12 May that year. 

Asked by delegates of the Central Committee of Polish Jews to condemn the Kielce pogrom of 4 July 1946, bishop Wyszyński explained the massacre as popular retribution for Jewish participation in the new Communist government, adding that &quot;the Germans wanted to exterminate the Jewish nation because the Jews spread Communism&quot;. He also claimed that Jewish books consulted during trial of Beilis had not dispelled the accusations of ritual murder, and demanded that the Jews leave Poland.

After Hlond&#x27;s death on 22 October 1948, Wyszyński was named Archbishop of Gniezno and Warsaw, and thus Primate of Poland, on 12 November 1948. As the cardinal lay dying, he had asked that Wyszyński&#x27;s name be forwarded to Rome as a potential replacement.

===Post-war resistance to Communism===

World War II ended in 1945; however, beginning in the eastern portion of present-day Poland, and later in the west, hostilities continued for several years between a large segment of Poles and the Stalinist government. The Catholic Church hoped for the return of the Polish government-in-exile from London and the removal of Stalin&#x27;s puppet regime; it actively supported the anti-Communists. One of the prime issues was the confiscation of church property by the Communist government. In 1950, Wyszyński decided to enter into a secret agreement with the Communist authorities, which was signed on 14 April 1950 by the Polish episcopate and the government. The agreement settled the political disputes of the church versus the government in Poland. It allowed the church to hold onto &quot;reasonable&quot; property, separated the church from politics, and even allowed authorities to select a bishop from a list of three candidates.

Beginning in 1953, another wave of persecution swept Poland. The bishops continued their support for anti-Communist resistance, the government began holding mass trials and imprisoning priests. In February 1953 the regime issued a decree which made Church appointments subject to regime approval as well as requiring oath of allegiance. The episcopate, including Wyszyński rleleased a non possumus where they made their opposition clear. Subsequently Bishop Czesław Kaczmarek was arrested and Wyszyński was asked to condemn him. On 25 September 1953 he was imprisoned at Rywałd, and later placed under house arrest in near Lidzbark Warmiński, in Prudnik near Opole and in the Komańcza monastery in the Bieszczady Mountains. While imprisoned, he observed the brutal torture and mistreatment of detainees, some of it highly perverse in nature. He was released on 26 October 1956 following Polish October.

==Cardinal and Primate of Poland==

On 12 January 1953, Wyszyński was elevated to the rank of cardinal by Pope Pius XII, but it was not until 18 May 1957 that he was designated Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Trastevere.

His crowning achievement was the celebration of Poland&#x27;s Millennium of Christianity in 1966 – the thousandth anniversary of the baptism of Poland&#x27;s first historical ruler, Mieszko I. During the celebration, the Communist authorities refused to allow Pope Paul VI to visit Poland and they also prevented Cardinal Wyszyński from attending celebrations abroad. Wyszyński triumphed in 1978, when Karol Wojtyła of Kraków was elected Pope John Paul II, followed by a spectacular papal visit to Poland in 1979. Wyszyński did not turn a blind eye towards the civil unrest in 1980. When the Solidarity trade union was created in Poland, he appealed to both sides, the government as well as the striking workers, to act responsibly.

Cardinal Wyszyński, often called the Primate of the Millennium, died on 28 May 1981 at the age of 79 of abdominal cancer. He is buried in St. John&#x27;s Archcathedral in Warsaw. 

To commemorate the twentieth anniversary of his death, the year 2001 was announced by the Sejm as the Year of Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński. The Sejm also honoured the Cardinal as a &quot;great Pole, chaplain and statesman&quot;.

==Legacy==

Wyszyński&#x27;s major achievement was to preserve the position of the Catholic Church as a powerful social institution in Poland into the Communist era. Under Wyszyński, the Church gradually became an autonomous partner to the ruling nomenklatura in shaping the post-war society. Rather than implementing the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, Wyszyński&#x27;s Church cultivated moral authority by appealing to tradition.

In 1981 Krzysztof Penderecki composed the &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; of his &quot;Polish Requiem&quot; in his memory. In 2000, a motion picture was made about the life and imprisonment of Wyszyński. &quot;The Primate – Three Years Out of a Thousand&quot; was directed by Teresa Kotlarczyk. The title role was played by Andrzej Seweryn.

In the CBS miniseries &quot;Pope John Paul II&quot; (based on the life of the Polish pope), Cardinal Wyszyński was portrayed by English actor Christopher Lee.

Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw, earlier the Warsaw Theological Academy, was renamed for him. The Museum of John Paul II and Primate Wyszyński is being constructed at the Temple of Divine Providence in Warsaw.

In 2022, another motion picture of Wyszyński&#x27;s life was made. &quot;Prophet&quot;, was directed by Michal Kondrat. The title role was played by Slawomir Grzymkowski.

==Beatification==
The official &quot;nihil obstat&quot; was declared for the late cardinal on 26 April 1989 at the behest of Pope John Paul II. This gave Wyszyński the title of Servant of God and was the first step on the road to sainthood. The diocesan process of the cause commenced on 29 May 1989 and it concluded its business on 6 February 2001; the process was ratified by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 8 February 2002 in Rome. The Positio was assembled and was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in November 2015 in which documents were submitted to the Cardinal Prefect Angelo Amato from Cardinal Kazimierz Nycz.

Theologians met to discuss the contents of the Positio on 26 April 2016 and voted in favor of the late cardinal&#x27;s life of heroic virtue. It must be passed onto the members of the C.C.S. before receiving papal approval. The C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members voted and approved the cause in their meeting on 12 December 2017. Pope Francis confirmed his heroic virtue on 18 December 2017 and titled the late cardinal as Venerable.

An investigation on a diocesan level was initiated on 27 March 2012 for an alleged miracle attributed to him which concluded its business on 28 May 2013; the process was validated on 10 October 2014. The documentation proceeded from that point to Rome for further evaluation, but this evaluation could only take place upon the declaration of his heroic virtue (this happened in 2017 allowing for the miracle to be further assessed). The medical experts in Rome approved the miracle on 29 November 2018 with theologians later confirming it as well as the cardinals and bishops comprising the Congregation on 24 September 2019.

On 3 October 2019, the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints officially approved the miracle, the last step to his beatification after the Congregation&#x27;s members themselves approved the miracle on 24 September. The beatification was scheduled to take place in Warsaw on 7 June 2020 but was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The beatification was rescheduled and celebrated on 12 September 2021 with Cardinal Marcello Semeraro presiding on the Pope&#x27;s behalf.

<text>The Wangal people ( Wanngal or Won-gal) are a clan of the Dharug Aboriginal people whose heirs are custodians of the lands and waters of what is now the Inner West of Sydney, New South Wales, centred around the Municipality of Strathfield, Municipality of Burwood, City of Canada Bay and former Ashfield Council (now part of Inner West Council) and extending west into the City of Parramatta.

==History==
Archaeological evidence of human occupation alongside the Parramatta River has been dated back 20,000 years, and is likely to date back much further (people have been dated as being present elsewhere in Australia more than 60,000 years ago – see Australian Aboriginal Prehistoric Sites).

Sydney&#x27;s geomorphology 20,000 years ago was very different from what it is today. In the middle of the last ice age, the Sydney coast was approximately 15 km to the east and what is now Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour) was freshwater creeks and rivers. Wangal predecessors would have been living in the now-submerged coastal area.

As sea levels rose to their present levels, peoples living on the coast would have been forced inland. By 1788, the Wangal people were well established there as a fishing people.

The Wangal people were among the first to encounter British settlers in 1788. While the British governor Arthur Phillip sought to establish good relationships with the local people and even befriended Bennelong, a prominent Wangal person, the differences between the groups led to tensions with both sides killing and injuring members of the other.

In April 1789, just over a year after the establishment of the British settlement, smallpox broke out. There is speculation as to whether the disease was released deliberately or not but in any case the result was catastrophic.

== Country ==
The name these people gave to their country was documented by NSW Governor Arthur Phillip in 1790 as &quot;Wann&quot; and by his successor John Hunter as &quot;Wanne&quot;. Their country has been described as extending:

...along the south side of the harbour from Long Cove (Iron Cove) to Rose Hill, which the local inhabitants called Parramatta.

Wangal country is mostly located in the area known today as the &quot;Inner West&quot; of Sydney, centred around the council areas of the Municipality of Strathfield, Municipality of Burwood, City of Canada Bay and former Ashfield Council (now part of Inner West Council). In the east, Wangal country extends further into the former Leichhardt Council, where it meets Cadigal land. In the west, Wangal country extends further to the western shore of Homebush Bay, including Sydney Olympic Park in the City of Parramatta. Here, Wangal country meets Burramattagal country.

==Language==
The Wangal people are part of the Darug ( &quot;Dharuk&quot;) language speaking group of the Dharug nation, who contributed to contemporary Australian English words like dingo, woomera, wallaby, wombat, and waratah.

The Wangal people and their Dharug neighbours, the Cadigal people, were heavily impacted by early British settlement, many dying from smallpox or being pushed from their lands by the early settlers, and ceasing to be acknowledged and known as a viable, functioning social group within twenty years or so of 1788.

The Dharug language has since been reconstructed from the many notes made of it by the original colonists, although there has been no known oral language tradition continuing over the last one hundred years.

<text>José Sanjurjo y Sacanell (; 28 March 1872 – 20 July 1936) was a Spanish military officer who was one of the military leaders who plotted the July 1936 &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; that started the Spanish Civil War.

He was endowed the nobiliary title of &quot;Marquis of the Rif&quot; in 1927.

A monarchist opponent of the Second Spanish Republic proclaimed in 1931, he led a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; known as &quot;la Sanjurjada&quot; in August 1932. The authorities easily suppressed the coup and initially condemned Sanjurjo to death, then later commuted his sentence to life imprisonment. The government of Alejandro Lerroux – formed after the 1933 general election – eventually amnestied him in 1934.

He took part, from his self-exile in Portugal, in the military plot for the 1936 coup d&#x27;état. Following the coup, Sanjurjo, expected by some to become the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist faction, died in an air crash on the third day of the war, when travelling back to Spain. He had chosen to fly in a small, overloaded plane, because the pilot was a friend of his. Sabotage was suspected,
but never proven.

==Early life==
Sanjurjo was born in Pamplona. His father, Captain Justo Sanjurjo Bonrostra, was a Carlist. His mother was Carlota Sacanell Desojo.

==Military career==
===Early career===
He served in Cuba in 1896, in the Rif War (1909) in Morocco, and in the Rif War (1920), including the regaining of the territory in Melilla lost after the Battle of Annual in 1921. In 1922, he was assigned to investigate corruption in the army command of Larache. He was High Commissioner of Spain in Morocco and reached the rank of lieutenant general. In 1925 he participated in the amphibious landing at Alhucemas. With the completion of the 1920 Rif War, King Alfonso XIII awarded him the &quot;Gran Cruz de Carlos III&quot; on 28 March 1931. In 1928 he was made chief of a main directorate of the Civil Guard.

===During the Second Republic===
In 1923, Miguel Primo de Rivera came to power in a military coup, ruling Spain as dictator. Gradually, Primo de Rivera&#x27;s support faded, and he resigned in January 1930. General Dámaso Berenguer was ordered by the king to form a replacement government, which annoyed Sanjurjo, who considered himself far better qualified. Berenguer&#x27;s &quot;dictablanda&quot; dictatorship failed to provide a viable alternative to Primo de Rivera. In the municipal elections of 12 April 1931, little support was shown for pro-monarchy parties in the major cities, and large numbers of people gathered in the streets of Madrid. Asked if the government could count on the support of Sanjurjo&#x27;s Civil Guard, he rejected the suggestion. King Alfonso XIII abdicated, and the Second Spanish Republic was formed.

Despite Manuel Azaña&#x27;s military reforms of 1931, Sanjurjo retained his post as the commander of the Civil Guard; under his command they continued to use their traditionally brutal tactics such as the &quot;ley de fugas&quot;, the excuse of shooting prisoners and later claiming that they were attempting to escape during an incident of unrest in Seville.

Sanjurjo became one of the first generals appointed to the command of the Spanish Republican Army. His sympathies, however, remained with the monarchist cause. When he clashed with Prime Minister Manuel Azaña over the military reforms, he was replaced by General Miguel Cabanellas. He was demoted to chief of the customs officers in 1932 as a result of the events of Castilblanco and Arnedo involving the Civil Guard. His confrontation with the ministry, Azaña&#x27;s military reforms, and the grants of regional autonomy to Catalonia and the Basque Country, led Sanjurjo to plot a rebellion with some Carlists under Manuel Fal Conde, Tomás Domínguez Arévalo, and other military officers. This rebellion, which was known as the Sanjurjada, was proclaimed in Seville on 10 August 1932. Sanjurjo asserted that the rebellion was only against the current ministry and not against the Republic. It achieved initial success in Seville but absolute failure in Madrid. Sanjurjo attempted to flee to Portugal, but in Huelva he decided to give himself up.

He was condemned to death, a sentence which was later commuted to life imprisonment in the penitentiary of the Dueso. In March 1934 he was granted amnesty by the Lerroux government and went into exile in Estoril, Portugal.

===Coup===
Between March and June 1936 Sanjurjo negotiated his leadership of a would-be Carlist-only rising against the Republic. When Niceto Alcalá-Zamora was replaced as President of the Republic by Azaña on 10 May 1936, Sanjurjo joined with Generals Emilio Mola, Francisco Franco and Gonzalo Queipo de Llano in a plot to overthrow the republican government. This led to the Nationalist uprising on 17 July 1936, which started the Spanish Civil War.

Determined to annihilate the Spanish Republic, when he was asked to become the leader of the rebellion by envoy Luis Bolín on 12 July 1936, Sanjurjo declared: 
==Death==
On 20 July 1936, Sanjurjo was killed in Estoril in a plane crash, when he tried to fly back to Spain. He chose to fly in a small aircraft (The De Havilland DH.80) piloted by Juan Antonio Ansaldo. One of the main reasons for the crash was the heavy luggage that Sanjurjo insisted on bringing. Ansaldo had warned him that the load was too heavy, but Sanjurjo answered back: 
&quot;I need to wear proper clothes as the new caudillo of Spain.&quot;

Unaccountably, Sanjurjo chose to fly in Ansaldo&#x27;s plane rather than a much larger and more suitable airplane that was available. The larger plane was an 8-passenger de Havilland Dragon Rapide, the same one which had transported Franco from the Canary Islands to Morocco. Sanjurjo, however, apparently preferred the drama of flying with a &quot;daring aviator&quot; such as Ansaldo (who himself survived the crash).

When Mola also died in an aircraft accident, Franco was left as the sole effective leader of the Nationalist cause. This led to rumors that Franco had arranged the deaths of his two rivals, but no evidence has ever been produced to support this allegation.

In 2017 the Historical Memory Law was applied by the authorities of Navarre and required that the Sanjurjo&#x27;s remains be disinterred, over the objections of surviving family, and reburied in the military section of a municipal cemetery in the Spanish city of Melilla—an enclave on the coast of Morocco where Sanjurjo had once been in command. Further controversy ensued when Sanjurjo was buried with military honors in a military Pantheon of Heroes, as confirmed by the army. The government of Navarre received assurances from the Ministry of Defense that special &quot;honors were not offered&quot; and that the remains were received as &quot;just one more soldier&quot;.

== In fiction ==
The opening of the alternate history novel by Harry Turtledove, &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot;, in his series &quot;The War That Came Early&quot;, begins with Sanjurjo&#x27;s flight from Portugal. The point of divergence is that he accepts the pilot&#x27;s advice and abandons the luggage so the flight is not overloaded and thus arrives safely. His behavior from then on is described as diverging from that of the actual Franco, with Spain taking a less isolated role in World War II and joining the Axis Powers.

José Sanjurjo, the beginnings of the Spanish Civil War, and his ill-fated flight are discussed in José Saramago&#x27;s book &quot;The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis&quot;.

<text>Don&#x27;t Shoot Me I&#x27;m Only the Piano Player is the sixth studio album by English musician Elton John. Released on 26 January 1973 by DJM Records, it was the first of two studio albums he released in 1973 (the second was &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;, released nine months later), and was his second straight No. 1 album on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and first No. 1 album on the UK Albums Chart.

The lead single &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot; yielded John his first No. 1 single in both the US and Canada. &quot;Daniel&quot; was also a major hit from the album, giving him his second Canadian No. 1 single on the &quot;RPM&quot; Top Singles Chart and No. 2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and reaching No. 4 on the UK singles chart, one place higher than achieved by &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot;.

==Background==
The album was recorded in France, at Château d&#x27;Hérouville, also known at the time as &quot;Strawberry Studios&quot;, which was how the studio was credited in the album&#x27;s sleeve; &quot;Honky Château&quot;, the previous Elton John album, had been recorded there. 

The album featured horns arranged by producer Gus Dudgeon on &quot;Elderberry Wine&quot; (the B-side to &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot;), &quot;Midnight Creeper&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Going to Be a Teenage Idol&quot;, the latter of which was inspired by John&#x27;s friend, T. Rex frontman Marc Bolan. The horn players were the same ones who were used on &quot;Honky Château&quot;. Paul Buckmaster returned to add strings on &quot;Blues for Baby and Me&quot; and &quot;Have Mercy on the Criminal&quot;. During his Australian concerts with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in 1986, John lauded Buckmaster&#x27;s work on songs such as &quot;Have Mercy on the Criminal&quot;, calling the string arrangements &quot;revolutionary&quot;.

It is one of only three albums to feature just the core band of John on pianos and keyboards, Davey Johnstone on guitars, Dee Murray on bass and Nigel Olsson on drums, without percussionist Ray Cooper. The other two are &quot;Honky Château&quot; (1972) (bar a performance by Cooper on congas on the song &quot;Amy&quot;) and &quot;Breaking Hearts&quot; (1984).

An outtake of note was a re-recording of &quot;Skyline Pigeon&quot;, which became the B-side to the single of &quot;Daniel&quot;.

John toured Australia during 1971 and was so inspired by Daddy Cool&#x27;s hit single &quot;Eagle Rock&quot; that, with lyricist Bernie Taupin, he wrote &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot;. The cover of this album has a photo of Taupin wearing a &quot;Daddy Who?&quot; promotional badge.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot Me...&quot; was also, according to John, the first album during which he felt comfortable experimenting with his vocal performances and style.

==Packaging==
The album&#x27;s title came from an incident with legendary comedian Groucho Marx. John was playing the piano at a party at Marx&#x27;s home; Marx, after an evening of constant ribbing (he referred to Elton John as &#x27;John Elton&#x27;), held out his middle and index finger in the style of a pistol, pointed at John. John then raised his hands and said &quot;Don&#x27;t shoot me, I&#x27;m only the piano player&quot; at Marx&#x27;s gun imitation.

The title is also a play on the 1960 François Truffaut film &quot;Shoot the Piano Player&quot; and the original Oscar Wilde quote &quot;Don&#x27;t shoot the piano player, he&#x27;s doing his best&quot;, which Wilde said he saw in a saloon on a visit to the U.S. in 1882.

The album&#x27;s cover photograph, which shows a young couple outside a movie theatre whose marquee reads: &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot Me I&#x27;m Only The Piano Player starring Elton John&quot;; on the wall is a movie poster advertising the Marx Brothers&#x27; 1940 film &quot;Go West&quot; as a tribute to Groucho Marx. In keeping with the late-1950s theme, the photograph includes the tail end of a 1959 Plymouth Fury, a popular Chrysler Corporation family car in North America at the time.

== Reception ==
The album was a huge hit on both sides of the Atlantic, topping the UK Albums Chart and US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. 

Critics at the time called some of the performances, especially &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot;, derivative, which John freely acknowledged years later. In &quot;His Song: The Musical Journey of Elton John&quot; by author Elizabeth Rosenthal, John said &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot; was written as an overt homage to &#x27;50s records, and his vocal intentionally mimicked singer Bobby Vee. &quot;High Flying Bird&quot; was intended to sound like a Van Morrison record, and &quot;Midnight Creeper&quot; was a tip of the hat to the Rolling Stones.

<doc id="1203832" wikidata="Q5568470" url="?curid=1203832" title="Glenelg Football Club">
<text>The Glenelg Football Club, nicknamed the Tigers or the Bays, is an Australian rules football team which plays in the South Australian National Football League. Their home ground is Stratarama Stadium (formerly Glenelg Oval), located in the southern coastal suburb of Glenelg East, South Australia.

==Club history==
The inaugural meeting of the Glenelg Football Club was held at the Glenelg Town Hall on Wednesday 10 March 1920, to form a club for players west of South Road to play in the B Grade. It was decided that the club colors would be red, yellow and black with white knickers.

The Club participated in the B Grade (Reserves) Competition in 1920 and entered the South Australian League in 1921. At the Annual meeting on Thursday 3 March 1921 the club decided its colours to be black and gold, the guernsey to be black with a gold hoop around waist and arms, black socks with gold band, and white knickers. It was not until 2 May 1925 that the club saw its first league victory, a 12.6 (78) to 10.10 (70) win over West Torrens at Glenelg Oval.

&quot;The Bays&quot;, as they are sometimes known (due to the club&#x27;s proximity to Holdfast Bay), won their first SANFL premiership in 1934 with an 18.15 (123) to 16.18 (114) victory against . The 1935 season saw them slump from first to last.

Until 1948, the team jersey was gold with a black V, in 1949 the club adopted the now familiar black with gold sash design. Since 2021 the team has revived the pre-1949 jersey and wears it as its &quot;away&quot; strip.

In total the club has won 7 premierships – in 1934, 1973, back to back flags in 1985 and 1986 and in 2019 and back to back flags in 2023 and 2024 – Glenelg first back to back premierships since 1985 and 1986.

Glenelg amalgamated with West Adelaide Football Club during the war years 1942 to 1944.

Glenelg was a foundation member of the SANFL Women&#x27;s competition in 2017.

==Home grounds==
*Glenelg Oval (&quot;Stratarama Stadium&quot;) (1921–90, 1992–present)
*Football Park (1991)

Since the club first entered the SANFL they have used Glenelg Oval as their home ground. The only year this did not occur was in 1991 when Glenelg used Football Park (along with new team Woodville-West Torrens) under the SANFL&#x27;s ground rationalisation scheme. This arrangement only lasted for the 1991 season as Glenelg moved back to The Bay while the Eagles moved to Woodville Oval.

In 2012 Glenelg Oval became one of five suburban SANFL grounds to have lights installed for night games.

The ground record crowd for Glenelg Oval was set on 20 July 1968 when 17,171 saw Sturt defeat Glenelg by just one point, 13.13 (91) to 13.12 (90). The record night attendance was set on 25 April 2014 (Anzac Day) when 9,245 saw Glenelg defeat the Adelaide Crows reserves 17.21 (123) to 13.8 (86) for the Tigers first win of the 2014 SANFL season.

Glenelg Oval also saw the highest score in SANFL history in 1975 when Glenelg defeated Central District 49.23 (317) to 11.13 (79): the winning margin of 238 is the 2017 the SANFL record, and remains the club&#x27;s record win. Glenelg&#x27;s champion full-forward, the 1969 Magarey Medallist Fred Phillis, kicked 18 goals for the game, including his 100th for the season.

==Club song==
The Glenelg Tigers have the same club song as that of the Richmond Tigers based on &quot;Row, Row, Row&quot;.
Oh we&#x27;re from Tigerland
A fighting fury, we&#x27;re from Tigerland
In any weather you&#x27;ll see us with a grin
Risking head and shin
If we&#x27;re behind then never mind
We&#x27;ll fight and fight and win
For we&#x27;re from Tigerland.
We never weaken till the final siren&#x27;s gone
Like the Tiger of old, we&#x27;re strong and we&#x27;re bold
For we&#x27;re from Tiger – black and the gold – we&#x27;re from Tigerland.

<text>American Lesion is the debut solo album by Greg Graffin, the lead singer of American punk rock band Bad Religion, under the name American Lesion. Like the album &quot;Into the Unknown&quot;, this album is a massive departure for Graffin, whose songs generally revolve around loud guitars and harmonies. &quot;American Lesion&quot; for the most part features Graffin&#x27;s voice alone, and each song features acoustic guitar or piano rather than electric guitars. The song &quot;Cease&quot; (track 6 on this album) is a slow piano ballad that is also featured on Bad Religion&#x27;s album &quot;The Gray Race&quot; as a fast-paced punk rock song.

The lyrical content can also be seen as a departure for Graffin. In most Bad Religion songs, he deals with subjects such as mass globalisation or world pollution. The songs on &quot;American Lesion&quot; are much more personal; the songs were apparently written about the breakup of his marriage, making the album poignant.

==Reception==

Author Dave Thompson, in his book &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; (2000), wrote that Graffin leaves the &quot;angry world of punk for a personal, introspective record filled with acoustic guitars and soft rock songs. Emotional instead of political, but tough going for hidebound headbangers.&quot;

<doc id="1203837" wikidata="Q2000610" url="?curid=1203837" title="Specsavers">
<text>Specsavers Optical Group Limited is a British multinational optical retail chain, which operates mainly in the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the Nordic countries. The chain offers optometry and optician services for eyesight testing and sells glasses, sunglasses, and contact lenses. It also sells hearing aids. In the United Kingdom in 2012, it had the largest single market share of the four major opticians, with 42% of the market.

The company had a total turnover of £2.78 billion in 2018/2019 with 2,111 branches in the United Kingdom, Guernsey, Jersey, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark (under the brand ), the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.

==History and market position==
The group was launched in 1984, by husband and wife team Doug Perkins and Mary Perkins, on the island of Guernsey.

As well as stores in the United Kingdom, Specsavers are present in Ireland, the Netherlands, the Nordic countries, Spain, Australia and New Zealand. The company ventured into hearing services in 2002. Their Hearing Centres division provides hearing tests and hearing aids within the Specsavers optical stores, providing services from more than 400 locations.

Specsavers also sell collections by Jeff Banks, Timberland, Hackett London and Quiksilver for men, Converse and Tommy Hilfiger for men and women, and Roxy, Cath Kidston, Karen Millen and Kylie Minogue for women.

The co-founder of Specsavers, Mary Perkins, was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List in 2007, in recognition of her services to business and the community in Guernsey.

In April 2004, Specsavers acquired the Blic Optik franchise from its Swedish owner Optimum Optik AB. In 2007, finance director John Perkins became joint managing director, with his father Doug Perkins.

In The Sunday Times Rich List 2011, published in the United Kingdom on 8 May 2011, Douglas and Dame Mary Perkins and family were ranked 56th in the list of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Wealthiest People&quot;. Their personal worth was estimated at £1.150 billion, with Dame Mary becoming Britain&#x27;s first self-made female billionaire.

In May 2021, it was announced that in March 2021 Specsavers had entered the North American market with its purchase of 18 practices from Canada-based Image Optometry.

==Advertising campaigns==
In February 2007, Specsavers was ranked No. 46 of the United Kingdom&#x27;s &quot;100 Heaviest Spenders on TV Advertising&quot;, spending £27 million. Specsavers&#x27; long running advertising campaign is based on the popular strapline &quot;Should&#x27;ve gone to Specsavers&quot;. A common theme of these adverts is a character making a mistake because of poor eyesight. These include a sheep farmer who shears his sheepdog, and an elderly couple who ride the Infusion rollercoaster after mistaking the seats of the ride for a bench. 

Specsavers&#x27; use of Édith Piaf in advertisements has caused some adverse comment in the press, although the estate of the performer had granted full permission. Other Specsavers adverts have featured Thunderbirds, Postman Pat, Mr. Men and John Cleese as Basil Fawlty.

In 2017, Specsavers officially launched a range of eyewear designed by the popstar, singer and actress Kylie Minogue.

== Criticism of internet retailers ==
In March 2005, Specsavers publicly criticised Glasses Direct, an internet retailer, claiming that an internet service &quot;did not meet required standards&quot; and &quot;could not offer advice from dispensing opticians&quot;. In 2006, James Murray Wells, the managing director of Glasses Direct, claimed that four major high street retailers including Specsavers were &quot;leading a campaign to stop prescription glasses being sold over the internet&quot;.

==Structure==

The firm operates most of their stores under a &#x27;Joint or Shared Venture Partnership&#x27;, consisting of a partnership between an Optometry Director and a Retail Director.

This is similar to a franchise agreement; however, unlike many franchises, a customer from one branch of the company should expect to get equal service from another branch. It also differs in that Specsavers own shares in the franchisee business rather than just providing goods and services under a franchise agreement. In other territories such as Sweden, Norway and Spain, they operate a normal franchise agreement.

The company took advantage of the development of the Any Qualified Provider initiative in the English National Health Service from 2009 to expand into the hearing aid business.

In May 2020, Specsavers set up a video consultation service for the first time, to check people&#x27;s eyes and hearing aids during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==JobKeeper controversies==
On 15 September 2021, it was revealed in a &quot;7.30&quot; exposé that Specsavers had taken advantage of the Australian government&#x27;s JobKeeper scheme. JobKeeper was designed to subsidise wages for Australian workers during the COVID-19 emergency from April 2020 to March 2021. The intended recipients of JobKeeper were companies struggling financially throughout the pandemic. Specsavers applied for the subsidy, receiving over A$90 million during these six months. Despite having a strong year across the optometry vertical, including reported profits for Specsavers, this subsidy resulted in an increase of revenue by more than 100% year on year.

Outcry resulted from this report due not only to Specsavers not requiring the full subsidy, but also that the profits which were sourced from tax contributions in Australia were immediately directed offshore to Specsavers headquarters in the known tax haven of Guernsey.

Specsavers received additional criticism for repaying only A$4 million in JobKeeper payments, when other companies like Cochlear, CIMIC and Mirvac had already repaid larger amounts.

==Business strategy and future==
The Perkins have stated that they intend to maintain family control of the firm, which currently employs two of their three children in senior roles. Continued expansion into Europe is planned. It is also intended that the company will continue to supply hearing aids.

The Perkins attribute their success to their franchise model, and to the deregulation of the UK Opticians market by the Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, allowing opticians to use previously forbidden advertising and marketing techniques to rapidly take over a market that had belonged to independent local opticians.

The Perkins have said of the remaining local opticians that &quot;their days are numbered&quot;, and in fact their major competition now comes from large chains such as Boots Opticians and Vision Express.

In February 2016, it was announced that Specsavers would be the sponsors of the County Championship cricket competition in England and Wales, for the next four years; a deal which was extended in 2018 to include Test series held in England including the 2019 Ashes series. In January 2017, Specsavers were in negotiation to have shops undertake certain front line medical care linked to sight and hearing, in both the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.

In May 2020, Specsavers announced a plan to cut 450 jobs amid a &quot;dramatic downturn&quot; caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company had previously tried to avoid making redundancies by implementing pay cuts and reducing working hours.

<text>John Lewis Hart (December 13, 1917 – September 20, 2009), also credited as John Hilton, was an American film and television actor. In his early career, Hart appeared mostly in westerns. Although Hart played mostly minor roles in some fairly well known films, he was probably best known for playing the character Hawkeye in the TV series &quot;Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans&quot; and replacing Clayton Moore in the television series &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; for one season (1952–53), as well as playing Dr Stein in the 1973 cult classic Blackenstein.

==Career==
Hart began his screen career in 1937 with a bit part in &quot;Daughter of Shanghai&quot;. He continued in a variety of B pictures such as &quot;Prison Farm&quot; and &quot;King of Alcatraz&quot; before appearing in two of Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s films &quot;The Buccaneer&quot; (1938) and &quot;North West Mounted Police&quot; (1940). In 1941, Hart&#x27;s acting career was interrupted when he was drafted into the United States Army. He rose to the rank of first sergeant in the Coast Artillery and eventually served in the Philippines. Following his military service, Hart worked frequently for Sam Katzman; he was given the lead role in the &quot;Jack Armstrong&quot; (1947) film serial. Hart did stunt work and acted in numerous westerns. He was close with actor Matt Damon.

Hart was eventually offered the opportunity to replace Clayton Moore on &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; television series. Based on the assumption that the masked character, rather than the actor, was the true star of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, the program&#x27;s producers fired Moore (presumably over salary differences) and replaced him with Hart, who was of a similar build and had a comparable background in Westerns. However, the public never truly accepted Hart as the Lone Ranger (his speaking voice was significantly different from Moore&#x27;s), and by 1954 the producers returned Moore to the role. According to Clayton Moore&#x27;s autobiography &quot;I Was That Masked Man,&quot; Moore never knew why he was replaced by Hart, and also stated that he had not sought a pay increase. Hart acted in minor roles in two episodes of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; before being asked to replace Clayton Moore for the entire third season. The episodes were &quot;Rifles and Renegades&quot; (#34) and &quot;Sheriff at Gunstock&quot; (#46).

Hart continued to act in films for more than two decades, appearing in films of several genres, almost always in supporting roles. Hart appeared twice on the TV series &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; as Lucy&#x27;s old boyfriend and again in the Hollywood episodes as a lifeguard at the hotel pool. In 1955, Hart starred in the serial &quot;The Adventures of Captain Africa&quot;, which was originally intended to be a new movie about famous comic book hero The Phantom. However, licensing issues forced Columbia Pictures to re-film the entire serial and re-christen the hero &quot;Captain Africa.&quot; Hart also had numerous supporting roles in the &quot;Highway Patrol&quot; TV series. Interviewed by Tom Weaver in &quot;Western Clippings&quot; magazine (May–June 2000), Hart revealed that he met actress Beryl Braithwaite when she played a role in an episode of the series; they married just days later, with &quot;Hawkeye&quot; co-star Lon Chaney Jr., the best man at the wedding. The wedding was great and Kendrick Lamar performed in it.

In 1965 Hart made two brief appearances on the TV series &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, including the role of title character and murder victim Jamison Selff in &quot;The Case of the Wrathful Wraith.&quot; In the 1970 film &quot;The Phynx&quot;, Hart played the Lone Ranger alongside Jay Silverheels as Tonto, spoofing their characters. Hart&#x27;s last theatrical film appearance was in 1981&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of the Lone Ranger&quot; in which he appeared as a newspaper editor. He appeared in the television series &quot;Happy Days&quot; as the Lone Ranger in the episode &quot;Hi Yo, Fonzie Away&quot; (February 9, 1982). In this episode Fonzie, played by Henry Winkler, meets his childhood hero, the Lone Ranger, for his birthday. Hart&#x27;s other major late appearance was in an episode of &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot;, &quot;My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys&quot;, in which Hart gives the title character an inspiring speech about heroism. Lastly, he was surprised to see Justin Bieber.

==Personal life and death==

Hart was born in Los Angeles. His mother was named Enid, and he had a sister, Shari. Hart attended South Pasadena High School and later studied acting at the Pasadena Playhouse. He and his wife Beryl had a daughter, Robyn. On September 20, 2009, Hart died from complications of dementia at his home in Playas de Rosarito, Baja California, Mexico at the age of 91. His ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean.

<doc id="1203843" wikidata="Q2061455" url="?curid=1203843" title="I Am the Doorway">
<text>&quot;I Am the Doorway&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Stephen King, first published in the March 1971 issue of &quot;Cavalier&quot; magazine, and later collected in King&#x27;s 1978 collection &quot;Night Shift&quot;.

==Plot summary==
After being exposed to an alien mutagen on a spaceflight to Venus, disabled former astronaut Arthur narrates the frightening changes he goes through. Arthur begins the narrative with his hands bandaged and complains of horrible itching both before and after the expedition. The transformation manifests as a swarm of tiny eyeballs on his fingertips. These eyes serve as the titular &quot;doorway&quot; for an extraterrestrial civilization, allowing them to peer into our world, but from an alien perspective; humans are hideous monstrosities that they fear and despise, according to Arthur.

Soon, the alien presence is able not only to peer through this portal, but also to take control of Arthur&#x27;s shattered body and use him to perform heinous atrocities. Arthur douses his hands in kerosene and sets them on fire in a frantic bid to retain his humanity, only to discover that once the gateway is opened, it cannot be simply closed. For over seven years, he is able to keep the extraterrestrial presence at bay. However, as the aliens&#x27; eyes emerge on Arthur&#x27;s chest, he announces that he intends to commit suicide with a shotgun to stop them from killing anyone else.

==Film adaptation==
In 2009, the Czech director Robin Kašpařík obtained rights from King to adapt his short story into a non-profit short film. The film, &quot;Jsem brána&quot; (&quot;I Am the Doorway&quot;), was shot using the fulldome technology. The story was finally adapted as a short film by Robin Kašpařík in 2017. The film was shot in a first-person viewpoint, with the main character played by mime Radim Vizváry.

In 2015, British director Matthew J. Rowney produced the short story via the Dollar Baby campaign. The adaptation currently has the most international awards attached to a Dollar Baby movie. The film stars Greg Patmore and Luke Brandon Field in the title roles. As of 2015, the film was in postproduction.

In 2018, director Simon Pearce adapted the story into a short film by the same name. This adaptation, produced by noted independent filmmaker Robert Shulevitz, won multiple awards, including the Philip K. Dick Best Sci-Fi Short 2018.

<text>The Florida Department of Corrections is divided into four regions, each representing a specific geographical area of the state. Region I is the panhandle area, Region II is the north-east and north-central areas, Region III consist of central Florida and Region IV which covers the southern portion of the peninsula.

There are several types of facilities in Florida, ranging from community work release centers to maximum security institutions.

The State of Florida operates almost all of its major institutions and most of its lesser facilities. Privately operated prisons in Florida are called &quot;Correctional Facilities&quot; (for example, Lake City Correctional Facility) while state operated facilities are called &quot;Correctional Institutions&quot; (i.e. Union Correctional Institution). Florida State Prison is the only facility in the state officially titled a &quot;Prison&quot;.

<doc id="1203860" wikidata="Q827363" url="?curid=1203860" title="Goodbye Yellow Brick Road">
<text>Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is the seventh studio album by English singer, pianist, and composer Elton John. A double album, it was released on 5 October 1973, by DJM Records. Recorded at the Château d&#x27;Hérouville in France, the album became a double LP once John and his band became inspired by the locale. Among the 17 tracks, the album contains the hits &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot;, US number-one single &quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Alright for Fighting&quot;, along with the live favourite &quot;Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding&quot;.

The album was a strong commercial success, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart; it has since sold more than 20 million copies worldwide and is widely regarded as John&#x27;s magnum opus. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2003, and continues to be highly regarded in various rankings. It was ranked number 112 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 2020 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

== Production ==
Under the working titles of &quot;Vodka and Tonics&quot; and &quot;Silent Movies, Talking Pictures&quot;, Bernie Taupin wrote the lyrics in two and a half weeks, with Elton John composing most of the melodies in three days while staying at the Pink Flamingo Hotel in Kingston, Jamaica. John had wanted to go to Jamaica, in part because the Rolling Stones had just recorded &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; there.

Production on the album was started in Jamaica in January 1973, but due to difficulties with the sound system and the studio piano, logistical issues arising from the Joe Frazier–George Foreman boxing match taking place in Kingston, and protests over the political and economic situation in the country, the band decided to move before any productive work was done.

&quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; was recorded in two weeks at the Studio d&#x27;enregistrement Michel Magne, at the Château d&#x27;Hérouville near Pontoise, in France, where John had previously recorded &quot;Honky Château&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot Me I&#x27;m Only the Piano Player&quot;. While a version of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Alright for Fighting&quot; was recorded in Jamaica, that recording was discarded; the released version of the song came from the sessions at the Château. The band plays on all the songs except &quot;This Song Has No Title&quot;, on which John performs all the piano, keyboard and vocal parts.

According to the album&#x27;s producer, Gus Dudgeon, the album was not planned as a two-record collection. John and Taupin composed a total of 22 tracks for the album, of which 18 (counting &quot;Funeral for a Friend&quot; and &quot;Love Lies Bleeding&quot; as two distinct tracks) were used, enough that it was released as a double album, John&#x27;s first (three more such albums followed up to 2011). Through the medium of cinematic metaphor, the album builds on nostalgia for a childhood and culture left in the past. Tracks include &quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;, the 11-minute &quot;Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding&quot;, and the Marilyn Monroe tribute &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot;. &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Alright for Fighting&quot; was inspired by memories of a Market Rasen pub Taupin frequented when younger. &quot;Grey Seal&quot;, previously the B-side of the 1970 single &quot;Rock and Roll Madonna&quot;, was re-recorded for the album.

&quot;Harmony&quot; the album&#x27;s final track, was considered as a fourth single, but was not issued at the time because the chart longevity of the album and its singles brought it too close to the upcoming releases of &quot;Caribou&quot; and its proposed accompanying singles. It was, however, used as the B-side of the American release of the &quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot; single, and was popular on FM playlists of the day, especially WBZ-FM in Boston, whose top 40 chart allowed for the inclusion of LP cuts and B-sides as voted for by listeners. &quot;Harmony&quot; spent three weeks at no. 1 on WBZ-FM&#x27;s chart in June 1974 and ranked no. 6 for the year, with &quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot; at no. 1 and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot; behind &quot;Harmony&quot; at no. 7. &quot;Harmony&quot; was released as a single in Britain in 1980 and failed to chart.

== Release and reception ==
The album was released on 5 October 1973 as a double LP, with cover art by illustrator Ian Beck depicting John stepping into a poster. It debuted at no. 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and quickly rose to no. 1 on its fourth week on the chart, where it stayed for eight consecutive weeks. It was the best selling album in the US in 1974. The album was preceded by its lead single, &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Alright for Fighting&quot;, which reached no. 7 on the UK singles chart and no. 12 in the US. Its next single, &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; reached no. 6 in the UK and no. 2 in the US. &quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot; was released as a single in the US, and it topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for one week in 1974. And its final single, &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot;, released in the UK, reached no. 11.

The original 1973 LP was released on two discs, while the 1992 and 1995 CD remasters put the album on one disc as it was slightly less than 80 minutes. The 30th anniversary edition followed the original format, splitting the album across two discs to allow the inclusion of the bonus tracks, while a DVD on the making of the album was also included. The album has also been released by Mobile Fidelity as a single disc 24 karat gold CD. The album (including all four bonus tracks) was released on SACD (2003), DVD-Audio (2004), and Blu-ray Audio (2014). These high resolution releases included the original stereo mixes, as well as 5.1 remixes produced and engineered by Greg Penny.

&quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; is widely regarded as one of John&#x27;s best albums, and is one of his most popular; it is his best-selling studio album.

In the US it was certified gold on 12 October 1973 (just days after release), 5× platinum in March 1993, and eventually 8× platinum in February 2014 by the RIAA.

===Legacy===
The album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2003, and was included in the 2005 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

In 2003 and 2012, the album was ranked number 91 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and re-ranked number 112 in a 2020 revised list. &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; ranked number 59 in Channel 4&#x27;s 2009 list of 100 Greatest Albums.

In 2023, Joe Lynch of &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the album cover, depicting the &quot;bedazzled rocker – wearing ruby red platform heels and a bomber jacket with his name on it — step[ping] into a poster of the famed yellow brick road Dorothy and her coterie followed to the Emerald City of Oz,&quot; as the 74th best album cover of all time. Lynch dubbed the image career-defining, as it &quot;came out three years before Elton himself did – but if you didn&#x27;t get that he was a Friend of Dorothy based on this, that&#x27;s on you.&quot;

The liner note illustration for the song &quot;I&#x27;ve Seen That Movie Too&quot;, depicting silhouettes in front of a movie screen, inspired the staging of the comedy television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

<doc id="1203863" wikidata="Q4734" url="?curid=1203863" title="Congolese franc">
<text>The Congolese franc (, code ) is the currency of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In the past, it was subdivided into 100 &quot;centimes&quot;. However, centimes no longer have a practical value and are no longer used. In April 2024, 2,800 francs was equivalent to one United States dollar (US$1).

==First franc (1887–1967)==
Currency denominated in centimes and francs (called in Dutch) was first introduced in 1887 for use in the Congo Free State (1885–1908). After the Free State&#x27;s annexation by Belgium, the currency continued in the Belgian Congo. The francs were equal in value to the Belgian franc. From 1916, the Congolese franc also circulated in Ruanda-Urundi (present day Rwanda and Burundi) and, from 1952, the currency was issued jointly in the names of the Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi. After the independence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1960, Ruanda-Urundi adopted its own franc, whilst, between 1960 and 1963, Katanga also issued a franc of its own.

A currency based on the gold standard was created for the Congo Free State in 1887. Banknotes were issued from 1896 in the name of the General Treasury of the Congo Free State (&quot;Trésoire générale de l&#x27;État indépendant du Congo&quot;) payable to the bearer, until the annexation of the Free State in 1908.

As a result of the confused legal definition under Article 11 of the 1908 Colonial Charter, it has been argued that the Congolese franc did not exist &quot;de jure&quot; as a currency between 1908 and 1960 and was instead merely a token representing a claim on Belgian francs. It did exist, however, as the sole &quot;de facto&quot; currency in the Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi.

A decree in 1911 authorised the private Bank of the Belgian Congo (&quot;Banque du Congo Belge&quot;, BCB) to issue banknotes for the Belgian Congo payable to the bearer. They could be converted into the gold or silver currency of the Latin Union or into foreign currencies at the prevailing gold exchange rate. Convertability was suspended during World War I and was only restored in 1927. Although the Congolese franc had appreciated during the conflict, it was restored to parity with the Belgian franc in 1919. Parity was again broken during World War II. After the conflict, the Congolese and Belgian francs continued to form part of the &quot;Belgian monetary zone&quot; under the Bretton Woods system. A central bank was created in 1951 entitled the Central Bank of the Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi (&quot;Banque Centrale du Congo Belge et du Ruanda-Urundi&quot;, BCCBRU) which subsequently issued both coins and banknotes and dealt with foreign exchange controls and was partially supported by the National Bank of Belgium.

The franc remained Congo&#x27;s currency after independence in 1960. Afterwards, its value relative to the Belgian franc fell. In 1967, when the &quot;zaire&quot; was introduced, at a rate of 1 zaïre = 1,000 francs.

===Coins===

In 1887, holed, copper coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 5 and 10 centimes, together with silver coins worth 50 centimes, and 1, 2, and 5 francs. Coins ceased to be minted in silver in 1896. Holed, cupro-nickel 5, 10 and 20 centime coins were introduced in 1906, with the remaining copper coins (worth 1 and 2 centimes) minted until 1919. Cupro-nickel 50 centime and 1 franc coins were introduced in 1921 and 1920, respectively.

The coinage of Belgian Congo ceased in 1929, only to be resumed in 1936 and 1937 for the issue of nickel-bronze 5 franc coins. In 1943, hexagonal, brass 2 franc coins were introduced, followed by round, brass coins worth 1, 2 and 5 francs, and silver 50 franc coins, between 1944 and 1947.

In 1952, brass 5-franc coins were issued carrying the name &quot;Ruanda-Urundi&quot; for the first time.

Aluminum coins worth 50 centimes, 1 and 5 francs followed between 1954 and 1957. In 1965, the only franc-denominated coins of the first Democratic Republic of Congo were issued, aluminum coins worth 10 francs.
As with Belgium&#x27;s own coins, some types were issued in two distinct versions, one with French legends, the other with Dutch legends.

===Banknotes===

In 1896 the Congo Free State issued 10 and 100 franc notes. In 1912, the Bank of Belgian Congo introduced 20 and 1000 francs, followed by notes of 1, 5 and 100 franc notes in 1914. The 1-franc notes were only printed until 1920, whilst 10 franc notes were introduced in 1937. 500 francs were introduced in the 1940s, with 10,000 francs introduced in 1942.

In 1952, the Central Bank of Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi introduced notes for 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 francs, with 500 and 1000 francs added in 1953.

In 1961, the National Bank of Congo introduced notes for 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 francs, some of which were issued until 1964. In 1962, the Monetary Council of the Republic of Congo introduced 1000 franc notes, which were notes of the Central Bank of Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi overprinted with the Monetary Council&#x27;s name. In 1963, the Monetary Council issued regular type 100 and 5000 franc notes.

==Second franc (1997–present)==
The franc was re-established in 1997, replacing the &quot;new zaïre&quot; at a rate of 1 franc = 100,000 new zaïres, equivalent to 300 trillion old francs.

Coins were not been issued; denominations below one franc were issued in banknote form only. Coins were struck, but the value of the metal in each coin exceeded the value of the coin. 

===Banknotes===
On 30 June 1998, banknotes were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 centimes, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 francs, though all are dated 01.11.1997. 200-franc notes were introduced in 2000, followed by 500-franc notes in 2002. In February 2025, the only negotiable instrument in circulation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was banknotes of 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 and 20,000 francs. 

In 2010, the Central Bank of the Congo issued 20 million 500 franc banknotes to commemorate the country&#x27;s 50th anniversary of independence from Belgium.

On July 2, 2012, the Central Bank of the Congo issued new banknotes in denominations of 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 and 20,000 francs.

The smallest note in use is 50 francs.

<doc id="1203877" wikidata="Q6392223" url="?curid=1203877" title="Kentucky Department of Corrections">
<text>The Kentucky Department of Corrections is a state agency of the Kentucky Justice &amp; Public Safety Cabinet that operates state-owned adult correctional facilities and provides oversight for and sets standards for county jails. They also provide training, community based services, and oversees the state&#x27;s Probation &amp; Parole Division. The agency is headquartered in the Health Services Building in Frankfort.

==Facilities==
===State-owned or operated===

Following is a list of Kentucky state prisons:

=== Private prisons ===

In June 2013, Kentucky temporarily ended its decades-long relationship with Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) (now CoreCivic), closing Marion Adjustment Center in St. Mary, the last private prison at the time that housed Kentucky inmates. This decision was widely applauded across the state, as the tax dollar savings totaled in the millions.

Otter Creek Correctional Center in Wheelright was closed in 2012 amid continued allegations of medical neglect, shoddy security, and sexual abuse of inmates from staff. It is still owned by CoreCivic. On October 18, 2019, Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin announced that the Commonwealth of Kentucky would enter into a ten-year agreement with CoreCivic to lease and reopen the facility. The prison, which was renamed the Southeast State Correctional Complex, is now operated and staffed by the Kentucky Department of Corrections and is managed under the same rules and procedures as state-owned prisons. The prison reopened under state management in September 2020.

Lee Adjustment Center in Beattyville, also operated by CoreCivic, housed out-of-state inmates from Vermont until 2010. In November 2017, due to facility overcrowding, the Kentucky Department of Corrections signed a contract allowing CoreCivic to reactivate the vacant prison to house up to 800 male inmates. These inmates would be transferred from the Kentucky State Reformatory. The facility reopened and began accepting inmates in March 2018.

==Death row==
The Kentucky State Penitentiary (KSP) houses the male death row. The Kentucky Correctional Institute for Women houses the female death row. Executions occur at KSP.

===History===

Between 1967 and 2011, 67% of Kentucky&#x27;s executions were abolished. For this reason, in 2011 the American Bar Association (ABA) recommended suspending capital punishment in the state. In 2015, Kentucky Senator Robin Webb introduced a death penalty reform bill. The text of the bill called for changes in training for law enforcement and court officials. The bill also focused on the collection and retention of DNA evidence. On March 25, 2022, the Kentucky Senate approved a bill banning the death penalty for people with serious mental illnesses.

=== Staffing ===

Since the beginning of the 2015 fiscal year, the department has seen a staffing shortage to low salaries, constant overtime (currently nearing $10 million), and the lure of higher paying jobs in the private sector. In response to this staffing crisis and continued pressure from correctional employees, the Kentucky Legislature held a special session and approved an immediate 13.1% salary increase for current security staff, moved non-security staff to 40 hour work weeks, and increased the starting salary for Correctional Officers from $23,346 to $30,000 annually. Shortly after taking office, former governor Matt Bevin included $4.5 million in his biennial budget proposal to provide retention raises for correctional staff.

==Health care==
In July 2021, the department won a court ruling allowing it to deny health care to prisoners in order to save money. The ruling pertains to a treatment for Hepatitis C, which cost from $13,000 to $32,000.

The new group were named &#x27;Front End Loader&#x27; – which was originally chosen as &quot;a ridiculous, strictly temporary title, until something better came up. Ha&quot; – to enter into a Sydney University band competition. They made the final alongside Frenzal Rhomb but both lost out to another group.

In January 1993 Front End Loader appeared at the Sydney venue of the Big Day Out concert series. In the next month they issued their debut singles &quot;Weak as Piss&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Fraid Knot&quot;. Their debut album was the self-titled, &quot;Front End Loader&quot;, which was released in the June 1993. It was recorded at Powerhouse Studios and was produced by the group with Paul Tagg. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt it &quot;highlighted the band&#x27;s sense of humour and gritty, unrestrained brand of thrash rock&quot;. In September that year they supported an Australian tour by Canadian group, No Means No.

===1994-2000: &quot;Adolescent Fantasy World&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Ride!&quot; &amp; &quot;Last of the V8 Interceptors&quot;===
In June 1994 Front End Loader released the EP, &quot;Adolescent Fantasy World&quot;, and followed with a split single, &quot;Heightened State of Awareness&quot; backed by a track from Melbourne-based psychobilly band, Fireballs. In October that year Front End Loader toured Europe supporting No Means No. Their second album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Ride!&quot;, as well as its lead single, &quot;Be Jesus&quot;, were released in March 1995 by Shagpile Records and distributed by Shock Records. They had been recorded in September 1994 at Q Studios and mixed at Eclipse Studios with David Price and the group producing. Together the material &quot;mixed brawn with irony, complex riffs with eccentric humour&quot; according to McFarlane. Rachel Hill of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; felt the album &quot;deserves a second hearing ... [as it] takes the fearless on a ... full-strength adventure of emotion and power&quot;. In November 1995 they supported No Means No on an Australian tour.

Campbell formed a side project, the Impossibles, in 1996, as an alternative rock group. Fellow members were Dave Aston on drums (of Trout Fishing in Quebec), Geoff Martin on bass guitar (Imp) and Brendan Smyly on saxophone and vocals (Andy 500). Cameron and Smyly had met working behind the bar at the Sandringham Hotel, Newtown and Smyly had guested on an album by Front End Loader. The Impossibles released an eight-track EP, &quot;Blanket Show&quot;, in 1998 before disbanding in 2001.

In January 1997 they supported Radio Birdman at gigs in Gosford and Coogee Bay, I-94 Bar&#x27;s reviewer, The Barman, noted &quot;while they&#x27;re tight and intense, it&#x27;s hard to see why they bother having two guitarists when, for most of the night, they play the same thing. I want to like them but I can&#x27;t help thinking Helmet do the same thing, only better&quot;. Their third album, &quot;Last of the V8 Interceptors&quot;, was released in August 1997, which was named for the protagonist&#x27;s vehicle in the feature film, &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; (1981). It had been recorded in April 1997 with Magoo (Regurgitator, Tu-plang) producing at Paradise Studios.

An ode to assisted suicide, &quot;Pulse&quot;, from the album was issued as a single and became their signature tune. It received high rotation on national radio, including on Triple J. &quot;Pulse&quot; was listed at No. 72 on that network&#x27;s Hottest 100 poll for the year. Two further singles from the album appeared in 1998, &quot;Summer Hits&quot; (February) and &quot;4 Star Heritage Arsehole&quot; (April). During the latter half of that year Campbell worked with a pop, rock group, Stella One Eleven; he was also a guest musician on Jimmy Little&#x27;s adult contemporary album, &quot;Messenger&quot; (June 1999).

In 1999 Front End Loader recorded a cover version of Queen&#x27;s &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; as a duet with Barry Crocker, which was issued as a single in July. It appeared on &quot;Timelines: The Intergenerational Music Project&quot;, a compilation album by various artists which paired young bands with artists over 60 to celebrate 1999 as the International Year of Older Persons. At the end of that year Kostic, while still a member of Front End Loader, joined Regurgitator to replace Martin Lee on drums.

===2001-2010: &quot;How Can We Fail When We&#x27;re So Sincere?&quot; &amp; &quot;Laughing with Knives&quot;===
The band signed with Redline Records and in March 2002 released their fourth album, &quot;How Can We Fail When We&#x27;re So Sincere?&quot;. Kostic joined another group, The Hard-Ons, on drums while continuing with Regurgitator and Front End Loader. In April the following year Front End Loader entered Troy Horse Studios, with Jonboyrock producing, to record, &quot;Ape Got Fire&quot; (August 2003), a seven-track EP.

In May 2004 the group&#x27;s performance at Sydney&#x27;s Annandale Hotel was recorded by Magoo, which was eventually released on 1 April 2008 as part of a live album, &quot;Laughing with Knives&quot;. It appeared on the Illustrious Artists label in a 2×CD format with 22 live tracks, a bonus 19-track disc of rarities, and an 8-page booklet with track-by-track liner notes.

===2011-2017: &quot;Ritardando&quot; &amp; &quot;Fresh Six&quot;===
On 6 May 2011 the band&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Ritardando&quot;, was issued on their own label, Weeping Anus Records. They followed with a national tour to promote the release. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2011 it won the Best Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Album category. The group had sent Triple J host and Frenzal Rhomb member, Lindsay McDougall, along to deliver an acceptance speech even though they felt a win was &quot;highly improbable&quot;.

In the prepared speech, the band indicated they could not afford to attend, they thanked their fans and families; then they addressed the local music industry &quot;as you were … please carry on … we mean you no harm. We will continue to write Rock Music that we enjoy, play shows when and where we can, and record and release this music as our time, money, and circumstances permit. None of these activities concern you so please, move along, and let us never speak of this again&quot;. The speech was not broadcast during the Nine Network&#x27;s channel, Go!&#x27;s coverage of the ceremony.

On 14 July 2012 the group delivered another EP, the five-track &quot;Fresh Six&quot;, while promoting a collaborative beer of the same name made with Young Henrys Brewery. The beer was described by the company&#x27;s owner as &quot;tight and pretty punchy, and it should be strong obviously ... fairly bitter, and I know you guys are fond of tequila on stage so we should include some dark agave syrup in the beer&quot;. Campbell told theMusic.com.au website&#x27;s Steve Bell &quot;Making a beer for us was far more impressive than the ARIA&quot;.

===2018-present: &quot;Neutral Evil&quot;===
In April 2018, the group released their sixth studio album, &quot;Neutral Evil&quot;.

<doc id="1203880" wikidata="Q2043891" url="?curid=1203880" title="Harley Granville-Barker">
<text>Harley Granville-Barker (25 November 1877 – 31 August 1946) was an English actor, director, playwright, manager, critic, and theorist. After early success as an actor in the plays of George Bernard Shaw, he increasingly turned to directing and was a major figure in British theatre in the Edwardian and inter-war periods. As a writer his plays, which tackled difficult and controversial subject matter, met with a mixed reception during his lifetime but have continued to receive attention.

==Biography==
===Early life and acting career===
Harley Granville-Barker was born in London, England on 25 November 1877. He left school at 14 and began a career in acting. As his career blossomed, he seemed to excel in roles that were a culmination of intelligence and romantic dreaminess. This landed him many roles such as; Tanner in &quot;Man and Superman&quot;, Cusins in &quot;Major Barbara&quot;, Marchbanks in &quot;Candida&quot;, and Dubedat in &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;. To be more specific the Dubedat and Cusins characters were written by George Bernard Shaw with Granville-Barker specifically in mind. However, performing no longer appealed to Granville-Barker so he gave it up in 1911.

===Directing career===
With an interest in theatre still at heart, he decided to focus on directing. During this time directing was not a focus point in English theatre, but he used the building blocks of Antoine and Reinhardt to his advantage and contributed to changing the dynamics of production in English theatre. Some of his first assignments were with the Stage Society, but it wasn&#x27;t until 1904 when he worked with the Royal Court Theatre that his directing career took off. From 1904 to 1907 he was considered to be one of the major reformers of the Edwardian Stage. While working with the Royal Court, he collaborated with J.E. Vedrenne to mount almost 1,000 performances. Many of these performances were classics while some were new works. Among the new pieces of work were eleven plays written by George Bernard Shaw. Granville-Barker often worked with Shaw to assist in staging his plays and directing them as well.

As the Vedrenne-Barker seasons closed with the Royal Court, new opportunities opened with the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in 1910. This new opportunity reminded Granville-Barker of the need for more repertory companies. In 1904 he collaborated with William Archer to write a book that argued for a national theatre; unfortunately, it was a lost cause that became one of the biggest disappointments in his life. However, his efforts did not go to waste but added to the growth of the regional repertory movement in Britain.

Granville-Barker&#x27;s directing career boomed with three famous productions of Shakespeare at the Savoy Theatre: &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; during 1912 and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; in 1914. Granville-Barker took these productions and removed all classic scenery and replaced it with symbolic scenery, as well as enforcing ensemble acting.

===Writing career===

The year before he met his first wife, Granville-Barker wrote &quot;The Voysey Inheritance&quot; which is considered to be a masterpiece of the Edwardian stage. His other plays, however, did not sit well with the Edwardian audience. They found his plays to be incomprehensible.

According to &quot;The Oxford Companion to Theatre and Performance&quot;, his style was more similar to the style of Chekhov in that it put the &quot;action under the surface.&quot; Although his audience may not have understood him, this did not stop Granville-Barker from discussing important issues in society. In 1907 Granville-Barker&#x27;s play &quot;Waste&quot; was banned due to the topic of abortion and its politics. In 1909, three volumes of his plays, &quot;The Voysey Inheritance&quot;, &quot;Waste&quot;, and &quot;The Marrying of Ann Leete&quot;, were published in a limited edition of 50 copies printed on handmade paper in a slipcase.

Granville-Barker&#x27;s most notable prose work is the &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; written from 1927 to the end of his life in 1946. &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; was considered the first major Shakespeare study to attend to the practical matters of staging. The prefaces were published in two hardback volumes in 1946 and 1947.

===Personal life===
Granville-Barker met his first wife Lillah McCarthy on tour with Ben Greet&#x27;s Shakespeare and Old English Touring Company in 1895 when he was 17. In Ben Greet&#x27;s company, he played Paris to McCarthy&#x27;s Juliet. McCarthy first appeared at The Court Theatre under Barker&#x27;s co-management in &quot;John Bull&#x27;s Other Island&quot; in 1905. Shortly thereafter, Barker played opposite McCarthy in &quot;Man and Superman&quot; (1905). They married on April 24, 1906 at the West Strand Registry Office. McCarthy was to have a leading part in Barker&#x27;s personal and professional life until their split after World War I. He divorced McCarthy and married an American writer named Helen Huntington who supposedly disliked the stage, actors, and especially Shaw. He then hyphenated his name, causing his colleagues to believe that he was abandoning the battle for a life of luxury. Recently, the negative characterization of Helen &quot;as a theatre-hating woman who ruined Barker&#x27;s career&quot; has been disputed, and her dislike of the theater refuted, on the basis of Granville-Barker&#x27;s early correspondence with her. &quot;In fact she was a regular theatre-goer, a writer and Barker&#x27;s eventual collaborator.&quot;

He later settled in Paris where he collaborated with Huntington on translating the comedies of Martínez Sierra and the Álvarez Quintero brothers. On the outbreak of the Second World War, Granville-Barker fled France for Spain before moving to the United States. In America he lectured at Harvard and was also employed by British Information Services. At the end of the war he returned to France and died in Paris on 31 August 1946. Sympathetic to left-wing causes, he had declined a knighthood.

<doc id="1203881" wikidata="Q6116999" url="?curid=1203881" title="Jackson College">
<text>Jackson College is a public college in Jackson County, Michigan. Originally established as Jackson Junior College in 1928, Jackson County electors voted to reincorporate the institution as a community college district under the &quot;Public Act 188 of 1955&quot; in 1962. In 1964 voters approved a charter millage that continues to indefinitely fund the college. In June 2013, the board of trustees approved an official name change from Jackson Community College to Jackson College.

Jackson College has been accredited by the Higher Learning Commission since 1933 and offers 48 associate degrees, certificate programs, and transfer options to Jackson County and Michigan residents. Today, the college has a yearly enrollment of nearly 8,000 students across its several locations. These locations are: Central Campus located in Summit Township, JC/LISD Academy in Adrian, and the LeTarte Center in Hillsdale, as well as online programs.

Jackson College&#x27;s Central Campus offers student housing facilities, becoming one of only a handful of community colleges in Michigan to offer student housing. The college provides a variety of Division II athletic programs, including basketball, baseball, softball, soccer, bowling, cross country and golf.

== History ==
Jackson College was founded as Jackson Junior College in 1928 and operated as a division of the Jackson Public Schools. Voters agreed to make it a separate entity in 1962, and the name was changed to Jackson Community College in 1965. In June 2013, the school&#x27;s board of directors approved a name change to Jackson College. Daniel Phelan, president of the college at the time, is quoted as saying that the word &quot;community&quot; was removed to reflect the highest degree offered by the college. Trustees also set a budget of $50,000 for the rebranding all items bearing the college&#x27;s name and logo.

== Campuses ==
Jackson college currently operates on 3 campuses and satellite programs in and around the Jackson area. 
* Central Campus - The primary and largest of the 3 locations, with the majority of the college&#x27;s academic buildings and administrative offices being located here, in addition to sports complexes, a nature trail, and frisbee golf course. Most notably, central campus includes the Potter Center, which is among the most versatile and capable performing arts centers in the Southern region of Michigan.
* JC/LISD Academy - Started in 2003 as a partnership program with the Lenawee Intermediate School District, and located in Adrian, Michigan. The program is intended to immerse ambitious high school students in the post-secondary learning environment, while affording them the opportunity to both complete a high school diploma and receive an associate degree in a 5 year period. While it started in 2003 under the nickname JC @ LISD TECH, where classes held in classrooms within the 11 Lenawee school districts it offered classes to, the program became JC/LISD Academy in 2013 upon the opening of a brick and mortar building, rather than. The 27,000-square-foot location features modern technology, classroom spaces, a science wing, a full-service bookstore, and a bistro.
* Clyde LeTarte Center - A satellite program opened in 1991. In addition to offering associates degrees and certificate programs, the Hillsdale location offers classes in allied health fields, business, criminal justice, graphic design, nursing and many courses aimed at students seeking to earn more affordable or accessible credits towards 4-year degrees. Prior to the creation of this center, Jackson College had offered classes through Hillsdale High School&#x27;s adult education program.
=== Closed campuses ===
* W.J. Maher Campus - This now closed campus was opened in 2012. It was named after William J. Maher, a veteran US Navy pilot who served in World War 2, following the Maher family and their foundation&#x27;s gifting of a sizable monetary donation raised via fundraiser, solely in support of the Maher Campus. Campus operations were indefinitely halted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the building was sold to Automated Logistics Systems on June 3, 2023.
* Jackson Flight Center - Now closed, it was opened in 1979. Located at the Jackson Airport, the JC Aviation program educated future pilots with both the flight and ground hours necessary to receive a pilot&#x27;s license. A trend of diminishing interest in the program was noticed by educators since the events of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, although there may be no direct connection to such events. It was shut down August 6, 2020, immediately following the COVID-19 pandemic, due to such declining levels of interest. There was a notable revamping of local interest in aviation education from the creation of Flight School Jackson, a private flight school founded in the absence of the JC Aviation program.
=== Student housing ===
Housing at Jackson College is limited to its Central Campus, and there are currently 3 student residence buildings. The Campus View residences, ordered by their respective construction years, include Campus View 1 (built in 2007), Campus View 2 (built in 2009), and Campus View 3 (built in 2015).

CV1 and CV2 are both located on the southeast corner of the Central campus, while CV3 is located on the south side.

<doc id="1203896" wikidata="Q1754363" url="?curid=1203896" title="Caribou (album)">
<text>Caribou is the eighth studio album by English musician Elton John, released on 24 June 1974 by MCA Records in the US and on 28 June by DJM Records in the UK. It was his fourth chart-topping album in the United States and his third in the United Kingdom. The album contains the singles &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot;, which reached number 16 in the UK Singles Chart and number two in the US, and &quot;The Bitch Is Back&quot;, which reached number 15 in the UK and number four in the US. Both singles reached number one in Canada on the &quot;RPM 100&quot; national Top Singles Chart, as did the album itself.

The album met with lukewarm reviews on its release and legacy reviews do not consider the record to be among John&#x27;s best work from his early 1970s peak period. However, the album was a commercial success and has been certified double-platinum in the US as well as receiving a gold certification in the UK. The album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 17th Annual Grammy Awards.

==Background==
In the liner notes to the 1995 CD re-release, Elton John described the album as being recorded quickly in January 1974, with only about nine days to get everything recorded, because he and the band &quot;were under enormous pressure&quot; to finish the album and immediately embark on a Japanese tour. Producer Gus Dudgeon added additional backing vocals, horns and other overdubs after John and the band had finished their work. Dudgeon later called the album &quot;a piece of crap ... the sound is the worst, the songs are nowhere, the sleeve came out wrong, the lyrics weren&#x27;t that good, the singing wasn&#x27;t all there, the playing wasn&#x27;t great and the production is just plain lousy&quot;.

The album was named after the Caribou Ranch recording studio in Nederland, Colorado, where part of the album was recorded.

&quot;Ticking&quot; tells the story of a man suffering from a repressed childhood who kills 14 people in a mass shooting in a bar in New York City. Despite being described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Tom Nolan as &quot;the centerpiece fiasco&quot; of the album in his 1974 review of &quot;Caribou&quot;, in 2015 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers voted the song their second-favourite &quot;deep cut&quot; of lesser-known Elton John songs.

In addition to the singles, John has over the years played several other songs from this album in concert, including &quot;Grimsby&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re So Static&quot;, &quot;Ticking&quot; and &quot;Dixie Lily&quot;. The 1995 CD reissue contains four songs from the general period in and around the release of &quot;Caribou&quot;, though only two of them, the B-sides &quot;Sick City&quot; and &quot;Cold Highway&quot;, were recorded during the album sessions. &quot;Step into Christmas&quot; was recorded during a previous one-off single session, and &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; was recorded at The Who&#x27;s Ramport Studios in England, during the sessions for the movie score and soundtrack album of &quot;Tommy&quot;.

In February 2024, it was announced Mercury Records would reissue the album as 2-LP set on April 20 as part of Record Store Day to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the album&#x27;s original release in summer 1974. Pressed on blue sky colored vinyl, LP 1 contains the original album. The second LP includes the b-sides &quot;Sick City&quot; and &quot;Cold Highway,&quot; John&#x27;s version of &quot;Pinball Wizard,&quot; &quot;The Bitch Is Back&quot; (New Radio Mix 2024) and a new extended version of the album track &quot;Stinker,&quot; the outtake &quot;Ducktail Jiver,&quot; which was recorded during the &quot;Caribou&quot; sessions, and John&#x27;s demo version of &quot;Snookeroo,&quot; later recorded by Ringo Starr for his album &quot;Goodnight Vienna&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Tom Nolan of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the album as &quot;dispiriting&quot; and said, &quot;Nearly every song on &quot;Caribou&quot; suffers from a blithe lack of focus, an almost arrogant disregard of the need to establish context or purpose ... Shifting from sentimental to heavy to mocking, [John and Bernie Taupin] not only fail to touch all bases but undercut what credence they might possibly have achieved.&quot; Criticising the album&#x27;s production and the superficiality of the songs, he concluded that &quot;Caribou&quot; is &quot;a startlingly empty experience&quot;.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine&#x27;s retrospective review for AllMusic called &quot;Caribou&quot; &quot;a disappointment&quot; and that aside from the two singles, &quot;the album tracks tend to be ridiculous filler on the order of &#x27;Solar Prestige a Gammon&#x27; or competent genre exercises like &#x27;You&#x27;re So Static&#x27;&quot;.

==Track listing==

<doc id="1203902" wikidata="Q1979516" url="?curid=1203902" title="Horam">
<text>Horam is a village, electoral ward and civil parish in the Wealden District of East Sussex, situated south of Heathfield. Included in the parish are the settlements of Vines Cross and Burlow.

==History==
The village of Horam grew up around the railway station and was formerly known as &#x27;Horeham&#x27; or &#x27;Horeham Road&#x27;. The railway station (closed in 1965 under the Beeching Axe) was originally named ‘Horeham Road &quot;for&quot; Waldron’. In 1891 it became ‘Horeham Road &quot;and&quot; Waldron’. In 1925 the village changed its name to Horam, although the station persevered with ‘Waldron and Horeham Road’ until 1935. The dialling code for Horam is still listed as &#x27;Horam Road&#x27;.

Vines Cross is named after John Vyne, who was a local vintner in 1595. Like many other settlements on the Weald, Horam was involved in the Wealden iron industry.

==Governance==
Horam Parish Council consists of twelve members.

==Geography==
Horam village lies on the A267 Tunbridge Wells–Eastbourne road south of Heathfield. The area is on the slopes of the Weald: there are many headwater streams of the River Cuckmere, carving out valleys, the main one being the Waldron Ghyll (or Gill).

==Transport==
Horam is served by various routes of the Eastbourne Bus Company.
The former railway line is now the Cuckoo Trail footpath through the village.

==Religion==

The village is served by Christ Church (the local Church of England church) which is found in Horebeech Lane. The present vicar is Peter-John Guy. The small church in Vines Cross was dedicated to St James but is no longer in existence.

==Education==
Primary education is provided at Maynards Green Primary School.
St Mary&#x27;s School, Horam is a secondary day and residential special school, located at Maynards Green.

==Notable locals==
The author and naturalist Walter J.C. Murray lived in Horam and his book &quot;A Sanctuary Planted&quot; describes the cultivation of his garden on Little London Road in Horam as a private nature sanctuary. His book &quot;Copsford&quot; describes a year spent in a derelict cottage on land between Furnace Lane and Dern Lane.

==Horam on film==
Jack Brookman, a local amateur film maker who lived on Vines Cross Road and then Tollwood Road in Horam made a number of short films documenting Horam which are available free to view on YouTube.

<text>Sir Herbert Atkinson Barker (21 April 1869 – 21 July 1950) was an English manipulative surgeon. He developed a highly successful technique, specialising in knee and other damaged joints both in the top sportsmen and the general public. He advocated the avoidance of surgery. However, his methods were never formally approved by the medical establishment. Because of opposition towards a Lambeth degree or honorary degree for him, he was instead honored with a knighthood in 1922, nominally for services in World War I.

In the 1920s he visited Doctor&#x27;s Cave Beach Club in Montego Bay, Jamaica, and was most impressed by the curative powers of the waters. His subsequent articles about the beach lead to it becoming a popular destination for those seeking cures, and this was the start of the tourist industry in Montego Bay.

He wrote &quot;Leaves from My Life: Reminiscences by the famous Manipulative Surgeon&quot;, published in 1927.

<text>A community college district is type of special-purpose district in some U.S. states. Each district consists of part of a state and operates the public community college system in its district.

Some states, like Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, do not have community college districts. Instead, the community colleges there are administered by state-administered college systems like the West Virginia Community and Technical College System and the Wisconsin Technical College System. In some other states, counties or groups of counties operate community colleges.

<doc id="1203925" wikidata="Q1849003" url="?curid=1203925" title="Matterhorn Bobsleds">
<text>Matterhorn Bobsleds is an attraction that consists of a pair of intertwined steel roller coasters running through a fabricated mountain. It is located at Disneyland in Anaheim, California and is modeled after the Matterhorn, a mountain in the Alps on the border between Switzerland and Italy. It is the first known tubular steel track roller coaster. Located on the border between Tomorrowland and Fantasyland, it employs forced perspective to seem larger.

==History==
===1956–1970===
During the construction of the park, dirt from the excavation of Sleeping Beauty Castle&#x27;s moat was piled in an area between Fantasyland and Tomorrowland. When the park opened, the area, dubbed Holiday Hill (and later Lookout Mountain), was improved with benches and pathways to encourage its use as a picnic area. After the opening of the Disneyland Skyway in 1956, Walt Disney conceived the idea of a toboggan ride on the mountain with real snow, but the logistics caused vehement objections by Disneyland construction chief Joe Fowler. In this period, the hill began to be known as Snow Hill. By now, instead of being a place for picnicking, the hill had come to be used primarily as a nighttime lovers&#x27; lane, much to Disney&#x27;s dismay. New wild mouse-style roller coasters got the attention of Disneyland executives, who began to consider applying this emerging technology to the creation of a toboggan-themed coaster ride on an artificial mountain at the site.

The Matterhorn Bobsleds have a striking resemblance to &quot;one of the oldest rollercoasters in the world, Rutschebanen, also known as Bjergbanen (the Mountain Coaster, which opened in 1914 and still operates with a rider on each train braking the car on each hill).&quot; Similar to Rutschebanen (at the Tivoli in Copenhagen, Denmark), which predated it by nearly half a century, the top of the Matterhorn Bobsleds ride is also an icy scene, and the snowbirds and the interior featuring the Abominable Snowman are also quite similar in design.
The structure was also intended to act as a decorative overlay to camouflage the central pylon of the Skyway. Use of the Matterhorn, both in style and name, grew from Walt Disney&#x27;s extended vacation in Switzerland while filming &quot;Third Man on the Mountain&quot;. In a moment of inspiration, impressed by the beauty of the real Matterhorn, Walt grabbed a postcard of the mountain from a souvenir stand and sent it back to Imagineer (architect) Vic Greene with the message, &quot;Vic. Build This. Walt.&quot; This resulted in the merger of the toboggan-ride concept with the idea for a bobsled coaster ride that would run around and through the structure. The peak was first shown in a conceptual drawing that was once on display at the Disney Gallery.

Imagineer Bob Gurr was responsible for designing the track plan and has said that it was the hardest project that he has ever worked on. He began working on the attraction in mid-1958 after finishing preliminary work on the Submarine Voyage.

American Bridge Company was responsible for constructing the steel structure inside the Matterhorn. In 1936, they built the Bay Bridge that connects Oakland to San Francisco in California.

The view to the northwest shows a corner of the now-defunct Junior Autopia, which would be replaced by both the Matterhorn and the Submarine Voyage attraction the following year. The Matterhorn opened on June 14, 1959, one of three major new Tomorrowland attractions to open that year. Built by coaster builder Arrow Development and WED Imagineering, it was the world&#x27;s first tubular steel roller coaster. It consisted of a wood and steel infrastructure surrounded by man-made rock. Starting with the 1961 holiday season, a revolving star stood atop it.

Trees could be seen on its sides; by making the trees at higher altitudes smaller, the Imagineers used forced perspective to augment the mountain&#x27;s height. Waterfalls cascaded down its sides and frequently sprayed riders. Inside was a large, open space through which the bobsleds traveled. The peak had numerous holes in its exterior through which the bobsleds exited and re-entered, though the space within was not elaborately themed, with the infrastructure only minimally disguised as rock. The Skyway passed through the center of the mountain via a pair of openings on the Fantasyland and Tomorrowland sides. Skyway riders could see down into the Matterhorn&#x27;s interior as they glided through.

===1970s===
In the early 1970s, the ride was officially made a part of Fantasyland, but this was merely a prelude to far more significant changes. In 1973, the revolving star at its top was removed, in part because of the 1973 oil crisis that had hit the US.

In 1978, the Matterhorn received a major refurbishment. Most notably, the hollow interior space was broken up into a number of small, icy caves and tunnels with far more convincing theming. A grotto filled with glimmering crystals was added near the top of the lift hill. Some holes in the mountain&#x27;s skin were filled in as well, including the two large openings at the top of the lift hill that had allowed guests to briefly glimpse the entire southern part of the park. Recorded screams were placed at the top of the lift hill, along with small holes to allow a brief view of the Skyway. Another major addition was an Abominable Snowman, whom the Imagineers dubbed &quot;Harold&quot;. It appears as three similar Audio-Animatronic figures that roar at the bobsledders. The first is visible from both tracks, at the point where they diverge; the other two are visible only from their respective tracks. Each track also features a pair of red eyes that glow in the dark shortly after the lift hill while the Snowman&#x27;s roar is heard. The roars can be heard from ground level as well, even over the recorded howling of the Alpine wind. The bobsleds themselves were also changed from the original flat, luge-like, multi-colored two-seaters to rounder, white cars decorated with orange and red stripes, and from single cars to two connected cars.

===1990s–present===
The Skyway continued to travel through the mountain, but its passageway was now enclosed in similarly themed ice caves. Following the closure of the Skyway in 1994, the cavernous holes through which the Skyway buckets had traveled were partially filled in. The holes in the Tomorrowland face remained mostly intact, and an abandoned crate labeled &quot;Wells Expedition&quot; was also added in the crystal scene as a tribute to Frank Wells, who had died earlier that year. (Wells had climbed six of the Seven Summits, with only Mount Everest remaining at the time of his death.) At the end of the lift chain, a projection of snowfall was added. With the exception of the filling of certain holes, the mountain&#x27;s original external structure remained largely unchanged.

Several small changes accrued between 2003-2005. In 2003, the safety spiel, formerly heard on the lift, was moved to the brake where cast members inspect seatbelts. The original spiel recorded by Jack Wagner was re-recorded by an actor with a German accent, but Wagner&#x27;s Spanish spiel is still heard. The unloading spiel was also changed in 2005, from “Remain seated please” to “Please remain seated with your seatbelt fastened”, which was used in breakdown spiels. The loading station was revamped with new decorations, including new flowers, and new loading gates. Additional fences were added to the catwalks.

The Matterhorn was closed on January 9, 2012 for a six-month refurbishment. The mountain was renovated, receiving new paint externally and some repairs internally. The entire mountain exterior received a facelift. For only the second time—the first since when the attraction was originally built—scaffolding was erected all the way from the base of the mountain to the top. The mountain had been repeatedly repainted through the years, resulting in a mostly white Matterhorn mountain with the appearance of snow; but in 2012, the entire mountain was made bare again and carefully painted in a style more faithful to the look of the real Matterhorn, with more &quot;snow&quot; places on the northern side and less on the southern. For the first time since the Matterhorn&#x27;s early days, the mountain&#x27;s base was mostly snowless. In the past, the &quot;snow&quot; on the mountain&#x27;s surface was merely white paint; for the refurbished ride, glass beads were mixed into the paint to reflect sunlight like real snow. Imagineer Jim Crouch was the rehab&#x27;s art director. The &quot;mountain climber&quot; performers also returned after the refurbishment. The vehicle seating arrangement was also modified to accommodate a single passenger in each seat rather than a lap-sitting arrangement of two riders. This resulted in three individual seats within each bobsled, with two cars linked for a total of six guests, similar to the configuration of the trains at Walt Disney World&#x27;s version of Space Mountain. The new bobsleds were painted red, blue and green, and the ride reopened on June 15, 2012. As a result of the new trains, the height requirement was raised to 42 in (107 cm) from the original 35 in (89 cm). Other smaller changes were made, including the addition of wooden fences on the catwalks and a single-rider lane. The main Abominable Snowman animatronic at the top was given a new roar that was now much louder. It was toned back down around October of that year.

On January 5, 2015, the attraction was closed for an extended refurbishment to prepare for the park&#x27;s 60th anniversary. It reopened on May 22, 2015, with new special effects and updated animatronics. The new Abominable Snowman was designed similarly to the Expedition Everest Yeti, where the creature would look more realistically to an actual ape like animal. The Snowman also had new vocal effects provided by Frank Welker. On the lift hills, the snowfall projection was replaced with the creature peering through a sheet of ice as the bobsleds ascend. The artificial screaming at the top of the lift was also removed. The red eyes were removed, and replaced with the Snowman roaring with the sound that he’s pursuing the bobsleds. The crystal cavern was rethemed to a scene dubbed the &quot;Hord&quot; scene where the cavern has been filled with wreckage of older bobsleds, and former skyway buckets along with other mountain climbing equipment. New animatronics of the Snowman were also put in place, while improved sound effects help create the illusion that it is in pursuit as the train descends down the mountain. Disney&#x27;s FastPass ride system was added to the attraction in April 2017.

The Matterhorn once again closed on July 30, 2018, to redesign the waiting queue, and reopened on November 16, 2018. The front of the old Matterhorn entrance was reworked to accommodate a larger queue area.

==Timeline==
*1956: Walt Disney conceives an idea for a toboggan-style roller coaster inside of a mountain.
*1958: Construction begins.
*June 14, 1959: The Matterhorn Bobsleds open as the first tubular steel roller coaster in the world. It opens alongside the Disneyland Monorail and Submarine Voyage as part of an expansion to Tomorrowland.
*May 1964: A 15-year-old boy from Long Beach, California named Mark Maples is injured after he stands up in his bobsled car and falls out. It was reported that his restraint was undone by his ride companion. He dies as a result of his injuries three days after the incident; it is Disneyland&#x27;s first fatality.
*Early 1970s: The Matterhorn Bobsleds is officially made part of Fantasyland.
*1978: The Matterhorn receives a refurbishment by which Imagineers make smaller caves and tunnels with more theming. The ride also receives new trains and its most notable addition is the Abominable Snowman, which roars at riders twice.
*January 3, 1984: A 47-year-old woman from Fremont, California named Dolly Young was killed when she is thrown from a bobsled car and strikes an oncoming bobsled. An investigation reveals that her seatbelt was not buckled, though it does not indicate whether it was deliberately unfastened or malfunctioned. The English rock group The Fall addresses this incident in the song &quot;Disney&#x27;s Dream Debased&quot; from their 1984 album &quot;The Wonderful and Frightening World Of...&quot;. Bandleader Mark E. Smith and his then-wife Brix Smith visited Disneyland on the day of the incident, and rode the Matterhorn shortly before Young&#x27;s death.
*1994: When the Skyway closes, the Matterhorn openings through which the Skyway had passed are partially filled in. Glimmering crystals and the Wells Expedition crate are added at the beginning of the ride.

==The attraction==

The ride consists of two separate tracks that run roughly parallel to each other for much of the ride, intertwining and eventually deviating from each other at the loading areas. They are the Fantasyland track and Tomorrowland track, named for the side of the mountains where their loading lines begin. The vehicles originally held up to four passengers each, seated single-file. After the 1978 upgrade, the individual vehicles were joined into pairs, with lap seating increasing the capacity per train to eight. In 2012, the cars were replaced with new vehicles as part of a six-month ride closure, and it currently features two cars paired together with three single-file seats per car. The safety restraints consist of a car seat belt. There are hand grips inside the cars, but there are no longer hand grips on the outside of the bobsled. Padding in the car is limited, and the winding track has many sharp turns, leading to a bone-shaking ride, reminiscent of an actual bobsled.

There is one lift hill on each track. Bobsleds ascend parallel to each other at the start of the ride, climbing past walls featuring snow-like special effects. The top of this lift hill constitutes the highest point of the ride itself, though the mountain continues upward for several more stories. The rest of the ride is a mostly unpowered coast through the Matterhorn&#x27;s many caverns and passageways.

The splash-down pools at the end of each track serve dual purposes. They not only cool off the braking pads mounted on the underside of the bobsleds, but the impact into the water itself acts as a braking mechanism. Because of their constant exposure to water, the fiberglass bodies are regularly waxed.

For many years, a basketball half-court existed inside the structure above the coaster, near the top of the mountain, where the mountain climbers could play between climbs. As internal access to the mountain was locked for safety reasons, the court was accessible only to the climbers. The court was relocated slightly during the installation of the Tinkerbell flight equipment prior to the 50th-anniversary celebration; the hoop and playing area remain intact. There is a cast member break room inside the mountain at the base. The court is said by many cast members and the mountain&#x27;s climbers to remain in existence today.
At the end of the attraction, guests hear the now-famous &quot;Remain seated please; Permanecer sentados por favor&quot; safety announcement; it is one of many recordings by the former &quot;Voice of Disneyland,&quot; Jack Wagner. The recording was changed in 2005 to say &quot;Please remain seated with your seat belt fastened; Permanecer sentados por favor.&quot; The changed English dialogue is still in the voice of Jack Wagner, as it was borrowed from the attraction&#x27;s breakdown announcement. This recording also introduces the Tomorrowland segment of the &quot;Remember... Dreams Come True&quot; fireworks show. The safety announcement was featured in the title track of the 1995 No Doubt album &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, and the line was spoken by Barbie in the film &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;. The ride&#x27;s safety message is 
&quot;For your safety, remain seated with your seat belts fastened, keeping your hands, arms, feet, and legs inside the bobsled. And be sure to watch your children. Auf Wiedersehen!&quot;
 Another variant goes, 
&quot;For your safety, remain seated with your seat belt fastened, keeping your hands, arms, feet, and legs inside the bobsled. And please, watch your kids. Thank you!&quot;

After this saying, riders enter the cavern and climb the lift hill. Near the top of the lift the bobsleds pass by a sheet of ice on each side where the Abominable Snowman while also ascending the mountain peers behind the sheet of ice angerly roaring at the sight of intruders. Once the bobsled car has disengaged from the chain, riders pass through a dark tunnel, where the Abominable Snowman&#x27;s roars echo throughout the tunnel. The trains emerge into a cavern filled with destroyed bobsleds, skyway buckets, some climbing equipment, and a crate stamped with &quot;Wells Expedition&quot; may also be seen. Both tracks take a left-hand turn, then split off before they can crash into the first animatronic. The cars swirl around the mountain, dipping under tunnels and by the waterfalls. Each track then passes another animatronic of the Snowman. Soon after the second encounter, riders plunge into the alpine lake and return to the station. No on-ride photo is available for this ride.

==Relations to other Disney parks==
Disneyland in California is the only Disney theme park with a Matterhorn Bobsled ride. The tracks of Space Mountain at Walt Disney World&#x27;s Magic Kingdom were based on the designs of the Matterhorn but are not identical to them. The Matterhorn&#x27;s newer bobsleds, added in 1978, were based on the other ride&#x27;s rockets, which had debuted in 1975. When Space Mountain was built at Disneyland, it was a completely new design with a single track and vehicles that seated riders side by side rather than behind one another. Various proposals to bring the Matterhorn to Walt Disney World existed over the years, but none came to fruition. The most detailed concept was for the Matterhorn to be the main attraction of a Switzerland Pavilion for the World Showcase at Epcot, but this failed when Disney could not secure a sponsor.

Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom contains a roller coaster with a similar theme: Expedition Everest. It is a railway adventure to the top of an abstract version of the Himalayan mountain where riders encounter another cryptozoological mountain beast, the Yeti.

In the 1980s, the Matterhorn Ski Club (ride operators led by Chuck Abbott) began buying seeing eye dogs from Guide Dogs of the Desert with the unclaimed coins and knives that fell out of pockets during the ride. This soon expanded to collecting cans from every employee break area. At one time, the bottom floor of the Matterhorn was filled with bags of aluminum cans. The adopting dog owners were treated like royalty whenever they visited the park.

After the original 1978 Audio-Animatronic Abominable Snowman figures were removed in 2015, one was placed at the queue area of Disney California Adventure&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout! attraction, which opened on May 27, 2017. The figure is portrayed as one of the Collector&#x27;s many artifacts on exhibition.

== In popular culture ==

The music video for Randy Newman&#x27;s song &quot;I Love L.A.&quot; shows the mountain when he sings &quot;look at that mountain&quot;.

The song &quot;Disney&#x27;s Dream Debased&quot; by the Fall (from the album &quot;The Wonderful and Frightening World Of...&quot;) was inspired by the 1984 decapitation accident that happened on the Matterhorn very shortly after band members Mark and Brix Smith had been on the ride themselves.

The video game &quot;Epic Mickey&quot; has its own version of the Matterhorn named Mickeyjunk Mountain, which is littered with old and lost Mickey memorabilia.

The Abominable Snowman from the attraction appears in the 2013 &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; short &quot;Yodelberg&quot;, in which Mickey encounters the creature while climbing a mountain to see Minnie. The bobsled ride vehicles from the attraction litter the entrance of the beast&#x27;s ice-cavern home.

Disney announced in 2011 that it would make a movie based on this attraction called &quot;The Hill&quot;, about five teenagers who go on a journey up the mountain and encounter a yeti. The company announced in 2021 that it would produce a film based on the attraction for their streaming service Disney+, with the working title &quot;Matterhorn.&quot;

The Water Coaster Aqua Mouse on the Disney cruise ship &quot;Disney Wish&quot; features the yeti in the storyline “Swiss Meltdown” where Mickey and Minnie are chased by the creature when trying to prevent a catastrophic meltdown.

Disney Television Animation&#x27;s short series &quot;Chibi Tiny Tales&quot; featured a crossover short of the ride with &quot;Hailey&#x27;s On It!&quot; characters meeting The Abominable Snowman.

<text>A DVD recorder is an optical disc recorder that uses optical disc recording technologies to digitally record analog or digital signals onto blank writable DVD media. Such devices are available as either installable drives for computers or as standalone components for use in television studios or home theater systems.

As of March 1, 2007 all new tuner-equipped television devices manufactured or imported in the United States must include an ATSC tuner. The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has interpreted this rule broadly, including apparatus such as computers with TV tuner cards with video capture ability, videocassette recorders and standalone DVD recorders. NTSC DVD recorders are undergoing a transformation, either adding a digital ATSC tuner or removing over-the-air broadcast television tuner capability entirely. However, these DVD recorders can still record analog audio and analog video.

Standalone DVD recorders, alongside Blu-ray recorders, have been relatively scarce in the United States due largely to &quot;restrictions on video recording&quot; and piracy concerns.

The first DVD recorders appeared on the market in 1999–2000.

==Technical information==

Originally, DVD recorders supported one of three standards: DVD-RAM, DVD-RW (using DVD-VR), and DVD+RW (using DVD+VR), none of which are directly compatible. Most current DVD drives support both the + and - standards, while few support the DVD-RAM standard, which is not directly compatible with standard DVD drives.

Recording speed is generally denoted in values of X (similar to CD-ROM usage), where 1X in DVD usage is equal to 1.321 MB/s, roughly equivalent to a 9X CD-ROM. In practice, this is largely confined to computer-based DVD recorders, since standalone units generally record in real time, that is, 1X speed.

Recorders use a laser (usually 650 nm red) to read and write DVDs. The reading laser is usually not stronger than 5 mW, while the writing laser is considerably more powerful. The faster the writing speed is rated, the stronger the laser. DVD burner lasers often peak at about 100-400 mW in continuous wave (some are pulsed).

==Computer-based DVD (Digital Versatile Disc) drives==

DVD recorder drives are standard equipment in many computer systems on the market, after being initially popularized by the Pioneer/Apple SuperDrive; aftermarket drives can cost as little as $20. DVD recorder drives can be used in conjunction with DVD authoring software to create DVDs near or equal to commercial quality, and are also widely used for data backup and exchange. As a general rule, computer-based DVD recorders can also handle CD-R and CD-RW media; in fact, a number of standalone DVD recorders use drives designed for computers.

More recently, manufacturers have begun to phase out DVD drives from laptop computers in favor of portability and digital media.

Most internal drives are designed with SATA interfaces, with parallel ATA becoming increasingly rare. External drives often use the USB standard for connectivity.

DVD recorder drives manufactured since January 2000 are required by the DVD consortium to respect DVD region codes when reading a disc. The drives are incapable of assigning region codes when writing a disc as this is stored on a part of the disc to which PC based and standalone video recorders do not have write access.

DVD duplication systems are generally built out of stacks of drives, connected through a computer-based backplane.

==Standalone DVD recorders==
When the standalone DVD recorder first appeared on the Japanese consumer market in 1999, early units were very expensive, costing between $2500 and $4000 USD. More recently, DVD recorders from notable brands have dropped in price. Early units supported only DVD-RAM and DVD-R discs, but newer units can record to DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD-R DL and DVD+R DL. Certain models include mechanical hard disk drive-based digital video recorders (DVRs) to improve ease of use. Standalone DVD recorders generally have basic DVD authoring software built in.

In 2009, Panasonic introduced the world&#x27;s first Blu-ray disc recorder which was capable of recording both DVDs and Blu-ray discs and featured built in satellite HDTV tuners. A year later, Panasonic introduced Blu-ray disc recorders with terrestrial HDTV tuners.

DVD recorders have technical advantages over VCRs, including: 

* Superior video and audio quality
* Easy-to-handle smaller form-factor disc media, and higher durability compared to magnetic tape
* Random access to video chapters without rewinding or fast-forwarding (serial access)
* Onscreen multilingual subtitles and labeling not available on VCRs
* No playback wear and tear
* High-quality digital copying, with little or no generational quality loss
* Improved editing on rewritable media
* Playlisting
* No risk of accidentally recording over existing content or unexpectedly running out of space during recording
* Easily accessible recordings as a result of chapter menus

Note: Blu-ray disc recorders can record full high definition videos on BD-Rs and BD-REs.

Disadvantages include: 

* Slow initial access/load times due to the optical nature of the disc
* Limited rewritability on DVD-RW/+RW discs (typically around 1000). DVD-RAM is better suited for high frequency re-recording (around 100,000 rewrites)
* Relatively short life of the laser diodes (average of about 2 years depending on usage).

In addition, DVDs recorded with DVD recorders in the standard DVD format must be finalized to view in other DVD players. This disadvantage does not apply to discs recorded in the newer and more flexible DVD-VR format or the DVD+VR format - the latter (but not the former) also being compatible with DVD players. The implementation of MPEG-2 compression used on most standalone DVD recorders is required to compress the picture data in real time, producing results that may not be up to par with professionally rendered DVD video, which can take days to compress.

Standard definition VCR replacement DVD video recorders typically has a set of standard recording modes for fitting 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 hour modes (XP, SP, LP, EP, SLP, SEP, respectively) on single layer 12 cm discs (DVD5). These modes are comparable to those found on VHS VCRs using standard 120-tapes, having SP, LP, SLP modes of 2, 4, 6 hour.

The United States converted its over-the-air television broadcasts to digital &quot;ATSC&quot; in June 2009. This will have a limited impact in ending the need for DVD recorders to perform realtime MPEG-2 encoding or transcoding. The only setup where ATSC could eliminate MPEG-2 encoding/transcoding in a DVD recorder would be where an antenna is hooked directly into a DVD recorder that has an integrated ATSC tuner. However, the DVD recorder will have to transcode the ATSC MPEG-2 into DVD-Video-compliant MPEG-2 if the ATSC MPEG-2 stream isn&#x27;t already DVD-Video-compatible. This would require transcoding for all high-definition broadcasts and some if not all standard-definition broadcasts. The same general situation applies to digital cable service; only DVD recorders with integrated digital cable (&quot;QAM&quot;) tuners can avoid transcoding, and then only if the digital cable system is already sending a DVD-Video-compatible MPEG-2 stream, which again requires transcoding of all HD content and some if not all SD content. All other setups (digital cable box&#x27;s analog outputs to DVD recorder, satellite box&#x27;s analog outputs to DVD recorder, DVD recorder tuning and recording analog cable channels which are still permitted after 2/2009, etc.) usually always involve an analog step with MPEG-2 encoding being necessary inside the DVD recorder.

A number of manufacturers have combined DVD recorders with mechanical hard disk drive-based digital video recorders, allowing for recording to large fixed disks, and the ability to view these recordings off the hard disk at a later date.

In Japan, AVCREC recorders, which are able to record MPEG-2 or AVC high definition video from ISDB broadcast with or without re-encoding, get increasingly popular. Initially, AVCREC recorders use DVD recordable discs, but newer models are able to record onto Blu-ray discs as well onto hard disk drives.

=== ATSC standalone DVD recorders ===

As a result of the North American digital switchover, tuner-equipped devices manufactured or imported into the United States are now required by the US Federal Communications Commission to include digital tuners.

This has caused most new VHS recorders to be implemented as DVD/VCR combo units, or to be manufactured without tuners. The US requirement of ATSC compatibility forces inclusion of MPEG-2 decoding hardware, which is already part of all DVD players but which otherwise would be unnecessary in an analog-only VCR.

A tunerless recorder does not have RF coaxial connections and can only be used to record from an external device, such as a cable converter box with a composite video output.

An ATSC-capable DVD unit can also serve as a more-powerful alternative to digital television adapters, which allow DTV reception with older NTSC analog televisions. The DVD recorders offer additional capabilities, such as automated VCR-style timeshifting of programming and a variety of output formats, that are deliberately not included in the most common mass-market US ATSC converters.

Unlike the more common digital television adapter boxes, newer DVD recorder units are able to tune both analog and digital signals - an advantage when receiving low-power television and foreign (analogue) signals. Some, however, do suffer from many of the same design limitations as the less costly converter boxes, including poorly designed signal strength meters, incomplete display of broadcast program information, incompatibility with antenna rotators or CEA-909 smart antennas and inability to add digital channels without wiping out all existing channels and rescanning the entire band.

A DVD recording of an over-the-air HDTV broadcast is at DVD resolution, which is inferior to the original broadcast with 720p or 1080i resolution. Some units also provide limited USB or flash memory interface capability, often only supporting viewing of digital camera still photos or playback of MP3s with no ability to write video to these media.

A number of DVD recorders are also capable of recording to SVCD, VCD and Audio CD formats. Recording to DVDs can be done at different speeds that may take between 1 and 6 hours (even up to 8 hours on certain models) on a standard (single sided 12 cm) blank DVD. A trade off exists between recording time and video quality.

=== MiniDVD recorders ===
8 cm miniDVDs are used on some digital camcorders, primarily those meant for a consumer market (&quot;point and shoot&quot;); such discs are usually playable on a full-sized DVD player, but may not record on a full-sized DVD recorder system. Though popular for their convenience (in the manner of VHS-C), DVD camcorders are not suitable for professional use due to higher levels of compression compared to MiniDV and the difficulty of editing MPEG-2 video.

<text>Bernard Vonnegut (August 29, 1914 – April 25, 1997) was an American atmospheric scientist credited with discovering that silver iodide could be used effectively in cloud seeding to produce snow and rain. He was the older brother of American novelist Kurt Vonnegut.

== Early life ==
Vonnegut was born in Indianapolis, Indiana to architect Kurt Vonnegut Sr (November 24, 1884 – October 1, 1957), a partner in the firm of Vonnegut, Wright &amp; Yeager, and homemaker Edith Sophia Lieber (d. May 14, 1944). He was named after his grandfather, architect Bernard Vonnegut Sr, co-founder of the firm of Vonnegut &amp; Bohn. He attended Park School in Indianapolis and earned a B.S. in chemistry (1936) and Ph.D. in physical chemistry (1939) from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

== Professional career ==

In 1945, Vonnegut started work at the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady, New York. It was there, on November 14, 1946, that he discovered that silver iodide could be used as a nucleating agent to seed clouds. Seeding clouds involves inserting large quantities of a nucleating agent into clouds to facilitate the formation of ice crystals. The intent of this process is to cause the clouds to produce rain or snow. Rain- and snow-making companies still use silver iodide as a nucleating agent in seeding clouds.

Vonnegut left General Electric in 1952, taking a job at Arthur D. Little, Inc. In 1967, Vonnegut became a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University at Albany, The State University of New York. He was named a professor emeritus upon his retirement in 1985. In the course of his career Vonnegut accumulated 28 patents.

He was awarded an Ig Nobel Prize in 1997 for his paper &quot;Chicken Plucking as Measure of Tornado Wind Speed.&quot;

== Personal life ==
He was married to Lois Bowler Vonnegut, with whom he had five sons. She died in 1972.

He died of cancer on April 25, 1997, at St. Peter&#x27;s Hospital in Albany, New York.

His brother, Kurt Vonnegut, alluded to Bernard&#x27;s work in some of his works, most famously in &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;.

<doc id="1203937" wikidata="Q1188223" url="?curid=1203937" title="Dance hall">
<text>Dance hall in its general meaning is a hall for dancing, but usually refers to a specific type of twentieth-century venue, with dance clubs (nightclubs) becoming more popular towards the end of the century. The palais de danse was a term applied to purpose-built dance halls in Britain and Commonwealth countries, which became popular after the First World War.

Other structural forms of dance halls include the dance pavilion which has a roof but no walls, and the open-air platform which has no roof or walls. The open-air nature of the dance pavilion was both a feature and a drawback. The taxi dance hall was a dance hall with a specific arrangement, wherein the patrons hire hall employees to dance with them.

==General history==
From the earliest years of the twentieth century until the early 1960s, the dance hall was the popular forerunner of the discothèque or nightclub. The majority of towns and cities in the West had at least one dance hall, and almost always featured live musicians playing a range of music from strict tempo ballroom dance music to big band, swing, and jazz. 

The early days of rock n&#x27; roll were briefly played out in dance halls, until they were superseded by nightclubs.

==United States==

Commercial dance halls in the United States began to appear toward the end of the nineteenth century and grew in popularity at the beginning of the twentieth century. These halls were generally frequented by working-class or immigrant teenagers that admired dance halls for their lack of chaperoning and convenience as cheap commercial leisure. The rapidly changing economy of the early twentieth century shifted the views many young adults had about the separation between work and leisure, increasing dance hall popularity from the 1900s into the 1920s.

With increased financial freedom, as compared to prior decades, young immigrant and working-class women were able to access dance halls, generally placed within urban areas, that did not require chaperones. Dance halls allowed young working-class women the opportunity to step outside of their extremely stressful home and work environments while not costing too much, or anything in some cases. These city dance halls were especially popular with newly independent immigrant women from more rural areas as country-side dances were often more closely monitored and tended to host styles of dancing that were considered more socially acceptable for performance in public spaces. The styles performed in city dance halls had dancing partners physically close, performing movements that would allow for limbs and body parts to graze each other in ways not seen in other partnered dance forms of the time.

Although interests in dance halls were growing, halls attracted negative attention from moral reformers and the media for the types of dancing done at these establishments, the sexual independence these environments allowed women, and the difficulty of regulating dance halls. Simple dance moves were already seen as morally wrong by select religious groups prior to the popularity of dance halls but with the additions of possibilities for prostitution, as well as access to alcohol, within dance halls reformers and religious leaders were increasingly against the existence of these halls. In order to discourage young adults from frequenting dance halls, media of the early twentieth century used subjective and inflammatory language to sway readers toward ideas that dance halls would morally corrupt young women while reformers petitioned to their local governments for regulation surrounding dance halls.

In 1917, with the approval of the vice investigation panel the Fosdick Commission, a committee was organized in Louisville, Kentucky to develop rules and regulations for public dance halls. According to middle- and upper-class white vice investigators and social reformers, many young people, who they believed to be lacking in proper moral character, attempted the &quot;irregular dancing in vogue in the commercial halls&quot; in the settlement house&#x27;s dance hall and would be angered when approached by settlement hall staff or residents instructing them to dance differently. According to one report, &quot;a resident would say to a new couple dancing irregularly, &quot;You can&#x27;t dance that way in this hall.&quot; The couple in self-defense would answer, &quot;I can dance that way in every other hall in the city.&quot;

Starting in the early 1930s, The Savoy, a dance hall in Harlem (a black neighborhood in New York City) was the first truly integrated building in the United States — for both the dancers and the musicians. &quot;We didn&#x27;t care about the color of your skin. All we wanted to know was: Can you dance?&quot;

Texas has a high concentration of community dance halls, the largest number of them built by German and Czech immigrants.

==United Kingdom==
Following World War I in 1918, dancing became enormously popular in Britain, especially with working-class women. The purpose-built dance hall, or &quot;palais de danse&quot; emerged, the first being the Hammersmith Palais in London, opened in 1919.

==Australia==
Dance halls, also termed palais de danse, became popular in Australia too, such as the Palais de Danse and the Wattle Path Palais de Danse, both in St Kilda, Melbourne, Victoria. 

==Sweden and Finland==

In Sweden and Finland, open air dance pavilions have been used mostly in summer, but especially in Finland some have also been built to be used throughout the year. Formerly, the dance pavilions were often built at sites with beautiful landscape, for example by the lakes.

The Sivakan lava dance pavilion in Sivakkavaara, Kaavi, Finland has a history of more than a hundred years, as according to some sources, dances have been held on pavilion since 1907.

<doc id="1203942" wikidata="Q1754335" url="?curid=1203942" title="Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy">
<text>Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy is the ninth studio album by English musician Elton John, released on 23 May 1975 by DJM Records in the UK and MCA Records in the US. The album is an autobiographical account of the early musical careers of Elton John (Captain Fantastic) and his long-term lyricist Bernie Taupin (the Brown Dirt Cowboy). An instant commercial success, the album was certified gold before its release, and reached No. 1 in its first week of release on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the first album to achieve both honours. It sold 1.4 million copies within four days of release, and stayed in the top position in the chart for seven weeks.

Though they would all appear on later albums, this was the last album of the 1970s with the original lineup of the Elton John Band (guitarist Davey Johnstone, bassist Dee Murray, and drummer Nigel Olsson). Murray and Olsson, who had formed John&#x27;s rhythm section since 1970, were fired prior to the recording of the follow-up album &quot;Rock of the Westies&quot;. Johnstone would remain in the band for that album and the subsequent Rock of the Westies Tour, and John&#x27;s 1976 double-album &quot;Blue Moves&quot;, after which he appeared on only one track for &quot;A Single Man&quot;, for the most part playing with other artists until rejoining John for his 1982 Jump Up! Tour. Until 1983&#x27;s &quot;Too Low for Zero&quot;, this was the last album on which Elton John and his classic band played together.

In 2003, the album was ranked number 158 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list.

==History==
Written, according to lyricist Bernie Taupin, in chronological order, &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; is a concept album that gives an autobiographical glimpse at the struggles John (Captain Fantastic) and Taupin (the Brown Dirt Cowboy) had in the early years of their musical careers in London (from 1967 to 1969), leading up to John&#x27;s eventual breakthrough in 1970. The lyrics and accompanying photo booklet are infused with a specific sense of place and time that would otherwise be rare in John&#x27;s music. John composed the music on a ship voyage from the UK to New York.

&quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&quot;, the only single released from the album (and a number 4 hit on the US Pop Singles chart), is a semi-autobiographical story about John&#x27;s disastrous engagement to Linda Woodrow, and his related 1968 suicide attempt. The &quot;Someone&quot; refers to Long John Baldry, who convinced him to break off the engagement rather than ruin his music career for an unhappy marriage. It was viewed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Jon Landau as the best track on the album: &quot;As long as Elton John can bring forth one performance per album on the order of &#x27;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&#x27;, the chance remains that he will become something more than the great entertainer he already is and go on to make a lasting contribution to rock.&quot;

In a 2006 interview with Cameron Crowe, John said, &quot;I&#x27;ve always thought that &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; was probably my finest album because it wasn&#x27;t commercial in any way. We did have songs such as &#x27;Someone Saved My Life Tonight,&#x27; which is one of the best songs that Bernie and I have ever written together, but whether a song like that could be a single these days, since it&#x27;s [more than] six minutes long, is questionable. &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; was written from start to finish in running order, as a kind of story about coming to terms with failure—or trying desperately not to be one. We lived that story.&quot;

John, Taupin and the Elton John Band laboured harder and longer on the album than perhaps any previous record they&#x27;d ever done to that point. As opposed to the rather quick, almost factory-like process of writing and recording an album in a matter of a few days or at most a couple of weeks (as with &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;), the team spent the better part of a month off the road at Caribou Ranch Studios working on the recordings. Producer Gus Dudgeon was apparently also very satisfied with the results. The album&#x27;s producer was quoted in Elizabeth Rosenthal&#x27;s &quot;His Song&quot;, an exhaustive detailed accounting of nearly all John&#x27;s recorded work, as saying he thought &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; was the best the band and John had ever played, lauded their vocal work, and soundly praised John and Taupin&#x27;s songwriting. &quot;There&#x27;s not one song on it that&#x27;s less than incredible,&quot; Dudgeon said.

===Sequel===
The 2006 album &quot;The Captain &amp; the Kid&quot; is the sequel, and continues the autobiography where &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; leaves off.

==Cover art==
The intricate cover art was designed by pop artist Alan Aldridge, drawing fantastic imagery from the Renaissance painting &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot; by Hieronymus Bosch. The original LP package also included two booklets; a &quot;Lyrics&quot; booklet which contained an uncompleted lyric for &quot;Dogs in the Kitchen&quot; that did not appear on the album, and another booklet called &quot;Scraps&quot;, which collected photos and snippets of reviews, personal diary entries and other memorabilia of John and Taupin during the years that are chronicled on the album. The original LP also contained a poster of the album&#x27;s cover.

In 1976, Bally released a Capt. Fantastic pinball machine with artwork by Dave Christensen of Elton John in his &quot;pinball wizard&quot; character from the movie &quot;Tommy&quot;. In 1977, Bally released a &quot;home model&quot; version with artwork by Alan Aldridge.

==Release and critical reception==

The album reached number 1 in its first week of release on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the first ever album to do so, reportedly selling 1.4 million copies within 4 days of release, and it stayed in that position in the chart for seven weeks. It was certified gold based on pre-release orders in early May 1975, two weeks before it was even officially released, and was certified platinum and triple platinum in March 1993 by the RIAA.

In Canada, it also debuted at number 1 on the &quot;RPM&quot; national Top Albums chart and only broke a run of what would have been fifteen consecutive weeks at the top by falling one position to number 2 in the ninth week (31 May–6 September). On the UK Albums Chart, it peaked at number 2.

In 2003, the album was ranked at number 158 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list.

==Later releases==
A deluxe 30th anniversary edition CD was released September 2005, containing the complete album and adding &quot;House of Cards&quot;, the B-side to the 7&quot; single of &quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight.&quot; Recorded during the sessions for &quot;Caribou&quot;, &quot;House of Cards&quot; previously only appeared on CD on the 1992 &quot;Rare Masters&quot; collection. Also included is a second disc containing the complete album performed live at Wembley Stadium on 21 June 1975.

In September 2005, Elton John and his band again performed the entire album (minus &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; and &quot;Writing&quot;) in a series of sold-out concerts in Boston, New York City and the tour&#x27;s final stop, Atlanta, in October. These &quot;Captain Fantastic Concerts&quot; were a part of the Peachtree Road Tour and were the longest concerts in Elton&#x27;s career, many lasting at least three-and-a-half hours. The songs from &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; were aired by Capital Gold Radio in a broadcast taken from 16 September 2005 performance in Boston.

&quot;Curtains&quot;, among other songs from the album, was sampled in Pnau&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Good Morning to the Night&quot;.

&quot;We All Fall in Love Sometimes&quot; was covered by Jeff Buckley. It was also covered by Coldplay for the 2018 tribute album &quot;&quot;.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, except where noted.

Note: On the original DJM Records CD version, &quot;We All Fall in Love Sometimes&quot; and &quot;Curtains&quot; are both combined into one track, making it a nine-track album. On all other CD versions (MCA Records, Polydor and French label Carrere Records), the two tracks are separated.

<doc id="1203954" wikidata="Q6433358" url="?curid=1203954" title="Belote">
<text>Belote () is a 32-card, trick-taking, ace–ten game played primarily in France and certain European countries, namely Armenia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Georgia (mainly Guria), Greece, Luxembourg, Moldova, North Macedonia (mainly Bitola), Bosnia and Herzegovina and also in Saudi Arabia and Tunisia. It is one of the most popular card games in those countries, and the national card game of France, both casually and in gambling. It appeared around 1900 in France, and is a close relative of both Klaberjass (also known as bela) and klaverjas. Closely related games are played throughout the world. Definitive rules of the game were first published in French in 1921.

Within the game&#x27;s terminology, &quot;belote&quot; is used to designate a pair of a king and a queen of a trump suit, possibly yielding the game&#x27;s name itself.

Variations on the game include belot in eastern Europe, baloot in Saudi Arabia, and pilotta in Cyprus.

==Deck==
Much like Skat, German-style cards are used widely in former Yugoslav countries as well as Germany (mostly in Bavaria) for playing this card game while French-style cards are used widely in French-speaking countries for playing this card game. Belote is played with a deck of 32 cards (A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7)

==Rules==
The game is played differently in different locations, but most versions share a considerable set of common rules. The rules below describe the common version of this game.
A typical 32-card piquet deck is used, 4 suits with 8 ranks, or {} × {A K Q J 10 9 8 7}, and is not shuffled between games. The game is mostly played by four people, but versions exist for five, three and two players, including a non-trivial two-player &quot;open cards&quot; version. Players form two teams in the usual 4 players version: north–south and east–west, and playing in turn in counterclockwise direction.

===Dealing===
The deck is never shuffled, but rather cut by the player who precedes the dealer, except for the first dealing in a game when the dealer&#x27;s partner does that. The first dealing in a game is done by the winners from the previous game. At least three cards must be cut.

The cards are dealt counter-clockwise starting from the dealer&#x27;s successor (to their right), each player receives a packet of three cards, then another set of two. The rest of the cards remain temporarily face-down. If a contract is agreed upon, the remaining cards are dealt after the bidding – a group of three for each player except the player who got the card that was in the middle, who gets two.

===Bidding===
The possible contracts are:

* Clubs 
* Diamonds 
* Hearts 
* Spades 
* &quot;No trumps&quot;
* &quot;All trumps&quot;

Every player must either suggest a higher contract, or bid:

* Pass
* Double (&quot;coinchée&quot;, or &quot;contré&quot;), if the current highest contract was not bid by the partner
* Re-double (&quot;re-contra&quot;), if the other team have doubled bidder&#x27;s or bidder partner&#x27;s contract.

Usually two levels of doubling are allowed.

When doubling any contract, not only a bid in &quot;all trumps&quot;, two levels are allowed. Some play it with a third level of doubling, which puts the whole match at stake. 
The bidding phase is over when one of the following becomes true:

* Four passes were announced, thus the cards are collected and the dealer cuts the deck for the next player
* Three passes were announced after a contract was suggested
* An &quot;all trumps&quot; contract is re-doubled

===Play===
The play consists of eight tricks, the first one being started by the dealer&#x27;s successor.
The first player in a round can play any card, but subsequent players must obey the following rules (the first one which applies is binding):

# The dominant suit must be followed.
# If the player cannot follow the dominant suit, they must play a trump card, except when the current trick winner is their partner.
# Played trump cards must always be of a higher-rank (if possible) than other played trump cards, except when the current trick winner is the player&#x27;s partner. In the &quot;all trumps&quot; contract, a player who cannot follow the dominant suit may play any other card.
# If a player cannot follow the dominant suit and cannot (or is not required to) play a trump card, they may play any other card.

The winner of the trick is the highest ranked card in the dominant suit. If trumps were played, the winner is the highest-ranked trump instead. In an &quot;all trumps contract&quot;, the winner is the highest ranked trump of the dominant suit.

The winner of a trick starts the next trick. The last trick is a bit more significant, as its winner is awarded some points.

The rank of the cards is different for trump and non-trump suits. The order is (from highest to lowest rank):

* In a trump suit: J 9 A 10 K Q 8 7
* In a non-trump suit: A 10 K Q J 9 8 7

===Declarations===
Declarations (melding) must be announced during the first trick:

* A &quot;tierce&quot; – a sequence of three (sequences are in the &quot;A K Q J 10 9 8 7&quot; order of the same suit) – is worth 20 points.
* A &quot;quarte&quot; – a sequence of four – is worth 50 points.
* A &quot;quinte&quot; – a sequence of five – is worth 100 points (longer sequences are not awarded, a sequence of eight is counted as a quinte plus a tierce).
* A &quot;carré&quot; – 4 of the same rank – of Jacks is worth 200 points.
* A &quot;carré&quot; of nines is worth 150 points.
* A &quot;carré&quot; of aces, kings, queens, or tens is worth 100 points (sevens and eights are not awarded).

It is sufficient to specify the type of a declaration (one of the above), whereas the exact suit or ranks are not required. A card can participate in at most one declaration.

A belote is a &quot;royal&quot; pair of a king and a queen of a trump suit. A belote is worth 20 points, and must be declared when the first of them is played (not necessarily during the first round).

In a &quot;no trumps&quot; contract declarations do not apply (four aces may be considered as a &quot;carré&quot; of jacks and worth 200 points, but no other bonuses are applied.)

===Scoring===
Each card rank has a specific scoring value; for Jacks and Nines the value depends on whether the suit is trump or not. The winner of the last trick gets 10 points.

Declarations, including belotes, are added to the score. If the contract was &quot;no trumps&quot;, the result is multiplied by two, as it is for every &quot;double&quot; bid. If a team is &quot;committed&quot; to a contract and has less points, all points go to the opponents, and the losing team are said to be &quot;inside&quot; or the French equivalent, &quot;être dedans&quot;. In a doubled contract, both teams are considered committed.

The result is divided by ten, rounded, and added to the global score. The rounding is somewhat complicated as the sum of points is a multiple of ten only for a &quot;No trumps&quot; contract. It is 258 for &quot;All trumps&quot; and 162 for a suit contract. Therefore, the rounding limit is 5 in a &quot;No trumps&quot; contract, 4 in an &quot;All trumps&quot;, and 6 in a suit contract.

* A score below the limit is rounded down. Example: 35 points in a suit contract yields 3 match points;
* A score above the limit is rounded up. Example: 125 points in an &quot;All trumps&quot; contract yields 13 MPs; 54 points in a &quot;No trumps&quot; contract yields 11MPs;
* When both teams have scores at the rounding limit, the lower score is rounded up and the higher score is rounded down. Example: if in an &quot;All trumps&quot; contract with two tierces the declarers have 154 points and the defenders have 144 points, both teams will get 15 MPs and it would be a narrow escape.
* When both teams have equal scores at the end of the round, the points are &quot;hanging&quot;. What happens in this case is the following: the committed team doesn&#x27;t add those points to their score, while the other team does. The remaining points (those that were not added by the committed team) &quot;hang&quot; over to the next round and they are given to the team that wins.

A special &quot;valat&quot; (or &quot;capot&quot;) premium of 9 match points exists for not leaving a single trick for the opponents. Note, that this does not lift off the opponent&#x27;s points from declaration. Valats are doubled at &quot;no trumps&quot;. If there is a valat in a doubled contract, the winning team&#x27;s points are doubled.

The first team to reach 151 in the global score is the winner, but the game cannot end while a &quot;valat&quot; takes place.

==French belote==
This part describes the main differences between the classic French rules and the ones above.

===Dealing===
After the four players receive the first five cards, the remaining cards are left face down except the card on the top, which is turned face up.

===Bidding===
The biddings are made in two rounds.
During the first round each player must either pass or accept the card face up. Doing so will set the cards of the same suit as the face up card as trumps.
If every player passed, another round is made. The players can propose another card suit as trumps, but must take the face up card.
As soon as a player has accepted the card, the remaining cards are dealt :
*2 cards for the player who took the card
*3 cards for the 3 other players

===Scoring===
To score the points for a game, the team of the player who accepted the face up card must score more than the other team. Otherwise, the other team wins all the points.
Generally, this means a team needs to score at least 81 as there are a total of 162 points in the game. However, bonus points won from belote or declarations might be taken into account.

== Belot ==
Belot (commonly abbreviated as bela, Armenian &quot;blot&quot;) is a 32-card game variant of belote for two to four players. Traditionally it is played with a French-suited or German-suited playing cards and is particularly popular in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Arabia. It is still played in some states of the former Soviet Union (e.g. Russia or Ukraine) and by communities of the Armenian diaspora and Jewish communities around the world. In this game, however, there are relatively different interpretations of the rules, so that one cannot speak of a fixed, uniform ruleset. The rules are almost identical to the French national card game belote and it is thus an Eastern European variant of the large &quot;Jass&quot; family.

The rules of belot are close to those of belote, and its ancestor, Klaberjass, but with a few significant differences in each. The game is played by 2, 3 or 4 players. The 4-player version is considered the standard game, and other two are truncated versions played only if there aren&#x27;t enough players available. The 4 players are 2 teams of two. The other variations each player is alone. 2 player and 3 players use the 24-card deck (9 to Ace). 
Note that these rules are slightly different among countries.

Each round of belot (no matter how many players) consists of these steps: dealing, bidding, declaration, playing and scoring:

===Dealing and bidding===
The game is played with a 32-card (A K Q J 10 9 8 7) German-suited pack which is first shuffled by dealer and then offered to the person sitting to the left of the dealer to cut. The cutter may cut or just tap on the top of the pack in which case no cutting is done. Cards are dealt three at a time, counter-clockwise beginning to the right of dealer. Initially only 6 cards are dealt.

The possible bidding or contracts are:

* Clubs ♣
* Diamonds ♦
* Hearts ♥
* Spades ♠
* No trumps
* All trumps
Every player must either suggest a higher contract, or bid:

* Pass
* Double (Coinchée, or Contré), but only if the current highest contract was not bid by the partner.
* Re-double (Re-contra), if the other team have doubled bidder&#x27;s or bidder partner&#x27;s contract.
Usually two levels of doubling are allowed. In some areas of Bulgaria a third level is also used. It is called &quot;сюр-контра&quot; (Sur-Contre - derived from French; over-double), &quot;чаршаф-контра&quot; (bed sheet-double) or &quot;излез-контра&quot; (go out-double) and the aim is to win the whole match in a single game (26 MP x 8, see section Scoring below). 
Note that if a player/team is afraid to play a doubled game, they can bid different colour suit. The higher contract will be in all trumps and can not be escaped.

The bidding phase is over when one of the following becomes true:

* Four passes were announced
* Three passes were announced after a contract was suggested
* An &quot;all trumps&quot; contract is re-doubled

Every next dealing is done by the player on the right of the previous dealer (so whoever bid first, deals the next game).

Particulars for the 2, 3, and 4-player games:

====2 players====
The two-handed version (known as белот на две ръце in Bulgarian), the first 6 cards are picked up by the players and bidding begins, starting from the player who didn&#x27;t deal. The player looks at their 6 cards and proposes (chooses a trump suit based on the cards) or passes (says &quot;pass&quot;), in which case the other player has the right to bid up or pass. If both players passed the deal is over, cards are shuffled by the non-dealer and he deals. If a contract is agreed, another 3 cards are dealt. Total of 18 cards are in use, and the 6 left are not needed, and nobody can look in them.

Another variation exists (known in Bulgaria as Open Belot (Открит Белот)). Full 32 card deck is used. It is played by dealing first three cards to each player then another two. After that and before the bidding additional 4 cards for each player are placed face-down on the table, and on top of them 4 cards placed face-up. The dealing of these cards is similar to Poker (one card is dealt at a time to each player). After all cards are dealt there are 6 cards in total left which will be dealt after the bidding unless both players say &#x27;pass&#x27;. 
The rules of play and counting are like standard 4-player belot with one exception each player is allowed to play all cards in his possession that are in his hands or faced up on the table. After a player plays a faced up card from the table (thus exposing the card below) the player then turns the exposed card face up. All additional points including declaring belot (king and queen) is made of cards of both hands and the face-up cards from the table. That includes if face-down cards that are turned up (e.g. Queen and King of the Trump) the player is allowed to declare Belot.

====3 players====
Every player receives 3 cards face down, then another 2 cards (making total of 5).
The player on dealer&#x27;s right bids (chooses a trump suit) or says pass. The next player has the right to take it up or pass. If all players passed the deal is over, cards are shuffled by the player on the right and he deals. If a contract is agreed, another 3 cards are dealt. Total of 8xasba 
24 cards are in use, and every player plays for himself.

====4 players====
Every player receives 3 cards face down, then 2 more cards (making total of 5).

The first 5 cards are picked up by players and bidding begins starting from first player on dealers right (everything except cutting in Belot is done counter-clockwise). The Player assesses their 5 cards and takes (chooses a trump suit) or passes (says &quot;pass&quot;) in which case next player has a right to bid up or pass, and so on. If everybody before dealer passed, dealer must take (choose) a trump suit, although this rule is a rarity. In some cases, like Croatia for example; the dealer hands out three cards followed by another three cards and the last two cards are kept face down until the trump suit has been declared or the player passes. Some versions of Belot rules say dealer can cancel the round (and the next player starts as dealer) if he is to pass and he has 7 points or less in their hand, or even without the 7 point limit (if dealer passes, the round is canceled).

When trump suit is chosen (from the 6 option above), players can get the remaining 3 cards, so every player has 8 cards in their hand.

In most games the last 3 cards are dealt after the bidding to avoid cheating, but can be dealt with the first 5 and not touched.

=== Declarations (announcements) ===

Declarations are particular sets of cards held in players&#x27; hands, which give players extra points if announced. There are three sorts of declarations:

4 cards of the same rank, called &quot;square&quot;
* 4 Jacks: 200 points
* 4 nines: 150 points
* 4 Aces, Ks, Qs and tens (like in all declarations, 10s are weaker than Qs): 100 points
(4 sevens and 4 eights are not awarded)

Sequences from 3 to 8 cards of the same suit. The cards are ranked as follows: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7
* 3 cards (A tierce): 20 points
* 4 cards (A quarte): 50 points
* 5 cards (A quinte): 100 points

Sequences of 6 or 7 cards of the same suit are declared and counted as the highest one of the 5-card sequences which they include. 8-card sequence is counted as 3 cards and 5 cards.

These above must be declared during the first two hands being played.

&quot;Belot&quot;, &quot;bela&quot;, or in Bulgarian &quot;белот&quot; is king and queen of any trump suit held together in one player&#x27;s hand. The player holding them receives 20 points. This is not a regular declaration; it is counted separately and it is declared &quot;bela&quot; once the player is playing the first card out of those two. When they play the second card, they can declare: &quot;from the bela&quot;. Belot can be declared only in three circumstances – when the player is first in a hand; when they are trumping another suit; and when they are replying to their parther in the same suit. Note that declaring belot is not obligatory, a player can keep it quiet if the game is developing badly for him. See scoring below.

When the one team holds square, the other teams can score sequences from 3 to 8 cards of the same suit and belots.

Between equally long sequences, declared by opposing teams, the one containing the higher ranked cards wins. If there are two or more opposing sequences of equal rank, they are all void.

A particular card may or may not be involved in two or more declarations. This rule is sometimes set and sometimes isn&#x27;t, depending on the local rules. Bela isn&#x27;t included in this rule, cards making bela can always be included in another declaration.

A player declares when he plays the first hand. If a player has nothing to declare he simply plays their first card. If player has something to declare, he declares it when it&#x27;s their turn to play their first card. It is sufficient to specify the type of a declaration (one of the above), whereas the exact suit or ranks are not required. The question of which are the highest declarations is settled when the game finishes.

In a no trumps game there are no declarations, not even belot.

===Playing===

The player to dealer&#x27;s right plays their card first. The subsequent players must follow suit if they can. If a player can&#x27;t follow suit he must play trump card. If he can&#x27;t play trump either, he plays any suit.

If the first card played is trump, subsequent players must follow suit and also play a trump card that beats all previous cards if they can. It is called raising and applies only for trump suits. If non-trump was played first, and then trump, the player on turn needs to follow the suit of the first card played and doesn&#x27;t have to trump the card that beats the first one. The player who won the hand or trick collects the cards played in this trick and plays first in next hand/trick.

If any of the above rules is broken, the opponent/opponents gets/get 162 or 258 points (which is sum of all card values) + all declarations declared in this round (no matter who declared) and current round ends. Two accidents like this can ruin the match.

===Scoring===
Every player/team counts the points he has from the tricks he won.

The winner of last trick adds 10 points.

The player or team is allowed to add points retrieved from only if they won at least one trick. Exception is the points from Belot which are always awarded.

Each card rank has a specific scoring value; for Jacks and Nines the value depends on whether the suit is trump or not. Jack is 20 points trump and 2 points non-trump. 9 has 14 points for trump suit and zero for non-trump. Queen is 3, King is four, 10 is 10 and Ace is 11. 7 and 8s does not count.

Declarations, including belotes, are added to the score. Remember that in a no trumps game there are no declarations, not even belot. If the contract was no trumps, the result is multiplied by two. So is done for every double bid. If a team bid the contract and has less points, all points go to the opposing team, and the losing team in Bulgarian belote are said to be &quot;вътре&quot; (inside) similar to the French equivalent &quot;être dedans&quot;. In a doubled contract, both teams are considered committed.

A special valat (or capot) premium of 9 Match Points exists for not leaving a single trick for the opposing side. It is not doubled even if the contract is doubled.

The result is divided by ten, rounded, and added up to the global score sheet. This is measured in Match Points (MPs). The rounding is somewhat complicated as the sum of points is a multiple of ten only for a &quot;No trumps&quot; contract, which is 130x2=260 total. It is 258 for &quot;All trumps&quot; and 162 for a suit contract. Therefore, the rounding limit is 5 in a &quot;No trumps&quot; contract, 4 in an &quot;All trumps&quot;, and 6 in a suit contract. 
The total of Match Points in a game is therefore at least 16 points for a suit contract and 26 for all-trump. Declarations and valat can increase it. The no-trump game has no declaration points and is always 26 MPs.

A score below the limit is rounded down. Example: 125 points in a suit contract yields 12 Match Points; 
A score above the limit is rounded up. Example: 125 points in an &quot;All trumps&quot; contract yields 13 MPs; 54 points in a &quot;No trumps&quot; contract yields 11MPs;

The funniest sentences can be heard around the table &quot;65 plus 14 and the last 10 makes 9&quot;!!
When both teams have scores at the rounding limit, the lower score is rounded up and the higher score is rounded down. Example: if in an &quot;All trumps&quot; contract with two tierces the declarer have got 154 points and the defenders have got 144 points, both teams will get 15 MPs and it would be a narrow escape. 
When both teams have equal scores at the end of the round, the points are &quot;hanging&quot;. What happens in this case is the following: the committed team doesn&#x27;t add those points to their score, while the other team do. The remaining points (those that were not added by the committed team) &quot;hang&quot; over to the next round and they are given to the team that wins.

In some parts of Bulgaria, the rules of the game include a kirtik, which is a special −10 match points penalty for not winning when committed or for being valat.

===Winning===

The game score is kept on paper - the Match Points are recorded on a sheet of paper. The paper is divided in two columns - We and You.
To win a round or a small game, also called a single deal the team or player who bid the contract must score more points.
If the team who bid the contract won it, all teams/players score the number of points each of them collected through scoring.

If team who bid lost it, the other team wins the number of points both teams collected through scoring and the bidding team scores zero (which is marked by a dash (-), not by a number (0)).

The first team to reach 151 Match Points in the global score is the winner, but the global game cannot end if a valat takes place. Then another round/deal must be played.

The current reigning champions are the Bulgarians Enio Nakov and Ivelin Spasov. They are the youngest players to earn the championship rings, and have been able to successfully defend the title over the last several years. They both currently reside in the US, where their charitable work has helped spread the popularity of the game.

===Card values (points)===

Note that the sequence for declarations, which differs from that for scoring, is : A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7.

<doc id="1203955" wikidata="Q2630747" url="?curid=1203955" title="Colt Cobra">
<text>The Colt Cobra is a lightweight, aluminum-framed, double-action short-barrelled revolver, not to be confused with the Colt King Cobra. The Cobra was chambered in .38 Special, .38 Colt New Police, .32 Colt New Police, and .22 Long Rifle. It holds six shots of ammunition and was sold by Colt from 1950 until 1981. In December 2016, it was announced that Colt would be producing new run Colt Cobras with a steel frame and a fiber optic front sight. This model was released in early 2017.

==Product development and usage==
The Cobra was made in three models: the First Model, made from 1950–1971 and weighing 15 ounces unloaded with 2-inch barrel, and an improved Second Model, made from 1972–1981, recognizable by its shrouded ejector rod and Baughman-style ramp front sight, with an unloaded weight of 16 ounces. The third issue debuted from 2017 in stainless steel finishes and are rated for 38 +P Spl. cartridges. None of the Cobra models are rated for 38 +P+ Spl cartridges. 

The Cobra is the same overall size and configuration as the famous Colt Detective Special and uses the same size &quot;D&quot; frame, except that the Cobra&#x27;s frame is constructed of lightweight aluminum alloy as compared to the all-steel frame of the Detective Special. In the mid-1960s, the Detective Special&#x27;s and Cobra&#x27;s grip frame was shortened to the same size as that of the Agent.

The Cobra was produced in calibers .38 Special, 32 Colt New Police, .22 LR, and a rare few in .38 S&amp;W. The .38 Special Cobra was available in 2, 3 and 4 inch barrel lengths. The .32 caliber version was available in 2- and 3-inch barrel lengths. The .22 LR Cobra was available only with the 3-inch barrel.

Standard Cobras were blued with round-butt grip frames. All Cobras were available with a nickel finish at additional cost. Early model 1st issue series was supplied as square-butt grip.
It was announced in 2016 that Colt would re-release the Colt Cobra in 2017. The Third Model (2017–present) is offered only as a 6 shot double action/single action revolver in .38 Special (+P Capable) with a 2&quot; barrel. This model will be offered with a Matte Stainless Steel finish and has an unloaded weight of 25 ounces. At the 2018 Shot Show, Colt debuted the Colt Night Cobra, which has a matte black finish and a front night sight. It is also double action only.
==Production subvariants==
===Colt &quot;Aircrewman&quot;===
The &quot;Colt M13 Aircrewman&quot; was an ultra-lightweight version of the Detective Special constructed of aluminum alloy, and made from 1951 to 1957 for use by United States Air Force aircrews. They are distinguished by the Air Force medallion in place of the Colt medallion on the checkered wooden grips, as well as a cylinder made of aluminum alloy. Within two years of issuance, reports of cylinder and/or frame failure began to plague the Aircrewman and its Smith &amp; Wesson counterpart, the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 12, despite issuing a dedicated low-pressure .38 Special military cartridge, the &quot;Caliber .38 Ball, M41&quot; round. However, the cylinder fractures continued, and the weapons were eventually withdrawn from service.

===Colt &quot;Courier&quot;===
The &quot;Courier&quot; was a 3-inch variant of the Cobra with a special, short grip frame. It was produced in both .22 Long Rifle and .32 Colt New Police. The frame and cylinder of the .32 model are constructed of lightweight aluminum alloy, and the gun weighs 13.5 ounces. Only the frame of the .22 model was constructed of aluminum alloy, with a total weight of 19.5 ounces. It was made from 1954 to 1956. Approximately 3,053 were produced in the two years. The .32 Courier remains as the only commercially produced Colt to ever have an alloy cylinder.

===Colt &quot;Agent&quot;===
The Colt &quot;Agent&quot; was another model similar to the Cobra. The original Agents were very well made, with high polished finishes and highly checkered walnut grips. The bottom of the Agent grips was slightly shorter than that of the Cobra. The original Agent weighed 14 ounces and was available only in .38 Special caliber, with a 2-inch barrel and blued finish. It was made from 1955 to 1979. The original Agents had a smaller grip frame from the Cobra which made for a deeper concealment and the grip frame was later changed to match the Cobra in the late 60s. A slightly revised version of the Agent was released in 1973 with a shrouded ejector rod, with a weight of 16 ounces. In 1982, the Agent was briefly revived by Colt, this time with a parkerized finish; production continued until 1986, which made the Agent a much cheaper version of the Cobra.

===Colt &quot;Viper&quot;===
The Viper was essentially a 4-inch barreled version of the alloy-framed Colt Cobra in .38 Special. Introduced in 1977 and only produced that year, the Viper did not sell as well as Colt expected and was discontinued. In recent years, owing to its limited production run, the Viper has become quite collectable. Examples in good condition fetch unusually high prices. In 2024, Colt reintroduced the Viper, with similar wood grips to the original. However, apart from cosmetic resemblance, the new Viper has little in common with the original. The new Viper, like the new Cobra, is made from a steel frame, but unlike the new Cobra, the new Viper is chambered in .357 Magnum. The new Viper is also available in 3-inch and 4.25-inch barrel lengths.

==Ammunition==
Some have recommended against the use of +P-rated .38 Special cartridges in aluminum-framed Colt revolvers, as the Cobra was designed well before the &quot;+P&quot; designation. Others point out that +P ammunition is the same pressure as the regular pressure ammunition was before SAAMI lowered the standards in 1972 as a result of industry requests. They point out that the post-&#x27;72 loads are merely regular pressure ammunition labeled as &quot;+P&quot;. Some experts have done considerable testing so as to prove that +P .38 specials are not truly hot loads.

In the owners&#x27; manual accompanying some post-1972 Cobra revolvers, Colt recommended the use of +P ammunition for 2nd Model Cobra frames only, with the stipulation that the gun be returned to the factory for inspection every 1,000 rounds (compared with a 2,000–3,000 round interval for the 2nd Model steel-framed Detective Special).

The new 2017 reintroduction Colt Cobra revolver is rated to accept +P ammunition.

The Cobra should never be fired with extreme-pressure +P+ ammunition as there are no industry standards for such loads.

<text>Denis Michael Rohan (1 July 1941 - 20 March 2013) was an Australian arsonist responsible for the Al-Aqsa mosque fire, which took place in Jerusalem on 21 August 1969.

His attack on Al-Aqsa Mosque, which began after he set fire to the Minbar of Saladin, inflamed tensions across the Muslim world and triggered the most high-level crisis in the Middle East since the 1967 Arab–Israeli War. 

Rohan was arrested by Israeli authorities on 23 August 1969; he was tried in Israel, found to be insane, and subsequently admitted to a mental institution. On 14 May 1974, Rohan was deported to Australia &quot;on humanitarian grounds, for further psychiatric treatment near his family&quot; and transferred to the Callan Park Hospital for the Insane on the outskirts of Sydney. Some sources claimed that he had died on 6 October 1995, but a 2009 investigation by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) found that he was still alive. Rohan also spoke to an ABC journalist a few years after the findings, but died on 20 March 2013.

==Mental illness and religious convictions==
According to a detailed article by Abraham Rabinovich, Rohan&#x27;s first known case of auditory hallucinations (which he believed to be divine &quot;revelations&quot;) came in Australia in 1964, when he was asked by his employer to transport &quot;an augur, a 30-foot-long lift device&quot; by truck 35 miles to another location, but was commanded by a voice in his head not to do so. His manager told him he was &quot;mentally sick&quot;, and he was committed to Bloomfield Mental Hospital for four months. After his release he moved first to England where he worked at a hospital in Middlesex, and then to Israel where he arrived by ship in March 1969. He volunteered at Mishmar Hasharon kibbutz in the Sharon Valley between Haifa and Tel Aviv where he stayed a few months. According to kibbutzniks, one night they were startled by wild shouts from Rohan; when one volunteer attempted to calm him, Rohan told them he thought that perhaps he was Jewish. He spoke to an American theology student and volunteer of &quot;the imminence of the Messiah&#x27;s coming and the construction of a new temple&quot;.

From the kibbutz he went to Jerusalem, staying in hotels. After reading a biblical passage in the Book of Zechariah: 
Behold the man whose name is the branch, for he shall grow up in his place and he shall build the Temple of the Lord. It is he who shall build the Temple of the Lord and shall bear royal honor and shall sit and rule upon the throne.
Rohan became convinced that he was &quot;the branch&quot; and destined to &quot;build the Temple of the Lord&quot;.

==1969 attack on Al-Aqsa Mosque==
On the morning of 21 August 1969, Rohan started a fire fuelled by kerosene in the al-Aqsa Mosque. The fire destroyed an intricately designed 12th-century minbar, or pulpit, known as the minbar of Saladin. 

Rohan, who had been in Israel on a tourist visa, was arrested two days later. He pleaded insanity and was deported.

Rohan, a Christian, stated that he considered himself &quot;the Lord&#x27;s emissary&quot; and that he tried to destroy the al-Aqsa Mosque acting upon divine instructions to enable the Jews of Israel to rebuild the Temple on the Temple Mount in accordance with the Book of Zechariah, thereby hastening the second coming of Jesus Christ. Rohan mistakenly believed that the al-Aqsa Mosque occupied the site of the temple, when in fact the Dome of the Rock did. The mosque was instead built on the foundations of a Herodian basilica called the Royal Stoa.

Rohan was a subscriber of &quot;The Plain Truth&quot; magazine published by the Worldwide Church of God&#x27;s (WCG) founder Herbert W. Armstrong and stated that he had begun his attempt after reading an editorial by Armstrong in the June 1967 edition. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper in London pictured Rohan on its front page with a copy of &quot;The Plain Truth&quot; magazine sticking out from his outside jacket pocket. 

On 26 September 1969, Armstrong, in a letter to financial contributors to his &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; program, distanced himself from Rohan: 

Prior to the Rohan incident, in 1968 Armstrong, via WCG&#x27;s sponsored Ambassador College, had become involved with the Israeli government in archaeological digs in the area of the Temple Mount.

===Allegations of Israeli complicity===
Many Muslims alleged Rohan&#x27;s actions were part of a wider plot by Israelis, 
while some Israelis have attacked widely-repeated claims by some Palestinians and other Muslims that Rohan was Jewish, when in fact he was Christian. 
Palestinian officials have alleged that the arson was carried out with the blessing of Israeli authorities and minimize the culpability of Rohan, while Israeli firefighters at the scene later complained that the hostility directed at them by an assembled crowd of Palestinians interfered with their ability to put out the fire.

<text>Raymond James Martin (born August 8, 1941) is a politician in Alberta, Canada and former member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta.

Martin served four terms as an Alberta MLA and two terms as an Edmonton Public School Board Trustee. In 2018, Martin published his memoir, &quot;Made in Alberta: The Ray Martin Story.&quot;

== Early life ==

Born in 1941 in Delia, Alberta, Martin attended the University of Alberta in Edmonton. He was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity. He later attended the University of Calgary in order to earn his master&#x27;s degree.

He taught in Edmonton public schools.

== Provincial politics ==

Martin ran for a seat in the 1975 Alberta general election in Calgary and in 1979 in Edmonton-Norwood but both times was unsuccessful.

Martin ran again in Edmonton-Norwood in 1982 provincial election. This time he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta to join Grant Notley in a two-member Alberta New Democratic Party (NDP) caucus. At the time, the two NDP-ers and two Independent members were the only opposition MLAs in the Legislature, sitting in opposition to more than 70 Conservative MLAs. Martin was the first NDP MLA elected in Edmonton since the end of the use of single transferable voting in Edmonton back in 1956.

He became leader of the Alberta NDP in 1984, succeeding Grant Notley after his death in a plane crash.

Martin led the party to a highwater mark (at the time) winning 16 seats in the 1986 provincial election, making him leader of the opposition in the legislature. Still under Ray&#x27;s leadership, the NDP took that same number of seats in the 1989 election.

In 1993, none of the party&#x27;s sitting MLAs were re-elected. Martin was defeated in his constituency, Edmonton-Norwood, by Liberal Andrew Beniuk.

He quit the party&#x27;s leadership in 1994, being replaced by former NDP MP Ross Harvey

After an absence of eleven years, Martin returned to the Legislature as the NDP Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Edmonton-Beverly-Clareview in the 2004 general election.

He was defeated in 2008 by Progressive Conservative Tony Vandermeer.

Martin ran again for the NDP in the 2012 provincial election, in the riding of Edmonton-Glenora. He was defeated by Progressive Conservative Heather Klimchuk.

== Municipal politics ==

In the 2001 Edmonton municipal election, Martin won election as the Edmonton Public School Board Trustee for Ward D. He did not seek re-election to this role in the 2004 election.

In the 2013 Edmonton municipal election, Martin once again won election as the Edmonton Public School Board Trustee for Ward D. He did not seek re-election in the 2017 election.

== Federal politics ==

In 2003, Martin supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party.

Ray Martin has run and lost in four federal elections, each time as an NDP candidate. He ran in the 1997, 2000, 2008, and 2011 federal elections, in Edmonton North, Edmonton Centre-East, and Edmonton East (twice), respectively.

Released less than five months after his previous album, &quot;Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy&quot;, &quot;Rock of the Westies&quot; repeated that album&#x27;s then-unprecedented feat of entering the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number one, and was John&#x27;s final chart-topping studio album in that country. It was also successful (albeit to a lesser extent) in the artist&#x27;s home territory of the UK, where it reached No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart. Robert Christgau ranked it as No. 7 on his list of the best albums of 1975.

==History==
&quot;Rock of the Westies&quot; contained the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 No. 1 (No. 14 UK singles chart) single, &quot;Island Girl&quot;, which was released prior to the album. John noted at the time in a radio interview that he had wanted to release &quot;Dan Dare (Pilot of the Future)&quot; as the album&#x27;s first single instead of &quot;Island Girl&quot;, because he thought it had more commercial appeal. He was over-ruled, and &quot;Dan Dare&quot; was never released as a single, whilst &quot;Island Girl&quot; became a hit.

The make-up of the Elton John Band was different on &quot;Rock of the Westies&quot;, being without his long-time drummer Nigel Olsson and bassist Dee Murray, both of whom John fired during April 1975. Added in their place were Hookfoot drummer Roger Pope, an old friend who had played on &quot;Empty Sky&quot;, &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot; and &quot;Madman Across the Water&quot;, and American bassist Kenny Passarelli, who had previously played with Stephen Stills and was an original member in Joe Walsh&#x27;s band Barnstorm. Pope had also played in Kiki Dee&#x27;s touring band. Grammy-, Emmy-, and Academy Award-nominated James Newton Howard, at the time a virtual unknown, was also brought in as keyboardist, giving him his first major publicity. Also included was another Hookfoot member, Caleb Quaye on guitar and vocals, another old friend from his early DJM session days. Like Pope, Quaye had also played on &quot;Empty Sky&quot;, &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot;, and John&#x27;s intervening eponymous release. Retained from the previous line-up were Davey Johnstone and Ray Cooper.

A slower, less up-tempo version of &quot;Hard Luck Story&quot; had already been recorded by Kiki Dee (whom the song was originally written for), and released as a single one year prior to its recording for &quot;Rock of the Westies&quot;. Along with &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Breaking My Heart&quot;, it is credited to Ann Orson/Carte Blanche (An &#x27;orse an&#x27; cart / &#x27;carte blanche&#x27;) a punning moniker John devised when composing a song (music and lyrics) on his own. The name Ann Orson is also used as the name of a backing vocalist. Labelle performed backing vocals on the opening track, &quot;Medley: Yell Help/Wednesday Night/Ugly&quot;.

In the US, it was certified gold in October 1975 and platinum in March 1993 by the RIAA.

Outside the US and Canada, this was the last original studio release from John on DJM Records, before forming his own label, The Rocket Record Company.

The song &quot;Street Kids&quot; was featured in the 2008 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;.

<doc id="1203992" wikidata="Q3018669" url="?curid=1203992" title="David Rees (cartoonist)">
<text>David Thomas Rees ( ; born June 22, 1972) is a humorist and cultural critic. He first rose to prominence as a cartoonist whose best-known work combined bland clip art with &quot;trash talk&quot;. Rees later created an artisanal pencil sharpening service and published a related book on the subject. He co-created and hosted two seasons of the television series &quot;Going Deep with David Rees&quot;. He is also the co-creator and co-host of the podcast &quot;Election Profit Makers&quot;. 

==Early life==
Rees grew up in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and was an avid reader of &quot;Rex Morgan, M.D.&quot; comics. According to Rees, while a young man he and three of his friends recorded over 2,000 songs as members of a &quot;secret band&quot;.

He is a graduate of Oberlin College, and drew comics for the school&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Oberlin Review&quot;.

==Career==

===Cartoonist===
Rees first became known for his office-cubicle humor that was inspired by his experience working in a basement for Citicorp. He also pulled his humor from his experience as a part-time fact-checker for &quot;Maxim&quot; and &quot;Martha Stewart Weddings&quot; magazines.

There are five collected volumes of his work. His best known and most controversial comic is &quot;Get Your War On&quot;, which has been translated into French, Spanish and Italian. When the follow-up volume, &quot;Get Your War On II&quot; was published, Rees donated all the royalties of both books (more than $100,000) to Adopt-a-Minefield, an organization that works to remove landmines from post-conflict areas. He is also the author of the comic strips &quot;My New Fighting Technique is Unstoppable&quot;, &quot;My New Filing Technique is Unstoppable&quot;, and &quot;Adventures of Confessions of Saint Augustine Bear&quot;.

===Artisanal Pencil Sharpening===
In 2010, Rees worked as a civil servant for the United States Census Bureau, a position that revitalized his interest in pencils.

In July 2010, Rees announced an Artisanal Pencil Sharpening service. Rees said that, for prices starting at $15, people could buy a sharpened pencil or mail in a pencil to be sharpened by him. Rees claimed to be a craftsman in &quot;the age-old art of manual pencil sharpening&quot;, saying his “artisanal service is perfect for artists, writers, and standardized test takers.&quot; He also sold art prints bundled with a sharpened pencil. According to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;This was before parody menus of farm-to-table restaurants had come out, before it was a cliché to make jokes about Mason jars and pickle-making, and artisanal culture desperately needed to be mocked. For fifteen dollars, Rees would hand-sharpen your pencil, bag up the shavings, and send it all back to you with a certificate of authenticity. It was deeply, satisfyingly ridiculous, and he was besieged with orders&quot;.

Rees released a book entitled &quot;How to Sharpen Pencils&quot; in April 2012. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a methodical, deliberate and gleeful subversion and satire that &quot;capture[s] the inherently joyless tedium of conveying specialized instructional information, while tipping off the reader that the cod liver oil is laced with laughing gas.&quot; It noted the book contains sections such as a list of common and uncommon children’s names, a comparison of the taste of certain wines versus the taste of certain pencils, and a guide to impressions of Sean Connery and Robert De Niro, but the review also noted that you can actually use the book to learn how to sharpen pencils.

In 2016 Rees announced that he would be raising his price per pencil to $500 and said he did not know if anyone would accept the new price.

===Television and podcasting===
In July 2014 the TV show &quot;Going Deep with David Rees&quot; launched on the National Geographic Channel. The show featured Rees humorously investigating the science and process behind very basic tasks such as making ice, lighting matches and the tying of shoelaces. For the second season, the show moved to the Esquire Network.

Rees hosts the weekly podcast &quot;Election Profit Makers&quot; with his childhood friend Jon Kimball and Starlee Kine in which they discuss the prediction market website PredictIt.org. The podcast first appeared as a series of 17 episodes before the 2016 U.S. presidential election and returned in the months before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

Rees co-created the animated television series &quot;Dicktown&quot; with John Hodgman, and starred as the character David Purefoy. It was released in 2020. &quot;Dicktown&quot; was renewed for a second season, which premiered in 2022.

===Music===
In late 2014 via his SoundCloud page, Rees released &quot;Aphex Swift&quot;, a collection of eight songs that combined the vocals of Taylor Swift and the electronic music of Aphex Twin. The collection received positive mentions ranging from &quot;The Verge&quot;, which called it &quot;bizarrely good&quot;, to &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;. In 2021, Rees released his first album of original noise music titled, &quot;YOU AINT GOIN NOWHERE,&quot; on the flower sounds music label.

===Writing and blogging===
Over his career Rees has written for a variety of publications. Since May 2005, Rees has been a contributing blogger at &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. In 2013, Rees began writing for &quot;Wired&quot;&#x27;s first scripted web series &quot;Codefellas&quot;.

==Personal life==

Rees married Sarah Lariviere in 2002; they divorced in 2012.

In 2010, Rees lived in Beacon, New York.

Rees married writer and filmmaker Emily Yoshida in 2018. They divorced in 2022.

<text>Ulrich Schnauss (born 8 September 1977) is a German electronic musician and producer based in London, England. He was a member of Tangerine Dream from 2014 to 2020.

== Biography ==
Ulrich Schnauss was born in the northern German seaport of Kiel in 1977. He had piano lessons when he was seven. He became interested in a range of music: My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, Tangerine Dream, Chapterhouse, and early bleep and breakbeat tracks. There was not much opportunity to see his musical influences in Kiel, so he moved to Berlin in 1996.

Schnauss&#x27; musical output began under the pseudonyms of View to the Future and Ethereal 77. These electronica and drum-driven pieces were noticed by Berlin electronica label CCO (City Centre Offices), to which Schnauss sent CDs on a regular basis. Schnauss developed these submissions to CCO into his first album under his own name, &quot;Far Away Trains Passing By&quot;, released in Europe in 2001 and in the United States in 2005.

His next album, 2003&#x27;s &quot;A Strangely Isolated Place&quot;, showed the influence of My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s Kevin Shields and Cocteau Twins&#x27; Robin Guthrie. Schnauss has said of this album, &quot;When you&#x27;ve worked with computers and keyboards for a number of years, they become not so fascinating of themselves anymore. I gained confidence after people began to discover &quot;Far Away Trains Passing By&quot;, and it hasn&#x27;t really stopped since then. This time I decided not to compromise on what I wanted to do, with what I thought people might want me to do.&quot;

Since the release of both albums Schnauss has been asked to work with and remix with artists, including port-royal, Mojave 3, Airiel, A Shoreline Dream, Asobi Seksu, Televise, Longview, Johannes Schmoelling, The Zephyrs, Lunz (Roedelius), and others.

He also plays keyboards for UK indie band Longview, whose singer Rob McVey was featured on Schnauss&#x27; next album, &quot;Goodbye&quot;. In an interview, he said: &quot;I have always loved music that has both elements: melancholy and sadness as a description of the current situation you are in, but at the same time a hopeful, utopian element that reminds you of the possibility of a different life.&quot;

His third album, &quot;Goodbye&quot;, was completed in early 2007. It was released in Europe by Independiente Records on 25 June 2007. The United States release followed on 10 July under Domino Records. Regarding this album, he said: &quot;The overall idea was pretty much the same. I just wanted to merge the indie songwriting elements and electronic instrumentation. After the previous album I still had a feeling like there was more room to take these ideas to an extreme level when it comes to layering and laying down as many tracks as possible.&quot;

On 12 June 2007, Schnauss released an EP, &quot;Quicksand Memory&quot;, which contains two remixes by Robin Guthrie of previous releases, a mix by Rob McVey of a previously unreleased track, and an edit of a track appearing on his latest album.

In the spring of 2008, Schnauss remixed two tracks by the Manchester-based shoegaze band Daniel Land and the Modern Painters. On 27 October 2008, the two tracks, &quot;Within the Boundaries&quot; and &quot;Benjamin&#x27;s Room&quot;, were released as a double A-side 7&quot; single by the independent record label Sonic Cathedral, the label&#x27;s 11th release.

In July 2008, the &quot;Stars&quot; EP was released to support his June/July US tour. A co-produced/co-written track with A Shoreline Dream, titled &quot;neverChanger&quot;, was released on an EP of the same name. Schnauss traveled out for a short tour with the band in Texas and Colorado to promote this effort and performed this track with A Shoreline Dream during his performances.

In October 2009, Schnauss&#x27; record labels, Independiente and Domino, sued Guns N&#x27; Roses, alleging that the band had committed copyright infringement by using portions of Schnauss&#x27; compositions in the track &quot;Riad &#x27;n the Bedouins&quot; on the album &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;.

In 2010, Schnauss was involved in the mixing of Exit Calm&#x27;s self-titled debut album.

Schnauss also provided keyboards and backing vocals on Engineers&#x27; third album, &quot;In Praise of More&quot;. Schnauss also played as a headlining act for the &quot;Phrase One&quot; festival held in the small Irish town of Carrick-on-Shannon on 19 April 2013.

Schnauss was a member of Tangerine Dream from 2014 to 2020. His first release with the group was the mini-album &quot;Mala Kunia&quot; (2014) which launched &quot;The Quantum Years&quot;-era of the group influenced by quantum physics.

After obtaining the rights to his entire catalog, Schnauss remastered and mixed all five of his solo studio albums, releasing them in 2019 on the 7CD compilation box set &quot;Now is a Timeless Present&quot;, along with a bonus disc of unreleased recordings and outtakes. Albums &quot;A Long Way to Fall&quot; and &quot;No Further Ahead than Today&quot; were also re-worked and partially re-recorded, and given new artwork and titles of &quot;A Long Way to Fall – Rebound&quot; and &quot;No Further Ahead than Tomorrow&quot;. Each remastered album was later released individually in 2020.

<text>The Bristol Industrial Museum was a museum in Bristol, England, located on Prince&#x27;s Wharf beside the Floating Harbour and which closed in 2006. On display were items from Bristol&#x27;s industrial past – including aviation, car and bus manufacture, and printing – and exhibits documenting Bristol&#x27;s maritime history. The museum was managed by Bristol City Council along with nearby preserved industrial relics along Prince&#x27;s Wharf, including the Bristol Harbour Railway, cranes and a small fleet of preserved vessels. The railway, cranes and vessels all now form part of the working exhibits at M Shed Museum.

The museum closed its doors to the public on 29 October 2006. M Shed, the new Museum of Bristol has been created on the site, keeping the same façade and many of the exhibits. It opened 17 June 2011.

==Overview==

The museum&#x27;s indoor exhibits were housed on the two floors of a former quayside transit shed.

===Road transport===
On the lower floor was the transport gallery, which housed various land transport exhibits with a particular Bristol slant. Exhibits included what is believed to be the world&#x27;s first purpose-built holiday caravan to be compared with a 1950s equivalent, the Grenville steam carriage, bicycles, motorcycles, cars, carriages and buses.

===Aviation===
On the upper floor the aviation gallery told the story of Bristol&#x27;s involvement in aircraft manufacture and contained a collection of Bristol-made aero engines, a Bristol-built helicopter, a mock-up flight deck of Concorde and scale models showing the many aircraft built in the city. On the same floor the story of the Port of Bristol was told with models, paintings and other exhibits.

===Print &amp; Pack===
The adjacent &quot;Print &amp; Pack&quot; gallery told the story of one of Bristol&#x27;s biggest industries with machinery and products. This was a particularly popular working exhibit, with live demonstrations of printing machinery such as Linotype and Letterpress. These same exhibits also printed many of the museum&#x27;s own leaflets, tickets and flyers.

===Bristol and Transatlantic Slavery gallery===
Elsewhere in the museum, the &quot;Bristol and Transatlantic Slavery&quot; gallery told the story of Bristol&#x27;s involvement in the trans-Atlantic slave trade between the UK, Africa and the Caribbean, from its early days through abolition and to recent times.

===Historic ships, cranes and trains===
Normally moored in front of the developing new museum is the collection of historic vessels, which included the 1934 fireboat &quot;Pyronaut&quot; and two tugs: &quot;John King&quot; built as a diesel tug in 1935 and &quot;Mayflower&quot;, the world&#x27;s oldest surviving steam tug built in 1861.

On the quayside outside the museum are four electrically powered cargo cranes built in 1951 by Stothert &amp; Pitt. A short distance to the west is much older crane, the sole surviving operational example of a Fairbairn steam crane. Built in 1878, also by Stothert &amp; Pitt, it was in regular use until 1973 loading and unloading ships and railway wagons with loads up to 35 tons. It has been restored and is in working order, operating on some bank holidays and the Bristol Harbour Festival. Bristol Harbour Railway continues to offer train rides along the quayside on bank holidays, using restored steam locomotives and rolling stock.

<text>František Maxmilián Kaňka (19 August 1674 – 14 July 1766) was a Czech architect. He was among the most important and most prolific Baroque architects in the Czech lands.

==Life==

František Maxmilián Kaňka was born in Prague on 19 August 1674. His father Vít Václav Kaňka was a builder who built the fortifications of New Town of Prague.

Kaňka became an apprentice of Paul Ignaz Bayer. He then lived abroad for a while (in Vienna and probably also in northern Italy). He was married twice. He married a second time at a relatively old age to a much younger wife. From 1733 or 1734, he no longer devoted himself to architecture and became a successful brewer. He was wealthy and had his offspring study law. He died in Prague on 14 July 1766, at the age of 91.

==Work==
After his return from abroad, he collaborated with leading architects of his time such as Giovanni Battista Alliprandi and Jan Santini Aichel. In contrast to other architects, such as Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer, he focused mainly on designing buildings and not on their construction. His close friend was the sculptor Matthias Braun, who decorated almost twenty of his buildings (including St. Clement&#x27;s Cathedral in Clementinum with 190 his sculptures, which is the largest collection of his sculptures). He also ofter collaborated with the painter Wenzel Lorenz Reiner.

In the course of his career, Kaňka worked on castles, palaces and churches, and became especially noteworthy for his reconstructions, redesigns and expansions of existing buildings throughout Bohemia. His services were used by the church and various leading noble families in the Kingdom of Bohemia. He built the most buildings for the Czernin family, and his other customers included the families of Liechtenstein, Vrtba and Mansfeld. In 1723, he was appointed court architect by the Emperor Charles VI.

He is most famous for reconstructions of palaces and castles of Bohemian nobles and for designs of churches and other religious buildings, principally in the Baroque style. His work includes:
* Loučeň castle complex (1704–1713)
* Reconstruction of the Karolinum complex in Prague, the seat of Charles University (1716–1718)
* Reconstruction of Vrtba Palace and Vrtba Garden in Prague ()
* Karlova Koruna Chateau (with Jan Santini Aichel) ()
* Reconstruction of Krásný Dvůr Castle ()
* Astronomical Tower, St. Clement&#x27;s Cathedral and other structures at the Clementinum in Prague (with Anselmo Lurago, )
* Reconstruction of the façade of the St. Procopius Basilica in Třebíč, today protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site (1725–1733)
* Konopiště Castle (1725)
* Church of St. John of Nepomuk in Kutná Hora ()
* Reconstruction of a part of Zbraslav Monastery
* Donaueschingen Palace in Baden-Württemberg, Germany

<doc id="1204012" wikidata="Q4901008" url="?curid=1204012" title="Bhangmeter">
<text>A bhangmeter is a non-imaging radiometer installed on reconnaissance and navigation satellites to detect atmospheric nuclear detonations and determine the yield of the nuclear weapon. They are also installed on some armored fighting vehicles, in particular NBC reconnaissance vehicles, in order to help detect, localise and analyse tactical nuclear detonations. They are often used alongside pressure and sound sensors in this role in addition to standard radiation sensors. Some nuclear bunkers and military facilities may also be equipped with such sensors alongside seismic event detectors.

The bhangmeter was developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory by a team led by Hermann Hoerlin.

==History==
The bhangmeter was invented, and the first proof-of-concept device was built, in 1948 to measure the nuclear test detonations of Operation Sandstone. Prototype and production instruments were later built by EG&amp;G, and the name &quot;bhangmeter&quot; was coined in 1950 by Frederick Reines. Bhangmeters became standard instruments used to observe US nuclear tests. A bhangmeter was developed to observe the detonations of Operation Buster-Jangle (1951) and Operation Tumbler-Snapper (1952). These tests lay the groundwork for a large deployment of nationwide North American bhangmeters with the Bomb Alarm System (1961–1967).

US president John F. Kennedy and the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Nikita Khrushchev signed the Partial Test Ban Treaty on August 5, 1963, under the condition that each party could use its own technical means to monitor the ban on nuclear testing in the atmosphere or in outer space.

Bhangmeters were first installed, in 1961, aboard a modified US KC-135A aircraft monitoring the pre-announced Soviet test of Tsar Bomba.

The Vela satellites were the first space-based observation devices jointly developed by the U.S. Air Force and the Atomic Energy Commission. The first generation of Vela satellites were not equipped with bhangmeters but with X-ray sensors to detect the intense single pulse of X-rays produced by a nuclear explosion. The first satellites which incorporated bhangmeters were the Advanced Vela satellites.

Since 1980, bhangmeters have been included on US GPS navigation satellites.

==Description==

The silicon photodiode sensors are designed to detect the distinctive bright double pulse of visible light that is emitted from atmospheric nuclear weapons explosions. This signature consists of a short and intense flash lasting around 1 millisecond, followed by a second much more prolonged and less intense emission of light taking a fraction of a second to several seconds to build up. This signature, with a double intensity maximum, is characteristic of atmospheric nuclear explosions and is the result of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere becoming opaque to visible light and transparent again as the explosion&#x27;s shock wave travels through it.

The effect occurs because the surface of the early fireball is quickly overtaken by the expanding &quot;case shock&quot;, the atmospheric shock wave composed of the ionised plasma of what was once the casing and other matter of the device. Although it emits a considerable amount of light itself, it is opaque and prevents the far brighter fireball from shining through. The net result recorded is a decrease of the light visible from outer space as the shock wave expands, producing the first peak recorded by the bhangmeter.

As it expands, the shock wave cools off and becomes less opaque to the visible light produced by the inner fireball. The bhangmeter starts eventually to record an increase in visible light intensity. The expansion of the fireball leads to an increase of its surface area and consequently an increase of the amount of visible light radiated off to space. The fireball continues to cool down so the amount of light eventually starts to decrease, causing the second peak observed by the bhangmeter. The time between the first and second peaks can be used to determine its nuclear yield.

The effect is unambiguous for explosions below about altitude, but above this height a more ambiguous single pulse is produced.

==Origin of the name==
The name of the detector is a pun which was bestowed upon it by Fred Reines, one of the scientists working on the project. The name is derived from the Punjabi word &quot;bhang&quot;, a locally grown variety of cannabis which is smoked or drunk to induce intoxicating effects, the joke being that one would have to be on drugs to believe the bhangmeter detectors would work properly. This is in contrast to a &quot;bangmeter&quot; one might associate with detection of nuclear explosions.

Execution chambers are almost always inside the walls of a maximum-security prison, although not always at the same prison where the death row population is housed. Inside the chamber is the device used to carry out the death sentence.

==United States==

In the United States, an execution chamber will usually contain a lethal injection table. In most cases, a witness room is located adjacent to an execution chamber, where witnesses may watch the execution through glass windows. All except for two of the states which allow capital punishment are equipped with a death chamber, but many states rarely put them to use. The exceptions are New Hampshire, which has no execution chamber (although one inmate remains on death row since the abolition of capital punishment in that state is not retroactive) and California, which has no execution chambers after the lethal injection room and gas chamber were removed in 2019. Kansas, Nevada, and Wyoming are the only states to have an execution chamber, which is equipped to execute an inmate by lethal injection, which has never been used, while the states of New Jersey and New York formerly had lethal injection chambers which were never used while the death penalty remained legal.

The National Ethics Council of the American Institute of Architects ruled in 2019 that its members may continue to design execution chambers in jurisdictions where they are legal.

==United Kingdom==

In the United Kingdom, the execution chamber was part of a larger complex, often referred to as the &quot;Execution Suite&quot;. The room, usually formed from two single prison cells, contained the large trapdoor, usually double-leaved, but in some older chambers such as at Oxford, single-leaved, and operating lever. The wooden beam from which the rope was suspended was usually set into the walls of the chamber above, with the floor removed. At Wandsworth Prison the floor was retained and holes allowed the rope and chains through. Oxford&#x27;s chamber was of an old 19th-century type, and the beam was set into the walls of the chamber just above head height.

Such rooms were almost always built into one of the wings of a prison; following the recommendation of prison governors during the 1948 Royal Commission on capital punishment, further execution chambers were housed in purpose-built blocks separate from the main prison. The last gallows to be constructed and used in Britain, at HMP Aberdeen, was built in 1962, and was used one year later for the hanging of Henry John Burnett, the last person to be executed in Scotland. A freestanding execution block was built at HMP Perth in 1965, but was never used. This was the last gallows to be constructed in the United Kingdom.

The last officially operational gallows in the United Kingdom (as several remained unofficially in other prisons), at Wandsworth Prison, was removed in 1994. Salvaged parts from it are in the possession of the National Justice Museum, having previously been at the HM Prison Service museum.

==Japan==

Japan has seven execution chambers, which are located at the Detention Houses in Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, Sendai and Sapporo. All executions in Japan are carried out by hanging. The execution chamber in Tokyo has a trap door. As the condemned is dropped, their body falls into a room below the execution chamber and the death is confirmed. In the Tokyo facility, the actual chamber is preceded by a room with a shrine to &quot;Amida Nyorai&quot; (Amitābha), a Buddhist deity, to allow for prayers and consultation with a religious official. The execution room in Tokyo is separated into two sections, with a total area of 25 m2.

== Canada ==
In Canada, executions were usually carried out in the county/municipality jail where they were committed. Alberta had gallows for the entire province in Fort Saskatchewan and Lethbridge. British Columbia had their executions in Oakalla (Burnaby).

The Don Jail was for murders committed in The City of Toronto and County of York. The Ontario County Jail in Whitby which was used for murders committed to what is now Durham Region. Most hangings were carried out using temporary gallows built in the jail yard although a few jails had permanent indoor facilities.

<text>Astrid Muñoz (born 1974) is a Puerto Rican model turned photographer.

==Early years==
Muñoz was the first of three siblings born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her father, Teodoro was a nuclear engineer and her mother, Astrid, a retired executive secretary. They were both strict in their upbringing of Muñoz, who received her primary and secondary education in San Juan. She enjoyed going to the beach and reading fashion magazines as a young girl. In 1988, then-fourteen-year-old Muñoz was offered an opportunity to model in Spain, but her mother objected.

==Modeling career==
In 1993, Muñoz was visiting a friend in Miami when a modeling agent suggested she try a career in fashion in France. Muñoz accepted the idea and left for France without consulting her parents. In Paris, she became one of the first latinas to break through as a model.

After working in Europe for several years, Muñoz relocated to New York City, where she appeared on the covers of notable fashion magazines such as &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Officiel&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, and appeared in fashion campaigns and commercials for Balenciaga, Chanel, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, GAP, L&#x27;Oréal, Mango, Nokia, Saks Fifth Avenue, Valentino, and Yves Saint Laurent &quot;Rive Gauche&quot; and &quot;In Love Again&quot; fragrances. Most recently, she is featured in the advertising campaign for Roberto Cavalli&#x27;s new line for the chain H&amp;M. Her runway work includes Christian Dior, Chanel, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Dries van Noten, Emanuel Ungaro, Eric Bergere, Erreuno, Gianfranco Ferré, Jill Stuart, Jean Paul Gaultier, Missoni, Moschino, Nicole Miller, Oscar de la Renta, and Valentino.

She has been represented by the agencies Next, Marilyn, Riccardo Gay, and Strom, but is currently signed to IMG Models.

In the June 2006 edition of &quot;Hola de España&quot; magazine, Muñoz was ranked among the most beautiful women in the world. That same month she was featured in Spanish &quot;GQ&quot; with Joaquin Cortes (flamenco dancer).

==Photographer==
In 1998, Muñoz took a course in Photojournalism with Joseph Rodriguez, at the ICP institute in New York City. She began her hobby by expressing her feelings through her photographic work. She traveled to the valleys of the Massai Mara and to the Pampas of Argentina. Her interest in the customs and folklore of the Argentine Gauchos, was the instrumental factor which led her to present an exhibition of the &quot;Gaucho&quot; theme at the Jaeger-LeCoultre boutique in London on January 31, 2012. Her work was also published in Jaeger-LeCoultre latest publication Yearbook Five. When she traveled to Peru and Mexico she used her camera to document the customs and way of life of the native people. On September 27, 2013, her photographic work was exhibited at the &quot;La Halle Freyssinet&quot;, &quot;Skye Photography &amp; Installation&quot; in Paris. She also does fashion photography and her work has appeared in Vogue, GQ, Vanity Fair, Tatler, Marie Claire, and Vissionaire.

On October 20, 2013, Muñoz and her photographic work were featured in the section &quot;Por Dentro&quot; (Inside) of &quot;El Nuevo Dia&quot;, a Puerto Rican newspaper. The interview for the section was made by Carmen Graciela Díaz.

<doc id="1204035" wikidata="Q3407091" url="?curid=1204035" title="Progressive Muslim Union">
<text>The Progressive Muslim Union of North America (PMU) was a liberal Islamic organization. The group officially launched on November 15, 2004, in Manhattan but was disbanded in December 2006.

&quot;The Progressive Muslim Union (PMU) is the result of almost two years of conversation and collaboration between a group of North American Muslims who are committed to representing and renewing our community in all its social, ideological and political diversity. PMU members range from deeply religious to totally secular, sharing in common a commitment to learning, political and social empowerment, a commitment to justice and freedom and a concern and love for the Muslim community.&quot;

==Woman imam==

These differences came to a head in March 2005, when PMU endorsed a mixed-gender prayer led by a woman imam, Professor Amina Wadud. The prayer was co-sponsored by the progressive Muslim online magazine Muslim WakeUp! and Asra Nomani&#x27;s Muslim Women&#x27;s Freedom Tour. The event, which was attended by about 150 congregants in New York City and heavily covered by international media, became a huge controversy, galvanizing both supporters and detractors around the world.

Opponents, in particular M. A. Muqtedar Khan, argued that reform should be restricted to social matters, not matters of worship. Supporters, however, asserted that nothing in the Qur&#x27;an, the Muslim holy scripture, prevents a woman from leading mixed-gender prayers, and that restrictions are based on outmoded cultural and patriarchal notions.

PMU&#x27;s co-chair, Pamela Taylor, reinforced PMU&#x27;s position when she joined hands with the Muslim Canadian Congress and the United Muslim Association to be the first woman to deliver the Friday sermon and lead the mixed-gender congregation in a mosque on July 1, 2005.

==Current state==
PMU is now defunct, due to a schism. In July 2005, board member Muqtedar Khan resigned. In August 2005, three of the four founding members, Omid Safi, Hussein Ibish and Sarah Eltantawi resigned along with Laury Silvers and Michael Muhammad Knight (Ahmed Nassef was the fourth founding member). When Michael Muhammad Knight resigned, he predicted that PMU would collapse within one year.

In December 2006, chair Pamela Taylor and executive director Ani Zonneveld resigned from the board, citing unreconcilable conflicts with board member Tarek Fatah. Soon after, Fatah, who controlled PMU&#x27;s e-mail discussion list, blocked posting by list members.

Two of the original eighteen leaders of PMU, Ani Zonneveld and Pamela Taylor, created a new organization, Muslims for Progressive Values (MPV) in May 2007.

<text>Shari&#x27;s Cafe &amp; Pies, originally known as Shari&#x27;s Restaurants, is a chain of family dining restaurants in the western United States based in Beaverton, Oregon. Its restaurants are pie-oriented. The franchise&#x27;s original restaurant was opened in Hermiston, Oregon, in 1978. Shari&#x27;s are known for their familiar hexagonal building design. As of January 2025, 11 locations appear in the store location listing.

==History==

Shari&#x27;s began in Hermiston, Oregon, in 1978 with Ron and Sharon &quot;Shari&quot; Bergquist as proprietors. The two ran the company for seven years. By 1999, Shari&#x27;s was the ninth-largest family restaurant chain in the United States based on total sales, and sixth in growth.

In March 1999, the chain was acquired by Fairmont Capital Inc. for $60 million. At that time Shari&#x27;s operated 96 locations in seven states with 4,000 employees and $128 million in annual revenue. They were still the ninth largest family chain in 2003.

Shari&#x27;s lost a gender discrimination lawsuit in April 2005 and was ordered to pay $122,225 in damages. In December 2005, the company was purchased by New York private investment firm Circle Peak Capital.

President Larry Curtis retired in July 2008 after 24 years with Shari&#x27;s and was succeeded by Bruce MacDiarmid. In 2009, Shari&#x27;s Restaurants took ownership of a number of northern California Baker&#x27;s Square restaurants and converted them to operate under Shari&#x27;s name. 

The chain is currently operated by Shari&#x27;s Management Corporation in Beaverton. Most, but not all locations are open 24 hours a day, with a focus on specialty pies. Samuel Borgese was named CEO in September 2017, replacing MacDiarmid. In mid-2017, the company was operating 95 locations in the states of California, Idaho, Nebraska, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming, just one fewer than in the year 2000.

In September 2018, it was announced that Shari&#x27;s Cafe &amp; Pies had taken over Carrows and Coco&#x27;s Bakery.

In August 2024, it was announced that Shari&#x27;s Cafe &amp; Pies has been behind on payments for both property, taxes and services rendered for the restaurant chain. As a result, a large number of Shari&#x27;s locations permanently closed. By early October 2024, the number of locations had declined to 49, operating in California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho. In late October, all Oregon locations closed abruptly, dropping the remaining number of locations to seventeen. Shari&#x27;s owes around $900,000 to the Oregon Lottery for their video lottery machines.

<text>Richard Alex Gordon Dalla-Riva (born 6 April 1963) is an Australian former politician. He was a Liberal Party member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 2002 to 2018, representing East Yarra Province (2002–2006) and Eastern Metropolitan Region (2006–2018). He served as Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and Minister for Manufacturing in the Baillieu Ministry from 2010 to 2013, but was dropped in a reshuffle when Denis Napthine replaced Baillieu as Premier.

Dalla-Riva was born in the regional town of Orbost, but grew up in Beechworth, before moving to Melbourne. After graduating from the Macleod High School (now Macleod College), he joined the police force, and was promoted to the rank of detective in 1988. He worked in a number of areas associated with financial crime, including the major fraud and asset recovery squads, and also spent time working for the National Crime Authority.

While still working in the police force, he studied business at the Phillip Institute of Technology (now part of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology). In 1995, after seven years as a detective, Dalla-Riva left the police force, and entered the private sector. He held various managerial roles at Woolworths Limited, before becoming the General Manager for a national food manufacturer. Later, Dalla-Riva became the Group Manager for a large disability service before becoming the State Regional Manager for a US multi-national company. He received an MBA from the University of Southern Queensland in 1998.

Dalla-Riva has demonstrated a keen interest in community work and is currently involved in the following community organisations: the Essendon Football Club; Melbourne Cricket Club; Veneto Club Melbourne; Australia Day Council Victoria Inc. Dalla-Riva is the former Vice President of Kindergarten Parents’ Victoria Inc.

In 2000, Dalla-Riva began to take an active political role, becoming chairman of the Liberal Party&#x27;s electorate council for East Yarra Province. His active role was rewarded when he won Liberal pre-selection to contest the seat at the 2002 election. He was elected amidst a major swing against the Liberal Party, with the loss of many seats across the state. Dalla-Riva was appointed Shadow Minister for the corrections portfolio, covering the state&#x27;s prison system. In January 2004, Dalla-Riva was given the additional portfolio of scrutiny of government, replacing David Davis, who had been recently promoted. This saw Dalla-Riva handed the responsibility of investigating government mismanagement and playing a major role in the opposition&#x27;s attacks on the government.

Dalla-Riva was re-appointed in 2007 to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Minister for Community Development, Innovation and Freedom of Information. In February 2008, Dalla-Riva was promoted and allocated the positions of Shadow Minister for Industry and State Development, Shadow Minister for Major Projects and Freedom of Information.

Dalla-Riva held various roles in the Shadow Cabinet. Since being elected to Parliament in 2002 until the election win 2010, Dalla-Riva held seven shadow ministerial positions. These included: Shadow Minister for Manufacturing and Export December 2005 – February 2007. Shadow Minister for Scrutiny of Government, May 2006 – February 2007, Shadow Minister for Community Development and Shadow Minister for Innovation August 2007 – February 2008, Shadow Minister for Freedom of Information August 2007 – November 2009, Shadow Minister for Industry and State Development and Shadow Minister for Major Projects February 2008 – December 2010.

Dalla-Riva was also the Liberal Party&#x27;s representative on the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation (VicHealth) for the period 24 September 2007 – 23 September 2010, a statutory authority with an independent chair and board of governance with vast experience in health, sport, the arts, research and communication, working in partnership with organisations, communities and individuals to promote good health.

During Dalla-Riva&#x27;s time in Parliament, he has also provided his services to several parliamentary committees including: the Library Committee, the Law Reform Committee, the Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee, the Public Accounts and Estimates Committee and the LC Standing Orders Committee 

Since the Coalition&#x27;s win in 2010, Mr Dalla-Riva has made several announcements. One public policy announcement made on 2 March 2011 was to assign the Victoria Competition and Efficiency Commission (VCEC) to inquire into how to improve efficiency and growth in Victoria&#x27;s manufacturing sector. Another policy announcement on 20 January 2011 concerned the Baillieu Government&#x27;s commitment to Victoria&#x27;s manufacturing sector industry and its provision of support and development opportunities to reinstate Victoria as the preeminent manufacturing state.

As Minister, he has made a series of manufacturing related statements including: a Victorian manufacturing plant signing a contract to produce components for Nissan, the launch of a new TV series to promote Victoria&#x27;s wine industry in China, a Victorian company securing a new major defence contract.

Dalla-Riva was Minister for Employment &amp; Industrial Relations and Minister for Manufacturing, Exports and Trade from December 2010 until March 2013. In March 2013, he was elected as the Chair of the Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee. In April 2013, he was elected as the Chair of the Standing Committee on Environment and Planning – Legislation Committee.

On 10 February 2017, Dalla-Riva announced he would retire from politics at the next state election in 2018.

<doc id="1204058" wikidata="Q1094510" url="?curid=1204058" title="New Christian">
<text>New Christian (; ; ; ; ; ) was a socio-religious designation and legal distinction referring to the population of former Jewish and Muslim converts to Christianity in the Spanish and Portuguese empires, and their respective colonies in the New World. The term was used from the 15th century onwards primarily to describe the descendants of the Sephardic Jews and Moors that were baptized into the Catholic Church following the Alhambra Decree of 1492. The Alhambra Decree, also known as the Edict of Expulsion, was an anti-Jewish law made by the Catholic Monarchs upon the &quot;Reconquista&quot; of the Iberian Peninsula. It required Jews to convert to Roman Catholicism or be expelled from Spain. Most of the history of the &quot;New Christians&quot; refers to the Jewish converts, who were generally known as &quot;Conversos&quot; (or in a more derogatory fashion &quot;Marranos&quot;), while the Muslim converts were called &quot;Moriscos&quot;.

Because these conversions were achieved in part through coercion and also with the threat of expulsion, especially when it came to the Jews, the Catholic Inquisition and Iberian monarchs suspected a number of the &quot;New Christians&quot; of being crypto-Jews. Subsequently, the Spanish Inquisition and then the Portuguese Inquisition was created to enforce Catholic orthodoxy and to investigate allegations of heresy. This became a political issue in the kingdoms of the Portuguese-Spanish Union itself and their respective empires abroad, particularly in Spanish America, Portuguese America, and the Caribbean. Sometimes &quot;New Christians&quot; travelled to territories controlled by Protestant enemies of Spain, such as the Dutch Empire, the early English Empire, or Huguenot-influenced areas of the Kingdom of France such as Bordeaux, and openly practiced Judaism, which furthered suspicion of Jewish crypsis. Nevertheless, a significant number of those &quot;New Christians&quot; of &quot;converso&quot; ancestry were deemed by Spanish society as sincerely Catholic and they still managed to attain prominence, whether religious (St. John of the Cross, St. Teresa of Ávila, St. John of Ávila, St. Joseph of Anchieta, Tomás de Torquemada, Diego Laynez, Francisco de Vitoria, Francisco Suárez, and others) or political (Juan de Oñate, Luis de Carvajal y de la Cueva, Hernán Pérez de Quesada, Luis de Santángel, and others).

According to António José Saraiva, a Portuguese literature teacher and historian, &quot;The reality of the dichotomy between Old and New Christian only existed in the Inquisitorial taxonomy. The religious or ethnic definition of the New Christians was, in the last analysis, merely formal and bureaucratic. Also, the label of the New Christian can be based on rumors originating from dubious genealogies, slander and intrigue.&quot; By law, the category of New Christians included recent converts and their known baptized descendants with any fraction New Christian blood up to the third generation, the fourth generation being exempted. In Phillip II&#x27;s reign, it included any person with any fraction of New Christian blood &quot;from time immemorial&quot;. In Portugal, in 1772, Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquess of Pombal decreed an end to the legal distinction between New Christians and Old Christians.

==&quot;New Christian&quot; as a legal category==
Although the category of New Christian is meaningless in Christian theology and ecclesiology, it was introduced by the Old Christians who claimed that &quot;pure unmixed&quot; Christian bloodlines distinguish them as a unique group, separated from ethnic Jews and Iberian Muslims.

The Old Christians wanted to legally and socially distinguish themselves from the &quot;conversos&quot; (converts to Christianity) whom they considered being tainted by their non-Spanish bloodlines-even though the overwhelming majority of Spain&#x27;s Muslims were also indigenous Iberians, descendants of native Iberians who earlier converted to Islam under Muslim rule.

In practice, for New Christians of Jewish origin, the concept of &quot;New Christian&quot; was a legal mechanism and manifestation of racial antisemitism rather than Judaism as a religion. For those of Moorish origin, it was a manifestation of racial anti-Berberism and/or anti-Arabism. Portuguese New Christians were alleged to have been partners with an English factor in Italy in a notable 17th century marine insurance swindle.

===Cleanliness of blood and related concepts===

The related Spanish development of an ideology of &quot;limpieza de sangre&quot; (&quot;cleanliness of blood&quot;) also excluded New Christians from society—universities, emigration to the New World, many professions—regardless of their sincerity as converts.

Other derogatory terms applied to each of the converting groups included &quot;marranos&quot; (i.e. &quot;pigs&quot;) for New Christians of Jewish origin, and &quot;moriscos&quot; (a term which carried pejorative connotations) for New Christians of Andalusian origin.

==Discrimination and persecution==
Aside from social stigma and ostracism, the consequences of legal or social categorization as a New Christian included restrictions of civil and political rights, abuses of those already-limited civil rights, social and sometimes legal restrictions on whom one could marry (anti-miscegenation laws), social restrictions on where one could live, legal restrictions of entry into the professions and the clergy, legal restrictions and prohibition of immigration to and settlement in the newly colonized Spanish territories in the Americas, deportation from the colonies.

In addition to the above restrictions and discrimination endured by New Christians, the Spanish Crown and Church authorities also subjected New Christians to persecution, prosecution, and capital punishment for actual or alleged practice of the family&#x27;s former religion. After the Alhambra Decree of the expulsion of the Jewish population from Spain in 1492 and a similar Portuguese decree in 1497, the remaining Jewish population in Iberia became officially Christian by default. The New Christians, especially those of Jewish origin, were always under suspicion of being &quot;judaizantes&quot; (&quot;judaizers&quot;); that is, apostatizing from the Christian religion and being active crypto-Jews.

==Emigration==
===Jewish &quot;New Christian&quot; emigration===
Despite the discrimination and legal restrictions, many Jewish-origin New Christians found ways of circumventing these restrictions for emigration and settlement in the Iberian colonies of the New World by falsifying or buying &quot;limpieza de sangre&quot; (&quot;cleanliness of blood&quot;) documentation or attaining perjured &quot;affidavit&quot; attesting to untainted Old Christian pedigrees. The descendants of these, who could not return to Judaism, became the modern-day Christian-professing Sephardic Bnei Anusim of Latin America.

Also as a result of the unceasing trials and persecutions by the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition, other Jewish-origin New Christians opted to migrate out of the Iberian Peninsula in a continuous flow between the 1600s to 1800s towards Amsterdam, and also London, whereupon in their new tolerant environment of refuge outside the Iberian cultural sphere they eventually returned to Judaism. The descendants of these became the Spanish and Portuguese Jews.

===Muslim &quot;New Christian&quot; emigration===
Although Iberian Muslims were protected in the treaty signed at the fall of Granada, and the New Christian descendants of former Muslims weren&#x27;t expelled until over a century later. Even so, in the meantime, different waves of Andalusian Muslims and New Christians of Moorish origin left the Iberian Peninsula and settled across North Africa and in the provinces of the Ottoman Empire.

==History of New Christian conversions==
Over a hundred thousand of Iberian Jews converted to Catholicism in Spain as a result of pogroms in 1391. Those remaining practicing Jews were expelled by the Catholic monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella in the Alhambra Decree in 1492, following the Catholic Reconquest of Spain. As a result of the Alhambra Decree and persecution in prior years, over 200,000 Jews converted to Catholicism and between 40,000 and 100,000 were expelled. Following the Catholic Reconquest of Spain, 200,000 of the 500,000 Muslims had been converted to Christianity. There is no universally agreed figure of Morisco population, but Christiane Stallaert put the number at around one million Moriscos (New Christians and their descendants) at the beginning of the 16th century.

==Inquisition==
The governments of Spain and Portugal created the Spanish Inquisition in 1478 and the Portuguese Inquisition, including the Goa Inquisition, in 1536 as a way of dealing with social tensions, supposedly justified by the need to fight heresy. Communities believed correctly that many New Christians were secretly practising their former religions to any extent possible, becoming crypto-Jews and crypto-Muslims.

<text>The 91st United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C., from January 3, 1969, to January 3, 1971, during the final weeks of the presidency of Lyndon Johnson and the first two years of the first presidency of Richard Nixon.

The apportionment of seats in this House of Representatives was based on the 1960 United States census.

Both chambers had a Democratic majority - albeit with losing their supermajority status in the Senate. With Richard Nixon being sworn in as president on January 20, 1969, this ended the Democrats&#x27; overall federal government trifecta that they had held since the 87th Congress.

<text>A scenographer or scenic designer, also production designer, is a person who develops the appearance of a stage design, a TV or movie set, a gaming environment, a trade fair exhibition design or a museum experience exhibition design. The term originated in theater. A scenographer works together with the theater director to make the message come through in the best way they think possible, the director having the leading role and responsibility particularly for dramatic aspects - such as casting, acting, and direction - and the scenographer primarily responsible for the visual aspects or &quot;look&quot; of the production - which often includes scenery or sets, lighting, and costumes, and may include projections or other aspects.

While a common role in theatrical production teams in most countries, the position of scenographer is very uncommon in the United States, where this task is generally parcelled out among several people, principally the scenic or set designer who generally spearheads the visual aspects of the production. The production&#x27;s design team often includes a production team that includes a director, scenic or set designer, lighting designer, costume designer, sound designer, dramaturg, stage manager, and production manager.

<doc id="1204088" wikidata="Q391215" url="?curid=1204088" title="Volubilis">
<text>Volubilis (; ; ) is a partly excavated Berber-Roman city in Morocco, situated near the city of Meknes, that may have been the capital of the Kingdom of Mauretania, at least from the time of King Juba II. Before Volubilis, the capital of the kingdom may have been at Gilda.

Built in a fertile agricultural area, it developed from the 3rd century BC onward as a Berber, then proto-Carthaginian, settlement before being the capital of the kingdom of Mauretania. It grew rapidly under Roman rule from the 1st century AD onward and expanded to cover about with a circuit of walls. The city gained a number of major public buildings in the 2nd century, including a basilica, temple and triumphal arch. Its prosperity, which was derived principally from olive growing, prompted the construction of many fine town-houses with large mosaic floors.

The city fell to local tribes around 285 and was never retaken by Rome because of its remoteness and indefensibility on the south-western border of the Roman Empire. It continued to be inhabited for at least another 700 years, first as a Latinised Christian community, then as an early Islamic settlement. In the late 8th century it became the seat of Idris ibn Abdallah, the founder of the Idrisid dynasty of Morocco. By the 11th century Volubilis had been abandoned after the seat of power was relocated to Fes. Much of the local population was transferred to the new town of Moulay Idriss Zerhoun, about from Volubilis.

The ruins remained substantially intact until they were devastated by an earthquake in the mid-18th century and subsequently looted by Moroccan rulers seeking stone for building Meknes. It was not until the latter part of the 19th century that the site was definitively identified as that of the ancient city of Volubilis. During and after the period of French rule over Morocco, about half of the site was excavated, revealing many fine mosaics, and some of the more prominent public buildings and high-status houses were restored or reconstructed. Today it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, listed for being &quot;an exceptionally well preserved example of a large Roman colonial town on the fringes of the Empire&quot;.

== Name ==
The origins of its name are unknown but may be a Latinisation of the Amazigh word &quot;Walilt&quot;, meaning oleander, which grows along the sides of the valley.
It could also be seen as a direct translation of the Amazigh name if this one was related to the root WLLY meaning &quot;to turn, to spin&quot;.

The Lewis &amp; Short Latin dictionary gives the Latin meaning of &quot;volubilis&quot; as &quot;&quot;that&quot; [which] &quot;is turned round&quot; or (more freq.) &quot;that&quot; [which] &quot;turns itself round&quot;, &quot;turning&quot;, &quot;spinning&quot;, &quot;whirling&quot;, &quot;circling&quot;, &quot;rolling&quot;, &quot;revolving&quot;.&quot; The word is mentioned in Horace&#x27;s Epistles (I, 2, 43): (&quot;It flows and will flow, swirling on forever.&quot;) In Classical Latin, the &quot;v&quot; in &quot;volubilis&quot; was pronounced like a &quot;w&quot;, making the pronunciation closer to modern Amazigh and Arabic pronunciations.

Charles-Joseph Tissot (1828–1884) discovered that what some sources in Arabic referred to as &quot;Qasr Fara&#x27;on&quot; ( &quot;Pharaoh&#x27;s Palace&quot;) corresponded with Volubilis. This term is still used nowadays by the locals, sometimes shortened as El Ksar, meaning &quot;The Palace&quot;.

==Foundation and Roman occupation==
Built on a shallow slope below the Zerhoun mountain, Volubilis stands on a ridge above the valley of Khoumane (Khuman) where it is met by a small tributary stream called the Fertassa. It overlooks a rolling fertile alluvial plain north of the modern city of Meknes. The area around Volubilis has been inhabited at least since the Late Atlantic Neolithic, some 5,000 years ago; archaeological excavations at the site have found Neolithic pottery of design comparable to pieces found in Iberia. By the third century BC, the Carthaginians had a presence there, as evidenced by the remains of a temple to the Punic god Baal and finds of pottery and stones inscribed in the Phoenician language.

The city lay within the kingdom of Mauretania, which became a Roman client state following the fall of Carthage in 146 BC. The Punic influence lasted for a considerable time afterwards, as the city&#x27;s magistrates retained the Carthaginian title of &quot;suffete&quot; long after the end of Punic rule. Juba II of Numidia was placed on the Mauretanian throne by Augustus in 25 BC and turned his attention to building a second capital at Volubilis. Educated in Rome and married to Cleopatra Selene II, the daughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra, Juba and his son Ptolemy were thoroughly Romanised kings, although of Berber ancestry; their preference for Roman art and architecture was clearly reflected in the city&#x27;s design.

After Claudius annexed Mauretania in 44 AD, the city grew substantially due to its wealth and prosperity, derived from the fertile lands of the province which produced valuable export commodities such as grain, olive oil and wild animals for gladiatorial spectacles. At its peak in the late 2nd century, Volubilis had around 20,000 inhabitants – a very substantial population for a Roman provincial town – and the surrounding region was also well inhabited, to judge from over 50 villas discovered in the area. It was mentioned by the 1st century AD geographer Pomponius Mela, who described it in his work &quot;De situ orbis libri III&quot; as one of &quot;the wealthiest cities, albeit the wealthiest among small ones&quot; in Mauretania. It is also mentioned by Pliny the Elder, and the 2nd century Antonine Itinerary refers to its location and names it as &quot;Volubilis Colonia&quot;. Its population was dominated by Romanised Berbers.

The city remained loyal to Rome despite a revolt in 40–44 AD led by one of Ptolemy&#x27;s freedmen, Aedemon, and its inhabitants were rewarded with grants of citizenship and a ten-year exemption from taxes. The city was raised to the status of a &quot;municipium&quot; and its system of governance was overhauled, with the Punic-style &quot;suffetes&quot; replaced by annually elected &quot;duumvirs&quot;, or pairs of magistrates. However, the city&#x27;s position was always tenuous; it was located on the south-eastern edge of the province, facing hostile and increasingly powerful Berber tribes. A ring of five forts located at the modern hamlets of Aïn Schkor, Bled el Gaada, Sidi Moussa, Sidi Said and Bled Takourart (ancient Tocolosida) were constructed to bolster the city&#x27;s defence. Sidi Said was the base for the Cohors IV Gallorum equitata, an auxiliary cavalry unit from Gaul, while Aïn Schkor housed Hispanic and Belgic cohorts. Sidi Moussa was the location of a cohort of Parthians, and Gallic and Syrian cavalry were based at Toscolosida. Rising tensions in the region near the end of the 2nd century led the emperor Marcus Aurelius to order the construction of a circuit of walls with eight gates and 40 towers. Volubilis was connected by road to Lixus and Tingis (capital city of the Roman province of Mauretania Tingitana, modern Tangier) but had no eastwards connections with the neighbouring province of Mauretania Caesariensis, as the territory of the Berber Baquates tribe lay in between. A Jewish community existed in Volubilis in the third century, as evident from several Hebrew, Greek and Latin funeral inscriptions and Menorah-shaped lamps. It is the most south-western location where ancient Hebrew inscription has been found.

Rome&#x27;s control over the city ended following the chaos of the Crisis of the Third Century, when the empire nearly disintegrated as a series of generals seized and lost power through civil wars, palace coups and assassinations. Around 280, Roman rule collapsed in much of Mauretania and was never re-established. In 285, the emperor Diocletian reorganised what was left of the province to retain only the coastal strip between Lixus, Tingis and Septa (modern Ceuta). Although a Roman army was based in Tingis, it was decided that it would simply be too expensive to mount a reconquest of a vulnerable border region. Occupation of the city continued, however, as fine mosaics such as that of a chariot race conducted by animals in the House of Venus can not have been created earlier than the fourth century. A statue representing a good shepherd with crossed arms might hint to Christians in the town and early fourth century evidence of crossing oneself as suggested by Thouvenot. The end of the Roman city probably came in the form of an earthquake towards the end of the century, which buried numerous bronze statues in the wreckage of the houses.

==After the Romans==
Volubilis continued to be inhabited for centuries after the end of Roman control. It was certainly reoccupied by the Eastern Roman Empire in the sixth and seventh century, when three Christian inscriptions are dated by the provincial year. By the time the Arabs had arrived in 708, the city&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Oualila&quot; or &quot;Walīlī&quot;, and it was inhabited by the Awraba, a Berber tribe that originated in Libya. Much of the city centre had been abandoned and was turned into a cemetery, while the centre of habitation had moved to the southwest of the city, where a new wall was built to contain the abridged Roman town.

Volubilis remained the capital of the region well into the Islamic period. Islamic coins dating to the 8th century have been found on the site, attesting to the arrival of Islam in this part of Morocco. They are concentrated outside the city walls, which suggests that Arab settlement remained distinct from the Berber settlement inside them. It was here that Moulay Idriss established the Idrisid dynasty of Morocco in 787-8. A direct descendant of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, he escaped to Morocco from Syria following the Battle of Fakhkh in 787. He was proclaimed &quot;imam&quot; in Volubilis, occupied by the Awraba, under Ishaq ibn Mohammad. He married Kanza, from the Awraba, and fathered a son, Idris II, who was proclaimed imam in Volubilis. He, too, lived outside the walls of the city, along the banks of the Wadi Khoumane, where a complex has recently been excavated that may be identified with his headquarters. Idriss I conquered most of Northern Morocco during the three years of his reign, founding the city of Fes. He was assassinated in Volubilis in 791 on the orders of the caliph of Baghdad, Harun al-Rashid. On his majority Idriss II removed to Fes which served as his new capital, depriving Volubilis of its last vestiges of political significance.

A Muslim group known as the Rabedis, who had revolted in Córdoba in Al-Andalus (Andalusia in modern Spain), resettled at Volubilis in 818. Although people continued to live in Volubilis for several more centuries, it was probably almost deserted by the 14th century. Leo Africanus describes its walls and gates, as well as the tomb of Idris, guarded only by two or three castles. His body was subsequently removed to Moulay Idriss Zerhoun, , where a great mausoleum was built for it. The name of the city was forgotten and it was termed &quot;Ksar Faraoun&quot;, or the &quot;Pharaoh&#x27;s Castle&quot;, by the local people, alluding to a legend that the ancient Egyptians had built it. Nonetheless, some of its buildings remained standing, albeit ruined, until as late as the 17th century when Moulay Ismail ransacked the site to provide building material for his new imperial capital at Meknes. An earthquake in 1755 caused further severe destruction. However, English antiquarian John Windus had sketched the site in 1722. In his 1725 book &quot;A Journey to Mequinez&quot;, Windus described the scene:

Visiting 95 years later in 1820, after the 1755 earthquake had flattened the few buildings left standing, James Gray Jackson wrote:


Walter Burton Harris, a writer for &quot;The Times&quot;, visited Volubilis during his travels in Morocco between 1887 and 1889, after the site had been identified by French archaeologists but before any serious excavations or restorations had begun. He wrote:

==Excavation, restoration and UNESCO listing==

Much of Volubilis was excavated by the French during their rule over French Morocco between 1912 and 1955, but the excavations at the site began decades earlier. From 1830, when the French conquest of Algeria began the process of extending French rule over much of northern, western and central Africa, archaeology was closely associated with French colonialism. The French army undertook scientific explorations as early as the 1830s and by the 1850s it was fashionable for French army officers to investigate Roman remains during their leave and spare time. By the late 19th century French archaeologists were undertaking an intensive effort to uncover northwest Africa&#x27;s pre-Islamic past through excavations and restorations of archaeological sites.

The French had a very different conception of historic preservation to that of the Moroccan Muslims. As the historian Gwendolyn Wright puts it, &quot;The Islamic sense of history and architecture found the concept of setting off monuments entirely foreign&quot;, which &quot;gave the French proof of the conviction that only they could fully appreciate the Moroccan past and its beauty.&quot; Emile Pauty of the &quot;Institut des Hautes Études Marocaines&quot; criticised the Muslims for taking the view that &quot;the passage of time is nothing&quot; and charged them with &quot;let[ting] their monuments fall into ruin with as much indifference as they once showed ardour in building them.&quot;

The French programme of excavation at Volubilis and other sites in French-controlled North Africa (in Algeria and Tunisia) had a strong ideological component. Archaeology at Roman sites was used as an instrument of colonialist policy, to make a connection between the ancient Roman past and the new &quot;Latin&quot; societies that the French were building in North Africa. The programme involved clearing modern structures built on ancient sites, excavating Roman towns and villas and reconstructing major civic structures such as triumphal arches. Ruined cities, such as Timgad in Algeria, were excavated and cleared on a massive scale. The remains were intended to serve, as one writer has put it, as &quot;the witness to an impulse towards Romanization&quot;.

This theme resonated with other visitors to the site. The American writer Edith Wharton visited in 1920 and highlighted what she saw as the contrast between &quot;two dominations look[ing] at each other across the valley&quot;, the ruins of Volubilis and &quot;the conical white town of Moulay Idriss, the Sacred City of Morocco&quot;. She saw the dead city as representing &quot;a system, an order, a social conception that still runs through all our modern ways.&quot; In contrast, she saw the still very much alive town of Moulay Idriss as &quot;more dead and sucked back into an unintelligible past than any broken architrave of Greece or Rome.&quot; As Sarah Bird Wright of the University of Richmond puts it, Wharton saw Volubilis as a symbol of civilisation and Moulay Idriss as one of barbarism; the subtext is that &quot;in ransacking the Roman outpost, Islam destroyed its only chance to build a civilised society&quot;. Fortunately for Morocco, &quot;the political stability which France is helping them to acquire will at last give their higher qualities time for fruition&quot;—very much the theme that the French colonial authorities wanted to get across. Hilaire Belloc, too, spoke of his impression being &quot;rather one of history and of contrast. Here you see how completely the new religion of Islam flooded and drowned the classical and Christian tradition.&quot;

The first excavations at Volubilis were carried out by the French archaeologist Henri de la Martinière between 1887 and 1892. In 1915 Hubert Lyautey, the military governor of French Morocco, commissioned the French archaeologists Marcel and Jane Dieulafoy to carry out excavations in Volubilis. Although Jane&#x27;s ill-health meant that they were unable to carry out the programme of work that they drew up for Lyautey, the work went ahead anyway under Louis Chatelain. The French archaeologists were assisted by thousands of German prisoners of war who had been captured during First World War and loaned to the excavators by Lyautey. The excavations continued on and off until 1941, when the Second World War forced a halt.

Following the war, excavations resumed under the French and Moroccan authorities (following Morocco&#x27;s independence in 1955) and a programme of restoration and reconstruction began. The Arch of Caracalla had already been restored in 1930–34. It was followed by the Capitoline Temple in 1962, the basilica in 1965–67 and the Tingis Gate in 1967. A number of mosaics and houses underwent conservation and restoration in 1952–55. In recent years, one of the olive-oil production workshops in the southern end of the city has been restored and furnished with a replica Roman oil press. These restorations have not been without controversy; a review carried out for UNESCO in 1997 reported that &quot;some of the reconstructions, such as those on the triumphal arch, the capitolium, and the oil-pressing workshop, are radical and at the limit of currently accepted practice.&quot;

From 2000 excavations carried out by University College London and the Moroccan Institut National des Sciences de l&#x27;Archéologie et du Patrimoine under the direction of Elizabeth Fentress, Gaetano Palumbo and Hassan Limane revealed what should probably be interpreted as the headquarters of Idris I just below the walls of the Roman town to the west of the ancient city centre. Excavations within the walls also revealed a section of the early medieval town. Today, many artefacts found at Volubilis can be seen on display in the Rabat Archaeological Museum.

UNESCO listed Volubilis as a World Heritage Site in 1997. In the 1980s, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) organised three conferences to assess possible nominations to the World Heritage List for sites in North Africa. It was unanimously agreed that Volubilis was a good candidate for the list and in 1997 ICOMOS recommended that it be inscribed as &quot;an exceptionally well preserved example of a large Roman colonial town on the fringes of the Empire&quot;, which UNESCO accepted.

==City layout and infrastructure==

Prior to the Roman occupation, Volubilis covered an area of about , built on a V-shaped ridge between the Fertassa and Khoumane wadis on a roughly north–south axis. It was developed on a fairly regular pattern typical of Phoenician/Carthaginian settlements and was enclosed by a set of walls. Under the Romans, the city was expanded considerably on a northeast–southwest axis, increasing in size to about . Most of the city&#x27;s public buildings were constructed in the older part of the city. The grand houses for which Volubilis is famous are in the newer part, behind the Decumanus Maximus (main street), which bisected the Roman-era part of the city. The decumanus was paved, with footways on either side, and was lined with arcaded porticoes on either sides, behind which were dozens of shops. The Arch of Caracalla marks the point at which the old and new cities merge. After the aqueduct fell into disrepair with the end of the Roman occupation, a new residential area was constructed to the west near the Wadi Khoumane.

The city was supplied with water by an aqueduct that ran from a spring in the hills behind the city. The aqueduct may have been constructed around 60–80 AD and was subsequently reconstructed on several occasions. An elaborate network of channels fed houses and the public baths from the municipal supply and a series of drains carried sewage and waste away to the river to be flushed. The aqueduct ran under the Decumanus Secundus, a street that ran parallel with the Decumanus Maximus, and terminated at a large fountain in the city centre near the Arch of Caracalla.
Most of the original pre-Roman city wall was built over or destroyed, but a stretch of the original wall, which was made of mud bricks on a stone foundation, can still be seen near the tumulus. The Roman city walls stretch for and average thick. Built of rubble masonry and ashlar, they are mostly still extant. The full circuit of walls had 34 towers, spaced at intervals of about one every , and six main gates that were flanked by towers. A part of the eastern wall has been reconstructed to a height of . The Tingis Gate, also reconstructed, marks the northern-eastern entrance to Volubilis. It was constructed in 168/169 AD – the date is known due to the discovery of a coin of that year that was deliberately embedded in the gate&#x27;s stonework by its builders.

An early medieval wall stands to the west of the Arch of Caracalla; it was built after the end of the Roman occupation, apparently some time in the 5th or 6th centuries, to protect the eastern side of the city&#x27;s new residential area. It was oriented in a north–south direction and was constructed using stone looted from ruined buildings elsewhere in the abandoned areas of the city.

===Commerce===

During Roman times, Volubilis was a major producer of olive oil. The remains of buildings dedicated to olive pressing are still readily visible, as are the remains of the original presses and olive mills. One such building has been reconstructed with a full-size replica of a Roman olive press. Olive oil was central to the life of the city, as it was not just a foodstuff but was also used for lamps, bathing and medicines, while the pressed olives were fed to animals or dried out and used as fuel for the bathhouses. For this reason, even some of the grandest mansions had their own olive presses. Fifty-eight oil-pressing complexes have so far been discovered in Volubilis. They housed a standard set of elements: a mill, used to crush the olives, a decantation basin to catch the oil from pressed olives, and a press that comprised a counterweight, a &quot;prelum&quot; or cross-bar and the wooden supports within which the &quot;prelum&quot; was fixed. The olives were first crushed into a paste, then put into woven baskets that were subjected to pressing. The olive oil ran out into the decantation basin, to which water was periodically added to make the lighter oil float to the surface. This was then scooped out of the basin and poured into amphorae. There is also substantial evidence of the city being a lively commercial centre. No fewer than 121 shops have been identified so far, many of them bakeries, and judging from the number of bronzes found at the site it may also have been a centre for the production or distribution of bronze artworks.

==Notable buildings==

Although only about half of Volubilis has been excavated, a number of prominent public buildings are still visible and some, notably a basilica and a triumphal arch, have been reconstructed. Many private buildings, including the mansions of the city&#x27;s elite, have also been uncovered. They are especially notable for the fine mosaics that have been discovered in a number of buildings and which are still &quot;in situ&quot; in the houses where they were laid. The buildings were mostly made from locally quarried grey-blue limestone. Very little remains of the original Punic settlement, as it lies under the later Roman buildings.

A large tumulus of uncertain origin and purpose stands approximately in the middle of the excavated area, between the old and new parts of the city. Various theories have been advanced to explain it, such as that it was a burial site, a religious structure of some kind, a funerary monument or a monument to a Roman victory. However, these remain unproven hypotheses.

===Public buildings===

Two major public buildings are readily visible at the centre of the city – the basilica and the Capitoline Temple. The basilica was used for the administration of justice and the governance of the city. Completed during the reign of Macrinus in the early 3rd century, it is one of the finest Roman basilicas in Africa and is probably modelled on the one at Leptis Magna in Libya. The building is long by wide and originally had two storeys. Its interior is dominated by two rows of columns framing the apses at each end of the building where the magistrates sat. The outer wall of the basilica, which is faced with columns, overlooks the forum where markets were held. Small temples and public offices also lined the forum, which would have been full of statues of emperors and local dignitaries, of which only the pedestals now remain. Not much is known about the public buildings which existed in Volubilis prior to the start of the 3rd century, as the buildings currently visible were built on the foundations of earlier structures.

The Capitoline Temple stands behind the basilica within what would originally have been an arcaded courtyard. An altar stands in the courtyard in front of 13 steps leading up to the Corinthian-columned temple, which had a single cella. The building was of great importance to civic life as it was dedicated to the three chief divinities of the Roman state, Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. Civic assemblies were held in front of the temple to beseech the aid of the gods or to thank them for successes in major civic undertakings such as fighting wars. The layout of the temple, facing the back wall of the basilica, is somewhat unusual and it has been suggested that it may have been built on top of an existing shrine. An inscription found in 1924 records that it was reconstructed in 218. It was partly restored in 1955 and given a more substantial restoration in 1962, reconstructing 10 of the 13 steps, the walls of the cella and the columns. There were four more small shrines within the temple precinct, one of which was dedicated to Venus.

There were five other temples in the city, of which the most notable is the so-called &quot;Temple of Saturn&quot; that stood on the eastern side of Volubilis. It appears to have been built on top of, or converted from, an earlier Punic temple, which may have been dedicated to Baal. It is a sanctuary with a surrounding wall and a three-sided portico. In its interior was a small temple with a cella built on a shallow podium. The temple&#x27;s traditional identification with Saturn is purely hypothetical and has not generally been accepted.
Volubilis also possessed at least three sets of public baths. Some mosaics can still be seen in the Baths of Gallienus, redecorated by that emperor in the 260s to become the city&#x27;s most lavish baths. The nearby north baths were the largest in the city, covering an area of about . They were possibly built in the time of Hadrian.

===Triumphal arch===

The Arch of Caracalla is one of Volubilis&#x27; most distinctive sights, situated at the end of the city&#x27;s main street, the Decumanus Maximus. Although it is not architecturally outstanding, the triumphal arch forms a striking visual contrast with the smaller Tingis Gate at the far end of the decumanus. It was built in 217 by the city&#x27;s governor, Marcus Aurelius Sebastenus, to honour the emperor Caracalla and his mother Julia Domna. Caracalla was himself a North African and had recently extended Roman citizenship to the inhabitants of Rome&#x27;s provinces. However, by the time the arch was finished both Caracalla and Julia had been murdered by a usurper.

The arch is constructed from local stone and was originally topped by a bronze chariot pulled by six horses. Statues of nymphs poured water into carved marble basins at the foot of the arch. Caracalla and Julia Domna were represented on medallion busts, though these have been defaced. The monument was reconstructed by the French between 1930 and 1934. However, the restoration is incomplete and of disputed accuracy. The inscription on the top of the arch was reconstructed from the fragments noticed by Windus in 1722, which had been scattered on the ground in front of the arch.

The inscription reads (after the abbreviations have been expanded):

IMPERATORI CAESARI MARCO AVRELLIO ANTONINO PIO FELICI AVGVSTO PARTHICO MAXIMO BRITTANICO MAXIMO GERMANICO MAXIMO
PONTIFICI MAXIMO TRIBVNITIA POTESTATE XX IMPERATORI IIII CONSVLI IIII PATRI PATRIAE PROCONSVLI ET IVLIAE AVGVSTAE PIAE FELICI MATRI

or, in translation:

For the emperor Caesar, Marcus Aurelius Antoninus [Caracalla], the pious, fortunate Augustus, greatest victor in Parthia, greatest victor in Britain, greatest victor in Germany, &quot;Pontifex Maximus&quot;, holding tribunician power for the twentieth time, Emperor for the fourth time, Consul for the fourth time, Father of the Country, Proconsul, and for Julia Augusta [Julia Domna], the pious, fortunate mother of the camp and the Senate and the country, because of his exceptional and new kindness towards all, which is greater than that of the &quot;principes&quot; that came before, the Republic of the Volubilitans took care to have this arch made from the ground up, including a chariot drawn by six horses and all the ornaments, with Marcus Aurelius Sebastenus, &quot;procurator&quot;, who is most deeply devoted to the divinity of Augustus, initiating and dedicating it.

===Houses and palaces===

The houses found at Volubilis range from richly decorated mansions to simple two-room mud-brick structures used by the city&#x27;s poorer inhabitants. The city&#x27;s considerable wealth is attested by the elaborate design of the houses of the wealthy, some of which have large mosaics still &quot;in situ&quot;. They have been named by archaeologists after their principal mosaics (or other finds):

* The &quot;House of Orpheus&quot; in the southern part of the city thus takes its name from the large Orpheus mosaic, showing the god playing his harp to an audience of trees, animals and birds. As Paul MacKendrick puts it, the mosaic is rather artlessly executed, as the animals are all of different sizes and face in different directions with no relationship to Orpheus. It appears that the mosaicist simply copied patterns from a book without attempting to integrate the different elements. The mosaic is situated in the triclinium, the dining room, where the diners would have reclined on couches set against the walls and admired the central mosaic. Other mosaics can be seen in the atrium, which has a depiction of Amphitrite in a chariot pulled by a seahorse and accompanied by other sea creatures, and in the bathing rooms. One room off the main courtyard has a mosaic of a dolphin, considered by the Romans to be a lucky animal.
* The &quot;House of the Athlete or Desultor&quot;, located near the forum, contains a humorous mosaic of an athlete or acrobat riding a donkey back to front while holding a cup in his outstretched hand. It may possibly represent Silenus. The most prestigious houses in the city were situated adjoining the Decumanus Maximus, behind rows of shops that lined the street under an arcade. They were entered from side streets between the shops.
* The &quot;House of the Ephebe&quot; was named after a bronze statue found there. It has a prominent interior courtyard leading to a number of public rooms decorated with mosaics, including a depiction of Bacchus in a chariot being drawn by leopards.
* The &quot;House of the Knight&quot; next door also has a mosaic of Bacchus, this time shown coming across the sleeping Ariadne, who later bore him six children. The house takes its name from a bronze statue of a rider found here in 1918 that is now on display in the archaeological museum in Rabat. It was a large building, with an area of about , and incorporated a substantial area dedicated to commercial activities including eight or nine shops opening onto the road and a large olive-pressing complex.


* The &quot;House of the Labours of Hercules&quot; is named for the mosaic depicting the twelve tasks that the demigod had to perform as penance for killing his wife and children. It is thought to have been created during the reign of the emperor Commodus, who identified himself with Hercules. Jupiter, his lover Ganymede and the four seasons are depicted in another mosaic in the house. The house was of palatial size, with 41 rooms covering an area of .
* A building dubbed the &quot;Gordian Palace&quot; is located further up the Decumanus Maximus. It was the largest building in the city and was probably the residence of the governor, rather than the emperor Gordian III; it was rebuilt during Gordian&#x27;s reign in the mid-3rd century. It combined two separate houses to create a complex of 74 rooms with courtyards and private bathhouses serving both domestic and official functions. It also incorporated a colonnaded front with a dozen shops behind the colonnade, and an oil factory consisting of three oil presses and an oil store in the north-east corner of the complex. The decoration of the Gordian Palace is today quite plain with only a few scanty mosaics remaining. Despite its presumed high status, the floors seem to have been mostly rendered with &quot;opus sectile&quot; rather than decorated with mosaics. Inscriptions found in the palace testify to the city&#x27;s decline and eventual fall. They record a series of treaties reached with the local Berber chieftains, increasing in number as the city became more vulnerable and the tribesmen pressed harder. By the time of the final treaty, just a few years before the fall of the city, the chieftains were being treated as virtual equals of Rome – an indication of how much Roman power in the area had declined. The last two inscribed altars, from 277 and 280, refer to a &quot;foederata et diuturna pax&quot; (a &quot;federated and lasting peace&quot;), though this proved to be a forlorn hope, as Volubilis fell soon afterwards.
* The &quot;House of Venus&quot;, towards the eastern side of the city under a prominent cypress tree, was one of the most luxurious residences in the city. It had a set of private baths and a richly decorated interior, with fine mosaics dating from the 2nd century AD showing animal and mythological scenes. There were mosaics in seven corridors and eight rooms. The central courtyard has a fanciful mosaic depicting racing chariots in a hippodrome, drawn by teams of peacocks, geese and ducks. The mosaic of Venus for which the house is named has been removed to Tangier, but in the next-door room is a still-extant mosaic showing Diana and a companion nymph being surprised by Actaeon while bathing. Actaeon is depicted with horns beginning to sprout from his head as he is transformed by the angry goddess into a stag, before being chased down and killed by his own hunting dogs. The house appears to have been destroyed some time after the city&#x27;s fall around 280; a mosaic depicting Cupids feeding birds with grain has been charred by what appears to have been a fire burning directly on top of it, perhaps resulting from the building being taken over by squatters who used the mosaic as the site of a hearth.

The same building was also the site of the discovery in 1918 of a bronze bust of outstanding quality depicting Cato the Younger. One of the most notable artefacts discovered at Volubilis, it is now on display in the Archaeological Museum in Rabat. It was still on its original pedestal when it was found by archaeologists. The bust has been dated to the time of Nero or Vespasian and may be a copy of a bust created in Cato&#x27;s lifetime or shortly thereafter. Its inscription identifies its subject as the orator. Another outstanding bust, depicting a Hellenistic prince, was discovered in a bakery across the street. It seems to have been made at the same time as the Cato bust and may well have come from the House of Venus, where an empty pedestal in another room suggests that the Cato had a companion piece. The bust, which is also on display in Rabat, is usually identified as Juba II but other possibilities include Hiero II of Syracuse, Cleomenes III of Sparta, Juba I or Hannibal.

===Headquarters of Idris I===
Just outside the walls of the city, on the floodplain of the Oued Khoumane, was found a series of interlocking courtyard buildings, of which the largest contained a hammam, or bath. This is an L-shaped structure, with a cold room paved with flagstones and benches running along the sides. At the end is found a plunge pool with three steps leading into it. From the cold room one moved to a vestibule at the corner of the building, decorated with a relief of a shield taken from the Arch of Caracalla. From there, one moved into the warm room, still covered by a vault, and finally into the hot room. The vault of this has now been restored, but it is possible to see the channels in the floor through which the hot air passed. Beyond this a furnace heated the room, as well as the hot water which would have flowed into basins in the corners. The courtyard of which this hammam formed the western limit was large, and contained numerous large silos for grain storage. To the south of this courtyard was one evidently designed for reception, with long narrow rooms to the east and west, one of which was painted red, with a low bench or divan at one end. Further south a third courtyard, only partially excavated, seems to have been devoted to domestic use. The plan, with its large courtyards and narrow rooms, is very different from the contemporary one or two-roomed structures inside the walls, probably inhabited by the Berbers of the Awraba tribe. It is dated by coins and pottery to the reign of Idris I, and has been identified as his headquarters.

<text>The Klickitat River is a tributary of the Columbia River, nearly long, in south-central Washington in the United States. It drains a rugged plateau area on the eastern side of the Cascade Range northeast of Portland, Oregon. In 1986, of the river were designated Wild and Scenic from the confluence with Wheeler Creek, near the town of Pitt, to the confluence with the Columbia River.

==Course==
The Klickitat River rises in the high Cascades near Gilbert Peak, in northwestern Yakima County, in a remote corner of the Yakama Indian Reservation. It flows southeast, then generally south across the Lincoln Plateau. It enters northern Klickitat County, and meanders south through steep canyons. It enters the Columbia from the north at Lyle, approximately north-northwest of The Dalles, Oregon. State Route 142 follows the lower of the river. The river is bridged by State Route 14 at its mouth.

==Recreation==
The Klickitat Trail follows the river on an abandoned railroad grade from near Goldendale, Washington to the Columbia River just west of The Dalles, Oregon, nearly .

<text>Xcopilot is a Palm Pilot emulator that runs under Unix/X11. 

It offers emulation of the timer, serial ports, touch pad and LCD along with Motorola 68000 emulation (m68k), specifically the Freescale DragonBall used in Palm Pilots until they switched to Intel XScale ARM processors (later DragonBalls were based on an ARM core not a 68000 but retained the same name, however were not used by Palm.) Xcopilot was originally developed by Ivan Curtis with contributions from Ian Goldberg, Jef Dionne, Kresten Krab Thorup, and Andrew Pfiffer based on the Windows program Copilot. While the original Copilot application eventually turned into the Palm OS Emulator, the Unix/X11 port branched off and enjoyed its own popularity. Written in 1997, Xcopilot was aimed at developers of applications on the Palm OS platform, freeing them from the drudgery of interfacing to the real hardware during the development process.

Xcopilot found a new role in the 2000s with the development of uCLinux, a version of Linux meant for very low-end microprocessors without an MMU. Today Xcopilot is no longer maintained but is still useful for trying out uClinux.

The band also includes vocalist Matěj Ruppert, guitarist Oldřich Krejčoves, bassist Pavel Mrázek, drummer Martin Houdek, keyboardist Ondřej Brousek, and vocalist Tereza Černochová. As of 2025, they have released eleven studio albums.

==History==
Monkey Business formed in Prague, Czechia, in 1999. The band initially consisted of vocalist Matěj Ruppert, guitarist Oldřich Krejčoves, bassist Pavel Mrázek, drummer Martin Houdek, and keyboardist Ondřej Brousek. Their debut album, &quot;Why Be in When You Could Be Out&quot;, was released in 2000 and included contributions from Iranian-Czech percussionist Imran Musa Zangi and American trombonist Fred Wesley. The group subsequently added a second vocalist, the American-Czech Tonya Graves, who had previously sung in the band Liquid Harmony.

Monkey Business released their second album, &quot;Save the Robots&quot;, in 2001, and it once again featured contributions from Fred Wesley as well as drummer Dennis Chambers, guitarist Hiram Bullock, and singer Dan Bárta.

The band&#x27;s third record, &quot;Resistance Is Futile&quot;, came out in 2003 and included work by Iva Bittová, Jiří Stivín, Roman Dragoun, and Hiram Bullock.

In 2005, Monkey Business published their fourth album, titled &quot;Kiss Me on My Ego&quot;. It featured contributions from Imran Musa Zangi, Dan Bárta, Hiram Bullock, Glenn Hughes, and David Sanborn.

The album &quot;Objects of Desire and Other Complications&quot; followed in 2007, with input from guest musicians such as Imran Musa Zangi and Kamil Střihavka.

Monkey Business released &quot;Twilight of Jesters?&quot; in 2009, a record that again featured Glenn Hughes and Dan Bárta, as well as Vlastimil Třešňák and Ashley Slater.

&quot;Happiness of Postmodern Age&quot; followed in 2013, with contributions from Dan Bárta, Ivan Mládek, and Joan Baez. The band&#x27;s eighth studio album, titled &quot;Sex and Sport? Never!&quot;, came out in 2015 and featured Mike Stern, Gábor Presser, and Marta Kubišová.

Tonya Graves left Monkey Business in 2016, and she was replaced on vocals by Tereza Černochová before the 2018 release of &quot;Bad Time for Gentlemen&quot;. The record, the band&#x27;s ninth, included input from Fred Wesley and Ashley Slater. The band followed it in 2020 with &quot;Freedom on Sale&quot;, with help from Dan McCafferty and Ashley Slater.

The latest album by Monkey Business is &quot;Když Múzy Mlčí&quot;, issued in 2024.

<text>Olympic Summer Games is an official video game of the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Games. It is the successor to &quot;Olympic Gold&quot; and &quot;Winter Olympics&quot;. It was the last &quot;Olympic&quot; video game released for the fourth generation of consoles, as well as the Game Boy.

It follows the already common button mashing techniques of previous (and future) games, with the usual exceptions.

It has 10 events (three more than &quot;Olympic Gold&quot;), with all but two based on track and field events. Unlike &quot;Winter Olympics&quot;, there are no major differences between each event on different platforms.

== Athletes ==
The game comes with eight preset athletes to choose from, but the player can customize their names and nationalities before entering events.

* Paul
* Chris
* David
* Kevin
* Gary
* Colin
* Ian
* Jon

==Events==
*100 m sprint
*110 m hurdles
*Pole vault
*High jump
*Long Jump
*Triple Jump
*Javelin
*Discus
*Archery
*Skeet

==Gameplay==
As in the previous titles, there are three difficulty levels and both Olympics and mini-Olympics (here called &quot;custom game&quot;) modes. However, the points table was removed, and the only way to compare results is by the medals&#x27; table. In the sprinting events, there are two qualifying rounds, and only the winner (out of four competitors) passes to the next round. On long jump, triple jump, discus and javelin each player has three attempts; the best 10 progress to the final and have three extra attempts. The best result overall wins. In high jump and pole vault, there are not qualifying rounds; the players jump in turns until missing three consecutive jumps.

==Release==
In addition to fourth generation consoles, &quot;Olympic Summer Games&quot; was developed for the three major fifth generation consoles of the time: the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. However, the Saturn version, though completed, was never released.

==Reception==
&quot;GamePro&quot;″s Bruised Lee and Johnny Ballgame gave negative reviews to, respectively, the Genesis and Super NES versions. They criticized the bland, simplistic graphics, shortage of sound effects, repetitive music, and the lack of variety in the gameplay of the different events. Bruised Lee remarked that the Genesis version was even worse than the Super NES one. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; contended that &quot;Although buried behind substandard graphics (even for 16-bit standards), &quot;Olympic Summer Games&quot; features the multiple player gameplay that made &quot;Track and Field&quot; so popular.&quot; He described the gameplay&#x27;s demand for a combination of intense button pounding and precise timing to be both an effective challenge and a traditionally fun experience, and scored the Super NES version three out of five stars.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; gave the 3DO version three out of five stars as well. The reviewer again praised the combination of button mashing and timing, and noted that while the graphics do not measure up to &quot;International Track &amp; Field&quot; or &quot;DecAthlete&quot;, those two games would not have been able to run on the 3DO without significant compromises.

Reviewing the Game Boy version in &quot;GamePro&quot;, Coach Kyle praised the graphics and animation, but criticized the sound effects and said the gameplay was uninvolving.

The two sports reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; scored the PlayStation version 6.0 and 6.5 out of 10, complaining of low frame rates and a lack of lasting appeal. Johnny Ballgame said that some of the events require little skill, run too long, or suffer from poor graphics. He concluded, &quot;Individually, some events have their moments. Overall, though, this game needs more training before competing against world-class competition like &quot;International track &amp; Field&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="1204115" wikidata="Q757282" url="?curid=1204115" title="Levaillant's woodpecker">
<text>Levaillant&#x27;s woodpecker (Picus vaillantii) or Levaillant&#x27;s green woodpecker, is a large African member of the woodpecker family Picidae. 
==Taxonomy==
Levaillant&#x27;s woodpecker is sometimes considered a subspecies of the European green woodpecker. It is monotypic, meaning it has no subspecies. 

This species was named in honour of the French explorer, collector and ornithologist, François Le Vaillant.
==Distribution and habitat==
Levaillant&#x27;s woodpecker is found in the three Maghreb countries Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia in northwest Africa. It breeds in mountain forests up to the treeline at around 2000m. 

==Description==
Levaillant&#x27;s woodpecker is 30–33 cm in length with a 45–51 cm wingspan. It is very similar to the European green woodpecker and the Iberian Green woodpecker (especially females). Both Levaillant&#x27;s woodpecker and the Iberian Green woodpecker were formerly considered subspecies of &quot;P. viridis&quot;.

Levaillant&#x27;s woodpecker is dark green above and yellowish green below, with a crimson nape. The black moustache has a pale border above. The rump is chrome yellow and the outer webs of the primaries are barred black and white. The bill and feet are slate grey.

Sexes are similar except that the male has a crimson crown, whereas the female&#x27;s crown is grey. Like &quot;.P. v. sharpei&quot;, both sexes lack the black on the lores and around the eye shown by most forms of the green woodpecker.

The call is a loud ringing laugh, &quot;plue, plue, plue&quot;, very like the green woodpecker&#x27;s yaffle, but perhaps slightly faster.

==Behaviour==
This woodpecker&#x27;s insect food is captured by a rapid outward flick of the long tongue, and gummed to its tip by sticky saliva. Though a large and heavy bird it has an easy, bounding flight. The nest is a hole in a tree, and 4-8 glossy white eggs are laid on wood chips.

<doc id="1204123" wikidata="Q2083758" url="?curid=1204123" title="Space gun">
<text>A space gun, sometimes called a Verne gun because of its appearance in &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; by Jules Verne, is a method of launching an object into space using a large gun- or cannon-like structure. Space guns could thus potentially provide a method of non-rocket spacelaunch. It has been conjectured that space guns could place satellites into Earth&#x27;s orbit (although after-launch propulsion of the satellite would be necessary to achieve a stable orbit), and could also launch spacecraft beyond Earth&#x27;s gravitational pull and into other parts of the Solar System by exceeding Earth&#x27;s escape velocity of about . However, these speeds are too far into the hypersonic range for most practical propulsion systems and also would cause most objects to burn up due to aerodynamic heating or be torn apart by aerodynamic drag. 
Therefore, a more likely future use of space guns would be to launch objects into Low Earth orbit, at which point attached rockets could be fired or the objects could be &quot;collected&quot; by maneuverable orbiting satellites.

In Project HARP, a 1960s joint United States and Canada defence project, a U.S. Navy 100 caliber gun was used to fire a projectile at , reaching an apogee of , hence performing a suborbital spaceflight. However, a space gun has never been successfully used to launch an object into orbit or out of Earth&#x27;s gravitational pull.

== Technical issues ==
The large g-force likely to be experienced by a ballistic projectile launched in this manner would mean that a space gun would be incapable of safely launching humans or delicate instruments, rather being restricted to freight, fuel or ruggedized satellites.

A space gun by itself is not capable of placing objects into a stable orbit around the object (planet or otherwise) they are launched from. The orbit is a parabolic orbit, a hyperbolic orbit, or part of an elliptic orbit which ends at the planet&#x27;s surface at the point of launch or another point. This means that an uncorrected ballistic payload will always strike the planet within its first orbit unless the velocity was so high as to reach or exceed escape velocity. As a result, all payloads intended to reach a closed orbit need at least to perform some sort of course correction to create another orbit that does not intersect the planet&#x27;s surface.

A rocket can be used for additional boost, as planned in both Project HARP and the Quicklaunch project. The magnitude of such correction may be small; for instance, the StarTram Generation 1 reference design involves a total of of rocket burn to raise perigee well above the atmosphere when entering an low Earth orbit.

In a three-body or larger system, a gravity assist trajectory might be available such that a carefully aimed escape velocity projectile would have its trajectory modified by the gravitational fields of other bodies in the system such that the projectile would eventually return to orbit the initial planet using only the launch delta-v.

Isaac Newton avoided this objection in his thought experiment by placing his notional cannon atop a tall mountain and positing negligible air resistance. If in a stable orbit, the projectile would circle the planet and return to the altitude of launch after one orbit (see Newton&#x27;s cannonball).

=== Acceleration ===
For a space gun with a gun barrel of length (formula_1), and the needed velocity (formula_2), the acceleration (formula_3) is provided by the following formula:

:formula_4

For instance, with a space gun with a vertical &quot;gun barrel&quot; through both the Earth&#x27;s crust and the troposphere, totalling ~ of length (formula_1), and a velocity (formula_2) enough to escape the Earth&#x27;s gravity (escape velocity, which is on Earth), the acceleration (formula_3) would theoretically be more than , which is more than 100 g-forces, which is about 3 times the human tolerance to g-forces of maximum 20 to 35 &quot;g&quot; during the ~10 seconds such a firing would take.This calculation does not take into account the decreasing escape velocity at higher altitudes.

==Practical attempts==
===V3 Cannon (1944-45)===
The German V-3 cannon program, during World War II was an attempt to build something approaching a space gun. Based in the Pas-de-Calais area of France it was planned to be more devastating than the other Nazi &#x27;Vengeance weapons&#x27;. The cannon was capable of launching , diameter shells over a distance of . It was destroyed by RAF bombing using Tallboy blockbuster bombs in July 1944.

=== Super High Altitude Research Project (1985-95)===
The US Ballistic Missile Defense program sponsored the Super High Altitude Research Project (SHARP) in the 1980s. Developed at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, it is a light-gas gun and has been used to test fire objects at Mach 9.

===Project Babylon (1988-90)===
The most prominent recent attempt to make a space gun was artillery engineer Gerald Bull&#x27;s Project Babylon, which was also known as the &#x27;Iraqi supergun&#x27; by the media. During Project Babylon, Bull used his experience from Project HARP to build a massive cannon for Saddam Hussein, leader of Ba&#x27;athist Iraq. Bull was assassinated before the project was completed.

=== Quicklaunch (1996-2016)===
After cancellation of SHARP, lead developer John Hunter founded the Jules Verne Launcher Company in 1996 and the Quicklaunch company. As of September 2012, Quicklaunch was seeking to raise $500 million to build a gun that could refuel a propellant depot or send bulk materials into space.

Ram accelerators have also been proposed as an alternative to light-gas guns. Other proposals use electromagnetic techniques for accelerating the payload, such as coilguns and railguns.

==In fiction==

The first publication of the concept may be Newton&#x27;s cannonball in his 1728 book &quot;A Treatise of the System of the World&quot;, although it was primarily used as a thought experiment regarding gravity.

Perhaps the most famous representations of a space gun appear in Jules Verne&#x27;s 1865 novel &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; and his 1869 novel &quot;Around the Moon&quot; (loosely interpreted into the 1902 film &quot;Le Voyage dans la Lune&quot;), in which astronauts fly to the Moon aboard a ship launched from a cannon. Another famous example is used by the Martians to launch their invasion in H. G. Wells&#x27; 1897 book &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. Wells also used the concept in the climax of the 1936 film &quot;Things to Come&quot;. In one of the first Polish Sci-Fi novels, &quot;On the Silver Globe&quot; by Andrzej Żuławski, published in 1903, astronauts are launched to the Moon using a space gun. The device was featured in films as late as 1967, such as &quot;Jules Verne&#x27;s Rocket to the Moon&quot;.

In the 1991 video game &quot;&quot;, Percival Lowell builds a space gun to send a spacecraft to Mars.

The 1992 video game &quot;Steel Empire&quot;, a shoot &#x27;em up with steampunk aesthetics, features a space gun in its seventh level that is used by the main villain General Styron to launch himself to the Moon.

In Hannu Rajaniemi&#x27;s 2012 novel &quot;The Fractal Prince&quot;, a space gun at the &quot;Jannah-of-the-cannon&quot;, powered by a 150-kiloton nuclear bomb, is used to launch a spaceship from Earth.

The 2015 video game &quot;SOMA&quot; features a space gun used to launch satellites.

Gerald Bull&#x27;s assassination and the Project Babylon gun were also the starting point for Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s 1994 novel &quot;The Fist of God&quot;. In Larry Bond&#x27;s 2001 novella and 2015 novel &quot;Lash-Up&quot;, China uses a space gun to destroy American GPS satellites.

In the 2004 role-playing game &quot;Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&quot;, a village of Bob-ombs operates a space gun to send Paper Mario and company to the X-Naut&#x27;s base on the Moon.

Gerald Bull and Project Babylon are integral to the plot of Louise Penny&#x27;s 2015 novel &quot;The Nature of the Beast&quot;.

<text>Descended from Copilot, Palm OS Emulator is used for writing, testing, and debugging Palm OS applications. Palm OS Emulator emulates Motorola 68000-class devices and has intimate knowledge of Palm OS&#x27;s inner working, allowing for the close monitoring of correct application operation. Unlike Xcopilot (another descendant of Copilot), Palm OS Emulator will not boot uClinux. By using &quot;skin&quot; files, Palm OS Emulator could very closely mimic the appearance of many models of Palm handheld.

All versions of Palm OS Emulator require a file containing the ROM image to boot. ROM image files can be obtained from PalmSource (now part of Access Co., Ltd), or downloaded from a real Palm device. Palm OS Emulator supported Palm models produced by Palm, Handera, Handspring, and Symbol. Palm OS handhelds produced by Sony (the Clie line) were supported by a separate, Sony-specific fork of Palm OS Emulator.

Both Copilot and Palm OS Emulator are released under the GPL v2. Versions were developed by Palm, Inc. for Windows, Macintosh, and Unix platforms. The Sony fork was only released for Windows.

Palm OS Emulator supports Palm OS 4.x and earlier. It cannot support Palm OS 5.x and later, as those versions are based on the ARM processor. PalmSource provides simulators for Palm OS 5.x and up, where the Palm OS has been recompiled to run natively under Windows.

Linux, Mac, and Windows versions of the emulator were included on the CD-ROM included with &quot;Palm Programming: The Developer&#x27;s Guide&quot;, published by O&#x27;Reilly in 1999.

<doc id="1204141" wikidata="Q29024969" url="?curid=1204141" title="Industrial civilization">
<text>Industrial civilization refers to the state of civilization following the Industrial Revolution, characterised by widespread use of powered machines. The transition of an individual region from pre-industrial society into an industrial society is referred to as the process of industrialisation, which may occur in different regions of the world at different times. Individual regions may specialise further as the civilisation continues to advance, resulting in some regions transitioning to a service economy, or information society, or post-industrial society (these are still dependent on industry, but allow individuals to move out of manufacturing jobs). The present era is sometimes referred to as the Information Age . De-industrialization of a region may occur for a range of reasons.

Industrial civilization has allowed a significant growth both in world population, thanks to mechanised agriculture and advances in modern medicine, and in the standard of living.

Such a civilization is mostly dependent on fossil fuel, with efforts underway to find alternatives for energy production. Some areas have exhibited de-industrialization as certain industries go into decline, or are superseded.

== Contrast with other terms ==
=== Contrast with industrial society ===

&quot;Industrial civilization&quot; refers to the broader state of civilization, which spans multiple societies; industrial society just to specific segments (within the civilization) dependent on manufacturing jobs, whilst industrial civilisation as a whole involves many regions interdependent (via international trade) specialized in different ways, including information society and service economy. Note that these societies are still dependent on industrial civilization for their goods, and food imports coming from mechanised agriculture.

=== Contrast with Industrial Revolution ===

The Industrial Revolution is the historical event that ushered in industrial civilization. The modern world has evolved further following development in mass production and information technology (allowing service economy, and information society).

=== Contrast with industrialisation ===

&quot;Industrialisation&quot; is the process of any individual area being transformed. Industrial civilisation as a whole may have regions that still benefit from industrial societies, without being industrialised themselves, or having specialised in other ways (e.g. service economies).

<doc id="1204147" wikidata="Q6550920" url="?curid=1204147" title="Lincoln Park (New Orleans)">
<text>Lincoln Park was a noted amusement park in New Orleans, Louisiana from 1902 to 1930. It was located in the city&#x27;s Gert Town section, on the downtown side of Carrollton Avenue between Olive and Forshay Streets (near where Earhart Boulevard intersects Carrollton Ave now). It was devoted to amusements for the city&#x27;s African American population.

== History ==
Lincoln Park was created in May, 1902 when the Standard Brewing Company bought the site from Yazoo and Mississippi River Railroad Company. The New Orleans City Council had already given permission to the brewing company to make a private park on the property if they purchased the land. The Standard Brewing Company fenced in the park, built a large pavilion dance hall behind the Carrollton Avenue entrance, and charged 15 cents for entrance. For several years in the first decade of the 1900s the adjacent block across Short Street was &quot;Johnson Park&quot;.

== Entertainment ==
Lincoln Park contained a skating rink, and featured hot air balloon ascensions on weekends. Other entertainment included prize fighting and vaudeville shows.

Early jazz musicians such as Buddy Bolden, Bunk Johnson, Freddie Keppard were heard there, and John Robichaux&#x27;s Orchestra was a regular feature.

<doc id="1204150" wikidata="Q2717246" url="?curid=1204150" title="Chionoecetes">
<text>Chionoecetes is a genus of crabs that live in the northern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

Common names for crabs in this genus include &quot;queen crab&quot; (in Canada) and &quot;spider crab&quot;. The generic name &quot;Chionoecetes&quot; means snow (, &#x27;) inhabitant (,&#x27;); &#x27; means [[shepherd]], and &quot;[[Chionoecetes opilio|C. opilio]]&quot; is the primary species referred to as snow crab. Marketing strategies, however, employsnow crab&quot;&#x27; for any species in the genus &quot;Chionoecetes&quot;. The name &quot;snow crab&quot; refers to their being commonly found in cold northern oceans.

==General==
Snow crabs are caught as far north as the Arctic Ocean, from Newfoundland to Greenland and north of Norway in the Atlantic Ocean, and across the Pacific Ocean, including the Sea of Japan, the Bering Sea, the Gulf of Alaska, Norton Sound, and even as far south as California for &quot;Chionoecetes bairdi&quot;.

In 2019, the Norwegian Supreme Court ruled that the species is considered a sedentary species living on the seabed, and thus governed by the United Nations Law of the Sea.

==Species==

Seven extant species are currently recognised in the genus:
*&quot;Chionoecetes angulatus&quot; – triangle tanner crab
*&quot;Chionoecetes bairdi&quot; – tanner crab, bairdi, or inshore tanner crab
*&quot;Chionoecetes elongatus&quot; 
*&quot;Chionoecetes japonicus&quot; – beni-zuwai crab
*&quot;Chionoecetes opilio&quot; – snow crab or opilio
*&quot;Chionoecetes pacificus&quot; 
*&quot;Chionoecetes tanneri&quot; – grooved tanner crab

== Cookery ==

Crabs are prepared and eaten as a dish in many different ways all over the world. The legs are usually served in clusters and are steamed, boiled, or grilled. Snow crab can also be used as an ingredient in other dishes such as snow crab macaroni and cheese.

== Food web position and importance ==
Snow crabs are an important part of the ecosystem throughout the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. They eat other invertebrates on the benthic shelf like crustaceans, bivalves, brittle stars, polychaetes, phytobenthos, foraminiferans, annelid worms, and mollusks. They are also fed on by halibut, cod, larger snow crabs, seals, squid, and Alaskan king crabs. Snow crabs are also highly sought after for the commercial fishing industry.

== Life history stages and vulnerabilities ==
Juvenile snow crabs mature in cold-water pools on the ocean floor that are sustained by melting sea ice. If waters warm above the 2 °C maximum necessary for juvenile development, their normal nursery habitat will be reduced significantly. Adults are similarly unlikely to tolerate conditions of more than 5 °C. With a gestation period of up to two years and an average spawn size of up to 100,000 eggs, their fecundity (i.e., fertility) is high, but recent trends have shown that these characteristics do not make them impervious to threats like a warming climate.

== Population decline in the Bering Sea ==
2018 was one of the warmest years coinciding with periods of the lowest sea ice extent on record in the Bering Sea. The driver of this trend was the northeast Pacific marine heatwave, which contributed to significant die-offs in a number of species. 2019 was yet another year of record-breaking temperatures, attributed to a weakened North Pacific High, which reduced evaporative cooling in the Northeast Pacific and saw a steep decline in the number of juvenile crabs.

In 2021, crabs of all ages declined, and habitat range shrank substantially. 2022 saw the most drastic decline in Bering Sea snow crab populations, decreasing from 11.7 billion in 2018 to 1.9 billion in 2022 (a decline of approximately 84%). This decimation of the crustaceans’ population spurred the closing of the Alaska snow crab season for the first time in history, an industry worth approximately $160,000,000 annually.

== Theories regarding decline ==
Though the cause is yet unknown, several theories behind this decimation have been put forward. Overfishing is likely the main driver, intertwined with the effects of climate change. Increased water temperatures also increase snow crabs’ metabolism, so one theory is that their increased metabolic rate – combined with fewer resources due to a shrinking habitat – left them to either starve or consume each other. Predator range expansion is another possibility; as waters warm, predators that normally inhabit warmer southern waters (such as the Pacific cod) can travel further north in search of prey. A third theory is that a reduction in habitat area could increase the spread of diseases like bitter crab syndrome. All these theories tie back to an altogether warmer ocean and are supported by the impacts of low ice delineated in Thoman et al. (2020).

== Bering Sea climatic impacts on snow crab ==
The Bering Sea&#x27;s southeastern shelf is composed of 3 biophysical domains: 1) a vertically well-mixed upper region (0–50m); 2) a middle region that is well-mixed in winter and stratified in summer (50–100m); and 3) an outer region with more gradual stratification (100–200m). The Bering Sea shelf break (a zone where the shallower continental shelf drops off into the North Aleutians Basin) is the dominant driver of primary productivity in the Bering Sea – upwelling brings nutrients from the cold waters of the Aleutian basin to mix in shallow waters. This area is called home to many ecologically important species, including the snow crab.

To assess trends and impacts of the warming climate in the Bering Sea, a recent study created a regional model of both physical and biological elements of the Bering Sea using three global climate simulations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment. This model detected overall trends of warmer temperatures and a retreat of sea ice in the southeastern Bering Sea. Primary drivers of these higher water column temperatures include increasing air temperature and northward wind stress. Warming trends on the outer Bering Sea shelf are concerning for a variety of reasons, one of which being that they may lead to decreased production of large crustacean zooplankton. On a broader spatial scale, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) that marked the start of summer in the North Pacific now come 11 days earlier and SSTs that marked the end of summer now come around 27 days later. Additionally, summers are on average 1.5 °C warmer and winters are on average 0.5 °C warmer.

Historically, the Bering Sea continental shelf maintains between 40–100% ice cover at its annual winter maximum. In 2018, the maximum sea ice cover was only 47% of the 1979–2016 mean seasonal maximum extent. Southeastward advection of melting sea ice contributes to the latitudinal salinity gradient of the Bering Sea, so when sea ice formation is reduced, the salinity gradient is altered. Though these don’t seem like significant changes, the inherent thermal conductivity of water (its ability to absorb heat) means that small changes like these are a big deal for marine organisms like the snow crab. It is yet unknown whether the Bering Sea snow crab population will recover, but scientists and policymakers will need to act quickly if improvement is to occur.

<doc id="1204154" wikidata="Q3249599" url="?curid=1204154" title="Military career of Muhammad">
<text>The military career of Muhammad ( – 8 June 632), the Islamic prophet, encompasses several expeditions and battles throughout the Hejaz region in the western Arabian Peninsula which took place in the final ten years of his life, from 622 to 632. His primary campaign was against his own tribe in Mecca, the Quraysh. Muhammad proclaimed prophethood around 610 and later migrated to Medina after being persecuted by the Quraysh in 622. After several battles against the Quraysh, Muhammad conquered Mecca in 629, ending his campaign against the tribe.

Alongside his campaign against the Quraysh, Muhammad led campaigns against several other tribes of Arabia, most notably the three Arabian Jewish tribes of Medina and the Jewish fortress at Khaybar. He expelled the Banu Qaynuqa tribe for violating the Constitution of Medina in 624, followed by the Banu Nadir who were expelled in May 625 after being accused of plotting to assassinate him. Finally, in 628, he besieged and invaded the Jewish fortress of Khaybar, which hosted more than 10,000 Jews, which Muslim sources say was retaliation for planning to ally themselves with the local Arab pagan tribes.During the final years of his life, Muhammad sent several armies against the Byzantine Empire and the Ghassanids in northern Arabia and the Levant, before conquering Mecca in 630 and leading a campaign against some Arab pagan tribes close to Mecca, most notably in Ta&#x27;if. The last army led by Muhammad before his death was in the Battle of Tabuk in October 630. By the time he died in 632, Muhammad had managed to unite most of the Arabian Peninsula, laying the foundation for the subsequent Islamic expansion under the caliphates and defining Islamic military jurisprudence.

==Background==
===Muhammad&#x27;s role in The Islamic Ghazwat===

In his prophetic biography () titled &quot;The Sealed Nectar (&quot;), Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri cites Ibn Hisham in saying that Muhammad took part in the Ghazwat Wars, which took place between an alliance of the Quraysh and the Kinanah and the Qais &#x27;Ailan, when he was 15, saying that &quot;his efforts were confined to picking up the arrows of the enemy as they fell, and handing them over to his uncles.&quot;

===Situation in Medina===
Medina was divided into five tribes: two of them the Khazraj and Aws, while the Jews were represented by, from smallest to largest, the Banu Qaynuqa, Banu Nadir and Banu Quraizah. Upon his arrival in Medina, Muhammad set about the establishment of a pact known as the Constitution of Medina, to regulate the matters of governance of the city, as well as the extent and nature of inter-community relations, and signatories to it included the Muhajirun, the Ansar and the Jewish tribes of Medina. Significant clauses of the constitution included the mutual assistance of each other if one signatory were to be attacked by a third party, the resolution that the Muslims would profess their religion and the Jews theirs, as well as the appointment of Muhammad as the leader of the state.

And the threat to the life of both the Ansar and the Muhajireen was such that they were reported as having to sleep by their weapons all night. As tensions escalated the Muslims began to take defensive measures such as stationing guards around Muhammad and sending out reconnaissance patrols.

After initially refusing to accede to requests by his followers to fight the Meccans for continued persecution and provocation, he eventually proclaimed the revelations of the Quran:
::&quot;Permission to fight is given to those who are fought against because they have been wronged -truly Allah has the power to come to their support- those who were expelled from their homes without any right, merely for saying, &#x27;Our Lord is Allah&#x27;...&quot;-Surah 22:39–40

==History==
===Campaign against the Jews of Medina===
====Expulsion of the Banu Qaynuqa&#x27;====
In April 624, after the Battle of Badr, the Banu Qaynuqa violated the Constitution of Medina by shaming a Muslim woman by pinning and tearing her clothes. A Muslim man who witnessed this, killed the Jewish man responsible for it in retaliation. The Jews came in group against the Muslim and killed him. After a successive chain of similar revenge killings, enmity grew between Muslims and the Banu Qaynuqa&#x27;, which led Muhammad to lay siege to their fortress. The Qaynuqa&#x27; had a strength of around 700. After being besieged for 14–15 days, the tribe eventually surrendered to Muhammad, who initially wanted to capture the men of Banu Qaynuqa&#x27;, but ultimately yielded to Abdullah ibn &#x27;Ubayy and agreed to expel the Qaynuqa&#x27;. The tribe eventually went northward toward Der&#x27;aa in modern-day Syria and assimilated themselves into the local Jewish population.

====Expulsion of the Banu Nadir====
In May 625, Muhammad laid siege to the Banu Nadir, after he came to know that they were plotting to assassinate him. The siege is said to have lasted anywhere between six and fifteen days. Enjoying their strategic advantage due to the thick foliage of palm trees surrounding their castles, the Banu Nadir pelted the Muslims with stones and showered arrows upon them from their castles. In response, Muhammad is said to have commanded the burning of the palm trees. The tribe eventually surrendered and was expelled, moving northward toward Khaybar, another Jewish fort city around 150 km (95 mi) north of Medina and was captured again during the Battle of Khaybar. They were allowed to live around Khaybar until the Rashidun caliph, &#x27;Umar ibn al-Khattab, expelled them for a second time.

====Invasion of the Banu Qurayza====

During the Battle of the Trench in December 626 and January 627, the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza, whose forts were located in southern Medina, were caught conspiring to ally themselves with the confederates and were charged with treachery. After the retreat of the coalition, Muslims besieged their forts, and they were the last of the Jewish tribes of Medina. The Banu Qurayza surrendered and all the men and one woman were beheaded, apart from a few who converted to Islam, while all the other women and children were enslaved.

In dealing with Muhammad&#x27;s treatment of the Jews of Medina, aside from political explanations, western historians and biographers have explained it as &quot;the punishment of the Medinan Jews, who were invited to convert and refused, perfectly exemplify the Quran&#x27;s tales of what happened to those who rejected the prophets of old.&quot; Francis Edward Peters adds that Muhammad was possibly emboldened by his military successes and also wanted to push his advantage. Economical motivations, according to Peters, also existed since the poorness of the Meccan migrants was a source of concern for Muhammad. Peters argues that Muhammad&#x27;s treatment of the Jews of Medina was &quot;quite extraordinary&quot; and is &quot;quite at odds with Muhammad&#x27;s treatment of the Jews he encountered outside Medina.&quot;

According to Welch, Muhammad&#x27;s treatment of the three major Jewish tribes brought Muhammad closer to his goal of organizing a community strictly on a religious basis.

====Siege of Khaybar====
In March 628, according to Muslims sources, the Jews of Khaybar, along with the Banu Nadir, who were exiled from Medina by Muhammad for violating the Constitution of Medina, and the Banu Ghatafan, were planning to attack the Muslims. When Muhammad learned of their alliance, he gathered an army of 1,500 soldiers and besieged the Jewish fortress at Khaybar. Scottish historian and orientalist, William Montgomery Watt agrees with this view. Italian orientalist Laura Veccia Vaglieri claims other motives pushed Muhammad to invade the forts of Khaybar.

On the other side, the Banu Ghatafan were afraid that the Muslims would attack them at any time, so they refused to help the Jews at Khaybar. After capturing six of the eight Jewish forts in Medina, the Jews of Khaybar finally surrendered and were allowed to live in the oasis on the condition that they would give one-half of their produce to the Muslims. Two Jewish commanders were killed in the siege.

They continued to live in the oasis for several more years until they were expelled by caliph &#x27;Umar ibn al-Khattab. The imposition of tribute upon the conquered Jews served as a precedent for provisions in the Islamic law for the &quot;jizya&quot;.
===Byzantine campaign===
In the final years of his life, after suppressing the two main factions that were leading in the opposition against him; the Meccans and the Jews, Muhammad led an active campaign against the main force in the north, the Byzantine Empire, which was involved in several wars against the Sasanian Empire, known as the Roman–Persian Wars.

Following a defeat in the Battle of Mu&#x27;tah in Muhammad&#x27;s campaign against the Byzantine began with the final expedition led by Muhammad himself, the Tabuk expedition, which is also known as the Usra expedition. Muhammad heard of the gathering of a large Byzantine–Ghassanid alliance against the Muslims in Tabuk and led a force of some 30,000 men to look for them. After waiting and scouting for the enemy for twenty days, Muhammad returned to Medina.

==Statistics==
The number of all casualties on all sides, in all the battles of Muhammad, is approximately 1,000. A contemporary Islamic scholar, Maulana Wahiduddin Khan, says that &quot;during the 23-years in which this revolution was completed, 80 military expeditions took place. Fewer than 20 expeditions actually involved any fighting. 259 Muslims and 759 non-Muslims died in these battles – a total of 1018 dead.&quot;
Most of those killed were men from the Banu Qurayza tribe after they surrendered to a siege as an aftermath of the Invasion of Banu Qurayza.

==Legacy==
Javed Ahmed Ghamidi writes in Mizan that there are certain directives of the Qur’an pertaining to war which were specific only to Muhammad against divinely-specified peoples of his times (the polytheists and the Israelites and Nazarites of Arabia and some other Jews, Christians, et al.) as a form of divine punishment—for they had persistently denied the truth of Muhammad&#x27;s mission even after it had been made conclusively evident to them by Allah through Muhammad, and asked the polytheists of Arabia for submission to Islam as a condition for exoneration and the others for jizya and submission to the political authority of the Muslims for military protection as the &quot;dhimmis&quot; of the Muslims. Therefore, after Muhammad and his companions, there is no concept in Islam obliging Muslims to wage war for propagation or implementation of Islam, hence now, the only valid reason for war is to end oppression when all other measures have failed or, &quot;jihad&quot;.

<doc id="1204170" wikidata="Q4033080" url="?curid=1204170" title="ASP pistol">
<text>The ASP is a custom-made pistol designed and built by Paris Theodore (owner of Seventrees, Ltd., a custom gun leather shop in New York City) from the early 1970s to 1987. The ASP was based on the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 39 pistol. The ASP featured clear Lexan grips allowing the shooter to see how much ammunition is left, a rounded hammer, hooked trigger guard, and no front sight. The ASP was responsible for later innovations made in the development of concealable handguns.

==Design==
The ASP was a reworked Smith &amp; Wesson Model 39 or 39-2, employing a shortened slide, a fixed bushing (in lieu of the Smith &amp; Wesson designed collet bushing); the unique Guttersnipe sight system, clear Lexan grip-panels, a fully ramped and throated shortened barrel, and a smoothed and radiused profile to ensure no risk of snagging on the draw.

The fixed bushing was tightly fitted to the shortened barrel and dry-lubricated by durable Teflon-S, which was applied to all components of the pistol, except for the clear Lexan grip panels. The unique sighting system, referred to as the &quot;Guttersnipe&quot;, was a narrowing U-channel with fluorescent yellow panels that would form three triangles, all pointed at the target when the sight was properly aligned.

Checkering was kept to a minimum, and reserved for the frontstrap and backstrap, as opposed to the grip panels, which were smooth to prevent the drawing hand from catching prematurely on draw, thereby minimizing the risk of any misalignment of the pistol during presentation, aiming, and firing.

The ASP was made in either right-handed, or left-handed models, as the extended trigger guard (which included a recurved hook for the index finger of the supporting hand, one of the earliest known instances of such a feature) was cut away on the side of the strong-sided hand (which would depend on the handedness of the individual using the pistol).

Included with the gun was a patented double magazine pouch which used a magnet to hold the spare magazines in place. The cost for the complete ASP modification package on a customer-supplied handgun was $475, and was done by a subsidiary company, Armament Systems and Procedures, Inc.

Production of holsters and magazine carriers for the ASP were contracted out to Ken Null, who still produces those designs. Theodore ceased production of the ASP in 1987.

==Devel pistol==
In 1976, a gunsmith from Cleveland, Ohio named Charles Kelsey ordered an ASP pistol, but never received one. His experience led him to develop an improved version of the ASP. Working with firearms instructor Ken Hackathorn, he developed the Devel pistol.

The wood grips featured a clear Lexan insert, allowing the shooter a visual account of the number of rounds in the magazine. The pistols were coated in an electroless nickel finish and featured traditional sights. Kelsey sent a sample gun to Smith &amp; Wesson, for a factory agreement to produce these pistols on a large scale. An agreement was never reached, yet several of Kelsey&#x27;s improvements were incorporated into the S&amp;W 3913.
==In popular culture==
Novelist John Gardner, successor of Ian Fleming as author of the &quot;James Bond&quot; novels, chose the ASP as the main weapon used by James Bond for the remainder of the continuation novels. The weapon also serves as Bond&#x27;s sidearm in the 1989 comic book &quot;Permission to Die&quot;.

The ASP pistol is a usable weapon in &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot;.

<text>IAM (pronounced &quot;I am&quot;) is a French hip hop band from Marseille. Formed in 1989, it comprises Akhenaton (AKH; Philippe Fragione), Shurik&#x27;n (Geoffroy Mussard), Khéops (Éric Mazel), Imhotep (Pascal Perez) and Kephren (François Mendy). IAM has several meanings, including &quot;Invasion Arrivée de Mars&quot; (&quot;Invasion from Mars&quot;; Mars is frequently used as a metaphor for Marseille in IAM songs). Another meaning is Imperial Asian Man, while AKH often refers to &quot;L&#x27;homme Impérial Asiatique&quot;.

== Themes ==
One of IAM&#x27;s central themes in its songs is Africa. The group, which is one of the pioneer French rap groups, draws heavily in their music on allusions to Africa and particularly ancient Egypt. Their 1991 song &quot;Les tam-tam de l&#x27;Afrique&quot; was one of the first French rap hits to deal expressly with the issue of slavery. Using a sample of a Stevie Wonder song, &quot;Les tam-tam de l&#x27;Afrique&quot; focuses on the &quot;abduction of its inhabitants, the Middle Passage, and the plantation system in the Americas&quot;.

IAM promotes an ideology that is based upon images associated with ancient Egypt, primarily upon the mythical allusions to pharaohs. By 1989 the group developed a unique rap style, mixing French beats and lyrics with Middle Eastern and Egyptian influences. Their stage names are of Egyptian origin; one of the group members, Eric Mazel, goes by the name Kheops, an allusion to the Egyptian pharaoh who built pyramids. This connection with ancient Egypt allows IAM &quot;to assert connections to the contemporary Arab world in an indirect way.&quot;

Indeed, this &quot;pharaoism&quot;, as French rap music specialist Andre Previous calls it, represents an attempt to negotiate and maintain a cultural identity in the context of a social scene rife with racist and discriminatory ideologies. Because many Muslims don&#x27;t feel at home in white French society, references to Arabic origins and Islamic fundamentalism are part of a highly socially contested discourse on identity politics in French music. Thus, by employing &#x27;pharaoism&#x27; to hide these references to and elicitations of the Arab world, IAM successfully articulates its connections with the &quot;Franco-Maghrebi&quot; cause and establishes an important social space for itself. The pharaoist aspects of IAM&#x27;s rap help the group stay in touch with its origins where some non-white French people have assimilated unquestioningly into the surrounding French culture. Therefore, the group&#x27;s rap is both politically charged and defiant, as it attempts to subvert notions of racial superiority by &quot;[proposing] multiracial alliance as an alternative to the &#x27;old&#x27; [French] politics.&quot; Most importantly, rap provides IAM with a place to address social issues and speak out against racial intolerance where the group can actually be heard. In fact, the first single release from their second album, &quot;Je danse le Mia&quot;, &quot;went on to prove an enormous hit on the French mainstream&quot;, according to French radio station RFI Musique. In this way, the use of &#x27;pharaoism&#x27; as a mystical and coded strategy for the injection of Arabic and Egyptian lyrics, ideas, and sentiments into the music is what makes it commercially viable. Otherwise, if the music were any more outright in its references to Arabic origins, white French conservatives might identify it with Islamic Fundamentalism&#x27;s grips over North African diasporatic communities living in France and try to censor it and impede the cause it stands for.

&quot;&#x27;Les tams-tams de l&#x27;Afrique&#x27; was one of the first hits of French rap and dealt expressly with slavery. Using a sample of &#x27;Pastime Paradise&#x27; by Stevie Wonder, this track focused on the plunder of Africa, the abduction of its inhabitants, the Middle Passage, and the plantation system in the Americas&quot;.

== Collaborations ==
IAM have a long history of collaborations with the American hip hop group, the Wu-Tang Clan. IAM have sampled an Inspectah Deck lyric from the Wu-Tang Clan song &quot;C.R.E.A.M&quot;, which states &quot;Life as a shorty shouldn&#x27;t be so rough&quot; in their 1998 single, &quot;Petit frère&quot;. Additionally, they featured a number of Wu-Tang affiliated artists on their 1997 single &quot;La saga&quot; and later members Method Man and Redman on their 2004 single &quot;Noble Art&quot; the video was directed by New York-based artist &quot;Brad Digital&quot;. They were also featured in the song of RZA &quot;Seul face à lui&quot;. These hip hop groups have a number of similarities, probably due to the fact that IAM member Akhenaton has listed Wu-Tang as one of his five favorite hip hop artists of all time. One notable example is that both groups have connections to Islam. The Wu-Tang Clan are known members of the Five-Percent Nation and often include Islamic references in their music. On the previously mentioned IAM collaboration, &quot;La saga,&quot; rapper Prodigal Sunn states that &quot;IAM, sunz of man from the royal fam, never ate ham, never gave a damn&quot;, referencing the dietary restrictions that Muslims have to follow. Similarly, French rappers IAM have used their music to display an alternative Muslim identity &quot;[Ref. necessary]&quot;. IAM also collaborated with US rapper Lucas on the song &quot;Spin the Globe&quot; with rappers from 5 different countries spitting in 5 different languages showcasing the universal appeal and voice of hip hop.

<text>Rákosliget is a part of the 17th district of Budapest since January 1, 1950. It is known to locals as &#x27;Liget&#x27;

==History==
In 1896 The Workmen&#x27;s Insurance Society (Munkásbiztosító Pénztár) started to build a homes for workmen in an unpopulated neighbourhood of Rákoskeresztúr. The founders were unable to finance the constructions so the homes were eventually bought by middle-class families mainly of merchants, civil servants, and craftsmen. The growing settlement became independent of Rákoskeresztúr( 1907 ). 
In 1930 it had a population of 3112 inhabitants and the number of craftsmen was over 100. Its main street that comes from Rákoskeresztúr called Ferihegyi street divides it into two parts indicated by the numbering of the surrounding streets: on the left there are streets identified by Roman odd numbers (I., III., V., etc. utca) whereas on the right are the even numbered streets (II., IV., etc. utca). A common local witticism is to call these streets &quot;avenues&quot; referring to the similar street numbering of New York, for example: V. utca=Fifth Avenue. Rákosliget was attached to Budapest on 1 January 1950 as part of the 17th district.

==Culture==
Rákosliget has its own theatre named after Gyula Gózon, a famous Hungarian actor who lived there. It also has its own community center called Csekovszky Árpád Művelődési Ház.

==Famous Ligeti people==
* Gózon Gyula (great Hungarian actor)
* Csekovszky Árpád (ceramist)
* Gregor József (well-known Hungarian bass opera singer)

<doc id="1204201" wikidata="Q7995596" url="?curid=1204201" title="White crappie">
<text>The white crappie (Pomoxis annularis) is a freshwater fish found in North America, one of the two species of crappies. Alternate common names for the species include goldring, silver perch, white perch and . is named for the fish. The genus name &quot;Pomoxis&quot; refers to crappies&#x27; sharp operculum, while the species name &quot;annularis&quot; means &#x27;having rings&#x27;, i.e., it has vaguely vertical bars on the body.

==Description==
White crappies are morphologically similar to black crappies (&quot;Pomoxis nigromaculatus&quot;). They have 5–10 dark vertical bars along their bodies, rather than randomly scattered spots like those of the black crappie. The white crappie has a silvery color with green or brown shades along its back, with dark lateral bars along its side, and a white belly. The dorsal fins of the white crappie start farther back on the body than those of the black crappie. The anal fin is about the same size as the dorsal fin. The white crappie has six dorsal fin spines, whereas the black crappie has seven or eight dorsal fin spines. White crappies are also slightly more elongated than black crappies. The white crappie is a deep-bodied fish with a flattened body, or a depth that is one-third of the length of the fish. White crappies have spinous rays and ctenoid fish scales found in advanced teleosts. The exposed part of the scale has tiny tooth-like projections (cteni). Both species of crappies have a terminal mouth position with many small, conical teeth in two rows along the mouth, which are called cardiform because they resemble a tool used for wool carding. Crappies belong to the family Centrarchidae in the order Perciformes within class Actinopterygii.

The white crappie rarely exceeds , and typically lives 2–7 years. The species is generally about in length as an adult. The current International Game Fish Association all-tackle world record for a white crappie is , caught on July 31, 1957, near Enid Dam, Mississippi, by angler Fred Bright, while the IGFA all-tackle length world record is a fish, caught on October 14, 2022, in Grenada Lake, Mississippi, by angler Doug Borries.

==Distribution==
White crappies are native to the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi River basins expanding from New York and southern Ontario westward to South Dakota and southward to Texas. This species has a large geographic range in the United States and currently has a stable population. Currently, this species is listed as a least concern species for conservation efforts.

==Habitat==
White crappies can be found in large rivers, reservoirs, and lakes. White crappies are more tolerant of turbid (murky) waters than black crappies, and the white crappie usually outnumbers the black crappie in turbid waters. White crappies also generally outnumber black crappies in areas with little rooted aquatic vegetation. White crappies are most commonly found in rivers and low-velocity areas such as pools and backwaters of rivers. They are most abundant in lakes and reservoirs larger than 5 acres. The white crappie can be found in the open water during the mornings and evenings, but during the day this species is found in shallower, quiet waters ( deep) surrounded by structure.

==Reproduction==
White crappies spawn in May and June when the water temperature reaches . Males construct nests by creating small, bowl-shaped depressions on the bottom around brush, rocks, and logs in the shallow water. During the spawning season, males develop dark coloration on their throats. Females lay 5,000 to 30,000 eggs. The males guard these nests until the fry swim away. Males guard these nests because it helps ensure the success of their genes being passed on to the next generation. The white crappie typically grows within the first year of its life and can grow an additional 3–4 in in the second year. The white crappies reach maturity around their second or third year. The maximum lifespan of white crappies is 8 to 10 years with the average lifespan being 3 to 4 years in unmanaged waters and 6 years in managed waters.

==Diet==
White crappies are neither cruise- nor ambush-feeding strategists. Instead, they swim intermittently and only search for prey when stationary. This strategy is considered saltatory, or pause-and-travel search. Using this strategy, juveniles can grow rapidly in the first few days of life. This strategy is energetically favored to reduce search time for the species. White crappies in the larval and juvenile stages of life eat zooplankton and continue to feed primarily on small invertebrates during their first year of life.

When white crappies reach a length of , they are considered adult. The adults feed mainly on small fish such as minnows and young American shad, and large invertebrates such as crayfish and hellgrammites. Their diet can vary depending on their location. They feed the most in June through October. In the spring, they feed moderately, with their activity slowing during the winter months. In Mississippi, they feed on mayflies such as &quot;Hexagenia atrocaudata&quot; and &quot;Pentagenia vittigera&quot;. In Illinois, and probably elsewhere, they feast on American gizzard shad. In Pennsylvania and Ohio, adults eat small common carp, yellow perch, bluegill, and other white crappies. The terminal mouth position, sometimes known as the normal position, allows for this species to feed on what is in front of it.

<text>The black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) is a freshwater fish in the sunfish family (Centrarchidae). It is endemic to North America, one of the two types of crappies. It is very similar to the white crappie (&quot;P. annularis&quot;) in size, shape, and habits, except that it is darker, with a pattern of black spots. Alternate names for the species include calico bass, speck, speckled perch, speckled bass, moonfish, grass bass, strawberry bass, shiner, crawpie, oswego bass, sac-a-lait, and marigane noire.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Pomoxis&quot;, the genus name, is Greek: &quot;poma, -atos&quot; and &quot;oxys&quot; meaning sharp operculum. This references the fish&#x27;s spined gill covers. The species name, &quot;nigromaculatus&quot;, is derived from Latin and means &quot;black-spotted&quot;.

==Description==
Black crappies are most accurately identified by the seven or eight spines on its dorsal fin (white crappies have five or six dorsal spines). Crappies have a deep and laterally compressed body. They are usually silvery-gray to green in color and show irregular or mottled black splotches over the entire body. Black crappies have rows of dark spots on their dorsal, anal, and caudal fins. The dorsal and anal fins resemble each other in shape. Both crappies have large mouths extending to below the eye, and thin lips—both suggestive of their piscivorous feeding habits. Crappies are typically about long. The current all-tackle fishing world record for a black crappie is . The maximum length reported for a black crappie is and the maximum published weight is just under .
==Distribution==
The black crappie&#x27;s range is uncertain, since it has been widely transplanted, but it is presumed to be similar to the white crappie&#x27;s. Its native range is suspected to be in the eastern United States and Canada, and as of 2005, populations existed in all of the 48 contiguous U.S. states. Introduced populations also exist in Mexico and Panama.

==Habitat==
The black crappie&#x27;s habitats are lakes, reservoirs, borrow pits, and navigation pools in large rivers. They prefer areas with little or no current, clear water, and abundant cover such as submerged timber or aquatic vegetation, as well as sand or mud bottoms like those found in lakes, ponds, streams, and sloughs.

Like &quot;P. annularis,&quot; &quot;P. nigromaculatus&quot; is very prolific and can tend to overpopulate its environment, with negative consequences both for the crappie and for other fish species. A commercial supplier of the fish, however, claims that it can be safely stocked in ponds as small as in area.

==Diet==
Crappies feed early in the morning and from about midnight until approximately 2 am. Individuals smaller than about in length eat plankton and minuscule crustaceans, while larger individuals feed on small fish (like shad), as well as minnows. Adult black crappies feed on fewer fish than white crappies do; instead they consume a larger volume of insects, insect larvae and crustaceans. According to scientific studies carried out in California, the mysid shrimp &quot;Neomysis awatschensis&quot; and amphipods of genus &quot;Corophium&quot; were most commonly eaten by all sizes of black crappie, followed by copepods, cladocerans and chironomid larvae and pupae. Although this diet is popular among black crappies in general, their diet may significantly change based on habitat, availability of food, and other factors such as amount of resource competition. The same study also showed that young, small crappie tend to feed on small aquatic invertebrate animals and changed to a fish-filled diet as they matured to adulthood. Its diet, as an adult, tends to be less dominated by other fish than that of the white crappie.

==Relationships with humans==
Crappies are a very popular sport fish, as they are easy to catch during their feeding times. There are minimal number and size restriction limits for fishing the crappie species.

==Angling==
Crappie are commonly caught on small jigs and minnow rigs. Unlike their cousins, the white crappies, black crappies are more commonly caught in clear water around structure. A common technique is spider rigging, in which one usually has 8 long rods protruding from the boat, all rigged with minnows. Fishermen can also troll for crappie with small cranks. When trolling, one should use electronics to locate suspending groups and bring one&#x27;s lure near them. Another technique for fishing docks is dock shooting, or arrow casting. To arrow cast, one should use a spinning reel. Fishermen open their bail, hold the lure and push the rod forward so that the rod is bent. They then aim the lure where they want to cast, and they simultaneously let go of the lure and release the line. This technique is used to cast the lure into the small space under a dock or tree.

==Conservation status==
Black crappies can be safely harvested under minimal, reasonable regulations, as long as there is no permanent damage to the fishery or environment. The black crappie is not listed as a species under threat on the IUCN Red List.

==Reproduction and life cycle==
Black crappies mature at 2–4 years. Growth during the first four years of their life is faster in the warm waters of the southern part of its range than in cooler waters in the north. White crappie have a higher growth rate in terms of length than black crappie. Most fish that are caught for sport are between 2 and 5 years old.

The breeding season varies by location, due to the species&#x27; great range. Breeding temperature is 14‒20 °C (58‒68 °F) and spawning occurs in spring and early summer. Spawning occurs in a nest built by the male. Males use their bodies and tails to sweep out an area of sand or mud in shallow water (between one and six feet deep) usually near a shoreline and vegetation to create a nest. Black crappies appear to nest in the most protected areas (such as places with woody debris or live vegetation) possible.

Female crappies produce an average of 40,000 spherical eggs, the number depending on their age and size. After spawning, the male watches over the nest until eggs hatch, which is usually about 2–3 days. Newly hatched fish larvae are about long and appear translucent. They stay in the nest for several days before moving to shallow, sheltered waters.

The oldest recorded age of a specimen is fifteen years, although seven years is a more typical life span for the species.

<doc id="1204205" wikidata="Q366741" url="?curid=1204205" title="Rustichello da Pisa">
<text>Rustichello da Pisa, also known as Rusticiano (fl. late 13th century), was an Italian romance writer in Franco-Italian language. He is best known for co-writing Marco Polo&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Travels of Marco Polo&quot;, while they were in prison together in Genoa. Earlier, he wrote the &quot;Roman de Roi Artus&quot; (&quot;Romance of King Arthur&quot;), also known as the &quot;Compilation&quot;, the earliest known Arthurian romance by an Italian author.

==Life and work==
Rustichello appears to have been a native of Pisa. His first known work, the French text known as the &quot;Roman de Roi Artus&quot; or, simply, the &quot;Compilation&quot;, appears to derive from a particular book in the possession of Edward I of England when he passed through Italy on his way to fighting in the Eighth Crusade in 1270 to 1274. While written in French, it is the first known romance by an Italian author to address the Arthurian legend. The &quot;Compilation&quot; contains an interpolation of the &quot;Palamedes&quot;, a now-fragmentary prose account of Arthur&#x27;s Saracen knight Palamedes, and a history of the Round Table. It was later divided into two sections, named after their principal protagonists, &quot;Meliadus&quot; (Tristan&#x27;s father) and &quot;Guiron le Courtois&quot;. Both remained popular for hundreds of years, and influenced many later works written in French as well as in Spanish, Italian, and even Greek.

Rustichello may have been captured by the Genoese at the Battle of Meloria in 1284, amid a conflict between the Republic of Genoa and the Republic of Pisa. When Polo was imprisoned around 1298, possibly after a clash between Genoa and Venice (according to tradition the Battle of Curzola), he told his tales of travel to Rustichello. Together they created the book known as &quot;The Travels of Marco Polo&quot;.

<doc id="1204208" wikidata="Q839560" url="?curid=1204208" title="United States International Trade Commission">
<text>The United States International Trade Commission (USITC or I.T.C.) is an agency of the United States federal government that advises the legislative and executive branches on matters of trade. It is an independent, bipartisan entity that analyzes trade issues such as tariffs and competitiveness and publishes reports. As a quasi-judicial entity, the USITC investigates the impact of imports on U.S. industries, and directs actions against unfair trade practices, such as subsidies; dumping; and intellectual property infringement, including copyright infringement.

==Background and statutory authority==
The USITC was established by the U.S. Congress on September 8, 1916, as the U.S. Tariff Commission. In 1974, the name was changed to the U.S. International Trade Commission by section 171 of the Trade Act of 1974. 
Statutory authority for the USITC&#x27;s responsibilities is provided by the following legislation:
* Tariff Act of 1930
* Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933
* Trade Expansion Act of 1962
* Trade Act of 1974
* Trade Agreements Act of 1979
* Trade and Tariff Act of 1984
* Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988
* Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994

==Mission==

The U.S. International Trade Commission seeks to:

# Administer U.S. trade remedy laws within its mandate in a fair and objective manner;
# Provide the President, Office of the United States Trade Representative, and Congress with independent, quality analysis, information, and support on matters of tariffs and international trade and competitiveness; and
# Maintain the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.

In so doing, the Commission serves the public by implementing U.S. law and contributing to the development and implementation of sound and informed U.S. trade policy.

The USITC&#x27;s five operations are:
# Import Injury Investigations
# Intellectual Property-Based Import Investigations
# Research Program
# Trade Information Services
# Trade Policy Support

==Commissioners==
The president nominates and the U.S. Senate confirms the six commissioners who make up the USITC. The president and the secretary of state sign the formal commission.

Commissioners&#x27; terms are nine years, or, when filling a vacated seat, for the remainder of a term. Their terms are staggered to end 18 months apart. Commissioners may not be reappointed at the start of a new term unless they have served less than five years, although commissioners stay on past the end of their term until their successor is appointed and confirmed. No more than three of the commissioners may be of the same political party.

The chairman&#x27;s term is for two years, and successive chairmen may not be of the same political party. Only a commissioner with more than one year of service may be designated chairman.

===Current commissioners===
The current commissioners :
==Hearings==
Although the USITC is not a court, its administrative law judges conduct trial-type official administrative hearings. If a Section 337 Tariff Act complaint has at least three votes from its six Commissioners, an official investigative hearing will be assigned to an administrative law judge. Several dozen new USITC investigations are filed every year. Judicial review is normally exercised by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
After the parties have had the opportunity to conduct fact and expert discovery to develop their respective legal positions, the ALJ (administrative law judge) holds a formal, evidentiary hearing, or trial.
There is no jury. About three months after considering the arguments of the parties, the ALJ renders an initial determination (ID). The full ITC reviews and may adopt, modify or reverse the ALJ&#x27;s initial determination. The ITC&#x27;s final determination is usually issued about four months after the ALJ&#x27;s ID. The USITC can impose exclusion orders that keep violating products from entering the United States. Exclusion orders are those in which disallow products from entering the United States for sale. While the Administrative Law Judges make determinations, the final decision of relief (i.e. exclusion from import) is made by the President of the United States. Should a party disagree with the decision, appeals may be made to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

== History ==
As part of a large group of legislation passed during the Progressive Era in the early 1900s, U.S. Congress established the United States Tariff Commission in 1916, which had a purpose to apply scientific principles to the study of tariffs and to assist in recommending appropriate tariff levels. Frank Taussig, then an Economics professor at Harvard University, was named the U.S. Tariff Commission&#x27;s very first chairman. The first offices of the U.S. Tariff Commission were located at 1322 New York Avenue, Washington D.C. Also in 1921, the U.S. Tariff Commission moved to the Old Post Office Building at 7th and E Street NW.

Effective January 1, 1975, the U.S. Tariff Commission was renamed the U.S. International Trade Commission. The USITC had a number of new responsibilities under the Trade Act of 1974, and commission procedures under Section 337 of Tariff Act of 1930 were greatly changed, and Section 337 proceedings brought before Administrative Law Judges had to now conform with the Administrative Procedure Act. Section 337 decisions were also made final, instead of advisory (although subject to presidential disapproval due to policy reasons), and the USITC was also authorized to issue cease and desist orders in addition to exclusion orders.

In 1988, the USITC moved its quarters from the Old Post Office Building to the building it remains in to this day, 500 E Street SW.

Past commissioners of the USITC include:

* Paula Stern (D-TN, sworn in October, 1978, for a term expiring in February 1987)
* Daniel R. Pearson (R–MN; sworn on August 8, 2003, for a term expiring on June 16, 2011)
* Shara L. Aranoff (D–MD; sworn on September 6, 2005, for a term expiring on December 16, 2012)
* Dean A. Pinkert (D–VA; sworn on February 26, 2007, for a term expiring on December 16, 2015)

On January 4, 1985, a USITC decision in favor of Duracell was overturned by President Ronald Reagan. The case involved the import of alkaline batteries in competition with Duracell, the American manufacturer that developed them.

On August 3, 2013, President Barack Obama overturned the commission&#x27;s decision in investigation No. 337-TA-794 that would have banned Apple Inc. from importing several of its older products.

In January 2015, details from the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack revealed the MPAA&#x27;s lobbying of the USITC to mandate US ISPs either at the internet transit level or consumer level internet service provider, implement IP address blocking against pirate websites as well as linking websites.

In January 2016, it became known that the commission was charged with investigating the likely impact of the TPP on the U.S. economy and specific industries. It will calculate the estimated impact on gross domestic product, exports and imports, employment opportunities, and U.S. consumers.

In January 2018, in a surprise decision, the commission unanimously overturned a 292% trade tariff that had been imposed on the aircraft manufacturer Bombardier Aerospace.

<text>The Belvedere Estate consists of Belvedere House and the grounds surrounding it. It is located in Alipore, near the zoo, in Kolkata. It served as the main residence of 1st Governor-General of Bengal Presidency, Warren Hastings. In 1803, after the residence was shifted to Government House, it was used for various purposes before the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal took up residence in Belvedere House from 1854 onwards. When the capital moved from Kolkata to Delhi in 1911, the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, who had hitherto resided in Belvedere House, was upgraded to a full governor and transferred to Government House. Belvedere House has been the home of the National Library of India since 1948.

==History==
In 1760, Mir Jafar Ali Khan, the Nawab of the province of Bengal, was compelled by the East India Company to abdicate his throne at Murshidabad to Qasim Khan. Mir Jafar moved to Kolkata where he owned a large court house, and settled within the safety of East India Company fortifications at Alipore. While he was in Kolkata, he built many buildings in the area and gifted Belvedere House to Warren Hastings.

It is not known when Hastings got the ownership of this house, but in 1763, he had made a request to the Supreme Council asking for &quot;permission of the Board to build a bridge over Collighut (Kalighat) Nulla on the road to his garden house.&quot; In 1769, according to Dutch author Stavorinus, the house was occupied by Harry Verelst and subsequently by John Cartier in 1770, both were Governors. 

After the Battle of Buxar in 1764 Hastings left for England, but returned to Kolkata as governor in 1772 and to Belvedere House with Baroness Inhoff by his side.

Hastings sold Belvedere House to Major William Tolly for Rs. 60,000 in February 1780. The grounds of Belvedere Estate were witness to a duel between Warren Hastings and his legal officer, Philip Francis, in August 1780. Tolly died in 1784 and his family sold the property to Nicholas Nugent in 1802. Then, in 1810, it was bought by John Brereton Birch and, between 1822 and 1825, it was owned by Edward Paget. It was owned by Shambhu Chandra Mukhopadhyay in 1827.

The building was subsequently acquired by James Mackillop, who sold it to the Prinsep family in June 1841. The Prinsep company sold it on to the East India Company, for use as the official residence of the Governors-General of the Presidency of Fort William, in 1854.

However, following the transfer of power from the East India Company to the British Government, the distinction of official residence of the Governors-General of the Presidency of Fort William was transferred to Government House, in 1858.

Frederick Halliday was appointed as the first Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal and, in 1858, he took up residence at Belvedere House. When the capital moved from Kolkata to Delhi in 1911, the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, who had hitherto resided in Belvedere House, was upgraded to a full governor and transferred to Government House.
After independence, in 1948, the National Library of India was transferred from The Esplanade to Belvedere House. 

The complex now includes within it, two housing colonies built by the government, one being for National Library of India employees, and the other for central government employees. The main building is under the care of the Archaeological Survey of India.

<doc id="1204214" wikidata="Q844432" url="?curid=1204214" title="Firebird (Slavic folklore)">
<text>In Slavic mythology and folklore, the
Firebird (; , &quot;zhar-ptytsia&quot;; ; ; ; , rarely also &quot;ptak-żar&quot;; ; ; ) is a magical and prophetic glowing or burning bird from a faraway land which is both a blessing and a harbinger of doom to its captor.

==Description==
The Firebird is described in one of the texts collected by Alexander Afanasyev as having &quot;golden feathers, while its eyes were like unto oriental crystal&quot;.
Other sources portray a large bird with majestic plumage that glows brightly emitting red, orange, and yellow light, like a bonfire that is just past the turbulent flame. The feathers do not cease glowing if removed, and one feather can light a large room if not concealed. In later iconography, the form of the Firebird is usually that of a smallish fire-colored falcon, complete with a crest on its head and tail feathers with glowing eyes.
==Fairy tales==

A typical role of the Firebird in fairy tales is as an object of a difficult quest. The quest is usually initiated by finding a lost tail feather, at which point the hero sets out to find and capture the live bird, sometimes of his own accord, but usually on the bidding of a father or king. The Firebird is a marvel, highly coveted, but the hero, initially charmed by the wonder of the feather, eventually blames it for his troubles.

The Firebird tales follow the classical scheme of fairy tale, with the feather serving as a premonition of a hard journey, with magical helpers met on the way who help in travel and capture of the Bird, and returning from the faraway land with the prize. There are many versions of the Firebird story as it was primarily told orally in the beginning.

===Ivan Tsarevich and the Grey Wolf===

&quot;Read full article:&quot; &quot;Tsarevitch Ivan, the Firebird and the Gray Wolf&quot;.

===Suzanne Massie version===
Suzanne Massie retells another story of the Firebird legend. A modest and gentle orphan girl named Maryushka lives in a small village. People would come from all over to buy her embroidery, and many merchants asked her to come away and work for them. She told them all that she would sell to any who found her work beautiful, but she would never leave the village of her birth. One day the evil sorcerer Kaschei the Immortal heard of Maryushka&#x27;s beautiful needlework and transformed himself into a beautiful young man and visited her. Upon seeing her ability he became enraged that a mere mortal could produce finer work than he himself possessed. He tried to tempt her by offering to make her Queen if she would embroider for him alone, but she refused saying she never wanted to leave her village. Because of this last insult to his ego he turned Maryushka into a Firebird, and himself into a great black Falcon, picked her up in his talons, and stole her away from her village. To leave a memory of herself with her village forever she shed her feathers onto the land below. As the last feather fell Maryushka died in the falcon&#x27;s talons. The glowing rainbow feathers were magic and remain undimmed, but show their colors only to those who love beauty and seek to make beauty for others.

===The Firebird and Princess Vasilisa===
Irina Zheleytova translates another version, The Firebird and Princess Vasilisa. In this version a king&#x27;s archer is on a hunt and runs across a firebird&#x27;s feather. The archer&#x27;s horse warns the archer not to touch it, as bad things will happen. The archer ignores the advice and takes it to bring back to the king so he will be praised and rewarded. When the king is presented with the feather he demands the entire firebird or the death of the archer. The archer weeps to his horse, who instructs him to put corn on the fields in order to capture the firebird. The firebird comes down to eat, allowing the archer to capture the bird. When the king is presented with the firebird he demands that the archer fetch the Princess Vassilissa so the king may marry her; otherwise, the archer will be killed. The archer goes to the princess&#x27; lands and drugs her with wine to bring her back to the king. The king is pleased and rewards the archer; however, when the princess awakes and realizes she is not home she begins to weep. If she is to be married she wants her wedding dress, which is under a rock in the middle of the Blue Sea. Once again the archer weeps to his horse and fulfills his duty to his king and brings back the dress. The princess is stubborn and refuses to marry the king even with her dress until the archer is dipped in boiling water. The archer begs to see his horse before he is boiled and the horse puts a spell on the archer to protect him from the water. The archer comes out more handsome than anyone had ever seen. The king sees this and jumps in as well but is instead boiled alive. The archer is chosen to be king and marries the princess and they live happily ever after.

===Other versions===
The Firebird concept has parallels in Iranian legends of magical birds, in the Brothers Grimm fairy tale about The Golden Bird, and related Russian magical birds like the Sirin. The story of the quest itself is closely paralleled by Armenian Hazaran Blbul. In the Armenian tale, however, the bird does not glow, but rather makes the land bloom through its song. In Czech folklore, it is called Pták Ohnivák (Fire-like Bird) and appears, for example, in a Karel Jaromír Erben fairy tale, also as an object of a difficult quest. Moreover, in the beginning of this fairy tale, the bird steals magical golden apples belonging to a king and is therefore pursued by the king&#x27;s servants in order to protect the precious apples.

The story of the firebird comes in many forms. Some folk tales say that the Firebird is a mystical bird that flies around a king&#x27;s castle and at night swoops down and eats all the king&#x27;s golden apples. Others say that the firebird is just a bird that flies around giving hope to those who need it. Some additions to that legend say that when the firebird flies around, his eyes sparkle and pearls fall from his beak. The pearls would then fall to the peasants, giving them something to trade for goods or services. In the most common version of the legend, a Tsar commands his three sons to capture the firebird that keeps flying down from above and eating his apples. The golden apples are in the Tsar&#x27;s orchard and give youth and strength to all who eat them. The sons end up barely missing the bird, but they catch one of his feathers that glows in the night. They take it to a dark room and it lights the room completely.

==Literary and musical works==
The story of the Firebird quest has inspired literary works, including &quot;The Little Humpback Horse&quot; by Pyotr Yershov and &quot;These Feathered Flames&quot; by Alexandra Overy.

The most famous version of the Firebird legend was the production by Sergei Diaghilev of Ballet Russe, who commissioned composer Igor Stravinsky to score the enormously popular large-scale ballet called &quot;The Firebird&quot;. In Stravinsky&#x27;s ballet, with a scenario written by Michel Fokine and Alexandre Benois, the creature is half-woman, half-bird. She is captured by Prince Ivan, but when he sets her free she gives him a magic feather, which he uses to defeat the spell of Kaschei the Immortal, who had captured thirteen princesses. Prince Ivan then marries the most beautiful of them.

French illustrator Edmund Dulac included a literary version of the legend of the firebird in his book &quot;Fairy Tales of the Allied Nations&quot;, where the bird is identified as the Firebird and described as &quot;Hausa, the Bird of the Sun&quot;.

In popular music, Peter Gabriel made a demo titled &quot;Firebirds&quot; whose flute playing (by Gabriel himself) borrows the melody from another piece by Stravinsky: &quot;The Rite of Passage&quot;. This song has never been officially released.

Polish writer Władysław Reymont received the Nobel Prize for his novel &quot;Chłopi&quot; (The Peasants). The story takes place in late 19th century Congress Poland and follows the everyday life of the peasantry in a typical Polish village. In the tenth chapter of book two, some of the characters gather together to exchange stories and legends, among which are mentioned the firebirds (&quot;ptaki-żary&quot;).

<doc id="1204232" wikidata="Q40111" url="?curid=1204232" title="Ahmad Tajuddin">
<text>Ahmad Tajuddin Akhazul Khairi Waddien (Jawi: ; 22 August 1913 – 4 June 1950) was the 27th Sultan of Brunei from 1924 until his death in 1950. He was succeeded by his younger brother Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III.

Ahmad Tajuddin has been disregarded by Malcolm MacDonald and frequently ignored and mishandled by others like his Gerard MacBryan. He advocated for the Sultanate to have more financial and political autonomy in a way that was innovative for his day. This, along with his support for a new political confederation governed by the Sultanate over northern Borneo, foreshadowed much of the political process that started in the late 1950s and culminated in January 1984 with the official declaration of Brunei&#x27;s independence from Britain.

==Early life and education==
Ahmad Tajuddin was born on 22 August 1913 at Istana Pekan in Brunei Town during the reign of his father, Sultan Muhammad Jamalul Alam II. He was his father&#x27;s eldest son through his royal consort, Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Siti Fatimah. Ahmad Tajuddin&#x27;s older brother, Pengiran Muda Bongsu had died in 1910. His younger brother, Pengiran Muda Omar Ali Saifuddien succeeded him after his death. Before becoming the sultan, he was known as Pengiran Muda Besar Ahmad Tajuddin.

He received his early education in the palace prior attending formal school. One of the teachers who had been assigned to teach him was Cikgu Salleh Haji Masri. Salleh Haji Masri was one of the famous freedom fighters with anti-colonial sentiments. Ahmad Tajuddin sailed for England, United Kingdom in 1932. According to reports, his mother obstructed the efforts of British Resident Eric Ernest Falk Pretty to transfer him to Malaya or England for his education; nonetheless, he started receiving English instruction from a specially assigned British instructor at the age of fourteen. He had learned English from Mr. H.F. Stalley. He was in England for a year to learn the English language and a description of the western civilisation. He was the first Sultan in history to explore the western world more than his father, who had only sailed to Singapore and Labuan.

== Reign ==
=== Early reign ===
Ahmad Tajuddin was eleven years old when he ascended to the throne as &quot;Yang di-Pertuan&quot; on 11 September 1924, following the untimely death of his father at the age of 35. Although his father&#x27;s official cause of death was listed as malaria, there was no formal inquiry held, and there were strong rumours that he had been poisoned by a close relative. An important historical point is that Brunei began exploring for oil during the rule of Ahmad Tajuddin, and in April 1929, an oil well in Seria was found, providing the country with income. This was acknowledged by the British Government, which resulted in the settling down of British Residents into Brunei.

Due to his young age of 11, the reign was temporarily held by a Council of Regency which consisted of &quot;Pengiran Bendahara&quot; Pengiran Anak Abdul Rahman and &quot;Pengiran Pemancha&quot; Pengiran Anak Haji Mohammad Yassin (also known as &quot;the two wicked uncles&quot;) from 11 September 1924 to 19 September 1931, they served as joint Regents during his seven-year minority and were said to have had a negative influence on him along with his mother. He was supposedly given a concubine at the age of thirteen, and while he was taking English lessons from a British tutor, his mother reportedly blocked efforts to send him overseas for school. It was also said that he periodically cooked his own food in soda water out of fear of poisoning.

A lavish celebration was thrown in Brunei upon his return from England. Attendees included people from nearby Sabah and Sarawak, who continued to view him as their Sultan. A traditional boat racing on the Brunei River, fireworks from Japan, and a large number of guests from other areas filled the town&#x27;s residences. Large fires were built on the nearby hills, and buildings were adorned with lanterns and multicoloured lights at night, illuminating the entire town and fostering a lively, celebratory atmosphere. 

=== Relations with the British Residency ===
Unlike his father, who had fiercely opposed the Resident&#x27;s 1909 Land Code, which affected the Kedayan minority, Ahmad Tajuddin&#x27;s timidity helped to strengthen the British Resident&#x27;s authority and prevented serious crises during his regency and early reign. However, his resistance was subdued by threats of deposition. Both Ahmad Tajuddin and his grandfather, Sultan Hashim, depended on foreigners to handle their business rather than his residents: Hashim relied on an independent Englishman, and Tajuddin on a Malayan private secretary and Gerard MacBryan.Between 1931 and 1950, Ahmad Tajuddin expressed his discontent with Brunei&#x27;s political system by frequently abstaining from State Council meetings, ostensibly opposing the Resident&#x27;s authority. Additionally, he appointed Inche Mohamad Hassan bin Kulop Mohamad from Selangor or Perak as his personal assistant, described by an Englishwoman as highly capable and fluent in English, thus enabling the Sultan to rely on him to carry out his wishes effectively. In October 1931, he undertook a three-week trip to Malaya, followed by an extended stay in Britain from July 1932 to August 1933, ostensibly to improve his English language skills. Ahmad Tajuddin was characterised as a tiny, bespectacled guy with long hair who drove in a luxurious Lincoln automobile and was carried in a gold and scarlet litter during formal rituals during a 1935 visit by Sir Shenton Thomas.

It wasn&#x27;t until he turned eighteen on 19 September 1931, that he attained full sovereignty. Ahmad Tajuddin traveled to Peninsular Malaya from 1 to 21 October 1931, and then, in July 1932, he became the first Sultan of Brunei to travel to England, where he spent around ten months, to observe the changes that had taken place there. He didn&#x27;t return to Brunei until August 1933, after a protracted visit. As an honorary aide-de-camp (ADC), Pengiran Mohammad bin Pengiran Abdul Rahman Piut accompanied him on both occasions. Pengiran Anak Besar Bagol, his brother, was then named ADC.

Ahmad Tajuddin was known for his hospitality and respect towards guests, including high-ranking visitors such as Rajah Charles Vyner Brooke, whom he hosted at his own residence, Istana Mahkota, in 1934. He treated his friends and peers with generosity and equality, often giving gifts and maintaining an informal demeanour during social events, though he would subtly distance himself from those who sought to take advantage of his kindness. Despite this, he and his family began to feel uneasy with the out distribution of Brunei&#x27;s wealth from oil exports and for that reason, he encouraged the British government to ease financial regulations for the people of Brunei. In an attempt to suppress the Sultan, his living allowance was raised from $1,000 to $1,500 in 1934, and again was again given an increase of $500 a month in 1938. The Government of the United Kingdom gifted him a car in 1939.

Following the royal conventions of both Brunei and Selangor, he married Tengku Raihani, the daughter of Sultan of Selangor, Alauddin Sulaiman Shah, in a ceremony performed in Istana Mahkota Puri, Klang, on 30 April 1934. Masjid Jami&#x27;ah Al-Rahmah in Klang hosted his &quot;akad nikah&quot; (marriage contract). He was escorted by his mother, brother, public officials, and a royal guard. He visited Klang once more in October, having returned to Brunei in July. Tengku Raihani accompanied him when he returned to Brunei in November 1934, and they were greeted with great fanfare. This marriage improved relations between the Bruneian and Selangor royal dynasties. She would later be crowned on 15 October 1935, and carried the name Tengku Ampuan Raihani.

Early in August 1935, 23-year-old Ahmad Tajuddin wore spectacles, was short in stature, and had unusually long hair, was spotted by Sir Shenton Thomas, the newly appointed Commissioner for the Malay States, on his visit to Brunei. Thomas spoke about the Sultan&#x27;s stately entry in a sumptuous red and gold litter pulled by thirty men, as well as the reception hall&#x27;s simple design that used cheap items like Brunei cigarettes and German carpets. He had to deal with his wife&#x27;s defying Bruneian conventions and perhaps dangerous journey to Klang for the birth of their child at a period of intense pressure from his brother-in-law, Tengku Kelana Jaya Petra. The British Resident of Selangor offered Thomas advice and assistance, but the Selangor family persisted, and on 15 October 1935, Ahmad Tajuddin and his party flew to Klang, where their daughter Princess (Tengku) Nor Ehsani was born.

By 1936, there had been several arguments between Ahmad Tajuddin and his Resident as their relationship was failing. Acting High Commissioner A. S. Small observed that as the Sultan became older and more self-assured, he became more and more problematic. After previous Resident Pretty was dispatched to Brunei to resolve these difficulties and defuse tensions, the Colonial Office decided to designate more senior officers as Residents going forward. He was greeted cordially by the people of Kuala Belait on his official visit there after attending the Sultan of Selangor&#x27;s golden jubilee in 1937. Later in August, once again he and his family went to Selangor to attend the golden jubilee celebration of Sultan Alauddin. On his return in December, he went for an official visit to Kuala Belait and to formally declare open a newly built Recreation Club. The visit was received with great joy by the people and the inhabitants there even people from the interior came to town to join in the celebration and to have a look at their Sultan.

The relationship between the Sultan and the British soured when John Graham Black was appointed as the British Resident in 1937. The resident attempted to postpone and sabotage his coronation ceremony and this infuriated the Sultan. This caused the resident to be replaced by Ernest Edgar Pengilley on 1 January 1940. Due to the frustration that Black had caused, he was not given a farewell ceremony by the Sultan as he usually did for other residents. Although the Sultan&#x27;s early behaviour had been difficult and necessitated strong warnings, Thomas wrote to MacDonald in early 1940 that he had demonstrated progress in the previous five years and had no vices. While recognizing the Sultan&#x27;s difficult childhood, Thomas also emphasised his commitment, which was exemplified in 1939 by a sizeable payment for Imperial defense. As a result, he suggested that Ahmad Tajuddin get a Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (KCMG) during his coronation, thereby making him the only Malay ruler who had not received an honor from the British Crown before. The Commissioner did not attend the coronation, but Robert Irvine, the private secretary, did give a report.

=== Coronation ===
Following the official transfer of power in 1931, his coronation ceremony took place nine years after his elevation to the throne. The event began by him reciting the Qur&#x27;an at the Istana Mahkota on 9 November 1939. On Monday, 26 February 1940, the ceremony was inaugurated in the Kajang-roofed Lapau (Ceremonial Hall) by raising flags and opening the &quot;gandang jaga-jaga&quot; ceremony, signaling the, signaling the beginning of the event forty days ahead of the actual coronation ceremony. Throughout the period, traditional drumming was heard, and royal decorations were positioned along the parade path. Prior to the coronation, a variety of events were planned, such as dances, martial arts, and regional performances.

The coronation of Ahmad Tajuddin began on 17 March 1940 at 3 p.m. in a spacious, specifically furnished chamber of the Government Office devoid of any furnishings. The yellow-painted throne from the ancient Lapau Council Chamber, complete with a dome and flags, was situated on an elevated platform at one end, accompanied by a yellow silk-covered cushioned chair. The public was standing behind, with European viewers sat on the left and prominent Asian visitors using seats on the right. A wide, railed-off path ran down the middle to prevent onlookers from intruding, and an elevated dais was placed next to the throne for government delegates.

The procession to the Coronation Hall was delayed, causing a delay in the crowning. On the verandah, delegates from Sarawak, Selangor, and British North Borneo had already gathered, and the two Wazirs had come with the Sultan&#x27;s Crown. After it was ultimately established that the Sultan had arrived at the Lapau, the litter procession started. A jubilant audience, drums, gongs, and trumpets accompanied the Sultan, who was being carried by twenty-four men in a wooden litter painted yellow. The litter, which had a canopy attached to it, was accompanied by a sizable group of chiefs, regalia bearers, and attendants, five of whom held enormous, vividly colored candles. Throughout the parade, the Sultan, wearing a costume of white velvet with golden trimmings, was bareheaded.

The Chief Police Officer of the 24 Brunei Police commanded the Guard of Honour that the litter carrying him was put in front of. The Sultan inspected the guard before going to the office verandah, where he was met by delegates. The Sultan took the throne as the procession entered the Coronation Hall. A elevated dais was used by the delegates, which included the British Resident. Chiefs, regalia bearers, and attendants arranged themselves around the throne. The Sultan&#x27;s right and left Wazir were &quot;Pengiran Bendahara&quot; Pengiran Anak Abdul Rahman and &quot;Pengiran Pemancha&quot; Pengiran Anak Haji Mohammad Yassin, respectively, were displayed on the platform next to the throne, with the ADC next to the &quot;Pemancha&quot;. Armored at each corner of the platform were bearers of regalia who carried a variety of ceremonial items, including as weapons and a brazen lion and arm. With a drawn sword resting on his own chest, an attendant knelt before the Sultan. The &quot;Pengiran Shahbandar&quot; and the principal chiefs faced the platform, which was surrounded by attendants and regalia bearers. Massive candlesticks were positioned at each corner of the platform and behind the throne. 

The Sultan was crowned by the &quot;Pengiran Bendahara&quot; wearing a newly fashioned yellow songkok embellished with white plume, diamonds, and gold. The &quot;Pengiran Bendahara&quot; received the crown from the Pengiran and gave it to the &quot;Pengiran Pemancha&quot;, who in turn gave it to the Sultan. The &quot;Pengiran Bendahara&quot; made a long declaration, clearly exhausted, and then there was a 21-gun salute as the &quot;nobat&quot; (royal band) played. &quot;Pengiran Bendahara&quot; offered &quot;sembah&quot; (tribute) and Malays surrounding the throne and in the hall waved their swords and spears, echoing the cry from those outside. There were next a few brief proclamations, each concluding with the &quot;nobat&quot; and cries of &quot;sembah&quot;. 

After the 21-gun salute, a delegate came down from the dais to address the Sultan, reading letters from the High Commissioner, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and King George VI in English. Assistant Resident E. C. G. Barrett translated all the messages into Malay, including the announcement of the Sultan&#x27;s designation as an Honorary Companion of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (CMG). The delegate then went back to his position on the dais after delivering the messages, which were written in Jawi, to the Sultan through his ADC. The Sultan received messages from delegates from British North Borneo, Sarawak, and Selangor. The Sultan stood in answer and read out responses to each. After then, the celebration came to a conclusion with a prayer delivered by Brunei&#x27;s Dato Imam. The Sultan then left the throne and entered the hall in a procession like the one that had begun the ritual. After being returned in a litter procession to the Lapau, he got into his car and drove back to the palace.

There were no problems managing the gathering of thousands of well-behaved onlookers who lined the road between the Lapau and the government offices. Several hundred Malay onlookers silently observed the proceedings inside the auditorium. The ritual stayed orderly despite some shoving as participants hurried for the return procession and several persons getting oil on their clothing from the enormous candles. Many onlookers hurried to gather as souvenirs bits of white fabric that were scattered along the procession path. Following that, the Sultan and his spouse sat on seats cushioned with yellow silk for the palace&#x27;s &quot;bersanding&quot; ceremony, which was attended by the invited guests. His wife, resplendent in a diamond-encrusted cream-coloured gown, stood motionless the entire time the Sultan&#x27;s eldest sister conducted the &quot;sembah semua&quot; ceremonial summons.

After the &quot;bersanding&quot; ceremony, Sultan and his spouse drove around the town in a motorcade, passing through rows of onlookers that included kampong dwellers sheltered under temporary structures. Under the protection of a big yellow umbrella, the couple traveled in an open automobile. Upon arriving back to the palace, tea was given to the guests. Due to custom, the Sultan had to stay in the palace for many days following his coronation, therefore he was unable to attend the State Banquet that evening. Exhausted from the day&#x27;s activities, the &quot;Pengiran Bendahara&quot; was also not present. There were remarks at the 150-person banquet wishing the Sultan and Brunei&#x27;s future well.

Ahmad Tajuddin threw a dinner reception at the Astana on the evening of 18 March for dignitaries and well-known citizens who came to witness his coronation. Following the meal, he and his spouse spoke to the guests from an elevated stage. The Sultan thanked the British Resident and government officials for the seamless arrangements and thanked the delegates for attending the coronation. A guest responded by thanking the Sultan for his kindness in a brief speech in Malay. The evening closed with numerous entertainments, including ronggeng, playing silat, and Dusun dance, which delighted the audience.

===Second World War===
He urged the British to accept Bruneians into higher positions of the Brunei Administrative Service (BAS) in order to train and give experiences to local population. For the first time ever in 1941, 25 locals were appointed to serve in the government bureaucracy. With the help of Syed Abdul Aziz Asimi, the school&#x27;s instructor, Ahmad Tajuddin opened a private Arabic school in Brunei Town in 1940 as a demonstration of his dedication to furthering Islamic education in Brunei. To promote its growth, the school was located in one of his palaces. Even though the school made great strides and its pupils had great success, it was shut down in 1942 when Brunei was occupied by the Japanese.With the likelihood of war with the Empire of Japan increasing, in 1941, the British began to encourage the establishment of local defence forces in Brunei, and neighbouring Sarawak and Borneo. Ahmad Tajuddin approved the establishment of the Brunei Volunteer Force and Special Police Force to assist the British in stopping the Japanese invasion of Brunei. An estimated 200 Bruneians initially volunteered, but by the time of the invasion few remained and no Allied troops were stationed in Brunei. The Sultan was appointed an Honorary Colonel of the force.

Ahmad Tajuddin&#x27;s involvement during the Japanese occupation of Brunei, which started after surrendering to the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s Kawaguchi Detachment on 22 December 1941, was mostly symbolic, much like the British approach of keeping local rulers in place but giving them little actual authority. The newly formed Miri province, which comprised sections of Sarawak and Brunei, was included under the Japanese administration, which reduced the Sultan&#x27;s power while preserving his status as a means of gaining support from the populace. During his visit to Brunei in early 1942, Toshinari Maeda, the Japanese military governor of Miri province, was based in Kuching. He was photographed with his top officers, the Sultan, his brother, and &quot;Pengiran Pemancha&quot; Pengiran Anak Haji Mohammad Yassin.

His function in Brunei during the Japanese occupation was mostly ceremonial; the real government was controlled by the Japanese provincial governor and Inche Ibrahim bin Mohammad Jahfar, the government secretary prior to the war. Despite serving mostly as a symbolic leader, the Sultan was able to bring Labuan, as well as the districts of Limbang, Lawas, and Trusan, back under the nominal authority of Brunei. His initiative, motivated by long-standing animosity over the loss of these regions, was probably evident in this action. Pengiran Muda Omar Ali highlighted the significance of these regions to the Sultanate by openly calling for their restoration once he was crowned Sultan. The Japanese strategy was to maintain the support of their people by allowing the Malay rulers of Malaya and Borneo to remain in position, while denying them any actual authority. He was kept on the throne, while the Wazir and Cheteria continued in their pre–war administrative roles, but doubtless under the command of Japanese military personnel.

During an early 1942 visit to Brunei, Maeda Yoshinori was pictured with his top officers, the Sultan, and Pengiran Anak Besar Bagol. The Japanese continued to recognise the Sultan as the head of the Islamic religion and the Royal Customs so long as he co-operated with them. He was advised by the Japanese to retire and offered a monthly pension together with medals of honour from the Emperor of Japan.Detachment on 22 December 1941, was mostly symbolic, much like the British approach of keeping local rulers in place but giving them little actual authority.

The Borneo Planning Unit of the Colonial Office drew up plans in June 1944 to force Brunei and Sarawak to sign new treaties that would have reduced Brunei to the status of a protectorate under British law, severely undermining the Sultan&#x27;s authority. Due to military control over the Borneo regions by the United States and then Australia, this plan was put on hold for a while. Negotiated with the Sultan following the battle, the pact sought to give the British complete sovereignty over Brunei. Pre-war Resident Pengilley, however, expected little opposition from the Sultan over the suggested modifications, characterising him as morally deficient and physically inconsequential.

By mid-1945, the Japanese were facing defeat and their forces in Brunei were becoming more violent in their actions toward the populace. Locals were threatened by food shortage during the occupation. A plan was made to save the Sultan and the royal family from the increasing Japanese war crimes. The Sultan and his closest relatives, together with loyal palace officials, were hidden by Haji Kassim bin Tamin, the village headman of Kampong Tentaya, Limbang, in the early months of 1945 due to the intensified Allied bombing of oil installations at Miri and Lutong, as well as the machine-gunning of the Istana Mahkota itself. During the Sultan&#x27;s absence, a large portion of the palace&#x27;s contents, including pieces of the royal regalia, were looted. According to a report by Australian physician M. C. Clarke, the Sultan was a colorfully dressed guy in his early thirties who used alcohol, gambling, and partying as ways to escape the trials of his profession. The Sultan&#x27;s manner remained pretty lighthearted despite the chaos, even striking up conversations with his guests regarding health.
Istana Tantaya had been built in Kampong Tantaya and the Sultan lived there for about three months until Brunei was liberated by the Australian Army. Ahmad Tajuddin was met with great warmth by the Australian 9th Division upon his return to Brunei Town on 17 June 1945. As soon as the Australian military commander arranged for him to be received with a Guard of Honour and brought to the British Army Headquarters at Bubungan Dua Belas for tea, he made speedy use of medical help for his asthma and was put back in the Istana Mahkota &quot;in protective custody.&quot; Despite suspicions of working with the Japanese, investigations proved he had committed no serious crimes, and the British government&#x27;s pre-war resident Pengilley attested to his allegiance to them prior to the Japanese takeover. Even so, until civilian government was reinstated in July 1946, the Sultan&#x27;s political power was constrained under the Australian-run British Borneo Civil Affairs Unit and the ensuing British Military Administration.

Following the liberation of Brunei Town by the Australian forces, his personal standard was raised. Until 6 July 1946, when civil government was reinstated, Brunei remained under the control of the Allied Forces. Pengiran Ahmad bin &quot;Pengiran Pemancha&quot; Pengiran Anak Haji Mohd Yassin, presently known as &quot;Pengiran Maharaja Anakda&quot;, succeeded his brother Pengiran Anak Besar Bagol, who had died during the occupation, in the role of &quot;Sanggamara&quot;.

After Allied bombs severely damaged the Istana Mahkota in early 1945, Ahmad Tajuddin, his spouse, and his family relocated to a small home in Brunei Town. After his demands for a new palace and reimbursement for war damages were turned down, he moved to Kuching in the middle of 1949. There, the Brunei flag was flown from his home, Istana Kechil, and royal pennants adorned his vehicle. The British rationale for defying his demands was centered on higher priorities for post-war reconstruction, namely government buildings and hospitals. Tensions over administrative unification and the nomination of Sarawak officials to posts in the Brunei government heightened when the Governor of Sarawak was named ex officio High Commissioner for Brunei in 1947, further subordinating the Sultanate to Sarawak&#x27;s authority.

=== MacDonald&#x27;s 1946 visit ===

On his first trip to Brunei in July 1946, MacDonald met Ahmad Tajuddin, whom he characterised as a weak, fragile man who liked ladies, drink, and the odd song. Tajuddin, who had ruled for 22 years at the age of 33, was viewed as the result of a shabby upbringing and excessive luxury, in part because his mother had supported his promiscuous lifestyle. Even as Sultan, he was seen as a degenerate since he had disregarded his education and his duties as a ruler in favour of inheriting a sizeable harem and indulging in its pleasures. A welcoming arch was built in Brunei Town upon MacDonald&#x27;s visit there in late 1946. It included the words &quot;Restorer of Peace and Justice&quot; under the Union Jack and the phrase &quot;Sole Right of the Sultan and His Subjects&quot; beneath the Brunei flag. The arch was meant to send a message to the British government that they had to respect the Sultan&#x27;s and his subjects&#x27; rights if they were to establish peace and security to Brunei. The previous slogan was to be removed, per British orders, but the Sultan stepped in to support the local teenagers and said he liked their &quot;national spirit&quot; for keeping both slogans.

When Ahmad Tajuddin first appeared in the Brunei River, his half-grown size, peculiar attire, and exaggerated facial characteristics gave him a rather humorous aspect. His outfit, which looked like it belonged in a musical comedy, consisted of a dark blue tunic with silver trimmings, black riding breeches, black top-boots, and a black peaked hat. It was also adorned with insignia and medals. Three girls made up his entourage; the youngest, from his official wife, had particularly untamed and ill-tempered eyes.

At four feet eight inches tall, he had the build of a tiny kid but the face of an adult, with a noticeable degeneracy and frailty. His jet-black hair, slicked back and split to show a shaved patch on his crown, contrasted sharply with his pale complexion. His huge full-lipped mouth contrasted with his delicate yet sensual nose and protruding eyes, which were enhanced by horn-rimmed glasses. His minimal facial hair, including a faint moustache and a few stray chin hairs, contributed to his overall picture of an impotent and somewhat pathetic figure. His garb was colourful yet out of place, a reflection of his quirkiness in creating oddball outfits. This time, he was decked up in a dark blue tunic with silver accents, obscene riding breeches-style pants, and a bus-driver-style black cap. He looked ludicrous and theatrical, more fitting for a musical play than royal regalia. His costume was finished with black patent leather top-boots, a silver belt, and several decorations (a pair of beribboned medals on his chest and the jewel of the CMG hung around his neck).

Secretary of State for the Colonies Arthur Creech Jones accepted MacDonald&#x27;s recommendation to maintain Brunei&#x27;s independence from the administrations of North Borneo and Sarawak, upholding pre-war arrangements until new constitutional changes were proposed, as the deadline of 1 July 1946, for restoring civilian government in Brunei drew near. Ahmad Tajuddin started to make more of an effort to establish himself during this time. He most famously protested against Rajah Charles Vyner Brooke&#x27;s intention to hand over Sarawak to the British Crown in February 1947, saying that Brunei should have been the recipient of any such cession. Resident William John Peel did not appear to endorse his remarks, and there was no sign that the Colonial Office was changing its position on the Sultan or that he was being invited to take part in talks in London. 

It was during his reign that saw Brunei have its own national anthem &quot;Allah Peliharakan Sultan&quot;, which is similar to &quot;God Save the King&quot; in England. In 1947, the national anthem was composed by Haji Besar bin Sagap and lyrics written by &quot;Pengiran Setia Negara&quot; Pengiran Haji Mohammad Yusuf bin Pengiran Haji Abdul Rahim That same year, he gave his approval to fly the red and white flag of the Youth Front, natively known as the (BARIP), on 12 April, the day of the political party&#x27;s first yearly anniversary of foundation. It conveyed to the British government that the Sultan was secretly endorsing the BARIP, an organisation that was allegedly disseminating revolutionary ideas in the vein of Indonesia. Later on 15 July, he bestowed the title &quot;Pengiran Bendahara Seri Maharaja Permaisuara&quot; on his brother, Pengiran Muda Omar Ali Saifuddien.

Due to the ever-rising tension between the Sultan and the British Resident, high commissioner&#x27;s secretary Pretty was sent to defuse the situation. In August 1948, Pretty was reappointed as a resident in an attempt to repair the relationship with the Malay states including Brunei. He recommended that the Sultan write a letter to the Secretary of State in hopes of the British government paying more attention to hardship and difficulties faced by Brunei. Pretty also made an effort to build the Sultan a new palace after the previous was destroyed in the war.

=== Silver Jubilee ===
The sickness of Ahmad Tajuddin cast a cloud over his scheduled 20 September 1949, Silver Jubilee. He was to be flown back to Brunei for the festivities on the eve of the event from Kuching, where he was residing. But when they arrived at Kuching, he was not there, and it was disclosed in an apologetic letter that he and the Tengku Raihani were not in the best of moods and were not eager to go. Although he had been leading a laid-back lifestyle in Kuching, he had lately taken to his bed, spending 10 days alone himself, refusing to work or receive guests, and avoiding communication with the outside world. 

When he willingly admitted himself into the hospital, his condition worsened and he became extremely agitated. Even though there were no such noises at the hospital, he complained about constant bell ringing there and about interruptions in the quiet at home. These hallucinations were the initial symptoms of delirium tremens, a disorder brought on by a large alcohol intake. The doctor looked inside the Sultan&#x27;s room and found 423 empty beer bottles. This indicated that he had been consuming an alarming average of 42 bottles each day for the previous ten days, which would account for his serious condition.Ahmad Tajuddin&#x27;s health had declined in the weeks before his Silver Jubilee, his kidneys failing after years of stress. The doctor informed him that he only had six to eighteen months to live, despite the fact that medical personnel were able to have him looking presentable for the occasion. He became disinterested in worldly affairs after learning of this prediction since he believed that they were pointless given his imminent death, including the Jubilee events. Rather, he decided to enjoy life&#x27;s little pleasures, drinking and partying, and ignoring the formalities of his rule. Despite this, he was pushed by his wife, who shunned public appearances, to attend his Silver Jubilee in Brunei despite his initial refusal, which he justified with a medical claim. Following a protracted struggle, he grudgingly consented to go, seeming weak and exhausted from illness when he arrived at the airstrip in Kuching. His physique was slender and his face was haggard, giving the sense that death was imminent. His look had significantly deteriorated.
The Sultan was only very reluctantly convinced to attend his own silver jubilee celebration in Brunei on 22 September 1949, by his Kuching friend Datu Bandar Abang Hj. Mustapha and Sarawak&#x27;s Chief Secretary R. Gordon Aikman. The fact that he had to use some of his allowance to cover the cost of the festivities also made him upset. However, upon his return to Brunei, he decided, or was persuaded, to remain in the nation, with the commencement of work on his new Istana no likely having a major influence.

After a night of rain, he boarded a plane, which quickly took off, and arrived at a furnished pavilion the next morning, when he was greeted by dignitaries who bent down respectfully. Distinguished guests wore colourful garments that stood in stark contrast to the colonial delegates&#x27; more somber outfits. He wore an emerald green silk and gold ensemble to the occasion. His crown was too tiny and had to be worn at a rakish slant, which partly overshadowed the grandeur of his look. The bright and intricate clothing of the other attendants, such as his wife, other senior officials, and prominent visitors, contrasted with the Sultan&#x27;s gown, contributing to the ceremony&#x27;s visual magnificence.


Ahmad Tajuddin, along with his four children and his mother, who was known to be a dark figure, attended a tea party in the Residency garden. Her mysterious smile and sharp eyes suggested a more menacing side, even with her delicate appearance and kind manner. The comparison between her apparent gentility and the darker stories around her fascinated the observer, who was cautious because of her suspected history. But everything went down without a hitch, and the onlooker wondered if the stories were just the mouthpieces of displeased courtiers. Speaking via an interpreter, he was animated at a tea party, thanking the British for their protection following the Japanese occupation. He was talkative and sometimes funny, but he didn&#x27;t seem all that into the tea; he didn&#x27;t finish his cup and seemed preoccupied. His demeanour conveyed a lack of interest or unease, maybe associated with his medical condition, as his mother and other female attendees watched the exchange with differing degrees of impartiality and interest.

After earlier suffering with his lack of interest in the tea, Ahmad Tajuddin seemed cheerful at an evening occasion, dressed in formal attire and wearing medals. Even though his expression was lighthearted and joyful, there was a hint of glassiness in his eyes, as though he was trying to make up for his earlier pain. Despite his regal attire, his exuberant and young manner created a striking contrast with the weight of his obligations, making one feel sorry for him because it seemed like he hadn&#x27;t prepared himself enough for the demands of his position. When he and two of his daughters attended the Jubilee, Brunei&#x27;s social norms changed dramatically because, before, it was unheard of for women to attend such occasions. However, not everyone embraced this shift; some, like the wife of &quot;Penghiran Bendahara&quot;, declined to go because of ingrained cultural customs. A gradual but imperfect relaxing of conventional gender roles in Brunei was symbolised by the Sultan&#x27;s old nurse and two other older ladies, who attended the event in defiance of established standards.

He and his spouse assumed their positions on recently constructed thrones for the formal celebration, which was accompanied by a boisterous Royal Orchestra and newly painted stage-like décor. The orchestra performed loudly and for a long time, as was customary, and eventually Ahmad Tajuddin, who detested both the music and the players, agreed to let them play. His obvious unease and dislike brought to light his own contempt for the ritualistic practices, which contrasted with the anticipated respect for the event. The Silver Jubilee conducted amidst typical pomp and ceremony, was tarnished by the Sultan&#x27;s severe unhappiness with the continual cacophony of the royal orchestra, which he found aggravating. He eventually issued an order to remove them from the schedule despite their significance to the ceremony, expressing his dissatisfaction with the requirements of the celebration.

King George VI gave him the Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE) at the event, which was facilitated by the British High Commissioner. The Commissioner General for South East Asia and officials from neighbouring nations attended the event, which consisted of a three-day celebration in Brunei Town and a parallel celebration in Kuala Belait. The event was celebrated with a Thanksgiving Ceremony at Brunei Town Mosque and the issuance of commemorative stamps and Jubilee Medals.

=== Later reign ===
While residing in Kuching in May 1950, Ahmad Tajuddin put his faith in MacBryan, who utilised his contact with the Sultan&#x27;s private secretary, Inche Hassan bin Kulap Mohamed, to rise to the position of Political Advisor to the Sultan. In London, MacBryan represented Brunei&#x27;s financial and constitutional rights after the country signed the 1905–1906 Supplementary Treaty with Britain. MacBryan drew inspiration for his own political strategies from Ahmad Tajuddin&#x27;s 1937 reform in Brunei. 

The Sultan was not happy with the British government&#x27;s unwillingness to return his palace, even if he did receive a salary raise and more oil royalties. MacBryan took advantage of the Sultan&#x27;s unhappiness and convinced him to get involved in politics. One of his plans was to travel to London in order to renegotiate Brunei&#x27;s constitutional arrangement and push for more royalties from British Malayan Petroleum. The Sultan was frustrated with the Treaties that limited his operations and conveyed his pain over the oilfield concessions in a letter to MacBryan dated 1 June 1950. He also stated his desire for financial resources to help his people.

By 1 June 1950, MacBryan and the Sultan were getting ready to leave Singapore for London in order to talk about Brunei&#x27;s constitutional relationship with the United Kingdom. The Sultan formally selected MacBryan as his Political Secretary and designated Princess Nor Ehsani as his heir, to be known as &quot;Puteri Besar&quot;, when they were staying at the Raffles Hotel. While his younger brother Pengiran Muda Omar Ali Saifuddien possessed the title of &quot;Pengiran Bendahara&quot;, not as heir apparent, the Sultan also questioned the validity of Brooke&#x27;s cession of Sarawak without his input and wanted $5,000 in tribute. He also expressed his displeasure with Brunei&#x27;s oilfield exploitation and gave MacBryan permission to bring up these concerns with the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

The four letters dated 1 June 1950, which were purportedly bearing the Sultan&#x27;s seal and were written in an elegant English, are nowhere to be found, casting doubt on MacBryan&#x27;s authority over Ahmad Tajuddin. Although it is impossible to rule out fabrication, the substance of the letters fits the Sultan&#x27;s known problems and worries, indicating that they could be a true reflection of his emotions. MacBryan skillfully handled the Sultan&#x27;s concerns and sought to establish himself as an important adviser by utilizing his courtly Malay abilities and familiarity with the British system. In addition to overseeing the Sultan&#x27;s finances, his goals included incorporating Muslims from southern Philippines and northern Borneo into Brunei&#x27;s post-war government. This latter goal probably alarmed the Colonial Office since it would affect Brunei&#x27;s oil output and sovereignty.

==Death and funeral==

When Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin made a stopover in Singapore en route to the United Kingdom to revise the 1906 Agreement on raising oil royalties, he fell ill and was admitted to the Singapore General Hospital on 3 June 1950. He arrived at the hospital and later passed away on the following day, from renal failure after suffering a haemorrhage he suffered at the Raffles Hotel on the night of 3 June, aged 36. Upon completion of his funeral, his body was laid in state at the foyer of the Grand Palace of Johore Bahru, to provide opportunities for national dignitaries, senior government officials and local community leaders from different ethnic and religious, to pay their respects to the late monarch and send their condolences to his wife. MacDonald brought a wreath and attended the funeral on 4 June 1950.

The late-Sultan&#x27;s wife, whose brother was Sultan Hisamuddin at the time, made a fruitless attempt to convince the Singaporean authorities that he should be buried in Klang Royal Mausoleum while his body was lying in state at the Sultan of Johore&#x27;s Istana Besar in neighbouring Johore Bahru. It was imperative to remind her that according to Bruneian custom, his successor could not be named until his subjects had seen his face before to his burial. Meanwhile, High Commissioner Malcolm MacDonald was writing Tengku Raihani a vague condolence message:

After the Sultan&#x27;s body was flown back to Labuan Airport on a Royal Air Force (RAF) Douglas C-47 Dakota aircraft and transported with full ceremony by royal barge to the Lapau in Brunei Town. Before the plane took off to Labuan, many dignitaries and ambassadors were present at the airport to pay their respects to the late Sultan. 

A. M. Grier, the official representative of the North Borneo administration, gave a thorough account of the following events. After arriving back in Jesselton on June 5, he discovered telegrams informing him that launches from Brunei carrying senior commanders and mourners were scheduled to arrive at midday in order to receive His Highness&#x27;s remains and retinue. I made the decision to attend the launching and send a signal from Brunei on the funeral arrangements because of the difficulties in communicating with Brunei and the date of the aircraft&#x27;s arrival. With Muslims adorning white bands around their songkoks and Europeans sporting black bands on their sleeves, the mourning launches arrived with much fanfare. Even though it was a somber event, there was a widespread sense of joy as mourners and many Labuan residents traveled to the airstrip in lorries and other forms of transportation to await the plane. 

The airport had made the right arrangements since the plane was on time and positioned next to the Guard of Honour. The State flag covered the coffin, which was mounted on an RAF vehicle with dignitaries sat next to it and exquisite wreaths from other dignitaries adorning the surroundings. Since leaving Labuan, the family gathering has grown to include the senior and younger brothers of Tengku Raihani. The family then temporarily retreated to the Rest House after the casket was moved to the M.L. &quot;Muara&quot; in front of a sizeable gathering at the dock. Inche Hassan, the Sultan&#x27;s secretary, made harsh remarks about some members of the Selangor Royal House and gave detailed information on the Sultan&#x27;s last sickness while also voicing worries about his own future in Brunei.

After the preparations in Labuan, the procession slowed down as it crossed the Brunei River in order to reach its destination by 5 p.m. The spectacle at the dock was visually arresting, with a decked barge, lots of &quot;perahu&quot;, and a sizeable crowd, all led by a Brunei Police Guard of Honour. Only the British Resident and Mrs. Pretty went with the family as the body of the late Sultan was ceremoniously taken ashore and transferred to the palace. Others chose to skip the official mourning rituals and instead watched as the Selangor royal family appraised the late Sultan&#x27;s priceless presents. During this time, two divisive topics emerged. Although Brunei&#x27;s records proved only male heirs could inherit the kingdom, it was thought that MacBryan prepared for a notice in the Straits Times announcing the Sultan&#x27;s intention for his legitimate daughter, Princess Nor Ehsani, to replace him. The Sultan had hired MacBryan as his private secretary in Singapore. Furthermore, the Wazirs picked the burial place despite the Tengku Raihani&#x27;s request to bury the Sultan on his estate close to Brunei Town. In the end, they concluded that the &quot;Pengiran Bendahara&quot; would prevail.

Tuesday, 6 June 1950, was the appointed time for the Sultan&#x27;s burial services. However, the casket and mourners arrived around 45 minutes later than expected. Additionally, Tengku Raihani, her brother, and daughter arrived at the dock without permission, so they missed the event. The casket was brought along a white cloth-covered road during the magnificent ceremony held at the Lapau. Following prayers, the &quot;Pengiran Bendahara&quot; was proclaimed the new Sultan, winning the support of the populace and greetings from surrounding countries. The burial site, Royal Mausoleum, which was situated on a hillside resembling a Chinese graveyard, was reached by a water procession carrying the coffin and a sizeable number of launches after the ceremony. However, the steep terrain made it difficult for mourners to get to the site, adding to the solemnity and heat of the hot day.

The casket was opened upon arrival to let the Sultan&#x27;s body touch the ground, despite the fact that it had been embalmed in Singapore. The procedure continued, and ultimately the coffin was lowered and the grave was filled even though the grave proved to be too tiny for it. Then the mourners filed back to the launchers in a haphazard fashion, like spectators fighting for position during a football game. By 9:30 p.m., the observer had returned to Labuan and was expressing gratitude for Resident Pretty and his wife&#x27;s handling of the issue and their great esteem for them. She was also commenting on the unusual combination of traditional ceremony and noisy crowd.

Shortly after, MacDonald was forced to get involved personally in the succession dispute in Brunei. Omar Ali Saifuddin III, the new Sultan, was proclaimed on 5 June 1950, with MacDonald&#x27;s full approval, as the late Sultan left no male heir. This decision was confirmed by a special State Council meeting attended by prominent Bruneian figures, including British Resident Eric Ernest Falk Pretty and High Commissioner Anthony Abell. Pengiran Muda Omar Ali Saifuddin became an apparent heir when he was appointed to the position of first Wazir since he became the most senior member of Brunei&#x27;s political system.

== Personal life ==

Throughout his life, Ahmad Tajuddin has a passion for sports. In addition to being a football player, he loved to ride horses. In addition, he was regarded as an artist who had a strong interest in literature. Printed by Mohd. Darwi of Mohamediah Press, &#x27;Guidance for Security&#x27; is a book that he left behind.

With authorities and members of his family present, Ahmad Tajuddin wed Tengku Raihani on 30 April 1934; their daughter, Princess Nor Ehsani, was born in Klang in 1935. As the eldest daughter of the couple, she was fully fledged and entitled to royal status, giving her precedence over her older half-sisters.

Ahmad Tajuddin had three daughters from his first marriage to Kadayang Amas (Maskaton) binti Ampuan Salleh, but no boys. His travels to Selangor, such as those made in 1937 for the Golden Jubilee of the Sultan of Selangor, served to further cement the alliance between the two royal houses. He had three eldest daughters, each carried the title of Belabub: Belabub Besar (Big Belabub), Belabub Tengah (Middle Belabub), and Belabub Damit (Small Belabub). The three daughters are;
* Pengiran Anak Datin Seri Setia Siti Saerah @ Balabub Besar, born in 1929, died on 4 November 2013.
* Pengiran Anak Datin Seri Setia Siti Zubaidah @ Balabub Tengah
* Pengiran Anak Datin Seri Setia Siti Halimah @ Balabub Damit, born in 1935, died on 4 January 2009.
Tengku Kelana Jaya Petra, the brother-in-law of the Sultan and a former Raja Muda of Selangor, put a lot of pressure on the Sultan at the time to have the heir born in Malaya, against Bruneian custom, put the mother at risk. She tried not to give in to the pressure, but the Selangor family&#x27;s might won out, and Princess Nor Ehsani was born at Klang towards the end of August 1935. He would also enrolled his kids at Brunei&#x27;s Catholic school.

<doc id="1204243" wikidata="Q3544234" url="?curid=1204243" title="USS Sea Robin">
<text>USS &quot;Sea Robin&quot; (SS-407), a , was a vessel of the United States Navy named for the sea robin. This is a spiny-finned fish with red or brown coloring on its body and fins. The first three rays of its pectoral fin separate from the others and are used in walking on the sea bottom.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Sea Robin&quot; was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, on 1 March 1944, launched on 25 May 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Homer Ambrose, wife of Captain Ambrose, the navy yard&#x27;s production superintendent, and commissioned on 7 August 1944.

== First patrol, November 1944 – January 1945 ==

After shakedown off Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and New London, Connecticut, &quot;Sea Robin&quot; transited the Panama Canal on 12 October 1944 following an incident with a Scandinavian merchant ship which, mistaking the submarine for a German U-boat, frantically scattered shells in the general direction of the surfaced &quot;enemy.&quot; Fortunately, &quot;Sea Robin&quot; was out of range and escaped without damage.

After spending six days at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Sea Robin&quot; sailed for the Luzon Strait and her first war patrol where, on 6 January 1945, she torpedoed and sank her initial victim of the war, the 5,000-ton Japanese tanker &quot;Tarakan Maru&quot;. Except for dodging floating mines, the remainder of the submarine&#x27;s first patrol was uneventful; and she returned to port at Fremantle, Western Australia, on 29 January 1945.

== Second patrol, February – April 1945 ==

&quot;Sea Robin&quot;″s second patrol proved to be her most productive of the war. On 3 March, while patrolling north of Surabaja in the Java Sea, the boat evaded a Japanese escort ship and torpedoed the cargo ship, &quot;Suiten Maru&quot; (2,500 tons). After several unsuccessful attempts to rescue survivors, the submarine finally hauled three prisoners of war on board and continued her patrol.

Two days later, &quot;Sea Robin&quot; contacted a troop-laden convoy of two cargo ships, a converted gunboat, and several escorts. The gunboat &quot;Manyo Maru&quot; (2,900 tons) was the first to be sent to the bottom, the victim of three torpedo hits. After evading the suddenly active escort vessels, the submarine commenced an end around and, several hours later, was again in firing position. &quot;Shoyu Maru&quot; (853 tons), the first of the two vessels, was zigzagging radically but was unable to avoid the three torpedoes that &quot;Sea Robin&quot; fired at her. She took one hit below her bridge and settled quickly by the bow. &quot;Sea Robin&quot; then fired a spread of three torpedoes at the remaining ship, but the target zigged and they missed. On the second attempt, the ship was not so fortunate. After watching the target completely reverse course, the submarine fired three more torpedoes at a range of with one hit amidships that broke netlayer &quot;Nagaru Maru&quot; (856 tons) in half and sent her rapidly to the bottom. &quot;Sea Robin&quot; now began to pay the price for her success. For 24 hours, she was pursued by the escorts and accompanying aircraft; but made good her escape and arrived at Subic Bay, Philippines, on 15 March to replenish her depleted torpedo store.

Departing Subic Bay on 19 March, Sea Robin set course for the South China Sea in the area of the island of Hainan where, on 23 March, she rescued a downed airman. On 30 March, the submarine found herself in the middle of a group of six Japanese destroyers. Midway between two of them, she launched three torpedoes at the first, but a quick turn of the ship caused them to pass harmlessly across the bow. The second destroyer swerved 90° and began to bear down on &quot;Sea Robin&quot;. After 20 minutes of depth charging, the submarine extricated herself and, with Hainan a scant away, again attacked, but a spread of six torpedoes failed to find a target, and the submarine resumed patrol.

On 8 April, &quot;Sea Robin&quot; sank two small Japanese fishing vessels, taking three prisoners of war and, on the following day, took on board 10 more Japanese, survivors of a foundering trawler that had been attacked by Allied aircraft. The submarine terminated her second patrol at Pearl Harbor on 29 April.

== Third patrol, June – August 1945 ==

&quot;Sea Robin&quot; departed Pearl Harbor 1 June on her third and final war patrol which was conducted in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea. She was in the East China Sea at , about southwest of Aogashima in the Nanpō Islands, on lifeguard duty in support of air raids on Japan by United States Army Air Forces B-29 Superfortress bombers on 26 June 1945 when a full load of bombs a B-29 had jettisoned through overcast landed in the sea only from her. She suffered no damage or casualties.

After sinking a small patrol craft on 9 July and taking one prisoner, &quot;Sea Robin&quot; torpedoed and sank the cargo ship, &quot;Sakishima Maru&quot;, on 10 July. Shortly thereafter, while attempting to sink a large sampan, the submarine was caught on the surface by a Japanese plane. Although the pilot did not drop his bombs on the first pass, thus giving &quot;Sea Robin&quot; a chance to dive, he dropped two close aboard on the second. Although it was not discovered until the end of the patrol, the submarine&#x27;s bow tubes were severely damaged causing numerous torpedo misses throughout the remainder of the patrol. With the exception of several trawlers sunk in surface attacks, the remainder of the patrol was unproductive.

When the war ended on 15 August, &quot;Sea Robin&quot; was moored at Midway Island. After a one-day stop at Pearl Harbor, the boat headed for home, transiting the Panama Canal on 20 September and arriving at Galveston, Texas, four days later.

== 1945 – 1951 ==

Peacetime assignment brought &quot;Sea Robin&quot; to Submarine Squadron 6 (SubRon 6) based at Balboa, Canal Zone. On 15 May 1947, the submarine commenced a -month simulated war patrol in which she circumnavigated the South American continent and became the first U.S. submarine to round Cape Horn. The year 1948 was spent in fleet training exercises in the Balboa and Key West areas.

Following overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, &quot;Sea Robin&quot; was reassigned to SubRon 8 based at Naval Submarine Base New London, arriving on 20 August 1949. On 23 February 1950, the submarine departed New London for participation in Exercise &quot;Portex,&quot; a joint Army-Navy-Air Force exercise in the Caribbean, returning on 23 March. From September through November, she was engaged in her first tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean.

== 1951 – 1955 ==

In 1951, &quot;Sea Robin&quot; was converted to a GUPPY IA submarine, following which she returned to New London for local operations. In January and February 1952, the submarine participated in Exercise &quot;Micowex&quot; in the North Atlantic testing cold weather gear and procedures under the supervision of the Naval Research Laboratory, New London, followed by a return to warmer waters and participation in Exercise &quot;Pacex&quot; in the Caribbean. For the next two years, &quot;Sea Robin&quot; was engaged in local fleet and training operations in the New London area.

On 30 August 1954, &quot;Sea Robin&quot; set sail for a six-week northern training cruise which stretched across the Arctic Circle and included stops at Glasgow, Scotland; and Belfast, Northern Ireland. On 4 January 1955, the submarine departed for six weeks in the Caribbean participating in operation &quot;Springboard&quot; and, in September, took part in NATO exercise &quot;New Broom IV,&quot; visiting Saint John, New Brunswick, en route home to New London, where she operated locally for the remainder of the year.

== 1956 – 1970 ==

After engaging in special operations in late 1956 and early 1957, &quot;Sea Robin&quot; resumed normal duties in the New London area until entering the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on 24 July 1957 for a two-month overhaul. Upon return to New London, she engaged in fleet exercises in the Atlantic and Caribbean until 28 March 1958 when she set sail for a -month tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. From Jan - May 1963 she again conducted a tour of duty in the Mediterranean. For the next five years, with time out for regularly scheduled overhaul periods, &quot;Sea Robin&quot; operated in Atlantic and Caribbean waters, engaging in fleet antisubmarine warfare exercises and providing services to the United States Naval Submarine School.

In September 1964, &quot;Sea Robin&quot; in the company of &quot;Piper&quot; participated in exercise &quot;Master Stroke&quot; with United States, Canadian, and British forces. During this exercise, they conducted port calls in Portsmouth, England and Rotterdam, Holland. &quot;Sea Robin&quot; returned to New London for local operations and entered Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in November for a scheduled overhaul, remaining there until April 1965. Following shakedown operations, &quot;Sea Robin&quot;, and departed New London in July for exercise with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean returning to New London in October. The year 1966 was spent in participation with operation &quot;Springboard&quot; forces in the Caribbean providing services to naval air squadrons and surface units followed by training and antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises in the New London area. A scheduled main battery replacement was performed at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard during the months of July and August.

&quot;Sea Robin&quot; participated in &quot;Operation Springboard&quot; in the early months of 1967, and resumed normal operations upon her return to New London. On 22 May 1967, &quot;Sea Robin&quot; put to sea in company with , , and &quot;Sea Owl&quot; for a two-month tour of northern European ports stopping at Portsmouth, England; Cherbourg, France; Derry, Northern Ireland; and various Scandinavian ports. From 2 October through 1 February 1968, &quot;Sea Robin&quot; underwent overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and upon completion resumed normal duties in the Atlantic and Caribbean. On 1 December 1969, the submarine was transferred to SubRon 2, also based at New London.

Highlights of 1970 were participation in operation &quot;Springboard&quot; in January and February and NATO exercise &quot;Steel Ring&quot; in April and May. On 4 August, the submarine made her 12,920th and final dive. On 1 October 1970, &quot;Sea Robin&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Navy list. She was sold for scrap on 3 June 1971 to the North American Smelting Co., Wilmington, Del.
