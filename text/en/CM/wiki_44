<text>The meridian system (, also called channel network) is a pseudoscientific concept from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that alleges meridians are paths through which the life-energy known as &quot;qi&quot; (&quot;ch&#x27;i&quot;) flows.

Meridians are not real anatomical structures: scientists have found no evidence that supports their existence. One historian of medicine in China says that the term is &quot;completely unsuitable and misguided, but nonetheless it has become a standard translation.&quot; Major proponents of their existence have not come to any consensus as to how they might work or be tested in a scientific context.

==History==

The concept of meridians are first attested in two works recovered from the Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan tombs of the Han-era Changsha Kingdom, the &quot;Cauterization Canon of the Eleven Foot and Arm Channels&quot; &quot;Zúbì Shíyī Mài Jiǔjīng&quot;) and the &quot;Cauterization Canon of the Eleven Yin and Yang Channels&quot; &quot;Yīnyáng Shíyī Mài Jiǔjīng&quot;). In the texts, the meridians are referenced as &quot;mài&quot; () rather than &quot;jīngmài&quot;.

== Main concepts ==
The meridian network is typically divided into two categories, the &quot;jingmai&quot; () or meridian channels and the &quot;luomai&quot; () or associated vessels (sometimes called &quot;collaterals&quot;). The jingmai contain the 12 tendinomuscular meridians, the 12 divergent meridians, the 12 principal meridians, the eight extraordinary vessels as well as the Huato channel, a set of bilateral points on the lower back whose discovery is attributed to the ancient physician Hua Tuo. The collaterals contain 15 major arteries that connect the 12 principal meridians in various ways, in addition to the interaction with their associated internal Zung Fu (臟腑) organs and other related internal structures. The collateral system also incorporates a branching expanse of capillary-like vessels which spread throughout the body, namely in the 12 cutaneous regions as well as emanating from each point on the principal meridians. If one counts the number of unique points on each meridian, the total comes to 361, which matches the number of days in a year, in the moon calendar system. Note that this method ignores the fact that the bulk of acupoints are bilateral, making the actual total 670.

There are about 400 acupuncture points (not counting bilateral points twice) most of which are situated along the major 20 pathways (i.e. 12 primary and eight extraordinary channels). However, by the second Century AD, 649 acupuncture points were recognized in China (reckoned by counting bilateral points twice). There are &quot;12 Principal Meridians&quot; where each meridian corresponds to either a hollow or solid organ; interacting with it and extending along a particular extremity (i.e. arm or leg). There are also &quot;Eight Extraordinary Channels&quot;, two of which have their own sets of points, and the remaining ones connecting points on other channels.

===12 standard meridians===
The 12 standard meridians, also called Principal Meridians, are divided into Yin and Yang groups. The Yin meridians of the arm are the Lung, Heart, and Pericardium. The Yang meridians of the arm are the Large Intestine, Small Intestine, and Triple Burner. The Yin Meridians of the leg are the Spleen, Kidney, and Liver. The Yang meridians of the leg are Stomach, Bladder, and Gall Bladder.

The table below gives a more systematic list of the 12 standard meridians:
===Eight extraordinary meridians===
The eight extraordinary meridians are of pivotal importance to the study of Traditional Chinese medicine that incorporates the modalities and practices of Qigong, Taijiquan and Chinese alchemy. These eight extra meridians differ from the standard twelve organ meridians in that they are considered to be storage vessels likened to oceans, fields, or reservoirs of energy that are not associated directly with the Zang Fu, i.e. internal organs but have a general influence upon them. Within Traditional Chinese medicine they are thought to bring about large functional and physiological changes within clinical practice. These channels were studied in the &quot;Spiritual Axis&quot; chapters 17, 21 and 62, the &quot;Classic of Difficulties&quot; chapters 27, 28 and 29 and the &quot;Study of the 8 Extraordinary vessels&quot; (Qi Jing Ba Mai Kao), written in 1578.

The eight extraordinary vessels are ():
# Conception Vessel (Ren Mai) – 
# Governing Vessel (Du Mai) – 
# Penetrating Vessel (Chong Mai) – 
# Girdle Vessel (Dai Mai) – 
# Yin Linking Vessel (Yin Wei Mai) – 
# Yang Linking Vessel (Yang Wei Mai) – 
# Yin Heel Vessel (Yin Qiao Mai) – 
# Yang Heel Vessel (Yang Qiao Mai) – 

== Scientific view of meridian theory ==
Scientists have found no evidence that supports their existence. The historian of medicine in China Paul U. Unschuld adds that there &quot;is no evidence of a concept of &#x27;energy&#x27; -- either in the strictly physical sense or even in the more colloquial sense -- anywhere in Chinese medical theory.&quot;

Some advocates of traditional Chinese medicine believe that meridians function as electrical conduits based on observations that the electrical impedance of a current through meridians is lower than other areas of the body. A 2008 review of studies found that the studies were of poor quality and could not support the claims.

Some proponents of the Primo Vascular System propose that the putative primo vessels, very thin (less than 30 μm wide) conduits found in many mammals, may be a factor explaining some of the suggested effects of the meridian system.

According to Steven Novella, neurologist involved in the Skeptical movement, &quot;there is no evidence that the meridians actually exist. At the risk of sounding redundant, they are as made up and fictional as the ether, phlogiston, Bigfoot, and unicorns.&quot;

The National Council Against Health Fraud concluded that &quot;[t]he meridians are imaginary; their locations do not relate to internal organs, and therefore do not relate to human anatomy.&quot;

<text>Saint Ceolfrid (or Ceolfrith, ; also Geoffrey, c. 642 – 716) was an Anglo-Saxon Christian abbot and saint. He is best known as the warden of Bede from the age of seven until his death in 716. He was the Abbot of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey, and a major contributor to the project to produce the Codex Amiatinus Bible. He died in Burgundy while en route to deliver a copy of the codex to Pope Gregory II in Rome.

== Early life ==
Not much is known about the earlier period of Ceolfrid&#x27;s life. His desire to join the monastic community was likely due to his own brother Cynefrid&#x27;s devotion to the traditions of Christian monasticism. Historians date Ceolfrid&#x27;s induction into monastic tradition around the date of Cynefrid&#x27;s death in 660. Ceolfrid is known to have a strong family connection to monastic tradition. In addition to his brother, his cousin Tunbert was the first Abbot of the Monastery of Hexham. His first four years in cloister took place at Gilling Abbey in what is now North Yorkshire, which was also attended by Cynefrid, prior to his departure to Ireland. Ceolfrid is described as having &quot;behaved of the greater devotion, giving his mind continually to reading, to labour, and monastic discipline&quot;. After these four years, Ceolfrid left Gilling as he &quot;sought a monastery of a stricter character&quot;. He soon took in with a band of men, led by Wilfrid, later canonized as Saint Wilfrid. These monks are identified by Boutflower as being the Benedictines of Ripon at a monastery under the same name. During this time, he came to refine his own understanding of proper monastic principles. At the age of 27, Ceolfrid was ordained as a priest, and began to acquaint himself to the utmost with the practices of monastic life.

Very little is revealed about the period between the end of his days at Ripon, and his appointment under Benedict Biscop, except that he spent some time in the institutions of Abbot Botolph, whom he describes as being filled with &quot;the grace of spirit&quot;. While having been revered as an inspiration for the way of divine living, Botolph also served to inspire a greater sense of humility within Ceolfrid.

== Relationship with Benedict Biscop ==

In c.672/3, Benedict Biscop received a land grant from King Ecgfrith of Northumbria for the explicit purpose of erecting a monastery. During the construction of his first monastery at Wearmouth, Biscop appointed Abbot Eosterwini (anglicized as &quot;Easterwine&quot;) as his primary Abbot and Coadjutor. The monastery took eight years to build. This institute had left Ecgfrith so enamoured that soon after the completion of the Wearmouth Monastery, he granted Biscop another segment of land for the construction of a second monastery, Jarrow, with the intention that the two should be administered as one.

It is during the construction of the Wearmouth Monastery that Benedict Biscop sought out Ceolfrid, who would become &quot;his most zealous assistant from the first foundation of the former monastery&quot;, as well as a close friend. It appears that Biscop&#x27;s invitation came at a most opportune time, for Ceolfrid had been contemplating the idea of leaving the post he held at the time. He had grown rather disenchanted with the power stratification within the institution (the name of which is unknown), and had had enough of the &quot;jealousies and very bitter persecutions of certain men of rank&quot;, and had been looking to return to his own monastery (assumed to be Ripon).

Upon the completion of the Jarrow Monastery, Ceolfrid became the Abbot of the St. Paul&#x27;s Church on the monasterial grounds. Conflicting reports state that the presence of Ceolfrid during Jarrow&#x27;s construction varied. Some papers state that Jarrow came into his hands after its completion, while another identified Ceolfrid as being paramount to the actual construction of the monastery; as the individual who directed the construction of the monastery itself.

The friendship between the two was fairly close. When Benedict sailed across the English channel to Rome for the last time, he chose only Ceolfrid to join him in his journey. This trip was to be the very trip that would lead to both Abbot&#x27;s immortalization in the works of Ceolfrid&#x27;s ward and later contemporary, The Venerable Bede. Ceolfrid also used the trip as an opportunity to explore his role in Biscop&#x27;s institution, feeling that Rome would be an opportune place to learn his position&#x27;s responsibilities. Twelve years later, upon the death of Abbot Eosterwini, Ceolfrid was appointed as the sole Abbot for both Monasteries of Wearmouth and Jarrow, an honour never heard of before. In 690, Benedict Biscop died, after being bedridden for a lengthy period of time, and Ceolfrid became the leading head of both monasteries, &quot;[whose] libraries of both monasteries, which Abbot Benedict had so actively begun, under his zealous care became doubled in extent&quot;.

== Relationship with Bede ==

Bede came into Ceolfrid&#x27;s care at the young age of seven, and became the pupil of the Abbot as well as friend. In his early years at the twin Monasteries of Wearmouth – Jarrow (686), the Plague had struck Northumbria, and ravaged most of the countryside, including the twin Monasteries. Ceolfrid and Bede appeared to have remained untouched by the epidemic, and took the duties of caring for the infected and dying monks of the monasteries with unyielding fervour. They further worked together in maintaining the regular sermons when fear had gripped the population. When the Plague finally passed over, master and pupil began to rebuild the monastic foundations and succeeded effectively. Bede remained in Jarrow for the majority of his life, never straying more than 70 miles from the monastery at any time. He was a loyal pupil until Ceolfrid&#x27;s death, and he died in Jarrow in 735.

== The Codex Amiatinus Project ==

The Codex Amiatinus is the oldest manuscript with a complete text of the Vulgate. The Codex Amiatinus is described as a brilliant display of the beauty that is Early British, Pre-Carolingian calligraphy. The composition of the Vulgate was part of the project to expand Wearmouth and Jarrow&#x27;s extensive library, and Ceolfrid ordered three copies of this Bible manuscript to be composed; one of which would be dedicated to the Pope Gregory II, while the other two copies were meant to stay in the respective churches of Wearmouth and Jarrow. There are no official records that state that the text made it to Rome. It is said that instead, it made its way into Florence, where it was presented by the Lombard Abbot Peter to the Abbazia di San Salvatore at Mount Amiata in Tuscany. It is believed that he changed the dedicatory note inscribed within the leaves as donated to the monastery. This occurred in the 9th century. The document remained at Mount Amiata until 1786, when it was relocated to the Laurentian Library in Florence. There is some dispute over what consisted of this Vulgate Codex. Over the past few hundred years, additional leaves that appear to be related to this text have been located in Britain, some having been used as book wrappings. These new discoveries have led scholars to question the total length of the codex, as there are still fragments missing from it today.

== Ceolfrid and the Picts ==

Sometime after 711, Nechtan mac Der-Ilei, King of the Picts, sought authoritative advice from Abbot Ceolfrid on the reform of paschal cycles with a view to harmonising the celebration of Easter within his kingdom. By 716 both the Picts and the Columban clergy of Iona had adopted the &quot;pascha catholica&quot;.

== Final days ==

Ceolfrid apparently knew that he was coming to the end of his life, and so he resigned his post and was succeeded by Hwaetberht. He then set sail for Rome with the intent of delivering the Codex Amiatinus Bible to Pope Gregory II. He made it as far as Langres in Burgundy, where he died on 29 September 716 and was buried.

<doc id="1208358" wikidata="Q314595" url="?curid=1208358" title="Eystein Magnusson">
<text>Eystein Magnusson (, ; – 29 August 1123), also called Eystein I, was King of Norway from 1103 to 1123 together with his half-brothers Sigurd the Crusader and Olaf Magnusson, although since Olaf died before adulthood, only Eystein and Sigurd were effective rulers of the country.

While Sigurd gained fame as the &quot;warrior king&quot; (although owed almost exclusively to his three-year crusade to the Holy Land), Eystein was in contrast portrayed in the sagas as the &quot;peace king&quot; who stayed home in Norway and improved the country. As Eystein never engaged in warfare, considerably less information is written and known about him than about his brother Sigurd, despite his twenty-year-long reign, just a few years short of Sigurd. Eystein nonetheless gained the affection of his people, and was highly regarded by the saga writers for his deeds. Eystein and Sigurd&#x27;s reign became the longest joint rule in Norwegian history.

Although the later saga literature narrates stereotypical accounts about the two kings, Eystein is known to have improved the infrastructure and raised buildings and churches, particularly across the coast in Western Norway and Trøndelag, from Bergen to the fishing centre of Lofoten in the north. Eystein&#x27;s activities were especially centered in Bergen, which became an important international trade hub for fish at the time, helped by his construction projects. His activities in Bergen included moving the royal seat to a more central location in the city and building a new royal palace, as well as constructing churches and the Munkeliv Abbey. Eystein died of illness in August 1123, and his brother Sigurd thereby became the sole Norwegian king.

==Background==
Eystein was born in 1088 or 1089 as the first son of the future king Magnus Barefoot, born to an otherwise unknown mother who is only recorded to have been of &quot;low birth&quot;. Upon the death of his father in 1103 during one of his campaigns in Ireland, Eystein became king with his two half-brothers Sigurd and Olaf. Sigurd was about a year younger than Eystein, while Olaf was more than ten years younger than him. Sigurd was the only son who had accompanied their father on his campaign in the West, but he returned to Norway after his father&#x27;s death.

Many accounts concerning Eystein in later sagas are characterized by literary motifs, and have little value as sources on his life. Snorri Sturluson, the Icelandic author of the early 13th century &quot;Heimskringla&quot; mastered this literary style particularly well, stylistically and psychologically. His stories includes a so-called &quot;mannjevning&quot; (literally &quot;comparison of men&quot;) between Eystein and Sigurd, in which the two boast about their skills and deeds in an attempt to outdo each other. In a similar fashion, Snorri also tells a story about how Eystein managed to cure the melancholy of a friend, by agreeing to regularly clear time to talk with him about what troubled him. On his physical appearance, Snorri wrote that Eystein &quot;was the handsomest man that could be seen. He had blue open eyes; his hair yellow and curling; his stature not tall, but of the middle size.&quot; More reliable information, particularly about Eystein&#x27;s building-projects, is offered in earlier sagas such as the work of Theodoric the Monk, a Norwegian chronicler who wrote in the late 12th century.

==Reign==
The co-rule between Eystein, Sigurd and Olaf entailed a shared kingship, and the kingdom itself was not divided into fixed borders. During the early years of their reign, Eystein is nonetheless said to have stayed mostly in Western Norway and Trøndelag, while Sigurd was in Viken. In practice, only Eystein and Sigurd ever ruled as kings, as Olaf was considerably younger and died when he was only seventeen years old, and virtually nothing is known about him beyond his name. One of the earliest acts by the kings was passing a &quot;retterbot&quot;, a special law ordained by the king, which among other things abolished various royal taxes that originated from the Danish rule of Sweyn Knutsson and Ælfgifu (under Cnut the Great) in the early 1030s. The kings became very popular because of this. According to some sources, the main motivation for abolishing the taxes was to gain the support of the population for Sigurd&#x27;s planned crusade.
In 1107 or 1108, after years of preparations, Sigurd sailed with a large fleet on a crusade to the Holy Land, the first European king ever to do so. Sigurd arrived back in Norway in 1111. Eystein, on the other hand, did not engage in any warfare, and considerably less information is thus written about him than about Sigurd, although Snorri notes that he &quot;had also effected much in the country that was useful while King Sigurd was on his journey.&quot; While Sigurd gained fame in posterity as the &quot;warrior king&quot;, although mainly because of his one-time crusade, Eystein was portrayed by the saga writers as the &quot;peace king&quot; who stayed at home and improved the country. Since Sigurd remained king for nineteen years after his crusade with little controversy, historian Claus Krag has considered that the domestic peace probably could be attributed equally to Sigurd. In order to contrast Eystein with Sigurd, Snorri tells a story that Eystein instead subdued Jämtland to the Norwegian crown peacefully through the use of gifts and diplomacy. Despite Snorri&#x27;s account, historical records indicate that Jämtland did not succumb to Norwegian rule until much later, during the reign of King Sverre in 1178. Eystein and Sigurd are, however, known to have claimed monopoly on the trade and taxation in Finnmarken.

Fish became an increasingly important commodity during Eystein&#x27;s reign, as more cod was fished in Northern Norway and the demand for stockfish soared in Europe. As the most suitable port, Bergen became the main trade hub for exporting stockfish, including trade connections with Grimsby in England, while it also served to import much needed goods such as grain and flour. To further the trade, Eystein had fishing booths and a church built in the fishing centre near present-day Kabelvåg in Lofoten in Northern Norway, and he sailed north to Lofoten and Trondenes himself in 1114. He also secured the route along the coast by constructing a port in Agdenes on the mouth of the Trondheimsfjord, as well as smaller beacons along the coast. Eystein&#x27;s port construction in Agdenes was compared by Theodoric the Monk to that of Augustus Caesar at Brundisium, an association readily reflected by Theodoric&#x27;s use of the Latinised name form &quot;Augustinus&quot; for Eystein. (Otherwise, Pope Callixtus II calls Eystein &quot;Aistano&quot; in a letter.) The existence of a now lost port in Agdenes dated to around Eystein&#x27;s reign has been supported by recent archaeological surveys in the area. Snorri also says that Eystein had several large dry-docks built in Nidaros, and that he had a large ship built which &quot;in size and shape&quot; resembled the great ship &quot;Ormen Lange&quot; once built by King Olaf Tryggvason. Eystein also improved the shelters in the mountain passes, notably at Hjerkinn in Dovre, to more comfortable houses with permanent supervision.

In Snorri&#x27;s &quot;mannjevning&quot; between Eystein and Sigurd, Eystein allegedly maintains that his own building-projects in Norway were &quot;more useful for the country,&quot; than &quot;you [Sigurd] killing bluemen for the devil in Serkland.&quot; Eystein was particularly active in Bergen, and his role in the development of the city was probably more important than that of King Olaf Kyrre, the founder of the city according to the sagas. He moved the royal seat in the city from Alrekstad to Holmen on the eastern shore of Vågen, in the city core, thereby rationalising the bureaucracy. At Holmen, he built a Church of the Apostles (probably a stave church) and a St. Nicholas Church, as well as a royal palace which according to Snorri Sturluson was the most imposing wooden building ever raised in Norway (although Theodoric the Monk who wrote earlier already noted it was &quot;now almost collapsed from excessive age&quot;). He also built a St. Michael&#x27;s Church and founded the Benedictine abbey Munkeliv Abbey at Nordnes, and the tithe to the church was introduced during the reign of Eystein and Sigurd.

Eystein died on 29 August 1123, not long after he was &quot;seized with an illness&quot; during a feast at Hustad in Fræna in Romsdalen. Snorri tells that his body thereafter was taken to Nidaros, and buried in the Nidaros Cathedral. According to Snorri, it was &quot;generally said that so many mourners never stood over any man&#x27;s grave in Norway as over King Eystein&#x27;s,&quot; at least since the death of Magnus the Good. The reign of Eystein and Sigurd was the longest joint rule in Norwegian history. Sigurd ruled alone after Eystein&#x27;s death, until Sigurd&#x27;s own death in 1130.

==Family==
Eystein married Ingebjørg Guttormsdatter, from a prominent noble family of Gudbrandsdalen. Their marriage was part of Eystein&#x27;s strategy of building alliances in Eastern Norway. They had a daughter, Maria, who became the mother of the future royal pretender Olaf Ugjæva by her marriage to the &quot;lendmann&quot; Gudbrand Skavhoggsson. Olaf was named king in 1165, during the Norwegian civil war era, but was subsequently defeated by Magnus Erlingsson and forced to flee the country.

==Legacy==
Opinions on Eystein have been strongly favourable. Theodoric the Monk wrote about Eystein that he &quot;was a paragon of honesty who governed himself no less than his subjects with moderation and wisdom. He was a king who loved peace, an assiduous manager of public affairs, and above all a fosterer of the Christian religion.&quot; Snorri Sturluson later wrote that Eystein &quot;was wise, intelligent, and acquainted with the laws and history. He had much knowledge of mankind, was quick in counsel, prudent in words, and very eloquent and very generous. He was very merry, yet modest; and was liked and beloved, indeed, by all the people.&quot; The view of Eystein as a peaceful and domestically active king has been supported by modern historians such as Claus Krag, although noting that the literary embellishments should be disregarded.

A stylized marble bust of Eystein, dated to before the middle of the 12th century, was found during excavations at Munkeliv Abbey in 1853, and it represents the oldest known preserved portrait of a Norwegian king. The bust has the inscription &quot;EYSTEIN REX&quot;, and was originally probably part of a full figure statue built into the wall. The headpiece worn on the bust has been said to resemble a German Imperial crown, or to be of a Byzantine type. According to Snorri Sturluson, Eystein had &quot;somewhat large eyes&quot;, which seems to correspond with the bust. Since Snorri may have seen the bust in Bergen himself, it is unclear if his account represents an independent source on Eystein&#x27;s physical appearance. Today, the bust is located in the collections of Bergen Museum.

To commemorate his status as founder of the fishing village of Kabelvåg (although it had been an important centre for at least a century), a huge statue of Eystein (&quot;Øysteinstatuen&quot;) by Arthur Gustavson was raised at Breidablikk in Vågan Municipality in 1935, after an idea of architect Harald Sund. At Hjerkinn in Dovre, a church dedicated to Eystein (&quot;Eysteinskyrkja&quot;) was constructed in 1969 according to a design by Magnus Poulsson, in commemoration of Eystein&#x27;s construction of a &quot;sælehus&quot; or shelter near the village.

<text>Major Robert Edward Cruickshank VC (17 June 1888 – 30 August 1961) was a Canadian-born British recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for combat gallantry of the British and Commonwealth forces.

Cruickshank was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1888, the first of 5 children. He moved to England with his family when he was 3 where he moved frequently.

In the First World War he initially volunteered for the Royal Flying Corps, but transferred to the London Scottish. After being injured in the Battle of the Somme he was returned home to recuperate before transferring to Egypt. While in Egypt, on 1 May 1918, he volunteered to carry a message along the front line where he was hit several times by a sniper. For his continued attempts at climbing the slopes of a wadi whilst wounded and under sniper fire, he was awarded the Victoria Cross. After the war he returned to business work before moving to Southend. After serving in the Home Guard as a Major in the Second World War, he served on several local organisations and committees before dying in Leicestershire in 1961. His medal was donated to his regimental museum.

==Early life==

Cruickshank was born in Winnipeg in 1888, the first born of 5 children. His two brothers and two sisters were born in England. His youngest brother, John, died at the age of 10 in 1913, tripping as he alighted from a moving tram and fracturing his skull. He had been out shopping with a friend to buy a Scout&#x27;s cape. His middle brother, Percy, also volunteered for the Army, and was killed while serving in the Royal Fusiliers on the Western Front in 1917, aged 19. He is buried in France.

Cruickshank moved to England at the age of 3; his father also called Robert originated from Aberdeen. His father had apparently been working with the Canadian Pacific Railway as an accountant. After the family arrived in England they initially lived in Islington according to the 1891 Census but by the 1901 Census had moved to Woodford. From 1903 to 1904 he was educated at Bancroft&#x27;s School, Woodford, Essex. After leaving school, he worked as a travelling salesman, joining first Lipton, then the Lever Company. He was very interested in military matters and joined The City of London Yeomanry (Rough Riders), a volunteer unit 1908–1911.

At some stage his family moved to Harringay, North London, and he became involved in the Scouting movement shortly after it was established. He became an Assistant Scoutmaster in the 53rd North London Troop. He was also involved in local politics and was noted as a good speaker. He supported Percy Alden MP in several election campaigns.

==First World War==

After war was declared, he initially volunteered for the Royal Flying Corps, but transferred to the London Scottish. After training he was initially posted to the 1st Battalion in France, where he was wounded at the Battle of the Somme in September 1916 at Leuze Wood.

He was evacuated to England, but after recovering, he was posted to the 2nd Battalion and joined them first in Salonika prior to it embarking to Egypt.

===Victoria Cross===

He was 29 years old, and a Private in the 2/14th (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (London Scottish), British Army when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 1 May 1918 east of the Jordan River, Palestine, in the midst of a pitched battle against Turkish troops, Private Cruickshank volunteered to take a message to company headquarters from his platoon which was in the bottom of a wadi, with its officer and most of the men casualties. The official War Office citation gave the following account:

The platoon to which Private Cruickshank belonged came under very heavy rifle and machine-gun fire at short range and was led down a steep bank into a wadi, most of the men being hit before they reached the bottom. Immediately after reaching the bottom of the wadi the officer in command was shot dead, and the sergeant who then took over command sent a runner back to Company Headquarters asking for support, but was mortally wounded almost immediately after; the corporal having in the meantime been killed, the only remaining N.C.O. (a lance-corporal), believing the first messenger to have been killed, called for a volunteer to take a second message back. Private Cruickshank immediately responded and rushed up the slope, but was hit and rolled back into the wadi bottom. He again rose and rushed up the slope, but, being again wounded, rolled back into the wadi. After his wounds had been dressed he rushed a third time up the slope and again fell badly wounded. Being now unable to stand he rolled himself back amid a hail of bullets. His wounds were now of such a nature as to preclude him making any further attempt and he lay all day in a dangerous position, being sniped at and again wounded here he lay. he displayed the utmost valour and endurance, and was cheerful and uncomplaining throughout.

Citation for Private Robert Edward Cruickshank, Lond. R. (Harringay)

Following the action he was evacuated back to England where he recovered from his wounds, and was feted as a hero. He received his VC at Buckingham Palace on 24 October 1918, his mother and fiancée attending.

==Post-war period==

Following the First World War he married Gwendoline Mansell and at some time moved to Southend. He had rejoined Lever Brothers, and worked for them for the next 34 years, involved with the sales of margarine. In 1921 he was one of two Lever Brothers ex-servicemen employees who won a ballot to unveil the Port Sunlight War Memorial. In Southend and elsewhere in Essex he became very involved with the British Legion, serving on several committees and acted as Chairman. In the mid-1930s work took him and Gwendoline to Glen Parva, Leicester, where they settled for the remainder of their lives.

During the Second World, Cruickshank volunteered for the Home Guard and he achieved the rank of major.

Following the war, he then served for many years on various local organisations, particularly the Glen Parva Parish Council where he served as their Chairman for 14 years, retiring only shortly before his death. He was also an active attendee at Regimental reunions, and kept close ties with former comrades. Cruickshank died on 30 August 1961. He was cremated and his ashes were interred at Glen Parva Parish Church, and his name inscribed in the Book of Remembrance. His wife, Gwendoline, survived until the age of 103. They had no children. On 29 April 2018, a plaque was unveiled in his honour at Glen Parva Memorial Gardens to commemorate the centenary of his being awarded the VC.

==Freemasonry==

He was Initiated into Freemasonry in St Vedast Lodge, No.4033, (London, England) on 23 September; Passed, 22 October 1925 and Raised on 26 January 1926.

==Legacy==

On his death, his wife presented his VC to the London Scottish, where it is now held in the Regimental Museum, 95 Horseferry Road, London. In 2006, the 150th Anniversary of the Victoria Cross, Bancroft&#x27;s School, unveiled plaques to both his memory and that of Lieutenant Colonel Newman VC

==Recognition==

In November 2013, Premier Greg Selinger of Manitoba, Canada announced that a lake in Manitoba was renamed Cruickshank Lake] in his honour.

<text>The Main Street Bridge, officially the John T. Alsop Jr. Bridge and nicknamed the Blue Bridge, is a bridge crossing the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, Florida. It was the second bridge built across the river. It carries four lanes of traffic, and is signed as US 1/US 90 (SR 5/SR 10). A lift bridge, it opened in July 1941 at a cost of $1.5 million. In 1957 it was named after Mayor John T. Alsop Jr., but continues to be known, even on road signs, as the Main Street Bridge. It remains one of the most recognizable features of the Downtown Jacksonville skyline.

==History==
Construction of the Main Street Bridge began in 1938 at a cost of $1.5 million by the Mount Vernon Bridge Company. It was permitted by the War Department in 1936 prior to World War II. The Main Street Bridge took three years to be built and had a dedication ceremony on July 17, 1941. The bridge was built as a vertical lift bridge with use of trusses in order to lift up to accommodate ships passing underneath it. The official name of the bridge, John T. Alsop Jr. Bridge, was dedicated in 1957 to former mayor of Jacksonville John T. Alsop. The bridge carries traffic to and from San Marco, Southbank, Downtown Jacksonville and Interstate 95. In 2014 the Main Street Bridge underwent an $11 million renovation to upgrade metal barriers and patch sidewalks.
With other nearby bridges having been rebuilt as fixed spans by around the end of the 20th century, the Main Street Bridge is now the only remaining moveable bridge carrying automobile traffic across the St. Johns River in the Jacksonville area. Of the eight vehicle crossings in the region, four (Shands, Fuller Warren, Acosta and Main St.) had included movable spans when they initially opened.

==Gallery==
The bridge opens on demand except during restricted hours. Restricted hours are 7-8:30am and 4-6:30pm.

<doc id="1208375" wikidata="Q2004945" url="?curid=1208375" title="Tara Street railway station">
<text>Tara Street () is a railway station in central Dublin, Ireland. It is adjacent to the Loopline Bridge on George&#x27;s Quay.

It mainly services DART trains and longer distance commuter trains.
Commuter services operate to (1) Maynooth and the western suburbs, (2) Balbriggan, Drogheda and Dundalk on the former GNR(I) main line, (3) Gorey and Rosslare Europort and (4) Hazelhatch, Celbridge and Newbridge, through the Phoenix Park Tunnel.

==Description==
The station has two through platforms above street level with ticket areas and a retail outlet at street level. The platform retaining walls, the stairwells and canopies were originally timber planking but upgraded to include escalators and fibreglass panels in the 1970s and 1980s.

More recent changes have seen new stairwells installed and platforms lengthened to reflect the increasing throughput.
There are proposals to build in the airspace above the station and adjacent property has been acquired for this purpose.

==History==

The station opened on 1 May 1891.

It is on the &#x27;Loop Line&#x27; which was constructed towards the end of the 19th century by the City of Dublin Junction Railway, connecting the Dublin &amp; Kingstown terminus at Westland Row (now Pearse Station) and Amiens St (now Connolly Station) on the Great Northern Railway (Ireland), and linked into the Midland Great Western freight line, thus joining up all the main railways in Dublin.

===City centre resignalling===
The completion of the Irish Rail City Centre re-signalling project has seen an:

* Increase in the number of Northern and Maynooth line suburban trains stopping at Tara street. 
* Trains from Newbridge also serving Tara Street station.

This has been made possible by increasing the ability of the signalling system in the city centre to operate 20 trains per hour in both directions instead of 8.

The project began in March 2015 and was commissioned on 17 July 2016.

===Redevelopment===
In March 2015, the CIÉ group placed a tender to find a new property development partner for development at Tara Street. The resulting partner, Tanat Ltd, was formed in July 2015 and a resulting plan proposed a €130-million development for an office block of 22 levels. In May 2017, Irish property developer Johnny Ronan announced that he would submit plans to Dublin City Council an tower which proposed office space, a hotel, bar, and restaurant. The plan was rejected by Dublin City Council in July 2017, a decision upheld by An Bord Pleanála in March 2018.

In April 2019, An Bord Pleanála approved the plans for a 22-storey tower. Site clearance began in July 2019 but, as of 2024, construction still had not started.

==Proposals==
In March 2018, the National Transport Authority (Ireland) (NTA) and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) announced the Metrolink underground Metro project preferred routing and stations. This plan proposed an underground metro station underneath Tara Street railway station.

<text>Grete Hermann (2 March 1901 – 15 April 1984) was a German mathematician and philosopher noted for her work in mathematics, physics, philosophy and education. She is noted for her early philosophical work on the foundations of quantum mechanics, and is now known most of all for an early, but long-ignored critique of the no hidden variables proof by John von Neumann.

== Mathematics ==
Hermann studied mathematics at Göttingen under Emmy Noether and Edmund Landau, where she achieved her PhD in 1926. Her doctoral thesis, &quot;The Question of Finitely Many Steps in Polynomial Ideal Theory&quot; (), published in &quot;Mathematische Annalen&quot;, is the foundational paper for modern computer algebra. It first established the existence of algorithms (including complexity bounds) for many of the basic problems of abstract algebra, such as ideal membership for polynomial rings. Hermann&#x27;s algorithm for primary decomposition is still in contemporary use.

== Assistant to Leonard Nelson ==
From 1925 to 1927, Hermann worked as assistant for Leonard Nelson. Together with Minna Specht, she posthumously published Nelson&#x27;s work &quot;System der philosophischen Ethik und Pädagogik&quot;, while continuing her own research.

== Quantum mechanics ==
As a philosopher, Hermann had a particular interest in the foundations of physics. In 1934, she went to Leipzig &quot;for the express purpose of reconciling a neo-Kantian conception of causality with the new quantum mechanics&quot;. In Leipzig, many exchanges of thoughts took place among Hermann, Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, and Werner Heisenberg. The contents of her work in this time, including a focus on a distinction of predictability and causality, are known from three of her own publications, and from later description of their discussions by von Weizsäcker, and the discussion of Hermann&#x27;s work in chapter ten of Heisenberg&#x27;s &quot;Physics and Beyond&quot;. From Denmark, she published her work &quot;The foundations of quantum mechanics in the philosophy of nature&quot; (). This work has been referred to as &quot;one of the earliest and best philosophical treatments of the new quantum mechanics&quot;. In this work, she concludes:

In June 1936, Hermann was awarded the Richard Avenarius prize together with Eduard May and Th. Vogel.

=== Hidden variables ===
Based on her views on quantum causality, Hermann concluded that there was no way to explain quantum mechanics in terms of a hidden variable theory. However, she published a critique of John von Neumann&#x27;s 1932 proof from his book &quot;Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics&quot;, that was widely claimed to show that such a theory was impossible. Hermann&#x27;s work on this subject went unnoticed by the physics community until it was independently discovered and published by John Stewart Bell in 1966, and her earlier discovery was pointed out by Max Jammer in 1974. Some have posited that had her critique not remained nearly unknown for decades, her ideas would have put in question the unequivocal acceptance of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, by providing a credible basis for the further development of nonlocal hidden variable theories, which would have changed the historical development of quantum mechanics.

== Political activism ==
As Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, Hermann participated in the underground movement against the Nazis. She was a member of the Internationaler Sozialistischer Kampfbund (ISK).

== Emigration and later years ==
By 1936, Hermann left Germany for Denmark and later France and England. In London, in order to avoid standing out on account of her German provenance, she married a man called Edward Henry early in 1938. Her prescience was justified by events: two years later the British government invoked its hitherto obscure 1939 Defence Regulation 18B, identifying several thousand refugees who had fled Germany for reasons of politics or race as enemy aliens and placing them in internment camps.

After World War II ended in 1945, she was able to combine her interests in physics and mathematics with political philosophy. She rejoined the Social Democratic Party (SPD) on returning in 1946 to what would become, in 1949, the German Federal Republic (West Germany). Starting in 1947 she was one of those contributing behind the scenes to the Bad Godesberg Programme, prepared under the leadership of her longstanding ISK comrade Willi Eichler, and issued in 1959, which provided a detailed modernising platform that carried the party into government in the 1960s.

She was nominated professor for philosophy and physics at the and played a relevant role in the Education and Science Workers&#x27; Union. From 1961 to 1978, she presided over the , an organisation founded by Nelson in 1922, oriented towards education, social justice, responsible political action and its philosophical basis.

<doc id="1208380" wikidata="Q1515477" url="?curid=1208380" title="Valknut">
<text>The valknut is a symbol consisting of three interlocked triangles. It appears on a variety of objects from the archaeological record of the ancient Germanic peoples. The term &quot;valknut&quot; is a modern development; it is not known what term or terms were used to refer to the symbol historically.

Scholars have proposed a variety of explanations for the symbol, sometimes associating it with the god Odin, and it has been compared to the three-horned symbol found on the 9th-century Snoldelev Stone, to which it may be related.

==Archaeological record==
The valknut appears on a wide variety of objects found in areas inhabited by the Germanic peoples. The symbol is prominently featured on the Nene River Ring, an Anglo-Saxon gold finger ring dated to around the 8th to 9th centuries. A wooden bed in the Viking Age Oseberg Ship buried near Tønsberg, Norway, features a carving of the symbol on an ornately stylized bedpost and the Oseberg tapestry fragments, a partially preserved tapestry found within the ship burial, also features the symbol. 

Additionally, the valknut appears prominently on two picture stones from Gotland, Sweden: the Stora Hammars I stone and the Tängelgårda stone.

The historically attested instances of the symbol appear in two traditional, topologically distinct forms. The symbol appears in unicursal form, topologically a trefoil knot also seen in the triquetra. This unicursal form is found, for example, on the Tängelgårda stone. The symbol also appears in tricursal form, consisting of three linked triangles, topologically equivalent to the Borromean rings. This tricursal form can be seen on one of the Stora Hammars stones, as well as upon the Nene River Ring, and on the Oseberg ship bed post. Although other forms are topologically possible, these are the only attested forms found so far.

In Norwegian Bokmål, the term &quot;valknute&quot; is used for a polygon with a loop on each of its corners. In the English language, the looped, four-cornered symbol is called Saint John&#x27;s Arms.

==Theories and interpretations==
Several explanations for the symbol have been proposed:

===Hrungnir&#x27;s heart===
Chapter 17 of the 13th century &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; contains the following description of the heart of the jötunn Hrungnir: &quot;Hrungnir had a heart that was famous. It was made of hard stone with three sharp-pointed corners just like the carved symbol &quot;hrungnishjarta&quot; [Hrungnir&#x27;s heart].&quot; Comparisons have been made between this symbol description and the symbol known as the valknut.

===Odin and mental binds===

Hilda Ellis Davidson theorizes a connection between the valknut, the god Odin, and &quot;mental binds&quot;:

For instance, beside the figure of Odin on his horse shown on several memorial stones there is a kind of knot depicted, called the &quot;valknut&quot;, related to the triskele. This is thought to symbolize the power of the god to bind and unbind, mentioned in the poems and elsewhere. Odin had the power to lay bonds upon the mind, so that men became helpless in battle, and he could also loosen the tensions of fear and strain by his gifts of battle-madness, intoxication, and inspiration.

Davidson says that similar symbols are found beside figures of wolves and ravens on &quot;certain cremation urns&quot; from Anglo-Saxon cemeteries in East Anglia.

===Other===
Because the symbol appears on picture stones with Odin and on burial gifts in the Oseberg ship burial, Rudolf Simek says that the symbol may have been associated with religious practices surrounding death.

==Topology==
The valknut is topologically equivalent to either the Borromean rings, the trefoil knot, or (in modern use only) a closed three-link chain, depending on the particular artistic depiction:

==Modern popular culture==
The symbol is used for a variety of purposes in modern popular culture. The valknut symbol is used as a religious symbol by some adherents of Heathenry, a new religious movement inspired by historic Germanic paganism.

In Europe, the Swedish forest products company Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget uses a triquetra valknut as their logo, which can be commonly seen on many products produced by the company; the DFB has used a logo inspired by the unicursal form of the valknut for the Germany national football team since 1991.

The symbol appears as the fretboard inlay on some of Arch Enemy/Carcass guitarist Michael Amott&#x27;s signature Dean Guitars &quot;Tyrant&quot; models, and it is also used as a logo by American engineering firm RedViking. In &quot;Civilization VI&quot;, the valknut is the national symbol of Norway, which in the game is led by Harald Hardrada and mostly representative of Vikings rather than the modern country.

The valknut has seen some use by White supremacists. The Anti-Defamation League notes that &quot;nonracist pagans may also use this symbol, so one should carefully examine it in context rather than assume that a particular use of the symbol is racist.&quot;

Bogd Bank of Mongolia uses the same symbol as their main corporate logo.

In modern Norway, the word &quot;valknut&quot; means &quot;knot of those fallen in battle&quot;, connecting the symbol to the god Odin and representing the glory of death in battle.

<doc id="1208382" wikidata="Q3115672" url="?curid=1208382" title="Fat over lean">
<text>Fat over lean refers to the principle in oil painting of applying paint with a higher oil to pigment ratio (&#x27;fat&#x27;) over paint with a lower oil to pigment ratio (&#x27;lean&#x27;) to ensure a stable paint film, since it is believed that the paint with the higher oil content remains more flexible.

Oil paint dries at different rates due to the differing drying properties of the constituent pigment. However, everything else being equal, the higher the oil to pigment ratio, the longer the oil binder will take to oxidize, and the more flexible the paint film will be. Conversely, the lower the oil content, the faster the paint dries, and the more brittle it will be. Ignoring this practice, even in some &quot;alla prima&quot; painting, may result in a cracked and less durable paint film.

It has been claimed by some paint manufacturers that the &#x27;fat-over-lean&#x27; principle can be circumvented by using synthetic, alkyd-based painting media such as Galkyd and Liquin. These media do provide consistent drying times, increase the paint film flexibility, and promote adhesion between paint layers. However, because classical painting media, turpentine, natural resins, and certain plant oils (linseed, walnut and poppy) have lasted for centuries when applied properly, some artists choose to avoid synthetic media since their long-term stability is unknown.

<text>Dame Marie Rambert DBE (born Cyvia Rambam; 20 February 188812 June 1982) was a Polish-born English dancer and pedagogue who exerted great influence on British ballet, both as a dancer and teacher.

==Early years and background==
Born to a liberal Lithuanian Jewish family in Warsaw, Congress Poland, she was originally named Cyvia (Cesia) Rambam. Her father and two of his brothers later changed their last names to make them seem only children in order to escape military service in the Imperial Russian Army; and so, while one brother retained the name Rambam, her father changed his to Ramberg, another of his brothers went to Rambert, and the last changed his name to Warszawski. She changed her name to Myriam Ramberg, and finally left it in the French form &quot;Marie Rambert&quot;. In later years she was known to friends and dancers as Mim.

Her father, Yakov Ramberg (1855–1928), born in Vištytis, a small town in Suwałki Governorate (nowadays in Lithuania), was a learned merchant and Hebrew publisher and lexicographer, and a Zionist. Her mother, Eiga Ramberg (née Lap), born in the town of Suchowola (nowadays in north-east Poland), daughter of Rabbi Elhanan Tzvi Lap, was a community worker.

Rambert was the fourth of seven children. The eldest child, Rakhel, was the wife of Hebrew writer Micha Josef Berdyczewski. The second, Ewa Ramberg-Figulla, was a Slavist, the wife of German Hittitologist Hugo Heinrich Figulla and mother of physicist Johannes Figulla (father-in-law of German writer Christoph Hein and grandfather of German writer Jakob Hein).

Rambert met her husband Ashley Dukes, a soldier on leave, at a dinner party in 1917. In Rambert&#x27;s autobiography she says &quot;after four days of personal meetings, and seven months of correspondence we were married on 3 March 1918.&quot; This was done partly as a joke so that Dukes could get four weeks of extended leave instead of two days. Their marriage lasted 41 years, until he died in 1959; the couple had two daughters, Angela (1920–2006) and Helena. The poet, Aidan Andrew Dun, is her grandson.

==Training==
Rambert began her dance training in her schooling early on. Subjects such as foreign languages and history seemed to come easy; however she was a restless child and ended up getting bad marks because of her endless movements during class. At one point in her early training her dance instructor stated that &#x27;In her, was the true spirit of dance.&#x27; She was unimpressed with the structure and performance of ballet, and was not drawn into dance as a passion until she became enthralled by Isadora Duncan when, in 1904, she attended one of Duncan&#x27;s performances, and was &quot;profoundly moved by the beauty of Duncan&#x27;s dance&quot;.

In 1905, after becoming active in political riots, and the tragic day of May Day, Rambert&#x27;s parents urged her at one point to move to Paris and take up medicine while safely living with her aunt and uncle who were also doctors. She attended a party where she danced a mazurka and danced it with such liveliness that there was applause afterwards; this was her first performance, whether she thought it or not. She met Raymond Duncan, brother of Isadora, at this same party, who congratulated her on a wonderful performance, and again she was back into her passion for dance. She studied with Madame Rat from the Paris Opera, and later studied with Émile Jaques-Dalcroze, at Dalcroze College who introduced her to eurhythmics.

One day at the Dalcroze College, Sergei Diaghilev, watched a class and then asked her to come back to Berlin and study with him in the Ballets Russes. There, Rambert aided them with figuring out Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; with Vaslav Nijinsky. She hesitantly accepted and collaborated with the Ballets Russes led by Diaghilev from 1912 to 1913. In Ballets Russes she was in the corps de ballet for ballet performances such as &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, &quot;Giselle&quot;, and &quot;Scheherazade&quot;. After a tour with Nijinsky and Ballets Russes, Rambert&#x27;s contract was not continued and she decided it was time for a new chapter. In 1914, she moved to the United Kingdom, and studied under Enrico Cecchetti.

==Ballet Rambert==

After studying with Cecchetti, she went back to study with Madame Rat at the Paris Opera, and took her studies quite seriously. She began teaching more ballet classes in 1919 and later founded her own ballet school in Bedford Gardens. In 1926 she created her own company, originally named Ballet Club. It has been through many name changes, much like Rambert herself. The company began performing at night revues in London. The first informal show was performed in &quot;Riverside Nights&quot; at the Lyric Theatre, and continued with the nightly revues for a while. She began finding new and promising dancers and choreographers in numerous places, such as Frederick Ashton, to be a part of her company and gave them a chance to grow. From Marie Rambert Dancers, the company changed to Ballet Rambert, later Rambert Dance Company, and from 2014 just named Rambert, a contemporary dance company which tours internationally. It dates its birth to the first performance of Frederick Ashton&#x27;s &quot;A Tragedy of Fashion&quot; (1926), making it the first ballet company in Britain.

Ashley Dukes, Marie&#x27;s husband, renovated a building and made it into Mercury Theatre, where the majority of Ballet Rambert&#x27;s performance occurred. It was said that &#x27;Notting Hill Gate, where the Mercury Theatre stood, was on the slopes of Olympus&#x27;. Ballet Rambert has performed such ballets as &quot;Coppelia&quot;, as well as Balanchine&#x27;s &quot;Night Shadow&quot;.

Rambert was adamant about finding new and upcoming choreographers. Some of her students and later her colleagues included Ashton, Antony Tudor, and Agnes de Mille, to name a few. In 1965 Rambert, with the help of &quot;Norman Morrice, her newest discovery, completely reorganized the company to stress modern dance&quot;. The repertoire of the company eventually came back to more contemporary ballets, but still has a vast list of pieces that the company has performed throughout the years. She cooperated with Millicent Hodson, to restore Nijinsky&#x27;s choreography of &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; in 1979. The restoration of choreography was completed in 1987. Rambert is known for helping to create and keep the ballet community strong in Britain. &quot;The creation of Ballet in Britain is one of the grandest achievements in the artistic annals of our century. It is owed absolutely to the idealism which fired Rambert and Ninette de Valois&quot;, the founder of The Royal Ballet. She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1962, when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate.

==Death==
She died at her home in Campden Hill Gardens on 12 June 1982, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 17 June. Her ashes are within the Cloister Walk in section B.

<text>A picture stone, image stone or figure stone is an ornate slab of stone, usually limestone, which was raised in Germanic Iron Age or Viking Age Scandinavia, and in the greatest number on Gotland. More than four hundred picture stones are known today. All of the stones were probably erected as memorial stones, but only rarely beside graves. Some of them have been positioned where many people could see them at bridges and on roads.

They mainly differ from runestones by presenting the message in pictures rather than runes. Some picture stones also have runic inscriptions, but they tell little more than to whom the stone was dedicated. Lacking textual explanations, the image stones are consequently difficult to interpret. Similar stones in Scotland are known as Pictish stones. The largest of the picture stones on Gotland is found in Änge in Buttle. It is tall and is richly ornamented in the style of the 8th century.

== Groups ==
The dating of the stones is based on studies of their shapes and ornamentations. Subsequently, three distinct groups of stones exist with various aesthetics, locations and purposes.

=== AD 400–600 ===
The first group of picture stones was made in the period 400–600. These have a straight form and the upper part is shaped like the edge of an axe. The ornamentations are usually circular forms with vortex patterns and spirals, but also with images of ships, people, and animals. These older stones were usually raised within grave fields, albeit not on the graves themselves.

=== AD 500–700 ===
The second group of picture stones come from the period 500–700, and they are small stones with stylized patterns.
=== AD 700–1100 ===
The third group was made in the period 700–1100 and they consist of tall stones with necks and tall bow-shaped profiles. Their ornamentations present a rich array of pictures: ships with checkered sails and scenes with figures in different fields. The borders are often decorated with various plaited patterns. Many scenes show sacrifices and battles, and a common scene on the stones is a man, riding a horse, welcomed by a woman holding a drinking horn. What is seen are representations of a wealth of legends and myths. Sometimes depictions from Norse mythology and Norse legends can be identified, but largely the stories behind them have not survived in written form.

The image stones are valuable sources which complete knowledge from archaeology concerning ships and sails, and they provide information on armor, wagons, and sleighs. The later stones in this group feature an upper field with stylized cross and dragon patterns in the style of some runestones. These stones usually were raised on roads and at bridges to be visible.

== Isle of Man ==

A comparable tradition is found on the Isle of Man where high funeral crosses of stone were richly ornamented with the same teeming world of warriors and Norse deities as the image stones of Gotland.

<doc id="1208387" wikidata="Q1459722" url="?curid=1208387" title="Hook Head">
<text>Hook Head (), historically called Rindowan, is a headland in County Wexford, Ireland, on the east side of the estuary of The Three Sisters (Rivers Nore, Suir and Barrow). It is part of the Hook peninsula and is adjacent to the historic townland of Loftus Hall. It is situated on the R734 road, from Wexford town. 

In Irish its name was originally &quot;Rinn Dubháin&quot;, Dubhán&#x27;s point, named for a 5th-century Brittonic saint of that name (literally &quot;little black [haired] one&quot;). The English name is possibly a calque of his name, incorrectly read as being &quot;dubán&quot;, &quot;fishing-hook&quot;.

==Lighthouse==
This area is the location of Hook Lighthouse, the oldest working lighthouse in the world. Access to the lighthouse is by guided tours only which are available all year around. At the foot of the light house there is a cafe, gift shop and a maritime exhibition. The lighthouse is a destination on the Ireland&#x27;s Ancient East tourist route.

==Notable events==
In October 2007 it was reported that a significant amount of oil had been found off the coast of Hook head, in the north Celtic Sea. An Irish company, Providence Resources had drilled test holes and were said to have discovered good quality oil.

The annual &quot;Hook Conference&quot; antiques festival showcases local and international hooks.

<doc id="1208388" wikidata="Q7600949" url="?curid=1208388" title="Star Trails">
<text>Star Trails is a 2004 album by Canadian band Spirit of the West. It was their first album of new material since &quot;Weights and Measures&quot; in 1997, and their first for independent label MapleMusic Recordings, but their final album of new material.

The album cover is a long-exposure photograph with &quot;star trails&quot;, taken at Mount Kilimanjaro and created by leaving the camera&#x27;s shutter open for a minimum of 15 minutes.

&quot;July&quot; was the album&#x27;s first single, and the band&#x27;s first significant radio hit since &quot;Tell Me What I Think&quot; (from the 1995 album &quot;Two Headed&quot;).

&quot;Come Back Oscar&quot; is a tribute to Calgary musician Oscar Lopez, a friend of the band&#x27;s who had been absent from the folk festival circuit for several years due to a battle with depression. In what several music critics described as one of 2004&#x27;s most thrilling moments in Canadian music, Lopez joined the band at the Calgary and Edmonton folk festivals in July to perform the song. According to one writer for the &quot;Calgary Sun&quot;, &quot;if there was a dry eye in the house, it was glass.&quot;

&quot;King of Scotland&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single, is about Idi Amin, who once proclaimed himself king of Scotland after becoming infatuated with the country on a state visit to Great Britain.

&quot;Enough, Already Alright (Hello Cleveland)&quot; takes the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to task for being nothing more than &quot;a glorified Hard Rock Cafe,&quot; with none of the grit and excitement that is usually associated with rock and roll music.

<text>In mathematics, the Lasker–Noether theorem states that every Noetherian ring is a Lasker ring, which means that every ideal can be decomposed as an intersection, called primary decomposition, of finitely many &quot;primary ideals&quot; (which are related to, but not quite the same as, powers of prime ideals). The theorem was first proven by for the special case of polynomial rings and convergent power series rings, and was proven in its full generality by .

The Lasker–Noether theorem is an extension of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and more generally the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups to all Noetherian rings. The theorem plays an important role in algebraic geometry, by asserting that every algebraic set may be uniquely decomposed into a finite union of irreducible components.

It has a straightforward extension to modules stating that every submodule of a finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring is a finite intersection of primary submodules. This contains the case for rings as a special case, considering the ring as a module over itself, so that ideals are submodules. This also generalizes the primary decomposition form of the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, and for the special case of polynomial rings over a field, it generalizes the decomposition of an algebraic set into a finite union of (irreducible) varieties.

The first algorithm for computing primary decompositions for polynomial rings over a field of characteristic 0 was published by Noether&#x27;s student . The decomposition does not hold in general for non-commutative Noetherian rings. Noether gave an example of a non-commutative Noetherian ring with a right ideal that is not an intersection of primary ideals.

==Primary decomposition of an ideal==
Let formula_1 be a Noetherian commutative ring. An ideal formula_2 of formula_1 is called primary if it is a proper ideal and for each pair of elements formula_4 and formula_5 in formula_1 such that formula_7 is in formula_2, either formula_4 or some power of formula_5 is in formula_2; equivalently, every zero-divisor in the quotient formula_12 is nilpotent. The radical of a primary ideal formula_13 is a prime ideal and formula_13 is said to be formula_15-primary for formula_16.

Let formula_2 be an ideal in formula_1. Then formula_2 has an irredundant primary decomposition into primary ideals:

:formula_20.

Irredundancy means:

*Removing any of the formula_21 changes the intersection, i.e. for each formula_22 we have: formula_23.
*The prime ideals formula_24 are all distinct.

Moreover, this decomposition is unique in the two ways:
*The set formula_25 is uniquely determined by formula_2, and
*If formula_27 is a minimal element of the above set, then formula_21 is uniquely determined by formula_2; in fact, formula_21 is the pre-image of formula_31 under the localization map formula_32.
Primary ideals which correspond to non-minimal prime ideals over formula_2 are in general not unique (see an example below). For the existence of the decomposition, see #Primary decomposition from associated primes below.

The elements of formula_25 are called the prime divisors of formula_2 or the primes belonging to formula_2. In the language of module theory, as discussed below, the set formula_25 is also the set of associated primes of the formula_1-module formula_12. Explicitly, that means that there exist elements formula_40 in formula_1 such that
:formula_42

By a way of shortcut, some authors call an associated prime of formula_12 simply an associated prime of formula_2 (note this practice will conflict with the usage in the module theory).
*The minimal elements of formula_25 are the same as the minimal prime ideals containing formula_2 and are called isolated primes.
*The non-minimal elements, on the other hand, are called the embedded primes.

In the case of the ring of integers formula_47, the Lasker–Noether theorem is equivalent to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. If an integer formula_48 has prime factorization formula_49, then the primary decomposition of the ideal formula_50 generated by formula_48 in formula_47, is

:formula_53

Similarly, in a unique factorization domain, if an element has a prime factorization formula_54 where formula_55 is a unit, then the primary decomposition of the principal ideal generated by formula_56 is 
:formula_57

===Examples===
The examples of the section are designed for illustrating some properties of primary decompositions, which may appear as surprising or counter-intuitive. All examples are ideals in a polynomial ring over a field .

====Intersection vs. product====
The primary decomposition in formula_58 of the ideal formula_59 is
:formula_60

Because of the generator of degree one, is not the product of two larger ideals. A similar example is given, in two indeterminates by
:formula_61

====Primary vs. prime power====
In formula_62, the ideal formula_63 is a primary ideal that has formula_64 as associated prime. It is not a power of its associated prime.

====Non-uniqueness and embedded prime ====

For every positive integer , a primary decomposition in formula_62 of the ideal formula_66 is
:formula_67

The associated primes are 
:formula_68

Example: Let &quot;N&quot; = &quot;R&quot; = &quot;k&quot;[&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;] for some field &quot;k&quot;, and let &quot;M&quot; be the ideal (&quot;xy&quot;, &quot;y&quot;2). Then &quot;M&quot; has two different minimal primary decompositions
&quot;M&quot; = (&quot;y&quot;) ∩ (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;2) = (&quot;y&quot;) ∩ (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;, &quot;y&quot;2).
The minimal prime is (&quot;y&quot;) and the embedded prime is (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;).

====Non-associated prime between two associated primes====
In formula_69 the ideal formula_70 has the (non-unique) primary decomposition
:formula_71
The associated prime ideals are formula_72 and formula_73 is a non associated prime ideal such that
:formula_74
====A complicated example====
Unless for very simple examples, a primary decomposition may be hard to compute and may have a very complicated output. The following example has been designed for providing such a complicated output, and, nevertheless, being accessible to hand-written computation.

Let
:formula_75
be two homogeneous polynomials in , whose coefficients formula_76 are polynomials in other indeterminates formula_77 over a field . That is, and belong to formula_78 and it is in this ring that a primary decomposition of the ideal formula_79 is searched. For computing the primary decomposition, we suppose first that 1 is a greatest common divisor of and .

This condition implies that has no primary component of height one. As is generated by two elements, this implies that it is a complete intersection (more precisely, it defines an algebraic set, which is a complete intersection), and thus all primary components have height two. Therefore, the associated primes of are exactly the primes ideals of height two that contain .

It follows that formula_80 is an associated prime of .

Let formula_81 be the homogeneous resultant in of and . As the greatest common divisor of and is a constant, the resultant is not zero, and resultant theory implies that contains all products of by a monomial in of degree . As formula_82 all these monomials belong to the primary component contained in formula_83 This primary component contains and , and the behavior of primary decompositions under localization shows that this primary component is 
:formula_84

In short, we have a primary component, with the very simple associated prime formula_85 such all its generating sets involve all indeterminates.

The other primary component contains . One may prove that if and are sufficiently generic (for example if the coefficients of and are distinct indeterminates), then there is only another primary component, which is a prime ideal, and is generated by , and .

=== Geometric interpretation ===
In algebraic geometry, an affine algebraic set is defined as the set of the common zeros of an ideal of a polynomial ring formula_86

An irredundant primary decomposition
:formula_87
of defines a decomposition of into a union of algebraic sets , which are irreducible, as not being the union of two smaller algebraic sets.

If formula_88 is the associated prime of formula_21, then formula_90 and Lasker–Noether theorem shows that has a unique irredundant decomposition into irreducible algebraic varieties
:formula_91 
where the union is restricted to minimal associated primes. These minimal associated primes are the primary components of the radical of . For this reason, the primary decomposition of the radical of is sometimes called the &quot;prime decomposition&quot; of .

The components of a primary decomposition (as well as of the algebraic set decomposition) corresponding to minimal primes are said &quot;isolated&quot;, and the others are said &quot;&quot;.

For the decomposition of algebraic varieties, only the minimal primes are interesting, but in intersection theory, and, more generally in scheme theory, the complete primary decomposition has a geometric meaning.

== Primary decomposition from associated primes ==
Nowadays, it is common to do primary decomposition of ideals and modules within the theory of associated primes. Bourbaki&#x27;s influential textbook &quot;Algèbre commutative&quot;, in particular, takes this approach.

Let &quot;R&quot; be a ring and &quot;M&quot; a module over it. By definition, an associated prime is a prime ideal which is the annihilator of a nonzero element of &quot;M&quot;; that is, formula_92 for some formula_93 (this implies formula_94). Equivalently, a prime ideal formula_15 is an associated prime of &quot;M&quot; if there is an injection of &quot;R&quot;-modules formula_96.

A maximal element of the set of annihilators of nonzero elements of &quot;M&quot; can be shown to be a prime ideal and thus, when &quot;R&quot; is a Noetherian ring, there exists an associated prime of &quot;M&quot; if and only if &quot;M&quot; is nonzero.

The set of associated primes of &quot;M&quot; is denoted by formula_97 or formula_98. Directly from the definition,
*If formula_99, then formula_100.
*For an exact sequence formula_101, formula_102.
*If &quot;R&quot; is a Noetherian ring, then formula_103 where formula_104 refers to support. Also, the set of minimal elements of formula_98 is the same as the set of minimal elements of formula_106.

If &quot;M&quot; is a finitely generated module over &quot;R&quot;, then there is a finite ascending sequence of submodules
: formula_107
such that each quotient &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; /&quot;M&quot;&quot;i−1&quot; is isomorphic to formula_108 for some prime ideals formula_109, each of which is necessarily in the support of &quot;M&quot;. Moreover every associated prime of &quot;M&quot; occurs among the set of primes formula_109; i.e.,
:formula_111.
(In general, these inclusions are not the equalities.) In particular, formula_98 is a finite set when &quot;M&quot; is finitely generated.

Let formula_113 be a finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring &quot;R&quot; and &quot;N&quot; a submodule of &quot;M&quot;. Given formula_114, the set of associated primes of formula_115, there exist submodules formula_116 such that formula_117 and
:formula_118
A submodule &quot;N&quot; of &quot;M&quot; is called &quot;formula_15-primary&quot; if formula_120. A submodule of the &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;R&quot; is formula_15-primary as a submodule if and only if it is a formula_15-primary ideal; thus, when formula_123, the above decomposition is precisely a primary decomposition of an ideal.

Taking formula_124, the above decomposition says the set of associated primes of a finitely generated module &quot;M&quot; is the same as formula_125 when formula_126 (without finite generation, there can be infinitely many associated primes.)

== Properties of associated primes ==
Let formula_1 be a Noetherian ring. Then
*The set of zero-divisors on &quot;R&quot; is the same as the union of the associated primes of &quot;R&quot; (this is because the set of zerodivisors of &quot;R&quot; is the union of the set of annihilators of nonzero elements, the maximal elements of which are associated primes).
* For the same reason, the union of the associated primes of an &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; is exactly the set of zero-divisors on &quot;M&quot;, that is, an element &quot;r&quot; such that the endomorphism formula_128 is not injective.
* Given a subset formula_129, &quot;M&quot; an &quot;R&quot;-module , there exists a submodule formula_130 such that formula_131 and formula_132.
*Let formula_133 be a multiplicative subset, formula_113 an formula_1-module and formula_136 the set of all prime ideals of formula_1 not intersecting formula_138. Then formula_139 is a bijection. Also, formula_140.
* Any prime ideal minimal with respect to containing an ideal &quot;J&quot; is in formula_141 These primes are precisely the isolated primes.
* A module &quot;M&quot; over &quot;R&quot; has finite length if and only if &quot;M&quot; is finitely generated and formula_142 consists of maximal ideals.
*Let formula_143 be a ring homomorphism between Noetherian rings and &quot;F&quot; a &quot;B&quot;-module that is flat over &quot;A&quot;. Then, for each &quot;A&quot;-module &quot;E&quot;,
:formula_144.

== Non-Noetherian case ==
The next theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a ring to have primary decompositions for its ideals.
The proof is given at Chapter 4 of Atiyah–Macdonald as a series of exercises.

There is the following uniqueness theorem for an ideal having a primary decomposition.

Now, for any commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, an ideal &quot;I&quot; and a minimal prime &quot;P&quot; over &quot;I&quot;, the pre-image of &quot;I&quot; &quot;R&quot;&quot;P&quot; under the localization map is the smallest &quot;P&quot;-primary ideal containing &quot;I&quot;. Thus, in the setting of preceding theorem, the primary ideal &quot;Q&quot; corresponding to a minimal prime &quot;P&quot; is also the smallest &quot;P&quot;-primary ideal containing &quot;I&quot; and is called the &quot;P&quot;-primary component of &quot;I&quot;.

For example, if the power &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; of a prime &quot;P&quot; has a primary decomposition, then its &quot;P&quot;-primary component is the &quot;n&quot;-th symbolic power of &quot;P&quot;.

==Additive theory of ideals==

This result is the first in an area now known as the additive theory of ideals, which studies the ways of representing an ideal as the intersection of a special class of ideals. The decision on the &quot;special class&quot;, e.g., primary ideals, is a problem in itself. In the case of non-commutative rings, the class of tertiary ideals is a useful substitute for the class of primary ideals.

<doc id="1208396" wikidata="Q6307312" url="?curid=1208396" title="Julian Knight (murderer)">
<text>Julian Knight (born 4 March 1968) is an Australian mass murderer. On 9 August 1987, he shot seven people dead and injured 19 during a shooting spree in Clifton Hill, Victoria, Australia, in what became known as the Hoddle Street massacre.

Knight is serving seven concurrent sentences of life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 27 years. The judge who sentenced him, Justice George Hampel, stated that there were &quot;a number of significant mitigatory factors&quot; and &quot;the fixing of a minimum term in this case is appropriate because of your age and your prospects of rehabilitation.&quot; The Crown prosecutor, Joe Dickson QC, &quot;did not contend that a minimum term should not be fixed.&quot;

Knight is incarcerated in the maximum security Port Phillip Prison in Truganina near Melbourne. He would have been eligible for parole in 2014 except that the Victorian government passed and approved of legislation which ensures that he is kept in jail until he dies, is in immediate danger of dying, or is so incapacitated that he no longer poses a danger to others. Knight has challenged the validity of the legislation many times, but lost his final appeal to the High Court in August 2017.

== Early life ==

Julian Knight is the eldest of three children. When he was ten days old he was adopted by a family with strong army ties. Knight moved often as a child, living in Melbourne, Puckapunyal, and also abroad in Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. In early 1975, Knight&#x27;s family settled in Laverton, Victoria and he attended Laverton Primary School until the end of 1978. His parents divorced in 1980 when he was 12. He then attended Westbourne Grammar School, Fitzroy High School, and later Melbourne High School, a selective secondary school with entry by academic examination. An entry written by students in the 1985 Melbourne High School yearbook says: Julian &#x27;Swapo&#x27; Knight inherited the role of &quot;cadet unit looney and chief political agitator&quot;. While at Westbourne, he was known for his fascination with guns and the military with strong interests in Nazi Germany and World War II. In 1986, he attended La Trobe University to study French, German history, and politics.

== Military career ==

Knight joined the Australian Army Cadets aged 14 and served in two cadet units, the Norwood Secondary College Cadet Unit and the Melbourne HSCU. He later enlisted in the Army Reserve at the age of 17 while still in high school, serving as a trooper in the 4th/19th Prince of Wales&#x27;s Light Horse Regiment, an armoured reconnaissance unit. Knight entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon on 13 January 1987 at the age of 18. While a military career had long been a dream, he performed poorly at studies and gained good results only in weapons expertise exercises. Knight was advised to leave the army in July 1987 after an incident in which he stabbed his superior, a sergeant, while drinking.

==Hoddle Street massacre==

On the evening of Sunday, 9 August 1987, Knight began firing two rifles and a shotgun on Hoddle Street in the Melbourne suburb of Clifton Hill. The shootings resulted in the deaths of seven people and serious injury to nineteen others. After a police chase lasting more than thirty minutes, Knight was apprehended in nearby Fitzroy North and arrested for the shootings.

During the trial, it was asserted that Knight had a personality disorder with hysterical features. Knight plead guilty to 7 counts of murder and 46 counts of attempted murder, and was sentenced to seven concurrent terms of life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 27 years.

The Hoddle Street massacre has been the subject of several books, and two Australian TV documentaries: ABC TV&#x27;s &quot;Hoddle Street&quot; (1988) and GTV Channel 9&#x27;s &quot;Hoddle Street&quot; (2007).

== Prison life ==
Knight is an inmate in the mainstream section of the maximum security Port Phillip Prison near Melbourne. He has initiated many legal challenges to the Victoria Government while imprisoned. Knight&#x27;s challenges often concern events and occurrences arising during his imprisonment and his dissatisfaction with prison management and prison discipline. He has spent twelve years of his sentence in high-security management facilities.

=== Sentence ===

On the 20th anniversary of the Hoddle Street massacre, the judge who sentenced Knight, Professor George Hampel, stood by the sentence he gave him.

Shortly before Knight became eligible for parole in 2014, the Victorian Parliament passed the &quot;Corrections Amendment (Parole) Act 2014&quot; (Vic), which amended the &quot;Corrections Act 1986&quot; (Vic) to prevent the parole board from ordering Knight&#x27;s release &quot;unless satisfied, amongst other things, that Mr Knight is in imminent danger of dying or is seriously incapacitated and that, as a result, he no longer has the physical ability to do harm to any person.&quot;

=== Legal challenges ===
On 7 September 1992, Knight appeared before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal seeking a review of a decision where he was refused AUSTUDY assistance with his university studies while imprisoned. On 22 October 2001, Knight appeared before the Supreme Court of Victoria in his first Supreme Court case against the prison authorities, seeking an injunction ordering the return of documents prepared for the inquest into the death of a prisoner who had hanged himself in 2000. The documents were returned in court that day and the application was dismissed.

On 4 July 2002, Knight appeared before the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) with a complaint regarding an abuse of human rights where prison officers removed items &quot;of a political nature&quot; from his cell. The items removed were a collection of business cards, pamphlets and sheets of paper. One sheet of the paper had a large picture of Adolf Hitler in uniform. A second had a picture of Hitler with Nazi insignia and skull and cross-bones, and others only the insignia. The cards featured slogans such as &quot;Stop the Asian invasion&quot;, &quot;We just hate all queers&quot;, &quot;White power&quot; and &quot;Dial-a-racist&quot; with contact details.

Along with the posters and paperwork, a large number of contraband items were found in Knight&#x27;s cell, such as blades, sharpened knives, white supremacist literature, war literature, medication bottles, a leather belt, two television remote controls, an extension lead, a can opener, bale hooks, permanent markers, computer disks many containing information relating to prison security and staff, pornographic material, sandpaper, masking tape, prison manuals, staff pictures, T.A.B. betting information, and prison and staff rosters. Knight&#x27;s application was dismissed, even though many of the seized items were returned to him.

On 21 August 2002, Knight appeared before the Supreme Court of Victoria seeking an injunction ordering that prison management and staff cease inspecting and withholding legal mail sent to or by the plaintiff. The application was dismissed. On 2 September 2002, Knight appeared before VCAT seeking access to various prison documents under the &quot;Freedom of Information Act 1982&quot; (Vic). On 9 September, Knight appeared before the VCAT seeking, &quot;Full access to the daily staff rosters for HM Prison Barwon since the 1st May 2001&quot; under the Freedom of Information Act. The application was affirmed.

On 7 October 2003, Knight appeared before the Supreme Court of Victoria seeking injunctions in regards to opening of private legal mail, prison disciplinary hearings, conditions in solitary confinement cells and Knight&#x27;s security classification and imprisonment in Barwon Prison&#x27;s high security Acacia wing. Supreme Court Judge Justice Philip Cummins said of Knight&#x27;s application: &quot;I consider that ordinary tax-payers should not be fixed with the burden of these proceedings. Accordingly, in each instance I order that the costs of the proceedings of the respective defendants be paid by the plaintiff.&quot; The application was dismissed. On 11 November 2003, Knight appeared before the Supreme Court of Victoria seeking an extension of time against a decision of VCAT. The application was dismissed with costs awarded against the applicant.

On 26 November 2013, Knight made a 94-page submission to the Defence Abuse Response Task Force (DART). In 2014, he initiated court proceedings in the ACT Supreme Court against the Commonwealth of Australia seeking damages for the bastardisation he allegedly suffered whilst at Duntroon.

=== Vexatious litigant ===
In February 2003, it was estimated the many legal challenges by Knight had cost the Victorian Government over A$250,000, and approximately $128,000 had been spent since October 2001 on external legal advice to deal with Knight&#x27;s legal appeals and Freedom of Information requests.

On 19 October 2004, Knight was barred from launching any further legal action in Victoria&#x27;s courts for ten years, with a judge declaring him a vexatious litigant. He was the 13th person to be declared a vexatious litigant in Victoria since 1930, and the first prisoner. Knight is still able to make requests under the &quot;Freedom of Information Act&quot;. On 19 June 2008, Knight made a submission to the Victorian Parliament Law Reform Committee&#x27;s Inquiry into Vexatious Litigants.

In June 2009, Knight sued Victorian Attorney-General Rob Hulls to force him to appear before the Supreme Court and to remove his status as a &quot;vexatious litigant&quot;. He also claims the status &quot;is being used as an instrument of oppression by Corrections Victoria&quot; and says his request for access to a personal computer in his cell was denied.

=== Requests for rehabilitation ===
On 26 June 2007, Knight told the Supreme Court of Victoria he wants access to rehabilitation programs in prison to improve his chance of parole. He also sought permission to write a letter of &quot;apology and explanation&quot; to one of his victims. The court heard prison authorities intercepted a letter Knight tried to send to one of his victims. He was charged with two prison offences and spent six days in solitary confinement. Knight told the court a letter of apology did not fit the prison guidelines for a prohibited letter, stating, &quot;A letter of apology constitutes a facet of my rehabilitation and on a small measure of making amends for my actions,&quot; he told the court. Knight was given leave by the Court to proceed with his case.

<doc id="1208398" wikidata="Q1757003" url="?curid=1208398" title="Poppyseed oil">
<text>Poppyseed oil (also poppy seed oil and poppy oil) is an edible oil obtained from poppy seeds (specifically seeds of &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot;, the opium poppy).

Poppy seeds yield 45–50% oil. Like poppy seeds, poppyseed oil is highly palatable, high in vitamin E, and has no narcotic properties. Poppy seeds are especially high in tocopherols other than vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol). Compared to other vegetable oils, poppyseed oil has a moderate amount of phytosterols: higher than soybean oil and peanut oil, lower than safflower oil, sesame oil, wheat germ oil, corn oil, and rice bran oil. It has little or no odor and a pleasant taste, and it is less likely than some other oils to become rancid.

==Uses==
The oil is sometimes used as a cooking oil; it is also used for moisturizing skin. Its primary use, however, is in the manufacture of paints, varnishes, and soaps.

Poppyseed oil is a drying oil. In oil painting, the most popular oil for binding pigment, thinning paint, and varnishing finished paintings is linseed oil. Walnut oil and poppyseed oil are also favored by oil painters, though each oil is used for a different purpose. Poppyseed oil is used especially in white paints. Up through the late 19th century, when these oils became available prepared in tubes, painters tended to prepare them by hand.

While poppyseed oil does not leave the unwanted yellow tint for which linseed oil is known, it is much weaker in the test of time than the contemporary linseed oil. Poppyseed oil dries much more slowly (5–7 days) than linseed oil (3–5 days). For this reason poppyseed oil should not be used for a ground layer of a painting, and linseed oil should not be painted over a layer of poppyseed oil.

Poppyseed oil is the basis of lipiodol, a radiocontrast agent used in medical radiology and a treatment for iodine deficiency.

==History==
An early 20th century industry manual states that while the opium poppy was grown extensively in Eurasia, most of the world production of poppyseed oil occurred in France and Germany, from poppy seeds imported from other countries. From 1900 to 1911, France and Germany together produced on the order of 60,000,000 kilograms per year. At that time, poppyseed oil was used primarily to dress salads and frequently was adulterated with sesame oil and hazelnut oil to improve the taste of oil from stored (rancid) seeds. Poppyseed oil was used to adulterate olive oil and peach kernel oil.

<text>Mameluco is a Portuguese word that denotes the first generation child of a European and an Amerindian. It corresponds to the Spanish word &quot;mestizo&quot;.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, &quot;mameluco&quot; was also used to refer to organized bands of explorers from Colonial Brazil known as &quot;bandeirantes&quot;, who roamed the interior of South America departing from São Paulo near the Atlantic Ocean to the interior of Brazil and Paraguay, invading Guarani settlements in search of slaves and gold.

The word may have become common in Portugal in the Middle Ages, deriving from the Arabic, &quot;Mamluk&quot;, &quot;slave&quot;, commonly referring to soldiers and rulers of slave origin, especially in Egypt.

<doc id="1208403" wikidata="Q781337" url="?curid=1208403" title="Australian Atomic Energy Commission">
<text>The Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC) was a statutory body of the Australian Government devoted to nuclear science, engineering and research.

It was established in 1952, replacing the Atomic Energy Policy Committee. In 1981, parts of the Commission were split off to become part of the CSIRO, the remainder continuing until 1987, when it was replaced by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). The Commission’s head office was based in the heritage-listed house Cliffbrook in Coogee, Sydney, New South Wales, while its main facilities were located at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Lucas Heights, to the south of Sydney, established in 1958.

Highlights of the Commission&#x27;s history included:

*Major roles in the establishment of the IAEA and the system of international safeguards.
*The construction of the HIFAR and MOATA research reactors at Lucas Heights.
*The selection of the preferred tender for the construction of the proposed Jervis Bay Nuclear Power Plant.
*The Ranger Uranium Mine joint venture.

Other significant facilities constructed by the Commission at Lucas Heights included a 3MeV Van de Graaff particle accelerator, installed in 1964 to provide proton beams and now upgraded to become ANTARES, a smaller 1.3MeV betatron, and radioisotope production and remote handling facilities associated with HIFAR reactor.

Significant research work included:

*Radiochemistry.
*Neutron diffraction.
*Sodium coolant systems.
*Use of beryllium as a neutron moderator.
*Movement of spheres in a closed-packed lattice.
*Gas centrifuge development.
*Health physics.
*Environmental science.
*Development of synroc.
*Molecular laser isotope separation and support of laser development for atomic vapor laser isotope separation.

<text>William Cox (19 December 1764 – 15 March 1837) was an English soldier, known as an explorer, road builder and pioneer in the early period of British settlement of Australia.

==Early life==
Cox was born in Wimborne Minster, Dorset, son of William Cox and Jane Harvey, and was educated at Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School in the town. He married Rebecca Upjohn in 1789.

==Military career==
Cox had served in the Wiltshire militia before being commissioned as ensign (without purchase) in the 117th Regiment of Foot on 11 July 1795, transferring on 23 January 1796 to the 68th (Durham) Regiment of Foot. He was promoted to lieutenant in the 68th Foot on 21 February 1797. He transferred to the New South Wales Corps on 30 September 1797, having changed places with a certain Lieutenant Beckwith, and was made paymaster on 23 June 1798.

Cox sailed for New South Wales on 24 August 1799 on the &quot;Minerva&quot;, with his wife and four sons. Aboard the ship were around 160 convicts, including Joseph Holt and Henry Fulton who were among many political prisoners. Cox used his influence so that the prisoners were often allowed up on deck for fresh air, and Holt in his memoirs states that as a result &quot;the ship was the healthiest and best regulated which had ever reached the colony&quot;.

The &quot;Minerva&quot; arrived in Sydney on 11 January 1800. Cox purchased a farm and made Holt its manager. Further land was purchased but in 1803 large liabilities led to Cox&#x27;s estate being placed into the hands of trustees. He was suspended from office due to allegations that regimental accounts were involved. Cox returned to England in 1807 to answer allegations that he had misused army funds. The &quot;Dictionary of Australian Biography&quot; records that Cox was cleared in 1808, and was promoted to Captain of 102nd Regiment of Foot, and placed in charge of Irish political prisoners. However, the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 19 April 1808 records, &quot;Paymaster William Cox, of the New South Wales Corps, is dismissed the Service.&quot;

==Building career==

In 1811 Cox returned to Australia. Once back there, he resigned his commission and became principal magistrate at Hawkesbury. He was also responsible for erecting many government buildings.

In 1814, Governor Lachlan Macquarie approved Cox&#x27;s &#x27;voluntary offer of your superintending and directing the working party&#x27; that would build a road crossing the Blue Mountains, between Sydney and Bathurst. The completed dirt track was wide by long, built between 18 July 1814 to 14 January 1815 using five free men, 30 convict labourers and eight soldiers.

Macquarie surveyed the finished road in April 1815 by driving his carriage along it from Sydney to Bathurst. He commended Cox and stated that the project would have taken three years if it had been done under a contract. As a reward Cox was awarded of land near Bathurst. The road became known as Cox&#x27;s Road and over time much of it has been bypassed in favour of easier grades.

==Treatment of Aboriginal People==
As landowner, magistrate and commander of the Windsor Garrison, William Cox organised punitive &amp; dispersive expeditions from July 1816 along the Nepean–Hawkesbury River in which he &#x27;reported&#x27; the killings of four Aboriginal men. Unlike the military offensive of April of that year that resulted in the Appin Massacre, the events of these raids and killings were barely recorded. In response to ongoing Aboriginal resistance to settlers, Cox had sent Governor Lachlan Macquarie a grim manifesto for a final showdown on the Hawkesbury-Nepean. Whatever &#x27;Friendship or good faith&#x27; existed between Aboriginal people and settlers, he declared, it did not protect settlers from &#x27;Revenge and Murder whenever the former are Insulted or think themselves aggrieved by any White people.&#x27; Five punitive parties were to comb the country repeatedly - the period was unspecified. Three detachments of soldiers, each with a constable who knew the area, and a &#x27;friendly native&#x27; as a guide, were to be posted at the Grose River, Windsor and downriver at Portland Head respectively. Young native-born men were also involved in these parties. Cox wanted the Aboriginal people to understand that, until the wanted men were captured or dead, &#x27;no peace will be given them.&#x27; Cox&#x27;s raids were eventually effective. On 1 November 1816 Macquarie published another grand proclamation announcing that hostilities had ceased. Silence then descended upon the Hawkesbury, effectively ending its frontier war.

At a public meeting in Bathurst in 1824 in response to frontier hostility on the other side of the Great Dividing Range where Cox had been given further large land grants by Macquarie, Cox is recorded as saying:

&quot;The best thing that can be done is to shoot all the blacks and manure the ground with their carcasses. That is all they are fit for. It is also recommended that all the women and children be shot. That is the most certain way of getting rid of this pestilent race&quot; 

==Family==

Rebecca Cox died in 1819, having borne five sons. In 1821, Cox married Anna Blachford, by whom he had another three sons and a daughter. Their son Alfred Cox was a large landholder in New Zealand and a member of the House of Representatives. Another son, Edward Cox, was a pastoralist who served on the New South Wales Legislative Council.

The BBC One television programme &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, which aired on 30 August 2010, traced the ancestry of Australian soap and pop star Jason Donovan through his mother Sue Menlove&#x27;s side of the family back to William Cox.

<text>Lea-Francis was a British motor manufacturing company that began by building bicycles.

==History==

R. H. Lea and G. I. Francis started the business in Coventry in 1895. They branched out into car manufacturing in 1903 and motorcycles in 1911. Lea-Francis built cars under licence for the Singer company. In 1919, they started to build their own cars from bought-in components.

From 1922, Lea-Francis formed a business relationship with Vulcan of Southport sharing manufacturing and dealers. Vulcan supplied bodies to Lea-Francis and in return received gearboxes and steering gear. Two six-cylinder Vulcan-designed and manufactured cars were marketed as Lea-Francis 14/40 and 16/60 as well as Vulcans. The association ended in 1928 when Vulcan stopped making cars.

A sporting image began to appear from about 1925, leading to models such as the Hyper and the Ace of Spades. The Hyper, also called the S-type, was the first British supercharged production car with a 1.5 litre Meadows engine, and in 1928 a Lea-Francis Hyper won the Ulster TT, a 30-lap race on the Ards circuit on the roads of Northern Ireland driven by race car driver Kaye Don. The race was watched by a record 250,000 spectators and the victory placed Lea-Francis firmly on the map.

The company was re-formed in 1937 under the chairmanship of George Leek with other ex-Riley Motor men such as R.H. Rose who designed a new engine for Lea-Francis having a similar layout to the Riley 12/4. The 12 hp and the 14 hp (actually 12.9 hp) were introduced in 1937 and continued until the start of the war in 1939 when production ceased and the factory concentrated on manufacturing for the war effort.

Post-war car production commenced in 1946 with updated vehicles based on the pre-war designs. The 14 hp Saloon and Sports were luxurious and sporty vehicles and were popular, if expensive. Eventually, an improved chassis with independent front suspension and hydraulic brakes was introduced across the range and in 1950 the 18 h.p. saloon and 2½ litre Sports, both with the more powerful 2.5 litre engine, were introduced. Production once again came to a halt in 1954 after only 85 2.5 Litre Sports had been built. The company had not been present at the Earl&#x27;s Court motor show since 1952.

A number of 14 hp Sports chassis were sold to Connaught Engineering where they became the L2 and L3 sports-racing cars. Connaught developed a Formula 2 racing engine for their &quot;A&quot; type single seater which was based on the Lea-Francis design.

The company had a chequered history with some notable motorcycles and cars, but financial difficulties surfaced on a regular basis. The Hillfields site was abandoned in 1937 when it was sold by the receiver and a new company, under a slightly different name, moved to Much Park Street in Coventry. It survived there until 1962 when the company finally closed.

The Lynx, a tube-framed 2+2 roadster with a Ford Zephyr 2.6 litre inline-six engine, was the final model produced by Lea-Francis. Unveiled at the October 1960 British Motor show, it was painted in mauve with gold trim. The model remained in prototype form and only 3 Lynx cars were made due to lack of demand.

A total of almost 10,000 Lea-Francis vehicles were made until production ceased due to the Lynx&#x27;s failure to capture the buying public&#x27;s attention. By the time of the Lynx&#x27;s launch, Lea-Francis was so financially distressed that they could not afford to build Lynxes unless they had been pre-ordered, and as none were, only three prototypes were made. Lea-Francis also dallied into starting production of the Fuldamobil Nobel bubble car to keep busy but it proved a frivolous plan and had competition from the famous Mini that was introduced in the late 1950s. More serious work was undertaken when a new prototype was built for a possible brand new saloon using a Chrysler V8 engine but the project remained unfinished. 
The motor manufacturing parts of the company passed into the hands of the receiver in 1962, leaving Lea-Francis to continue with their engineering business. The company&#x27;s material assets were purchased by Quinton Hazell Ltd., a motor vehicle component manufacturer, while the Lea-Francis name was purchased by English entrepreneur Barrie Price at about the same time.

In 1976 Barrie Price began work on a hand made new car which was to be an expensive Lea-Francis Nostalgia type tourer powered by a Jaguar running gear, recalling the same cars Lea-Francis was known for in the 1930s. Price&#x27;s firm, A.B.PRICE LIMITED, has continued to provide service and spares for the surviving cars since 1980 and has also built a number of retro Lea-Francis modern motor cars to special order, reviving the &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; name to their unique hand built model. These have a handsome aluminium body shell composed of a number of U.K.-made components, being produced as a two-seat coupé and a convertible. Both versions are powered by Jaguar Cars mechanicals and are produced at an average of 12-14 cars annually with a price tag at 20000 GBP according to motorbook author and writer G.N. Georgano.
A.B. Price sold Lea-Francis Ltd. and all its assets in July 2019.

==Lea-Francis car models==

==Lea-Francis Owners&#x27; Club==

The Lea-Francis Owners&#x27; Club has an ever-growing membership of around 340 members who own around 420 vehicles.

==Revival==

In 1998 it was believed that the Lea-Francis name might yet be seen again on the road when a new Lea-Francis sports car by the name of the 30/230, designed by James Randle, was shown at the Motor Show. Only a prototype was built before the project had to be abandoned.

<doc id="1208416" wikidata="Q1193988" url="?curid=1208416" title="Plating">
<text>Plating is a finishing process in which a metal is deposited on a surface. Plating has been done for hundreds of years; it is also critical for modern technology. Plating is used to decorate objects, for corrosion inhibition, to improve solderability, to harden, to improve wearability, to reduce friction, to improve paint adhesion, to alter conductivity, to improve IR reflectivity, for radiation shielding, and for other purposes. Jewelry typically uses plating to give a silver or gold finish.

Thin-film deposition has plated objects as small as an atom, therefore plating finds uses in nanotechnology.

There are several plating methods, and many variations. In one method, a solid surface is covered with a metal sheet, and then heat and pressure are applied to fuse them (a version of this is Sheffield plate). Other plating techniques include electroplating, vapor deposition under vacuum and sputter deposition. Recently, plating often refers to using liquids. Metallizing refers to coating metal on non-metallic objects.

==Electroplating==
In electroplating, an ionic metal is supplied with electrons to form a non-ionic coating on a . A common system involves a chemical solution with the ionic form of the metal, an anode (positively charged) which may consist of the metal being plated (a soluble anode) or an insoluble anode (usually carbon, platinum, titanium, lead, or steel), and finally, a cathode (negatively charged) where electrons are supplied to produce a film of non-ionic metal.

==Electroless deposition==
Electroless deposition, also known as chemical or auto-catalytic plating, is a non-galvanic plating method that involves several simultaneous reactions in an aqueous solution, which occur without the use of external electrical power. The reaction is accomplished when hydrogen is released by a reducing agent, normally sodium hypophosphite (Note: the hydrogen leaves as a hydride ion) or thiourea, and oxidized, thus producing a negative charge on the surface of the part. The most common electroless deposition method is electroless nickel plating, although silver, gold and copper layers can also be applied in this manner, as in the technique of angel gilding.

== Specific cases ==

=== Gold plating ===

Gold plating is a method of depositing a thin layer of gold on the surface of glass or metal, most often copper or silver.

Gold plating is often used in electronics, to provide a corrosion-resistant electrically conductive layer on copper, typically in electrical connectors and printed circuit boards. With direct gold-on-copper plating, the copper atoms have the tendency to diffuse through the gold layer, causing tarnishing of its surface and formation of an oxide/sulfide layer. Therefore, a layer of a suitable barrier metal, usually nickel, has to be deposited on the copper substrate, forming a copper-nickel-gold sandwich.

Metals and glass may also be coated with gold for ornamental purposes, using a number of different processes usually referred to as &quot;gilding&quot;.

Sapphires, plastics, and carbon fiber are some other materials that are able to be plated using advance plating techniques. The substrates that can be used are almost limitless.

=== Silver plating ===


Silver plating has been used since the 18th century to provide cheaper versions of household items that would otherwise be made of solid silver, including cutlery, vessels of various kinds, and candlesticks. In the UK the assay offices, and silver dealers and collectors, use the term &quot;silver plate&quot; for items made from solid silver, derived long before silver plating was invented from the Spanish word for silver &quot;plata&quot;, seizures of silver from Spanish ships carrying silver from America being a large source of silver at the time. This can cause confusion when talking about silver items; plate or plated. In the UK it is illegal to describe silver-plated items as &quot;silver&quot;. It is not illegal to describe silver-plated items as &quot;silver plate&quot;, although this is ungrammatical.

The earliest form of silver plating was Sheffield Plate, where thin sheets of silver are fused to a layer or core of base metal, but in the 19th century new methods of production (including electroplating) were introduced. Britannia metal is an alloy of tin, antimony and copper developed as a base metal for plating with silver.

Another method that can be used to apply a thin layer of silver to objects such as glass, is to place Tollens&#x27; reagent in a glass, add glucose/dextrose, and shake the bottle to promote the reaction.



For applications in electronics, silver is sometimes used for plating copper, as its electrical resistance is lower (see Resistivity of various materials); more so at higher frequencies due to the skin effect. Variable capacitors are considered of the highest quality when they have silver-plated plates. Similarly, silver-plated, or even solid silver cables, are prized in audiophile applications; however some experts consider that in practice the plating is often poorly implemented, making the result inferior to similarly priced copper cables.

Care should be used for parts exposed to high humidity environments because in such environments, when the silver layer is porous or contains cracks, the underlying copper undergoes rapid galvanic corrosion, flaking off the plating and exposing the copper itself; a process known as red plague. Silver plated copper maintained in a moisture-free environment will not undergo this type of corrosion.

=== Copper plating ===

Copper plating is the process of electrolytically forming a layer of copper on the surface of an item. It is commonly used as an even cheaper alternative to silver plating as it is much cheaper than silver.

=== Rhodium plating ===
Rhodium plating is occasionally used on white gold, silver or copper and its alloys. A barrier layer of nickel is usually deposited on silver first, though in this case it is not to prevent migration of silver through rhodium, but to prevent contamination of the rhodium bath with silver and copper, which slightly dissolve in the sulfuric acid usually present in the bath composition.

=== Chrome plating ===
Chrome plating is a finishing treatment using the electrolytic deposition of chromium. The most common form of chrome plating is the thin, decorative &quot;bright chrome&quot;, which is typically a 10-μm layer over an underlying nickel plate. When plating on iron or steel, an underlying plating of copper allows the nickel to adhere. The pores (tiny holes) in the nickel and chromium layers work to alleviate stress caused by thermal expansion mismatch but also hurt the corrosion resistance of the coating. Corrosion resistance relies on what is called the passivation layer, which is determined by the chemical composition and processing, and is damaged by cracks and pores. In a special case, micropores can help distribute the electrochemical potential that accelerates galvanic corrosion between the layers of nickel and chromium. Depending on the application, coatings of different thicknesses will require different balances of the aforementioned properties. Thin, bright chrome imparts a mirror-like finish to items such as metal furniture frames and automotive trim. Thicker deposits, up to 1000 μm, are called &quot;hard chrome&quot; and are used in industrial equipment to reduce friction and wear.

The traditional solution used for industrial hard chrome plating is made up of about 250 g/L of CrO3 and about 2.5 g/L of SO4−. In solution, the chrome exists as chromic acid, known as hexavalent chromium. A high current is used, in part to stabilize a thin layer of chromium(+2) at the surface of the plated work. Acid chrome has poor throwing power, fine details or holes are further away and receive less current resulting in poor plating.

===Zinc plating ===
Zinc coatings prevent oxidation of the protected metal by forming a barrier and by acting as a sacrificial anode if this barrier is damaged. Zinc oxide is a fine white dust that (in contrast to iron oxide) does not cause a breakdown of the substrate&#x27;s surface integrity as it is formed. Indeed, the zinc oxide, if undisturbed, can act as a barrier to further oxidation, in a way similar to the protection afforded to aluminum and stainless steels by their oxide layers. The majority of hardware parts are zinc-plated, rather than cadmium-plated.

===Zinc-nickel plating===

Zinc-nickel plating is one of the best corrosion resistant finishes available offering over 5 times the protection of conventional zinc plating and up to 1,500 hours of neutral salt spray test performance. This plating is a combination of a high-nickel zinc-nickel alloy (10–15% nickel) and some variation of chromate. The most common mixed chromates include hexavalent iridescent, trivalent or black trivalent chromate. Used to protect steel, cast iron, brass, copper, and other materials, this acidic plating is an environmentally safe option. Hexavalent chromate has been classified as a human carcinogen by the EPA and OSHA.

===Tin plating===
The tin-plating process is used extensively to protect both ferrous and nonferrous surfaces. Tin is a useful metal for the food processing industry since it is non-toxic, ductile and corrosion resistant. The excellent ductility of tin allows a tin coated base metal sheet to be formed into a variety of shapes without damage to the surface tin layer. It provides sacrificial protection for copper, nickel and other non-ferrous metals, but not for steel.

Tin is also widely used in the electronics industry because of its ability to protect the base metal from oxidation thus preserving its solderability. In electronic applications, 3% to 7% lead may be added to improve solderability and to prevent the growth of metallic &quot;whiskers&quot; in compression stressed deposits, which would otherwise cause electrical shorting. However, RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) regulations enacted beginning in 2006 require that no lead be added intentionally and that the maximum percentage not exceed 1%. Some exemptions have been issued to RoHS requirements in critical electronics applications due to failures which are known to have occurred as a result of tin whisker formation.

===Alloy plating===
In some cases, it is desirable to co-deposit two or more metals resulting in an electroplated alloy deposit. Depending on the alloy system, an electroplated alloy may be solid solution strengthened or precipitation hardened by heat treatment to improve the plating&#x27;s physical and chemical properties. Nickel-Cobalt is a common electroplated alloy.

===Composite plating===
Metal matrix composite plating can be manufactured when a substrate is plated in a bath containing a suspension of ceramic particles. Careful selection of the size and composition of the particles can fine-tune the deposit for wear resistance, high temperature performance, or mechanical strength. Tungsten carbide, silicon carbide, chromium carbide, and aluminum oxide (alumina) are commonly used in composite electroplating.

===Cadmium plating===
Cadmium plating is under scrutiny because of the environmental toxicity of the cadmium metal. Cadmium plating is widely used in some applications in the aerospace, military, and aviation fields. However, it is being phased out due to its toxicity. Military and Aerospace components manufacturers, such as Amphenol Aerospace, have recently been exploring drop-in electroplating replacements for use with currently fielded equipment in order to support the phaseout of the dangerous finish.

Cadmium plating (or &quot;cad. plating&quot;) offers a long list of technical advantages such as excellent corrosion resistance even at relatively low thickness and in salt atmospheres, softness and malleability, freedom from sticky and/or bulky corrosion products, galvanic compatibility with aluminum, freedom from stick-slip thus allowing reliable torquing of plated threads, can be dyed to many colors and clear, has good lubricity and solderability, and works well either as a final finish or as a paint base.

If environmental concerns matter, in most aspects cadmium plating can be directly replaced with gold plating as it shares most of the material properties, but gold is more expensive and cannot serve as a paint base.

===Nickel plating===
Nickel is electroplated by using a Watts bath, an electrolytic cell having a nickel anode and electrolyte containing nickel sulfate, nickel chloride, and boric acid. Other nickel salts such as nickel ammonium sulfate are sometimes used instead of nickel sulfate.

===Electroless nickel plating===

Electroless nickel plating, also known as &quot;enickel&quot; and &quot;NiP&quot;, offers many advantages: uniform layer thickness over most complicated surfaces, direct plating of ferrous metals (steel), superior wear and corrosion resistance compared to electroplated nickel or chrome. Much of the chrome plating done in aerospace industry can be replaced with electroless nickel plating, again environmental costs, costs of hexavalent chromium waste disposal and notorious tendency of uneven current distribution favor electroless nickel plating.

Electroless nickel plating is self-catalyzing process, the resultant nickel layer is NiP compound, with 7–11% phosphorus content. Properties of the resultant layer hardness and wear resistance are greatly altered with bath composition and deposition temperature, which should be regulated with 1 °C precision, typically at 91 °C.

During bath circulation, any particles in it will become also nickel-plated; this effect is used to advantage in processes which deposit plating with particles like silicon carbide (SiC) or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). While superior compared to many other plating processes, it is expensive because the process is complex. Moreover, the process is lengthy even for thin layers. When only corrosion resistance or surface treatment is of concern, very strict bath composition and temperature control is not required and the process is used for plating many tons in one bath at once.

Electroless nickel plating layers are known to provide extreme surface adhesion when plated properly. Electroless nickel plating is non-magnetic and amorphous. Electroless nickel plating layers are not easily solderable, nor do they seize with other metals or another electroless nickel-plated workpiece under pressure. This effect benefits electroless nickel-plated screws made out of malleable materials like titanium. Electrical resistance is higher compared to pure metal plating.

===Aluminum plating===

&quot;Aluminum plating&quot; can refer to either plating on aluminum or the plating of aluminum on other materials.

<text>The Ardre image stones are a collection of ten rune and image stones, dated to the 8th to 11th centuries, that were discovered at Ardre Church, in Ardre, Gotland, Sweden. The principal edition is by Sune Lindqvist.

==Description==
The Ardre image stones were re-used as paving under the wooden floors of the local church in the Ardre parish of Gotland. Before the historical significance of rune and image stones was understood or appreciated, they were often used as materials in the construction of roads, bridges, and buildings. The image stones were re-discovered when the church was being restored around 1900. The stones are now preserved in the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm.
===Ardre VIII===
The largest and most noted of the stones is the Ardre VIII stone, dated to the 8th or 9th century, depicts scenes from Norse mythology, notably the Lay of Weyland the smith, Thor fishing for Jörmungandr, the punishment of Loki for the death of Baldr, and Odin riding to Valhalla on Sleipnir. Other images on this stone, such as the woman on the right with two swords, are not currently understood as they do not conform to any known Norse myth that has survived to the present time. The image-stone&#x27;s longboat motif with its mariners somewhat resembles a depiction found on the Överhogdal tapestry No. III from Härjedalen. The main study of this stone is by Ludwig Buisson.

===Ardre III===

The inscription on one of the two sides of the Ardre III runestone, which is listed in Rundata as Gotland Runic Inscription 113, consists of twin figure eight serpents with runic text in a band on the edge of the stone, while the second side has a single intertwined serpent with runic text on the edge of the stone. The inscription is classified as probably being in runestone style Pr3. The runic text, which is signed by a runemaster with the normalized name of Likraiv, indicates that it was raised as a memorial with different sponsors for the inscriptions on each side of the stone.

<text>In physics, specifically classical mechanics, the three-body problem is to take the initial positions and velocities (or momenta) of three point masses that orbit each other in space and calculate their subsequent trajectories using Newton&#x27;s laws of motion and Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation. 

Unlike the two-body problem, the three-body problem has no general closed-form solution, meaning there is no equation that always solves it. When three bodies orbit each other, the resulting dynamical system is chaotic for most initial conditions. Because there are no solvable equations for most three-body systems, the only way to predict the motions of the bodies is to estimate them using numerical methods. 

The three-body problem is a special case of the -body problem. Historically, the first specific three-body problem to receive extended study was the one involving the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun. In an extended modern sense, a three-body problem is any problem in classical mechanics or quantum mechanics that models the motion of three particles.

==Mathematical description==
The mathematical statement of the three-body problem can be given in terms of the Newtonian equations of motion for vector positions formula_1 of three gravitationally interacting bodies with masses formula_2:

formula_3

In this case, formula_4 is simply the total energy of the system, gravitational plus kinetic.

===Restricted three-body problem===


In the &quot;restricted three-body problem&quot; formulation, in the description of Barrow-Green,two... bodies revolve around their centre of mass in circular orbits under the influence of their mutual gravitational attraction, and... form a two body system... [whose] motion is known. A third body (generally known as a planetoid), assumed massless with respect to the other two, moves in the plane defined by the two revolving bodies and, while being gravitationally influenced by them, exerts no influence of its own. Per Barrow-Green, &quot;[t]he problem is then to ascertain the motion of the third body.&quot;

That is to say, this two-body motion is taken to consist of circular orbits around the center of mass, and the planetoid is assumed to move in the plane defined by the circular orbits. (That is, it is useful to consider the effective potential.) With respect to a rotating reference frame, the two co-orbiting bodies are stationary, and the third can be stationary as well at the Lagrangian points, or move around them, for instance on a horseshoe orbit. 

The restricted three-body problem is easier to analyze theoretically than the full problem. It is of practical interest as well since it accurately describes many real-world problems, the most important example being the Earth–Moon–Sun system. For these reasons, it has occupied an important role in the historical development of the three-body problem.

Mathematically, the problem is stated as follows. Let formula_5 be the masses of the two massive bodies, with (planar) coordinates formula_6 and formula_7, and let formula_8 be the coordinates of the planetoid. For simplicity, choose units such that the distance between the two massive bodies, as well as the gravitational constant, are both equal to formula_9. Then, the motion of the planetoid is given by: 

formula_10

where formula_11. In this form the equations of motion carry an explicit time dependence through the coordinates formula_12; however, this time dependence can be removed through a transformation to a rotating reference frame, which simplifies any subsequent analysis.

==Solutions==

===General solution===
There is no general closed-form solution to the three-body problem. In other words, it does not have a general solution that can be expressed in terms of a finite number of standard mathematical operations. Moreover, the motion of three bodies is generally non-repeating, except in special cases.

However, in 1912 the Finnish mathematician Karl Fritiof Sundman proved that there exists an analytic solution to the three-body problem in the form of a Puiseux series, specifically a power series in terms of powers of . This series converges for all real , except for initial conditions corresponding to zero angular momentum. In practice, the latter restriction is insignificant since initial conditions with zero angular momentum are rare, having Lebesgue measure zero.

An important issue in proving this result is the fact that the radius of convergence for this series is determined by the distance to the nearest singularity. Therefore, it is necessary to study the possible singularities of the three-body problems. As is briefly discussed below, the only singularities in the three-body problem are binary collisions (collisions between two particles at an instant) and triple collisions (collisions between three particles at an instant).

Collisions of any number are somewhat improbable, since it has been shown that they correspond to a set of initial conditions of measure zero. But there is no criterion known to be put on the initial state in order to avoid collisions for the corresponding solution. So Sundman&#x27;s strategy consisted of the following steps:
# Using an appropriate change of variables to continue analyzing the solution beyond the binary collision, in a process known as regularization.
# Proving that triple collisions only occur when the angular momentum vanishes. By restricting the initial data to , he removed all &quot;real&quot; singularities from the transformed equations for the three-body problem.
# Showing that if , then not only can there be no triple collision, but the system is strictly bounded away from a triple collision. This implies, by Cauchy&#x27;s existence theorem for differential equations, that there are no complex singularities in a strip (depending on the value of ) in the complex plane centered around the real axis (related to the Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theorem).
# Find a conformal transformation that maps this strip into the unit disc. For example, if (the new variable after the regularization) and if , then this map is given by formula_13

This finishes the proof of Sundman&#x27;s theorem.

The corresponding series converges extremely slowly. That is, obtaining a value of meaningful precision requires so many terms that this solution is of little practical use. Indeed, in 1930, David Beloriszky calculated that if Sundman&#x27;s series were to be used for astronomical observations, then the computations would involve at least 10 terms.

===Special-case solutions===


In 1767, Leonhard Euler found three families of periodic solutions in which the three masses are collinear at each instant. 

In 1772, Lagrange found a family of solutions in which the three masses form an equilateral triangle at each instant. Together with Euler&#x27;s collinear solutions, these solutions form the central configurations for the three-body problem. These solutions are valid for any mass ratios, and the masses move on Keplerian ellipses. These four families are the only known solutions for which there are explicit analytic formulae. In the special case of the circular restricted three-body problem, these solutions, viewed in a frame rotating with the primaries, become points called Lagrangian points and labeled L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5, with L4 and L5 being symmetric instances of Lagrange&#x27;s solution.

In work summarized in 1892–1899, Henri Poincaré established the existence of an infinite number of periodic solutions to the restricted three-body problem, together with techniques for continuing these solutions into the general three-body problem.

In 1893, Meissel stated what is now called the Pythagorean three-body problem: three masses in the ratio 3:4:5 are placed at rest at the vertices of a 3:4:5 right triangle, with the heaviest body at the right angle and the lightest at the smaller acute angle. Burrau further investigated this problem in 1913. In 1967 Victor Szebehely and C. Frederick Peters established eventual escape of the lightest body for this problem using numerical integration, while at the same time finding a nearby periodic solution.

In the 1970s, Michel Hénon and Roger A. Broucke each found a set of solutions that form part of the same family of solutions: the Broucke–Hénon–Hadjidemetriou family. In this family, the three objects all have the same mass and can exhibit both retrograde and direct forms. In some of Broucke&#x27;s solutions, two of the bodies follow the same path.

In 1993, physicist Cris Moore at the Santa Fe Institute found a zero angular momentum solution with three equal masses moving around a figure-eight shape. In 2000, mathematicians Alain Chenciner and Richard Montgomery proved its formal existence. The solution has been shown numerically to be stable for small perturbations of the mass and orbital parameters, which makes it possible for such orbits to be observed in the physical universe. But it has been argued that this is unlikely since the domain of stability is small. For instance, the probability of a binary–binary scattering event resulting in a figure-8 orbit has been estimated to be a small fraction of a percent.

In 2013, physicists Milovan Šuvakov and Veljko Dmitrašinović at the Institute of Physics in Belgrade discovered 13 new families of solutions for the equal-mass zero-angular-momentum three-body problem.

In 2015, physicist Ana Hudomal discovered 14 new families of solutions for the equal-mass zero-angular-momentum three-body problem.

In 2017, researchers Xiaoming Li and Shijun Liao found 669 new periodic orbits of the equal-mass zero-angular-momentum three-body problem. This was followed in 2018 by an additional 1,223 new solutions for a zero-angular-momentum system of unequal masses.

In 2018, Li and Liao reported 234 solutions to the unequal-mass &quot;free-fall&quot; three-body problem. The free-fall formulation starts with all three bodies at rest. Because of this, the masses in a free-fall configuration do not orbit in a closed &quot;loop&quot;, but travel forward and backward along an open &quot;track&quot;.

In 2023, Ivan Hristov, Radoslava Hristova, Dmitrašinović and Kiyotaka Tanikawa published a search for &quot;periodic free-fall orbits&quot; three-body problem, limited to the equal-mass case, and found 12,409 distinct solutions.

=== Numerical approaches ===
Using a computer, the problem may be solved to arbitrarily high precision using numerical integration. There have been attempts of creating computer programs that numerically solve the three-body problem (and by extension, the n-body problem) involving both electromagnetic and gravitational interactions, and incorporating modern theories of physics such as special relativity. In addition, using the theory of random walks, an approximate probability of different outcomes may be computed.

==History==
The gravitational problem of three bodies in its traditional sense dates in substance from 1687, when Isaac Newton published his &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica,&quot; in which Newton attempted to figure out if any long term stability is possible especially for such a system like that of the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun, after having solved the two-body problem. Guided by major Renaissance astronomers Nicolaus Copernicus, Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler, Newton introduced later generations to the beginning of the gravitational three-body problem. In Proposition 66 of Book 1 of the &quot;Principia&quot;, and its 22 Corollaries, Newton took the first steps in the definition and study of the problem of the movements of three massive bodies subject to their mutually perturbing gravitational attractions. In Propositions 25 to 35 of Book 3, Newton also took the first steps in applying his results of Proposition 66 to the lunar theory, the motion of the Moon under the gravitational influence of Earth and the Sun. Later, this problem was also applied to other planets&#x27; interactions with the Earth and the Sun.

The physical problem was first addressed by Amerigo Vespucci and subsequently by Galileo Galilei, as well as Simon Stevin, but they did not realize what they contributed. Though Galileo determined that the speed of fall of all bodies changes uniformly and in the same way, he did not apply it to planetary motions. Whereas in 1499, Vespucci used knowledge of the position of the Moon to determine his position in Brazil. It became of technical importance in the 1720s, as an accurate solution would be applicable to navigation, specifically for the determination of longitude at sea, solved in practice by John Harrison&#x27;s invention of the marine chronometer. However the accuracy of the lunar theory was low, due to the perturbing effect of the Sun and planets on the motion of the Moon around Earth.

Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert and Alexis Clairaut, who developed a longstanding rivalry, both attempted to analyze the problem in some degree of generality; they submitted their competing first analyses to the Académie Royale des Sciences in 1747. It was in connection with their research, in Paris during the 1740s, that the name &quot;three-body problem&quot; () began to be commonly used. An account published in 1761 by Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert indicates that the name was first used in 1747.

From the end of the 19th century to early 20th century, the approach to solve the three-body problem with the usage of short-range attractive two-body forces was developed by scientists, which offered P. F. Bedaque, H.-W. Hammer and U. van Kolck an idea to renormalize the short-range three-body problem, providing scientists a rare example of a renormalization group limit cycle at the beginning of the 21st century. George William Hill worked on the restricted problem in the late 19th century with an application of motion of Venus and Mercury.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Karl Sundman approached the problem mathematically and systematically by providing a functional theoretical proof to the problem valid for all values of time. It was the first time scientists theoretically solved the three-body problem. However, because there was not a qualitative enough solution of this system, and it was too slow for scientists to practically apply it, this solution still left some issues unresolved. In the 1970s, implication to three-body from two-body forces had been discovered by V. Efimov, which was named the Efimov effect.

In 2017, Shijun Liao and Xiaoming Li applied a new strategy of numerical simulation for chaotic systems called the clean numerical simulation (CNS), with the use of a national supercomputer, to successfully gain 695 families of periodic solutions of the three-body system with equal mass.

In 2019, Breen et al. announced a fast neural network solver for the three-body problem, trained using a numerical integrator.

In September 2023, several possible solutions have been found to the problem according to reports.

==Other problems involving three bodies==

The term &quot;three-body problem&quot; is sometimes used in the more general sense to refer to any physical problem involving the interaction of three bodies.

A quantum-mechanical analogue of the gravitational three-body problem in classical mechanics is the helium atom,
in which a helium nucleus and two electrons interact according to the inverse-square Coulomb interaction. Like the
gravitational three-body problem, the helium atom cannot be solved exactly.

In both classical and quantum mechanics, however, there exist nontrivial interaction laws besides the inverse-square force that do lead to exact analytic three-body solutions. One such model consists of a combination of harmonic attraction and a repulsive inverse-cube force. This model is considered nontrivial since it is associated with a set of nonlinear differential equations containing singularities (compared with, e.g., harmonic interactions alone, which lead to an easily solved system of linear differential equations). In these two respects it is analogous to (insoluble) models having Coulomb interactions, and as a result has been suggested as a tool for intuitively understanding physical systems like the helium atom.

Within the point vortex model, the motion of vortices in a two-dimensional ideal fluid is described by equations of motion that contain only first-order time derivatives. I.e. in contrast to Newtonian mechanics, it is the &quot;velocity&quot; and not the acceleration that is determined by their relative positions. As a consequence, the three-vortex problem is still integrable, while at least four vortices are required to obtain chaotic behavior. One can draw parallels between the motion of a passive tracer particle in the velocity field of three vortices and the restricted three-body problem of Newtonian mechanics.

The gravitational three-body problem has also been studied using general relativity. Physically, a relativistic treatment becomes necessary in systems with very strong gravitational fields, such as near the event horizon of a black hole. However, the relativistic problem is considerably more difficult than in Newtonian mechanics, and sophisticated numerical techniques are required.
Even the full two-body problem (i.e. for arbitrary ratio of masses) does not have a rigorous analytic solution in general relativity.

==-body problem==
The three-body problem is a special case of the -body problem, which describes how objects move under one of the physical forces, such as gravity. These problems have a global analytical solution in the form of a convergent power series, as was proven by Karl F. Sundman for and by Qiudong Wang for (see -body problem for details). However, the Sundman and Wang series converge so slowly that they are useless for practical purposes; therefore, it is currently necessary to approximate solutions by numerical analysis in the form of numerical integration or, for some cases, classical trigonometric series approximations (see -body simulation). Atomic systems, e.g. atoms, ions, and molecules, can be treated in terms of the quantum -body problem. Among classical physical systems, the -body problem usually refers to a galaxy or to a cluster of galaxies; planetary systems, such as stars, planets, and their satellites, can also be treated as -body systems. Some applications are conveniently treated by perturbation theory, in which the system is considered as a two-body problem plus additional forces causing deviations from a hypothetical unperturbed two-body trajectory.

<text>The River Meon () is a chalk stream in Hampshire in the south of England. It rises at East Meon then flows in a generally southerly direction to empty into the Solent at Hill Head near Stubbington. Above Wickham, the river runs through the South Downs National Park.

==Course==
The River Meon rises one mile (1.6 km) south of the village centre of East Meon. It flows due north, then northwest to West Meon, and southwest to Warnford followed by its characteristic, quite straight, south-southwest course, with many tiny wobbles in short stretches. The river descends through the villages of Exton, Corhampton and Meonstoke, Droxford, Wickham, and Titchfield. The river outflows over of estuary through the marshes of the Titchfield Haven National Nature Reserve to enter the Solent through a small harbour at Hill Head. Overall the valley forms the shape of that of a shepherd&#x27;s crook.

==Navigation==
Above the estuary has never been navigable. Titchfield Haven, on the Solent coast was a minor harbour. In the 17th century, the Earl of Southampton caused a sluice (not a canal) to be built (Titchfield Canal) to drain the marshes. The reinstated wetlands form the Titchfield Haven National Nature Reserve.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measures the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

<doc id="1208425" wikidata="Q5674106" url="?curid=1208425" title="Hart Bridge">
<text>The Isaiah David Hart Bridge is a truss bridge that spans the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, Florida. It carries U.S. Route 1 Alternate (US 1 Alt.) and State Road 228 (SR 228). It is named after Isaiah Hart, the founder of Jacksonville and is often referred to as the Hart Bridge. It was designed by Sverdrup &amp; Parcel. The Hart Bridge is one of the longest truss bridges in the world, and has the world&#x27;s third longest main span of any truss bridge.

==History==
The Isaiah David Hart Bridge was completed in 1967 at a cost of $8.83 million. The official name of the bridge is the Isaiah David Hart Bridge after the founder of Jacksonville, Isaiah Hart. The bridge was built on a bond to be paid off with tolls until they were lifted in 1989. The bridge helped relieve congestion from the Mathews Bridge and the Main Street Bridge. In 1999 the Hart Bridge was ranked 19th as one of the longest cantilever bridges in the world.

==Details==
The bridge has traditionally been painted green and is often referred to as &quot;The Green Monster&quot; by locals. Daily traffic averages 52,000 vehicles. The stretch of highway between downtown and Beach Boulevard is known as the Commodore Point Expressway, but more commonly referred to by locals as the Hart Bridge Expressway.

The bridge is a steel cantilever bridge which is a type of continuous truss bridge. The bridge&#x27;s main span is uncommon for a cantilever bridge in that the truss over the main channel tapers upward and the roadway below is suspended from the truss by steel hangers.

<doc id="1208426" wikidata="Q2706246" url="?curid=1208426" title="Gag (BDSM)">
<text>A gag is a device used in sexual bondage and BDSM roleplay. Gags are usually associated with roleplays involving bondage, but that is not necessarily the case. The person who wears the gag is regarded as the submissive partner, while the other is regarded as the dominant one. People may wear gags for a variety of reasons. Some people derive erotic pleasure from a gag, either in a submissive or dominant role. When combined with other physical restraints, the wearing of a gag can increase the wearer&#x27;s sense of helplessness and anxiety level within a BDSM scene by rendering them unable to speak during sexual activity, which some people enjoy.

For some people, gags have connotations of punishment and control, and thus can be used as a form of humiliation. To some, wearing a gag without restraints is still an act of humiliation, as is an open mouth gag. Some fetishists are sexually aroused by the sound gagged people make when they try to speak, or by seeing a person drool uncontrollably.

The type of gag used depends on the tastes of the parties and the type of roleplay scene, what is available at the time, and safety considerations. Some gags are designed to fill the mouth, while others are designed to provide access to the mouth by forcing the mouth open. Gags may be classified as over-the-mouth type, mouth stuffing type or mouth opening type.

When a person is sexually aroused by gags, . One specific gag paraphilia relates to video depictions in which the captor gags the damsel in distress to stop her screaming for help. Some people are sexually aroused by such imagery, even if there is no nudity or sexual act present, or even if the victim is only gagged but not restrained in any way.

== Safety ==
Gagging anybody is very risky, as it involves a substantial risk of asphyxia if the subject&#x27;s nose is blocked while wearing a gag. Using a gag on somebody who is ill or has a common allergy (including sensitivities to cologne or perfume) is also quite dangerous, as most gags make it difficult or impossible to breathe through the mouth. Vomiting and choking also pose a risk, since they further block the airway. A gagged subject should never be left alone.

In practice, no gag is effective enough to silence someone completely without inhibiting breathing. Most gags that prevent the subject from making intelligible speech still permit loud, inarticulate noises to call for help. Thus, a pattern of noises, such as three grunts in rapid succession, is sometimes used as a safeword by BDSM players. It is also common to use an additional non-verbal safety mechanism, such as a solid object held in the hand that can be released by the gagged person to signal distress.

== Types of gag ==
=== Ball ===
A ball gag is usually a rubber or silicone sphere with a strap passing through its diameter. The most common diameter is , but other sizes can be found.

The ball is strapped into the mouth behind the teeth, with the straps going around the head to secure it in place. They are used as a sign of control by the dominant. If the ball is very large, it may be difficult to insert behind the teeth or to remove it. The wearer can still be heard, but it renders their speech completely unintelligible, distorts their facial features, and causes drooling if the wearer attempts to talk.

A wiffle gag is a simple ball gag that replaces the standard solid rubber ball with a light plastic ball similar to the one used for the game of floorball. It is generally safer due to the constant airflow.

=== Bit ===

A bit gag is styled like the bit used in a bridle for a horse, and much of its sexual appeal stems from fetishistic symbolism in pony play.

It consists of a bar that is held in place in the wearer&#x27;s mouth by straps or other devices. Unlike the metal bit that is most common in horse bridles, the bar of a bit gag is usually a soft rubber cylinder. It is not very effective in preventing speech, unless combined with mouth stuffing, although it will make it somewhat more difficult for the wearer to produce coherent speech. Occasionally, reins are attached. Because of the possibility of injury to the lips, the bit gag is not suitable for rough play.

=== Butterfly ===

A butterfly gag is a wing-shaped gag that is usually inflatable by means of a rubber bulb. The central part fits behind the teeth to fill up the mouth, while the wings go between the teeth and the lips. The gag inflates in the shape of a butterfly. This kind of gag is very hard to keep in the wearer; the use of an O-ring in front of the gag strapped to the back of the head will hold the butterfly gag in place.

=== Cleave ===

A more effective variant of the over-the-mouth gag is called the cleave gag. Instead of being tied over the person&#x27;s mouth, the scarf or cloth is pulled between his or her teeth. While such a gag of thin material is not very effective, a thick scarf can be used to hold his or her mouth open. Cleave gags are difficult to remove as they are between the teeth, not over the mouth. When it is applied properly, the gagged person&#x27;s speech is muffled, but not completely silenced.

=== Detective / over-the-mouth (OTM) ===

The detective gag, or over-the-mouth gag (sometimes abbreviated to OTM), is often described in fiction (particularly crime serials) as preventing the subject from speaking through the use of soft materials such as scarves or bandannas. The long scarf or bandanna is pulled over the subject&#x27;s mouth and tied at the back of his/her head. In practice, it does not silence the subject very effectively. Images of OTM gags, usually applied on women, have been prevalent since the film serials of the early 1900s. For this reason, the OTM gag is associated with the typical damsel in distress. OTM gags are often combined with stuff gags to make them more effective in silencing the wearer.

=== Bandit / over-the-nose (OTN) ===

A bandit gag (also known as an over-the-nose or mouth gag) covers the mouth as well as the nose, and is commonly used in Japan and on many cartoons. Without stuffing, it is not very effective.

=== Forniphilic ===
A forniphilic gag is a type of gag that has the primary purpose of objectifying and/or humiliating the wearer. The term &quot;forniphilic&quot; comes from the word &quot;forniphilia&quot;, which is the incorporation of a bound person into furniture or other objects. The gag becomes a mounting point for a tool or other device which allows a slave to perform a task or service for their master or mistress. When employing the gag, the slave&#x27;s hands are usually bound behind them so they have no other option than to control the tool with the gag. In order to provide stability and to allow the slave to control the tool, a muzzle gag with a mouthpiece is commonly used as a base for attaching the tool.

Types of tool or device can include the following:

* A dildo or vibrator
* An ashtray
* A toilet brush
* A feather duster
* A boot or floor brush

Gags employing a dildo or vibrator are readily available from online retailers; ashtray gags are also popular, but to a lesser extent. Other types of forniphilic gags are much more difficult to source.

=== Funnel ===
A funnel gag consists of a funnel with a tube leading from its spout into the mouth, usually with straps to hold the tube in. Such a gag is used to force the bound person to drink a fluid. It is very easy to choke during such forced drinking. People involved with watersports may also find interest in this gag.

=== Hand ===
A hand over the mouth can be used as a gag. When hand gagging someone, a person usually grabs the victim from behind since the victim cannot see this coming. Then, the person firmly places their unfolded hand over the victim&#x27;s closed mouth. Then they may pull the victim into their body for extra leverage and control. Handgags are common and are often associated with damsel-in-distress phenomena.

=== Harness ===

A harness gag encircles the head, with straps generally secured by buckles fastened at the back. Head harnesses are most commonly used to provide points of attachments to secure various kinds of gags, such as ball gags, bit gags, muzzle gags and ring gags; although they also have other uses, such as providing attachment points for other forms of bondage, or may be used simply for their psychological effect. Head harnesses may also function as a gag by themselves, by restricting the ability to open the mouth, or have a mouth cover as an integral part.

Head harnesses, like many other forms of bondage, also have the effect of creating a sense of objectification and erotic helplessness in the wearer, which can be erotic for the wearer, or for those observing them. Many head harnesses are designed with straps that pass in front of the wearer&#x27;s eyes, restricting their vision, and further increasing the sense of objectification and erotic subjection.

=== Inflatable ===
An inflatable gag is usually a rubber balloon which is inflated by a hand valve. Most inflatable gags will not hold in the gagged person&#x27;s mouth well, so the gag is usually paired with a ring gag to keep it in place.

=== Knotted ===
A knotted gag is a blend of the ball and cleave gags. The scarf either has a knot tied in the middle and placed in the gagged person&#x27;s mouth or is an over-the-mouth gag (OTM) placed backward with the knot tied inside the person&#x27;s mouth. The knotted gag is able to soak up the saliva that the ball gag does not and can be easily washed for reuse. Knots can be doubled or tripled to fit the size of the gagged person&#x27;s mouth.

=== Layered ===

This is a term for a series of gags over each other; for example, an over-the-mouth gag (OTM) over a cleave gag. Another piece of cloth could be tied under the gagged person&#x27;s chin in conjunction with an OTM gag.

=== Medical ===

Bondage pornography also depicts the use of medical gags such as the Whitehead and Jennings gag in BDSM contexts. Such gags allow unlimited access to the mouth. They stop coherent speech, but do little to silence a person.

=== Mouth corset ===

A mouth corset is a type of neck corset that covers both the neck and the mouth.

Incorporating a gag into a neck corset presents a few safety issues: should the wearer begin to choke, it is not easy to remove the gag quickly. For this reason, most mouth corsets use a simple muzzle gag that merely covers the mouth and does not force anything into the mouth, thus minimising the risk.

Despite not forcing anything into the mouth, mouth corsets are usually very effective in gagging the victim. This is due to the fact that the chin piece prevents the wearer from opening their mouth and dislodging the gag, and the lacing at the back of the corset holds the gag tightly against the mouth, making a very effective seal. In addition, it compresses the wearer&#x27;s cheeks.

=== Mouthguard ===
This gag has two mouthguards, similar to those worn by football and hockey players. One rests on the lower teeth of the wearer while the other is against the top. Again, like sports mouthguards, these mouthguards can be softened in boiling water to fit to the mouth of the wearer. The mouthguards are attached to a front faceplate, like most plug gags, and straps from the front to the back.

=== Muzzle ===

A muzzle gag works in a similar way as an over-the-mouth gag, only that they are usually made of leather, are fastened around the head with buckles and straps, and cover the lower part of the face. It is so called because it resembles a muzzle used on animals, with a flexible pad which straps over the mouth, and sometimes also around the cheeks and chin. Muzzle gags have a strong psychological effect on some people, because of the association of being restrained in a way generally associated with animals. Restricting movement of the jaw and covering the cheeks can both increase the efficiency of a gag. It is difficult to draw the line between a muzzle gag and a head harness with an attached gag.

Muzzle gags are probably one of the oldest gags and illustrations showing muzzle-like gag devices such as scold&#x27;s bridles have been observed from early colonial times.

A muzzle gag may also have an attached posture collar and may also be fitted with an integrated pecker gag.

=== Pacifier ===
A pacifier, or &#x27;dummy&#x27; is by design a gag without any alteration. It can be used to quiet a victim, and even strapped in place to prevent removal. Pacifiers are orthodontic and designed to be placed in the mouth. They are very comfortable and soft, and remove the violent connotations of a gag. The wearer&#x27;s mouth is essentially being plugged.

=== Panel ===
A panel gag is similar to a muzzle gag, except it lacks a head harness.

=== Pecker ===

A pecker or penis gag is a gag that has a bulge resembling a phallus (erect penis) or a nipple that is placed into the mouth to enable the wearer to suck on it in a manner similar to an adult pacifier. The use of a phallic shape is intended to give it an erotic connotation, but it may be a large knob — similar to a ball gag — or may be inflatable. The pecker gag may be wide and flat and large enough almost to fill the mouth, intended to depress the tongue.

To keep the gag in the mouth, it is usually paired with a ring, muzzle or panel gag attached to a strap that buckles behind the head.

=== Ring ===

A ring gag is similar to a ball gag, except that the ball is replaced by a hollow ring. The ring reduces the risk of choking, and allows access to the mouth. Oral sex may be performed if the ring is big enough.

A ring gag will cause the subject to drool uncontrollably, this often being the purpose of the gag.

=== Rope ===
A rope gag consists of a length of rope wound multiple times through the mouth of the person being gagged – similar to a cleave gag. Soft rope, such as nylon, works well for the comfort of the person being gagged, but rougher rope, such as hemp, will scratch the lips quite a bit. Rope gags can be made into a part of a full-body tie as well, if the person tying the &quot;victim&quot; up uses the same length of rope for the gag as they do for the tie.

=== Spider gag ===

A variation on the ring gag, the spider gag has hooks on the sides so as to keep the wearer from flipping the ring horizontally in their mouth. Unlike the ring gag which can be easily flipped, a spider gag is essentially functional and non-decorative. Generally these gags have interchangeable rings so as to accommodate both the wearers&#x27; mouth and the size of any object that might be inserted through the ring.

=== Stuff ===
A stuff gag is very similar to, and works in the same way as, the ball gag. The person&#x27;s mouth is stuffed with handkerchiefs, scarves, socks, hosiery, panties, day sheers, bandanas or any item rolled into a ball, acting as a stopper. To reduce the chances of choking, the stuff gag is never pushed all the way into the person&#x27;s mouth. Instead, a large part of it hangs out of the mouth, allowing the top to pull it out easily when he/she has to. Sometimes, to further ensure that the gag does not accidentally slip deeper into the person&#x27;s mouth, the top may use a larger gag. It is then secured with a cleave gag, OTM gag or tape gag.

While it works in preventing speech, a person who has been stuff gagged can easily spit it out by pushing it with his/her tongue. However, it is for this reason that the stuff gag is one of the safest gags to use during self bondage, as the person with his/her hands tied can still spit the gag out if he/she feels any kind of discomfort. However, the risks of asphyxiation and choking are still present for someone who is not careful.

For the more extreme application, a stuff gag can be used in conjunction with a tape gag, effectively rendering the partner completely silent. This practice requires greater caution, since the risk of asphyxiation is high.

=== Tape ===

A tape gag involves the use of sticky tape over the lips, sealing the mouth shut. Commonly used types of tape include duct tape, gaffer tape and PVC tape from two to three inches wide. Tape gags are often the simplest of gags to apply. If the wearer blows while the tape is on it makes it easier to remove (as they can chew it off), making it not the most effective gag. To better secure the tape, a long strip of tape can be wrapped around the lower part of the person&#x27;s head. A strip from ear to ear under the jaw restricts jaw movement, making the gag more effective. However, the tape can cause the skin on the lips to be ripped off and it can irritate the lips and cause fever blisters in those who have dormant fever blisters or cold sores. If left on for long, it will cause the wearer pain for the tape to be removed from their mouth. The tape can also rip hair off when wrapped around the head, despite making the gag more difficult to get off. The longer the tape is left on, the harder and more painful it is to later remove from the skin.

The dominant may use tape during a roleplay where a ball gag will be inappropriate; for example, a kidnapper and captive scene that does not immediately lead to sex. Tape gags are commonly used in crime thrillers where the villains wish to prevent the victims from speaking.

While tape gags can be combined with stuff gags for enhanced bondage, it is easy for one to choke on the stuffing inside of the mouth.

=== Tube ===
A tube gag uses a tube instead of a ring. It allows easy breathing, but not much access to the mouth. It is also possible to have a tube through the ball of a ball gag.

<doc id="1208429" wikidata="Q5642030" url="?curid=1208429" title="High Flux Australian Reactor">
<text>The High Flux Australian Reactor (HIFAR) was Australia&#x27;s first nuclear research reactor. It was built at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC) research establishment at , Sydney, New South Wales. The reactor was in operation between 1958 and 2007, when it was decommissioned and replaced with the multi-purpose Open-pool Australian lightwater reactor (OPAL), also in Lucas Heights. Both HIFAR and its successor OPAL have been known simply as the Lucas Heights reactor.

==Background and operation==

Based on the DIDO reactor at Harwell in the UK, HIFAR was cooled and moderated by heavy water (D2O), and the fuel was enriched uranium. There was also a graphite neutron reflector surrounding the core. Like DIDO, its original purpose was nuclear materials testing, using its high neutron flux to give materials intended for use in nuclear power reactors their entire expected lifetime neutron exposure in a relatively short period.

HIFAR was used for research, particularly neutron diffraction experiments, production of neutron transmutation doped (NTD) silicon, and for production of medical and industrial radioisotopes.

HIFAR went critical at 11:15 pm local time on 26 January 1958, and was first run at full power of 10 MW (thermal) in 1960. The initial fuel was highly enriched uranium, but over the years the enrichment level of new fuel was steadily reduced, in line with international trends designed to reduce the danger of diversion of research reactor fuel for weapons programs. HIFAR completed conversion to low enriched uranium fuel (LEU) in 2006.
Of the six DIDO class reactors built including DIDO itself, HIFAR was the last to cease operation. Permanent decommissioning of HIFAR commenced on 30 January 2007 and was expected to be completed by 2025.

In the second half of 2023, a licence application for HIFAR Phase A decommissioning was considered by ARPANSA. Phase A decommissioning means decommissioning of the peripheral plant and equipment associated with the reactor. The Phase B decommissioning, licence to which is to be considered at a later time, means demolition of the reactor containment structure and reactor building, rendering the reactor site a green-field site. The full Phase B decommissioning was expected to be completed by about year 2030.

On 12 August 2006 Open-pool Australian lightwater reactor (OPAL), the 20 MW replacement reactor located on an adjacent site, went critical. OPAL is served by the same complex of research, isotope production and remote handling laboratories. The two reactors ran in parallel for six months while OPAL was being tested. HIFAR was then permanently shut down and OPAL took over HIFAR&#x27;s role of Australia&#x27;s only operating nuclear reactor.

== Engineering heritage award ==
The reactor is listed as a National Engineering Landmark by Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

<doc id="1208431" wikidata="Q1434098" url="?curid=1208431" title="Walnut oil">
<text>Walnut oil is oil extracted from walnuts, &quot;Juglans regia&quot;. The oil contains polyunsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and saturated fats.

==Composition==
According to gas chromatographic and HPLC analysis, virgin walnut oil consists of linoleic acid (60–62%). It also contains many phenolc compounds including γ-tocopherol, tanins, and flavanoids. Several of these exhibit antioxidant properties. According to another source, walnut oil is composed largely of polyunsaturated fatty acids (72% of total fats), particularly alpha-linolenic acid (14%) and linoleic acid (58%), oleic acid (13%), and saturated fats (9%).

Walnuts typically contain high concentrations of phenolics including ellagic acid.
==Culinary use==

Walnut oil is edible and is generally used less than other oils in food preparation, often due to high pricing. It is light-coloured and delicate in flavour and scent, with a nutty quality. Although chefs sometimes use walnut oil for pan-frying, most avoid walnut oil for high-temperature cooking because heating tends to reduce the oil&#x27;s flavour and produce a slight bitterness. Walnut oil is preferred in cold dishes such as salad dressings.

Cold-pressed walnut oil is typically more expensive due to the loss of a higher percentage of the oil. Refined walnut oil is expeller-pressed and saturated with solvent to extract the highest percentage of oil available in the nut meat. The solvents are subsequently eliminated by heating the mixture to around . Both methods produce food-grade culinary oils. Walnut oil, like all nut, seed and vegetable oils can turn rancid.

Over 99% of walnut oil sold in the US is produced in California.

==Artistic use==
Linoleic acid, the major component of walnut oil, is a &quot;drying oil&quot;, which means that in air it polymerizes, forming strong but flexible films, useful in oil paints and varnishes. Walnut oil was one of the most important oils used by Renaissance painters. Its short drying time and lack of yellow tint make it a good oil paint base thinner and brush cleaner.

Some woodworkers favour walnut oil as a finish for implements that will come in contact with food, such as wooden bowls, because of its safety. Rancidity is not an issue because walnut oil dries when applied to wood in a thin coating. People who mix oil and wax to formulate wood finishes value walnut oil as an ingredient because of the edibility of both ingredients. The oil typically is combined with beeswax in a mixture of 1/3 oil to 2/3 beeswax.

<text>Marie Sophie von Clausewitz (born Maria Sophia Gräfin von Brühl; 3 June 1779 – 28 January 1836) was a member of the noble German Brühl family originating in Thuringia. In addition to her career as a patron of the arts in Berlin, she is known for editing and publishing the work of her husband Carl von Clausewitz, especially his military treatise &quot;On War&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Brühl was born in Warsaw, a daughter of Count (1742–1802) by his marriage to Sophie Gomm (1761–1837). Her paternal grandfather was Polish-Saxon statesman Heinrich von Brühl, while her mother was an aunt of the British field marshal William Maynard Gomm. Her parents had named her Maria Sophia, but she was called Marie by her family. She was the oldest child, but many of her siblings died as infants. Therefore, Marie was protective of her sister Fanny, who had survived the smallpox epidemic. When Fanny died in March 1804 due to complications during childbirth, Marie was left to care for the orphaned daughter. Brühl also treated her younger brother Fitz more like a son than her sibling.

Her education began at home under her father&#x27;s guidance. He taught Marie how to write and read in French, and how to compose letters in a manner appropriate for a &quot;lady of high society.&quot; Her mother taught her English, which Marie spoke fluently and later taught to her friends&#x27; children. Marie and Fanny also took lessons in painting, music, and history. It was their mother&#x27;s intention to create &quot;true phenomena&quot; out of her daughters.

She was a talented painter and patron of the arts. She was a close friend of the novelist Bettina von Arnim and her husband Ludwig Achim von Arnim, and of .

At the age of 18, Brühl became a lady-in-waiting to queen dowager Frederika Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt. This position was terminated in February 1805 by the queen dowager&#x27;s death. Later, she became the chief lady-in-waiting to Princess Charlotte, who was only eleven years old at the time. After the death of her husband, Brühl assumed the role of chief lady-in-waiting to Princess Augusta in Berlin. One of her duties was to look after and educate Prince Frederick, who would later be known as Emperor Frederick III.

In 1813, in the closing stages of the Napoleonic Wars, Brühl was a volunteer nurse in a military hospital.

==Years with Carl von Clausewitz==

Brühl met Carl von Clausewitz in December 1803 through their mutual friends, Princess Louise and her husband Prince Antoni Radziwiłł. Their meeting came less than a year after Brühl&#x27;s father&#x27;s unexpected death due to complications from liver disease in July 1802.

The two had a lengthy courtship for various reasons; one being her mother&#x27;s disapproval of the relationship with a man of lesser social standing. Clausewitz had no inheritance and would have to rely solely on his lieutenant&#x27;s pay, which was not enough to support a family. To marry without her mother&#x27;s blessing would not have been legally possible.
Marie, herself, was hesitant to commit to the relationship and had to consider all the circumstances surrounding the courtship. She was in her late twenties when the correspondence began between Carl and herself. This was considered past high society&#x27;s &quot;marrying age.&quot; Yet Brühl was one of the few unmarried women during that time who earned an income on her own. She did not want to lose, what she referred to as, her &quot;inner freedom.&quot;

The two made their relationship official in May 1806. In August 1810, Clausewitz received an important letter from Friedrich Wilhelm that promoted him to the rank of major, and gave him official permission to marry. On 17 December 1810, Brühl married Clausewitz.

The two frequently discussed politics, literature, current events together. They considered each other equals, which was rare for a man to think of regarding his own wife.

Carl and Marie were unable to conceive children. Present day theories point to Carl&#x27;s chronic illness as the culprit.

The two were married for a total of 21 years, up until Clausewitz&#x27;s death.

From 1832 to 1834, following Clausewitz&#x27;s unexpected death from cholera in 1831, she edited and published several of his books, including his most famous one, &quot;On War&quot;. Throughout their correspondence, Marie insisted that Carl send her his drafts and notes for safekeeping. He was known to have an unorganized writing process that would often lead to lost papers and unfinished ideas. In fact, when Carl was writing &quot;On War&quot;, Marie acted as the researcher and copywriter for the book. Marie&#x27;s handwriting can be found on some of the pages of the &quot;On War&quot; manuscript, listing notes and references. Additionally, Brühl wrote a preface to &quot;On War&quot;. In the summer of 1832, less than a year after Carl&#x27;s death, a publishing house in Berlin had put out announcements advertising the upcoming publication of &quot;On War&quot;. With the help of her brother, Marie transcribed drafts and inserted changes for &quot;On War&quot; in a manner of months.

==Later years and death==
Toward the end of her life, Brühl complained of tightness in her chest and ringing in her ears. She lived a busy life with an irregular and hectic schedule. Along with her responsibilities as chief lady-in-waiting, von Brühl also put pressure on herself to publish her deceased husband&#x27;s works. Those around her were concerned about her health, mood swings, and frequent restlessness. Marie suffered a psychological breakdown after an intense fight with her mother.

After the episode, doctors prescribed various treatments and medications including, &quot;bloodletting, laxatives, and nauseant.&quot; These seemed to be making Marie sicker and less lucid; she sometimes even spoke of herself in the third person. Her cousin Carl von Brühl insisted on moving her to Dresden to salvage what was left of her health. According to one of her nurses, Marie&#x27;s arm seemed to have become infected due to the practice of bloodletting. She may have also contracted hepatitis from the bloodletting instruments. Due to the lack of knowledge about modern medicine and infections, the doctor in Dresden simply diagnosed Marie with damaged nerves and ceased treatment. Brühl died on January 28, 1836, at the age of 56.

==Legacy==
Her portrait of Prussian Field marshal August Neidhardt von Gneisenau is in the collection of Deutsches Historisches Museum.

&quot;Marie von Clausewitz: The Woman Behind the Making of On War&quot; is a biography on Marie von Brühl, written by journalist and military historian Vanya Eftimova Bellinger.

<text>Henry Eliot Howard (13 November 1873 – 26 December 1940) was an English amateur ornithologist, noted for being one of the first to describe territoriality behaviours in birds in a detailed manner. His ideas on territoriality were influential in the work of Max Nicholson.

== Biography ==
Henry Eliot Howard was born at Stone House, at Stone, near Kidderminster, second son of Henry Howard and Alice Gertrude Thomson. He studied at Stoke Poges, Eton, and Mason College (the forerunner of the University of Birmingham). He entered his father&#x27;s steelworks firm, Lloyd and Lloyd in Worcester, becoming a director in 1896. Then in 1903 a director of the enlarged firm, Stewarts &amp; Lloyds.

He showed from his earliest childhood an intense love of natural history. It was not until 1914 that his first work, &quot;British Warblers&quot;, illustrated by Henrik Grönvold, was fully published, having been issued in parts since 1907. Continually working on the theory of territory, he published &quot;Territory in Bird Life&quot;, illustrated by George Edward Lodge and Henrik Grönvold, in 1920 (a reissue in 1948 had an introduction by Julian Huxley and James Fisher), followed by &quot;An Introduction to the Study of Bird Behaviour&quot;, &quot;Nature of a Bird&#x27;s World&quot; and lastly &quot;A Waterhen&#x27;s Worlds&quot;, in 1940. His books were published under the name &quot;Eliot Howard&quot;.

He was a Justice of the Peace and for forty-five years a member of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union, including a period as a vice-president.

His home was always in Worcestershire. In 1900 he still gave his address as Stone House, but once married he and his wife lived at &#x27;Clareland&#x27;, Hartlebury, which overlooked the River Severn, and in whose grounds he conducted much of his ornithological research Nonetheless, much of his time was spent on the wild coast of Donegal and in the north west of Ireland, shooting, fishing and studying natural history. He was attracted to the wild and beautiful area of Horn Head in the North West of Donegal, close to the Atlantic Ocean, through his marriage in 1900 to Anne Elizabeth Frances Stewart (1875–1960) whose family had lived there for many years (the 1901 census of Ireland shows his wife was born in Donegal). He died of meningitis at Clareland on 26 December 1940 and was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Bishops Green, Stourport, on 30 December. An obituary was published in &quot;The Times&quot; on 28 December.

His papers are in the Alexander Library, at the University of Oxford.

His father, Henry was a manufacturing chemist and was son of John Eliot Howard. John&#x27;s father was Luke Howard. The 1901 Census shows Henry Eliot as an &#x27;Iron tube manufacturer&#x27;.

The Howards had two sons and four daughters. One daughter, Esme Eleanor Howard, married the Reverend John William Fletcher Boughey, son of the Reverend Percy Fletcher Boughey and Elsie de Strange Herring, on 25 April 1940.

<doc id="1208439" wikidata="Q5871429" url="?curid=1208439" title="Hit Parade (Spirit of the West album)">
<text>Hit Parade is the second compilation album by Canadian folk rock group Spirit of the West, released on September 14, 1999 by Warner Music Canada.

The album is a compilation, and marked their final release for Warner Music Canada. Despite the album&#x27;s title, not all of the songs on the album were released as singles, and some songs which were notable singles (&quot;Tell Me What I Think&quot;, &quot;Slow Learner&quot;) are not present. The songs are presented roughly in reverse chronological order, except for &quot;And if Venice is Sinking&quot;. That song appears on the album alongside songs from 1990&#x27;s &quot;Save This House&quot;, but was originally released on 1993&#x27;s &quot;Faithlift&quot;.

As with most of the band&#x27;s live shows during this era, the studio portion of the album opens with &quot;Canadian Skye&quot; (from 1997&#x27;s &quot;Weights and Measures&quot;) and closes with the band&#x27;s most famous song, &quot;Home for a Rest&quot; (from &quot;Save This House&quot;).

At the end of the album, four songs appear which were recorded with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra during the sessions for the album &quot;Open Heart Symphony&quot;. Those sessions included new songs and performances of several of the band&#x27;s past hits, but only the new songs appeared on the original album.

The performances which appear on &quot;Hit Parade&quot; collect the hits portion of those shows, along with a rendition of &quot;That&#x27;s Amore&quot; sung by Vince Ditrich. The band had long maintained a tradition of having Ditrich, the band&#x27;s drummer, croon an old pop song — usually &quot;That&#x27;s Amore&quot;, but occasionally &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Set the World on Fire&quot; — at some point during its live shows, but the rendition appearing here is Ditrich&#x27;s only lead vocal performance on a Spirit of the West album.

Following this release, the band went on hiatus for several years, returning in 2004 with &quot;Star Trails&quot;.

<doc id="1208444" wikidata="Q2677972" url="?curid=1208444" title="Beaulieu River">
<text>The Beaulieu River ( ), formerly known as the River Exe, is a small river draining much of the central New Forest in Hampshire, southern England. The river has many small upper branches and its farthest source is from its -long tidal estuary. Unusually, the river, including its bed, is owned by Lord Montagu of Beaulieu.

== Etymology ==
The current name, Beaulieu is French, meaning &quot;beautiful place&quot;. The original name, Exe, is Brythonic, deriving from the Ancient British word *&quot;Iska&quot; meaning &quot;fishes&quot; or &quot;fish-place&quot; and cognate with the modern Welsh word &quot;Pysg&quot; (fishes).This derivation applies to many similarly named rivers throughout Britain including the Axe, Exe and Usk, with the names evolving local distinctions over the centuries.

==Course==
The Beaulieu River rises near Lyndhurst in the centre of the New Forest, a zone where copses and scattered trees interrupt the relatively neutral sandy heath soil, however with insufficient organic uneroded deposition over millennia to prevent an upper charismatic dendritic drainage basin of many very small streams. This explains the multitude of tiny headwaters across the New Forest. Many coalesce into the flow southeast and then south across the forest heaths to the village of Beaulieu. There the river becomes tidal and once drove a tide mill in the village. The mill ceased operations in 1942. Below, the tidal river (estuary) continues to flow south-east through the Forest, passing the hamlet of Bucklers Hard and entering the Solent at Needs Ore. For its final kilometre, it is separated from The Solent by a raised salt marsh known as Gull Island.

Below Beaulieu village the river is navigable to small craft. Bucklers Hard was once a significant shipbuilding centre, building many wooden sailing ships, both merchant and naval, including Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Agamemnon&quot;. Since 2000 the navigable channel at the entrance to the river has been marked by a lighthouse known as the Millennium Lighthouse or the Beaulieu River Beacon.

==Tributaries==
The river has two main tributaries, the Beaulieu Abbey Stream to the left and the Hatchet Stream to the right. In addition there are a series of artificial lakes near the mouth of the river, known as the Black Lagoons.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measures the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the Beaulieu River was as follows in 2019:
==Film appearances==
The river was used as a backdrop for some scenes of the 1966 film &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; – the tree-lined waters were used to portray the 16th century River Thames.

<text>Thalia Assuras is a Canadian television journalist and media consultant.

== Early years ==
Assuras was born in London, Ontario to parents who immigrated from Tripoli, Greece, after World War II. She attended London Central Secondary School, and remained in London to attend the University of Western Ontario, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree. She graduated in 1980, then entered the graduate program in journalism and earned her master&#x27;s degree in 1981.

Twenty-one years later she commented on the impact the journalism program had had on her:
:&quot;It&#x27;s hard to describe my time at Western because it was a phenomenal turning point in my life. I always had these delusions of being a writer and I always overloaded my mind with information and literature. That program just brought things together for me.&quot;

== Career ==
Assuras has worked for CITY-TV and Global Television, including a stint as reporter and weekend anchor for City&quot;Pulse&quot; from 1985 to 1988. She was the evening anchor at Global TV in 1989. From 1992 to 1993 she worked for CTV, anchoring Canada AM. She then moved to ABC, and in May 1993, joined Aaron Brown as co-anchor of &quot;World News Now&quot; and &quot;ABC World News This Morning&quot;. She shared that anchor desk with Boyd Matson, fellow Canadian Kevin Newman, and Mark Mullen before leaving ABC in January 1997.

In 1997 she moved to CBS, first joining CBS Eye on People, a cable network that CBS launched in March 1997. She also worked as a national correspondent and later became anchor of the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; in 1998. She then become co-anchor of &quot;The Saturday Early Show&quot; in 1999 and the &quot;CBS Evening News Saturday&quot;, also in 1999, alternating with Russ Mitchell. In a June 22, 1998 article in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, Assuras commented on her reason for moving to the United States, saying &quot;I wanted to live in a different country. And I wanted to work where you have all the tools you need on a story.&quot; In July 2009, Assuras left CBS after her contract with it expired.

She later anchored &quot;energyNOW!&quot;, a half-hour weekly TV news-magazine and opinion program produced by the American Clean Skies Foundation; it aired first on WJLA-TV and later on Bloomberg Television. After &quot;energyNOW!&quot;, she established a &quot;consulting practice for strategic planning, media relations, crisis management, media training and executive coaching.&quot;

== Awards and activities ==
Assuras is a founding member of The Next Generation Initiative, a leadership program aimed at getting students involved in public affairs.

The Daughters of Penelope recognized Assuras with the &quot;2000 Salute to Women&quot; award. She was awarded the Marie Torre Memorial Award in 2001.

<text>The Codex Amiatinus (also known as the Jarrow Codex) is considered the best-preserved manuscript of the Latin Vulgate version of the Christian Bible. It was produced around 700 in the northeast of England, at the Benedictine Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey in the Kingdom of Northumbria, now South Tyneside. It was one of three giant single-volume Bibles then made at Monkwearmouth–Jarrow, and is the earliest complete one-volume Latin Bible to survive, only the León palimpsest being older. It is the oldest Bible where all the biblical canon present what would be their Vulgate texts. In 716 it was taken to Italy as a gift for Pope Gregory II.

It is named after the location in which it was found in modern times, Monte Amiata in Tuscany, at the Abbazia di San Salvatore and is now kept at Florence in the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana (Laurentian Library).

Designated by siglum A, it is commonly considered to provide the most reliable surviving representation of Jerome&#x27;s Vulgate text for the books of the New Testament, and most of the Old Testament. As was standard in all Vulgate Bibles until the ninth century, the &quot;Book of Baruch&quot; is absent as is the &quot;Letter of Jeremiah&quot;, the text of the Book of Lamentations following the end of &quot;Jeremiah&quot; without a break. Ezra–Nehemiah is presented as a single book, the texts of the canonical Book of Ezra and Book of Nehemiah being continuous. Similarly the books of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles are each presented as a single book.

==Description==

The symbol for it is written am or A (Wordsworth). It is preserved in an immense tome, measuring high, in breadth, and thick, and weighs over – so impressive, as biblical scholar Fenton J. A. Hort says, as to fill the beholder with a feeling akin to awe.

The &quot;Book of Psalms&quot; is provided in Jerome&#x27;s third version, translated from the Hebrew, rather than in the pre-Jerome Roman Psalter then standard in English bibles, or in Jerome&#x27;s second, Gallican version, that was to supplant his Hebraic Psalms in most Vulgate bibles from the 9th century onwards. By contrast with most of the Old Testament, the Amiatinus psalms text is commonly considered an inferior witness to Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Versio iuxta Hebraicum&quot; (&quot;Translation according to the Hebrew&quot;); the presence of the &#x27;Columba&#x27; series of psalm headings, also found in the Cathach of St. Columba, demonstrates that an Irish psalter must have been its source; but the text differs in many places from the best Irish manuscripts. The New Testament is preceded by the Letter of Jerome to Pope Damasus, and the Prolegomena to the four Gospels.

The Codex Amiatinus qualifies as an illuminated manuscript as it has some decoration including two full-page miniatures, but these show little sign of the usual insular style of Northumbrian art and are clearly copied from Late Antique originals. It contains 1,040 leaves of strong, smooth vellum, fresh-looking today despite their great antiquity, arranged in quires of four sheets, or quaternions. As noted by scholar Christopher de Hamel, &quot;[t]he 1030 leaves of the Codex Amitianus would have utilized the skins of 515 cattle.&quot; The script is written in uncial characters, large, clear, and regular, two columns to a page, and 43 or 44 lines to a column. A little space is often left between words, but the writing is in general continuous. The text is divided into sections, which in the Gospels correspond closely to the Ammonian Sections. There are no marks of punctuation, but the skilled reader was guided into the sense by stichometric, or verse-like, arrangement into cola and commata, which correspond roughly to the principal and dependent clauses of a sentence. From this manner of writing the script is believed to have been modeled upon the Codex Grandior of Cassiodorus, but it may go back, perhaps, even to St. Jerome.

==History==

Three copies of the Bible were originally commissioned by Abbot Ceolfrith in 692. This date has been established as the double monastery of Monkwearmouth–Jarrow secured a grant of additional land to raise the 2000 head of cattle needed to produce the vellum. Bede was most likely involved in the compilation. De Hamel suggests that the pandects were prepared, possibly partly inscribed, and potentially corrected in a few places by Bede himself. Bede&#x27;s handwriting may be present. In 716, Ceolfrid accompanied one copy, the Codex Amiatinus, intended as a gift to Pope Gregory II, but he died en route to Rome on 29 September 716 at Langres, Burgundy. The book later appears in the ninth century in Abbazia di San Salvatore, Monte Amiata, in the March of Tuscany (hence the description &quot;Amiatinus&quot;), where it is recorded in a list of the Abbey&#x27;s relics dated 1036, describing it as being an Old and New Testament &quot;written in the hand of the blessed Pope Gregory&quot;. It remained in the San Salvatore Monastery until 1786 when it passed to the Laurentian Library in Florence.

The dedication page had been altered and the principal librarian to the Laurentian, Angelo Maria Bandini suggested that the author was Servandus, a follower of St. Benedict, and that it had been produced at Monte Cassino around the 540s. This claim was accepted for the next hundred years, establishing it as the oldest copy of the Vulgate, but scholars in Germany noted the similarity to 9th-century texts. In 1888, Giovanni Battista de Rossi established that the Codex was related to the Bibles mentioned by Bede. This also established that Amiatinus was related to the Greenleaf Bible fragment in the British Library. Although de Rossi&#x27;s attribution removed 150 years from the age of the Codex, it remains the oldest complete text of the Vulgate.

As the primary source of the Vulgate, the manuscript was of particular importance to the Catholics during the Counter-Reformation. Protestant translations derived from the original language of the Scriptures, but the Latin text of the Amiatinus was earlier than any then-known Hebrew manuscript, making it a &quot;major piece of propaganda in the battle for textual precedence&quot;. In 1587 Pope Sixtus V demanded the book be sent to Rome where it was consulted for a new papal edition of the Bible, the Sixtine Vulgate; although in the event, little or no use was made of its readings in either the Sistine or subsequent Sixto-Clementine official Vulgate editions, whose editors rather preferred later medieval Vulgate texts and editions now known to have been heavily corrupted by non-Vulgate readings.

In view of the many accumulated corruptions in all published editions of the Vulgate so far, the Oxford University Press accepted in 1878 a proposal from classicist John Wordsworth (later Bishop of Salisbury) to produce a new critical edition of the Vulgate New Testament. This was eventually published as &quot;Nouum Testamentum Domini nostri Iesu Christi Latine, secundum editionem sancti Hieronymi&quot; (&quot;The Latin New Testament of our Lord Jesus Christ, according to the version of Saint Jerome&quot;) in three volumes between 1889 and 1954; the Codex Amiatinus being a primary source for the entire text; which also followed this manuscript in presenting the text in sense lines, &quot;cola et commata&quot; without any other indication of punctuation. In 1907 Pope Pius X commissioned the Benedictine monks in Rome to prepare a critical edition of Jerome&#x27;s Vulgate, entitled &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Holy Bible according to the Latin Vulgate Version&quot;), which eventually emerged as a counterpart Old Testament to the Oxford New Testament, following largely the same critical principles, and according similar primary status to the Codex Amiatinus text (other than for the Psalms); and similarly deriving its layout, &quot;cola et commata&quot; from Amiatinus. It is now kept at the Laurentian Library (shelf number Amiatino 1).

== Textual characteristics ==
&quot;Codex Amiatinus Novum Testamentum Latine&quot; (&quot;Codex Amiatinus: Latin New Testament&quot;), prepared by Tischendorf, does not contain the Johannine Comma (1 John 5.7).

<text>A proximate cause is an event which is &quot;closest&quot; to, or immediately responsible for causing, some observed result. This exists in contrast to a higher-level ultimate cause (or distal cause) which is usually thought of as the &quot;real&quot; reason something occurred. 

The concept is used in many fields of research and analysis, including data science and ethology.

* &quot;Example:&quot; Why did the ship sink?
** Proximate cause: Because it was holed beneath the waterline, water entered the hull and the ship became denser than the water which supported it, so it could not stay afloat.
** Ultimate cause: Because the ship hit a rock which tore open the hole in the ship&#x27;s hull.

In most situations, an ultimate cause may itself be a proximate cause in comparison to a further ultimate cause. Hence we can continue the above example as follows:

* &quot;Example:&quot; Why did the ship hit the rock?
** Proximate cause: Because the ship failed to change course to avoid it.
** Ultimate cause: Because the ship was under autopilot and the autopilot&#x27;s data was inaccurate.
** (even stronger): Because the shipwrights made mistakes in the ship&#x27;s construction.
** (stronger yet): Because the scheduling of labor at the shipyard allows for very little rest.
** (in absurdum): Because the shipyard&#x27;s owners have very small profit margins in an ever-shrinking market.

==In biology==
* Ultimate causation explains traits in terms of evolutionary forces acting on them.
:&quot;Example:&quot; female animals often display preferences among male display traits, such as song. An ultimate explanation based on sexual selection states that females who display preferences have more vigorous or more attractive male offspring.
* Proximate causation explains biological function in terms of immediate physiological or environmental factors.
:&quot;Example:&quot; a female animal chooses to mate with a particular male during a mate choice trial. A possible proximate explanation states that one male produced a more intense signal, leading to elevated hormone levels in the female producing copulatory behaviour.

Although the behavior in these two examples is the same, the explanations are based on different sets of factors incorporating evolutionary versus physiological factors.

These can be further divided, for example proximate causes may be given in terms of local muscle movements or in terms of developmental biology (see Tinbergen&#x27;s four questions).

== In philosophy ==

In analytic philosophy, notions of cause adequacy are employed in the causal model. In order to explain the genuine cause of an effect, one would have to satisfy adequacy conditions, which include, among others, the ability to distinguish between:

# Genuine causal relationships and accidents.
# Causes and effects.
# Causes and effects from a common cause.

One famous example of the importance of this is the Duhem–Quine thesis, which demonstrates that it is impossible to test a hypothesis in isolation, because an empirical test of the hypothesis requires one or more background assumptions. One way to solve this issue is to employ contrastive explanations. Several philosophers of science, such as Lipton, argue that contrastive explanations are able to detect genuine causes. An example of a contrastive explanation is a cohort study that includes a control group, where one can determine the cause from observing two otherwise identical samples. This view also circumvents the problem of infinite regression of &quot;why&quot; questions that proximate causes create.

==In sociology==
Sociologists use the related pair of terms &quot;proximal causation&quot; and &quot;distal causation&quot;.

Proximal causation: explanation of human social behaviour by considering the immediate factors, such as symbolic interaction, understanding (Verstehen), and individual milieu that influence that behaviour. Most sociologists recognize that proximal causality is the first type of power humans experience; however, while factors such as family relationships may initially be meaningful, they are not as permanent, underlying, or determining as other factors such as institutions and social networks (Naiman 2008: 5).

Distal causation: explanation of human social behaviour by considering the larger context in which individuals carry out their actions. Proponents of the distal view of power argue that power operates at a more abstract level in the society as a whole (e.g. between economic classes) and that &quot;all of us are affected by both types of power throughout our lives&quot; (ibid). Thus, while individuals occupy roles and statuses relative to each other, it is the social structure and institutions in which these exist that are the ultimate cause of behaviour. A human biography can only be told in relation to the social structure, yet it also must be told in relation to unique individual experiences in order to reveal the complete picture (Mills 1959).

<text>The Russell Street bombing was the 27 March 1986 bombing of the Russell Street Police Headquarters complex in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The explosion killed Angela Rose Taylor, the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty. The materials for the bomb were stolen from Tyrconnel Mine. Several men were arrested for suspected involvement with the bombing. Stanley Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing. Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing, but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, which involved a shootout with police officers in which he and an officer were wounded. He was sentenced to 12 years&#x27; imprisonment.

==Explosion==

The explosion was caused by a car bomb hidden in a stolen 1979 Holden Commodore, bearing Victoria registration plate &quot;AVQ-508&quot;. The explosion caused a massive amount of damage to the police station and surrounding buildings, estimated at more than A$1 million (A$5.36 million in 2025 terms). &quot;The Age&quot; reported that the blast&#x27;s impact was enhanced by the open-floor design of the offices, which had acted like a Claymore mine, sending more shrapnel as the blast ripped through the floors and adding more pressure to the blast as it followed its path. The blast seriously injured 21-year-old Police Constable Angela Rose Taylor, who later died of her wounds on 20 April and became the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty. Twenty-two other people were also injured.
==Investigations==
On 7 October 1985, gelignite and detonators were stolen from the Tyrconnel Mine at Blackwood. On 25 March 1986, a Commodore was stolen. Both crimes were later found to provide equipment needed for the construction of the bomb.

During the earlier stages of the investigation, detectives initially believed that the bombers target was the Melbourne Magistrates&#x27; Court located opposite the Police Headquarters. Prior the Russell Street Bombing, a series of bombings and murders had been committed against a number of Family Court judges in Sydney between June 1980 and April 1985. Detectives initially believed there was a connection, but evidence uncovered during the investigation quickly ruled out links between the Family Court Attack and the Russell Street Bombing.

A week after the bombing, on 4 April 1986, an anonymous caller had contacted Police Commissioner Mick Miller, stating that they had footage of the offenders responsible just before the explosion. The caller then stated they wanted US$500,000 (A$2.8 million in 2025 terms) to be placed in a Swiss bank account in exchange for the footage. The caller contacted Miller&#x27;s office on five separate occasions; each of the calls made was traced to a series of public phone boxes in and around the St. Kilda area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact again, Commissioner Miller and Victoria&#x27;s Premier, John Cain, had made an appeal to the media and offered the caller&#x27;s amount as a reward for information (not in US currency or placed in a Swiss bank account). The caller was later identified as a 38-year-old industrial chemist, Vladimir Rhychta, who was arrested while calling Commissioner Miller&#x27;s office from another public phone box by a St. Kilda detective on 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation after it was found that Rhychta&#x27;s information was false. As a result, Rhychta was convicted and sentenced to two months&#x27; imprisonment.

With Rhychta&#x27;s information proven to be false, the taskforce then received information from a female witness who stated that she saw a male suspect parking a Commodore identical to the bomb car in front of the Russell Street Police HQ at around 12:30 p.m. on the day of the bombing. The witness&#x27;s description was enough to provide detectives with an identikit picture of the suspect; the identikit matched the description of career criminal Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police and at the time of the bombing had a grudge against a detective in the Victoria Police Major Case Squad who worked at Russell Street. Prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail. Crupi had left Melbourne shortly after bombing. In a raid on Crupi&#x27;s home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi&#x27;s kitchen table, making him a prime suspect. Detectives tracked Crupi to Sydney, where he was arrested on 15 April 1986 and brought back to Melbourne. Under police questioning, Crupi denied that he had any involvement in the bombing but admitted that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to be planted at a police station in Flemington.

A major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On 6 March 1986, a Victoria Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red Daimler Sovereign in East Keilor. During the pursuit, the Daimler turned into a side street and crashed. The driver fled on foot into nearby St. Albans where he had stolen another car from a passing motorist at gunpoint and made his escape. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a backpack, containing a set of Victorian number plates that had been cut into pieces. When the pieces were put back together, the number plates, &quot;CCH-997&quot;, came back to a silver 1985 VK Commodore HDT that also had been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in an armed robbery of a bank in Donvale at 4:00 p.m. on the day of the bombing in which the vehicle was used to ram-raid the front of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the Yarra River at Wonga Park on 7 April 1986.

Upon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle&#x27;s VIN on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore&#x27;s VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing. With the silver Commodore&#x27;s number plates recovered from the Daimler, investigators linked both the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.

In a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed. Reed (born Peter Komiazyk) was a suspected armed robber and car thief. As Reed was a person of interest in matters relating to several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed&#x27;s family members (who were also suspected in matters relating to theft of motor vehicles) and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.

One of the addresses under surveillance was a house of an associate on Haros Avenue in Nunawading. Police checks on the house identified the associate as Karl Zelinka. While Zelinka had no criminal background, he was known to Reed, who visited him on multiple occasions.

==Arrests==
On 25 April 1986, ten Victoria Police officers raided the Kallista home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a .455 Smith &amp; Wesson revolver and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, hitting and wounding Reed.

During the search of Reed&#x27;s home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks on the serial numbers similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed&#x27;s home was a police scanner, several stolen number plates and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.

Fingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed&#x27;s home matched to Craig Minogue, and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched Craig Minogue&#x27;s brother, Rodney Minogue. Further investigations had revealed that both Rodney Minogue and Peter Reed had served time in prison together.

Police later raided Zelinka&#x27;s house; evidence recovered from the house matched components used in the construction of the bomb, including:

* a fence post from a neighbouring yard that matched a block of wood found at the Russell Street scene.
* a metal rubbish bin that matched a metal strip used to hold the wired components of the bomb in place.

Under police questioning, Zelinka admitted that he knew Peter Reed through his association with Craig Minogue, Zelinka also admitted that he saw Craig Minogue pulling into the garage of Zelinka&#x27;s home in a Holden Commodore identical to the bomb car. Zelinka also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for Zelinka and his girlfriend to fly to Sydney for the Easter holiday with airline tickets dated the day before the bombing occurred, and the return tickets dated for after the bombing. Zelinka stated that when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney after the bombing, he saw the Minogue brothers filling up a small trailer and was told by Craig Minogue that he and his brother were moving out from Zelinka&#x27;s home. Zelinka then admitted that Craig Minogue had told him to grab the lid of the metal rubbish bin and put it on a pile of rubbish in the trailer. When the detectives asked about the pile in the trailer, Zelinka admitted that the Minogue Brothers took the pile in the trailer to a rubbish tip.

Zelinka then told the detectives that while the Minogue brothers were staying at his home, they were visited on several occasions before the bombing by an associate known to Craig Minogue. Zelinka described the associate as an older male aged in his fifties who was referred to as &quot;Stan the Man&quot;, Zelinka&#x27;s description of &quot;Stan the Man&quot; matched armed robber, Stanley Brian Taylor. 

Born 28 September 1937, Stan Taylor had an extensive criminal record dating back to his childhood in the mid 1940s. Taylor first came attention to the authorities at the age of 8 when he was arrested for truancy and spent two years in the Bayswater Boys Home at The Basin where he was subjected to physical abuse from the other inmates and staff and had been introduced to a life of crime. In 1949, he was arrested again after being caught fishing in a prohibited area. During his early adult years, Taylor had been in and out of jail on criminal charges relating to burglary and motorcycle theft. 

In 1961, Taylor was convicted of an armed robbery of a milk bar in Clayton and was sent to Pentridge and housed in the notorious &quot;H Division&quot; where he met Ronald Ryan. While in &quot;H Division&quot;, Ryan approached Taylor and offered him to take part in Ryan&#x27;s infamous 1965 escape, but Taylor refused. Instead, Taylor and another prisoner escaped from Pentridge. While on the run, Taylor committed seven bank robberies before recaptured five days after escaping from Pentridge. While in prison, Taylor became a model prisoner and took part in several prison stage shows. In 1971, Taylor was interviewed in a television documentary about life inside Pentridge. 

After his release in 1978, Taylor became a social worker to help young men avoid a life of crime. As a bit-part actor, Taylor starred in a 1979 episode of Prisoner.

Detectives arrested Taylor in a pre-dawn raid on his home at Birchip on 30 May 1986. A search of Taylor&#x27;s property only turned up a vehicle that later came back as stolen. Under questioning, Taylor claimed that he had no involvement in the bombing and that he knew Craig and Rodney Minogue through his job as a social worker and that he met them to prevent them from getting involved in any further crimes. He alleged that Craig Minogue, Rodney Minogue and Peter Reed were responsible for the Russell Street Bombing.

Detectives ran a search for Craig and Rodney Minogue and found that they moved into a house within close distance of Taylor&#x27;s home in Birchip. A raid on the house failed to locate the Minogue Brothers but turned up evidence linking them to Russell Street Bombing. At the house, detectives recovered evidence linking the Minogue Brothers to the bombing including:

* A large high-speed engraving machine that matched the drill marks found on both the stolen silver Commodore used in the Donvale bank robbery and on the Commodore used in the bombing.
* Terrier-type dog that matched the hairs found on a travel rug recovered from the bomb car.

Hours after Taylor&#x27;s arrest, detectives had located both Craig and Rodney Minogue at the Motor Inn Motel in Swan Hill. Under police questioning, Both Craig and Rodney Minogue had denied that were involved in the bombing. However, after speaking to their mother, Rodney Minogue later admitted that he and his brother along with Peter Reed and Stan Taylor was responsible for the Russell Street Bombing and had named Taylor as the mastermind behind the bombing. The motive for the bombing seems to have been revenge against the police.

Further police investigations revealed that the Minogue Brothers, Reed and Taylor were known members of an armed robbery crew dubbed the Animals and The Boys Crew. The Animals and The Boys Crew under Stan Taylor had been named in several armed robberies and several thefts of motor vehicles.

==Trial==
Reed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that &quot;the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.&quot;

Prosecutors did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:
* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.
* Gelignite was found at Reed&#x27;s house wrapped in newspaper with Rodney Minogue’s fingerprints on it.
* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.
* A file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.
* A block of wood from which a part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue&#x27;s premises.
* Tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue&#x27;s premises.
* Residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower Templestowe.
* Evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.
* A witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Commodore around the CBD before the explosion.
* Karl Zelinka testified that before the bombing, that he discovered a box of explosives in the garage of the Haros Avenue home.

At the end of a six-month trial in 1988 in the Supreme Court of Victoria before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing. Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing, but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.

Taylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (i.e. never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced. Taylor died in prison at the age of 79. Craig Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years. Although Minogue thus became eligible for parole in 2016, the Victorian Parliament has twice legislated to keep him in prison. Minogue and Reed have both been recently charged with sexual assault offences that allegedly occurred just before the bombing.

== Aftermath ==
In 1995, police headquarters moved to the Victoria Police Centre with the old headquarters many years later redeveloped into an apartment complex. There is a memorial plaque to Angela Rose Taylor on the side of the building. Wylie, who was shot by Reed, later recovered from his wounds, but eventually left the police force; in July 2014, he died by suicide, aged 61.

==Media==
* &quot;Phoenix&quot; – a 1992–1993 13-part Australian police drama television series loosely based on the Russell Street bombing
* The case was covered by &quot;Casefile True Crime Podcast&quot; on 2 and 9 July 2016.
* A dramatisation of the bombing was featured in the &quot;A Step Closer to the Madness&quot; episode of the Australian drama series &quot;The Newsreader&quot;, broadcast on ABC on 5 September 2021. Scenes depicting the bombing were filmed at the actual site.

<doc id="1208463" wikidata="Q7980149" url="?curid=1208463" title="Weights and Measures (Spirit of the West album)">
<text>Weights and Measures is a 1997 album by Spirit of the West. It was their final album of new material for Warner Music Canada.

It was the band&#x27;s first album following the departure of Linda McRae, to whom the final song &quot;The Hammer and the Bell&quot; is dedicated. It was also the band&#x27;s most directly folk-influenced album in many years, as &quot;Canadian Skye&quot;, &quot;Rites of Man&quot;, &quot;Circus&quot; and &quot;The Hammer and the Bell&quot; are all arranged partly around traditional Celtic jigs and reels. This was once one of the band&#x27;s trademarks, but one they had virtually abandoned on their 1990s albums.

The album was recorded in England at Presshouse studios owned by Jethro Tull guitarist Martin Barre. Barre appears on the album as a guest musician, along with Ric Sanders of Fairport Convention, Donald Shaw and Karen Matheson of Capercaillie, and Martin Bell from The Wonder Stuff.

For the album&#x27;s supporting tour, Tobin Frank joined the band as a &quot;special guest&quot;. He retained that billing for several years, but is now officially a member of the band.

Although the album was well received by critics, it was not widely promoted by the label, and sold poorly compared to the band&#x27;s other 1990s efforts. It did not produce any hits for the band, although &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Boy&quot; did receive limited airplay on Canadian radio.

Following this album, Spirit of the West were dropped from their record label. They moved to an independent label for their subsequent albums. Warner released a greatest hits compilation by the band, &quot;Hit Parade&quot;, in 1999, but the band did not release an album of new material until &quot;Star Trails&quot; in 2004.

<doc id="1208464" wikidata="Q1078091" url="?curid=1208464" title="Combine (Half-Life)">
<text>The Combine are a fictional multidimensional alien empire which serve as the primary antagonistic force in the 2004 video game &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; and its subsequent episodes developed and published by Valve Corporation. The Combine consist of organic, synthetic, and heavily mechanized elements. They are encountered throughout &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, &quot;Half-Life 2: Episode One&quot;, and &quot;Half-Life 2: Episode Two&quot;, as well as &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot;, as hostile non-player characters as the player progresses through the games in an effort to overthrow the Combine occupation of Earth.

The Combine are depicted as cruel rulers, suppressing dissent with brutality, using excessive violence to police humanity, and forcibly performing surgery on some to transform them into slaves. Throughout the games, the player primarily battles transformed humans as well as synthetic and mechanical enemies that are the product of Combine technology. In addition to their role within the &quot;Half-Life&quot; series, the Combine have been adapted for machinima productions and other works.
==Design==
Certain elements of the Combine&#x27;s appearance, such as that of the Advisors, are inspired by the works of Frank Herbert. The towering Striders seen throughout &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; and its subsequent episodes are based directly on the Martian tripods of the H. G. Wells novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, where Martians invade Victorian England, using the tripods as their main &quot;weapon&quot;. The name &quot;Combine&quot; itself is a tribute to Ken Kesey&#x27;s novel &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, which features a collection of authorities which mechanistically manipulate and process individuals.

During &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;″s development, various concepts for Combine non-player characters were cut. Female Combine Assassins, similar to black ops Assassins featured in the first game, were planned but later abandoned, although they appear in the &quot;Half-Life 2: Survivor&quot; arcade game. Another non-player character, the Cremator, was conceptualized as a Combine laborer who cleaned the streets of bodies after a battle with a flamethrower. Although removed from the game, its head was featured on a desk in Eli Vance&#x27;s laboratory in Black Mesa East. Other cuts included a variety of alien Combine soldiers that would have complemented the transhuman soldiers in the game and a number of synthetic combat machines. Many of &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;″s Combine characters went through repeated redesigns; the Combine Overwatch soldier was subjected to at least twelve before the final appearance was decided.

Ellen McLain provides the voice for the Combine Overwatch announcer and dispatcher in &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; and its episodic expansions and their virtual reality prequel &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot;. Combine soldiers in &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot; are voiced by actors including Rich Sommer, Isaac C. Singleton Jr., Jason Vande Brake, Michael Schwalbe, Rajia Baroudi, and Rick Zieff.

==Attributes==
===Society===
Little is revealed of the Combine&#x27;s activities outside of Earth, but dialogue in &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; states that they control worlds of various dimensions inhabited by a range of species. The Combine occupation of Earth is shown to be a brutal totalitarian police state. In City 17, an Eastern European city, Civil Protection units routinely conduct searches of apartment blocks, interrogating human citizens, and engaging in wanton police brutality. The military Overwatch forces of the Combine attack human resistance bases in an effort to further solidify their authority in the urban centers. Human citizens are clad in blue uniforms, living in designated apartment blocks and move around to different cities or locales in passenger trains by the Combine&#x27;s will. Vortigaunts, enemy alien creatures from &quot;Half-Life&quot;, have also been enslaved, and are observed in various professions such as janitors. According to &quot;Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar&quot;, the Combine are draining Earth&#x27;s oceans and resources to be used on other Combine worlds.

The heart of the Combine&#x27;s command over Earth in &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; is the Citadel, a large tower constructed by them which reaches both tens of thousands of feet into the sky and deep underground. Located within City 17, the Citadel serves as the Combine’s headquarters on Earth, housing Combine Advisors and the office of Earth&#x27;s administrator, Dr. Wallace Breen. Breen, a puppet ruler, is frequently seen on large screens around the city on which he spreads propaganda and makes announcements. The Citadel projects an energy field that is able to prevent human reproduction, as well as a field that keeps dangerous alien fauna out of the city. In addition, the Citadel contains a trans-dimensional teleporter which allows the Combine to travel between their native universe and Earth.

===Depiction===
The Combine comprises various species and machines. The most commonly encountered enemies throughout &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; and its episodic sequels are the transhuman soldiers and human Civil Protection officers. In addition, a variety of combat machines appear, ranging from APCs and helicopter gunships to a giant &#x27;smart wall&#x27; enclosing occupied cities and gradually destroying anything in its path, as well as a number of weaponized alien &#x27;synths&#x27;.

====Advisors====
Advisors are large larvae-like aliens which are virtually featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, although they do possess an eye-like mechanical device attached to the left side of their heads, and detachable mechanical arms. Their faces are covered by a respirator, which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like orifice from which they can extend a long and flexible proboscis. With this, they can examine objects, or attack and kill other creatures. Advisors appear to be feeding upon their victim during their attacks. It is implied that Advisors are the Combine&#x27;s ruling class, with Breen answering directly to them. Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess psychokinesis with which they are able to float through the air and immobilize other creatures so that their proboscis can examine victims without interference. Their appearance was based on the Guild Navigators from the 1984 film &quot;Dune&quot;.

====Civil Protection====

The Civil Protection is the Combine&#x27;s primary law enforcement agency on Earth, whose ranks are drawn from unmodified, volunteering humans. Commonly referred to as &quot;metrocops&quot; or &quot;CPs&quot;, Civil Protection personnel wear light body armor and face masks which resemble a modified PMK gas mask. They also have voice modifiers, masking their normal voices. They typically carry electroshock batons (named stun-sticks in the game) and pistols, and are occasionally equipped with submachine guns. The Civil Protection are frequently brutal in their methods, keeping the local populace in line via intimidation and violence. Interrogations, inspections, raids, random beatings, summary executions and acts of police brutality are all used as a means of policing their jurisdictions; the Civil Protection&#x27;s methods are justified by their role as &quot;protectors of the civilians″ well-being&quot;. On the outskirts of City 17, the Civil Protection carry out constant patrols for escapees from the city. Civil Protection personnel are in constant contact with the Combine&#x27;s Overwatch headquarters, which issues them objectives and situation updates. Upon the death of Civil Protection personnel, their armor detects that its wearer is no longer alive and automatically informs the Overwatch of the fatality.

====Transhuman forces====

The transhuman forces is the primary Combine military ground force on Earth. It consists of biomechanically enhanced humans who wear heavy body armor and gas masks. They are armed variously with submachine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, and pulse rifles. The markings on their uniforms suggest a difference in specialization. Elite soldiers wear bright white armor with one-eyed helmets and can fire a ball of energy from their pulse rifle, while the rank-and-file wear blue, depending on their role as infantry or a shotgunner respectively. Soldiers wielding shotguns wear similar outfits to other transhuman soldiers but are equipped with uniforms coloured brown and helmets with orange (instead of blue) eyes. Overwatch soldiers typically operate in small groups of four to six using infantry tactics and grenades to flush out and flank the player. They occasionally provide support to Combine synths, and often travel to areas by use of dropships and armoured personnel carriers. Transhuman soldiers utilize two-way radios to communicate with each other and with headquarters. The transhuman forces are usually encountered outside City 17, and only appear in the city near the end of the game. They are commanded by the Overwatch, an unencountered artificial female voice which issues orders such as, &quot;Attention ground units. Mission failure will result in permanent off-world assignment. Code reminder: sacrifice, coagulate, clamp.&quot;

====Combine technology====
The Combine use an arsenal of science fiction technologies. They have access to teleportation technology, which transports them between dimensions. However, their teleporter technology is restrictive in comparison to that developed by Eli Vance, Isaac Kleiner and Judith Mossman in that it cannot be used to teleport to other locations within the same dimension. Throughout the games, various futuristic computer consoles, doors, power sources and weapon emplacements are encountered. In addition, the Combine employ the use of robotic drones called city scanners, to observe the citizens of Earth. They monitor individuals and take photographs, while combat drones called shield scanners are used to drop mines. Civil Protection makes use of smaller drones called manhacks, which are equipped with razor-sharp rotating blades to attack targets with laceration injuries. These are often deployed in closed-in areas. The Combine also use two types of land mines; hopper mines throw themselves into the air and detonate when an enemy is detected nearby, while spherical rollermines roll towards vehicles or enemies, attach themselves and deliver electrical attacks. Combine technology is also used to transform humans into Overwatch soldiers or Stalkers, deformed and mutilated humans with no memory of their past selves who act as slaves and maintenance workers in Combine facilities. Transformation into a Stalker is considered among the Combine&#x27;s worst punishments for dissidents.

Militarily, the Combine make use of both synthetics, creatures augmented with machinery, and traditional machines such as armored personnel carriers and attack helicopters. The most prominent of the synthetic machines are the insect-like gunships; and Striders, armored creatures which walk on three legs and are armed with a high powered cannon and a head-mounted pulse turret. In &quot;Episode Two&quot;, the Hunter, a smaller equivalent to the Strider, is introduced. These tripodal assault machines fire explosive flechettes at targets and are small enough to maneuver indoors. Other synths are seen near the end of the &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, though their roles are not elaborated on. Sentry turrets are also used by the Combine. The Combine often uses headcrabs as a method of bioterrorism against dissidents and refugees, firing artillery shells loaded with the creatures into areas and allowing them to infest said area.

==Appearances==
According to the backstory presented during &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, the Combine appear on Earth after the death of the Nihilanth, the boss character at the end of &quot;Half-Life&quot;. The death of the Nihilanth, a powerful creature controlling the dimensional rip between Xen and the Black Mesa Research Facility on Earth, causes the rip to worsen, resulting in &quot;portal storms&quot; which spread the hostile wildlife of Xen across Earth. The Combine manipulate this tear in the spacetime continuum, widening it to allow access to Earth from their dimension. When sufficiently wide enough, the Combine launched an invasion in force. Earth is rapidly defeated in a war lasting seven hours (the title is a reference to the Soviet military exercise Щит-82; &quot;Seven-Hour Nuclear War&quot;). Earth&#x27;s surrender was negotiated by Dr. Wallace Breen, administrator of the Black Mesa Research Facility at the time of the incident, who discovered a means of communicating with the Combine. Dr. Breen was subsequently made the Combine&#x27;s puppet ruler of Earth, with City 17 as his base of operations.

The Combine&#x27;s first appearance is in &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;. Through the early stages of the game, Combine Civil Protection units pursue Gordon Freeman, the player character, through City 17 after Gordon’s presence is mistakenly revealed to Dr. Breen. Due to Gordon’s actions in &quot;Half-Life&quot; and his subsequent disappearance, which earned him a legendary reputation, Dr. Breen sees Gordon as a significant threat. As Gordon flees the city, Civil Protection units raid the resistance base of Black Mesa East and capture resistance leader Eli Vance, who is transferred to holding facilities at Nova Prospekt. Gordon, along with Eli’s daughter Alyx, breaks into the facility to rescue him, but Eli is teleported to the Combine Citadel by double agent Judith Mossman. The strike against Nova Prospekt prompts a revolution by the citizens of Earth and heavy street fighting takes place.

In &quot;Episode One&quot;, the destruction of the teleporter has isolated Combine forces on Earth, and its primary reactor has begun to melt down. This forces Gordon and Alyx to journey back into the critically damaged Citadel to stabilize its reactor while the city&#x27;s inhabitants are evacuated. The Combine forces, however, instead attempt to accelerate the meltdown in order to contact their native dimension for reinforcements. After Alyx acquires an encrypted copy of the message to be sent, Overwatch forces desperately attempt to stop the pair from escaping the city, spurred on by Combine Advisors. As the pair escape on a train at the end of the game, the Citadel detonates and destroys City 17.

&quot;Episode Two&quot; opens with Alyx and Gordon learning a superportal to the Combine dimension has formed in the Citadel&#x27;s place, progressing to a stage where the Combine can send reinforcements. They also discover that Alyx&#x27;s encrypted data from the Citadel can reverse the portal, and so traverse the countryside to deliver the packet to another resistance headquarters at White Forest. As they progress, Combine Advisors have escaped the Citadel&#x27;s destruction, and remaining Combine forces are regrouping, albeit under attacks by Vortigaunts. Aware of the resistance&#x27;s plans to close the superportal, the Combine attack White Forest in force, but are repelled.

The Combine are again the primary antagonist in the prequel &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot;, taking place between &quot;Half-Life&quot; and &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;. The game focuses on the efforts of Alyx Vance, her father Eli, and fellow resistance member Russell, as they attempt to infiltrate a massive Combine vault, believing it possesses a weapon that they could use to weaken the Combine occupation on Earth. After navigating through various quarantine zones of City 17 and rescuing Eli, they discover that the Vault is constructed not to hold a weapon, but as a prison, which they deduce to be holding Gordon Freeman. Alyx infiltrates the Vault and learns that it does not imprison Freeman, but is instead harboring the mysterious G-Man, who shows Alyx a glimpse of Eli&#x27;s death in the future and offers her a chance to prevent it, which she accepts, before placing her in stasis.

The related &quot;Portal&quot; series hints at the presence of the Combine, with malevolent AI GLaDOS claiming that she is the only thing standing between Chell and &quot;them&quot;.

==Promotion and reception==
The Combine have inspired the creation of several items of merchandise for the &quot;Half-Life&quot; series. A plush toy was created by Valve, based on the synthetic tripod Hunters introduced in &quot;Episode Two&quot;. Sold and distributed via Valve&#x27;s online store, the toy was released in February 2008. In addition, Valve has produced t-shirts depicting the Combine&#x27;s idea of humanity&#x27;s evolution, from ape to Combine Overwatch soldier mirroring The March of Progress, and a lithograph displaying twelve pieces of concept art for the Combine soldier.

The Combine have received a positive reaction from critics. &quot;1UP.com&quot; praised the &quot;epic feel&quot; built up by the Combine and their harsh rule of City 17 in &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, stating that this created &quot;a world governed by newspeak, decorated with urban decay, and lacking any hope&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; echoed this praise, saying that the &quot;vision of a dystopian police state is chillingly effective&quot;. &quot;PC Zone&quot; described the appearance of the Combine&#x27;s soldiers as &quot;Stormtrooper-like&quot;. While stating that overall the artificial intelligence for the game was &quot;extremely competent&quot;, they expressed the opinion that Combine non-player characters &quot;could have used better survival instincts&quot;, citing their reluctance to take cover and tendency to charge at the player and into a shotgun blast&quot;. GameSpot&quot; noted that their AI had been slightly improved in &quot;Episode One&quot;. The addition of the Hunter in &quot;Episode Two&quot; was praised by critics; &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; stated that they were challenging to fight and were &quot;a very welcome addition&quot; to the series, while &quot;IGN&quot; stated that the Hunters were &quot;impressively designed&quot;, &quot;sleek and powerful all at once&quot;, and &quot;reek of malicious alien intelligence&quot;.

In &quot;Playing Dystopia&quot;, the Combine are directly compared with the Party in George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; as a totalitarian regime organized according to an ideology. The book notes that Dr. Breen represents an archetypal father figure who lies that the Combine have created a utopia in order to justify the invasion. His reference to the Combine as &quot;our Benefactors&quot; ties back to the novel &quot;We&quot; by Yevgeny Zamyatin, in which the term is used to describe the ruler of the One State. The Combine also create the image of a utopia through mind manipulation and propaganda, causing humanity to accept a false sense of safety and &quot;womb-like security&quot;. The suppression field deployed by the Combine to prevent new births and destroy the concept of the family was also compared to P. D. James&#x27; &quot;The Children of Men&quot;. &quot;Videogames and Education&quot; calls it a &quot;terrible irony&quot; that, having eliminated children, they positioned themselves as humanity&#x27;s protector and nurturer. &quot;Aliens in Popular Culture&quot; describes the Combine&#x27;s uniforms and architecture as referencing communism and fascism, comparing its overtones to &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;. The Brain Bugs from that novel are specifically noted as being referenced by the appearance and abilities of the Combine Advisors.

===Fan works===

The use of sandbox applications like &quot;Garry&#x27;s Mod&quot; have allowed for Combine non-player characters to be used in a variety of webcomics and machinima productions. In one webcomic, &quot;Concerned&quot;, the Combine are portrayed as a highly bureaucratic and often inept organization. One issue shows a Civil Protection briefing for attempting to capture the comic&#x27;s protagonist Gordon Frohman, in which officers are instructed to cluster around explosive barrels, seek cover on unstable structures and rappel down from bridges in front of fast moving vehicles. In another example, the machinima series &quot;Combine Nation&quot; follows Civil Protection officers in a similar style to police procedural documentaries. The officers perform their duties with various twists, such as the team&#x27;s medical officer having an obsession with adhesive bandages and the legal consultant, an Overwatch soldier, favoring dramatic entries, such as throwing flashbangs, which often backfire on him. Another web series, called &quot;The Combine&quot;, parodies the TV show &quot;The Office&quot;. This series attempts to portray the combine as an intergalactic corporation that suffers from everyday office issues and problems. One episode shows the soldiers attempting to bypass an Internet filter so they can watch videos online instead of working. Other media portray the Combine with more serious overtones, such as the live-action video &quot;The Combine Interview&quot;, which parodies an interview with Tom Cruise discussing Scientology. The video, described by both &quot;Joystiq&quot; and &quot;Kotaku&quot; as &quot;creepy&quot;, instead presents an interview with a Civil Protection officer discussing the Combine&#x27;s rule of Earth, adapting Cruise&#x27;s words to fit the Combine theme. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; UK noted that &quot;the suggestion, of course, is that Scientology&#x27;s purpose or self-image in some way resembles that of the homogenizing intergalactic murderous alien collective&quot;.

<text>Adam Nathaniel Yauch ( ; August 5, 1964 – May 4, 2012), also known by the stage name MCA, was an American rapper, bassist, filmmaker and a founding member of the hip hop group Beastie Boys. Besides his musical work, he also directed many of the band&#x27;s music videos and did much of their promotional photography, often using the pseudonym Nathanial Hörnblowér for such work.

Yauch founded Oscilloscope Laboratories, an independent film production and distribution company based in New York City. As a Buddhist, he was involved in the Tibetan independence movement and organized the Tibetan Freedom Concert. He died in 2012 from parotid cancer, after which Beastie Boys disbanded.

==Early life and education==
Born in Brooklyn, New York City, Yauch was an only child. His father Noel was an architect, and his mother Frances was a social worker. Yauch&#x27;s mother was Jewish and his father Catholic, but he had a non-religious upbringing in Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn.

Yauch attended Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn&#x27;s Midwood neighborhood. In high school, he taught himself to play the bass guitar and formed Beastie Boys from hardcore punk band Young Aborigines, with John Berry, Kate Schellenbach, and Michael Diamond. They played their first show—while still a hardcore punk band in the vein of Reagan Youth—on his 17th birthday. He attended Bard College for two years before dropping out.

==Beastie Boys==
Beastie Boys, a hip-hop trio, released their first album &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot; on Def Jam Records when Yauch was 22. He directed many of Beastie Boys&#x27; music videos, often under the pseudonym Nathanial Hörnblowér.

In 2002, Yauch constructed a recording studio in New York City called Oscilloscope Laboratories. He began an independent film distributing company called Oscilloscope Pictures. He directed the 2006 Beastie Boys concert film &quot;Awesome; I Fuckin&#x27; Shot That!&quot;

Beastie Boys had sold 40 million records worldwide by 2010. In April 2012, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Yauch was inducted &quot;in absentia&quot; due to his illness. His bandmates paid tribute to him; a letter from Yauch was read to the audience.

In 2011, Yauch received the Charles Flint Kellogg Award in Arts and Letters from Bard College, the college he attended for two years. The award is &quot;given in recognition of a significant contribution to the American artistic or literary heritage&quot;.

==Other independent work==

He directed the 2008 film &quot;Gunnin&#x27; For That #1 Spot&quot; about eight high school basketball prospects at the Boost Mobile Elite 24 Hoops Classic at Rucker Park in Harlem, New York City.

Yauch produced &quot;Build a Nation&quot; (2007), the comeback album from hardcore/punk band Bad Brains. When Bad Brains released &quot;Into the Future&quot; (2012), the band dedicated the album to Yauch, their longtime friend and backer, who had died several months previously.

In addition, Oscilloscope Laboratories also distributed Kelly Reichardt&#x27;s &quot;Wendy and Lucy&quot; (2008), Oren Moverman&#x27;s &quot;The Messenger&quot; (2009), and Lynne Ramsay&#x27;s &quot;We Need To Talk About Kevin&quot; (2011).

==Personal life and views==
Yauch was a practicing Buddhist. He became an important voice in the Tibetan independence movement, creating the Milarepa Fund, a nonprofit organization devoted to Tibetan independence and organized several benefit concerts to support the cause, including the Tibetan Freedom Concert.

In 1995, while attending a speech by the Dalai Lama at Harvard University, he met his wife, Tibetan American Dechen Wangdu. They married in 1998 and had a daughter the same year.

In 1998, during the MTV Video Music Awards, when receiving the Video Vanguard Award, Yauch condemned America&#x27;s wars in Muslim countries and prejudice against Muslims and Arabs.

==Illness, death and legacy==

In July 2009, Yauch was diagnosed with a cancerous parotid gland and lymph node. He underwent surgery and radiation therapy, delaying the release of &quot;Hot Sauce Committee Pt. 1&quot; until 2011 (when it was renamed &quot;Hot Sauce Committee Part Two&quot;) and canceling the trio&#x27;s planned tour. He was unable to appear in videos for the album. At the time, Yauch called the cancer &quot;very treatable&quot;.

On May 4, 2012, Yauch died in Manhattan, New York, at age 47. In his last will and testament, he left instructions that his music not be used in advertising, though the legal validity of those instructions has been questioned.

On May 3, 2013, ceremonies were held to rename the Palmetto Playground in Brooklyn Heights Adam Yauch Park.
 Yauch is also the subject of a mural dedicated to his memory at the Beastie Boys&#x27; former studios in LA.

<doc id="1208472" wikidata="Q1579293" url="?curid=1208472" title="Hans E. Kinck">
<text>Hans Ernst Kinck (; 11 October 1865 – 13 October 1926) was a Norwegian author and philologist who wrote novels, short stories, dramas, and essays. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature seven times.

==Life==
Kinck was born in Øksfjord in Loppa Municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. His father, Theodor Kinck (1832–1903), was a local health inspector and his mother, Hanna Guliante Johannesen (1840–1923), was the daughter of a peasant. He studied philology and the classics at King Frederick&#x27;s University, Kristiania (now Oslo). He married a fellow writer, Minda Ramm (1859–1924), in 1893. They had at least two sons, Johan Jørgen Kinck (1873–1955) and Tore. Both Tore Kinck and Minde Ramm wrote memoirs about Kinck &quot;full of biographical detail&quot; after his death.

Kinck died in Oslo, two days after his 61st birthday.

==Works==
Kinck wrote novels, short stories and plays as well as a number of essays on historical and political subjects. He travelled extensively and lived in Italy for long periods. Half of his literary production is related to Italian topics.

He often explores the workings of love and tenderness, and the difference between the mass of humanity and individuals. In his more political works, he warns against fascism, a trend that grows stronger in his later writings. Kinck also wrote about struggling artists, the misunderstandings they met with, and their reactions towards them.

===Plays===
Kinck&#x27;s plays are very lengthy and are often regarded as pieces for reading, not for performing. When played in full, some of his plays last for seven hours or more. They are often closely connected to his essays; expanding on and dramatizing their ideas. His great historical play &quot;Mot Karneval&quot; (Towards Carnival), based on the life of Niccolò Machiavelli is a prime example; also, a play based on the life of Pietro Aretino called &quot;Den Sidste Gjæst/The Last Guest&quot;).

His other Italian pieces are based on stories by Boccaccio, and are rooted in medieval tradition, exploring the ways of love and passion.

Kinck also wrote four &quot;Norwegian&quot; plays, with a contemporary setting. They take place in small western valleys, exploring class warfare and the approach of modernity. His greatest play is generally considered to be &quot;Driftekaren (The Herdsman&quot;, with references to Peer Gynt). It tells of a man who is a &quot;trader and a poet&quot;, and how &quot;humanity grows forth&quot; in him, as Kinck puts it. His last play was a sequel to this, written in 1925.

Many of his plays were performed in the theatre created by Ingeborg Refling Hagen, who was willing to stage even the longest marathon performances; some lasting for ten hours.

===Short stories===
Kinck wrote many collections of short stories, dealing with both Italy and Norway. Here he told of Norwegian farmers and Norwegian tourists in Italy, sometimes from a comical viewpoint. Many of the shorter pieces are still widely popular.

His first collection of stories, &quot;Flaggermusvinger&quot; (Batwings), is a typical symbolist work. He explores the connection between man and nature and the conflict between the forces of nature and the forces of the human mind, especially guilt, passion and fear. Some of the stories are reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe in style. The book is subtitled &quot;Tales From the West&quot;, as all of them are set in Western Norway.

===Novels===
Kinck&#x27;s novels are mostly placed in a Norwegian setting. They typically involve the approach of modernity and the lack of dialogue between farmers and those in power.

===Essays===
Kincks essays are mostly historical. He wrote much on Italian topics, analyzing the renaissance and the approach of fascism. He also wrote about the Mafia. The Norwegian essays analyzed the split between the saga and the medieval ballad, focusing on the changes in the mood and styles of storytelling from pagan to Christian times in Norway.

==Music and film==
Four composers have written music to works by Kinck. Eivind Groven wrote a number of songs based on texts from Kinck&#x27;s plays. His first symphony was inspired by the play &quot;Driftekaren&quot;. Wolfgang Plagge and Ludvig Irgens-Jensen have also composed music based on themes from his novels.

Randall Meyers scored the movie &quot;Flaggermusvinger&quot; (&quot;Batwings&quot;, 1992), which is based on three of Kinck&#x27;s short stories. Kinck was credited as the writer of the 1981 TV play &quot;Når eplene modnes&quot;.

<doc id="1208474" wikidata="Q1347932" url="?curid=1208474" title="Die hard (phrase)">
<text>Die hard is a phrase coined by Lieutenant-Colonel William Inglis of the 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot during the Battle of Albuera. Its original literal meaning has evolved to describe any person who will not be swayed from a belief. The metaphorical sense was first applied almost exclusively to right wing politics, but since the latter half of the 20th century, it has come into general use with wide application.

== Original military use ==
The phrase &quot;die hard&quot; was first used during the Battle of Albuera (1811) in the Peninsular War. During the battle, Lieutenant-Colonel William Inglis of the 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot was wounded by canister shot. Despite his injuries, Inglis refused to retire from the battle but remained with the regimental colours, encouraging his men with the words &quot;Die hard 57th, die hard!&quot; as they came under intense pressure from a French attack. The &#x27;Die Hards&#x27; subsequently became the West Middlesex&#x27;s regimental nickname.

The term was later used to deride several senior officers of the Army who sought to maintain the system bequeathed to them by the Duke of Wellington and who strenuously resisted military reforms enacted by Parliament starting in the late 1860s.

== British political uses ==

In British politics the adjective &quot;die-hard&quot; (best written with a hyphen) was first 
used to describe those who, during the crisis caused by the Lords&#x27; rejection of David Lloyd George&#x27;s &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot; of 1909, refused to accept the diminution of the House of Lords&#x27; powers by the Parliament Act 1911, and who generally held right wing views, most notably Richard Verney, 19th Baron Willoughby de Broke.

It was subsequently used to describe right-wing critics of Lloyd George&#x27;s Coalition Government 1918–1922, several of whom had been die-hards before the War such as Leopold Maxse. There was at this time a &quot;higher proportion of Irishmen in the Diehard group than in the rest of the parliamentary Conservative Party&quot;.

It was later revived to describe a grouping of members of the Conservative Party in the 1930s, including Henry Page Croft who had been prominent among both the earlier die-hards, who amongst other things refused to accept any moves towards Indian independence. But this time it also included some who &quot;did not necessarily share the general views of the right on other matters&quot;, such as Winston Churchill who had been a &quot;bête noire&quot; of the original die-hards. Some of the die-hards, though not Churchill, flirted with Oswald Mosley&#x27;s British Union of Fascists and/or supported Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s policy of appeasement.

== Other usage ==

The term is now commonly used to describe any person who will not be swayed from a belief, and was used as the title of the popular action movie series &quot;Die Hard&quot;, all starring Bruce Willis as police officer John McClane.

<text>Transwave is a French Trance act composed of Christof Drouillet (known as Absolum) and Frédéric Holyszewski (known as Deedrah).

Christof was raised in a classical musician family, though he never had training in music or electronic. First, he got involved in various new wave bands where he was the singer and the programmer. One day, he discovered the Techno music sound, and that changed his musical orientation. Also raised in a family of musicians, Frederic Holyszewski began his musical studies at the age of five, learning Transverse flute and piano. During his teenage years, he found inspiration in the electronic music of the day, including Jean Michel Jarre, Depeche Mode, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Simple Minds. He bought his first synthesizer funded by working at night in bars as a pianist. After the split of his first rock band Vision Quest, in 1990, he started to work on his own with the help of computers.

Christof and Frederic met at a French Rave party and subsequently formed the trance act &quot;Transwave&quot; in September 1994. Three months later, the first Transwave release (Datura EP) was launched on Loren X&#x27;s French label, Transpact. Over the following two years, Transwave released three albums: Hypnorhythm (1995) on Masturi Productions - UK, Helium (1996) on Masturi Productions - UK and Phototropic (1996) on Distance Productions - France, and toured around the world, experiencing great success in the trance underground scene. They scored an international trance hit with their track, &quot;Land of Freedom&quot;. The group split in May 1997. Christophe and Frederic also released an EP called &quot;Anjuna&quot; under the name Kaledoid in 1996.

Transwave is known for its heavy use of TB-303 based effects.

Christof launched his record label 3D Vision Recordings in Paris in 1998, releasing artists as dancefloor oriented as possible, which became one of Trance most demanded labels. Also in 2010, he launched iBZ Recordings, an Ibiza based techno label.

Frederic ventured out and started his own record label and production studio, Questionmark RDS. In 1997, the label released his first solo album Self Oscillation under the name Deedrah which marked Frederic&#x27;s first break from the original psychedelic Goa trance sound he was producing before. Since then, label is closed down, but Dado focused since that on collaborating with his friends Dino &amp; Shanti under the name of Krome Angels.

Transwave reunited to perform again at the Boom Festival 2006 in Portugal and in the beginning of 2007 they released &quot;Backfire&quot;, a compilation of hits and unreleased tracks that have made Transwave. They have chosen the tracks after asking their Fans through forums and internet.

<text>Variational Bayesian methods are a family of techniques for approximating intractable integrals arising in Bayesian inference and machine learning. They are typically used in complex statistical models consisting of observed variables (usually termed &quot;data&quot;) as well as unknown parameters and latent variables, with various sorts of relationships among the three types of random variables, as might be described by a graphical model. As typical in Bayesian inference, the parameters and latent variables are grouped together as &quot;unobserved variables&quot;. Variational Bayesian methods are primarily used for two purposes:
# To provide an analytical approximation to the posterior probability of the unobserved variables, in order to do statistical inference over these variables.
# To derive a lower bound for the marginal likelihood (sometimes called the &quot;evidence&quot;) of the observed data (i.e. the marginal probability of the data given the model, with marginalization performed over unobserved variables). This is typically used for performing model selection, the general idea being that a higher marginal likelihood for a given model indicates a better fit of the data by that model and hence a greater probability that the model in question was the one that generated the data. (See also the Bayes factor article.)

In the former purpose (that of approximating a posterior probability), variational Bayes is an alternative to Monte Carlo sampling methods—particularly, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as Gibbs sampling—for taking a fully Bayesian approach to statistical inference over complex distributions that are difficult to evaluate directly or sample. In particular, whereas Monte Carlo techniques provide a numerical approximation to the exact posterior using a set of samples, variational Bayes provides a locally-optimal, exact analytical solution to an approximation of the posterior.

Variational Bayes can be seen as an extension of the expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm from maximum likelihood (ML) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the single most probable value of each parameter to fully Bayesian estimation which computes (an approximation to) the entire posterior distribution of the parameters and latent variables. As in EM, it finds a set of optimal parameter values, and it has the same alternating structure as does EM, based on a set of interlocked (mutually dependent) equations that cannot be solved analytically.

For many applications, variational Bayes produces solutions of comparable accuracy to Gibbs sampling at greater speed. However, deriving the set of equations used to update the parameters iteratively often requires a large amount of work compared with deriving the comparable Gibbs sampling equations. This is the case even for many models that are conceptually quite simple, as is demonstrated below in the case of a basic non-hierarchical model with only two parameters and no latent variables.

==Mathematical derivation==

===Problem===
In variational inference, the posterior distribution over a set of unobserved variables formula_1 given some data formula_2 is approximated by a so-called variational distribution, formula_3
: formula_4

The distribution formula_5 is restricted to belong to a family of distributions of simpler form than formula_6 (e.g. a family of Gaussian distributions), selected with the intention of making formula_5 similar to the true posterior, formula_6.

The similarity (or dissimilarity) is measured in terms of a dissimilarity function formula_9 and hence inference is performed by selecting the distribution formula_5 that minimizes formula_9.

===KL divergence===
The most common type of variational Bayes uses the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) of &quot;Q&quot; from &quot;P&quot; as the choice of dissimilarity function. This choice makes this minimization tractable. The KL-divergence is defined as

:formula_12

Note that &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;P&quot; are reversed from what one might expect. This use of reversed KL-divergence is conceptually similar to the expectation–maximization algorithm. (Using the KL-divergence in the other way produces the expectation propagation algorithm.)

===Intractability===
Variational techniques are typically used to form an approximation for:

:formula_13

The marginalization over formula_14 to calculate formula_15 in the denominator is typically intractable, because, for example, the search space of formula_14 is combinatorially large. Therefore, we seek an approximation, using formula_17.

===Evidence lower bound===
Given that formula_18, the KL-divergence above can also be written as

:formula_19

Because formula_20 is a constant with respect to formula_14 and formula_22 because formula_5 is a distribution, we have
:formula_24

which, according to the definition of expected value (for a discrete random variable), can be written as follows

:formula_25

which can be rearranged to become
:formula_26

As the &quot;log-evidence&quot; formula_27 is fixed with respect to formula_28, maximizing the final term formula_29 minimizes the KL divergence of formula_28 from formula_31. By appropriate choice of formula_28, formula_29 becomes tractable to compute and to maximize. Hence we have both an analytical approximation formula_28 for the posterior formula_6, and a lower bound formula_29 for the log-evidence formula_27 (since the KL-divergence is non-negative).

The lower bound formula_29 is known as the (negative) variational free energy in analogy with thermodynamic free energy because it can also be expressed as a negative energy formula_39 plus the entropy of formula_28. The term formula_29 is also known as Evidence Lower Bound, abbreviated as ELBO, to emphasize that it is a lower (worst-case) bound on the log-evidence of the data.

===Proofs===
By the generalized Pythagorean theorem of Bregman divergence, of which KL-divergence is a special case, it can be shown that:

:formula_42

where formula_43 is a convex set and the equality holds if:

:formula_44

In this case, the global minimizer formula_45 with formula_46 can be found as follows:

:formula_47

in which the normalizing constant is:

:formula_48

The term formula_49 is often called the evidence lower bound (ELBO) in practice, since formula_50, as shown above.

By interchanging the roles of formula_51 and formula_52 we can iteratively compute the approximated formula_53 and formula_54 of the true model&#x27;s marginals formula_55 and formula_56 respectively. Although this iterative scheme is guaranteed to converge monotonically, the converged formula_57 is only a local minimizer of formula_58.

If the constrained space formula_43 is confined within independent space, i.e. formula_60the above iterative scheme will become the so-called mean field approximation formula_61as shown below.

==Mean field approximation==
The variational distribution formula_5 is usually assumed to factorize over some partition of the latent variables, i.e. for some partition of the latent variables formula_63 into formula_64,

:formula_65

It can be shown using the calculus of variations (hence the name &quot;variational Bayes&quot;) that the &quot;best&quot; distribution formula_66 for each of the factors formula_67 (in terms of the distribution minimizing the KL divergence, as described above) satisfies:

:formula_68

where formula_69 is the expectation of the logarithm of the joint probability of the data and latent variables, taken with respect to formula_70 over all variables not in the partition: refer to Lemma 4.1 of for a derivation of the distribution formula_71.

In practice, we usually work in terms of logarithms, i.e.:

:formula_72

The constant in the above expression is related to the normalizing constant (the denominator in the expression above for formula_66) and is usually reinstated by inspection, as the rest of the expression can usually be recognized as being a known type of distribution (e.g. Gaussian, gamma, etc.).

Using the properties of expectations, the expression formula_69 can usually be simplified into a function of the fixed hyperparameters of the prior distributions over the latent variables and of expectations (and sometimes higher moments such as the variance) of latent variables not in the current partition (i.e. latent variables not included in formula_75). This creates circular dependencies between the parameters of the distributions over variables in one partition and the expectations of variables in the other partitions. This naturally suggests an iterative algorithm, much like EM (the expectation–maximization algorithm), in which the expectations (and possibly higher moments) of the latent variables are initialized in some fashion (perhaps randomly), and then the parameters of each distribution are computed in turn using the current values of the expectations, after which the expectation of the newly computed distribution is set appropriately according to the computed parameters. An algorithm of this sort is guaranteed to converge.

In other words, for each of the partitions of variables, by simplifying the expression for the distribution over the partition&#x27;s variables and examining the distribution&#x27;s functional dependency on the variables in question, the family of the distribution can usually be determined (which in turn determines the value of the constant). The formula for the distribution&#x27;s parameters will be expressed in terms of the prior distributions&#x27; hyperparameters (which are known constants), but also in terms of expectations of functions of variables in other partitions. Usually these expectations can be simplified into functions of expectations of the variables themselves (i.e. the means); sometimes expectations of squared variables (which can be related to the variance of the variables), or expectations of higher powers (i.e. higher moments) also appear. In most cases, the other variables&#x27; distributions will be from known families, and the formulas for the relevant expectations can be looked up. However, those formulas depend on those distributions&#x27; parameters, which depend in turn on the expectations about other variables. The result is that the formulas for the parameters of each variable&#x27;s distributions can be expressed as a series of equations with mutual, nonlinear dependencies among the variables. Usually, it is not possible to solve this system of equations directly. However, as described above, the dependencies suggest a simple iterative algorithm, which in most cases is guaranteed to converge. An example will make this process clearer.

==A duality formula for variational inference==
The following theorem is referred to as a duality formula for variational inference. It explains some important properties of the variational distributions used in variational Bayes methods.

 Consider two probability spaces formula_76 and formula_77 with formula_78. Assume that there is a common dominating probability measure formula_79 such that formula_80 and formula_81. Let formula_82 denote any real-valued random variable on formula_76 that satisfies formula_84. Then the following equality holds

:formula_85

Further, the supremum on the right-hand side is attained if and only if it holds

:formula_86

almost surely with respect to probability measure formula_28, where formula_88 and formula_89 denote the Radon–Nikodym derivatives of the probability measures formula_31 and formula_28 with respect to formula_79, respectively.

==A basic example==
Consider a simple non-hierarchical Bayesian model consisting of a set of i.i.d. observations from a Gaussian distribution, with unknown mean and variance. In the following, we work through this model in great detail to illustrate the workings of the variational Bayes method.

For mathematical convenience, in the following example we work in terms of the precision — i.e. the reciprocal of the variance (or in a multivariate Gaussian, the inverse of the covariance matrix) — rather than the variance itself. (From a theoretical standpoint, precision and variance are equivalent since there is a one-to-one correspondence between the two.)

===The mathematical model===
We place conjugate prior distributions on the unknown mean formula_93 and precision formula_94, i.e. the mean also follows a Gaussian distribution while the precision follows a gamma distribution. In other words:

:formula_95

The hyperparameters formula_96 and formula_97 in the prior distributions are fixed, given values. They can be set to small positive numbers to give broad prior distributions indicating ignorance about the prior distributions of formula_93 and formula_94.

We are given formula_100 data points formula_101 and our goal is to infer the posterior distribution formula_102 of the parameters formula_93 and formula_104

===The joint probability===
The joint probability of all variables can be rewritten as

:formula_105

where the individual factors are

:formula_106

where

:formula_107

===Factorized approximation===
Assume that formula_108, i.e. that the posterior distribution factorizes into independent factors for formula_93 and formula_94. This type of assumption underlies the variational Bayesian method. The true posterior distribution does not in fact factor this way (in fact, in this simple case, it is known to be a Gaussian-gamma distribution), and hence the result we obtain will be an approximation.

===Derivation of ===
Then

:formula_111

In the above derivation, formula_112, formula_113 and formula_114 refer to values that are constant with respect to formula_93. Note that the term formula_116 is not a function of formula_93 and will have the same value regardless of the value of formula_93. Hence in line 3 we can absorb it into the constant term at the end. We do the same thing in line 7.

The last line is simply a quadratic polynomial in formula_93. Since this is the logarithm of formula_120, we can see that formula_120 itself is a Gaussian distribution.

With a certain amount of tedious math (expanding the squares inside of the braces, separating out and grouping the terms involving formula_93 and formula_123 and completing the square over formula_93), we can derive the parameters of the Gaussian distribution:

:formula_125

Note that all of the above steps can be shortened by using the formula for the sum of two quadratics.

In other words:

:formula_126

===Derivation of ===
The derivation of formula_127 is similar to above, although we omit some of the details for the sake of brevity.

:formula_128

Exponentiating both sides, we can see that formula_127 is a gamma distribution. Specifically:

:formula_130

===Algorithm for computing the parameters===
Let us recap the conclusions from the previous sections:

:formula_131

and

:formula_130

In each case, the parameters for the distribution over one of the variables depend on expectations taken with respect to the other variable. We can expand the expectations, using the standard formulas for the expectations of moments of the Gaussian and gamma distributions:

:formula_133

Applying these formulas to the above equations is trivial in most cases, but the equation for formula_134 takes more work:

:formula_135

We can then write the parameter equations as follows, without any expectations:

:formula_136

Note that there are circular dependencies among the formulas for formula_137and formula_134. This naturally suggests an EM-like algorithm:

# Compute formula_139 and formula_140 Use these values to compute formula_141 and formula_142
# Initialize formula_137 to some arbitrary value.
#Use the current value of formula_144 along with the known values of the other parameters, to compute formula_134.
# Use the current value of formula_146 along with the known values of the other parameters, to compute formula_137.
#Repeat the last two steps until convergence (i.e. until neither value has changed more than some small amount).

We then have values for the hyperparameters of the approximating distributions of the posterior parameters, which we can use to compute any properties we want of the posterior — e.g. its mean and variance, a 95% highest-density region (the smallest interval that includes 95% of the total probability), etc.

It can be shown that this algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum.

Note also that the posterior distributions have the same form as the corresponding prior distributions. We did &quot;not&quot; assume this; the only assumption we made was that the distributions factorize, and the form of the distributions followed naturally. It turns out (see below) that the fact that the posterior distributions have the same form as the prior distributions is not a coincidence, but a general result whenever the prior distributions are members of the exponential family, which is the case for most of the standard distributions.

==Further discussion==

===Step-by-step recipe===
The above example shows the method by which the variational-Bayesian approximation to a posterior probability density in a given Bayesian network is derived:
#Describe the network with a graphical model, identifying the observed variables (data) formula_2 and unobserved variables (parameters formula_149 and latent variables formula_63) and their conditional probability distributions. Variational Bayes will then construct an approximation to the posterior probability formula_151. The approximation has the basic property that it is a factorized distribution, i.e. a product of two or more independent distributions over disjoint subsets of the unobserved variables.
# Partition the unobserved variables into two or more subsets, over which the independent factors will be derived. There is no universal procedure for doing this; creating too many subsets yields a poor approximation, while creating too few makes the entire variational Bayes procedure intractable. Typically, the first split is to separate the parameters and latent variables; often, this is enough by itself to produce a tractable result. Assume that the partitions are called formula_152.
# For a given partition formula_75, write down the formula for the best approximating distribution formula_71 using the basic equation formula_155 .
# Fill in the formula for the joint probability distribution using the graphical model. Any component conditional distributions that don&#x27;t involve any of the variables in formula_75 can be ignored; they will be folded into the constant term.
# Simplify the formula and apply the expectation operator, following the above example. Ideally, this should simplify into expectations of basic functions of variables not in formula_75 (e.g. first or second raw moments, expectation of a logarithm, etc.). In order for the variational Bayes procedure to work well, these expectations should generally be expressible analytically as functions of the parameters and/or hyperparameters of the distributions of these variables. In all cases, these expectation terms are constants with respect to the variables in the current partition.
# The functional form of the formula with respect to the variables in the current partition indicates the type of distribution. In particular, exponentiating the formula generates the probability density function (PDF) of the distribution (or at least, something proportional to it, with unknown normalization constant). In order for the overall method to be tractable, it should be possible to recognize the functional form as belonging to a known distribution. Significant mathematical manipulation may be required to convert the formula into a form that matches the PDF of a known distribution. When this can be done, the normalization constant can be reinstated by definition, and equations for the parameters of the known distribution can be derived by extracting the appropriate parts of the formula.
# When all expectations can be replaced analytically with functions of variables not in the current partition, and the PDF put into a form that allows identification with a known distribution, the result is a set of equations expressing the values of the optimum parameters as functions of the parameters of variables in other partitions.
#When this procedure can be applied to all partitions, the result is a set of mutually linked equations specifying the optimum values of all parameters.
# An expectation–maximization (EM) type procedure is then applied, picking an initial value for each parameter and the iterating through a series of steps, where at each step we cycle through the equations, updating each parameter in turn. This is guaranteed to converge.

===Most important points===
Due to all of the mathematical manipulations involved, it is easy to lose track of the big picture. The important things are:
# The idea of variational Bayes is to construct an analytical approximation to the posterior probability of the set of unobserved variables (parameters and latent variables), given the data. This means that the form of the solution is similar to other Bayesian inference methods, such as Gibbs sampling — i.e. a distribution that seeks to describe everything that is known about the variables. As in other Bayesian methods — but unlike e.g. in expectation–maximization (EM) or other maximum likelihood methods — both types of unobserved variables (i.e. parameters and latent variables) are treated the same, i.e. as random variables. Estimates for the variables can then be derived in the standard Bayesian ways, e.g. calculating the mean of the distribution to get a single point estimate or deriving a credible interval, highest density region, etc.
# &quot;Analytical approximation&quot; means that a formula can be written down for the posterior distribution. The formula generally consists of a product of well-known probability distributions, each of which &quot;factorizes&quot; over a set of unobserved variables (i.e. it is conditionally independent of the other variables, given the observed data). This formula is not the true posterior distribution, but an approximation to it; in particular, it will generally agree fairly closely in the lowest moments of the unobserved variables, e.g. the mean and variance.
# The result of all of the mathematical manipulations is (1) the identity of the probability distributions making up the factors, and (2) mutually dependent formulas for the parameters of these distributions. The actual values of these parameters are computed numerically, through an alternating iterative procedure much like EM.

===Compared with expectation–maximization (EM)===
Variational Bayes (VB) is often compared with expectation–maximization (EM). The actual numerical procedure is quite similar, in that both are alternating iterative procedures that successively converge on optimum parameter values. The initial steps to derive the respective procedures are also vaguely similar, both starting out with formulas for probability densities and both involving significant amounts of mathematical manipulations.

However, there are a number of differences. Most important is &quot;what&quot; is being computed.
* EM computes point estimates of posterior distribution of those random variables that can be categorized as &quot;parameters&quot;, but only estimates of the actual posterior distributions of the latent variables (at least in &quot;soft EM&quot;, and often only when the latent variables are discrete). The point estimates computed are the modes of these parameters; no other information is available.
* VB, on the other hand, computes estimates of the actual posterior distribution of all variables, both parameters and latent variables. When point estimates need to be derived, generally the mean is used rather than the mode, as is normal in Bayesian inference. Concomitant with this, the parameters computed in VB do &quot;not&quot; have the same significance as those in EM. EM computes optimum values of the parameters of the Bayes network itself. VB computes optimum values of the parameters of the distributions used to approximate the parameters and latent variables of the Bayes network. For example, a typical Gaussian mixture model will have parameters for the mean and variance of each of the mixture components. EM would directly estimate optimum values for these parameters. VB, however, would first fit a distribution to these parameters — typically in the form of a prior distribution, e.g. a normal-scaled inverse gamma distribution — and would then compute values for the parameters of this prior distribution, i.e. essentially hyperparameters. In this case, VB would compute optimum estimates of the four parameters of the normal-scaled inverse gamma distribution that describes the joint distribution of the mean and variance of the component.

==A more complex example==

Imagine a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model described as follows:

:formula_158

Note:
* SymDir() is the symmetric Dirichlet distribution of dimension formula_159, with the hyperparameter for each component set to formula_160. The Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior of the categorical distribution or multinomial distribution.
* formula_161 is the Wishart distribution, which is the conjugate prior of the precision matrix (inverse covariance matrix) for a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
* Mult() is a multinomial distribution over a single observation (equivalent to a categorical distribution). The state space is a &quot;one-of-K&quot; representation, i.e., a formula_159-dimensional vector in which one of the elements is 1 (specifying the identity of the observation) and all other elements are 0.
* formula_163 is the Gaussian distribution, in this case specifically the multivariate Gaussian distribution.

The interpretation of the above variables is as follows:
* formula_164 is the set of formula_100 data points, each of which is a formula_166-dimensional vector distributed according to a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
* formula_167 is a set of latent variables, one per data point, specifying which mixture component the corresponding data point belongs to, using a &quot;one-of-K&quot; vector representation with components formula_168 for formula_169, as described above.
* formula_170 is the mixing proportions for the formula_159 mixture components.
* formula_172 and formula_173 specify the parameters (mean and precision) associated with each mixture component.

The joint probability of all variables can be rewritten as

:formula_174

where the individual factors are

:formula_175

where

:formula_176

Assume that formula_177.

Then

:formula_178

where we have defined

:formula_179

Exponentiating both sides of the formula for formula_180 yields

:formula_181

Requiring that this be normalized ends up requiring that the formula_182 sum to 1 over all values of formula_183, yielding

:formula_184

where

:formula_185

In other words, formula_186 is a product of single-observation multinomial distributions, and factors over each individual formula_187, which is distributed as a single-observation multinomial distribution with parameters formula_188 for formula_169.

Furthermore, we note that

:formula_190

which is a standard result for categorical distributions.

Now, considering the factor formula_191, note that it automatically factors into formula_192 due to the structure of the graphical model defining our Gaussian mixture model, which is specified above.

Then,

:formula_193

Taking the exponential of both sides, we recognize formula_194 as a Dirichlet distribution

:formula_195

where

:formula_196

where

:formula_197

Finally

:formula_198

Grouping and reading off terms involving formula_199 and formula_200, the result is a Gaussian-Wishart distribution given by

:formula_201

given the definitions

:formula_202

Finally, notice that these functions require the values of formula_188, which make use of formula_182, which is defined in turn based on formula_205, formula_206, and formula_207. Now that we have determined the distributions over which these expectations are taken, we can derive formulas for them:

:formula_208

These results lead to

:formula_209

These can be converted from proportional to absolute values by normalizing over formula_183 so that the corresponding values sum to 1.

Note that:

# The update equations for the parameters formula_211, formula_212, formula_213 and formula_214 of the variables formula_199 and formula_200 depend on the statistics formula_217, formula_218, and formula_219, and these statistics in turn depend on formula_188.
# The update equations for the parameters formula_221 of the variable formula_170 depend on the statistic formula_217, which depends in turn on formula_188.
# The update equation for formula_188 has a direct circular dependence on formula_211, formula_212, formula_213 and formula_214 as well as an indirect circular dependence on formula_213, formula_214 and formula_221 through formula_233 and formula_234.

This suggests an iterative procedure that alternates between two steps:

# An E-step that computes the value of formula_188 using the current values of all the other parameters.
# An M-step that uses the new value of formula_188 to compute new values of all the other parameters.

Note that these steps correspond closely with the standard EM algorithm to derive a maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution for the parameters of a Gaussian mixture model. The responsibilities formula_188 in the E step correspond closely to the posterior probabilities of the latent variables given the data, i.e. formula_238; the computation of the statistics formula_217, formula_218, and formula_219 corresponds closely to the computation of corresponding &quot;soft-count&quot; statistics over the data; and the use of those statistics to compute new values of the parameters corresponds closely to the use of soft counts to compute new parameter values in normal EM over a Gaussian mixture model.

==Exponential-family distributions==
Note that in the previous example, once the distribution over unobserved variables was assumed to factorize into distributions over the &quot;parameters&quot; and distributions over the &quot;latent data&quot;, the derived &quot;best&quot; distribution for each variable was in the same family as the corresponding prior distribution over the variable. This is a general result that holds true for all prior distributions derived from the exponential family.

<text>The Lymington River drains part of the New Forest in Hampshire in southern England. Numerous headwaters to the west of Lyndhurst give rise to the river, including Highland Water, Bratley Water and Fletchers Water. From Brockenhurst the river runs southwards to the Solent at Lymington.

Highland Water rises north of the Ocknell Inclosure () and flows for to Bolderford Bridge () where it meets Ober Water. From there, it is known as the Lymington River and flows for a further to ().

==History==
In 1731 a merchant navy captain, Captain Cross, constructed a causeway and bridge across the estuary to the north of Lymington. He built toll houses and charged travellers using his causeway, more than a mile south of the existing bridge at Boldre. This impedes the river and further silted up Lymington harbour, losing its minor shipping rapidly. Lymington Corporation pursued the matter in court and lost their case. 

In 1795 the mud building up in the estuary &quot;has rendered it already very narrow; and will probably in a few years, so completely choke it up, as to make it unnavigable by any ships of considerable burden.&quot; 

The causeway was taken over by the regional rail firm who collected the tolls until, after nationalised rail, it was bought out by Hampshire County Council in 1955 – tolls paid down the price and ceased a few years later. Today silting in the harbour as a result of the structure (almost a dam) occurs, but is ameliorated a higher sea level and the scouring effects of the Isle of Wight ferries. Before the structure it is said the diurnal tide influenced flow up to Brockenhurst.

Against the sea, the outer limit of the end of the estuary&#x27;s mud at low tide is 550–650 metres closer to land than in 1895.

==Reedbeds==
The river&#x27;s extensive reedbeds are a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

<text>Diane Thomas (born Diane Fowler), known professionally as Sunset Thomas, is an American artist and former pornographic actress. She was runner-up for &quot;Penthouse&quot; Pet of the Year in 1998 and is a member of the AVN, XRCO, and Legends of Erotica halls of fame.

She is also a boxing journalist.

== Personal life ==
Thomas worked as a prostitute at the Moonlite BunnyRanch and, according to owner Dennis Hof, made $2,000 a night. She later told interviewer Andrew Anthony that there is no real difference between pornography and prostitution.

Thomas is the aunt of porn star Sunrise Adams. Thomas dated Dennis Hof, the owner of Moonlight BunnyRanch, during her tenure there, and during that time legally adopted the name &quot;Diane Hof&quot;.

== Adult film career ==

Thomas was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame in 2001. After appearing in the documentary series &quot;&quot;, Thomas was featured in the 2005 documentary &quot;Pornstar Pets&quot; and made an appearance on &quot;Maury&quot;, in which she encountered a crush from her middle school days. The episode was titled &#x27;I Was An Ugly Teen... Now I&#x27;m a Hot, Sexy 10!&#x27;. In 2006, Thomas obtained her own show on KSEX radio called &quot;Sunset After Sunset&quot;. In 2007, she appeared on the &quot;Montel Williams Show&quot; to discuss her porn career and being a mother.

In April 2009, Thomas released her erotic fiction novel, &quot;Anatomy of an Adult Film&quot;, which was largely a fictionalized account of her adult film career. She was inducted into the Legends of Erotica Hall of Fame in 2009 and the XRCO Hall of Fame in April 2010.

==Writing==
Thomas has written boxing columns for &quot;Doghouseboxing.com&quot;.

<text>The River Wallington curves and gently meanders west then south in south-east Hampshire. Rising at sources to north and south of Waterlooville these flow west around Portsdown Hill into a dammed section as the lake in the grounds of Southwick House to unite, then through the village of Southwick then, in that parish, to receive the Beck of similar flow from the north. The river turns south and runs past fields and past the large town Fareham, before entering Portsmouth Harbour, as its main natural watercourse inflow, at Wallington.

The Beck drains, likewise standard small dendritic drainage sources, at least four in number, and particularly the hamlets of Upper and Lower Beckford in Southwick and Widley civil parish, crossed by Beckford Lane today at Beckford Bridge, a former ford.

<doc id="1208525" wikidata="Q3617938" url="?curid=1208525" title="Anne Murray, Duchess of Atholl">
<text>Anne Murray, Duchess of Atholl (&quot;née&quot; Anne Home-Drummond; 17 June 1814 – 22 May 1897), and known as the Lady Glenlyon between 1839–46, as the Duchess of Atholl between 1846–64 and as the Dowager Duchess of Atholl between 1864–97, was a Scottish aristocrat and courtier. For 55 years, she was a close friend of Queen Victoria, who referred to her as &quot;the dear Duchess&quot;.

Murray was born at Edinburgh, Scotland, the daughter of Henry Home-Drummond, 6th of Blair Drummond. Her mother, Christian, was the daughter of Col. Charles Moray, 15th of Abercairny and Anne Stirling (daughter of Sir William Stirling), and eventual heiress to her brother William Moray-Stirling, 17th of Abercairny. At Blair Drummond, where she spent her childhood, Anne was a neighbour of the Murrays of Atholl family at Blair Castle. She was educated in England.

On 29 October 1839, she married George Murray, 2nd Baron Glenlyon, at Blair Drummond, thereby becoming Lady Glenlyon. In 1846, he succeeded his uncle as sixth Duke of Atholl, and Anne became Duchess of Atholl.

The Duke and Duchess (who preferred the earlier spelling of &quot;Athole&quot; for their title and residence) had one child, John Stewart-Murray, 7th Duke of Atholl (1840–1917).

She served as Mistress of the Robes to Queen Victoria in Lord Derby&#x27;s short-lived government of 1852. She subsequently served the queen as a Lady of the Bedchamber for almost forty years and was one of Victoria&#x27;s closest friends. When The Prince Consort died, the Queen came out of the room where he had died and proclaimed, &quot;Oh, Duchess, he is dead!&quot; 
The Duke of Atholl died in 1864, and Anne became the Dowager Duchess of Atholl. In 1892, when Gladstone again came to power, his policy of Home Rule for Ireland had alienated many of the upper classes, and no lady of ducal rank could be found who was willing to serve as Mistress of the Robes. The post therefore remained vacant, while the Dowager Duchess of Atholl and the Duchess of Roxburghe performed the duties of the office. 

The Duchess of Atholl died at Dunkeld House, Perthshire, in May 1897, aged 82. The Queen sent her telegrams every two hours during the last hours of her life.

She was buried in the Murray family vault at the Old Blair churchyard.

<text>Anne Emily Innes-Ker, Duchess of Roxburghe (&quot;née&quot; Spencer-Churchill; 14 November 1854 – 20 June 1923) was the daughter of the 7th Duke of Marlborough, who served in Conservative governments as Lord President of the Council and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. She served as Mistress of the Robes to Queen Victoria.

==Family and early life==
Lady Anne Spencer-Churchill was born on 14 November 1854, in London. She was the fourth daughter of John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough, who served in Conservative governments as Lord President of the Council and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and his wife, Lady Frances Vane, daughter of the 3rd Marquess of Londonderry. Lady Anne had two brothers and five sisters. The children rarely saw their mother, as they were raised by servants. Her brother Lord Randolph Churchill later became a Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer. Through him, Anne was the aunt of Prime Minister Winston Spencer Churchill.

==Marriage==
On 11 June 1874, Lady Anne was married to James Henry Robert Innes-Ker, Marquess of Bowmont and Cessford, eldest son of the sixth Duke of Roxburghe. He succeeded his father as the seventh Duke of Roxburghe in 1879, and Anne became The Duchess of Roxburghe. He died in 1892.

In 1883, she was appointed Mistress of the Robes to Queen Victoria by the Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, and served in that capacity until 1885. In 1892, when Gladstone again came to power, his policy of Home Rule for Ireland had alienated many of the upper classes, and no lady of ducal rank could be found who was willing to serve as Mistress of the Robes. The post therefore remained vacant, while the Duchess of Roxburghe and the Dowager Duchess of Atholl performed the duties of the office. In 1906 she christened the newest and largest ship then in the world, the Cunard Line&#x27;s RMS &quot;Mauretania&quot;.

During the First World War, she served as President of the Haddingtonshire Branch of the British Red Cross Society. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 New Year Honours.

She died in 1923 in London, at the home of her daughter Lady Evelyn and her husband, Colonel William Collins, after a lengthy illness.

<text>Zha Liangzheng (; 5 April 1918 - 26 February 1977), better known by his pen name Mu Dan (), was a Chinese poet. Born in Tianjin, he attended Tsinghua University at the age of 17, and graduated from National Southwestern Associated University in 1940. He served as an assistant lecturer of English at his alma mater for about two years. During World War II, he joined the Chinese Expeditionary Force in Burma and fought alongside the Allied forces against the Japanese. After the war ended, he attended the University of Chicago, where he obtained a master&#x27;s degree in English literature. He was a distant paternal relative of the wuxia novelist Louis Cha.
Most of Zha&#x27;s poems were written during the late 1930s and 1940s. His poetry, which is characterised by impassioned speculation, abstract sensuality, and occasionally, restrained irony, is the foremost example of Chinese new vernacular verse absorbing modern Western techniques. Zha was a professed admirer of W. H. Auden, W. B. Yeats and T. S. Eliot. He studied their poetry at Southwest Associated University under William Empson, himself a leading modernist poet. On the other hand, the patriotism and the compassion for the suffering and needy in his poetry fall easily in line with a great tradition in Chinese poetry.

Zha had to give up poetry writing several years after the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, and he turned to literary translation, for which he is also renowned. His works in this respect include the Chinese translations of Lord Byron&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan&quot; and Aleksandr Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;. It was not until 1976 that Zha resumed writing poetry. He produced 27 poems that year; highly regarded among them were several moving elegy-style pieces, prophetic of his sudden death of a heart attack in early 1977.

It is distributed on the coasts of: Southern California and the Channel Islands; the Central Coast region; San Francisco Bay Area; and in Mexico on the northwestern Baja California Peninsula and Guadalupe Island.

It is restricted to nearly frost-free habitats because its stem is succulent, being cold tolerant to around . Storing water in this way makes the plants tolerant of drought but especially susceptible to frost.

==Cultivation==
Giant Coreopsis is cultivated as an ornamental plant by specialty nurseries. It is planted in native plant, drought tolerant, and wildlife gardens, and in natural landscaping and habitat restoration projects.

The plant needs good drainage and is not tolerant of excess moisture, needing minimal watering during the summer.

<doc id="1208547" wikidata="Q7496850" url="?curid=1208547" title="Shimazu Tadayoshi">
<text>was a &quot;daimyō&quot; (feudal lord) of Satsuma Province during Japan&#x27;s Sengoku period. He was born into the Mimasaka Shimazu family (伊作島津家), which was part of the Shimazu clan, but after his father Shimazu Yoshihisa died, his mother married Shimazu Unkyu of another branch family, the Soshū (相州家). Tadayoshi thus came to represent two families within the larger Shimazu clan.

Shimazu Katsuhisa, who presided over the Shimazu family, did not have a son and he was driven out by Shimazu Sanehisa, who was the head of yet another branch, the Sasshū (薩州家). Sanehisa then laid claim to be the head of the clan without being properly recognized by the rest of the families. Katsuhisa asked Tadayoshi for help to regain his position, and Tadayoshi sent his son Shimazu Takahisa to be adopted by Katsuhisa. In 1526, Katsuhisa handed over the position of the head of the family to Takahisa. In 1539 though, during the Battle of Ichirai, Tadayoshi defeated Katsuhisa (who would regain power later) and Takahisa came to be recognized by all members of the Shimazu clan as the head.

He and his son lived together for a number of years at Uchiujijó castle and after Takahisa&#x27;s succession, Tadayoshi retired to a monastery which belonged to the Zen sect. During this time Tadayoshi called himself &quot;Shimazu Nisshinsai&quot; (or &quot;Jisshinsai&quot;) (島津日新斎) He held a great amount of power, trading with the Ryūkyū Kingdom and Ming-dynasty China. He also arranged for massive purchases of arquebuses to make the clan prosperous for the planned unification of Kyūshū by Takahisa.

Tadayoshi wrote &quot;Iroha uta&quot; a set of 47 poems poem that conveyed Confucian moral principles in an comprehensible manner. The poems consisted of a blend of Confucian values, the Buddhist faith and the qualities for military success. Each of the 47 short poems or &quot;stanzas&quot; consisted of two lines, the first of which contains 17 syllables and the second 14. &quot;Iroha uta&quot; played an important part in ethical teachings across the Satsuma han until the end of the Edo period.

He had four grandsons Shimazu Yoshihisa, Shimazu Yoshihiro, Shimazu Toshihisa, and Shimazu Iehisa. Tadayoshi died in 1568 at the age of 77.

<doc id="1208555" wikidata="Q16022961" url="?curid=1208555" title="George Wyman">
<text>George Herbert Wyman (1860 – 1939) was an American architect, best known for his involvement in construction of the Bradbury Building at 304 South Broadway in Los Angeles, California.

==Life and career==

Wyman was born in Dayton, the son of Ellen “Nellie” J. (née Rutledge) and Gustavus J. Wyman. On leaving school, he was apprenticed in the architects office of his uncle, Luthor Peters. He moved to Los Angeles in 1891 where he worked as a draughtsman in the offices of Sumner Hunt.

In 1892, Hunt was approached by the mining millionaire Lewis Bradbury to construct a landmark building for a site in downtown Los Angeles. Disappointed with Hunt&#x27;s design, Bradbury took the surprising step of asking the young Wyman to design the building, despite the fact that Wyman had no formal qualifications as an architect, and had not previously designed a building. The reasons for this choice are still unclear, but it has been suggested that Bradbury was inspired by some sketches that Wyman had been working on.

Wyman had been toying with the design of a futuristic building described in Edward Bellamy&#x27;s science fiction novel and social commentary, &quot;Looking Backward: From 2000-1887&quot; (chapter 10). In the utopian society of the year 2000 the hero is taken to visit a commercial store:
With the exception of the fountain, the description neatly fits the interior which Wyman achieved in the Bradbury building just six years after Bellamy&#x27;s book was published.

This narrative has been contested by John Crandell, who claims that the original story was unsubstantiated and relied on a single testimony from Wyman&#x27;s daughters.

According to a story told by Wyman&#x27;s grandson, the famous sci-fi figure Forrest J Ackerman, Wyman was troubled by the responsibility of taking on the commission. Both he and his wife Belle were Spiritualists, and the couple decided to consult the spirits for guidance. Using a planchette, a device similar to a Ouija board, they traced out the message
:&quot;Mark Wyman take the Bradbury building and you will be... Successful.&quot;

Mark Wyman was George&#x27;s younger brother, who had died at the age of 8. At first, they had trouble reading the final word, as it was written upside down in relation to the rest of the message.

As a result, Wyman accepted the commission, and Bradbury was pleased with the drawings and plans for a five-story building at the corner of Broadway and Third Street. The building was completed a year later in 1893 although costs spiralled from $175,000 to $500,000, largely as a result of Bradbury specifying the best quality materials for all aspects of the construction.

The Bradbury building was met with critical acclaim, including a positive review in &quot;Arts and Architecture&quot; magazine. However, it was Wyman&#x27;s only major success. In the following years, Wyman received numerous commissions for new buildings. He decided to bolster his qualification with an architectural correspondence course, but this seems to have turned him away from using interior light as an architectural element. His office buildings took on a heavy solid style and most have subsequently been demolished, whilst the Bradbury building is still much celebrated. A particular question is why did Esther McCoy not consult a single primary source of information other than the allegation of Wyman&#x27;s relatives, their claim that George had worked for Sumner Hunt. John Crandell&#x27;s claim contradicting McCoy&#x27;s whole thesis is thoroughly based upon primary source information circa 1890s. He has never come across a single piece of evidence that Wyman ever worked directly for Hunt prior to Hunt&#x27;s election to retain Wyman&#x27;s services as executive architect for the Byrne Building nine months following completion of the Bradbury. The continued claim of Wyman having been the design architect for the Bradbury Building is one of the most fatuous allegations in the history of Los Angeles.

<text>The Bradbury Building is an architectural landmark in downtown Los Angeles, California, United States. Built in 1893, the five-story office building is best known for its extraordinary skylit atrium of access walkways, stairs and elevators, and their ornate ironwork. The building was commissioned by Los Angeles gold-mining millionaire Lewis L. Bradbury and constructed by architect George Wyman from the original design by Sumner Hunt. It appears in numerous works of fiction and has been the site of many movie and television shoots and music videos.

The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1977, one of only four office buildings in Los Angeles to be so honored. It was also designated a landmark by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission and is the city&#x27;s oldest landmarked building.

==History==
===19th century===
Lewis L. Bradbury, Sr. (November 6, 1823 – July 15, 1892) was a 19th century millionaire who made his fortune in mining and real estate—he owned the Tajo Mine in Sinaloa, Mexico—who became a real estate developer in the later part of his life. In 1892 he began planning to construct a five-story building at Broadway and Third Street in Los Angeles, close to the Bunker Hill neighborhood. A local architect, Sumner Hunt, was hired to design the building, and turned in a completed design, but Bradbury dismissed Hunt&#x27;s plans as inadequate to the grand building he wanted. He then hired George Wyman, one of Hunt&#x27;s draftsmen, to do the design. Bradbury supposedly felt that Wyman understood his own vision of the building better than Hunt did, but there is no concrete evidence that Wyman changed Hunt&#x27;s design, which has raised some controversy about who should be considered to be the architect of the building. Wyman had no formal education as an architect, and was working for Hunt for $5 a week at the time.

The building opened in 1893, some months after Bradbury&#x27;s death in 1892, and was completed in 1894, at the total cost of $500,000, about three times the original budget of $175,000.

===20th century===
The building has operated as an office building for most of its history. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1977. It was purchased by developer and champion of downtown restoration Ira Yellin in the early 1980s, who invested $7 million in restoration, preservation and seismic retrofitting between 1989 and 1991. As part of the restoration, a storage area at the south end of the building was converted to a new rear-entrance portico, connecting the building more directly to Biddy Mason Park and the adjacent Broadway Spring Center parking garage. The building&#x27;s lighting system was also redesigned, bringing in alabaster wall sconces from Spain.

Since 1996, the building has served as the headquarters for the Los Angeles Police Department&#x27;s Internal Affairs division and other government agencies. The LAPD Board of Rights holds officer discipline hearings here, and within the force it is given the nickname &quot;the Ovens&quot;, because officers see it as the place they &quot;get burned.&quot; The LAPD has a 50-year lease on their space.

===21st century===
The building was purchased for $6 million in 2003 by a Hong Kong investor, less than the $7 million Ira Yellin invested just to rehabilitate and seismically retrofit the structure after acquiring it in 1989, a reflection of Yellin&#x27;s commitment to downtown preservation and restoration. It was never listed for sale, only offered to a select group of potential buyers who would respect its legacy and retain its character. The building, according to Yellin&#x27;s widow Adele, at the time, was &quot;in very good hands&quot;.

From 2001 to 2003 the Museum of Architecture and Design had its home there. In 2007, the Morono Kiang Gallery of Chinese art opened in the building.

Several of the offices are rented out to private concerns, including Red Line Tours. The retail spaces on the first floor currently house Ross Cutlery, where O. J. Simpson purchased a stiletto that figured in his murder trial, a Subway sandwich restaurant, a Blue Bottle Coffee shop, and a real estate sales office for loft conversions in other nearby historic buildings.

, the Berggruen Institute maintains its offices in the building.

, a new co-working space operated by the property management company of the building, Downtown Properties, has officially opened called Bradbury Studios. It includes soft seating in the atrium, conference and meeting rooms, event spaces, and the private speakeasy called the Wyman Bar operated by NeueHouse exclusively available to building tenants, social members, and their guests. 

==Architecture==
The building&#x27;s undistinguished exterior facade of brown brick, sandstone and terracotta detailing was designed in the commercial vernacular Italian Renaissance Revival style current at the time. Its interior is its most notable part.

The narrow entrance lobby, with its low ceiling and minimal light &quot;has the look of a Parisian alley of arched windows&quot;, and opens into a bright naturally lit great &quot;awe-inspiring cathedral-like&quot; center court. Robert Forster, star of the TV series &quot;Banyon&quot; that used the building for his office, described it as &quot;one of the great interiors of L.A. Outside it doesn&#x27;t look like much, but when you walk inside, suddenly you&#x27;re back a hundred and twenty years.&quot;

The five-story central court features glazed and unglazed yellow and pink bricks, ornamental cast iron, tiling, Italian marble, Mexican tile, decorative terracotta and polished wood, capped by a skylight that allows the court to be flooded with natural rather than artificial light, creating ever-changing shadows and accents during the day. At the time the building was completed, it featured the largest plate-glass windows in Los Angeles.

Open &quot;bird-cage&quot; elevators surrounded by wrought-iron grillwork go up to the fifth floor.

Geometric patterned staircases and wrought-iron and polished oak railings are used abundantly throughout. The wrought-iron was created in France and displayed at the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair before being installed in the building. Freestanding mail-chutes also feature ironwork. The overall effect, according to a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer, is &quot;a mesmerizing degree of symmetry and visual complexity&quot;.

==Tourism==
The building is a popular tourist attraction. It is open daily and staffed by a government worker who provides historical background on it. Casual visitors are only permitted up to the first landing. Brochures and tours are also available. It is close to three other downtown Los Angeles landmarks: the Grand Central Market, the Million Dollar Theater (across the street) and Angels Flight (two blocks away). Access is via the Los Angeles Metro Rail B and D lines at Civic Center/Grand Park station, three blocks distant.

==In popular culture==
The Bradbury Building has been featured prominently as a setting in many films, television shows, and in literature—particularly in the science fiction genre. Most notably, the building is a setting in the 1982 science fiction film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, for the character J. F. Sebastian&#x27;s apartment, and the climactic rooftop scene.

The Bradbury Building appeared in the noir films &quot;The Unfaithful&quot; (1947), &quot;Shockproof&quot; (1949), &quot;D.O.A.&quot; (1950) and &quot;I, The Jury&quot; (1953) (the latter filmed in 3-D). &quot;M&quot; (1951), a remake of the 1931 German film, contains a long search sequence filmed in the building, and a notable shot through the roof&#x27;s skylight. The five-story atrium also substituted for the interior of the seedy skid row hotel depicted in the climax of &quot;Good Neighbor Sam&quot; (1964).

The building is also featured in &quot;China Girl&quot; (1942), &quot;The White Cliffs of Dover&quot; (1944), &quot;Indestructible Man&quot; (1956), &quot;Caprice&quot; (1967), &quot;Marlowe&quot; (1969), the 1972 made-for-television movie &quot;The Night Strangler&quot;, &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974), &quot;The Cheap Detective&quot; (1978), &quot;Avenging Angel&quot; (1985), &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Law&quot; (1986), ‘’Midnight Cabaret’’ (1990), &quot;The Dreamer of Oz&quot; (1990), &quot;Wolf&quot; (1994), &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; (1998), &quot;Pay It Forward&quot; (2000), &quot;What Women Want&quot; (2000), &quot;(500) Days of Summer&quot; (2009) and &quot;The Artist&quot; (2011).

Television series that featured the building include the 1964 &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; episode &quot;Demon with a Glass Hand&quot;, and the 1962 &quot;Perry Mason&quot; episode &quot;The Case of the Double-Entry Mind&quot;. During the season six episodes (1963–64) of the series &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, the Stuart &quot;Stu&quot; Bailey character had his office in the Bradbury. In &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; the building is seen carrying the name &quot;Gotham Towers&quot; in &quot;Play It Again, Seymour&quot;, the last episode of the first season (1989). The building appeared in at least one episode of the television series &quot;Banyon&quot; (1972–73), where it was used as Robert Forster&#x27;s office, &quot;City of Angels&quot; (1976) and &quot;&quot; (1966–73), as well as Ned and Chuck&#x27;s Apartment in &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot;, which debuted in 2007. The building was also the setting for a scene from the series &quot;FlashForward&quot; in the episode &quot;Let No Man Put Asunder&quot;. In 2010 the building was transplanted to New York City for a two-part episode of &quot;&quot;. The Bradbury Building and a fake New York City subway entrance across the street were also used to represent the exterior of New York&#x27;s High School of Performing Arts in the opening credits of the television series &quot;Fame&quot;. The building appears as itself in multiple episodes of the fourth season of Amazon Studios&#x27; original series &quot;Bosch&quot;, in both exterior establishing shots and interior shots.

The Bradbury appeared in a 1979 music video for &quot;Take Me Home&quot; by Cher, in addition to music videos from the 1980s by Heart, Janet Jackson, Earth Wind and Fire, Phil Seymour and Genesis, and a Pontiac Pursuit commercial. Part of Janet Jackson&#x27;s 1989 film short &quot;Janet Jackson&#x27;s Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; was filmed in the building as well. The interior appears in the music video for the Pointer Sisters&#x27; 1980 song, &quot;He&#x27;s So Shy&quot;. The Bradbury Building was prominently featured in Monica&#x27;s 1998 single &quot;The First Night&quot; as well in Tony! Toni! Toné!&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Down&quot; music video. In 2016, the interiors were featured in the music video for &quot;The Road&quot; by Chinese musician Huang Zitao. The building was used in the music video for &quot;Icy&quot;, a 2019 song by South Korean girl group Itzy.

The Bradbury has frequently appeared in popular literature. In the &quot;Nathan Heller&quot; series of detective novels by Max Allan Collins, Heller&#x27;s A-1 Detective Agency&#x27;s Los Angeles offices are housed in the Bradbury, as shown in the novel &quot;Angel in Black&quot;. In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel &quot;The Case of the Colonist&#x27;s Corpse: A Sam Cogley Mystery&quot;, the protagonist works from the Bradbury Building four hundred years in the future. Other appearances occur in &quot;The Man With The Golden Torc&quot; by Simon R. Green, &quot;Angels Flight&quot; &quot;The Black Box&quot;, and &quot;The Drop,&quot; by Michael Connelly, and the science-fiction multiple novel series &quot;The World of Tiers&quot; by Philip Jose Farmer.

DC Comics and Marvel Comics—the latter of which has offices in the real Bradbury Building—both published comic book series based on characters that work in the historic landmark. The building serves as the headquarters for the Marvel Comics team The Order, and in the DC Universe, the Human Target runs his private investigation agency from the building.

The building was used for the music video for &quot;Say Something&quot;, a song released on January 25, 2018 by Justin Timberlake featuring Chris Stapleton.

The Bradbury Building was featured in &quot;On Location&quot;, episode 172 of the podcast &quot;99% Invisible&quot;.

The building interior was shown in the title sequence for the TV series &quot;The Ray Bradbury Theater&quot;, which aired from 1985 to 1992.

<text>Sulfamethoxazole (SMZ or SMX) is an antibiotic. It is used for bacterial infections such as urinary tract infections, bronchitis, and prostatitis and is effective against both gram negative and positive bacteria such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;.
Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and skin rashes. It is a sulfonamide and bacteriostatic. It resembles a component of folic acid. It prevents folic acid synthesis in the bacteria that must synthesize their own folic acid. Mammalian cells, and some bacteria, do not synthesize but require preformed folic acid (vitamin B9); they are therefore insensitive to sulfamethoxazole.
It was introduced to the United States in 1961. It is now mostly used in combination with trimethoprim (abbreviated SMX-TMP). The SMX-TMP combination is on the WHO Model List of Essential medicines as a first-choice treatment for urinary tract infections. Other names include: sulfamethalazole and sulfisomezole.

==Side effects==
The most common side effects of sulfamethoxazole are gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, anorexia) and allergic skin reactions (such as rash and urticaria). There have been rare instances where severe adverse reactions have resulted in fatalities. These include Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.

Allergic reactions to Sulfonamides have been shown to include the entire Gel-Coombs spectrum of hyperactivity reactions. Type 1 reactions include immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions such as urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis. In contrast, non-type 1 hypersensitivities are believed to be caused by metabolites of sulfonamides. Therefore, the liver and kidney are the determining factors of these other hypersensitivity reactions; alterations in kidney or liver functions may increase or decrease the frequencies of these reactions. One study has shown the allergic reaction rate to be about 3.0% over 359 courses of therapy. Of the allergic reactions, skin rashes, eosinophilia and drug fever were the most common, while serious reactions were less common.

Sulfamethoxazole is contraindicated in people with a known hypersensitivity to trimethoprim or sulfonamides.

== Mechanism of action ==
Sulfamethoxazole, a sulfanilamide, is a structural analog of &quot;para&quot;-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). They compete with PABA to bind to dihydropteroate synthetase and inhibit conversion of PABA and dihydropteroate diphosphate to dihydrofolic acid, or dihydrofolate. Inhibiting the production of dihydrofolate intermediate interferes with the normal bacterial synthesis of folic acid (folate). Folate is an essential metabolite for bacterial growth and replication because it is used in DNA synthesis, primarily at thymidylate and purine biosynthesis, and amino acids synthesis, including serine, glycine and methionine. Hence, blockage of folate production inhibits the folate-dependent metabolic processes for bacterial growth. Since it inhibits bacterial growth, sulfamethoxazole is considered a bacteriostatic antibiotic.
Sulfonamides are selective against bacteria because they interfere with the synthesis of folate, a process which does not occur in humans. Humans do not synthesize folate, and must acquire it through diet.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Absorption

Sulfamethoxazole is well-absorbed when administered topically. It is rapidly absorbed when it is orally administered.

Distribution

Sulfamethoxazole distributes into most body tissues as well as into sputum, vaginal fluid, and middle ear fluid. It also crosses the placenta. About 70% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins. Its Tmax (or time to reach maximum drug concentration in plasma) occurs 1 to 4 hours after oral administration. The mean serum half-life of sulfamethoxazole is 10 hours. However, the half-life of the drug noticeably increases in people with creatinine clearance rates equal to or less than 30 mL/minute. A half-life of 22–50 hours has been reported for people with creatinine clearances of less than 10 mL/minute.

Metabolism

Sulfamethoxazole is metabolized in the human liver to at least 5 metabolites. These metabolites are the N4-acetyl-, N4-hydroxy-, 5-methylhydroxy-, N4-acetyl-5-methylhydroxy-sulfamethoxazole metabolites, and an N-glucuronide conjugate. The CYP2C9 enzyme is responsible for the formation of the N4-hydroxy metabolite. In vitro studies suggest sulfamethoxazole is not a substrate of the P-glycoprotein transporter.

Excretion

Sulfamethoxazole is primarily renally excreted via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. About 20% of the sulfamethoxazole in urine is the unchanged drug, about 15–20% is the N-glucuronide conjugate, and about 50–70 % is the acetylated metabolite. Sulfamethoxazole is also excreted in human milk.

<text>Elizabeth Russell, Duchess of Bedford VA (&quot;née&quot; Sackville-West; 23 September 1818 – 22 April 1897) was the daughter of the 5th Earl De La Warr and his wife Lady Elizabeth Sackville.

==Early life==
She was baptised as Elizabeth West on 18 October 1818 at Bourn, Cambridgeshire, the abode was given as the family home at Bourn Hall.

==Marriage and issue==
Lady Elizabeth Sackville-West was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on 10 February 1840.

In Buckhurst Park on 18 January 1844 she was married to Francis Russell, a grandson of the late 6th Duke of Bedford and nephew of Lord John Russell, the Whig politician and future Prime Minister. Francis Russell succeeded his cousin as 9th Duke of Bedford in 1872.

Elizabeth was appointed Mistress of the Robes to the Queen by Mr Gladstone in 1880, and served in that capacity until 1883. In 1886, Gladstone&#x27;s policy of Home Rule had alienated many of the aristocrats in the Liberal Party, and no lady of suitable (i.e., ducal) rank could be found who was willing to serve as Mistress of the Robes. The Duchess of Bedford performed the duties of the office for the duration of the ministry, but was not appointed to the post by Gladstone.

She was widowed in 1891 after the Duke committed suicide. She died, aged 78, at Latimer House, near Chesham, Buckinghamshire, in 1897 and, after cremation at Woking Crematorium, her ashes were buried in the &#x27;Bedford Chapel&#x27; at St. Michael&#x27;s Church, Chenies, Buckinghamshire.

On 18 April 1839, she was married to Lord Douro, eldest son of the famous general and former Tory Prime Minister the 1st Duke of Wellington. Lord Douro succeeded his father as second duke of Wellington in 1852. In 1863 she also became countess of Mornington when her husband inherited the earldom of Mornington on the death of his cousin William Pole-Tylney-Long-Wellesley, 5th Earl of Mornington.

The Duchess of Wellington was appointed Mistress of the Robes to Queen Victoria in 1861 by the Liberal Prime Minister Lord Palmerston, and continued in that role until 1868, serving through the governments of Lord Russell, Lord Derby and Benjamin Disraeli. She was again Mistress of the Robes in Disraeli&#x27;s second government, 1874 to 1880.

Her husband died on 13 August 1884, and the Dowager Duchess survived him for exactly twenty years to the day, dying at Burhill Park, Walton-on-Thames on 13 August 1904. They had no children, and the marriage, which had been arranged by their respective families, was not a happy one; the historian Norman Gash writes, however, that her father-in-law &quot;found much domestic pleasure&quot; in Elizabeth&#x27;s company.

The Duchess of Wellington was a Third Class recipient of the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert during Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign.

<text>La 2 (, &quot;The Two&quot;) is a Spanish free-to-air television channel owned and operated by Televisión Española (TVE), the television division of state-owned public broadcaster Radiotelevisión Española (RTVE). It is the corporation&#x27;s second television channel, and is known for broadcasting cultural and public service programming, including documentaries, concerts, theatre and independent, Ibero-American and classic cinema.

It was launched on 15 November 1966 as the second regular television service in Spain right after TVE&#x27;s first channel launched on 28 October 1956. As TVE held a monopoly on television broadcasting in the country, they were the only television channels until the first regional public television station was launched on 16 February 1983, when Euskal Telebista started broadcasting in the Basque Country. Commercial television was launched on 25 January 1990, when Antena 3 started broadcasting nationwide.

As it started broadcasting on UHF frequencies the channel was initially simply referred to as &quot;UHF&quot;. It received other names, such as &quot;Cadena II&quot;, &quot;Segunda Cadena&quot;, &quot;Segundo Programa&quot; or &quot;TVE2&quot; until it adopted its current name &quot;La 2&quot; (&quot;La dos&quot;) during the 1990s. Its headquarters and main production center is Prado del Rey in Pozuelo de Alarcón with some programs produced in TVE&#x27;s production center in San Cugat del Vallés. Although almost all its programming is in Spanish and is the same for all of Spain, TVE has territorial centers in every autonomous community and produces and broadcasts some local programming in regional variations in each of them in the corresponding co-official language.

== History ==
=== Creation of &#x27;The second channel&#x27; ===
In the 1960s, the Spanish minister of Information and Tourism, Manuel Fraga Iribarne, decided that Televisión Española should start broadcasting a second television channel on the UHF band, following other European broadcasters that did the same. On 1 January 1965, TVE&#x27;s second television service was launched in Madrid as a test broadcast, with programming limited to 4 hours at night that consisted of musical slots and re-airings of TV shows from Primera Cadena, mostly &quot;Telediario&quot; newscasts and &quot;Estudio 1&quot;.

Regular broadcasts started on 15 November 1966. TVE started producing original programming for the channel, mainly produced at the broadcaster&#x27;s headquarters in Barcelona. UHF&#x27;s first director was Salvador Pons Muñoz. In its first years, the channel could only be received in Madrid, Zaragoza and Barcelona, cities in which the UHF technology was implemented; it only aired at night and not all TV sets could tune in. Most TVs could not receive UHF broadcasts, so a UHF converter was needed.

As TVE&#x27;s strategy evolved into turning the first channel into a generalist channel, niche programming was moved to UHF. Under the Salvador Pons administration, the second channel received artists from the country&#x27;s Official Film School (), such as Claudio Guerin, Pedro Olea or Antonio Mercero, people who would use the channel as a test zone to air alternative programming, such as documentaries or fiction shows. There was a high share of cultural programmes, like classical music blocks or theatre slots.

=== 1970s ===
During the &#x27;70s, the channel&#x27;s programming was restricted to air at night (from 20:00 to 00:00), with an extension in the weekends. Coverage reached the main cities of Spain, but although TVE pointed out that only &quot;three years&quot; would pass before UHF could be tuned in all Spain, the second channel could not get it until 1982. For this reason it was not strange that successful programs on UHF passed to the first channel.

The UHF station continued to develop a minority programming, with a strong cultural emphasis, which did not compete directly with TVE-1. In addition to documentaries, theater broadcasts and dramas, the second channel also was at time broadcasting sports events and educational programming. At that time, the second channel was colloquially dubbed &quot;el canalillo.&quot;

During the Spanish transition, the programming of the second channel received a small boost. In January 1976 debuted the program of debate &quot;La Clave&quot; (1976-1985), which addressed current issues from different points of view, something very complicated during the Francoism, preceded by a film related to the subject. Another important program was &quot;A fondo (In depth)&quot; (1976-1981), a talk show presented by Joaquín Soler Serrano which discussed with personalities from the artistic, literary and scientific fields of the time. On the other hand, the new artistic and musical trends were reflected in &quot;Encuentros con las artes y las letras (Encounters with the arts and the lyrics)&quot; (1976-1981) and &quot;Popgrama&quot; (1979-1981).

Another important aspect was the consolidation of the station&#x27;s regional broadcasting centres, most importantly in Catalonia and the Canary Islands. TVE Cataluña started producing and broadcasting regional programming in opt-outs through the &quot;Circuit Català&quot; (Catalan circuit), while continuing to produce content for nationwide broadcasts. On the eve of the 1982 World Cup held in Spain, the Canary Islands regional broadcasting centre erected a new production office that, in addition to broadcasting the Second channel, allowed to develop dedicated programming for the archipelago.

=== 1980s ===
In 1983, the second channel was renamed &quot;TVE-2&quot; with a new corporate image. The schedule was not consolidated until the end of the decade.

In the mandates of and Pilar Miró, TVE-2 continued to be a cultural channel that accommodated spaces not appropriate for the first channel. In the midst of the Movida Madrileña phenomenon, it premiered &quot;La Edad de Oro (The Golden Age)&quot; (1983), directed and presented by , that with time it turned into a cult classic. The 1980s also marked the premiere of emblematic programs such as the cultural magazine &quot;Metropoli&quot; (1985), the game show &quot;El tiempo es oro (Time is money)&quot; (1987) presented by Constantino Romero and &quot;Con las manos en la masa (Hands on the bat)&quot; (1984), directed and presented by Elena Santonja, considered the first cooking show in Spanish television history.

On the other hand, TVE-2 retained the broadcast of special events live, some of which exceeded in the audience the first channel: the European football competitions (UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup and Cup Winners&#x27; Cup), the Spanish First Division in communities without autonomic television, the qualifying matches of the Spain national football team, and the Eurovision Song Contest from 1984 to 1992.

In 1984, it premiered &quot;Estadio 2&quot;, specializing in sports broadcasts, information, and a live results service during the weekends.

=== Creation of &quot;La 2&quot; ===
The channel strategy of TVE changed with the emergence and suddened popularity of private television in 1989, with the first airing of Antena 3 and Tele 5 As of 1991, TVE-2 was remamed into &quot;La 2&quot; and assumed a new alternative programming, whose spirit was included in the slogan «&quot;La 2, para una inmensa minoría&quot;» (&quot;La 2, for a huge minority&quot;). The following director of TVE, Ramón Colom, would redefine the concept towards a smaller target audience aged 30 years old.

In the 90s there was a significant increase in own programming, giving La 2 its personality. All documentaries, including &quot;Documentos TV&quot;, presented by Pedro Erquicia, were moved to that signal. In addition, TVE promoted an alternative newsletter to &quot;Telediario&quot; with the creation of &quot;La 2 Noticias&quot;, specialized in the news of human, social, and ecological interest in exchange for reducing the weight of the policy in the blocks. The new format was premiered on 7 November 1994 and thanks to it two journalists rose to fame: Lorenzo Milá (presenter) and Fran Llorente (news director).

In addition, La 2 issued US series with no place on La Primera: &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (until 1993), &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot; and &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot;. As for sports broadcasts, football was transferred to the first channel while the second was left with the rights of the Liga ACB of basketball, the Liga Asobal of handball and the LNFS. Although the channel&#x27;s audience fell by private competition, these changes served to improve its reputation and turn it into an alternative to conventional programming.
The strategy remained unchanged until 2004, with new programs that have been part of the backbone of La 2. In 1996 began the space of scientific disclosure &quot;Redes&quot;, directed by Eduard Punset, and in 1997 premiered &quot;Saber y ganar&quot;, presented by Jordi Hurtado, who became the longest-running game show in Spanish television. One year later was launched &quot;Versión española (Spanish version)&quot;, Spanish film program presented by Cayetana Guillén Cuervo and that offered films without advertising breaks. Other important spaces were &quot;La noche temática (The thematic night)&quot; (documentary block of the pan-European channel Arte), the literary space &quot;Negro sobre blanco (Black on white)&quot;, the informative &quot;Escuela del deporte (School of sport)&quot; and the containers of infantile programming, among them &quot;Con mucha marcha (With a lot of march)&quot;, &quot;TPH Club&quot;, &quot;Hyakutake&quot; and &quot;Los Lunnis&quot;, the latter one of his greatest commercial successes.

=== Present day ===
In 2004, changes were made in the strategy of La 2: information services are remodeled because Fran Llorente, presenter of La 2 Noticias, is chosen news director of TVE, while Lorenzo Milá became the host of Telediario of La 1. The new direction redirects the offer to the young public, with the advance of primetime at 9:30 p.m., the gradual disappearance of regional programming (except for a few blocks in Catalonia and Canary Islands) and the entry of series American as &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, &quot;The OC&quot; or &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;.

On 1 June 2010, the Board of Directors of RTVE made La 2 into a strictly cultural channel, positioning it as the reference for creativity and talent. From that same month, La 2 stopped broadcasting its sports programming (which moved to La 1 and Teledeporte) and infantile (which continued exclusively on Clan). Instead, it introduced cultural programming from the channel Cultural·es. In addition, an address was created for the channel, and its management was moved from Torrespaña to the center of TVE Cataluña in San Cugat del Vallés, Barcelona. Since 2014, primetime is covered by Spanish cinema cycles from Monday to Friday, and European films on weekends. The audience of La 2 has dropped to 2.6% audience share, similar to the children&#x27;s channel Clan.

=== La 2 HD ===
On 7 September 2017, during the presentation of the new season of the channel, Televisión Española announced the launch of the high definition signal of La 2, which started issuing 31 October 2017 in Madrid, 7 November 2017 in the rest of Spain (except Catalonia and Canary Islands), 14 November 2017 in Catalonia and 21 November 2017 in Canary Islands. With standard-definition feed discontinued on 11 February 2024, it has only been available in HD ever since.

<text>Daebu Island () is an island in the Yellow Sea, within the municipal borders of the city of Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea.

==Geography==
The island has a population of roughly 7,114 people and an area of 41.98 km². Administratively, the island today is divided into five &quot;dong&quot;: Daebubuk-dong (), Daebunam-dong (), Daebudong-dong (), Seongam-dong () and Pungdo-dong (). The predominant industries are tourism and fishing.

The island is connected (via Seongam-do and Tan-do) to the mainland in the south-east by road bridges, to Hyeong-do () (and thence the mainland) in the north-east by several routes due to land reclamation efforts, and to Seonjae-do () (and thence Yeongheung Island () and others) to the west by a further road bridge.

===Environment===
Due to rising mudflats, the island has merged with neighbouring Seongam-do () and Tan-do (). It is a Ramsar site and has also been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because its intertidal mudflats support significant populations of breeding Chinese egrets, as well as of dunlins and common greenshanks on passage.

==History==

During the Goryeo and Joseon Dynasties, Daebu Island was included in the old jurisdiction of Namyang. On March 1, 1914, it was transferred to Bucheon, and on July 1, 1973 responsibility was transferred to Ongjin County (which later became part of Incheon). On December 26, 1994 the island was moved into the jurisdiction of Ansan, where it remains today.

==Education==
Daebu Island has three kindergartens, three elementary schools, one middle school and a high school. The island (specifically Seongam-do) is also home to the Gyeonggi English Village&#x27;s Ansan Camp, an immersion village for students from Gyeonggi Province.

<text>Anne Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland VA (&quot;née&quot; Hay-Mackenzie; 21 April 1829 – 25 November 1888), 1st Countess of Cromartie in her own right and known as the Marchioness of Stafford from 1849 to 1861, was a British peeress.

==Early life==
Anne Hay-Mackenzie was born on 21 April 1829. She was the only child of John Hay-Mackenzie of Newhall and Cromarty and the former Anne Craig.

Her mother was the third daughter of Sir James Gibson-Craig, 1st Baronet. Her father was the eldest son and heir of Edward Hay-Mackenzie of Newhall and the former Hon. Maria Murray-Mackenzie of Cromartie (eldest daughter and heiress of line of George Murray-Mackenzie, 6th Lord Elibank and Lady Isabella Mackenzie, eldest daughter and heiress of line of George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie, who took part in the Jacobite rising of 1745 and was attainted in 1746). His grandfather was also the younger brother of George Hay, 7th Marquess of Tweeddale.

==Countess of Cromartie==
On 21 October 1861, the title held by her great-great-grandfather, George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie, was revived when the Duchess of Sutherland was created, in her own right, Baroness Castlehaven, of Castlehaven, Baroness Macleod, of Castle Leod, Viscountess Tarbat, of Tarbat, all in the County of Cromarty, and Countess of Cromartie, all with remainder firstly to Francis Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, her second surviving son, and the heirs male of his body, secondly to each of her younger sons in like manner in priority of birth, thirdly to said Francis Sutherland-Leveson-Gower and the heirs of his body, fourthly to each other her younger sons in like manner in priority of birth, fifthly to her daughter Florence Sutherland-Leveson-Gower and the heirs of her body, and sixthly to each other of her daughters in like manner in priority of birth &quot;provided that if the said Francis Sutherland-Leveson-Gower or any other person taking under the said letters patent shall succeed to the Earldom of Sutherland, and there shall upon or at any time after the occurrence of such event be any other younger son or other daughter of the said Anne, Duchess of Sutherland, or any heir of the body of such other son or daughter, then, and so often as the same may happen, the succession to the honours and dignities thereby created shall devolve on the son or daughter of the said Anne, or their heirs, who would be next entitled to succeed to the said honours if the person so succeeding to the Earldom of Sutherland were dead without issue.&quot;

She later served as Mistress of the Robes to Queen Victoria from 1870 to 1874, and was awarded the Order of Victoria and Albert (3rd class).

==Personal life==

On 27 June 1849 she married George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Marquess of Stafford, eldest son of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland. He succeeded as third Duke of Sutherland on 22 February 1861. The Duchess of Sutherland had succeeded to her father&#x27;s lands in the year of her marriage. Together, they had five children:

* George Granville Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Earl Gower (1850–1858), who died young.
* Cromartie Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 4th Duke of Sutherland (1851–1913)
* Francis Mackenzie Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl of Cromartie (1852–1893)
* Lady Florence Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (1855–1881), who married Henry Chaplin, 1st Viscount Chaplin and had issue.
* Lady Alexandra Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (1866–1891), who died unmarried.

She died at the family&#x27;s London mansion, Stafford House, St James&#x27;s, and was buried at the Extra Mural Cemetery (now Barton Road Cemetery or &quot;The Old Cemetery&quot;), Torquay in section D (grid ref: 50.484307, -3.542972). An ornate cross mounted on a three step plinth has the following inscriptions: In Loving Memory of Anne (top step). Duchess of Sutherland Countess of Cromartie Wife of George Granville Third Duke of Sutherland Born 21 April 1829 Died 25 November 1888 (middle step). For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith (bottom step). She had been a devout worshipper at All Saints Church, Babbacombe and her internment was presided over by the church&#x27;s first incumbent, Father John Hewett, a personal friend of the Duchess. On her death she was succeeded in her earldom according to the special remainder by her younger son Lord Francis. The Duke of Sutherland died in 1892 and was succeeded by their eldest surviving son Cromartie.

<doc id="1208583" wikidata="Q463454" url="?curid=1208583" title="Steve Rothery">
<text>Steven Rothery (born 25 November 1959) is an English musician who is the original guitarist and the longest continuous member of the progressive rock band Marillion. Outside Marillion, Rothery has recorded two albums as part of the duo The Wishing Tree and an instrumental solo album, &quot;The Ghosts of Pripyat&quot;, released in September 2014. He also founded the British Guitar Academy in 2011.

==Biography==
Rothery was born in Brampton Bierlow, near Barnsley then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, and from the age of six he lived in Whitby, North Yorkshire. He began to play the guitar at the age of 15. In an interview for Johnnie Walker&#x27;s &quot;Sounds of the Seventies&quot; on BBC Radio 2 in 2013, Rothery revealed that his musical tastes always differed from his friends, who were getting into punk rock while he preferred progressive rock, which he had been introduced to through the Alan Freeman show on BBC Radio 1.

=== Marillion ===

In 1979, he saw an ad in the music press for a band called Silmarillion that needed a guitarist. He auditioned successfully for the band (19 August 1979). From this point he concentrated more on melody, composition and mood in his playing, and less on his technique. Later, Silmarillion shortened its name to Marillion.

=== Outside Marillion ===

==== The Wishing Tree ====
As well as work with Marillion, he started a solo project under the name The Wishing Tree (with Hannah Stobart providing vocals), and released two albums titled &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; (1996) and &quot;Ostara&quot; (2009).

==== The British Guitar Academy ====
In 2011, Rothery launched the British Guitar Academy &quot;to bring together some of Britain&#x27;s top guitarists to pass on their hard won knowledge and experience to a wider audience through a series of workshops and masterclasses. The aim is to concentrate not just on technique but also creativity and individuality.&quot;

==== Solo album &quot;The Ghosts of Pripyat&quot; (2014) ====
Rothery had been approached by EMI to make a solo album during the recording of Marillion&#x27;s &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; (1985) and by Miles Copeland when Marillion were recording &quot;Brave &quot;in his castle in France in 1994; he decided to join with Stobart and form The Wishing Tree instead.

On 25 November 2013, Rothery announced that he was working on a solo album to be titled &quot;The Ghosts of Pripyat&quot; and scheduled for a September 2014 release. The album&#x27;s production was financed via the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter and quickly reached almost double its target by 17 December. The idea for the album was born when Rothery was rehearsing for a show at the annual international guitar festival in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, in October 2013, with a band including guitarist Dave Foster (of Mr. So &amp; So), drummer Leon Parr (formerly of Mosque), and bassist Yatim Halimi (of Panic Room). An audio recording of the show was made available as a download from Rothery&#x27;s website as a first impression of the forthcoming album&#x27;s direction, followed by a CD in February 2014. Steve Hackett (ex-Genesis) appears on two tracks and Steven Wilson on one. The album&#x27;s cover was designed by Lasse Hoile. The finished album was released on 22 September 2014.

==Influences and style==

Rothery has described his own style on the guitar as a mix of Andrew Latimer, Steve Hackett and David Gilmour. He has also cited Joni Mitchell as an influence, especially her use of open tunings, which he believed created a very harmonically rich sound. He has cited Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;A Case of You&quot; as one of the songs that had the biggest influence on him. Rothery added: &quot;I was also really influenced by George Harrison—the lesson there being to play just what’s right for the song.&quot; According to Rothery: &quot;When I was growing up, I was always drawn to players who had an atmospheric and emotional quality to their sound... I think the guitar has the power to communicate emotionally more than any other instrument, and you’re short-changing yourself if you focus on technique at the cost of emotion. You have to listen with your heart, as well as your ears.&quot;

Barry Cleveland of &quot;Guitar Player&quot; stated that Rothery &quot;specializes in crafting lush sonic atmospheres with layered guitars and effects processing&quot;. Rothery was hailed by Scott Kahn, the Editor in Chief &amp; CEO of the website &quot;MusicPlayers.com&quot;, as one of the great progressive rock guitarists, comparing him favourably with John Petrucci, David Gilmour and Alex Lifeson. Kahn described him as &quot;an incredibly talented player&quot;, whose tone &quot;is sure to appeal to fans of diverse guitar sounds&quot;, with &quot;guitars drenched in shimmering chorus, sparkling delays and cavernous reverbs&quot;, &quot;spacey sounds and blues sections&quot; as well as &quot;acoustic rhythms that anchor the melodies.&quot; Kahn identified Rothery as having &quot;three distinct trademark sounds&quot;: a &quot;sparkling clean arpeggio tone draped in digital delays&quot;, &quot;soaring melodic lead tones&quot; and a &quot;classic blues tone.&quot; Kahn said Rothery was &quot;never one to go for major flash, he always plays for the song and not his ego, but when he shines, he shines brightly.&quot;

Rothery&#x27;s process for creating his guitar solos is improvisation. He was quoted: &quot;That has always been the way I’ve done things, and some of my favourite leads—such as &#x27;Sugar Mice&#x27;, &#x27;Easter&#x27;, and the last break in &#x27;This Strange Engine&#x27;—were composed on the spot.&quot;

In 2001, Rothery was voted Yorkshire and Humberside&#x27;s best guitarist in a poll in &quot;Total Guitar&quot; magazine with 65% of the vote, beating David Bowie&#x27;s Ziggy Stardust-era guitarist Mick Ronson into second place.

===Equipment===
In the 1980s, Rothery used various guitars, including a Yamaha SG-2000 and Fender or Squier Strats. For amps, he employed Marshall amps, for overdriven sounds, and Roland Jazz Chorus 120 amps for more effects laden sounds. When interviewed in 2010, he mentioned using a Blade Stratocaster-style guitar with Lindy Fralin pickups, and a signature model by luthier Jack Dent. His guitars are equipped with MIDI. He makes extensive use of loops, via a setup that includes TC Electronic 2290 Dynamic Digital Delays, an AdrenaLinn III, and a variety of other effects all routed through controller made by Gig-Rig.

On 8 November 2017, Rothery was presented with his new Blade RH-4 signature guitar by guitar manufacturer Gary Levinson at a promotional event in the Albert Halls in Bolton.

<text>Barrett is the second and final studio album of new material released by former Pink Floyd frontman Syd Barrett. Recording began at Abbey Road Studios on 26 February 1970, and lasted for 15 sessions until 21 July. The album was produced by Pink Floyd&#x27;s David Gilmour and Richard Wright, who also contributed on bass and keyboards respectively, along with previous &quot;Madcap&quot; contributor Jerry Shirley on drums.

&quot;Barrett&quot; was released in November 1970 on Harvest in the United Kingdom, but unlike his debut LP &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; it failed to chart; it was re-released in 1974 as part of &quot;Syd Barrett&quot;, which was the first US issues of these LPs. No singles were issued from the album. It was remastered and reissued in 1993, along with Barrett&#x27;s other albums − &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; (1970) and &quot;Opel&quot; (1988) − independently and as part of the &quot;Crazy Diamond&quot; box set. A newly remastered version was released in 2010.

==Background==
The initial sales and the critical and public reaction to Barrett&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot;, were deemed sufficient and enthusiastic enough by EMI to sanction a second solo album by Barrett. On 24 February 1970, a month after releasing &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot;, Barrett appeared on John Peel&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; radio show, where he performed only one song from the newly released album (&quot;Terrapin&quot;), three that would later be recorded for &quot;Barrett&quot; (&quot;Gigolo Aunt&quot;, &quot;Baby Lemonade&quot; and &quot;Effervescing Elephant&quot;), and a one-off (&quot;Two of a Kind&quot;, which was written by Richard Wright). The session producers had no verbal contact with Barrett, having communication with him only via Gilmour. For the radio session, Gilmour and Humble Pie drummer Jerry Shirley accompanied Barrett on bass and bongos, respectively. The version of &quot;Gigolo Aunt&quot; recorded for the radio session (and later released on 1988&#x27;s &quot;The Peel Session&quot;) was unfinished, as Barrett had sung the opening verse three times. Barrett played slide guitar on the radio version of &quot;Baby Lemonade&quot;, with Gilmour on organ.

Two days later, he began working on his second album in Abbey Road Studios, with Gilmour as producer, and a trio of musicians: Richard Wright, Shirley and Gilmour. The main aim for the &quot;Barrett&quot; sessions was to give Barrett the structure and focus many felt was missing during the long and unwieldy sessions for &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot;. Thus, the sessions were more efficiently run and the album was finished in considerably less time than &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; (six months, compared to &quot;Madcap&quot;&#x27;s one year). On 6 June 1970, Barrett gave his one and only official solo performance, at the Olympia in Kensington, backed once more by Gilmour and Shirley. At the end of &quot;Octopus&quot;, the fourth number of the set, Barrett baffled the audience and his backing musicians by abruptly taking off his guitar and walking off stage.

==Recording==
According to Jerry Shirley, &quot;What David Gilmour wanted (and tried) to do, unlike the first record The Madcap Laughs, was have a unified rhythm section that played the entire record like any band would do. Which meant me on drums, David on bass, Rick Wright on keyboards, and Syd on ALL guitars, and that was something Dave was adamant about.&quot; The first session was on 26 February, three of the first songs—fully recorded—attempted during the session were &quot;Baby Lemonade&quot;, &quot;Maisie&quot; and &quot;Gigolo Aunt&quot;. However, Gilmour thought they were losing the &quot;Barrett-ness&quot;. After &quot;Baby Lemonade&quot; was attempted, 2 takes of &quot;Maisie&quot; were recorded before Barrett went into 15 takes of &quot;Gigolo Aunt&quot;. Jerry Shirley had commented on the final take of &quot;Gigolo Aunt&quot;: &quot;I was quite happy with &#x27;Gigolo Aunt&#x27;, Syd had played his parts so &#x27;correctly&#x27; that I can remember at the end of the take we were flabbergasted. It was like we were thinking &#x27;you&#x27;re not that nuts afterall, you almost got through this take perfectly!&#x27;&quot; The next day, two-track demos of &quot;Wolfpack&quot;, &quot;Waving My Arms in the Air&quot;, &quot;Living Alone&quot; and &quot;Bob Dylan Blues&quot;, were recorded. The former two made it to the album; the latter two didn&#x27;t. On the recording sheet, it lists Gilmour as having taken home a copy of the latter two, Gilmour later returned and took the master tapes too. Gilmour has since said &quot;Those sessions were done so quickly. We were rushing to gigs every day and had to fit recording sessions in between. I probably took it away to have a listen and simply forgot to take it back. It wasn&#x27;t intended to be a final mix. Syd knocked it off, I took a tape home.&quot; Despite some minor work made to &quot;Gigolo Aunt&quot;, Barrett wouldn&#x27;t return to Abbey Road Studios until 1 April, due to Pink Floyd working on their 1970 album, &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;. On various occasions, Barrett would &quot;spy&quot; on the band as they recorded the album. Again, Barrett recorded some work to a song, &quot;Wolfpack&quot;, on the 3rd, before the sessions were postponed until 5 June, this time due to Gilmour and Wright going on tour in the US with Pink Floyd.

On the session of 5 June, Barrett managed to record an unknown number of two-track demos for three songs: &quot;Rats&quot;, &quot;Wined and Dined&quot;, and &quot;Birdie Hop&quot;. The &quot;Rats&quot; demo recorded here, became the basis for the album master, and would later be overdubbed by musicians, despite the changing tempos. Two days later, on the 7th, Barrett recorded &quot;Milky Way&quot;, &quot;Millionaire&quot;, before being rounded off with overdubs for &quot;Rats&quot;. &quot;Millionaire&quot; was originally titled &quot;She Was a Millionaire&quot;, and was originally recorded by Pink Floyd. Barrett recorded two attempts at a backing track before abandoning it, and adding vocals. Yet another break in recording occurred, until 14 July, where Barrett recorded several takes of &quot;Effervescing Elephant&quot;, while numerous overdubs were added to Barrett&#x27;s &quot;Wined and Dined&quot; demo by Gilmour. Three takes of &quot;Dominoes&quot; ensued, with an unknown number of takes of &quot;Love Song&quot;, &quot;Dolly Rocker&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Split&quot; were recorded. &quot;Love Song&quot; and &quot;Dolly Rocker&quot; were both overdubbed, the former being overdubbed from 17 to 21 July, but overdubs for the latter were wiped. On 21 July, Barrett worked on another Untitled track (later to be titled as &quot;Word Song&quot;), recording only one take, before recording 5 takes of the last new song to be recorded for &quot;Barrett&quot;: &quot;It Is Obvious&quot;. Barrett worked on remakes of two tracks: &quot;Maisie&quot;, and &quot;Waving My Arms in the Air&quot; (the latter now segueing into a new track, &quot;I Never Lied to You&quot;).

Shirley said of Barrett&#x27;s playing: &quot;He would never play the same tune twice. Sometimes Syd couldn&#x27;t play anything that made sense; other times what he&#x27;d play was absolute magic.&quot; Barrett&#x27;s direction to the other musicians were limited to pronouncements like &quot;Perhaps we could make the middle darker and maybe the end a bit middle afternoonish. At the moment it&#x27;s too windy and icy&quot;.

==Songs==
Animals are a recurring item in not only the album, but Barrett&#x27;s entire solo output.

===Side one===
&quot;Baby Lemonade&quot; opens the album. The intro was actually Barrett simply warming-up on guitar, that Gilmour had managed to record and placed it at the start of the album, making it seem like an intro to the song. The lyrics that describe the way for a person to kill time (such as the line &quot;In the clock they sent / Through a washing machine&quot;). The solo was performed by Barrett, not Gilmour as is often noted. A recurring theme in the album, starting with &quot;Baby Lemonade&quot;, is the weather. Barrett performed the song twice, both times for the BBC (previously recorded on 24 February 1970, for John Peel&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot;, and later for Bob Harris&#x27; show on 16 February 1971).

&quot;Love Song&quot; tells the story of an ex-girlfriend fondly remembered (&quot;I knew a girl and I like her still&quot;). It is the first of two songs which feature dreamlike-senses in the lyrics (&quot;I&#x27;ll lay my head down and see what I see&quot;). Barrett performed the song for Bob Harris&#x27; show in 1971.

&quot;Dominoes&quot; features imagery of regret and recollection in the lyrics. The song features a backwards guitar solo by Barrett, and organ and Wurlitzer by Wright. The song&#x27;s &quot;You and I&quot; lyric refers to the tail end relationship Barrett had with Lindsay. The first of three songs on the album which lyrics point to anguish (&quot;In my tears, my dreams&quot;). Barrett performed the song for Bob Harris&#x27; show in 1971.

&quot;It Is Obvious&quot; is the second of two songs which feature dreamlike-senses in the lyrics (&quot;Creep into bed when your head&#x27;s on the ground&quot;). It is also the second of three songs on the album which lyrics point to anguish (&quot;Remember those times I could call / Through the clear day time / And you would be there&quot;). The theme of weather is referenced again (&quot;The softness, the warmth and the weather in suspense&quot;). The song also references the Cambridge quarry pits, and the landscape.

&quot;Rats&quot; started off as a jam, but eventually evolved into a structured song. It contains taunting and maniacal lyrics (&quot;Rats rats lay down flat / We don&#x27;t need you we act like that&quot;).

&quot;Maisie&quot; is a blues jam, with Barrett muttering the lyrics.

===Side two===
&quot;Gigolo Aunt&quot; was performed by Barrett for &quot;Top Gear&quot; in 1970, and issued on &quot;The Peel Session&quot; EP. For Barrett&#x27;s only solo performance, at the Kensington Olympia in 1970, he played four songs, one of them being &quot;Gigolo Aunt&quot;.

&quot;Waving My Arms in the Air&quot; contains an echo of &quot;Octopus&quot; (&quot;Waving my arms in the air / Pressing my feet to the ground&quot;). The lyrics refer to a hard-learned experience. The song features a childlike section (&quot;No care / No no&quot;). The song segues into &quot;I Never Lied to You&quot; with the aid of Wright&#x27;s organ.

&quot;I Never Lied to You&quot; is the final of three songs on the album which lyrics point to anguish (&quot;It&#x27;s been so hard to bear with you not there&quot;).

&quot;Wined and Dined&quot; dated from Barrett&#x27;s Cambridge days, and is about the relationship between Barrett and his then-girlfriend, Gayla Pinion, a model from Cambridge. The song reflects on about Mediterranean evenings (&quot;&quot;Musk winds blow&quot;), and hauntings of Barrett&#x27;s childhood (&quot;Chalk underfoot / Light ash of blue&quot;&quot;) evoked during a summer party he didn&#x27;t want to leave. Dave Gilmour added a sinuous sliding lead over Barrett&#x27;s vocals.

&quot;Wolfpack&quot; had been mentioned by Barrett in an interview, he said the song was one of favourites, out of all his material.

&quot;Effervescing Elephant&quot; was pastiche of the verse form of Hilaire Belloc&#x27;s &quot;Cautionary Tales for Children&quot;. In contrast to &quot;Dominoes&quot;, &quot;It Is Obvious&quot;, &quot;Rats&quot;, &quot;Waving My Arms in the Air&quot;, and &quot;Wolfpack&quot; previously mentioning one or two animals, &quot;Effervescing Elephant&quot; contains references to a whole jungle full of animals. Barrett performed the song for &quot;Top Gear&quot; in 1970. For Barrett&#x27;s only solo performance, at the Kensington Olympia in 1970, he played four songs, one of them being &quot;Effervescing Elephant&quot;.

==Release and aftermath==

The cover of the album was designed by Barrett; it was originally one of many drawings Barrett had done in Cambridge, years earlier. &quot;Barrett&quot; was released in November 1970 to less interest than had greeted &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; earlier in the year, and as a result, failed to reach the chart. Talks of more singles and a third album were rumoured over the following months. Barrett dismissed the album and &quot;Madcap&quot;, saying: &quot;They&#x27;ve got to reach a certain standard and that&#x27;s probably reached in &quot;Madcap&quot; once or twice and on the other one only a little – just an echo of that. Neither of them are much more than that.&quot; Allmusic reviewer Ritchie Unterberger called the album &quot;a bit fuller and smoother than the first album&quot;, referring to &quot;Baby Lemonade&quot;, &quot;Gigolo Aunt&quot;, and &quot;Effervescing Elephant&quot; as &quot;among his peppiest and best-loved tunes&quot;; however, &quot;the tone is darker and more meandering&quot; in the rest of the album. In an overview of Barrett&#x27;s career, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; referred to both Barrett&#x27;s solo albums as &quot;entrancing&quot;.

On 16 February 1971, Barrett recorded a short set for BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Sound of the Seventies&quot; radio show; in contrast to 1970&#x27;s radio appearance where Barrett performed new material, this time he played songs from &quot;Barrett&quot;: &quot;Baby Lemonade&quot;, &quot;Dominoes&quot; and &quot;Love Song&quot;. Bored and directionless, Barrett headed back to his hometown of Cambridge and – but for a brief dalliance with a band called Stars in 1972, and some abortive recording sessions in 1974 – left his music career behind for good.

The album was reissued in late 1974 with his first solo album &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; as record two of the two-record set &quot;Syd Barrett&quot; in Harvest&#x27;s series of Harvest Heritage reissues. In 1993, &quot;Barrett&quot; (along with &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; and &quot;Opel&quot;) was reissued both independently and as part of the &quot;Crazy Diamond&quot; Barrett box set, on 26 April 1993. &quot;Bob Dylan Blues&quot; would later turn up on 2001&#x27;s &quot;The Best of Syd Barrett: Wouldn&#x27;t You Miss Me?&quot;. A newly remastered version was released in 2010. For release on &quot;An Introduction to Syd Barrett&quot; in 2010, Gilmour laid down a new bass track to four songs, only one from &quot;Barrett&quot;: &quot;Dominoes&quot;.

<text>The Malkara (from an Aboriginal word for &quot;shield&quot;) was one of the earliest guided anti-tank missiles (ATGMs). It was jointly developed by Australia and the United Kingdom between 1951 and 1954, and was in service from 1958 until gradually replaced by the Vickers Vigilant missile in the late 1960s. It was intended to be light enough to deploy with airborne forces, yet powerful enough to knock out any tank then in service. The basic form was later adapted for the short-range surface-to-air role as the Seacat and influenced the development of the Ikara.

==Development and operations==
Design was principally undertaken at the Australian Government Aeronautical Research Laboratory, and this phase was also one of the first examples of computer simulation in engineering design. Development testing was carried out at Woomera Prohibited Area, and approval testing at the tank training range at Lulworth Cove, Dorset. Although testing at Dorset apparently achieved an impressive 90% Pkill, in service the missiles were not considered a great success, due to three principal failures:
* They were considered too heavy. As they were too heavy for manpacking, they could only be operated from their specialist vehicles, reducing flexibility; and
* Accuracy achieved in practice was poor. This may have been because the awkward control system required a lot of practice. Malkara had a training simulator integrated with the launch interface equipment. In their memoirs, some operators state that they only fired one missile in their careers.
*Finally, their speed was low, taking almost 30 seconds to reach maximum range.
However, lessons learned from the Malkara project led to improvements in later programs. In addition, the basic airframe and expertise were directly used in the development of the Ikara anti-submarine missile and the Sea Cat naval surface-to-air missile.

Malkara was unusual among anti-tank missiles in that it had a High-explosive squash head (HESH), also known as High Explosive Plastic (HEP), warhead instead of the more usual shaped charge HEAT (High Explosive Anti Tank) warhead. The United Kingdom always showed interest for HESH, the main explosive-based anti-tank ammunition in British use including contemporary tanks like the Centurion. A 26/27 kg anti-tank warhead was well above the average, but Malkara had a calibre of .

<doc id="1208592" wikidata="Q1184731" url="?curid=1208592" title="Elizabeth Campbell, Duchess of Argyll">
<text>Elizabeth Georgiana Campbell, Duchess of Argyll (&quot;née&quot; Leveson-Gower; 30 May 1824 – 25 May 1878), was a British noblewoman and abolitionist. Born into the wealthy Sutherland-Leveson-Gower family, she was the eldest daughter of the 2nd Duke of Sutherland by his wife, the political hostess Lady Harriet Howard. In 1844 Elizabeth married George Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, eldest son and heir to the 7th Duke of Argyll. She became the Duchess of Argyll in 1847 when her husband succeeded his father.

Like her mother, the Duchess of Argyll was a prominent opponent of slavery. The pair helped write a letter titled &quot;An Affectionate and Christian Address of Many Thousands of Women of Great Britain and Ireland to Their Sisters, the Women of the United States of America&quot;, calling for an end of slavery; it attracted signatures from 562,848 British women. The two often hosted the American abolitionist and author Harriet Beecher Stowe when she visited England. The Duchess and Beecher Stowe were friends and maintained a correspondence.

In 1868, the Duchess of Argyll succeeded the Duchess of Wellington as Mistress of the Robes to Queen Victoria, holding the position until 1870, when she resigned due to ill health. Soon after being appointed a member of the newly created Order of the Crown of India, she died in 1878 whilst eating with William Ewart Gladstone in London.

==Family and early life==
Lady Elizabeth Georgiana Leveson-Gower was raised amidst great wealth. Her paternal grandmother, the great heiress Elizabeth Gordon, was &quot;suo jure&quot; Countess of Sutherland, overseeing estates that spanned 800,000 to one million acres of Scottish Highlands. The Sutherland lands were further augmented with Gordon&#x27;s 1785 marriage to George Leveson-Gower (later 1st Duke of Sutherland). In 1823, their son George married Lady Harriet Howard, daughter of George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle. Lady Elizabeth Leveson-Gower was born the following year as their eldest daughter, on 30 May 1824. Three brothers and two sisters followed.

With family estates in Scotland and England, Elizabeth&#x27;s upbringing involved much travel. Their main residence was the lavish Stafford House, London, which they acquired in 1827; they also resided on many country estates. The couple, especially Harriet, led vibrant social lives. She was a political hostess known for her friendship and position as Mistress of the Robes to the young Queen Victoria. In 1833, the 1st Duke died and Elizabeth&#x27;s father succeeded as 2nd Duke of Sutherland, inheriting extensive property. The historian Eric Richards writes that the first half of the nineteenth century saw the height of the House of Sutherland&#x27;s social and economic influence, with its wealth being derived from rents, various stocks, and dividends from transportation firms.

==Marriage==

While accompanying Queen Victoria to Taymouth Castle in 1842, Lady Elizabeth met George Douglas Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, the eldest son of the 7th Duke of Argyll. They married at the Leveson-Gower estate Trentham Hall on 31 July 1844. The Archbishop of York, Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt, presided over the wedding. The Argyll estate was in debt, so Elizabeth&#x27;s wealth was much needed. Their union resulted in the further joining of two of Scotland&#x27;s largest landowning families.

The young couple was given Rosneath by his father at the time of their marriage. Deeply religious, Elizabeth had been raised in the Anglican faith but converted to the Church of Scotland upon her marriage, taking her first communion in the faith later that year. Like many of her predecessors, Elizabeth was a strong supporter of the Scottish Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Argyll and The Isles. The couple possessed similar interest in liberal politics. Elizabeth was dignified and cultured, and Lorne found in his new wife &quot;more than all that had been told me by her numerous friends... On some subjects, excepting philosophy and the natural sciences, she was more widely read than I was at the time.&quot; 
==Duchess of Argyll==

Lorne succeeded his father as 8th Duke of Argyll on 25 April 1847, whereupon Elizabeth became Duchess of Argyll. The family&#x27;s primary estates included Argyll Lodge in London, the family seat of Inveraray Castle in Argyllshire, and Rosneath. Their first child, John, was born within a year of their marriage. They would have an additional four sons and seven daughters. The Argyll household was sober, proper, and driven by routine with prescribed times for prayer, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The children were not expected to show emotion such as crying, except for &quot;real causes&quot; like the death of a family pet. The Scottish scholar John Stuart Blackie enjoyed the solemnity of the couple&#x27;s lifestyle and visited them often; he dedicated his 1876 work &quot;Language and Literature of the Scottish Highlands&quot; to Elizabeth.

The historian Anne Jordan writes that the Duchess was &quot;old before her time,&quot; having given birth to twelve children. She suffered from ill health, in part due to an 1868 stroke which left her partially incapacitated; this forced much of the children&#x27;s upbringing to be overseen by her husband. Her third daughter Lady Victoria, who also suffered from ill health due to a contraction of poliomyelitis, nursed her mother. Once adults, the children&#x27;s marriage settlements were a drain on the family&#x27;s resources, with all but one eventually marrying. Their eldest son John married the Queen&#x27;s fourth daughter Princess Louise in 1871, and became the Governor General of Canada in 1878.

Like her mother the Duchess of Sutherland, the Duchess of Argyll was a prominent supporter of the abolitionist movement. Elizabeth was one of many British women affected by the 1852 anti-slavery novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. The following year at her mother&#x27;s house, the Duchess helped draft a letter titled &quot;An Affectionate and Christian Address of Many Thousands of Women of Great Britain and Ireland to Their Sisters, the Women of the United States of America&quot;. The letter, eventually signed by 562,848 women, called for an end to slavery because the institution did not recognise slave marriages, led to parent-children separations, and prevented slaves from receiving Christian educations. It was sent to the author of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, the American abolitionist author Harriet Beecher Stowe; she and the Duchess of Argyll became friends, and maintained a correspondence. Harriet Beecher Stowe would often visit the duchesses of Sutherland and Argyll when she travelled to England and benefited from their connections to senior politicians. The Duke and Duchess of Argyll were also friends with American politician and anti-slavery leader Charles Sumner, leading historian Amanda Foreman to write that the &quot;relationship between [the Duke of Argyll] and Sumner would prove to be one of the most important friendships of the Civil War.&quot;

In December 1868, Lady Campbell was appointed Mistress of the Robes to Queen Victoria, succeeding Elizabeth Wellesley, Duchess of Wellington, as a member of William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s first ministry. She resigned the position in 1870 due to ill health, and was succeeded by her sister-in-law Anne Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland. In December 1877, Queen Victoria created the Order of the Crown of India and conferred it upon the Duchess of Argyll and dozens of other royal and noblewomen. She was also a member of the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert, Second Class. The Duchess of Argyll died on 25 May 1878, whilst eating with Gladstone in London. She is buried at Kilmun Parish Church.

Three years later her widower married again, to Amelia Maria, daughter of Thomas Legh Claughton, Bishop of St Albans.

==Issue==

<doc id="1208595" wikidata="Q614111" url="?curid=1208595" title="Kevin MacDonald (footballer)">
<text>Kevin Duncan MacDonald (born 22 November 1960) is a Scottish former footballer who is the former manager of Swindon Town and caretaker manager of Aston Villa on three occasions. As a player MacDonald was a member of the Liverpool &quot;double&quot; winning side of 1986.

Prior to taking his first managerial job at Swindon MacDonald&#x27;s career most notably included a spell as caretaker manager at Aston Villa following the resignation of Martin O&#x27;Neill on 9 August 2010. MacDonald also worked as assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland, with his ex-Liverpool teammate Steve Staunton, who he used to coach at Aston Villa. In 1994, he also spent a short time as caretaker manager at Leicester City.

==Playing career==
MacDonald was discovered by Leicester City while playing for his home town club, Inverness Caledonian, in the Highland League. Alex Ferguson, then manager of Aberdeen, watched Macdonald on several occasions while he played for Inverness Caledonian, but no business was done.

MacDonald joined Liverpool from Leicester for £400,000 in November 1984. He never commanded a regular spot at Anfield, but he was in the team at the right time, helping Liverpool to the First Division title in 1986 and then to the &quot;double&quot; (only the third in the 20th century) when he helped them beat Everton in the 1986 FA Cup Final at Wembley.

At the start of the following season, MacDonald broke his leg against Southampton on 20 September 1986. By the time he recovered Kenny Dalglish had settled on Steve McMahon for the central midfield role. He made no appearances for the rest of the 1986–87 season, and just one appearance in the 1987–88 season (in the league against Luton Town on 9 May 1988). In his final season at the club, 1988–89, he made just five competitive appearances before he later had spells on loan at his old club Leicester and also at Rangers. In April 1989, shortly before he left Liverpool, MacDonald, along with his teammates, rallied round the bereaved families of the Hillsborough disaster. He scored three competitive goals in his time at Liverpool (one in the league, one in the FA Cup and one in the League Cup) as well as two goals in the Football League Super Cup, all of which came in the 1985–86 season. In June 1989 he made a permanent move to Coventry City and played out his career.

==Management and coaching==
===Leicester City===
In November 1994, MacDonald was named caretaker manager of Leicester City for a short period between the departure of Brian Little and the arrival of Mark McGhee.

===Aston Villa ===
In August 2010, following the immediate resignation of former Aston Villa manager Martin O&#x27;Neill, he assumed the role of caretaker manager at the club. He had previously been the manager of Villa&#x27;s successful reserve side and assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland national side under Steve Staunton. MacDonald had been employed by Aston Villa since 1995 and had held a number of different positions at the club.

MacDonald&#x27;s first game as caretaker manager came at Villa Park against West Ham United on the opening day of the 2010–11 Premier League season which Villa won 3–0 including the last goal for James Milner as a Villa player. He then led Villa to a 1–1 draw in their Europa League qualifier first-leg match against Rapid Vienna. His second league game in charge resulted in a 6–0 defeat to Newcastle United.

Villa named Gérard Houllier as their permanent manager on 8 September 2010; however, MacDonald remained in charge for the following two Premier League matches against Stoke City and Bolton due to Houllier having to work his notice with the French Football Federation.

With the departure of Houllier and his number 2, Gary McAllister, the Villa hierarchy let it be known that MacDonald and Gordon Cowans would have futures at the club no matter who the new manager was.

On 13 December 2018, Aston Villa suspended MacDonald after allegations of bullying from ex-midfielder Gareth Farrelly. Farrelly gave an interview to the Guardian newspaper where he described MacDonald as being &quot;relentlessly negative&quot; to him in the 1990s. Furthermore, Farrelly claimed MacDonald was &quot;incredibly aggressive, with constant verbal and physical bullying&quot;. Other players came forward to give information including Greg Walters a trainee at Aston Villa between 1998 and 2000. Villa initiated an internal investigation and MacDonald was temporarily reassigned to non-player facing duties.
On 20 August 2019, Aston Villa announced MacDonald&#x27;s departure with immediate effect. Aston Villa apologised to all former players that came forward as part of the investigation into Kevin Macdonald&#x27;s behaviour. In the clubs statement it said &quot;Aston Villa wishes to apologise to all former players who were affected by behaviour which would not be tolerated by the Club today&quot;.

=== Swindon Town ===
On 28 February 2013, it was announced MacDonald was the new manager of Swindon Town in League One. MacDonald led the team into the 2013 League One play-offs following a 6th place league finish but lost 5–4 on penalties to Brentford in the semi-finals.

On 12 July 2013, he failed to attend a pre-season friendly with Forest Green Rovers at The New Lawn for what was described by Swindon as &#x27;personal problems&#x27; and after six months in the job, it was announced that he had quit the club the following day.

<doc id="1208603" wikidata="Q939070" url="?curid=1208603" title="Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph">
<text>The Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph is a large luxury automobile manufactured and marketed by Rolls-Royce Motors from 1998 to 2002. First presented on 3 March 1998 at the Geneva Motor Show, it replaced the Silver Spirit, which ended production in 1997. Silver Seraph production ended when the marketing licence to use the Rolls-Royce marque was sold to BMW, which began to manufacture cars under a new corporation, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.

== Development ==
Development of the Silver Seraph began in the late 1980s, with design work commencing in October 1990. By April 1991, the conceptual design was frozen and approved by the management in June 1991. After several refinements were made, the definitive design was reached in 1994. On 28 July 1995 design patents were filed for both the Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph and Bentley Arnage utilising production design prototypes as representations. Development concluded after nearly a decade in late 1997, with pilot production models being produced into early 1998 bearing R396 DTU registration plates. The Silver Seraph was launched at the 1998 Geneva Motor Show.

== Description ==
Aside from the radiator grille, badges and wheels, the Seraph was externally identical to the contemporary Bentley Arnage, sharing both its platform and body shell. It was powered by the BMW M73 engine, a 5.4L aluminium alloy V12 engine coupled to a 5-speed automatic transmission, making it the first twelve-cylinder Rolls-Royce since the 1939 Phantom III. The car conforms to the Euro III emission standards.

The body was 65 per cent stiffer than that of its predecessor. Standard electronics included digital engine management, adaptive ride control and anti-lock brakes. The exterior was available in one and two-tone finishes.

Inside, the Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph and the Bentley Arnage were similar yet distinct. The Seraph&#x27;s gear selector was column-mounted, and gauges followed a traditional Rolls-Royce layout. In both cars, the seats and dashboard were upholstered in Connolly Leather, with dashboard trim and folding picnic trays for rear passengers faced with glossy burl walnut veneer.

The Seraph was known for its relatively limited acceleration and comfortable handling, in comparison to the Arnage, which had a twin turbocharged V8 of its own design and firmer suspension. However, the Seraph still had a top speed of .

The RAC gave the car a rating of 7.6/10, stating &quot;The Silver Seraph marks a new start for Rolls-Royce in their quest to once more be recognised as manufacturers of the world&#x27;s best cars. And it&#x27;s quite a credible effort.&lt;br&gt;

== Production ==
The Seraph model was manufactured at the Rolls-Royce factory in Crewe, England. With a base price of £155,175 in the UK and $220,695 in the US, it was second in cost and exclusivity only to the Rolls-Royce Corniche, though it became the least expensive Rolls-Royce after the discontinuation of the Silver Spur.

A total of 1,570 Silver Seraphs were manufactured before production ended in 2002, with the last 170 cars carrying special wing badges, a commemorative plaque, chromed mirror caps, &quot;Spirit of Ecstasy&quot; hubcaps &amp; red &quot;Rolls Royce&quot; badging.

== Park Ward model ==
An extended wheelbase 5-passenger version of the Silver Seraph called the Park Ward debuted at the 2000 Geneva Motor Show. Introduced for the 2001 model year, it had added to the size of the doors (mostly the rear), resulting in more leg room for passengers. Rolls-Royce initially planned to build 200 of the model. However, it was discontinued after 2002, with a total of 127 having been produced. It was the last model to use the Park Ward label.

<doc id="1208605" wikidata="Q1184700" url="?curid=1208605" title="Harriet Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland">
<text>Harriet Elizabeth Georgiana Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland (&quot;née&quot; Howard; 21 May 1806 – 27 October 1868), styled The Honourable Harriet Howard before her marriage, was an English courtier and abolitionist from the Howard family.

She was Mistress of the Robes under several Whig administrations: 1837–1841, 1846–1852, 1853–1858, and 1859–1861; and a great friend of Queen Victoria. She was an important figure in London&#x27;s high society, and used her social position to undertake various philanthropic undertakings including the protest of the English ladies against American slavery.

==Family and early life==
Harriet was the third daughter of George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle and his wife Lady Georgiana Cavendish, who was a daughter of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire.

==Marriage==
On 18 May 1823, she married her cousin George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Earl Gower (1786–1861), who had been elected MP for St Mawes, Cornwall (a rotten borough) in 1808, and succeeded his father as second Duke of Sutherland in 1833. Gower was twenty years older than she, but their union proved one of affection and produced four sons and seven daughters.

The Duchess of Sutherland held a social position of high influence, aided by her friendship to Queen Victoria as well as her family&#x27;s great wealth. By the Duchess&#x27;s influence Stafford House, St. James&#x27;s Palace, became an important centre of society, and the starting-point of various philanthropic undertakings. The Duchess helped organise the &quot;Stafford House Address&quot; petition against slavery, and former American First Lady Julia Tyler wrote a defence of slavery titled &quot;The Women of England vs. the Women of America&quot;, in response to it. In response to &quot;The Women of England vs. the Women of America&quot;, former slave Harriet Jacobs wrote a letter to the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; which was her first published writing; it was published in 1853 and signed &quot;Fugitive&quot;.

The Duchess&#x27;s stance on slavery was heavily criticised by Karl Marx because her mother-in-law, the previous Duchess, had been closely associated with the clearance of the inhabitants of Sutherland thirty years earlier, so that she could reuse 794,000 acres (3200 km2) of land for commercial sheep farming.

==Mistress of the Robes==

On the accession of Queen Victoria the Duchess was appointed Mistress of the Robes, and held that post whenever the Whigs were in office until her husband&#x27;s death (August 1837 to September 1841, July 1846 to March 1852, January 1853 to February 1858, June 1859 to April 1861). In that role, she presided at the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838. 
From the Queen&#x27;s refusal to part with the Duchess and her other ladies arose the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839, which resulted in the Whigs returning to office. Victoria gave a sympathetic description of the Duchess&#x27;s character, and after the death of Prince Albert, the prince consort, spent the first weeks of her widowhood with the Duchess as her only companion.Queen Victoria is said to have remarked to the Duchess on arriving at Stafford House, &quot;I have come from my House to your Palace.&quot; With its ornate decoration and the dramatic sweep of the great staircase, the Grand Hall is a magnificent introduction to one of the finest town houses in London.

In 1861 the 4th Rogart Company of the 1st Sutherland Volunteer Rifle Corps formed up. The company bore the title &quot;Duchess Harriet&#x27;s Company Rogart&quot; upon the pouch-belt plate.

The Duchess&#x27;s last public appearance was at the Prince of Wales&#x27;s marriage in 1863. In that year she was seized with an illness from which she never recovered. However, she was able to entertain Garibaldi, for whom she had great admiration, at Chiswick House and Trentham, Staffordshire, during his visit to England in April 1864. She died on 27 October 1868 at her London residence, Stafford House, aged 62. She was interred in the mausoleum of the Dukes of Sutherland at Trentham. W E Gladstone was one of the pall-bearers at her funeral. The Duchess&#x27;s letters, some of which were published by her son Lord Ronald Gower in &quot;Stafford House Letters&quot;, parts iv-vi., prove her to have had an affectionate disposition, with some sense of humour. She had also an interest in architecture and gardening.

==Issue==
On 18 May 1823 Harriet married George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Earl Gower, eldest son of the 2nd Marquess of Stafford, and a man twenty years her senior. Her father-in-law was created Duke of Sutherland in 1833, and was succeeded by his son later that year, whereupon Harriet became the Duchess of Sutherland.

They had eleven children:
* Lady Elizabeth Georgiana (30 May 1824 – 25 May 1878), married George Douglas Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll and had issue.
* Lady Evelyn (8 August 1825 – 1869), married Charles Stuart, 12th Lord Blantyre
* Lady Caroline Leveson-Gower (15 April 1827 – 1887), married Charles FitzGerald, 4th Duke of Leinster and had issue.
* Lord George Granville William (19 December 1828 – 22 September 1892), succeeded as 3rd Duke.
* Lady Blanche Julia Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (26 June 1830 – 24 February 1832)
* Lord Frederick George (11 November 1832 – 6 October 1854)
* Lady Constance Gertrude (16 June 1834 – 19 December 1880), married Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster and had issue.
* Lady Victoria Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (16 May 1838 – 19 June 1839)
* Lord Albert (21 Nov 1843 – 1874), married Grace Abdy, daughter of Sir Thomas Neville Abdy, 1st Baronet and had issue, including Frederick Neville Sutherland Leveson-Gower.
* Lord Ronald Charles Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (2 August 1845 – 9 March 1916), died unmarried.
* Lady Alexandrina Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (3 February 1848 – 21 June 1849)

In 1871, while her son-in-law, the Duke of Argyll, was serving in the Cabinet, his son (Harriet&#x27;s grandson), Lord Lorne, married one of Victoria&#x27;s daughters, Princess Louise. Harriet&#x27;s eldest son became 3rd Duke of Sutherland in 1861.

==In media==
Harriet was portrayed by Rachael Stirling in the 2009 film &quot;The Young Victoria&quot;. She was portrayed by Margaret Clunie in the 2016 ITV series &quot;Victoria&quot;, though she is inaccurately depicted as carrying on an improbable romance with Prince Ernest of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (later Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha), in the couple of years before his marriage.

<doc id="1208607" wikidata="Q8069103" url="?curid=1208607" title="Zenith (comics)">
<text>Zenith is a British superhero, who appeared in the British science fiction comic &quot;2000 AD&quot;. Created by writer Grant Morrison and artist Steve Yeowell, with original character designs by Brendan McCarthy, the story first appeared in &quot;2000 AD&quot; #535 (22 August 1987). Zenith himself (real name Robert McDowell) did not appear until the second episode – the first episode set the backdrop for his introduction.

Shallow and sarcastic, Zenith was a distinctly Generation X superhero, featuring regularly in &quot;2000 AD&quot; from 1987 until 1992, with occasional appearances since. The series was an early success for Morrison, who has since written popular works for DC and Marvel, using their own characters. The first series won the 1987 Eagle Award for Favourite Single or Continuing Story.

==Publication history==
&quot;Zenith&quot; appeared in August 1987 during a period when editor and assistant editor, Steve MacManus and Richard Burton respectively, were shaking up &quot;2000 AD&quot; by publishing numerous new stories which gave fresh talent a chance. Grant Morrison had been thinking along the lines of Zenith since 1982, but &quot;[t]he original version had a more traditional superhero costume and was a little grimmer in tone&quot;, and the final concept came together as &quot;... a reaction against torment superheroes&quot;. Despite liking both &quot;&quot; and &quot;Watchmen&quot;, they felt that &quot;... both books felt pompous and concept albumy to me as a young man in the &#x27;80s&quot;. They found more of an influence in the work of Brendan McCarthy: &quot;... tell the truth on to the page and let your psyche all hang out&quot; and it was McCarthy who would provide the initial character designs, although he never drew the actual story, because Morrison said &quot;... the story as it unfolded would have been too ponderous and long-winded for him&quot;.

With hindsight, Morrison stated: &quot;I like Phase I the least now –- it wears its influences a little too obviously on its sleeve&quot;. They rated Phase III far higher, considered as &quot;one of the greatest superhero crossover events ever&quot;.

In America, &quot;Zenith&quot; Phases I and II were reprinted in colour in Fleetway/Quality&#x27;s monthly &quot;2000 A.D. Showcase&quot; title, beginning in the jointly-numbered issue #29/30, and running through issue #45 (September 1988-December 1989). These issues featured new covers by American comic book artists such as Jackson Guice, Tom Lyle, and Bart Sears. According to the series&#x27; index at the Grand Comics Database, &quot;the end of the Phase II storyline was also the end of the Zenith reprints, as Phase III was still in progress in the British weekly. It ended in March of 1990, but by that time [2000AD Showcase] was about to be cancelled&quot;.

&quot;Zenith&quot; returned for Phase IV in 1992 but Morrison&#x27;s attention was elsewhere: &quot;I&#x27;d moved on and was more excited by the possibilities of working with American superheroes. By 1992, &quot;Zenith&quot; seemed like something dragged up from my past&quot;. This however does not mean they think any less of the story: &quot;I like a lot of things I write under duress. I actually really like the last book of Zenith. I&#x27;m very fond of it&quot;.

Titan Books published five trade paperbacks of &quot;Zenith&quot; between 1988 and 1990, collecting Phase I through III. For years after that, attempts to re-publish the series (including the never collected Phase IV) were prevented by a copyright dispute between the publisher and Morrison. In 2007, Morrison explained: &quot;Fleetway have no paperwork to confirm their ownership of Zenith, so I&#x27;m currently involved in legal proceedings to clear things up&quot;.

In 2013, British publishing company Rebellion Developments began publishing a complete collection as a hardcover book limited to 1000 copies. The book sold out within two days of being announced and the delivery date was brought forward to early October. The book collected all four phases and has a nearly exhaustive collection of covers and pin-ups. Whilst parties involved in ongoing legal proceedings are, as a rule, barred from speaking publicly of them, it appears that Morrison has been unsuccessful in halting that initial publication. &quot;Zenith Books&quot; 1 and 2 could be pre-ordered for a December 2014 launch through mainstream distribution chains.

A new &quot;Zenith&quot; text story, &quot;Permission to Land&quot;, appeared in prog 2050 in September 2017. It was written by editor Matt Smith, with a new illustration by Steve Yeowell.

Zenith also appeared in a story unconnected to the Zenith universe – &quot;A Night 2 Remember&quot;, a strip about the comic&#x27;s 25th anniversary celebrations, which appeared in prog 1280.

==List of stories==

===Phase I===
::&quot;Originally published in &quot;2000AD&quot; Progs #535-550 (15th August - 28 November 1987)&quot;
A flashback to 1944 shows the battle between the British super-soldier Maximan and his more powerful German counterpart Masterman in Berlin. The latter is actually one of the Lloigor or Many-Angled Ones known as Iok Sotot, but the Allies have planned for Maximan&#x27;s failure and the USAAF drop an atomic bomb on the city before Masterman can finish his opponent off. In present-day 1987 London former Nazis known as the Cult of the Black Sun engineer Iok Sotot&#x27;s resurrection in an improved Masterman body. He decides to eliminate all possible opposition by neutering the surviving members of 1960s British superhero group Cloud 9. However Ruby Fox, formerly Voltage, survives the attempt on her life by using her powers - regaining them under duress. She attempts to recruit Zenith, the son of her two missing former team-mates Dr. Beat and White Heat who uses his own powers entirely to promote his career as a pop star. He is initially apathetic until Ruby says she&#x27;ll tell him what happened to his parents if he helps. They attempt to recruit Peter St. John, formerly Mandala of Cloud 9 and now a key Conservative MP in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government who has faked losing his powers. He dismisses them but is visited by Masterman soon after and warned to stay out of the forthcoming battle.

Instead they travel to Wales to visit Siadwel Rhys, formerly the powerful pyrokinetic Red Dragon. He has slipped into alcoholism, after losing his powers. Zenith drops him from high altitude to re-awaken his flying ability, and then his pyrokinetics. They are able to sober him up and recruit him but when they return to London it is already under attack by Masterman, who kills Rhys. Fox and Zenith fare little better until St. John intervenes, giving Zenith an opening to destroy the host body. This reveals the true form of Iok Sotot, but St. John planted a telepathic post-hypnotic command in its mind during their meeting which he uses to give the being a seizure and disappear. At Rhys&#x27; funeral he dismisses his decision to help as simply being to curry favour ahead of the general election - and soon after he is returned as MP for Hertfordshire South and promoted to Minister of Defence, with the heavy implication he has used his psychic abilities to secure his promotion. While Ruby decides she is going on holiday before she tells Zenith anything further about his parents the affair has benefitted him greatly as well, allowing his records to top the charts.

Short interlude episodes focusing on Maximan and Doctor Michael Peyne (creator of the world&#x27;s superhumans) appeared in &quot;2000AD&quot; Progs #558-559 (23 - 30 January 1988).

===Phase II===
::&quot;Originally published in &quot;2000AD&quot; Progs #589-606 (25th June - 24 December 1988)&quot;
In a prelude, Ruby&#x27;s holiday sees her meet up with David Cambridge and Penelope Moon - Cloud 9 members Lux and Spook, long thought dead - on Alternative 303, an Earth where dinosaurs still exist - as they plan to stop the mysterious &quot;alignment&quot; planned by the Lloigor. Zenith meanwhile is on the verge of a planned American tour when he is attacked in his flat by the huge mechanoid Warhead, controlled by Peyne and Scott Wallace, a computer wizard and owner of Wallace International. He is only saved by the intervention of CIA agent Phaedra Cale, who has been monitoring Peyne. Wallace meanwhile takes over the weapons systems of the nuclear submarine HMS &quot;Resolve&quot;, aiming two nuclear warheads at Whitehall. St. John attempts to juggle responding to the crisis with visions of a blackened sun and the Omnihedron since his contact with Iok Sotot, while also fielding a brief visit from Spook. Zenith and Cale infiltrate Wallace&#x27;s base at Schiehallion but are captured by Shockwave and Blaze - Peyne&#x27;s latest creations, working for Wallace who plans to take over the world and make it a better place. He executes Cale and prepares to launch the missiles.

With the British unable to locate &quot;Resolve&quot; and unwilling to risk a panic only elite figures such as the Royal Family are covertly evacuated from London. Meanwhile, Zenith is loosely imprisoned and finds out more about his abilities in discussion with Peyne. The scientist plans to use Zenith, Blaze and Shockwave to breed a race of superhumans to restore the planet - planning to kill him after he impregnates them when his biorhythm is at its lowest. Peyne tells Zenith his parents were killed by CIA Shadowmen, psychically enhanced hitmen. He used genetic material from White Heat&#x27;s corpse to create Blaze and cell-scrapings from Fox to create Shockwave - and placed the barely-living Dr. Beat inside the Warhead armour. Peyne leaves Warhead to kill Zenith; his agent Eddie has long circulated a false birthday for the star and thus Peyne has miscalculated his biorhythm information. Zenith is strong enough to destroy Warhead - killing his father in the process - but Wallace has initiated the launch of the missiles from a secure vault, with a riddle set up as the passcode. Zenith uses his crude telepathy to contact St. John, who is above London and hopes to intercept the missiles. He gets the correct answer and enters, persuading Wallace to abort the launch. Fed up and disinterested, Zenith leaves - while St. John uses his mental powers to trap Wallace in his vault with no electricity. Zenith returns to his flat and is confronted by Chimera, a hugely powerful creature composed entirely of thought, created by Peyne at the same time as the other Cloud 9 members, which after assuming a myriad of shapes turns itself into a small-scale omnihedron.

In an epilogue Lux, Spook and Voltage travel to Ayers Rock and meet with Black Flag, a team of superhumans from Alternate-5 who arrive by Einstein-Rosen bridge and plan to help battle the Alignment when they are interrupted by the arrival of a dying messenger - Jimmy Quick - from another world, fatally injured by the Lloigor.

Another interlude - printed in the 1988 &quot;2000AD&quot; Winter Special (with art by Manuel Carmona rather than Steve Yeowell) debuts the Maximan of Alternate-23, who survived the atomic bomb and lives at Axis Mundi. Mantra of Black Flag tells him Alternate-257 has fallen, with its defender Hotspur possessed by the Lloigor. She also tells him the history of Zenith, who Maximan claims is their last hope of victory.

===Phase III===
::&quot;Originally published in &quot;2000AD&quot; Progs #626-634 &amp; #650-670 (13th May - 8th July &amp; 28th October 1989 - 17th March 1990)&quot;
Maximan&#x27;s allies gather superheroes from myriad alternate Earths, including Zenith and St. John, who are united with the surviving members of Cloud 9 and scores of others at Axis Mundi. He introduces Big Ben from Alternative-666, a world almost completely overrun by the Lloigor and the source of the message brought by Jimmy Quick. Recorded by Prince Mamba, it tells of how the Lloigor possessed the world&#x27;s most powerful heroes and devastated the planet. The heroes are charged with using powerful Chaostructor bombs to destroy Alternative 666 and Alternative 257 to introduce a flaw and prevent the alignment of the Omnihedron in a month&#x27;s time, which the Lloigor plan to use to ascend and gain control of all reality. The conference is interrupted by the arrival of Hotspur, who was able to mutilate himself and throw off the Lloigor which possessed him. Ruby Fox meanwhile is shown how to access a youthful energy form by Lux and Spook. Maximan&#x27;s forces are split into two groups, one dispatched to Alternative 666 and the other to Alternative 257.

The group send to Alternative 666 is led by Ben and includes Zenith, Lux, Robot Archie, Domino, Metamaid, the Blue Magician, Oakman, Tanya, the Steel Claw, Miracle Man, Tri-Man, the Leopard from Lime Street, Fishboy and Catgirl. They are able to kill one of the Lloigor-possessed superheroes, Miss Wonderstarr, and link up with a handful of surviving heroes in the London Underground. However, they are ambushed by the other two Lloigor, in the bodies of Jack Flash and Mr. Why, who kill many of their number. The rest eventually regroup and prepare to destroy the planet and the two Lloigor with it before escaping via an Einstein-Rosen Bridge. The timer on the device is faulty but Alternative-666 heroes Tiger Tom and Tammy stay behind to activate it.

The force on Alternative 257 is led by Hotspur and includes St. John, Voltage, Spook, Mantra, DJ Chill, Vertex (an alternate version of Zenith), Streamline, Ace Hart, Captain Miracle, Electroman, the Black Archer, Thunderbolt Jaxon and Electrogirl. However, they find there are three Lloigor on the planet instead of the expected one, in possession of the bodies of the Wyvern, Mr. Lion and Mr. Unicorn, and suffer large losses. Hotspur is briefly lost following Mr. Lion and Mr. Unicorn through an Einstein-Rosen Bridge and returns paralysed but the arrival of Robot Archie on a Tyrannosaurus buys the group time to set the bomb and escape, destroying Wyvern along with the planet.

Reconvening on Alternative 303, the survivors of both forces attempt to work out if they have been successful. Hotspur dies, but not before using one of his eyes to blink a Morse code message to Ben, who confides in Zenith. He in turn passes the message to St. John and Mantra, who discover Streamline is actually working for the Lloigor. Under interrogation he confesses that Maximan has actually made a deal with the Lloigor, and the destruction of the two alternative Earths has not disabled the Ominhedron but instead removed a flaw in it, and the alignment is in fact now happening. The final part of their plan involves using the Cult of the Black Sun to activate a Chaostructor bomb set on Alternative 230 - Zenith&#x27;s home dimension. St. John and Mantra head to Alternative 23 to confront Maximan while the remainder travel to the South Pole on Alternative 230 where the bomb is guarded by the Lliogor-possessed Captain Miracle, Ace Hart, Mr. Lion and Mr. Unicorn. At Axis Mundi, Mantra attempts to reason with Maximan but he kills her. St. John battles Maximan but is outmatched until the arrival of the rest of his allies, who have overwhelmed the Lloigir&#x27;s forces on Alternative 230 and captured the bomb. Maximan attempts to ascend by sheer force of will until the heroes realise they can use the Chaostructor bomb to destroy Alternative 23, taking Maximan with it. Zenith is seemingly left behind in the explosion and mourned but when the survivors reconvene on Alternative 230 it is soon found that it was actually Vertex who died. Those left after the pyrrhic victory are returned to their home dimensions, while Zenith ponders what there is for the superhumans of Alternative 230 to do now.

An interlude - printed in the 1990 &quot;2000AD&quot; Annual (with art by Jim McCarthy) - details in flashback St. John&#x27;s refusal to have a child with Fox as part of Cloud 9&#x27;s Grand Plan and subsequent survival of an assassination attempt by CIA Shadowmen.

===Phase IV===
::&quot;Originally published in &quot;2000AD&quot; Progs #791-806 (11th July - 24 October 1992)&quot;
His music career booming thanks to cynically tapping into the dance music scene, Zenith visits St. John, showing him Chimera. St. John is now Prime Minister, having taken over from Margaret Thatcher as Conservative leader. Robot Archie also now lives in Alternative 230, carving out a career as a techno artist. Lux, Spook, Voltage and Black Flag survivors DJ Chill and Domino have formed the Horus Foundation and gone public with their Grand Plan. They confront Zenith and St. John in Downing Street, warning them to join them or be treated as enemies. They refuse.

The United States is alarmed by Lux&#x27;s proclamations and sends CIA Shadowmen to kill the group. Domino, who is now having cold feet about the plan, narrowly survives an assassination attempt but is then killed by Lux, giving the group a reason to devastate the White House. Zenith, St. John and Archie attack them but the latter is destroyed. The Horus Foundation finds Peyne and recruits Blaze (who has given birth to a son fathered by Zenith), though Voltage kills Shockwave to recover her genetic material. They wipe out the rest of humanity but spare Peyne in apparent recognition of his role as their creator. Aging in reverse, he writes his autobiography &quot;Seizing the Fire&quot; to pass the time despite his awareness that it will never be published while being visited occasionally by his mocking creations.

St. John and Zenith are hunted down, while the other superhumans turn the sun into a huge incubator to power their ascension - showing that their ultimate form is the Lloigor. St. John is finally destroyed in London before Zenith is swallowed by Iok Sokkot, revealed to be the final form of his son. Peyne&#x27;s de-aging finishes and he blinks out of existence, his book unfinished. The superhuman Lloigor ascend and prepare to dominate the universe, only to be stopped by an invisible barrier.

It is revealed that they were trapped inside Chimera by St. John while threatening him at Downing street and everything that has happened since then has taken place within a pocket dimension. There are heavy hints that St. John&#x27;s motives aren&#x27;t entirely altruistic and that he is instead following his own subtler grand plan, notably when the popular opposition Labour leader John Smith dies of a heart attack shortly before the election, leading to another Conservative landslide. Zenith seems broadly aware of these machinations but is more interested in the partying lifestyle his pop career gives him - the implication being both will leave the other to their own agenda.

===zzzzenith.com===
::&quot;Originally published in &quot;2000AD&quot; Prog 2001 (2000)&quot;
A one-off strip. In November 2000 Zenith is still a successful pop star and the star of a Channel 4 fly-on-the-wall &quot;hyper-documentary&quot;. St. John is still running the country, using vegetative psychiatric patient Tony Blair as a puppet to avoid suspicion. Zenith is aware of the ruse but doesn&#x27;t care. Britney Spears meanwhile has been sexually assaulted in a London hotel room. One of her fans believes Zenith is responsible and attacks him with a bazooka during a visit to a children&#x27;s hospital. Zenith survives the attack - though most of the patients and staff are less lucky. The real culprit is Robot Archie, who has become a vicious vigilante after what Zenith calls &quot;brain rust&quot; has set in and escapes on a bus wearing a false beard.
==Collected editions==
&quot;Zenith&quot; was printed as a series of (now out of print) trade paperbacks by Titan Books between 1988 and 1991, with Phases II and III both being split across two volumes. The trades gave the three arcs titles - &quot;Tygers&quot;, &quot;The Hollow Land&quot; and &quot;War in Heaven&quot;, respectively. Each featured a new cover by Steve Yeowell and other backmatter from the creators, but the trades stopped before collecting Phase IV. In 2013, &quot;2000 AD&quot; publishers Rebellion re-printed the entire series in a hardcover volume, limited to 1,000 copies. Priced at £100, the book was published on 1 December, and sold exclusively via their website. A series of 4 cheaper books began in 2014, concluding the following year with the first collected reprint of Phase IV. These eschewed the titles used in the Titan books and featured no additional material. In 2023 &quot;Zenith&quot; was collected in two issues (146 and 156) of &quot;2000 AD: The Ultimate Collection&quot; by Hachette Partworks.

<text>Dudley Stagpoole (1838 – 1 August 1911) was a British Army soldier and an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Stagpoole was born in Killunan, County Galway in 1838.

==Victoria Cross==
Drummer Dudley Stagpoole, 57th Regiment of Foot, was about 25 years old during the Second Taranaki War in New Zealand, when the following deed took place on 2 October 1863 at Allan&#x27;s Hill near Poutoko, Taranaki, for which he and Ensign John Thornton Down were awarded the Victoria Cross (VC).
Stagpoole had been awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) for a separate incident at Kaipakopako:

==Further information==
He died in Ware, Hertfordshire on 1 August 1911.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment and Queen&#x27;s Regiment RHQ, Howe Barracks, Canterbury, Kent

<text>The Walsh Street police shootings were the 1988 murders of two Victoria Police officers: Constables Steven Tynan, 22, and Damian Eyre, 20.

Tynan and Eyre were responding to a report of an abandoned car when they were gunned down about 4:50am in Walsh Street, South Yarra, Melbourne, on 12 October 1988.

Four men, Victor Peirce, Trevor Pettingill, Anthony Leigh Farrell and Peter David McEvoy, were charged with murder and later acquitted by a jury in the Supreme Court of Victoria. Two other suspects, Jedd Houghton and Gary Abdallah, were shot and killed by Victoria Police before being brought to trial.

In 2005, Wendy Peirce, the widow of Victor, gave an interview to the mass media. In this interview, she stated that her late husband had planned and carried out the murders and that he was actually guilty as charged.

==Background==
Since the 1878 attack on three police officers by the Ned Kelly Gang, criminal attacks on police officers were considered as rare events in Victoria. During the period of the 1980s, prior to the Walsh Street killings, there had been a number of random acts of violence committed against members of the Victoria Police. In the early hours of 22 November 1984, officers, Sergeant Peter Kearon, 34, and his partner, Constable Graham Fletcher, operating a divisional van, were conducting licence checks in the vehicles on Beach Road in Beaumaris. At 1:35am, Kearon and Fletcher stopped a blue and white 1966 Holden with a missing headlight, as the vehicle pulled alongside the officers&#x27; divisional van, the driver got out and fired three shots at Kearon and Fletcher with a .223 Leader carbine semiautomatic assault rifle. The gunman then got back in his vehicle and took off, leading Kearon and Fletcher on a short chase along Beach Road, before turning into Tramway Parade and coming to a stop on Oak Street near the Gibbs Street intersection. The gunman then got out of the Holden and fired three more shots at Kearon and Fletcher&#x27;s divisional van. Kearon received a cut above his eye from flying glass from the van&#x27;s shattered windshield, while Fletcher escaped injury by taking cover under the van&#x27;s dashboard. The gunman, 19-year-old Kai &quot;Matty&quot; Korhonen, was a former army recruit from Clayton who was recently dismissed from his job at a car yard, an hour before shooting at Sergeant Kearon and Constable Fletcher. Korhonen shot and killed security guard Peter Poole outside of the Boral Melwire factory in Clayton South. After shooting at Kearon and Fletcher, Korhonen took off on foot, cutting across nearby Banksia Reserve back towards Tramway Parade. In Tramway Parade, Korhonen opened fire on an unmarked patrol car, containing Senior Constable Ron Fenton, 28, and his partner, Senior Constable Paul Gilbert, 26, from Caulfield police station, who were on the lookout for the gunman responsible for Poole&#x27;s murder. Senior Constable Gilbert received wounds from bullet fragments to his back, while Senior Constable Fenton received a wound to the back of his head for which he had to undergo neurosurgery and was placed in a medical coma for ten days, before making a recovery. Korhonen was later convicted of Poole&#x27;s murder and the attempted murders of Senior Constables Gilbert and Fenton, Constable Fletcher and Sergeant Kearon and was sentenced to 88 years&#x27; imprisonment; he was released after serving 15 years.

On the night of 18 June 1985, two officers, Constable Peter Steele, 26, and his partner, Sergeant Brian Stooke, 40, were sitting in an unmarked patrol car outside of a warehouse in Cheltenham where a burglary had occurred days earlier. At 12:03am on 19 June, they spotted a yellow Ford Cortina circling the street several times outside the warehouse. Thinking it was a burglar, Sergeant Stooke and Constable Steele followed the vehicle and pulled it over and begun to conduct an inspection of the vehicle. A check revealed that the vehicle was registered to a man named Max Clark. As the officers were conducting the inspection, the driver got out of the vehicle, produced a firearm and shot both officers, wounding them. Constable Steele received a wound to his hand, while Sergeant Stooke was hit four times, one which severed his spinal cord. The gunman then got back in the vehicle and fled from the scene. The gunman then drove to his home where he grabbed more firearms and ammunition before leaving his home in a second vehicle, a green Ford Fairlane. At 3 am, three hours after shooting Stooke and Steele, the gunman&#x27;s Fairlane was spotted by a patrol car in Oakleigh, operated by Sergeant Ray Kirkwood and Constable Graeme Sayce, resulting in a high-speed chase. At speeds of 180 km/h, the Fairlane&#x27;s engine blew, rendering the vehicle inoperable. The gunman then took off on foot with Sergeant Kirkwood and Constable Sayce in pursuit. Cornered, the gunman then produced two firearms and opened fire on Kirkwood and Sayce. In the volley of shots fired by the gunman, two went through the patrol car&#x27;s windshield, hitting and wounding Sergeant Kirkwood.

Thirty minutes later, the gunman shot police dog handler Senior Constable Gary Morrell, who was saved by his police-issued ballistic vest. Further police checks revealed that the gunman&#x27;s real name was Pavel Vasilof Marinof. Born 20 September 1946 in Bulgaria, Marinof had previously served in the Bulgarian Army. In 1967, Marinof deserted from his army unit and fled to Turkey. In 1969, Marinof immigrated to Australia, settling in the South Clayton area. In 1975, Marinof became a naturalized citizen and changed his name to Max Clark. In a raid on Marinof&#x27;s home, police recovered firearms, several rounds of ammunition along with several items, including petty cash stolen by Marinof in the months prior to the shootings. As Marinof had ties to the Eastern European community, police begun their manhunt in the suburb of Noble Park, known for Melbourne&#x27;s large Eastern European population, including migrants from Yugoslavia and Macedonia. As the tactics used in the manhunt for Marinof was causing concerns and attracting criticism from the Eastern European community, the manhunt team included Detective Sergeant John &quot;Kappa&quot; Kapetanovski, who was a fluent speaker in both Macedonian and Yugoslav languages, to establish a public trust between police and the Eastern European community.

Marinof (dubbed in the media as &quot;Mad Max&quot;) went on a crime spree, committing various robberies and thefts in which he stole a machine gun and several rounds of ammunition from an army base. In a public appeal, police offered a A$50,000 reward for information leading to Marinof&#x27;s whereabouts.

Eight months later, a tip came in that Marinof was staying at a property owned by members of an outlaw motorcycle club near Wallan. Acting on the tip, on 25 February 1986, Detective Sergeant Kapetanovski and his partner, Detective Senior Constable Rodney MacDonald, conducting surveillance on the property, spotted Marinof in a wig and beard getting into and driving from the property in a Queensland-registered Ford Falcon Panel Van. Sergeant Kapetanovski and Senior Constable MacDonald followed the vehicle a short distance before pulling over the vehicle. As the vehicles came to a stop, Marinof produced a firearm and opened fire on Sergeant Kapetanovski and Senior Constable MacDonald, seriously wounded them. Despite being wounded in the chest, Detective Senior Constable MacDonald managed to return fire with his police-issued shotgun, shattering the van&#x27;s rear window and mortally wounding Marinof.

The vehicle then veered off the road, crashing through a wooden fence into a paddock. When Marinof&#x27;s vehicle was spotted in the paddock, officers surrounded the vehicle and found Marinof&#x27;s body in the driver&#x27;s seat. Both Sergeant Kapetanovski and Senior Constable MacDonald later made a full recovery from their wounds.

The Russell Street bombing on 27 March 1986 and the death of Constable Angela Taylor from her injuries 24 days later, had heightened fears within the Victoria Police that any officer on duty elsewhere could be considered as a target of a criminal attack. Those fears were later justified six months to day of the Russell Street Bombing. In the early hours of 27 September 1986, Senior Constable Maurice Moore was on duty at the Maryborough police station when he left the station to get a bottle of milk from his home. As Moore&#x27;s patrol car turned onto Brougham Street, he came across two men pushing a stolen vehicle. One of the men quickly fled when he saw Moore&#x27;s patrol car coming towards them, the other man was quickly detained by Moore. As Moore was taking down the details of the offense, the detained offender, 28-year-old invalid Robert Nowell, overpowered Senior Constable Moore, grabbing Moore&#x27;s police-issued service revolver and shot Moore five times, killing him. Nowell later gave himself up to police in Ballarat and was later convicted of Moore&#x27;s murder on 8 September 1987.

This period of the 1980s saw a high number of armed robberies being committed throughout Melbourne to a point where they had become a problem for police forces across Australia. Rather than committing robberies on impulse, professional armed robbers organised in gangs, began planning their robberies in advance by conducting surveillance on targets known to carry large amount of cash, selecting gang members, assigning roles, organising weaponry and equipment needed, arranging the getaway vehicles, and organising safehouses. The armed robbery gangs not only carried out their robberies with precision, they also carried out their robberies with threats of violence.

==Prior events==
On 11 October 1988, Peirce&#x27;s best friend, Graeme Jensen, was fatally shot by police in Narre Warren. Jensen had been under observation by the Victoria Police Armed Robbery Squad, who had planned to arrest him in connection with an armed robbery and murder. Police followed Jensen to a local store. Three cars containing eight detectives attempted to block Jensen in as he left the store, but one of the cars was delayed by passing traffic, allowing Jensen to drive through. Police later gave sworn evidence that they saw Jensen brandish a firearm. Police yelled at Jensen to stop; one detective yelled: &quot;He&#x27;s got a gun.&quot; Jensen was then shot dead. His car crashed into a roadside pole.

==Report of an abandoned car==
On 12 October, 13 hours after Jensen&#x27;s death, at 4:39am, Constables Tynan and Eyre were operating a divisional van with the call-sign &quot;Prahran 311&quot; from Prahran police station when called to an abandoned Holden Commodore left in Walsh Street, South Yarra. At the time of the murders, the call about the abandoned car would usually been answered by police units from St Kilda Road police station, but at the time of the murders, St Kilda Road police station had a shortage of officers on duty and were unable to send a divisional van. Usually the call would divert to units from South Melbourne police station, but on that particular night the only available South Melbourne police unit, another divisional van, had been called to a suspected suicide in St. Kilda. As constables Tynan and Eyre were the first available officers in the area, the call was passed onto their divisional van. While the officers were examining the vehicle, they were ambushed by armed offenders. Constable Tynan was shot with a shotgun while sitting in the car, and Constable Eyre was seriously wounded. It is thought that Constable Eyre, despite having suffered serious injuries, struggled with the attacker until another person approached him from behind, managed to remove Eyre&#x27;s service revolver from its holster and shot him in the head with it. Upon hearing reports from residents on Walsh Street about shots fired, the police communications officer attempted to contact Tynan and Eyre, but got no response. Unable to contact Eyre and Tynan, the police communications officer contacted the South Melbourne district supervising inspector. As more reports of gunfire from Walsh Street were coming in, concern grew at Victoria Police Headquarters. Within minutes, police units from Russell Street, South Melbourne, and St. Kilda were converging onto the scene. A South Melbourne unit was the first the scene who found Tynan and Eyre&#x27;s divisional van parked behind the abandoned Commodore in the middle of the road with the engine running and the driver&#x27;s side door open. Seconds later, the South Melbourne officers found Tynan and Eyre mortally wounded. Constable Eyre was found lying by the rear of vehicle, while Tynan was found lying partially in the Commodore&#x27;s driver&#x27;s seat. 

Police believed members of a Melbourne armed robbery gang had organised the murders. In the period up to April 1989 there had been an unusually high number of fatal shootings of suspects by police. The killings of the two police officers were viewed by many as a form of payback by members of the Melbourne underworld.

==Ty-Eyre task force==
The police investigation was known as the &quot;Ty-Eyre Task Force&quot;, a combination of the two surnames of the officers killed. Detective Inspector John Noonan was the Officer in Charge and it was the biggest investigation Victoria Police had ever undertaken at the time and also the longest running, spanning 895 days. At the height of the investigation, police had hundreds of officers working with the task force to investigate the murders.

===The Flemington Crew===
Police investigations revealed the shotgun used to perform the murders was the same weapon used earlier in a bungled attempt to blast open a bank door during a robbery at the State Bank in Oak Park seven months earlier. A gang, dubbed &quot;the Flemington Crew&quot; by police, had robbed at least four Melbourne banks. The robbers, on security CCTV at the Oak Park robbery, had left shotgun shells at the scene. Seven months into the investigation, the shotgun itself was found half-buried in an inner-city golf-course plant bed by a gardener. The shotgun and shells became the single forensic link police had, linking the Oak Park robbery to the same shotgun used in the Walsh Street murders. The shotgun and empty shotgun shell casings are on display at the Victoria Police Museum, Melbourne.

===Pettingill family===
Members of the gangs responsible for the robberies were believed to be Victor Peirce, Graeme Jensen, Jedd Houghton and Peter David McEvoy. The home of Victor Peirce was raided the day following the Walsh Street shootings. Peirce&#x27;s house was later demolished and the backyard dug up in the search for evidence.

==Trial==
The trial of the four men accused, Victor Peirce, Trevor Pettingill, Anthony Leigh Farrell and Peter David McEvoy, began in March 1991. The prosecution alleged six people were involved in the planning of the shootings: the accused, Jason Ryan, and the late Jedd Houghton.

===Prosecution===
Jason Ryan became a prosecution witness in the trial and was offered immunity in exchange for his testimony. Police placed Ryan under the witness protection program and moved him to Mansfield on 24 October 1988 for questioning. His evidence changed a number of times up to the opening of the trial.

Ryan&#x27;s evidence had implicated Gary Abdallah, Jedd Houghton, Anthony Leigh Farrell and Emmanuel Alexandris. Police were told the party of killers were Jedd Houghton, Peter David McEvoy, Anthony Leigh Farrell and his uncles Victor Peirce and Trevor Pettingill. Houghton was shot and killed during a police raid on the Big4 Ascot Holiday Park in Bendigo in November 1988. Abdallah was fatally wounded during his arrest on another matter in April 1989.

Victor Peirce&#x27;s wife, Wendy Peirce, also became a prosecution witness and entered the witness protection program. She had previously maintained her husband was with her in a motel all night on the night of the murders; she retracted this alibi in preparation to testify against her husband. But, in a pre-trial hearing, she retracted her retraction and, as a hostile witness, did not appear at the trial.

===Not guilty verdict===

All four men charged with the murders were acquitted in the Supreme Court of Victoria.

Victor Peirce and Peter David McEvoy were taken back into custody on other charges. Upon receiving the verdict, D24 sent a broadcast of the verdict to every police officer in Melbourne, telling them to keep control and resist from carrying out any acts of retaliation against the defendants.

Wendy Peirce was charged with perjury, convicted and sentenced to serve 9 months non-parole.

==In popular culture==

The Seven Network aired a documentary on the shootings in 2010 titled &quot;Police Under Fire: The Walsh Street Killings&quot;. The Walsh Street shootings and the people responsible for them inspired the fictional 2010 feature film &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot; and the 2011 television docudrama &quot;Killing Time&quot;. They were also mentioned several times in the 2011 docudrama &quot;Underbelly Files: Tell Them Lucifer was Here&quot; (which concerned the 1998 Silk–Miller police murders in Melbourne).

The Walsh Street shootings were a subject of the Screen Australia/Film Victoria documentary &quot;Trigger Point&quot;, aired by the ABC in 2014, which also documented questionable cases of shootings of criminals by police, and training programmes aimed at reducing such incidents. The case was also covered by &quot;Casefile True Crime Podcast&quot; on 29 July 2017.

<text>These railroads were bought, leased, or in other ways had their track come under ownership or lease by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad.

The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad later merged with the [[Seaboard Air Line Railroad]] to form the [[Seaboard Coast Line Railroad]].

The Georgia Railroad was partly owned by the ACL.

The ACL gained stock control of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad in 1902; see List of Louisville and Nashville Railroad precursors.

==Early life==
Luise Friederike Auguste, Countess von Alten, was born 15 June 1832 at Hanover in what was then the Kingdom of Hanover. She was a daughter of Karl Franz Viktor, Count von Alten (1800–1879), and his wife, Hermine von Schminke (1806–1868). Her siblings included: Helene Charlotte Auguste, Countess of Alten, who married Andrei Bludov, Carl Friedrich Franz Victor, Count of Alten, who married Carolina Frederica Groeninx van Zoelen, and Guidobaldine, Countess of Alten, who married Graf August Grote and &quot;Don&quot; Luigi Maria Colonna, Prince of Stigliano, and Detlof von Bülow.

Her paternal grandparents were Adolf Viktor Christian Jobst, Count von Alten (1755–1820), and Charlotte Louise Wilhelmine Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau.

==Mistress of the Robes==
&quot;A social climber with a nose for power&quot;, the 26-year-old Duchess (through her friendship with Lord Derby, the then prime minister) was appointed Mistress of the Robes to Queen Victoria in February 1858, resigning in June 1859, when Lord Derby&#x27;s government fell. Victoria regretted her departure, calling her &quot;a very pleasant, nice, sensible person&quot;. However, allegedly Victoria disapproved of &#x27;her tone, her love of admiration and &quot;fast style.&quot;&#x27; She pointedly declined to invite the Duchess to the wedding of Edward, Prince of Wales and Alexandra, Princess of Wales in 1863. The Duchess soon developed close friendships with both.

==Devonshire House Ball of 1897==
In July 1897, the Duchess hosted the Devonshire House Fancy Dress Ball at Devonshire House, the London residence of the Dukes of Devonshire during the 18th and 19th centuries. The party was a costume ball thrown to celebrate Queen Victoria&#x27;s diamond jubilee. The Queen&#x27;s Private Secretary, Francis Knollys, wrote to the Duchess that the Prince of Wales (who dressed as the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta) thought the party a success. The ball was considered the most important event of the London social season, and was spoken of for many years afterwards. At the ball, the Duchess dressed as Queen Zenobia of Palmyra.

==Marriages and issue==

On 22 July 1852, the twenty-year-old Louisa was married in Hanover to Viscount Mandeville, eldest son and heir of the 6th Duke of Manchester. Upon his father&#x27;s death on 8 August 1855, he succeeded his father as 7th Duke of Manchester, and Louisa became Duchess of Manchester.

They had five children: 
# George Victor Drogo Montagu, 8th Duke of Manchester (1853–1892), who married Consuelo Yznaga (1853–1909), and had issue.
# Lady Mary Louisa Elizabeth Montagu (1854–1934), who was born at Kimbolton Castle and married, firstly, to William Douglas-Hamilton, 12th Duke of Hamilton, at Kimbolton Castle on 10 December 1873, and had issue. She secondly married on 20 July 1897 to Robert Carnaby Forster of Easton Park, Wickham Market, Suffolk (d. 1925), without issue.
# Lady Louisa Augusta Beatrice Montagu (1856–1944), born at Kimbolton Castle. She married Archibald Acheson, 4th Earl of Gosford, on 10 August 1876 in London, and had issue.
# Lord Charles William Augustus Montagu (1860–1939), who married the Hon. Mildred Cecilia Harriet Sturt (1869–1942), daughter of Henry Sturt, 1st Baron Alington, at Kimbolton Castle on 4 December 1930. He had no issue.
# Lady Alice Maude Olivia Montagu (1862–1957), born in London. She married Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby, on 5 January 1889 in London, and had issue.

Louisa became estranged from the Duke, and they lived apart for many years. Louisa became the companion of Spencer Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, and a notable political hostess. The Duke died in Naples on 22 March 1890.

On 16 August 1892, at Christ Church, Mayfair, the sixty-year-old Dowager Duchess of Manchester married Lord Hartington, by then the 8th Duke of Devonshire. She thereby became Duchess of Devonshire, with a nickname of the &quot;Double Duchess&quot;.

With the Duke of Devonshire&#x27;s death on 24 March 1908, she was widowed for the second time, becoming the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire. On 14 July 1911, she suffered a seizure at the Sandown Races. She was taken to nearby Esher Park, and died there on 15 July, aged 79; she was interred at Edensor, near Chatsworth, in Derbyshire.

<doc id="1208614" wikidata="Q305512" url="?curid=1208614" title="Charlotte Montagu Douglas Scott, Duchess of Buccleuch">
<text>Charlotte Anne Montagu Douglas Scott, Duchess of Buccleuch and Queensberry, VA (&quot;née&quot; Thynne; 10 April 1811 – 18 March 1895) was a British peeress. A daughter of Thomas Thynne, 2nd Marquess of Bath, Charlotte married Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 5th Duke of Buccleuch in 1829. They had seven children, including William Montagu Douglas Scott, 6th Duke of Buccleuch; Henry Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu of Beaulieu; and the Royal Navy admiral Lord Charles Montagu Douglas Scott.

From 1841 to 1846, the Duchess of Buccleuch served as the Mistress of the Robes to Queen Victoria as a member of Robert Peel&#x27;s ministry. Her husband, a staunch Conservative, also served in Peel&#x27;s ministry, and the Duchess used the connection to gain patronage for her brothers. She and the Queen remained lifelong friends, with the latter serving as godmother to Charlotte&#x27;s daughter Lady Victoria. The Duchess advised her on Scotland, and later converted to Roman Catholicism in 1860. She engaged in philanthropic efforts in Scotland, and died in 1895 at Ditton Park.

==Family and early life==
Lady Charlotte Anne Thynne was born at the Thynne family seat of Longleat in Wiltshire on 10 April 1811. She was the youngest daughter and tenth child of Thomas Thynne, 2nd Marquess of Bath and the Hon. Isabella Elizabeth Byng, daughter of George Byng, 4th Viscount Torrington. Her siblings included Henry Thynne, 3rd Marquess of Bath; Elizabeth Campbell, Countess Cawdor and Louisa Lascelles, Countess of Harewood.

==Marriage==
On 13 March 1829 Charlotte married Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 5th Duke of Buccleuch at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, London, becoming Duchess of Buccleuch and Queensberry. He had succeeded to the dukedom at the age of thirteen upon his father&#x27;s death, and was five years older than his wife. According to the contemporary journal &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Realm&quot;, their &quot;romantic&quot; engagement resulted when the young Duke visited her father and met Lady Charlotte. Upon their parting, he saw tears in her eyes which prompted him to turn his coach around and approach her father directly to ask for her hand in marriage. The couple would produce three daughters and four sons. Among their children were William Montagu Douglas Scott, 6th Duke of Buccleuch and Henry Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu of Beaulieu.

==Later life==
In 1841, she succeeded the Duchess of Sutherland as Mistress of the Robes to Queen Victoria. The new prime minister, Robert Peel, personally selected her to be a member of his newly formed ministry. The post would later also be filled by her daughter-in-law Louisa. Her husband was a staunch Conservative and became Lord Privy Seal in Peel&#x27;s ministry from 1842 to 1846; the Duchess used the connection to help her brothers gain patronage.

The Duchess of Buccleuch and Queen Victoria were lifelong friends, with the monarch describing the Duchess as &quot;an agreeable, sensible, clever little person.&quot; In 1842 at Buckingham Palace, during Queen Victoria&#x27;s preparations to visit Scotland, the Duchess helped advise her on the country. The Duke and Duchess helped entertain the Queen and Prince Albert when they arrived at Dalkeith. The historian Alex Tyrrell writes that the Duchess helped &quot;consolidate Conservative influence in the royal household and counteract memories of the Bedchamber Crisis.&quot; The Queen stood as godmother for the Duchess&#x27;s eldest daughter Victoria Alexandrine, who was christened at Buckingham Palace in April 1845. The Montagu-Douglas-Scotts were patrons of the artist Robert Thorburn, and commissioned him to paint several portraits of the Duchess, including a double portrait of her and Lady Victoria; this was given to Queen Victoria in 1847.

The Duchess of Buccleuch resigned the post of Mistress of the Robes in 1846, and was succeeded by the Duchess of Sutherland. She was a member of the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert, Third Class.

The Duchess&#x27;s high church faith was an influence of her brother Revd Lord John Thynne, who was high church canon of Westminster Abbey. She and her husband built St Mary the Virgin, an Episcopal church in Dalkeith. To the Duke&#x27;s distress, she converted to Roman Catholicism in 1860, &quot;after struggling with her conscience for many years over the distress it would cause her Presbyterian husband.&quot; Soon after being married, she befriended Cecil, Marchioness of Lothian, another prominent Roman Catholic in Scotland. The two engaged in philanthropic work in Edinburgh together, and Lady Lothian helped persuade the Duchess to come to the decision to convert. Her brother Lord Charles also converted to Catholicism.

The Duchess enjoyed gardening and landscaping, and spent much time overseeing the gardens of Drumlanrig Castle. Her husband died in April 1884, and she moved to Ditton Park in Slough, Buckinghamshire. She was much affected by the death of her son Lord Walter; &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Realm&quot; wrote that the Dowager Duchess &quot;never recovered&quot; from this. She died at Ditton Park on 28 March 1895, and was buried at Dalkeith Palace. She supported the religious congregation Poor Servants of the Mother of God until her death, and had engaged in other fund-raising activities as well.

The Duchess was portrayed by actress Diana Rigg during Series 2 of the television drama &quot;Victoria&quot;.

==Children==
The Duke and Duchess of Buccleuch had a total of seven children, three daughters and four sons:

<text>Captain Richard Been Stannard, (21 August 1902 – 22 July 1977) was a British sailor, officer in the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR), and a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Stannard was awarded the first VC to the RNR in the Second World War.

==Early life==
In February 1912, when Stannard was ten, his father was lost at sea along with the steamer &quot;Mount Oswald&quot;, of which he was captain. For the next five years Stannard studied at the Royal Naval Merchant School in Wokingham, Berkshire. He then entered the Merchant Service aged 15.

==Victoria Cross==
Stannard was 37 years old, and a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC).

From 28 April to 2 May 1940 at Namsos, Norway, HMT &quot;Arab&quot; survived 31 bombing attacks in five days. On one occasion during this period Lieutenant Stannard and two of his crew tackled for two hours a fire on the jetty caused by a bomb igniting ammunition. Part of the jetty was saved, which proved invaluable at the subsequent evacuation. Later feats included the destruction of an enemy bomber whose pilot, thinking that he had HMT &quot;Arab&quot; at his mercy, ordered that she be steered into captivity.

In the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 5 December 1944, Stannard was mentioned in despatches for distinguished service while commanding HMS &quot;Peacock&quot; in the protection of convoys to North Russia in the face of attacks by U-boats.

==Later life==

Before and after the war Stannard settled in Essex before later emigrating to Australia. He died in Sydney on 22 July 1977. The local council erected a blue plaque to him on his former house in The Avenue, Loughton, Essex. In his birth town of Blyth, Northumberland a multi-use building on Bridge Street has been given the name Richard Stannard House (1999), and there is a blue plaque displayed there.

<text>Fanni Luukkonen (13 March 1882 – 27 October 1947) was the longtime leader of the Finnish Lotta Svärd, a voluntary auxiliary organisation for women.

== Early life and education ==
Fanni Marie Luukkonen was born in Helsinki, the middle child and only daughter of Katariina Sofia (née Palmgren) and Olli Luukkonen. She was born into what was then the Grand Duchy of Finland, an autonomous state ruled by the Russian Empire. The family moved to Oulu immediately after her birth with her older brother Mauritz Emil. The family lived on the island of Kiikel, off the coast of Oulur, where her father was a machine operator at the town&#x27;s first electric power station. The family were religious (Protestant), supporters of temperance, and enjoyed spending time at sea, which had a lifelong impact on their daughter. The young Fanni was a good sailor and keen on sports, particularly gymnastics.

Luukkonen studied at the Oulu Girls&#x27; School where her class teacher was Angelika Wenell (1857–1940), a well-known advocate of pentecostalism, who had a strong influence on her future outlook. Luukkonen later studied at the Finnish Further Education College in Helsinki.

== Teaching career ==
On 15 February 1899, the February Manifesto, a legislative act by Emperor of Russia Nicholas II was published. It defined the laws of the Grand Duchy of Finland which also concerned the interest of the Russian Empire, and only allowed the Diet of Finland an advisory role in passing laws. This set the scene for the first period of Russian oppression in the country and the start of the Russification of Finland in the period up to the end of the Russian Empire. The manifesto had a shocking effect on the young Luukkonen and her fellow students; the young women of the Postgraduate School were dressed in black all spring after the Manifesto was published. She later wrote that &quot;This first patriotic twinge was deepened by the continuing events of the royal years, which provided a compelling impetus to take part in the constitutional struggle. It was followed by the great strikes, which a person who loved his country lived not to forget, but to prepare for something greater.&quot;

She graduated secondary school in 1902 and qualified as a primary school teacher in 1906. Her first teaching job was in Oulu from 1906 to 1913, then she moved to teach in Sortavala, in Finnish Karelia, between 1913 and 1931 as head teacher of a girls&#x27; training school. Her mother Sofia Luukkonen moved with her, and took care of their household until her death in 1921. It was during this time that Luukkonen&#x27;s sense of Finnish nationalism and patriotism grew stronger as the town suffered from Russian oppression.

== Joining the Lotta Svärd ==
The town of Sortavala was in the Ladogan Karelia area and had been a centre of the growing Finnish independence and nationalism movement in the late 19th century, which was not approved of by the Russian authorities, whose oppression and retaliation was particularly harsh. Teachers and students at the college had to be cautious but the oppression led to an increase of nationalist spirit and activism. Luukkonen and many of her compatriots became more radical in their approach to the patriotic calls for action.

The 1917 February Revolution and the subsequent Russian Revolution resulted in the Finnish Declaration of Independence from Russia on 6 December 1917. This, coupled with the turmoil of the First World War led to political conditions became unsettled. In the autumn of 1917 a White Guard (Civil guard militia corps) unit was founded in Sortavala by the town council, and in January 1918, they launched a surprise attack and seized weapons from the remaining Russian troops.The Finnish Civil War (27 January 1918 – 15 May 1918) broke out between White Finland and Red Finland for control of the country. The Red Guards, led by a section of the Social Democratic Party, were composed of industrial and agrarian workers, and controlled the cities and industrial centres of southern Finland. The White Guards, controlled by the senate, opposed socialism and were assisted late in the war by the German Imperial Army. The faction represented land owners and the middle and upper classes, controlled rural central and northern Finland, and was led by General C. G. E. Mannerheim. With the start of the war most of the male students at the college left for the front, and the college buildings were requisitioned by the military. Luukkonen undertook auxiliary work in support of the soldiers, alongside many other women. For three years she lived in the college surrounded military barracks and got to know life in a military installation at close quarters. She became aware of the sort of work women could do to support military operations and how such work could be organised. This gave her a clear idea of what kind of tasks the Defence Forces could offer women.

The White prevailed, with support of German troops and Finland moved into the German sphere of influence, but as an independent, democratic republic. About 36,000 Finns died in the conflict and its impact affected the nation for decades. After the Civil War, Fanni Luukkonen joined the Lotta Svärd women&#x27;s organisation and was elected district secretary in 1921. She became known for her work ethic and in 1925 she became a member of the central board of Lotta Svärd. In 1929 she was unanimously elected president of the organisation, succeeding Helmi Arneberg-Pentti.

By the time Luukkonen became president, the organisation had around 60,000 members. Under her leadership by 1938 membership was at over 100,000 women, and during the war years the figure continued to rise, so that when the organisation was finally dissolved in 1945, there were over 240,000 lottas. Lotta Svärd was become the largest women&#x27;s organisation in Finland, and remains the largest ever voluntary association of Finnish women to date.

== Second World War: the Winter War and the Continuation War ==

During the Second World War, about 90,000 Lottas worked in the Finnish Defence Forces.

The Winter War began when the Soviet Union invaded Finland on 30 November 1939, three months after the outbreak of World War II. It ended with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940, after significant Soviet Union losses but with Finland cededing 9% of its territory to the Soviet Union. After this conflict, the Lottas training was improved, as the Winter War had revealed how much more training was needed by the Lottas, and others. Luukkonen supervised some of the most important courses at Tuusula, where a Lotta college had been founded before the war near the Civil Guard officers&#x27; school there. In June 1940, Marshal Mannerheim appeared at one of these training courses to award Luukkonen the Order of the Cross of Liberty first class. She was the first woman to receive this decoration, and was awarded it with a red (wartime) ribbon, to be worn around the neck like soldiers. The only other woman to have received this medal is Elisabeth Rehn, a former minister and UN delegate, who was awarded it in 2002 for her work in peacetime.
There was 15 months of Interim Peace in Finland during which the government gradually moved closer to Germany in order to fend off perceived Soviet aggression and the Soviet interference in Finnish domestic politics. Finland later perceived co-operation with Germany as offering the potenil to reclaim areas ceded to the Soviet Union during the Winter War. Two days after the beginning of Nazi Germany&#x27;s Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 Soviet–Finnish hostilities resumed with start of the Continuation War between Finland and the Soviet Union.

Again, the Lottas stepped up to support the armed forces in auxiliary roles. Luukkonen travelled the country from Lapland to the Karelian Isthmus, as well as over the border to the Dvina and Onega regions which had previously been Finnish territory. She sometimes hosted foreign visitors interested Lotta Svärd&#x27;s activities under front-line conditions. She gave lectures and talks, in Finland and abroad, on the history and activities of the Lottas, and build relationships with other Scandinavian and Baltic Lotta organisations. The Finnish Lotta organisation was well regarded in Germany, and Luukkonen visited Nazi German dictator Adolf Hitler&#x27;s headquarters on 19 May 1943 where she received the Order of the German Eagle with Star from Hitler for her role in &quot;the fight against Bolshevism&quot;. She was the only non-German woman to be awarded this medal.

== Post war ==
The terms of the peace agreement with the Soviet Union at the end of the 1941-1944 Continuation War, included the abolition of the Lotta Svärd organisation and the White Guard. Immediately after the announcement of the Lotta Svärd disollution, Luukkonen was awarded the Order of the Cross of Liberty 1st Class with a grand star - the highest decoration ever granted to a woman in Finland. The end of the Lotta Svärd this meant a major life change for Luukkonen: she lived in Helsinki on her small pension, doing temporary translation work. After the war, she was insulted and received anonymous letters of slander for her previous role, which was branded anti-Soviet. The mental pressure of the time worsened her already poor health. She was considered persona non grata and may have been kept under surveillance, with travel to the Nordic countries made difficult.

Fanni Luukkonen died of a heart attack age 65 on 27 October 1947 in Helsinki. She was buried in the family grave in Kruununsaari cemetery in Ii, Finland. The stone on her grave reads &quot;Fatherland is God&#x27;s idea&quot;.

== Legacy and commemoration ==
There is a plaque commemorating Fanni Luukkonen at Tehtaankatu 21 in Helsinki, and another plaque at Heinätori School in Oulu.

In the 2004 Suuret Suomalaiset (&quot;Greatest Finns&quot;) competition (similar to the 100 Greatest Britons) Fanni Luukkonen was voted for 44th place.

A documentary film Sotalotta, by Raimo Salo, has been made about the life of Fanni Luukkonen, the leader of the Lottas. Interviews in the film revealed how difficult it was for Luukkonen to disband the organisation and how the Lottos felt that their leader was treated harshly.

<doc id="1208625" wikidata="Q2384352" url="?curid=1208625" title="Roemer Visscher">
<text>Roemer Pieterszoon Visscher (1547 – 19 February 1620) was a successful Dutch merchant, the first Dutch underwriter and writer of the Dutch Golden Age.

==Life==
Visscher was born in and lived in Amsterdam and was an important and central figure of the cultural scene there and member of the &quot;rederijkerskamer&quot; &quot;De Eglantier&quot; with as slogan &quot;In liefde bloeiende&quot; (&quot;Blossoming in love&quot;). Other members of this scene were the Dutch writers P.C. Hooft, Bredero and Vondel. Vondel called Visschers house &quot;het saligh Roemers huys&quot; (&quot;delightful house of Roemer&quot;), because artists of all kinds visited his house on the Gelderse Kade in Amsterdam, varying from painters to poets. Roemer was the father of three daughters Maria Tesselschade Visscher, Gertruid, and Anna Visscher.

==Works==
The humanistic and moralistic content of his works belongs to the period of the Renaissance, although the form was more conservative and characteristic to the &quot;rederijkers&quot;. Visscher was a specialist in the epigram, but he also wrote emblemata. The emblemata is a genre in which pictures are accompanied by one or two rhyming sentences. An example of the emblemata is Visschers Sinnepoppen. One emblema is called &quot;Elck wat wils&quot; which is still a common expression in Dutch, meaning &quot;To each his own&quot;.

Among his works are:
*&quot;T&#x27;loff vande mutse, ende van een blaewe scheen&quot; (1612)
*&quot;Brabbeling&quot; (1614)
*&quot;Sinnepoppen&quot; (1614)

<doc id="1208626" wikidata="Q935837" url="?curid=1208626" title="Jetstar Asia">
<text>Jetstar Asia Airways Pte Ltd (operating as Jetstar Asia) is a Singaporean low-cost airline headquartered at Changi Airport. It operates services to regional destinations in Southeast Asia to countries such as Myanmar, Cambodia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. It also flies to regional routes in East Asia such as Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong. 

Established in 2004, it is the main feeder airline for its parent company Jetstar Airways for passengers flying into Australia. It is one of the Asian offshoots of parent Jetstar Airways, the other being Jetstar Japan, the low-cost subsidiary airline of Australia&#x27;s Qantas. It uses a fleet of Airbus A320 aircraft.

==Background==
Jetstar Asia was launched in 2004 as a partnership between Qantas, holding a 49% stake in the airline, Singaporean businessmen Tony Chew (22%) and FF Wong (10%) and the Singapore government&#x27;s investment company, Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited (19%). It received its Air Operator&#x27;s Certificate from the Singapore government on 19 November 2004.

Due to its belated entry into the market, the airline differentiated itself from its competitors by flying further; anywhere within a 5-hour radius from Singapore while its competitors flew to destinations within a 4-hour radius from Singapore. The airline announced 7 routes to Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taipei, Pattaya, Jakarta, Surabaya and Manila; the most ambitious start-up plan compared to any of its Asian rivals, which would have given it the widest international coverage.

Online ticketing commenced at 0800 hours (8GMT) on 7 December 2004, a day after the first three routings and their promotional prices were announced, namely S$48 (HK$228) to Hong Kong, S$88 (NT1788) to Taipei and S$28 (Bht725) to Pattaya on a one-way ticket for all seats in the first week of operations as each routing was launched. Flights to Manila began in 2005. As part of its differentiation, Jetstar flew to Ninoy Aquino International Airport instead of the cheaper Clark International Airport in Angeles City.

However, services to certain announced destinations (Shanghai, Jakarta and Surabaya) could not be started. The delay of flights to Shanghai was because China&#x27;s aviation authority did not allow foreign budget airlines flying to both Shanghai and Beijing airports. Flights to Indonesia were also not allowed as Indonesia&#x27;s government embarked a policy of protectionism for its own low-budget airlines. Existing flights by low-fare airlines, such as Valuair&#x27;s flights to Jakarta and Denpasar as well as Tiger Airways&#x27; service to Padang, were not revoked.

==Timeline==
Despite facing a difficult market, Jetstar Asia took delivery of a fifth aircraft in 2005 and sought approval for new routes. Jetstar planned to lease the aircraft from Atlasjet Airways, but the aircraft was later withdrawn from the lease arrangement. Discussions were held with Qantas to source additional aircraft. In 2005, the budget carrier began seeking approval from Cambodian authorities to fly to Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, and was eventually granted rights.

Hot on the heels of Tiger Airways&#x27; success on the Phuket route, Jetstar Asia announced 4 times weekly flights to Phuket. The flight commenced on 25 October 2005, however due to inconsistent demand and better opportunities elsewhere, Jetstar announced the suspension of flights to Phuket on 27 March 2008.

By the end of December, it was clear that Jetstar Asia was bleeding cash and its investors were struggling to finance the airline. On 2 December 2005, Jetstar Asia announced that its chief executive officer (CEO), Ken Ryan, was stepping down to return to Australia. Mr Ryan would take on a new management role at Orange Star&#x27;s majority shareholder Qantas and was replaced at the helm by Neil Thompson. On 9 February 2006, Jetstar Asia appointed Singaporean Chong Phit Lian as the airline&#x27;s new CEO, replacing interim CEO Neil Thompson.

On 26 July 2006, Qantas decided to re-position both of its Jetstar ventures in Australia and Singapore as a single brand. This was followed by a launch of Jetstar&#x27;s long-haul operations to six destinations in South-east Asia from Australia.

On 15 September 2006, Jetstar Asia became the first international airline to land at Bangkok&#x27;s Suvarnabhumi Airport.

On 16 April 2008, Jetstar Asia announced that it had reported a profit ahead of schedule, and ahead of local rival Tiger Airways. Both Jetstar Asia and sister airline Valuair saw a 20% increase in revenue, a 4% rise in passenger load and an overall 20% jump in passenger carriage for the year ending March 2008. The airline&#x27;s CEO attributes its success to better brand awareness as well as an increased utilisation of aircraft, growing revenue and a broadening of the earning base. Bruce Buchanan (Rokt co-founder) was CEO of Jetstar from 2008 until he stepped down in 2012. 

On 16 April 2008, the company announced that it had achieved profitability for the year ended 31 March 2008, with an increase of 20% in the number of passengers carried and a passenger load factor of over 75%, an increase of 4% over the previous year. Jetstar Asia carried 2.7 million passengers during the year to 30 June 2011, an increase of 18% on the previous year, and saw Revenue passenger kilometres increase by 39.7%, as long-haul flights from Singapore to Auckland and Melbourne using Airbus A330 aircraft were launched.

In March 2011, Jetstar launched flights to Hangzhou, China.

In 2015, the airline added Palembang, Pekanbaru and Da Nang. In November 2017, the airline added Clark, Hat Yai and Okinawa. The airline announced its first destination in South Asia, Colombo, in 2020. However, the launch was delayed due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic on 17 March 2020, Jetstar Asia announced that it would suspend all flights between 23 March and 15 April, grounding all their planes and asking their staff to take leave. This suspension was extended first until 18 May and then until 31 May. On 21 April 2020, Jetstar Asia announced that it would start some flights but mainly to repatriate citizens and permanent residents to Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. On 25 June, the airline announced that it was cutting up to 180 people, almost a quarter of the workforce in Singapore. At the same time they would allow the retirement of five of their A320 fleet, bringing the total down to 13.

==Merger with Valuair==
Jetstar Asia and Valuair, another Singapore-based airline, merged on 24 July 2005, in the first major consolidation of South-east Asia&#x27;s crowded and competitive low-cost airline industry. The airlines released a joint statement saying they would continue to operate their normal routes under their own brands in the meantime, with little or no change to the service offered by either airline. Qantas CEO and Jetstar Asia chairman Geoff Dixon chaired the new company. Jetstar Asia CEO Chong Phit Lian was appointed as the chief executive of both airlines. The new company was due to receive a cash injection of more than 50 million Singapore dollars in fresh capital into the new entity, largely to be provided by Qantas. Shareholders of Valuair, including airline-industry veteran Lim Chin Beng, Malaysia&#x27;s Star Cruises and Asiatravel.com, have now become minority shareholders in the merged company, Orange Star. Qantas owns 42.5% of both airlines after the merger.

In October 2014, following the Indonesian government lifting operational restrictions on foreign-owned low-cost carriers into Indonesia, Valuair was dissolved and its flights were taken over by Jetstar Asia on 26 October 2014.

==Management changes==
In December 2011, the airline announced that CEO Chong Phit Lian was to step down from 1 February 2012 after leading the airline for six years, to pursue opportunities outside the aviation sector. Chong remained a member of the Jetstar Asia board. Paul Daff, formerly head of Jetconnect, the Qantas Group subsidiary airline in New Zealand and previously Head of Commercial for Jetstar Asia, acted as interim CEO while a successor was recruited.

In March 2012, it was announced that Barathan Pasupathi, former CFO of Jetstar Asia, had been appointed as CEO to take effect from 2 July 2012. He resigned the post effective 1 March 2024, and John Simeone was appointed as the new CEO.

<text>Gillian Clarke (born 8 June 1937) is a Welsh poet and playwright, who also edits, broadcasts, lectures and translates from Welsh into English. She co-founded Tŷ Newydd, a writers&#x27; centre in North Wales.

==Life==

Gillian Clarke was born on 8 June 1937 in Cardiff.

==Career==
After university, Clarke spent a year working for the BBC in London. She then returned to Cardiff, where she gave birth to her daughter, Catrin, and two sons. About Catrin she wrote a poem under her name. Clarke worked as an English teacher, first at the Reardon-Smith Nautical College and later at Newport College of Art.

In the mid-1980s she moved to rural Ceredigion, West Wales, with her second husband, after which she spent some years teaching creative writing at the University of Glamorgan. In 1990 she was a co-founder of Tŷ Newydd, a writers&#x27; centre in North Wales.

Her poetry is studied by GCSE and A Level students throughout the United Kingdom. A considerable number of her poems are used in the GCSE AQA Anthology. She has given poetry readings and lectures in Europe and the United States; her work has been translated into ten languages. Some of her English poems were translated into Chinese by Peter Jingcheng Xu and published in the journal &quot;Foreign Literature and Art&quot; (Issue 6, December 2016).

Clarke has published numerous collections of poetry for adults and children (see below), as well as dramatic commissions and articles in a wide range of publications. She is a former editor of &quot;The Anglo-Welsh Review&quot; (1975–84) and the current president of Tŷ Newydd. Several of her books have received a Poetry Book Society Recommendation. In 1999, Gillian Clarke received the Glyndŵr Award for an &quot;Outstanding Contribution to the Arts in Wales&quot; during the Machynlleth Festival. She was on the judging panel for the 2008 Manchester Poetry Prize. Clarke reads her poetry for teenagers who are taking their English GCSE school exams. She is part of the GCSE Poetry Live team that also includes John Agard, Simon Armitage, Carol Ann Duffy, Imtiaz Dharker, Moniza Alvi, Grace Nichols, Daljit Nagra and Choman Hardi.

In December 2013, Clarke was the guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. She has written over 100 poems during her career.

==Awards==
In 2008, Gillian Clarke became the third National Poet of Wales. She held the post until 2016, when she was succeeded by Ifor ap Glyn. In 2010 she was awarded the Queen&#x27;s for Poetry and became the second Welsh person to receive the honour.

In 2011 Clarke joined the Gorsedd of Bards. In 2012 she received the Wilfred Owen Association Poetry award.

The book &quot;Ice&quot; was shortlisted for the T. S. Eliot Prize in 2012.

<text>The International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation (CIC) (French: &quot;Conseil International de la Chasse et de la Conservation du Gibier&quot;, German: &quot;Internationaler Rat zur Erhaltung des Wildes und der Jagd&quot;) is a politically independent not-for-profit international organisation, aiming to preserve wildlife through the promotion of sustainable use of wildlife resources. The initialism &quot;CIC&quot; comes from the organisation&#x27;s original French name &quot;Conseil International de la Chasse&quot;.

The idea to establish an international hunting organization stemmed from an international conference in the small southern Slovak town of Nové Zamky in November, 1928. Building on this idea, the CIC was subsequently registered and founded in Paris two years later during its inaugural general assembly in November, 1930. Until 1999, the Administrative Office of the CIC was in Paris. Today, the CIC has its Administrative Office in Hungary. The organisation is headquartered in Vienna, Austria. The organisation unites 27 state members (represented by ministries responsible for wildlife management and conservation, or the delegated institution), a wide range of organisations engaged in hunting and conservation, as well as individuals such as private members and scientific experts from over 80 countries. The organisation has diplomatic status in Hungary, and observer status at the United Nations.

The official languages of the CIC are English, French, and German.

==History==
The idea of establishing an international organisation dealing with sustainable hunting and wildlife management was first brought up in 1910 at the occasion of an international hunting exhibition in Vienna. The concept was however translated into concrete action in 1928 only, by French lawyer Maxime Ducrocq and Count Louis Károlyi, who organised an international conference in Nové Zámky, Slovakia, in view of establishing an international hunting organisation. Many of the discussions took place in the manor of Count Károlyi in Palárikovo, which now serves as the CIC Museum. The conference resulted in the &quot;Declaration of Nové Zámky&quot; calling for the foundation of an international hunting council named &quot;Conseil International de la Chasse&quot; and the formation of a commission which was to work out the Statutes of the CIC. This was the basis for the first general assembly and the official registration of the CIC in November 1930 in Paris.

From the beginning, the CIC has promoted ideals for sustainable and ethical hunting, stressing that hunting and the conservation of wildlife go hand in hand, and gaining global recognition as an independent advisor in the field of wildlife conservation.

==Organisational structure==

The organs of the CIC are the:
* General Assembly
* Executive Committee
* Council (Executive Committee members + Heads of National Delegations)
* National Delegations

==Divisions==
The activities of the CIC are streamlined into three Divisions:

==Members==
The CIC has over 1700 members in over 80 countries. Its membership consists of states, national and international organisations, individual members, as well as experts and sponsors, advocates of the CIC and sustainable use around the world. The CIC also has some 40 National Delegations, which are responsible for coordinating activities in their respective countries. 
* State Members are representatives of states, government agencies or national public institutions. 
* Association Members are representatives of national or international non-governmental organisations.
* Individual Members form the majority of CIC membership.
* Experts in the field of wildlife conservation and hunting contribute to the goals and objectives of the CIC through their special expertise.
* Young Opinion Members are less than 40 years old and promote the voice and opinions of the next generation.
* Sponsor members are representatives of the private sector committed to wildlife conservation and sustainable use.

==Headquarters==
The current President of the CIC is Philipp Harmer. The current Director-General is Sebastian Winkler.


==Working Groups==
===Young Opinion (YO)===
The CIC Working Group – Young Opinion focuses on creating a global network of young conservationists under the age of 40 who are enthusiastic about wildlife and its sustainable management, in line with the views of the CIC.

The YO was launched at the 48th General Assembly of the CIC in 2000. Today, under the guidance of Krzysztof Kowalewski, President of the YO, the working group is promoting the values of the CIC through regular activities and events mainly focused on youth education and promoting game meat as a positive example of sustainable hunting.

Several international events have been held since the foundation of the Young Opinion Working Group. An example is the annual assembly the &quot;Global Youth for Sustainable Use&quot; (GYSU) – a multiple day event including scientific symposia and cultural exchange. The first GYSU event took place in 2005, and has since been organised by delegations from various countries every year.

One of the projects under the working group is the CIC Young Opinion Research Award – aimed at supporting researchers whose projects contribute to the sustainable use of wildlife for the benefit of natural heritage conservation. Thereby, the goal of the award is to promote scientific research in accordance with the spirit of the CIC&#x27;s convictions.

===Artemis===
Recognising and advocating the role of women in the field of hunting, the CIC Artemis Working Group (WG) was founded in 2011 with the aim of uniting huntresses and women dedicated to sustainable use issues. Members of the Artemis WG are active in the field of environmental education, hunting culture and gastronomy, and in general as advocates for the role of women in wildlife management around the globe. The President is Soňa Chovanová Supeková.

==Partnerships==
The CIC maintains alliances for promoting sustainable use as well as furthering wildlife policy and law development worldwide. Its main partners are:

United Nations Institutions: FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme), UNDP (United Nations Development Programme), UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization)

Environmental Conventions: CBD (Convention on Biological Diversity); CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora); CMS (Convention on Migratory Species), with which a partnership agreement was signed in 2005; AEWA (Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds); Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (Berne Convention); Ramsar Convention on Wetlands

International Non-Governmental Organisations: IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature); Wetlands International; IAF (International Association for Falconry); FACE (Federation of Associations for Hunting and Conservation of the European Union); IUGB (International Union of Game Biologists).

National Non-Governmental Organisations: The National Delegations of the CIC are also working together with NGOs of relevance to national or regional aspects of hunting and wildlife conservation.

The partnership originated in 2011 as an idea from the former Vice-chair of the CPW and past President of the Policy &amp; Law Division of the CIC, Mr. Jan Heino. The inaugural Chair of the partnership was Mr. Braulio F. de Souza Dias, former Executive Secretary of Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) holding the secretariat.

The CPW is a voluntary partnership of international organisations with substantive mandates and programs for the sustainable use and conservation of wildlife resources. The Mission of the CPW is: to promote conservation through the sustainable management of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife in all biomes and geographic areas and to increase cooperation and coordination on sustainable wildlife management issues among its members and partners.

Today, the CPW unites fourteen international organisations, including the CIC, aiming to allow for a holistic and integrated approach to wildlife issues globally.

The first 1st Meeting of the CPW took place in Bangkok, Thailand, in March 2013 at the occasion of the 16th CITES Conference of the Parties (CoP).

===CIC - FAO===
The collaboration between the CIC and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) dates back to the year 2002. The joint work led to the analysis and documentation of the main weaknesses of current environmental policy and legislation and the priority needs for technical support of countries seeking to improve their legal documents. The outcomes of this partnership on wildlife included a series of joint CIC-FAO publications (Technical Series).

In past, the CIC together with FAO, worked on an international, online database of wildlife management legislation entitled WildlifeLex. Its aim was to serve as a platform for hosting and linking wildlife management legislations, including key statistics, best practice examples and other relevant materials, from different countries and regions.

==General Assemblies==
The General Assembly is the highest organ of the CIC. The First General Assembly of the CIC was the constituting assembly in Paris in 1930. Thereafter, it became an annual event, taking place in one of the member countries of the CIC. 
Events include not only the meeting of the permanent members, but also partners, representatives of organisations from UN agencies, the Federation of Associations for Hunting and Conservation of the EU (FACE), the International Union of Game Biologists (IUGB), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the European Landowners&#x27; Organisation (ELO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and major international conventions such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), as well as government delegations, national and international hunting organisations and wildlife experts.

The core program of the General Assemblies is split into three main parts as per the Divisions. In addition, there are focused meetings of working groups and experts from different countries.

The Jubilee 60th General Assembly of the CIC took place in the three countries: Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, from 26–30 April 2013 – the core area where the concept of the CIC was developed in the early 20th century. Experts gathered to discuss the topic of wildlife management under the motto &quot;Hunting: Conserving Wildlife – Key to Global Cultural Heritage&quot;.

The 61st General Assembly was hosted by the Italian Delegation of the CIC, in the city of Milan, from the 23–26 April 2014. &quot;Hunting, Youth and Biodiversity&quot; will be the main theme of the 61st General Assembly, with the &quot;fight against wildlife crime&quot; forming an important sub-topic, with a Global Summit entitled &quot;Hunters United Against Wildlife Crime&quot; being organised in the framework of the event. A symposium on &quot;Hunting Ungulates between Tradition and Innovation: the Naturalist Hunter for Sustainable Wildlife Management&quot; preceded the events of the 61st General Assembly on the 23 April 2014.

&quot;Healthy Wildlife – Healthy People&quot;. With this motto the 62nd General Assembly in Pravets, Bulgaria, raised awareness on the fact that the purpose of wildlife conservation is not only to promote biodiversity richness, but also to keep our own human existence at a healthy, balanced level. Wildlife diseases are of great concern to hunters everywhere in the world. Wildlife diseases may result in declining wildlife population numbers and genetic diversity and may have long-term effects on habitats and ecosystems. Certain wildlife diseases can be transmitted to domestic livestock or vice versa, resulting in economic stress being placed on rural communities and national economies. Some zoonotic diseases entail great health risk to the human population with a range of serious consequences. Hunters are the largest group in society that voluntarily interacts with wildlife closely and frequently. The World Organization of Animal Health (OIE), being the global platform of veterinarians, and CIC, as a global organization promoting conservation through the sustainable use of wildlife, understood this need for strong cooperation and took action. As keynote speaker Dr. Bernard Vallat, OIE Director General, addressed the CIC General Assembly during the Opening Ceremony. He called upon hunters and the CIC to make the most of the force they represent in the field: protecting biodiversity, and acting as sentinels for the protection of public health. Vallat made a strong case for hunter training in the detection, monitoring, and control of wildlife diseases. The patron of the 62nd General Assembly, was the Prime Minister of Bulgaria, H.E. Boyko Borisov, who viewed the selection Pravets as place for the 62nd General Assembly as recognition of Bulgaria&#x27;s successful and well-known wildlife management in recent years. After a strong decline of big game 10 to 15 years ago, Bulgaria managed to bring back the wildlife populations to a healthy level for the benefit of future generations.

The 63rd General Assembly under the motto &quot;Hunting is Conservation&quot; was organised in Brussels, Belgium, with the aim to foster the participation and dialogue between members and various stakeholders, including governments, international organizations, the scientific and academic communities, so as to promote sustainable hunting and sustainable policies for worldwide wildlife management, so as to create awareness of wildlife problems, motivate commitment at the highest level for their solution, and thus promote better management of sustainable hunting and wildlife conservation at local, regional, national and international levels. Karel Pinxten, Dean of European Court of Auditors, in his welcome remarks, highlighted that hunters are responsible for sustainable hunting practices, predator control, and habitat improvement, and these three areas show our commitment for sustainable hunting. As a keynote speaker, Jyrki Katainen, Vice- President of the European Commission addressed the audience during the Opening Ceremony. The Commissioner for Job, Growth, Investment, and Competitiveness, and an active hunter, highlighted that being a hunter &quot;requires &quot;Responsibility, Sustainability and Transparency&quot;&quot;. He called upon hunters and organizations to make the most of the force they represent. &quot;We should work together on our common conservation goals.&quot; The Opening Ceremony was followed by a panel discussion, &quot;What if we stop hunting?&quot;, where five experts from around the world sat down and discussed the environmental, social, and economic impacts of hunting bans. Addressing an audience of over 300 participants, the session was opened by Karl-Heinz Florenz, Member of the European Parliament and the President of the Intergroup &quot;Biodiversity, Hunting and Countryside&quot;, who suggested that hunters should convince the animal rights activists that they are actually on the same side. Representatives exchanged their points of view and shared their stories. The general outcome was that if hunting is banned, wildlife would suffer and there would be losses of entire populations. According to the panelists, this has already been happening in some areas of Africa where previously stable populations, like that of elephant and rhino, have significantly decreased.

The 64th General Assembly of the International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation (CIC) opened its doors in Montreux, Switzerland, in 2017 with the motto is &quot;Harmony with Wildlife - Urban and Rural Perceptions&quot;. This slogan was selected as over the past couple years, with the rise of easily-accessible media reports and social connectivity, differences in perceptions of hunting and hunters are increasingly conflicting in all areas of the world. These strongly opposing views create a divide among people which is deepened with the increasing presence of media in our lives where information, either correct or not, can reach hundreds of thousands of people in a matter of days. For hunting, a highly emotive topic, this has already proven to be a hindrance its use as a conservation tool, despite its many successes, and it could be detrimental to its future unless we fight back.

The 65th General Assembly of the International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation under the motto &quot;Hunting: Facts or Fables?&quot; was organized in Madrid, Spain, on 4-5 May 2018. During the two day event, the participants discussed and deliberated the aspects of hunting, which are currently under attack by its opponents.

The 66th General Assembly was organised in Windhoek, in the capital of Namibia in 2019 in the framework of an international conference under the theme &quot;Crossroads- Leading the Way for Wildlife Conservation&quot;. The conference, hosted by the Ministry of Environment and Tourism of Namibia, served as a platform for workshop style discussions and presentations on wildlife conservation successes, challenges, and best practices from Namibia, Africa and across the world. At a time when wildlife conservation appears to be at a crossroads, this conference brings together various stakeholders to discuss related issues from African, European, and Global perspectives, as well as taking a unique look at the important roles youth and women will play in the future success of conservation efforts. The ultimate aim being to bring conservation efforts together onto a common path.

The 67th General Assembly of the CIC in 2021 was a special one. Not only was it be hosted in Budapest, the home of the CIC Administrative Office, it was also held within the framework of Hungary’s One with Nature – World of Hunting and Nature Exhibition. As patrons of the event, the CIC was involved in the planning of the exhibition from 2013 onwards. To mark this historic occasion, rurality was chosen as the overarching theme, under the motto “One with Nature - Rural Voices, Global Responsibilities.” Every year the rural-urban divide grows larger, with people becoming increasingly alienated from nature in all parts of the world. The General Assembly therefore looked at the importance of protecting rural areas, and their associated wildlife, habitats and people. This was explored through a series of panel discussions and events at a conference which was held in the framework of the General Assembly.
==Awards and Prizes==
The CIC awards the following prizes:
*Edmond Blanc Prize

This prize is given to hunting areas for excellent hunting practices and special achievements in the management of wildlife.

*Markhor Award

The Markhor Award recognizes and celebrates outstanding conservation performances that link the conservation of biodiversity and human livelihoods to the application of the principles of sustainable use, in particular hunting, as part of wildlife and ecosystem management. The name &quot;Markhor&quot; comes from Pakistan&#x27;s threatened mountain goat species (&quot;Ovis ammon polii&quot;), the population numbers of which have increased substantially in recent years through sustainable hunting tourism.

The award is presented every two years at the Conference of Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD CoP). The award consists of a bronze statue of a Markhor and a financial reward.

*Wildlife Photo Prize

The Wildlife Photo Prize is an international competition on wildlife photography, which is open to all professional or amateur photographers. This bi-annual prize is awarded for the best photographs of wild animals, both mammals and birds, living in their natural environment. The winning photographs are exhibited during the following CIC General Assembly.

*Hunting in Art Prize

Every two years, the CIC discerns the Hunting in Art prize to artists, in recognition of their efforts to enhance the cultural values of nature and hunting. The prize is awarded in the fields of sculpture, painting, museums or a specific exhibit therein, as well as in the field of music.

*Young Opinion Research Award

The CIC Young Opinion Research Award is aimed at supporting researchers whose projects contribute to the sustainable use of wildlife for the benefit of natural heritage conservation. Thereby, the goal of the award is to promote scientific research in accordance with the spirit of the CIC&#x27;s convictions.

*Literature Award

This is an annual award for outstanding publications, presented at the occasion of the CIC General Assembly. The Jury consists of CIC members from different countries, with a total of five award categories:
:* Technical: a work about the research and science of huntable game.
:* Artistic: for exceptionally interesting and artistically valuable publications about huntable game.
:* Literary: for hunting and nature adventures, which communicate the joy of hunting and nature, not only to a small group of people but to a broader public.
:* Environmental: the purpose of this prize is to award published educational works, which support the understanding amongst the general public of the needs of hunting, the hunters, environmental issues, as well as those of game and its natural habitat.
:* Cultural Prizes: for the lifetime work of an author

==Recommendations and Resolutions==
The CIC serves in an advisory role to the governments and environmental organisations regarding questions on sustainable hunting, wildlife management practices and conservation. Thus, the CIC regularly proposes recommendations and resolutions for consideration by the global community.

==Trophy Evaluation System==
Since its inception in the 1920s, the CIC Trophy Evaluation System (TES) has established itself as the leading trophy scoring system throughout Europe, and further afield. Over time, the system has been adapted in order to account for changes in wildlife management. As part of the restructuring of the old TES, the CIC Trophy Measuring Rules and Regulations were adopted in 2012. The TES operates through Senior International Trophy Judges (SITJ) and Certified CIC Measurers, who are eligible to measure trophies on behalf of the CIC and to award CIC points. Each SITJ and Certified CIC Measurer receives an individual Identification Card which serves to officially identify qualified CIC measurers. Together, all SITJ make up the CIC Trophy Evaluation Board (TEB) which is responsible for overseeing the TES and for the training of Certified CIC Measurers.

The International Formulae for the Measurement and Evaluation of Trophies of the CIC, previously known as the Red Book, underwent extensive review and was subsequently published as the &quot;CIC Handbook on the Evaluation and Measuring of Hunting Trophies&quot;.

The TES is part of the Applied Science Division, which also cooperates and coordinates its work with the CIC Administrative Office, CIC Coordination Fora, and official National Hunting Associations and Trophy Measuring Associations registered with the CIC.

==CIC Publications==
The CIC regularly publishes newsletters, reports, magazines and other documents on issues related to its work, in order to raise awareness and provide information about sustainable hunting and relevant topics of concern to conservation.

===CIC Magazines===

The &quot;CIC Magazine&quot; is published twice a year. The magazine contains recent news and information about CIC&#x27;s activities.

===CIC-FAO Technical Series 1-9===
Under the FAO-CIC partnership on wildlife, the following nine joint publications were published:
*Best Practices in Sustainable Hunting
*European Charter on Hunting and Biodiversity
*Principles for Developing Sustainable Wildlife Management Laws

<text>Historic Royal Palaces is an independent charity that manages the United Kingdom&#x27;s unoccupied royal palaces:

* The Tower of London
* Hampton Court Palace
* The State Apartments and Orangery at Kensington Palace 
* The Banqueting House, Whitehall
* Kew Palace with Queen Charlotte&#x27;s Cottage and Great Pagoda at Kew Gardens
Historic Royal Palaces is also responsible for Hillsborough Castle, Northern Ireland, the official residence in Northern Ireland of the King.

Historic Royal Palaces has managed the London palaces since 1989, and Hillsborough Castle since 2014. Occupied royal palaces, such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, are maintained by the Royal Household Property Section, and some are open to the public.

== Constitution ==
Historic Royal Palaces is established as a Royal Charter Body with charitable status.

The objectives of Historic Royal Palaces, as set out in its Royal Charter are, for the benefit of the nation:

* to manage, conserve, renovate, repair, maintain and improve the Palaces to a high standard consistent with their status as buildings of Royal association and historic and/or architectural importance. 
* to help everyone to learn about the Palaces, the skills required for their conservation and the wider story of how monarchs and people together have shaped society by providing public access, by exhibition, by events and education programmes, by the preparation of records, by research and by publication and by such other means as are appropriate.

Historic Royal Palaces is a Public Corporation but receives no funding from either the Government or the Crown, with all of its costs met by self-generated income.

The London palaces themselves are owned by the King in right of the Crown, and Historic Royal Palaces is contracted by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to manage the five London palaces on his behalf. Hillborough Castle is owned by the Government and its management is contracted to Historic Royal Palaces by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.

Historic Royal Palaces&#x27; trading arm, Historic Royal Palaces Enterprises Limited, is company wholly-owned by Historic Royal Palaces responsible for running the charity&#x27;s commercial activities.

=== Governance ===
The Board of Historic Royal Palaces consists of a Chair and eleven Trustees, all non-executive and unpaid. The Chair is appointed by the King on the advice of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. Four Trustees are also appointed by the King, three as ex-officio appointments: the Director of the Royal Collection, the Keeper of the Privy Purse and the Lord Chamberlain. The remaining Trustees are appointed by the Secretary of State, two ex-officio: the Constable of the Tower of London and the Chairman of the Campaign Board. The Chief Executive is granted a general delegation to act on behalf of Trustees, save for reserved matters.

The current Chief Executive is John Barnes, who has been in place since 2017. Lucy Worsley and Tracy Borman are co-curators for the charity.

== Palaces and collections ==

=== Palaces ===

==== Tower of London ====

The Tower of London is a historic castle on the north bank of the River Thames in central London, founded toward the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest. The White Tower, which gives the castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078. The Tower of London has played a prominent role in English history, serving variously as an armoury, a treasury, a prison, a menagerie, the home of the Royal Mint, a public record office, and the home of the Crown Jewels of England. The Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat.

The chief attractions advertised by Historic Royal Palaces at the Tower include the Crown Jewels, the Tower Ravens, the White Tower and surrounding battlements, and St John&#x27;s Chapel.

==== Hampton Court Palace ====

Hampton Court Place is a historic palace located on the north bank of the River Thames near Hampton in Greater London, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. Cardinal Wolsey began construction in 1514 of a royal palace, which was continued and expanded by Henry VIII after Wolsey&#x27;s demise in 1530. Hampton Court Palace went on to become a centre of royal power in the Tudor period. The palace underwent extensive renovation in the Baroque style during the reign of William III, designed by Christopher Wren. Queen Victoria opened the palace to the public in 1838.

Historic Royal Palaces advertises Hampton Court Palace as the &quot;home of Henry VIII&quot;, focussing on the dramas and lives of Henry VIII, his wives and their children in the world of the Tudor court. The baroque palace built for William III and Mary II, 60 acres of gardens and Magic Garden adventure playground are key attractions.

==== The State Apartments and Orangery at Kensington Palace ====

Kensington Palace is a royal residence set in Kensington Gardens, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in London. The State Apartments were renovated in late 19th century and opened to the public (see History).

Historic Royal Palaces advertises Kensington Palace as the birthplace and childhood residence of Queen Victoria, with the Jewel Room (containing jewellery commissioned by Queen Victoria) and the Queen&#x27;s and King&#x27;s State Apartments as key attractions. The Orangery is managed as a cafe and restaurant.

==== The Banqueting House, Whitehall ====

The Banqueting House, on Whitehall in the City of Westminster, central London, is the only large surviving component of the Palace of Whitehall, being one of grandest surviving examples of the architectural genre of banqueting houses in the classical style of Palladian architecture.

The key attraction of the Banqueting House is the opulent decoration of the Banqueting Hall, including the ceiling painting by Rubens commissioned by Charles I. Historic Royal Palaces highlights Banqueting House as the execution site of Charles I.

==== Kew Palace with Queen Charlotte&#x27;s Cottage and Great Pagoda at Kew Gardens ====

Kew Palace is a historic palace within the grounds of Kew Gardens on the south bank of the River Thames, near Kew in Greater London, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. Queen Charlotte&#x27;s Cottage is an 18th-century cottage orné within the grounds of Kew Gardens. The Great Pagoda was built in 1761 by Sir William Chambers as a present for Princess Augusta, the founder of the Kew Gardens.

Historic Royal Palaces advertises Kew Palace as the home of George III and Queen Charlotte. The Royal Kitchens are a key attraction.

==== Hillsborough Castle ====

Hillsborough Castle is a castle located in Royal Hillsborough, County Down, Northern Ireland. The castle is the official residence in Northern Ireland of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and of the British monarch and other members of the British royal family when they visit the region, as well as a guest house for prominent international visitors.

Historic Royal Palaces cites the 100 acres of picturesque gardens and castle State Rooms as attractions.

The remaining £13.9m allocated to costs of raising funds included £9.9m on retail activities.

== History ==

=== Management of the unoccupied Royal palaces in the 19th and 20th centuries ===
Management of the unoccupied Royal palaces in London was consolidated in the Office of Works over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Informal tours of Hampton Court Palace had been available since the Elizabethan era, and by the 18th century access to the Palace and tours of the Royal Collection were arranged for small groups by the housekeeper, and included in tourists&#x27; guide books. Hampton Court Palace was officially opened to the public in November 1838, and the Office of Works made responsible for opening the Palace from Sunday to Thursday (closing Friday for cleaning).

The War Office and its predecessor bodies had managed the Tower of London since the 15th century, using the White Tower as its headquarters and surrounding buildings for storage. Responsibility for the repair and restoration of the external elevations of &#x27;buildings of historical or national interest in the charge of the War Office&#x27; was transferred to the Office of Works in 1898, with the War Office retaining operational control of the active sites. The Tower, along with all its military buildings, staff and tourist income was fully transferred to the Office of Works in 1903.

Kew Palace and Queen Charlotte&#x27;s Cottage in Kew Gardens were transferred to the Office of Works in a deal brokered by its Permanent Secretary Lord Esher, whereby in exchange the dilapidated Kensington Palace would be renovated as a residence for Queen Victoria&#x27;s children, and its State Apartments opened to the public.

=== The formation of Historic Royal Palaces ===
In 1970 the Ministry of Public Building and Works was absorbed into the Department of the Environment, a super-ministry created by the newly-elected Heath government. The Ancient Monuments Department was amalgamated with the listed buildings section of the former Ministry of Housing in 1972 to create the Directorate of Ancient Monuments and Historic Buildings (DAMHB) as a specialised and autonomous body overseeing English heritage monuments and buildings.

The Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission (soon to be known as English Heritage) was created in 1984 by the Thatcher government to move the management of historic buildings from DAMHB outside of direct government control. The government did not think it appropriate however that the unoccupied royal palaces be included in the transfer (for fear of the appearance of privatisation), and the regulatory status of the palaces remain split across several bodies until a catastrophic fire at Hampton Court Palace in 1986 highlighted the deficiencies in the buildings&#x27; management.

After several changes in management and oversight, the unoccupied palaces were transferred out of the Department of the Environment to a dedicated executive agency called Historic Royal Palaces on 1 October 1989, to be run as a commercial businesses under a chief executive. In 1998 Historic Royal Palaces became an independent charity contracted by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to manage the London palaces on behalf of The King in Right of Crown, and in 2014 by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to manage Hillsborough Castle.

In 2023, the University of Manchester partnered with Historic Royal Palaces to carry out research on the British monarchy&#x27;s link to slavery with full access to the Royal Archives and the Royal Collection. The study is expected to be completed by 2026.

<doc id="1208636" wikidata="Q725894" url="?curid=1208636" title="Nigel Spackman">
<text>Nigel James Spackman (born 2 December 1960) is a former professional footballer and English football manager, and is a sports television pundit.

As a player he was as a midfielder from 1980 to 1998, notably for Liverpool, Chelsea and Rangers. He also played for AFC Bournemouth, Queens Park Rangers and Sheffield United. He initially started out with Non-league Andover. He took over as player-manager of Sheffield United in 1997, but lasted less than a year. 

He became a full time manager from 1997 and had brief spells in charge of Barnsley in 2001 and Millwall in 2006. He now works for the Glenn Hoddle Academy as well as working as a pundit and co-commentator.

==Playing career==
Born in Romsey, Hampshire, Spackman started at Andover and spent his first three years as a professional with AFC Bournemouth before joining Chelsea for £35,000 in the summer of 1983. He signed for Chelsea as part of manager John Neal&#x27;s re-building of the side alongside the likes of Kerry Dixon, Pat Nevin and David Speedie. Spackman scored on his debut for the club in a 5–0 opening day win over Derby County, though he was not a regular goalscorer. Chelsea were promoted at the end of that season as Second Division champions and finished 6th in the following two seasons back in the top tier, with Spackman a near ever-present. During the 1986–87 season, several key players, including Spackman, fell out with manager John Hollins and he was sporadically left out of the starting line-up or played out of position. He was sold to Liverpool in 1987 for £400,000.

Initially he was a frequently used substitute at Liverpool, and he was in the team which lost the 1987 League Cup final to Arsenal. Spackman only had a regular role in the Liverpool team during this season, but played an essential role.

When regular midfield general Ronnie Whelan was injured early in the campaign, Spackman was handed the No.5 shirt and he never missed a game for the whole campaign, gaining plaudits for his unselfish running and industry around the park in a team which featured the likes of John Barnes, Peter Beardsley and John Aldridge.

Liverpool lost just twice in the league all season, claiming the title with ease and Spackman was in the side which beat Nottingham Forest 5–0. Spackman&#x27;s stamina and unselfishness set up the last goal for Aldridge. Whelan was fit again with a month of the season left, but wasn&#x27;t selected. Spackman was selected for the rest of the campaign, including the FA Cup Final, which Liverpool surprisingly lost to Wimbledon. Spackman and teammate Gary Gillespie both played that game with bandages around their heads after the two had suffered cuts in a clash during a game against Derby County the previous week.

He left Liverpool for Queens Park Rangers in February 1989 but stayed there for less than a year, joining Scottish side Rangers in November 1989, winning honours there including three Scottish Premier Division titles, the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup. He went back to Chelsea in 1992 before moving to Sheffield United in 1996 as player-coach and assistant-manager to Howard Kendall.

==Managerial career==
When Kendall left the Blades in 1997 Spackman became caretaker manager before being appointed as manager on 5 August. United had a good start to the season but huge losses and high wages from the previous season&#x27;s promotion failure led to enforced sales of key personnel. The final straw being the sale of both of the club&#x27;s top scoring strikers (Brian Deane – 11 league goals – went to S.L. Benfica &amp; Jan Åge Fjørtoft – 9 league goals – to Barnsley) on the same day. Even though leaving midseason, Deane would go on to become the team&#x27;s top scorer that year, such was the lack of replacements. Spackman was unhappy over this and resigned in March 1998.

He later managed Barnsley between January and October 2001 but was sacked with the club near the bottom of the table. They were relegated at the end of that season. He re-entered management with Millwall in May 2006 but left only a few months later in September, with the club in the relegation zone of League One. As of 2022, he has failed to manage any club for a full season.

==Media career==
After Spackman left Barnsley, he began a new career in the media, becoming a pundit with Sky Sports before re-entering management with Millwall in 2006. Spackman currently appears as a regular pundit on Singapore&#x27;s Football Channel, alongside other former players such as John Burridge and Rob Lee. Spackman regularly appears on Setanta Sport Saturday afternoon as an expert pundit. Spackman currently appears as a pundit on Britain&#x27;s sports TV station &quot;Sports Tonight Live&quot;. He also works for Al Jazeera on La Liga Coverage as well as LFC TV.
Spackman has also featured for a number of seasons on LFCTV, the home TV channel for Liverpool FC, alongside former colleagues Gary Gillespie and Mark Wright. He recently provided pitch side commentary on Liverpool&#x27;s victory in the 2022 Community Shield over Manchester City.

==Personal life==
Spackman is of Scottish descent through a grandfather.
