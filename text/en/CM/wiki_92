<text>Whitton is an area of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, England. Historically, it was the north-western part of Twickenham manor, bounded by the River Crane and the Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s River.

Whitton High Street is one of the best-preserved 1930s high streets in London. The most common type of housing in the area is 1930s detached and semi-detached housing. Whitton lies on the A316 road, which leads to the M3 motorway, and Whitton railway station is on the line from London Waterloo to Windsor. As a mainly residential area in outer London, many residents commute to Central London.

==History==

Whitton was formally part of the ancient parish of Twickenham until 1862 when it became a separate parish, with the church of St Philip and St James opening that year. Due to rapid development, the parish was divided again in 1958; the two electoral wards that make up the area still broadly follow these two parish boundaries.

===Bronze Age===

In 1999, excavations on the former Feltham marshalling yard, located on the western border of Whitton, unearthed remains of an Iron Age furnace and post holes from a round house. There are various remains of former mills and other industrial archaeological features adjoining the River Crane; this part of the river is classified as an Archaeological Priority Area.

===Norman===

In Norman times, Whitton was the western rural part of Twickenham, which in turn was part of the Manor of Isleworth – itself part of the hundred of the same name in the ancient county of Middlesex. The manor had belonged to Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia in the time of Edward the Confessor, but was granted to Walter de Saint-Valery (Waleric) by William the Conqueror after 1066.

===Tudor===

Around 1540, gunpowder started to be produced on Hounslow Heath, which at the time covered a large part of Twickenham. The site, beside the River Crane, was to become known as the Hounslow Gunpowder Mills, and was chosen in part as it was away from built-up areas, lessening the impact of accidental explosions. The site remained active until 1927.

By the 16th century the area that was to become Whitton started to see large houses being developed, as the fashionable society in Twickenham started to spread outward. The Elizabethan and Jacobean courtier Sir John Suckling built a house in the vicinity of the present Murray Park (his son the poet Sir John Suckling was born in Whitton in 1609). Sir John later replaced his first house with a grander residence on land adjoining today&#x27;s Warren Road.

===Stuart===
Around 1640, Edmund Cooke built a large house close to the centre of the village. In 1709, this house was bought by the court painter Sir Godfrey Kneller, who had it demolished and replaced with a larger house reputedly designed by Sir Christopher Wren. This house was originally known as Whitton Hall, but was renamed Kneller Hall following Kneller&#x27;s death in 1723. It was considerably modified by later owners, before it was acquired by the state in 1847 for use as a teacher training college. Until 2021 it was home to the Royal Military School of Music.

At the centre of the original village, about 200 metres from Kneller Hall, is the White Hart, an inn dating back to at least the mid-17th century and possibly much earlier. Records relating to this inn seem to suggest that Whitton had an importance that was not well recorded, or that travellers passed through it in considerable numbers. A document of 1685 shows that it provided three beds and stabling for ten horses, numbers which did not seem to fit with Whitton&#x27;s apparent status as a sleepy rural hamlet with only a few dozen inhabitants.

===Georgian===

At the northern end of Whitton was Whitton Park, the estate of Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll. The Duke established the estate in 1722 on land that had been enclosed some years earlier from Hounslow Heath. An enthusiastic gardener, the Duke imported large numbers of exotic species of plants and trees for his estate; he received professional advice from the Scottish gardener James Lee (1715–1795). After the Duke&#x27;s death in 1761, his nephew John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, moved many of these plants and trees, including mature trees, to the Princess of Wales&#x27; new garden at Kew, which later became Kew Gardens. Some of the Duke&#x27;s trees can still be seen at Kew Gardens to this day.

===Victorian===

Whitton was renowned as a market garden, known for its roses, narcissi, lilies of the valley and for its apple, plum and pear orchards. Indeed, until the 1920s the village was still separated from the surrounding towns by open fields and much of the earlier character of the old village was retained well into the 1940s.

Following the coming of the railways in the mid-19th century, there was some housing development along Nelson, Kneller and Hounslow Roads. Whitton was initially served by what is now Hounslow railway station, which opened on 1 February 1850.

===Early 20th century===
Whitton developed rapidly following the opening of Whitton railway station, on Percy Road, in 1930. Houses replaced the market gardens and the former Whitton Park estate, while new parades of shops were built on either side of Percy Road from the new railway station to the junction with Nelson and Hounslow Roads, this stretch then being renamed High Street Whitton.

At around the same time, the A316 Chertsey Road was built through the south of the area. Today, this road leads to the M3 motorway, with links to Southampton and the South West of England.

===World War II===

A number of houses were damaged by enemy bombing in the early years of the Second World War. Before 1944, 86 Hounslow Road received a direct hit from a German bomb and was badly damaged, though not destroyed. In June 1944, 81 High Street received a direct hit from a V-1 flying bomb. Part of the parade of shops and the flats above were totally destroyed and several people were killed. Around the same time, a house on Lincoln Avenue was also destroyed by a V-1 and several adjoining houses were severely damaged.

A common sight during the Blitz was of RAF fighters scrambling from nearby airfields almost at rooftop height, low enough for the pilots to be seen in their cockpits.

==Economy==
Most people travel outside of the town for their work as very little land is in employment use. Many people travel into Central London making use of the good transport connections, or work in nearby district centres such as Twickenham and Richmond or the bigger metropolitan centres such as Hounslow and Kingston upon Thames. London Heathrow Airport is important to the local economy both through direct employment and the cluster of international firms that have their European headquarters in the Thames Valley area.

The town centre is the third largest in the Richmond upon Thames. In 2014, it received a £2 million programme of economic regeneration including new street lighting, yorkstone pavements and a £5 million redevelopment of the railway station was completed in December 2016.

==Leisure activities==

Being in a borough a third of which is green and open space – five times more than any other borough in London – Whitton has much to offer in the way of leisure activities.

===Parks and open spaces===

The town has one long linear park along the River Crane, London and five smaller neighbourhood parks that have sport facilities and children&#x27;s playgrounds along with three cemeteries. Close to the town are the large Bushy Park and Richmond Park that are managed by The Royal Parks and serve as the larger district parks for the area. Hounslow Heath, a large open space and local conservation area is heavily used by the town&#x27;s residents.

* Borough Cemetery along Powder Mill Lane and operated by London Borough of Hounslow. 
* Heathfield Recreation Ground (&quot;the Rec&quot;) was opened in the 1930s and is laid out to accommodate sport pitches and a pavilion. In 2022 a 1.8ha extension was added, designated as a nature zone and named Jubilee Meadows in recognition of the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

===Cycling===

Richmond is part of the London Cycle Network, offering on and off-road cycle paths throughout the area.

===Leisure centres===

The local authority operated Whitton Sports and Fitness Centre, based at the Twickenham School site, has a modern gym, sports hall and astroturf pitches. There are also three large commercial health clubs just over the town&#x27;s boundary at The Stoop, Twickenham Golf Course and Twickenham Stadium.

===Sport clubs===

There are a number of sports clubs in Whitton including the Whitton Lions rugby club and Hounslow and Whitton Cricket Club 
both located at the Whitton Park Sports Association, and the Whitton Tennis Club based next to Kneller Hall.

===Cinema===

The Odeon cinema in the high street closed in December 1961; since then, residents have had to travel to nearby towns such to visit a cinema. The local council has built a new arts centre in Twickenham which has a 300-seat auditorium for dual theatre and cinema use. This was due to open in 2017, opposite Twickenham station, but has not yet been formally named.

===Youth centre===

In September 2013, Richmond Council opened a youth centre located behind Whitton High Street in Britannia Lane.

===Heritage===

With the Royal Court often staying in Richmond and Hampton Court in the eighteenth century, Twickenham was a very fashionable place to live and this has left the area with a unique cultural heritage. Many residents remember childhood outings to a number of important historical houses on the doorstep of Whitton including Ham House, Hampton Court Palace, Marble Hill House, Sion House and Strawberry Hill House. The only remaining country house left in Whitton is Kneller Hall, which was home to the Royal Military School of Music.

There is on only one Conservation Area in the locality: Rosecroft Gardens. In addition, there are a number of listed buildings such as Kneller Hall, the Shot Tower at Crane Park along with a number of locally listed buildings.

==Education==

===Primary schools===
There are five primary schools in Whitton. Two of them are voluntary-aided faith schools – Bishop Perrin Church of England Primary (opened in 1936) and St. Edmund&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary (opened in 1938). The other three have no faith designation – Chase Bridge Primary School, Heathfield Schools Partnership and Nelson School.

Chase Bridge Primary and Heathfield Schools Partnership are maintained by the local authority, with Heathfield being a federation of nursery, infants (opened 1931) and Junior schools on one site. Nelson Primary (opened 1911) is now an academy run by the Latchmere Academy Trust.

===Secondary schools===
Whitton has two secondary schools, Twickenham School in Percy Road, and Turing House School in Hospital Bridge Road. An independent school, Radnor House, is planning to relocate its senior students to Whitton&#x27;s Kneller Hall, subject to planning permission.

Many local children go to other Richmond Borough secondary schools, or to secondary schools in neighbouring boroughs. Significant numbers go to The Heathland&#x27;s School in nearby Hounslow or to the Richmond upon Thames School (RTS) just over the A316 in Twickenham.

==Churches==

In 1862 Whitton separated from St Mary&#x27;s, Twickenham to become the parish of St Philip and St. James Whitton. In anticipation of this change Church of St Philip and St James (C of E) was built. In 1935, due to population growth, St Augustine of Canterbury, Whitton, was created as a London Diocesan Home Mission church in 1935, within the parish of St Philip and St Paul, and met in the main hall of Bishop Perrin School, Hospital Bridge Road. Later in 1958 it became the parish of &#x27;St. Augustine Whitton&#x27; to coincide with the opening of new St Augustine&#x27;s, Whitton that was opened further up Hospital Bridge Road.

Whitton Methodist Church, in Percy Road, now shares its building with Calvary Chapel Twickenham, which is a Baptist church.

A non-conformist Gospel Hall was built in 1881 on the western side of Nelson Road a few metres to the north of the junction with Warren Road. This became redundant with the opening of Whitton Baptist Church in Hounslow Road in 1935 and was later used by various commercial enterprises. The building of Whitton Baptist Church was funded by the compensation paid for the compulsory purchase of St Margaret&#x27;s Baptist Church, which was demolished during the construction of the Great Chertsey Road approach to the new Twickenham Bridge across the Thames in 1932. Another Baptist church, The Free Grace Baptist Church, was formed in 1964 and meets in a former Salvation Army Hall in Powder Mill Lane.

The Catholic Church of St Edmund of Canterbury is in Nelson Road and was opened in 1934 by the Edmundite Fathers (Society of Saint Edmund). In 1988 the Edmundite Fathers left Whitton, since when the parish has been in the care of secular clergy.

==Demography and housing==


==Transport==
===Roads===
Whitton has good road links and is less than 10 miles from the M25. Journeys to Kingston upon Thames take twenty minutes, journeys to Hounslow take 5 minutes or 10 minutes by foot, whilst a journey to Richmond is ten minutes.

The A316 becomes the M3 at Sunbury-on-Thames and connects with the M25 at junction 2. Going the other direction the A316 passes by Twickenham town centre and then Richmond, Kew, Mortlake, and finally Chiswick where it joins The Great West Road A4.

===Tube/trains===
The principal rail service from Whitton railway station is the Windsor Line into London Waterloo, taking 30 minutes on the ‘semi-fast’ service operated by South Western Railway. There is also a ‘stopping’ service that calls at all stations and takes 40 minutes via Richmond, or 50 minutes via Brentford. Residents living in the north of the town use the closer Hounslow on the Hounslow Loop Line and Waterloo-Reading mainline.

As London Underground does not serve the Twickenham area, connections are often made at Richmond for the District line, or at Hounslow East for the Piccadilly line. Plans to increase the frequency of the &#x27;semi-fast&#x27; service to four trains per hour were first discussed in the Wessex Route Study consultation held in 2014 and are expected to be included in the new South Western franchise. However, Richmond Council has requested these go via the Hounslow Loop and not Richmond due to concerns about the amount of time the level crossing would need to be down in Barnes.

===Buses===
Whitton is served by London Buses routes 110, 111, 281, 481, H20 and H22.

==Geography==

Whitton is located between the two district centres of Hounslow to the north, and Twickenham town centre to the east and is for the most part suburban housing. The land is between 60 and 70 feet above sea level and is noticeable flat and fertile and was once home to extensive market gardens until the turn of the twentieth century. The soil is mainly Taplow gravel with some patches of brick clay.

The borough&#x27;s main arterial road, the A316, running between Chiswick and the M3 motorway was built in the 1930s. Over time areas south of the A316 have been transferred to Twickenham apart from the Rosecroft Estate (which can only be accessed via the A316 thus cutting off Whitton from the rest of Twickenham and helping to develop the separate community identity in Whitton.

Whitton residents have a Twickenham (TW2), Whitton, Hounslow (TW3 &amp; TW4) or Isleworth (TW7) post town and postcode. Residents who live in Whitton but on the border of Whitton and Hounslow have a Whitton, Hounslow (TW3 &amp; TW4) post town and postcode. Prior to 2015, these residents who were on the border only had a post town of Hounslow despite living in Whitton. However, Vince Cable, the Twickenham MP when to Parliament and requested Royal Mail to create Whitton as a post town. In 2015, Royal Mail created Whitton as a unique postal district where now residents of Whitton who live on the border of Whitton and Hounslow can put Whitton in their address.

==Nearest places==

Whitton is bordered by a number of other residential districts, with other areas of Twickenham and the centre itself nearby. Large nearby towns including Richmond, Hounslow and Kingston upon Thames are also close and have an even greater pull, especially Richmond, due to their shopping facilities and employment opportunities.

<doc id="1224314" wikidata="Q747404" url="?curid=1224314" title="Limescale">
<text>Limescale is a hard, chalky deposit, consisting mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). It often builds up inside kettles, boilers, and pipework, especially that for hot water. It is also often found as a similar deposit on the inner surfaces of old pipes and other surfaces where hard water has flowed. Limescale also forms as travertine or tufa in hard water springs.

The colour varies from off-white through a range of greys and pink or reddish browns, depending on the other minerals present. Iron compounds give the reddish-browns. 

In addition to being unsightly and hard to clean, limescale can seriously damage or impair the operation of various plumbing and heating components. Descaling agents are commonly used to remove limescale. Prevention of fouling by scale build-up relies on the technologies of water softening or other water treatment.
== Chemical composition ==
The type found deposited on the heating elements of water heaters consists mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Hard water contains calcium (and often magnesium) bicarbonate or similar ions. Calcium, magnesium, and carbonate ions dissolve from rocks through which rainwater percolates before collection. Calcium salts, such as calcium carbonate and calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO3)2), are more soluble in hot water than cold water; thus, heating water alone does not cause calcium carbonate to precipitate. However, there is an equilibrium between dissolved calcium bicarbonate and dissolved calcium carbonate as represented by the chemical equation

Note that CO2 is dissolved in the water. Carbon dioxide dissolved in water (aq) tends to equilibrate with carbon dioxide in the gaseous state (g):

The equilibrium of CO2 moves to the right, toward gaseous CO2, when water temperature rises or pressure falls. When water that contains dissolved calcium carbonate is warmed, CO2 leaves the water as gas, this reduces the amount involved in the reaction causing the equilibrium of bicarbonate and carbonate to re-balance to the right, increasing the concentration of dissolved carbonate. As the concentration of carbonate increases, calcium carbonate precipitates as the salt: 

In pipes as limescale and in surface deposits of calcite as travertine or tufa the primary driver of calcite formation is the exsolution of gas. When heating hard water on the stove, these gas bubbles form on the surface of the pan prior to boiling. Gas exsolution can also occur when the confining pressure is released such as removing the top off a beer bottle or where subsurface water is flowed into an atmospheric pressure tank.

As new cold water with dissolved calcium carbonate/bicarbonate is added and heated, the process continues: CO2 gas is again removed, carbonate concentration increases, and more calcium carbonate precipitates.

Scale is often colored because of the presence of iron-containing compounds. The three main iron compounds are wüstite (FeO), hematite (), and magnetite ().

==As a stone==
The Roman Eifel Aqueduct was completed around 80 AD and broken and largely destroyed by Germanic tribes in 260. By the Middle Ages the limestone-like limescale accretions from the inside of the aqueduct were particularly desirable as a building material, called &quot;Eifel marble&quot; in an area with little natural stone. In the course of operation of the aqueduct, many sections had a layer as thick as . The material had a consistency similar to brown marble and was easily removable from the aqueduct. Upon polishing, it showed veins, and it could also be used like a stone board when cut flat. This artificial stone found use throughout the Rhineland and was very popular for columns, window frames, and even altars. Use of &quot;Eifel marble&quot; can be seen as far east as Paderborn and Hildesheim, where it was used in the cathedrals. Roskilde Cathedral in Denmark is the northernmost location of its use, where several gravestones are made of it.

Trade to the west took it to England as a high-status export material in the 11th and 12th centuries, where it was made into columns for a number of Norman English Cathedrals. The impressive polished brown stone was known for many years as &#x27;Onyx Marble&#x27;. Its origin and nature was a mystery to people studying the stonework at Canterbury Cathedral, until its source was identified in 2011. It is used there as columns supporting the cloister roof, alternating with columns of Purbeck Marble. These large cathedral cloisters needed several hundred such columns around an open quadrangle, which must have been supplied by a well-organized extraction and transport operation. The Eifel deposits, now called Calcareous sinter or calc-sinter (since it is neither onyx nor marble), have also been identified at Rochester and in the now lost Romanesque cloister at Norwich as well as the Infirmary Cloisters, Chapter House windows, and Treasury doorway at Canterbury.

Soap scum forms when calcium cations from hard water combine with soap, which would dissolve in soft water. This precipitates out in a thin film on the interior surfaces of baths, sinks, and drainage pipes.

<text>Thomas Allen McPherson (March 26, 1935 – December 15, 2020) was an American politician from Florida, serving both as a mayor and in both state government houses.

==Biography==
McPherson was the first elected mayor of Cooper City, Florida, with prior mayors being appointed by property developers. He was born in Decatur, Illinois. He later served in both houses of government in Florida for over 16 years.

During his time in the legislature, McPherson championed environmental issues, including raising over $100 million via bonds to protect environmentally sensitive areas. He also served as the House Community Affairs Committee chairman.

McPherson lost his state Senate seat in 1990 after losing in the primary to Ken Jenne. McPherson lost the seat a year after admitting his drinking problem on the floor of the state Senate.

McPherson died in Tallahassee, Florida on December 15, 2020, at the age of 85.

<doc id="1224330" wikidata="Q162478" url="?curid=1224330" title="Köchel catalogue">
<text>The Köchel catalogue () is a catalogue of compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, originally created by Ludwig Ritter von Köchel, in which the entries are abbreviated &quot;K.&quot; or &quot;KV&quot;. Its numbers reflect the ongoing task of compiling the chronology of Mozart&#x27;s works, and provide a shorthand reference to the compositions. For example, according to Köchel&#x27;s counting, Requiem in D minor is the 626th piece Mozart composed, thus is designated &quot;K. 626&quot;. 

Köchel&#x27;s original catalogue (1862) has been revised several times. Catalogue numbers from these revised editions are indicated either by parentheses or by superscript: K. 49 (47d) or K. 47d refers to the work numbered 47d in the sixth edition. The catalog was originally chronological, though revisions made chronological ordering of Mozart&#x27;s works difficult and as of 2024 a new organizational system is used for the ninth version. 

==History==
In the decades after Mozart&#x27;s death in 1791 there were several attempts to catalogue his compositions, for example by Franz Gleißner and Johann Anton André (published in 1833), but it was not until 1862 that Ludwig von Köchel succeeded in producing a comprehensive listing. Köchel&#x27;s 551-page catalogue was titled (&quot;Chronological-thematic Catalogue of the Complete Musical Works of W. A. Mozart&quot;). Köchel attempted to arrange the works in chronological order, but many compositions written before 1784 could only be estimated, although Leopold Mozart had compiled a partial list of his son&#x27;s earlier works; Mozart&#x27;s catalogue of his own compositions (begun in February 1784 with K. 449) allows relatively precise dating of many of his later works. The catalogue included the opening bars of each piece, known as an incipit. Köchel divided the corpus into a main chronology of 626 works, and five appendices ( in German), abbreviated Anh. I–V which comprise:
*I – Lost authentic works
*II – Fragments by Mozart
*III – Works by Mozart transcribed by others
*IV – Doubtful works
*V – Misattributed works

Since Köchel published his original catalogue in 1863 (now referred to as K), the dating of Mozart&#x27;s compositions has been subject to constant revision. Many more pieces have since been found, re-dated, re-attributed and re-numbered, requiring three revised editions of the catalogue. Subsequent editions – especially the third edition (K) by Alfred Einstein (1937), and the sixth edition (K) by Franz Giegling, , and (1964) – have reflected attempts to arrange the growing list of works in a more accurate chronological order, according to various levels of scholarship. Because of the confusing renumbering between versions, the ninth edition (K) by Neal Zaslaw (2024) abandoned the chronological order: all works that were included in a previous edition return to the oldest number they were given, and works newly included in the ninth edition were given numbers past 626, all the way to 721.

A major shortcoming of K was that there was no room to expand the strictly sequential numbering in the main catalogue to allow for any new discoveries or further reassessment of existing works. For the 1937 edition (K) Einstein (following the analyses of Théodore de Wyzewa and Georges de St. Foix) reassigned some works from the original K appendices into the main catalogue by interpolating numbers with a lower-case letter suffix. In K some of these were, per intervening scholarship, returned to re-structured appendices:
* K. 626a
** K. 626a I – 64 Cadenzas by Mozart to his own keyboard concertos
** K. 626a II – Cadenzas by Mozart to keyboard concertos by other composers
* K. 626b – 42 sketches &amp; other fragments by Mozart (replacing K Anh. II)
* Anh. A – Copies by Mozart of other composers&#x27; works
* Anh. B – Works by Mozart transcribed by others
* Anh. C – Doubtful and misattributed vocal (C 1–10) and instrumental (C 11-30) works

For example, &quot;Divertimento for Wind Octet in E&quot; was numbered K. Anh. 226 in K; Einstein placed it in the K main catalogue as K. 196e, between K. 196 and K. 197; K reassigned it again to the &#x27;doubtful&#x27; appendix C as K. Anh. C 17.01; and K reverts to Einstein&#x27;s assignment as K. 196e (though it is still considered a doubtful work). Some works in Anh. A have been identified since 1965 as by Leopold Mozart. Many works in Anh. C have since been more reliably assigned to other composers, or to Mozart himself.

==List of existing Mozart compositions==
To maintain as much of the original K-numbering of the list as possible, while re-ordering in the revised, chronological sequence, letters were added to the new numbers. The following list shows the latest edition (K), Köchel&#x27;s original designation (K), and the sixth edition (K). Other addenda and supplements to the catalogue are marked &quot;.&quot; (This has been abbreviated to &#x27;Anh.&#x27; in the list below.)

==Recordings==
Recordings of the complete works of Mozart have been issued three times: on the occasion of the bicentenary of Mozart&#x27;s death in 1991, Philips Classics Records released a 180-CD collection in 45 box sets and each CD in a jewel case, &quot;The Complete Mozart Edition&quot;, between 1990 and 1991. A selection of 25 CDs from this set, &quot;The Best of the Complete Mozart Edition&quot;, was published in 1995. The full selection was then released again in 17 box sets as &quot;The Compact Complete Mozart Edition&quot; in 2000. The Philips collection was made with recordings from world-renowned artists and is of high audio quality. On the occasion of Mozart&#x27;s 250th birthday in 2006, Brilliant Classics released a single box with 170 CDs, plus one with liner notes to all works and the libretti to vocal works, &quot;Mozart Complete Edition&quot;. In 2016, for the 225th anniversary of Mozart&#x27;s death, Decca Classics and Deutsche Grammophon in partnership with the International Mozarteum Foundation released a box of 200 CDs with 2 hardback books with a new Mozart biography by Cliff Eisen and a newly developed short Köchel guide. &quot;Mozart 225: The New Complete Edition&quot; contains premiere performances of previously lost compositions and never recorded fragments, as well as key works in alternative versions and recordings of legendary historic performances.

<text>Rolleston on Dove, also known simply as Rolleston, is a village and civil parish in the East Staffordshire district, in the county of Staffordshire, England near Burton upon Trent. On 28 March 1983 the parish was renamed from &quot;Rolleston&quot; to &quot;Rolleston on Dove&quot;. According to the University of Nottingham English Place-names project, the settlement name Rolleston could mean &#x27;Hrothwulf&#x27;s farm/settlement&#x27; or &#x27;Hrolfr&#x27;s farm/settlement&#x27;. The 2011 census for Rolleston returned 1,467 households and 3,267 residents.

==History==
Mentioned in the Domesday Book Survey of 1086, Rolleston was a settlement in the Hundred of Offlow, Staffordshire. It had recorded population of 36 households, including a priest. Rolleston was originally built around the hall, the church and the stream running through it, the Alder brook. The oldest area of the village, thought to date from the 11th century, is near the Spread Eagle Inn and Rolleston&#x27;s Church, St. Mary&#x27;s, together with Brookside and Burnside, although there are old houses in other parts in the village.

==Rolleston Hall==
Sir Oswald Mosley, the founder of the British Union of Fascists spent some of his earlier years at the family seat here. Rolleston Hall, where Mosley lived, was sold by auction on 2 August 1923 for housing development. The lake and two of the entrance lodges remain. The family coat of arms are still displayed in what was originally the Victorian Commemoration Hall which is now Rolleston Club.

==Transport==
Rolleston on Dove was served by a railway station which was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway on 1 November 1894. The station closed in 1949. Rolleston is also home to the Jinnie Trail, a former railway line in a man-made valley which was closed completely in 1968. In 1972 it was created into a rural walk stretching approximately 2 kilometres. Along the walk today, parts of the remaining stations are being revealed by an ongoing restoration project.

==Sport and Leisure==
===Cricket===
Rolleston Cricket Club is an English amateur cricket club with a history of cricket in the village dating back to 1871. The club ground is located on The Willows, Dovecliff Road. Rolleston field 4 Senior XI teams in the Derbyshire County Cricket League and an established Junior training section that play competitive cricket in the Burton &amp; District Youth Cricket League.

===RoDSEC===
The Rolleston on Dove Special Events Committee (RoDSEC) organises many seasonal activities, including money raising events for local charities.

===Football===
Rolleston Football Club was a junior league club that used the Craythorne Road Football pitches for their home ground.

<doc id="1224336" wikidata="Q465832" url="?curid=1224336" title="Biograph Company">
<text>The Biograph Company, also known as the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company, was a motion picture company founded in 1895 and active until 1916. It was the first company in the United States devoted entirely to film production and exhibition, and for two decades was one of the most prolific, releasing over 3000 short films and 12 feature films. During the height of silent film as a medium, Biograph was the most prominent U.S. film studio and one of the most respected and influential studios worldwide, only rivaled by Germany&#x27;s UFA, Sweden&#x27;s Svensk Filmindustri and France&#x27;s Pathé. The company was home to pioneering director D. W. Griffith and such actors as Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish, and Lionel Barrymore.

== Founding ==
The company was started by William Kennedy Dickson, an inventor at Thomas Edison&#x27;s laboratory who helped pioneer the technology of capturing moving images on film. Dickson left Edison in April 1895, joining with inventors Herman Casler, Harry Marvin and businessman Elias Koopman to incorporate the American Mutoscope Company in New Jersey on December 30, 1895. The firm manufactured the Mutoscope and made flip-card movies for it as a rival to Edison&#x27;s Kinetoscope for individual &quot;peep shows&quot;, making the company Edison&#x27;s chief competitor in the nickelodeon market. In the summer of 1896 the Biograph projector was released, offering superior image quality to Edison&#x27;s Vitascope projector. The company soon became a leader in the film industry, with distribution and production subsidiaries around the world, including the British Mutoscope Co. In 1899 it changed its name to the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company, and in 1908 to simply the Biograph Company.
To avoid violating Edison&#x27;s motion picture patents, Biograph cameras from 1895 to 1902 used a large-format film, measuring wide, with an image area of , four times that of Edison&#x27;s 35 mm format. The camera used friction feed instead of Edison&#x27;s sprocket feed to guide the film to the aperture. The camera itself punched a sprocket hole on each side of the frame as the film was exposed at 30 frames per second.
A patent case victory in March 1902 allowed Biograph and other producers and distributors to use the less expensive 35 mm format without an Edison license, although Biograph did not completely phase out 68 mm production until autumn of 1903.
Biograph offered prints in both formats to exhibitors until 1905, when it discontinued the larger format. Commenting on the 1902 Biograph Company short film &quot;The Flying Train&quot;, Ashley Swinnerton of the Museum of Modern Art said that the 68 mm format has become &quot;of particular interest to researchers ... because the large image area affords stunning visual clarity and quality.&quot;

Biograph films before 1903, were mostly &quot;actualities,&quot; documentary film footage of actual persons, places and events, each film usually less than two minutes long, such as the one of the Empire State Express, which premiered on October 12, 1896, in New York City. The occasional narrative film, usually a comedy, was typically shot in one scene, with no editing. Spurred on by competition from Edison and British and European producers, Biograph production from 1903 onward was increasingly dominated by narratives. As the stories became more complex the films became longer, with multiple scenes to tell the story, although an individual scene was still usually presented in one shot without editing. Biograph&#x27;s production of actualities ended by 1908 in favor of the narrative film.

== Studio ==

The company&#x27;s first studio was located on the roof of 841 Broadway at 13th St. in Manhattan, known then as the Hackett Carhart Building and today as the Roosevelt Building. The set-up was similar to Thomas Edison&#x27;s &quot;Black Maria&quot; in West Orange, New Jersey, with the studio itself being mounted on circular tracks to be able to get the best possible sunlight (as of 1988 the foundations of this machinery were still extant). The company moved in 1906 to a converted brownstone mansion at 11 East 14th Street near Union Square, a building that was razed in the 1960s. This was Biograph&#x27;s first indoor studio, and the first movie studio in the world to rely exclusively on artificial light. Biograph moved again in 1913, as it entered feature-film production, to a new state-of-the-art studio on 175th Street in the Bronx. Among the first projects filmed there was &quot;Chocolate Dynamite&quot;, which was shot in late August 1913 and was a split-reel comedy short, not a feature-film release.

There was the problem of the underground &quot;duping&quot; business, where people would illegally duplicate a copyrighted movie and then remove the title screen with the company and copyright notice and sell it to theaters. In order to make the theater audience aware that they were watching an American Biograph movie (regardless of whether it was illegally &quot;duped&quot; or not) the AB logo would be prominently placed in random parts of the movie.

== Rise of D. W. Griffith ==

Director D. W. Griffith joined Biograph in 1908 as a writer and actor, but within months became its principal director. In 1908, the company&#x27;s head director Wallace McCutcheon grew ill, and his son Wallace McCutcheon Jr. took his place but was not able to make a successful film for the company. As a result of these failed productions, studio head Harry Marvin gave the position of head director to Griffith, whose first film was &quot;The Adventures of Dollie&quot;. Griffith helped establish many of the conventions of narrative film, including cross-cutting to show events occurring simultaneously in different places, the flashback, the fade-in/fade-out, the interposition of closeups within a scene, and a moderated acting style more suitable for film. Although Griffith did not invent these techniques, he made them a regular part of the film vocabulary. His prolific output—often one new film a week—and willingness to experiment in many different genres helped the company become a major commercial success. Many early movie stars were Biograph performers, including Mary Pickford, Lionel Barrymore, Lillian Gish, Dorothy Gish, Robert Harron, Arthur V. Johnson, Florence Auer, Robert G. Vignola, Owen Moore, Alan Hale Sr., Florence Lawrence, Blanche Sweet, Harry Carey, James Kirkwood Sr., Mabel Normand, Henry B. Walthall, Mae Marsh, and Dorothy Davenport. Mack Sennett honed his craft as an actor and director of comedies at Biograph. After debuting at Biograph, Mary Pickford also became a top star at the studio and would soon be known to audiences as &quot;The Biograph Girl&quot;.

In January 1910, Griffith and Lee Dougherty with the rest of the Biograph acting company travelled to Los Angeles. While the purpose of the trip was to shoot &quot;Ramona&quot; in authentic locations, it was also to determine the suitability of the West Coast as a place for a permanent studio. The group set up a small facility at Washington Street and Grand Avenue. After this, Griffith and his players decided to go a little further north to a small village they had heard about that was friendly and had beautiful floral scenery. They decided to travel there and fell in love with this little place called Hollywood. Biograph then made the first film ever in Hollywood called &quot;In Old California&quot;, a Latino melodrama about the early days of Mexico-owned California. Griffith and the Biograph troupe filmed other short movies at various locations, then traveled back to New York. After the East Coast film community heard about Hollywood, other companies began to migrate there. Biograph&#x27;s little film launched Hollywood as the future movie capital of the world. It opened a studio at Pico and Georgia streets in downtown Los Angeles (where the Los Angeles Convention Center now stands) in 1911, and sent a film crew to work there each year until 1916.

Griffith left Biograph in October 1913 after finishing &quot;Judith of Bethulia&quot;, unhappy with the company&#x27;s resistance to larger budgets, feature film production or giving onscreen credit to him and the cast. With him went many of the Biograph actors, his cameraman Billy Bitzer and his production crew. As a final slight to Griffith, Biograph delayed release of &quot;Judith of Bethulia&quot; until March 1914, to avoid a profit-sharing arrangement the company had with him.

== Decline ==
In December 1908 Biograph joined Edison in forming the Motion Picture Patents Company in an attempt to control the industry and shut out smaller producers. The &quot;Edison Trust,&quot; as it was nicknamed, was made up of Edison, Biograph, Essanay Studios, Kalem Company, George Kleine Productions, Lubin Studios, Georges Méliès, Pathé, Selig Studios and Vitagraph Studios, and dominated distribution through the General Film Co. The Motion Picture Patents Co. and the General Film Co. were found guilty of antitrust violation in October 1915 and dissolved.

Shielded by the Trust, Biograph had been slow to enter feature film production. It contracted with the theatrical firm of Klaw &amp; Erlanger in 1913 to produce movie versions of the latter&#x27;s plays. Its first released feature, &quot;Classmates&quot;, came out in February 1914, after 69 other American features had been released in 1912–13. Distribution was hampered by Biograph using a special perforation pattern on the Klaw &amp; Erlanger features that was incompatible with standard projectors, forcing exhibitors to lease specialized equipment from Biograph in order to show the films. With the exodus of the studio&#x27;s best actors to Griffith, Biograph was unable to develop a marketable star system as the independent companies were doing, and after the Trust&#x27;s fall, Biograph found itself behind the times. The Biograph Co. released its last new feature-length films in 1915 and its last new short films in 1916. Biograph spent the remainder of the silent era reissuing its old films, and leasing its Bronx studio to other producers.

When the company fell on financial hard times, the Biograph Studio facilities and film laboratory in the Bronx were acquired by one of Biograph Company&#x27;s creditors, the Empire Trust Company, although some of the ex-Biograph staff were retained to manage the studio and laboratory facilities. Herbert Yates acquired the Biograph Studios facilities and film laboratory in 1928. Biograph Studios facilities and film laboratory were made a subsidiary of his Consolidated Film Industries in 1928. The studio facilities and laboratory burned down in 1980.

In 1939, Iris Barry, founder of the film department at the Museum of Modern Art, acquired 900 cans of film from the Actinograph Corp. Bronx Biograph studio and laboratory facitlies, which was closing its film vault and planning to destroy all the film. One uncompleted film, &quot;Lime Kiln Field Day&quot; (1913), with an all African American cast, was found among the many cans of film, and shown at MOMA in November 2014.

From 1954 to 1957, Sterling Television Company distributed a package of 100 quarter-hour television shows titled &quot;Movie Museum&quot;, featuring Biograph, Edison and other early films from the vaults of the Museum of Modern Art and the George Eastman House.

<doc id="1224339" wikidata="Q407520" url="?curid=1224339" title="Sodium fluoride">
<text>Sodium fluoride (NaF) is an inorganic compound with the formula . It is a colorless or white solid that is readily soluble in water. It is used in trace amounts in the fluoridation of drinking water to prevent tooth decay, and in toothpastes and topical pharmaceuticals for the same purpose. In 2022, it was the 221st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions. It is also used in metallurgy and in medical imaging.

== Uses ==
=== Dental caries ===

Fluoride salts are often added to municipal drinking water (as well as to certain food products in some countries) for the purpose of maintaining dental health. The fluoride enhances the strength of teeth by the formation of fluorapatite, a naturally occurring component of tooth enamel. Although sodium fluoride is used to fluoridate water and is the standard by which other water-fluoridation compounds are gauged, hexafluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6) and its salt sodium hexafluorosilicate (Na2SiF6) are more commonly used additives in the United States.

=== Osteoporosis ===
Fluoride supplementation has been extensively studied for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. This supplementation does not appear to be effective; even though sodium fluoride increases bone density, it does not decrease the risk of fractures.

=== Medical imaging ===
In medical imaging, fluorine-18-labelled sodium fluoride (USP, sodium fluoride Na18F) is one of the oldest tracers used in positron emission tomography (PET), having been in use since the 1960s. Relative to conventional bone scintigraphy carried out with gamma cameras or SPECT systems, PET offers more sensitivity and spatial resolution. Fluorine-18 has a half-life of 110 min, which requires it to be used promptly once produced; this logistical limitation hampered its adoption in the face of the more convenient technetium-99m-labelled radiopharmaceuticals. However, fluorine-18 is generally considered to be a superior radiopharmaceutical for skeletal imaging. In particular it has a high and rapid bone uptake accompanied by very rapid blood clearance, which results in a high bone-to-background ratio in a short time. Additionally the annihilation photons produced by decay of 18F have a high energy of 511 keV compared to the 140 keV photons of 99mTc.

=== Chemistry ===
Sodium fluoride has a variety of specialty chemical applications in synthesis and extractive metallurgy. It reacts with electrophilic chlorides including acyl chlorides, sulfur chlorides, and phosphorus chloride. Like other fluorides, sodium fluoride finds use in desilylation in organic synthesis. Sodium fluoride can be used to produce fluorocarbons via the Finkelstein reaction; this process has the advantage of being simple to perform on a small scale but is rarely used on an industrial scale due to the existence of more effective techniques (e.g. Electrofluorination, Fowler process).

=== Biology ===
Sodium fluoride is sometimes added at relatively high concentrations (~20 mM) to protein lysis buffers in order to inhibit endogenous phosphatases and thereby protect phosphorylated protein sites. Sodium pyrophosphate and Sodium orthovanadate are also used for this purpose.

=== Insecticide ===
Inorganic fluorides such as fluorosilicates and sodium fluoride complex magnesium ions as magnesium fluorophosphate. They inhibit enzymes such as enolase that require Mg2+ as a prosthetic group. Thus, fluoride poisoning prevents phosphate transfer in oxidative metabolism. Sodium fluoride, patented as an insecticide in 1896, was commonly used through the 1970s on ants and other domestic pests, and as a stomach poison for plant-feeding insects. 

Its use, along with that of sodium fluorosilicate, declined over the 20th century as the products were banned or restricted due to the possibility of poisoning, intentional or accidental. In 1942, for instance, 47 inmates at the Oregon State Hospital died after consuming scrambled eggs which had been inadvertently prepared with sodium fluoride; while assisting the cooks, another inmate had confused a container of insecticide—used by the hospital to control cockroaches—with powdered milk, which was stored nearby.

=== Other uses ===
Sodium fluoride is used as a cleaning agent (e.g., as a &quot;laundry sour&quot;).

Sodium fluoride can be used in a nuclear molten salt reactor.

== Safety ==

The lethal dose for a 70 kg (154 lb) human is estimated at 5–10 g.

Fluorides, particularly aqueous solutions of sodium fluoride, are rapidly and quite extensively absorbed by the human body.

Fluorides interfere with electron transport and calcium metabolism. Calcium is essential for maintaining cardiac membrane potentials and in regulating coagulation. High ingestion of fluoride salts or hydrofluoric acid may result in fatal arrhythmias due to profound hypocalcemia. Chronic over-absorption can cause hardening of bones, calcification of ligaments, and buildup on teeth. Fluoride can cause irritation or corrosion to eyes, skin, and nasal membranes.

Sodium fluoride is classed as toxic by both inhalation (of dusts or aerosols) and ingestion. In high enough doses, it has been shown to affect the heart and circulatory system. For occupational exposures, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have established occupational exposure limits at 2.5 mg/m3 over an eight-hour time-weighted average.

In the higher doses used to treat osteoporosis, plain sodium fluoride can cause pain in the legs and incomplete stress fractures when the doses are too high; it also irritates the stomach, sometimes so severely as to cause peptic ulcer disease. Slow-release and enteric-coated versions of sodium fluoride do not have significant gastric side effects, and have milder and less frequent complications in the bones. In the lower doses used for water fluoridation, the only clear adverse effect is dental fluorosis, which can alter the appearance of children&#x27;s teeth during tooth development. A chronic fluoride ingestion of 1 ppm of fluoride in drinking water can cause mottling of the teeth (fluorosis) and an exposure of 1.7 ppm will produce mottling in 30%–50% of patients. Studies have shown that dental fluorosis negatively impacts the self-esteem and self-image of adolescents. 

== Chemical structure ==
Sodium fluoride is an inorganic ionic compound, dissolving in water to give separated Na+ and F− ions. Like sodium chloride, it crystallizes in a cubic motif where both Na+ and F− occupy octahedral coordination sites; its lattice spacing, approximately 462 pm, is smaller than that of sodium chloride (564 pm).

== Occurrence ==
The mineral form of NaF, villiaumite, is moderately rare. It is known from plutonic nepheline syenite rocks.

== Production ==
NaF is prepared by neutralizing hydrofluoric acid or hexafluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6), both byproducts of the reaction of fluorapatite (Ca5(PO4)3F) from phosphate rock during the production of superphosphate fertilizer. Neutralizing agents include sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate. Alcohols are sometimes used to precipitate the NaF:
:HF + NaOH → NaF + H2O
From solutions containing HF, sodium fluoride precipitates as the bifluoride salt sodium bifluoride (NaHF2). Heating the latter releases HF and gives NaF.
:HF + NaF ⇌ NaHF2

In a 1986 report, the annual worldwide consumption of NaF was estimated to be several million tonnes.

<text>Abdul Sattar Edhi (; 28 February 1928 – 8 July 2016)&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn/8july2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was a Pakistani humanitarian, philanthropist and ascetic who founded the Edhi Foundation, which runs the world&#x27;s largest ambulance network, along with homeless shelters, animal shelters, rehabilitation centres, and orphanages across Pakistan.

Edhi&#x27;s charitable activities expanded greatly in 1957 when an Asian flu epidemic originating in China swept through Pakistan and the rest of the world. Donations allowed him to buy his first ambulance the same year. He later expanded his charity network with the help of his wife Bilquis Edhi. Following his death, his son Faisal Edhi took over as head of the Edhi Foundation.

Over his lifetime, the Edhi Foundation expanded, backed entirely by private donations from Pakistani citizens across class, which included establishing a network of 1,800 ambulances. By the time of his death, Edhi was registered as a parent or guardian of nearly 20,000 adopted children.&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian/13july2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He is known amongst Pakistanis as the &quot;Angel of Mercy&quot; and is considered to be Pakistan&#x27;s most respected and legendary figure. In 2013, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; claimed that he might be &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest living humanitarian&quot;.

Edhi maintained a hands-off management style and was often critical of the corruption commonly found within the religious organizations, clergy and politicians. He was a strong proponent of religious tolerance in Pakistan and extended his support to the victims of Hurricane Katrina and the 1985 famine in Ethiopia. He was nominated several times for the Nobel Peace Prize. Edhi received several domestic as well as international awards such as Ramon Magsaysay Award and the UNESCO-Madanjeet Singh Prize.

He died in July 2016 and was buried with full state honours.

== Early life ==
Edhi was a Gujarati Muhajir born into a Memon Muslim family in Bantva, Gujarat, India. He publicly expressed that he was not a &quot;very religious person&quot;, and that he was &quot;neither for religion or against it&quot;. On his faith, he stated that he was a &quot;humanitarian&quot;, telling others that &quot;empty words and long phrases do not impress God&quot; and to &quot;show Him your faith&quot; through action. His mother had brought him up teaching love and care for humans.

== Edhi Foundation and Bilquis Edhi Trust ==
Edhi dedicated his life to aiding the poor. Over the course of sixty years, he single-handedly changed the face of welfare in Pakistan. He founded the Edhi Foundation. Edhi was known for his ascetic lifestyle, owning only two pairs of clothes, never taking salary from his organization, and living in one room with kitchenette at the Foundation&#x27;s headquarters in the heart of Karachi. Additionally, his previously established welfare trust, named the Edhi Trust, was restarted with an initial sum of Rs.5000. The trust was later renamed after his wife as the Bilquis Edhi Trust. Widely regarded and respected as a guardian and savior for the poor, Edhi began receiving numerous donations which allowed him to expand his services. As of 2016, the Edhi Foundation continues to grow in both size and service and currently remains the largest welfare organization in Pakistan. Since its inception, the Edhi Foundation has rescued over 20,000 abandoned infants, rehabilitated over 50,000 orphans, and has trained over 40,000 nurses. It also runs more than 330 welfare centres throughout rural and urban Pakistan that operate as food kitchens, rehabilitation homes, shelters for abandoned women and children, and clinics for the mentally and physically challenged.

The Edhi Foundation is funded entirely by private donations and full services are offered to people irrespective of ethnicity, religion or status. It runs the world&#x27;s largest volunteer ambulance service (operating over 1,500 of them) and offers 24-hour emergency services. It also operates free nursing homes, orphanages, clinics, women&#x27;s shelters, and rehabilitation centres for drug addicts and the mentally ill. Outside of its main base of operations in Pakistan, the Edhi Foundation has run relief operations in South Asia, the Middle East, Africa, the Caucasus region, Eastern Europe, and the United States. In 2005, the foundation donated US$100,000 to relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina. As of 2020, the Foundation has international head offices present in the United States, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, Canada, Australia, Nepal, Bangladesh, India and Japan.

In 2004, Edhi and his organization ran into trouble with Pakistani militants. In 2014, the foundation was targeted and robbed of approximately US$500,000 and has been the victim of right-wing attacks and competition from Pakistan&#x27;s militant far-right

===Travel issues===
In the early 1980s, Edhi was arrested by Israeli troops while he was entering Lebanon. In 2006, he was detained by authorities in Toronto, Canada, for over sixteen hours. In January 2008, U.S. immigration officials at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City investigated him for over eight hours after seizing his passport and other documents. When asked by media officials about the frequent detentions, Edhi said: &quot;The only explanation I can think of is my beard and my dress.&quot; His appearance in traditional Pakistani clothing and a long beard made him appear visibly Muslim and therefore, in a post-9/11 climate, prompted U.S. and Canadian travel authorities to keep him for additional questioning.

==Life in Karachi==
In 1965, Edhi married Bilquis Bado, a nurse who worked at an Edhi Trust dispensary. They had four children, two daughters, and two sons.

Bilquis became responsible for running the free maternity home at the foundation&#x27;s headquarters in Mithandar, Karachi, where she raised her children on the top floor, and on the lower floors, ran the local delivery room, and organised the adoption of abandoned babies. These were babies who were dropped into a cradle placed outside every Edhi centre across the country or found dumped in trash piles in the streets. Often such babies were otherwise at risk of being killed because of being born out of wedlock or due to rape.On 25 June 2013, Edhi was hospitalised at SIUT due to failing kidneys. He would reportedly be on dialysis for the rest of his life unless he found a kidney donor.

The daily operations of the organisation during his ill health and after his passing were managed by his son Faisal Edhi (under the mentorship of Anwar Kazmi, &#x27;the Maulana&#x27;s Lieutenant&#x27;, as his friend Eqbal Ahmad called him), wife Bilquis Edhi (1947-2022), and daughter Kubra (who runs the Edhi centre for women and children at Clifton).

==Death==

=== Organ donation ===
Edhi died on 8 July 2016 at the age of 88 due to kidney failure after having been placed on a ventilator. One of his last wishes was that his organs be donated for the use of the needy but due to his poor health, only his corneas were suitable for donation. In accordance with his wishes, his corneas were donated to two blind people.

=== State funeral ===
Prime Minister Sharif declared national mourning on the day following Edhi&#x27;s death and announced a state funeral for him. He became the third person in Pakistan&#x27;s history to receive a state gun carriage funeral after Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Zia-ul-Haq. He was the only Pakistani without a state authority or a state role to receive a state funeral. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), state honors were given to Edhi by a guard of honor and a 19-gun salute. Following the funeral he was laid to rest at Edhi Village on the outskirts of Karachi.

=== Condolences ===
The attendees at his Janazah (Islamic funeral prayer) included dignitaries such as Mamnoon Hussain (President of Pakistan), Raza Rabbani (Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan), Ishratul Ibad (Governor of Sindh), Syed Qaim Ali Shah and Shehbaz Sharif (the Chief Ministers of Sindh and Punjab, respectively), Raheel Sharif (Chief of Army Staff) along with Muhammad Zakaullah and Sohail Aman (the Chiefs of Staff of the Pakistani Navy and Air Force), at the National Stadium, Karachi. Prominent Pakistani figures such as Maulana Tariq Jamil and Pakistani−Canadian Sheikh Faraz Rabbani often expressed their strong support for Edhi and his work.

Reactions to his death came from several high-ranking Pakistani officials, with then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif saying in an official statement: &quot;We have lost a great servant of humanity. He was the real manifestation of love for those who were socially vulnerable, impoverished, helpless, and poor.&quot; Chief of Army Staff Raheel Sharif called him a &quot;true humanitarian&quot;. He was called Pakistan&#x27;s equivalent of Mother Teresa by &quot;India Today&quot; in 1990, and the &quot;BBC&quot; wrote that he was considered &quot;Pakistan&#x27;s most respected figure and was seen by some as a saint.&quot;

In her condolence message on Edhi&#x27;s death, broadcast by &quot;BBC Urdu&quot;, Malala said that &quot;as a Nobel Peace Prize winner, I hold the right to nominate people for the prize and I have nominated Abdul Sattar Edhi&quot; adding that &quot;even the coveted Nobel Prize cannot be a befitting tribute to Edhi&#x27;s services for humanity&quot;.

<text>Topper is a 1937 American supernatural comedy film starring Constance Bennett and Cary Grant, and featuring Roland Young, Billie Burke, Alan Mowbray, and Eugene Pallette in support. Directed by Norman Z. McLeod, it tells the story of a stuffy, stuck-in-his-ways man who is haunted by the ghosts of a fun-loving married couple.

The film was adapted by Eric Hatch, Jack Jevne and Eddie Moran from the 1926 novel by Thorne Smith. It was produced by Hal Roach and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. &quot;Topper&quot; was a huge hit with film audiences in the summer of 1937.

&quot;Topper&quot; was the first black-and-white film to be digitally colorized, re-released in 1985 by Hal Roach Studios.

==Plot==
George and Marion Kerby are as irresponsible as they are rich. When George wrecks their flashy custom roadster, they wake up from the accident as ghosts. Realizing they are neither in Heaven nor Hell because they have never been responsible enough to do good deeds nor sufficiently venal to do bad, they decide that freeing their old friend Cosmo Topper from his suffocatingly regimented lifestyle will be their ticket into Heaven.

Topper, a wealthy bank president, is oppressed by boredom and routine, compounded by his social-climbing wife Clara’s obsession with presenting a respectable façade. On a whim, he buys the late Kerbys’ car. Soon he meets the ghosts of his dead friends, and immediately they begin to liven up his dull life with drinking, dancing, flirting, and fun.

The escapades lead quickly to Cosmo&#x27;s arrest, and the ensuing scandal alienates his wife. To her astonishment, some of New York New York City’s upper crust she has been desperate to socialize with are piqued by the incident and cozy up.

Cosmo moves out into a hotel with Marion, who claims she is no longer married since she is dead. Clara fears she has lost Cosmo forever. The Toppers&#x27; loyal butler suggests that she lighten up a bit; she decides he&#x27;s right and dons the lingerie and other attire of &quot;a forward woman&quot;.

After Cosmo has a near-death experience and nearly joins George and Marion in the afterlife, the Toppers are happily reunited, and George and Marion, their good deed done, gladly depart for Heaven.

==Cast==
Cast notes
* Early on in the film, songwriter and pianist Hoagy Carmichael makes an uncredited cameo appearance—his debut acting role—as the piano player in the sequence where George and Marion are on the town the night before the meeting at the bank. He introduces the song &quot;Old Man Moon,&quot; which is sung by Grant and Bennett. It&#x27;s also sung later by Three Hits and a Miss. As the couple leave the bar, George (Grant) says, &quot;(Good)night Hoagy!&quot; and Carmichael replies, &quot;So long, see ya next time&quot;.
* Lana Turner makes her second film appearance, uncredited, as a nightclub patron.

==Production==
After a long career producing comedy shorts, producer Hal Roach was looking to expand into long-form films to complement his Laurel and Hardy features, and found a property in &quot;Topper&quot;, a risqué 1926 novel by Thorne Smith. Roach immediately wanted Cary Grant to play George Kerby, but he had difficulty getting the actor to agree to play the part, since Grant was concerned that the supernatural aspects of the story would not work. Roach was successfully able to pitch the film to Grant as a screwball comedy instead—and a $50,000 payday.

For Grant&#x27;s opposite number, Roach was interested in Jean Harlow, and W. C. Fields as Topper, but Harlow was on the brink of death, and Fields turned down the offer. When Roach reached out to Constance Bennett, she was impressed enough with the property that she agreed to be paid less than her usual $40,000 fee.

&quot;Topper&quot; was produced at Hal Roach Studios in Culver City, with location shooting at the entrance to the Bullock&#x27;s Wilshire department store on Wilshire Boulevard - as the entrance to the &quot;Seabreeze Hotel&quot; - and at a location on San Rafael Avenue in Pasadena, California.

The automobile used by George and Marion Kerby, before they become ghosts, and later by Cosmo Topper - whose own car is a 1936 Lincoln Model K - is a custom-made vehicle with a resemblance to Cord and Duesenberg automobiles of the 1930s. Production models of a Cord were too small to use, so the custom body was built on the chassis of a 1936 Buick Roadmaster by Bohman &amp; Schwartz and the external exhaust pipes characteristic of a supercharged Cord are non-functional; the Buick Roadmaster of the time used an eight-in-line (&quot;straight eight&quot;) engine whereas the Cord used a V-8 engine - so external exhaust pipes on both sides of the hood (as per the Cord arrangement) would have meant that at least one side of the car (and probably both) used dummy external pipes. The Buick trunk had special compartments for camera equipment. Afterwards, the car was purchased by the Gilmore Oil Co., who used it for many years for promotional purposes. In 1954, the vehicle was updated utilizing a Chrysler Imperial chassis and drive train.

==Reception==
&quot;Topper&quot; was a box-office hit, and gave a boost to the careers of all the lead actors, in particular Cary Grant, who moved from this film into a sequence of classic screwball comedies such as &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; (1937), &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938), and &quot;Holiday&quot; (1938). Constance Bennett, previously known as more of a &quot;clothes-horse&quot; than an actress, received very good notices, and Roach reunited her with director McLeod and screenwriters Jevne and Moran, as well as Billie Burke and Alan Mowbray, in &quot;Merrily We Live&quot; (1938).

==Awards and honors==
&quot;Topper&quot; was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Roland Young - his only nomination - and Best Sound, Recording for Elmer Raguse.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Laughs - #60
* 2008: AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10:
** Nominated Fantasy Film

==Sequels and adaptations==
&quot;Topper&quot; was followed by the sequels &quot;Topper Takes a Trip&quot; (1938) and &quot;Topper Returns&quot; (1941).

A television series premiered in 1953 and ran for two seasons (78 episodes). It starred Leo G. Carroll as Topper and Robert Sterling and Anne Jeffreys as the ghosts, who died in an avalanche while skiing. They are accompanied by the ghost of Neil, a St. Bernard dog who died trying to rescue them.

A television pilot for a proposed new series, &quot;Topper Returns&quot;, was produced in 1973. It stars Roddy McDowall as the nephew of Cosmo Topper (now deceased) and Stefanie Powers and John Fink as the Kerbys, who have transferred their attention to a younger generation. A TV movie remake (and pilot for a new TV series), &quot;Topper&quot; (1979) was also produced starring Kate Jackson, Jack Warden and Andrew Stevens. According to the article on &quot;Nearly Departed&quot;, a short-lived American TV series of the 1980s starring Eric Idle of Monty Python fame, it was based on the same premise. John Landis directed another &quot;Topper&quot; pilot for CBS in 1992, starring Tim Curry as Cosmo Topper, Courteney Cox as Marion Kerby, and Ben Cross as George Kirby, which was not picked up. In 1999, Hugh Wilson was in talks with producer John Davis to direct a remake of &quot;Topper&quot; but the film was never produced.

==Colorization==
&quot;Topper&quot; was the first black-and-white film to be digitally colorized, re-released in 1985 by Hal Roach Studios, with color by Colorization, Inc. The film was chosen because its original 1937 release represented Hal Roach&#x27;s entry into major feature film production. According to the studio: &quot;In light of this history, it seems fitting that &quot;Topper&quot; should again be on the cutting edge of change, this time heralding the age of colorization as the first completed color version of a classic black and white motion picture&quot;.

<doc id="1224348" wikidata="Q4913586" url="?curid=1224348" title="Bilquis Edhi">
<text>Bilquis Bano Edhi (; 14 August 1947 – 15 April 2022) was a Pakistani nurse who helped save the lives of over 16,000 children. During her career as a nurse and marriage to Abdul Sattar Edhi, she was one of the most active philanthropists in Pakistan. She was the co-chair of the Edhi Foundation, a charity organization that provided many services in Pakistan including a hospital and emergency service in Karachi. For her contributions, she was awarded the 1986 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service and the Mother Teresa Memorial International Award for Social Justice in 2015. She was also a recipient of Hilal-i-Imtiaz, Pakistan&#x27;s second highest civilian honour. For her service to the country, she was also referred to as &quot;The Mother of Pakistan&quot;.

==Biography==
Bilquis was born in 1947 in Bantva, India in present-day state of Gujarat. As a teenager, she was noted to have not enjoyed school and instead joined a small and expanding dispensary as a nurse in 1965. At the time, the Edhi home was in the old city area of Karachi known as Mithadar where it had been founded in 1951. The small number of nurses, predominantly Christian and Hindu, who worked there had just reduced in number. The dispensary&#x27;s founder, Abdul Sattar Edhi, recruited a number of nurses, including Bilquis who, unusually, was from a Muslim background. Bilquis Edhi went on to marry Abdul. The two remained married until his death on 8 July 2016. 

Her husband recognizing her talents, had her lead the small nursing department. He had recognized her enthusiasm and interest during her six-month training program where she had learned basic midwifery and healthcare. They were married when she was nineteen and her husband was nineteen years older. Their honeymoon was unusual in that the newlyweds discovered a young girl with head injuries at their dispensary just after their wedding ceremony. Edhi said in 1989 that she did not regret the time lost in consoling the twelve-year-old&#x27;s concerned relatives or supervising blood transfusions as now &quot;... that girl is married with children; that&#x27;s what is really important.&quot; The Edhi Foundation&#x27;s unofficial website uses the line &quot;Making a difference and changing lives forever.&quot;

Bilquis took over the management of the &quot;jhoolas&quot; project (), the first of which had been built by her husband in 1952. She established over 300 cradles throughout Pakistan where parents can surrender unwanted infants. The cradles carry the message “Do not kill, leave the baby to live in the cradle” in English and Urdu. Over 90% of the surrendered infants are female and a portion of them are disabled. This alternative is thought to have reduced the number of infanticide cases by parents. The Edhi Foundation is also responsible for burying dead babies found by the police. Along with her husband, Bilquis was the co-chair of the Edhi Foundation. The foundation also runs a hospital and emergency service in Karachi.

=== Recognition ===
Bilquis and her husband had received a number of awards in recognition of their work. In July 2007, they were publicly recognized for their work by President Pervez Musharraf who made a personal contribution of rupees to the Edhi Foundation. President Musharraf also noted that their work provided social services to the poor of Pakistan without any discrimination. This contribution contrasts sharply with another offered by President Zia ul-Haq which was turned down because of his perceived political motivations. Despite their relative fame, the couple lived modestly in a two-room apartment which is part of one of their orphanages.

In 2022, Bilquis Edhi was named among &quot;The Muslim 500&quot;, a worldwide list of most influential Muslims. She was also a recipient of the Hilal-i-Imtiaz, Pakistan&#x27;s second highest civilian honour.

===Death===
She died on 15 April 2022 in Aga Khan Hospital, Karachi, due to congestive heart failure after a prolonged illness. Her funeral prayers were offered at New Memon Masjid after which she was buried in Mewa Shah Graveyard, Karachi, on 16 April 2022. The Government of Sindh issued an official obituary for her on her death and announced a day of mourning on 16 April 2022.

<text>SS-Bewerber or Staffel-Bewerber (; &quot;SS-Applicant&quot;) was an SS rank used in Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. The rank of SS-&quot;Bewerber&quot; was the lowest possible SS rank and was assigned to those personnel who were candidates in the SS. The rank was used in the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; as a prelude to appointment as an SS-&quot;Anwärter&quot; (recruit).

Within the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot;, the rank of SS-&quot;Bewerber&quot; was (more often than not) used simply as an administrative title while a background investigation was being conducted on a potential SS member. Typically this would involve a criminal history check, political reliability screening, and investigation into the prospective SS member&#x27;s racial background.

<text>USS Mattabesett, sometimes spelled &quot;Mattabeset&quot;, a schooner-rigged, wooden hulled, double-ended sidewheel gunboat, was built by A. &amp; G. T. Sampson, Boston, Massachusetts, and named for the Mattabesset River in Connecticut. &quot;Mattabesett&quot; was delivered to the New York Navy Yard on January 18, 1864, and commissioned April 7, 1864, Commander John C. Febiger in command.

==Service history==
&quot;Mattabesett&quot; departed New York on April 21, 1864, for duty in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and arrived at Hampton Roads on April 23 as escort to . Continuing down the coast to enter the North Carolina Sounds, she took part in an engagement between Union forces and the Confederate ram CSS &quot;Albemarle&quot;, accompanied by CSS &quot;Bombshell&quot; and CSS &quot;Cotton Plant&quot;, off the mouth of the Roanoke River on May 5. In the course of the battle, leading to the capture of Plymouth, North Carolina by Confederate forces, &quot;Mattabesett&quot;, with , captured &quot;Bombshell&quot;, but &quot;Albemarle&quot; and &quot;Cotton Plant&quot; escaped.

But for a brief trip to New York in the fall of 1864, &quot;Mattabesett&quot; continued to serve the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron for the remainder of the U.S. Civil War, operating primarily in the inland waters of North Carolina. She sailed north in May 1865, decommissioned at New York on May 31, and was sold there on October 15.

<doc id="1224360" wikidata="Q420035" url="?curid=1224360" title="Sulfasalazine">
<text>Sulfasalazine, sold under the brand name Azulfidine among others, is a medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn&#x27;s disease. It is considered by some to be a first-line treatment in rheumatoid arthritis. It is taken by mouth or can be administered rectally.
Significant side effects occur in about 25% of people. Commonly these include loss of appetite, nausea, headache, and rash. Severe side effects include bone marrow suppression, liver problems, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and kidney problems. It should not be used in people allergic to aspirin or sulfonamide. Use during pregnancy appears to be safe for the baby.
Sulfasalazine is in the disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) family of medications. It is unclear exactly how it works. One proposed mechanism is the inhibition of prostaglandins, resulting in local anti-inflammatory effects in the colon. The medication is broken down by intestinal bacteria into sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid. 
Sulfasalazine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1950. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Sulfasalazine is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 284th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Sulfasalazine is used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#x27;s disease. It is also indicated for use in rheumatoid arthritis and used in other types of inflammatory arthritis (e.g. psoriatic arthritis and reactive arthritis).

It is usually not given to children under two years of age.

==Side effects==
Use of sulfasalazine is contraindicated in people with sulfa allergies and in those with urinary tract obstructions, intestinal obstructions, and severe liver or kidney problems.

Sulfasalazine metabolizes to sulfapyridine. Serum levels should be monitored every three months, and more frequently at the outset. Serum levels above 50 μg/L are associated with side effects. In rare cases, sulfasalazine can cause severe depression in young males. It can also cause oligospermia and temporary infertility. Immune thrombocytopenia has been reported.

Sulfasalazine inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, and can cause folate deficiency and megaloblastic anemia. and various other undesirable effects.

Sulfasalazine can cause hemolytic anemia in people with G6PD deficiency.

Sulfasalazine can cause kidney stones.
Sulfasalazine may cause stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, headache, dizziness, or unusual tiredness. Skin and urine can become orange, with occasional allergic reactions.

Sulfasalazine may cause sulfhemoglobinemia.

==Pharmacology==
Around 90% of a dose of sulfasalazine reaches the colon, where most of it is metabolized by bacteria into sulfapyridine and mesalazine (also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid or 5-ASA). Both metabolites are active; most of the sulfapyridine is absorbed and then further metabolized, but most mesalazine is not, and remains in the colon.

A mix of unchanged, hydroxylated, and glucuronidated sulfapyridine is eliminated in urine, as is acetylated mesalazine and unmetabolized sulfasalazine.

The mechanism of action is not clear, but it appears that sulfasalazine and its metabolites have immunosuppressive, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory effects. It also appears to inhibit the cystine-glutamate antiporter, as well as sepiapterin reductase.

==Chemistry==
It is a codrug which is a combination of sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid coupled with an azo linkage.

==Cost==
In people with rheumatoid arthritis, the cost-effectiveness of sulfasalazine is improved by combining it with other drugs. It is commonly used in treating inflammatory bowel disease in part due to its cost effectiveness.

==Research==
Sulfasalazine has been studied in cirrhosis, psoriasis, idiopathic urticaria, and amyloidosis.

<text>Francesco &quot;Frank&quot; Pia is an American lifeguard, recognized in the field for his research and training on ways to rescue people in trouble in the water. He is best known for:

==Education==
Pia attended Long Island University where he received his BA in 1968 and his MA in 1973. He attended the City University of New York and received his MS in 1976, and an Advanced Certificate in Clinical School Psychology in 1977.

He has several publications in the area of forensics on drowning accident causes that are used by lawyers and aquatic experts in personal injury litigation, including:
* Unobserved Drownings: The Unnoticed Struggle 
* Establishing Causation in Unobserved Drownings

==Pia carry==
The Pia carry was created by Pia for use exclusively by lifeguards. It requires a strong legs-only kick that is used to support the drowning non-swimmer as far out of the water as possible (at least the shoulders out), to stop the instinctive drowning response. It is standard procedure for most lifeguard training. Frank Pia is a recognized authority on lifeguarding and drowning.

It is a control carry which may be used on conscious, distressed non-swimmers (DNS); as such, it is considered an extremely high-risk rescue technique and rescuers should attempt it only if trained and fit to do so. Direct contact with victims should be chosen last, after having attempted or ruled out all other &quot;rungs&quot; of the ladder approach.

The technique consists of approaching the victim from behind and below to minimize risk and maximize control; encircling the victim&#x27;s waist or hips with one arm; and supporting the victim&#x27;s buttocks or thigh on your hip. This ensures that the victim&#x27;s head and shoulders are clear of the water while you swim to safety with a one-arm pull and either whipkick or eggbeater kick. The rescuer should attempt to keep his or her head clear of the surface to reassure the victim while moving to safety. This carry is used only over short distances where safety can be reached within 10–15 m and there is back-up help available.

While encouraged, the Pia carry is not the only accepted control DNS carry; &quot;must-sees&quot; for the NLS physical skill only require the victim&#x27;s head and shoulders be clear of the water.

<doc id="1224378" wikidata="Q7140486" url="?curid=1224378" title="Particle Man">
<text>&quot;Particle Man&quot; is a song by alternative rock band They Might Be Giants, released and published in 1990. The song is the seventh track on the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Flood&quot;. It has become one of the band&#x27;s most popular songs, despite never having been released as a single. John Linnell and John Flansburgh performed the song, backed by a metronome, for their 1990 &quot;Flood&quot; promotional video. Although it was released over a decade before the band began writing children&#x27;s music, &quot;Particle Man&quot; is sometimes cited as a particularly youth-appropriate TMBG song, and a precursor to their first children&#x27;s album, &quot;No!&quot;, which was not explicitly educational. The song is partially influenced by the theme of the 1967 &quot;Spider-Man&quot; TV series.

They Might Be Giants&#x27; official YouTube account has the user name &quot;ParticleMen&quot;, derived from the song title.

== Lyrical content ==
The song describes four different &quot;men&quot;: Particle Man, a microscopic being whose attributes are deemed &quot;not important&quot; enough to be discussed lyrically; Triangle Man, a belligerent entity who hates Particle Man, fights him, and wins; Universe Man, a kinder being, who is the size of the universe, and has a watch with hands relevant to the age of the universe (&quot;He’s got a watch with a minute hand, a millennium hand, and an eon hand&quot;); and Person Man, a &quot;degraded&quot; being who lives in a garbage can, somehow feels worthless, and who is also despised, challenged, and defeated by Triangle Man. The song&#x27;s author, John Linnell, denied the assertion that there is a deeper meaning to &quot;Particle Man&quot;, stating on a phone interview filmed for &quot;Gigantic (A Tale of Two Johns)&quot; that &quot;nothing is missing from your understanding of &#x27;Particle Man. Band member John Flansburgh described it as &quot;just a song about characters in the most obvious sense&quot; and claims that the lyrics are not intended to allude to real people, though Linnell later said that &quot;Triangle Man was based on a friend&#x27;s observation that Robert Mitchum looked like an evil triangle when he took his shirt off in &quot;Night of the Hunter&quot;. Nothing else not explicitly stated need be inferred.&quot;

== Video ==
Both &quot;Particle Man&quot; and another They Might Be Giants song, &quot;Istanbul&quot;, were made into music videos featured on the Warner Bros. animated series, &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; and &quot;The Plucky Duck Show&quot;. Both appeared in the episode &quot;Tiny Toons Music Television&quot;. In the video for &quot;Particle Man&quot;, Plucky Duck portrays both the title role (as a wrestler) and Person Man (after discarding his outfit), while Triangle Man and Universe Man are presented as massive wrestlers. The video also includes cameos by The Crusher from the Looney Tunes short &quot;Bunny Hugged&quot;, Hamton J. Pig as a wrestling announcer who lip-syncs the song&#x27;s lyrics, and Dizzy Devil playing the accordion.

The music videos for &quot;Particle Man&quot; and &quot;Istanbul&quot; are credited with having introduced young fans to the band. Although they were not official music videos, the &quot;Tiny Toons&quot; selections warranted inclusion on the band&#x27;s 1999 video compilation, &quot;Direct from Brooklyn&quot;.

== Influence and usage ==
In addition to the &quot;Tiny Toons Adventures&quot; music video above, &quot;Particle Man&quot; has been performed by schoolchildren on multiple occasions. In two such instances, the band has obtained recordings of the performances and released them to their fans and the general public. A cover entitled &quot;Schoolchildren Singing &#x27;Particle Man, recorded by a music teacher at an elementary school, appeared on the band&#x27;s Dial-A-Song phone line, as well as their 1997 compilation &quot;&quot;. John Linnell stated that this was his favourite version of the song. Another rendition was done by the fifth graders of the Kingsley Montessori School in Boston. The recording was accompanied by an animated video made by the students, which the band uploaded to YouTube.

In the Marvel Comics series &quot;X-Factor&quot;, writer Peter David referenced &quot;Particle Man&quot; as the source song for a fictional parody by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic about the character Multiple Man. A partial verse, which discussed Multiple Man&#x27;s ability to create duplicates of himself, was presented as a radio broadcast in issue #73. The song was also a minor inspiration to author Terry Pratchett. One of his recurring &quot;Discworld&quot; characters, Foul Ole Ron, frequently mutters &quot;millennium hand and shrimp&quot;. This was a result of Pratchett feeding various texts to a text-generation computer program, and this phrase was a result of merging this song&#x27;s lyrics (which mention a &quot;millennium hand&quot;) with a Chinese takeaway menu.

A cover of the song was used, in part, for advertisements and previews for the video game &quot;Geometry Wars: Galaxies&quot;. In reference to the nature of &quot;Geometry Wars&quot;, the part of the song about &quot;Triangle Man&quot; is particularly stressed.

The single &quot;Particle Man&quot; appears on &quot;Dr. Demento&#x27;s 25th Anniversary Collection,&quot; released in 1995 on Rhino Records.

<text>Te Papapa is a suburb of Auckland, New Zealand. It is located nine kilometres to the southeast of Auckland city centre, on the northern shore of Māngere Inlet, an arm of the Manukau Harbour. The residential and light-industrial suburb lies between the suburbs of Onehunga, Penrose, and Southdown, and is at the northern end of the Māngere Bridge which connects it with the South Auckland suburb of Māngere. Train services on the Onehunga Line run through the suburb on the Onehunga Branch line, which reopened in 2010. Services at Te Papapa station commenced on 19 September 2010. Carter Holt Harvey&#x27;s head office is located at 173 Captain Springs Road in the Te Papapa area. It has been suggested that the name of the suburb refers to a fortress built of rock slabs. However, at the time Te Papapa Railway Station first opened the area around was commonly known as &quot;Pumpkin Flat&quot; and a short article in the Auckland Star reported that the general manager of the railways had chosen to name the station after the &quot;Maori long pumpkin or Te Papapa&quot; in remembrance of the commonly used name.

<doc id="1224390" wikidata="Q5167985" url="?curid=1224390" title="Cooranbong, New South Wales">
<text>Cooranbong ( ;) is a town in a suburb of the City of Lake Macquarie, Greater Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia, west of the town of Morisset off the M1 Pacific Motorway. Cooranbong is surrounded by the Watagans National Park.

The town&#x27;s name is derived from the Aboriginal word &quot;Kour-an-bong&quot;, meaning &quot;rocky bottom creek&quot; or &quot;water over rocks&quot;.

There is a particularly large Seventh-day Adventist presence in Cooranbong. As of the 2021 census, 23.5% of the suburb is Seventh-day Adventist, which is higher than every other religious denomination besides &quot;no religion&quot;.

== History ==
The Aboriginal people, in this area, the Awabakal, were the first people of this land.

Prior to settlement and development of the area now known as Cooranbong, lived people who identify as part of the Awabakal group. It is unknown as to how long the people lived collectively as a single group and the nature of their interactions through peace and conflict with other people not of their own kin.

The first modern settler was Lieutenant Percy Simpson, who received a land grant from the government and was assigned six convicts who cleared the land, grazed cattle and built a homestead near Dora Creek. Although Simpson only stayed there for two years, one of his convicts, Moses Carroll, became a stockman in the area, eventually becoming the area&#x27;s police constable. The Robertson Land Act of 1861 allowed the town to grow, encouraging the construction of a Catholic church and later, a school, police station and courthouse (1873), a post office (1881) and an Anglican church. Timber cutting was the primary economic activity, during the 1880s the population reached 700.When the railway was built from Sydney to Newcastle in the 1880s, the line passed around 5 km east of the town centre. The station and associated settlement were originally labelled as Cooranbong but later became known as Morisset. This was devastating to the local economy in conjunction with the significant economic depression occurring in the colony. Consequently, the population declined to 206 people by 1891. This economic depression continued until the Seventh-day Adventist Church bought on the northern bank of Dora Creek where they built Avondale School for Christian Workers (1897) and Sanitarium Health Food Company (1909).

== Present day ==
Cooranbong, located at the foothills of the Watagan Mountains, has seen rapid growth, particularly due to the development of the Watagan Park estate. This master-planned community, developed by the Johnson Property Group, has attracted over 1,000 families to the area, with another 2,000 expected to move in over the next 7-8 years. Watagan Park’s appeal lies in its proximity to nature, recreational activities, and educational facilities like Avondale School and Avondale University College.

The estate includes a Town Centre development, which is currently under construction and scheduled to open in late 2025. This centre will feature 23 specialty shops, a Woolworths supermarket, and a range of housing options, catering to the growing demand for high-quality, family-friendly living in the region. With significant investments in infrastructure and amenities, Cooranbong is quickly becoming one of the fastest-growing regions in the Lake Macquarie area.

Johnson Property Group, led by developer Keith Johnson, is committed to enhancing the quality of life for residents, with plans for further expansion, including parks, hiking and biking trails, and easy access to Lake Macquarie for boating and water sports. The development aims to create a self-sufficient community with a strong focus on lifestyle, convenience, and connection to nature.

The Avondale Estate is a Seventh-day Adventist owned estate opposite the Cooranbong shops. The estate is home to Avondale University, a Seventh-day Adventist tertiary education institution, the Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company, Avondale College Church, Avondale Memorial Church, a disused dairy farm and Avondale Retirement Village. A number of Avondale University students and staff also live on the estate in off-campus housing.

There is also St Patrick&#x27;s &amp; St Brigid&#x27;s Catholic Church, a small church built in 1906 to replace the original 1861 structure. The oldest headstone in its cemetery dates to 1862.

==Sunnyside Historic Home==
Sunnyside Historic Home was constructed by Seventh-day Adventist Church co-founder Ellen G. White and served as her home base for six years while she lived in Australia (1895–1900). It originally sat on 40 acres of land Mrs White bought from the church for $1,350 in an effort to provide needed funds for the school development. The home was where she wrote significant portions of her most popular books, including the Desire of Ages, a work on the life of Christ. Ellen White was instrumental in founding Avondale College, and the home sits near the campus. It was bought by the Australasian (now South Pacific) Division in 1960, and they restored Sunnyside. The home is available for tours.

<doc id="1224402" wikidata="Q3509364" url="?curid=1224402" title="Geographical Association">
<text>The Geographical Association (GA) is an association in the United Kingdom. The organisation has a stated aim of improving geographical knowledge of the public through promoting geographical education.

==Origins==
The Geographical Association was formed by five geographers, including Halford John Mackinder, in 1893 as an independent, unincorporated association. The first members got together to use and exchange lantern slides, a leading technology of the day. The history of the first hundred years of the GA was published in 1993 and a more recently a chronological list of key people, events and achievements of the association up to the present day has been produced. 

The current purpose remains the development of a community of practice for sharing teaching ideas, innovations and understanding about geographical education, but the GA also serves as a voice for and represents the interests of geography teachers in policy and practice initiatives through engagement with government.

==Constitution and Operation==
The GA has approximately 10,000 members. These include primary and secondary teachers, trainee teachers (student teachers), teacher educators, academics, geography students, infant, primary and secondary schools, colleges, universities, academies, libraries, societies, museums and businesses. Although a UK-based organisation, there are members in more than 60 countries with strong links between geographical organisations in the USA, Australia and Europe. Its core activities are financed by membership subscriptions.

The Geographical Association was incorporated under the Companies Act 2006 on 28 January 2010 as a private company limited by guarantee (company number 07139068). Charitable status was subsequently conferred by the Charity Commission on 24 March 2010, under registration number 1135148. The GA had previously existed as an unincorporated association (registered charity number 31329) since its formation in 1893. The main motivation for the change in the legal structure of the GA in 2010 was the purchase of property, in the form the land and buildings that it had been occupying since 1997.

The GA is governed by a Board of 14 Directors. They are the legal members of the Geographical Association limited company and also its Trustees. This Board is called the Governing Body. The power to appoint Members of the Governing Body rests with the Governing Body itself, but the wider membership of the GA may, by means of the election procedures set out in the By-laws, make nominations for membership of the Governing Body. The Governing Body also has the power to co-opt up to three individuals (within the total of 14) to fill specialist roles.

Members make considerable input to the work and activities of the Association through voluntary contributions of time and expertise. Key aspects of geography education are developed through special interest groups and phase committees.

There is a network of 41 affiliated regional branches of the GA. Each branch has an autonomous constitution, broadly similar to the national association. Branches organise lectures for post-16 students, teachers and general public and a programme of professional development activities for teachers. Many run a regional Worldwise geographical quiz competition.

The education policy of GA is formulated by a representative Education Group, which oversees the activities of its Phase Committees, Special Interest Groups and Communications Boards.

In broad terms the priorities, plans and achievement goals for the GA are set out in a 5-year strategic plan which identifies the three key aims of the Association for 2014-19. These are 1. Meet professional and educational needs, 2. Demonstrate the value of geographical education , and 3. Use (the GA&#x27;s) resources efficiently and sustainably.

The GA Office and headquarters is in Sheffield with a core body of professional staff who provide day-to-day and strategic services under the leadership of an appointed Chief Executive.

==Activities==
Publications: Journals

The GA publishes three professional journals for members on a termly basis (three issues each year, based on the different phases of education viz. &quot;Primary Geography&quot;, &quot;Teaching Geography&quot; (aimed at Secondary/High school teachers) and &quot;Geography&quot; - its flagship international journal for post-16 students, undergraduates, teachers and lecturers. &quot;Geography&quot; publishes articles by leading geographers and geography educators that provide summaries and reviews of contemporary geographical topics and developments in geography education. The aim is to help &#x27;recontextualise&#x27; the discipline of geography for educational purposes and also be a means for university academics to keep in touch with the school subject.

Publications: Geography resources

The GA produces and sells a range of resources and guidance materials for teachers for Early Years through to Post-16 teachers. These include the geographical adventures of a teddy bear called &#x27;Barnaby Bear&#x27; (A Trade Marked product) for primary-aged children, Handbooks for primary and secondary school teachers, &#x27;Toolkits&#x27; providing curriculum planning advice and lesson ideas for secondary school teachers, and a series of &#x27;Top Spec Geography&#x27; booklets on contemporary topics aimed at AS/A2 level students. 
In addition at a more general level, the catalogue includes a series interpretive guides to areas of &#x27;classic&#x27; landforms and the exploration of cities and how they have been shaped.

Social Media for geography teachers

News and information for geography teachers is disseminated via the GA website, Facebook page and Twitter feed. The GA also facilitates a series of Ning networks and communities for geography teachers and educators.

Resources for geography teachers

The GA website is a platform and depository for teaching ideas and resources. These are frequently updated as new geographical events occur or innovations in geography teaching approaches are developed.

A manifesto for geography education

In 2009 the GA published a document &#x27;A Different View&#x27; describing geography as &#x27;one of humanity&#x27;s big ideas&#x27; aimed at making a compelling case for geography&#x27;s place in the curriculum, demonstrating the practical importance of &#x27;real world&#x27; geography and the value of geographical thinking.

Campaigning for geography

The Geographical Association engages with policy makers and government ministers to constantly make the case for geography, with a strong involvement in curriculum reviews and Government education consultations. From 2006- 2011 the Geographical Association and RGS-IBG jointly led the government-funded Action Plan for Geography.

The Geographical Association develops geography subject leadership at all levels, from new teachers during their initial training, to geography co-ordinators in primary schools, to secondary heads of department.

Annual conference

An annual conference rotates between locations in the north, midlands and south e.g. Manchester (2016), Guildford (2017) and offers a varied programme of lectures, talks, workshops and a large exhibition of geography education resources and published materials. The conference also includes a free public lecture and an awards event.

Training Courses

The Geographical Association runs a programme of continuing professional development events in different locations around the country.

Quality Marks
The GA operates a scheme whereby schools or geography departments can apply to be recognised for quality and progress and creative thinking in geography leadership, curriculum development, learning and teaching in school. The scheme encourages a development process using a self-assessment framework with submitted of examples of geography planning, lessons and students&#x27; work. Awards are made by a scrutiny panel of expert teachers. The awards are available for primary and secondary schools and are offered at Bronze, Silver and Gold Standards. Successful schools can apply for recognition as a Centre of Excellence. Evidence from schools that have used the Geography Quality Mark scheme indicates they find the evaluative framework a powerful and enabling tool for curriculum development.

Worldwise

The GA operates a series of activities to engage students directly under the banner &#x27;Worldwise&#x27;. Activities include local and online geography quizzes, photo competitions, an essay competition and a fieldwork challenge weekend.

Funded projects

Over a number of years the Geographical Association has established itself as a leading force in the development of innovative geography projects in partnership with a variety of high-profile funders, e.g. the government-funded &#x27;Global Learning Programme&#x27; and the British Council &#x27;Connecting Classrooms&#x27; programme aimed at developing critical thinking and problem solving in geography.
The GA has been a partner or participant in a range of Europe-wide projects e.g. GeoCapabilities Project.

<text>Chris Pirillo is an American entrepreneur and former television personality. He is the founder and former CEO of LockerGnome, Inc., a network of technology-focused blogs, web forums, mailing lists, and online communities that operated from 1996 to 2015. Pirillo is perhaps best known as the former host of &quot;Call for Help,&quot; a call-in tech support show which, at the time, aired on TechTV from 2001 to 2003.

==Career==
LockerGnome began as a technology mailing list in 1996, offering tips and tricks for operating systems and applications, software suggestions (with an emphasis on public domain and shareware software), and web site recommendations. Over time, the site expanded to incorporate content syndicated from LockerGnome&#x27;s blogs for IT professionals. The associated web forum for help with and discussions about technology operated from 2002 to 2015.

Pirillo has authored several books, including &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s E-mail Publishing&quot;, &quot;Online! The Book,&quot; the latter co-authored with John C. Dvorak and Wendy Taylor.

In March 2015, Pirillo announced plans to revive Gnomedex, a technology conference he had previously organized, with the intention of transforming it into more of a fair or festival experience rather than as a single-track conference.

In 2019, Pirillo joined Intel as a community advocate.

<text>Edward Reichmann (; 1925 – July 2005) was an Israeli businessman. He is the oldest of the five Reichmann brothers, famed for their global business empire.

He was born to Samuel Reichmann, a wealthy Vienna merchant of Hungarian origin from Beled. The family was lucky to escape Austria before the Nazi invasion leaving the country on the morning of Anschluss to tend to Edward&#x27;s grandfather David who had suffered a stroke. From Hungary the family made its way to Paris and then the neutral city of Tangier where Samuel established a successful business in currency trading.

Reichmann was the first of the Reichmann&#x27;s to emigrate to Canada. He liked Canada, being attracted by Montreal&#x27;s large Jewish community and favourable economic prospects. In Montreal, he joined with his brother Louis to found Olympia Floor and Tile, a company that imported tiles from overseas. The business was a success. When Edward&#x27;s three younger brothers Paul, Albert, and Ralph moved to Canada, he convinced them to settle in Toronto and open a branch of the tile company there.

In Toronto, Edward&#x27;s three brothers quickly moved into building and property development. Edward, seeing their success, also moved into this industry. He put much energy into building connections with the city&#x27;s political elite, including becoming a close associate of mayor Jean Drapeau.

Despite a number of major projects, Edward Reichmann&#x27;s construction ventures did not prosper. Nearing bankruptcy, the company only survived through a massive bailout by his Toronto-based brothers. Edward felt embarrassed at having to be rescued by his younger brothers and left Canada for Israel. There, he again turned to property development, rising to become Israel&#x27;s fifteenth richest man. These ventures were largely unaffected by the collapse of his brothers&#x27; Olympia and York company.

<text>John Riley Brodie (born August 14, 1935) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL) for 17 seasons. He had a second career as a Senior PGA Tour professional golfer and was a television broadcaster for both sports.

In particular seasons, Brodie led the NFL in passing yardage, passing touchdowns, fewest sacks, and lowest percentage of passes intercepted. He retired as the third most prolific career passer in NFL history. He was the league MVP in and a two-time Pro Bowler.

==Early life==
Born in Menlo Park, California, Brodie grew up in the Montclair district of Oakland and attended Montclair Grammar (later Elementary) School. He was a standout athlete at Oakland Technical High School and graduated in 1953.

==College career==
Brodie played college football across the San Francisco Bay at Stanford University, where he was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity. In his senior season of 1956, Brodie was a consensus All-American and played on the Stanford golf team, which kept him out of spring football drills.

Brodie nearly chose golf for his sporting career, turning professional following completion of his time on the Stanford team and playing in several tournaments on the PGA Tour.

Brodie later said of his first golfing experience:

&quot;You talk about pressure. I was always worried that I wasn&#x27;t going to make the cut. Fact is there was only one time I was close enough to say I was in competition in the final round. I had to make up my mind. I couldn&#x27;t be pro in two sports and do justice to either one.&quot;

==Professional career==

Brodie was the third overall selection of the 1957 NFL draft and saw limited action as a rookie with the 49ers in 1957. He got more playing time in 1958 through 1960, sharing time with Y. A. Tittle; he became the starter in 1961 (Tittle was traded to the New York Giants), and continued in that role through 1973.

Brodie was among the leading passers in the league throughout the 1960s. His best statistical year was 1965, when he led the league in passing yardage (3,112 yards) and passing touchdowns (30), leading to his first of two Pro Bowl appearances.

Following his outstanding 1965 season, in which he made about $35,000, Brodie was courted by the Houston Oilers of the rival AFL. Newspaper reports indicated that a contract with the Oilers paying between $650,000 and $1 million had been arranged. After the NFL Giants signed kicker Pete Gogolak from the AFL champion Bills, offers to Brodie and other NFL stars, like Mike Ditka and Roman Gabriel, expedited the merger agreement between the two leagues in June . An improved contract offer from the 49ers moved Brodie to stay put in San Francisco, however, and a multi-year deal paying Brodie $900,000 over several seasons was instead inked.

The 1970 season proved to be particularly stellar for Brodie. During that year, he led the entire NFL with 24 touchdown passes, 223 completions, 2,941 yards, and a passer rating of 93.8. while taking a league low eight sacks during the entire season. Brodie also paced NFL quarterbacks with a league-leading 2.6% of his passes resulting in interception. Brodie&#x27;s outstanding season was rewarded when he received the 1970 NFL Most Valuable Player Award, and the 49ers had the number one offense by points, and ultimately won their first playoff game in franchise history.
When Brodie retired from the NFL at the end of the 1973 season, he ranked third in career passing yards, behind only Johnny Unitas and Fran Tarkenton. He ranked eighth in touchdown passes upon his retirement, and stayed in the top ten for most touchdown passes from 1970 to 1988. On each list, only he and one other player are not in the Pro Football Hall of Fame (Babe Parilli and John Hadl, respectively).

In 2004, Brodie was named to the Professional Football Researchers Association Hall of Very Good in the association&#x27;s second HOVG class.

===Career after football===

After he retired from football, Brodie served as an NFL football and golf analyst for NBC Sports. He spent two seasons (1977 and 1978) as the network&#x27;s No. 1 NFL analyst, alongside play-by-play man Curt Gowdy, and called Super Bowl XIII in January 1979. Among the other notable NFL games he worked was the Epic in Miami, the January 1982 AFC playoff game between the San Diego Chargers and Miami Dolphins, with play-by-play man Don Criqui.

He competed as a professional golfer on the Senior PGA Tour (now the Champions Tour) from 1985 to 1998. Brodie had one win and twelve top-ten finishes, earning a total of $735,000. He had the longest gap between appearances in the U.S. Open — missing the cut in both 1959 and 1981.

Brodie suffered a major stroke in 2000, rendering speech difficult for him.

In 2006, Brodie&#x27;s number 12 jersey was brought out of retirement and worn by Trent Dilfer, backup quarterback for the 49ers. Dilfer, a close personal friend of Brodie, hoped to bring attention to Brodie&#x27;s bid for enshrinement in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1986.

In 2010, Brodie was inducted into the African-American Ethnic Sports Hall of Fame, becoming the first European-American so honored.

===Personal life===
John married Sue in 1957. They have four daughters and a son, and 12 grandchildren. One of his daughters, Erin, found fame on television in 2003 during the first season of the reality series &quot;For Love or Money&quot;. Another daughter, Diane, was married until 2011 to former NFL quarterback Chris Chandler. His son-in-law is the renowned dermatologist Dr. Will Kirby.

During the 1969 season, Brodie experienced tendinitis in his throwing arm, which caused him to miss two and a half games. He received cortisone shots in an effort to remedy the problem, without apparent success. In desperation for relief, Brodie was introduced to a representative of the Church of Scientology, who — Brodie insisted at the time — used Dianetics-based techniques to eliminate the tendinitis by the following week. Thus began a connection between Brodie and the church.

Brodie was for years thereafter one of the leading celebrity endorsers of the Church of Scientology. This public role was ultimately ended when several of Brodie&#x27;s friends were expelled or harassed in a power struggle with the Church&#x27;s hierarchy. While professing continued admiration for the teachings of church founder L. Ron Hubbard, &quot;there were many in the church I felt were treated unfairly,&quot; Brodie told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1990.

<text>The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia refers to two different versions of a Bible encyclopedia: a 1915 fundamentalist edition, and a 1979–1995 revised evangelical edition.

The first version was published under the general editorship of the fundamentalist James Orr (1844–1913), among other objectives to counteract the impact of higher criticism. The original encyclopedia was published by the Howard-Severance Co., Chicago, in 1915. It is in the public domain and can be found freely available at various sites.

A revised version, edited by Geoffrey W. Bromiley, was published by Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. in the years 1979 (Vol. 1, Vol. 2 appeared in 1982) to 1995 (Vols. 3 and 4). It contains articles by nearly 200 evangelical scholars about archaeological discoveries, the language and literature of Bible lands, customs, family life, occupations, and the historical and religious environments of Bible people.

==Reception==
===Second edition===
The first two volumes both won the Gold Medallion Book Award for reference books.

Writing in a 1984 book review for &quot;The Churchman&quot;, Stephen Motyer said the conservatism of the &quot;International Standard Bible Encyclopedia&quot; &quot;is that of broad, main-line evangelicalism, although it seems to be slightly more conservative than the work it replaces&quot;. He also says it makes &quot;dogmatic use of the Bible&quot;, and adds: &quot;sometimes it seems to go over the top somewhat&quot;. However, he concludes &quot;The criticisms I have made do not, to my mind, qualify the great solid worth of this production...I...seriously commend this encyclopedia...&quot;

<text>Dennis Schmitt is an American veteran explorer, adventurer and composer.

==Early life==
Schmitt grew up in Berkeley, California, the son of mixed German and American parentage. His father was a plumber. Displaying early aptitude with languages, music and mathematics, Schmitt graduated from Berkeley High School in 1963, and went on to study linguistics at UC Berkeley with Noam Chomsky in his late teens. Chomsky recruited Schmitt, aged 19, to travel to Alaska&#x27;s Brooks Range and attempt to learn the Nunamiut dialect.

== Career ==
Schmitt lived for four years at an Alaskan Inuit village named Anaktuvuk Pass before leading expeditions, including the Sierra Club. In 2003, Schmitt discovered one of the candidates for the title of &quot;northernmost land in the world&quot;. Deciding that Greenland should name its own islands, he simply called it &quot;83-42&quot; after its latitude, a name that has remained.

Two years later, in 2005, Schmitt discovered a new island revealed by the retreat of an ice shelf in East Greenland. Uunartoq Qeqertaq, Inuit for &quot;The Warming Island&quot;, lies 400 miles north of the Arctic Circle. The Sierra Club reported on a Schmitt quote to &quot;The New York Times&quot;:

=== Expeditions ===
Schmitt is also credited with the July 2007 discovery of another candidate for the &quot;northernmost&quot; title, named Stray Dog West by expedition member Holly Wenger. Stray Dog West, at 83º40&#x27;30&quot;, belongs to a shifting, semi-permanent archipelago locked in the sea ice north of Peary Land in northeast Greenland, named the Stray Dog Islands. The first island of the archipelago was discovered on July 10, 1996, by Steve Gardiner and Jim Schaefer and is commonly known as the 1996 ATOW Island after the 1996 American – Top Of The World Expedition.

Schmitt was the first person to climb the highest point of the Daly Range, part of the northernmost mountain chain on Earth, as well as Alaska&#x27;s Brooks Range from Point Hope to the Mackenzie River, and made the first traverse of Axel Heiberg Island, northern Canada. He also crossed the sea ice of the Bering Straits to the Soviet Union, and travelled through Eskimo villages of eastern Siberia. Upon his return, the FBI detained Schmitt but released him without charge.

=== Musical works ===
* &quot;Song Cycle I&quot; (Mental trash from warm bodies (plus extras))
* &quot;Prologue and Aurora&quot; (1977)
* &quot;The Alaska Wilderness Adventure&quot; (1978)

== Personal life ==
Schmitt speaks multiple languages, including Russian, Norwegian, Danish, and French. He lives in Berkeley and composes classical music, being credited for the soundtrack to the 1978 movie, &quot;The Alaska Wilderness Adventure&quot;. Schmitt also writes sonnets under the pen name D O&#x27;Farrell.

<text> () is a German title that translates as &quot;candidate&quot;, &quot;applicant&quot; or &quot;recruit&quot;. During the Nazi era, SS- was used as a paramilitary rank by both the Nazi Party and the SS. Within the Nazi Party, an was someone who had been accepted into a government service position and the rank was issued in two degrees: one for party members and the other for non-party members. was the lowest Nazi Party rank in the extensive system of Nazi Party political ranks.

As an SS rank, an SS- was a recruit, someone who had applied for membership in the SS and was undergoing a probationary period, after which time an appointment would be issued to the rank of SS-&quot;Mann&quot;. The earliest recorded use of as an SS rank was 1932;

Within the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot;, the transition from to &quot;Mann&quot; was an extensive process, typically taking over one year. During that year, a potential SS member would be drilled and indoctrinated; racial, political, and background checks would also be conducted. At the end of this time, typically in an elaborate ceremony, an would be promoted to the rank of SS-&quot;Mann&quot;.

After 1941, was also used as a rank of the Waffen-SS, but to a much lesser degree than in the general SS. A Waffen-SS was usually a recruit who had been processed into the SS (typically at a recruiting station) but had yet to report for basic training. Once basic training began, the was promoted to the rank of SS-&quot;Schütze&quot;.

Between 1942 and 1945, an even lower rank existed within the SS known as &quot;Bewerber&quot;. The SS was the only Nazi paramilitary group to have a rank lower than that of . The SS rank of used no insignia.

<doc id="1224463" wikidata="Q7287257" url="?curid=1224463" title="Ralph Borsodi">
<text>Ralph Borsodi (December 1888 – October 27, 1977) was an American agrarian theorist and practical experimenter interested in ways of living useful to the modern family desiring greater self-reliance (especially so during the Great Depression). Much of his theory related to living in rural surroundings on a modern homestead and was rooted in his Georgist beliefs.

==Life and work==
He spent the early years of his life in Manhattan. His father, William, was a publisher with connections in advertising, and Ralph worked in this business as a boy. By the age of 22, Borsodi was personally testing the idea of moving &quot;back to the land.&quot; He had fully embraced the concept of simple living by 1920. Borsodi was influenced by the reformer Bolton Hall (1854–1938), a friend of his father&#x27;s; Hall introduced Borsodi to the ideas of the economist Henry George. Borsodi was also influenced by Thomas Jefferson, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Josiah Warren, Lysander Spooner, Benjamin Tucker, and Laurance Labadie.

Borsodi is chiefly known for his practical experiments in self-sufficient living during the 1920s and 1930s and for the books he wrote about these experiments. &quot;The Distribution Age&quot; (1927), &quot;This Ugly Civilization&quot; (1929), and &quot;Flight from the City&quot; (1933) are his best known works. He established a School of Living in Rockland County, New York, during the winter of 1934–1935. Before long, about 20 families began attending regularly from New York City, spending the weekends at the school. Some commentators claim Borsodi&#x27;s books inspired &quot;hundreds of thousands of people&quot; to follow his example during the Great Depression.

Borsodi launched a community land trust in 1935 as a practical test of his ideas. He set up the non-profit Independence Foundation, Inc., with Chauncey Stillman and others, which acquired a tract of about 40 acres of land on Bayard Lane near Suffern, New York. The homes were owned individually, but the land cooperatively. A group interested in forming a similar community land trust at Stillwater in Ossining, New York, contacted Borsodi. The Stillwater project was unfortunately abandoned by the Independence Foundation in the early stages as unreasonably large, although it did develop along lines similar to Bayard Lane.

In 1937, Borsodi, with Herbert Agar and Chauncey Stillman, started a journal called &quot;Free America&quot;, which advocated local agrarian democracy. In 1948 Borsodi self-published (even doing his own typesetting) &quot;Education and Living&quot;, a two-volume work designed to suggest a curriculum for the ongoing School of Living. In 1950, Borsodi moved to the Town of Melbourne Village, whose founders had been influenced by his teachings. Mildred Loomis, his most devoted student, continued the work of the School of Living into the 1970s when it was headquartered at Heathcote Community in Freeland, Maryland.

With Bob Swann, Borsodi created a land trust that functioned as an economic, banking, and credit institution, probably influenced by the ideas of Josiah Warren. Called the Independence Foundation, Inc., Borsodi intended it as a new and ethical way of making low-cost, cooperatively shared credit available to people who wanted to build homesteads in the community. This institution made it possible to provide people access to land without having to pay outright for property initially.

Borsodi spent decades analyzing the ills of modern society and imagining remedies for the problems. His 1968 work, published in India, and titled &quot;Seventeen Universal Problems of Man and Society&quot;, cataloged his research and can be considered the beginning of a modern taxonomy of human problems and solutions. His followers felt he usually worked at solving issues for at least 20 years before most analysts realized the problem existed. For example, he predicted the inflation of the 1970s some thirty years before it came. One of his interests was in local currency, and he started an experiment with such a currency in his home area, Exeter, New Hampshire; however, the project came to an early end with Borsodi&#x27;s failing health. He created a commodity-backed bartering currency called the Constant, reminiscent of Josiah Warren&#x27;s &quot;labor notes&quot; at the Cincinnati Time Store. These appeared first as paper notes, but in 1974, coin-like pieces, called Globes, were minted and sold in 1/2 ounce and 1 ounce .999 silver denominations. The non-profit organization that sponsored them was the International Foundation for Independence, Inc., but the Globes were minted and sold by Arbitrage International.

Borsodi died in Exeter, New Hampshire in October 1977, survived by his wife Clare and two sons - Edward M. and Ralph W. - by his first wife Myrtle Mae Simpson.

==Influence==
Borsodi was cited as an important modern critic and creative thinker by Helen and Scott Nearing in such writings as &quot;Living the Good Life&quot;, a book sometimes credited as being the clarion call of the back-to-the-land movement of the 1970s. J.I. Rodale, who founded &quot;Organic Gardening and Farming&quot; magazine got his introduction to organic gardening at Borsodi&#x27;s Dogwood Acres Homestead, as did the Keene family, founders of Walnut Acres organic food catalog. Borsodi was also a significant influence on the American libertarian movement.

A number of Borsodi&#x27;s texts can be found in the Social Criticism section of the Soil and Health Online Library.

<doc id="1224471" wikidata="Q6327841" url="?curid=1224471" title="KDHX">
<text>KDHX (88.1 FM) is an independent, non-commercial, listener-supported community radio station in St. Louis, Missouri. It airs a radio format of adult album alternative (AAA) music, along with cultural and public affairs programming. It is owned by the Double Helix Corporation, with studios and offices on Washington Avenue in Grand Center. Fundraisers are held periodically on the air and on the station&#x27;s website.

KDHX is a Class C1 FM station. It has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 42,000 watts, broadcasting in FM stereo with RBDS data. The transmitter is on Fairfax Avenue in Arnold, Missouri.

==Programming==
The music heard on KDHX is primarily a roots-based AAA format. Other musical genres include blues, bluegrass, soul, folk, Americana, Latin, indie rock, world music, electronica and hip hop. Also heard are public affairs programs one evening a week and short-form features throughout the broadcast schedule. The on-air DJs are all volunteers chosen by an elected program committee and trained by station staff.

In addition to its on-air activities, KDHX Community Media previously produced a variety of music-oriented events such as Midwest Mayhem and Art Attack as well as collaborations with other community organizations. They included Harvest Sessions at the Tower Grove Farmers Market; Thursdays at the Intersection in Grand Center; the Sheldon Sessions with the Sheldon Concert Hall and SoundWaves with the Pulitzer Arts Foundation. Most of these events halted around 2015, largely due to the resignation of station management.

==History==
The station signed on the air on . At the time of KDHX&#x27;s founding, the frequency 88.1 MHz was occupied by 10-watt, Class D station KHRU-FM, operated by Clayton High School in Clayton, Missouri. It began broadcasting in 1968. KHRU-FM was on the air from 5 to 8 o&#x27;clock only on weeknights and only during the school year. The frequency was silent the rest of the week and all summer.

A public corporation, the Double Helix Foundation, was looking for a spot on the St. Louis FM dial to start a community radio station. Double Helix tried to work out a cooperative arrangement with the Clayton School District to share 88.1 FM, but the school district was unwilling to accept a frequency-sharing proposal. Eventually, Double Helix sued in federal court, resulting in a decision that broadcast stations had to &quot;use it or lose it&quot; with regard to frequencies. Stations licensed by the Federal Communications Commission are required to broadcast a minimum number of hours each week. After that decision, FCC revoked KHRU’s license and awarded the frequency to the Double Helix Corporation.

From that point, KDHX began broadcasting most hours of the day with non-commercial programs. A variety of musical genres and talk shows aired. Most of the staff were volunteers.

In 2023, over a dozen volunteer DJs were controversially dismissed by executive director Kelly Wells, citing various reasons. This decision resulted in protests by other volunteers, associate members, and listeners, with many longtime donors withdrawing their financial support to the station.

In February 2024, over 450 local and national musicians signed a letter demanding the resignation of station leadership. The letter stated &quot;We, the musicians of St. Louis (and beyond), say enough is enough . . .&quot; At that time, KDHX had lost nearly a third of its donors.

The 990 tax filing for the 2023 tax year stated that donations were $808,378, which is down from the $1,314,351 brought in before the allegations against Wells began.

Following the legal agreement that seated two new board members, both were suspended during their first board meeting. After this, and an analysis of financial records, a lawsuit was filed against the remaining members of the board for gross abuses of authority.

Amidst the ongoing issues with the current board, on January 31, 2025, KDHX laid off all volunteer staff and ceased live broadcasts.

==Double Helix Corporation==
Double Helix Corporation is a community media organization governed by a 15-member Board of Directors. It is a 501(c)3 non-profit arts and educational organization with a mission to create community through media. The Double Helix Corporation was formed after the demise of KDNA, a countercultural community-radio station that operated in St. Louis&#x27;s Gaslight Square district in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The corporation is independent of any governmental entity and is not affiliated with any religious or educational organization. The KDHX offices and studios are located at 3524 Washington Avenue in Grand Center. its tower is located in the northern part of Jefferson County.
The corporation is independent of any governmental entity, and is not affiliated with any religious or educational organization. Double Helix Corporation is the licensee of 88.1 KDHX, a community radio station in St. Louis, Missouri.

Prior to December 31, 2011, when statewide video franchise legislation sunsetted the city&#x27;s cable franchise ordinance, Double Helix Corporation managed the public and community access television stations for the City of St. Louis.

It has no major industry, as most residents work in Winnipeg or nearby communities. It has a bull test station (the only one in the Interlake Region) and an abandoned quarry.

The community&#x27;s origin can be traced to 1904, when Donald Gunn started a limestone quarry on the south side of the current community&#x27;s location. At one time when the quarry was operating it employed hundreds of people and the town had a population of approximately 3,000. 
In 1905, a post office with the name &quot;Gunview&quot; was opened, then name was changed to Gunton in 1906. The quarries closed during World War I, but the community remained as a farming community.

It was featured in the 1997 made-for-TV movie, &quot;Trucks&quot;.

<text>Sanborn maps are detailed maps of U.S. cities and towns in the 19th and 20th centuries. Originally published by The Sanborn Map Company (Sanborn), the maps were created to allow fire insurance companies to assess their total liability in urbanized areas of the United States. Since they contain detailed information about properties and individual buildings in approximately 12,000 U.S. cities and towns, Sanborn maps are valuable for documenting changes in the built environment of American cities over many decades.

Sanborn held a monopoly over fire insurance maps for the majority of the 20th century, but the business declined as US insurance companies stopped using maps for underwriting in the 1960s. The last Sanborn fire maps were published on microfilm in 1977, but old Sanborn maps remain useful for historical research into urban geography. The license for the maps was acquired by land data company Environmental Data Resources (EDR), and EDR was acquired in 2019 by real estate services company LightBox.

==Description==

The Sanborn maps themselves are large-scale lithographed street plans at a scale of 50 feet to one inch (1:600) on sheets of paper. The maps were published in volumes, bound and then updated until the subsequent volume was produced. Larger cities would be covered by multiple volumes of maps. Between editions of published volumes, map updates were sent out as correction slips. Sanborn employees, called &quot;pasters&quot; or &quot;correctors&quot;, would visit subscribers&#x27; offices to paste the slips on top of the old maps.

The map volumes contain an enormous amount of information. They are organized as follows: a decorative title page; an index of streets and addresses; a ‘specials’ index with the names of churches, schools, businesses etc.; and a master index indicating the entirety of the mapped area and the sheet numbers for each large-scale map (usually depicting four to six blocks); and general information such as population, economy and prevailing wind direction.

The maps include outlines of each building and outbuilding; the location of windows and doors; street names; street and sidewalk widths; property boundaries; fire walls; natural features (rivers, canals, etc.); railroad corridors; building use (sometimes even particular room uses); house and block number; as well as the composition of building materials including the framing, flooring, and roofing materials; the strength of the local fire department; indications of sprinkler systems; locations of fire hydrants; location of water and gas mains; and even the names of most public buildings, churches and businesses.

Unique information includes the location of the homes of prominent individuals, brothels, and more ephemeral buildings including outhouses and stables.

== Insurance underwriting ==

At the outset of the fire insurance industry, underwriters visited every property that was under consideration for coverage. As insurance companies increased their service areas, it was no longer practical to send people to every insurable property to assess the risk. The Sanborn maps allowed them to underwrite properties from the office, pooling the cost with other insurance companies that also subscribed to the maps. It was said that at one time, insurance companies and their agents “relied upon them with almost blind faith”.

The maps were utilized by insurance companies to determine the potential risk of a particular building, taking into account all of the information included on the map: building material, proximity to other buildings and fire departments, the location of gas lines, etc. The decision as to how much, if any, insurance would be offered to a customer was often determined solely through the use of a Sanborn map. The maps also allowed insurance companies to visualize their exposure in their coverage areas; when an agent sold a policy, he could color in the corresponding building on the map.

== History ==

In the late 18th century, insurance companies in London began to create detailed maps to give underwriters the information they needed to assess fire risk. The practice was adopted by American insurance companies in the mid-19th century. Demand for fire insurance mapping grew rapidly after the end of the Civil War. Factors such as the Homestead Act, railroad construction, the Second Industrial Revolution and massive immigration to the United States all fostered huge population growths, urbanization, and heightened demand for mapping.

Daniel Alfred Sanborn, a civil engineer and surveyor, began working on fire insurance maps in 1866. That year, he was contracted by the Aetna Insurance Company to prepare maps of areas in Tennessee. About the same time, he developed similar maps of Boston, published as &quot;Insurance Map of Boston,&quot; Volume 1, 1867. Seeing a lucrative market for this type of map, he established the D. A. Sanborn National Insurance Diagram Bureau in New York City to publish the Boston atlas and develop and sell maps of additional areas.

Within several decades, the company became the largest and most successful American map company. This growth came about through savvy management and the buyout of competing firms. In 1889 Sanborn acquired Perris and Browne, an older firm, and can by virtue of this expansion date its origins to 1852. The firm name established by Sanborn in 1867 was changed in 1876 when the firm was incorporated under the name Sanborn Map and Publishing Company, which then became the Sanborn-Perris Map Company, Ltd. until 1902, when the name was shortened to the Sanborn Map Company.

In 1916, Sanborn purchased its last major competitor, the E. Hexamer &amp; Sons of Philadelphia, and became a monopoly. Company headquarters moved to 629 Fifth Avenue in northern Pelham, New York, but there were also regional offices in San Francisco, Chicago, and Atlanta. The Sanborn Company sent out legions of surveyors to map building footprints in all major urbanized areas, along with building details related to fire risk. At its peak in the 1920s, the company employed about 700 people, including about 300 field surveyors and 400 cartographers, printers, managers, salesmen, and support staff. Areas under intensive development were surveyed every six months.

Sanborn&#x27;s monopoly was resented by some insurance companies for its high cost. The Underwriter&#x27;s Association of the Pacific complained that an &quot;Eastern monopoly&quot; was giving service that was &quot;very slow, expensive, and generally unsatisfactory.&quot; In the 1910s, the National Board of Fire Underwriters investigated the possibility of creating its own maps. However, many insurance companies opposed the proposal, citing the &quot;very large expenditure&quot; required and their satisfaction with Sanborn&#x27;s &quot;commendably satisfactory&quot; service. Instead, the NBFU Map Committee took an active role in Sanborn&#x27;s operations. In 1922, Sanborn agreed to add a member of the Map Committee to its Board of Directors, and a second seat was added by 1927. However, the onset of the Great Depression greatly curtailed construction activity in the United States. By 1936, Sanborn had reduced its publishing output from 60 to 20 volumes per year, a pace that would take over 50 years to update the entire map collection.

=== Decline of insurance business ===

In the 1950s, insurance companies began to use an alternative form of underwriting known as &quot;line carding&quot;. Line carding had been used for decades to underwrite properties that were not covered by fire maps. Each insured property was listed on a single card, and no map was kept. Corporate mergers also reduced the need for Sanborn Maps, since the consolidated company only needed to buy one set of maps. As insurance companies increased in size, they could withstand larger disasters and no longer needed to use insurance maps to reduce their concentration of risk. Companies also cited &quot;modern building construction, better building fire codes, and improved fire protection methods for the decline in importance of fire insurance maps.&quot;

From the late 1930s to the late 1950s, Sanborn&#x27;s annual profit fell from $500,000 to just $100,000. About thirty insurance companies accounted for most of the company&#x27;s sales. However, its monopoly over insurance mapping had allowed it to earn substantial profits over the decades. These profits were invested in a portfolio of stocks and bonds. By 1958, the stock was selling for $45 per share, but the investment portfolio was worth $65 per share. This attracted the attention of the young Warren Buffett, who pressured the company to distribute the investment portfolio to shareholders.

Buffett eventually purchased 23% of the company&#x27;s outstanding shares as an activist investor, representing 35% of his investment partnership&#x27;s total assets under management. Allied with other dissatisfied shareholders, Buffett could count on the votes of at least 44% of the shares in a proxy fight. The Board agreed to buy back shares from any shareholder at fair value, paying with a portion of its investment portfolio. 72% of the outstanding shares were turned in. In just two years, Buffett had secured a 50% return on his investment.

With the decline of its insurance business, Sanborn could no longer afford to maintain its army of surveyors. However, the company continued to sell its maps and perform some updates. Government sales began to play a larger role, especially the Census Bureau and municipal planning agencies. Sanborn printed its last catalog in 1950, created its last new map in 1961, and issued its last update in 1977.

In 1996, the license for the maps was acquired by land data company Environmental Data Resources (EDR). In 2019, EDR was acquired by real estate services company LightBox.

Over time, Sanborn diversified into other mapping activities, and as of 2020 is a geospatial specialist and holder of electronic GIS assets and systems, though the fire insurance business continues as a niche department. Corporate headquarters are in Colorado.

== Modern uses of fire insurance maps ==
Sanborn maps are found primarily in the archives and special collections of town halls and public and university libraries, and remain a resource for people in many different fields. The maps facilitate historical research through the study of urban growth and decline patterns, and for research into the evolution of specific buildings, sites and districts. Genealogists use the maps to locate the residences and workplaces of ancestors. Planners use the maps to study historic urban planning designs. Historic preservationists use the maps to understand the significance and historical evolution of buildings, including their historic uses and building materials in conservation and rehabilitation efforts. Demographers and urban geographers use them to study patterns of growth and migration of populations. Environmental scientists also use the maps for historical analysis of properties, as the maps often showed the locations of gas stations, drycleaners, and other potential sources of soil and groundwater contamination.

Historic Sanborn maps are available through public or university libraries, including the Library of Congress, and from the copyright owners, Environmental Data Resources (EDR), a division of LightBox.

<text>Angela Lisa Winbush (born January 18, 1955) is an American R&amp;B/soul singer-songwriter, musician and record producer who rose to fame first in the 1980s R&amp;B duo René &amp; Angela, also scoring hits as a solo artist. To date, Winbush has sold over 10 million albums and singles worldwide.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Angela began singing in church. She grew up in a middle-class area of St. Louis. Angela is a graduate of Northwest High School. She did not initially aspire to a career in music, instead studying architecture at Howard University, singing only to earn extra money. She continued to sing in church while at Howard as well as with gospel legend Richard Smallwood. She also performed as a singer with a group called &quot;Hot Tea&quot; while she attended Howard University. They opened for various well-known performers during shows and also did background singing for recording artists. One of the other members of &quot;Hot Tea&quot; was Tawatha Agee, who later did a lot of background singing on the albums of several well-noted recording artists, eventually joining the funk/soul band Mtume.

By 1977, Angela had changed her major to music education and recorded a demo. She shopped it to various record labels with no success but, through a personal introduction furnished by respected industry veteran, Wayne K. Garfield, the demo was heard by New York disc jockey Gary Byrd, who made the call that landed Angela a spot in Stevie Wonder&#x27;s backing vocal group, Wonderlove. Becoming Wonder&#x27;s protégé, she learned a great deal about writing and arranging songs.

While in Los Angeles with Wonder, Angela met singer Rene Moore. The two formed the duo René &amp; Angela later that year. They soon came to the realization that they could be successful as duo music writers and producers for others as well, and began pursuing that goal. René &amp; Angela released their self-titled debut album in 1980, followed by &quot;Wall to Wall&quot; in 1982 and &quot;Rise&quot; in 1983. During this period they scored two top 20 R&amp;B hit singles, &quot;I Love You More&quot; and &quot;My First Love.”

===&quot;A Street Called Desire&quot; and meeting Ronald Isley===
During Rene &amp; Angela&#x27;s early years, Moore and Winbush were asked to write and produce four songs for Janet Jackson&#x27;s 1982 self-titled debut album, &quot;Janet Jackson.&quot; One of the songs, &quot;Young Love,&quot; became Jackson&#x27;s first top ten U.S. R&amp;B hit reaching number six on the chart. They also had songs recorded by the likes of Rufus &amp; Chaka Khan, Lamont Dozier and Odyssey.

In 1985 they scored a U.S. number one hit with &quot;I Have Learned to Respect the Power of Love&quot; by Stephanie Mills, with whom Angela had forged a close friendship (an earlier version of the song had been recorded by Alton McClain &amp; Destiny). Having signed with Mercury Records, the duo released their breakthrough album, &quot;Street Called Desire&quot; the same year. Among the hit singles included on the album was their first R&amp;B number one with the dance single, &quot;Save Your Love (For #1),&quot; which included guest vocals from rapper Kurtis Blow, making it besides Chaka Khan&#x27;s &quot;I Feel For You,&quot; one of the first songs to prominently feature a rapper. Other hit singles included &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Good&quot;, the mostly Winbush-led &quot;Your Smile&quot; – another number one hit – and the subsequent &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Cry&quot; which hit number two in the beginning of 1986. Eventually &quot;Street Called Desire&quot; sold over a million copies, going platinum, but on the brink of their greatest success, tensions between Winbush and Moore had grown. After their split, Moore would continue to find success as a songwriter and producer, most notably for Michael Jackson.

In 1986, Winbush was introduced to Ronald Isley, lead singer of the influential Isley Brothers after Benny Medina had agreed to ask Winbush to be involved with the Isleys&#x27; next record when Isley proposed plans to work with Winbush on a future project. Producing, writing and arranging the Isleys&#x27; &quot;Smooth Sailin&#x27;&quot; album, Winbush helped the group, now featuring just Ronald and Rudolph (eldest brother O&#x27;Kelly had died the previous year), score a top 10 R&amp;B hit with the title track.

===&quot;Sharp&quot; and subsequent follow-ups===
In turn, Isley opted to manage Winbush and he helped in the process of releasing her debut solo album, &quot;Sharp,&quot; which was also released in 1987. The album included the hit, &quot;Angel&quot; which showcased Winbush&#x27;s four-octave range. The song reached the No. 1 R&amp;B position for two weeks in 1987. Other notable hits include the dance track, &quot;Run to Me,&quot; &quot;C&#x27;est Toi (It&#x27;s You)&quot; and the Ron Isley duet, &quot;Hello Beloved.&quot; The album spent 28 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart and 51 weeks on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

In 1988, she wrote and produced two tracks for Sheena Easton&#x27;s gold album &quot;The Lover in Me&quot; – &quot;Without You&quot; and &quot;Fire and Rain,&quot; both of which showcased Easton&#x27;s lower range and soulful vocals. In 1989, Winbush released her second solo album &quot;The Real Thing.&quot; The title track &quot;It&#x27;s The Real Thing&quot; reached number two on the R&amp;B chart while subsequent hits &quot;No More Tears&quot; and &quot;Lay Your Troubles Down&quot; continued Winbush&#x27;s top 40 success on the R&amp;B charts where she was now a fixture on despite failed attempts to cross her over to pop audiences. The album also included her version of &quot;I Have Learned to Respect the Power of Love&quot;). The same year, Winbush wrote and produced another U.S. R&amp;B number one for Stephanie Mills with &quot;Something in the Way (You Make Me Feel)&quot; for Mill&#x27;s album &quot;Home&quot;, as well as the album cut &quot;So Good, So Right&quot; (previously recorded by D&#x27;atra Hicks).

In 1989, Winbush oversaw all songwriting and production on The Isley Brothers&#x27; 25th album &quot;Spend the Night&quot; including the U.S. R&amp;B number three hit &quot;Spend the Night (Ce Soir)&quot;. The following year, she scored more top 20 R&amp;B hits as a writer/producer for R&amp;B girl group Body (&quot;Footsteps in the Dark&quot;) and newcomer Lalah Hathaway (&quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;) as well as contributing cuts to their respective albums. In 1992, Winbush co-wrote and co-produced with longtime manager/collaborator/lover Ronald Isley another album for The Isley Brothers, &quot;Tracks of Life&quot;, featuring the R&amp;B hit &quot;Sensitive Lover&quot;.

On June 26, 1993, Winbush and Isley, 13 years Angela&#x27;s senior, married. A year later, Winbush released her third self-titled solo album, which included the R&amp;B hit, &quot;Treat U Rite.&quot; Produced by Chuckii Booker, the song peaked at number six on the R&amp;B chart making it Winbush&#x27;s ninth top ten R&amp;B hit altogether in her career. In 1996, Winbush produced the bulk of The Isley Brothers&#x27; &quot;Mission to Please&quot; album, which included the hit &quot;Floatin&#x27; on Your Love,&quot; a duet between Angela and Ron Isley. The song was later remixed by Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs and featured guest vocals from Lil&#x27; Kim and the group 112 in backgrounds. The video for it showcased Winbush serenading Isley&#x27;s Mr. Biggs character. While married to Isley, the two had a daughter together named Tawanna Isley, about whom not much is known. Winbush continued to collaborate with the Isley Brothers until 2001&#x27;s &quot;Eternal&quot; with Angela notably only contributing to 3 tracks as their marriage began to cool off. In 2002, Winbush and Isley quietly divorced. In 2003, Winbush made news when it was found out she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Eventually after a successful surgery, the cancer was in remission and Winbush returned to perform on the road.

===Legacy and influence===
Since starting out with Rene &amp; Angela, Winbush and Moore have played an influence on various R&amp;B and hip-hop acts. In the latter genre, their music has been sampled by acts such as The Notorious B.I.G. (who featured her and Jay-Z on his Rene &amp; Angela-sampled &quot;I Love You More&quot; for the song &quot;I Love the Dough&quot;), Foxy Brown (who sampled her &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Good&quot; for her 1997 top ten hit, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be,&quot; Rapper Sylk-E. Fyne&#x27;s 1998 hit &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; that samples Rene and Angela&#x27;s &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Cry,&quot; and last but not least singer Avant re-recorded the Rene &amp; Angela ballad, &quot;My First Love,&quot; with singer Keke Wyatt in 2000. In appreciation during Avant&#x27;s performance of the song on BET&#x27;s &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot;, in 2001, Winbush surprised the audience by singing alongside Avant on the song. As a singer, Winbush is well noted by her gospel-influenced musical humming during her songs. She has influenced the likes of Syleena Johnson and Chante Moore. Winbush and former partner Rene Moore also shared the distinction for being one of the first R&amp;B acts to prominently feature a rap act in a R&amp;B song sharing that distinction with Jody Watley, Chaka Khan and funk band Cameo. Winbush also carries the distinction of being one of the few female artists to find success as a songwriter, arranger, producer and session musician (Winbush also is an avid musician playing piano and keyboards).

===Personal life===
During a 2006 interview on the Christian TV show, Gospel of Music with Jeff Majors, Winbush disclosed that she had overcome Stage 3 ovarian cancer after six months of chemotherapy in 2003. During the interview she revealed that her undying faith in God got her through having a cyst (benign) removed from her breast, the ending of her marriage to Isley in divorce, and her struggle with depression.

==TV appearances==
After years of absence from mainstream TV, in March 2010, Winbush performed &quot;Angel&quot;, live on the late night talk show &quot;The Mo&#x27;Nique Show&quot;. She was also featured on the TV One documentary &quot;Unsung&quot;, which first aired in October 2010. It was revealed that Rene Moore became violent with Winbush, in latter years, which led Winbush to cease her musical journey with Moore because she was no longer interested in being a member of &quot;Rene &amp; Angela.&quot; Moore declined to be interviewed for &quot;Unsung.&quot;

<doc id="1224499" wikidata="Q489308" url="?curid=1224499" title="Hankook Ilbo">
<text>Hankook Ilbo () is a Korean-language daily newspaper in Seoul, South Korea. As of 2017, it had a daily circulation of about 213,200.

It was previously published by the Hankook Ilbo Media Group, however following an embezzlement scandal in 2013–2014 it was sold to Dongwha Enterprise, which also owns &quot;The Korea Times&quot;.

==Political position==
&quot;Hankook Ilbo&quot; tends to be economically centre-right and socially centre-left. &quot;Hankook Ilbo&quot; is a &quot;liberal&quot; media, but this is different from the meaning of &quot;liberal&quot; in the American political context.

&quot;Hankook Ilbo&quot; officially doesn&#x27;t put forward ideology other than &quot;centrism&quot;. However, &quot;Hankook Ilbo&quot; has basically shown a fiscal conservative tone that values &quot;fiscal responsibility&quot;. The newspaper has often criticized the Moon Jae-in government&#x27;s fiscal policy for its lack of awareness of &quot;financial soundness&quot; (). This newspaper also supports &quot;liberal economy&quot;.

In contrast to the somewhat conservative tendency financially, the &quot;Hankook Ilbo&quot; has some cultural liberal tendency. The newspaper supported LGBT and other minority rights and emphasized &quot;diversity&quot;. &quot;Hankook Ilbo&quot; has criticized the hatred of obesity in Korean society. In addition, the &quot;Hankook Ilbo&quot; has a favorable view of feminism.

<doc id="1224501" wikidata="Q375765" url="?curid=1224501" title="List of minerals recognized by the International Mineralogical Association">
<text>Mineralogy is an active science in which minerals are discovered or recognised on a regular basis. Use of old mineral names is also discontinued, for example when a name is no longer considered valid. Therefore, a list of recognised mineral species is never complete. 

Minerals are distinguished by various chemical and physical properties. Differences in chemical composition and crystal structure distinguish the various &quot;species&quot;. Within a mineral species there may be variation in physical properties or minor amounts of impurities that are recognized by mineralogists or wider society as a mineral &quot;variety&quot;.

The International Mineralogical Association (IMA) is the international scientific group that recognises new minerals and new mineral names. However, minerals discovered before 1959 did not go through the official naming procedure. Some minerals published previously have been either confirmed or discredited since that date. This list contains a mixture of mineral names that have been approved since 1959 and those mineral names believed to still refer to valid mineral species (these are called &quot;grandfathered&quot; species). Presently, each year about 90–110 new mineral species (the sum of all mutations c. 120 per year) are officially approved by the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification (CNMNC) of the International Mineralogical Association.

, the IMA - CNMNC &quot;List of Minerals&quot; lists 6,118 valid minerals, including 1,153 pre-IMA minerals (grandfathered), and 97 questionable minerals. Also , the Mineralogical Society of America&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of Mineralogy&quot; lists 5,663 species, and the IMA Database of Mineral Properties/RRUFF Project lists 6,006 valid species (IMA/CNMNC) of a total of 6,237 minerals. The IMA/RRUFF database includes 1,164 pre-IMA minerals.

Due to the length of this list, it is divided into alphabetical groups. The minerals are sorted by name.

***ch – incomplete description, hypothetical solid solution end member. Published without approval and formally discredited or not approved, yet.
**** Mainly: pyrochlore, tourmaline and amphibole supergroups, arrojadite, and yftisite-(Y). IMA/CNMNC revisions generate hypothetical solid solution endmembers.
**group – a name used to designate a group of species, sometimes only a mineral group name.

== Working practices ==

* The name of a new mineral is kept confidential by the IMA until it is approved or until its full description is published, its authors&#x27; option (approved decision: &#x27;IMA2009-D&#x27;). The IMA uses a code for its own procedures for the supposed new mineral (and so it is a synonym). Ferri-ottoliniite&#x27;s proposal was assigned code &#x27;IMA2001-067&#x27;, it was redefined and approved as &#x27;IMA2001-067a&#x27; in 2003, for instance (the ottoliniite root name is discredited since 2012).
* Current IMA regulations do not allow substances of anthropogenic origin (burning coal mine dumps, coal mine fires, slag, etc.) to be validated as a mineral species. Since 1998, the majority of polymorphs (especially polytypes and polytypoids) are not regarded as separate mineral species anymore.
* IMA/CNMNC identifiers are usually written without space, as years don&#x27;t get meaningful hits on Google search.
* &quot;The System of Mineralogy of James Dwight Dana and Edward Salisbury Dana&quot; (8 ed.) was the reference of CNMNC/CNMMN&#x27;s (IMA) initial work. At the Kobe 2006 general meeting, the IMA council endorsed the creation of an Internet site on minerals (&#x27;rruff.info/ima&#x27;). So a Master List was needed and the older minerals were reviewed in a document of 130 pages. The final GQN List was published (grandfathered, questionable and published without approval) after a final review of Burke E A J and Nickel E H (approved decision: &#x27;IMA2006-C&#x27;). Not only the well established minerals before 1959 was grandfathered (G), but the minerals that could not be discredited as well. The merging of the &#x27;ARD List&#x27; (approved, revalidated and discredited) with the &#x27;GQN List&#x27; resulted in the first &#x27;IMA/CNMNC List of Mineral Names&#x27;. The 2007 draft of the &#x27;IMA/CNMNC List of Mineral Names&#x27; was a courtesy of the Materials Data, Inc. (MDI), its 2009 review had important modifications. The RRUFF database was built with the help of the MDI&#x27;s 2007 draft, the IMA Master List is an update of the MDI&#x27;s 2009 review. Some grandfathered minerals had their status changed to approved afterwards, based on IMA approved reports. The list of approved minerals was revised with &#x27;The New IMA List of Minerals (September 2012)&#x27;.
* The IMA was founded in a meeting in Madrid (1958). The CNMMN (now CNMNC) was one of the original eight commissions, it was founded in 1959. Not all grandfathered mineral were first described prior to 1959. Hatrurite, a phase in cement clinker (alite, C3S), was first described in 1977, for instance.
* Some mineral names were revised; this changed their first letters. Sodium-pharmacosiderite is now natropharmacosiderite, natroapophyllite is now fluorapophyllite-(Na), for instance. But 2010, hydroxylapatite, fluorapatite, fluorellestadite and chlorapatite had their old names reinstated.
*Progress in earth sciences, geology, mineralogy can be slow:
** Some IMA/CNMNC (1959–2000) approved minerals had their complete description published only 2012: &#x27;IMA1998-018&#x27; (fluornatromicrolite, published 2011), &#x27;IMA1987-046a&#x27; (ferrolaueite, published 2012), &#x27;IMA1978-064&#x27; (approval probably based on fake data), &#x27;IMA1977-006&#x27; (whelanite, published 2012) and &#x27;IMA1968-003&#x27; (discredited, &#x27;IMA2008-B&#x27;). &#x27;IMA1995-025&#x27; was listed as well, a mistake (natroglaucocerinite, published 1995).
** The paper of Armbruster et al. (2006) misunderstood the naming rules and renamed a well established mineral name (hancockite). Hatert et al. (2013) modified the naming rules. and proposal IMA2015 s.p. was accepted, reverting the renaming.
** Sample: bergenite was discredited as a barium bearing mineral variety of phosphuranylite (IMA1962 s.p., special procedure). So phosphuranylite was already a valid mineral, and it is listed in the Michael Fleischer&#x27;s mineral list (1966). Both are listed as grandfathered minerals as they are not listed in the &#x27;ARD List&#x27; (approved, revalidated and discredited minerals; 2004).
** The review and approval of new mineral is straight forward most of the time, but there are exceptions. Proposal IMA2009-096 was not accepted, proposal IMA2009-096a was approved as fontarnauite (6.DA.60) in 2014. Proposal IMA1995-020 was not accepted, proposal IMA1995-020c was approved as jarandolite (6.CB.25).
** Some valid names get discredited (in the broader sense).
*** Tohdite (hydrous alumina) was conditionally approved as &#x27;IMA2004-051&#x27;. But the re-examination of the holotype material of akdalaite ((Al2O3)5·H2O, &#x27;IMA1969-002&#x27;) from the Fersman Mineralogical Museum in Moscow showed that both minerals were identical (space group was corrected).
*** Tellurocanfieldite was conditionally approved as &#x27;IMA2012-013&#x27;. Its approval was withdrawn as further studies showed it to be a Te-rich variety of canfieldite (Y: 1894, 2.BA.70).
* Some old minerals were known before their 20th century names were first published.

== Miscellany ==
* Current regulations do not allow a new mineral name to honour a person a second time. But there are exceptions: Jöns Jakob Berzelius (1779–1848) (berzelianite, berzeliite and berzeline (now haüyne)); Pierre Berthier (1782–1861) (berthierine and berthierite); Andor von Semsey (1833–1923) (andorite IV, andorite VI and semseyite); Brian Harold Mason (1917–2009) (brianite and stenhuggarite); Caleb Wroe Wolfe (1908–1980) (wolfeite and wroewolfeite) and Leo Neal Yedlin (1908–1977) (yedlinite and nealite). The regulation does not affect mineral series and other variations (prefix iso, hexa, ortho, tetra, clino, meta, para, pseudo etc.). For instance: Karl Hugo Strunz (1910–2006) (strunzite group); George P. Merrill (1854–1929) (merrillite series, whitlockite group); Edward S. Grew (Ph.D. 1971) (edgrewite series, humite group).
*Standard temperature and pressure (STP).
** Silicate perovskites, argentite and β-quartz are not valid minerals, as they do not occur on Earth&#x27;s surface (STP). The type material of bridgmanite is from a meteorite. Some minerals are unstable on Earth&#x27;s surface (metastability): diamonds, cohenite and haxonite, for instance. Acanthite var. argentite (a pseudomorph after argentite) and β-quartz pseudomorphs are sometimes sold. 
**Ramdohr (1936) discovered that the type material of schapbachite (Ag0.4Pb0.2Bi0.4S) was a mixture of galena (PbS) and matildite (AgBiS2). It was discredited (1982) as it was found unstable at &#x27;standard temperature and pressure&#x27; (STP). It was revalidated (2004) as Pb-bearing schabachite is stable at STP. The type locality is not Schapbach now, but Silberbrünnle mine, Gengenbach; both Black Forest localities.
**Epsilon iron, hexagonal close-packed (HCP) phase of iron is stable only at extremely high pressure. It can be found as a mineral (chemical formula: ).
* It is not only schapbachite that had a longer controversy. Other minerals have a complicated history, as well.
** Imogolite, 9.ED.20, was first published 1962. Its formal discreditation by the IMA was published 1967, as its description was incomplete. The IMA referred it to the AIPEA (&quot;Association Internationale Pour l&#x27;Étude des Argiles&quot;) for advice and it was approved by the AIPEA (Nomenclature Committee) at its Tokyo meeting (1970). Fleischer (1983) described it as a variety of allophane and it was finally redefined and approved by the IMA/CNMNC 1986. 
*** Amorphous allophane, nanotube-like imogolite (), halloysite-10Å (), halloysite-7Å () and gibbsite () are thought to be products of tuff weathering.
** Betalommosovite was described by Gerasimovskiy and Kazakova (1962) and discredited by the IMA-CNMMN (IMA1967 s.p.). It was published without approval and listed as discredited on the &#x27;IMA/CNMNC List of Mineral Names&#x27; (2009). Later, betalomonosovite was revalidated (IMA2014-J).
** Jichengite as xinghuaite (IMA1984-047) was rejected by the IMA-CNMMN. Jichengite (IMA1994-039) was rejected by the IMA-CNMMN, as well. Unfortunately, it was published without approval in 2011.
**UM1991-//-COF:BaCaCe (IMA1989-012), a calcium analogue of cordylite-(Ce) from Bayan Obo mine, had the approval procedure suspended by Joseph A. Mandarino, because of the cerium dominant cordylite (IMA2000-C).
*Other curiosities:
**Niggliite (former 1.AG.60, year: 1938), sorosite (former 1.AC.15, IMA1994-047), yuanjiangite (former 1.AC.15, IMA1993-028) are not classified as tin alloys (PGE-metal alloys and indium-tin family) in &quot;Fleischer&#x27;s Glossary&quot;. But, they are stannide minerals (nickeline mineral group), sulfide mineral class there.
**Tiragalloite (9.BJ.25, IMA1969-061, ), is an arsenosilicate and grenmarite (9.BE.25, IMA2003-024, ) is a zirconium silicate (analogous to the more common aluminosilicates, borosilicates and titanium silicates).
**Mostly anthropogenic minerals: abhurite (3.DA.30), lausenite (7.CB.70), guildite (7.DC.30), hoelite (10.CA.15), calclacite (10.AA.25).
**Studtite (4.GA.15, year: 1947) is the first peroxide mineral, the facies radioactivity generate peroxide.
**Ianthinite (4.GA.10, year: 1926), U(IV) is one of the constituents of the mineral), it gets a layer of schoepite/ metaschoepite in the presence of oxygen.
**Polyoxometalates:
***Menezesite (4.FN.05, IMA2005-023) and aspedamite (IMA2011-056), are the only natural heteropolyniobates known.
***Ophirite (IMA2013-017) is a mineral with a heteropolytungstate tri-lacunary keggin anion.
***Melcherite (IMA2015-018) and peterandresenite (IMA2012-084) have a lindqvist anion.
**Inosilicate, biopyriboles:
***Jimthompsonite (IMA1977-011) is a triple chain inosilicate.
***Chesterite (IMA1977-010) is a connected double chain inosilicate.
**Inosilicate, double dreier chains:
***Xonotlite (Y: 1866) is an inosilicate with double dreier chains.
***Chivruaiite (IMA2004-052) is an inosilicate double dreier chains of (SiO4) tetrahedra.
***Zorite (IMA1972-011) is an inosilicate double dreier chains of (SiO4) tetrahedra.
***Haineaultite (IMA1997-015) is an inosilicate double dreier chains of (SiO4) tetrahedra.
**Other inosilicates:
***Veblenite (IMA2010-050) has a veblenite ribbon (Si8O22).
***Yangite (IMA2012-052) is an inosilicate with two-connected double chain.
***Yegorovite (IMA2008-033) is an inosilicate with single zig-zag chains of Si tetrahedra.
**Icosahedrite (IMA2010-042), the only natural quasicrystal known.
**Comancheite (IMA2013-B/ IMA1980-077, former 3.DD.65) is a mercury nitride mineral now.
**α-Sulfur (old); chemical formula unit with 1 atom; unit cell with 128 formula units (Z).
**Whitecapsite (IMA2012-030), chemical formula: H16Fe2+5Fe3+14Sb3+6(AsO4)18O16·120H2O; unit cell with 1 formula unit (Z).
**Megacyclite (9.CP.10, IMA1991-015); chemical formula unit with 111 atoms; unit cell with 4 formula units (Z).

**Ashcroftine-(Y) (9.DN.15, year: 1933); chemical formula unit with 180 atoms; unit cell with 4 formula units (Z).

== Notes ==
* Attention with the amphiboles: some mineral names have been redefined (IMA2012 s.p. was the last revision), some even more than once; i.e. their chemical formula range changed. For example, aluminotaramite (&#x27;IMA2006-023&#x27;, 9.DE.20) is a synonym of ferro-taramite, sodic-ferri-ferropedrizite (IMA2003 s.p., 9.DE.25) was renamed to ferro-ferri-pedrizite, ehimeite is a synonym of chromio-pargasite (&#x27;IMA2011-023&#x27;, 9.DE.15), kôzulite is a synonym of mangano-arfvedsonite (&#x27;IMA1968-028&#x27;, 9.DE.25) and kornite is a synonym of potassic-mangani-leakeite (&#x27;IMA1992-032&#x27;, 9.DE.25).
*Some IMA-CNMNC approved minerals have a questionable status on mineralienatlas.de, but their unit cell parameters are given on mindat.org (or vice versa). Their status here doesn&#x27;t change, it remains &#x27;approved mineral&#x27;.
*The mineral systematic given on Nickel-Strunz (9 and 10 ed) is not controversial. Dmisteinbergite (feldspar, 9.EG.15), uranyl sorovanadates (4.HD. ids) and silica family (4.DA. ids) are some exceptions, for instance.
* Great care must be taken with definitions and their redefinitions. There is a difference between rocks, natural minerals and chemical compounds. Some examples: rocksalt (a redirect), halite and sodium chloride; kaolin earth (a redirect) and kaolinite; apatite, strict sense (chlorapatite, fluorapatite and hydroxylapatite), apatite group and apatite supergroup; kaolinite-serpentine group (alias serpentine), serpentine subgroup, serpentinization and serpentinite; olivine structural group (after rruff.nfo/ima); olivine group and olivine (a fosterite var.); spessartine (a garnet) and spessartite (a lamprophyre); iron (element), telluric iron (alias native iron) and meteoric iron; phyllosilicate minerals (alias sheet silicates) and clays; pyrochlore (invalid mineral name since 2010), pyrochlore group and pyrochlore supergroup; antimony and stibnite (alias antimonite); etc.
* The data of a mineral on the databases is similar but not equal. For instance:
** Opal is a valid IMA/CNMNC name but it is a mineraloid (a mixture of cristobalite and/or tridymite and amorphous silica), it has a page on Mindat.org and Webmineral.com but not on the Handbook of Mineralogy.
*** Ice, mercury (low melting point); allophane, delvauxite, hisingerite (amorphous/ poorly crystalline); actinolite, augite, omphacite, sanidine (intermediate member of a solid solution series) are IMA/CNMNC valid names too. The reasons can be inherited pre-IMA status, practical reasons or entrenchment in the literature, including medical and legal usage.
** OligoclaseI is an albite variety on Mindat.org and it has pages on the Handbook of Minerals and Webmineral.com, see &#x27;List of minerals (synonyms)&#x27; (plagioclase/albite-anorthite series). It is not the only intermediate member of a solid solution series with a page on the Handbook of Mineralogy (mineral varieties).
** The Handbook of Mineralogy has pages on clinochrysotile, orthochrysotile and parachrysotile, but not on chrysotile; but they are polytypes of chrysotile, see &#x27;List of minerals (synonyms)&#x27;.
** Mindat.org uses to give the chemical formula of some minerals as a range (between parentheses, if tin dominant then herzenbergite: ; otherwise teallite: (), on the other side the IMA Database of Mineral Properties/ Rruff Project uses to give the ideal chemical formula of the solid solution end member (herzenbergite: SnS). 
***The given chemical names are a compromise for information purposes, being based on the Nickel-Strunz code too. Most of the time the chemical formula on rruff.info was used, sometimes the simpler one on mindat.org. To illustrate it: bartonite, (mindat.org), (rruff.info); bayleyite, (mindat.org), (rruff.info) and bredigite, (mindat.org), (rruff.info).
***Caution with the chemical formula units of silicates and their &quot;formula masses&quot;. Some molecules have a repeating unit, these might be chains, networks, polymers, and so the true molecule might be a multiple of the smallest repeating unit (the unit cell of a crystal is formed by repeating &#x27;Z&#x27; times the chemical formula). Examples: wadsleyite () a sorosilicate and high pressure polymorph of forsterite and ringwoodite; leucophanite (), but it has Nickel-Strunz identifier 9.DH.05 (inosilicates with 4-periodic single chains, ); clinoenstatite (), but it has Nickel-Strunz identifier 9.DA.10 (inosilicates with 2-periodic single chains, ); scolecite (), but it has Nickel-Strunz identifier 9.GA.05 (zeolites with units – the fibrous zeolites); mogánite (), but it has Nickel-Strunz identifier 4.DA.20 (oxides with small cations: silica family).
*The existence in nature of some questionable/ doubtful minerals is very unlikely at all or at the type locality. For example, chloromagnesiteQ (Y: 1872, MgCl2) 3.AB.20 and zinkositeQ (Y: 1852, ZnSO4) 7.AB.10.
*Some names are not names of minerals anymore, but names of a group of minerals:
**Micas, biotite group.
***The IMA/CNMMN, Subcommittee on Nomenclature of the Micas (1998, 1999) has recommended that the name biotite be used for a series including phlogopite, siderophyllite, annite and eastonite.
**Zeolites: chabazite group,; dachiardite group,; heulandite group.
** Pyrochlore supergroup:
*** The pyrochlore supergroup was revised in 2010. The update of the databases isn&#x27;t complete, yet.
***Groups: pyrochlore,; roméite,; betafite,; microlite,; elsmoreite.

<text>Happy Go Licky was an American post-hardcore band formed in the spring of 1987, and which broke up after their final show at Washington, D.C.&#x27;s 9:30 Club on New Year&#x27;s Day in 1988. The group was a short-lived reunion of the renowned D.C. hardcore band Rites of Spring (active from 1984 to 1986).

Though comprising the same personnel as Rites of Spring (Eddie Janney and Guy Picciotto on guitar and vocals; Mike Fellows on bass and vocals; Brendan Canty on drums), their music was vastly different from their earlier incarnation. Happy Go Licky was far more experimental, often incorporating tape loops and sound effects into their live performances; additionally, their songs were often largely or entirely improvised, and featured unusual structures.

Their short life span did not allow Happy Go Licky to ever get into a recording studio; however some taped live performances were initially released in 1988 as a self-titled 12-inch on Picciotto&#x27;s own Peterbilt Records. Later a larger selection of their performances was assembled and released on Dischord Records as &quot;Will Play&quot; (1997).

<text>John Cullum (born March 2, 1930) is an American actor and singer. He has appeared in many stage musicals and dramas, including &quot;Shenandoah&quot; (1975) and &quot;On the Twentieth Century&quot; (1978), winning the Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical for each. In 1966 he gained his first Tony nomination as the lead in &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot;, in which he introduced the title song, and more recently received Tony nominations for &quot;Urinetown The Musical&quot; (2002) (Best Actor in a Musical) and as Best Featured Actor in the revival of &quot;110 in the Shade&quot; (2007).

Outside of the theatre world, Cullum is best known for his role as tavern owner Holling Vincoeur in the television drama series &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama. He was featured in fifteen episodes of the NBC television series &quot;ER&quot; as Dr. Mark Greene&#x27;s father. He played farmer Jim Dahlberg in the landmark television drama &quot;The Day After&quot;. He made multiple guest appearances on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; as attorney/judge Barry Moredock, and appeared as Big Mike in several episodes of &quot;The Middle&quot;. He appeared as Senator Beau Carpenter on the CBS series &quot;Madam Secretary&quot;.

==Personal life==
Cullum was born on March 2, 1930, in Knoxville, Tennessee. He attended Knoxville High School and the University of Tennessee. He played on the university&#x27;s Southeastern Conference championship tennis team and was a member of Phi Gamma Delta. He starred in &quot;Chucky Jack&quot;, an outdoor drama about Tennessee Governor John Sevier, at the old Hunter Hills Theater in Gatlinburg.

Cullum was married to Emily Frankel from 1959 until her death in 2024. They have one son, JD Cullum (John David Cullum), who is also an actor.

==Career==
He made his Broadway debut as Sir Dinadan in the Alan Jay Lerner/Frederick Loewe musical &quot;Camelot&quot; in 1960. He also understudied Richard Burton (King Arthur) and Roddy McDowall (Arthur&#x27;s son Mordred), going on four times when Burton became ill and succeeding McDowall. He went on to play Laertes opposite Burton&#x27;s 1964 Broadway performance as Hamlet (and in the film version of the production) and in Burton&#x27;s final Broadway appearance in Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Private Lives&quot; in 1983.

In 1965, he was called in to replace Louis Jourdan during the Boston tryout of the musical &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever.&quot; It was his first starring role on Broadway, netting him a Theatre World Award and his first Tony Award nomination. The original cast album received a Grammy Award (presented to lyricist Alan Jay Lerner and composer Burton Lane).

He portrayed Edward Rutledge of South Carolina in the Broadway musical &quot;1776&quot;, providing a dramatic highlight with his performance of &quot;Molasses to Rum,&quot; a tirade against the hypocrisy of some Northerners over the slave trade (&quot;They don&#x27;t keep slaves, but they are willing to be considerable carriers of slaves to others. They&#x27;re willing – for the shilling.&quot;) Cullum had been the third Rutledge on Broadway, but played the role the longest and repeated it for the 1972 film.

He is well known for premiering the role of Charlie Anderson in the musical &quot;Shenandoah,&quot; which began at Goodspeed Opera House, Connecticut in 1974. Cullum won the Tony, Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle Awards when the show was produced on Broadway in 1975. He also played the role at Wolf Trap, Virginia, in June 1976, opened the national tour for 3 weeks in Fall 1977 in Chicago, and starred in the limited run Broadway revival in 1989.

He followed &quot;Shenandoah&quot; by playing the maniacal Broadway producer Oscar Jaffee in the 1978 musical &quot;On the Twentieth Century&quot;, opposite Madeline Kahn and later Judy Kaye, earning his second Tony Award. He received his fourth Tony nomination in 2002 for originating the role of evil moneygrubber corporate president Caldwell B. Cladwell in &quot;Urinetown The Musical&quot;. He earned his fifth Tony nomination in the 2007 revival of &quot;110 in the Shade&quot;, playing H.C. Curry, father to Audra McDonald&#x27;s Lizzie.

In 2003, Cullum co-starred with &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; castmate Barry Corbin in &quot;Blackwater Elegy&quot;, a short film written by Matthew Porter and co-directed by Porter and Joe O&#x27;Brien.

Later Broadway appearances include the title role of William Shakespeare&#x27;s seldom-performed &quot;Cymbeline,&quot; at Lincoln Center in 2007 and &quot;&quot;, by Tracy Letts for the week of September 16, 2008, and then since November 11, 2008.

In addition to enjoying a long stage career, he is well known to television audiences for his regular role as Holling Vincoeur on the quirky CBS series &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, his extended appearances on the NBC medical drama &quot;ER&quot; as Mark Greene&#x27;s father, and on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; as constitutional lawyer and later judge, Barry Moredock. Cullum has also appeared as Lucky Strike executive Lee Garner, Sr. on AMC&#x27;s &quot;Mad Men&quot;. He appeared as Leap Day William, the embodiment of the fictional Leap Day national holiday, in the &quot;Leap Day&quot; episode of the sixth season of NBC&#x27;s &quot;30 Rock&quot;.

John Cullum appeared on Broadway in &quot;The Scottsboro Boys&quot; (2010), a musical by Kander and Ebb about a notorious miscarriage of justice in the American South in the 1930s. &quot;The Scottsboro Boys&quot; was directed by Susan Stroman, with Cullum as the only non-African-American member of the cast.

John Cullum was inducted into the Theatre Hall of Fame in 2007.

In 2015 Cullum appeared and sang in the satirical B&amp;W period movie-musical footage of &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Boy&quot; on &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot;. The &quot;forgotten footage&quot; features comically incestuous lyrics set in an innocent context that apes classic 1930&#x27;s films.

Cullum, then an octogenarian, joined the cast of &quot;Waitress&quot; as Joe on October 12, 2017, replacing Larry Marshall.

<text>Longthorpe is an area of the city of Peterborough, in the ceremonial county of Cambridgeshire, England. Located west from the city centre, the area covers . For electoral purposes it forms part of Peterborough West ward.

A 1st century Roman fort was established at Longthorpe, it may have been as early as around AD 44–48 but was certainly present by 61–62. The first phase covered , this was later replaced by another fort measuring .

The ecclesiastical parish was formed in 1850 from the parish of Saint John the Baptist. The church of Saint Botolph is a plain building of coarse rubble, dating from the 13th century, consisting of chancel, nave, aisles and a western bell cote, containing one bell. In the chancel is a piscina and aumbry, two other brackets and a piscina are in the south aisle and two brackets in the north aisle. The church was restored in 1869 and will seat about 200 persons. The register dates from the year 1837; the earlier register is included in that of St. John the Baptist, Peterborough. Objections to controversial works were raised by the Victorian Society, Historic England and the Twentieth Century Society in 2017.

Oliver St John, a Lord Chief Justice who supported Parliament in the English Civil War, bought the lease of the manor of Longthorpe and built Thorpe Hall. In 1654 it was described by the author John Evelyn as &quot;a stately place...built out of the ruins of the Bishop&#x27;s Palace and cloisters.&quot; It is a Grade I listed building, situated in a Grade II listed garden open to members of the public throughout the year.

Longthorpe Tower, a 14th-century, three-storey tower and fortified manor house in the care of English Heritage, is also situated here. A Grade I listed building and scheduled ancient monument protected by law, it contains the finest and most complete set of domestic paintings of the period in northern Europe. Exhibitions are held there from time to time by local artists.

Longthorpe contains a number of other listed buildings, including the old Manor House and the Holy (or St. Cloud&#x27;s) Well to south-east of the Manor House.

Longthorpe Primary School is located in the village on Bradwell Road; secondary pupils attend nearby Jack Hunt School in Netherton.

== Civil parish ==
Longthorpe was formerly a chapelry in Peterborough-St. John-the-Baptist parish, from 1 November 1908 Longthorpe was a civil parish in its own right (being formed from Peterborough Without) until it was abolished on 1 April 1929 and merged with Peterborough. In 1921 the parish had a population of 274.

<doc id="1224574" wikidata="Q901885" url="?curid=1224574" title="Quincy Market">
<text>Quincy Market is a historic building near Faneuil Hall in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. It was constructed between 1824 and 1826 and named in honor of mayor Josiah Quincy, who organized its construction without any tax or debt. The market is a designated National Historic Landmark and a designated Boston Landmark in 1996, significant as one of the largest market complexes built in the United States in the first half of the 19th century. According to the National Park Service, some of Boston&#x27;s early slave auctions took place near what is now Quincy Market.

As the central building of Faneuil Hall Marketplace, Quincy Market is often used metonymically for the entire development. By the mid-20th century it was badly in need of repair, and it was redeveloped into a public shopping and restaurant area in the early 1970s and re-opened in 1976. Today, this includes the original Quincy Market buildings, the later North Market and South Market buildings that flank the main Quincy Market, the historic Faneuil Hall lying at the west end, and two smaller curved buildings, added later to the eastern end.

==History==

By the time Boston was incorporated as a city in 1822, downtown commercial demand had grown beyond the capacity of Faneuil Hall. To provide an expansion of shop space Quincy Market was built, as an indoor pavilion of vendor stalls.

Designed by Alexander Parris, the main building was built immediately east of and &quot;behind&quot; Faneuil Hall which at the time sat next to the waterfront at the town dock. In an early example of Boston&#x27;s tendency for territorial growth via landfill, part of the harbor was filled in with dirt to provide a plot of land for the market. The commercial growth spawned by the new marketplace led to the reconstruction or addition of six city streets.

From its beginning, the Market was largely used as a produce and foodstuff shopping center, with various grocers of such goods as eggs, cheese, and bread lining its inside walls. Digging performed for the expansion of the market in the late 1970s uncovered evidence of animal bones, suggesting that butchering work was done on-site. In addition, street vendors took up space outside the building in its plazas and against its outside walls. Some surviving signs of early food and supplies merchants hang today in the upstairs seating hall.

==Design==

The market is two stories tall, long, and covers of land. Its exterior is largely granite, with red brick interior walls, and represents the first large-scale use of granite and glass in post-and-beam construction. Within, it employs innovative cast iron columns and iron tension rods. The east and west facades exhibit a strong Roman style, with strong triangular pediments and Doric columns. In contrast, the sides of the hall are more modern and American, with rows of rectangular windows.

The building&#x27;s shape is a long rectangle, providing for a long hallway down its center line. On the roof are eight evenly spaced chimneys, and a copper-based dome in the center of the building, which covers an open common seating area and the major side entrances.

The main building is flanked on either side by -story brick and granite buildings, called the North Market and South Market. Part of the market&#x27;s original development, these buildings have been more extensively altered than the main building. The entire complex was designated a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. The central domed building was designated a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 1996. The North and South Market buildings are currently pending Boston Landmarks.

== Faneuil Hall Marketplace ==

In 1969, the department of Housing and Urban Development awarded the city of Boston approximately $2 million for market stabilization and restoration of roof lines and facades back to their 1826 appearance. The restoration project team included : Architectural Heritage Inc., Roger Webb; Stahl/Bennett Architects. Frederic A. Stahl, Principal in Charge; Roger Lang, Project Manager; James H. Ballou, Consulting Architect; and William LeMessurier, Structural Engineer.
By the early 1970s, Boston&#x27;s meat and produce had moved to larger, more modern facilities and Quincy Market was decaying. Using a combination of public and private funds, architectural firm Benjamin Thompson and Associates and the developer Rouse Company developed a new building form, the festival marketplace. The new Faneuil Hall Marketplace, incorporating Quincy Market, opened in 1976. In 1977, it received the Harleston Parker Medal and in 2009, the AIA&#x27;s Twenty-five Year Award.

The main Quincy Market building continues to be a source of food for Bostonians, though it has changed from grocery to food-stall, fast-food, and restaurants. It is a popular and busy lunchtime spot for downtown workers. In the center, surrounding the dome, is a two-story seating area.

Further street vending space is available against the outside walls of the building, especially on the south side, under a glass enclosure. Most stalls in this space sell trinkets, gifts, and other curiosities. A few restaurants also occupy fully enclosed spaces at the ends of this enclosure.

More conventional retail space is provided on the second floor and in the basement level. The Comedy Connection, one of Boston&#x27;s two largest comedy clubs, only recently vacated one of the second-floor spaces, and bars and restaurants occupy space on the basement levels.

Flanking the main building in the marketplace are two equally long buildings (North Market and South Market) that expand the market space for more restaurants, specialty shops, and office spaces. Two further concave market buildings enclose a circular plaza at the market&#x27;s east end.

The open spaces at both the east and west ends of the marketplace are a common venue for various street performers, as well as street vendors. Most daytime visits to Quincy Market will encounter a large circular crowd of people standing around a juggler or other act.

<text>George Tabori ( György Tábori; 24 May 1914 – 23 July 2007) was a Hungarian writer and theatre director.

==Life and career==
Tabori was born in Budapest as György Tábori, a son of Kornél (Cornelius) and Elsa Tábori. He was raised as a Catholic, and was only told about his Jewish origin when he was seven years old. His father Kornél was murdered in Auschwitz in 1944, but his mother and his brother Paul Tabori (writer and psychical researcher), managed to escape the Nazis. As a young man, Tabori travelled to Berlin but was forced to leave Nazi Germany in 1935 because of his Jewish background. He first went to London, where he worked for the BBC and received British citizenship. In 1947 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a translator (mainly of works by Bertolt Brecht and Max Frisch) and a screenwriter including Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s movie &quot;I Confess&quot; (1953).

His first novel, &quot;Beneath The Stone&quot;, was published in America in 1945. In the late 1960s, Tabori brought his own and the work of Brecht to many colleges and universities. At the University of Pennsylvania he taught classes in dramatic writing which resulted in Werner Liepolt&#x27;s &quot;The Young Master Dante&quot; and Ron Cowen&#x27;s &quot;Summertree&quot;. His play &quot;The Niggerlovers&quot; debuted in 1967 starring Morgan Freeman and Stacy Keach. Two of Tabori&#x27;s plays in English -- &quot;The Cannibals&quot; and &quot;Pinkville&quot;—were produced by Wynn Handman at the American Place Theatre in New York City from 1968 through 1970. His play &quot;The Prince&quot; was filmed by John Boorman as &quot;Leo the Last&quot; (1970) with Marcello Mastroianni and Billie Whitelaw; the film won the Director&#x27;s Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in that year.

During his period in America, Tabori married Viveca Lindfors. In addition to his own child, Lena, with Lindfors, Tabori adopted Lindfors&#x27; two sons (from her marriage to film director Don Siegel), John and Kristoffer. Kristoffer later became an actor and Lena a publisher.

In 1971, Tabori moved to Germany, where his new emphasis was theater work, and mainly worked in Berlin, Munich, and Vienna. His 1991 &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; is a satirical farce based on Biblical stories which end in disaster.
He died in Berlin, aged 93.

<doc id="1224589" wikidata="Q701250" url="?curid=1224589" title="Larry Wu-tai Chin">
<text>Larry Wu-tai Chin (; August 17, 1922 – February 21, 1986) was a Chinese Communist spy who worked for the United States Government for 37 years (1944–1981), including positions at the U.S. Army and the CIA, while secretly being a mole for the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s intelligence apparatus from the very beginning. He kept passing classified documents and secret information to the People&#x27;s Republic of China even after his retirement, until he was finally exposed in 1985.

Chin was one of China&#x27;s most valuable foreign intelligence agents of the entire Cold War period; he supplied the PRC with top-secret information on American foreign policy initiatives relating to China, as well as biographical profiles of CIA agents. In 1970, he passed CIA documents to Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai regarding President Richard Nixon&#x27;s desire to open relations with the PRC; Mao therefore knew about Nixon&#x27;s intentions well in advance of his diplomatic overtures, which allowed him to alter his policy (such as the volume of anti-American rhetoric in the state-controlled Chinese press) in order to extract the maximum political concessions from the Americans. Chin was a naturalized U.S. citizen.

== Early life ==
Born as Chin Wu-tai in Peking, Republic of China, in 1922, he attended Yenching University.

Chin was recruited by the Chinese Communist intelligence apparatus (then called the Central Social Affairs Department, or SAD) in 1944, during World War II. He was specifically directed to find employment in an American government agency (at the time, the Nationalist Government of Chiang Kai-shek was working closely with the Americans against Japan). Chin, who spoke good English, was hired by the United States Army, and was appointed to work as a translator of Chinese language at the U.S. Army Liaison Office in the city of Fuzhou.

From 1945 to 1949 Chin was a translator for the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai, and from 1949 to 1950 for the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong (then under British rule). During this time, he passed countless classified documents to the Chinese Communist intelligence service directed by Li Kenong during the early years of the PRC and was named first the Liaison Department and later the Central Investigation Department. Chin was regularly and highly paid for his services.

== Korean War ==
Chin served as a Chinese translator in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, helping to debrief Chinese and North Korean prisoners of war. He misrepresented the intelligence that he was translating from captured Chinese soldiers resulting in the loss of U.S. forces and missed tactical opportunities. Many of these Chinese soldiers intended to defect to South Korea. He also provided the Chinese government with the names of captured Chinese soldiers who were revealing information or declared themselves opposed to Communist Party rule and intended to defect. The Chinese then specifically requested these soldiers by name to be released back to China before the armistice negotiations could take place. This delayed the negotiations process for over a year.
== Penetrating the CIA ==
Following his U.S. Army service, Chin applied to and was accepted by the CIA. He was assigned as a Chinese language translator and analyst of the Chinese Communist press at the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), where he continued his espionage for China. He was posted in Okinawa (1952–61), Santa Rosa, California (1961–71) and Rosslyn, Virginia (1971–81). According to No Kum-Sok, the North Korean pilot who defected with a MiG-15, Larry Chin was one of his CIA handlers after his defection.

As an FBIS analyst and one of the CIA&#x27;s few fluent Chinese linguists, Chin was able to pass along such information as &quot;Intelligence Information Reports (IIRs)&quot; on China and East Asia, biographical profiles and assessments of fellow CIA employees, and the names and identities of the Agency&#x27;s covert agents. He was also in a position to provide information about recruited deep-cover agents in China. Due to the CIA&#x27;s policy of internal compartmentalization, Chin did not know their real names or identities; however, based on the intelligence they provided, he could infer such things as their locations, employers, and levels of access. Chinese counterintelligence could then attempt to identify them by determining who had access to what information. Once the agents were identified, they would routinely be arrested and executed, or, alternatively, fed false information to be communicated to the CIA. Most significantly, in 1970 Chin provided to the Maoist leadership in Beijing CIA documents that revealed the plans of President Richard Nixon to engage China in order to form a tactical alliance against (and put pressure on) the Soviet Union. Mao, knowing in advance of American designs and objectives, could squeeze maximum concessions from the Nixon administration.

== Exposure ==
Only five years later did any allegation of espionage arise. In 1985, Yu Qiangsheng, a high-ranking Chinese intelligence official, defected to the United States and exposed Chin&#x27;s espionage identity. On November 23, 1985, Chin was arrested. He was held at the Prince William County, Virginia, jail, as the United States Marshal&#x27;s Service typically places espionage suspects in Washington, DC-area county jails.

The first espionage count accused Chin of having conspired with Chinese intelligence agents to transmit defense-related documents potentially damaging to U.S. interests or advantageous to those of China. The second espionage count charged Chin specifically with having transmitted to a foreign agent in 1952 information about the location of prison camps in Korea where Chinese prisoners were held.

== Death ==
On the day of his sentencing, when guards arrived at Chin&#x27;s cell in the Prince William-Manassas Regional Adult Detention Center to transport him to court, they found him lifeless with a garbage bag over his head. An autopsy concluded that Chin had committed suicide in his cell. Shortly prior to his suicide, the Chinese consul made an authorized visit and informed him that the Chinese government would provide for the needs of his family if he died without revealing his secrets. His body was buried in Alta Mesa Memorial Park in Palo Alto, California.

A cenotaph believed to be for Chin was found in Fragrant Hills in Beijing by a visitor passing by in 2017.

== Impact ==
Chin was one of China&#x27;s most important foreign intelligence assets of the Cold War era. Due to his services, the Chinese government was able to extract the maximum political concessions from Richard Nixon in return for a tactical alliance against the Soviet Union. The majority of CIA agents in China were compromised and executed, or fed false information to be reported back to the Agency, and the Chinese leadership could have determined how accurate were U.S. intelligence assessments concerning the PRC&#x27;s intelligence, political, economic, and military infrastructures.

<doc id="1224592" wikidata="Q375325" url="?curid=1224592" title="Robert I, Count of Artois">
<text>Robert I (25 September 1216 – 8 February 1250), called the Good, was the first Count of Artois. He was the fifth (and second surviving) son of King Louis VIII of France and Blanche of Castile.

==Life==
He received Artois as an appanage, in accordance with the will of his father (died 1226) on attaining his majority in 1237 (aged twenty-one). In 1240 Pope Gregory IX, in conflict with Emperor Frederick II, offered to crown Robert as emperor in opposition to Frederick, but the French count refused to pretend to such a title.

==Marriage==
On 14 June 1237 Robert married Matilda, daughter of Henry II of Brabant and Marie of Hohenstaufen. 

They had two children:

* Blanche (1248–1302)
* Robert II (1250–1302), who succeeded to Artois.

==Death==
While participating in the Seventh Crusade, Robert died while leading a reckless attack on Al Mansurah, without the knowledge of his brother King Louis IX. After fording a river, he and a group of Knights Templars charged a Mamluk outpost, during which the Mamluk commander, Fakhr-ad-Din Yusuf, was killed. Emboldened by his success, Robert, the Templar knights, and a contingent of English troops charged into the town and became trapped in the narrow streets. According to Jean de Joinville, Robert defended himself for some time in a house there, but was at last overpowered and killed.

<doc id="1224598" wikidata="Q1035698" url="?curid=1224598" title="Heroes and Villains">
<text>&quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; is a song by the American rock band the Beach Boys from their 1967 album &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; and their unfinished &quot;Smile&quot; project. Written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks, Wilson envisioned the song as an Old West-themed musical comedy that would surpass the recording and artistic achievements of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. The single was Brother Records&#x27; first release. While it failed to meet critical and commercial expectations, it was nevertheless a hit record, peaking at number 12 in the U.S. and number 8 in the UK.

The song was Wilson and Parks&#x27; first collaboration. Parks characterized the song as &quot;historically reflective&quot; and a &quot;visual effort&quot; that was meant to match the ballads of Marty Robbins. He said the lyrics were based on the early history of California, including references to the involvement of the Spanish and American Indians. Some accounts suggest that the song developed partly from a Wilson reworking of the standard &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot;. Early versions included sections with lyrics about farm animals (&quot;Barnyard&quot;) and physical health (&quot;I&#x27;m in Great Shape&quot;).

&quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; had the most complex making of any song in the band&#x27;s history. Recording spanned virtually the entire &quot;Smile&quot; sessions as Wilson experimented with at least a dozen versions of the track, some of which ranged in length from six to eight minutes. Wilson discarded almost everything that was recorded, with expenses totaling around $40,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Most of the final composite was produced in three days at his makeshift home studio. The chorus featured a theme that was cannibalized from another &quot;Smile&quot; track, &quot;Do You Like Worms?&quot;.

Wilson&#x27;s bandmates and associates later voiced dissatisfaction with the released version, believing that the mix was vastly inferior to his earlier, lengthier edits. Commentators blame the record&#x27;s failure on the esoteric lyrics, the &quot;muddy&quot; sound quality, and the late timing of the release. It remains one of the lesser-known hit songs in the Beach Boys&#x27; catalog. For Wilson, the single&#x27;s failure came to serve as a pivotal point in his psychological decline, and he adopted the song title as a term for his auditory hallucinations. In 2004, Wilson remade the song and its related pieces for &quot;Brian Wilson Presents Smile&quot;. In 2011, &quot;The Smile Sessions&quot; was released with an entire disc devoted to the song&#x27;s original recording sessions. 

==Background==
Wilson had been working on &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; for some time before he asked Parks to be his lyricist in mid-July 1966. Al Jardine surmised that the song derived in part from the group&#x27;s improvised scat singing exercises from early in the band&#x27;s existence. In a 2000 interview, he stated, &quot;We all became instruments for Brian&#x27;s barbershop concept. He said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s all do this, let&#x27;s sing this idea.&#x27; Carl would be one instrument, I&#x27;d be another. Mike would be another instrument. [...] With none of us really being players, we would just scat in the car going to a show or something or going to school, anywhere.&quot; Musician Al Kooper, writing in his 2008 autobiography, recalled that Wilson played him a rough mix of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; shortly after the release of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. Kooper remembered that the song had &quot;evolved, I believe, from a Wilson revamping of &#x27;You Are My Sunshine.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; was the first song that Wilson and Parks wrote together. As with the others that they wrote for the &quot;Smile&quot; album, Parks wrote the words while Wilson composed the music. When presented the descending melody at the initial writing session, occurring a few days after their first meeting, Parks was reminded of the Marty Robbins&#x27; 1959 song &quot;El Paso&quot; and immediately conceived the opening line: &quot;I&#x27;ve been in this town so long that back in the city I&#x27;ve been taken for lost and gone and unknown for a long, long time.&quot;

Wilson told Parks that he had thought of the Old West when conceiving the melody. Journalist Domenic Priore speculated that Wilson may have based the verses on Phil Spector&#x27;s productions of &quot;River Deep - Mountain High&quot; and &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; – particularly the former&#x27;s bass line. Asked in 2004 about the influence of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; on the recurring melodies and themes on &quot;Smile&quot;, Wilson responded: &quot;A little bit, not much. It influenced &#x27;Heroes &amp; Villains&#x27; and a couple of others.&quot; He credited Parks with some of the music and arrangement on &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;.

In Parks&#x27; recollection, all but one section of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; was written entirely &quot;in one sitting&quot;. The success of the pair&#x27;s collaboration led to them writing more songs with an Old West theme, including &quot;Barnyard&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m in Great Shape&quot;. It became an integral track for the &quot;Smile&quot; project and, later, was often called the album&#x27;s &quot;centerpiece&quot;. Wilson envisioned &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; as a three-minute musical comedy that would surpass his achievements with &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. In a 1977 radio interview, he offered an anecdote in which he told his father, Murry that he was going &quot;&#x27;to make a record that&#x27;s better than &#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27;, something that &quot;you&quot; could never do. I don&#x27;t know why in the hell I said that.&quot;

In a self-penned 1969 article, former band associate Michael Vosse wrote that, during one night at Wilson&#x27;s home, Wilson played a past-tense variation on &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; on piano that deviated into &quot;this weird little riff&quot;. Vosse said, &quot;And it hit him, man, right then that he wanted a barn yard—he wanted Old MacDonald&#x27;s farm—he wanted all that stuff. So he immediately got Van Dyke over and they did a chart for &#x27;You were my sunshine&#x27;&quot;. Although Vosse admitted that his memory may be wrong, since Wilson &quot;changed things so much&quot;, he recalled that the arrangement then &quot;developed into an instrumental thing with barnyard sounds—people sawing—he had people in the studio sawing on wood—and Van Dyke being a duck—and it was marvelous.&quot; Asked about Wilson&#x27;s rendition of &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; in 2004, Parks could not remember having been involved with it.

==Lyrics==
There are conflicting reports regarding who came up with the title. Wilson credited Parks with naming the song, but Parks denied this, saying that he wrote the lyrics around the title that Wilson had suggested. Wilson&#x27;s then-wife Marilyn commented: &quot;There are so many screwed-up people in the music industry. The good guys and the bad guys [...] That&#x27;s one thing Brian had in mind when they did &#x27;Heroes and Villains. Biographer Peter Ames Carlin interpreted the song as Wilson projecting &quot;all of the feelings sensed inside of himself [...] into vibrantly colored, abstract glimpses into another parallel world.&quot;

In Carlin&#x27;s interpretation, the song describes &quot;a lawless boomtown somewhere out on the fringes of the Old West&quot; as told from the perspective of a narrator who &quot;speaks as a man who has become a part of the scene, but not of it, exactly, because he&#x27;s still so thrilled and terrified by everything he sees.&quot; At the song&#x27;s conclusion, the protagonist &quot;has aged and seen his children grow to adulthood&quot; without knowing if his experiences have turned him into a hero or a villain.

Alternate versions of the song tell a different narrative, as &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;″s Ed Howard writes, &quot;&#x27;Heroes &amp; Villains&#x27; told a story, though the actual narrative changed depending on what sections were being added or discarded at any given time.&quot; In reference to &quot;I&#x27;m in Great Shape&quot;, Parks commented: &quot;it&#x27;s interesting how [in the lyrics] there was, all of a sudden, this turning to eggs and grits. It&#x27;s because it had something to do with the thought of a barnyard, and that related to that place we were trying to come up with in &#x27;Heroes And Villains&#x27;. All those lyrics were visual efforts.&quot;

Contrary to a popular rumor, the song was not written about the nascent war in Vietnam. Parks said the lyrics were actually centered around an American Indian &quot;thing&quot; in which he and Wilson &quot;were trying to exculpate our guilt, to atone for what we had done to the aborigines of our own place. There&#x27;s a lot of things about belief in &quot;Smile&quot;, and its very question of belief is what was plaguing Brian at that time. What should we keep from the structure that we had, the hard-wiring that we had with religion?&quot; Historian Keith Badman speculated that the &quot;you&#x27;re under arrest&quot; line from an earlier version of the song may have been inspired by Wilson witnessing an attempted burglary of his Rolls-Royce.

Artist Frank Holmes, who designed the &quot;Smile&quot; cover artwork, created an illustration that was inspired by the song&#x27;s lyrics: &quot;The rain of bullets that eventually brought her down&quot;. Along with several other drawings, it was planned to be included within a booklet packaged with the &quot;Smile&quot; LP. Holmes shared a summary of his design choices in Domenic Priore&#x27;s 2005 book &quot;Smile: The Story of Brian Wilson&#x27;s Lost Masterpiece&quot;. Holmes recalled of the illustration, &quot;the poultry in the right corner is saying, &#x27;Dude&#x27;ll do,&#x27; a reference to a line in the original lyrics: &#x27;She was unafraid of what a dude’ll do in a town full of heroes and villains.&#x27; Van Dyke tells me that Brian saw that image and actually got the other Beach Boys to change their singing to ‘Dude’ll do’, based on this. So there&#x27;s a case of the drawing definitely influencing the work.&quot;

==Production==
===Overview===
&quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; had the most complex making of any song in the band&#x27;s history, with dozens of sections and themes recorded for the track. Approximately 30 session dates were devoted to the song. Recording spanned virtually the entire &quot;Smile&quot; sessions, with the total production costs estimated at $40,000 (equivalent to $ in ), a sum that was possibly three to four times greater than that for &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. Wilson also worked on and revised &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; more than any other track for the LP. He experimented with myriad versions of the song, some of which ranged in length from six to eight minutes. Numerous rough mixes were completed, including at least four substantially different versions. It is the only track on &quot;Smile&quot; in which Wilson recorded vocals before the different sections of the song was assembled. Wilson said it was also the only song he ever produced in which the bass drum was the backbeat. &quot;Great boom boom. People across the street were saying, &#x27;Hey—whatever you&#x27;re doing sounds great!&#x27; Thank you very much!&quot;

Some sections that were recorded for &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; were, at one point, slated to be dedicated songs of their own. In the 1970s, Wilson told biographer Byron Preiss that there was intended to be a piece called the &quot;Barnyard Suite&quot;, which would have been &quot;four songs in four short pieces, combined together, but we never finished that one. We got into something else.&quot; The only consistent element among the many versions of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; was that the song began with the &quot;I&#x27;ve been in this town ...&quot; verse. From there, the rest of the track was constantly revised. Journalist Peter Doggett commented, &quot;The shifts of melody and tempo are so dramatic that virtually anything could have been considered part of that song; in Brian Wilson&#x27;s mind, virtually anything was.&quot;

Vosse recalled that &quot;there must have been a dozen versions. The best version I heard, which was never completed, but at least I could see the form of it, was an A side B side version lasting about six minutes. It was a beautifully structured work; and Van Dyke was still very involved.&quot; Wilson later denied that he had ever planned to issue the song in this form. In 2006, Carlin reported that a rumored 11-minute edit had yet to be found. In 2013, an acetate containing an early mix of the song was discovered. It indicated that Wilson had experimented with incorporating recorded sections of &quot;I&#x27;m in Great Shape&quot; into the projected &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; single.

One of Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; recording experiments was, according to journalist Nick Kent, directly inspired by his emerging struggles with auditory hallucinations. Kent wrote that, during a session, Wilson attempted to recreate a &quot;ghoulish&quot; voice in his head by &quot;taking a tape of some acappella Beach Boys vocal horse-play and slowing it down until it was just this vast swamp-like groan of terror. It was the scariest sound of anything he created for &quot;Smile&quot; ...&quot; In the September/October 1967 issue of &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot;, journalist and magazine founder Paul Williams wrote that the song &quot;originally had a chorus of dogs barking, cropped when Brian heard &quot;Sergeant Pepper&quot;, and was in many ways - the bicycle rider - a far different song.&quot;

===Early sessions (May–November 1966) ===

On May 11, Wilson went into Gold Star Studios and recorded an instrumental take of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; with a 2:45 runtime. According to Badman, the session was conducted as an experiment and was not a full-fledged recording. It is one of the many recordings of the songs that have since been presumed missing or lost. According to journalist Domenic Priore, this early take may have included a section that quoted &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot;. Engineer Chuck Britz told Preiss that &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; was &quot;as big if not bigger than &#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27; in its original form. I thought it was a fantastic song, a great, rich full sound. [...] We had our basic unit-an organ, drums, basses, and guitars. Mostly everything we did had the same amount of basic instrumentation. I think there was a harpsichord in the back of the room and a harp played by Mike’s sister, Maureen.&quot;

&quot;Barnyard&quot; and the backing track verses of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; were both recorded on October 20, 1966, at Western Studio. &quot;Barnyard&quot; featured animal noises roared by Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Smile&quot; coterie, including singer Danny Hutton and his girlfriend June Fairchild. A session for &quot;I&#x27;m in Great Shape&quot; followed on October 27. On the recording, Wilson experimented with a tape delay effect that looped the audio signal back into itself cumulatively at a high gain level to create an &quot;explosion&quot; of sound. On November 4, Wilson recorded a piano demonstration of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; that included &quot;I&#x27;m in Great Shape&quot; and &quot;Barnyard&quot; as sections of the song. Parks and KHJ DJ Humble Harve Miller are also featured on this recording – the former providing animal sounds.

On November 14, Wilson recorded &quot;My Only Sunshine&quot;, a medley of the standards &quot;The Old Master Painter&quot; and &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot;. The renditions are relatively short. In 2005, Wilson wrote that the rendition of &quot;The Old Master Painter&quot; was brief because he could not remember the full song. During the recording, Wilson remarked that the session players should play as though they&#x27;re far away, as the lyric suggests. Reflective of the spiritual themes recurring throughout the &quot;Smile&quot; songs, &quot;The Old Master Painter&quot; is a song that evokes God in its lyrics. &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; ends with a string section descending to a low discordance where Brian used the adjectives &quot;snappy&quot; and &quot;draggy&quot; to instruct session players. The master take for &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; was spliced out of the original reel so that Dennis Wilson could add a lead vocal. In 1968, a mono mixdown of the tape was created, but as of 2004, the original master had gone missing from the band&#x27;s archives.

===Delays and further recording (December 1966 – March 1967)===

&quot;Smile&quot; was first projected for a December 1966 release date. On December 15, Wilson informed Capitol A&amp;R director Karl Engemann that the album and its lead single &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; would probably be delivered &quot;some time prior to January 15&quot;. He attempted to ease Capitol&#x27;s concerns over the album&#x27;s delay by delivering a handwritten note that contained an unordered, preliminary track listing. &quot;I&#x27;m in Great Shape&quot; and &quot;The Old Master Painter&quot; were both listed as a separate track from &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;. Capitol delayed the release date of &quot;Smile&quot; and &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; to March 1967. Possibly due to their insistence on a ready single, Wilson returned to work on &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; on December 19, 1966, after which he halted work on most of the album&#x27;s other tracks until April 1967. According to former band associate David Anderle, in December 1966, Wilson was unable to decide if &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; should be the single.

By the start of 1967, the &quot;Smile&quot; recording sessions were marked by tension, a contrast from the joyous atmosphere that began the project. In one section of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;, Wilson instructed his bandmates to crawl on the floor of the studio and make pig-like snorting sounds. Jardine remembered, &quot;You hear a bunch of snorting and swining... It was like being trapped in an insane asylum. I was emotionally depressed by a lot of that stuff ...&quot; On January 3, a module of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; called &quot;Do a Lot&quot; was recorded. A surviving tape of this session includes a remark from Wilson saying, &quot;If there&#x27;s not anymore cooperation of this, I&#x27;m splitting, I mean it. We better get back into the groove, you know?&quot; &quot;Do a Lot&quot; was later reconfigured as &quot;Mama Says&quot; and briefly as a section of &quot;Vega-Tables&quot;. Similarly, on January 27, a section called &quot;All Day&quot; was recorded. Also known as &quot;Love to Say Dada&quot;, it later evolved into &quot;Cool, Cool Water&quot;. At some point, Wilson began considering &quot;Bicycle Rider&quot;, a module from &quot;Do You Like Worms?&quot;, for inclusion in the structure of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;.

On February 10, Wilson completed a mix of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;, later known as the &quot;Cantina&quot; version, that ended with a coda extracted from &quot;My Only Sunshine&quot;. Wilson soon discarded this version and the master tape was later lost, leaving just a safety copy of the mix. On February 16, Richard Goldstein reported in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; that the forthcoming single had &quot;five movements, each with a distinct melodic and rhythm line.&quot; On February 18, journalist Tracy Thomas reported in the &quot;NME&quot; that &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; would be released once Wilson decides on the contents of the single&#x27;s B-side. She quoted Wilson as saying that he wanted to &quot;keep as much of &quot;Smile&quot; a surprise as possible. I may end up just recording me and a piano. I tried it last night in the studio. It would be an interesting contrast, anyway.&quot;

Work on the song continued throughout February and March. At the end of February, the band launched a lawsuit against Capitol that sought neglected royalty payments and a dissolution of their contract with the label. Following this, Wilson announced that the album&#x27;s lead single would be &quot;Vega-Tables&quot;, a song that he had yet to start recording.

===Parks&#x27; departure and hiatus (March–May 1967) ===

On March 2, 1967, after a session for &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;, Wilson and Parks ran into disagreements, possibly over lyrics, and temporarily dissolved their partnership. On March 18, KMEM in San Bernardino conducted a radio survey that reported that Wilson was busy preparing &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot;, &quot;and he&#x27;s informed the Capitol bosses that he doesn&#x27;t intend to &#x27;hold back&#x27; on these projects.&quot; On March 21, band publicist Derek Taylor reported in his weekly column for &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot;, &quot;Only a scoundrel would dispute the claim that &#x27;Heroes and Villains&#x27; is the most famous single not yet recorded. [...] it is a fact that the single, at the time of writing, is not completed and many people here are troubled. But Brian Wilson is not one of them.&quot;

In April, Wilson paused work on &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; to focus on &quot;Vega-Tables&quot; for two weeks. Parks&#x27; last recorded appearance on the album&#x27;s sessions was for a &quot;Vega-Tables&quot; date on April 14, after which Wilson took a four-week break from the studio.

On April 29, Taylor announced in &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; that &quot;All the 12 songs for the new Beach Boys album are completed and [...] there are plans to release the album on a rush-schedule any moment.&quot; That same day, a Taylor-penned press release, published in &quot;Record Mirror&quot; and &quot;NME&quot;, revealed that &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; was delayed due to &quot;technical difficulties&quot;. On May 6, Taylor announced that &quot;Smile&quot; had been &quot;scrapped&quot; by Wilson. On May 11, Wilson returned to work on &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; for a single session. On May 14, Carl Wilson stated at a press conference in Holland that &quot;Vega-Tables&quot; would probably be released as a single instead of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;.

===&quot;Smiley Smile&quot; remake (June–July 1967) ===

By June, Brian had declared to his bandmates that most of the material recorded for &quot;Smile&quot; was now off-limits and that he wanted to rerecord &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; from scratch. Vocal and instrumental tracking on the song lasted from June 12 to 14 at Wilson&#x27;s makeshift home studio, representing a dramatic contrast from his previous working methods. According to the group&#x27;s statements to the press, they abruptly dropped out of headlining the Monterey Pop Festival that weekend because of commitments to deliver the &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; single to Capitol.

Biographer Steven Gaines wrote that &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; was the only track prepared for the forthcoming &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; album that Wilson &quot;really cared about&quot;. Jim Lockhert, the engineer for the &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; sessions, recalled: &quot;We had the complete song, but they just wanted to use part of it. Brian wanted to change what had been done on the rest of it. I think he wanted instrumentally and vocally to make it more complex. I think he wanted to finish the song, it was a challenge to him.&quot; Like many of the other tracks on &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, Wilson used his recently acquired Baldwin theatre organ on the track. On some parts of the recording, the band used Wilson&#x27;s swimming pool as an echo chamber.

The final overdubs were recorded around late June or early July. On July 22, Mike Love played a version of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; for &quot;NME&quot;″s Keith Altham, who reported, &quot;His particular tape ran for about six minutes. The harmonies and melodies are as intricate as one would expect. The number sounds like a combination of &#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27;, &#x27;God Only Knows&#x27; and &#x27;I Just Wasn&#x27;t Made for These Times&#x27;.&quot;

After a brief period spent re-mixing and editing the song, the record was completed with a runtime of three minutes and 36 seconds. The only remnant of the earlier &quot;Smile&quot; recordings that made it into the final edit was portions of the backing track that had been recorded in October 1966. The final edit featured a complex vocal arrangement, unusual formal juxtapositions, tempo changes, and other novel elements. It starts at a fast tempo, alternates between a slower chorus, and at the end, shifts to an out-of-tempo a capella section that leads abruptly into the chorus fade-out.

The chorus featured a theme that was cannibalized from &quot;Do You Like Worms?&quot;. According to Jardine, the &quot;most important part of the song&quot; was the change from E minor to A major, &quot;The choruses repeat and you’d hear the theme repeated and repeated in the song. That’s very similar with what classical composers used to do, and that’s what I liked. I really enjoyed the recurring themes with different arrangements.&quot;

==Release==

Wilson held onto the final mix of the song for about a month. On the evening of July 11, 1967, he was told by his astrologer (a woman named Genevelyn) that the time was right for the record to be heard by the public. Without informing Capitol, Wilson called his bandmates and, accompanied by producer Terry Melcher, traveled by limo to personally deliver a vinyl cut of the record to KHJ Radio. According to Melcher, as Wilson excitedly offered the record for radio play, the DJ refused, citing program directing protocols. Melcher recalled: &quot;Brian almost fainted! It was all over. He&#x27;d been holding onto the record [and] had astrologers figuring out the correct moment. It really killed him. Finally they played it, but only after a few calls to the program director or someone, who screamed, &#x27;Put it on, you idiot!&#x27; But the damage to Brian had already been done.&quot;

&quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; was among the most highly publicized singles in the history of rock music. Issued on July 24, it was the first release on the Beach Boys&#x27; Brother Records and failed to match the commercial success of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; by a considerable degree. It debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 81 on August 6, peaked at number 12 around September 4, and dropped off the charts one week later. In Britain, the single was issued on August 18 and reached number 8 on the UK Singles Chart.

Filmmaker Peter Clifton compiled a music video of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; set to footage of surfers riding waves for the BBC. The clip aired on the network&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on August 31. On September 2, the BBC hired a film crew to shoot an official music video of the song that featured the group at Brian&#x27;s home. The film was scheduled to air on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; around September 21 but was later scrapped. On September 18, &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; was released with &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; as the opening track. It was one of the album&#x27;s two elaborately-produced tracks (the other being &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;).

==Contemporary critical response==
Critical reaction to the single was mixed. David Anderle later said that whatever new fans the group had brought with &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; were &quot;immediately lost with the release of &#x27;Heroes of Villains.&#x27;&quot; In reference to the song, Jimi Hendrix told &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot;: &quot;Don’t particularly like the Beach Boys. Makes me think of a psychedelic barbershop quartet!&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; reviewed it as &quot;clever off-beat rock material with an arrangement that encompasses barbershop harmony and jazz!&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; called it a &quot;creatively delivered conglomeration of sounds that run the gamut from amusement park hooplah to barbershop harmony&quot; and said that the lyrics &quot;pose some interesting questions.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; called it &quot;a strange, appealing, harmonious song.&quot;

Bruce Johnston witnessed the record&#x27;s debut at The Speakeasy Club in London. He recalled, &quot;Everyone really got up to dance. But when the tempo changed, I knew we&#x27;d blown it with that record.&quot; Among British reviewers, &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot;″s Penny Valentine lamented that while she appreciated certain aspects of the song on repeated listens, &quot;the record as a whole [...] is disappointing. [...] one has, perhaps, just come to expect too much from the Beach Boys. And this isn&#x27;t it!&quot; In his review for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Nick Jones praised the song as &quot;another masterpiece of production from Wilson and another move in his flowery progression.&quot; &quot;New Music Review&quot;″s critic described the song as &quot;weirdly fascinating&quot;.

In an editorial published in December, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; founding editor Jann Wenner referred to the song as &quot;pointless&quot; and a weak follow-up to &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. Music journalist Jules Siegel, who was present throughout the &quot;Smile&quot; sessions, reported in &quot;Cheetah&quot; that while it seemed like &quot;the Beatles had outdistanced the Beach Boys&quot; during the previous summer, &quot;some people think [&#x27;Heroes and Villains&#x27;] is better than anything the Beatles ever wrote.&quot; At the end of the year, French radio listeners selected &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; as the &quot;Record of the Year&quot;.

==Impact on Wilson&#x27;s decline==
&quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; came to be cited as a factor in Wilson&#x27;s professional and psychological decline. Badman stated that the dismal reception was the direct cause of Wilson&#x27;s withdrawal from the public eye, while Howard offered that the pressure to follow up &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; with &quot;an equally ingenious hit&quot; likely contributed to the collapse of the &quot;Smile&quot; project. Doggett called the &quot;saga&quot; of the song&#x27;s recording a &quot;microcosm of the entire &quot;Smile&quot; tragi-comedy&quot;.

Jack Rieley, who managed the band in the early 1970s, stated that the failure of the single &quot;shook [Brian] to the foundations of his being and self-respect. [...] this is when he started disappearing into his bedroom for a long time. This is when he ate himself into a state where he became horrendously fat.&quot; Marilyn said that Brian did not perform the song for anybody in the years following its release. In the 1998 documentary &quot;Endless Harmony&quot;, Love referred to &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; as the last dynamic moment in Wilson&#x27;s music. Journalist David Bennun concurred, &quot;In a way, Love is right. Brian Wilson would never again generate something as thrilling as Heroes And Villains, or any of the other, numerous, breathtaking tracks he had constructed for the band in their so far brief career.&quot;

Wilson would sometimes refer to the voices in his head as &quot;heroes and villains&quot;. Darian Sahanaja, a member of Wilson&#x27;s supporting band since the 1990s, said that, &quot;When I first met Brian, you couldn&#x27;t even mention the words &#x27;Heroes and Villains&#x27;; he’d turn around and walk away or he’d say, &#x27;I don’t want to talk about it.&#x27;&quot;

==Retrospective assessments==

Despite its relatively high chart placement, &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; remains one of the lesser-known songs in the Beach Boys&#x27; catalog. It was one of the last Beach Boys singles to break the US top 20 until &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; in 1976. Jardine told an interviewer that Parks felt his contributions destroyed the band&#x27;s commercial momentum: &quot;Y’know, he actually apologized to me - for &#x27;ruining my career.&#x27; I said, &#x27;Van Dyke, not only did you not ruin it but you enhanced it! You enhanced our knowledge just by being there.&quot;

Wilson&#x27;s bandmates did not feel that his final edit was as good as his earlier versions, and according to biographer David Leaf, &quot;all those who heard the original&quot; believed that the released version was missing crucial sequences that Wilson originally intended for the song. Jardine expressed dissatisfaction with the mix, describing it as &quot;a pale facsimile&quot; of Wilson&#x27;s original vision, and suggested that Wilson deliberately sabotaged the song at the last minute. He blamed the record&#x27;s lack of &quot;sonic energy&quot; on the limited recording equipment and felt that the mastering was probably engineered improperly, commenting, &quot;I could hear the difference. I could hear the edge was gone.&quot; Parks was not involved with the making of the final edit and later said that he was &quot;astonished&quot; by its structure and production quality when he heard it on the radio.

Howard opined that the song was &quot;more fractured&quot; and &quot;arguably more inspired&quot; than &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, likening it to a &quot;pocket opera&quot; (a reference to the term &quot;pocket symphony&quot;). Eric Luecking of NPR said that while &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; was more adventurous than &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, listeners could not relate to the song&#x27;s lyrics, which obscured the single&#x27;s legacy. Academic Larry Starr explained that the Wild West-themed subject matter &quot;lacked any context whatsoever in the cultural environment of popular music in 1967, an environment immersed in the emerging counterculture and one that tended to prize lyrics with marked personal or social &#x27;relevance.&#x27;&quot; Doggett felt that while the song was &quot;beautiful and intriguing&quot;, it was &quot;nowhere near as commercial as &#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27;.&quot;

Some commentators blame the shifts in contemporary pop culture for the record&#x27;s failure. Starr disputed the suggestion; instead, the song&#x27;s &quot;relatively limited appeal may be ascribed to two factors that remained problematic, or sometimes even disappointing, in the Beach Boys’ output for the remaining years of the 1960s: the lyrics, and the production values.&quot; Considering the rich orchestrations of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, Starr concluded that &quot;the source of biggest disappointment for listeners, however, may well have been the overall quality of the sound.&quot; Stebbins said that while the arrangement was &quot;generously filled with fantastic Beach Boys vocal harmonies and genius musical twists and turns&quot;, the record&#x27;s &quot;disturbingly muddy sound quality [...] undoubtedly hurt its commercial appeal.&quot;

Despite some commentators criticisms of the song, &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; has ranked highly in lists of the Beach Boys&#x27; greatest songs, and in some rankings of the greatest songs of all time. &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine named the song the 7th greatest by the Beach Boys, while the French edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it 8th. &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; founder Paul Williams listed it as one of the 100 greatest rock singles of all time in his 1993 book &quot;Rock and Roll: The 100 Best Singles.&quot;

==Other versions==

===1967 – &quot;Lei&#x27;d in Hawaii&quot;===
Before the release of &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, the Beach Boys attempted to make a live album known as &quot;Lei&#x27;d in Hawaii&quot;. Due to technical difficulties, they decided to record the album at Wally Heider&#x27;s Studio 3 on September 11, a session which included a runthrough of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;. A surviving audio tape of this performance features an overdubbed spoken-word monologue, given by Mike Love, in which he ridicules the song. Carlin writes that the track was likely not intended for release as Love&#x27;s rant shifts from &quot;mock-serious to bitterly sarcastic&quot; and &quot;becomes even more barbed as he goes on&quot;. He surmised that another laughing voice in the audio belonged to Wilson, and that Wilson may have coordinated the recording himself.

The 2017 compilation &quot;1967 – Sunshine Tomorrow&quot; includes this version of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;, albeit with Love&#x27;s monologue omitted. The band&#x27;s concerts in Hawaii marked the last time Wilson sang &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; before a public audience until 2001, when he performed the song at a Radio City Music Hall tribute concert held in his honor.

===2004 – &quot;Brian Wilson Presents Smile&quot;===

Wilson&#x27;s 2004 solo album &quot;Brian Wilson Presents Smile&quot; included new rerecordings of &quot;Gee&quot;, &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;, &quot;Barnyard&quot;, &quot;The Old Master Painter&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m in Great Shape&quot;. In this version, the discarded &quot;Cantina&quot; section was restored in &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;. Sahanaja recalled that the group had &quot;already been performing a version of the song that incorporated the &#x27;Cantina&#x27; section, and so Brian wanted to go with that structure for the recording.&quot;

An instrumental arrangement of &quot;Cantina&quot;, written by Sahanaja, was added as an introduction to &quot;I&#x27;m in Great Shape&quot;, the song which begins the album&#x27;s third movement. This time, the &quot;explosion&quot; tape delay effect was created with a digital plug-in. According to Sahanaja, the placement of &quot;I&#x27;m in Great Shape&quot; in the running order &quot;was probably a performance decision. I always felt that this song building into a feedback frenzy and breaking into &#x27;I Wanna Be Around&#x27; and &#x27;Workshop&quot; was the disoriented, reality defying portion of the performance. Shaking things up and slightly derailing before getting back on track–as if a metaphor for life. It seemed to fit for those reasons.&quot;

===2011 – &quot;The Smile Sessions&quot;===
Released in 2011, &quot;The Smile Sessions&quot; compilation included a hypothetical version of the original album that was based on Wilson&#x27;s 2004 version, albeit with a few changes in the sequencing. Among these revisions was the placement of &quot;I&#x27;m in Great Shape&quot;, which became sandwiched between &quot;Do You Like Worms?&quot; and &quot;Barnyard&quot;. Asked about this change, Sahanaja responded: &quot;the tape session research shows that [&#x27;I&#x27;m in Great Shape&#x27;] was definitely part of the &#x27;Heroes and Villains&#x27; variations, and so the decision [with &quot;The Smile Sessions&quot;] was to keep it within that context.&quot; The box set edition was packaged with two 7-inch vinyl records, one of which was a two-part edit of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; stretched across both sides. The edit was created by compilers Mark Linett and Alan Boyd.

Prior to the release of &quot;The Smile Sessions&quot;, in 1990, the &quot;Cantina&quot; mix was included on a &quot;two-fer&quot; reissue of &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; and &quot;Wild Honey&quot;. Many unreleased sections of the song were also compiled for the 1993 box set &quot;Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of the Beach Boys&quot;.

<text>Hōun Jiyu-Kennett (Japanese: 法雲慈友ケネット, 1 January 1924 – 6 November 1996), born Peggy Teresa Nancy Kennett, was a British roshi most famous for having been the first female to be sanctioned by the Sōtō School of Japan to teach in the West.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Hōun Jiyu-Kennett was born as Peggy Teresa Nancy Kennett in St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex, England on January 1, 1924. As a young woman she found herself questioning gender roles in society and grew to become disillusioned with Christianity. She studied medieval music at Durham University and then received a scholarship to Trinity College of Music in London, England. Though attracted to Buddhism, she felt during this period that she was called to serve the Church of England as a priest. However, church policies at the time did not allow women to be ordained, and this enhanced her previous disillusionment with Christianity.

===Training at &quot;Sojiji&quot;===
She first became interested in Theravada Buddhism during this period of questioning and searching, joining the London Buddhist Vihara. In 1954, she joined the London Buddhist Society, where she continued her Buddhist studies and lectured. While there, she met the scholar D.T. Suzuki, and developed a strong interest in Rinzai Zen Buddhism. In 1960, when chief abbott Kōho Keidō Chisan Zenji of Sojiji in Japan came to the society, she was asked to make the arrangements for his stay. Koho asked if she would consider becoming his student back in Japan. She accepted the offer, and two years passed before she arrived at Sojiji to study Soto Zen Buddhism under him.

In January 1962, Kennett traveled to Malaysia to accept an award she had been honored with for setting a Buddhist hymn, &quot;Welcome Joyous Wesak Day&quot; by Sumangalo, to music. Before leaving for Japan, Kennett was ordained a novice nun by Venerable Seck Kim Seng (釋金星; &quot;Shì Jīnxīng&quot;) in the Linji Chan school and given the Buddhist name Jiyu (慈友, &quot;Cíyou&quot; in Chinese, &quot;Jiyu&quot; in Japanese) meaning &quot;compassionate friend&quot;.

Jiyu-Kennett arrived in Japan in 1962, where she was also ordained in the Soto-school, and trained at Sōjiji from 1962 to 1963. Formally, Kōho Keidō Chisan Zenji was her teacher, but practically, one of Keido Zenji&#x27;s senior officers, Suigan Yogo roshi, was her main instructor, because &#x27;Keido Zenji was often preoccupied with administrative affairs. She received Dharma transmission twice, from Kōho Keidō Chisan Zenji on May 28, 1963, but also from Suigan Yogo.

While training at Sōjiji, Kōho Keidō Chisan let her take care of westerners who were interested in Zen training, mostly from American military bases, and she &quot;developed a regular programme of teaching and meditation to nurture their growing interest in Zen&quot;. Eventually, she received the official title of &quot;Foreign Guest Hall Master&quot; from Keido Chisan.

Jiyu-Kennett continued her institutional career by becoming an &quot;Oshō&quot;, i.e. &quot;priest&quot; or &quot;teacher&quot;. Her Zuise ceremony was conducted in public in Japan. Previously, women&#x27;s ceremonies were held in private, but Koho had decided that the practice of holding private ceremonies for women and public ceremonies for men was wrong. According to Jiyu-Kennett&#x27;s account, 
Following her &quot;Zuise&quot; ceremony, Jiyu-Kennett was installed as &quot;shinzan&quot; (head priest) of Unpukuji temple in Mie prefecture.

===Return to the west===
After the death of Chisan Koho, in November 1967, the Soto Administration Section became ambivalent to her, and &quot;Kennett&#x27;s title of Foreign Guest Hall Master was deleted from the list of Sojiji office appointments&quot;. Nevertheless, according to Jiyu-Kennett, she &quot;received a certificate asking me to become the official pioneer missionary of the Soto Sect
in America&quot; just before she left Japan for a lecturing tour the US in November 1969, At this time Jiyu-Kennett was not in good health, as during her time in Japan she had experienced many illnesses.

In 1969, Jiyu-Kennett founded the Zen Mission Society in San Francisco, and in 1970 Shasta Abbey in Mount Shasta, California, the first Zen monastery in the United States to be established by a woman. In 1972, Jiyu-Kennett&#x27;s British chapter of the Zen Mission Society established Throssel Hole Priory in Northumberland, England. In 1978 Jiyu-Kennett changed the name of the Zen Mission Society to the Order of Buddhist Contemplatives.

===Illness and visions===
In 1975, Jiyu-Kennett was stricken with illness yet again, and this time she became bedridden. In 1976, worn out and convinced death was near, she resigned from her position as abbess of Shasta Abbey and went into retreat in Oakland, California. Still rather ill, of unknown causes, she had her student Daizui MacPhillamy with her often to tend to her care. Following a kensho experience he had, she conferred Dharma transmission to him at her bedside in 1976.

During this retreat, Jiyu-Kennett had a prolonged religious experience, including a series of visions and recalling past lives. She regarded these experiences as &quot;a profound kensho (enlightenment) experience&quot;, constituting a third kensho, and published an account of these visions, and an elaborate scheme of stages of awakening, in &quot;How to Grow a Lotus Blossom&quot;. Her interpretations, which parallel Christian mysticism, were controversial, and rejected by some as &quot;makyo&quot; (&quot;illusion&quot;). Stephen Batchelor describes these episodes, 
Around four months into her &#x27;third kensho&#x27;, Jiyu-Kennett regained her health and again assumed her position as Abbess of Shasta Abbey for the next 20 years until her death on November 6, 1996. According to Jiyu-Kennett, her experiences are not uncommon, but are rarely spoken of; she regarded publishing her own experiences as a way to acknowledge the existence and validity of such experiences, which, according to her, may contribute to further insight after initial awakening. She acknowledged the risks and potential for controversy in publishing her account, but felt that the benefits of releasing such information outweighed the risks.

According to Kay, &quot;Kennett&#x27;s visionary experiences – and also her ambivalence about the status of their content – are not unprecedented within the Zen tradition. Soto literature includes numerous accounts, as noted especially by Faure (2000) &quot;Visions of power&quot;, described by the founders of Soto Zen, Dogen and Keizan. Dogen and Keizan &quot;also both warned against seeing visions or unusual spiritual experiences as the goal of practice&quot;. but were clear that such things can occur along the way.

==Teachings==
According to Jiyu-Kennett the accumulation of insight happens in three stages of kensho, along with a fourth that can occur at the time of death: 
# &quot;initial glimpse&quot; kensho, or &quot;great flash of deep understanding&quot;, that most Zen practitioners eventually experience, and that are often used in the Soto-tradition as the later basis for qualification for Dharma Transmission;
# &quot;On-Going Fūgen Kensho&quot;, or in D.T. Suzuki&#x27;s words, &quot;the little moments that make one dance&quot;, experienced by practitioners with a continual, stable practice;
# based on her personal experience with visions, Jiyu-Kennett postulated a third stage which involves the recalling of past life experiences, profound spiritual visions, and deep awakening experiences, that bring great clarity to aspects of the Dharma and practice, and go beyond what is experienced in the first kensho;
# parinirvana, experienced by rare practitioners who achieve Buddhahood upon time of death.
The third stage can include a &quot;Zen sickness&quot;, best known from Hakuin Zenji&#x27;s account in Yasen kanna, translated into English under the title Wild Ivy『夜船閑話』 (Quiet conversations on an evening boat)

==Teaching style==
Jiyu-Kennett had a commanding presence about her, both intellectually as well as physically. Of a rather husky build, she had a tremendous laughter and was known to be gifted at storytelling. In accordance with Shakyamuni Buddha&#x27;s teaching and practice of upaya/Skill in Means, Koho Zenji directed her to adapt Soto Zen to Western needs, and not stick with Japanese practice. She frequently used Western sayings, songs, and stories as koans.

According to the book &quot;The Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America&quot;, 
Jiyu-Kennett was an advocate for equality between the sexes, as was Great Master Dogen.

<doc id="1224604" wikidata="Q242769" url="?curid=1224604" title="Blanche of Artois">
<text>Blanche of Artois (; – 2 May 1302) was Queen of Navarre and Countess of Champagne and Brie during her marriage to Henry I of Navarre. After his death she became regent in the name of their infant daughter, Joan I. She passed on the regency of Navarre to Philip III of France, her cousin and her daughter&#x27;s prospective father-in-law, but retained the administration of Champagne. She later shared the government of Champagne with her second husband, Edmund, until her daughter reached the age of majority.

== Queenship ==

Blanche was the elder child and only daughter of Robert I, Count of Artois, and Matilda of Brabant. A fraternal niece of King Louis IX of France, Blanche was probably born in 1248. By February 1269, having received a papal dispensation, she was married to Henry, the brother of King Theobald II of Navarre. The ceremony took place in Melun near Paris. Her brother-in-law, in turn, was married to her cousin, Isabella of France. Henry was governing his brother&#x27;s realm when King Theobald and Queen Isabella left to join the Eighth Crusade. When the king died in December 1270, followed by his widow within a few months, Blanche&#x27;s husband became King of Navarre and Count of Champagne.

King Henry and Queen Blanche were a young couple with a son, Theobald, and the future of the House of Blois seemed bright. In 1273, however, they lost their son in an accident when the young Theobald was dropped by his nurse over the castle battlements. A daughter named Joan, born the same year, remained the royal couple&#x27;s only child and was recognized as heir presumptive by the King and the Estates. The following year, on 22 July, King Henry himself died. The death of two kings within five years and accession of an infant queen, the first woman to rule Navarre and Champagne alike, triggered a political crisis.

== Regency ==

Now queen dowager, Blanche became regent for her daughter. Her regency in Champagne was preceded by several long regencies of widowed mothers, but this was the first regency for a female ruler. The neighbouring kingdoms of Castile and Aragon moved to exploit the precarious situation. Both Alfonso X of Castile and Peter III of Aragon wanted to secure Navarre for their respective houses either by marriage with Joan or by force. While Peter contemplated a marriage with a cousin of Joan, Alfonso moved his army to Navarre and started besieging Viana. The citizens loyally defended the city, for which Queen Blanche thanked them by granting special privileges.

Blanche remained in Pamplona at least until 14 April, but then fled the kingdom, taking Joan with her, on the pretext of visiting her daughter&#x27;s fiefs in the north of France. In reality, she sought protection from her cousin, King Philip III of France. In November, she paid homage to him for her daughter&#x27;s French possessions. The almost immediate departure of both the monarch and the regent only complicated the situation in Navarre. In May 1275, Queen Blanche signed the Treaty of Orléans, by which she promised Joan&#x27;s hand in marriage to one of the older two sons of the King of France, either Louis or Philip. The elder died within a year, and Philip was left as both heir to the French throne and Joan&#x27;s bridegroom. Blanche administered Joan&#x27;s territories from Paris, appointing governors for Navarre. Later this role was taken over by Joan&#x27;s prospective father-in-law, while Blanche retained the administration of Champagne and Brie.

== English marriage ==

Between 28 July and 29 October 1276, in Paris, Blanche became the second wife of Edmund Crouchback, brother of King Edward I of England. The marriage was orchestrated by the dowager queen of France Margaret of Provence, who wished to secure a wealthy bride for her nephew. There are also reports, however, that the two married out of mutual attraction. Edmund joined Blanche in administering Champagne and Brie. Edmund and Blanche had four children: Mary, who died young, Thomas, Henry and John.

When Joan became old enough to marry and take full control of her inheritance, in 1284, Blanche and Edmund had to give up the counties. They were compensated by Blanche&#x27;s dower, a hefty sum of money and the right to use the palace of the Navarrese kings in Paris. The following year, Philip III died and was succeeded by Blanche&#x27;s son-in-law, Philip IV.

When hostilities broke out between England and France in 1293, Edmund and Blanche left Paris and moved to England. They returned to France in 1296 but resided in King Edward&#x27;s continental possessions, where Edmund served as lieutenant of Gascony. Blanche was widowed again in June the same year when Edmund died during the siege of Bordeaux. She returned to her brother-in-law&#x27;s court in November but did not stay in England for long. She received her dower, consisting of one third of all of Edmund&#x27;s lands and all his rights in the earldom of Ferrers, and in 1298 she was back in France. She founded a Franciscan abbey in Nogent-l&#x27;Artaud in 1299, dedicated to Saint Louis IX of France, and declared her wish to be buried there rather than with her second husband in London or with her first husband in Provins. Queen Blanche&#x27;s body is buried at the Cordeliers Convent in Paris, where her daughter was later buried beside her.

<doc id="1224611" wikidata="Q865555" url="?curid=1224611" title="Birkenhead, New Zealand">
<text>Birkenhead is a suburb of Auckland, in northern New Zealand. It is located on the North Shore of the Waitematā Harbour, northwest of the Auckland City Centre. The area has been settled by Tāmaki Māori since at least the 14th century, and is the location of , a fortified pā for Te Kawerau ā Maki that overlooked an important seasonal shark fishery. European settlement in Birkenhead began in late the 1840s, and by the late 19th century the area became renowned for strawberry crops. In 1884, the Chelsea Sugar Refinery was constructed in Birkenhead, becoming a major source of income for Birkenhead. The increased population growth led to Birkenhead becoming one of the first boroughs of Auckland in 1888. Birkenhead transitioned from a semi-rural community to suburban Auckland after the opening of the Auckland Harbour Bridge in 1959, becoming a city in 1978. In 1989, Birkenhead City was amalgamated with North Shore City.

==Etymology==

The name Birkenhead first appears in relation to a land survey conducted by Charles Heaphy in the summer of 1862 and 1863. The origin is unknown, but it possibly stems from the geographical similarities the area has to Birkenhead in North West England, which is on the opposite shore of the River Mersey to Liverpool. Similar locations can be found in Adelaide and Sydney in Australia. A common story explaining the origins of the suburb&#x27;s name involves land developer Samuel Cochrane choosing the name in memory of his hometown, but this story appears to be apocryphal, as Cochrane was a Londoner and did not have ties to Liverpool. The first mentions in press of Birkenhead were real estate advertisements placed by Samuel Cochrane in June 1863.

==Geography==
The Birkenhead area is primarily uplifted Waitemata Group sandstone, that was deposited on the sea floor during the Early Miocene, between 22 and 16 million years ago. Prior to human settlement, the inland North Shore was a mixed podocarp-broadleaf forest dominated by kauri. Pōhutukawa trees dominated the coastal margins of Birkenhead. Some kauri remnant forest remains in areas around Birkenhead, including Kauri Park, Le Roys Bush, Kauri Point Domain, Kauri Glen and Eskdale Reserve.

Highbury is a suburb located within Birkenhead, which refers to the older shopping centre at the junction of Birkenhead Avenue and Mokoia Road. The name Highbury was the name of Thomas Forgham&#x27;s family residence, that was constructed in early colonial Birkenhead. The name of the house was chosen by English immigrant William Francis Hammond, Forgham&#x27;s son-in-law, in memory of Highbury, Hammond&#x27;s parents&#x27; townhouse in Highgate, London.

The highest point in the suburb is the hill in eastern Eskdale Reserve, which reaches a height of above sea-level in the neighbouring suburb of Hillcrest.

== History ==
===Māori history===
Māori settlement of the Auckland Region began around the 13th or 14th centuries. The North Shore was settled by Tāmaki Māori, including people descended from the &quot;Tainui&quot; migratory canoe and ancestors of figures such as Taikehu and Peretū. Many of the early Tāmaki Māori people of the North Shore identified as Ngā Oho.

Boat Rock (, &quot;The Rat&#x27;s Tooth&quot;) in the Waitematā Harbour southwest of Birkenhead was a location of great significance to Tāmaki Māori. The rock was the location where Te Arawa chief Kahumatamomoe placed a mauri stone (a stone of religious significance), naming the Waitematā (&quot;The Waters of the Stone&quot;) after the mauri stone.

The warrior Maki migrated from the Kāwhia Harbour to his ancestral home in the Auckland Region, likely sometime in the 17th century. Maki conquered and unified many the Tāmaki Māori tribes as Te Kawerau ā Maki, including those of the North Shore. After Maki&#x27;s death, his sons settled different areas of his lands, creating new hapū. His younger son Maraeariki settled the North Shore and Hibiscus Coast, who based himself at the head of the Ōrewa River. Maraeariki&#x27;s daughter Kahu succeeded him, and she is the namesake of the North Shore, (&quot;The Greater Lands of Kahu&quot;). Many of the iwi of the North Shore, including Ngāti Manuhiri, Ngāti Maraeariki, Ngāti Kahu, Ngāti Poataniwha, Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki and Ngāti Whātua, can trace their lineage to Kahu.

The poor clay soils of the inland forest of the hindered development. Most Māori settlements of the Birkenhead area focused on fishing and harvesting food from the forests. The focal point of Te Kawerau ā Maki on the North Shore was (&quot;The Brow of Mana&quot;), a headland pā at Kauri Point in modern-day Chatswood, and (&quot;Wind Shelter&quot;), the kāinga below the cliffs at Kendall Bay. was named after the ancestor Manaoterangi, who was the rangatira of the pā in the mid-18th century, and was likely constructed in the 17th century. The pā was of strategic importance due to its commanding view of the Waitematā Harbour, and its proximity to a renowned , a shark fishery which brought seasonal visitors from across Tāmaki Makurau and the Hauraki Gulf in the summer, including important rangatira such as Kiwi Tāmaki and later Tarahawaiki.

Manaoterangi was a close relative of Tuperiri of the Te Taoū/Ngāti Whātua ragatira Tuperiri, and was married to Waikahuia, the sister of Waiohua paramount chief Kiwi Tāmaki. Because of this, the pā and Mana&#x27;s people were spared during the conflicts between Te Taoū and Waiohua in the mid-18th century, and at the end of his life, Manaoterangi entrusted his people to Tuperiri and the iwi that grew to become Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei.

By the early 19th century, the eastern headlands the Upper Waitematā Harbour, including along Oruamo or Hellyers Creek were some of the most densely settled areas of the North Shore by Tāmaki Māori. Oruamo or Hellyers Creek was an important transportation node for the North Shore area.

In the latter 18th and early 19th centuries, members of Te Taoū/Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei resided seasonally at . During the early 1820s, most Māori of the North Shore fled for the Waikato or Northland due to the threat of war parties during the Musket Wars. and were raided and destroyed in a night raid around the year 1823.

When Tāmaki Māori returned in greater numbers to the Auckland Region, and were occupied again, until the early 1840s. The shark fishery remained an important location for many decades onwards. In 1844, when Tāmaki Māori held the feast of Remuera, sharks were caught for the event at this fishery, and considerable numbers of Māori fishing boats fished the area as late as the 1860s.

Outside of and , other known locations of significance to Tāmaki Māori around Birkenhead include or was the name of a pā located inland on the Kauri Point ridge, and , an inland pā where people would stay seasonally, to snare kākā in the wooded vallies of . The traditional names for the bays of the area include (Chelsea), (Onetaunga and Soldiers Bay), (Island Bay), (Charcoal Bay) and (the bay north of Charcoal Bay).

===Early European settlement===
Birkenhead was a part of the Mahurangi Block, an area purchased by the Crown on 13 April 1841. Land speculators purchased much of the isolated forests of Birkenhead in 1843, and the first permanent settlers arrived in 1849.

Major Collings Ann de Jersey Grut emigrated to New Zealand in the 1850s from the Channel Islands, alongside her husband Major Collings de Jersey Grut and brother Charles D&#x27;Auvergne. The de Jersey Grut family established a farm and manor near Duck Creek in the 1850s, but struggled to establish a farm. The poor soil led to starvation, and the servants needing to share food with the de Jersey Grut family members, and cattle would often wander off into the bush. The de Jersey Grut family left in 1865, and had their house shipped to Orewa.

Henry James Hawkins, established a fruit orchard in the Birkenhead area in the 1850s. Despite the poor clay soil, Hawkins became a famed horticulturalist, winning prizes for crops such as apples, plums, peas, gooseberries, strawberries. Fruit became a major industry for Birkenhead from the 1860s, notably apples, pears, and two varieties of strawberry, Marguerite and Duke of Edinburgh, which flourished well in clay soils.

Birkenhead was subdivided and promoted as a township from 1863, alongside other settlements such as Allandale and Balmain (neither of which eventuated). Residents of the village survived through subsistence farming, and profited from bountiful seasonal strawberry crops.

In 1879, William Francis Hammond bought at Birkenhead Point, establishing Raven Hill estate, followed by Charles E. Button who established a second grand house at Birkenhead Point in 1883. Hammond, the son of a London auctioneer, was a keen promoter of Birkenhead, surveying the area and promoting Birkenhead subdivisions and estates at auctions, and constructing a bridge across Little Shoal Bay, better connecting the community to Northcote.

Lake Road, connecting Northcote and Birkenhead, was significantly improved in the 1870s, helping development in Birkenhead. This was aided further by the Auckland Harbour Board constructed a wharf in 1882, which was followed by a post office in 1884. The new wharf allowed orchardists in Birkenhead to better transport produce to the Auckland market, further helped by larger orchardists building their own jetties on Oruamo or Hellyers Creek in the north. In 1886, the Birkenhead and Northcote Fruitgrowing Association was formed.

By the 1880s, itinerant gum diggers roamed Birkenhead, searching for kauri gum. Birkenhead residents loathed the gum diggers, who would often destroy roads, orchards and farms in order to locate kauri gum. In response, the Waitemata County Council lobbied the Crown to allow the country more direct control over the gum digging industry.

===Chelsea Sugar Refinery and Birkenhead Borough===

In 1881, the Australasian Colonial Sugar Refining Company chose Birkenhead for the site of a new sugar refining factory, after founder Edward Knox visited Auckland. The refinery was chosen due to Auckland&#x27;s relative proximity to the sugarcane plantations of Fiji, and south-eastern Birkenhead was chosen as it was one of the few deep water anchorages of the Waitematā Harbour, and due to its proximity to the fresh water Duck Creek. The factory opened in 1884, and by 1888 had greatly increased production. The factory continues to be the largest single site industrial facility on the North Shore.

The establishment of Chelsea Sugar Refinery led to a population explosion in Birkenhead and the surrounding areas, and led to Birkenhead developing into a suburban township. In the mid-1880s, a factory village was constructed adjacent for workers at the factory. Mr Judd, the first customs officer, successfully convinced the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to call both the factory and adjacent company village Chelsea, after his hometown in England.

On 12 April 1888, with only 330 ratepayers living in the area, the Borough of Birkenhead was established as one of the earliest boroughs of Auckland. Birkenhead was one of the largest boroughs of New Zealand in area size, and tensions existed between the township at Highbury and more rural Birkdale. Highbury residents wanted more funding to be put aside for urban projects such as improved footpaths, frustrating rural Birkdale residents, who needed better rural roads, especially during the strawberry harvesting season.

In 1885, the Zion Hill Methodist Church was constructed, becoming a major focal point for social life in Birkenhead. The church visually dominated Birkenhead due to its position on the hill, and was a strong voice for the temperance movement, lobbying against hotels from being established in Birkenhead. The church and Chelsea Sugar Refinery were the two largest influences on life for Birkenhead residents at the turn of the 20th century.

===Fruit canning and the Sugar Workers Union===
By the 1890s, Birkenhead became so well-known for strawberry farms that daytrippers and picknickers would travel to Birkenhead for the growing season. Growers were increasingly frustrated with the high cost of transporting fruit, and many began establishing canning and jam production operations. One of these operations was Thompson&#x27;s, which began as a home operation in Birkenhead in 1898. By the following year, the firm moved to a factory on Nelson Street in the Auckland City Centre, growing to become Thompson &amp; Hills, one of the largest canning factories and jam producers in New Zealand in the early 20th century.

Growers struggled with poor apple and pear crops due to codling moths, so by 1900 turned to growing nectarines and plums. Commercial fruitgrowing increasingly disappeared from Birkenhead by the 1910s, after becoming unprofitable.

By the turn of the century, Birkenhead had developed into three centres: suburban Birkenhead, rural Birkdale and Chelsea, adjacent to the refinery. The factory provided steady work for the community, employing a third of the workforce of Birkenhead, and allowing farmers and orchardists stability in years with poorer crops. The ferry service brought new residents to the area who commuted to Auckland for work, although fewer than neighbouring Devonport; only three stores were located in Birkenhead in 1901. The Birkenhead ferry developed a café atmosphere for the commuters, which included string instrument players, and a smokers cabin, where man of Birkenhead discussed politics.

Workers at the factory complained of poor conditions, such as 58-hour work weeks, and unsafe conditions in the wash house, where employers would be dismissed if they stopped working due to heat exhaustion. In 1901, the Sugar Workers Union was formed, pushing for safer conditions and a reduction to a 48-hour work week. In 1905, the Chelsea workers village was condemned. Following this, Chelsea factory management established the HAWE (Housing Assistance for Wage Earners) Scheme in 1910, where workers were provided with low-interest loans to construct or buy houses close to the refinery.

In 1910, the Wragge Institute and Museum and Waiata Tropical Gardens were established in Awanui Street. Run by British meteorologist and spiritualist Clement Lindley Wragge and his Anglo-Indian de facto partner Louisa &quot;Edris&quot; Emmeline Horne, the gardens featured a wide range of exotic edible plants and palm trees, becoming a well-known tourist spot. The centre promoted the planting of palm trees around Auckland.

===Cinema and World Wars===
In 1911, the Ancient Order of Foresters built a hall on Hinemoa Street in Birkenhead. In the following year, theatre company manager Henry John Hayward, who lived at Birkenhead, began showing films at Foresters Hall in 1912. Birkenhead became the second suburb of Auckland to have a cinema, and by the 1920s the Foresters Hall had become a major attraction for people across Auckland to attend dances and film showings.

By 1913, Birkenhead had grown to have 12 stores (compared to 42 in Devonport), including the 1913 Hellaby&#x27;s butchery, the first building with a tiled ceiling constructed in Australasia. An increased population led to plans for a new school to open in 1914 on a portion of Edward Skeate&#x27;s Highbury estate, but plans for a school were delayed until 1919, due to the outbreak of World War I. 261 men and boys from Birkenhead served in the war. This greatly affected the community, which was further impacted by the 1918 flu pandemic.

Highbury developed more commercial and residential housing in the 1920s, and was the location of the Birkenhead Borough Chambers. From 1959, the stores of Highbury began declining due to the opening of the Auckland Harbour Bridge, despite an explosion of population growth in the surrounding suburbs. A small state housing area was constructed at Hammond Place, and in the mid-1970s the Highbury Bypass was constructed, linking Mokoia Road to Onewa Road, without the need to drive through Highbury.

In December 1926, electricity was first installed in Birkenhead, and in January 1934 water infrastructure was greatly improved. Having used water piped from Lake Pupuke until this time, the pipe pumped water from Western Springs to Birkenhead under the Waitematā Harbour, and was the longest pipe of its kind when installed.

Farms in Birkenhead offered increasingly poor harvests through the 1920s, due to the soil being overworked. Farmers turned away from strawberries, growing crops such as pumpkins and tomatoes instead. By the 1930s during the Great Depression, many farms had become unprofitable. During these times, the Birkenhead Borough operated an unemployment loan scheme for residents, and relief workers worked on infrastructure projects including drain digging, clearing scrubland and improving roads. The last commercial strawberry fields were removed in the 1940s.

In 1938 on the eve of World War II, the New Zealand Government established the Kauri Point Armament Depot at Birkenhead. 332 soldiers and one nurse from Birkenhead enlisted, of whom 29 died. Chelsea Sugar Refinery workers were protected from enlistment, and many residents serves as a part of the Home Guard. While never employed, the Home Guard dug anti-tank tranches on the Glenfield ridge, and practiced warfare at Eskdale Reserve. Many women of Birkenhead took up jobs traditionally held by men, including working at the offices and golden syrup room at Chelsea Sugar Refinery, and working at the Kauri Point Armament Depot. The arrival of American troops in Auckland helped Birkenhead flowers, due to the increased need for fresh food and flowers.

===Suburban development===
In the 1950s, Birkenhead was a semi-rural area of Auckland, with only the areas close to the Birkenhead Wharf having a suburban atmosphere. In 1959, the Auckland Harbour Bridge opened, which rapidly brought Birkenhead closer to Auckland. The North Shore wharves of the Waitematā Harbour stopped being major transport nodes, and instead, areas with views of the Waitematā Harbour rose in importance for suburban housing. From 1960, the Birkenhead Borough Council encouraged construction of low-cost suburban houses in the borough, and a small state housing area was constructed at Hammond Place (near Highbury Pass).

Birkenhead&#x27;s population and commercial centre rapidly developed in the 1970s, helped in part by the development of Wairau Valley as an industrial park. From the 1970s, Samoan New Zealander and Urban Māori communities developed around Birkenhead, many of whom worked at Wairau Valley and the Sugar Refinery. After the population exceeded 20,000 people, Birkenhead Borough became the City of Birkenhead in 1978.

In the mid-1980s, the Borough Council planned to develop a new supermarket at Highbury, to counteract commercial decline. In 1989, Highbury became a part of North Shore City, and the new city council began planning the Strawberry Fields Shopping Centre from 1990, with Countdown as an anchor store. On 8 May 1995, the shopping centre formally opened, now named Highpoint Shopping Centre. In 1997 after expansions, the mall was renamed Birkenhead Shopping Centre, and later renamed to Highbury Shopping Centre in the mid-2000s. By the 2000s, Birkenhead Town Centre had developed a restaurant culture.

In November 2010, the suburb was included into the North Shore ward, one of the thirteen administrative divisions of the newly-formed Auckland Council. Under the council, Birkenhead is part of the Kaipātiki Local Board Area.

==Local government==

The first local government in the area was the North Shore Highway District, which began operating in 1868 and administered roading and similar projects across the North Shore. From 1876, Birkenhead was also a part of the Takapuna Riding of Waitemata County; a large rural county north and west of the city of Auckland. In 1884 the Birkenhead Road District split from the North Shore Highway District.

On 12 April 1888, with only 330 ratepayers the Birkenhead Road District became the Borough of Birkenhead, one of the earliest boroughs of Auckland. The borough had a mayor and a local council, and was able to make more decisions on how to invest in the area. After 90 years due to major growth in the mid-20th century, Birkenhead became a city on 15 March 1978, with a population of 20,000 people. In 1989, Birkenhead was merged into the North Shore City. North Shore City was amalgamated into Auckland Council in November 2010.

Within the Auckland Council, Birkenhead is a part of the Kaipātiki local government area governed by the Kaipātiki Local Board. It is a part of the North Shore ward, which elects two councillors to the Auckland Council.

<text>The Ayres Thrush, formerly the Snow S-2, Aero Commander Ag Commander, and Rockwell Thrush Commander, is an American agricultural aircraft produced by Ayres Corporation and more recently by Thrush Aircraft. It is one of the most successful and long-lived agricultural application aircraft types in the world, with almost 2,000 sold since the first example flew years ago. Typical of agricultural aircraft, it is a single-seat monoplane of conventional taildragger configuration. Originally powered by a radial piston engine, most examples produced since the 1980s have been turboprop-powered.

==Design and development==
The Thrush, designed by Leland Snow, first flew in 1956 and before long was being produced in series as the S-2 by the company he founded, Snow Aeronautical. In 1965, the corporation and all of its assets were purchased by the Aero Commander division of Rockwell, which put it into production alongside the CallAir A-9 that it had also acquired, branding both unrelated (though similar) machines as &quot;Ag Commanders&quot;. When Rockwell dropped the Aero Commander brand, the S-2 was renamed the &quot;Thrush Commander&quot;.

In 1977, Rockwell sold off the production rights to the aircraft and the production facility at Albany, Georgia, which were purchased by Ayres Corporation, a firm which had been built on retro-fitting turboprop engines to Thrush Commanders. On June 30, 2003, Ayres&#x27; assets were purchased by Thrush Aircraft, the current producer of the aircraft.

The S-2 and its several variants have been purchased by agricultural spraying operators in many countries. Large numbers are operated in the United States and Australia, while other countries using the type include Costa Rica, France, Guyana, Iran, Israel, Jamaica, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

Ayres developed a special anti-narcotics crop-spraying version of the Turbo-Thrush for the United States Department of State. This version, known as the Narcotics Eradication Delivery System (NEDS) featured an armored cockpit and engine to protect against hostile ground fire. Nine were sold to the Department of State between 1983 and 1985. Ayres also attempted to market a militarized version as the Ayres Vigilante, intended for the Close Air Support role, but this failed to attract customers. IOMAX USA of North Carolina, which had previously modified Air Tractor AT-802 agricultural aircraft as reconnaissance/attack aircraft, has developed the Archangel attack aircraft modeled on the S-2R-660. The United Arab Emirates has ordered 24 Archangels, with delivery from June 2015.

Two Thrush 510Gs were modified to perform a counter-insurgency role by the Austrian company Airborne Technologies at the direction of Erik Prince, the former head of Blackwater, but in the absence of an export license the aircraft have not been used operationally.

<doc id="1224622" wikidata="Q7579069" url="?curid=1224622" title="Spoof (game)">
<text>Spoof is a strategy game, typically played as a gambling game, often in bars and pubs where the loser buys the other participants a round of drinks. The exact origin of the game is unknown, but one scholarly paper addressed it, and more general &quot;n&quot;-coin games, in 1959. It is an example of a zero-sum game. The version with three coins is sometimes known under the name Three Coin.

== Gameplay ==
Spoof is played by any number of players in a series of rounds. In each round the objective is to guess the aggregate number of coins held in concealment by all the players, with each player being allowed to conceal up to three coins in their hand. (Some versions of the game may vary this number.) The coins may be of any denomination, and the values of the coins are irrelevant: in fact, any suitable objects could be used in place of coins, e.g. matches.

For the first round an initial player is selected in some fashion, such as spinning a burnt match to see who it points at.

At the beginning of every round each player conceals a quantity of coins, or no coins at all, in their closed fist, extended into the circle of play. The initial player calls what they think is the total number of coins in play. Play proceeds clockwise around the circle until each player has ventured a call regarding the total number of coins, and no player can call the same total as any other player. The call of &quot;Spoof!&quot; is sometimes used to mean &quot;zero&quot;.

After all players have made their calls, they open their fists and display their coins for the group to count the total. It is illegal for a player to open their hand without making a call. The player who has correctly guessed the total number of coins withdraws from the game and the remainder of the group proceeds to the next round. If no player guesses the total correctly, the entire group continues play in the next round. The starting player for each subsequent round is the next remaining player, clockwise from the starter of the previous round.

Play continues until all players have been eliminated except for one, whereupon that last remaining player pays the stipulated stakes to each other player. In some versions of the game additional rules are used, such as &quot;no gloating&quot; (a leaving player is not allowed to celebrate), or left-handed play.

==Mathematical analysis==
This first guesser has the initial advantage in that all possible sums are available for his guess, but also lacks insight into what the others might be holding, as indicated by their subsequent guesses. Some variants also have the &#x27;no bum shouts&#x27; or impossible call rule whereby a player cannot call more than the total number of coins possible taking into account what they have in their hand (e.g. if there are 5 players and they hold 1 coin, the maximum number to call would be 13).

The generalized (&quot;n&quot;-coin) two player version of this game was the subject of a paper in 1959.
It was shown that for every &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1 this game is a &quot;fair game&quot;, i.e. each player has a mixed strategy that guarantees their expected payout is at most zero to his or her opponent.

== Tournament play==
The World Spoofing Championship has taken place every year since 1983 in many different venues across the world.

Many countries hold national or regional spoofing championships with the UK being the oldest having first taken place in 1974.
The Bangkok Gentlemen Spoofers founded in 1988 is the longest running spoofing school in South East Asia. They hold two annual tournaments, the Thai National Championships and the Asian Spoofing Championships.

The original national UK Spoof Championship celebrated its 41st anniversary in 2015 with the tournament held at Cambridge Rugby Club on 16 October. The &quot;Weald of Kent Spoof Championships&quot; has been held annually at &quot;The Bull at Benenden&quot; in Benenden, Kent since 2007, with 32 players taking part in 2010.

== In popular culture ==
James Bond plays the game against Felix Leiter in the 2021 film &quot;No Time to Die&quot;. Actor Daniel Craig was taught the game by his father, a pub landlord.

The fourth episode of the eighth season of New Zealand detective drama series &quot;The Brokenwood Mysteries&quot; was set at a world championship match where the winner was then murdered.

Joan Crawford wins a round of the game against Jack Palance in the 1952 film &quot;Sudden Fear&quot;. In the film, the game is played with matches and is introduced as &quot;The Match Game.&quot;

<text>Ngaraard is one of the 16 states of the Republic of Palau, and was originally named Kerradel. 

==History==
Ngaraard&#x27;s history can be divided into four eras corresponding to Spanish, German and Japanese domination up to World War II.

=== Spanish colonization ===
During the Spanish era between the 16th century and 1899 a priest named Father Luis lived in Elab teaching Christianity. However, the people from Ngaraard did not accept Christianity, so he went to Melekeok to Chief Reklai, but no one there accepted it either, so he left for Ngchesar. On his way to Ngchesar, he became lost and fell ill. Chief Reklai heard about Father Luis so he sent people to look for him. They found Father Luis very sick, and the Melekeokians cared for him until he died. He was buried crosswise, unlike everyone else at the Uudes burial ground.

=== German possession ===
During the German era, the Germans passed laws that Palauans must work to grow various plants, those refusing would be sent to Ngebuked for imprisonment. This is one reasons explaining the many coconuts in Palau. Germans also outlawed marriage and any religion except Catholicism. Some people of Ngaraard moved to Angaur to work in the phosphate mines. Later, doctors from Angaur traveled to Ngebuked because of an outbreak of leprosy, sending the sick to Melekeok for healing. The leprosy outbreak resulted in the deaths of many Palauans.

=== Japanese possession ===
During the Japanese era, there was a Japanese school in Ulimang, Ngaraard, offering primary education for first, second, and third grades. Students at the school came from Ngardmau, Ngerchelong, Kayangel and Ngaraard. Every morning students had assembly and they would bow to the Japanese as a sign of their respect and loyalty to the Japanese Emperor. Students found ignorant of their lessons would be punished by standing outside all day staring at the sun, or being forced to carry buckets of water up and down stairs for hours on end.

Ngaraard had two stores, the first selling sweets and clothing materials. The Nanboyeki store bought coconuts from all the islands. People lacking money could exchange coconuts for cloth. Many people from Ngaraard went to work at Angaur for phosphate mining; others went to Ngardmau to work on bauxite and some went to work for Nanboyeki. There were also Spanish priests in Koror who traveled to the islands propagating Christianity. When World War I started in Palau, people from Ngerchelong and Peleliu arrived in Ngaraard, where Taro Matsuda, Maderangebuked&#x27;s younger brother, found families to host them.

==== World War II ====
When World War II began, most people fled to the jungles of Ngebuked. People wanting to go to the taro patch or go fishing needed permission from Japanese soldiers. When they finished working the taro patch or fishing they had to report to the Japanese soldiers, informing them they were finished. When American attacks began, people from Ngaraard were terrified because none had seen airplanes before. They called them &quot;big bird with fire&quot; (). During that time, food ran short because the Japanese kept taking food from the Palauans. The people of Ngaraard left at night to find food because the American planes would not come, but they had to be careful because if Japanese soldiers saw them they would be killed.

The Japanese were ordered to collect Palauans and kill them. Japanese soldiers met with the Palau chiefs to discuss where to house the Peleliu people, because they planned to make Peleliu their military base. None of the chiefs wished to house the Peleliu people. Maderangebuked volunteered to take the Peleliu people, since Ngaraard had large taro patches and farms to produce food. This is why the Ngaraard people and Peleliu people have a special friendship.

There is Odesangel stone, this is an old name of Peleliu standing by Bai ra Ngaruau. The people of Peleliu who were in Ngebuked during the war carved the Odesangel Bad. They carved the stone as a memorial of the time they came out from hiding. &quot;Odesangel Bad, 1945 28/9&quot; is carved on the stone, showing that the people of Peleliu and those from Ngebuked and others that were hiding in the jungle emerged from their hiding place on September 28, 1945.

== Geography ==
Ngaraard has a tropical climate. The temperature ranges from a high of 83°F to a low of 81°F. Rainfall takes place from May to January and the heaviest rain is in June and July. The climate is dry from February until April.

Ngaraard is situated near the northern end of Babeldaob island where the land thins to a narrow neck before expanding at the border with Ngerchelong. To the south, along the borders with Ngiwal and Ngardmau, there are dense stands of forest on the rolling hills. Along the east coast, there are long stretches of sandy coastal plains while on the west coast, there is a thick fringe of mangroves. The modern villages of Ngebuked, Ulimang, Ngesang and Chelab form a cluster about halfway from north to south, with Chol and Ngkeklau at the northern and southern ends, respectively. The major rivers are the Desengong and the Ouang both flowing into the bay northwest of the state. Other drainages are short and steep. The Rael Kedam divides the state but becomes a low saddle at Ngebuked.

There are five hamlets in Ngaraard, including Choll, Elab, Ngebuked, Ngkeklau and the state capital, Ulimang, located on the eastern shore of the state. Previously, the capital of Ngaraard was the village of Ngebuked, where the traditional leader of the state, Maderangebuked, lived and reigned. There is a saying in Ngaraard, , meaning &quot;everyone works together as one in spirit and in the heart.&quot;

A system of trails links the modern villages, with short pieces of a bladed road in Chol and from Ngebuked to Ulimang. As of 1993, plans are being made for a road system through Ngaraard which will be a part of the major trans-Babeldaob road.

Presently, most of the use of the land in Ngaraard is confined to gardens surrounding the modern villages. Interspersed with these kitchen gardens are stands of agroforest which include coconut, betelnut, breadfruit, almond trees, and banana plants. In and around many of the uninhabited villages are stands of coconut and betelnut palms, and occasionally patches of irregularly attended taro swamp gardens. Except for occasional forays to hunt pigeon or harvest special plants, there is little active use of most of the interior of Ngaraard.

== Demography ==
The population of the state was 413 in the 2015 census and median age was 37.9 years. The official languages of the state are Palauan and English.

The population of Ngaraard has changed considerably over the years. In June 1972, the resident population was 1,063. In 1990, its population was 440 and in 1996, it decreased to 360. In 2000, it had increased to 638. 

=== Villages ===
The inhabited villages of Ngaraard State include the following (from north to south):
Choll,
Elab,
Ulimang,
Ngebuked, and
Ngkeklau.

There are many important places in the State of Ngaraard. There are the traditional village sites of Elab, Chetoilechang, Diong er Ngerchokl, Bai ra Ngaruau, Chelsel a Beluu er Ngebuked, Diong era Imeduurang, Ulimang. Ulimang is said to be the child of god Chuab. Other important places include: Head Start, the elementary school and Bethania High School, a hospital, Bai ra Rubak, the Ngaraard State Office at Koror, Bem Yore and the stores.

The lifestyle of Ngaraard has changed a lot due to the introduction of modern technology, including computers, telephones, electricity and televisions. Due to the construction of roads, the majority of people in the state now use cars for transportation rather than boats. However boats are still used for fishing.

==Political system==
Ngaraard has its own constitution, adopted in 1981. The state government was established in 1982. The state of Ngaraard, with population of less than 450, has an elected chief executive, governor. The state also has a legislature elected every four years. The state population elects one of the member in the House of Delegates of Palau.

==Cultural background and organization==
There are more than two dozen traditional village sites within Ngaraard. These traditional villages represent important symbols giving identity to families, clans and regions. Within villages are numerous stone features with historical and traditional importance. Many of the stone platforms, odesongel, serve as clan cemeteries, and other stone features serve as shrines. The lagoon is an important resource area, and was probably intensively exploited prehistorically. There are profound differences between the east coast lagoon and the west coast lagoon, and Ngaraard&#x27;s strategic position would have been ideal to take full advantage of these resources. Near the traditional villages are taro swamp gardens, and surrounding most village sites are garden plots and terraced hillsides.

It is said that the Ngebuked people were originally from Angaur, living on a mountain called Roisbuked. When Roisbuked became overpopulated and there was limited land for crops or food, the people from Angaur began looking for another island to live on. After leaving Roisbuked, they moved to Peleliu, called Ngerchol. When Ngerchol could not hold anymore people, they moved to Babeldaob, landing in a place between Melekeok and Ngaraard. After landing, they walked toward Ngiwal, but Ngiwal&#x27;s inhabitants were unwelcoming so they moved to Ngaraard in Ngeteluang.

Ngebuked was divided into two sections, &quot;bita el ked ma bita el ked&quot;. The chief of one section was Kerai and in the other section was an old woman named Romei. When Romei could not hold all the responsibilities as chief, she asked Oiseuang, another older woman to rule. Two brothers from Ngeruangel sailed by and saw smoke rising at Ngebuked, so they stopped to get supplies. The older brother liked what he saw at Ngebuked and decided to stay; the younger brother traveled to other areas of Babeldaob. The younger brother ended up in Melekeok and became Chief of Melekeok and the older brother stayed in Ngebuked.

Oiseuang aged and could not perform her chiefly duties, so she looked for a person able to perform the work as the chief. She visited a man she felt was competent and asked if he would become a chief, and he asked he could be named Mad. Chief Mad united the two sections into one village of Ngebuked and so he became Mad ra Ngebuked. Kerai remained village head, meaning that when there was a contribution of food, he still received the portion for the first title, but the one who has the authority and power over Ngebukedd is Maderangebuked. Therefore, the order of chiefly title is that the first title is Maderangebuked, the second title is Kerai and the third is Techur. Techur had clan members from Ngeaur, Airai and Ngerchelong. Therefore, if a member from Angaur assumed the title then he would be called Techureaur, if a clan member from Ngerchelong assumed the title he would be called Techurchelong, and if he was from Airai he would be called Techurrulak.

== Economy ==
Ngaraard has many natural resources, mainly forests and water. The landscape is mostly mountainous forest, sandy beaches on Desbedall and mangroves on the Keiukel side. There are many living things in Ngaraard&#x27;s land, including fruit bats, pigeons, starlings, pigs, mangrove crabs, land crabs, cone shells (), shrimp in the creek, banded snakes (), aquatic snakes (), dogs, and cats. There are also many varieties of insects, including mosquitoes, wasps, bees, and many more.

One of the famous crops of Ngaraard is taro and its recipe, which uses taro leaves, coconut milk and land crab, is called . These are some other crops of Ngaraard: swamp cabbage (), tapioca (), sweet potato (), giant swamp taro (), banana, calamondin (), breadfruits, , amra tree (), Eugenia plant (), wax apple (), betelnut tree and pepper leaf (). Ngaraard has a rich soil and plenty of crops but only a few vegetables.

== Education ==
The Ministry of Education operates public schools.

Ngaraard Elementary School was established after World War II, circa 1947, using a school building opened during the Japanese South Seas Mandate rule. In addition to Ngaraard, it served Kayangel, Ngarchelong, and Ngiwal.

Palau High School in Koror is the country&#x27;s only public high school, so children from this community go there.

==Flag==
Ngaraard recently changed its flag. It is made of a golden-yellow star on a field of deep sky blue. Behind the star, it has a red stripe from the bottom left corner to the upper right corner of the flag. The star stands for the unity of Ngaraard State, and the five fingers of the star stand for the five counties or hamlets of Ngaraard. The stripe of the flag shows that the state has both the east and west coast of northern Babeldaob and is striving for success. The blue background symbolizes the blue of the sky and ocean surrounding the Ngaraard State.

<text>The International Council Correspondence was a council communist magazine published in Chicago from 1934 to 1943. In 1938, it changed its name to &quot;Living Marxism&quot; and again to &quot;New Essays&quot; in 1942.

Paul Mattick was the chief editor and main contributor, Karl Korsch, Anton Pannekoek, Max Nomad, Daniel Guérin, Otto Rühle, Dwight Macdonald and Victor Serge also published in the &quot;ICC&quot;. 

The magazine&#x27;s original purpose was to correspond with fellow council communists, primarily in Europe. It changed its name as the European council communists began to go underground in the late 1930s. 

The magazine was published by the United Workers Party, later known as the Council Communists, which had split from the Proletarian Party of America in 1934. A complete reprint of the magazine was published in the 1970s by Greenwood Reprints with an introduction by Paul Mattick.

<doc id="1224642" wikidata="Q4819765" url="?curid=1224642" title="Audience analysis">
<text>Audience analysis is a task that is often performed by technical writers in a project&#x27;s early stages. It consists of assessing the audience to make sure the information provided to them is at the appropriate level. The audience is often referred to as the end-user, and all communications need to be targeted towards the defined audience. Defining an audience requires the consideration of many factors, such as age, culture and knowledge of the subject. After considering all the known factors, a profile of the intended audience can be created, allowing writers to write in a manner that is understood by the intended audience.

==Process==
Audience analysis involves gathering and interpreting information about the recipients of oral, written, or visual communication.

There are numerous methods that a technical communicator can use to conduct the analysis. Because the task of completing an audience analysis can be overwhelming, using a multi-pronged approach to conduct the analysis is recommended by most professionals, often yielding improved accuracy and efficiency. Michael Albers suggests that an analysis use several independent strategies that work together, such as reader knowledge of the topic and reader cognitive comprehension.

Writers can also use conversations, in-depth interviews or focus groups to help them to complete an audience analysis. Conversation as well as other qualitative research techniques will allow the communicator to consider the multiple cultural, disciplinary, and institutional contexts of their target audience, producing a valuable audience analysis.

David L. Carson of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute asserted that technical communicators most often perform their jobs with little or no knowledge about their audience. Carson states that the analysis should include a reader&#x27;s level of comprehension of the technical vocabulary and motivation, as well as reading level. Indicators of a reader&#x27;s high level of motivation include high interest in the subject matter, relatively high knowledge of the content, and high personal stakes in mastering the information.

Another technique used to conduct an audience analysis is the &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach. Leon de Stadler and Sarah van der Land explore this type of approach in reference to a document produced by an organization that develops different kinds of interventions in the field of HIV/AIDS education. This particular document focused on the use of contraception and targeted the black youth of South Africa. The initial document was created by document designers in the United States who did not base their design on an extensive audience analysis. As a result, the document, which used the informal slang of black South African youth, did not effectively communicate with its target audience. After the dissemination of the document, Van der Land used focus groups and interviews of a sample of the target audience to discover what improvements should be made. Upon considering the audience&#x27;s perspective, she found that the initial document&#x27;s use of the hip-style language backfired. The interviewees indicated that the use of the popular language was not effective because it was not used correctly or consistently throughout the document. Additionally, to the target audience, the informal language did not fit the seriousness of the topic being discussed. The suggested &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach should have incorporated the target audience during the design process instead of as an afterthought.

Marjorie Rush Hovde provides even more tactics that can be implemented in the process of an audience analysis in relation to one&#x27;s organization. She suggests talking with users during phone support calls, interacting with users face-to-face, drawing on the writer&#x27;s own experiences with the software and documentation, interacting with people within the organization, studying responses sent from users after the documentation is released, and conducting internal user testing. Like Michael Albers, Hovde asserts that the use of a combination of tactics produces a more accurate audience analysis than using one tactic alone.

Karen D. Holl discusses what writers should consider when writing papers that address an international audience. She focuses on those writers who attempt to publish studies in publications that are circulated abroad. She suggests that these writers consider the following questions when framing their papers:

* What conclusions from my study would be relevant and novel to land managers and scientists working in other ecosystems and socio-economic contexts?
* What is the geographic scope of the literature I am citing?
* To which ecological and socio-economic systems do my world view and results apply?
* Is my study sufficiently well replicated to generalize my results?
* Are my conclusions supported by my data and, conversely, are all my data necessary to support my conclusions?

Although she focuses her suggestions on scientific studies, she acknowledges that &quot;what is critical to effectively communicate the results of any study is to consider what conclusions will be of most interest to the target audience.&quot; Holl concludes that knowing how to address an international audience is a vital skill that successful scientists, as well as technical communicators, must possess.

==Depth of analysis==
There are often a large number of factors to consider, thus making it hard for the writer to completely assess the target audience within a reasonable amount of time. Therefore, an attempt to reach the most accurate and effective audience analysis, in a timely manner, is vital to the technical communication process. The depth of the audience analysis also depends on the size of the intended audience.

Because people constantly change in terms of technological exposure, the audience to be analyzed constantly changes. As a result, the technical communicator must consider the possibility that their audience changes over time. An article in the European Journal of Communication examined the changes experienced by audience research due to the growing range of information and communication technologies. The article pointed out that there are three main challenges that drive the search for methodological rigor: the difference between what people say they do and what they do in practice, the interpretation of the text by the reader, and why the received meanings of television matter in everyday life. An absolutely perfect audience analysis is generally impossible to create, and it is similarly difficult to create an analysis that is relevant for a long period of time. Revising and rewriting an audience analysis is often required in order to maintain the relevance of the analysis.

===Specific applications of audience analysis===

R. C. Goldworthy, C. B. Mayhorn and A. W. Meade, dealt with the hazard mitigation, including warning development, validation, and dissemination as an important aspect of product safety and workplace and consumer protection in their article &quot;Warnings in Manufacturing: Improving Hazard-Mitigation Messaging through Audience Analysis&quot;. In this study, they focused on the potential role of latent class analysis in regards to the audience analysis performed in hazard communication and warning messages. Their qualitative study involved 700 adult and adolescent participants who answered a structured questionnaire about prescription medication history and behaviors. The identification of latent classes based on behaviors of interest facilitated tailoring hazard-mitigation efforts to specific groups. Although their study is limited, in that all participants were between the ages of 12 and 44 and were from heavily populated urban areas (so the generalizability of the data to rural settings has not been generated), this study establishes that latent class analysis can play a vital role. They conclude that latent analysis is a worthwhile addition to the analytical toolbox because it allows, in this case, risk reduction and hazard-mitigation efforts to tailor interventions to a diverse target audience. For the technical writer, analyzing latent classes would enable them to better identify homogeneous groups within the broader population of readers and across many variables to tailor messages to these better-specified groups.

The population of older adults is growing, and Gail Lippincott asserts that technical communicators have not accounted for the needs of these audiences, nor drawn from the wide range of research on aging. In her article &quot;Gray Matters: Where are the Technical Communicator in Research and Design for Aging Audiences?&quot;, Lippincott suggests four challenges that practitioners, educators, and researchers must undertake to accommodate older adults&#x27; physical, cognitive, and emotional needs: They must refine the demographic variable of age, operationalize age to enrich current methods of audience analysis, investigate multidisciplinary sources of aging research, and participate in research on aging by offering our expertise in document design and communication strategies. Lippincott acknowledges that there is so much more research that must be done in this area, for &quot;the body of literature on older adults and computer use is relatively small.&quot; Lippincott provides insight into an often overlooked audience that technical communicators must learn to address.

Teresa Lipus argues that devoting company resources to produce adequate instructions for international users is both practical and ethical. She also provides a brief overview of the consumer protection measures that leading U.S. trade partners have implemented. She also presents the following guidelines for developing adequate instructions for international audiences:

# Define the scope of the instructions
# Identify the audience
# Describe the product&#x27;s functions and limitations
# Identify the constraints
# Use durable materials

She offers tips for getting and keeping the attention of the audience:

# Organize the information
# Structure the information
# Design the page layout

For aiding the comprehension of the readers, Lipus suggests that technical communicators write readable texts and design effective graphics. In an effort to motivate compliance, she recommend making the instructions relevant and credible and to improve information recall by organizing the information into small meaningful groups and providing concise summaries and on-product reminders. When presenting safety information, Lipus says to not only include the necessary safety messages but to also design effective safety messages. Before distributing instructions, they must be evaluated. She recommends testing the product and the accuracy of the instructions, communicating using means that reach users, and continuing to test and to inform users even after marketing. She explains that because the potential for making subtle but offensive errors is so high in international dealings, a language-sensitive native speaker from the target culture should always review the instructions before they are distributed to consumers. Although Lipus provides information in analyzing and writing for an international audience regarding consumer protection, the strategies offered can be applied to document preparation in general.

Jenni Swenson, Helen Constantinides, and Laura Gurak, in their case study, address the problem of defining medical web site credibility and identifying the gap in web design research that fails to recognize or address specific audience needs in web site design. The information they gathered assisted the researchers in identifying and fulfilling specific audience needs, describing a framework, and presenting a case study in audience-driven Web design. The researchers used the qualitative method of conducting a survey to find the audience of the Algenix, Inc. Web site. Algenix is a biomedical liver disease management company. The study showed that an audience-driven design would do more to reassure the audience that personal information would not be collected without consent as well as provide clear policies of security, privacy, and data collection. The survey informed the researchers that the audience would also like to experience a site with minimal graphics and short download times and one that is intuitive and easy to navigate. This study illustrates how an audience analysis should not only address what the users are able to do but also what they, as the users, would prefer.

In the article &quot;Real Readers, Implied Readers, and Professional Writers: Suggested Research&quot;, Charlotte Thralls, Nancy Ror, and Helen Rothschild Ewald of Iowa State University define &quot;real readers&quot; versus &quot;implied readers&quot;. The real reader is a concrete reality and determines the writer&#x27;s purpose and persona. A writer who perceives an audience as real tends to conceive of readers as living persons with specific attitudes and demographic characteristics. Therefore, the writer&#x27;s task is to accommodate the real reader by analyzing this reader&#x27;s needs and deferring to them. The implied reader, on the other hand, is a mental construct or role which the actual reader is invited to enter, even though the characteristics embodied in that role may not perfectly fit his or her attitudes or reactions. When the reader is implied, the writer invents and determines the audience within the text. The researchers assert that writers must appreciate the complex interplay that may take place between the real and implied representations of the reader in every document. The researchers discuss how their study was conducted for the sole purpose of developing a hypothesis for further study: Are professional writers aware of real and implied readers; does a writer&#x27;s way of perceiving a reader affect contextual development; do shifts occur in writers&#x27; conceptions of readers; are writers&#x27; perceptions of readers linked to a sense of genre and explained by principles of cognitive processing?

<doc id="1224643" wikidata="Q3844185" url="?curid=1224643" title="Mammy stereotype">
<text>A mammy is a U.S. historical stereotype depicting Black women, usually enslaved, who did domestic work, among nursing children. The fictionalized mammy character is often visualized as a dark-skinned woman with a motherly personality. The origin of the mammy figure stereotype is rooted in the history of slavery in the United States, as enslaved women were often tasked with domestic and childcare work in American slave-holding households. The mammy caricature was used to create a narrative of Black women being content within the institution of slavery among domestic servitude. The mammy stereotype associates Black women with domestic roles, and it has been argued that it, alongside segregation and discrimination, limited job opportunities for Black women during the Jim Crow era (1877 to 1966).

==History==
The mammy caricature was first seen in the 1830s in Antebellum pro-slavery literature, as a form to oppose the description of slavery given by abolitionists. One of the earliest fictionalized versions of the mammy figure is Aunt Chloe in Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, first published in 1852.

Some scholars see the mammy figure as rooted in the history of slavery in the United States. Enslaved African American women were tasked with the duties of domestic workers in white American households. Their duties included preparing meals, cleaning homes, and nursing and rearing their owners&#x27; children. Out of these circumstances arose the image of the mammy.

===Segregation era and National Mall monument===
While originating in the slavery period, the mammy figure rose to prominence during the Reconstruction Era. Scholars may argue that the Southern United States has the mammy role serve as historical revisionism. In efforts to reinterpret and legitimize the legacy of chattel slavery among racial oppression. The mammy image became especially prominent in the era of racial segregation and continues to be reproduced, as it persisted into the 21st century.

In 1923, the United Daughters of the Confederacy proposed the erection of a mammy statue on the National Mall. The proposed statue would have been dedicated to &quot;The Black Mammy of the South&quot;. The bill received a standing ovation in the Senate, where it passed with bipartisan consensus, but died in committee in the House following written protests from thousands of Black women.

===Historical criticism===
The historicity of the mammy figure is questionable. Historical accounts point to the identity of most female domestic servants as teenagers and young adults, not &quot;grandmotherly types&quot; such as the mammy. Melissa Harris-Perry has argued that the mammy was a creation of the imagination of the white supremacy, which reimagined the powerless, coerced slave girls as soothing, comfortable, and consenting women. This contradicts other historically accurate accounts of enslaved women fearing for their lives at the hands of abusive masters. In 1981, Andy Warhol included the mammy in his &quot;Myths&quot; series, alongside other mythological and folklore characters such as Santa Claus, Mickey Mouse, and Superman.

In &quot;Mammy: A Century of Race, Gender, and Southern Memory&quot; (2008), Kimberly Wallace-Sanders argued that the mammy&#x27;s stereotypical attributes point to the source of her inspiration: &quot;a long lasting and troubled marriage of racial and gender essentialism, mythology, and southern nostalgia.&quot;

The romanticized mammy image survives in the popular imagination of the modern United States. Psychologist Chanequa Walker-Barnes argues that political correctness has led to the mammy figure being less prevalent in the 21st-century culture, but the mammy archetype still influences the portrayal of African-American women in fiction, as good caretakers, nurturing, selfless, strong, and supportive, the supporting characters to white protagonists. She cites as examples Miranda Bailey, Mercedes Jones, and Ivy Wentz.

==Fictional characteristics==
The mammy is usually portrayed as an older woman, overweight, and dark skinned. She is an idealized figure of a caregiver: amiable, loyal, maternal, non-threatening, obedient, and submissive. The mammy figure demonstrates deference to white authority. On occasion, the mammy is also depicted as a sassy woman. She is devoted to her enslavers/employers and her primary goal in life is to care for their needs. In some portrayals, the mammy has a family of her own. But her caregiving duties always come first, leading to the mammy being portrayed as a neglectful parent or grandparent. And while the mammy is devoted to her white family, she often treats her own family poorly. Moreover, she has no black friends.

Melissa Harris-Perry describes the relationship between the mammy and other African Americans in &quot;Sister Citizen: Shame, Stereotypes, and Black Women in America&quot; (2011) by summarizing that &quot;Mammy was not a protector or defender of black children or communities. She represented a maternal ideal, but not in caring for her own children. Her love, doting, advice, correction, and supervision were reserved exclusively for white women and children.&quot;

This stereotype contrasts with the Jezebel stereotype, which depicts younger African-American women as conniving and promiscuous. The mammy is occasionally depicted as a religious woman. More often than not, the mammy is an asexual figure, &quot;devoid of any personal desires that might tempt her to sin&quot;. This helps the mammy serve as both a confidante and a moral guide to her young charges, capable of keeping them in line.

Kimberly Wallace-Sanders includes other characteristics of the mammy in &quot;Mammy. A Century of Race, Gender, and Southern Memory&quot; (2008): A large dark body, a round smiling face, a deeply sonorous and effortlessly soothing voice, a raucous laugh. Her personal attributes include infinite patience, self-deprecating wit, an implicit understanding and acceptance of her own inferiority, and her devotion to whites. The mammy was also large-breasted, desexualized, and potentially hostile towards Black men. Many of these characteristics were denied to African-American female slaves but were generally attributed to the mammy.

===Clothing===
The dress often reflects the status of her enslaver. The mammy is usually neat and clean and wears attire that is suitable for her domestic duties. Sometimes a mammy would consider herself to be &quot;dressed up&quot;, but typically it was an addition of a bonnet and a silk velvet mantle, which tended to belong to her enslaver.

===Living conditions===
When the mammy did not stay in the house of the enslavers or was not busy attending to the needs of their children, she would live separately. She lived with her husband and children in a cabin that was distinguished from the cabins of other enslaved individuals in size and structure. The cabin would be placed near the enslaver&#x27;s house, but at a distance from the other cabins.

Although her duties were far less tiring and strenuous, her hours were often long, leaving little time for her own leisure. Her life revolved around her duties, which did not allow her an opportunity to have an individual lifestyle other than serving. There was flexibility in her duties that distinguished her from an ordinary nurse or a wet nurse. In some of the wealthier households, the mammy had assistants who would help her take care of the household&#x27;s children. These women were often much younger than the mammy herself.

The mammy, unlike other slaves, was usually not for sale, and the children of the mammy were kept in the same family for as long as possible, retaining the same relationships that the mammy had with the enslaver. There were often times when a mammy was forced to leave her own children behind to care for the owner&#x27;s children. In many cases mammies chose to have their own children taken away because they needed to be able to provide mother&#x27;s milk to nourish their enslaver&#x27;s children. They feared that if they were feeding their own children there would be not be enough milk for the enslaver&#x27;s children.

===Roles in plantation households===
The fictional role of the mammy in plantation households grows out of the roles of enslaved African-Americans on the plantation. African-American slaves played vital roles in the plantation household. For the mammy, the majority of these duties generally are related to caring for the children of the enslaver&#x27;s family, thus relieving the mistress of the house of all the drudgery work that is associated with child care. When the children have grown up and were able to take care of themselves properly, the mammy&#x27;s main role is to help the mistress with household tasks. As her years of service with the family increase, the mammy&#x27;s sphere of influence increases as well. She is next to the mistress in authority and has the ability to give orders to everybody in the house.

The mammy is often considered to be part of the slaveholding family as much as its blood members were considered. Although she is considered of a lower status, she is still included in the inner circle. She has often been referred to as a &quot;unique type of foster motherhood&quot;. Aside from just tending to the needs of the children, the mammy is also responsible for teaching the proper etiquette to them, such as addressing the elders on the plantation as &quot;aunt&quot; or &quot;uncle&quot;. Among the best speech on particular occasions and what was not. The mammy has the ability to discipline, and is able to retain respect with those she worked with, even with the children grow to adulthood.

===Advertising===
The mammy caricature has been used as advertisements for corporations, especially within the food industry. In 2020, the brand Aunt Jemima came under criticism for its branding after receiving public criticism about the company using a mammy caricature as its logo. The character of Aunt Jemima was not a real person and was portrayed by several people, beginning with freed slave Nancy Green from 1893 to 1923, and followed by others including Anna Robinson (1923–1951), Edith Wilson (1948–1966), and Ethel Ernestine Harper (the 1950s). One of the founders of Aunt Jemima came up with the name and branding after hearing a minstrel song called &quot;Old Aunt Jemima&quot;. Subsequently, other companies who profited from using images of black caricatures received criticism as well. Uncle Ben&#x27;s, Mrs. Butterworth&#x27;s, and Cream of Wheat are some of the companies that were spotlighted. In 2021, Quaker Oats, the owners of the Aunt Jemima brand, decided to rebrand it as The Pearl Milling Company and changed its logo from the mammy caricature to an image of a traditional milling building.

&quot;Aunt Priscilla&#x27;s Recipes&quot; was a food and recipe column published in the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; during the 1930s. Aunt Priscilla was a mammy caricature who was the stereotypical good southern cook who spoke in a broken and exaggerated dialect. The alias of Aunt Priscilla was actually a white woman named Eleanor Purcell. Purcell also released several cookbooks under the alias. Purcell also took up the person of Aunt Ada in a column for &quot;The Evening Sun&quot; named &quot;Ask Aunt Ada&quot;. Black women were often the faces of these food or housekeeping columns because of the stereotypes like the mammy which associated them with servant and domestic roles.

Images such as Aunt Jemima and Aunt Priscilla were mammy caricatures that created a negative and limiting representation as servant roles for white families.

===Cinema===
In the early 20th century, the mammy character was common in many films. Hattie McDaniel became the first African American to win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress with her performance as &quot;Mammy&quot; in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; in 1939. In 1940, shortly after the win, the NAACP scrutinized McDaniel&#x27;s role, and criticized Hollywood for the lack of diverse Black roles and characters outside of servitude. McDaniel responded to backlash by saying, &quot;Why should I complain about making $7,000 playing a maid? If I didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;d be making $7 a week actually being one.&quot;

Some of the contemporary media portrayals of the mammy caricature have been acted out by Black men (Henson, 2013). A contemporary portrayal of the mammy caricature is seen in the film &quot;Big Momma&#x27;s House&quot; directed by Raja Gosnell and starring Martin Lawrence. In the movie Martin Lawrence plays an FBI agent, Malcolm Turner, who goes undercover as &quot;Big Momma&quot; Hattie Mae Pierce, who exhibits the stereotypical mannerisms and appearance of a mammy caricature. The character of Big Momma is a plus-size older Black matriarch and homemaker with overtly religious beliefs and a nurturing demeanor. Another mammy stereotype that the movie displays is the one of midwifery and domestic work. This originates from the history of older Black women serving as midwives on plantations.

&quot;The Help&quot; is a movie based on a novel by Kathryn Stockett about Black maids of white families in Jackson, Mississippi during the 1960s. The novel and film center around the experience of Black domestic workers, influenced by the writer and director both having Black nannies growing up. The story is positive from the perspective of the main character Skeeter, who has also been raised by a Black nanny. During the movie, Skeeter convinces several Black maids to share their stories and grievances, which causes an uproar. The movie came under criticism for several reasons. One in which both the novel and film were written by white people and executed by them. These portrayals of Black maids were derived from the limited perspectives of people who did not share the life experiences of the people being depicted. The Association of Black Historians released a statement saying, &quot;The Help distorts, ignores and trivializes the experiences of Black domestic workers.&quot; When asked about her role in the movie, Viola Davis expressed her concern with playing the role because of the stereotype. However, she argued that the mammy remains a caricature because she is never humanized in the writings or portrayals. Davis&#x27; mother and grandmother also worked as maids, so she was familiar with the experience and lives of Black women within domestic work. Davis also challenged filmmakers to explore the lives of these women outside of the kitchen and to not limit their identity to that of maids.

=== Dolls and ceramics ===
Mammy imagery can be found in the form of several objects including dolls, ceramics, cookie jars, salt and pepper shakers, and other household items. The mammy caricature was part of post Civil War propaganda that spread negative and false stereotypes about African Americans. These mammy ceramics and dolls had similar effects as the false representations created by minstrel shows. These figurines often had exaggerated features and tried to falsely portray African Americans as &quot;docile, dumb and animated&quot;. Despite their racist meaning, these items have been passed down and seen as memorabilia. Although these mammy dolls and ceramics dehumanize Black people, some of them are still valued and sold for hundreds of dollars.

In Natchez, Mississippi, there is a roadside restaurant called Mammy&#x27;s Cupboard that was founded in 1940. The building is shaped like a mammy caricature along with a head-wrap and long red skirt. Similar to Aunt Jemima, Mammy&#x27;s Cupboard uses the imagery and the stereotype of Black women to promote a business. The restaurant&#x27;s use of a mammy caricature to portray Black servitude is reminiscent of how it was portrayed in the Old South.
The character Beloved Belindy was designed by Raggedy Ann creator Johnny Gruelle. This character was sold as a doll and featured in books.

===Television===
Televisions did not become common in US household until around the mid to late 1940s, making radio shows popular forms of entertainment for the American family. In 1939, Beulah Brown debuted as a character on the radio show &quot;Homeward Unincorporated.&quot; Beulah, as a character, was highly stereotypical and was the quintessential mammy figure auditorily. The character was originally played by white actor Marlin Hurt. The character was well taken to and added to several other radio shows. Over time, the creators and producers of these shows wanted to have an actual Black woman as the voice of the character. Hattie McDaniel was given the role on the radio version in 1947, as she was famous for her multiple other award-winning performances portraying the mammy stereotype. The radio show was taken to television in the early 1950s and went on to run for three seasons. The first of season of the show starred Ethel Waters, who later left the series due to not wanting to portray the mammy stereotype any longer. McDaniel took over the role for the second season, filming a total of six episodes before becoming ill. McDaniel has been noted to have chosen to play these mammy roles time and time again as they were the only accessible roles for black actress during this time. Similar to how she was given the role on the radio, McDaniel was the epitome of what a mammy looked like as well as being big in size, large mouth, and dark skin that contrasts from white teeth and big eyes. The role on television was also portrayed by Louise Beavers. Aside from the actress that portrayed her, Beulah, as a character, had all the characteristics of a mammy. She always made sure her &quot;family&quot;, the family she worked for, was well taken care of. Helping them at any cost and putting their needs above her own can be seen in multiple episodes of the show. The NAACP, and other critics, did not like the image of African-American women the show represented, as it supported the mammy stereotype.

Over time, the image of the mammy was given a contemporary makeover. Some of the more contemporary features that the mammy received were that her head rag was removed and she became smaller, as well as lighter in complexion. In addition, her owner was not always white.

Some contemporary television sitcoms which featured mammies include &quot;Maude&quot;, where the character Florida, played by Esther Rolle, worked as a domestic for a white family. A spin-off titled &quot;Good Times&quot; was made, where Rolle&#x27;s character became the center of the series; the show focused on her family, which lived generally happy lives in a low-income housing project. Other television series that featured mammies as characters include &quot;That&#x27;s My Mama&quot;, &quot;Gimme a Break!&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot;.

When other contemporary mammies emerged, they usually retained their occupation as domestic workers and exhibited these physical feature changes; however, their emotional qualities remained the same. These contemporary mammies continued to be quick-witted and remained highly opinionated. A new twist in the outlook of the contemporary mammy occurred in the sitcom &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, where Florence, a maid played by Marla Gibbs, works for an affluent African-American family.

&quot;A Different World&quot; was a 1980s sitcom that featured students at Hillman, a fictional historically black college. In an episode titled &quot;Mammy Dearest&quot;, the mammy stereotype was discussed. The episode centered on an exhibition planned by the character Whitley Gilbert. In the exhibition, Gilbert included images of a &quot;mammy&quot;. The character of Charnele Brown is upset and wants it removed from the exhibition. Gilbert and others argue that they must reclaim the image and separate it from its racist history. Later in the episode Brown reveals a childhood story in which she dressed up a Nubian princess for a costume contest at school. When she won, she was referred to as &quot;Aunt Jemima&quot;. The incident was traumatic for her because she felt that was how people saw her.

=== Legacy ===
Nowadays, stereotypical or controlling images of Black women reflect the economic, legal, and social changes that have occurred to Black people over the past 50–60 years. The images are also reflective of a society as a whole – a global economy, unprecedented media reach and transitional racial inequality – and are class specific. Working class Black women are depicted as the  “Bad Black Mother”/”Welfare Queen” and the “Bitch” (materialistic and hyper sexual Black women within “hip-hop” culture), Middle class Black women are depicted as “Black Ladies” with allegedly un-restrainable sexual desire, and an educated Black woman is often depicted as an “Educated Black Bitch” who is portrayed as manipulative and controlling. Black women in positions of power are often seen as the “Modern-day Mammy”, now which refers to a well-educated and successful Black woman within the upper/upper middle class who “uphold[s] white-dominated structures, institutions, or bosses at the expense of [her] personal [life].” This is a derivative of the original “Mammy” stereotype in which the Black woman was not only subservient but often happy to serve her white enslaver.

<text>Thrush Aircraft, LLC is an American aircraft manufacturer based in Albany, Georgia. It manufactures the Thrush series of agricultural, firefighting and special mission aircraft.

==History==
Rockwell International originally built the facility in 1965 and operated it until it was purchased by Ayres Corporation on 23 November 1977. In July 2001, Ayres filed for bankruptcy and the rights to the S-2 aircraft were passed to Quality Aerospace. In 2003, the factory was purchased by Larry Bays and Payne Hughes, and one month later Quality Aerospace transferred the type certificates of the S-2 to Thrush Aircraft. In 2005, the company had 150 employees. By 2013, this had increased to 185.

The 510 was introduced in 2009. The first two examples of the 510G Switchback, a variant designed for firefighting were delivered to the Georgia Forestry Commission in 2017.

The company entered bankruptcy protection in September 2019, intending to restructure and emerge in a better financial position. The company laid-off 113 employees as part of the process. As a result of the restructuring, Mark McDonald was named CEO.

<doc id="1224650" wikidata="Q3586316" url="?curid=1224650" title="2005 British Columbia general election">
<text>The 2005 British Columbia general election was held on May 17, 2005, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) of the Province of British Columbia (BC), Canada. The British Columbia Liberal Party (BC Liberals) formed the government of the province prior to this general election under the leadership of Premier Gordon Campbell. The main opposition was the British Columbia New Democratic Party (BC NDP), whose electoral representation was reduced to two MLAs in the previous provincial election in 2001.

The BC Liberals retained power, with a reduced majority of 46 out of 79 seats, down from the record 77 out of 79 in 2001. While the popularity of Campbell&#x27;s government was affected by various factors such as its resolution of the Fast ferry scandal inherited from the previous NDP government, the sale of BC Rail, and Campbell being convicted for driving under the influence in January 2003, the overwhelming majority they earned at the previous election held up well enough for them to remain comfortably in control of the Legislative Assembly. Voter turnout was 58.2 per cent.

Under amendments to the BC Constitution Act passed in 2001, BC elections are now held on fixed dates: the second Tuesday in May every four years. This was the first provincial election for which elector data in the provincial elector list was synchronised with the National Register of Electors.

Coincidental with the general election, BC voters also voted on whether or not to change the province&#x27;s electoral system.

==Electoral reform referendum==

The BC electoral reform referendum was held in conjunction with this election. This referendum asked voters whether or not they support the proposed electoral reforms of the Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Electoral Reform, which included switching to a single transferable vote (STV) system. Had it been approved by 60% of voters in 60% of ridings), the new electoral system would have been implemented for the general election in 2009. Although the proposed reform attracted a clear majority (58% of the popular vote in favour, with 77 out of 79 ridings showing majority support), the level of support was just short of that required for mandatory implementation. A new vote on a revamped version of STV was held in conjunction with the 2009 British Columbia general election.

==Timeline==

===Pre-campaign period===
* August 30, 2001 - &quot;Bill 7, Constitution Amendment Act&quot; is passed, fixing the date of the election at May 17, 2005.
* November 13, 2002 - Liberal MLA Paul Nettleton accuses the government of a secret plan to privatize BC Rail as well the BC Hydro electric utility. He is removed from caucus several days later and sits as an &quot;Independent Liberal&quot; until the 2005 election, when he unsuccessfully ran in Prince George-Mount Robson against Shirley Bond. BC Rail was subsequently sold to CN in what other bidders have described as a corrupted process, and BC Hydro&#x27;s administrative arm was sold to Accenture.
*January 9, 2003 - Premier Gordon Campbell is arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol on Maui. Because drunk driving is not a criminal offence in the state of Hawaii, but only a misdemeanour, Campbell did not resign his seat as he would have had to in Canada, and due to pressure from Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) he attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and a series of speaking engagements condemning drinking and driving.
* November 23, 2003 - Carole James is elected as leader of the New Democratic Party of British Columbia.
* December 28, 2003 - the RCMP execute search warrants on various locations in the Lower Mainland and Greater Victoria, including offices in the Parliament Buildings in Victoria, in relation to suspicious dealings in relation to the bidding process for the sale of BC Rail (see BC Legislature Raids).
* March 22, 2004 - Liberal MLA Elayne Brenzinger quits the caucus citing a &quot;secret agenda&quot; being undertaken by Premier Campbell in relation to the sale of BC Rail.
* September 17, 2004 - Deputy Premier Christy Clark, whose house had been searched under warrant by the RCMP in connection with the BC Legislature Raids investigation, quits politics saying she wanted to spend more time with her family.
* October 22, 2004 - New Democrat Jagrup Brar wins a by-election in Surrey-Panorama Ridge with 53.6% of the vote, a swing of 33.7% to the NDP from the 2001 result. One of Brar&#x27;s competitors was Green leader Adriane Carr who captured 8.4% of the vote.
* December 14, 2004 - In the wake of revelations he had been under surveillance by the RCMP in connection with dealings concerning the sale of BC Rail, Liberal Finance Minister Gary Farrell-Collins abruptly resigns from cabinet and the legislature despite having been named co-chair of the Liberal re-election campaign a month earlier. The move requires Premier Campbell to undertake a minor cabinet shuffle.
* January 15, 2005 - The Democratic Reform British Columbia party is created out of a merger of the British Columbia Democratic Coalition and the All Nations Party of British Columbia. The party also boasts the support of key elements of the Reform Party of British Columbia. Prior to the official creation of this party, the Democratic Coalition and Reform BC jointly nominated a candidate for the Surrey-Panorama Ridge by-election.
* January 19, 2005 - Independent MLA Elayne Brenzinger joins DRBC, adding a third party to the Legislative Assembly for the first time since Gordon Wilson folded his Progressive Democratic Alliance party and joined the NDP.
* January 31, 2005 - Liberal MLA and then-cabinet minister Sandy Santori resigns from his seat in the Legislature in a dispute over the deletion of emails by Premier Gordon Campbell&#x27;s Deputy Minister to the Premier, Ken Dobell.
* February 15, 2005 - New Liberal Finance Minister Colin Hansen introduces what is widely viewed as an &quot;election budget&quot; which promised $1.3 billion in new spending, tax cuts and an economic surplus.
* March 11, 2005 - Attorney-General Geoff Plant announces that he will not seek re-election.
* March 15, 2005 - Canadian Broadcasting Corporation board chair Carole Taylor announces that she will run for the Liberals in the riding of Vancouver-Langara. Premier Gordon Campbell endorses Taylor&#x27;s candidacy.
* March 29, 2005 - The consortium of television stations organizing the leaders&#x27; debate announces that the leaders of the Liberal, New Democratic, and Green parties will be invited to participate in the debate.
* April 13, 2005 - The NDP and Green Party release their platforms in Victoria.

===Campaign period===
*April 19, 2005 - The writ of election is issued (not &quot;dropped&quot; as in past elections), dissolving the Legislature and beginning the official campaign period.
*April 20, 2005 - The NDP becomes the first party to complete a province-wide nomination slate.
*April 22, 2005 - NDP candidate Rollie Keith withdraws his candidacy in Chilliwack-Kent after telling the &quot;Vancouver Province&quot; that he was &quot;impressed&quot; when he met Slobodan Milošević and that he did not believe there had been war crimes committed in Kosovo.
*May 3, 2005 - The leaders of the Liberal, NDP and Green parties meet in a televised debate. Commentators indicate the debate was either a draw or a win for Green leader Adriane Carr. An Ipsos-Reid poll conducted online following the debate showed that 33% of debate views thought the debate produced no clear winner, 31% felt NDP leader Carole James won, 23% felt Liberal leader Gordon Campbell won while only 12% saw Carr as the winner.
*May 17, 2005 - CBC projects a BC Liberal majority government at 9:05 p.m. local time.
*June 22, 2005 - Tim Stevenson, who lost to Lorne Mayencourt by 11 votes, asks the Supreme Court of British Columbia to order a new election in Vancouver-Burrard due to 70 ballots that could not be counted because they had not been initialed by election officials.

==Opinion polls==
===Voter intention polling===

Besides the usual public polling by market research firms, other organizations have been attempting to predict the results of the upcoming election using alternate methods. Results suggest that all three projections below underestimated NDP seats and overestimated Liberal seats:

UBC&#x27;s Election Stock Market tracks the prices of contracts whose value depend on election results: 
Popular vote: Lib 44.5%, NDP 35.9%, Green 13.9%, Other 5.3%
Seats: Lib 48.6 (61.5), NDP 29.4 (37.2), Other 1.6 (2.0)(&quot;values in parentheses are values of actual contracts, in cents&quot;)

The Election Prediction Project aggregates submissions from the Internet and subjectively predicts winners based on the submissions (see methodology):
Seats: Lib 50, NDP 29, Other 0

Will McMartin at the progressive online newspaper The Tyee makes his predictions by looking at &quot;historic election results and selected demographics, as well as public opinion polls, regional sources and input from Election Central readers&quot; (see details):
Seats: Lib 51, NDP 28, Other 0.

==Political parties==
British Columbia has Canada&#x27;s least restrictive elections laws with regard to political party registration, and consequently there are currently nearly 50 parties registered with Elections BC, by far the most of any jurisdiction in the country. Twenty-five parties contested the 2005 election, also a considerably greater number than anywhere else in Canada.

Benešov was seat of Lords of Benešov until 1317, when they moved to nearby Konopiště Castle. In 1327, Benešov became a market town. In 1420, the town was conquered and burned by the Hussites. However, Benešov recovered and at the end of the 15th century, it belonged among the most important towns in Bohemia. It was the centre of several political negotiations, such as the 1451 and 1473 meetings of the Bohemian Diet. In the 15th and 16th centuries the town experienced an economic boom, especially thanks to its location on the trade route from Prague to Linz. In 1512, Benešov became a town.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the population had suffered, when the Swedish troops fought here. In the 18th century, when Benešov was owned by the Přehořovský family and then by Lords of Vrtba, the town became a centre of education and culture, which was also helped by the founding of the Piarist college. The development was also aided by the establishment of a direct postal line to Prague in the first half of the 18th century. In 1871, the town was connected to Prague by rail.

<text>Ayres Corporation was an American aircraft manufacturer owned and run by Fred Ayres.

==History==
In 1977, Ayres bought the Albany, Georgia division of Rockwell International, which made the S2R Thrush Commander agricultural aircraft. Before this, Ayres had been a distributor of Thrush Commanders. After the acquisition, Ayres developed two-seat and turboprop-powered versions of the Thrush Commander. 

By 1981, the company was operating a crop-dusting training school. A special V-1-A Vigilante version of the Thrush Commander was developed in 1989 for anti-drug operations in South America. The company attempted to sell 10 Turbo Thrush aircraft to Iran in 1993, but was unable to receive an exemption from U.S. government sanctions.

In 1996, urged on by Federal Express, development was begun on the Ayres LM200 Loadmaster, designed to carry 7,500 pounds of cargo. The aircraft was to be powered by two 1350 hp LHTEC TP800 driving a single five-bladed Hamilton-Standard propeller through a combining gearbox. To support this development effort, Ayres acquired the LET aircraft manufacturing company in the Czech Republic in September 1998. 

In 2001, the company was forced into bankruptcy when creditors foreclosed on it and the Loadmaster program was terminated.

In 2003, the company&#x27;s assets were bought by Thrush Aircraft.

<text>Rodney Warren Smith (born November 15, 1949) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Florida. A Democrat, Smith was a member of the Florida Senate from Gainesville from 2001 until 2006. Smith ran for the Democratic nomination for Governor of Florida in the 2006 election but lost to Congressman Jim Davis. In 2010, Smith was the Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Florida as the running mate of Alex Sink in her campaign for Governor of Florida. From November 2010 through January 2013 Smith served as chairman of the Florida Democratic Party. In 2016, Smith again ran for a seat in the Florida Senate but was ultimately defeated by Keith Perry, a Republican and former state representative.

==Early life and education==
Smith was born on November 15, 1949, in Southwest City, Missouri, just across the state line from his family&#x27;s home in Oklahoma. Before he reached the age of two, Smith&#x27;s family moved to Florida, where they grew eggplant and green peppers. Smith attended public schools. He attended the University of Tulsa, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1971. While at the University of Tulsa, he was a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity. He then attended the University of Florida College of Law graduating with a J.D. degree in 1975.

==Legal and political career==
Following his admission to The Florida Bar, Smith worked for the Florida Public Employees Relations Commission for two years, representing the state in cases relating to labor law. After two years in Tallahassee, Smith returned to Alachua County and spent the next 15 years in private practice. The &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; later wrote that, since that time, Smith has &quot;crisscrossed Florida, representing an array of labor unions–police officers and firefighters, electrical workers, carpenters, painters and pipe fitters. He argued on behalf of large vegetable farmers and dairies and nurserymen. He won settlements against the likes of DuPont and, occasionally, represented criminal defendants...He established himself as a skillful litigator.&quot;

In 1992, Smith was recruited by a group of county sheriffs to seek the office of State Attorney for the Eighth Judicial Circuit of Florida. Smith defeated incumbent Len Register that same year and, during his first term, successfully prosecuted serial killer Danny Rolling, the &quot;Gainesville Ripper.&quot; Re-elected in 1996, Smith created the circuit&#x27;s first special prosecutions unit, which dealt with crimes against women and children, and created an environmental crime unit. He was succeeded by Bill Cervone to be State Attorney.

In 2000, Smith was elected to the Florida Senate as a Democrat. He represented the 14th Senate district, which included nine counties in northern Florida, centered around Gainesville and Ocala. While in the Senate, Smith served as chair of the Agriculture Committee, as vice chair of the Criminal Justice and Justice Appropriations Committees, and as a member of the Communications and Public Utilities, Environmental Preservation, Rules and Calendar, and Ways and Means Committees, as well as the Legislative Budget Commission.

During his term in the Florida Senate, Smith was noted for his work on issues related to criminal justice. He strengthened the state&#x27;s child abuse laws, fought discrimination in housing and worked to protect the privacy of crime victims. He also improved the state&#x27;s crime prevention and homeland security initiatives. Smith &quot;sponsored, and passed, legislation to prevent mentally retarded persons from being executed.&quot; In 2006, he led the coalition that defeated Governor Jeb Bush&#x27;s plan to weaken Florida&#x27;s voter-approved class size amendment and create a school voucher program.

Smith is a partner with the law firm of Avera &amp; Smith and also serves as an adjunct professor at the University of Florida&#x27;s Levin College of Law where he teaches constitutional law and trial practice and supervises the prosecution clinic. He has also taught at Santa Fe Community College.

The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; summed up Smith&#x27;s biography in this way, &quot;He comes from a line of struggling farmers and saw public school as a way out. While in law school at the University of Florida, he juggled going to class with helping to run the family&#x27;s cattle operation. He won respect from unions as a labor lawyer, got elected state attorney and went on to leadership posts in the Florida Senate.&quot; 

==2006 election==
In January 2005, Smith announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for governor in the 2006 election. Smith ran against Tampa Congressman Jim Davis. A statewide poll by the Florida Chamber of Commerce, released on August 28, 2006, showed Smith eight points down against Davis. A poll from earlier in the year showed Davis ahead 25 to 9 percent. Conversely, a July 27 Quinnipiac University poll showed Smith trailing Davis by 28%. However, this poll also revealed that 33% of Democrats were still undecided.

Late in May 2006, U.S. Representatives Kendrick Meek and Allen Boyd broke with their fellow Florida Democratic House members to endorse Smith. Smith has also been endorsed by former Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth and former state Sen. Tom Rossin, the 2002 Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor; state Sen. Dave Aronberg of Greenacres; the Palm Beach County State Attorney, Barry Krischer; and county Commissioner Addie Greene, among others.. The co-chair of his campaign was former governor Wayne Mixson.
In August 2006, the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; endorsed Smith, stating that his opponent, &quot;Davis has a solid record as an ethical, thoughtful state legislator and congressman who understands the challenges facing Florida. Smith combines the same grasp of those challenges with a more dynamic leadership style and a clearer, fresher record of building mainstream coalitions that can successfully carry the day on tough issues. That is what it will take for a Democrat to win in November and successfully govern in Tallahassee.&quot; 

At the same time, the &quot;Palm Beach Post&quot; endorsed Senator Smith, saying, &quot;Rep. Davis would return to Tallahassee with good intentions. Sen. Smith would take office knowing how to get good things done.&quot; In addition, the &quot;Lakeland Ledger&quot; endorsed Smith stating, &quot;We believe Smith can appeal to a broader segment of the electorate -- that he can muster greater support in the Republican-leaning northern part of the state while still generating strong support in the urban areas of Central and South Florida.&quot; 

Later in the month, the &quot;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&quot; endorsed the Senator, noting that between Smith and Davis, &quot;Smith&#x27;s record is the more impressive of the two, and his familiarity with the Legislature and state government gives him the edge over Davis. Smith could literally win the November election and hit the ground running.&quot; 

&quot;The Gainesville Sun&quot; also endorsed Smith saying, &quot;Rod Smith is a superb orator, a skilled negotiator and ...a razor-sharp intellectual and a constitutional scholar who immerses himself in minutia of public policy making ... We think Rod Smith is the Democrat in this race who has the political capital to undo some of the damage that&#x27;s been done to public education these past eight years, find the right balance between environmental protection and economic growth, protect Florida&#x27;s fragile water resources and get a handle on the state&#x27;s runaway health care costs without restricting access to quality care.&quot; 

On August 27, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; endorsed Senator Smith, noting his record of bipartisanship and stating, &quot;In 2006, the Democratic Party has its best chance since the days of the late Lawton Chiles to recapture the governor&#x27;s office.&quot; 

Smith was criticized by media outlets for his allegedly-passive attitude toward Florida&#x27;s sugar lobby and their attacks on his primary opponent. In August 2006, the Miami Herald wrote: &quot;Sen. Smith has been the beneficiary of a million-dollar anti-Davis ad campaign by U.S. Sugar Inc. Senator Smith vows to remain independent. But it could prove difficult to keep a respectable distance from special interests if he becomes beholden to them for outsized political contributions.&quot; The Daytona Beach News-Journal, which had endorsed Smith, added further criticism. &quot;What we find most disturbing is the response by state Sen. Rod Smith. Smith, who railed against smear tactics by third-party groups during his state senate campaigns, has consistently failed to rebuke Florida&#x27;s Working Families (a notable front for Big Sugar interests) for the ads and, when asked, only repeats some of the allegations against Davis. Smith should denounce them.&quot;

On September 5, 2006, Rod Smith lost his bid for the Democratic nomination to Jim Davis. Davis subsequently lost the election to then Republican Charlie Crist.




==2010 Election==

On August 17, 2010, Rod Smith was announced as the running mate for Alex Sink on the Democratic ticket for the race to succeed Crist, who chose to run for election to the U.S. Senate rather than for re-election as governor. On November 2, the Sink/Smith ticket lost to the Republican Scott/Carroll ticket by a 1% margin.

== 2016 Election ==
When the Florida Supreme Court ordered the drawing of new state senate districts in December 2015, District 8, a newly formed district comprising Alachua County, Putnam County, and the northern half of Marion County opened up. On March 1, 2016, Smith announced his campaign for the seat against the then third-term Republican state representative Keith Perry. On November 8, Smith lost to Perry with 47.4% of the vote, a 5.2% margin.

==Florida Democratic Party==

In November 2010 Smith was elected chairman of the Florida Democratic Party (FDP), succeeding Karen Thurman who resigned on November 12, 2010, following the midterm elections. Smith&#x27;s term expired in January 2013 when he was succeeded by Allison Tant.

==Awards and honors==
*Florida Police Chiefs Association&#x27;s Legislative Achievement Award (2002)–for efforts to improve public safety and fight crime
*Voices of Children Foundation&#x27;s MVP Leadership Award (2004)–for efforts on behalf of abused, abandoned and neglected children.
*Florida AFL-CIO &quot;Legislator of the Year&quot;–efforts on behalf of organized labor

Smith was also named the &quot;most effective Democrat in the Florida Senate&quot; by the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; in 2003.

== Beliefs ==
Senator Smith is generally regarded as a political moderate and has traditionally taken stances more conservative than the average Democrat. For example, he has received an &quot;A&quot; rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA). Still, during the first televised debate of the 2006 Democratic primary, Smith stated that he had &quot;no problem with a carefully defined assault weapons ban. We want to make sure we don&#x27;t have weapons in the hands of people who aren&#x27;t supposed to have them and we have tough laws to prevent that.&quot; Smith has stated that he supports, and is a principal architect of, legislation requiring parental notification for minors seeking an abortion but would &quot;leave an exception for the health and life of the mother.&quot; Smith describes himself as pro-choice and his official website promised to, &quot;veto any legislation that would allow the government more influence over a woman&#x27;s personal and private decisions regarding her own body.&quot;

Over the course of the 2006 gubernatorial primary, both Smith and his Democratic primary opponent took many positions not generally associated with the Democratic Party. The latter (Davis) voted for the Iraq War and &quot;also voted to ban flag-burning.&quot; Both men agreed on capital punishment and both agreed on having only, as Davis put it, &quot;some restrictions on assault weapons.&quot;

==Personal life==
Smith and his wife, DeeDee, live on their farm in Alachua County. As reported in &quot;Tampa Bay Online&quot; Smith, &quot;married Deidra &#x27;DeeDee&#x27; Painter, a lawyer ... They have three kids, one together and one each from previous marriages.&quot; DeeDee Smith graduated from law school at age 39 and is an attorney and advocate for child abuse victims.

Smith has 1 daughter, Alison Glover, and 2 sons, Jesse Smith and Dylan Smith. He also has, as of January 2018, four grandchildren. Two from Alison and her husband, Graham Glover, named Hannah Grace and Graham, Jr., and two from Jesse and his wife, Jan, named Norah Lucille and Charlotte Warren.

<doc id="1224667" wikidata="Q925601" url="?curid=1224667" title="Flux of Pink Indians">
<text>Flux of Pink Indians was an English punk rock band from Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, Hertfordshire, active between 1980 and 1986.

==Biography==
The band formed in Hertfordshire, England in 1980 from the remaining members of The Epileptics (who during the first half of 1979 changed their name to &quot;Epi-X&quot;, owing to letters of complaint from The British Epilepsy Association) by Colsk Latter (vocals) and Derek Birkett (bass guitar) with guitarists Andy Smith, Neil Puncher, and drummer Sid Ation (who was also a member of Rubella Ballet).

The group signed with the Crass Records label in 1981. Their debut EP &quot;Neu Smell&quot; was released on Crass in 1981; it featured indie hit &quot;Tube Disaster&quot;. Flux of Pink Indians continued in 1982 with the album &quot;Strive to Survive Causing Least Suffering Possible&quot; released on their own label, Spiderleg.

They released a second album in 1983, &quot;The Fucking Cunts Treat Us Like Pricks&quot;; this was banned by many British retailers, and copies were seized by Greater Manchester Police from the Eastern Bloc record shop, which was charged with displaying &quot;Obscene Articles For Publication For Gain&quot;.

Ation left the group to work full-time with his other band Rubella Ballet, and was soon replaced by Bambi, formerly of Discharge, while Smith was replaced by Simon Middlehurst. However, both departed quickly for their original band, The Insane. While auditioning for their replacements, Puncher also left; the line-up was completed by former Darlex and Epileptics guitarist Kev Hunter, and drummer Martin Wilson. An extensive interview with the band appeared in &quot;No Class&quot; fanzine.

By 1986, the band had shortened their name to Flux; in that year they released their third album, &quot;Uncarved Block&quot;, which was produced by Adrian Sherwood and featured several members of the On-U Sound Records label.

Flux disbanded in 1987.

Birkett, making use of his experiences with Spiderleg, set up One Little Indian Records. Latter went on to form the dance-influenced Hotalacio, and was joined by drummer Wilson and guitarist Middlehurst.

In 2007, the band re-formed for an intended one-off gig supporting ex-Crass vocalist Steve Ignorant for his &quot;The Feeding of the 5000&quot; gig at London&#x27;s Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in November of that year. The &quot;Strive To Survive&quot;-era line-up (Latter, Hunter and Wilson) was joined by ex-Decadence Within bass player Ian Glasper, replacing Birkett, and as a result of their well-received set the band played another three gigs in 2008, in Bradford, Dijon and London.

The band and their album &quot;Uncarved Block&quot; were mentioned in the 2013 book &quot;Taoism for Dummies&quot;, under the sidebar titled &quot;An uncarved Flux of Pink anarchy&quot;.

==Legacy==
In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2016, the band was cited along with a number of other British anarcho-punk bands of the early &#x27;80s as being an influence to the American avant-garde metal group Neurosis.

<text>The Swiss [[Civil Code]] (SR/RS 210, ; ; ; ) is a portion of the second part (SR/RS 2) of the internal Swiss law (&quot;Private law - Administration of civil justice - Enforcement&quot;) that regulates the codified law ruling in Switzerland and relationship between individuals. It was first adopted in 1907 (effective since 1 January 1912).

It was largely influenced by the German civil code, and partly influenced by the French civil code, but the majority of comparative law scholars (such as K. Zweigert and Rodolfo Sacco) argue that the Swiss code derives from a distinct paradigm of civil law.

== History and influences ==
Adopted on 10 December 1907 (and is thus formally known as the &quot;Swiss Civil Code of 10 December 1907&quot;), and in force since 1912. It was created by Eugen Huber, it was subsequently translated in the two other national languages (at the time Romansh was not official) by Virgile Rossel and Brenno Bertoni for French and Italian, respectively.

The Civil code of the Republic of Turkey is a slightly modified version of the Swiss code, adopted in 1926 during Mustafa Kemal Atatürk&#x27;s presidency as part of the government&#x27;s progressive reforms and secularization. The Swiss code also influenced the codes of several other states, such as Peru.

In 1911, the Swiss Code of Obligations (SR 22) was adopted and considered as the fifth part of the Swiss Civil Code. It thus became the first civil code to include commercial law.

== Content ==

The Swiss Civil Code contains more than two thousands articles. Its first article states that:

<text>Mark Alan Mulder (born August 5, 1977) is an American former professional baseball player. A left-handed starting pitcher, Mulder pitched in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Oakland Athletics and St. Louis Cardinals. He is a two-time All-Star.

==Early life==
Mark Alan Mulder was born on August 5, 1977, in South Holland, Illinois.

==College career==
Mulder attended Michigan State University, where he played college baseball for the Michigan State Spartans. In 1997, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Bourne Braves, and was named a league all-star.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
Mulder was selected by the Oakland Athletics with the second overall pick in the 1998 MLB draft.

===Oakland Athletics (2000–2004)===
He was placed on the fast track to MLB and made his MLB debut on April 18, ; he was still only 22 years old and had less than two seasons of minor-league experience. He had a rocky start to his MLB career, going 9–10 with a 5.44 ERA.

In , Mulder played his first full major-league season and quickly became a dominant pitcher. Leading the American League with 21 wins, he anchored a powerful Oakland rotation along with Barry Zito and Tim Hudson, called &quot;The Big Three&quot;. Mulder finished second in AL Cy Young Award voting behind Roger Clemens. He continued to do well in , winning 19 games and striking out a career-high 159 batters in 207.1 innings. Limited by injuries in , he would only log 26 starts, he still won 15 games and had a career-best 3.13 ERA. was an inconsistent year for Mulder. He started the season strong, and was chosen to start that season&#x27;s All-Star Game. However, he had a higher ERA and walked more batters in the second half of the season.

Mulder, Hudson, and Zito were able to carry their team to the postseason four seasons in a row (2000–2003). Mulder competed in the playoffs in 2001 and 2002, logging two starts each against the New York Yankees (2001) and the Minnesota Twins (2002). He carried over his strong regular-season performance by pitching 24 innings in the four playoff starts, with an ERA of 2.25 and 19 strikeouts.

===St. Louis Cardinals (2005–2008)===
After the 2004 season, the Athletics traded Mulder to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for Dan Haren, Kiko Calero, and Daric Barton. In the 2005 season, Mulder&#x27;s first with the Cardinals, he pitched well, 16–8 with a 3.64 ERA. His efforts helped the Cardinals reach the NLCS, where they lost to the Houston Astros.

Mulder began the 2006 season strong, with a 5–1 record and 3.69 ERA through May 17. However, his next six starts were mediocre to awful, and his ERA ballooned to 6.09. He turned out to be suffering from rotator cuff and shoulder problems, and the Cardinals placed him on the disabled list on June 23. In August, he was taken off the disabled list and made several starts in the minors. On August 23, he made his first major-league start in two months and gave up nine runs, all of which were earned, in three innings.

After undergoing rotator cuff surgery, and with a return for the opening of the 2007 season unlikely, Mulder&#x27;s future with the Cardinals looked somewhat uncertain in the 2007 offseason. However, despite being offered comparable deals with the Cleveland Indians and the Texas Rangers, Mulder re-signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on January 10, to a two-year $13 million contract, with performance-based incentives and a club option that could take the deal to three years at a possible $45 million.

After being re-activated on September 5, 2007, he continued to struggle with his command, losing all three of his starts with an ERA of 12.27. In that time, he pitched only 11 innings, and gave up 22 hits and seven walks. This prompted an MRI scan, which led the team to the conclusion that Mulder needed additional clean-up rotator cuff surgery. Although he was expected to recover from surgery in time for Spring training, Mark started the 2008 season on the disabled list. On June 30, 2008, Mulder made his return. He came in from the bullpen with a 7–1 lead over the New York Mets in the top of the ninth. Mulder finished the ballgame with no runs. On July 9, 2008, Mulder started his first game of the season against the Philadelphia Phillies. After striking out Jimmy Rollins to begin the game, Mulder threw eight consecutive pitches out of the strike zone, and left the game with a shoulder injury while attempting a pickoff throw.

After the 2008 season, the Cardinals chose not to exercise Mulder&#x27;s $11 million option for the 2009 season, instead buying out his contract for $1.5 million. After remaining unsigned, Mulder announced his retirement on June 15, 2010, saying &quot;I guess I have retired.&quot;

===2014 comeback attempt===
While watching the 2013 MLB postseason, Mulder began to mimic the throwing motion of Paco Rodriguez, and felt the hand separation at the top of the delivery felt natural. Mulder began auditioning for teams in November 2013. On January 1, 2014, Mulder came to terms with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on a minor league deal with an invitation to spring training.

Mulder expressed going into spring training that his shoulder felt strong, but wondered about the susceptibility of his lower back and legs to injury. On February 15, Mulder tore his achilles tendon. He suffered the injury in agility drills on the second day of spring training, before he was scheduled to throw his first bullpen session. The Angels released Mulder on March 11.

He won it again in 2016, successfully defending his title. On July 16, 2017, he won his third straight American Century Championship. In October 2018, he played in a PGA Tour event, the Safeway Open, via a sponsor&#x27;s invitation.

<text>Scott Charles Maddox (born March 13, 1968) is an American politician. He was the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida, from 1995 to 1996 and from 1997 to 2005. Maddox is the former chair of the Florida Democratic Party and a former Tallahassee City Commissioner, serving from 1993 to 1995, 1996 to 1997 and from 2012 to 2018.

Maddox was indicted on December 12, 2018, on 44 charges, including racketeering, bribery, extortion, bank fraud and wire fraud, in an FBI investigation into corruption that played a key role in Democrat Andrew Gillum’s campaign for Florida governor. Maddox was suspended from the Tallahassee City Commission following the indictment and subsequently replaced after the appointment of Commissioner Elaine W. Bryant, Ph.D. on December 31, 2018. In September 2021, Maddox was sentenced to five years in prison. He was released on May 9, 2023.

==Early life and education==
Scott Maddox was born in Hialeah, Florida, and raised in the rural area of Homestead, Florida, and later, in Tallahassee, Florida. He graduated from Leon High School and attended Florida State University, where he earned a B.S. in political science and public administration. He went on to earn a J.D. from Florida State University College of Law. Maddox was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order men&#x27;s fraternity.

==Political career==
In 1990, at the age of 22, Maddox ran for the Florida House of Representative&#x27;s 10th district, but lost the Democratic primary by 32%. In 1993, while still in law school, Maddox became the youngest city commissioner in the city of Tallahassee&#x27;s history, being elected at the age of 24, and a year later selected to become mayor pro-tempore. In 1995, the city commission chose Maddox as the city&#x27;s mayor, where he worked towards improving race relations and overseeing a large expansion of city parks, greenways, and trails. After the residents of Tallahassee passed a referendum calling for popular elections for the office of mayor, Maddox became Tallahassee&#x27;s first popularly elected city mayor in 1996. In 1999, he served as president of the Florida League of Cities. Described as a &quot;rising star&quot; by Vice President Al Gore, Maddox spoke at the 2000 Democratic National Convention. Maddox attempted a run for Attorney General of Florida in 2002, but lost to future Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer in the Democratic primary. In 2003, Maddox was elected chairman of the Florida Democratic Party and also served as a member of the Democratic National Committee. Though Maddox announced a run for Governor of Florida in 2006, he ultimately dropped out of the race. In 2010, he served as the Democratic nominee for Florida&#x27;s Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services, losing to Republican nominee Adam Putnam. Maddox was elected to the Tallahassee City Commission once again in 2012. In 2015, he announced a run for Superintendent of Leon County Schools. After failing to gain traction in the Democratic primary, Maddox dropped out during qualifying week. He was subsequently re-elected to the city commission in August 2016.

<text>Snow Aeronautical was an American aircraft manufacturer established in 1956 in Olney, Texas by Leland Snow to manufacture and market agricultural aircraft of his design.

==History==
Leland Snow, a graduate of the aeronautical engineering program at Texas A&amp;M University, had designed and flown his S-1 in 1953. Originally working at Harlingen, Texas, he moved to Olney, Texas in 1958 where production of the S-2 began. 

The British aviation company of Britten-Norman acted as distributors for Snow&#x27;s aircraft and later took a 17% equity stake in the company. In 1965 Snow Aeronautical was purchased by the Aero Commander division of North American Rockwell, who refined and marketed the S-2 design as the Rockwell S2R Thrush Commander.

<text>E major is a major scale based on E, consisting of the pitches E, F, G, A, B, C, and D. Its key signature has four sharps. Its relative minor is C-sharp minor and its parallel minor is E minor. Its enharmonic equivalent, F-flat major, has six flats and the double-flat B, which makes that key less convenient to use.

The E major scale is:

:&lt;score sound raw&gt;
\header { tagline = ##f }
scale = \relative c&#x27; { \key e \major \omit Score.TimeSignature
 e fis gis a b cis dis e dis cis b a gis fis e2 \clef F \key e \major }
\score { { « \cadenzaOn \scale \context NoteNames \scale » } \layout { } \midi { } }
&lt;/score&gt;

==Scale degree chords==
The scale degree chords of E major are:
* Tonic – E major
* Supertonic – F-sharp minor
* Mediant – G-sharp minor
* Subdominant – A major
* Dominant – B major
* Submediant – C-sharp minor
* Leading-tone – D-sharp diminished

== Music in E major ==
Antonio Vivaldi used this key for the &quot;Spring&quot; concerto from &quot;The Four Seasons&quot;.

Johann Sebastian Bach used E major for a violin concerto, as well as for his third partita for solo violin; the key is especially appropriate for the latter piece because its tonic (E) and subdominant (A) correspond to open strings on the violin, enhancing the tone colour (and ease of playing) of the bariolage in the first movement.

Only two of Joseph Haydn&#x27;s 106 symphonies are in E major: No. 12 and No. 29. Furthermore, four string quartets (Op. 2/2 and Op. 3/1), Op. 17/1 and Op. 54/3), two piano trios (No. 11 and No. 44) and three piano sonatas (No. 13, 22 and 31) are in E major.

Luigi Boccherini&#x27;s String Quintet, Op. 11, No. 5 is in E major.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart completed only two compositions in E major: the Adagio for Violin and Orchestra KV 261 and the Piano Trio No. 4 KV 542. A noteworthy fragment among Mozart&#x27;s works for horn and orchestra, K. 494a, is likewise in E major.

Antonio Rosetti wrote several concertos for one and two horns.

Marianna Martines wrote a keyboard concerto and a keyboard sonata in E major.

Joseph Martin Kraus wrote a keyboard sonata in E major (VB 196).

Nikolaus von Krufft wrote a sonata for horn and piano in E major.

Josef Mysliveček wrote a violin concerto in E major.

Ludwig van Beethoven used E major for two of his piano sonatas, Op. 14/1 and Op. 109, and for the ouverture to his opera &quot;Fidelio&quot;.

Starting with Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3, several works in the key of C minor began to have slow movements in E major, three examples of which are Johannes Brahms&#x27; First Symphony and Piano Quartet No. 3, and Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2.

Johann Nepomuk Hummel composed a Trumpet Concerto in E major.

Carl Loewe composed a piano sonata in this key: &quot;Grande Sonate&quot; in E major, Op. 16, and so did Ignaz Moscheles in his Op. 41.

Václav Jindřich Veit wrote a string quartet in E major, Op. 5, and Karl Schuberth wrote his string octet Op. 23 in this key..

The second movement of Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No. 8 is in E major, as well as the piano sonatas D. 157, 157 and 459, the rondo from 566 (506), String Quartet D. 353, the middle movement of the Arpeggione Sonata. Several Schubert works end with numbers in E major, such as Die schöne Müllerin, 6 Grandes Marches D. 819 and the 6 Polonaises D. 824.

The andante which serves as an introduction to the Rondo Capriccioso Op. 14 by Felix Mendelssohn is in E major, as well as the Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra in E major.

Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s First Piano Concerto starts in E minor, but the last two movements are in E major. His Étude Op. 10, No. 3, one of his best known works, is in E major. His last Nocturne, Op. 62 No. 2, and his final Scherzo No. 4, are also in E major. A lesser-known work in the key is the Moderato in E major, WN 56.

Moritz Moszkowski wrote his Piano Concerto Op. 59 in E major.

Antonín Dvořák wrote his Serenade for Strings Op. 22 in the key of E major.

Charles-Valentin Alkan wrote Cello Sonata in E major, and so did Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart in his Op. 19.

Adolphe Blanc&#x27;s Septet for clarinet, bassoon, horn, violin, viola, cello and double bass Op. 40 is in E major.

In the 19th century, symphonies in this key were rare, with Anton Bruckner&#x27;s Symphony No. 7 being one of very few examples (see list of symphonies in E major). For Bruckner, &quot;the key of E major is frequently associated with music of contemplation&quot;.

Alexander Scriabin composed his First Symphony in E.

Two symphonies that begin in D minor and end in E major are Havergal Brian&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 (&quot;Gothic&quot;) and Carl Nielsen&#x27;s Symphony No. 4.

More typically, however, some symphonies that begin in E minor switch to E major for the finale, such as Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Symphony No. 2, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Symphony No. 5 and Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No. 10.

In Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s &quot;William Tell&quot; Overture, the first movement and the finale are in E major. Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; overture is also in E major. Another notable composition by the latter in E major is Siegfried Idyll.

The first of Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Two Arabesques&quot;, L. 66, is in E major.

The vast majority of Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Consolations&quot; are in E major, as are Nos. 4 and 5 from Grandes études de Paganini.

Edvard Grieg&#x27;s Morning Mood, part of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; Suite No. 1, Op. 46, is in E major.

<text>Charles Joseph Crist Jr. ( ; born July 24, 1956) is an American attorney and politician who served as the 44th governor of Florida from 2007 to 2011 and as the U.S. representative for from 2017 to 2022. Crist has been a member of the Democratic Party since 2012; he was previously a Republican before becoming an independent in 2010.

Crist served in the Florida Senate from 1993 to 1999, vacating his seat to run unsuccessfully against incumbent Bob Graham for the U.S. Senate in 1998. He won a 2000 special election to serve as Florida education commissioner from 2001 to 2003 and a 2002 election to serve as Florida attorney general from 2003 to 2007. He was elected Governor of Florida in 2006 after winning against Democrat Jim Davis.

While he was governor, Crist again ran for the U.S. Senate in 2010. He initially led in polls in the race for the Republican nomination, but was later overtaken by Marco Rubio. In April of that year, he left the Republican Party to run in the general election as an independent, losing to Rubio in a three-way race. He took 30% of the vote to Rubio&#x27;s 49% and Democratic nominee Kendrick Meek had 20%. Crist&#x27;s term as governor ended in January 2011.

On December 7, 2012, Crist joined the Democratic Party, having endorsed President Barack Obama for reelection in 2012. On November 1, 2013, he announced that he was running for governor in the 2014 election. Crist lost to Republican governor Rick Scott, his successor, by a 1% margin. In 2016, Crist was elected to Congress from his home district, the St. Petersburg-based 13th, defeating incumbent Republican David Jolly, 52%–48% and becoming the first Democrat to represent this district since 1955. In the 117th Congress, Crist was the only former governor serving in the House.

Crist was the Democratic nominee in the 2022 Florida gubernatorial election, resigning from the House in August 2022 to focus on his campaign. He was defeated by incumbent governor Ron DeSantis in a landslide.

On June 7, 2023, the White House announced Crist&#x27;s nomination as U.S. ambassador to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency; his nomination lapsed without action by the U.S. Senate, and expired at the end of the 118th Congress on January 3, 2025.

==Early life and education==
Crist was born in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on July 24, 1956, to Charles Joseph Crist, an American physician of Greek Cypriot and Lebanese descent, and Nancy (née Lee), of Scots-Irish, Swiss, and Welsh descent. His family name is adapted from the original Greek name &quot;Christodoulos&quot;. As a child, Crist moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, where he attended Riviera Junior High School and St. Petersburg High School, from which he graduated in 1974. He is the second of four children and has three sisters: Margaret Crist Wood, Elizabeth Crist Hyden, and Catherine Crist Kennedy. He attended Wake Forest University for two years. While at Wake Forest, Crist was a walk-on quarterback for the Demon Deacons during his freshman and sophomore years, before transferring to Florida State University in Tallahassee. Crist earned his undergraduate degree from Florida State, where he was elected vice president of the student body and joined the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. He received his J.D. from Samford University Cumberland School of Law.

== Early career ==
After graduating from Cumberland School of Law in 1981, and passing the bar on his third attempt, Crist was hired as general counsel to Minor League Baseball, which was headquartered in St. Petersburg. Drawn to politics, Crist was a candidate for public office for the first time in 1986, in the Republican primary for a state Senate seat in Pinellas County. After losing in a runoff, Crist joined his brother-in-law in private practice in St. Petersburg, but soon returned to politics as an aide on the successful 1988 United States Senate campaign of Connie Mack III, whom he has since described as his political mentor.

==Florida Senate==

In 1992, Crist was elected to a two-year term to the Florida Senate from the 20th District, which encompassed parts of St. Petersburg and South Tampa. He defeated longtime incumbent Democratic state senator Helen Gordon Davis of Tampa, 58.3 to 41.7%. Crist was able to unseat Gordon Davis following the 1992 decennial redistricting process, which significantly reconfigured the districts in the Tampa Bay area. His victory was credited with helping to end the Democratic Party&#x27;s 128-year control of the Florida Senate, as the Republicans netted three seats in 1992, resulting in a 20–20 tie between the parties.

Crist was known as a law-and-order senator, sponsoring legislation requiring inmates to serve at least 85% of their sentences before becoming eligible for parole. He supported teacher salary increases, charter schools, and a specialty license plate for Everglades conservation. With Crist as chairman, the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee investigated actions of then-governor Lawton Chiles amid allegations that Chiles&#x27;s campaign had made &quot;scare calls&quot; to senior citizens days before the 1994 gubernatorial election. Chiles testified before the committee and admitted that his campaign had made the calls.

In 1994, Crist was reelected to a four-year term in the Senate, defeating Democrat Dana Lynn Maley with 63.3% of the vote.

==U.S. Senate campaign and Florida education commissioner==

Crist gained recognition in 1998 as the Republican challenger to incumbent Democratic U.S. senator Bob Graham. Crist campaigned conservatively on taxation, crime, and the ongoing Lewinsky scandal, but agreed with Graham on issues such as healthcare and statehood for Puerto Rico. Crist also campaigned on being younger, more energetic, and more able to address Floridians&#x27; needs. He lost to Graham by 26 percentage points, but gained significant name recognition, and was appointed by Governor Jeb Bush to serve as the deputy secretary of the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation in 1999 upon the conclusion of his Senate service. He served until 2000, when he ran for Florida education commissioner in a November special election created by the resignation of incumbent commissioner Tom Gallagher. He won by over 500,000 votes and assumed the office in January 2001. Crist would ultimately be the last statewide elected education commissioner, as a 1998 amendment to the Constitution of Florida turned the position into one appointed by the governor of Florida after his departure. Crist left the office after he was elected attorney general in 2002.

==Florida attorney general==
In 2002, Crist was elected Florida attorney general. His candidacy was supported by the host of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, John Walsh. Walsh and other supporters cited his work with the Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

Civil rights and consumer groups praised Crist for expanding the attorney general&#x27;s powers during his time in office. These powers enabled him and future attorneys general to have greater power to prosecute civil rights and fraud cases. Crist also worked to combat email spam, freeze utility rates, end telecom deception, and protect the environment.

==Governor of Florida==
===Tenure===
Crist was elected to the governorship of Florida in the 2006 election, defeating Democrat Jim Davis 52-45%. In his inaugural pledge to the people of Florida, he promised to lower taxes, improve the state education system, reduce crime, lower drug costs, expand access to health insurance, assist senior citizens, and protect the environment. However, his promise to lower taxes would prove to be difficult to keep during the Great Recession, and he eventually relented in 2009 after being sent a budget by the Florida legislature which included a 2.2 billion dollar raise in taxes and fees. He also had a mixed record on environmental issues.

Nonetheless, Crist remained widely popular with Floridians during his term, and in a June 2007 Quinnipiac University polling survey, Crist had a 70 percent approval rating among Floridians. An April 2009 poll showed him with a 68 percent approval rating among Republicans and independents and a 66 percent approval rating among Democrats. Crist drew criticism from the right for supporting the Obama administration&#x27;s economic stimulus plan. In 2010, rather than seek reelection as governor, he left the Republican Party to run for the Senate as an independent. Shortly thereafter, Crist announced that he had moderated his views against LGBT adoption and marriage.

===Fundraising controversies===
In February 2006, Crist attended a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago, hosted by future president Donald Trump, with guests paying $500 to attend. Two of the guests became subjects of controversy. Crist returned $1,000 in campaign contributions to one of those guests as a result.

In 2009, Crist saw the man he had chosen as Florida GOP finance chairman, his former fraternity brother, oil magnate Harry Sargeant III, forced to step down. One of Sargeant&#x27;s employees, Ala&#x27;a al-Ali of the Dominican Republic, was indicted in Los Angeles for organizing $5,000 in illegal campaign contributions to Crist, as well as $50,000 to presidential candidates Hillary Clinton, John McCain and Rudy Giuliani.

==Role in the 2008 presidential election==

Senator John McCain endorsed Crist&#x27;s 2006 campaign for governor, traveling the state to campaign with him. The day before the general election, Crist held a campaign event with McCain in Jacksonville. Later, when the Republican presidential primary debates were held in St. Petersburg, Crist embraced McCain. Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, who had also campaigned for Crist during the gubernatorial election, had sought his endorsement.

In May 2007, Crist signed legislation moving the date of Florida&#x27;s presidential primary to January 29, 2008, contrary to national political party rules. Crist joined Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm in asking that their states&#x27; delegates be seated. Both national conventions ended up seating all delegates, but with only a half vote each for the sanctioned states.

On January 26, 2008, Crist endorsed McCain in the Republican primary. McCain won the Florida primary by five percentage points.

On October 28, 2008, Crist extended early voting hours of operation and declared that a &quot;state of emergency exists&quot;, due to record voter turnout and resultant hours-long waits at locations throughout the state.

On November 12–14, 2008, Crist hosted the Republican Governors Association (RGA) annual meeting in Miami. Held the week after the Democratic Party victories in the 2008 election, there was speculation about the meeting&#x27;s tone. Then Alaska governor Sarah Palin, the defeated 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, was a featured participant and speaker.

Crist&#x27;s speech at the RGA conference, &quot;Listen to the Voters and Serve&quot;, included his sentiments on how the GOP should evolve:

Crist held a joint interview with Governor Mark Sanford of South Carolina in which they discussed the split in the Republican Party over where to direct the party&#x27;s efforts to gain more voters.

==2010 U.S. Senate campaign==
On May 12, 2009, Crist announced that he would not run for reelection as governor in 2010, making him the first Florida governor not to run for reelection since 1964. Instead he ran for the US Senate. His two main opponents were former Florida House speaker Marco Rubio, and U.S. representative Kendrick Meek.

Crist was initially the front-runner in the Republican primary, but later trailed Rubio in polls.

Crist announced his intent to run as an unaffiliated candidate in the election, while at the same time, according to a press release from his campaign, he remained a registered Republican. Crist officially changed his registration status to &quot;non party affiliated&quot; on May 13, 2010. He did not return campaign contributions made while he was a Republican. Crist lost the general election, receiving 29.7% of the vote to Rubio&#x27;s 48.9% and Meek&#x27;s 20.2%.

In April 2011, as part of a settlement of a copyright lawsuit brought by musician David Byrne, Crist apologized for his Senate campaign&#x27;s use of Byrne&#x27;s song &quot;Road to Nowhere&quot; without permission.

By the spring of 2015, there was speculation that Crist would seek the Democratic nomination for the 2016 United States Senate election in Florida. This would have been his third run for the seat (he lost in 1998 and 2010). In March 2015, Crist said he would not seek the nomination. In the same month he endorsed U.S. congressman Patrick Murphy&#x27;s Senate candidacy.

==Hiatus (2011–2014)==
In January 2011, Crist joined the Tampa office of national personal injury law firm Morgan &amp; Morgan after expressing an interest in returning to the legal field during his final week in office as governor of Florida. Crist worked primarily in the firm&#x27;s class-action sector as a complex-litigation attorney, serving as a &quot;rainmaker&quot; for the firm. In November 2016, after almost six years with the firm, he was elected to represent Florida&#x27;s 13th congressional district. In February 2018, Brad Slager of &quot;Sunshine State News&quot;, cited evidence that Morgan &amp; Morgan was &quot;attempting to purge all evidence&quot; of its relationship with Crist now that he was a &quot;rookie congressman&quot; with &quot;little-to-no power&quot;.

In 2013, Crist performed paid consulting work for Coastal Construction, a Miami-based construction firm owned by Crist&#x27;s longtime friend Tom Murphy, the father of former U.S. representative Patrick Murphy.

Crist has been a part-time guest lecturer at Stetson University College of Law, with the title of Distinguished Professorial Lecturer.

In August 2012, Crist endorsed President Obama in his campaign for reelection over Republican nominee Mitt Romney, saying that the Republican Party &quot;pitched so far to the extreme right on issues important to women, immigrants, seniors and students that they&#x27;ve proven incapable of governing for the people.&quot; Crist was a speaker at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t leave the Republican Party; it left me.&quot;

===Party switch and &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot;===
On December 7, 2012, Crist announced that he had joined the Democratic Party. In July 2013, Crist began writing a book, with &quot;Newsday&quot; columnist Ellis Henican, about his political transition. The book, &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over: How the Extreme Right Hijacked the GOP and I Became a Democrat&quot;, was released in February 2014. In the book, Crist claimed that his career in the Republican Party was destroyed by a hug between him and Obama at a Fort Myers town hall on February 10, 2009. &quot;It was the kind of hug I&#x27;d exchanged with thousands and thousands of Floridians over the years&quot;, Crist wrote. &quot;I didn&#x27;t think a thing about it as it was happening.&quot; But it &quot;ended my viable life as a Republican politician. I would never have a future in my old party again. My bipartisan hopes and dreams, I would discover soon enough to my shock and disappointment, were vastly overstated and hopelessly out of date.&quot;

In May 2014, Crist told Fusion&#x27;s Jorge Ramos that he had left the Republican Party because of its racial attitudes. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t be consistent with myself and my core beliefs, and stay with a party that was so unfriendly toward the African-American president—I&#x27;ll just go there&quot;, Crist said. &quot;I was a Republican and I saw the activists and what they were doing. It was intolerable to me.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; Chris Cillizza rejected this claim, citing &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; political editor Adam Smith as saying that Crist &quot;was happy as a Republican when the polls showed him leading Marco Rubio by 20 points.&quot; Cilizza wrote that Crist&#x27;s party switch &quot;epitomized for many within the Republican base that Crist lacked any core principles or beliefs and, instead, simply went with whatever was popular at the moment.&quot;

In a review in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Isaac Chotiner called &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot; &quot;a dishonest and boring memoir&quot; by &quot;a man with no convictions&quot;. Writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 2014, Jeb Lund described Crist as &quot;a Republican conveniently converted to Democrat&quot;, adding, &quot;what made Crist dynamic as a Republican ... was a vaguely populist nose-thumbing at Republican orthodoxy&quot;, and that &quot;Charlie Crist is a Democrat only if you are a Republican.&quot;

==2014 gubernatorial election==

On November 1, 2013, Crist filed to run for governor as a Democrat. He won the Democratic nomination but was defeated in the general election by Republican incumbent Rick Scott by a vote of 2,865,343 (48%) to 2,801,198 (47%), Crist holds the rare distinction of losing a statewide general election in Florida as a Republican, a Democrat and an Independent.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
====2016====
On October 20, 2015, Crist announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for Florida&#x27;s 13th congressional district, his home district, in the 2016 U.S. House of Representatives elections. He had previously announced on Twitter that he would not run for political office in 2016. Republican incumbent David Jolly, who succeeded 43-year incumbent Bill Young in a 2014 special election, was vacating the seat to run for the same Senate seat for which Crist ran in 1998 and 2010.

But when Senator Marco Rubio decided to run for reelection, Jolly dropped out of the Senate race and sought reelection to the House, even though the 13th District had become significantly friendlier to Democrats when a court tossed out Florida&#x27;s original congressional map. The new map drew nearly all of St. Petersburg, along with most of the more Democratic southern portion of Pinellas County, into the 13th. The district had been in Republican hands without interruption since 1955, and had been one of the first areas of Florida to turn Republican. However, it had become more of a swing district at the presidential level since the 1990s; it has supported a Democrat for president in all but one election since 1992.

In the general election, Crist defeated Jolly by a vote of 184,693 (52%) to 171,149 (48%), becoming the first Democrat to win the seat in 62 years.

====2018====
In 2018, Crist was endorsed by the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) Action Fund, which called him &quot;a leader on protecting Florida from and planning for the impacts of climate change during his time as Governor and in Congress.&quot; Crist won a second term by A vote of 182,717 (58%) to 134,254 (42%).

====2020====
Crist was re-elected to a third term in the 2020 election, defeating Republican Anna Paulina Luna by a vote of 215,405 (53%) to 190,713 (47%).

===Tenure===
Crist was sworn in on January 3, 2017. He was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, the New Democrat Coalition, the Climate Solutions Caucus and the U.S.–Japan Caucus.

On December 18, 2019, Crist voted for both articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.

On January 13, 2021, Crist voted in favor of the single article of impeachment against President Trump during the second impeachment of Donald Trump.

Crist introduced H.R. 305, which presented the Congressional Gold Medal to Officer Eugene Goodman for his valor during the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

On August 31, 2022, Crist resigned from Congress to focus on his gubernatorial campaign.

== 2022 gubernatorial election ==
On May 4, 2021, Crist announced his intention to run for the Democratic nomination in the 2022 Florida gubernatorial election against incumbent Ron DeSantis. &quot;[I&#x27;m] running on decency and mutual respect,&quot; Crist explained. &quot;I love people. And I feel for &#x27;em right now. Gay people. Women. Blacks. They&#x27;re getting the crap kicked out of &#x27;em by this guy. It&#x27;s wrong. Somebody has to stop him.&quot; Crist won the primary election on August23, 2022, and advanced to face DeSantis in the general election on November 8, 2022. Crist&#x27;s running mate for lieutenant governor was union leader Karla Hernández-Mats, president of the United Teachers of Dade. However, Crist was defeated by DeSantis, by a vote of 4,614,210 (59%) to 3,106,313 (40%). 

== Ambassadorship nomination ==
On June 7, 2023, the White House announced that President Joe Biden had nominated Crist for the position of United States ambassador to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency.

==Political positions==

===Abortion===
In 1995, while in the Florida Senate, Crist joined with two Democrats in the Senate Health Care Committee in voting against a proposal for a mandatory 24-hour waiting period before a woman could have an abortion, resulting in a 3–3 tie vote and the bill&#x27;s defeat.

In 1998, while running for the U.S. Senate, Crist wrote in a &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; questionnaire: &quot;I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government.&quot; In a debate that year, he said he did not support a constitutional amendment banning abortion. In 2006, while running for governor, Crist said he did not support overturning &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and opposed a mandatory 24-hour waiting period before a woman could have an abortion.

In 2006, Crist&#x27;s stance on abortion was characterized as unclear.

In early 2010, Crist said he would &quot;fight for pro-life legislative efforts&quot; and described himself as &quot;pro-life&quot;.

By March 2010, however, as rumors swirled that he would leave the Republican Party and become an independent, Crist reiterated that he did not support overturning &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and told a Christian Family Coalition group, &quot;We ought to, instead of change laws, change hearts.&quot;

In June 2010, after leaving the Republican Party and becoming an independent, Crist vetoed a bill that would have required, at patient cost, an ultrasound in order to receive an abortion. He called the measure &quot;punitive&quot; and &quot;almost mean-spirited&quot;. The bill also included language barring abortion coverage &quot;under a contract toward which any tax credit or cost-sharing credit is applied.&quot;

In June 2022, Crist harshly criticized the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, calling it &quot;shameful, harmful, and wrong&quot;.

===Cuba===
In May 2014, Crist publicly supported lifting the United States embargo against Cuba, arguing it has not helped to change the Cuban government. He had supported the embargo earlier as both a Republican and independent. Also in 2014, he announced he had requested the Department of State&#x27;s permission to travel to Cuba with a delegation of business, academic and economic development officials. In June, Crist indefinitely postponed the trip.

In 2019, Crist quietly visited Cuba to meet with Cuban officials, despite high bilateral tensions due to alleged Cuban support for the Maduro regime in Venezuela. The three-day trip was not announced by his congressional office and was disclosed due to required filings in the House of Representatives Committee on Ethics, with no details about it on Crist&#x27;s House website. The trip was sponsored by the Center for Democracy in the Americas, an organization that &quot;promotes a U.S. policy toward Cuba based on engagement and recognition of Cuba&#x27;s sovereignty&quot;, according to its website. Photos of Crist smiling during a meeting with Cuban officials, including Cuban foreign minister Bruno Rodríguez, were published in the official newspaper of Cuba&#x27;s Communist Party during his stay.

===Environmental policy===
In June 2008, Crist proposed that Florida buy from the United States Sugar Corporation for $1.75 billion. The proposed purchase would have removed about 187,000 acres of sugar farming for Everglades restoration efforts. A fairness commission found that price to be too high by $400 million and, ultimately, the purchase was reduced to of not only sugar, but also citrus for about $590 million in 2010, greatly setting back the originally touted restoration effort.

In 2007, Crist signed executive orders to impose stricter air pollution standards in Florida, with an aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In his gubernatorial campaign, he opposed offshore oil drilling. He altered that position in June 2008, when oil reached peak prices, saying, &quot;I mean, let&#x27;s face it, the price of gas has gone through the roof, and Florida families are suffering, and my heart bleeds for them.&quot;

===Fiscal policies===
Crist supported President Obama&#x27;s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a stimulus package in response to the Great Recession. Fellow Republicans were angered by Crist&#x27;s support for the stimulus.

Crist called the act a &quot;godsend&quot;, maintaining that it had saved the jobs of nearly 20,000 Florida schoolteachers and other school workers in 2009–2010.

===Felons&#x27; voting rights===
In a February 12, 2018, &quot;USA Today&quot; op-ed, Crist wrote that Florida was &quot;one of only three states that permanently bans non-violent, ex-felons from voting&quot; and that this &quot;disenfranchisement of 1.5 million of our fellow citizens is shameful.&quot;

===Gun policy===
In 2008, Crist signed a provision preventing employers from prohibiting employees from bringing firearms to the workplace, as long as the weapons are secure and the employees have a concealed carry license.

After the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Crist announced a reversal of some of his previous stances on gun control. Before 2012, he had sometimes accused his opponents of not supporting gun rights strongly enough. He was endorsed by the NRA in 2006. In 2012, Crist announced that he supported reinstating the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, banning high-capacity magazines, and instating more extensive background checks. In the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, he announced his support for additional measures, including a ban on bump stocks, and also said he did not support arming teachers.

When he left office as governor in 2011, Crist had an A rating from the NRA. In 2016, he received an F rating from the NRA.

===Immigration===
In June 2017, Crist was one of 24 House Democrats to vote for Kate&#x27;s Law. The next month, he was one of five Democrats to vote to fund President Trump&#x27;s border wall, and the next day, issued a statement saying that he opposed the wall.

===LGBT rights===
In 2006, as a proposed state constitutional amendment banning same-sex unions was headed to the ballot in Florida, Crist said that such an amendment was unnecessary because state law already barred same-sex marriages. But in September 2005, he had signed a petition for the amendment during the Republican primary at the Christian Coalition&#x27;s request. Crist said in campaign materials at the time that he supported &quot;traditional marriage&quot;. In 2008, he said he voted for the amendment, which passed.

In a debate and a radio talk show appearance in 2006, Crist indicated support for civil unions.

As governor, Crist downplayed the marriage issue, saying in a late 2007 CNN appearance: &quot;It&#x27;s not an issue that moves me. I&#x27;m just a live-and-let-live kind of guy.&quot;

For some time Crist supported Florida&#x27;s ban on same-sex adoption, which had been in place since 1977. He publicly expressed support for the ban beginning when he was attorney general in 2006.

In 2008, Crist again announced his support for the Federal Marriage Amendment. Also that year, he told the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; that the issue was not &quot;top-tier&quot; for him, even as he supported a Florida ballot measure to amend the state constitution prohibiting same-sex marriage that passed later that year.

Also in 2008, in the case of &quot;In re Gill&quot;, a Miami-Dade judge struck down the ban on same-sex couple adoption. As the case proceeded through appeals, Crist expressed support for the adoption ban as late as February 2010, but by June 2010, expressed openness to changing Florida law to allow same-sex adoption, saying a better approach &quot;would be to let judges make that decision on a case-by-case basis&quot;.

In September 2010, Crist said that he had had an &quot;appropriate evolution&quot; on gay rights and was considering dropping the state&#x27;s appeal of to block gay adoption. Days later, after an appeals court affirmed gay couples had a right to adopt, Crist hailed the ruling &quot;a very good day for Florida&quot; and &quot;a great day for children&quot; and announced that the state would no longer seek to enforce the ban. In a Senate debate the next month, he attributed his shift in positions to &quot;the convergence of life experience and wisdom&quot;, saying he had become more tolerant and become less judgmental with age.

At about the same time in 2010, he declared his support for civil unions encompassing &quot;the full range of legal protections&quot; including &quot;access to a loved one in the hospital, inheritance rights, the fundamental things people need to take care of their families&quot;. The voter-enacted 2008 state constitutional amendment Crist supported may nonetheless have prohibited them.

On May 9, 2013, Crist announced that he supports same-sex marriage: &quot;I most certainly support marriage equality in Florida and look forward to the day it happens here.&quot;

In January 2014, Crist apologized for his support for the 2008 same-sex marriage ban and for the same-sex adoption ban, telling an Orlando LGBT publication: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I did that. It was a mistake. I was wrong. Please forgive me.&quot;

===Marijuana legalization===
Crist said &quot;fully legalizing marijuana&quot; would bring about &quot;true justice in our state and in our country&quot; in announcing his candidacy for governor in 2021. He also voted for the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act to legalize cannabis at the federal level and expunge cannabis convictions in 2020. In 2018, he introduced the Fairness in Federal Drug Testing Under State Laws Act to limit the firing of federal workers and denial of applicants for cannabis use.

===Other issues===
As governor, Crist supported capital punishment. He reiterated his support for it in October 2022.

After claims that computerized voting machines undercounted votes in black communities, Crist endorsed legislation requiring paper records of all ballots cast in elections.

In April 2010, Crist vetoed an education bill that would have linked teacher pay to test scores, a piece of legislation conservatives strongly supported.

Crist supported increased regulation of the insurance industry, including property insurance rates (in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina) and health insurance. The Citizen&#x27;s Property Insurance Corp and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund had been described as risky and underfunded. Standing next to former football star Dan Marino (whose son, Michael, is autistic and inspired the Dan Marino Foundation), Crist signed a law expanding health coverage statewide for autism disorders and legislation expanding low-income coverage and creating public and private insurance options in Florida.

The abortion hurdles bill Crist vetoed in June 2010 also included some provisions &quot;intended to thwart&quot; the Affordable Care Act, the federal health care reform legislation championed by President Obama.

In April 2022, Crist said he opposed the repeal of the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, arguing that it would hurt Florida&#x27;s economy and tourism.

==Personal life==
In July 1979, Crist married Amanda Morrow. They divorced within a year.

Crist became engaged to Carole Rome on July 3, 2008, after nine months of dating, and they married on December 12 of that year at the First Methodist Church of St. Petersburg, of which Crist is a member. In February 2017, Crist announced that he had filed for divorce, and the divorce was completed that year.

In 2022, while running for governor again, Crist said that he was engaged to a medical sonographer whom he had met in 2017 and who is the mother of six children.

<text>C. Thomas Gallagher III (born February 3, 1944) is an American politician, financier, and insurance agent from the state of Florida and a member of the Republican Party. Gallagher holds the distinction of having served more years as an elected state official than any other individual in Florida history. He began his career in the Florida House of Representatives, where he served from 1974 to 1987.

He was then the Treasurer, Insurance Commissioner and Fire Marshal of Florida from 1989 to 1995, the Education Commissioner of Florida from 1999 to 2001 and the Treasurer, Insurance Commissioner and Fire Marshal of Florida again from 2001 to 2003.

After 2003, his office was merged with that of Comptroller to form the Chief Financial Officer of Florida, which he held from 2003 to 2007. Gallagher has also run unsuccessfully for the United States Senate in 2000 and four times for Governor of Florida: in 1982, 1986, 1994 and 2006.

==Early life and family==
Gallagher was raised in Delaware where he participated on the high school swim team. In 1961, he entered the University of Miami with a partial athletic scholarship. After graduating, Gallagher enlisted in the United States Army with the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment. Gallagher was honorably discharged and returned to Miami to start a business career.

Gallagher was married to his second wife, Laura Wilson, from 1998 to 2011. Wilson comes from a sixth-generation Florida family. The Gallaghers have a son, Charlie, born in 2000.

==Early political career==
===Florida House of Representatives===
Gallagher began his political career when he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 1974. He ran in the 111th district and defeated the Democratic nominee, attorney Alan Rosenthal, by 51% to 49%. He was re-elected in 1980, defeating John F. Cosgrove by 62% to 38%. He briefly ran for Governor of Florida in 1982 but dropped out early on after realising that incumbent Democrat Bob Graham would be re-elected. He was, defeating U.S. Representative Louis A. Bafalis in a landslide by 65% to 35%.

Gallagher was re-elected from the 117th district in 1982, defeating attorney Charlene Carres by 57% to 43%. His final race was in 1984, when he defeated real estate agent and former actor Seth Sklarey by 70% to 30%. In the House he served as Minority Whip from 1980 to 1982. In 1984, he proposed a 10-year freeze on state taxes and spending. He declined to run for re-election in 1986, deciding instead to enter the Republican primary for Governor.

===1986 gubernatorial election===
In the election, he faced fellow state representative Chester Clem, former U.S. Representative Louis Frey, Jr. and Tampa Mayor Bob Martinez. His running mate was State Representative Betty Easley. She had been running for Commissioner of Education but dropped out to pursue the office of lieutenant governor. Martinez finished first with 244,417 votes (43.80%) and advanced to a runoff with Frey, who came second with 137,967 votes (24.72%). Gallagher came third with 131,265 votes (23.52%) and Clem finished last with 44,409 votes (7.96%). Gallagher endorsed Martinez, who won the run-off and the general election. In September 1987, Martinez appointed Gallagher as the Secretary of the Department of Professional Regulation.

==Statewide office==
===Treasurer, Insurance Commissioner and Fire Marshal===
In 1988, Gallagher ran in a special election for the office of Treasurer, Insurance Commissioner and Fire Marshal of Florida to fill the last two years of the term of Democrat Bill Gunter, who had resigned to run for the U.S. Senate. He won the Republican nomination handily, taking 459,451 votes (76.48%) to Jeffrey L. Latham&#x27;s 94,608 (15.75%) and Raphael Herman&#x27;s 46,654 (7.77%).

In the general election, he defeated Democratic State Senator Ken Jenne by 2,223,401 votes (53.47%) to 1,935,137 (46.53%). He and James C. Smith, who was elected Secretary of State of Florida, became the first Republicans to be elected to the State Cabinet since Reconstruction. Smith, who had been appointed to his office in 1987, was the first Republican to serve on the State Cabinet since Reconstruction. He was elected to a full four-year-term in 1990, beating Democratic State Senator George Stuart, Jr. by 1,965,216 votes (57.22%) to 1,469,541 (42.78%).

===1994 gubernatorial election===
In 1994, Gallagher announced his second run for Governor of Florida. In the Republican primary, he faced former state Commerce Secretary (and future Governor) Jeb Bush, Florida Secretary of State James C. Smith, Florida Senate President Ander Crenshaw, former President of Florida Right to Life Kenneth L. Connor, physician Josephine A. Arnold and attorney Bob Bell. Bush came first with 411,680 votes (45.68%) and Smith came second with 165,869 votes (18.41%), enough to force a runoff, but he dropped out and endorsed Bush. Gallagher came third with 117,067 votes (12.99%), Crenshaw fourth with 109,148 (12.11%), Connor fifth with 83,945 (9.31%), Arnold sixth with 8,326 (0.92%) and Bell last with 5,202 (0.58%). Bush went on to narrowly lose the general election to incumbent Democratic Governor Lawton Chiles.

===Commissioner of Education===
Out of office for four years, Gallagher ran for Commissioner of Education in 1998. Incumbent Republican Frank Brogan had been running for re-election but was tapped by Governor Jeb Bush to be his running mate in the 1998 election, which they won. Gallagher was unopposed for the Republican nomination and faced Democrat Peter Rudy Wallace, the former Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives in the general election. Gallagher won by 2,185,027 votes (56.54%) to 1,679,893 (43.47%).

===2000 U.S. Senate election===
Two years into his term, Gallagher announced that he was running for the United States Senate in 2000. Florida&#x27;s &quot;resign-to-run&quot; law requires an incumbent office holder seeking another elective office to submit an irrevocable resignation from the office they currently hold unless that tenure would end anyway before they would assume the new position if elected. The candidate may designate the effective date of the resignation to be in the future, but it must be no later than the date that they would assume the new office.

This compelled Gallagher to submit his resignation as Commissioner of Education early in 2000 when he began to campaign for the U.S. Senate seat. He chose January 3, 2001 as the effective date of his resignation, as that was the date new senators would be sworn in. Democrat Bill Nelson, who had succeeded Gallagher as Treasurer, Insurance Commissioner and Fire Marshal, also filed his resignation as he joined the Senate race.

Gallagher faced U.S. Representative Bill McCollum in the primary and attacked both McCollum and Nelson for their attendance records in their respective jobs. He campaigned on his support for the marriage penalty, lowering the cost of drug prescriptions for seniors, increasing spending on social security and abolishing the federal income tax. However, after just over a month in the race, Gallagher withdrew. He had difficulty fundraising and had less than one-third of the money that McCollum had. He was encouraged to drop out by Governor Bush, Republican Party of Florida Chairman Al Cardenas and others who believed that a divisive and expensive Senate primary would damage the eventual nominee for the general election campaign with Nelson.

===Treasurer, Insurance Commissioner and Fire Marshal===
As Gallagher&#x27;s resignation could not be withdrawn, he instead ran for Treasurer, Insurance Commissioner and Fire Marshal again. As Nelson was resigning, a special election was taking place and following the withdrawal of State Senate President Toni Jennings, the Republicans lacked a top-tier candidate. State Representative Joe Arnall, who had been in the race for a week after Jennings pulled out, immediately withdrew in favour of Gallagher.

After polls showed that Gallagher was favoured for the Republican nomination and was by far the strongest general election candidate, former State Representative and two-time Treasurer, Insurance Commissioner and Fire Marshal nominee Tim Ireland and State Representative Greg Gay also withdrew from the race, leaving Gallagher unopposed in the Republican primary. In the general election against State Representative John F. Cosgrove, Gallagher won easily, as he was predicted to do, taking 3,363,705 votes (59.01%) to Cosgrove&#x27;s 2,336,117 (40.99%).

===Chief Financial Officer===

Following reforms made to the Florida Cabinet, certified to the Florida Constitution in 1998 and enacted in 2003, the office of Treasurer, Insurance Commissioner and Fire Marshal was merged with that of Comptroller, forming the Department of Financial Services controlled by the Chief Financial Officer of Florida. Gallagher was elected to the new office in 2002 without opposition.

===2006 gubernatorial election===
In 2006, Gallagher made his fourth run for governor, facing state Attorney General Charlie Crist in the Republican primary. Crist was the favorite to win the nomination and won in a landslide, taking almost double the votes of underdog Gallagher: 630,816 (63.98%) to 330,165 (33.49%). Crist went on to win the general election and took office in 2007 and Gallagher was succeeded as CFO by Democrat Alex Sink.

==Subsequent career==
After his defeat, Gallagher became involved in charitable and business activities including founding and serving as chairman of Tom Gallagher Insurance Agency and serving on the board of advisers of The TRIAM Consulting Group, Inc. He considered running for Chief Financial Officer again in 2010 and was encouraged by some to run for the U.S. Senate in 2010 but he declined to do so. After Education Commissioner Eric J. Smith announced his resignation in March 2011, Gallagher applied to the Florida Board of Education for his old job. The board enlisted the help of Ray and Associates to winnow down the twenty-six applicants to five that would be interviewed. Gallagher was not among them.

<text>Cheesy is a solo album by En Esch of KMFDM and Slick Idiot. It was released on August 31, 1993, on TVT.

==History==
Six tracks were recorded in Hamburg, Germany, with Günter Schulz and KMFDM&#x27;s then-engineer Blank Fontana: &quot;Cum&quot;, &quot;Gypsy Queen&quot;, &quot;Ich Bin&quot;, &quot;Rule the Mob&quot;, &quot;Granola&quot;, &quot;Outro&quot;, and &quot;The Past Is Beyond Recovery&quot;. These tracks would have composed En Esch&#x27;s half of the KMFDM album &quot;Apart&quot;. Wax Trax! Records rejected Esch&#x27;s tracks for not sounding enough like KMFDM. Instead, Sascha Konietzko added additional songs and remixes to those he had recorded for &quot;Apart&quot; and changed the name of the album to &quot;Money&quot;. The rest of the tracks for what was initially called &quot;Cheesy Fun&quot; were recorded later in various locations to fill out what then became Esch&#x27;s solo album.

The track &quot;Ich Bin&quot; was sampled and used in the Pigface song &quot;Alles Ist Mein&quot; on the album &quot;Fook&quot;.

Both the anime and OVA (under the name &quot;Blue Seed Beyond&quot;) were licensed by ADV Films in the United States until 2009, when the company shut down. They were later licensed by Discotek Media for a SDBD release on December 18, 2018.

==Plot==
In 1992, Momiji Fujimiya is a middle school student living with her mother and grandmother in the city of Izumo, Shimane. One day, she is confronted on her way to school by a cat-eyed man with blue magatama beads embedded in his hands, who then attempts to kill her. Momiji is confused and terrified by this strange man&#x27;s sudden desire to kill her; he also refers to her as &quot;Kushinada&quot;, confusing her even further. Momiji is saved by the sudden appearance of two government officials, one of whom shoots the man in the arm and sends him fleeing.

Momiji is intrigued as to why she was referred to as the Kushinada. She discovers that the Kushinada refers to an ancient princess whose blood holds the power to stop the ancient monsters known as Aragami by sending them to an eternal sleep. Momiji dismisses the idea that she could be such a person, but reconsiders after vines begin to appear from every crack and opening attempting to capture her.

Momiji tries to escape, not knowing that the vines are being employed by a powerful Aragami known as the Yamata no Orochi. She is saved by the man with the magatamas embedded into his hands, who introduces himself as Mamoru Kusanagi. He confronts Orochi using Momiji as bait. The plan fails and the government officials appear again. They reveal themselves to be members of the Terrestrial Administration Center (TAC for short), and subdue Orochi. However, with the last of its strength, it makes a final attempt on Kusanagi.

Momiji saves Kusanagi by taking Orochi&#x27;s blow. Impaled by the Aragami, instead of dying, she is instead fused with the magatama, more specifically identified as a mitama, which gives Momiji the ability to sense the presence of other Aragami. The TAC agents explain that they are an organization dedicated to defeating the Aragami, who seek to destroy humanity. The current Kushinada, Momiji, must aid them because the other Kushinada, Momiji&#x27;s twin sister Kaede Kunikida, is now dead. Momiji, wishing to discover more about the twin sister she never knew and also to fulfill her destiny, agrees to join the TAC under the protection of Kusanagi, who wishes to destroy his former masters, the Aragami.

The story becomes increasingly complex with the appearance of Murakumo, a man with eight mitamas who kills any Aragami he comes across for his own personal reasons. Kusanagi repeatedly attempts to kill Murakumo. Kaede reappears along with a strange energy field in Tokyo, and Murakumo and Kaede&#x27;s plans soon become clear – they intend to resurrect the god Susanoo and purify the world of humanity&#x27;s influences, with Kaede acting as the leader of the movement.

There is also a three episode OVA, &quot;Blue Seed Beyond&quot;, which takes place two years after the end of the TV series. It concerns what seems to be a resurgence of aragami (actually created via biotechnology), and introduces a new character, Valencia Tachibana. Like Kusanagi, she was implanted with a mitama without turning into a full aragami.

==Characters==
*: Momiji is the descendant of the &quot;Kushinada&quot; who actually lives in Izumo where Princess Kushinada lived. An eighth-grade student in middle school, she was unprepared to understand her destiny to battle the Aragami. She becomes a member of the TAC in order to stop the Aragami from destroying humanity and the world. An ironic twist of fate has Momiji carrying a mitama – an Aragami &quot;soul&quot; – embedded in her chest. At awkward times, Momiji is the recipient of panty shots and jokes about the type of panties she wears. Her relationship with Kusanagi takes a turn for the better during the shielded town incident, where she finally confesses her love for him, and he in turn tells her to wait for him. , Monica Rial (English, OVA)
*: He was given seven mitama with the expressed mission that when he was older, he would protect the Kushinada from harm. He was very close to Kaede, Momiji&#x27;s twin sister, before her sacrifice in the tunnels of Tokyo. After Kaede&#x27;s demise he initially goes to Momiji to kill her, in order to rid the world of the Aragami. He comes around, however, in the second episode, and from then on makes it his sole purpose to keep Momiji from harm and eventually falls in love with her. Kusanagi often pokes fun at Momiji&#x27;s choice of panties just to anger her. Kusanagi gains his 8th mitama from Momiji when he rescues her from danger in the last few episodes, which gives him the power to fight Murakumo on an even level. , Matt Kelley (English, OVA)
*: Daitetsu, or Mr. Kunikida, is the Chief Director of the TAC. When Kaede and Momiji were born, Mr. Kunikida raised Kaede like his own daughter, but he exploited her ability to track down and kill the Aragami. However, when Kaede sacrificed herself, he felt heartbroken. With Momiji in the TAC, Mr. Kunikida decides not to exploit her abilities like he did with Kaede and instead treated her like a normal girl. He usually drives a Citroën XM. 
*: Azusa is the science officer and experimental biologist in the TAC. Azusa is rarely on the field due to her research and development background. She constructs biological weapons for the TAC to use against the Aragami. She is a divorced mother of one. 
*: A former member of Tokyo Metropolitan Police, Ryoko uses her police instincts to help the TAC. Ryoko uses her standard police issue weapons in conjunction with weapons modified to be used against the Aragami. She is in love with Kunikida. 
*: Koume wears a pink jumpsuit, but never acts feminine. She is loud, brash and aggressive due to her stint in the Japan Self-Defense Forces. She was discharged by the SDF and transferred to the TAC as a result of insubordination. Her philosophy is based on the &quot;bigger gun&quot; theory and uses her military mind and muscle to destroy the Aragami. Despite her tough exterior, she is a vulnerable woman who wants to give her love. She has a soft spot for puppies, enjoys playing matchmaker to Momiji and Kusanagi, and at the end of the series, falls in love with co-worker Yaegashi. 
*: The stereotypical computer nerd, Yaegashi does computer analogy for the TAC. On off days, he enjoys hentai games on his computer. He also has a program that pinpoints the Aragami&#x27;s weak points and attacks, but it doubles as a program to predict what animal would appear on Momiji&#x27;s panties. He has a love/hate relationship with Koume through most of the series. He later gets engaged to her in the OVA. 
*: Sakura spent most of her life training in the United States. She uses Shinto magic and magic seals to stop the Aragami. She often flirts with Kusanagi just to get under the skin of Momiji, but also helps Momiji deal with the Aragami. 
*: Kaede is the twin sister of Momiji and Mr. Kunikida&#x27;s adopted daughter. Her talents were used to detect Aragami for the TAC, but after realizing she was merely a tool and not a person, she sacrificed herself, only to return on the side of the Aragami. It&#x27;s not well-shown if Kaede was in love with Kusanagi or not. 
*: Susano-Oh is an all-powerful god who is the guardian deity of the Aragami. In the legend, Susano-Oh killed the monster Yamata-no-Orochi and married the Princess Kushinada. Kaede and Murakumo awakened him as part of their plan to create a world of nothing but plants. 
*: The series&#x27; primary antagonist; like Kusanagi, Murakumo was also chosen to protect the Kushinada. Murakumo has embraced the power of the Aragami and plans on unleashing that power against humanity. Murakumo has eight Blue Seeds embedded in his body. 
*: Valencia shows up in the OVA. Like Kusanagi, she was implanted with a mitama without turning into a full aragami.

<text>William Lowson Mitchell-Thomson, 1st Baron Selsdon (15 April 1877 – 24 December 1938), known as Sir William Mitchell-Thomson, 2nd Baronet, from 1918 to 1932, was a Scottish politician who served as British Postmaster-General from 1924 till 1929.

==Biography==

Mitchell-Thomson was born at number 7 Carlton Terrace, Edinburgh, the son of Mitchell Mitchell-Thomson, Lord Provost of Edinburgh, who was created a baronet in 1900.

Mitchell-Thomson was educated at Winchester College and Balliol College, Oxford. He earned his LL.B with distinction from the University of Edinburgh in 1902. He joined the Scottish bar that same year, but spent several years traveling before returning to Scotland.

He was elected as a Unionist Member of Parliament for North West Lanarkshire in 1906, serving until his defeat at the January 1910 general election. He was an Irish Unionist Party MP for North Down from April 1910 until 1918.

During the First World War, he served as Director of Restriction of Enemy Supplies. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1918 New Year Honours.

Following the War, he was appointed the British representative on the Supreme Economic Council, followed by appointments as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food and the Board of Trade.

He was then MP for Glasgow Maryhill between 1918 and 1922, and Conservative MP for Croydon South, South London from 1923 to 1932.

In 1922, Mitchell-Thomson was Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade and from 1924 until 1929, he served as Postmaster General. During the General Strike of 1926, he served as Chief Civil Commissioner. He was made a Privy Counsellor in 1924.

In 1932, Mitchell-Thomson resigned from the House of Commons and was raised to the peerage as Baron Selsdon, of Croydon in the County of Surrey.

In May 1934 the British government appointed a committee, under the guidance of Lord Selsdon, to begin enquiries into the viability of setting up a public television service, with recommendations as to the conditions under which such a service could be offered. The results of the Selsdon Report were issued as a single Government White Paper in January of the following year. The BBC was to be entrusted with the development of television. Lord Selsdon was one of those to appear on the first day of BBC television broadcasts, 2 November 1936, now in his new capacity as Chairman of the Television Advisory Committee.

==Personal life==
Mitchell-Thomson was twice married. In 1907, he first married Madeleine, daughter of Sir Malcolm McEacharn, who was also known as Anne. They had a daughter who died in infancy, and a son, Peter. The marriage ended in divorce in 1932. The next year, he married Effie Lilian Loder Johnson, who as Effie Cook was a member of Pelissier&#x27;s Follies.

Lord Selsdon died at his home in 20 Grosvenor Square, London, in December 1938, aged 61. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, and his ashes were later buried in Edinburgh. His eldest son Peter, who became a well-known racing driver, succeeded him in his titles.

<text>Antoinette Jennings (born May 17, 1949) is an American politician who was the 16th lieutenant governor of Florida. 

== Life and career ==
She was nominated to the office by Governor Jeb Bush in February 2003 to replace Frank Brogan, who resigned to become president of Florida Atlantic University. She was sworn in on March 3, 2003, becoming the first woman to hold the office. She declined to run for governor in 2006 even though she was reputed to be Bush&#x27;s preferred choice as his successor.

After the 2006 elections, Jennings was replaced as lieutenant governor by Jeff Kottkamp, on January 2, 2007.

Jennings previously served in the Florida House of Representatives from 1976 to 1980, and in the Florida Senate, from 1980 to 2000. In 1994, when Orange County chairman Linda Chapin announced she was not seeking re-election, she failed to convince Jennings to return to Orlando and campaign for the office herself. Instead, she remained in Tallahassee to be elected by her Senate peers to be president of the Florida senate—the only person to have held that office for two terms, from 1996 to 2000. In 2000, legislative term limits came into effect, having been instituted by a constitutional referendum taken several years earlier. Jennings was thereafter prohibited from seeking reelection.

Before entering public service, Jennings was an elementary school teacher. During and after her tenure in the legislature, she also ran the family construction business. She is a graduate of Wesleyan College.

As lieutenant governor, she worked on legislative relations for Bush, on education policy, hurricane preparedness, disaster relief and issues related to the Space Coast in Florida.

She joined FPL&#x27;s board of directors a month after leaving office in 2007.

Jennings endorsed former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in the 2008 presidential primary election.

<doc id="1224698" wikidata="Q1813773" url="?curid=1224698" title="Synaptogenesis">
<text>Synaptogenesis is the formation of synapses between neurons in the nervous system. Although it occurs throughout a healthy person&#x27;s lifespan, an explosion of synapse formation occurs during early brain development, known as exuberant synaptogenesis. Synaptogenesis is particularly important during an individual&#x27;s critical period, during which there is a certain degree of synaptic pruning due to competition for neural growth factors by neurons and synapses. Processes that are not used, or inhibited during their critical period will fail to develop normally later on in life.

== Exuberant synaptogenesis ==
Brain growth and development begins during gestation and into the postnatal period. Brain development can be divided into stages including: neurogenesis, differentiation, proliferation, migration, synaptogenesis, gliogenesis and myelination, and apoptosis and synaptic pruning.

Synaptogenesis occurs in the third trimester during gestation as well as the first two years postnatal. During neuron differentiation, growth cones that extend off the tip of each axon act as the site for elongation of each axon. These growth cones find signal molecules which act as guidance cues and form synapses. Connections formed between neurites may be random or selective. 

=== Signaling molecules ===

==== UNC-4 transcription factor ====
What specific molecules and chemical signals are involved in synaptogenesis has yet to be fully understood. Some evidence posits that transcription factors are heavily involved in directing where axons and dendrites form synapses before and after synaptogenesis. The main study focusing on this involved motor neurons of &quot;C.elegans&quot;. In this study, researchers found that knockout animals without the gene, &quot;unc-4&quot; have motor defects specifically with moving backwards. This gene is necessary for the Prd-like homeodomain transcription factor. These animals also had abnormal synaptic specificity indicating that this transcription factor is likely involved in determining where and how synapses are formed.

Other studies found that this transcription factor was involved in synaptic strength. In this study, it was found that the u&quot;nc-4&quot; pathway negatively regulates &quot;ceh-12&quot;, a gene involved in regulating synaptic choice.

==== Growth cones and guidance cues ====
Guidance cues are essential for nervous system development as well as synaptic maintenance and remodeling. Guidance cues--attractive or repulsive--are sensed by growth cones. Expression of guidance cue genes is mediated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels. Most guidance cues converge onto various families of small GTPases which go back and forth from active to inactive forms. There are a multitude of signaling pathways involved in this process but the key ones involve netrins (NTNs) and fibronectin leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins (FLRTs), the &quot;Slit&quot; family, semamorphins (SEMA), ephrin, non-canonical genes (morphogens, chemokines, growth factors), and RTN4 receptors.

===== Netrin and FLRTs signaling pathways =====
NTNs and FLRTs both act as guidance cues. NTNs may act as attractants or repellents by DCC and neogenin1, or repellants by UNC5 receptors. UNC5s also act as repulsive receptors for FLRTs. Besides guidance cues, NTNs and FLRTs are also involved in synaptic specificity and synaptogenesis.

In studying Netrin, one study found that Netrin is not needed for long-range guidance decision, but is used for short-range synaptic targeting. This was determined from studying an RP3 axon, which expresses Netrin as an axonal guidance cue. In gene knockout studies of Netrin, the RP3 growth cone still formed the correct synapses but the connections were not strong.

== Synaptic adhesion molecules (SAMs) ==
Synaptic adhesion molecules (SAMs) have been presented by researchers as potentially key molecules involved in the organization of synaptic junctions. SAMs are involved in pre- to postsynaptic signaling and the reverse direction. 

=== Distribution ===
SAMs often form heterophilic complexes that differ based on location. For example, presynaptic SAMs are present on excitatory and inhibitory synapses. In comparison, post synaptic SAMs are very diverse and are specific for excitatory or inhibitory synapses.

=== Classification ===
The most well-studied SAMs involved in developing and mature synapses include neurexins and neuroligins, EphBs and ephrin-Bs, immunoglobulin (Ig)-containing cell adhesion molecules and cadherins. 

==== Neurexins and neuroligins ====
Studies demonstrate that both neurexins and neuroligins are involved in excitatory and inhibitory synapse formation. Neurexin-neuroligin interactions are also involved in the organization of pre- and postsynaptic terminal components. 

There are various subtypes of neurexins and neuroligins which determine their involvement in either excitatory or inhibitory synapse formation. α- and β-neurexin have similar intracellular domains but different sized extracellular domains. Neuroligins bind to neurexins. Neuroligin 1 is involved in excitatory specializations formation, but it depends on the results of alternative splicing. Neuroligin 2 is localized to inhibitory synapses. Neuroligin 3 is likely involved in excitatory synaptogenesis, but more research needs to be conducted on this. However, one study found that knockdown of all neuroligins leads to a decrease in frequency of inhibitory but not excitatory miniature synaptic currents. Both neurexin and neuroligins have a PDZ binding domain that determines what synaptic scaffolding proteins they interact with.

Another important role of neuroligins and neurexins is the determination of where a synapse forms. For example, co-clustering of neuroligin 1 to PSD-95 acts as a hotspot for presynaptic machinery.

==== EphBs and Ephrin-Bs ====
Ephs can be divided into A and B subclasses based on affinity for ephrin-A or ephrin-B ligands. Studies reveal that mainly &quot;EphB-ephrin-B&quot; interactions are involved in synaptogenesis. 

The binding of EphB to Ephrin-B leads to bidirectional signaling and contact-mediated transcellular signaling. During development, this interaction is primarily involved in axon guidance and boundary formation. However, these signaling molecules have also been shown to modify postsynaptic organization.

EphBs are particularly involved in excitatory synaptogenesis. When activated by soluble ephrin-B-Fc fusion protein, EphB induces clustering of NMDARs and AMPARs, an increase in the number of presynaptic terminals, and the formation of dendritic spines. Lastly, binding of Ephrin-B to EphB2 leads to interactions between the extracellular domains of the NMDAR and EphB2. 

==== Immunoglobulins ====
A key characteristic of Ig molecules is the diverse number of globular extracellular cysteine-looped domains. A number of members of the Ig superfamily have been identified as essential molecules for the organization of pre and post synaptic domains. These include synaptic cell adhesion molecules (SynCAM), synaptic adhesion-like molecules (SALMs), netrin G2 ligand (NGL2), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), etc. 
==== Cadherins ====
Neuronal (N)-cadherins are found in pre and postsynaptic terminals. Prior to differentiation, N-cadherins increase in quantity at axon-dendrite contact sites and eventually restrict their presence to sites around the active zone in mature neurons. N-cadherin is also involved in regulating AMPAR trafficking. Besides this, N-cadherin also plays a role in the maturation and stabilization of synaptic specializations. Lastly, N-cadherins help to control dendritic spine morphology and motility.

=== Function ===
The main function of SAMs in a broad sense includes forming the synapse and determining the properties of synapse. 

==== Synaptic specificity ====
In general, three processes are involved in determining the locations and properties of synapses. To determine location, axon guidance is coupled to partner choice which are processes both guided by SAMs. However, this process is still unclear. Previous studies demonstrate that axon guidance involves non-synaptic adhesion molecules. Researchers hypothesize that partner choice is initiated by SAMs. 

The mechanisms by which partner choice is determined is also not clear. However, three hypotheses have been proposed to help explain how synapse specificity is determined: 

# Partner is choice is determined and then synapse formation occurs, implying they are separate processes mechanistically
# Partner choice and synapse formation are the same process and both are determined by SAMs 
# Synapse formation occurs and then a selective elimination process.

However, studies observing a heterologous synapse formation assay and the involvement of SAM in non neuronal cells indicates that hypothesis 1 and 2 are most likely. 

Currently, the only SAMs known to be involved in establishing proteins are: postsynaptic adhesion-GPCRs called latrophilins and brain angiogenesis inhibitors. Similarly, teneurins have been presented as mediators in synapse formation. 

==== Properties of Synapses ====
The properties of synapses is likely shaped by bidirectional signaling between pre- and postsynaptic specialization and are mediated partly by SAMS. This is demonstrated by studies of neurexins, the most common type of SAMs. 

Recent studies demonstrate that neurexins are necessary for organizing functional synapses and perform important functions depending on the type of neuron. This is generated by different neurexin isoforms. One example is the difference in function between presynaptic neurexin-1 containing an insert in SS4 (Nrxn1−SS4+) and neurexin-1 lacking an insert in SS4 (Nrxn1−SS4+) generated by alternative splicing. Nrxn1−SS4+ is involved in the trans-synaptic increase in postsynaptic NMDAR levels.

Other SAMs have a similar diversity in function. For example, LAR-PTPRs are also involved in NMDAR-mediated synapse responses. However, the main difference between LAR-PTPRs and neurexin-1 is that in neurexin-1 mediated signaling, surface levels of NMDARs are changed.

==Formation of the neuromuscular junction==

=== Function ===
The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the most well-characterized synapse in that it provides a simple and accessible structure that allows for easy manipulation and observation. The synapse itself is composed of three cells: the motor neuron, the myofiber, and the Schwann cell. In a normally functioning synapse, a signal will cause the motor neuron to depolarize, by releasing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). Acetylcholine travels across the synaptic cleft where it reaches acetylcholine receptors (AChR) on the plasma membrane of the myofiber, the sarcolemma. As the AChRs open ion channels, the membrane depolarizes, causing muscle contraction. The entire synapse is covered in a myelin sheath provided by the Schwann cell to insulate and encapsulate the junction. Another important part of the neuromuscular system and central nervous system are the astrocytes. While originally they were thought to have only functioned as support for the neurons, they play an important role in functional plasticity of synapses.

===Origin and movement of cells===
During development, each of the three germ layer cell types arises from different regions of the growing embryo. The individual myoblasts originate in the mesoderm and fuse to form a multi-nucleated myotube. During or shortly after myotube formation, motoneurons from the neural tube form preliminary contacts with the myotube. The Schwann cells arise from the neural crest and are led by the axons to their destination. Upon reaching it, they form a loose, unmyelinated covering over the innervating axons. The movement of the axons (and subsequently the Schwann cells) is guided by the growth cone, a filamentous projection of the axon that actively searches for neurotrophins released by the myotube.

The specific patterning of synapse development at the neuromuscular junction shows that the majority of muscles are innervated at their midpoints. Although it may seem that the axons specifically target the midpoint of the myotube, several factors reveal that this is not a valid claim. It appears that after the initial axonal contact, the newly formed myotube proceeds to grow symmetrically from that point of innervation. Coupled with the fact that AChR density is the result of axonal contact instead of the cause, the structural patterns of muscle fibers can be attributed to both myotatic growth as well as axonal innervation.

The preliminary contact formed between the motor neuron and the myotube generates synaptic transmission almost immediately, but the signal produced is very weak. There is evidence that Schwann cells may facilitate these preliminary signals by increasing the amount of spontaneous neurotransmitter release through small molecule signals. After about a week, a fully functional synapse is formed following several types of differentiation in both the post-synaptic muscle cell and the pre-synaptic motor neuron. This pioneer axon is of crucial importance because the new axons that follow have a high propensity for forming contacts with well-established synapses.

===Post-synaptic differentiation===
The most noticeable difference in the myotube following contact with the motor neuron is the increased concentration of AChR in the plasma membrane of the myotube in the synapse. This increased amount of AChR allows for more effective transmission of synaptic signals, which in turn leads to a more-developed synapse. The density of AChR is &gt; 10,000/μm2 and approximately 10/μm2 around the edge. This high concentration of AChR in the synapse is achieved through clustering of AChR, up-regulation of the AChR gene transcription in the post-synaptic nuclei, and down-regulation of the AChR gene in the non-synaptic nuclei. The signals that initiate post-synaptic differentiation may be neurotransmitters released directly from the axon to the myotube, or they may arise from changes activated in the extracellular matrix of the synaptic cleft.

====Clustering====

AChR experiences multimerization within the post-synaptic membrane largely due to the signaling molecule Agrin. The axon of the motoneuron releases agrin, a proteoglycan that initiates a cascade that eventually leads to AChR association. Agrin binds to a muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) receptor in the post-synaptic membrane, and this in turn leads to downstream activation of the cytoplasmic protein Rapsyn. Rapsyn contains domains that allow for AChR association and multimerization, and it is directly responsible for AChR clustering in the post-synaptic membrane: rapsyn-deficient mutant mice fail to form AChR clusters.

====Synapse-specific transcription====

The increased concentration of AChR is not simply due to a rearrangement of pre-existing synaptic components. The axon also provides signals that regulate gene expression within the myonuclei directly beneath the synapse. This signaling provides for localized up-regulation of transcription of AChR genes and consequent increase in local AChR concentration. The two signaling molecules released by the axon are calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and neuregulin, which trigger a series of kinases that eventually lead to transcriptional activation of the AChR genes.

====Extrasynaptic repression====

Repression of the AChR gene in the non-synaptic nuclei is an activity-dependent process involving the electrical signal generated by the newly formed synapse. Reduced concentration of AChR in the extrasynaptic membrane in addition to increased concentration in the post-synaptic membrane helps ensure the fidelity of signals sent by the axon by localizing AChR to the synapse. Because the synapse begins receiving inputs almost immediately after the motoneuron comes into contact with the myotube, the axon quickly generates an action potential and releases ACh. The depolarization caused by AChR induces muscle contraction and simultaneously initiates repression of AChR gene transcription across the entire muscle membrane. Note that this affects gene transcription at a distance: the receptors that are embedded within the post-synaptic membrane are not susceptible to repression.

===Pre-synaptic differentiation===
Although the mechanisms regulating pre-synaptic differentiation are unknown, the changes exhibited at the developing axon terminal are well characterized. The pre-synaptic axon shows an increase in synaptic volume and area, an increase of synaptic vesicles, clustering of vesicles at the active zone, and polarization of the pre-synaptic membrane. These changes are thought to be mediated by neurotrophin and cell adhesion molecule release from muscle cells, thereby emphasizing the importance of communication between the motoneuron and the myotube during synaptogenesis. Like post-synaptic differentiation, pre-synaptic differentiation is thought to be due to a combination of changes in gene expression and a redistribution of pre-existing synaptic components. Evidence for this can be seen in the up-regulation of genes expressing vesicle proteins shortly after synapse formation as well as their localization at the synaptic terminal.

===Synaptic maturation===
Immature synapses are innervated at birth, due to the high propensity for new axons to innervate at a pre-existing synapse. As the synapse matures, the synapses segregate and eventually all axonal inputs except for one retract in a process called synapse elimination. Furthermore, the post-synaptic end plate grows deeper and creates folds through invagination to increase the surface area available for neurotransmitter reception. At birth, Schwann cells form loose, unmyelinated covers over groups of synapses, but as the synapse matures, Schwann cells become dedicated to a single synapse and form a myelinated cap over the entire neuromuscular junction.

====Synapse elimination====

The process of synaptic pruning known as synapse elimination is a presumably activity-dependent process that involves competition between axons. Hypothetically, a synapse strong enough to produce an action potential will trigger the myonuclei directly across from the axon to release synaptotrophins that will strengthen and maintain well-established synapses. This synaptic strengthening is not conferred upon the weaker synapses, thereby starving them out. It has also been suggested that in addition to the synaptotrophins released to the synapse exhibiting strong activity, the depolarization of the post-synaptic membrane causes release of synaptotoxins that ward off weaker axons.

===Synapse formation specificity===
A remarkable aspect of synaptogenesis is the fact that motor neurons are able to distinguish between fast and slow-twitch muscle fibers; fast-twitch muscle fibers are innervated by &quot;fast&quot; motor neurons, and slow-twitch muscle fibers are innervated by &quot;slow&quot; motor neurons. There are two hypothesized paths by which the axons of motor neurons achieve this specificity, one in which the axons actively recognize the muscles that they innervate and make selective decisions based on inputs, and another that calls for more indeterminate innervation of muscle fibers. In the selective paths, the axons recognize the fiber type, either by factors or signals released specifically by the fast or slow-twitch muscle fibers. In addition, selectivity can be traced to the lateral position that the axons are predeterminately arranged in order to link them to the muscle fiber that they will eventually innervate. The hypothesized non-selective pathways indicate that the axons are guided to their destinations by the matrix through which they travel. Essentially, a path is laid out for the axon and the axon itself is not involved in the decision-making process. Finally, the axons may non-specifically innervate muscle fibers and cause the muscles to acquire the characteristics of the axon that innervates them. In this path, a &quot;fast&quot; motoneuron can convert any muscle fiber into a fast-twitch muscle fiber. There is evidence for both selective and non-selective paths in synapse formation specificity, leading to the conclusion that the process is a combination of several factors.

== Synapse formation==
Although the study of synaptogenesis within the central nervous system (CNS) is much more recent than that of the NMJ, there is promise of relating the information learned at the NMJ to synapses within the CNS. Many similar structures and basic functions exist between the two types of neuronal connections. At the most basic level, the CNS synapse and the NMJ both have a nerve terminal that is separated from the postsynaptic membrane by a cleft containing specialized extracellular material. Both structures exhibit localized vesicles at the active sites, clustered receptors at the post-synaptic membrane, and glial cells that encapsulate the entire synaptic cleft. In terms of synaptogenesis, both synapses exhibit differentiation of the pre- and post-synaptic membranes following initial contact between the two cells. This includes the clustering of receptors, localized up-regulation of protein synthesis at the active sites, and neuronal pruning through synapse elimination.

Despite these similarities in structure, there is a fundamental difference between the two connections. The CNS synapse is strictly neuronal and does not involve muscle fibers: for this reason the CNS uses different neurotransmitter molecules and receptors. More importantly, neurons within the CNS often receive multiple inputs that must be processed and integrated for successful transfer of information. Muscle fibers are innervated by a single input and operate in an all or none fashion. Coupled with the plasticity that is characteristic of the CNS neuronal connections, it is easy to see how increasingly complex CNS circuits can become.

=== Regulation ===

====Signaling====

The main method of synaptic signaling in the NMJ is through use of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and its receptor. The CNS homolog is glutamate and its receptors, and one of special significance is the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. It has been shown that activation of NMDA receptors initiates synaptogenesis through activation of downstream products. The heightened level of NMDA receptor activity during development allows for increased influx of calcium, which acts as a secondary signal. Eventually, immediate early genes are activated by transcription factors and the proteins required for neuronal differentiation are translated. The NMDA receptor function is associated with the estrogen receptor in hippocampal neurons. Experiments conducted with estradiol show that exposure to the estrogen significantly increases synaptic density and protein concentration.

Synaptic signaling during synaptogenesis is not only activity-dependent, but is also dependent on the environment in which the neurons are located. For instance, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is produced by the brain and regulates several functions within the developing synapse, including enhancement of transmitter release, increased concentration of vesicles, and cholesterol biosynthesis. Cholesterol is essential to synaptogenesis because the lipid rafts that it forms provide a scaffold upon which numerous signaling interactions can occur. BDNF-null mutants show significant defects in neuronal growth and synapse formation. Aside from neurotrophins, cell-adhesion molecules are also essential to synaptogenesis. Often the binding of pre-synaptic cell-adhesion molecules with their post-synaptic partners triggers specializations that facilitate synaptogenesis. Indeed, a defect in genes encoding neuroligin, a cell-adhesion molecule found in the post-synaptic membrane, has been linked to cases of autism and mental retardation. Finally, many of these signaling processes can be regulated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) as the targets of many MMPs are these specific cell-adhesion molecules.

====Morphology====

The special structure found in the CNS that allows for multiple inputs is the dendritic spine, the highly dynamic site of excitatory synapses. This morphological dynamism is due to the specific regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which in turn allows for regulation of synapse formation. Dendritic spines exhibit three main morphologies: filopodia, thin spines, and mushroom spines. The filopodia play a role in synaptogenesis through initiation of contact with axons of other neurons. Filopodia of new neurons tend to associate with multiply synapsed axons, while the filopodia of mature neurons tend to sites devoid of other partners. The dynamism of spines allows for the conversion of filopodia into the mushroom spines that are the primary sites of glutamate receptors and synaptic transmission.

==Contributions of the Wnt protein family==

The (Wnt) family, includes several embryonic morphogens that contribute to early pattern formation in the developing embryo. Recently data have emerged showing that the Wnt protein family has roles in the later development of synapse formation and plasticity. Wnt contribution to synaptogenesis has been verified in both the central nervous system and the neuromuscular junction.

===Central nervous system===

Wnt family members contribute to synapse formation in the cerebellum by inducing presynaptic and postsynaptic terminal formation. This brain region contains three main neuronal cell types- Purkinje cells, granule cells and mossy fiber cells. Wnt-3 expression contributes to Purkinje cell neurite outgrowth and synapse formation. Granule cells express Wnt-7a to promote axon spreading and branching in their synaptic partner, mossy fiber cells. secretion of Wnt-7a to mossy fiber cells causes growth cone enlargement by spreading microtubules. Furthermore, Wnt-7a retrograde signaling recruits synaptic vesicles and presynaptic proteins to the synaptic active zone. Wnt-5a performs a similar function on postsynaptic granule cells; this Wnt stimulates receptor assembly and clustering of the scaffolding protein PSD-95.

In the hippocampus Wnts in conjunction with cell electrical activity promote synapse formation. Wnt7b is expressed in maturing dendrites, and the expression of the Wnt receptor Frizzled (Fz), increases highly with synapse formation in the hippocampus. NMDA glutamate receptor activation increases Wnt2 expression. Long term potentiation (LTP) due to NMDA activation and subsequent Wnt expression leads to Fz-5 localization at the postsynaptic active zone. Furthermore, Wnt7a and Wnt2 signaling after NMDA receptor mediated LTP leads to increased dendritic arborization and regulates activity induced synaptic plasticity. Blocking Wnt expression in the hippocampus mitigates these activity dependent effects by reducing dendritic arborization and subsequently, synaptic complexity.

===Neuromuscular junction===

Similar mechanisms of action by Wnts in the central nervous system are observed in the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as well. In the Drosophila NMJ mutations in the Wnt5 receptor Derailed (drl) reduce the number of and density of synaptic active zones. The major neurotransmitter in this system is glutamate. Wnt is needed to localize glutamatergic receptors on postsynaptic muscle cells. As a result, Wnt mutations diminish evoked currents on the postsynaptic muscle.

In the vertebrate NMJ, motor neuron expression of Wnt-11r contributes to acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering in the postsynaptic density of muscle cells. Wnt-3 is expressed by muscle fibers and is secreted retrogradely onto motor neurons. In motor neurons, Wnt-3 works with Agrin to promote growth cone enlargement, axon branching and synaptic vesicle clustering.

== Synaptogenesis in the Mature Brain ==
Although synaptogenesis occurs more commonly in the developing brain, imaging reveals that approximately 40% of dendritic spines found in the sensory and motor cortices are replaces every 5 days. [1]

== Environmental enrichment ==
Rats raised with environmental enrichment have 25% more synapses than controls.[2][3] This effect occurs whether a more stimulating environment is experienced immediately following birth,[4] after weaning,[2][3][5] or during maturity.[6]Stimulation effects not only synaptogenesis upon pyramidal neurons but also stellate ones.[7]

<doc id="1224705" wikidata="Q6842693" url="?curid=1224705" title="Midnight Judges Act">
<text>The Midnight Judges Act (also known as the Judiciary Act of 1801; , and officially An act to provide for the more convenient organization of the Courts of the United States) expanded the federal judiciary of the United States. The act was supported by the John Adams administration and the Federalist Party. Passage of the act has been described as &quot;the last major policy achievement of the Federalists.&quot;

Opponents of the act argued that there was no need to expand the federal judiciary; that the judicial appointments were intended to cement Federalist Party control of the judiciary; and that appointments were rushed (hence they were stigmatized as &quot;midnight appointments&quot;). The act was repealed by the incoming Thomas Jefferson administration.

It represented an effort to solve an issue in the U.S. Supreme Court during the early 19th century. There was concern, beginning in 1789, about the system that required the justices of the Supreme Court to &quot;ride circuit&quot; and reiterate decisions made in the appellate courts. The Supreme Court justices had often expressed concern and suggested that the judges of the Supreme and circuit courts be divided. The Act was repealed by Congress on January 22, 1802.

==Effect on judicial divisions and authority==
The Act became law on February 13, 1801 and reduced the number of seats on the Supreme Court from 6 to 5, effective upon the next vacancy in the Court. No such vacancy occurred during the brief period the Act was in effect, so the size of the Court remained unchanged. The Act also created 16 new judgeships that John Adams rapidly began to fill in the last weeks of his presidency. These judges came to be known as the &quot;Midnight Judges&quot;.

The Act reorganized the circuit courts, doubling them in number from three to six, and created three new circuit judgeships for each circuit (except the sixth, which received only one circuit judge). In addition to creating new lifetime posts for Federal judges, the circuit judgeships were intended to relieve the Justices of the Supreme Court from the hardships of riding circuit (that is, sitting as judges on the circuit courts). The circuit judge-ships were abolished in 1802, and the Justices continued to ride circuit until 1879. One of the judges on the Supreme Court appointed by Adams was Chief Justice John Marshall.

The Act also reorganized the district courts, creating ten. These courts were to be presided over by the existing district judges in most cases. In addition to subdividing several of the existing district courts, it created the District of Ohio which covered the Northwest and Indiana Territories, and the District of Potomac from the District of Columbia and pieces of Maryland and Virginia, which was the first time a federal judicial district crossed state lines. However, the district courts for Kentucky and Tennessee were abolished, and their judges reassigned to the circuit courts.

In addition, it gave the circuit courts jurisdiction to hear &quot;all cases in law or equity, arising under the constitution and laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority.&quot; This form of jurisdiction, now known as federal question jurisdiction, had not previously been granted to the federal courts.

==The Midnight Judges==

In the 19 days between passage of this Act and the conclusion of his administration, President Adams quickly filled as many of the newly created circuit judgeships as possible. The new judges were known as the Midnight Judges because Adams was said to be signing their appointments at midnight prior to President Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s inauguration. The famous Supreme Court case of &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; involved one of these &quot;midnight&quot; appointments, although it was an appointment of a justice of the peace for the District of Columbia—which was authorized under a different Act of Congress, not the Judiciary Act.

Attempts to solve this situation before and throughout the presidency of John Adams were overshadowed by more pressing foreign and domestic issues that occupied Congress during the early years of the nation&#x27;s development. None of those attempts to fix the situation facing the Supreme Court were successful until John Adams took control in 1797. Faced with the Election of 1800, a watershed moment in American history that represented not only the struggle to correctly organize the foundation of the United States government but also the culmination of struggle between the waning Federalist Party and the rising Democratic-Republican Party, John Adams successfully reorganized the nation&#x27;s court system with the Judiciary Act of 1801.

==The 1800 elections==
During the 1800 elections, there was an intense growth of partisan politics, the political party of the executive branch of government changed for the first time, and there was an unprecedented peaceful transition of the political orientation of the country&#x27;s leadership. The main issues in this election were taxes, the military, peace negotiations with France, and the Alien and Sedition Acts and Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions. The campaign leading up to this election and the election itself revealed sharp divisions within the Federalist Party. Alexander Hamilton and the extreme Federalists attacked Adams for his persistence for peace with France, his opposition to building an army, and his failure to enforce the Alien and Sedition Acts.

The results of this election favored Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr over Adams, but both Jefferson and Burr got 73 electoral votes. Presented with a tie, the House of Representatives, which was dominated by Federalists and led by Alexander Hamilton, eventually decided the election in favor of Thomas Jefferson. Democratic-Republicans also won control of the legislative branch of government after the congressional elections.

Jefferson was inaugurated on March 4, 1801 without the presence of Adams. Jefferson&#x27;s inaugural address attempted to appease the Federalists by promising to maintain the strength of the federal government and to pay off the national debt. Jefferson spoke of dangerous &quot;entangling alliances&quot; with foreign countries as President George Washington had done before him, and made a plea for national unity claiming that &quot;we are all republicans and we are all federalists.&quot; Once in office, Jefferson set out to rescind the Judiciary Act of 1801 and remove newly appointed Federalists.

==&quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;==
The implications of Adams&#x27;s actions in appointing Federalists to the Supreme Court and the federal courts, led to one of the most important decisions in American judicial history. &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; solidified the United States&#x27; system of checks and balances and gave the judicial branch equal power with the executive and legislative branches. This controversial case began with Adams&#x27; appointment of Federalist William Marbury as a justice of the peace in the District of Columbia. When the newly appointed Secretary of State James Madison refused to process Marbury&#x27;s selection, Marbury requested a writ of mandamus, which would force Madison to make his appointment official. Chief Justice John Marshall declared that the Supreme Court did not have the authority to force Madison to make the appointment official. This statement actually challenged the Judiciary Act of 1789, which stated that the Supreme Court did, in fact, have the right to issue those writs. Marshall, therefore, ruled that part of the Judiciary Act of 1789 unconstitutional because the Constitution did not expressly grant this power to the judiciary. In deciding the constitutionality of an act of Congress, Marshall established judicial review, the most significant development in the history of the Supreme Court.

==Impeachment of Samuel Chase==

Among the repercussions of the repeal of the Judiciary Act was the first and, to date, only impeachment of a sitting Supreme Court Justice, Samuel Chase. Chase, a Federalist appointed to the Supreme Court by George Washington, had publicly attacked the repeal in May 1803 while issuing his charge to a grand jury in Baltimore, Maryland: &quot;The late alteration of the federal judiciary ... will take away all security for property and personal liberty, and our Republican constitution will sink into a mobocracy, the worst of all popular governments.&quot; Jefferson responded to the attack by suggesting to his supporters in the U.S. House of Representatives that Chase be impeached, asking, &quot;Ought the seditious and official attack on the principles of our Constitution . . .to go unpunished?&quot; The House took Jefferson&#x27;s suggestion, impeaching Chase in 1804. He was acquitted by the Senate of all charges in March 1805, with Vice President Aaron Burr presiding.

==Federal question jurisdiction==
The repeal of the Judiciary Act also ended the brief period of comprehensive federal-question jurisdiction. The federal courts would not receive such jurisdiction again until 1875.

<text>CJRQ-FM (92.7 MHz) is a Canadian radio station, which broadcasts in Sudbury, Ontario. The station uses the on-air brand &quot;Q92&quot;. The station airs a mainstream rock format and is owned by Rogers Radio, a division of Rogers Sports &amp; Media.

The station first aired as CJRQ-FM in 1990. From 1935 to 1990, it was an AM station, airing under the call letters CKSO.

==History==
===CKSO===
The station was launched in 1935 under the ownership of W. E. Mason, the owner and publisher of the &quot;Sudbury Star&quot;. CKSO&#x27;s original frequency was at 780 kHz, until it moved to 790 kHz in 1941. For much of its history, the station was an affiliate of the CBC&#x27;s Trans-Canada Network. CKSO was the first commercial radio station in northern Ontario.

Following Mason&#x27;s death in 1948, ownership was passed to a charitable foundation set up by his estate, with the Sudbury Memorial Hospital as the primary beneficiary. The station was acquired by Sudbury businessmen George Miller, Jim Cooper and Bill Plaunt in 1950; the same trio subsequently launched CKSO-TV, the city&#x27;s first television station, in 1953.

In 1976, 790 CKSO received approval to increase their power from 10,000 watts day and 5,000 watts night to 50,000 watts full-time. Following the power increase, the station&#x27;s AM signal could be heard as far away as Europe and some areas of the United States during the nighttime hours.

CKSO disaffiliated from CBC Radio in 1978 after CBCS-FM signed on.

CKSO and sister station CIGM were by this time owned by Cambrian Broadcasting, who sold them to United Broadcasting in 1979 as part of the corporate restructuring that created Mid-Canada Communications as the new holder of the CKSO-TV license.

In 1986, United sold CKSO and CIGM to Telemedia.

In the 1980s, the station aired an adult contemporary format, distinguishing itself from competitor CHNO&#x27;s more youth-oriented Top 40/CHR format. During this era, the station used brandings such as &quot;Radio 79 CKSO&quot;, &quot;Music Radio CKSO&quot; and &quot;Favourite Hits AM 790&quot;.

===Conversion to CJRQ-FM===
On March 16, 1990, the CRTC approved Telemedia Communications Ontario Inc.&#x27;s application to amend the Promise of Performance for CIGM-FM by changing the music format from Group III (Country and Country-Oriented) to Group IV (40% Pop and Rock-Softer; 60% Pop and Rock-Harder). Two months later on May 18, 1990, CKSO and CIGM swapped frequencies. CIGM moved to CKSO&#x27;s 790 slot on the AM band, and CKSO took on the new call letters CJRQ and CIGM&#x27;s 92.7 FM frequency. The new rock format signed on as &quot;Q92&quot;.

After the 1990 swap, the CKSO call sign no longer existed in the Sudbury area until CKSO-FM, a Christian music station which had no ownership affiliation with CJRQ, signed on in 2003.

While CKSO had been a perennial second in the radio ratings against CHNO, CJRQ quickly became the most-listened to radio station in Northern Ontario, and retained that status until the late 1990s, when CJMX&#x27;s adult contemporary format overtook CJRQ in the ratings. The station took its biggest ratings hit after CHNO converted to the FM band in 2000, dropping to 22.9 per cent of the radio audience in 2000 from 30.9 per cent in 1999.

In 1997, the station was censured by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council over a 1995 broadcast. The station aired a daily programming feature in which it asked a daily poll question on an issue in the news, and subsequently broadcast a selection of listener comments; the CBSC complaint pertained to a question about whether the Ontario Health Insurance Plan should cover sex-reassignment surgery for transgender residents of the province, and one listener comment that was broadcast was singled out as especially homophobic and transphobic.

In 1999, Telemedia acquired CJMX from the Pelmorex Radio Network as well. In 2002, Telemedia was purchased by Standard Broadcasting. Shortly afterward, Standard sold CJRQ, CIGM and CJMX to Rogers Communications.

In 2009, CJRQ&#x27;s longtime sister station AM 790 CIGM was sold to Newcap Broadcasting and moved to the FM dial in August that same year.

On June 7, 2016, Q92 was rebranded as &quot;92.7 Rock&quot; retaining the slogan and rock format. This was the first time CJRQ rebranded since the station signed on as &quot;Q92&quot; on May 18, 1990.

The station uses the same general format as, and shares some programming with, CKFX-FM in North Bay and CJQQ-FM in Timmins. The stations currently air a mixture of locally hosted dayparts with syndicated programming, including the &quot;Brock &amp; Dalby&quot; morning show from CIKR-FM Kingston, and the internationally syndicated &quot;Greg Beharrell Show&quot; in the evenings.

On June 28, 2024, Rogers dropped the &quot;92.7 Rock&quot; branding and resurrected the original 1990s &quot;Q92&quot; branding. Rogers had also resurrected the original 1990s brandings for CJQQ-FM Timmins (as &quot;Q92&quot;) and CKFX-FM North Bay (as &quot;101.9 The Fox&quot;).

==Former logos==
==Notes==

C.K.S.O. Road near McFarlane Lake off Highway 69, was named after the radio station, CKSO, as the station&#x27;s transmitter was formerly located on that road.

In 2004, Doug McCann a former broadcaster at CKSO created a website, and later a Facebook page to keep in touch with the people he worked with at CKSO and providing historical information on the station. In 2021, McCann also published a book about The Story of the Birth of Broadcasting in Sudbury.

<text>Neil Fairbrother (born Neil Harvey Fairbrother; 9 September 1963) is an English former cricketer who played 75 One Day International matches and 10 Test matches as a batsman for England. Fairbrother, named by his mother after her favourite player, the Australian cricketer Neil Harvey, was educated at Lymm Grammar School and played his county cricket for Lancashire. Although primarily a one day player at international level, he had strong success in the County Championship and had a first class high score of 366. He was a part of the English squad which finished as runners-up at the 1992 Cricket World Cup.

Fairbrother retired from all cricket in 2002, and became Director of Cricket at International Sports Management. He was also a player manager for a time, managing among others Andrew Flintoff. In February 2018, Fairbrother set up Phoenix Management.

==Domestic career==
Fairbrother played for Lancashire, Transvaal and England. He was team captain of Lancashire in 1992–1993. Cricket writer, Colin Bateman, described Fairbrother as &quot;an inventive, intelligent left-hander&quot;.

In 1990, Fairbrother scored 366 for Lancashire against Surrey at The Oval. 311 of his runs came in a single day, and his feat is unique in that he scored at least 100 runs in each of the three sessions that day. Another milestone came in 1998, when he became the first man to play in ten Lord&#x27;s one-day domestic cricket cup finals. Fairbrother finished on the winning side in seven of these finals, including the Benson and Hedges Cup in 1984, when he top-scored for his side aged 20, and both the Benson and Hedges Cup and NatWest Trophy in both 1990 and 1996. He also helped Lancashire to success in the Refuge Assurance Cup in 1988 and the National League (formerly the Refuge Assurance League) in 1989 and 1999.

==International career==
Fairbrother made his international debut on 2 April 1987, in a One Day International against India. Following a match-winning century against a West Indies side including Malcolm Marshall, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh at Lord&#x27;s in 1991, he established himself as a regular in middle-order of the one-day side for several years. Test success, however, proved elusive. Bowled for a duck on his debut, he made just ten Test appearances for England, with only one half-century from 15 innings, at an average of 15.64. However, his international honours included appearing for England in three Cricket World Cups. Chief among the world cup appearances was the 1992 World Cup Final where Fairbrother topscored for England with a gritty 62 off 70 balls and almost pulled off an improbable chase.

<doc id="1224735" wikidata="Q7907362" url="?curid=1224735" title="VOAR-FM">
<text>VOAR-FM (96.7 MHz) is a Canadian radio station, which airs a Christian radio format. It is licensed to Mount Pearl, Newfoundland and Labrador, and serves the St. John&#x27;s metropolitan area. VOAR is owned by the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Newfoundland and Labrador. Its radio studios and offices are on Topsail Road in Mount Pearl. 

VOAR-FM is a Class C FM station. The transmitter is off Kenmount Road, also in Mount Pearl. The effective radiated power (ERP) is 100,000 watts, the maximum for most Canadian FM stations.

==Programming==
VOAR airs a blend of Christian talk and teaching programs along with Contemporary Christian music. Religious leaders heard on VOAR include Charles Stanley, Jim Daly, Joni Eareckson Tada and Chuck Swindoll.

==History==
===Early years===
VOAR first began broadcasting in the fall of 1929 as 8BSL. In 1930, the station was renamed 8RA. It received the call sign VONA (Voice of the North Atlantic) in 1931 (using the ITU prefix VO that was assigned to the Dominion of Newfoundland before it joined Canada. It later switched to VOAC (Voice of the Adventist Church) in 1933, then once more to its current call sign, VOAR (Voice of Adventist Radio) in 1938. VOAR is one of four Canadian stations, along with VOWR 800, VOCM 590 and VOCM-FM 97.5, to still use call signs beginning with VO rather than C.

Over the years, the station switched its frequency several times. From the 1950s through 1991, it broadcast at 1230 kHz, originally powered at only 100 watts.

It then moved to its final AM frequency, 1210. The new dial position was coupled with a boost in power to 10,000 watts, which was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in 1991. But because 1210 is a clear channel frequency reserved for Class A WPHT Philadelphia, VOAR used a directional antenna to avoid interference. It later moved its city of license from St. John&#x27;s to Mount Pearl, the community where its transmitter and studios are located.

===Expanding through Canada===
In 2002, VOAR began adding a network of FM rebroadcasters, while the main station was still being heard on the AM band in St. John&#x27;s. At first, the rebroadcasting stations were in small communities around Newfoundland and Labrador.

In recent years, VOAR has expanded into other provinces and territories. It currently has about 30 rebroadcasters, stretching across Canada. It is heard in four provinces and in the Northwest Territories.

===Moving to FM===

On October 6, 2016, the CRTC received an application from VOAR to move to the FM band, with the call sign VOAR-FM. The proposed new station would have an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts. At the same time, it would shut down its AM signal and its Bay Roberts repeater, VOAR-1-FM 95.9. The other VOAR repeaters would begin simulcasting the new FM signal. Reasons for the conversion request stated in the application were listener confusion with VOWR 800 AM (both stations receive each other&#x27;s mail), signal reception issues in portions of the St. John&#x27;s area, and the AM station&#x27;s transmitter (installed in 1990) reaching the end of its usable life.

On June 27, 2017, the CRTC approved VOAR&#x27;s application to replace its AM radio station VOAR and its rebroadcaster in Bay Roberts. The new FM station in Mount Pearl would operate at 96.7 MHz with an ERP of 100,000 watts using a non-directional antenna at a height above average terrain (HAAT) of 156.8 metres. VOAR began testing its new FM transmitter in December 2018. It officially signed on the air the following month.

VOAR completed its transitions to FM with the station&#x27;s moniker becoming &quot;Lighthouse FM&quot;. On January 10, 2020, the AM signal shut down.

==Rebroadcasters==
In 2002, VOAR added several FM rebroadcasters in various parts of the province, too far from St. John&#x27;s to get a clear signal from the AM transmitter. Over the years, other rebroadcasters were added in other Canadian provinces and territories. VOAR is also carried across Canada on Bell Satellite TV Channel 950 and locally on Rogers Cable Channel 929.

A new broadcasting license was issued in 2008. Also in 2008, several transmitters were put on the air in British Columbia.
The station also had repeaters in Prince George, British Columbia 107.3 (VF2510); Kamloops 105.1 (VF2525); Kelowna 98.9; and Oliver 106.1 (VF2524). However, they were taken off the air due to licensing issues with the CRTC in January 2009. The station also had applications to expand into 25 additional communities in British Columbia in early 2009.

<doc id="1224736" wikidata="Q962932" url="?curid=1224736" title="John Drew Barrymore">
<text>John Drew Barrymore (born John Blyth Barrymore Jr.; June 4, 1932 – November 29, 2004) was an American film actor and member of the Barrymore family of actors, which included his father, John Barrymore, and his father&#x27;s siblings, Lionel and Ethel. He was the father of four children, including actor John Blyth Barrymore and actress Drew Barrymore. Diana Barrymore was his half-sister from his father&#x27;s second marriage.

==Early life==
Barrymore was born in Los Angeles to John Barrymore (born John Blyth) and silent film actress Dolores Costello. His parents separated when he was 18 months old, and he rarely saw his father afterward. Educated at private schools, he made his film debut at 17, billed as John Barrymore Jr. One of the schools he attended was the Hollywood Professional School. His mother attempted to dissuade him from entering acting, sending him to St. John’s Military Academy. In 1945, at age 13, Barrymore and his cousin Dirk Drew Davenport enlisted in the United States Navy to fight in World War II, posing as 17 year olds. As both were tall for their age, the military did not discover until several weeks later that the boys were below the minimum enlistment age and they were subsequently sent home.

==Career==
===Early films===

Barrymore&#x27;s film career began with a small role in &quot;The Sundowners&quot; (1950), a Western with Robert Preston. As he was a minor he needed his mother&#x27;s permission. His fee was $7,500. He was promoted to leading man in just his second movie, the Western &quot;High Lonesome&quot; (1950), written and directed by Alan Le May, who also wrote Barrymore&#x27;s next film, &quot;Quebec&quot; (1951). He starred in &quot;The Big Night&quot; (1951), written and directed by Joseph Losey, and was in &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; (1952) with John Derek at Republic. In 1953, he was briefly jailed for failing to appear on three old traffic charges.

===Television===
Barrymore&#x27;s films were not particularly successful. He moved into television, guest-starring on shows like &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot; and &quot;The 20th Century-Fox Hour .&quot; He performed in TV movies, including &quot;The Reluctant Redeemer&quot; (1954), &quot;The Adventures of Lt. Contee&quot; (1955), and appeared in several episodes of &quot;Matinee Theatre.&quot; In 1957 he directed an episode of &quot;Matinee Theatre,&quot; &quot;One for All.&quot; &quot;Television gives me the chance to do what movies didn&#x27;t,&quot; he said. In 1955, Barrymore was sued by Lanny Budd Productions for not making a series of movies in Europe. Barrymore counter-sued. In 1967, he was cast in the role of Lazarus in the &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;The Alternative Factor&quot; but did not show up on the first day of shooting. He was suspended from acting for six months after &quot;Star Trek&quot; filed a grievance. The role was then recast with Robert Brown in the part. 

Barrymore returned to features with supporting parts in &quot;While the City Sleeps&quot; (1956), for director Fritz Lang, and &quot;The Shadow on the Window&quot; (1957). In 1957, he appeared in a production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at the Pasadena Playhouse with Margaret O&#x27;Brien. He guest starred in &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; (the original production of &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot;), &quot;Climax!&quot;, &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse&quot; and &quot;Wagon Train&quot;.

In 1958, he changed his middle name to Drew, although he had been credited in past works as Blyth. He had a supporting role in &quot;High School Confidential!&quot; (1958) at MGM, and the lead in &quot;Never Love a Stranger&quot; and MGM&#x27;s interracial drama, &quot;Night of the Quarter Moon&quot; (1959) with Julie London. In December 1958, he was sentenced to three weekends in prison after a drunken public fight with his wife in a parking lot. In January 1959, his ex-wife sued for nonpayment of alimony. In March 1959, he was arrested for suspected hit-and-run drunk driving. In October 1959, he quit the touring company of &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot; after a week and a half of rehearsals.

===Europe===
Barrymore traveled to Italy to star in &quot;The Cossacks&quot; (1960) with Edmund Purdom. He stayed in Italy for the next few years with lead or main cast roles including appearances in &quot;The Night They Killed Rasputin&quot; (1960, playing Felix Yusupov), &quot;The Pharaohs&#x27; Woman&quot; (1961), &quot;The Centurion&quot; (1961), &quot;The Trojan Horse&quot; (1961, playing Ulysses), &quot;Pontius Pilate&quot; (1961, playing both Judas and Jesus), &quot;Invasion 1700&quot; (1962) and &quot;Rome Against Rome&quot; (1964).

During his five years in Europe, Barrymore appeared in the UK film &quot;The Christine Keeler Story&quot; (1963, filmed in Denmark) as Stephen Ward.

===Return to Los Angeles===
Barrymore returned to Los Angeles. He announced he made 16 films abroad, but &quot;I&#x27;m not going to do anything bad any more. I feel I&#x27;m straightened out and down the block. Somewhere around the block I lost half my ego, so I don&#x27;t work for applause.&quot; He also said he had started to write scripts. He guest starred on episodes of various television series, including &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Rawhide&quot;, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;Run for Your Life&quot;, &quot;Jericho&quot;, and &quot;Dundee and the Culhane&quot;, and appeared in the 1967 television film &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot;.

Barrymore&#x27;s antisocial and erratic behavior continued to obstruct his professional progress. In the 1960s, he was occasionally incarcerated for drug use, public drunkenness, and spousal abuse. In 1964, he went to prison for possession of marijuana.

In 1966, Barrymore was signed to play a guest role as Lazarus in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The Alternative Factor&quot;. However, he failed to show up (replaced at the last minute by Robert Brown), resulting in a SAG suspension of six months.

===Later years===

After the SAG suspension was served to Barrymore in 1967, he sporadically worked on-screen, sometimes with a few years between appearances.

In 1967, he was imprisoned for possession of drugs following a car crash. In 1969, he was again arrested for possession of drugs after another car accident.

Barrymore eventually withdrew from acting, with his final two appearances being a 1974 episode of &quot;Kung Fu&quot; and an uncredited role in the 1976 film &quot;Baby Blue Marine&quot;. Barrymore suffered from the same addiction problems that had destroyed his father. Although he continued to appear occasionally onscreen, he became reclusive, disappearing into the wilderness to live a mystical existence that has also been described as derelict. He was estranged from his family, including his children, and his lifestyle continued to worsen as his physical and mental health deteriorated.

In 2003, his daughter Drew moved him near her home, despite their estrangement. She paid his medical bills until his death from cancer the following year at age 72. She spread his ashes at Joshua Tree National Park, John&#x27;s favorite place. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to television.

==Personal life==

All of Barrymore&#x27;s marriages ended in divorce. His first marriage was to actress Cara Williams in 1952; they had one child, John Blyth Barrymore (b. 1954), before they divorced in 1959. A year later, in 1960, Barrymore married Gabriella Palazzoli. Their daughter, Blyth Dolores Barrymore, was born that same year. Their marriage lasted 10 years before ending in divorce in 1970.

<text>VOWR (800 kHz) is a non-commercial, listener-supported radio station in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The station is operated by the Wesley United Church of Canada with studios and offices at 101 Patrick Street. 

VOWR is a Class B AM station. By day, it transmits 10,000 watts. To avoid interference at night, VOWR reduces power to 2,500 watts. It uses a non-directional antenna. The transmitter is off Mount Scio Road in the Pippy Park section of St. John&#x27;s.

==Programming== 
VOWR airs a mix of 30% Christian radio programming and 70% secular programming. Secular programming includes adult standards from the 1940s through the 1970s, along with classical, folk, classic country, oldies, marching band and beautiful music. There are also interviews and informational programs including &quot;Consumer Reports,&quot; a gardening show, the 50+ Radio Show and others on a wide range of subjects.

VOWR is staffed by volunteers, many of them former broadcasters in the public and private local broadcasting industry. 

==History==
VOWR first signed on the air on . Its original experimental call sign was 8WMC, which stood for the Wesley Methodist Church. Reverend Joseph G. Joyce (1889–1959) started the station to provide a companion to people unable to get to services, but it soon expanded to provide public service programming and entertainment.
==Callsign==
VOWR is one of just four broadcast radio stations in Canada whose callsigns do not begin with CB (for the CBC), CF, CH, CI, CJ, or CK. The others, VOCM, VOCM-FM and VOAR-FM, are also based in the St. John&#x27;s area. With exception of VOCM-FM, which launched in 1982, all of these stations were founded before Newfoundland joined the Canadian Confederation in 1949. The ITU prefix VO was originally assigned to Newfoundland and remains in use by radio amateurs.

<text>SunnyPsyOp (2003) is the second studio album by industrial band ohGr.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Ogre and Mark Walk.

Note: &quot;PawSee&quot; is a hidden track that begins 23 seconds into track 13.

This is an Enhanced CD, it includes a video for the song &quot;maJiK&quot;.

==Personnel==
*Ogre
*Mark Walk
*Scott Crane – Additional programming
*Loki der Quaeler – Additional keyboards
*Camille Rose Garcia - Cover artwork

==Notes==
*An endai is a small bench in a Japanese Garden.
*The video for &quot;maJiK&quot; features stop motion animation and the following phrase written in a book near the beginning of the video: &quot;Very Soon/Forever More/The Way to Be/Will Be Attached/Forever Matched/Through What U See&quot;. This is most likely a reference to commercialism&#x27;s grip on pop culture as the video also features parodies of several popular brand logos including GAP, Nike, General Electric and Starbucks.
