<text>The Adventurer (UK title: Michael The Finn; original title &quot;Mikael Karvajalka&quot;) is a novel by Finnish author Mika Waltari, published in 1948. It is a fictional tale of a young Finnish man, Mikael Karvajalka (&quot;Hairy-foot&quot;), set in 16th century Europe. Mikael is portrayed as an intellectual but rather naive person. Beginning life as an orphan bastard, he pursues a better social position with help of friendly people and by means of theological studies, but ends up drifting along through historical events across Europe rather than being able to steer his life himself.

==Plot summary==
The book begins in the city of Turku and follows Mikael along an adventure throughout Europe and the Mediterranean. The book depicts many actual historical events with a rich style, although Mikael&#x27;s involvement in the events is fictitious. The historical events and milieu featured in the book include:

*Denmark&#x27;s conquest of Sweden, the Stockholm Bloodbath and eventually the downfall of king Christian II of Denmark.
* Student life at the Sorbonne in Paris at this time.
*Protestant reformation and related political unrest in Germany (the Poor Barons&#x27; Rebellion and the peasants&#x27; war), Luther and Müntzer themselves appearing as side characters.
*Spanish monarch sending conquistadors to New World, Mikael almost made to join Pizarro&#x27;s expedition.
* A witch-hunt conducted by the Inquisition in a small German town, claiming the life of an innocent girl.
*Wars in 16th-century Europe and expansion of the Ottoman Empire.
*Plundering of Rome (Sack of Rome) during reign of Pope Clement VII

The story is continued in The Wanderer, where the protagonist explores the Ottoman Empire.

==Reception==
The &quot;Mikael&quot; duology won the 1950 State Literary Prize of Finland. &quot;The Adventurer&quot; inspired Jean Auel to start her career as a writer: &quot;It was this story that began to crystallize for me an understanding of the real power of fiction: its ability to make the reader feel. Whatever else a work of fiction may be – educational, intellectual, literary, narrative – if it doesn&#x27;t move the reader, if it doesn&#x27;t reach inside and grab, it&#x27;s a waste of the medium and ultimately it fails.&quot;

<text>Titus Hosmer (1736 – August 4, 1780) was an American Founding Father, lawyer, and jurist from Middletown, Connecticut. He was a delegate for Connecticut to the Continental Congress in 1778, when he signed the Articles of Confederation.

==Biography==
Titus was born in West Hartford, Connecticut, attended Yale and graduated in 1757. He read for the law, was admitted to the bar, and began a practice in Middletown, Connecticut. Hosmer was elected to the Connecticut State Assembly annually from 1773 to 1778 and served as their speaker in 1777. In May 1778, he became a member of the State Senate and remained in that office until he died. Later in 1778, the joint state legislature sent him as one of their delegates to the Second Continental Congress. He was subsequently elected by the Continental Congress on January 22, 1780, to serve as a federal judge on the Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture.

Titus died at Middletown on August 4, 1780, of undisclosed causes, and is buried in the Mortimer Cemetery there. Joel Barlow, who received Hosmer&#x27;s patronage, wrote a much-admired elegy on his death.

==Family==
Hosmer married Lydia Lord on November 29, 1761, in Middletown. One son, Stephen Hosmer, became a lawyer and was the chief justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court. The other son, Hezekiah Lord Hosmer, became a U.S. representative for New York. A grandson, also named Hezekiah Lord Hosmer, became the first chief justice of the Montana Territory and authored several books.

The Hosmer family is traced to Rotherfield in Sussex (and much earlier to Otterhampton, Somerset), where Alexander Hosmer was native before a marian martyr in nearby Lewes and the family consequently moved to Kent in the following generations. His colonial ancestor, Colonel Thomas Titus, was a Roundhead in the New Model Army, who left Hawkhurst in Kent for Boston upon the English Restoration. Thomas Titus later settled in Middletown.

Hosmer had a Whig relative who fought and was mortally wounded in the Battles of Lexington and Concord against Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland. There is a Hosmer Corner in Hampden County, Massachusetts named for the family although the Hosmer&#x27;s are more renowned as founders of Hartford Connecticut.

<text>Nevill Josiah Aylmer Coghill VC (25 January 1852 – 22 January 1879) was an Irish officer in the British Army and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Family and early life==
Born in Drumcondra, Dublin at Belvidere House, Coghill was the eldest son of Sir John Joscelyn Coghill (1826–1905), 4th Baronet, JP, DL, of Drumcondra, County Dublin (see Coghill baronets), and his wife, the Hon. Katherine Frances Plunket, daughter of John Plunket, 3rd Baron Plunket. He was a nephew of David Plunket, 1st Baron Rathmore and William Plunket, 4th Baron Plunket. The painter Sir Egerton Coghill, 5th Baronet was his younger brother and he named his son, Nevill Coghill in his honour. Coghill&#x27;s nephew became a literary scholar and a member of the Inklings with C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien.

Coghill was educated at Haileybury College from 1865 to 1869. In 1876 he set sail with the 24th Regiment of Foot to Cape.

==Battle of Isandlwana==
Coghill was twenty-six years old and a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot (2nd Warwickshires), British Army, during the Anglo-Zulu War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. He was an orderly officer to Colonel R. T. Glyn, who regarded him as his favourite officer and the son he never had.

On 22 January 1879, after the disaster of the Battle of Isandlwana, South Africa, Lieutenant Coghill joined Lieutenant Teignmouth Melvill who was trying to save the Queen&#x27;s Colour of the Regiment. They were pursued by Zulu warriors, and while crossing the swollen River Buffalo, Lieutenant Coghill (despite his injured knee) went to the rescue of his brother officer, who had lost his horse and was in great danger. Although Coghill&#x27;s horse was shot by a Zulu warrior, the valiant soldier swam on to rescue Melvill. After some time, the Colour was swept from their grasp and floated down the bank. After reaching the bank, the two men were eventually overtaken by the Zulu warriors and, following a short struggle, both were killed. Lieutenant Walter Higginson, who was persuaded to escape, heard and witnessed their final actions when they fought to the last. The Colour was retrieved from the river ten days later by a mounted party under Major Wilsone Black.

==Legacy and award of Victoria Cross==

Two weeks after the battle, Coghill and Melvill&#x27;s bodies were found by a search party and both buried at Fugitive&#x27;s Drift. Major-General Dillon informed Coghill&#x27;s father in a letter, that had it not been for the valour of his son, the Colour would have fallen to Zulu hands. Coghill&#x27;s father donated his son&#x27;s trophies including a Zulu shield to the Museum of Science and Art, now the National Museum of Ireland. Coghill and Melvill were amongst the first soldiers to receive the VC posthumously in 1907. Initially &quot;The London Gazette&quot; mentioned that had they survived they would have been awarded the VC. 

A few months after the Battle of Isandlwana, a French battle artist, Alphonse de Neuville painted Coghill and Melvill&#x27;s actions when they were pursued by Zulu warriors.

The attempted escape of Melvill and Nevill Coghill was depicted in the 1918 silent film &quot;Symbol of Sacrifice&quot;. 
Coghill was portrayed by Christopher Cazenove in the 1979 film &quot;Zulu Dawn&quot; as a polite and humorous officer. In the film, he is friends with Melvill; their heroic actions when they crossed the Buffalo River in a desperate attempt to return the Queen&#x27;s Colour back to Natal was depicted in the film.

Coghill&#x27;s great-great-great grand-niece, Jane Mann, in 2014, passed a painting (of her ancestor and Melvill pursued by Zulus) by contemporary military artist Jason Askew to the Victoria Cross Museum.

The Colour which Coghill and Melvill tried to save was recovered and is on display at Brecon Cathedral in remembrance of their valour as well as other soldiers killed during the battle. Coghill&#x27;s Victoria Cross is permanently displayed at the Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh in Brecon, Powys, Wales. At Haileybury College, a leadership programme for pupils in Removes is named in his honour.

He served in the ranks until he was commissioned in March 1901. He was 18 years old, and a lieutenant in the 2nd Scottish Horse during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place on 3 July 1901 at Vlakfontein, South Africa, for which he was awarded the VC:
Following the end of the war, he went to the United Kingdom and received the decoration in person from the Prince of Wales during a large coronation parade of colonial troops in London on 1 July 1902.

==Later life==
He was commissioned in the Royal Army Service Corps in 1906 from the 2nd Dragoon Guards. He later achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel. He saw action in three major wars (Second Boer War, World War I and World War II. He died of a cerebral haemorrhage, on board a ship near Egypt, on active service with the Royal Ulster Rifles in 1941. He is buried in Maala Cemetery, Aden (now Yemen).

==The medal==
His medal group (including the VC) was bequeathed to his former school, Campbell College, Belfast. His medals included the Queen&#x27;s South Africa Medal and 5 Bars (Cape Colony, Orange Free State, Transvaal, South Africa 1901 and South Africa 1902), 1914 Star with Ribbon Bar (5 August to 22 November 1914), British War Medal, Victory Medal, 1939–1945 Star, Africa Star, 1939–45 War Medal, King Edward VII Coronation Medal (with Military Ribbon), King George VI Coronation Medal.

<text>Stephen Titus Hosmer (January 10, 1763 – August 5, 1834) was an American lawyer and jurist who was the chief justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court from 1815 to 1833.

==Biography==
He was born in Middletown, Connecticut and lived there all his life. He was the son of Titus Hosmer, a member of the Continental Congress. He attended Yale University, graduating in 1782, and began his law practice in 1785. He was a member of the Connecticut Council for ten years.

Hosmer married Lucia Parsons, a daughter of General Samuel Holden Parsons; they had 11 children, of which only 3 were alive in 1834 when Hosmer died (and his daughter Sarah Mehetable died of cholera eight days after her father.)

<text>George Sewell (31 August 19242 April 2007) was an English actor, best known for his television roles, but also active on stage and in films.

==Early life and early career==
The son of a Hoxton printer and a florist, Sewell left school at the age of 14 and worked briefly in the printing trade before switching to building work, specifically the repair of bomb-damaged houses. He then trained as a Royal Air Force pilot, though too late to see action during the Second World War.

Following his demob, Sewell joined the Merchant Navy, he worked in the engine room serving as an oil trimmer for the Cunard Line on the and for their Atlantic crossings to New York. He worked as a street photographer, assisted a French roller-skating team, and was drummer and assistant road manager of a rumba band. He also travelled Europe as a motor coach courier for a holiday company.

==Acting career==
===Theatre===
Sewell had not considered acting until, aged 35, he met the actor Dudley Sutton by chance in a pub. Sutton recommended that Sewell audition for a production by Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Workshop of &quot;Fings Ain&#x27;t Wot They Used T&#x27;Be&quot;. Sewell did so, and made his acting debut as a policeman in the show both at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East and in the West End. He went on to star in two other Littlewood productions, &quot;Sparrers Can&#x27;t Sing&quot; (1962) and as Field Marshal Haig in &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; (1963), which later opened in Paris and on Broadway. The experience garnered from stage acting led to a long career in both film and television.

===Television===
For many years, Sewell was the gritty face of crime and law enforcement in a huge array of television series. Amongst his early roles, he was the tallyman in the television play &quot;Up The Junction&quot; (1965), a criminal who runs off with a teenage girl in &quot;Softly, Softly&quot; (1966), a hard-nosed building engineer in &quot;The Power Game&quot; (1965–66), a cowardly informer in &quot;Man in a Suitcase&quot; (1967), and a seedy private eye in &quot;Spindoe&quot; (1968). In 1969 he played an escaped convict called Jansen in the &quot;Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot; episode called &quot;Vendetta for a dead man&quot;. In 1970, he played Colonel Alec Freeman in Gerry Anderson&#x27;s live-action science-fiction drama &quot;UFO&quot;. Also in 1970 he played resistance leader Pierre Allard in three episodes of the ITV series Manhunt – 14 (One Way Home), 17 (The Ugly Side of War) and 22, (Intent to Steal) which were filmed in 1969 and aired in January 1970. He also appeared in a 1971 episode of &quot;Public Eye&quot; (Come into The Garden, Rose) as Harry Brierly.

In 1973, Euston Films re-invigorated the TV series &quot;Special Branch&quot;, formerly a videotaped series starring Derren Nesbitt. Sewell was brought in to play the lead character of DCI Alan Craven. The show ran for two seasons with Sewell, and served as a stylistic forerunner of crime drama &quot;The Sweeney&quot; (in which Sewell also appeared, this time as a villain). Sewell was to parody this role as Supt Frank Cottam in the Jasper Carrott/Robert Powell comedy, &quot;The Detectives&quot;.

He also played a Detective Baker who turned out to be a burglar in the &quot;Rising Damp&quot; episode &quot;The Prowler.&quot;

He also played Ray Walker in &quot;Heartbeat&quot; (series 9 episode 20).

===Later roles===
Later television appearances include &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; (1979), in which he played Mendel, and the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; (1988), in which he played builder&#x27;s merchant and fascist leader Ratcliffe. He also appeared frequently in films, notably &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; (1963), &quot;Poor Cow&quot; (1967) and &quot;Get Carter&quot; (1971).

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1973 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews while filming scenes for the TV series &quot;Special Branch&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
George Sewell died from cancer on 2 April 2007 at the age of 82. His brother, Danny Sewell, a former boxer, also became an actor.

<text>Charles Henry Cowley, VC (21 February 1872 – 25 April 1916) was a British merchant seaman and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Victoria Cross==
Cowley was 44 years old, and a lieutenant commander in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during the First World War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On the night of 24/25 April 1916 in Mesopotamia, an attempt was made to reprovision the force besieged at Kut-el-Amara. Lieutenant Commander Cowley, with a lieutenant (Humphrey Osbaldston Brooke Firman) (commanding SS &quot;Julnar&quot;), a sub-lieutenant and 12 ratings, started off with 210 tons of stores up the River Tigris. Unfortunately &quot;Julnar&quot; was attacked almost at once by Turkish machine-guns and artillery. At Magasis, steel hawsers stretched across the river halted the expedition, the enemy opened fire at point-blank range and &quot;Julnar&#x27;s&quot; bridge was smashed. &quot;Julnar&#x27;s&quot; commander was killed, also several of his crew; Lieutenant-Commander Cowley was taken prisoner with the other survivors and almost certainly executed by the Turks.

<text>Kapsas (, also Κάψια &quot;Kapsia&quot;) is a community in the municipal unit of Mantineia in Arcadia on the Peloponnese peninsula in southern Greece. It is situated in a valley east of the Mainalo mountains, at 700 m elevation. It is 9 km southeast of Levidi, 11 km west of Nestani and 12 km north of Tripoli. The Greek National Road 74 (Pyrgos - Tripoli) passes through the village.

==Historical population==

==History==
During World War II, and after the capitulation of Italy, Greece was occupied by Nazi Germany. Villagers of Kapsas helped an Italian soldier named Salvatore hide from the Germans and return to his native Italy. Statues of the school teacher Ioannis Orfanos, his wife and his brother have been erected near the village church in memory of their aid.

==Attractions==

The village church of Saint Nicholas possesses a precious icon, donated by the Moscow Patriarchate.

The Cave of Kapsia is situated 1 kilometer from the village Kapsia, at the southwest edge of the plain of ancient Mantineia. It is part of a system of active and inactive sinks (ponors) (Greek: katavothra &quot;Καταβόθρα&quot;). In front of the entrance are three ponors. Inside the cave human bone material has been found, according to some researchers from people who drowned during floods in the cave. The cave was used by man during the Neolithic, Hellenistic period and the fourth to sixth century AD.

<doc id="1219194" wikidata="Q550273" url="?curid=1219194" title="Division of Leichhardt">
<text>The Division of Leichhardt () is an Australian electoral division in Queensland. The current MP is Warren Entsch of the Liberal Party.

Leichhardt is located in Far North Queensland. It is a very mixed electorate, with its classification ranging from provincial in the south and rural and remote elsewhere. It includes the city of Cairns, as well as many towns such as Cooktown, Port Douglas and Weipa, and several Indigenous communities on the Cape York Peninsula and in the Torres Strait Islands.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

It is located in Far North Queensland and includes the Torres Strait Islands. It includes the local government areas of Cairns, Cook, Douglas, Torres and Wujal Wujal.

==Demographics==
As of the 2021 Australian census, Leichhardt had a total of 175,620 residents (including those who are not on the electoral roll). 50.4% of the population is female, and 49.6% is male. This reflects a trend across northern Australia where the male population tends to be above average. The median age is 39, compared to the state and national average of 38.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up 16.3% of the total population, significantly above the state average of 4.6% and national average of 3.2%.

44.8% of people in Leichhardt are unmarried, significantly higher than the national and state averages. 38.3% of residents have a registered marriage, while 16.9% are in a &quot;de facto&quot; marriage.

Leichhardt is somewhat multicultural. 31.8% of the population has English ancestry, 26.9% have Australian ancestry, 10.9% have Aboriginal ancestry, 9.7% have Irish ancestry and 8.7% have Scottish ancestry.

==History==

The division was first contested in 1949 after the expansion of seats in the Parliament of Australia. It is one of Australia&#x27;s largest electorates, covering an area stretching from Cairns to Cape York and the Torres Strait, including the Torres Strait Islands.

The division is named after Ludwig Leichhardt, an explorer and scientist. The area was first covered by the seat of Herbert from 1901 to 1934 and then by the seat of Kennedy until 1949.

Most of the electorate is almost uninhabited except for small Aboriginal communities, but the extreme southeast, consisting of the northern half of the Wet Tropics, with rich volcanic soils instead of the extraordinarily infertile lateritic sands and gravels of Cape York proper, is quite densely populated and includes urban Cairns. There are small, intensive sugar cane, banana and mango farms in this region, though they are prone to damage from droughts and cyclones.

A safe Labor seat from the late 1950s to the 1970s, it has been marginal for most of the time since then. While Cairns has historically tilted toward Labor, the more rural areas tilt toward the Liberals and Nationals.

It was a bellwether seat held by the party of government from the 1972 election until the 2010 election. When Warren Entsch, who held the seat from 1996 to 2007, won it back for the LNP in 2010, he became the seat&#x27;s first opposition member in four decades. It also marked the first time Labor had been in government without holding Leichhardt.

Ahead of the 2016 federal election, ABC psephologist Antony Green listed the seat in his election guide as one of eleven which he classed as bellwether electorates.

<text>Captain John James Crowe VC (28 December 1876 – 27 February 1965) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Crowe was 41 years old, and a second lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, The Worcestershire Regiment, British Army during the First World War at the Battle of Lys. On 14 April 1918 at Neuve Eglise, Belgium, when the enemy, having attacked a post in a village, broke past on the high ground and established a machine-gun and snipers, Second Lieutenant Crowe, with two NCOs and seven men twice engaged the enemy who on each occasion withdrew into the village, followed by the lieutenant firing on them. On the second occasion, taking only two men, he attacked two enemy machine-guns killing both gunners and several more of the enemy. The remainder withdrew, allowing him to capture the two guns. His actions during this incident resulted in Crowe being awarded the Victoria Cross.

He later achieved the rank of captain.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Worcestershire Regiment Museum in the Worcester City Art Gallery &amp; Museum, Worcester.

<text>Nelson Victor Carter VC (6 April 1887 – 30 June 1916) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.


Carter was born on 6 April 1887 to Richard Carter, of Hailsham; husband of Kathleen Carter, of 33 Greys Road, Old Town, Eastbourne. His date of birth is often stated as the ninth, but his birth certificate states the sixth.

He twice enlisted in the Royal Artillery, in 1902 and 1906, both times being later discharged as medically unfit. In September 1914, after the outbreak of the First World War, he re-enlisted in the British Army, going to France with the Royal Sussex Regiment in March 1916.

He was 29 years old, and a company sergeant major in the 12th Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment, when he died during the First World War. He was awarded the VC for his actions on 30 June 1916 at Boar&#x27;s Head, Richebourg l&#x27;Avoue, France:
After initial burial in a multiple grave, in the 1920s he was re-interred in the Royal Irish Rifles Churchyard, Laventie, France in Plot VI. Row C. Grave 17. 

Carter&#x27;s VC was presented to his widow, Catherine, by King George V at Buckingham Palace on 2 May 1917 and is now held by the Royal Sussex Regiment Museum, Eastbourne Redoubt, East Sussex. There is a blue plaque on his home at 33 Greys Road in Eastbourne.

<text>Sly Fox was an American dance pop duo, consisting of P-Funk vocalist Gary &quot;Mudbone&quot; Cooper and Michael Camacho. The duo came to prominence in the mid-1980s with their UK/US top 10 hit single &quot;Let&#x27;s Go All the Way&quot;. They released one studio album of the same name which charted within the US Top 40, and a couple of subsequent singles before breaking up.

==History==
The duo was assembled by record producer Ted Currier, and presented as wholesome, clean-living teen idols. Cooper, a funk session musician, had previously been a vocalist with Parliament-Funkadelic and Bootsy&#x27;s Rubber Band. Camacho was a protégé of David Bowie. The group&#x27;s touring band included Cooper&#x27;s former Rubber Band bandmates Frank &quot;Kash&quot; Waddy (drums), Joel &quot;Razor Sharp&quot; Johnson (keyboards), and Flip Cornett (guitar/bass), along with &quot;Bad Boy Troy&quot; Tipton (guitar), Greg Seay, and current Zapp keyboardist, Gregory Jackson.

Their sole studio album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go All the Way&quot;, was released on Capitol Records in December 1985. The title track became a top 10 hit in both the US and UK in 1986. The follow-up singles &quot;Como Tu Te Llama&quot;, &quot;Stay True&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Play with Fire&quot; did not perform as well and sold poorly. The group disbanded in 1988. 

In 1989, Sly Fox reformed briefly in Cincinnati, Ohio. With a demo budget from Bill Laswell, the duo recorded four songs, including Cooper&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s No Place Like Home&quot;. The recording sessions included musicians James Ibold (guitar), Chris Sherman (bass), Casey McKeown (keyboards) and Johnny Miracle (drums). Previously unsettled artistic differences arose between the duo, and they abruptly separated again. Cooper returned to tour with George Clinton, while Camacho headed to Los Angeles to focus on a film career.

Since the dissolution of the group, Cooper has remained involved in the music industry. His most recent studio album, 2006&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Mud&quot;, was a collaboration with Dave Stewart that combined blues and rap. Camacho has concentrated on acting, directing, and singing. He released the solo studio album &quot;Just for You&quot; in 2007. He is also a proprietor of a well-known jazz lounge and bar in New York City and has started a funk band named the Funky Foxes.

<doc id="1219206" wikidata="Q1060845" url="?curid=1219206" title="Delacorte Theater">
<text>The Delacorte Theater is a 1,800-seat open-air theater in Central Park, in the New York City borough of Manhattan. It is home to the Public Theater&#x27;s free Shakespeare in the Park productions. As of September 2023, it has been closed for renovations that are expected to complete in spring 2025.

Over five million people have attended more than 150 free productions of Shakespeare and other classical works and musicals at the Delacorte Theater since its opening in 1962.

==History==
Joseph Papp ran a Shakespeare festival starting in 1954. Papp&#x27;s group had been touring New York&#x27;s boroughs on temporary staging, including presenting at Central Park. Papp&#x27;s group was well-regarded, and he started seeking funds in 1958 for a permanent outdoor amphitheater in Central Park, with the aid of Helen Hayes. Parks Commissioner Robert Moses was opposed to the project. However, Moses was replaced by Newbold Morris in 1960, who was much more positive toward the creation of a theater. The city government decided to go forward with the project, and the Board of Estimate approved $250,000 in funds for construction, with Park Department architects designing the original theater. The theater had been planned to open in 1961. However, the funds ran dry with the theater unfinished. Morris talked with his friend George T. Delacorte Jr., president of the Dell Publishing company. Delacorte, a fan of Shakespeare, agreed to fund the remaining $150,000 to finish construction of the theater, which was named in honor of him and his wife Valerie in gratitude.

Delays from changes in design, a construction strike, as well as procuring the required funds from Delacorte pushed the opening back to 1962. The first production at the theater was in June 1962 with &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, starring George C. Scott and James Earl Jones. The theater originally had 2,300 seats; at some point, the number of seats was reduced to make the experience less overcrowded for the audience.

In 2012 the Public celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Delacorte with a gala and a one-night only reading of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; starring numerous past performers. Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline read the lead roles.

=== 2023–2025 renovation ===
In 2018, the Public announced plans for the first major renovation of the Delacorte. They cited several goals for the renovation: better accessibility for disabled patrons and performers, improved backstage flow and operations, a new facade, replacement of the stage floor due to exposure and weather damage to the original deck, and better lighting. Bjarke Ingels was originally hired to redesign the theater, but Ennead Architects was handling the architectural work by 2021. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission approved the plans in January 2022.

The Delacorte closed for renovation in September 2023 after the final show of the summer 2023 season, a musical version of &quot;The Tempest&quot;, closed. The renovation is expected to take around 18 months, with the theater planned to reopen in time for the summer 2025 season. As part of the renovation, the theater is being rebuilt with wood recycled from water towers atop apartment buildings in New York City.

<text>Henry Curtis VC (21 December 1822 – 23 November 1896) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Curtis was 32 years old and a Boatswain&#x27;s Mate in the Royal Navy (Naval Brigade) during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 18 June 1855, in the Crimea, immediately after the assault on Sebastopol, a soldier of the 57th Regiment, who had been wounded in both legs, was observed sitting up and calling for help. At once the second-in-command of the scaling party (Henry James Raby), another seaman (John Taylor) and Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Curtis left the shelter of their battery works and ran forward a distance of 70 yards, across open ground, through heavy gunfire and succeeded in carrying the wounded man to safety.

==Medal location==
The VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<doc id="1219210" wikidata="Q4636066" url="?curid=1219210" title="38th parallel structures">
<text>The 38th parallel structures, also known as the 38th parallel lineament, are a series of seven circular depressions or deformations stretching across southern Illinois and Missouri and into eastern Kansas, in the United States, at a latitude of roughly 38 degrees north. Estimated at 300 million years old, three are believed to be impact events from meteorites, but other structures are possibly remnants of volcanos.

==History==
Rampino and Volk (1996) postulated that these structures could be the remains of a serial meteorite strike during the late Mississippian or early Pennsylvanian periods (320 ± 10 Ma). Difficulty in determining the age of many of the structures and doubts about the exogenic origins of several of them leave some geologists skeptical of this hypothesis. As of 2016, only two of the structures, Crooked Creek (320 ± 80 Ma) and Decaturville (&lt; 300 Ma), both in Missouri, are listed as confirmed impact craters in the Earth Impact Database.

There is evidence that at least some of the features, such as Hicks Dome in Illinois, are volcanic in origin. These features are associated with faults and fractured rock, and are accompanied by igneous rocks and mineral deposits. Hicks Dome is a structural dome which has its central Devonian core displaced upward some in relation to the surrounding strata. The dome has small associated igneous dikes around its flanks.

Interest in the possibility of serial impacts on Earth was piqued by observations of comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 impacting on Jupiter in 1994. It has been estimated, however, that the likelihood of such an event occurring on Earth is vanishingly small because the Earth&#x27;s weaker gravitational field is much less able than Jupiter&#x27;s to pull a speeding object close enough to be torn apart by tidal forces. However, evidence of serial impacts on the Moon, whose gravitational field is even weaker, can be seen in several chains of craters on the lunar surface.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Harry Daniels VC MC (13 December 1884 − 13 December 1953) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Harry Daniels was the thirteenth child of a baker in Wymondham, Norfolk. He joined the British Army at a young age and served abroad in India.

He was 30 years old, and a Company Sergeant-Major in the 2nd Battalion of The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 12 March 1915 at Neuve Chapelle, France, his unit was ordered into an advance on the German trenches across no-man&#x27;s land which was covered by machine guns and strewn with barbed wire.

<text>Dracula 2000 (also known as Wes Craven Presents: Dracula 2000 and internationally as Dracula 2001) is a 2000 American vampire film co-written and directed by Patrick Lussier and produced by Joel Soisson. Starring Gerard Butler in the title role along with Christopher Plummer, Jonny Lee Miller, Justine Waddell, Omar Epps, Colleen Fitzpatrick, Jeri Ryan and Jennifer Esposito, the plot follows Dracula, who arrives in New Orleans, Louisiana in the 21st century and seeks out Mary Heller, the daughter of Abraham Van Helsing.

&quot;Dracula 2000&quot;, under its promotional title &quot;Wes Craven Presents: Dracula 2000&quot;, builds upon Bram Stoker&#x27;s original 1897 novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, with Count Dracula resurrected in contemporary America. The film was a critical and commercial failure, though two direct-to-video sequels, both written and directed by Lussier, were produced.

==Plot==
In 2000 London, Matthew Van Helsing, a descendant of 19th-century physician Abraham Van Helsing, owns an antique shop built over the site of Carfax Abbey. One night, Van Helsing&#x27;s secretary, Solina, her boyfriend Marcus, and their companions Trick, Nightshade, Dax, and Eddie break into the shop&#x27;s underground vault, believing it must contain valuables. Instead, they discover a sealed silver coffin. While attempting to open the coffin, Eddie and Dax are impaled by spikes, spraying the coffin with blood and alerting Van Helsing to their presence. Assuming the coffin must contain his valuables, the group escapes with it aboard a plane to New Orleans, and Van Helsing arranges a flight to pursue them, unwittingly accompanied by his apprentice, Simon Sheppard.

Aboard their plane, Nightshade unlocks the coffin, revealing the withered body of Dracula. Having been awakened by the blood on his coffin, Dracula attacks and vampirizes Solina and her group. Rejuvenated, Dracula has a vision of a young woman, Mary Heller, who simultaneously sees him. After the plane crashes in a Louisiana swamp, the seemingly deceased passengers are taken to a makeshift morgue, while Dracula vampirizes Valerie Sharpe, a presenter reporting on the crash. He then travels to New Orleans to find Mary. Estranged from her family, Mary has recently been experiencing vivid dreams about Dracula, unaware of who he is.

Van Helsing and Simon arrive in New Orleans and destroy most of Dracula&#x27;s newborn vampires. Afterward, Van Helsing confesses to Simon that he is the Abraham Van Helsing, who defeated Dracula in 1897, and has extended his own life by regularly injecting Dracula&#x27;s blood. In the century since, Van Helsing has failed to find a method of permanently killing Dracula. All that is known, is that Dracula is enraged by God and Christian iconography, and has a vulnerability to silver. Van Helsing also reveals that Mary is his daughter. She was conceived after Van Helsing began his injections and thus shares a connection to Dracula. Van Helsing&#x27;s wife left with Mary after learning of what he had done.

Dracula is led to Mary&#x27;s home by her friend Lucy, whom he seduces and vampirizes. There, he later confronts and kills Van Helsing. On her return, Mary finds her father&#x27;s bloodied corpse and is ambushed by Dracula and his brides: Solina, Valerie, and Lucy. Simon arrives just in time to save her from Dracula&#x27;s beast form. The pair briefly escape into a church cemetery, but Dracula soon catches and abducts Mary. Dracula explains that he has spent centuries searching for someone like him, but born rather than vampirized like his thralls.

On a rooftop, Dracula transforms Mary and reveals that he is Judas Iscariot, the Apostle who betrayed Jesus to the Romans for a bribe of thirty pieces of silver. After Jesus was crucified, Judas hanged himself in atonement at sunset, but was revived and turned into the first vampire. Dracula reveals his intent to spite Jesus by spreading his vampiric immortality to humanity and corrupting them with forbidden pleasures. Mary suggests that Dracula cannot die because he has not sought God&#x27;s forgiveness, but Dracula refuses to ever submit to Jesus or God again. After Simon kills Valerie, he is subdued by Solina and Lucy and brought to Dracula, who offers his blood to Mary. She feigns the bite before she and Simon kill the remaining brides, and stab Dracula to avenge her father.

An enraged Dracula attacks Mary, who wraps some retaining cable from a large crucifix around his neck and drags him over the roofedge. As dawn breaks, and Dracula looks up at the image of Jesus on the crucifix, the sunlight immolates him. He releases Mary from her vampirism before perishing. Sometime later, Mary has taken her father&#x27;s role guarding Dracula&#x27;s remains, to ensure that he remains dead.

==Cast==
== Production ==
While finalizing post-production on &quot;Scream 3&quot;, Bob Weinstein approached editor Patrick Lussier on a modernized take on Dracula entitled &quot;Dracula 2000&quot;. When Lussier asked Weinstein what the film was about, Weinstein responded &quot;I don&#x27;t know.&quot; Joel Soisson, having written under Lussier for &quot;The Prophecy 3: The Ascent&quot;, was brought on board to flesh out the film. The filmmakers quickly drafted a screenplay by January 2000, which envisioned a smaller scale story than Weinstein had hoped for. Soisson&#x27;s initial pitch, which included a vampire hunting priest, would ultimately be recycled for the sequel, &quot;Dracula II: Ascension&quot;. Inspired by the prior Hammer Horror entries, particularly &quot;Dracula A.D. 1972&quot;, Lussier attempted to employ similar methods for his film. Lussier and Soisson also sought to differentiate their Dracula from other adaptations. The director took note of the character&#x27;s scorn for Christian iconography, ultimately linking him to Judas Iscariot.

Wes Craven served as an executive producer on the project. Craven&#x27;s name was used heavily in marketing, as done on previous films such as &quot;Wishmaster&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Down&quot;. Ehren Kruger performed a script polish, while Scott Derrickson and his writing partner Paul Harris Boardman were enlisted for a rewrite just two weeks before production. According to Derrickson, Weinstein thought the script was &quot;terrible&quot; but was moving forward with production regardless; when Derrickson asked why he was making the movie, Weinstein replied &quot;Because it&#x27;s called &quot;Dracula 2000&quot;&quot;.

During pre-production in Toronto, Lussier had already blocked several scenes using assistants. Christopher Plummer, Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick, Omar Epps, Justine Waddell, Jonny Lee Miller, and Jeri Ryan arrived on set, but no actor would be cast in the title role. Gerard Butler would be cast as Dracula only two days before filming commenced.

Filming began on June 26, 2000, and took place in New Orleans and Toronto and wrapped on September 6. A rough cut of the film was assembled in only six days. Additional photography occurred on October 23 and spanned eight days. Nathan Fillion was added during the reshoots, filming his brief scenes on Halloween night. In November, the Writers Guild of America ruled that Soisson would receive sole screenplay credit and share story credit with Lussier. The final cut of the film was expected to be delivered on December 12, 2000, a mere ten days before its theatrical release. Speaking to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Craven compared &quot;Dracula 2000&quot;&#x27;s rushed production to his time working on &quot;Scream 2&quot;, saying &quot;What&#x27;s the benefit of making movies so fast? There&#x27;s no benefit whatsoever. It&#x27;s terribly difficult, and completely unnecessary.&quot;

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
On its opening weekend, &quot;Dracula 2000&quot; released alongside &quot;Cast Away&quot;, &quot;The Family Man&quot;, &quot;The Gift&quot;, &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot;, &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;, and &quot;Thirteen Days&quot;. The studio hoped the film would counterprogram against the &quot;season&#x27;s romantic comedies and dramas&quot;.

The film opened at #7 in its first week at the box office with $8,636,567. In its second week, the film had a 56.5% drop-off, but hung onto the #8 spot. The film grossed $33,022,767 domestically and $14,030,858 overseas for a worldwide total of $47,053,625, failing to make back its $54 million budget. On its initial video release, it grossed an additional $32 million in the US and Canada and continues to make money worldwide. &quot;Dracula 2000&quot; was the sixth-highest-grossing film for Miramax/Dimension Films in 2000, exceeding the box office takes of such expensive Dimension Films releases like &quot;Reindeer Games&quot; and &quot;Impostor&quot;, as well as Miramax&#x27;s December opener for that year, &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot;.

=== Critical reception ===
The film received generally negative reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports a rating of 17% based on 69 reviews, with an average score of 3.59/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;This retelling tries to offer a different spin on the origin of Dracula. Unfortunately, there&#x27;s nothing here audiences haven&#x27;t seen before&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a 26 out of 100 rating, based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Berge Garabedian of JoBlo offered a positive review, calling it &quot;A fun vampire movie&quot;, &quot;a novel adaptation of an old time legend&quot;, and &quot;[good] for pretty much anyone looking for some enjoyable bloody fun&quot;. BeyondHollywood.com wrote: &quot;&quot;Dracula 2000&quot; is not the worst vampire movie I&#x27;ve seen, but it&#x27;s definitely not the best either. There are some very good moments, most of them featuring the frail Van Helsing as he attempts to battle the fast and deadly vampires. Also, I appreciated the background given to Dracula&#x27;s aversion to silver, crosses, and God, as well as Dracula&#x27;s &#x27;true&#x27; origins. Not bad work, but it could have been much better&quot;.

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;C−&quot; score, while James Berardinelli of ReelViews panned the film, writing: &quot;Of all the indignities to have been visited upon Dracula during the past century (including being the &quot;inspiration&quot; for a cereal and a &quot;Sesame Street&quot; character, and being ), none is more unsettling than what has happened to the world&#x27;s most famous vampire in &quot;Dracula 2000&quot;&quot;. Jane Crowther of the BBC gave the film 1/5 stars, saying it was &quot;Destined to enter the so-bad-it&#x27;s-good hall of fame&quot; and &quot;a prime example of that old remake adage; if you can&#x27;t do it better or different – don&#x27;t do it at all.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

The film&#x27;s rock and metal soundtrack includes Powerman 5000&#x27;s song &quot;Ultra Mega&quot;, Linkin Park&#x27;s song &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, Pantera&#x27;s song &quot;Avoid the Light&quot;, System of a Down&#x27;s cover of Berlin&#x27;s &quot;The Metro&quot;, Slayer&#x27;s song &quot;Bloodline&quot; and Disturbed&#x27;s song &quot;A Welcome Burden&quot;. The original score composed by Marco Beltrami was released in 2017 by Varèse Sarabande as part of the label&#x27;s &quot;Little Box Of Horrors&quot; limited edition 12-disc set. The score was released separately by the label in July 2020.

==Sequels==
&quot;Dracula 2000&quot; was followed by two direct-to-video sequels, &quot;Ascension&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Legacy&quot; in 2005. Series director Lussier and Joel Soisson, who co-wrote all three films, created a plot for a fourth film and discussed releasing it theatrically, but the film was not produced.

<text>Robert James Thomas Digby-Jones (27 September 1876 – 6 January 1900) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==

He was born at Chester Street in Edinburgh the son of Charles Digby Jones (1844–1911) and his wife, Aimee Susanna Christie. He was educated at Alnmouth and then Sedbergh School. In 1894 he was sent to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich and trained as an officer in the Royal Engineers. He is recorded as a keen and popular sportsman, both in golf and rugby.

When he was 23 years old, and a lieutenant in the Corps of Royal Engineers, British Army during the Boer War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 6 January 1900 during the attack on Wagon Hill (Ladysmith), South Africa, Lieutenant Digby-Jones and a trooper (Herman Albrecht) of the Imperial Light Horse led the force which re-occupied the top of the hill at a critical moment, but both were killed in the ensuing mêlée. For their actions they cited jointly:
Digby-Jones is buried in Ladysmith Cemetery.

He is also memorialised on his parents grave in Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh.

==Memorials and the medal==

<doc id="1219218" wikidata="Q1929914" url="?curid=1219218" title="Water birth">
<text>Water birth is childbirth that occurs in water, usually a birthing pool. It may include the use of water for relaxation and pain relief during the first stage of labour, birth into water in the second stage of labour, and the delivery of the placenta in the third stage of labour. 

==Benefits==

Proponents believe childbirth in water results in a more relaxed, less painful experience. A 2018 Cochrane Review of water immersion in the first stages of labour found evidence of fewer epidurals and few adverse effects but insufficient information regarding giving birth in water. 
A moderate to weak level of evidence indicates that water immersion during the first stage of childbirth reduces the pain of labour. A 2018 Cochrane Review found that immersion at this stage reduces the use of epidural analgesia; however, there is no clear evidence on the benefits of immersion for the second stage of labour, namely delivery (sometimes called full water birth). There is no evidence of increased adverse effects for immersion during the first or second stages of labour.

Water birth may offer perineal support for the mother, and some theorize that this may decrease the risk of tearing and reduce the use of episiotomy. Evidence for this is not strong. 

A 2014 review reported that water immersion during the first stage of labour can reduce the length of that stage, labour pain, and the use of epidural or spinal anaesthesia. It is also associated with a lower rate of cesarean delivery and stress urinary incontinence symptoms 42 days after delivery. The review reported that immersion during labour did not appear to increase the rate of infections for the mother or the baby, and Apgar scores for the newborn infant were similar to those of conventional births.

==Criticisms==

Waterbirth may lead to a higher rate of cord avulsion, or the snapping of the umbilical cord. Statements on water birth by peak gynaecological and midwifery bodies in the UK, Australia and New Zealand all stipulate that exclusion criteria apply for high risk births.

There is limited evidence for some of the purported benefits of waterbirth.

==Birth pool==

A birth pool is a specially designed vessel for waterbirth. They are generally larger than bathtubs to enable buoyancy and freedom of movement during labour. A birth pool can either be permanently installed or portable.

=== Characteristics ===
Before birth pools became readily available there were many stories of women labouring and birthing in re-purposed tub-like products including animal watering troughs.

The original circular birth pool used by Michel Odent, the originator of the concept of birthing pools, at Pithiviers hospital in France in the early 1980s was in diameter and deep, large enough to comfortably accommodate two people. Modern birth pools are somewhat smaller, with a diameter between and at least , preferably , of water.

== Around the world ==

=== United Kingdom ===
Approximately 10% of births in the UK take place in water, and approximately 20% of births include the use of water for pain relief. A cohort study carried out in the UK of 73,229 women concluded that there was no association with adverse fetal or maternal outcomes.

Health policy in England stipulates women should be given the opportunity to labour in water through the publication of Intrapartum care guidelines issued in 2007 by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Midwives have jointly supported labour and birthing in water, and encourage hospitals to ensure birth pools are available to all women.

Birthing pools are available in many public hospitals in the UK.

=== Australia and New Zealand ===
The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists supports the use of water immersion during labour within safety and clinical guidelines, noting that there is evidence of benefits to the mother and no evidence of adverse effects to the mother or baby. The New Zealand College of Midwives supports water immersion during labour when there are no factors that would prevent it, noting that there is no evidence for adverse fetal or maternal outcomes, but that further evidence is required for the delivery of the placenta. The Australian College of Midwives also supports immersion in water during labour and/or birth.

Birthing pools are available at many public and private hospitals in Australia and New Zealand.

=== United States ===
Water birth is not commonly available in hospitals in the United States, and American clinical opinion is generally skeptical of the practice. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not recommend birthing in water, although its 2016 Committee Opinion on the matter states that immersion in water during the first stage of labour may be offered to women with uncomplicated pregnancies. 

In a 2005 commentary, the Committee on Fetus and Newborn of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released an analysis of the scientific literature regarding underwater births. The Committee noted several positive studies for underwater birth but went on to criticize them for lacking proper scientific controls, a significant number of infant deaths and diseases, and the general lack of information to support the use of water births.

<text>Colonel James Lennox Dawson VC (25 December 1891 – 15 February 1967) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Dawson enlisted into the 5th Cameronians in November 1914, but transferred to the Royal Engineers in March 1915.

==VC action==
He was 23 years old, and a corporal in the 187th Company, Corps of Royal Engineers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place at the Battle of Loos, for which he was awarded the VC.

On 13 October 1915 at Hohenzollern Redoubt, France, during a gas attack, when the trenches were full of men, Corporal Dawson exposed himself fearlessly to the enemy&#x27;s fire to give directions to his sappers and to clear the infantry out of sections of the trench which were full of gas. Finding three leaking cylinders, he rolled them well away from the trench, again under heavy fire, and then fired rifle bullets into them to let the gas escape. His gallantry undoubtedly saved many men from being gassed.

==Later career==
He was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in December 1916 and demobilised as a Major in 1919. After graduating from Glasgow University he was commissioned in the Army Education Corps in 1920, but transferred to the Indian Army Ordnance Corps in 1931.

He later achieved the rank of colonel. By co-incidence his second cousin (their fathers were first cousins) James Dalgleish Pollock was also awarded the Victoria Cross in the same battle at the Hohenzollern Redoubt. He too saved his colleagues from certain death by climbing out of the trench and bombing German infiltrators out of the British lines. Both boys were born in the small Scottish town of Tillicoultry, though James Dawson&#x27;s family moved to the county town of Alloa when he was eight. Both were considered local heroes in 1915 and were feted in Alloa and Tillicoultry in separate civic receptions, allied to recruitment drives.

His VC is held by the University of Glasgow where he earned his BSc and is displayed at the Hunterian Museum.

<text>John Danaher VC also known as John Danagher (25 June 1860 – 9 January 1919) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==

Born in Limerick, Ireland, Danaher moved to South Africa shortly after the completion of his schooling. Upon the outbreak of the First Boer War, Danaher joined the Nourse&#x27;s Horse (Transvaal), South African Forces.

==Military career==

He was 20 years old, and a Trooper, on an excursion from Pretoria with the Nourse&#x27;s Horse (Transvaal) when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 16 January 1881 at Elandsfontein, near Pretoria, South Africa, Trooper Danaher, with a lance-corporal of the Connaught Rangers, (James Murray) advanced for 500 yards under heavy fire from a party of about 60 of the enemy, and brought out of action a private who had been severely wounded.

Danaher resigned from the Nourse&#x27;s Horse in March 1881, and subsequently joined a British Army unit, the Connaught Rangers. He returned to Limerick with the Rangers in 1882, and later achieved the rank of sergeant before retiring from military service in 1908. Danaher moved to Portsmouth, becoming a publican. He was the landlord of the Dog &amp; Duck Public House at 115 Fratton Road, Portsmouth from 1913 until his death on 9 January 1919. His wife, Mrs B. Danagher, succeeded him as Landlady and his son subsequently took over as Landlord in 1936/7.

His Victoria Cross is held by the National Army Museum &quot;(Chelsea, England)&quot;.

<text>William Matthew Currey, VC (19 September 1895 – 30 April 1948) was an Australian politician and an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He received the award for his actions during the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin in September 1918, while serving with Australian Imperial Force on the Western Front during the First World War.

After the war, Currey worked as a labourer and railway worker before entering the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Labor Party representative for the seat of Kogarah, which he held between 1941 and his death in 1948.

==Early life==
Born in Wallsend, New South Wales, on 19 September 1895, Currey was the son of a miner, William Robert Currey and Mary Ellen Lang. After attending Dudley and Plattsburg public schools, he was employed as a wireworker in Leichhardt. In October 1916, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, volunteering for service overseas during the First World War, having attempted unsuccessfully several times before, being rejected as under-aged. After being accepted, Currey was eventually sent to the Western Front in Europe, where he initially served the 4th Light Trench Mortar Battery, before being posted in July 1917 to the 53rd Battalion – an infantry battalion that had been recruited primarily from New South Wales – as a reinforcement. In late 1917, Currey fought with the battalion during the Battle of Polygon Wood.

==Victoria Cross==
In September 1918, during the final Allied offensive of the war – the Hundred Days Offensive – Currey was one of eight Australians awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions during the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin.

On 1 September 1918 in the attack on Péronne, France, Currey, as a 22-year-old private in the 53rd Battalion, rushed forward under heavy machine-gun fire and captured single-handed a 77-mm field gun which had been holding up the advance, killing all the crew. Later, when the advance was checked by an enemy strong-point he crept round the flank and engaged the post with a Lewis gun, then rushed it, causing many casualties. Subsequently, he volunteered to carry orders for withdrawal to an isolated company, bringing back valuable information, doing so under heavy fire and despite being gassed. The citation published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 14 December 1918 concluded that his behaviour was a &quot;striking example of coolness, determination and utter disregard of danger... and his gallant work contributed largely to the success of the operation.&quot;

The Australian official war historian, Charles Bean, described the final act of Currey&#x27;s heroism thusly: &quot;At 3 am when efforts to reach (a Lt Waite in an advanced position) having failed Private Currey volunteered to make his third attempt and going out far into the disputed front he stood up and called with all his lung power. &quot;Waitsy! Get in.&quot; The Germans turned on him every weapon they had; he was gassed and his respirator was shot through. But Waite had heard him and returned.&quot;

==Later life==
Currey was discharged from the AIF in 1919, and took up employment as a storeman, working for the Railways Department in New South Wales, remaining in the role until 1941. On 10 April 1920, he married Emmie Davies at St Saviour&#x27;s Anglican Church, in Punchbowl, and the couple later had two daughters together. Currey briefly returned to the military twice: in 1930–32 he served in the Militia in the 45th Battalion, and then during the Second World War he served in the Australian Instructional Corps as a sergeant in a training role between 1940 and 1941 before being discharged.

In 1941, he ceased working for the Railways, and successfully stood for election as the Labor Party member for Kogarah in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. He was the only Victoria Cross recipient to sit in the New South Wales parliament and was re-elected twice: in 1944 and 1947. In late April 1948, while in parliament, he collapsed and three days later, on 30 April 1948, he died at Bexley, New South Wales, from coronary-vascular disease. His funeral was held at St Stephen&#x27;s Presbyterian church in Macquarie Street, Sydney.

==Remembrances==
Currey&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, Australia.
Following a public appeal in 1956 a plaque was erected in memory of Currey in the Speakers Square within the New South Wales Parliament complex. During renovations in the 1970s the plaque was put into storage for safekeeping and was only rediscovered and restored to its place in 2008.

In 1976, the &quot;Jeffries and Currey Memorial Library&quot; was opened by the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Roden Cutler, at Dudley Public School to honour two of the school&#x27;s pupils who were decorated with the Victoria Cross during the First World War: Clarence Jeffries and William Currey. The pair are also commemorated by the &quot;Capt. Clarence Smith Jeffries (V.C.) and Pte. William Matthew Currey (V.C.) Memorial Wall&quot; located in the grounds of Sandgate General Cemetery, Newcastle, which was unveiled in an official ceremony on 16 April 2000.

<text>James Dundas VC (10 September 1842 – 23 December 1879) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==

He was born the son of George Dundas, Lord Manor a judge in the Edinburgh High Court, and his wife Elizabeth Mackenzie on 10 September 1842 and baptised on 12 September. He was the older brother of William John Dundas FRSE (1849–1921). His early education was at Edinburgh Academy.

From 1855 to 1857 he attended Glenalmond School. He then attended Addiscombe Military Seminary for specific officer training for the British Army. In 1860 he was given a commission as a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers.

In 1862 he went with his regiment to India under General Henry Tombs VC, and rose to the level of Executive Engineer as part of a series of public works in the Bengal area.

==Details of Award==
Dundas was 22 years old, and a lieutenant in the Bengal Engineers, Indian Army during the Bhutan War when the following deed took place on 30 April 1865 at Dewan-Giri, Bhutan for which he was awarded the VC in a joint citation with Major William Spottiswoode Trevor:
The medal was presented to Dundas in Calcutta on 23 March 1868 by Major General C F Fordyce on behalf of Queen Victoria.

The medal forms part of the Ashworth Collection at the Imperial War Museum in London.

==Later life==

In March 1877, he had inherited the family estate of Ochtertyre, near Stirling in Scotland, from his uncle Sir David Dundas MP. He returned to Britain briefly that year to inspect the property but returned to India after a few months.

In 1878 he is recorded as saving a man&#x27;s life in a fire at the Simla bazaar.

Remaining in the army, Dundas died during the Second Anglo-Afghan War. General Roberts had selected him to lead a group advancing on Kabul. He was killed on 23 December 1879 during the Siege of the Sherpur Cantonment. He was killed by a British mine going off prematurely due to a makeshift fuse. He is buried nearby at the Seah Sang Cemetery in Afghanistan.

James Dundas died unmarried, and on his death the estate passed to his twin brother Colin Mackenzie Dundas.

==Memorials==

A brass memorial plaque exists in St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Edinburgh (Episcopal).

A plaque also exists at Glenalmond School.

Listed on the &quot;For Valour&quot; memorial at the Royal Engineers Museum in Kent.

A memorial window and brass plaque in Rochester Cathedral.

In 2002 the Royal Engineers erected a new bridge in Afghanistan close to where he met his fate and named it the James Dundas Bridge.

==Further information==
&quot;The Dundas Bridge&quot;, between Kabul and Bagram, Afghanistan, was named after him, by the British Army, Royal Engineers, following reconstruction work during 2002.

<doc id="1219234" wikidata="Q1337358" url="?curid=1219234" title="Kicking Horse River">
<text>The Kicking Horse River is in the Canadian Rockies of southeastern British Columbia, Canada. The river was named in 1858, when James Hector, a member of the Palliser Expedition, reported being kicked by his packhorse while exploring the river. Hector named the river and the associated pass as a result of the incident. The Kicking Horse Pass, which connects through the Rockies to the valley of the Bow River, was the route through the mountains subsequently taken by the Canadian Pacific Railway when it was constructed during the 1880s. The railway&#x27;s Big Hill and associated Spiral Tunnels are in the Kicking Horse valley and were necessitated by the steep rate of descent of the river and its valley.

Kicking Horse Pedestrian Bridge in Golden is the longest authentic covered timber-frame bridge in Canada. Planned as a community project by the Timber Framers Guild, local volunteers were joined by carpenters and timber framers from Canada, the United States and Europe. The bridge structure is long, with a Burr arch structure. The bridge was completed in September 2001.

The Trans-Canada Highway traverses the river at several points from Yoho National Park to Golden, British Columbia. The river is spanned by the new Park Bridge. Kicking Horse Mountain Resort, named for the river and pass, is located in the Dogtooth Range of the Purcell Mountains, on the west side of the town of Golden.

==Course==

The Kicking Horse River begins at the outlet of small Wapta Lake and flows southwest. It receives the Yoho River upstream from Field. The river continues to flow southwest until after it drops over Wapta Falls, when it takes a near hairpin turn and flows northwest into the Columbia River in Golden.

==Waterfalls==
The river has three waterfalls along its stretch. The first is the Kicking Horse Cascade, a long talus cascade which occurs just below the first highway crossing of the river below Wapta Lake. The second is the Natural Bridge Falls near Field. The final and largest is Wapta Falls, one of the largest waterfalls in Canada in both volume and width. They are over wide.

==Natural history==
===History===

The River’s unusual name stems from an incident near Wapta Falls in August 1858, Sir James Hector writes:

&quot;A little way above this fall one of our pack horses, to escape the fallen timber, plunged into the river, luckily where it formed an eddy, but the banks were so steep that we had great difficulty in getting him out. In attempting to recatch my own horse, which had strayed off while we were engaged with the one in the water, he kicked me in the chest, but I had luckily got close to him before he struck out, so that I did not get the full force of the blow. However, it knocked me down and rendered me senseless for some time. This was unfortunate, as we had seen no tracks of game in the neighbourhood, and were now without food; but I was so hurt that we could not proceed further that day at least.&quot; - James Hector chronicles, 1858

===James Hector===
As surgeon and geologist to the Palliser Expedition from 1857 to 1860, Hector explored the country from the Red River Colony (Winnipeg) to Vancouver Island. He made many important observations regarding the geology and ethnology of the Canadian West and the Rocky Mountains, discovering the Kicking Horse Pass and giving the Kicking Horse River its name.

===2019 Derailment===
On 4 February 2019, a Canadian Pacific Railway freight train with 112 cars and 3 locomotives derailed near the Big Hill of Kicking Horse Pass. The train landed in the river, and three crew members were killed.

==Recreation==
Several whitewater rafting companies, as well as kayakers and canoeists, use the river. The first company to raft the Kicking Horse river is named Kootenay River Runners. They continue to raft trips on the Kicking Horse daily, as well as two other nearby rivers. There are three main sections of the Kicking Horse River used for such recreation. The upper canyon (accessed via Beaverfoot Road off Highway 1 West) is a class 3-4 whitewater run suitable for canoes, kayaks and rafts. Prior to a landslide in the upper canyon, boats had to portage a one kilometre stretch of rapids in order to avoid getting caught on rocks. After the landslide, the river was narrowed, allowing boats to pass freely through the rapids. Nowadays, this stretch is named Portage/Shotgun, hence the previous need to portage the area. The middle canyon (accessed via Kicking Horse rest area) is a class 4-5, depending on water levels. This run is suitable only for experienced kayakers and rafters. Commercial rafting companies avoid this section, due to the risk involved. The lower canyon is another class 3-4 whitewater run that is run by commercial rafting companies at suitable water levels. Prior to the start of the 2016 rafting season, Canadian Pacific railway installed a gate, prohibiting road access to the lower-canyon. Because of this, many rafting companies have been forced to stop rafting this portion of the river, resulting in revenue and job loss. The Kicking Horse is home to many varieties of freshwater fish, making fishing a viable activity.

<text>Captain Robert Gee (7 May 1876 – 2 August 1960) was an English-Jewish recipient of the Victoria Cross and a Conservative Member of Parliament.

==Biography==

Born in Leicester, Gee was orphaned when aged 9. He was sent to the workhouse in Leicester, then to the Countesthorpe Cottage Homes for orphaned children. He enlisted in the Army in 1893. Quartermaster-Serjeant Robert Gee was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 21 May 1915.

He was awarded the Military Cross in for his actions on the first day on the Somme (1 July 1916); &quot;For conspicuous gallantry in action. He encouraged his men during the attack by fearlessly exposing himself and cheering them on. When wounded he refused to retire, and urged his men on till, after being blown into the air by a shell, he was carried in half unconscious.&quot;

He was 41 years old, and a temporary captain in the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Fusiliers, British Army during the First World War when he was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, for his actions on 30 November 1917 at Masnières and Les Rues Vertes, France, during a German counter attack in the Battle of Cambrai (1917):

An attack by the enemy captured brigade headquarters and ammunition dump. Captain Gee, finding himself a prisoner, managed to escape and organised a party of the brigade staff with which he attacked the enemy, closely followed by two companies of infantry. He cleared the locality and established a defensive flank, then finding an enemy machine-gun still in action, with a revolver in each hand he went forward and captured the gun, killing eight of the crew. He was wounded, but would not have his wound dressed until the defence was organised.

He later transferred to the Royal West Kent Regiment.

==Post war==

After the war, Gee went into politics. He first stood for Parliament as a National Democratic Party candidate in the 1918 General Election at Consett, where he finished second.

He then stood for Parliament as a Conservative in the 1921 Woolwich East by-election against Ramsay MacDonald. A great deal of attention was given in the campaign to the contrast between Gee as a Victoria Cross holder and Macdonald as a pacifist who opposed the war. Gee won the seat which he held until the next general election the following year, when he lost to the Labour Party candidate. He stood unsuccessfully in the 1923 Newcastle-upon-Tyne East by-election and in Bishop Auckland in the 1923 United Kingdom general election.

He was elected MP for Bosworth at the 1924 general election. He became disillusioned with parliamentary life however, and he was reported to have been absent from his political duties for over a year at the time of his resignation in 1927, having emigrated to the backwoods of Western Australia with no intention of returning. The subsequent 1927 Bosworth by-election was a Liberal gain.

He died in Perth, Western Australia, aged 84. He was cremated at the Karrakatta Crematorium. His VC is displayed at the Fusilier Museum in the Tower of London, England.

<doc id="1219238" wikidata="Q2973718" url="?curid=1219238" title="Division of Lilley">
<text>The Division of Lilley is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. The current MP is Anika Wells of the Australian Labor Party (ALP).

==History==
The division was first proclaimed in 1913. The division is named after Sir Charles Lilley, a former premier of Queensland and a former chief justice in the Supreme Court of Queensland.

The Division of Lilley includes sparsely populated areas of Brisbane Airport, tidal wetlands around Boondall, and industrial areas around Pinkenba.

It was held by the Liberal Party and its antecedents for all but four terms from 1913 to 1980. However, since 1980, it has tended to be a marginal Labor seat. It is currently represented by Labor MP Anika Wells. Notable former members include former treasurer, former deputy leader of the Labor Party and deputy prime minister, Wayne Swan, as well as George Mackay, who served as Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives during the first term of the Lyons Government, and Kevin Cairns, a minister in the McMahon government.

==Boundaries==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

Lilley stretches from Nundah in the south to the bayside suburbs of Sandgate and Brighton in the north, and as far west as Everton Park.

Lilley currently covers the north-eastern part of the City of Brisbane local government area, and includes Banyo, Boondall, Brighton, Chermside, Deagon, Geebung, Kedron, Northgate, Nudgee, Nundah, Pinkenba, Sandgate, Shorncliffe, Taigum, Virginia, Wavell Heights, Zillmere, and Aspley.

<text>Major Alfred Cecil Herring (26 October 1888 – 10 August 1966) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Alfred Cecil Herring was educated at Tottenham County School where he was captain of the school at cricket and football.

==Details==
He was 29 years old, and a temporary second lieutenant in the Royal Army Service Corps, British Army, attached to 6th (S) Battalion, The Northamptonshire Regiment during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 23/24 March 1918 at Montagne Bridge, France, the enemy had gained a position on the south bank of the canal and Second Lieutenant Herring&#x27;s post was surrounded, but he immediately counter-attacked and recaptured the position, together with 20 prisoners and six machine-guns. During the night the post was continually attacked, but all attacks were beaten off, largely because Lieutenant Herring was frequently visiting his men and cheering them up. It was owing to his bravery and magnificent handling of his troops that the enemy advance was held up for 11 hours at a very critical period.

==Further information==
He was born in Tottenham, north London.
He later achieved the rank of major. He was a Chartered Accountant by profession 

In 2006, a new pub on Green Lanes, Palmers Green, in north London, run by the Wetherspoons chain, was named after him.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the New Royal Logistic Corps Museum, RHQ The RLC, Building 204, Worthy Down Barracks, Winchester. SO21 2RG. (date 2021) signed KMB

<text>Odd Einar Dørum (born 12 October 1943) is a Norwegian former politician and former member of parliament, representing the Liberal Party. He was leader of the party on two occasions (1982–1986 and 1992–1996) and served as minister in Kjell Magne Bondevik&#x27;s both cabinets from 1997 to 2000 and again from 2001 to 2005.

==Career==
Dørum grew up in Oslo, Bergen, and Trondheim, where he studied history at university. He was a member of Venstre&#x27;s youth organization (Unge Venstre), and from 1970 to 1972 was its leader. He was a city councillor in Trondheim while working as a social worker.

Dørum was a member of parliament from 1977 to 1981 and was re-elected in 1997. He was Minister of Transport and Communications from 17 October 1997 to 15 March 1999, then Minister of Justice until 17 March 2000. He was again Minister of Justice in the second government of Kjell Magne Bondevik from 2001 to 2005. He served four terms as an elected member of the Norwegian Parliament (Stortinget) (1977–1981, 1997–2001, 2001–2005, and 2005–2009). He did not seek re-election in the 2009 election.

He was the leader of the Liberal Party from 1982 to 1986 and again from 1992 to 1996.

Despite becoming an experienced Minister of Justice, Dørum himself had a run-in with the law in his youth. He participated in a non-violent civil disobedience protest in Mardøla, Norway in 1970. Protesting against the government turning several waterfalls into powerplants, he was carried away by police together with other prominent protestors like philosopher Arne Næss. This marked the first time civil disobedience was used to protect the environment in Norway.

Dørum is known as a very grounded person, and unlike most politicians his age he does not take himself very seriously. For decades he has been a huge fan of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; books and made headlines when he showed up for the premiere of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; wearing a hobbits robe, much to the amusement of its star Viggo Mortensen. He later donned the same outfit again in an outdoor Lord of the Rings concert in Frognerparken in Oslo in 2005.

Dørum is a Christian of part German-Jewish descent on his mother&#x27;s side. He lives in Oslo, married to Randi Gerd Øverland and has two children.

<text>Fusilier Dennis Donnini VC (17 November 1925 – 18 January 1945) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Dennis Donnini was born to Italian-born Alfred Donnini and his English wife Catherine (née Brown), on 17 November 1925 in Easington Colliery. His father owned an ice cream parlour in Easington and attended Corby Grammar School in Sunderland, now known as St. Aidans School. Before he enlisted, Donnini had two brothers enter the military. Alfred Donnini was captured at Dunkirk and spent the rest of the war in a POW camp, while Lewis Donnini died of wounds on 1 May 1944.

==Details==
Donnini was 19 years old, and a fusilier in the 4th/5th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers, British Army during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 18 January 1945 during Operation Blackcock, Fusilier Donnini&#x27;s platoon was ordered to attack the small village of Stein in Selfkant Germany, close to the Dutch border. On leaving their trench they immediately came under heavy fire from a house and Fusilier Donnini was hit in the head. After recovering consciousness he charged 30 yards down the open road and hurled a grenade through the nearest window, whereupon the enemy fled pursued by Fusilier Donnini and the survivors of his platoon. He was wounded a second time, but continued firing his Bren gun until he was killed after the grenade he was carrying was hit by a bullet and exploded. His gallantry had enabled his comrades to overcome twice their own number of the enemy.

Donnini at 19 was the youngest soldier in the Second World War to be awarded the VC.

He is buried at the Commonwealth Cemetery in Sittard, The Netherlands.

Donnini is commemorated in the song &quot;Donnini Doolally&quot; by Easington singer Jez Lowe on his album &quot;Doolally&quot;.

<text>Strange Fruit Records was an independent record label in the United Kingdom.

The label, established by Clive Selwood and John Peel in 1986, was the primary distributor of BBC recordings, including Peel Sessions.

The name came from the song written by Abel Meeropol and famously performed by Billie Holiday, itself a reference to racially motivated lynchings. The label had the aim of generating sufficient revenue from recordings of &#x27;big name&#x27; artists to allow the release of recordings by lesser-known artists. The label&#x27;s first release was New Order&#x27;s 1982 Peel Session, in July 1987, and was followed by sessions from some of the biggest names from the punk rock and post punk eras. Recordings from as far back as the 1960s were also released by the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band. As well as individual sessions, the label also released albums compiling several sessions by the same artist. Strange Fruit was sufficiently successful that it spawned subsidiary labels including Nighttracks (sessions from radio One&#x27;s Evening Show), Raw Fruit Records (concert recordings from the Reading Festival), and Band of Joy (BBC session recordings from the 1960s and 1970s). In 1994, Peel&#x27;s BBC colleague Andy Kershaw started another subsidiary label, Strange Roots, which released session recordings by world music and roots artists from his radio show.

Strange Fruit closed in 2004. It was part of the Zomba Group of companies and was shut down when the label merged with BMG. The last release the label put together was an album of New Order&#x27;s complete Peel Sessions, fitting as the first release that came out was an EP of New Order&#x27;s first Peel session. Six months later John Peel died.

Clive Selwood died in June 2020.

<text>Henry Cecil Dudgeon D&#x27;Arcy VC (11 August 1850 – 1881) was a New Zealand-born recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He won the VC on 3 July 1879 at Ulundi in South Africa during the Anglo-Zulu War when he was 28 years old, and a captain in the Frontier Light Horse.

==Early life==

D&#x27;Arcy was born in Wanganui, New Zealand, where his father Major Oliver Barker D&#x27;Arcy (sometimes D&#x27;Arcey) of the 65th Regiment was in the British garrison. In 1860, Oliver D&#x27;Arcy transferred to the Cape Mounted Riflemen and settled with his family at King William&#x27;s Town in the Cape Colony.

==Anglo-Zulu War==

During the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, Cecil D&#x27;Arcy was an officer in the Frontier Light Horse, a mounted unit of 200 volunteers raised at King William&#x27;s Town in 1877 by Lieutenant Frederick Carrington.

At the Battle of Hlobane on 28 March 1879, his unit acted as the rearguard and 20% of the 156 members were killed. D&#x27;Arcy was recommended for the VC by Evelyn Wood for going back to save the lives of wounded men in the descent of Devil&#x27;s Pass; the award was not approved on the grounds that he was a volunteer and not a member of the imperial forces. Five other awards were approved, including to Colonel Redvers Buller; he had rescued D&#x27;Arcy who was retiring on foot and carrying him on his horse, while hotly pursued by Zulus.

At the Battle of Kambula on the following day, the Frontier Light Horse were part of the pursuit of the retreating Zulu forces. Captain D&#x27;Arcy wrote in a letter published in &quot;The Natal Mercury&quot; in April that they &quot;followed them for eight miles, butchering the brutes all over the place. I told the men, &#x27;No quarter, boys, and remember yesterday&#x27;. And they did knock them about, killing them all over the place&quot;. The FLH troopers extracted their revenge for their comrades killed the day before at Hlobane.

He was awarded the VC for his actions on 3 July 1879 when a mounted reconnaissance was ambushed near Ulundi. In a dispatch dated 5 July in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;, Redvers Buller wrote that D&#x27;Arcy &quot;reckons neither personal inconvenience nor danger in the execution of any order, determined and bold; he has frequently shown great personal gallantry, and has always given a fine example to his men.&quot; The citation of the VC award reads;

He was presented with his medal in December 1879 by Sir Garnet Wolseley in Pretoria.

==Further information==

After the Frontier Light Horse was disbanded, D&#x27;Arcy joined the Cape Mounted Riflemen as a captain. He served in the 1880 Basuto Gun War, but resigned his commission in April 1881.

In ill health, he stayed with Rev. Charles Taberer in Keiskammahoek to recuperate. During the night of 6–7 August 1881 he left the house; his body was not found for several months. He was interred on 3 January 1882 in the cemetery of King William&#x27;s Town beside his parents.

He is also considered South African, though he probably considered himself British or Anglo-Irish.

==Speculation==

In 2008, David Randall in &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper in London reported claims that D&#x27;Arcy faked his death.

<doc id="1219249" wikidata="Q707873" url="?curid=1219249" title="Timanthes">
<text>Timanthes of Cythnus () was an ancient Greek painter of the fourth century BC. The most celebrated of his works was a picture representing the sacrifice of Iphigenia, in which he finely depicted the emotions of those who took part in the sacrifice; however, despairing of rendering the grief of Agamemnon, he represented him as veiling his face. Zeuxis, Timanthes and Parrhasius were painters who belonged to the Ionian School of painting. The Ionian School flourished during the 4th-century BCE.

A fresco discovered at Pompeii, and now in the Museum at Naples, has been regarded as a copy or echo of this painting (Wolfgang Helbig, &quot;Wandgemälde Campaniens&quot;, No. 1304).

==Influence==
Timanthes&#x27; &quot;Sacrifice of Iphigenia&quot; was well-known in Rome through Pliny the Elder&#x27;s description in Book 35 of his Natural History. Even before his description, Cicero and Quintillian used it to describe the effects of the four men who witnessed or partook of the sacrifice. Agamemnon is veiled since his sadness was so great that it could not be portrayed in paint. Iphigenia&#x27;s suffering seems to be left out. 

The painting had a strong impact in the Renaissance. Artists such as Giorgio Vasari and Peter Paul Rubens attempted to replicate the lost painting. Writers from Leon Battista Alberti to Jacopo Sannazaro, and from Michel de Montaigne to Gianbattista Marino, include the sacrifice in their works devoting all their attention to the sadness expressed by the four men and Agamemnon in particular. In Spain Juan Boscán redirects the suffering to Iphigenia

<doc id="1219251" wikidata="Q2360820" url="?curid=1219251" title="Lightmap">
<text>A lightmap is a data structure used in lightmapping, a form of surface caching in which the brightness of surfaces in a virtual scene is pre-calculated and stored in texture maps for later use. Lightmaps are most commonly applied to static objects in applications that use real-time 3D computer graphics, such as video games, in order to provide lighting effects such as global illumination at a relatively low computational cost.

==History==

John Carmack&#x27;s &quot;Quake&quot; was the first computer game to use lightmaps to augment rendering. Before lightmaps were invented, realtime applications relied purely on Gouraud shading to interpolate vertex lighting for surfaces. This only allowed low frequency lighting information, and could create clipping artifacts close to the camera without perspective-correct interpolation. Discontinuity meshing was sometimes used especially with radiosity solutions to adaptively improve the resolution of vertex lighting information, however the additional cost in primitive setup for realtime rasterization was generally prohibitive. Quake&#x27;s software rasterizer used surface caching to apply lighting calculations in texture space once when polygons initially appear within the viewing frustum (effectively creating temporary &#x27;lit&#x27; versions of the currently visible textures as the viewer negotiated the scene).

As consumer 3d graphics hardware capable of multitexturing, light-mapping became more popular, and engines began to combine light-maps in real time as a secondary multiply-blend texture layer.

==Limitations==

Lightmaps are composed of lumels (lumination elements), analogous to texels in texture mapping. Smaller lumels yield a higher resolution lightmap, providing finer lighting detail at the price of reduced performance and increased memory usage. For example, a lightmap scale of 4 lumels per world unit would give a lower quality than a scale of 16 lumels per world unit. Thus, in using the technique, level designers and 3d artists often have to make a compromise between performance and quality; if high resolution lightmaps are used too frequently then the application may consume excessive system resources, negatively affecting performance. Lightmap resolution and scaling may also be limited by the amount of disk storage space, bandwidth/download time, or texture memory available to the application. Some implementations attempt to pack multiple lightmaps together in a process known as &quot;atlasing&quot; to help circumvent these limitations.

Lightmap resolution and scale are two different things. The resolution is the area, in pixels, available for storing one or more surface&#x27;s lightmaps. The number of individual surfaces that can fit on a lightmap is determined by the scale. Lower scale values mean higher quality and more space taken on a lightmap. Higher scale values mean lower quality and less space taken. A surface can have a lightmap that has the same area, so a 1:1 ratio, or smaller, so the lightmap is stretched to fit.

Lightmaps in games are usually colored texture maps. They are usually flat, without information about the light&#x27;s direction, whilst some game engines use multiple lightmaps to provide approximate directional information to combine with normal-maps. Lightmaps may also store separate precalculated components of lighting information for semi-dynamic lighting with shaders, such as ambient-occlusion &amp; sunlight shadowing.

==Creation==
When creating lightmaps, any lighting model may be used, because the lighting is entirely precomputed and real-time performance is not always a necessity. A variety of techniques including ambient occlusion, direct lighting with sampled shadow edges, and full radiosity bounce light solutions are typically used. Modern 3D packages include specific plugins for applying light-map UV-coordinates, atlas-ing multiple surfaces into single texture sheets, and rendering the maps themselves. Alternatively game engine pipelines may include custom lightmap creation tools. An additional consideration is the use of compressed DXT textures which are subject to blocking artifacts – individual surfaces must not collide on 4x4 texel chunks for best results.

In all cases, soft shadows for static geometry are possible if simple occlusion tests (such as basic ray-tracing) are used to determine which lumels are visible to the light. However, the actual softness of the shadows is determined by how the engine interpolates the lumel data across a surface, and can result in a pixelated look if the lumels are too large. See texture filtering.

Lightmaps can also be calculated in real-time for good quality colored lighting effects that are not prone to the defects of Gouraud shading, although shadow creation must still be done using another method such as stencil shadow volumes or shadow mapping, as real-time ray-tracing is still too slow to perform on modern hardware in most 3D engines.

Photon mapping can be used to calculate global illumination for light maps.

==Alternatives==

===Vertex lighting===
In vertex lighting, lighting information is computed per vertex and stored in vertex color attributes. The two techniques may be combined, e.g. vertex color values stored for high detail meshes, whilst light maps are only used for coarser geometry.

===Discontinuity mapping===
In discontinuity mapping, the scene may be further subdivided and clipped along major changes in light and dark to better define shadows.

<text>Job Henry Charles Drain VC (15 October 1895 – 26 July 1975) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Drain was born on 15 October 1895 in Barking, Essex. He was 18 years old, and a Driver in the 37th Battery, Royal Field Artillery, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

===Victoria Cross===
On 26 August 1914 at Le Cateau, France, when a captain (Douglas Reynolds) of the same battery was trying to recapture two guns, Driver Drain and another driver (Frederick Luke) volunteered to help and gave great assistance in the eventual saving of one of the guns. At the time they were under heavy artillery and infantry fire from the enemy who were only away.

He later achieved the rank of Sergeant. He died on 26 July 1975, and is buried at Rippleside Cemetery, Barking.

===Memorials===

Drain was a resident of Barking, Essex. In autumn 2009, a statue of him was erected on Broadway, Barking. A blue heritage plaque was also erected at his last residence in Greatfields Road.

His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>John Spencer Dunville, (7 May 1896 – 26 June 1917) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and education==
Dunville was born on 7 May 1896 in Marylebone, London, to Colonel John Dunville Dunville and Violet Anne Blanch Dunville (née Lambart). His father was from Holywood, County Down and was chairman of Dunville &amp; Co whisky distillers. Dunville was educated at Ludgrove School and Eton College, and was a member of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps from May 1912 to July 1914. He passed matriculation for Trinity College, Cambridge, but with the outbreak of the First World War joined the army instead.

==Victoria Cross==
He was aged 21 and a second lieutenant in the 1st (Royal) Dragoons, British Army during the First World War when he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 25 June 1917 near Épehy, France.

Second Lieutenant John Spencer Dunville died of wounds on 26 June 1917, the day after performing the deed, and is interred at the Villiers-Faucon Communal Cemetery, Somme, France, (Plot No. A21).

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Household Cavalry Museum in Horse Guards in London.

<text>Streethouse is a semi rural village in West Yorkshire, England that is situated to the east of Wakefield, the west of Featherstone and the south-west of Castleford. It is also situated on a Roman road.

==History==
A former mining village, Streethouse is currently a commuter village serving Wakefield, Normanton, Featherstone, Pontefract and Leeds.

==Access==
Streethouse railway station provides regular services to Pontefract and Wakefield with interconnecting services to Leeds and Sheffield. Junction 31 of the M62 is close by and the Glasshoughton Link Road has improved access to Wakefield and Castleford and relieved congestion on the M62.

==Environs==
Like many industrial areas, Streethouse suffered a period of decline. In recent years however, the village has enjoyed a considerable amount of investment from regeneration funds and private investment from housing companies. Some of the older, run down buildings are now earmarked for demolition but because of the developer going into administration no further work on the site has taken place. The village has a school, although children needing secondary education have to travel to nearby Featherstone, Crofton or Normanton. The area has a church, post office, one shop, Streethouse Cricket club which formed in 1962, and a cafe. The former WMC is now demolished and new houses have been built on the site. There is also a park with a new children&#x27;s playground and a separate playing field. Sharlston Country Park borders the village following the completion of surface mining on land from the former Sharlston Colliery.

The village also boasts 5-time Pontefract League Division One Champions, 1-time National Village Semi-finalists and 1-time Dyson-Skidmore trophy winners, the Streethouse Cricket Club. The local professional Rugby League club is Featherstone Rovers.

<text>George Cartwright, (9 December 1894 – 2 February 1978) was a British-born Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was one of 64 Australians to receive the award for their actions during the First World War, performing the deeds that led to his award in September 1918 during the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin while serving with Australian Imperial Force on the Western Front. After the war, Cartwright returned to Australia and worked as a mechanic. He continued to serve in the military part-time, returning to full-time service during the Second World War, undertaking a training role in Australia. He was demobilised in 1946, and returned to civilian life. He died at the age of 83.

==Early life==
Cartwright was born in South Kensington, London, on 9 December 1894 to William Edward Cartwright, a coach trimmer, and his wife Elizabeth (née Stracey). He attended the local school, before emigrating to Australia in 1912 at the age of eighteen without his family. Settling in New South Wales, Cartwright gained employment at a sheep station in the Elsmore district as a labourer.

==First World War==
On 9 December 1915—his 21st birthday—Cartwright enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force for service during the First World War. Allotted to the newly raised 33rd Battalion—an infantry battalion raised in New South Wales—as a private, he embarked aboard HMAT &quot;Marathon&quot; at Sydney on 4 May 1916. Disembarking at Devonport, England, two months later, the members of the 33rd Battalion spent the following four months training at Larkhill Camp on Salisbury Plain.

After the 3rd Division, to which the 33rd Battalion was assigned, deployed to the Western Front in November 1916, Cartwright served with them through the Battle of Messines where he was wounded in June 1917. Later, in April 1918, he was wounded again when the 33rd Battalion&#x27;s position was attacked with gas while holding a position around Villers-Bretonneux. He was briefly hospitalised but returned to duty in June. In August, the Allies launched the Hundred Days Offensive around Amiens, which resulted in a series of advances as the Allies sought to break through the Hindenburg Line.

On 31 August 1918, at Road Wood, south-west of Bouchavesnes, near Peronne, France, when two companies became held up by machine gun fire, Cartwright attacked the gun alone under intense fire. He shot three of the crew, and, having bombed the post, captured the gun and nine enemy soldiers. For his actions he was recommended for the Victoria Cross. On 30 September 1918 he was wounded and evacuated to England. Cartwright was conferred with his VC by King George V, and at the end of the war Cartwright was repatriated to Australia, arriving in March 1919 and as the AIF was demobilised, he was discharged on 16 May 1919. For his war service he received the following medals: the Victoria Cross, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.

==Inter-war years and Second World War==
During the inter-war years, Cartwright moved to Sydney, where he found work as a motor mechanic. He married Elsie Broker at St Stephen&#x27;s Anglican Church, at Chatswood, New South Wales, on 25 June 1921. They later had two children, but the marriage ended in divorce. He remained in the military, serving part-time in the Militia, posted to the 4th/3rd Battalion, eventually being commissioned as an officer on 25 February 1932. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Cartwright was mobilised for war service on 5 March 1940, serving in a training role in Australia. He was promoted to captain in 1942, and served throughout the war. In addition to the decorations he received for his previous service, Cartwright also later received the Efficiency Decoration and the War Medal 1939–1945.

==Later life==
After the war, Cartwright was demobilised in May 1946. He later worked as an assistant-cashier and in 1948 remarried, exchanging nuptials with Evelyn Mary Short on 4 September 1948 in the Congregational Church, at Pitt Street in Sydney. During his later life, he attended several functions held in London for Victoria Cross and George Cross recipients. He died at the age of 84 on 2 February 1978, at Gordon, New South Wales; his wife and one of his children survived him. He was cremated and his Victoria Cross and other decorations were later donated by his widow to the Imperial War Museum in London, where they are currently held.

Cartwright is commemorated in the New South Wales Garden of Remembrance, at Rookwood, and also at the Kurrajong Memorial in Inverell, New South Wales, which was unveiled in 2005 in honour of the 114 men from the town who enlisted in January 1916.

<text>The Division of Longman is an Australian electoral division in Queensland. The current MP is Terry Young of the Liberal Party.

==History==

The division was first proclaimed in 1994. The division is named after Irene Longman, the first female member of the Parliament of Queensland and the third woman elected to a parliament in Australia.

Wyatt Roy, who represented the electorate between 2010 and 2016, was Australia&#x27;s youngest ever parliamentarian elected at the time.

==Boundaries==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

Longman covers much of the City of Moreton Bay, including the former Caboolture Shire and some of the former Pine Rivers.

Its boundaries include Beachmere, Bribie Island, Burpengary, Dakabin, Donnybrook, Kallangur, Ningi, Toorbul, Caboolture, Caboolture South, Morayfield, Wamuran, Woodford and Narangba.

<text>John Timbs (; 17 August 1801 – 6 March 1875) was an English author and antiquary. Some of his work was published under the pseudonym of Horace Welby.

==Biography==
Timbs was born in 1801 in Clerkenwell, London. He was educated at a private school at Hemel Hempstead. In his sixteenth year he was apprenticed to a druggist and printer at Dorking. He had early shown literary capacity, and when nineteen began to write for the &quot;Monthly Magazine&quot;. A year later he became secretary to Sir Richard Phillips, its proprietor, and permanently adopted literature as a profession.

He was successively editor of the &quot;Mirror of Literature&quot;, the &quot;Harlequin&quot;, &quot;The Literary World&quot;, and sub-editor of the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;. He was later to become the third editor of the ILN.
He was also founder and first editor of &quot;Year-Book of Science and Art&quot;. His published works amounted to more than one hundred and fifty volumes. In 1834 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.

Timbs died on 6 March 1875 and is buried in the churchyard of St Peter and St Paul, Edenbridge, Kent.

<text>George Dare Dowell, VC (15 February 1831 – 3 August 1910) was a Royal Marines officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==
Dowell was 24 years old, and a lieutenant in the Royal Marine Artillery, Royal Marines during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC).

On 13 July 1855 at the Fort of Viborg in the Gulf of Finland, when an explosion occurred in one of the cutters of HMS &quot;Arrogant&quot;, Lieutenant Dowell, who was on board HMS &quot;Ruby&quot;, took three volunteers and went, under very heavy fire to the assistance of the cutter. He took up three of the crew, and having rescued the rest and also the Captain of the Mast (George Ingouville), he then towed the stricken boat out of enemy gun range.

Dowell later achieved the rank of brevet lieutenant colonel.

==Death and legacy==
Dowell died on 3 August 1910 in Auckland, and is buried at Purewa Cemetery in the suburb of Meadowbank. He has an unusual gravestone. His wife, who died six weeks after him, is buried approximately to the right of his grave and her gravestone is in the same style.

Dowell&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Marines Museum in Southsea, England.

<text>Henry Peel Ritchie VC (29 January 1876 – 9 December 1958) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for valour &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be given to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. Ritchie received the first VC awarded to naval personnel during the First World War for his actions during a raid on the German colonial harbour of Dar-es-Salaam in November 1914, which left him seriously wounded.

Despite the courage of his actions during the raid, Ritchie was not initially recommended for the Victoria Cross. Delayed by discussion at the Admiralty concerning the correct medal to award, it was not until 24 April 1915, nearly six months later, that the medal was presented. Ritchie never fully recovered from his wounds and was forced into early retirement the following year. Although he lived another 41 years, he never again commanded at sea.

==Early career==
Born in Edinburgh to Mary Ritchie (née Anderson) and Dr Robert Peel Ritchie, he spent his youth at 1 Melville Crescent in Edinburgh&#x27;s exclusive West End.

Henry was educated at George Watson&#x27;s Boys&#x27; College and Blairlodge School before he enrolled on the training ship at the age of fourteen, in 1890. Rapidly rising in the navy due to keen intelligence and impressive strength, Ritchie was promoted to lieutenant six years later, and served for the next fifteen years as a junior staff officer at Sheerness Gunnery School. In 1900 Ritchie became the armed forces lightweight boxing champion, and was the runner-up in the same contest the following year. In July 1902 he was posted to the battleship , docked in the Medway as part of the Reserve squadron.

Whilst stationed at Sheerness, he met and married Christiana Lilian Jardine, with whom he had two daughters.

His shore service ended in March 1911, when he was posted as senior lieutenant to the pre-dreadnought battleship . Promoted to commander later that year, he managed the ship&#x27;s gunnery exercises and procedures while &quot;Goliath&quot; was part of the Channel Fleet stationed in British waters. It was said by one of his junior officers that &quot;Ritchie had the reputation of being very strict, but I always found him most fair&quot;.

==War service==

At the outbreak of World War I, &quot;Goliath&quot; was ordered to the Indian Ocean to lead a blockade of the German colony of German East Africa, and specifically its main port at Dar-es-Salaam. It was feared by the Admiralty that the German navy would use its colonial ports to support commerce raiding cruisers such as or , both of which were known to be operating in the Indian Ocean at that time. This concern was amplified because &quot;Königsberg&quot;, blockaded in the delta of the Rufiji River, had operated from Dar-es-Salaam in the early months of the war and had sunk the British cruiser on a raid from the port. Remaining in Dar-es-Salaam&#x27;s large natural harbour were the German cargo ships &quot;Konig&quot; and &quot;Feldmarschall&quot;, the hospital ship &quot;Tabora&quot; and several smaller coastal vessels – all of which could conceivably be used to resupply the trapped cruiser should they leave port.

Despite a declaration from the German Governor Heinrich Schnee that neither the harbour nor its ships would be used for military purposes, the decision was taken by British Admiral Herbert King-Hall that the shipping in the port must nevertheless be neutralised. The Germans had pre-emptively scuttled a blockship in the port&#x27;s entrance channel, with the intention of preventing &quot;Goliath&quot; and the other heavy British warships from entering the harbour to shell the undefended city. With close-range bombardment impossible, the British assembled assault teams with volunteers from the small blockading flotilla. Their mission was to augment the existing blockage by immobilising or sinking those cargo ships trapped in the port, thus denying its use to the Germans as well. Command of the assault was given to Commander Ritchie as the second most senior officer present, and he commandeered two small auxiliary gunboats, &quot;Dupleix&quot; and , to carry his raiding parties.

===Raid on Dar-es-Salaam===

The day prior to the raid the decision was taken that, in order to allow the Germans time to evacuate the target ships and minimise casualties, they would be warned of the British intentions. In a brief parley the German defenders requested that the British conduct their operations under a white flag, which request was denied. Ritchie was informed that he could begin his assault on the following morning of 28 November 1914.

Due to a breakdown aboard &quot;Dupleix&quot; before it reached the harbour, Ritchie had to begin his assault with only &quot;Helmuth&quot; and a handful of small boats and launches from the blockading ships. There were no signs of life on the target ships as Ritchie&#x27;s flotilla moved uncontested into the port, and the shoreline was described by officers in the raiding party as &quot;utterly deserted&quot; and &quot;cool and inviting&quot;. Shortly after 10:00 the raiders laid explosive charges on the abandoned &quot;Konig&quot; and &quot;Feldmarschall&quot;. However they were then challenged by the port&#x27;s commanding officer, who questioned their right to be in the anchorage and demanded to be permitted to observe their actions in order that he could make a report. In a meeting aboard &quot;Helmuth&quot; it was explained to him that British orders were to disable German assets in the harbour and that, being at war, his permission was unnecessary.

After some discussion he was persuaded to disembark so that &quot;Helmuth&quot; could continue operations. Leaving demolition parties aboard the cargo vessels, Ritchie then took &quot;Helmuth&quot; further downriver to check for other shipping, but the small ship grounded on a sandbar. Assuming the route was blocked, he returned to the two cargo ships on one of the expedition&#x27;s small launches. It was at this stage, whilst conducting a final inspection, that he made the discovery of a large number of empty ammunition cases and discarded bullets in the holds of the cargo ships. Deducing that the German crew had armed themselves before they left their vessels, he suspected preparations were underway to ambush his force when it attempted to leave the harbour.

Despite this discovery Ritchie resolved to continue as ordered. He took the precaution of sending &quot;Helmuth&quot; to the harbour entrance to cover the withdrawal, and gathered together several small boats moored in the harbour. These he secured around his launch, providing added buoyancy in case it received fatal damage in the engagement he was sure would ensue. With preparations complete, one of Ritchie&#x27;s boats (from the cruiser ) moved to the harbour entrance. There it was met with a hail of fire from the shore, where the hidden German crews and town garrison had lain in wait. &quot;Helmuth&quot; was also attacked, but despite sustaining severe damage both craft were able to limp to safety, carrying several wounded. From outside the harbour &quot;Fox&quot; and &quot;Goliath&quot; responded with a heavy barrage, demolishing several streets in the town, including the Governor&#x27;s Palace. Ritchie, aboard the only remaining British boat in the harbour, attempted to pick up one of his officers who had earlier gone aboard the German hospital ship &quot;Tabora&quot; to conduct a medical inspection. This effort was unsuccessful, and on leaving the harbour Ritchie&#x27;s launch came under sustained fire from machine guns, rifles and light artillery.

With most of his crew wounded, Ritchie refused to relinquish his place at the helm until he had steered his boat to safety. He was discovered &quot;simply smothered in blood and barely conscious&quot; by &quot;Goliath&quot;&#x27;s crew when they went to his aid in the battleship&#x27;s pinnace. Ritchie was rushed to the sick bay, where it was ascertained that he had been hit in eight separate places. The raid had cost the British one dead, fourteen seriously wounded and twelve captured after they were left behind in the confusion. The raiders had in turn immobilised three large merchant vessels and destroyed several shore installations, as well as taking thirty five prisoners.

Two days later, with the wounded hospitalised in Zanzibar, &quot;Goliath&quot; and &quot;Fox&quot; returned to Dar-es-Salaam and reduced most of the seafront to rubble, setting fire to several other districts of the town as well. This reprisal served only to turn the hitherto neutral local populace against the British. Feelings ran high in both camps following the raid, with the British claiming that white flags flying from several shore installations should have prevented any German attack, and the Germans insisting that the British had attempted to capture their merchant vessels&#x27; crews despite promises not to do so. According to Stephen Snelling in &quot;The Naval VCs&quot;, both sides had entered the operation with the intention of breaching the predetermined agreements.

==Retirement and the Victoria Cross==
Ten were honoured for their role in the operation, seven receiving Distinguished Service Medals, two the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal and one, the grievously wounded Ritchie, the Victoria Cross. Ritchie had not initially been recommended for this award; the recommendation being submitted at a later date by an unidentified figure in the Admiralty. Snelling speculates that the Admiralty&#x27;s change of heart was possibly a morale-boosting measure, although Ritchie&#x27;s courage during the action was never called into question. The shrapnel and bullet wounds he sustained in the raid were extensive, including injuries to his forehead, left thumb, left arm (twice), right arm, right hip and a badly broken right leg after being hit by two large-calibre machine gun bullets.

Ritchie spent six weeks in hospital in Zanzibar before he was considered well enough to be transported home. In England he recovered during the spring of 1915 at Plymouth Hospital, with his family present. Although judged fit in late February, Ritchie was assigned light duties and was not returned to &quot;Goliath&quot;; a disappointment which proved fortunate for him when she was sunk off the Dardanelles in May 1915 by the Turkish destroyer &quot;Muavenet&quot; with the loss of five hundred lives. His Victoria Cross was presented by King George V at Buckingham Palace in April 1915. Promoted acting captain, he retired in 1917 having been deemed unfit for further service as a legacy of the wounds he had received.

Following his retirement Ritchie settled with his family back in his home city of Edinburgh, and lived a quiet and uneventful retirement. He was not involved in any official capacity during the Second World War, and died at his home in 1958. Ritchie was cremated at Warriston.

<doc id="1219275" wikidata="Q3555985" url="?curid=1219275" title="Timocreon">
<text>Timocreon of Ialysus in Rhodes (, &quot;gen&quot;.: Τιμοκρέοντος) was a Greek lyric poet who flourished about 480 BC, at the time of the Persian Wars. His poetry survives only in a very few fragments, and some claim he has received less attention from modern scholars than he deserves. He seems to have composed convivial verses for drinking parties. However, he is remembered particularly for his bitter clashes with Themistocles and Simonides over the issue of his medizing (siding with the Persian invaders), for which he had been banished from his home around the time of the Greek victory at the Battle of Salamis. He was also an athlete of some distinction and reputedly a glutton.

An epitaph for him, appearing in the &quot;Palatine Anthology&quot;, was credited to his rival, Simonides: &quot;After much drinking, much eating and much slandering, I, Timocreon of Rhodes, rest here.&quot;

==Life and poetry==
Plutarch is the main source of information about Timocreon&#x27;s role as a medizer and enemy of Themistocles (&quot;Themistocles&quot; 21), while Herodotus supplies much of the background information (&quot;Histories&quot; 8.111-12). According to these accounts, Themistocles, the hero of the Battle of Salamis, gave up the pursuit of the retreating Persians to extort money from Greek island states in the Aegean, without the knowledge of his fellow commanders. It is possible that Timocreon was on Andros at this time and he paid Themistocles three talents of silver to restore him to his home town in Rhodes, from which he had been exiled for medizing. Themistocles took the money but reneged on the agreement and, even though bonds of hospitality between them required good faith, he accepted a bribe from someone else in a new deal that excluded Timocreon. Sailing away with the poet&#x27;s money in his coffers but minus the poet himself, Themistocles soon arrived at the Corinthian Isthmus, where the Greek commanders met to decide who most deserved the prize for valour in their recent victory at Salamis. Themistocles hosted a banquet in an attempt to curry favour with his colleagues but won nothing by it since each of the commanders subsequently voted himself the most deserving of the prize (&quot;Histories&quot; 8.123-4). These events are commemorated by Timocreon in Fragment 727 (see below), composed in 480 BC or just a few years after the Battle of Salamis, though some scholars date it after Themistocles&#x27; fall from grace in Athens in 471 BC.

In an account recorded by Athenaeus, Timocreon ended up at the court of the Persian king where he distinguished himself as an athlete and glutton, eating so much that the king himself asked him what he was trying to do, to which Timocreon replied that he was getting ready to beat up countless Persians. He made good his promise the next day and, after overwhelming all the Persians who were game enough to fight him, he commenced punching the air, just to show that &quot;he had all those blows left if anyone wanted to take him on.&quot; However, the boorishness and gluttony of athletes was a &quot;topos&quot; of Greek comedy and even a hero like Hercules was the butt of many jokes.

In some accounts, Themistocles also ended up visiting the Persian king, following his ostracism and spectacular fall from public favour in Athens. Rumours that he was medizing offered Timocreon a chance for revengesee Fragment 728 and Fragment 729. Timocreon was also known as a composer of &quot;scolia&quot; (drinking-songs) and, according to the &quot;Suda&quot;, wrote plays in the style of Old Comedy. A famous drinking song of his was about the god Plutus, which seems to have inspired imitation by Aristophanessee Fragment 731. Nothing however is known of his comedies and it is probable that he was not a dramatist but simply composed mocking lyrics. In an account by Philodemus (&quot;On Vices&quot; 10.4), he is presented as a conceited singer at a festival competition, where he performed a song about Castor. Diogenian mentions two proverbs that Timocreon employed in his verses. One was a Cyprian fable about doves escaping from a sacrificial fire only to fall into another fire later on (demonstrating that wrong-doers eventually get their just deserts), and the other was a Carian fable about a fisherman who espies an octopus in the winter sea and wonders whether or not to dive after it, since this is a choice between his children starving or himself freezing to death (i.e. you&#x27;re damned if you do and damned if you don&#x27;t). The latter proverb was also used by Simonides, whose rivalry with Timocreon seems to have inspired the abusive &#x27;epitaph&#x27; quoted earlier and the epigrammatic reply from the Rhodian poet in A.P. 13.31.

===Fragment 727 PMG===

This is the largest extant poem attributed to Timocreon. It was quoted by Plutarch in a biography of Themistocles, as were the following two fragments, 728 and 729 (see Life above for historical context). It begins like a hymn of praise or encomium for the Athenian hero, Aristides, but soon turns into a denunciation of Themistocles.

The poem is generally more valued by historians than by literary criticsit has been thought to lack elegance and wit, and it strangely includes elements of choral lyric though it is not a choral song but a solo performance. The choral elements are dactylo-epitrite meter and what seems to be triadic structure (i.e. strophe, antistrophe, epode) C.M. Bowra considered it &quot;a strange and uncomfortable poem&quot;. Another scholar saw parallels between it and Anacreon&#x27;s &quot;Artemon&quot; but judged Anacreon&#x27;s poem to have more grace and wit. However, scholarly analysis of the poem has not produced agreement or convincing results and much depends on how we interpret the poet&#x27;s tone. The reference to Leto is obscure but she may have had some connection with Salamis or perhaps there was a temple to her at Corinth.

===Fragment 728===

These lines introduced one of Timocreon&#x27;s most bitter denunciations of Themistocles, according to Plutarch.

===Fragment 729===

The reference to a docked tail is usually understood to indicate some mishap the poet suffered. Plutarch identified Themistocles as one of the other &#x27;scoundrels&#x27; referred to in the poem.

===Fragment 731===

These verses were recorded by a scholiast in a commentary on a play of Aristophanes. Apparently the verses were imitated by Aristophanes in &quot;Acharnians&quot; (lines 532-6).

===A.P. 13.31===

The couplet is listed among the &quot;metrical curiosities&quot; of the Palatine Anthology (its form is a hexameter followed by a trochaic tetrameter) and it might be Timocreon&#x27;s reply to Simonides&#x27; &#x27;epitaph&#x27;, as translated in the introduction of this article. Simonides was from Ceos.

<doc id="1219283" wikidata="Q7806922" url="?curid=1219283" title="Timomachus">
<text>Timomachus of Byzantium (or Timomachos, ) was an influential painter of the first century BCE.

== Works ==

Pliny the Elder, in his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; (35.136), records that Julius Caesar had acquired two paintings by Timomachus, one of &quot;Ajax&quot; during his madness, and a &quot;Medea&quot; meditating the slaying of her children, which cost him the considerable sum of 80 talents. Scholars have connected these works with the carrying away of a &quot;Medea&quot; and &quot;Ajax&quot; from Cyzicus, an ancient port of Anatolia, mentioned in Cicero&#x27;s &quot;In Verrem&quot; (2.4.135), and propose that Caesar acquired them there, shortly after his victory at Pharsalus. The paintings, &quot;a pair linked to each other by their rage&quot;, were installed in front of the Temple of Venus Genetrix, and remained there until their destruction by fire in 80 CE.

The &quot;Anthology of Planudes&quot; preserves a number of epigrams on the &quot;Medea&quot;, which note its incomplete state, and praise its emotional intensity and verisimilitude. Scholars believe that two well-known depictions of Medea preserved at Pompeii were composed under the influence of Timomachus&#x27; work.

<text>The Creole&quot; mutiny, sometimes called the Creole&quot; case, was a slave revolt aboard the American slave ship &quot;Creole&quot; in November 1841, when the brig was seized by the 128 slaves who were aboard the ship when it reached Nassau in the British colony of the Bahamas where slavery was abolished. The brig was transporting enslaved people as part of the coastwise slave trade in the American South. It has been described as the &quot;most successful slave revolt in US history&quot;. Two died in the revolt, an enslaved person and a member of the crew.

The United Kingdom had abolished the slave trade with the Slave Trade Act in 1807, and the practise of slavery throughout the British Empire in 1833. Accordingly, British officials in the Bahamas ruled that the enslaved people on &quot;Creole&quot; were freed after their arrival in Nassau, if they chose to stay. Nineteen men who were identified as being responsible for the revolt were imprisoned on charges of mutiny; an Admiralty Court hearing in April 1842 ruled that the men had been illegally held captive as slaves and had the right to use force to gain freedom. The 17 men (two of the prisoners had died in the interim) were released and given their freedom.

When the &quot;Creole&quot; reached New Orleans in December 1841 with three enslaved women and two enslaved children aboard (who had refused to leave the ship), Southerners were outraged about the loss of property; calls for compensation ensued. Relations between the United States and Britain were strained for a time. The incident occurred during negotiations for the Webster–Ashburton Treaty of 1842 but was not directly addressed. The parties settled on seven crimes qualifying for extradition in the treaty, but they did not include slave revolts. Eventually claims for losses of slaves from &quot;Creole&quot; and two other American ships transporting enslaved persons were repaid to their owners, along with other claims dating to 1814, in a treaty of 1853 between the United States and Britain, for which an arbitration commission awarded settlements in 1855 against each nation.

== Background and revolt ==
In the fall of 1841, the American brig &quot;Creole,&quot; owned by Johnson and Eperson of Richmond, Virginia, was transporting 135 enslaved African-Americans for sale in New Orleans, a major market in the American South for slaves. 103 of those who would be transported on &quot;Creole&quot; were being kept in slave pens at Richmond, while another 32 were purchased at Hampton Roads for transport. Most of the slaves were owned by Johnson and Eperson. 26 people were owned by Thomas McCarg, who operated as a slave trader and was one of the passengers on board. While the United States government had abolished the transatlantic slave trade in 1807, it permitted the domestic trading of slaves among the states which kept slavery legalized; a &quot;coastwise slave trade&quot; had sprung up in the 19th century, transporting enslaved African-Americans among the American South. &quot;Creole&quot; also carried tobacco, a crew of ten, the captain&#x27;s wife, daughter and niece; four white passengers, including slave traders; and eight enslaved black servants, for a total of 160 individuals on board.

Madison Washington, the leader of the revolt, had been born into slavery but managed to escape to Canada. However, he was forced back into slavery after returning to Virginia to look for his wife, who was among those being transported to New Orleans to be sold as slaves. The enslaved persons were kept in the forward hold, but Washington managed to gain access to the deck after one of the crew had lifted the grate. On November 7, 1841, Washington and eighteen other enslaved men rebelled; they overpowered the crew and killed John R. Hewell, one of the slave traders, with a knife. The crew and passengers had only one gun among them - which they never used. The captain, who was wounded, joined by two of the crew had gone up into the rigging to escape the fighting. One of the people who&#x27;d been enslaved was badly wounded and later died. Some other members of the crew were wounded but all survived.
The enslaved people demanded that plantation overseer William Merritt navigate the ship for them, which he promised to do. They first demanded that the ship be taken to Liberia, which the American Colonization Society had established as a colony for freed African-Americans in West Africa. Merritt informed them that the voyage was impossible as the ship did not have enough food or water for the journey. Another leader of the revolt, Ben Blacksmith, said they should be taken to the British West Indies, as he knew the enslaved people from the &quot;Hermosa&quot; had gained their freedom there the previous year.

== Arrival in Nassau ==
On November 9, 1841, the &quot;Creole&quot; reached Nassau, where it was boarded by the harbor pilot and his crew, all local black Bahamians. They told the enslaved people who had been held on board, under Bahamian colonial law, they were free. The crew advised them to go ashore at once. The Bahamian Quarantine Officer came aboard. As the captain Robert Ensor was badly wounded, the officer took First Mate Zephaniah Gifford to the American consulate to inform the American consul of the events which had transpired. At the consul&#x27;s request, the governor of the Bahamas ordered a group of soldiers to board the &quot;Creole&quot; to prevent the escape of the men implicated in Hewell&#x27;s death. Fearing the British authorities would attempt to free the enslaved people being transported on &quot;Creole&quot; as per their laws, the American consul attempted to organize a group of American sailors on the island to take back control of the ship. He intended to have them sail the ship out of British jurisdiction with the enslaved people still aboard. The group of American sailors approached the ship on November 12, intending to sail it away, but they were foiled by a Bahamian who shouted a warning to the officer of the soldiers aboard the &quot;Creole.&quot; He threatened to order his men to fire into the boat of the Americans so they withdrew.

After an investigation by magistrates, on Friday, 13 November 1841, the Bahamian Attorney-General went aboard. He told the nineteen rebels that they would be imprisoned. He informed the remainder of the enslaved people of their new circumstances: &quot;You are free, and at liberty to go onshore, and wherever you please.&quot; A fleet of small boats manned by locals, who until then had surrounded the brig at a distance, immediately came forward. The Attorney-General warned the people against boarding the &quot;Creole,&quot; but said they could provide passage to the enslaved persons who wished to go ashore. Most did so, although three women, a young girl and boy stayed in hiding on board. They eventually sailed with the ship to New Orleans and were sold as slaves. The New Providence authorities arranged for a ship bound for Jamaica, also a British colony, to take the passengers to the island for free, and announced it in the local newspaper. Numerous enslaved people from the &quot;Creole&quot; left for Jamaica aboard it. After the Bahamian colonial government arrested the conspirators, the United States government dropped its claims for all the enslaved people to be returned to its custody. There was no extradition treaty at the time between Britain and the United States governing such circumstances.

The British authorities determined that the people who&#x27;d been enslaved had not committed any breach of British or maritime law. As under British law they were free men, they were considered to have the right to use force to escape the detention of illegal enslavement. The Admiralty Court in Nassau held a special session in April to consider a charge of piracy against the men implicated in the mutiny. Ruling that their action was not piracy, the Court ordered the 17 men (two had died in the interim) to be released on April 16, 1842. As a total of 128 people who had been held as slaves gained their freedom, the case has been described as the &quot;most successful slave revolt in US history&quot;.

The &quot;Creole&quot; had departed months before for the United States, reaching its original destination of New Orleans on December 2, 1841. Five people were still aboard, outraging planters and politicians who learned that the remaining people had been freed from slavery by the British authorities. The case attracted national attention in the United States and provoked a diplomatic controversy. In Boston in 1842, abolitionist William E. Channing published a pamphlet, &quot;The Duty of the Free States or Remarks Suggested by the Case of the &#x27;Creole&#x27;&quot;, to refute claims by Southern politicians that the human property of American slave owners should be protected in foreign ports. The issue was also under discussion due to negotiations over the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, which was ratified with the United Kingdom that year. Less than a year later, the &quot;Creole&quot; was wrecked in a violent storm while in harbor at Funchal, Madeira.

==Political consequences==
The &quot;Creole&quot; case generated diplomatic tension between the United Kingdom and the United States and caused political rumblings within the United States. Southerners were outraged to have lost &quot;property&quot; in another instance of British authorities freeing the enslaved persons from American ships that had gone into their ports in the Caribbean. The John Tyler administration supported Southerners in seeking the return of the enslaved human beings to captivity.

Secretary of State Daniel Webster stated the US position to the United Kingdom that the enslaved human beings were legal property of US citizens and demanded their return.

The United Kingdom had abolished slavery effective August 1834, and it rejected the U.S. claim. It had advised all nations that under its law, ships that went into its ports would forfeit any people who were enslaved on board. The British government said that Nassau was a British territory where British law must be applied. Under it, the &#x27;slaves&#x27; aboard the &quot;Creole&quot; were to be considered free passengers. Accordingly, unless they could be proved to have broken local or maritime law, it would be false imprisonment to hold them against their will.

The abolitionist Charles Sumner argued that enslaved people &quot;became free men when taken, by the voluntary action of their owners, beyond the jurisdiction of the slave states.&quot; In March 1842 US Representative Joshua Reed Giddings of Ohio introduced a series of nine resolutions on this topic, arguing against the federal government acting on behalf of the slaveholders. He argued that Virginia state law did not apply to enslaved persons who were outside Virginian waters, the federal government had no part in it, and the coastwise slave trade was unconstitutional, as enslaved people were beyond state law on the high seas, and thus free people.

Southerners in the House of Representatives disagreed with his position. The members censured Giddings by a large margin for violating an informal gag rule that had been in effect since 1836, barring discussion of slavery in the House. He promptly resigned. When the Ohio legislature held a special election in May 1842 for his seat, the voters of Ohio overwhelmingly reelected Giddings, by 7,469 to 383.

Encouraged by the outcome of the &quot;Creole&quot; revolt, abolitionists renewed their political attacks on slavery and the coastwise trade. In the newspaper article, &quot;The Hero Mutineers,&quot; Madison Washington was named the &#x27;romantic hero.&#x27; Washington was said to have shown sympathy toward the white crew members on the &quot;Creole&quot; by preventing others who had been enslaved from killing all of them when they made a last effort to regain control and as such, their freedom. He was said to have personally dressed sailors&#x27; wounds after the revolt.

The case roused strong feelings on both sides of the Atlantic, as the events occurred during the negotiations related to the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 between the two nations, primarily to settle the borders between the US and Canada, a British colony. According to the &quot;New York Courier and Inquirer&quot;, Daniel Webster, as Secretary of State, wrote to Lord Ashburton, then in Washington, DC:

The Creole case is presented in strong terms by Mr Webster in a letter (which, when published, will bring all the anti-slavery people about his ears)...&quot; To this Lord Ashburton replied that as the case had effectively arisen after his departure from England he was &#x27;not empowered to treat upon the subject&#x27;. He reaffirmed the position that as slavery was no longer recognized under British law, any foreign person (enslaved) arriving in British possessions was automatically considered as free – as was also the case in those American states that did not recognize slavery. He did however promise that British officials in the West Indies would be given &#x27;directions&#x27;...&#x27;to do nothing in this respect when it can be properly avoided&#x27; in the interests of &#x27;good neighbourhood&#x27;.

Among other declarations, the Webster-Ashburton Treaty called for a final end to the slave trade (profiting from the sale and suffering of human beings) on the high seas, to be enforced by both signatories.

Seven lawsuits were lodged against insurance companies in Louisiana by the slaveowners who had experienced financial losses due to the revolt, as the insurance companies initially refused to compensate them. Most of these insurance cases were consolidated and eventually heard by the Louisiana State Supreme Court.Result?

==Earlier cases==
The &quot;Comet&quot; in 1830 and the &quot;Encomium&quot; in 1833 were American ships in the coastwise slave trade that were forced by weather into British ports in the Caribbean while carrying numerous enslaved persons bound for the domestic (slave) market in New Orleans. The British freed both groups. Britain eventually paid compensation for these seizures, as it had not yet abolished slavery in its territories.

When Parliament abolished slavery in its territories in 1833, Britain advised other countries that slave ships that put into its ports would forfeit the enslaved persons without compensation. After British abolition of slavery in its colonies, effective in 1834, its officials freed enslaved persons from the &quot;Enterprise&quot; (1835), and the &quot;Hermosa&quot; (1840), without compensation.

In 1840, the &quot;Hermosa&quot;, a US schooner in the coastwise slave trade carrying 38 enslaved people from Richmond to New Orleans for sale, went aground on one of the Abacos islands in the Bahamas. After wreckers took the ship to port, the captain refused to let the enslaved persons off and with the US consul, tried to arrange for another ship to take and deliver his enslaved cargo to the United States. British magistrates backed with armed force went onto the &quot;Hermosa&quot;, removing the enslaved people and freeing them when they reached the port. The Americans protested. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hermosa&quot; cases were submitted for arbitration under an 1853 claims treaty and, together with claims for the &quot;Creole&quot; and a variety of other unrelated claims dating to 1814, Britain paid a settlement in 1855 to the United States for these three cases. A total of nearly 450 American enslaved persons achieved freedom due to British colonies&#x27; actions in these five cases.

==Compensation==
After years of discussion, the United Kingdom and the United States signed a February 1853 Treaty of Claims which articles included the claims of slave-owners who had suffered financially through the British emancipation of slaves in the &quot;Enterprise&quot; (1835), &quot;Hermosa&quot; (1840) and &quot;Creole&quot; incidents. A claims commission met in London from September 15, 1853, to January 15, 1855, to settle the amount of total awards covered under this treaty, which extended to a variety of claims dating from December 1814. In February 1855, Congress passed a bill accepting the commission&#x27;s settlement and appropriating funds for the US payment required.

==Related incidents==
British officials may have been warned off liberating enslaved people from US ships but citizens sometimes acted independently. In 1855 the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that an enslaved American person had been removed by Jamaicans from the brig &quot;Young America&quot; at Savanna-la-Mar and &quot;set at large&quot;. Although the action was taken by private individuals and not officials, the paper noted the potential for future conflict between the nations, and called for a lasting solution to be found by &quot;the two governments interested&quot;.

==In popular culture==
*In 1852 the noted abolitionist Frederick Douglass published a novella called &quot;The Heroic Slave&quot;, featuring Washington and inspired by the &quot;Creole&quot; revolt. He stressed the personal aspects of the slaves&#x27; rebellion, placing it firmly within American revolutionary tradition.

==Giddings&#x27;s Resolutions==
Joshua Giddings introduced these resolutions in Congress in 1842 and was censured for opening debate on slavery in defiance of a ruling against it. He resigned and returned to his home state of Ohio, where he was quickly re-elected by his constituents in a special election. He soon returned to Congress.

# Resolved, That, prior to the Adoption of the Federal Constitution, each of the several States composing this Union exercised full and exclusive jurisdiction over the subject of slavery within its own territory, and possessed full power to continue or abolish it at pleasure. 
# Resolved, That, by adopting the Constitution, no part of the aforesaid powers were delegated to the Federal Government, but were reserved by and still pertain to each of the several States. 
# Resolved, That, by the 8th section of the 1st article of the Constitution, each of the several States surrendered to the Federal Government all jurisdiction over the subjects of commerce and navigation upon the high seas. 
# Resolved. That slavery, being an abridgment of the natural rights of man, can exist only by force of positive &quot;municipal law,&quot; and is necessarily confined to the territorial jurisdiction of the power creating it. 
# Resolved, That when a ship belonging to the citizens of any State of the Union leaves the waters and territory of such State, and enters upon the high seas, the persons on board cease to be subject to the slave laws of such State, and therefore are governed in their relations to each other by, and are amenable to, the laws of the United States. 
# Resolved, That when the brig &quot;Creole&quot;, on her late passage for New Orleans, left the territorial jurisdiction of Virginia, the slave laws of that State ceased to have jurisdiction over the persons on board such brig, and such persons became amenable only to the laws of the United States. 
# Resolved, That the persons on board the said ship, in resuming their natural rights of personal liberty, violated no law of the United States, incurred no legal responsibility, and are justly liable to no punishment. 
# Resolved, That all attempts to regain possession of or to re-enslave said persons are unauthorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States, and are incompatible with our national honor. 
# Resolved, That all attempts to exert our national influence in favor of the &quot;coastwise slave trade&quot;, or to place this nation in the attitude of maintaining a &quot;commerce in human beings&quot;, are subversive to the rights and injurious to the feelings of the free States, are unauthorized by the Constitution, and prejudicial to our national character.

<text>8th Street is a street in the New York City borough of Manhattan that runs from Sixth Avenue to Third Avenue and also from Avenue B to Avenue D; its addresses switch from West to East as it crosses Fifth Avenue. Between Third Avenue and Avenue A it is named St. Mark&#x27;s Place, after the nearby St. Mark&#x27;s Church in-the-Bowery on 10th Street at Second Avenue.

St. Mark&#x27;s Place is considered a main cultural street for the East Village. Vehicular traffic runs east along both one-way streets. St. Mark&#x27;s Place features a wide variety of retailers. Venerable institutions lining St. Mark&#x27;s Place have included Gem Spa and the St. Mark&#x27;s Hotel. There are several open-front markets that sell sunglasses, clothing, and jewelry. In her 400-year history of St. Mark&#x27;s Place (&quot;St. Marks Is Dead&quot;), Ada Calhoun called the street &quot;like superglue for fragmented identities&quot; and wrote that &quot;the street is not for people who have chosen their lives ... [it] is for the wanderer, the undecided, the lonely, and the promiscuous.&quot;

==History==

===Early years===
Wouter van Twiller, colonial governor of New Amsterdam, once owned a tobacco farm near 8th and MacDougal Streets. Such farms were located around the area until the 1830s. Nearby, a Native American trail crossed the island via the rights-of-way of Greenwich Avenue, Astor Place, and Stuyvesant Street.

The Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811 defined the street grid for much of Manhattan. According to the plan, 8th Street was to run from Greenwich Lane (now Greenwich Avenue) in the west to First Avenue on the east. The area west of Greenwich Lane was already developed as Greenwich Village, while the area east of First Avenue was reserved for a wholesale food market.

The plan was amended many times as the grid took shape and public spaces were added or eliminated. The marketplace proposal was scrapped in 1824, allowing 8th Street to continue eastward to the river. On the west side, Sixth Avenue was extended and Greenwich Lane shortened, shifting the boundary of 8th Street, ever so slightly, to Sixth Avenue and allowing Mercer, Greene, Wooster and MacDougal Streets to continue northward to 8th.

===19th century===
After the Commissioners&#x27; Plan was laid out, property along the street&#x27;s right of way quickly developed. By 1835, the New York University opened its first building, the Silver Center, along Eighth Street near the Washington Square Park. Row houses were also built on Eighth Street. The street ran between the Jefferson Market, built in 1832 at the west end, and the Tompkins Market, built in 1836, at the east end. These were factors in the street&#x27;s commercialization in later years.

Eighth Street was supposed to extend to a market place at Avenue C, but that idea never came to fruition. Capitalizing on the high-class status of Bond, Bleecker, Great Jones, and Lafayette Streets in NoHo, developer Thomas E. Davis developed the east end of the street and renamed it &quot;St. Mark&#x27;s Place&quot; in 1835. Davis built up St. Mark&#x27;s Place between Third and Second Avenues between 1831 and 1832. Although the original plan was for Federal homes, only three such houses remained in 2014.

Meanwhile, Eighth Street became home to a literary scene. At Astor Place and Eighth Street, the Astor Opera House was built by wealthy men and opened in 1847. Publisher Evert Augustus Duyckinck founded a private library at his 50 East Eighth Street home. Anne Lynch started a famous literary salon at 116 Waverly Place and relocated to 37 West Eighth Street in 1848. Around this time and up until the 1890s, Eighth Street was co-named Clinton Place in memory of politician DeWitt Clinton, whose widow lived along nearby University Place.

In the 1850s, Eighth Street housed an educational scene as well. The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, a then-free institution for art, architecture and engineering education, was opened in 1858. The Century Club, an arts and letters association, relocated to 46 East Eighth Street around that time; the Bible House of the American Bible Society, was nearby. In addition, the Brevoort Hotel, as well as a marble mansion built by John Taylor Johnston, were erected at Fifth Avenue and Eighth Street.

At the same time, German immigrants moved into the area around Tompkins Square Park. The area around St. Mark&#x27;s Place was nicknamed , or &quot;Little Germany&quot;, because of a huge influx of German immigrants in the 1840s and 1850s. Many of the homes turned into boarding houses, as the area had 50,000 residents but not a lot of real estate. Tenement housing was also built on St. Mark&#x27;s Place.

By the 1870s, apartments replaced stables and houses along the stretch of Eighth Street west of MacDougal Street. The elevated Third and Sixth Avenue Lines were also built during that time, with stops along the former at Ninth Street and along the latter at Eighth Street.

At the southwest corner of Broadway and Eighth Street, the street&#x27;s first commercial building was built. By the 1890s, buildings on the stretch from Bowery to Fifth Avenue were used for trade. In 1904, the Wanamaker&#x27;s Department Store opened at the former A.T. Stewart store along Broadway between 9th and 10th Streets, with an annex built at Eighth Street.

===20th century===
In the early 1900s, Little Germany was shrinking. At the same time, Jews, Hungarians, Poles, Ukrainians, and Russians from Eastern Europe started moving in. In 1916, members of the Slovenian community and Franciscans established the Slovenian Church of St. Cyril, which still operates. At this point, St. Mark&#x27;s Place was considered a part of the Lower East Side.

On the western stretch of Eighth Street, an art scene was growing. Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, Daniel Chester French, and other artists moved in the stables at MacDougal Alley at this time. By 1916, a studio complex for artists replaced most of these stables, making the areas around Eighth Street popular for bohemians. Whitney, a patron for other American painters, combined four houses on West Eighth Street houses into the Whitney Museum in 1931.

The 1927 construction of the skyscraper at One Fifth Avenue, as well as the Eighth Street Playhouse movie theater, helped influence development on the Sixth Avenue end of the street, where construction of the IND Eighth Avenue Line had required destruction of many buildings there. On an adjoining block, the Women&#x27;s House of Detention was built in Jefferson Market complex in 1929–1932 and existed through the 1970s.

In the 1930s, after Prohibition ended, West Eighth Street became an entertainment area. Around that time, the New York School movement for abstract expressionist painters was centered around Eighth Street, with many such painters moving to Eighth Street.

After World War II, property along 8th Street was converted to apartment houses. The Rhinelander Estate, one of the major landowners on Eighth Street, erected a building between Washington Square North, Fifth Avenue, West Eighth Street, and the Whitney Museum site. Sailor&#x27;s Snug Harbor, the other major land owner, demolished the blocks from Fifth Avenue to Broadway on the north side of Eighth and Ninth Streets, including the popular Brevoort Hotel. It replaced these blocks mainly with low-rise apartment buildings and stores, as well as two high-rises. Around this time, West Eighth Street was also becoming the location of neighborhood commerce.

After the elevated train lines were demolished in the 1940s and 1950s, the real estate industry tried to entice residents to the St. Mark&#x27;s Place area, describing the neighborhood as &quot;East Village&quot;. This area became home to an underground scene, and as it was far from public transportation, it became rundown. A 1965 &quot;Newsweek&quot; article described the East Village by telling readers to &quot;head east from Greenwich Village, and when it starts to look squalid, around the Bowery and Third Avenue, you know you&#x27;re there.&quot;

In the 1960s, Macdougal and West Eighth Streets, as well as St. Mark&#x27;s Place, became a popular area for hippies. A women&#x27;s clothing store, a pharmacy, and bookstores were replaced by fast food restaurants and other shops, directed toward the area&#x27;s tourism base. By 1968, St, Mark&#x27;s Place became a stopping point for tour buses, which formerly skipped the area.

In 1977, St. Marks Place became the epicenter of punk rock, when Manic Panic opened its doors on July 7, 1977 (7/7/77). The shop quickly attracted musicians from Cyndi Lauper to the Ramones.

In 1980, hot dog company Nathan&#x27;s Famous moved into the location of a former bookstore on Eighth Street, to the anger of some Greenwich Village residents. However, other establishments, such as the B. Dalton bookstore, clothing stores, and shoe stores, started to attract tourists to the area. By the 1990s, the areas around both Eighth Street and St. Mark&#x27;s Place were becoming rapidly gentrified, with new buildings and establishments being developed along both streets. The Village Alliance Business Improvement District was formed in 1993 to care for the area around Eighth Street.

==Notable buildings and sites==

===8th Street===
East
* 127 Avenue B, also known as 295 East 8th Street, on Tompkins Square Park, was originally the Tompkins Square Lodging House for Boys and Industrial School. It was designed by Vaux &amp; Radford and built in 1887. The building later became the Children&#x27;s Aid Society Newsboy and Bootblacks Lodging House, and was briefly a synagogue, Talmud Torah Darchei Noam. The building was restored in 2006, and is now apartments. The building was featured prominently in the 2002 film, &quot;In America&quot;.
* The stucco-faced apartment building at 4–26 East 8th Street between Fifth Avenue and University Place was built in 1834–36 and remodeled in 1916. It was designed by Harvey Wiley Corbett, and has been described as a &quot;stage set, symbolic of the &#x27;village&#x27; of a bohemian artist.&quot;
* The residential apartment building at One Fifth Avenue, on the southeast corner of East 8th Street, was built in 1929 and was designed by Helme, Corbett &amp; Harrison and Sugarman &amp; Berger. The brown brick building features numerous step-backs, battlements, buttresses and other suggestions of medieval architecture.
* The full-block building on 8th Street bordered by Lafayette Street, 9th Street and Broadway, which carries the addresses 499 Lafayette Avenue and 770 Broadway, was built in 1902 to be the Annex for the giant John Wanamaker&#x27;s Department Store located one block north between 9th and 10th Streets. The two buildings were connected by a skybridge over 9th Street which was dubbed the &quot;Bridge of Progress&quot;. The main store was destroyed by fire in 1955, but the Annex building remains, and features retail space as well as offices.
* Across the street, also between Lafayette Street and Broadway, 8th Street runs behind Clinton Hall at 13 Astor Place, also known as 21 Astor Place. This was once the site of the Astor Opera House outside of which the Astor Place Riot occurred. The Opera House opened in 1847 and closed in 1890 to be replaced by the current building, designed by George E. Harney, which became the site of the New York Mercantile Library. The library left the 11-story building in 1932, and it has since been a union headquarters (District 65 of the Distributive Workers of America), the Astor Place Hotel, and, as of 1995, condominiums.

West
* Marlton House at 3–5 West 8th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues in Greenwich Village was built in 1900 as the Marlton Hotel, a single room occupancy (SRO) facility. It was notable for its bohemian clientele, but since 1987 it has been used as a dormitory for The New School.
* The three former 1838 row houses at 8–12 West 8th Street between Fifth Avenue and Macdougal Street in Greenwich Village were converted in 1931 by Auguste L. Noel of Noel &amp; Miller into the first home of the Whitney Museum of American Art, which sculptor and heiress Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney had established in 1929, after the Metropolitan Museum of Art rejected the donation of her extensive collection of contemporary and avant-garde artworks. In 1914, Whitney had started the Whitney Studio at 8 West 8th Street, just behind her own studio on MacDougal Alley. The museum was located here until 1954, when it moved uptown. The building is currently, along with 14 West 8th Street (built in 1900), the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture.

Beginning in 1913 the building housed the Saint Mark&#x27;s Russian and Turkish Baths. In 1979 the building was renovated and renamed the New St. Marks Baths, a gay bath house. The New Saint Marks Baths was closed by the New York City Department of Health in 1985, due to concerns of HIV transmission.

<text>Donald Alan Schön (September 19, 1930 – September 13, 1997) was an American philosopher and professor in urban planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He developed the concept of reflective practice and contributed to the theory of organizational learning.

== Education and career ==
He was born in Boston and brought up in Massachusetts, at Brookline and Worcester. After undertaking a Bachelor&#x27;s at Yale University, he completed Master&#x27;s and doctoral studies in philosophy at Harvard University. His thesis dealt with John Dewey&#x27;s theory of inquiry. He also studied at the Sorbonne in Paris and pursued advanced study in music (piano and clarinet).

For many years Schön was with the large consulting firm, Arthur D. Little along with Raymond Hainer with whom he worked on his ideas which resulted in his first seminal work, &quot;The Displacement of Concepts&quot;. In fact this original work was a new interpretation on the history of the ideas of all time—a complement to Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s work or even a more accurate look at the dynamics of invention. His later works there presaged a lifetime of interest in the subtle processes whereby technological and other change is absorbed (or not) by social systems. In 1970, he delivered the Reith Lectures for the BBC, on how learning occurs within organizations and societies that are in permanent states of flux. These presentations were published subsequently in his &quot;Beyond the Stable State&quot;.

Donald Schön became a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1968 and stayed on with an appointment in 1972 as Ford Professor of Urban Studies and Education. He remained there until his death in 1997. During these decades his long collaboration with adult education/organizational behavior expert Chris Argyris yielded key insights into the question of how organizations develop, adapt, learn or fail in these critical missions. Their collaboration led to two books in the 1970s— &quot;Theory in Practice&quot; and &quot;Organizational Learning&quot;— the latter of which was completely revised and published in 1996 as &quot;Organizational Learning II&quot;.

== Contributions ==
Donald Schön introduced several important organizing concepts to a wide range of applied fields. He proposed the idea of a &quot;generative metaphor&quot; as figurative descriptions of social situations, usually implicit and even semi-conscious but that shape the way problems are tackled. For example he argued that the practice of describing a troubled inner city neighborhood as urban &quot;blight&quot; and, hence, taking steps rooted in the idea of disease, led to disastrous &quot;urban renewal&quot; projects in the 1960s. In the move for the renewal of the slum area the approach based on the metaphorical view that it is a &quot;blight&quot; or a diseased body is different if the area is metaphorically seen as a natural community with a stifled natural growth.

Schön also developed the concept of &quot;learning systems&quot; as he pioneered the studies that aimed to explore the possibility of learning at the supra-individual level. In 1971, he identified a state&#x27;s government as an example of a learning system in the book &quot;Beyond the Stable State&quot;. Two years later, he further explained that &quot;a learning system must be one which dynamic conservatism operates at such a level in such a way as to permit change of state, without intolerable threat to the essential functions the system fulfils for the self.&quot;

Schön devoted a trilogy of books, which included &quot;The Reflective Practitioner&quot; (1983), to his argument for reflection and his notion of the reflective practice inquiry. This emerged out of a self-described inability to understand the process of planning, which included his failure to determine what his students learned from field work experience. Schön then addressed this problem when he developed his &quot;reflection-in-action&quot; notion explained in the book. This involved the examination of the thinking, talking, and interacting processes through a series of case studies involving different professionals working in the engineering, architecture, management, psychotherapy, and town planning domains. His model challenged practitioners to reconsider the role of technical knowledge versus &quot;artistry&quot; in developing professional excellence. The concept most notably affected study of teacher education, health and social care professions and architectural design. This was demonstrated in the way it influenced constructivist teacher education reformers, who studied architectural and other professional practices. Schön also criticized what he called the commitment on the part of institutions of higher learning to a view of knowledge that featured a &quot;selective inattention to professional competence&quot;. In the context of reflective practice, Schön suggested the replacement of the dominant epistemology of technical rationalism with his reflection-in-action framework. His work contributed to the transition of MIT&#x27;s Department of City and Regional Planning to become the Department of Urban Studies and Planning.

Schön also developed &quot;Conversation with the Situation&quot; - an approach to understand the design process. Through a series of case studies, he explained that the pattern of thinking, talking, and interacting for different types of professionals identified as designers (architects, city planner, engineer, psychoanalyst, scientist, and business manager) are similar with the way they perform strategic moves that is analogous to &quot;talking to the situation&quot; and following which the situation &quot;talks back&quot;.

Together with his MIT colleague Martin Rein, Schön outlined in 1994 the so-called &quot;frame reflection&quot;, which prescribed critical shared reconstruction of &quot;frames&quot; of social problems which are otherwise taken for granted and advocated system-level learning to find solutions for &quot;intractable policy controversies.&quot; Schön maintained that a shift is needed in the frame of our perception - from the currently accepted framework to critical reflection and transformational learning.
Much of his later work related to reflection in practice and the concept of learning systems. The course of his career would cover three areas in this field: 1) the learning society; 2) professional learning and effectiveness; and, 3) the reflective practitioner. Together with Chris Argyris, Schön provided the foundation to much of the management thinking on descriptive and interventionist dimensions to learning research. One of their theories hold that organizations and individuals should be flexible and should incorporate lessons learned throughout their lifespans, known as organizational learning. His interest and involvement in jazz music inspired him to teach the concept of improvisation and &#x27;thinking on one&#x27;s feet&#x27;, and that through a feedback loop of experience, learning and practice, we can continually improve our work (whether educational or not) and become a &#x27;reflective practitioner&#x27;. Thus, the work of Schön fits with and extends to the realm of many fields of practice, key twentieth century theories of education, like experiential education and the work of many of its most important theorists, namely John Dewey, Kurt Lewin, Carl Rogers and David A. Kolb.

Schön believed that people and organizations should be flexible and incorporate their life experiences and lessons learned throughout their life. This is also known as Organizational learning (Fulmer, 1994). Organizational learning is based on two things. The first being single–loop learning and the second being double–loop learning. The former refers to the process that occurs when organizations adjust their operations to keep apace with changing market conditions. And then the latter refers to not just adjusting to the market, but also to the creation of new and better ways of achieving business goals (Fulmer, 1994).

== Personal life ==
Donald Schön was married to sculptor Nancy Schön who is particularly well known for her installation in the Boston Public Garden of the bronze duck family from McCloskey&#x27;s children&#x27;s classic &quot;Make Way for Ducklings&quot;. Nancy Schön completed a sequence of works titled &quot;The Reflective Giraffe&quot; in tribute to her late husband with a giraffe as the central icon.

<doc id="1219301" wikidata="Q1193158" url="?curid=1219301" title="Technical writing">
<text>Technical writing is a specialized form of communication used by many of today&#x27;s industrial and scientific organizations to clearly and accurately convey complex information to a user. An organization&#x27;s customers, employees, assembly workers, engineers, and scientists are some of the most common users who reference this form of content to complete a task or research a subject. Most technical writing relies on simplified grammar, supported by easy-to-understand visual communication to clearly and accurately explain complex information. Technical writing is a labor-intensive form of writing that demands accurate research of a subject and the conversion of the collected information into a written format, style, and reading level the end-user will easily understand or connect with. There are two main forms of technical writing. By far, the most common form of technical writing is procedural documentation written for the general public (e.g., standardized step-by-step guides and standard operating procedures (SOPs)). Procedural technical writing is used in all types of manufacturing to explain user operation, assembly, installation instructions, and personnel work/safety steps. Written procedures are widely used in manufacturing, software development, medical research, and many other scientific fields. The software industry has grown into one of the largest users of technical writing and relies on procedural documents to describe a program&#x27;s user operation and installation instructions.

In some applications, technical writing may be written for experts or fellow scientists within a field of work or study. In these applications, a &quot;white paper&quot; form of technical writing is used to describe a specialized topic and market a product/service or opinion/discovery to select readers. Organizations normally use the white paper form to publish technical writing as industry journal articles or academic papers. The white paper form is written to appeal to readers familiar with a technical topic. Unlike procedural technical writing, white papers often include unique industry terms and data. Sometimes called &quot;scientific technical writing&quot;, this secondary form of technical writing must show a deep knowledge of a subject and the field of work with the sole purpose of persuading readers to agree with a paper&#x27;s conclusion. This form of technical writing is often ghost written by a technical writer. A technical writer will closely collaborate with an organization&#x27;s industry expert to author these documents but is rarely credited in the published version.

In most cases, however, technical writing is used to help convey complex scientific or niche subjects to end users in &quot;laymen&#x27;s&quot; terms and includes purely factual content. Modern procedural technical writing relies on simple terms and short sentences, rather than detailed explanations with unnecessary information like personal pronouns, abstract words and unfamiliar acronyms. To achieve the right grammar; procedural docs are written from a third-person, objective perspective, with an active voice and formal tone. A more complete description of the technical writing style is provided in Strunk and White&#x27;s book The Elements of Style. Technical writing grammar is very similar to print journalism and follows the same style. Although technical writing plays an integral role in the work of engineering, health care, and science; it does not require a degree in any of these fields. Instead, the document&#x27;s author must be an expert in technical writing. An organization&#x27;s Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), internal specifications, and a formal engineering review process are relied upon to ensure accuracy. The division of labor helps bring greater focus to the two sides of an organization&#x27;s documentation, ensuring greater accuracy and quality. Most technical writers hold a liberal arts degree in a writing discipline, such as technical communication, journalism, English, technical journalism, communication, etc. Technical writing is the largest segment of the technical communication field.

Examples of fields requiring technical writing include computer hardware and software, architecture, engineering, chemistry, aeronautics, robotics, manufacturing, finance, medical, patent law, consumer electronics, biotechnology, and forestry.

==Overview==

Technical writing is most commonly performed by a trained technical writer and the content they produce is the result of a well-defined process. Technical writers follow strict guidelines so the technical information they share appears in a single, popularly used and standardized format and style (e.g., DITA, markdown format, AP Stylebook, Chicago Manual of Style). A technical writer&#x27;s primary task is to communicate technical information in the clearest and most effective manner possible. To achieve the highest level of clarity, the authors of an organization&#x27;s technical writing should be indistinguishable to the reader - with no variations in the established format, grammar, and/or style. The subject matter a technical writer communicates is often complex, so strong writing and communication skills are essential. Technical writers not only convey information through text, but they must be proficient with the latest graphics software. Technical writers use a wide range of programs to create and edit illustrations, diagrams, and CAD explosions. Proficiency in the latest graphics software is a requirement for most technical writing.

In some cases, engineers may perform the technical writing for the project they are working on, but this rarely occurs in large organizations where products must be released or revised weekly. On the business side, marketing materials or press releases are usually written by writers trained in a marketing field and/or creative writing. However, a technical writer may be relied upon to provide editing and other input on any technical content an organization may produce.

==History==

 While technical writing has only been recognized as a profession since World War II, its roots can be traced to ancient Egypt where visual communication was regularly used to explain procedures. In ancient Greek and Roman times, technical writing by the works of writers like Aristotle and Democratus are cited as some of the earliest forms of written technical writing. The earliest examples of what would be considered modern procedural technical writing date back to the early alchemists. These early scientists developed what we now know as &quot;recipes&quot;. Some of the earliest discoveries of written, procedural steps in Western Civilization date back to 1100 A.D. However, visual communication was used to describe step procedures in ancient India and China much earlier.

With the invention of the mechanical printing press, the onset of the Renaissance and the rise of the Age of Reason, documenting findings became a necessity. Inventors and scientists like Isaac Newton and Leonardo da Vinci prepared documents that chronicled their inventions and findings. While never called technical documents during their period of publication, these documents played a crucial role in developing modern forms of technical communication and writing.

The field of technical communication grew during the Industrial Revolution. There was a growing need to provide people with instructions for using the increasingly complex machines that were being invented. However, unlike the past, where skills were handed down through oral traditions, no one besides the inventors knew how to use these new devices. Writing thus became the fastest and most effective way to disseminate information, and writers who could document these devices were desired.

During the 20th century, the need for technical writing skyrocketed, and the profession became officially recognized. The events of World War I and World War II led to advances in medicine, military hardware, computer technology, and aerospace technologies. This rapid growth, coupled with the urgency of war, created an immediate need for well-designed documentation to support the use of these technologies. Technical writing was in high demand during this time, and &quot;technical writer&quot; became an official job title during World War II.

Following World War II, technological advances led to an increase in consumer goods and standards of living. During the post-war boom, public services like libraries and universities, as well as transport systems like buses and highways, saw substantial growth. The need for writers to chronicle these processes increased. It was also during this period that large business and universities started using computers. Notably, in 1949, Joseph D. Chapline authored the first computational technical document, an instruction manual for the BINAC computer.

The invention of the transistor in 1947 allowed computers to be produced more cheaply and within the purchasing range of individuals and small businesses. As the market for these &quot;personal computers&quot; grew, so did the need for writers who could explain and provide user documentation for these devices. The profession of technical writing saw further expansion during the 1970s and 1980s as consumer electronics found their way into the homes of more and more people.

In recent years, the prominence of computers in society has led to many advances in the field of digital communications, leading to changes in the tools technical writers use. Hypertext, word processors, graphics editing programs, and page laying software have made the creation of technical documents faster and easier, and technical writers of today must be proficient in these programs.

==Technical documents==
Technical writing covers many genres and writing styles, depending on the information and audience. Some examples of commonly used technical documentation include:
* API documentation: Used exclusively in the web development field to document the operation and installation instructions for an application programming interface. API coding tools (e.g., Swagger, Postman, etc.) allow technical writers to easily produce documentation in &quot;markdown &quot; for upload to specific API directories containing related API code (e.g., localization API, login API, security API). API documentation is generally automatically converted into a standardized &quot;markdown&quot; format inside of an API tool&#x27;s WYSIWYG editor. In most cases, programmers and technical writers upload code and content updates to a &quot;Git&quot; repository where a mirror image of a website is maintained. Programmers will then move the updated directories onto the live server once testing is complete. 
* Assembly Instructions (AI): Provides internal procedures for assembly-line personnel. Individual steps are written and assigned to members of an assembly team. Often the technical writer will include CAD explosions to simplify complex assemblies.
* Case study: A published report about a person, group, or situation that has been studied over time; &quot;also&quot; a situation in real life that can be looked at or studied to learn about something. In large organizations, technical writers only provide copyediting or ghostwriting services for case studies. Management-level authorship is generally required to meet national standards and codes.
*Component Maintenance Manuals (CMMs): Mainly used in aerospace, these manuals are written for comprehensive component repairs and/or modifications. Manufacturers author and then issue CMMs to customers whenever an entire component must be repaired or replaced. All component-related Service Bulletins must be incorporated and/or referenced in a CMM, along with complete component information. CMMs follow Aerospace Transport Association (ATA) formatting and ATA Spec 100/iSpec 2200 chaptering.
*Installation manuals (IM): Procedures designed to help the end-user install a product or software program in the field. 
*Inspection Report: Mainly used in large building construction and civil engineering, this report details the construction issues/defects identified by a field inspector at various project stages. The identified issues/defects are captured in a Punch list and a technical writer references this list when writing an inspection report. Issue/defect images, locations, and descriptions are normally provided for each punch list item. Sometimes remedies are also provided. 
* Knowledgebase or Help center: Online help sites that provide users with technical information about products and services. They provide an online database of technical writing content. The content may be created in SGML, XML, or XHTML. Technical writing Content management systems are used to manage and upload these websites.
*Packing list or Shipping list: Identifies the shipped parts, product safety data and manufacturer&#x27;s contact information.
*Service Bulletins (SBs): Mainly used in aerospace, these manuals are for minor repairs and modifications. Manufacturers author and then issue SBs to aircraft owners when a modification or update to an individual part, within a component, may be necessary. SBs follow Aerospace Transport Association (ATA) formatting and ATA Spec 100/iSpec 2200 chaptering.
* Specifications or Specs: Used in the construction industry to outline installation minimum standards and requirements. Specifications are normally provided to the builder by a project manager and must be signed and accepted by the builder as part of the contract. Formatting standards are set by the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI).
*Specification sheet/Spec Sheets or Datasheets: One or two-page reference sheets, designed to provide common product/service characteristics required for specific applications. Common product/service maximum and minimum characteristics may include: size and footprint, weight, connection type or interfaces, electrical requirements, speed, etc.
*Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Procedural steps military, manufacturing, medical, and industrial safety personnel reference to accomplish assembly, processing, or any other work task that must be physically completed in proper order.
*Technical marketing content: Information written exclusively for marketing purposes. This content is often used to help describe product information and specifications in marketing materials and on product/service web pages. Traditionally, creative writers specializing in marketing are hired for this work. 
*User Manuals (UM) or Operation manuals: Procedural instructions for a product or program&#x27;s operation. 
*White papers: Marketing documents, often ghostwritten by technical writers and credited to experts in a field. All white papers have a persuasive subject and present an argument supporting the author&#x27;s conclusion.

==Tools==
The following tools are used by technical writers to author and present documents:
*CAD rendering: Technical writers working in mechanical engineering often use CAD rendering tools to &quot;explode&quot; engineering-created and -approved 3D CAD designs. The goal is to visually communicate assembly/disassembly procedural steps more clearly. Specialized CAD software, designed for &quot;tech comm&quot;, is normally used.
*Collaborative software programs. Technical writing requires collaboration between multiple parties from different departments within an organization. To increase communication between parties, technical writers rely on Wiki Systems such as Confluence and shared document workspacess.
*Content Management Systems (CMSs): Modern technical writing is edited and published in a specialized CMS or CCMS designed for technical writing. The CMS is used to easily and rapidly publish large volumes of technical writing content online. The uploaded content is automatically converted into a &quot;knowledgebase&quot; help system for end-users to reference. In addition to basic WYSIWYG editing features and web uploading, a CMS also provides content management features with version management and built-in tools to manage large documentation workflows. Most CMSs used for technical writing are SGML, XML, or XHTML based.
*Desktop publishing tools or word processors: In the 1990s, most technical writing was performed with word processing tools. These early programs allowed technical writers to author, edit, design, and print documents from a computer. White paper authors generally still rely on word processing and enhanced desktop publishing tools for desktop publishing. 
*Graphics software: Images and other visual elements are used in technical writing to help communicate information in simpler terms than printed text can accomplish. In these instances, popularly used graphic software is used in technical writing to create and edit the visual elements of documents (e.g., photos, icons, diagrams, etc.) 
*Graphing software. To communicate statistical information, technical writing often includes graphs and flowcharts. Popular database software is commonly used to create basic graphs and charts. Occasionally, technical writing must provide more sophisticated graphs with interactive online features. SQL database graphing software is often used to perform this work.
*Screen capture tools: Technical writing for software procedures frequently includes screen captures. There are two types of screen capture - still frame and video. Still-frame screen captures are popularly used in the software industry. Technical writers often include a still-frame screen capture to help explain more complex procedures. Sometimes, a technical writer may simply record a short video of their desktops to show a software procedure. However, this is less common due to the many revisions software experiences.
*Specification software: Cloud-based specifying software is often used by a &quot;specifier/technical writer&quot; to select a list of common minimum standards required for a construction project. These programs are normally formatted to comply with the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) standards.

<doc id="1219302" wikidata="Q280872" url="?curid=1219302" title="Timon of Phlius">
<text>Timon of Phlius ( ; , , ; BCc. 235 BC) was an Ancient Greek philosopher from the Hellenistic period, who was the student of Pyrrho. Unlike Pyrrho, who wrote nothing, Timon wrote satirical philosophical poetry called &quot;Silloi&quot; () as well as a number of prose writings. These have been lost, but the fragments quoted in later authors allow a rough outline of his philosophy to be reconstructed.

== Life ==
The primary source for Timon&#x27;s biography is the account in Diogenes Laërtius, which claims to be taken from earlier authors such as Apollonides of Nicaea, Antigonus of Carystus, and Sotion, whose works have now been lost. According to Diogenes, Timon was born in Phlius, and was at first a dancer in the theatre, but he abandoned this profession for the study of philosophy, and, having moved to Megara, he spent some time with Stilpo, returned home to marry, and then moved to Elis with his wife, and heard Pyrrho, whose tenets he adopted. Driven again from Elis by straitened circumstances, he spent some time on the Hellespont and the Propontis, and taught at Chalcedon as a sophist with such success that he made a fortune. He then moved to Athens, where he lived until his death, with the exception of a short residence at Thebes. According to Diogenes he knew the kings Antigonus and Ptolemy II Philadelphus. The Suda also claims he was linked to several literary figures such as: Alexander Aetolus and Homerus, whom he is said to have assisted in the composition of their tragedies; and Aratus, whom he is said to have taught. He died at an age of almost ninety.

== Writings ==
According to Diogenes Laërtius, Timon composed &quot;lyric and epic poems, and tragedies and satiric dramas, and thirty comedies, and sixty tragedies and the &quot;Silloi&quot; and amatory poems.&quot; The &quot;Silloi&quot; has not survived intact, but they are mentioned and quoted by several ancient authors. It has been suggested that Pyrrhonism ultimately originated with Timon rather than Pyrrho.

=== Silloi ===
The most celebrated of his poems were the satiric compositions called &quot;Silloi&quot;, a word of somewhat uncertain etymology, but which undoubtedly describes metrical compositions, of a character at once ludicrous and sarcastic. The invention of this species of poetry is ascribed to Xenophanes of Colophon. The &quot;Silloi&quot; of Timon were in three books, in the first of which he spoke in his own person, and the other two are in the form of a dialogue between the author and Xenophanes, in which Timon proposed questions, to which Xenophanes replied at length. The subject was a sarcastic account of the tenets of all philosophers, living and dead; an unbounded field for scepticism and satire. They were in hexameter verse, and, from the way in which they are mentioned by the ancient writers, as well as from the few fragments of them which have survived, it is evident that they were admirable productions of their kind. Commentaries were written on the Silloi by Apollonides of Nicaea, and also by Sotion of Alexandria.

=== Poetry ===
The poem entitled &quot;Images&quot; () in elegiac verse, appears to have been similar in its subject to the &quot;Silloi&quot;. Diogenes Laërtius also mentions Timon&#x27;s &quot;iamboi&quot;, but perhaps the word is here merely used in the sense of satirical poems in general, without reference to the metre. According to Timon, philosophers are &quot;excessively cunning murderers of many wise saws&quot; (v. 96); the only two whom he spares are Xenophanes, &quot;the modest censor of Homer&#x27;s lies&quot; (v. 29), and Pyrrho, against whom &quot;no other mortal dare contend&quot; (v. 126).

No remains of his dramas have survived. Of his epic poems little is known, but it may be presumed that they were chiefly ludicrous or satirical poems in the epic form. It appears probable that his &quot;Funeral Banquet of Arcesilaus&quot; was also a satirical poem in epic verse. He also wrote parodies on Homer, and some lines from a scepticism-themed poem in elegiac verse have been preserved, as well as one or two fragments which cannot be with certainty assigned to any of his poems.

=== Prose works ===
He also wrote in prose, to the quantity, according to Diogenes Laërtius, of twenty thousand lines. These works were no doubt on philosophical subjects, and Diogenes mentions &quot;On Sensations&quot;, &quot;On Inquiries&quot;, and &quot;Towards Wisdom&quot;. Also among his lost works is &quot;Against the Physicists&quot;, in which he questioned the legitimacy of making hypotheses. The longest surviving quote, preserved by Eusebius in Praeparatio evangelica quoting Aristocles is from his work &quot;Python&quot; (), which contained a long account of a conversation with Pyrrho, during a journey to the Delphic oracle.:
&#x27;The things themselves are equally indifferent, and unstable, and indeterminate, and therefore neither our senses nor our opinions are either true or false. For this reason then we must not trust them, but be without opinions, and without bias, and without wavering, saying of every single thing that it no more is than is not, or both is and is not, or neither is nor is not.

<text>Lieutenant Alec George Horwood, (6 January 1914 – 20 January 1944) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Mobilised for war in 1939, Horwood was captured at Dunkirk and managed to escape via Antwerp. He was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his efforts.

Horwood was 30 years old, and a lieutenant in the 1/6th Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment (West Surrey), British Army, attached to 1st Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 18 January 1944 at Kyauchaw, British Burma (now Myanmar), Lieutenant Horwood accompanied a company into action with his forward mortar observation post. Throughout the day he was in an exposed position and under intense fire, but he came back at night with most valuable information about the enemy. On 19 January he moved forward and established another observation post, directing accurate mortar fire in support of two attacks, and also carrying out personal reconnaissance, deliberately drawing the enemy fire so that their position could be definitely located. On 20 January he volunteered to lead the attack and while doing so was mortally wounded.

His Victoria Cross is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

==Early life==
Tushingham was born on 14 March 1942 in the Garston area of Liverpool, where her father was a grocer who ran three shops. She grew up in the Hunt&#x27;s Cross district of the city. She attended the Heatherlea School in Allerton and the La Sagesse School in Grassendale (which later became part of St Julie&#x27;s Catholic High School) and studied shorthand and typing at a secretarial school. She wanted to be an actress from an early age and trained at the Shelagh Elliott-Clarke School before working as an assistant stage manager at the Liverpool Playhouse.

==Career==
Tushingham&#x27;s screen debut was in &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; (1961). In 2020, she said of the film: &quot;We shocked audiences without intending to. I only learned later that Paul and I did the first interracial kiss on screen. ... A lot of the reaction was, &#x27;People like that don’t exist&#x27; – by which they meant homosexuals, single mothers and people in mixed-race relationships. But they did.&quot; &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; was banned in several countries.

Other performances by Tushingham have included &quot;Girl with Green Eyes&quot; (1964), &quot;The Leather Boys&quot; (1964),&quot;The Knack ...and How to Get It&quot; (1965), &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965), &quot;The Trap&quot; (1966), &quot;Smashing Time&quot; (1967), &quot;The Bed Sitting Room&quot; (1969), and &quot;The &#x27;Human&#x27; Factor&quot; starring George Kennedy and John Mills (1975).

<doc id="1219314" wikidata="Q1184845" url="?curid=1219314" title="Economy of Asia">
<text>The economy of [[Asia]] comprises about 4.7 billion people (60% of the world population) living in 50 different nations. Asia is the fastest growing economic region, as well as the largest continental economy by both GDP Nominal and PPP in the world. Moreover, Asia is the site of some of the world&#x27;s longest modern economic booms.

As in all world regions, the wealth of Asia differs widely between, and within, states. This is due to its vast size, meaning a huge range of different cultures, environments, historical ties and government systems. The largest economies in Asia in terms of PPP gross domestic product (GDP) are China, India, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, Turkey, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Thailand, and Pakistan, Bangladesh and in terms of nominal gross domestic product (GDP) are Japan,Taiwan, South Korea, China, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Bangladesh, Thailand and Iran.

Total wealth (as well as overall GDP) is mainly concentrated in East Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia. Israel and Turkey are also two major economies in West Asia. Israel (entrepreneurship on diversified industries) is a developed country, while Turkey (founding member of OECD) is an advanced emerging country. Asia, with the exception of Japan (heavy industry and electrical sophistication), South Korea (heavy industry and information and communication technology), Taiwan (heavy industry and hi-tech parts manufacturing), Hong Kong (financial industry and services) and Singapore (high-tech manufacturing, biotechnology, financial and business services and tourism) in recent years, is currently undergoing rapid growth and industrialization. China (manufacturing and FDI-led growth) and India (commodities, outsourcing destination and computer software) are the two fastest growing major economies in the world.

East Asian and ASEAN countries generally rely on manufacturing and trade (and then gradually upgrade to industry and commerce), and incrementally building on high-tech industry and financial industry for growth, countries in the Middle East depend more on engineering to overcome climate difficulties for economic growth and the production of commodities, principally Sweet crude oil. Over the years, with rapid economic growth and large trade surplus with the rest of the world, Asia has accumulated over US$8.5 trillion of foreign exchange reserves – more than half of the world&#x27;s total, and adding tertiary and quaternary sectors to expand in the share of Asia&#x27;s economy.

== List of Asian countries by GDP ==
This is an alphabetically sorted list of Asian countries, with their factual and estimated gross domestic product data by the International Monetary Fund.

==History==
===Economic development===

====Ancient and medieval times====

China and India alternated in being the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1800 AD. China was a major economic power and attracted many to the east, and for many the legendary wealth and prosperity of the ancient culture of India personified Asia, attracting European commerce, exploration and colonialism. The accidental discovery of America by Columbus in search for India demonstrates this deep fascination. The Silk Road became the main east–west trading route in the Asian hitherland while the Straits of Malacca stood as a major sea route.

====Pre–1945====
Prior to World War II, most of Asia was under colonial rule. Only relatively few states managed to remain independent in the face of constant pressure exerted by European power. Such examples are China, Siam, Iran and Japan.

Japan in particular managed to develop its economy due to a reformation in the 19th century. The reformation was comprehensive and is today known as the Meiji Restoration. The Japanese economy continued to grow well into the 20th century and its economic growth created various shortages of resources essential to economic growth. As a result, the Japanese expansion began with a great part of Korea and China annexed, thus allowing the Japanese to secure strategic resources.

At the same time, Southeast Asia was prospering due to trade and the introduction of various new technologies of that time. The volume of trade continued to increase with the opening of the Suez Canal in the 1860s. Manila had its Manila galleon where in products from the Philippine islands and China were traded with Spanish America and Europe from 1571 to 1815. The Spanish colony of the Philippines was the first Asian territory to trade with the Americas, from Manila to Acapulco. The route continued overland across present-day Mexico to Veracruz on the Atlantic coast, then to Havana and Seville, forming the first global trade route. Silk, porcelain, ivory, tobacco, coconut and maize were some of the goods exported from Asia to the Americas and Europe, through the Philippines.

Singapore, founded in 1819, rose to prominence as trade between the east and the west increased at an incredible rate. The British colony of Malaya, now part of Malaysia, was the world&#x27;s largest producer of tin and rubber. The Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia, on the other hand, was known for its spices production. Both the British and the Dutch created their own trading companies to manage their trade flow in Asia. The British created the British East India Company while the Dutch formed Dutch East India Company. Both companies maintained trade monopolies of their respective colonies.

Significant de-industrialisation took place in South Asia during its first few decades of British rule in the 1800s. Extreme poverty doubled to over 50% and famines increased significantly during the colonial era.

In 1908, crude oil was first discovered in Persia, modern day Iran. Afterwards, many oil fields were discovered and it was learnt later that the Middle East possesses the world&#x27;s largest oil stocks. This made the rulers of the Arab nations very rich though the socioeconomic development in that region lagged behind.

In the early 1930s, the world underwent a global economic depression, today known as the Great Depression. Asia was not spared, and suffered the same pain as Europe and the United States (except for the Soviet Union). The volume of trade decreased dramatically all around Asia and indeed the world. With falling demand, prices of various goods starting to fall and further impoverished locals and foreigners alike. In 1931 Japan invaded Manchuria and subsequently the rest of China and south-east Asia in what eventually became the Asia-pacific leg of World War II.

====1945–1990====
Following World War II, the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Republic of India, which accounted for half of the population of Asia, adopted socialist policies to promote their domestic economy. These policies limited the economic growth of the region. They are being abandoned in India and reformed in China. In contrast, the economies of Japan and the Four Asian Tigers (South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong) were economic successes, and the only successful economies outside of the Western World. The success of these four economies led other Southeast Asian countries, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand to follow suit in opening up their economies and setting up export-oriented manufacturing bases that boosted their growth throughout the 1980s and the 1990s.

One of the most pronounced Asian economic phenomenons during this time, the Japanese post-war economic miracle, greatly impacted the rest of the world. After World War II, under central guidance from the Japanese government, the entire economy was undergoing a remarkable restructuring. Close cooperation between the government, corporations and banks facilitated easy access to much-needed capital, and large conglomerates known as &quot;keiretsu&quot; spurred horizontal and vertical integration across all industries, keeping out foreign competition. These policies, in addition to an abandonment of military spending, worked phenomenally well. Japanese corporations as a result exported and still export massive amounts of high quality products from &quot;the Land of the Rising Sun&quot;.

Another amazing economic success story is that of South Korea&#x27;s, also referred to as the Miracle on the Han River. The country was left impoverished after the Korean War, and until the early 1970s was among the world&#x27;s poorest countries (even poorer than North Korea). However, it was since able to recover with double digit annual growth rates. Many conglomerates, also known as chaebols, such as Samsung, LG Corp, Hyundai, Kia, SK Group, and more grew tremendously during this period. South Korea has now become the most wired country in the world.

Taiwan and Hong Kong experienced rapid growth up till the 1990s. Taiwan became, and still remains one of the main centers of consumer electronics R&amp;D as well as manufacturing. However, unlike in Japan and South Korea, the bulk of Taiwan&#x27;s economy is dependent on small to medium-sized businesses. Hong Kong, on the other hand, experienced rapid growth in the financial sector due to liberal market policies, with many financial institutions setting up their Asian headquarters in Hong Kong. Until 2021, Hong Kong was ranked as one of the world&#x27;s freest economies by The Heritage Foundation and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and it remains one of the world&#x27;s top five leading financial centers.

In Southeast Asia, economic development was fueled by the growth of the bamboo network. The bamboo network refers to a network of overseas Chinese businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties. The network expanded as Chinese refugees emigrated to Southeast Asia following the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949. Singapore in particular experienced very rapid economic growth after declaring independence in 1965, following a two-year federation with Malaysia. In addition to creating a conducive economic and political climate, the government developed the skills of its multi-racial workforce, and established export-oriented industries by encouraging foreign investors to set up regional operations in manufacturing. The government also played a prominent role in Singapore&#x27;s growth as a major financial and business services centre. Singapore is today one of the richest countries in the world, both in terms of GNI per capita, and GDP (PPP) per capita.

This period was also marked by military conflict. Wars driven by the Cold War, notably in Vietnam and Afghanistan, wrecked the economies of these respective nations. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1990–91, many Central Asian states were cut free and were forced to adapt to pressure for democratic and economic change. Also, several of the USSR&#x27;s allies lost valuable aid and funding.

====1991–2007====
The Chinese economy boomed under the economic measures undertaken by Deng Xiaoping, in the late 1970s, and continuing under Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao in the 1990s and 2000s. After the liberalization of the economy of India, growth in India and China increasingly shifted the center of gravity of the global economy towards Asia. By the late 2000s, China&#x27;s economic growth rate exceeded 11% while India&#x27;s growth rate increased to around 9%. One of the factors was the sheer size of the population in this region.

Meanwhile, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore emerged as the Four Asian Tigers with their GDPs growing well above 7% per year in the 1980s and the 1990s. Their economies were mainly driven by growing exports. The Philippines only began to open up its stagnated economy in the early 1990s. Vietnam&#x27;s economy began to grow in 1995, shortly after the United States and Vietnam restored economic and political ties.

Throughout the 1990s, the manufacturing ability and cheap labor markets in Asian developing nations allowed companies to establish themselves in many of the industries previously dominated by companies from developed nations. By the dawn of the 21st century, Asia became the world&#x27;s largest continental source of automobiles, machinery, audio equipment and other electronics.

At the end of 1997, Thailand was hit by currency speculators, and the value of the Baht along with its annual growth rate fell dramatically. Soon after, the 1997 Asian financial crisis spread to the ASEAN region, South Korea and other countries in Asia, resulting in great economic damage on the affected countries (but with Japan and China both largely escaping the crisis). In fact, some of the economies, most notably those of Thailand, Indonesia, and South Korea actually contracted. By 1999, most countries had already recovered from the crisis. In 2001, almost all economies in both Europe and Asia were adversely affected by the September 11 attacks, with Indonesia and Japan was hardest. Both continents quickly recovered from the attacks in United States after more than a year.

In 2004, parts of Sumatra and South Asia were severely damaged by an earthquake and the subsequent tsunami. The tsunami wreaked havoc, causing massive damage in the infrastructure of the hit areas, particularly Indonesia, and displaced millions. For a short time, GDP contracted among nations such as Indonesia and Sri Lanka, despite massive inflow of foreign aid in the aftermath of the disaster.

The economy of Japan suffered its worst post-World War II economic stagnation set in the early 1990s (which coincided with the end of Cold War), which was triggered by the latter event of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. It, however, rebounded strongly in the early 2000s due to strong growth in exports, although unable to counteract China in 2005 after China gradually surpassed it as the largest economy in Asia.

From 1995 to 2005, share of Asian foreign exchange reserves had risen from 46 percent to 67 percent. From 2002 to 2005, central banks in Asia alone accounted for three-quarters of total global currency reserve buildup.

====2008–2019====

The financial crisis of 2007–2008, triggered by the housing bubble in the United States, caused a significant decline in the GDP of the majority of the European economies. In contrast, most Asian economies experienced a temporary slowdown in their rates of economic growth, particularly Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and China, resuming their normal growth soon after.

The Arab Spring and the ensuing civil unrests since 2011 had caused economic malaise in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen, amongst the most adversely affected nations in the Middle East. At the same time, in the early 2010s, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait registered their highest GDP growths on record in the years that followed due to increased oil prices and further diversification of exports, as well as rising foreign exchange reserves.

In 2013, in a once-in-a-decade party leadership reshuffle in China (change of Hu-Wen Administration to Xi-Li Administration), the Chinese economy experienced a significant slowdown in the GDP growth, slowing down from the unprecedented decades of 9–10% annual growth to around 7–8%, which has significant effect in some developing economies, particularly in Southeast Asia and India.

The Philippines, however, managed to grow at rates at par with China in the period 2012–2013, and became the world&#x27;s fastest growing emerging market economy in the second half of the 2010s decade, overtaking Malaysia in 2017 as the fourth largest economy overall in Southeast Asia. It also recovered after getting hit by Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest storm on record to make landfall, in November 2013, which killed at least 5,200 and displacing millions more.

On September 29, 2013, China opened the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone. This free trade zone allows international trade to be conducted with fewer restrictions and lower customs duties. The zone is tax free for the first ten years to encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) with a &#x27;negative list&#x27; used to regulate in which fields foreign investments are prohibited. In 2018, India has overtaken Japan as the second largest economy in Asia and the third largest overall in the world, while China has overtaken the U.S. in terms of purchasing power parity or GDP (PPP) in the world, marking the first time in almost 2 centuries that any country outside the Americas and Europe has taken the top spot globally.

====2020–present====
The Asian economies were affected by the demographic shifts between China and India, the latter becoming the world&#x27;s most populous country in the middle of the decade, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic that started in the Hubei province of China, the country of origin of the first confirmed virus case. China&#x27;s economy experienced its first contraction in the post-Mao era as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Iran is the second worst-hit country in Asia in terms of mortality rate after India, raising concerns of an economic collapse following the U.S. expansion of sanctions against them during the Trump administration since 2019 and declining oil prices due to both the ongoing economic collapse in Venezuela and the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

Japan was also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic amidst its declining population and a stagnant economy since the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, with its postponed hosting of the Summer Olympics to 2021. South Korea, Singapore, Qatar, the Philippines, Indonesia and India were also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, further raising fears of a recession across the continent after a streak of stock market losses in the region amidst nationwide lockdown in India and continued school and work closures in China, effectively quarantining more than 2 billion people (a quarter of the world&#x27;s current human population).

Turkey was one of the few nations in the globe where activity continued to grow throughout the COVID pandemic, while Central Asian nations withstood the crisis with less economic damage. Turkey and Syria&#x27;s economies, however, faced pressure as a result of the series of earthquakes that struck both countries in 2023 alongside continuing economic sanctions against both countries. The economic contractions in nations with strong tourism-focused economies and nations with stricter pandemic containment policies, particularly in Thailand and Indonesia, were shorter but both significantly more severe during the COVID pandemic. Vietnam&#x27;s economy, however, benefited from their strong COVID pandemic response and overtook the Philippines as the third largest economy in Southeast Asia in 2022.

==== Future ====
Asia&#x27;s large economic disparities are a source of major continuing tension in the region. While global economic powers China, Japan, India, South Korea, Taiwan continue powering through, and Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have entered the path to long-term growth, regions right next to these countries are in severe need of assistance.

Given the enormous quantity of cheap labor in the region, particularly in China and India, where large workforces provide an economic advantage over other countries, the rising standard of living will eventually lead to a slow-down. Asia is also riddled with political problems that threaten not just the economies, but the general stability of the region and world. The nuclear neighbours, Pakistan and India, constantly pose a threat to each other, causing their governments to invest heavily in military spending.

Another potential global danger posed by the economy of Asia is the growing accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. The countries/regions with the largest foreign reserves are mostly in Asia – China (Mainland – $3,205 billion &amp; Hong Kong – $430.7 billion, April 2023), Japan ($1,253 billion, June 2023), Russia ($599 billion, May 2023), India ($594.8 billion, August 2023), Taiwan ($566.4 billion, July 2023), South Korea ($418.3 billion, August 2023), and Singapore ($326.7 billion, July 2023). This increasingly means that the interchangeability of the Euro, USD, and GBP are heavily influenced by Asian central banks. Some economists in the western countries see this as a negative influence, prompting their respective governments to take action.

According to the World Bank, China surpassed the United States and the European Union to become the world&#x27;s largest economy in terms of purchasing power by early 2015, followed by India. Both countries are expected to rank in the same positions between 2020 and 2040. Moreover, based on Hurun Report, for the first time in 2012 Asia surpassed North America in amount of billionaires. 951 billionaires came from Asia, whereas North America had 777 billionaires and Europe with 536 billionaires.

Businesses anticipate that it will take an average of five months for revenues to return to pre-pandemic levels and two months for the workforce to do the same. It is anticipated that Central Asian nations will be more severely impacted. Only 4% of those businesses that were permanently closed anticipate to open again, with the impacted industries&#x27; levels of heterogeneity ranging from 3% in the lodging and food services sector to 27% in the retail trade sector.

===Recent reforms in China===
Following a Third Plenum of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in 2013 China revealed plans for several sweeping social and economic reforms. The government would relax its one-child policy to allow single-child parents to have two kids. This reform was implemented as a response to the aging population of China and provide more labor. The government also reformed the hukou system, allowing the labor force to become more mobile.

The reforms will make financial loan systems more flexible encouraging increased economic involvement of private firms. Additionally, state-owned enterprises will be required to pay higher dividends to the government. The benefits of this will go to Social Security. Reform also allows farmers to own land for the first time ideally encouraging farmers to sell their land and move to cities which will boost consumerism and increase urban work force.

On April 10, 2014, China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and Securities and Futures Commission (CSRC) made a Joint Announcement about the approval for the establishment of mutual stock market access between Mainland China and Hong Kong. Under the ‘Connect Program’, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited and Shanghai Stock Exchange will establish mutual order-routing connectivity and related technical infrastructure to enable investors to invest in Chinese equities market directly. On November 17, 2014, the program officially launched with the approvals from Beijing.

The &#x27;Connect Program&#x27; is an initiative with significance to both Hong Kong and Mainland. It brings another opportunity for the growth of the Hong Kong securities market. More importantly, it provides, for the first time, a feasible, controllable and expandable channel to investors to invest in both Hong Kong and Mainland, in addition to current schemes including QDII, QFII, AND RDFII programs.

Local government&#x27;s spending plays a critical role in China&#x27;s fiscal system. Following the 1991 intergovernmental fiscal reform, the central government&#x27;s share of total fiscal revenue increase from less than 30 percent to around 50 percent in 2012. Local governments are now responsible for infrastructure investment, service delivery and social spending, which together account for about 85 percent of the total expenditure. Without a rule to guide the distribution of intergovernmental expenditure responsibilities, significant levels of risk would be associated with the spending.

China&#x27;s central administration will impose hard caps on local government borrowing in order to control financial risks from an explosive level. Statistics showed that total debt had reached $3 trillion by the middle of 2013, raising total government debt to 58 percent of GDP. Similar jump occurred in corporate debt as well, which pushed China&#x27;s overall debt-GDP ratio up to 261% from 148% in 2008. IMF warned that rapid debt run-ups could lead to financial crisis.

The new rules are expected to be combined with broader fiscal reforms aimed at bringing local government tax revenue in line with expenditure. The central government will provide more guidance to local governments in terms of how to manage and invest wisely.

As of 2017, China has the world&#x27;s second largest economy by nominal GDP at $11.8 trillion. It is the largest manufacturing economy in the world, and is the largest exporter of goods. China is also the world&#x27;s largest producer and consumer of agricultural products. China is a leading producer of rice, and is a key producer of wheat, corn, tobacco, soybeans, and potatoes, among others. Though the real estate industry in China has taken, China has had the largest real estate market in the world. China&#x27;s service sector has doubled in size, accounting for 46% of China&#x27;s total GDP. In 2011, the Chinese government instituted a five-year plan to prioritize the development of the service economy. The telecommunications sub-sector in China is one of the largest in the world, with over a billion mobile customers. Tencent, the developer of WeChat, is one of the dominating players in the telecommunication sector.

===Economic liberalisation in India===

The economic liberalisation in India refers to the ongoing economic liberalisation, initiated in 1991, of the country&#x27;s economic policies, with the goal of making the economy more market-oriented and expanding the role of private and foreign investment. Specific changes include a reduction in import tariffs, deregulation of markets, reduction of taxes, and greater foreign investment. Liberalisation has been credited by its proponents for the high economic growth recorded by the country in the 1990s and 2000s. The overall direction of liberalisation has since remained the same.

Though governments has yet to solve a variety of politically difficult issues, such as liberalising labour laws and reducing agricultural subsidies along with corruptions and fiscal deficits to sustain the growth.

The economy of India is the fifth-largest in the world by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). The country is classified as a newly industrialized country, one of the G-20 major economies, a member of BRICS and a developing economy with an average growth rate of approximately 7% over the last two decades. Maharashtra is the richest Indian state and has an annual GDP of US$430 billion, nearly equal to that of Pakistan or Portugal, and accounts for 12% of the Indian GDP followed by the states of Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Gujarat. India&#x27;s economy became the world&#x27;s fastest growing major economy from the last quarter of 2014, replacing the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

The long-term growth prospective of the Indian economy is highly positive due to its young population, corresponding low dependency ratio, healthy savings and investment rates, and increasing integration into the global economy. The Indian economy has the potential to become the world&#x27;s 3rd-largest economy by the next decade, and one of the largest economies by mid-century. And the outlook for short-term growth is also good as according to the IMF, the Indian economy is the &quot;bright spot&quot; in the global landscape. India also topped the World Bank&#x27;s growth outlook for 2015–16 for the first time with the economy having grown 7.3% in 2014–15 and expected to grow 7.5–8.3% in 2015–16.

India has the one of fastest growing service sectors in the world with annual growth rate of above 9% since 2001, which contributed to 57% of GDP in 2012–13. India has capitalized its economy based on its large educated English-speaking population to become a major exporter of IT services, BPO services, and software services with $174.7 billion worth of service exports in 2017–18. It is also the fastest-growing part of the economy. The IT industry continues to be the largest private sector employer in India. India is also the fourth largest start-up hub in the world with over 3,100 technology start-ups in 2014–15 The agricultural sector is the largest employer in India&#x27;s economy but contributes to a declining share of its GDP (17% in 2013–14). India ranks second worldwide in farm output. The Industry sector has held a constant share of its economic contribution (26% of GDP in 2013–14). The Indian automotive industry is one of the largest in the world with an annual production of 21.48 million vehicles (mostly two wheelers and cars) in FY 2013–14. India has $600 billion worth of retail market in 2015 and one of world&#x27;s fastest growing E-Commerce markets.

India&#x27;s two major stock exchanges, Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India, had a market capitalization of US$1.71 trillion and US$1.68 trillion respectively as of Feb 2015, which ranks 11th &amp; 12 largest in the world respectively according to the World Federation of Exchanges. India also home to world&#x27;s third largest Billionaires pool with 97 billionaires in 2014 and fourth largest number of ultra-high-net-worth households that have more than 100 million dollars.

India is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, the G20, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the United Nations and the New Development BRICS Bank.

Successive Indian governments have been advised to continue liberalisation. Even though, in early years India grew at slower pace than China (however, since 2013 India has been growing faster than its northern counterpart in terms of percentage of GDP growth, although China&#x27;s absolute growth still exceeds India by a large margin). The McKinsey Quarterly states that removing main obstacles &quot;would free India&#x27;s economy to grow at 10% a year&quot;.

There has been significant debate, however, around liberalisation as an inclusive economic growth strategy. Since 1992, income inequality has deepened in India with consumption among the poorest staying stable while the wealthiest generate consumption growth. As India&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate became lowest in 2012–13 over a decade, growing merely at 5.1%, more criticism of India&#x27;s economic reforms surfaced, as it apparently failed to address employment growth, nutritional values in terms of food intake in calories, and also exports growth – and thereby leading to a worsening level of current account deficit compared to the prior to the reform period. But then in FY 2013–14 the growth rebounded to 6.9% and then in 2014–15 it rose to 7.3% as a result of the reforms put by the New Government which led to the economy becoming healthy again and the current account deficit coming in control. Growth reached 7.5% in the Jan–Mar quarter of 2015 before slowing to 7.0% in Apr–Jun quarter

By 2050, India&#x27;s economy is expected to overtake the US economy, putting it behind China in the world&#x27;s largest economies. Like China, agriculture makes up a large part of the Indian economy. As the Indian economy has grown, agriculture&#x27;s contribution to GDP has steadily declined, but it still makes up a large portion of the workforce and socio-economic development. India&#x27;s industrial manufacturing GDP output was the 6th largest in the world in 2015, largely due to petroleum products and chemicals. India&#x27;s pharmaceutical industry has also grown at a compound annual growth rate of 17.5% over the last 11 years, and is one of India&#x27;s fastest-growing sub-sectors today. However, the engineering industry in India is still the largest sub-sector by GDP.
Perhaps the most exciting development in India is its incredibly fast-growing information technology and business process outsourcing sub-sector. Cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad rival the United States&#x27;s Silicon Valley in innovation and technological advancement as more and more skilled, tech-savvy students and young professionals are entering the entrepreneurial world.

India&#x27;s telecommunication network is the second largest in the world by number of telephone users (both fixed and mobile phone) with 1.183 billion subscribers as on 31 May 2019. It has one of the lowest call tariffs in the world enabled by mega telecom operators and hyper-competition among them. As on 31 July 2018, India has the world&#x27;s second-largest Internet user-base with 460.24 million broadband internet subscribers in the country.

===Abenomics in Japan===

Abenomics was a policy named after, and implemented by the former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe. Following the global economic recession, the Prime Minister hoped to boost Japanese economy with &quot;three arrows&quot;: massive fiscal stimulus, more aggressive monetary easing and structural reforms to make Japan more competitive. The stimulus package was 20.2 trillion yen ($210 billion) and the government also aimed to create 600,000 jobs in two years. In addition, this stimulus package aimed to ensure public safety with reconstruction efforts, creating a base for future business growth, and revitalizing regions by promoting tourism, revitalizing public transport, and improving infrastructure.

The Bank of Japan also aimed to raise inflation to 2% in part by buying up short-term government debts. Critics point out that hyperinflation and an unbalanced GDP/debt ration could be negative results of Abenomics. Furthermore, currency changes could aggravate international relations, especially those between China and Japan.

==Trade blocs==

===Association of Southeast Asian Nations===
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a political, economic, security, military, educational and socio-cultural organization of countries located in Southeast Asia. Founded in 1967, its aim is to foster cooperation and mutual assistance among members. The countries meet annually every November in summits. The organisation serves as a central platform for cooperation and unity in Asia, its affiliates created several trade blocs in the region, including Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world&#x27;s largest trade bloc.

The current member countries of ASEAN are Myanmar (Burma), Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam, Singapore and Indonesia. East Timor and Papua New Guinea are given observer status.

In 2005, ASEAN was instrumental in establishing the East Asia Summit (involving all ASEAN members plus China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand) which some have proposed may become in the future a trade bloc, the arrangements for which are far from certain and not yet clear.

The Asian Currency Unit (ACU) is a proposed currency unit for the ASEAN &quot;10+3&quot; economic circle. (ASEAN, the mainland of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, India, Japan, and South Korea).

=== Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ===

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is a Eurasian political, economic, and security organisation, the creation of which was announced on 15 June 2001 in Shanghai, China . Its members include China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India and Pakistan . The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Charter, formally establishing the organisation, was signed in June 2002 and entered into force on 19 September 2003. Known as the &quot;Alliance of Asia&quot;, it is the world&#x27;s forefront regional organisation in economic power and political influence, one of the world&#x27;s strongest military alliances, and the largest regional organisation in the world in terms of geographical coverage and population, covering three-fifths of the Eurasian continent and nearly half of the human population. At present, the SCO is one of the world&#x27;s most powerful and influential organisations.

===Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership===
The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership is a proposed free trade agreement (FTA) between the ten member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam) and the six states with which ASEAN has existing free trade agreements (Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand). It is the world&#x27;s largest trading bloc, covering nearly half of the global economy.

RCEP negotiations were formally launched in November 2012 at the ASEAN Summit in Cambodia. The free trade agreement is scheduled and expected to be signed in November 2020 during the ASEAN Summit and Related Summit in Vietnam. RCEP is viewed as an alternative to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a proposed trade agreement which includes several Asian and American nations but excludes China and India.

===Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement===
The Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA), formerly called the Bangkok Agreement, is the only trade agreement bringing together China and India, in addition to Bangladesh and the Republic of Korea, among others. The Secretariat of the agreement is provided by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). While the agreement covers only a limited number of products, members agreed in 2009 to implement a Trade Facilitation Framework Agreement aimed at streamlining trade procedures between members.

===Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation===
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is a group of Pacific Rim countries who meet with the purpose of improving economic and political ties. Although the initial intention was to create a free trade area covering all membership (which includes China, the United States and Australia, among others) this has failed to materialize. In 2014, APEC members committed to taking a concrete step towards greater regional economic integration by endorsing a roadmap for the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) to translate this vision into a reality. As a first step, APEC is implementing a strategic study on issues related to the realization of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific. The study will provide an analysis of potential economic and social benefits and costs, analyze the various pathways towards a Free Trade Area and identify challenges economies may face in realizing this goal.

===Gulf Cooperation Council===
The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), is a regional intergovernmental political and economic union founded in 1981. The current member states of GCC are Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.

===Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement===
The Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) is an economic agreement between the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Hong Kong SAR government (signed on 29 June 2003), and the Macau SAR government (signed on 18 October 2003), in order to promote trade and investment facilitation.

The main aims of CEPA are to eliminate tariffs and non-tariff barrier on substantially all the trade in goods between the three, and achieve liberalization of trade in services through reduction or elimination of substantially all discriminatory measures.

===Arab League===
The Arab League is an association of Arab countries in Africa and Asia. The Arab League facilitates political, economic, cultural, scientific and social programs designed to promote the interests of its member states.

===Commonwealth of Independent States===

The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is a confederation consisting of 12 of the 15 states of the former Soviet Union, both Asian and European (the exceptions being the three Baltic states). Although the CIS has few supranational powers, it is more than a purely symbolic organization and possesses coordinating powers in the realm of trade, finance, lawmaking and security. The most significant issue for the CIS is the establishment of a full-fledged free trade zone / economic union between the member states, to be launched in 2005. It has also promoted cooperation on democratisation and cross-border crime prevention.

===South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation===

The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is an association of eight countries of South Asia, namely Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and, Sri Lanka. These countries comprise an area of 5,130,746 km2 and a quarter of the world population.
SAARC encourages cooperation in agriculture, rural development, science and technology, culture, health, population control, narcotics control and anti-terrorism.
Also, a FTA called South Asia Free Trade Agreement was reached at the 12th South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit. It created a framework for the creation of a free trade zone covering 2 billion people of member states.

==Economic sectors==

===Primary sector===
Asia is by a considerable margin the largest continent in the world, and is rich in natural resources. The vast expanse of the former Soviet Union, particularly that of Russia, contains a huge variety of metals, such as gold, iron, lead, titanium, uranium, and zinc. These metals are mined, but inefficiently due to the control of a few state-sponsored giants that make participation difficult for many international mining companies. Nevertheless, profits are high due to a commodity price boom in 2003/2004 caused largely by increased demand in China. Oil is Southwest Asia&#x27;s most important natural resource. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait are rich in oil reserves and have benefited from recent oil price escalations.

Asia is home to almost five billion people, and thus has a well established tradition in agriculture. High productivity in agriculture, especially of rice, allows high population density of many countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, southern China, Cambodia, India, and Vietnam. Agriculture constitutes a high portion of land usage in warm and humid areas of Asia.

Many hillsides are farmed in a &quot;terrace&quot; method to boost arable land. The main agricultural products in Asia include rice and wheat. Opium is one of major cash crops in Central and Southeast Asia, particularly in Afghanistan, though its production is prohibited everywhere. Forestry is extensive throughout Asia, with many of the items of furniture sold in the developed nations made out of Asian timber. More than half of the forested land in Asia is in China, Indonesia, and Malaysia. China is considered a top exporter of wood products like paper and wood furniture while tropical timbers are a top export in Malaysia and Indonesia. Fishing is a major source of food, particularly in Japan and China. In Japan larger, high-quality fish are common while in China, smaller fish are being consumed at a higher rate. As the middle-class population in Southeast Asia expands, there is an increase of more expensive meats and foods becoming a part of the traditional diet.

===Secondary sector===
The manufacturing sector in Asia has traditionally been strongest in the East Asia region—particularly in China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan. The industry varies from manufacturing cheap low value goods such as toys to high-tech value added goods such as computers, CD players, games consoles, mobile phones and cars. Major Asian manufacturing companies are mostly based in either Japan, Taiwan or South Korea. They include Sony, Toyota, Toshiba, and Honda from Japan, and Asus,
Acer from Taiwan, Samsung, Hyundai, LG, and Kia from South Korea.

Many developed-nation firms from Europe, North America, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea have significant operations in developing Asia to take advantage of the abundant supply of cheap labor. One of the major employers in manufacturing in Asia is the textile industry. Much of the world&#x27;s supply of clothing and footwear now originates in Southeast Asia and South Asia, particularly in Vietnam, China, India, Thailand, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Indonesia.

===Tertiary sector===
Asia&#x27;s top ten important financial centers are located in Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, Shanghai, Beijing, Dubai, Shenzhen, Osaka, Seoul and Mumbai. India has been one of the greatest beneficiaries of the economic boom. The country has emerged as one of the world&#x27;s largest exporters of software and other information technology related services. World class Indian software giants such as Infosys, HCL, Mphasis, Mindtree, Larsen &amp; Toubro Infotech, Wipro, Rolta, Mahindra Satyam and Tata Consultancy Services have emerged as the world&#x27;s most sought after service providers.

Call centers are also becoming major employers in the Philippines due to the availability of many English speakers, and being a former American colony familiar with the American culture. Huge corporations from English speaking countries like USA, Canada, Australia and even UK invest in the Philippines because they pay for the employees and companys&#x27; miscellaneous costs are cheaper in the Philippines. According to CNBC International news last 2014, Philippines became the BPO Capital with an estimated 15.5 billion US dollars of revenue creating more than 900,000 jobs for Filipinos.

On the other hand, there are also potential huge holes for BPO business. The increase of numbers of international banks major huge corporations are trying to cut their annual company expense by changing BPO to AI (Artificial Intelligence). If the Philippine government will not think new competitive ideas to maintain the BPO business in the country, the country will lose a billion dollars of revenue by the next 10 years (according to ABS-CBN business news channel).

The rise of the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) industry has seen the rise of India and China as the other financial centers. Experts believe that the current center of financial activity is moving toward &quot;Chindia&quot; – a name used for jointly referring to China and India – with Shanghai and Mumbai becoming major financial hubs in their own right.

Other growing technological and financial hubs include Dhaka (Bangladesh), Chittagong (Bangladesh), Karachi (Pakistan), Chennai (India), New Delhi (India), Pune (India), Bangalore (India), Hyderabad (India), Shenzhen (China), Kolkata (India), Jakarta (Indonesia), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), Lahore (Pakistan), Metro Manila (Philippines), Cebu (Philippines) Iloilo City (Philippines), Santa Rosa (Philippines), Angeles City (Philippines), Naga (Philippines), Davao City (Philippines), Dumaguete (Philippines), Bangkok (Thailand) and Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam).

<text>Stilpo or Stilpon (, &quot;Stílpōn&quot;; c. 360 – c. 280 BC), in Latin sources also Stilbo or Stilbon, was a Greek philosopher of the Megarian school. He was a contemporary of Theophrastus, Diodorus Cronus, and Crates of Thebes. None of his writings survive, but he is described in the writings of others as being interested in logic and dialectic, and he argued that the universal is fundamentally separated from the individual and concrete. His ethical teachings approached that of the Cynics and Stoics. His most important followers were Pyrrho, the founder of Pyrrhonism, and Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism.

==Life==
He was a native of Megara. He probably lived after the time of Euclid of Megara, which makes it unlikely that he was a pupil of Euclid, as stated by some; and others state that he was the pupil of Thrasymachus of Corinth, or of Pasicles, the brother of Crates of Thebes. According to one account, he engaged in dialectic encounters with Diodorus Cronus at the court of Ptolemy Soter; according to another, he did not comply with the invitation of the king, to go to Alexandria. We are further told that Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, honoured him no less, spared his house at the capture of Megara, and offered him indemnity for the injury which it had received, which, however, Stilpo declined. Uniting elevated sentiment with gentleness and patience, he, as Plutarch says, was an ornament to his country and friends, and had his acquaintance sought by kings. His original propensity to wine and voluptuousness he is said to have entirely overcome; in inventive power and dialectic art to have surpassed his contemporaries, and to have inspired almost all Greece with a devotion to Megarian philosophy. A number of distinguished men too are named, whom he is said to have drawn away from Theophrastus, Aristotle of Cyrene, and others, and attached to himself; among others Crates the Cynic, and Zeno, the founder of the Stoic school. Among his followers were Menedemus and Asclepiades, the leaders of the Eretrian school of philosophy. One of his pupils, Nicarete, was also said to have been his mistress. Stilpo was praised for his political wisdom, his simple, straightforward disposition, and the equanimity with which he tolerated his rebellious daughter. Cicero relates that Stilpo&#x27;s friends had described him as &quot;vehemently addicted to wine and women&quot;, but that his philosophy eliminated his inclinations.

==Philosophy==
Of the dialogues ascribed to him, we know only the titles. He belonged to the Megarian school of philosophy, but we learn only a little about his doctrines in the few fragments and sayings of his which are quoted.

===Logic===
Stilpo argued that the genus, the universal, is not contained in the individual and concrete. &quot;Whoever speaks of any person, speaks of no-one, for he neither speaks of this one nor that. For why should it rather be of this one than that? Hence it is not of this one&quot;. One of his examples was that &quot;the vegetable is not what is here shown. For a vegetable existed ten thousand years ago, therefore this here is not a vegetable&quot;. According to Simplicius, &quot;the so-called Megarians took it as ascertained that what has different determinations is different, and that the diverse are separated one from the other, they seemed to prove that each thing is separated from itself. Hence since the musical Socrates is another determination from the wise Socrates, Socrates was separated from himself.&quot;

Thus one thing cannot be predicated of another, that is, the essence of things cannot be reached by means of . Plutarch quotes Stilpo as arguing: 

To be a horse differs from to be running. For being asked the definition of the one and of the other, we do not give the same for them both; and therefore those err who predicate the one of the other. For if good is the same with people, and to run the same with a horse, how is good affirmed also of food and medicine, and again (by Jupiter) to run of a lion and a dog? But if the predicate is different, then we do not rightly say that a person is good, and a horse runs.
Plutarch remarks here that Colotes attacked Stilpo in a bombastic manner as though he ignored common life: &quot;for how shall we live, if we cannot style a man good, nor a man a captain, but must separately name a man a man, good good, and a captain a captain.&quot; But Plutarch, in turn, replied, &quot;but what man lived any the worse for this? Is there any man who hears this said, and who does not understand it to be the speech of a man who rallies gallantly, and proposes to others this logical question to exercise their mind?&quot;

===Ethics===
Stilpo seems to have been interested in Virtue, and its self-sufficiency. He maintained that the wise man ought not only to overcome every evil, but not even to be affected by any, not even to feel it, showing, perhaps, how closely allied Stilpo was to the contemporary Cynics:

This story was an inspiration for Friedrich Klinger&#x27;s Sturm und Drang play &quot;Stilpo und seine Kinder&quot; (&quot;Stilpo and his Children&quot;) written in 1777 and published in 1780.

A one-page fragment or paraphrase from a work concerning exile is preserved in the writings of Teles of Megara, a 3rd-century BC Cynic. In this fragment, Stilpo divides the good into three parts: goods of the soul, goods of the body, and external goods. He then argues that exile does not deprive a person of any of these three goods.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Edmund Henry Lenon VC (26 August 1838 – 15 April 1893) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Lenon was 21 years old, and a lieutenant in the 67th Regiment of Foot (later The Royal Hampshire Regiment), British Army during the Second Opium War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 21 August 1860 at the Taku Forts, China, Lieutenant Lenon, with Lieutenant Robert Montresor Rogers and Private John McDougall of the 44th Foot, displayed great gallantry in the ditches and entering the North Taku Fort by an embrasure during the assault.

<text>Attiki Odos () (&quot;Attica Road&quot;) is a toll motorway system in Greece. The Attiki Odos motorways form the outer beltways of the Greater Athens metropolitan area. The total length of the motorways is . The Attiki Odos system currently consists of the following motorways:
* A6: Eleusis - Athens International Airport 
* A62 (Ymittos Ring): Katechaki Avenue - Pallini
* A621: Doukissis Plakentias Avenue - Agia Paraskevi
* A64: Koropi - Athens International Airport 
* A65 (Aigaleo Ring): Skaramagas - Ano Liosia 

==History==

Construction of the A6 motorway began in 1996. Part of it was opened, along with the Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport to which it connects, in March 2001. 
In early 2003, the A6 was opened from Kifisias Avenue Interchange to Eleftherios Venizelos Airport; the Ymittos Ring was almost paved by this time, and tunnels were already complete. On 3 September 2003, the Ymittos Ring opened. This part of the motorway runs in the northern part of the Hymettus hills and bypassed Mesogeion Avenue and linked to Kifissou Avenue and its suburbs, and the Airport along with the eastern suburbs of Athens.


In November 2003, the western part opened from the junction with A8 motorway to Kifisias Avenue. In April 2004, a small 2.5 km section opened, connecting the Ymittos Ring to the westbound direction of the A6.

==Safety==
Attiki Odos is considered one of the safest motorways in Europe. Its design used strict safety-related technical specifications, including updated hard shoulders in both directions and high quality skid-resistant asphalt pavement, dense lighting and fencing. Attiki Odos has hundreds of CCTV cameras connected to the Traffic Management Centre (TMC), which detects any incidents occurring on the motorway and informs the intervention and maintenance patrol units to provide assistance. Other sophisticated safety systems include:

* Road pavement sensors
* Carbon monoxide measurement systems installed in tunnels
* TETRA system for communication with the patrol units
* Electronic variable message signs
* Automatic tunnel ventilation systems

==Tolls==

Article 50 of the concession contract, as ratified by Law 2445/1996, requires drivers to pay a toll to use the A6, A62 (Hymettus Ring Road) and A621. The toll, paid once when entering the motorways, is the same regardless of distance travelled, but depends on the vehicle category and payment method: , the single journey toll is €1.40 for motorbikes, €2.80 for cars and vans, €7.10 for trucks and buses, and €11.30 for heavy goods vehicles.

Drivers can pay by cash, credit or debit card, e-pass or a special account card: e-pass transponders from other motorways are accepted under the Greek Interoperable Tolling System (GRITS), which was introduced in 2012 and expanded nationwide in November 2020.

==Expansion plans==
In 2001, the same year the first section of the motorway was delivered, the discussion about the extension of the motorway first opened, but the plans remained unimplemented for many years.

On October 21, 2005 a new expansion plan was proposed. 76 km of motorway was to be constructed, bringing the total length to 141 km. Extensions were to be constructed towards Rafina, Lavrio and Vouliagmeni. The Hymettus Beltway was also to be extended southwards to Vouliagmeni, in the area of Elliniko. In 2010 and 2013 alterations in the original planning were made and more extensions were proposed.

As of 2019, the expansion plan under discussion includes the extensions to Rafina and Lavrio ports, the extension of Kymis Avenue up to the A1 motorway, the extension of Hymettus western ring road to Vouliagmenis Avenue, as well as the extension of Suburban Railway to Lavrio, but these projects have not begun construction yet.

<doc id="1219340" wikidata="Q1145454" url="?curid=1219340" title="Megarian school">
<text>The Megarian school of philosophy, which flourished in the 4th century BC, was founded by Euclides of Megara, one of the pupils of Socrates. Its ethical teachings were derived from Socrates, recognizing a single good, which was apparently combined with the Eleatic doctrine of Unity. Some of Euclides&#x27; successors developed logic to such an extent that they became a separate school, known as the Dialectical school. Their work on modal logic, logical conditionals, and propositional logic played an important role in the development of logic in antiquity.

==History==
The Megarian school of philosophy was founded by Euclides of Megara, who had been one of the pupils of Socrates in the late 5th century BC. His successors, as head of the school in Megara, were said to have been Ichthyas (mid 4th century BC), and Stilpo (late 4th century BC). It is unlikely, however, that the Megarian school was a genuine institution, but more of a casual description of its geographic origin, like the Austrian school in economics. Nor did it have a unified philosophical position. It was said that the philosophers of the school were first called &quot;Megarians&quot; and that later they were called &quot;Eristics&quot;, and then &quot;Dialecticians&quot;, but it is probable that these names designated splinter groups distinct from the Megarian school. Besides Ichthyas, Euclides&#x27; most important pupils were Eubulides of Miletus and Clinomachus of Thurii. It seems to have been under Clinomachus that a separate Dialectical school was founded, which placed great emphasis on logic and dialectic, and Clinomachus was said to have been &quot;the first to write about propositions and predicates.&quot; However, Euclides himself taught logic, and his pupil, Eubulides, who was famous for employing celebrated paradoxes, was the teacher of several later dialecticians.

Via Stilpo, the Megarian school is said to have influenced the Eretrian school under Menedemus and Asclepiades; Pyrrho, the founder of Pyrrhonism; and Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism. Zeno was said to have studied under Stilpo and Diodorus Cronus, and to have disputed with Philo the Dialectician. It was perhaps the Dialecticians, Diodorus and Philo, who were the biggest influence on the development of Stoic logic, and that Zeno studied under Stilpo to learn his moral teachings, although Stilpo, too, is said to have excelled &quot;in the invention of arguments and in sophistry.&quot;

==Philosophy==
Euclides had been a pupil of Socrates, but ancient historians regarded him as a successor to the Eleatics, hence his philosophy was seen as a fusion of Eleatic and Socratic thought. Thus, the Eleatic idea of &quot;The One&quot; was identified with the Socratic &quot;Form of the Good,&quot; and the opposite of Good was regarded by Euclides as non-existent. But the emphasis of his thought is not on &quot;being&quot; but on the &quot;good&quot;, and idea that what is opposite to the good does not exist arises from the understanding of the good&#x27;s unity. This theme is typically Socratic; what matters is the moral good and the will of the good person to strive towards it. Stilpo is said to have continued the Eleatic tendency, by asserting a strict monism and denying all change and motion, and he also rejected Plato&#x27;s Theory of Forms. In ethics, Stilpo taught freedom, self-control, and self-sufficiency, approaching the teachings of the Cynics, another Socratic school.

Besides studying logical puzzles and paradoxes, the Dialecticians made two important logical innovations, by re-examining modal logic, and by starting an important debate on the nature of conditional statements. This was the work of Diodorus Cronus and Philo the Dialectician, the only two members of the Dialectical school we have detailed information about. Through their development of propositional logic, the Dialectical school played an important role in the development of logic, which was an important precursor of Stoic logic.

<doc id="1219344" wikidata="Q5217864" url="?curid=1219344" title="Daniel Laidlaw">
<text>Daniel Logan Laidlaw VC (26 July 1875 – 2 June 1950), nicknamed &quot;The Piper of Loos&quot;, was a Scottish soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, for his actions during the Battle of Loos in the First World War.

Only one other piper was awarded a VC during the First World War, the Scottish-born Canadian soldier James Cleland Richardson.

==Early life==
Laidlaw was born at Little Swinton, Berwickshire on 26 July 1875 and joined the Army in 1896. He served with the Durham Light Infantry in India where he received a certificate for his work during the Bombay plague epidemic of 1898. He then transferred as a piper to the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, and in 1912 he transferred to the reserve.

==First World War==

Laidlaw re-enlisted on 7 September 1914 and was appointed acting Corporal before leaving to serve in France in February 1915.

Laidlaw was 40 years old, and a piper in the 7th Battalion, The King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, British Army during the Battle of Loos in September 1915 when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

Citation
He received the VC from King George V at Buckingham Palace in early 1916. This was followed by two promotions, to Corporal and then Lance Sergeant by the end of 1917. In the same year, the French awarded him the Croix de Guerre, which was commonly awarded to members of allied armed forces for heroic deeds. He was demobilised in April 1919 and transferred to the Class Z Reserve later that month.

==Post war==
After the war, Laidlaw returned to live in north Northumberland. In spite of his fame, he struggled to find regular work, and had long periods of unemployment. Just before the Second World War he became a sub-postmaster, and during the war served as a head ARP warden. He died at Shoresdean, near Berwick-upon-Tweed, on 2 June 1950, and was buried in St Cuthbert&#x27;s churchyard, Norham, Northumberland.

==Public reception==
Dubbed the &quot;Piper of Loos&quot; in the Scottish press, Laidlaw received more publicity than most contemporary VC recipients, both during and after the war. He played the pipes at various wartime concerts, while his portrait appeared in paintings, book illustrations and advertisements. Post-war, he piped at a number of formal events, including the interment of the Unknown Warrior in 1920; at the head of several marches to the Cenotaph, notably in 1932 when he marched beside pipe-sergeant George Findlater VC; and at the London victory parade of June 1945. He appeared as himself in two films about the First World War, The Guns of Loos (1929) and Forgotten Men (1933). Among other public appearances, he piped for the Scottish Country Dancing Club in London, and accompanied a troupe of highland dancers on a tour of Norway in 1934.

==Further information==
In April 1906 he married Georgina Mary Harvie at the Baptist Church, Alnwick, Northumberland. They had three sons and three daughters. 

His grandson, Victor, donated his Victoria Cross and other medals to National Museum of Scotland on Chambers Street, Edinburgh, where they are on display.

<text>Béla Markó (born 8 September 1951) is a Romanian politician and writer of Hungarian ethnicity. He is married with three children. He is reportedly, a follower of reformed Christianity. The former leader of the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR), he was also the Deputy Prime Minister of Romania in the second cabinet of Emil Boc from 2009 to 2012; he had also been Minister of State in the first cabinet of Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu between 2004 and 2007, in charge of culture, education and research and European integration.

Markó has been a senator since 1990, and was the leader of the UDMR from 1993 to 2011. He competed in the 2004 Romanian presidential election, and ranked fourth with 5.1% of the votes.

== Political activity ==
In December 1989, Béla Markó became a founding member and vice-president of the Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania, from Mureș, being elected as a member of the HDUR&#x27;s Presidium (1990–1991). Although he believed at the time that this was a temporary commitment and that he left the writing only for a short time, he continued to be proactive in political activity.

After the parliamentary elections of May 1990, he was elected as Senator of Mureș, from the HDUR&#x27;s lists, being re-elected in all subsequent legislatures (formed after the elections of 1992, 1996, 2000, and 2004). In the first term, he was a member of the Senate Culture and Education Commissions, a member of the Steering Committee of the Romanian Group of the Interparliamentary Union (1990–1992) and the president of the HDUR group in the Senate (1991–1992). In the course of his parliamentary activity, Béla Markó was a member of the parliamentary groups of friendship with the Italian Republic and the French-Senate.

As a senator, he has been a member of the Committees for Foreign Affairs and Culture of the Romanian Senate (1992–1996), a member of the Committee on Foreign Policy and of the Committee on Education, Science and Youth (1996–2000), a member of the Committee on Foreign Policy (2000–2004) and the member of the Committee on Foreign Policy (2004-2008) and the member of the Committee on Culture, Art and Mass Media (December 2004–March 2005).

In 1993, Béla Markó was elected president of the Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania (DAHR), being re-elected to this position in the elections of 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007.

Béla Markó was the HDUR&#x27;s candidate for the Romanian presidential elections on November 28, 2004, obtaining 533,446 of votes, representing 5.10% of the number of valid votes (took the 4th position).

On December 29, 2004, Béla Markó was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister in the Tăriceanu Government and at the same time Minister of State without portfolio, to coordinate the activities in the field of European culture, education and integration. He resigned on July 3, 2007, in order to be able to coordinate the HDUR&#x27;s election campaign (European Parliamentary elections of November 2007, the local elections of June 2008 and the parliamentary elections of autumn 2008), but also as a result of the referendum for Trăian Băsescu resignation. &quot;I resigned not to lose the elections … I wanted to prevent a failure&quot;, he explained. Among his achievements as a minister of state, he listed several &quot;extremely important things for the country&quot;: joining the EU, allocating higher education amounts to the budget as it was before, as well as relaunching education infrastructure. In the 2008–2012 legislature, Béla Markó was a member of the parliamentary groups of friendship with the Russian Federation and the French-Senate. In the 2008–2012 legislature, Béla Markó initiated 5 legislative proposals out of which 4 were enacted laws. On December 23, 2009, he was re-elected as Deputy Prime Minister in the Boc Cabinets. He continued his mandate after Boc&#x27;s resignation, on February 6, 2012, in the Ungureanu cabinet. It was replaced on May 7, 2012, following the dismissal by censure motion of the cabinet. At the parliamentary elections of 2012, he obtained a new term of senator in the electoral district no. 28 from Mureș, on the uninominal college 2.

<text>The Battle of Toulouse (721) was a victory of an Aquitanian Christian army led by Odo the Great, Duke of Aquitaine over an Umayyad Muslim army besieging the city of Toulouse, led by al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani, the Umayyad &quot;wāli&quot; (governor-general) of al-Andalus. The decisive Aquitanian victory checked the spread of Umayyad control westward from Narbonne into Aquitaine.

==Battle==
Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani, the Umayyad &quot;wāli&quot; (governor-general) of al-Andalus, built up an army of Arabs and Berbers from Umayyad territories in order to conquer Aquitaine, a large duchy in the southwest of modern-day France, formally under Frankish sovereignty, but in practice almost independent in the hands of the Duke of Aquitaine. British archaeologist Ian Meadows states that al-Samh&#x27;s aim was to take the Garonne River valley, capture the city of Toulouse, and open up a vast territory stretching all the way to the Atlantic Sea and back south through Muslim-ruled Iberia to the Mediterranean Sea and North Africa.

Al-Samh&#x27;s army included siege engines, infantry, a few horsemen and a number of mercenaries, as well as Basque slingers. He besieged the city of Toulouse, then Aquitaine&#x27;s most important city. Duke Odo the Great, otherwise known as &quot;Eudes&quot;, was not in the city when it was besieged, having left to find help. He asked assistance from the Merovingian Maire du Palais Charles Martel, who in turn preferred to wait and see rather than help his southern rival.

Odo returned three months later with Aquitanian, Gascon, and Frankish troops, and just as the city was about to surrender, attacked the Umayyad invasion force on June 9. The exact origin of the Frankish troops is not certain, but they may have hailed from southern Aquitanian areas, e.g., in the Lower Rhone, where naturalized Franks had settled down decades or centuries before. After Odo originally fled, the Umayyads became overconfident, and instead of maintaining strong outer defenses around their siege camp, and continuously scouting, did neither. Thus, when Odo returned, he was able to launch an assault on the siege force, both from behind and from forces within the walls. The surprised Umayyads scattered with the first attack. Odo&#x27;s forces cut down those that were resting or fled without weapons or armour.

Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani managed to get away with a fraction of his forces, but died shortly thereafter, leaving Anbasa ibn Suhaym Al-Kalbi (721–725) as governor. The number of soldiers who engaged in the battle has been grossly inflated to about 300,000 on Odo&#x27;s side (Al-Maqqari), and a death-toll of 375,000 on the assaulting Umayyad troops. The figures give a rough idea of the scale of the confrontation. In a letter to Pope Gregory II, Odo said he had killed 375,000 Saracens in one day and lost 1,500 of his men.

A miracle is associated with the battle according to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;: Pope Gregory II had sent Odo &quot;three blessed sponges/baskets of bread&quot; in 720, which the Duke kept until just before the engagement. He distributed small portions of these to be eaten by his troops at Toulouse, and after the battle, it was reported that no one who had eaten the bread had been killed or wounded.

==Aftermath==
Arab historians agree that the Battle of Toulouse was a total disaster for the Arabs. After the defeat, some Umayyad officials and soldiers managed to escape, among them Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi. However, the clash halted indefinitely the Umayyad expansion northwards. Al-Andalus was at the time re-organising into a new post-Gothic order. The Umayyads kept the military initiative raiding several times the south of Gaul (up to Autun in 725), but avoided new serious campaigns into the north-west.

Odo&#x27;s victory earned him widespread renown in Aquitaine and recognition abroad. He was hailed as champion of Christianity by the Pope in Rome, and was presented with gifts. Charles steered clear of the political and military developments in the south of Gaul for another 10 years, until 732.

Some authors have called the fateful engagement the &quot;Balat Al Shuhada&quot; of Toulouse; others attach that name exclusively to the Battle of Poitiers (Tours). According to Meadows, it would be still remembered in memorials by Al-Andalus Muslims for the following 450 years, as opposed to the Battle of Poitiers, held as a battle smaller in scale.

==Discussion==
Some historians believe that the Battle of Toulouse halted the Muslim conquest of Europe even more than the later—and more celebrated—Battle of Tours (10 October 732, between Tours and Poitiers), but this is highly problematic: for even had the Arabs won at Toulouse, they still would have had to conquer the Franks to retain control of the region. 

However, nearly all historians agree that the Christian victory at Toulouse was important in a macrohistorical sense in that it gave Charles Martel badly needed time to strengthen his grip on power and build the veteran army which stood him in such good stead eleven years later at Tours. The eleven years between Toulouse and Tours without question gave him time to fully secure power, inspire the loyalty of his troops, and, most importantly, drill the core of veterans who stood so stoutly in 732.

However, others (e.g. Archibald Lewis, Roger Collins, etc.) hold that Umayyad attacks were raids or razzias, like the one reaching as far north as Autun in 725, and not real attempts to conquer Francia. 

While Odo faded into history after his 732 defeat at Battle of the River Garonne, near current days Bordeaux, Martel was hailed in later times as the &quot;savior of Europe&quot; by many Western and European authors and academic figures.

<text>Gaudibert is a lunar impact crater that lies along the northeast edge of Mare Nectaris in the eastern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. Just to the east is the Montes Pyrenaeus mountain chain, and to the northeast beyond the mountains is the crater Gutenberg. Northwest of Gaudibert is the crater pair Isidorus and Capella.

This crater has a low rim and an irregular interior that makes it a relatively inconspicuous formation. The rim is roughly circular but somewhat uneven in outline. On the inner floor are several ridges that divide up the interior into several minor peaks and valleys. The floor is also fractured. A pair of bowl-shaped craters are attached to the southern edge of the crater rim.

To the south of Gaudibert is a formation of several ghost craters, of which the most notable are Gaudibert A and Gaudibert B. These are best viewed when the sun is at a low angle, resulting in greater contrast and shadows.

The crater was named after French astronomer Casimir Marie Gaudibert by the IAU in 1935.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Gaudibert.

<text>The Colchis Lowland (, ) is a geographical area in Georgia, which consists of a coastal lowland plain of the eastern Black Sea. Named after Colchis, an ancient Greek name for this region, the lowland is nearly triangular, squeezed between the Greater Caucasus and Lesser Caucasus mountains, with its base leaning on the Black Sea and apex directed to the east, reaching the environs of the town of Zestaponi. To the northwest and southwest, respectively, the plain continues as narrow coastal strips in Abkhazia and Adjara. 

The Colchis Lowland is formed by the combined alluvial plains of the Rioni, Inguri, Khobi, Supsa, Chorokhi, and other rivers, which have sources in the Greater and Lesser Caucasus ranges. The lowland has an average elevation of 100 to 150 m, but some places are located below sea level. It is located in a damp subtropical climate zone, with an annual precipitation of about 1,500 mm. The surface of the lowland was formed in Late Pleistocene and Holocene. It has significantly been modified by human activity. The region&#x27;s subtropical conditions have supported agriculture since ancient times; citrus fruits, tea, and tung are grown, mostly on the surrounding foothills. The wetter lowlands in the centre of the plain collect cold air, and frosts preclude the cultivation of more sensitive crops. Parts of the Colchis Lowland are included in a series of national parks and protected areas. Because of the region&#x27;s biodiversity and range of ecosystems (including deciduous rainforests and wetlands, percolation bogs, and other mire types), part of the Colchis Lowland were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2021, as the Colchic Rainforests and Wetlands site.

<text>Somanahalli Mallaiah Krishna (1 May 1932 – 10 December 2024) was an Indian politician who served as Minister of External Affairs of India from 2009 to October 2012. He was the 10th Chief Minister of Karnataka from 1999 to 2004 and the 19th Governor of Maharashtra from 2004 to 2008. S. M. Krishna served as the Speaker of the Karnataka Vidhana Soudha from December 1989 to January 1993. He was also a Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha member from 1971 to 2014. He is widely credited with putting Bengaluru on the world map by building the foundation for it to become the IT Hub that it is today during his tenure as Chief Minister. In 2023, Krishna was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian award of India.

==Early life and education==
S. M. Krishna was the son of S. C. Mallaiah, born on 1 May 1932 to a Vokkaliga family in a village named Somanahalli in the Maddur Taluk of Mandya district, Karnataka. He finished his High School in Sri Ramakrishna Vidyashala, Mysore. He completed his Bachelor of Arts from Maharaja&#x27;s College, Mysore. He obtained a law degree from University Law College, which was then known as Government Law College in Bangalore. Krishna studied in the United States, graduating with Masters of Laws degree from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas and The George Washington University Law School in Washington D.C, where he was a Fulbright Scholar.

==Political career==
Soon after his return to India, Krishna started his electoral political career in the year 1962 by winning the Maddur Vidhana Sabha seat. Krishna ran as an independent, defeating K V Shankar Gowda, the prominent politician from the Indian National Congress for whom Jawaharlal Nehru had campaigned.

He then joined the Praja Socialist Party but lost his race for Maddur in the 1967 elections to Congress&#x27; M M Gowda. He won the by-poll for Mandya (Lok Sabha constituency) in 1968 when the sitting MP died, defeating the Congress nominee.

In 1968, he was influential in reconciling members of the Indian National Congress and the Praja Socialist Party. He served three terms as an MP from the Mandya constituency of Karnataka, starting from the 1968 by-poll as a PSP candidate. His following terms were as a Congressman, winning elections in 1971 and 1980. Mandya remained a Congress stronghold, represented in Lok Sabha later by his political proteges such as Ambareesh and Divya Spandana (also known as Ramya). S M Krishna resigned from Lok Sabha in 1972, and became a member of the Karnataka Legislative Council and was appointed a minister by Devaraj Urs.

After he went back to Lok Sabha in 1980, he served as a minister under Indira Gandhi between 1983–84. He lost his run for the Mandya Lok Sabha seat in the 1984 elections. He was reelected to the Karnataka legislative assembly in 1985. He served as Speaker of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly between 18 December 1989 and 20 January 1993. He served as Deputy Chief Minister of Karnataka from 1993 to 1994. Later, he became a member of the Rajya Sabha between April 1996 and 1999.

In 1999, as Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president, he led his party to victory in the 1999 assembly polls and took over as Chief Minister of Karnataka, a post he held until being defeated in 2004 Karnataka Legislative Assembly elections. He was also instrumental in creating power reforms with the ESCOMS and digitization of land records (BHOOMI) and many other citizen-friendly initiatives. He encouraged private-public participation and was a sponsor of the Bangalore Advance Task Force.

Krishna was appointed Governor of Maharashtra on 6 December 2004. Krishna resigned as Governor of Maharashtra on 5 March 2008. It was reported that this was due to his intention to return to active politics in Karnataka. President Pratibha Patil accepted his resignation on 6 March.
Krishna entered the Rajya Sabha and subsequently took the oath of office as Union Cabinet Minister of External Affairs in the Council of Ministers under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on 22 May 2009. In his tenure as the external affairs minister, he visited a number of countries including Tajikistan in 2012 to strengthen economic and energy ties. Krishna resigned as External Affairs Minister on 26 October 2012 indicating a return to Karnataka state politics.

Krishna resigned as a member of INC on 29 January 2017, stating that the party was in a &quot;state of confusion&quot; on whether it needed mass leaders or not. He also complained of having been sidelined by the party and that the party was &quot;dependent on managers and not time-tested people like himself&quot;. After speculation concerning his joining the Bharatiya Janata Party, he formally joined the party in March 2017. He announced his retirement from politics in January 2023, citing age-related issues.

==Positions held==


==Personal life==
Krishna was married to Prema. They had two daughters. His daughter Malavika Krishna was married to the Late V. G. Siddhartha, a businessman and the founder of Cafe Coffee Day. He had a younger brother, Shankar (died 2019), who was a member of the Karnataka Legislative Council.

At the dusk of his political life, he released his biography, &quot;Smritivahini&quot;, in the presence of many dignitaries. He penned many interesting incidents, including Veerappan Kidnapping of Rajkumar during his tenure as the chief minister. He also quoted that the former prime minister of India and national president of Janata Dal (Secular) H. D. Devegowda had strong plans of joining Indian National Congress twice during the period of National emergency.

Krishna died from a long illness at his residence in Bengaluru, on 10 December 2024, at the age of 92. He was cremated with state honours complete with gun salute at his ancestral village of Somanahalli in Maddur taluk of Mandya district on 11 December. The Karnataka Government announced a three day mourning period.

<text>Group Captain Frank Howard Kirby, (12 November 1871 – 8 July 1956) was a British military officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==
===British Army===
Kirby was 28 years old, and a corporal in the Corps of Royal Engineers, British Army during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:
The award was presented to him by the Duke of York (later King George V) in Cape Town in August 1901, during the visit of the Prince and his wife to that city as part of their British Empire tour. Kirby also received the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) for his service in South Africa. The medal was presented to him in March 1902 after his return to the United Kingdom, in the presence of one thousand Royal Engineers on parade.

Kirby was appointed a regimental sergeant major at Chatham in 1906. Five years later, in April 1911, he was gazetted with an honorary commission as a lieutenant, appointed a quartermaster, and posted to the newly formed Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers. He attended the first course at the Central Flying School in 1912.

===From the Flying Corps to the Air Force===

Kirby subsequently transferred to the Royal Flying Corps (which had absorbed the Air Battalion) and he was commissioned as an Equipment Officer. Kirby was appointed the Stores Officer at the Central Flying School. Kirby served at No 1 Aircraft Depot at Saint-Omer in early 1916, and with No 3 Army Aircraft Park in July 1916. In December 1916 he became commanding officer of No 1 Stores Depot at Kidbrooke in south London.

Kirby went on to achieve the rank of lieutenant colonel. Kirby remained in the Royal Air Force after the end of the First World War and was granted a permanent commission as a wing commander in 1920. Kirby was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in July 1926. He eventually retired, with permission to retain the rank of group captain, in December 1926.

Kirby&#x27;s Victoria Cross is on display at the Lord Ashcroft VC Gallery in the Imperial War Museum in London. He is buried in Streatham Park Cemetery.

There is an Oxfordshire Blue Plaque on Wavertree, 18 Lower High Street, Thame, the house where he was born. He is also included in the First World War archive of Alleyn&#x27;s School in Dulwich where Kirby was a pupil from 1882 to 1884

<text>Colonel William Hope VC (12 April 1834 – 17 December 1909) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

William Hope was the son of the Right Honourable John Hope, Lord Chief Justice Clerk of Scotland, and his wife Jessie Irving, and was born in Edinburgh on 12 April 1834. He was educated privately and at Trinity College, Cambridge.

William Hope married Margaret Jane, daughter of Robert Cunningham Cunninghame Graham of Gartmore and aunt of the author, politician and traveller Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham, by whom she had six children, the eldest of which was a son, Adrian, whose granddaughter, Lauretta Hope-Nicholson, was the second wife of the artist Jean Hugo.

==VC action==
He was 21 years old, and a lieutenant in the 7th Regiment of Foot (later The Royal Fusiliers), British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 18 June 1855 at Sebastopol, Crimean Peninsula, Lieutenant Hope went to the assistance of the adjutant, who was lying outside the trenches badly wounded. Having found that it was impossible to move him, even with the help of four men, he ran back across the open ground under very heavy fire from the enemy batteries, and procured a stretcher to bring the wounded officer in.

He later achieved the rank of colonel. Hope invented a form of shrapnel shell for rifled guns, and later became an enthusiastic supporter of the volunteer movement, rising to the command of the 1st City of London Artillery Volunteers.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Fusiliers Museum in the Tower of London, England.

==Business==
Following his military career, Hope was involved in a number of business ventures. In 1862 he was described as General Manager of the International Financial Society, and was also Director of the Lands Improvement Company, through which he had been involved in reclamation and irrigation work in Spain and Majorca. With William Napier, he proposed a scheme to convey sewage from the northern outfall of Joseph Bazalgette&#x27;s London sewer system some across Essex to reclaim of land from Dengie Flats, and a similar area from Maplin Sands, off the shore of Foulness Island. The estimated cost of the project was £2.1 million, and although work started in 1865, a crisis in the banking system, when the Overend Gurney bank failed, made it difficult to obtain finance, and the scheme foundered.

<text>Counter admiral is a rank found in many navies of the world, but no longer used in English-speaking countries, where the equivalent rank is rear admiral. The term derives from the French . Depending on the country, it is either a one-star or two-star rank.

In modern navies that use it, counter admiral is generally, although not always, the lowest flag officer rank. In the German Navy, for instance, ranks below ; in the Royal Canadian Navy, (rear admiral in English) ranks above .

==French speaking countries==

In France and other French speaking countries&#x27; navies the rank of is used as the lowest flag officer. It is usually placed above ship-of-the-line captain () and below vice admiral ().

==Germany==

 is a NATO OF-7 (two-star rank) of the (German Navy), equivalent to the (&quot;major general&quot;) in the German Army and the German Air Force.

==Nordic countries==

The rank of counter admiral is used in all the Nordic countries.
===Denmark and Norway===
In 1771, the rank of was removed and replaced with the rank of counter admiral (Danish/Norwegian: ).

=== Finland===
Counter admiral is the more direct translation of Finnish , a two-star rank used in the Finnish Navy and the Finnish Border Guard. However, it is usually translated as rear admiral in international use.

===Sweden===
==Portuguese speaking countries==
In the navies of Brazil and Angola the rank of &quot;contra-almirante&quot; is the lowest of the flag officer ranks. In the navies of Portugal and Mozambique the rank of &quot;contra-almirante&quot; is the second lowest, above that of &quot;comodoro&quot; (commodore).

Until the end of the 19th century, the present rank of &quot;contra-almirante&quot; was named &quot;chefe de esquadra&quot; (chief of squadron), both in the Portuguese and in the Brazilian navies.

==Russia and other former communist countries==
&quot;Kontr-admiral&quot; was the lowest flag officer rank of the Soviet Navy and is the lowest flag rank of the Russian Navy, similar to an OF-6 officer.

==NATO code==
While the rank of counter admiral is used in a number of NATO countries, it is ranked differently depending on the country.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel John Henry Stephen Dimmer (9 October 1883 – 21 March 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
Born on 9 October 1883 in Lambeth, his family moved to Wimbledon where Dimmer was educated at Rutlish School, Merton Park. In July 1902 he enlisted into the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC), and was soon promoted to Corporal, then to Lance Sergeant. In 1906 he passed an officer&#x27;s examination and was commissioned second lieutenant in the KRRC. Lack of financial backing meant he could not afford to serve with the regiment, and in 1908 he was attached to the West Africa Regiment as a local Lieutenant.

Dimmer was on home leave when the First World War broke out, and he went to France with the 2nd KRRC in August 1914. 

===Citation===
A 31 year old lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, The King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps, Dimmer was awarded the VC for his actions on 12 November 1914 at Klein Zillebeke, Belgium.

Dimmer was also mentioned in dispatches in October 1914, and was one of the first recipients of the Military Cross, in January 1915.

===Later war service===
After recovering from his wounds, Dimmer served as a brigade major from January 1915, and in April 1915 was promoted captain. After service in Salonika, Greece, he was seconded to the Machine Gun Corps from May to November 1916. He was promoted to temporary Lieutenant Colonel in January 1918, and was killed in action at Marteville, France on 21 March 1918 while commanding the 2nd/4th battalion of the Royal Berkshire Regiment. His body was missing until 1920, when it was buried at Vadencourt British Cemetery in Maissemy.

===Marriage===
On 19 January 1918, two months before his death, Dimmer married Gladys Dora May Parker in the Moseley Parish Church. The couple had no children. After Dimmer&#x27;s death, his wife remarried to Leopold Canning, a Royal Flying Corps lieutenant and future president of the British Fascisti.

<text>John Lucas (1826 – 4 March 1892) was a British Army soldier and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the first member of the 40th Foot to be awarded the VC.

==Early life==
Lucas as born in Clashganny, Bagenalstown, County Carlow in 1826.

==Victoria Cross==
Colour Sergeant John Lucas, 40th (2nd Somersetshire) Regiment of Foot (later part of the South Lancashire Regiment – The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Volunteers), was approximately 35 years old:
The action was part of the First Taranaki War during the New Zealand Wars. This campaign started over a disputed land sale at Waitara. In December 1860 British forces under Major General Thomas Simson Pratt carried out sapping operations against a major Māori defensive line called Te Arei (&quot;The barrier&quot;) on the west side of the Waitara River and inland from Waitara, which was barring the way to the historic hill pā of Pukewairangi. The 18 March was the last day before a truce was declared.
==Later career and life==
By then promoted to sergeant-major, Lucas received his Victoria Cross from Lieutenant-General Duncan Cameron at Ellerslie Racecourse in Auckland, on 2 October 1862.

He died in Dublin on 29 February 1892 and is buried there in St. James churchyard.

<doc id="1219391" wikidata="Q2666550" url="?curid=1219391" title="Lampworking">
<text>Lampworking is a type of glasswork in which a torch or lamp is used to melt the glass. Once in a molten state, the glass is formed by blowing and shaping with tools and hand movements. It is also known as flameworking or torchworking, as the modern practice no longer uses oil-fueled lamps. Although lack of a precise definition for lampworking makes it difficult to determine when this technique was first developed, the earliest verifiable lampworked glass is probably a collection of beads thought to date to the fifth century BCE. Lampworking became widely practiced in Murano, Italy in the 14th century. As early as the 17th century, itinerant glassworkers demonstrated lampworking to the public. In the mid-19th century lampwork technique was extended to the production of paperweights, primarily in France, where it became a popular art form, still collected today. Lampworking differs from glassblowing in that glassblowing uses a furnace as the primary heat source, although torches are also used.

Early lampworking was done in the flame of an oil lamp, with the artist blowing air into the flame through a pipe or using foot-powered bellows. Most artists today use torches that burn either propane or natural gas, or in some countries butane, for the fuel gas, mixed with either air or pure oxygen as the oxidizer. Many hobbyists use MAPP gas in portable canisters for fuel and some use oxygen concentrators as a source of continuous oxygen.

Lampworking is used to create artwork, including beads, figurines, marbles, small vessels, sculptures, Christmas tree ornaments, and much more. It is also used to create scientific instruments as well as glass models of animal and botanical subjects.

== Glass selection ==

Lampworking can be done with many types of glass, but the most common are soda-lime glass and lead glass, both called &quot;soft glass&quot;, and borosilicate glass, often called &quot;hard glass&quot;. Leaded glass tubing was commonly used in the manufacture of neon signs, and many US lampworkers used it in making blown work. Some colored glass tubing that was also used in the neon industry was used to make small colored blown work, and colored glass rod, of compatible lead and soda-lime glasses, was used to ornament both clear and colored tubing. The use of soft glass tubing has been fading, owing partly to environmental concerns and health risks but mainly to the adoption of borosilicate glass by most lampworkers, especially since the introduction of colored glasses compatible with clear borosilicate.

Soft glass is sometimes useful because it melts at lower temperatures, but it does not react well to rapid temperature changes as borosilicate glass does. Soft glass expands and contracts much more than hard glass when heated/cooled, and must be kept at an even temperature while being worked, especially if the piece being made has sections of varying thickness. If thin areas cool below the &quot;stress point&quot;, shrinking can cause a crack. Hard glass, or borosilicate, shrinks much less, so is more forgiving. Borosilicate is just like regular silicate glass (SiO2), but it has a more flexible molecular structure from being doped with boron.

Glasses to be fused together must be selected for compatibility with each other, both chemically (more of a concern with soft glass than borosilicate) and in terms of coefficient of thermal expansion (COE) [CTE is also used for Coefficient of Thermal Expansion.] Glasses with incompatible COE, mixed together, can create powerful stresses within a finished piece as it cools, cracking or violently shattering the piece. Chemically, some colors can react with each other when melted together. This may cause desirable effects in coloration, metallic sheen, or an aesthetically pleasing &quot;web effect&quot;. It also can cause undesirable effects such as unattractive discoloration, bubbling, or devitrification.

Borosilicate glass is considered more forgiving to work with, as its lower COE makes it less apt to crack during flameworking than soda-lime glass or lead glass. However, it has a narrower working temperature range than the soft glasses, has fewer available colors, and is considerably more expensive. Also, its working range is at higher temperatures than the soft glasses, requiring the use of oxygen/gas flames instead of air/gas. In addition to producing a hotter flame, the use of pure oxygen allows more control over the flame&#x27;s oxidizing or reducing properties, which is necessary because some coloring chemicals in borosilicate glass react with any remaining oxygen in the flame either to produce the desired final color or to discolor if extra oxygen is present.

Lead glass has the broadest working range of the three glasses, and holds its heat better when it is out of the flame. This gives one more time to adjust one&#x27;s work when blowing hollow forms. It is also less likely to crack while being worked in making pieces of variable thickness than is soda-lime glass.

== Types of glass ==
=== Raw materials ===
Glass is available in a wide range of shapes, sizes, and colors for the lampworker. Most lampworkers use glass produced by commercial manufactures in the shape of rod, tube, sheet or frit. Glass rods are manufactured in various sizes, as small as 1 mm and as large as 50 mm or more. Glass rod is also made in different shapes like: square, triangle or half round rod. Glass tubes are also offered in a range of diameters, colors, and profiles like: scalloped, twisted or lined tubing. Crushed glass particles that have been sifted to specific sizes are known as frit or power. Sheet glass is produced in varying thickness and can be cut and shaped before being worked in the flame. The glass industry has seen steady growth in the past few decades that continues to expand the types and forms of glass available to lampworkers.

=== Soda lime glass ===

The most popular glass for lampworking is soda-lime glass, which is available pre-colored. Soda-lime glass is the traditional mix used in blown furnace glass, and lampworking glass rods were originally hand-drawn from the furnace and allowed to cool for use by lampworkers. Today soda-lime, or &quot;soft&quot; glass is manufactured globally, including Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, China and America.

=== Lead ===
In addition to soda lime glass, lampworkers can use lead glass. Lead glasses are distinguished by their lower viscosity, heavier weight, and somewhat greater tolerance for COE mismatches.

=== Borosilicate ===
Lampworkers often use borosilicate glass, a very hard glass requiring greater heat. Borosilicate originated as laboratory glass, but it has recently become available in color to the studio artist from a number of companies. At one time, soft (soda lime and lead) and hard (borosilicate) glasses had distinctly different looking palettes, but demand by soft-glass artists for the silver strike colors, and the development of the bright, cadmium based &#x27;crayon colors&#x27; by Glass Alchemy in the boro line, has diminished the distinctions between them.

=== Quartz ===
Lampworkers can also work with fused quartz tube and rod. A hydrogen and oxygen torch is used to work quartz as requires higher temperatures than other types of glass. Quartz is resistant to extreme temperature variations and chemical corrosion, making it especially useful in scientific applications. Quartz has recently gained popularity in artistic glass work but is only available a few limited colors.

== Tools ==

Tools for lampworking are similar to those used in glassblowing. Graphite is frequently used for the working surfaces of lampworking tools because of its ability to withstand high temperatures, low coefficient of friction, and resistance to sticking to the molten glass. Steel is used where greater strength is required. Some molds may be made from fruitwoods, but primarily wood is used for handles of lampworking tools. Brass may be used for working surfaces where a higher coefficient of friction is desired.
*Bench burner – A torch that is fixed to the bench which provides a stationary flame.
*Hand torch – The hand torch allows for more maneuverability of the flame, commonly used on glassworking lathes where there is reduced maneuverability of the piece
*Kiln – the kiln is used to garage and anneal the glass, protecting the piece from thermal shock and relieving thermal stress.
*Marver – flat surfaces used to roll glass upon in order to shape, smooth or consolidate applied decoration, typically made of graphite or steel.
*Paddle – A graphite or metal marver attached to a handle
*Reamer – A piece of graphite or brass on a handle used to enlarge holes.
*Blowhose/swivel assembly – A hose, usually latex, is connected to the blowpipe via a hollow swivel, allowing the lampworker to blow into hollow glass forms while rotating them.
*Tungsten pick – The extreme temperature resistance of tungsten makes it ideal for raking (dragging glass around on the surface), or to bore a hole through the glass.
*Shears – Steel shears are used to cut the hot glass.
*Claw grabbers – Metal tool found in various configurations which allows the hot glass to be securely held and rotated, commonly used for finishing pieces after they have been removed from the blowpipe or pontil.
*Lathe – The glassworking lathe allows for precise rotation and manipulation of glass. They are especially suited for larger scale work that may be difficult or tiring to turn by hand.

== General methods of beadmaking ==

After designing a piece, a lampworker must plan how to construct it. Once ready to begin, the lampworker slowly introduces glass rod or tubing into the flame to prevent cracking from thermal shock. The glass is heated until molten and wound around a specially coated steel mandrel, forming the base bead. The coating is an anti-fluxing bead release agent that will allow the bead to be easily removed from the mandrel, either a clay-based substance or boron nitride. It can then be embellished or decorated using a variety of techniques and materials. All parts of the workpiece must be kept at similar temperatures lest they shatter. Once finished, the piece must be annealed in an kiln to prevent cracking or shattering.

Annealing, in glass terms, is heating a piece until its temperature reaches a stress-relief point; that is, a temperature at which the glass is still too hard to deform, but is soft enough for internal stresses to ease. The piece is then allowed to heat-soak until its temperature is uniform throughout. The time necessary for this depends on the type of glass and thickness of the thickest section. The piece is then slowly cooled at a predetermined rate until its temperature is below a critical point, (between 900 and 1000 degrees Fahrenheit), at which it cannot generate internal stresses, and then can safely be dropped to room temperature. This relieves the internal stresses, resulting in a piece which should last for many years. Glass that has not been annealed may crack or shatter due to a seemingly minor temperature change or other shock.

== Additional techniques for lampworked beads ==
Beads can be sandblasted, or they can be faceted, using lapidary techniques. &quot;Furnace glass&quot; beads, which are more elaborate versions of the old Seed bead technique, are widely made today. Chevron beads are multi-layer beads once exclusively made using hot-shop techniques to produce the original tubing; but now some lampworkers make similar designs on their torches before lapping the ends to reveal the various layered colors. As torches get bigger and more powerful, the cross-over between lampworking and furnace glass continues to increase.

Fuming is a technique that has been developed and popularized by Bob Snodgrass since the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s. Fuming consists of heating silver or gold in the flame, so that the metals vaporize or &quot;fume&quot; microscopically thin layers of particles onto the glass. These particles stick to the hot glass surface changing its color with interesting effects. Silver turns clear glass into a yellowish color, giving shades of blues and greens when backed with a dark color, while gold turns clear glass shades of pinks and reds. The precious metal coating becomes increasingly visible the more the glass is fumed.

== Brief history of modern lampworked beads ==
Lampworked beads (with the exception of Asian and African beadmaking) have generally been for the last four hundred years or so the province of Italian, and, later, Bohemian lampworkers who kept the techniques secret. Thirty or so years ago, some American artists started experimenting with the form. Their early efforts, by today&#x27;s standards, were crude, as there was almost no documentation, and none of the modern tools. However, they shared their information, and some of them started small businesses developing tools, torches and other equipment.

This group eventually formed the basis for the International Society of Glass Beadmakers.

<doc id="1219392" wikidata="Q6500901" url="?curid=1219392" title="Laurence Tisch">
<text>Laurence Alan Tisch (March 5, 1923 – November 15, 2003) was an American businessman, investor and billionaire. He was the CEO of CBS television network from 1986 to 1995. With his brother Bob Tisch, he was part owner of Loews Corporation.

==Early life==
Tisch was born March 5, 1923, in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Sadye (née Brenner) and Al Tisch. His father&#x27;s parents had emigrated from Ukraine and his mother&#x27;s parents from Poland. He was of Jewish descent. His father, a former All-American basketball player at the City University of New York, owned a garment factory as well as two summer camps which his wife helped him run. 

==Education and early career==
He graduated from New York University when he was just 18 and received a Penn Wharton MBA in industrial management by 20. In 1946, he made his first investment, purchasing a 300-room winter resort in Lakewood, New Jersey with $125,000 in seed money (roughly equivalent to $1.5 million at 2012 prices) from his parents. Two years later, his brother Bob joined him in the business, launching a lifelong partnership between the pair with Larry handling financial matters and Bob the overall management.

Their first hotel was successful and over the next decade, the Tisch brothers bought a dozen hotels in Atlantic City and the Catskills.

==Loews==
In 1960, using the proceeds from their hotel empire, Tisch gained control of Loews Theaters, one of the largest movie house chains at the time, with Bob and Larry as co-chairmen of the company. They were attracted to Loews by its underlying real estate assets which they believed were undervalued. They were correct in this assumption and would later tear down many of the centrally located old theaters to build apartments and hotels reaping millions in profits.

The pair soon diversified the business, successfully venturing into a variety of areas. In 1968, Loews acquired Lorillard, the 5th largest tobacco company in the US at the time, which owned the popular brands Kent, Newport and True. In 1974, they purchased a controlling interest in the nearly bankrupt insurance company, CNA Financial Corporation. This too was successful and several years later it held an A+ credit rating. They also purchased the Bulova Watch Company.

Through acquisitions, Tisch built Loews&#x27; into a profitable conglomerate (with 14 hotels, 67 movie theaters, CNA Financial, Bulova, and Lorillard) with revenues increasing from $100 million in 1970 to more than $3 billion in 1980.

In 2002, the year before Larry Tisch&#x27;s death, the corporation had revenues of more than $17 billion and assets of more than $70 billion.

==CBS==
In 1986, CBS Inc. was the target of several hostile takeover attempts by the likes of Ted Turner, Marvin Davis, and Ivan Boesky. Tisch was invited by CBS to invest in the company so as to help stop the hostile advances. Tisch spent $750 million for a 24.9% stake in CBS and a seat on the board. Later, with the support of company patriarch William S. Paley, he was named the company&#x27;s president and CEO.
The Tisch era at CBS was marked by relentless cost-cutting: Tisch fired 230 out of 1,200 news employees and cut $30 million from the news division&#x27;s budget. CBS divested itself of non-broadcast assets. In 1986, he sold the book publisher Holt, Rinehart and Winston to Harcourt Brace Jovanovich for $500 million; in 1987, he sold the CBS magazine division to Diamandis Communications; and also in 1987, he sold the CBS Music Group, the 2nd largest record company in the world at the time, to Sony for $2 billion. Westinghouse Electric bought CBS in 1995 for an estimated $5.4 billion, of which Tisch&#x27;s ownership netted him $2 billion.

Although Tisch&#x27;s decade long tenure at CBS was marked by a 15% annual increase in the value of its stock, CBS remained in third place out of the big three national networks. Tisch was criticized for not understanding the broadcast business, not diversifying the business after selling its non-broadcast assets, and poor performance of CBS relative to its peers. The network&#x27;s low occurred on Tisch&#x27;s watch in 1993, when the network refused to counter the upstart Fox&#x27;s billion dollar bid for the rights to the NFL&#x27;s NFC package it held since 1956, resulting in the network losing its NFL rights until picking up the AFC rights in 1998, and a number of affiliates to depart the network for Fox, leaving it to rebuild throughout the rest of the decade.

John Gutfreund, CEO of Salomon Brothers compared him with Bill Paley, the founder of CBS: &quot;Bill had a vision for the industry, for Larry, it is a business.&quot;

==Philanthropy==

Tisch made major donations to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York University, the NYU Medical Center and the Wildlife Conservation Society. A $4.5 million gift created the Tisch Children&#x27;s Zoo in Central Park.

From 1978 to 1998, Tisch was chairman of the board of trustees at New York University overseeing a $1 billion capital campaign and major improvements in the university. Tisch was also a former president of the United Jewish Appeal of New York.

NYU&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts is named in honor of him and his brother Bob, who donated the funds necessary to buy a building for the school. Tisch&#x27;s donations also provided funding for a professorship in law, which was established in 2010 and is held by noted legal scholar Richard Epstein. There is additionally a Tisch Hall at the Stern School of Business and a Tisch Hospital at the NYU Medical Center.

The professorship for history and economics in Harvard University is named after him in recognition of his philanthropy to the school. The Laurence A. Tisch professor is Niall Ferguson, a Scottish economic historian.

==Family==
Tisch married Wilma &quot;Billie&quot; Stein in 1948; they had four sons:
*Andrew H. Tisch
*Daniel R. Tisch – runs a family fund, Mentor Partners, and sits on the New York University board. He is the father of David Tisch.
*James S. Tisch
*Thomas Jonah Tisch – Works as a partner at FLF Associates, a private investment group in New York City. In 1985, he married Helen Vivian Scovell.

All four boys went to Suffield Academy in Suffield, Connecticut.

==Death==
Laurence Tisch died of gastroesophageal cancer, aged 80, in 2003. He was interred at Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.

<text>Buffalo Rock Company is an independent Pepsi bottler based in Birmingham, Alabama. It was founded in 1901. In addition to bottling Pepsi products, the company produced Grapico in 1916, a grape-flavored soft drink, and a ginger ale under its own brand name.

Buffalo Rock ginger ale is considerably darker in color and has a stronger ginger content than is customary. Some customers use the term &quot;ginger cola&quot; to describe the taste. Buffalo Rock and Grapico are sold throughout Alabama, parts of Georgia and the panhandle of Florida.

In 2005, Buffalo Rock introduced a soft drink called Dr. Wham. Dr. Wham is sold in Buffalo Rock markets where the company does not have the territorial rights to sell Dr Pepper, including markets such as Huntsville, Alabama, Montgomery, Alabama, Columbus, Georgia, Pensacola, Florida, and Staunton, Virginia. A complete listing of markets that carry Dr. Wham is on the Buffalo Rock website.

<text>John Hogan VC (8 April 1884 – 6 October 1943) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Hogan was born in Royton, Lancashire, England.

On 2 January 1915 Hogan married a widow, Margaret Taylor, at St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, Shaw Street, Oldham.

Hogan was 30 years old, and a sergeant in the 2nd Battalion, The Manchester Regiment, British Army, during the First World War. On 29 October 1914 near Festubert, France, he performed a deed along with Second Lieutenant James Leach for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

Their citation reads:

<text>The Königssee () is a natural lake in the southeast Berchtesgadener Land district of the German state of Bavaria, near the Austrian border. Most of the lake is within the Berchtesgaden National Park.

==Description==

Situated within the Berchtesgaden Alps in the municipality of Schönau am Königsee, just south of Berchtesgaden and the Austrian city of Salzburg, the Königssee is Germany&#x27;s third deepest lake. Located at a Jurassic rift, it was formed by glaciers during the last ice age. It stretches about in a north-south direction and is about across at its widest point. Except at its outlet, the Königsseer Ache at the village of Königssee, the lake is similar to a fjord, being surrounded by the steeply-rising flanks of mountains up to , including the Watzmann massif in the west.

The literal translation of the name, Königssee, appears to be &quot;king&#x27;s lake&quot;; however while does indeed mean &quot;king&quot;, there had been no Bavarian kings since the days of Louis the German (d. 876) until Elector Maximilian I Joseph assumed the royal title in 1806. Therefore, the name more probably stems from the first name &quot;Kuno&quot; of local nobles, who appear in several historical sources referring to the donation of the Berchtesgaden Provostry in the twelfth century; the lake was formerly called &quot;Kunigsee&quot;.

The Königssee Railway (&quot;Königsseebahn&quot;) served the lake from 1909 until 1965. Its last tracks were dismantled during 1971, and the former station of the Königssee Railway in Berchtesgaden (Königsseer Bahnhof) was demolished in 2012. The only remaining element of the railway is the Königsee station, which is now a restaurant. The track route is mostly used as a walking path.

In 1944, a sub-camp of the Dachau concentration camp was built nearby, located near a residence Heinrich Himmler had built at Schönau for his mistress Hedwig Potthast.

The lake is noted for its clear water and is advertised as the cleanest lake in Germany. For this reason, only electric-powered passenger ships, rowing, and pedal boats have been permitted on the lake since 1909. Passenger services along the length of the lake are operated by the Bayerische Seenschifffahrt company and call at Seelände (Schönau), St. Bartholomä, Salet (mid-April to mid-October), and Kessel (on request). In ideal conditions, the longest tour takes two hours from Seelände to Salet. Swimming is permitted except in the lock area at Seelände.

Due to its picturesque setting, the lake and surrounding parklands are very popular with tourists and hikers. In addition, the surrounding sheer rock walls create an echo known for its clarity. On boat tours, it has become traditional to stop and play a flugelhorn or trumpet to demonstrate the echo. Previously demonstrated by shooting a cannon, the echo can be heard to reverberate up to seven times. The trumpeter plays along with the echo, so that there can seem to be as many as seven players.

St. Bartholomä, a famous pilgrimage church with an inn nearby, is located on a peninsula about halfway down the western lake shore. The small Christlieger island is located near its northern end. South of the Königssee, separated by the &quot;Salet&quot; moraine, is the smaller Obersee lake with the high Röthbach waterfall. Because there is no lakeside path on the steep shore of the Königssee, St. Bartholomä and the southern edge can only be reached by boat, or via hiking trails up the surrounding mountains, except during harsh winters when the lake freezes over. Stepping on the ice, however, can be fatal, as it was for a motorist who drowned in his Volkswagen Beetle on the way back from St. Bartholomä in January 1964. The car was found only in 1997 at a depth of about .

<text>Technical communication (or Tech Comm) is communication of technical subject matter such as engineering, science, or technology content. The largest part of it tends to be technical writing, though importantly it often requires aspects of visual communication (which in turn sometimes entails technical drawing, requiring more specialized training). Technical communication also encompasses oral delivery modes such as presentations involving technical material. When technical communication occurs in workplace settings, it&#x27;s considered a major branch of professional communication. In research or R&amp;D contexts (academic or industrial), it can overlap with scientific writing. 

Technical communication is used to convey scientific, engineering, or other technical information. Individuals in a variety of contexts and with varied professional credentials engage in technical communication. Some individuals are designated as technical communicators or technical writers as their primary role; for some others, the role is inherently part of their technical position (e.g., engineers). In either case, these individuals utilize appropriate skills to research, document, and present technical information as needed. Technical communicators may use modalities including paper documents, digital files, audio and video media, and live delivery. 

The Society for Technical Communication defines the field as any form of communication that focuses on technical or specialized topics, communicates specifically by using technology, or provides instructions on how to do something. More succinctly, the Institute of Scientific and Technical Communicators defines technical communication as factual communication, usually about products and services. The European Association for Technical Communication briefly defines technical communication as &quot;the process of defining, creating and delivering information products for the safe, efficient and effective use of products (technical systems, software, services)&quot;.

Whatever the definition of technical communication, the overarching goal of the practice is to create easily accessible information for a specific audience.

==As a profession==
Technical communicators generally tailor information to a specific audience, which may be subject matter experts, consumers, end-users, etc. Technical communicators often work collaboratively to create deliverables that include online help, user manuals, classroom training guides, computer-based training, white papers, government documents, industrial videos, reference cards, data sheets, journal articles, and patents.
Technical domains can be of any kind, including the soft and hard sciences, high technology including computers and software, and consumer electronics. Technical communicators often work with a range of subject-matter experts (SMEs) on these projects.

Technical communication jobs include the following:
API writer, e-learning author, information architect, technical content developer, technical editor, technical illustrator, technical trainer, technical translator, technical writer, usability expert, user experience designer, and user interface designer. Other jobs available to technical communicators include digital strategist, marketing specialist, and content manager.

In 2015, the European Association for Technical Communication published a competence framework for the professional field of technical communication.

Much like technology and the world economy, technical communication as a profession has evolved over the last half-century. In a nutshell, technical communicators take the physiological research of a project and apply it to the communication process itself.

=== UX Design in Technical Communications ===
Historically, Technical &amp; Professional Communication (TPC) has been as an industry that practices writing and communication. However, recently User Experience (UX) Design has become more prominent in TPC as companies look to develop content for a wide range of audiences and experiences.

The User Experience Professionals Association defines user experience, or UX, as &quot;Every aspect of the user&#x27;s interaction with a product, service, or company that make up the user&#x27;s perception of the whole.&quot; Therefore, &quot;user experience design as a discipline is concerned with all the elements that together make up that interface, including layout, visual design, text, brand, sound, and interaction.&quot;

It is now an expectation that technical communication skills should be coupled with UX design. As Verhulsdonck, Howard, and Tham state &quot;...it is not enough to write good content. According to industry expectations, next to writing good content, it is now also crucial to design good experiences around that content.&quot; Technical communicators must now consider different platforms such as social media and apps, as well as different channels like web and mobile.

As Redish explains, TPC no longer writes content but &quot;writes around the interface&quot; itself as the user experience surrounding content is developed. This includes usable content customized to specific user needs, that addresses user emotions, feelings, and thoughts across different channels in a UX ecology.

Lauer and Brumberger further assert, &quot;…UX is a natural extension of the work that technical communicators already do, especially in the modern technological context of responsive design, in which content is deployed across a wide range of interfaces and environments.&quot;

==Content creation==

Technical communication is a task performed by specialized employees or consultants. For example, a professional writer may work with a company to produce a user manual. Some companies give considerable technical communication responsibility to other technical professionals—such as programmers, engineers, and scientists. Often, a professional technical writer edits such work to bring it up to modern technical communication standards.

To begin the documentation process, technical communicators identify the audience and their information needs. The technical communicator researches and structures the content into a framework that can guide detailed development. As the body of information comes together, the technical communicator ensures that the intended audience can understand the content and retrieve the information they need. This process, known as the writing process, has been a central focus of writing theory since the 1970s, and some contemporary textbook authors apply it to technical communication. Technical communication is important to most professions, as a way to contain and organize information and maintain accuracy.

The technical writing process is based on Cicero&#x27;s 5 canons of rhetoric, and can be divided into six steps:

# Determine purpose and audience
# Collect information (Invention)
# Organize and outline information (Arrangement)
# Write the first draft (Style)
# Revise and edit (Memory)
# Publish output (Delivery)

===Determining purpose and audience===
All technical communication serves a particular purpose—typically to communicate ideas and concepts to an audience, or instruct an audience in a particular task. Technical communication professionals use various techniques to understand the audience and, when possible, test content on the target audience. For example, if bank workers don&#x27;t properly post deposits, a technical communicator would review existing instructional material (or lack thereof), interview bank workers to identify conceptual errors, interview subject matter experts to learn the correct procedures, author new material that instructs workers in the correct procedures, and test the new material on the bank workers.

Similarly, a sales manager who wonders which of two sites is better for a new store might ask a marketing professional to study the sites and write a report with recommendations. The marketing professional hands the report off to a technical communicator (in this case, a technical editor or technical writer), who edits, formats, and sometimes elaborates the document in order to make the marketing professional&#x27;s expert assessment usable to the sales manager. The process is not one of knowledge transfer, but the accommodation of knowledge across fields of expertise and contexts of use. This is the basic definition of technical communication.

Audience type affects many aspects of communication, from word selection and graphics use to style and organization. Most often, to address a particular audience, a technical communicator must consider what qualities make a text useful (capable of supporting a meaningful task) and usable (capable of being used in service of that task). A non-technical audience might misunderstand or not even read a document that is heavy with jargon—while a technical audience might crave detail critical to their work such as vector notation. Busy audiences often don&#x27;t have time to read entire documents, so content must be organized for ease of searching—for example by frequent headings, white space, and other cues that guide attention. Other requirements vary according to a particular audience&#x27;s needs.

Technical communicators may need to translate, globalize, or localize their documents to meet the needs of audiences in different linguistic and cultural markets. Globalization involves producing technical content that meets the needs of &quot;as many audiences as possible,&quot; ideally an international audience. Localization adapts existing technical content to fit the &quot;cultural, rhetorical, educational, ethical, [and] legal&quot; expectations of users in a specific local context.

Technical communication, in the government, is particular and detailed. Depending on the segment of government (and country), the government component must follow distinct specifications. Information changes continuously and technical communications (technical manuals, interactive electronic technical manuals, technical bulletins, etc.) must be updated.

===Collecting information===
Technical communicators must collect all information that each document requires. They may collect information through primary (first-hand) research—or secondary research, using information from existing work by other authors. Technical communicators must acknowledge all sources they use to produce their work. To this end, technical communicators typically distinguish quotations, paraphrases, and summaries when taking notes.

===Organizing and outlining information===
Before writing the initial draft, the technical communicator organizes ideas in a way that makes the document flow well. Once each idea is organized, the writer organizes the document as a whole—accomplishing this task in various ways: 
# chronological: used for documents that involve a linear process, such as a step-by-step guide that describes how to accomplish something; 
# parts of an object: Used for documents that describe the parts of an object, such as a graphic showing the parts of a computer (keyboard, monitor, mouse, etc.); 
# simple to complex (or vice versa): starts with easy ideas and gradually goes into complex ideas; 
# specific to general: starts with many ideas, then organizes the ideas into sub-categories; 
# general to specific: starts with a few categories of ideas, then goes deeper.

After organizing the whole document, the writer typically creates a final outline that shows the document&#x27;s structure. Outlines make the writing process easier and save the author time.

===Writing the first draft===
After the outline is complete, the writer begins the first draft, following the outline&#x27;s structure. Setting aside blocks of an hour or more, in a place free of distractions, helps the writer maintain a flow. Most writers prefer to wait until the draft is complete before any revising so they don&#x27;t break their flow. Typically, the writer should start with the easiest section, and write the summary only after the body is drafted.

The ABC (&quot;a&quot;bstract, &quot;b&quot;ody, and &quot;c&quot;onclusion) format can be used when writing a first draft of some document types. The abstract describes the subject so that the reader knows what the document covers. The body is the majority of the document and covers topics in depth. Lastly, the conclusion section restates the document&#x27;s main topics. The ABC format can also apply to individual paragraphs—beginning with a topic sentence that states the paragraph&#x27;s topic, followed by the topic, and finally, a concluding sentence.

===Revising and editing===

Once the initial draft is laid out, editing and revising can be done to fine-tune the draft into a final copy. Usability testing can be helpful to evaluate how well the writing and/or design meets the needs of end-users and to suggest improvements [] Four tasks transform the early draft into its final form, suggested by Pfeiffer and Boogard:

====Adjusting and reorganizing content====
In this step, the writer revises the draft to elaborate on topics that need more attention, shorten other sections—and relocate certain paragraphs, sentences, or entire topics.

====Editing for style====
Good style makes writing more interesting, appealing, and readable. In general, the personal writing style of the writer is not evident in technical writing. Modern technical writing style relies on attributes that contribute to clarity: headings, lists, graphics; generous white space, short sentences, present tense, simple nouns, active voice (though some scientific applications still use the passive voice), second and third person as required

Technical writing as a discipline usually requires that a technical writer use a style guide. These guides may relate to a specific project, product, company, or brand. They ensure that technical writing reflects formatting, punctuation, and general stylistic standards that the audience expects. In the United States, many consider the &quot;Chicago Manual of Style&quot; the bible for general technical communication. Other style guides have their adherents, particularly for specific industries—such as the &quot;Microsoft Style Guide&quot; in some information technology settings.

====Editing for grammar and punctuation====
At this point, the writer performs a &quot;mechanical edit&quot;, checking the document for grammar, punctuation, common word confusions, passive voice, overly long sentences, etc.

<doc id="1219405" wikidata="Q1640794" url="?curid=1219405" title="Hypatia (crater)">
<text>Hypatia is a lunar impact crater along the northwest edge of Sinus Asperitatis, a bay on the southwest edge of Mare Tranquillitatis. It was named after Egyptian mathematician Hypatia of Alexandria. The nearest crater with an eponym is Alfraganus to the west-southwest. However, farther to the south-southeast, across the lunar mare, is the prominent crater Theophilus.

Hypatia is an asymmetrical formation with a rugged, irregular outer rim cut through in several places by narrow clefts. It is generally longer along an axis running to the north-northwest, with the widest outward bulge occurring on the west side at the northern end. It resembles a merger of several crater formations with a common interior floor. Attached to the exterior rim along the southwest is the satellite crater Hypatia A, a more symmetrical, bowl-shaped crater.

==Rimae Hypatia==
About 70 kilometers to the north of Hypatia is a system of linear rilles designated Rimae Hypatia, running about 180 kilometers across the Mare Tranquillitatis, and generally following a course to the south-southeast. The part of the rilles close to the crater Moltke was informally called &quot;U.S. Highway 1&quot; by the Apollo 10 and Apollo 11 crews.

==Satellite craters==
By convention, these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint closest to Hypatia.

<text>Major Roland Edward Elcock VC MM (5 June 1899 – 6 October 1944) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Elcock was born on 5 June 1899. He initially enlisted in the British Army in October 1914 when he was 15. Being underage for army service, he was discharged when his real age was discovered. He worked as a clerk in Wolverhampton before re-enlisting at the age of 18.

He was 19 years old, and an acting corporal in the 11th Battalion, The Royal Scots (The Lothian Regiment), British Army during the First World War, and was awarded the VC for his actions on 15 October 1918 south-east of Capelle St. Catherine, Belgium.
Corporal Elcock was in charge of a Lewis gun team, and entirely on his own initiative he rushed his gun up to within 10 yards of enemy guns which were causing heavy casualties and holding up the advance. He put both guns out of action, capturing five prisoners and undoubtedly saved the whole attack from being held up. Later, near the River Lys, this NCO again attacked an enemy machine-gun and captured the crew.

He later achieved the rank of major after enlisting in the British Indian Army during World War II. He died in October 1944.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Scots Museum, Edinburgh Castle, Scotland.

<text>Old Chapel Hill Cemetery is a graveyard and national historic district located on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

==History==
The land was a land grant to the University of North Carolina by the State of North Carolina. The land encompassed , and was sold for five shillings on October 21, 1776. The cemetery currently covers . The first recorded burial was George Clarke, a Burke County student at the university, who died September 28, 1798. His headstone was not placed until several years later. By January 28, 1994, 1,621 burials had been performed. The cemetery is now almost full, and all of the plots have already been bought. In 1922, the town took over responsibility for maintaining the cemetery, and in 1988, the ownership changed over to the University.

A low rock wall was built around the cemetery in 1835 at the cost of $64.41. The school officially named the cemetery &quot;College Graveyard,&quot; as opposed to &quot;Village Cemetery,&quot; like the Chapel Hill residents called it. Five sidewalks divide the cemetery into six sections. Two of the sections were reserved for African-American burials because there were no black church cemeteries in town. A low rock wall divides the two segregated sections (Sections A and B) from the rest. The Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies were the first to establish plots. In the other sections, there are administrators and professors, as well as prominent public officials, business leaders, and artists from the area. During the Civil War, Confederate soldiers were buried there.
There are many different styles of grave markers represented in the cemetery. Many of the early family plots are marked by monuments and obelisks with smaller tablets marking individual graves. There are also uninscribed fieldstones, headstones, ledgers, boxtombs, and tomb-tables in the newer sections. Marble and granite were used most frequently, but stone and concrete can also be found.

The Old Chapel Hill Cemetery is not just a resting place for the deceased. It remains an integral part of campus life. For many students, the quiet, secluded setting is an ideal place to relax or study. Diverse species of trees, such as oaks, hickories, gums, cedars, maples, and pines, create a cover of shade in the cemetery. There are also shrubs, like boxwoods, azaleas, nandinas, and crape myrtles, around many of the plots. During the spring, dogwood trees, azaleas and wisteria make the cemetery one of the most beautiful spots on campus. Some of the individual gravestones are covered by English ivy and vinca. A gazebo has been built between Section B and Section 1 and provides a convenient place to sit.

Vandalism has been a major problem in the cemetery. Whether the culprits are just careless or actually meaning to cause damage, the cemetery has had many tombstones ruined throughout the years. Five 19th century headstones were tipped over and smashed the day before Charles Kuralt was buried in the cemetery. On November 27, 1974, 40 to 50 monuments were broken and pushed off their bases. In 1985, football fans eager to get to a seat damaged stones.

Distinguished persons buried in the cemetery include legendary North Carolina basketball coach Dean Smith; band leader Kay Kyser and his wife, singer Georgia Carroll; playwright Paul Green; novelists Alice Adams and Max Steele; university presidents Frank Porter Graham, Robert Burton House, and William Friday; and CBS newsman Charles Kuralt.

In 2005, the Memorial Grove portion was established to allow space for the spreading of ashes of cremated persons. Names of those whose ashes have been spread in the grove are inscribed upon the Wall of Remembrance. To date, the names of fifteen persons are inscribed on the wall. Some of these persons had been cremated before the opening of the grove. It is assumed that their ashes were originally retained in the care of loved ones.

<text>Canned Carrott is a comedy stand-up and sketch-show by Jasper Carrott. It gave rise to a spin-off series, and made the names of regular contributors Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis.

Two of the regular sketches were &quot;Wiggy&quot; and &quot;The Detectives&quot;. &quot;Wiggy&quot; followed the adventures of a man with an unconvincing wig (played by Carrott). It was a slapstick comedy in which the characters were silent except for the narrator, similar in style to Mr. Bean or &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;.

The most popular sketch segment was &quot;The Detectives&quot;, featuring two mediocre police officers, Briggs and Louis (played by Carrott and Robert Powell), who tried unsuccessfully to emulate the actions of television detectives. Such was the popularity of this sketch that it became the basis of another television comedy series, &quot;The Detectives&quot;.

Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis subsequently joined the cast of &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot;, and later got their own sketch show, called &quot;The Imaginatively Titled Punt &amp; Dennis Show&quot;, which ran for two series.

Author and editor of several books, in addition to being a regular columnist for a number of English-language Pakistani newspapers, he is best known for his translations of the short stories of Saadat Hasan Manto and the poems of Faiz Ahmed Faiz.
== Life and career ==
Khalid Hasan was born in Srinagar, Kashmir. His father, Noor Hussain, was from Jammu, and worked in the Jammu and Kashmir ministry of health. Khalid Hasan as well as the rest of the family migrated from Jammu to Pakistan during the 1947 communal violence. His two elder brothers (Brigadier General Bashir Ahmed and Saeed Ahmed) served in the Pakistan Army and a younger brother (Masood Hasan) ran an advertising business in Lahore. His sister Surayya was married to K. H. Khurshid who served Muhammad Ali Jinnah as his private secretary, then later became president of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. His second sister, Zohra, resides in Peshawar, Pakistan.

<text>Isidorus is a lunar impact crater that is located to the north of the Mare Nectaris, on the eastern half of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It was named after Spanish astronomer Saint Isidore of Seville. It forms a pair with the slightly larger Capella, which is attached to the east-northeastern rim. To the west-southwest across the lunar mare are Mädler and the prominent Theophilus.

The rim of Isidorus is circular and somewhat eroded, with several tiny craterlets lying across the northern rim. The interior floor has been resurfaced by lava and is generally level, although it is marked by the small, bowl-shaped crater Isidorus A along the western rim. There is a tiny remnant of a craterlet attached to the northern rim of the latter formation.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Isidorus.

<text>Lieutenant General James John McLeod Innes (5 February 1830 – 13 December 1907) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in British India to Scottish parents, Innes was educated privately, then at Edinburgh University and at Addiscombe Military Seminary, military academy of the East India Company where he was awarded the Pollock Medal. He was commissioned into the Bengal Engineers in 1848 and, after further training, he arrived in India in November 1850. When the Indian Mutiny began in May 1857 he was at Lucknow, where he helped to defend the city throughout its siege. After the evacuation of Lucknow in November 1897, he served in military operations in Oudh State.

Innes was a 28 year old lieutenant in the Bengal Engineers, Bengal Army during the Indian Mutiny on 23 February 1858 at Sultanpore, India, where he was awarded Victoria Cross for the following deed:

For his work in the Mutiny, he was also mentioned in dispatches three times and received the brevet rank of major.

After the Mutiny campaign Innes continued to serve in India, with the Royal Engineers (Bengal). After holding a number of military and civil engineering posts, he was finally promoted to major-general in 1885. In March 1886 he retired with the honorary rank of lieutenant-general, after which he wrote a number of books, mostly relating to the history of the Indian Mutiny. In June 1907, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Mutiny, Innes became a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB), military division. He died on 13 December 1907 aged 77 at his home in Cambridge.

His Victoria Cross is displayed in the Royal Engineers Museum at Chatham, England.

<doc id="1219424" wikidata="Q4917983" url="?curid=1219424" title="Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich">
<text>The Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich is the Ordinary of the Church of England&#x27;s Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich in the Province of Canterbury.

The current bishop is Martin Seeley. The Bishop&#x27;s residence is the Bishop&#x27;s House, Ipswich — a little to the north of the town centre.

==History==
Under the Suffragan Bishops Act 1534, the title &quot;Bishop of Ipswich&quot; was created in 1536, but it fell into abeyance following the first holder surrendering the office in 1538. In 1899, the title was revived with two suffragan bishops of Ipswich appointed to assist the diocesan bishop of Norwich. Through reorganisation in the Church of England, the Diocese of Saint Edmundsbury and Ipswich was established by Act of Parliament in 1913 under King George V. The bishop&#x27;s and the diocesan offices are located in Ipswich, while the bishop&#x27;s seat is located at St Edmundsbury Cathedral in Bury St Edmunds. Since 1934, the bishops of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich have been assisted by the suffragan bishops of Dunwich in overseeing the diocese.

== List of bishops ==

==Assistant bishops==
Among those who have served the diocese as assistant bishops have been:
*in 1921, Cecil Wood, Rector of Witnesham and former Bishop of Melanesia, served as archbishop&#x27;s commissary (i.e. acting diocesan bishop)
*1931–1934: Maxwell Maxwell-Gumbleton, Archdeacon of Sudbury from 1932 and former Bishop of Ballarat, became first Bishop suffragan of Dunwich

<text>Andrea Montermini (born 30 May 1964) is an Italian racing driver. He drove in Formula One from 1994 to 1996.

==Career==
Montermini raced in Formula 3 in 1989, taking second place in the Monaco GP support race and 4th in the Italian F3 Championship. He then moved up to Formula 3000, racing for three seasons before finally taking second place in the 1992 season, winning three rounds while driving for the Il Barone Rampante team.


He participated in 29 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 29 May 1994 for Simtek, replacing Roland Ratzenberger, who had been killed during qualifying for the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. Montermini himself crashed heavily in practice for the 1994 Spanish Grand Prix, breaking his left heel and his right foot. He returned to Formula One the next season, with the Pacific Grand Prix team, and drove for Forti in 1996 alongside countryman Luca Badoer until the team folded. For the 1997 season Montermini was signed as test driver for the MasterCard Lola team, but it folded after one race. He scored no points in his Formula One career. , he holds the record for the shortest F1 driver of all time, at a height of 1.57m (5ft 1in) tall. 

He competed in the American Champ Car series three different seasons: 1993-1994 and 1999. He scored a 4th place at Detroit in his first season, driving for the underfunded Euromotorsport team. In 1999 he drove a few events for Dan Gurney in Gurney&#x27;s last season of team ownership. When others such as Alex Barron, Gualter Salles and Raul Boesel were replaced, he filled in and scored a best finish of 11th in Vancouver.

He raced in the 2001 24 Hours of Daytona, but has primarily raced in the FIA GT Championship, mostly in Ferrari cars. He has taken two class wins and four further class podiums. In 2006 he has occasionally raced alongside Jarek Janis and Sascha Bert in a Saleen ran by the Zakspeed team. In 2007 he won the International GT Open&#x27;s GTA class, driving a Ferrari 430 for Scuderia Playteam alongside co-champion Michele Maceratesi, the duo becoming overall champions the following season. He won a second overall championship title in 2013.

<doc id="1219447" wikidata="Q171518" url="?curid=1219447" title="Arturo Merzario">
<text>Arturo Francesco &quot;Art&quot; Merzario (born 11 March 1943) is an Italian racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to . 

Merzario competed in Formula One for Ferrari, Frank Williams, Fittipaldi, March, Wolf–Williams and Shadow, before founding his eponymous team in : Merzario. He participated in 85 Grands Prix, scoring 11 championship points.

==Racing career==
Merzario began his career as a test driver with works Fiat Abarths, subsequently participating to GT racing and European mountain-climb events. In 1969 he won the Mugello Grand Prix in a 2-litre Abarth ahead of a field which included Nino Vaccarella and Andrea de Adamich. This brought him a drive with the Ferrari sportscar team for 1970. In 1972, he won the Spa 1000 km, the Targa Florio and the Rand 9 Hour races and was also European two-litre Champion for Abarth.

===Formula One===
Merzario made his Formula One debut in 1972, and became one of the few drivers to score points at their first race by finishing in sixth place in the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch. He was the last driver whose debut team was Ferrari until Oliver Bearman in the 2024 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. In 1973 Ferrari confirmed him for the whole season alongside Jacky Ickx. Merzario had a promising start with the old 312B2, finishing fourth in Brazil and South Africa. However, Ferrari&#x27;s evolved car, the 312B3, proved to be a disappointment, and both he and Ickx struggled for the rest of the season. Deeply disappointed with the way the season had unfolded, Enzo Ferrari decided to change the whole team for the 1974 season, and Merzario moved to Williams. After finishing third in a non-Championship race in Brazil, Merzario scored points at Monza and in South Africa. However, the Williams cars were largely uncompetitive, and in 1975, after a one-off with the Copersucar at Monza, where he finished eleventh, Merzario returned to sports cars with Alfa Romeo — winning four races plus the Targa Florio again.

Merzario returned to Formula One full-time in 1976, initially with the works March. After a run of disappointing results — and disgruntled with his situation — he moved to Wolf, who had just merged his team with Frank Williams Racing Cars, replacing Jacky Ickx; but, again, there were no decent results.
During the 1976 German Grand Prix, Niki Lauda crashed heavily; Merzario was one of the drivers, along with Guy Edwards, Brett Lunger and Harald Ertl who stopped to help, effectively pulling Lauda out of the burning car. 37 years later, in an interview with BBC Radio 5 linked to the release of &quot;Rush&quot;, Lauda stated that &quot;Merzario jumped into the fire and, alone, pulled me out of the wreckage so I survived… he really saved my life there, because a couple of seconds more I would have never made it.&quot; Six weeks later after the incident, at the Italian Grand Prix, Lauda returned to race again and presented his gold Rolex wristwatch to Merzario in gratitude for saving his life.

In 1977, Merzario was able to raise enough sponsors to set up his own Merzario team. The organization struggled in modern Formula One for three years, initially with March 761B cars. From 1978, Merzario began building cars of his own design and the team would eventually move down to Formula Two. In three seasons, the team was only classified on one occasion — at the 1977 Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder — when Merzario was officially placed fourteenth. During the season, he accepted a one-off drive with Shadow in the 1977 Austrian Grand Prix at the Österreichring, but a good drive led to retirement again. Merzario continued with his own chassis for two seasons, but results were very poor; the team&#x27;s cars did not qualify on the majority of occasions, and often retired from the races they did start. The Merzario M1-BMW fared no better in Formula Two in 1980 but Merzario continued to race sports cars with some success after his works Formula One career finished.

During his time in Formula One, Merzario was often photographed wearing a cowboy hat with sponsorship patches from Marlboro. This became his signature look, and Merzario still wears the hat.

===Sports cars and other competitions===

Merzario began his career with Abarth in GT racing and mountain climbs; he also won the Sardinia Rally in 1963 in an Alfa Romeo Giulietta. He had several class wins throughout the 1960s; his victory in the Mugello Grand Prix of 1969 led to a Ferrari sports car drive. In 1970, he was third in the 24 hours of Daytona and fourth in the 1000 Kilometres of Monza using a Ferrari 512 S. Further wins followed in 1971 at Imola and Vallelunga for Ferrari and Abarth, respectively.

In 1972, Merzario won the 1000 Kilometres of Spa with Brian Redman in a Ferrari 312 PB, won the Targa Florio alongside Sandro Munari, and made his Formula One World Championship debut. In 1973, Merzario took second places in the 1000 Kilometres of Nürburgring and at Le Mans. Merzario also won the Targa Florio in 1975 with an Alfa Romeo T33, and his career continued in sports cars and GT racing into the 1990s; he won the 1985 Italian Prototype Championship, and later campaigned successfully with a Centenari M1.

Merzario was still active in sports car racing well into his sixties, driving mostly in an Italian prototype series.

<text>Jane Rolfe (October 10, 1650 – January 27, 1676) was the granddaughter of Pocahontas and English colonist John Rolfe (credited with introducing a strain of tobacco for export by the struggling Virginia Colony).
Her husband was Colonel Robert Bolling, who lived from 1646 to 1709. Robert and Jane had one son, John Bolling (1676–1729).

==Biography==
Jane Rolfe was born in Varina, Henrico County, Virginia on October 10, 1650 to Thomas Rolfe and his wife, Jane Poythress, whose parents were Francis Poythress and Alice Payton of England. Thomas Rolfe was the son of John Rolfe and his wife, Pocahontas.

Jane Rolfe married Robert Bolling of Prince George County, Virginia. Their son, John Bolling, was born on January 27, 1676. Jane is said to have died shortly after giving birth.

John Bolling married Mary Kennon, daughter of Richard Kennon and Elizabeth Worsham of Conjurer&#x27;s Neck. The couple had six surviving children, each of whom married and had surviving children.

Jane Rolfe&#x27;s interment was near her father in the Kippax Plantation, but her birth year was never engraved on her headstone.

<text>Riccius is a lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged, southeastern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It was named after Italian astronomers Augustinus Riccius and Matteo Ricci. It lies within one crater diameter southeast of the crater Rabbi Levi. To the east-northeast is Stiborius and due south is Nicolai.

This formation has been so heavily bombarded by subsequent impacts that it is nearly unrecognizable as a crater. Only the western and southwestern parts of the rim remains intact, the remainder having been obliterated by small craters. These craters also occupy parts of the northern and southern floor. Only a section in the northeast and near the intact western rim remain unmarked. This is perhaps the most defaced crater formation on the Moon that possesses an eponym.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Riccius.

<text>Thomas Duffy VC (b, 1824 to 23 December 1868), born in Mount Temple (Caulry), Athlone, County Westmeath, was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was approximately 33 years old, and a private in the 1st Madras European Fusiliers (later The Royal Dublin Fusiliers), Indian Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 26 September 1857 at Lucknow, India for which he was awarded the VC:
A 24-pounder gun which had been used against the enemy on the previous day was left in an exposed position and all efforts to reach it were unsuccessful, so heavy was the fire maintained on it by the mutineers. Private Duffy, however, who went out with two others, managed to fasten a rope to the gun in such a manner that it could be pulled away and was saved from falling into the hands of the enemy. His citation reads:
He died in Athlone on 23 December 1868 and is buried in the Athlone area.

His Victoria Cross was offered at auction on 27 October 1902. Today it is displayed at the National Army Museum in Chelsea, England.

<doc id="1219455" wikidata="Q5964993" url="?curid=1219455" title="Signal transducing adaptor protein">
<text>Signal transducing adaptor proteins (STAPs) are proteins that are accessory to main proteins in a signal transduction pathway. Adaptor proteins contain a variety of protein-binding modules that link protein-binding partners together and facilitate the creation of larger signaling complexes. These proteins tend to lack any intrinsic enzymatic activity themselves, instead mediating specific protein–protein interactions that drive the formation of protein complexes. Examples of adaptor proteins include MYD88, Grb2 and SHC1.

==Signaling components==
Much of the specificity of signal transduction depends on the recruitment of several signalling components such as protein kinases and G-protein GTPases into short-lived active complexes in response to an activating signal such as a growth factor binding to its receptor.

==Domains==
Adaptor proteins usually contain several domains within their structure (e.g., Src homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domains) that allow specific interactions with several other specific proteins. SH2 domains recognise specific amino acid sequences within proteins containing phosphotyrosine residues and SH3 domains recognise proline-rich sequences within specific peptide sequence contexts of proteins.

There are many other types of interaction domains found within adaptor and other signalling proteins that allow a rich diversity of specific and coordinated protein–protein interactions to occur within the cell during signal transduction.

==Examples of adaptor proteins==

Adaptor proteins include:
* BCAR3 – Breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance protein 3
* CBL – Casitas B-lineage Lymphoma
* FRS2 – Fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2
* GAB2 – GRB2-associated binding protein 2
* GRAP – GRB2-related adaptor protein
* GRAP2 – GRB2-related adaptor protein 2
* GRB2 – Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 
* IRS1 – Insulin receptor substrate 1 
* LDLRAP1 – low-density lipoprotein receptor adaptor protein 1
* MYD88 - Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88
* NCDN - Neurochondrin
* NCK1 – NCK adaptor protein 1
* NCK2 – NCK adaptor protein 2
* NOS1AP – nitric oxide synthase 1 (neuronal) adaptor protein
* PIK3AP1 – phosphoinositide-3-kinase adaptor protein 1
* SH2B1 – SH2B adaptor protein 1
* SH2B2 – SH2B adaptor protein 2
* SH2B3 – SH2B adaptor protein 3
* SH2D3A -SH2 domain containing 3A
* SH2D3C – SH2 domain containing 3C
* SNTA1 – Syntrophin, alpha 1
* SHB – Src homology 2 domain containing adaptor protein B
* SLC4A1AP – solute carrier family 4 (anion exchanger), member 1, adaptor protein

<text>Llanelli Town Association Football Club are a semi-professional Welsh football club that plays in the .

The original club was wound up on 22 April 2013 at the High Court in London following a petition presented by HM Revenue and Customs. They were reformed later that year as Llanelli Town AFC and played in the Welsh Premier League. The club finished 12th in the 2018–19 Welsh Premier League season (bottom of the league), and were relegated after failing to gain a Tier 1 Licence. They played in the Cymru South for the 2019–20 season.

==Background==

The team is based at Stebonheath Park from 1920, having previously played at the Halfway athletics ground.

Formed in 1896, the club&#x27;s first honour was the Welsh League division one title in 1913–14 with further wins coming in 1929–30 and 1932–33. Llanelli made several attempts to join The Football League, in 1922, 1923, 1929, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1947, 1950 and 1951. Despite making an effort to turn professional, the club was not elected. The closest they came was in 1933, where the club received 20 votes compared to 26 for Newport County and 45 for Swindon Town who were re-elected to the Football League Third Division South. Llanelli was a founding member of the Welsh Premier League in 1992, but after only four seasons suffered relegation. Promotion back to the top division was achieved in 1998–99, but 2002–03 saw the team demoted only to return to the top-flight for the 2004–05 season. In 2005 a wealthy business man and his consortium, The Jesco group bought the club. Since then, the club&#x27;s fortunes have transformed remarkably on the pitch. They have played in Europe for 7 consecutive seasons, they won the Welsh premier league and Loosemores challenge cup in 2008 and won the Welsh Cup in 2011.

2012–13 was difficult financially with three petitions to wind the club up presented by HM Revenue and Customs.

The club was wound up on 22 April 2013 at the High Court in London following a petition presented by HM Revenue and Customs. The formation of a &#x27;phoenix club&#x27; of Llanelli Town AFC meant the town of Llanelli was still represented in Welsh football. The new team started in the Welsh Third Division for the 2013–14 season. In 2014-15 they were crowned Third Division champions and as such gained promotion to the Welsh Second Division. In April 2018 the club was crowned champions of the Second Division. After an appeal to the Football Association of Wales against a decision not the grant the club a Tier 1 licence, the club returned to the Welsh Premier League for the 2018–19 season.

==History==

The game of Association Football was introduced to the townspeople of Llanelli when workers from Staffordshire migrated to the town to work in the &#x27;newest&#x27; of the town industries – the Pottery works from 1892 to 1920. Finding the game of rugby Football Union alien to their natural habitat whilst domiciled in the town, workers founded a team to play friendlies versus other teams from the various pottery works industry which had been set up in Swansea and Neath. However, by 1896 interest had waned due in the main to those initial workers returning to their homesteads having successfully instructed their local co-workers into the intricacies of the pottery world. The first playing area had been at &#x27;Cae Blake&#x27; in the Furnace area of the town, but when the new Peoples Park in the middle of the town was opened as a recreation area for the town&#x27;s populace the team had transferred to this new ground. By 1904 with more and more clubs being formed in the south of the principality ardent soccer aficionados decided to resurrect the club under the astute managership of Bert Andrews, a man from Ironbridge, Shropshire, who had remained in the town working in an administrative post at the Llanelli Pottery. The club entered into the Swansea and District League and played their home matches firstly at Tunnel Road and thence to Penyfan Fields.

===The Pre-War Era===
In season 1911–12 after seven years of consolidation Llanelli AFC became League champions and were also losing finalists in the League Cup. This was the spur that was needed to progress even further and led by another immigrant to the town, W T Morris who hailed from Llanidloes and was a leading entrepreneur in the commercial world of Llanelli, the club decided to become fully professional and applied for membership in both the Southern League and the Welsh League. A further move was necessary to entertain the professional game and Halfway Park some two miles from the town centre was chosen as the new venue. This former cycle stadium was the ideal velodrome for Association Football boasting a grand stand and natural banking, and this was the catalyst, which both league structures sought when sanctioning the club&#x27;s inclusion in the two participating Leagues. Their first season 1912–13 was an immediate success finishing in 6th position of the Southern League and joint 3rd with Swansea Town in the Welsh League. They were also invited to participate in the FA Cup for the first time, reaching the 3rd Qualifying Round before being beaten by Cardiff City at home. The following season they entered also into the Welsh Senior Cup competition and reached the final at the first time of asking, before losing to Wrexham, the eventual winners in the replay at Oswestry after a 0–0 draw at Pontypridd. It was also during this season that the club achieved its best win to date beating Treharris 17–0 at home in a League game.

===The Interwar Period===
In the 1919–20 season the reformed club&#x27;s formats of pre-war years when the 1st team squad contested in both leagues and the team&#x27;s reserve side participated in the Swansea Senior League. By 1922 it was obvious that to further their ambitions of achieving Football League status a new stadium near the town centre would have to be sought. A piece of ground in the Stebonheath area of the town was purchased and plans were afoot to move the club lock stock and barrel from Halfway. This was achieved just in time for the 1922–23 season, when Bridgend Town were the first visitors. Later on in the season to mark the period of the club&#x27;s history although proving successful was fraught with financial problems, and at the end of this official opening of the ground the FA Cup holders of the previous season Tottenham Hotspur were invited to participate and were given a rude awakening when the Reds defeated them on the day by 2–1. Later on Burnley and Charlton Athletic were invited to participate in this inaugural season at Stebonheath Park running out winners. At the end of the season which had been a merited success from a playing point of view the club made its first application with Pontypridd Town for inclusion in Football League, Third Division (South), but just failed in their bids when both the member clubs up for re-election, Southend United and Exeter City were both re-elected. For the next three years. Llanelli AFC built up a reputation as one of the leading non-league clubs in the country and in 1925 became the only club to contest every round in the FA Cup from Preliminary to Qualifying and on to the equivalent Third round of today, when they met Fulham at Craven Cottage before losing by the odd goal in a highly emotional game. This period of the club&#x27;s history although proving successful was fraught with financial problems, and at the end of this emotional season the club terribly in debt and failing to meet their obligations to their players and the two respective management committees of both leagues were forced to resign and the club went into voluntary suspended animation.

By 1928 after three years in the wilderness football enthusiasts in the town including the groundsman/caretaker of Stebonheath Park Jack Goldsborough who had joined the club in 1922 as a player/trainer resolved the resurrect the club once more and fate decreed that they were able to succeed when they took over the fixtures of Aberdare Athletic in the Welsh League, another club by this time who were in dire straits and themselves had had to resign from the Welsh League for the same reason as Llanelli. Their first season was naturally one of consolidation but at the season&#x27;s end once more they made overtures to the Southern League hierarchy and gained a place for the following season in this prestigious league. For the next five seasons the club were once again on a high, winning trophies once more and just failing on three other occasions in cementing a place in the Football League playing excellent football to the joy of their supporters and it was a golden era for the club, but the bubble was to burst once more. Falling attendances, high outlay of cash on imported players and escalating costs all played their part and first their withdrawal from the Southern League was implemented for the 1934–35 season with the club plying their trade only in the Welsh League 1st Division, where they remained until the outbreak of World War II suffering many defeats including their record defeat of 0–12 at Rexville home of now defunct Lovells Athletic on Boxing Day 1934.

===Post-War===
At the end of World War II with league football returning to normality, Llanelli AFC returned to the 1st Division of the Welsh League for 1945–46 season and continued in this vein until the 1950 season when with the boom of returning fixtures to a nation starved of highly charged competitive football Llanelli AFC once again gained a place in the prestigious Southern League, together with an influx of Scottish League footballers including one John (Jock) Stein who was to find fame with Glasgow Celtic as a player and manager and a respected manager of both Leeds United and the Scottish National team. Their immediate impact was again one of success gaining FA Cup prowess verses Bristol Rovers in a Third round tie replay in 1950–51 season and before losing in a second replay and a Second Round encounter with Colchester United in 1952–53 season and Northampton Town in the next, but as ever problems were to beset the club once more. Falling gates, indifferent seasons meant fewer people through the turnstiles and by 1958 they had to seek re-election to both the Southern and Welsh League. They were granted a stay in the Southern League whilst had to be relegated in the Welsh League Division II (West). But a shock to the system was to be suffered when the Welsh FA refused to sanction their stay in the Southern League and they were left in limbo with an all-time low for their future for the 1958–59 season. Under the astute managership of Wilf Grant an England B International, promotion was gained in that season and at least they were back in the higher echelon of Welsh League football. Despite their achievements and an upsurge in their finances and an open door to Southern League once again the Welsh FA spurned their pleas after being accepted and they remained &#x27;in situ&#x27; in this league until the advent of the League of Wales in 1992–93 season when they became founder members.

===League of Wales Era===
After an initial successful season the club fell away once more, again due to financial constraints and by the end of the 1995–96 season were relegated once again to the Welsh League. It took a further four years for them to achieve promotion, gaining a place in the League of Wales as runners-up to Ton Pentre who had spurned their right as champions in season 1999–2000. Following their return to the League of Wales the club had a see-saw existence. In 2003, the club lost its league status, but a successful campaign back in the Welsh League brought a prompt return of Premiership football to Steboneath Park. Disagreements over the playing budget led to the resignation of promotion-winning manager, Neil O&#x27;Brien and chairman Robert Jones turned to former Cardiff boss Eddie May. But a disastrous nine-match losing start to the campaign saw Nick Tucker arrive from Taffs Well to take over in mid-October 2004. The Reds gained their first win of the season at the 11th attempt and by the end of the season had hauled themselves into 14th position, a remarkable recovery. Summer 2005 saw the first full-time footballer at Stebonheath since the Jock Stein era of the 1950s, with eight professionals under Spanish director of football, Lucas Cazorla Luque. Although the Spaniard parted company midway through the season, the Reds went on to finish runners-up and clinch a first-ever place in Europe under manager Peter Nicholas. They became one of the few Welsh clubs to progress past the first round in Europe, beating Swedish outfit Gefle IF, going out bravely in the next round to Danish giants, Odense BK 6–1 on aggregate. Their European exertions affected their league campaign, but despite a mid-season slump, they rallied in the closing stages to clinch third place and an InterToto Cup spot. The Reds then enjoyed a superb season in 2007/8, clinching their first-ever Welsh Premier title with three games to go and a first appearance in the UEFA Champions League, where they lost to Latvian champions FK Ventspils 4–1 on aggregate, after winning the home leg 1–0. Failure to repeat the feat in the following campaign resulted in the dismissal of manager Nicholas after four years at the helm, he was replaced by veteran defender Andy Legg. Legg&#x27;s first game in charge was the 1–0 victory over Scottish Premier League side, Motherwell. The Reds lost the return leg 3–0. Legg guided Llanelli to their first ever Welsh cup win by beating Bangor City 4–1 at Parc Y Scarlets, Llanelli.

===Reformation===
The club were wound up in April 2013 over an unpaid tax debt amounting to £21,000. Distraught manager Bob Jeffries thought there was only one man to save the club and started making calls to local celebrity multi-millionaire David Craddock, Director of Davies Craddock Limited. David has an endless list of contacts in the football world and is often seen around Britain in VIP rooms of professional clubs. Weekly calls turned into daily calls which he answered in his very busy schedule and when Mr Craddock had a tour of the Stadium and met FAW’s Neil Dymock, he felt ready to take on the mission. 
They were reformed as Llanelli Town later that year and were placed in the Welsh Football League Division Three for the start of the 2013–14 season. They are considered by the FAW to be a direct continuation of the same club. In the First season 2013/14 Llanelli Town finished 6th in Welsh League Division 3 and the following season they finished as Champions 2014/15 and rose to play in Division 2.In the third season 2015/16 they finished in 7th place. The pitchside first aider Rebecca Conibear provided home and away support for the first team. Then suddenly Manager Bob Jeffrey was headhunted to take up a managers position in the USA, so chairman David Craddock consulted with the club coach David Bowen and Sec Neil Dymock and approached Ex Player Andy Hill who agreed to become the new manager for the 2016/17 season. That Season Llanelli Town won the Double ( league Champions and League Cup Winners ) In 2017/18 their great success continued when they won the Welsh League Div. 1 title and narrowly lost another Welsh League Cup Final. At this stage most of the players, supporters and Committee wanted to enter the Welsh Premier League, unfortunately due to business commitments David Craddock resigned as Chairman, but continued his interest to become Honorary Club President, a position he still holds.

Llanelli Town A.F.C. Crest History

==Stadium==

The club&#x27;s home ground is Stebonheath Park, which has a capacity of 3,700. In recent years, The Reds have played numerous European games away from their home ground due to the limited seating capacity. Games have been played at Stradey Park, the former home of the Llanelli Scarlets rugby team, The Liberty Stadium in Swansea, Richmond Park, Carmarthen and Parc y Scarlets, Llanelli.

The first ground improvement started in the summer of 2008 by building a seated stand to accommodate 300 supporters. This takes the Stebonheath Park seated capacity to 1,003 – therefore making it a UEFA-compliant stadium for European football.

== Llanelli in Europe ==

===2006–07 UEFA Cup===
Llanelli&#x27;s first ever game in Europe was against Swedish team Gefle IF. Going a goal down early on in the game at the Swedish national stadium, Llanelli rallied and won the game 2–1 thanks to a debut goal from Rhys Griffiths and a goal from Jacob Mingorance. The return leg was played at Stradey Park in front of a crowd of 5,000, it finished 0–0. The draw for the second qualifying round put them up against Danish side Odense Boldklub. The Reds lost the away leg 1–0. The home leg was played at Swansea&#x27;s Liberty stadium, Antonio Corbishierio put the Reds 1–0 up on the night to bring the aggregate scores level, Odense destroyed Llanelli&#x27;s hopes of progression by running out 5–1 winners on the night and 6–1 on aggregate.

===2007–08 UEFA Intertoto Cup===
Llanelli qualified for the Intertoto Cup after finishing third in the Welsh Premier League behind The New Saints and Rhyl. The Reds travelled to the Lithuanian capital Vilnius for the first leg of the first-round game against FK Vėtra. Llanelli started the game well, even with a severely depleted squad they managed to take the lead with a fine volley by Andrew Mummford, the brave Reds side went on to lose the game 3–1. A magnificent return leg played at Carmarthen&#x27;s Richmond Park, saw Llanelli come agonizingly close to qualifying. They took the game from 3–2 down at half time to score a last minute goal to make it 5–3, unfortunately there was not enough time for Llanelli to grab a winner, they went out on away goals with an aggregate score of 6–6. Talismanic striker, Rhys Griffiths bagged a hat trick, Wyn Thomas and Andy Legg got the other two goals.

===2008–09 UEFA Champions League===
Llanelli qualified for the UEFA Champions League after winning the Welsh Premier League. The Reds were drawn against FK Ventspils of Latvia in the first qualifying round. In a close match at a sell out Stebonheath Park, Llanelli ran out 1–0 winners thanks to a goal from defender, Stuart Jones. The Reds then went to Latvia to try to defend this slender lead. Llanelli could not repeat their heroics of the previous week and lost the game 4–0 to bow out 4–1 on aggregate.

===2009–10 UEFA Europa League===
Llanelli&#x27;s first appearance in the newly formatted Europa League saw them drawn against Scottish Premier League side, Motherwell. The game was played at Airdrie&#x27;s stadium with a strong contingent making the long journey north from South Wales. The Red&#x27;s pulled off a major shock by beating the SPL side 1–0 with a first half goal by Stuart Jones. The return leg, which was played at Parc Y Scarlets was a different story. Motherwell, backed by 3000 travelling fans defeated the Reds comfortably, 3–0.

===2010–11 UEFA Europa League===
A second-placed finish in Andy Legg&#x27;s first season as manager saw Llanelli play European football for the 5th consecutive season. They were drawn against Lithuanian minnows FK Tauras Tauragein the first qualifying round. The first leg, which was played in front of a sell out Steboneath Park crowd finished 2–2, centre backs Wyn Thomas and Stuart Jones got Llanelli&#x27;s goals, Chris Holloway was also sent off and handed a 2 match ban. The second leg was played at the Lithuanian national football stadium, Tauras took the lead due to some poor defending only for Chris Llewellyn to equalise. Llanelli again conceded from some poor defending, this time from a corner. The battling Reds side equalised once again, a ball over the top led to Jason Bowen beating the offside trap, he raced clear and neatly slid the ball past the Tauras keeper. With extra time fast approaching, Llanelli had Rhys Griffiths and Craig Moses sent off, somewhat controversially. The Tauras players seemed to make a meal with every challenge. Extra time proved too much for the tired Reds side as Tauras ran out 3–2 winners on the night and 5–4 on aggregate.

===2011–12 UEFA Europa League===
Llanelli were drawn against Dinamo Tbilisi. The first leg was played at Parc Y Scarlets. Llanelli, who were missing 5 key players, stunned the Georgians by taking the game 2–1, with a brace coming from Jordan Follows. Tbilisi pulled a goal back in stoppage time with a penalty. The Reds approached the second leg in with confidence, key players returning and a 2–1 advantage. Hopes of progressing were quickly dashed as a rampant Tbilisi side knocked in 5 goals without reply. Llanelli went out 6–2 on aggregate.

<doc id="1219461" wikidata="Q2527743" url="?curid=1219461" title="J. Howard Marshall">
<text>James Howard Marshall II (January 24, 1905 – August 4, 1995) was an American businessman, government official, lawyer, and legal scholar. He was involved with and invested in the American petroleum industry via his academic, government and commercial endeavors. He owned 16 percent of Koch Industries and was married to American model Anna Nicole Smith during the last 14 months of his life. His estate became the subject of protracted litigation, which was reviewed by the Supreme Court in &quot;Marshall v. Marshall&quot; and &quot;Stern v. Marshall&quot;. The court kept the will and testament intact and substantially all of the assets in Marshall&#x27;s estate wound up in trusts for the benefit of his daughter-in-law, Elaine Tettemer Marshall, and her family.

== Early life and education ==
Born in the Germantown section of Philadelphia, and raised a Quaker, J. Howard Marshall II attended George School, a private high school in Newtown, Pennsylvania, and then studied liberal arts at Haverford College, both Quaker institutions, graduating in 1926. While at George School and Haverford, he edited the school newspapers, captained the debate teams, was an All American soccer player, and played competitive tennis under the instruction of professional Bill Tilden. He graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Yale Law School in 1931. At Yale, he was case editor of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; and studied with law and economics pioneer Walton Hale Hamilton.

== Careers ==
Upon graduation, from 1931 to 1933, he served as an Assistant Dean at Yale Law School and instructed courses in business, finance and procedure, while also publishing articles as a member of the influential legal realism school of thought. He worked with future Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas on an article titled &quot;A Factual Study of Bankruptcy Administration and Some Suggestions&quot;, published in 1932. Along with Norman Meyers, he published two articles titled &quot;Legal Planning of Petroleum Production&quot; in 1931. These studies offered an alternative to the then-prevailing practices of controlled production in the petroleum industry, which were leading to dramatic boom-bust cycles. They gained the interest of the government, as many of the supporters of the New Deal were supporters of legal realism.

In 1933, Marshall left Yale to become the Assistant Solicitor at the Department of the Interior under Harold L. Ickes. He authored the Code of Fair Competition for the Petroleum Industry (1933), and the Connally Hot Oil Act of 1935 after the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision to strike down the National Industrial Recovery Act. It revived legislation that regulated the flow of oil between states to protect the industry from &quot;contraband oil&quot; in order to stabilize falling prices. While Ickes originally considered having the government set a price floor for oil, Marshall got Ickes to sign off on a plan to require certificates of clearance for legally produced oil shipped in interstate commerce.

In 1935, he left government service to become the special counsel to Kenneth R. Kingsbury, the president of Standard Oil of California (now Chevron Corporation) in San Francisco. In 1937, he became a partner at Pillsbury Madison Sutro (now Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman), which was the company&#x27;s outside counsel. In 1941, he was called back to Washington, D.C. during World War II as Solicitor of the Petroleum Administration for War, helping develop U.S. energy policy during the war, including the Cole Pipeline Act of 1941, and later as a member of the Committee on Reparations and the American Petroleum Institute. In 1944, after developing a relationship with Paul G. Blazer, he moved to Ashland, Kentucky and became Vice Chairman and President of Ashland Oil and Refining Co. (now Ashland Inc.).

In 1946, he drafted the executive order creating the National Petroleum Council (US). In 1952, he became Executive Vice President at Signal Oil &amp; Gas under Samuel B. Mosher. In 1961, he became President of Union Texas Petroleum and moved to Houston. In 1967, he became Executive Vice President of Allied Chemical (now Honeywell). He was also a director of Coastal Corporation. In 1984, he formed Marshall Petroleum, which was primarily a holding company for his interest in Koch Industries.

=== Koch Industries ===
In 1952, Marshall co-founded Great Northern Oil, which, in 1955, built an oil refinery in Rosemount, Minnesota that could refine heavy, sour Canadian crude oil. In 1959, Fred Koch acquired a 35% interest in Great Northern Oil for $5 million. Union Oil acquired a majority interest in Great Northern and attempted to take over the company, but Marshall and Koch, who wanted to keep their assets in private hands, blocked the takeover. In 1969, after buying out Union Oil, Charles Koch, who shared a similar business philosophy with Marshall, swapped a stake in Koch Industries for the rest of Marshall&#x27;s shares in Great Northern Oil.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages and relationships ===
Marshall married Eleanor Pierce in 1931 and divorced in 1961. They had two sons together: J. Howard Marshall III (born February 6, 1936) and E. Pierce Marshall (January 12, 1939 – June 20, 2006). His second marriage, to Bettye Bohannon, lasted from 1961 until her death from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 1991.

In 1982, he met &quot;Lady&quot; Diane Walker at a strip club and offered to marry her if his wife Betty, who had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, were to die. Over several years, Marshall gave Walker $15 million worth of jewelry and other gifts. Walker died in 1995 at age 51 due to complications from facelift surgery. The gifts became subject to scrutiny by the Internal Revenue Service since gift taxes were not paid; Marshall claimed that the gifts were instead &quot;consulting fees&quot;.

In 1994, at the age of 89, he married 26-year-old model Anna Nicole Smith. This was his third marriage and her second marriage. Their marriage lasted until his death 14 months later.

=== Eldest son left out of estate ===
In 1980, when Marshall&#x27;s eldest son, J. Howard Marshall III, sided with Bill Koch, Frederick R. Koch and other collateral family members in dispute with Charles Koch and David H. Koch over making Koch Industries a public company and paying dividends, Marshall purchased back company stock from his son, given previously as a gift, for $8 million, considered to be a premium price, and removed the eldest son from his will and testament. Conversely, during the same dispute, his youngest son E. Pierce Marshall sided with his father, and that son received substantially all of Marshall&#x27;s estate, valued at $1.6 billion at the time of his death.

=== Death and ensuing lawsuits ===
On August 4, 1995, Marshall died of pneumonia at age 90 in Houston, Texas. Following Marshall&#x27;s death, Anna Nicole Smith (who died on February 8, 2007) became involved in a court battle with her former stepson, E. Pierce Marshall (who died on June 20, 2006). J. Howard&#x27;s will and trust did not include Anna Nicole or J. Howard&#x27;s other son, J. Howard Marshall III. Anna Nicole and J. Howard III both sought to overturn the will and trust. In 2001, they both lost their cases during a six-month Texas state court jury trial.

During the probate proceedings, Smith declared bankruptcy in California and was awarded $474 million as a sanction for E. Pierce Marshall’s alleged misconduct in discovery. In 2002, the bankruptcy judgment was vacated and Smith’s award was reduced to $88 million in a United States district court in California. In December 2004, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the District Court decision under the probate exception, ruling that the federal courts lacked subject matter jurisdiction over state probate matters. The Ninth Circuit decision also affirmed the primacy of Texas Probate decision which determined that no misconduct had taken place and that Smith was not one of J. Howard Marshall&#x27;s heirs. However, on May 1, 2006, the Supreme Court of the United States in &quot;Marshall v. Marshall&quot; reversed the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s decision regarding the probate exception, allowing Smith another opportunity to pursue her claims in federal court. The case was remanded to the Ninth Circuit for adjudication of the remaining appellate issues. On June 25, 2009, the same three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit heard oral arguments on the remaining appellate issues. On March 19, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its second opinion on remand, finding in favor of E. Pierce Marshall, that the California Bankruptcy Court did not have jurisdiction and the California Federal District Court was precluded from reviewing matters already decided in the Texas Probate Court.

On September 28, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court again agreed to hear the case. On June 23, 2011, the United States Supreme court decided the case in a 5–4 decision in favor of the Marshall family (now styled &quot;Stern v. Marshall&quot; 10-179). The majority of the Court decided Congress cannot constitutionally authorize non-Article III bankruptcy judges final order jurisdiction on state law based counterclaims to proofs of claim which are not necessary to resolve the claim itself.

Marshall&#x27;s eldest son, J. Howard Marshall III, lost his case in Texas probate court and also lost a counterclaim against him for fraud with malice. The jury originally awarded E. Pierce Marshall $35 million in damages but the probate court reduced that amount to $10 million. J. Howard Marshall III then filed for bankruptcy in California and was discharged by the same bankruptcy judge that had administered Smith&#x27;s bankruptcy. This decision was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

=== Dispute over pledge to alma mater ===
In 1976, Marshall pledged $4 million to his alma mater, Haverford College. However, by the time of his death in 1995, Marshall had only contributed $2 million. Haverford sued his estate in a Houston probate court; in April 2003, a jury found that Haverford had not been injured because it had not relied on Marshall&#x27;s pledges.

<doc id="1219463" wikidata="Q946744" url="?curid=1219463" title="Kryštof Harant">
<text>Kryštof Harant of Polžice and Bezdružice (, 1564 – 21 June 1621) was a Czech nobleman, traveler, humanist, soldier, writer and composer. He joined the Protestant Bohemian Revolt in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown against the House of Habsburg that led to Thirty Years&#x27; War. Following the victory of Catholic forces in the Battle of White Mountain, Harant was executed in the mass Old Town Square execution by the Habsburgs.

As a composer he represented the school of Franco-Flemish polyphony in Bohemia. Harant is also noted for his expedition to the Middle East summarized in a travel book &quot;Journey from Bohemia to the Holy Land, by way of Venice and the Sea&quot; (1608).

==Life==
Harant was born at Klenová Castle, near Klatovy, western Bohemia. From 1576 he studied singing and counterpoint as a member of a local court band at Innsbruck, at the court of Archduke Ferdinand II, learning 7 languages, discovering his talent for music and the other arts and his interest in history, geography and political science. He returned to Bohemia in 1584 in a vain attempt to get a post at the court of Rudolf II, and so enlisted as a soldier, participating in the 1593 and 1597 campaign against the Turks. In 1589 he married Eva Czernin von Chudenitz – they had two children before she died in 1597. Kryštof married two more times. Leaving his relation Lidmila Markvartová z Hrádku to raise the children, in 1598 and 1599 he went to the Holy Land as a pilgrim, wishing to visit the Holy Sepulchre with Eva&#x27;s brother Hermann. He wrote about his experiences in a book entitled &quot;Journey from Bohemia to the Holy Land, by way of Venice and the Sea&quot; which was published in Prague in 1608.

After his return, in 1599, he was given a post in the emperor&#x27;s court and simultaneously raised to the peerage, though both his children died that year. In 1601 he was made an advisor to the court of Rudolf and his successor Matthias and part of the imperial chambers. When the imperial court moved to Vienna, Harant was granted the Pecka Castle and dedicated himself for some years to music, becoming the most important Bohemian composer of the time. During 1614-15 he travelled to Spain with a diplomatic mission.

In 1618 he converted to Protestantism, returned to Prague, joined the forces arrayed against the Catholics as an artillery officer and fought on the side of the Bohemian states during the uprisings. In 1619 he became the commissioner of the military unit of Mladá Boleslav, Kouřim and Hradec Králové, and was involved in a 50,000 strong regiment in the unsuccessful march on imperial Vienna. During the rebellion he bombarded the imperial palace in Vienna—with the emperor inside—which proved to be a bad move.

After Frederick V succeeded to the Palatinate, he was appointed as a privy councillor and president of the Bohemian chamber, though this career was short-lived. After the defeat of the Protestant Czechs at the Battle of White Mountain in 1620 by the combined arms of Maximilian and Tilly, the subsequent sack of Prague by Imperial troops, and the assumption of office by the Emperor Ferdinand II, Harant withdrew to his castle. He was captured there by Albrecht von Wallenstein, arrested and taken to Prague, unsuccessfully pleading for mercy. As one of the twenty-seven Bohemian noble rebels, he was condemned to death and beheaded on 21 June 1621 by Jan Mydlář in the Old Town Square, Prague, along with all the other leaders of the insurrection.

His widow Anna Salomena (born von Horschitz, who had married Kryštof) in 1625 married Hermann Czernin von Chudenitz, Eva&#x27;s brother.

== Music and influence ==
Harant&#x27;s music was conservative, and in the style of the Netherlands composers of the previous generation. He used archaic techniques such as cantus firmus mass composition. Seven separate works survived, all sacred vocal compositions (the rest were lost when his property was confiscated as being that of an executed traitor). One of his pieces is a cantus firmus mass based on a madrigal by Marenzio (&quot;Missa quinis vocibus super Dolorosi martir&quot;)—a musical irony in that it combines a technique which went out of fashion a hundred years before with the music of one of Italy&#x27;s most popular and progressive composers.

Harant had a reputation as a fine instrumentalist and singer in addition to being a composer. In another irony, one of his Roman Catholic masses was performed in 1620, just before his execution, in a Catholic church in Prague, to great ceremony.

==Musical works==
* Missa quinis vocibus super &quot;Dolorosi martir&quot; – to the theme of madrigal by L. Marenzio &quot;Dolorosi martir, fieri tormenti&quot;. The mass was published in 1905-6 by Czech musicologist Zdeněk Nejedlý.
* Motet &quot;Maria Kron, die Engel schon&quot; – for five voices, to the German text, 1604
* Motet &quot;Qui confidunt in Domino&quot; – for six voices, composed in Jerusalem, 1598

Fragments:
*&quot;Dejž tobě Pán Bůh štěstí&quot; – Czech wedding song
*&quot;Dies est laetitiae&quot; – an arrangement of a Christmas song for eight voices
*Motet &quot;Psallite Domino in cythara&quot; – for five voices
*Motet &quot;Qui vult venire post me&quot; – for five voices

The complete works of Kryštof Harant were published in 1956, by Czechoslovak publishing house KLHU.

<doc id="1219464" wikidata="Q7087898" url="?curid=1219464" title="Oliver Twist (1997 film)">
<text>Oliver Twist is a 1997 American made-for-television film based on Charles Dickens&#x27;s 1838 novel of the same title. The film was directed by Tony Bill, written by Monte Merrick and Stephen Sommers, and produced by Walt Disney Television. It stars Richard Dreyfuss, Elijah Wood, David O&#x27;Hara, and Alex Trench as the titular character.

As in most film adaptations of this novel, Monks, Oliver&#x27;s half-brother, is not in the film. There are other changes as well. The bookseller does not testify for Oliver at his trial, but Rose Maylie does. Most of the changes are minor, but a major one is that when Oliver is taken in by Fagin&#x27;s gang he himself, and not the Widow Corney, is in possession of his mother&#x27;s locket, and Oliver has come to London, not just to seek his fortune, but to discover his true identity. Mr. Bumble, Corney&#x27;s assistant, is only in one scene, and the Widow Corney&#x27;s role is expanded. As in the musical and the 1968 film &quot;Oliver!&quot;, Nancy is murdered at London Bridge, not in her bedroom as in the novel. Fagin is not sentenced to death but can escape.

&quot;Oliver Twist&quot; premiered on ABC as part of &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; on November 16, 1997.

==Plot==
A woman gives birth to a boy in an orphanage owned by the Widow Corney, dying as she does so. She leaves him a locket, containing a portrait of her mother, which Corney takes. Her assistant, Mr. Bumble, names the child Oliver Twist from his rotating alphabetical list of names. Six years later, Oliver, now working in the orphanage, requests to see his locket. Corney says he can have it when he&#x27;s twelve. Another Six years later, Oliver is forced on the night before his 12th birthday into drawing straws at dinner for who has to ask Corney for more food. After drawing the shortest one, she throws him out of the workhouse for daring to ask her such a question, without his locket. He returns at night to steal it and heads out to London.
Once there, Oliver, hungry, is stopped from stealing an apple by a young man named Jack Dawkins, also known as the Artful Dodger, who explains that he&#x27;s a professional thief and proud of his work. He offers to take Oliver in with the band of boys he lives with and his boss, Fagin, an old and sly man who teaches the group how to steal. Upon arriving, Fagin takes Oliver&#x27;s locket as Oliver is dressed and welcomed. Oliver also meets Bill Sikes-a thief and murderer to whom Fagin owes an enormous sum-and his kind girlfriend, Nancy. Dodger begins to teach Oliver about the art of thievery that same day. At night, Oliver catches Fagin admiring his treasure which he keeps hidden in a box and is threatened with death if he steals from it. However, when asked, Fagin admits that it is where he is keeping Oliver&#x27;s locket. Three months later, Oliver is sent out to pick his first pocket as Dodger orchestrates the plan. While stealing a watch, Oliver is caught red-handed. Thinking quickly, Dodger grabs the watch instead and runs off with Oliver, but he escapes while Oliver is mistakenly identified as the thief. Dodger quietly hurries to court to try to rescue him, where Mr. Brownlow (the victim)&#x27;s niece, Rose, has testified for Oliver that he was not the boy, and Oliver refused to name the culprit. Rose offers Oliver to be a guest at their mansion in Grosvenor Square. There, he sees a portrait on the wall of the same lady his locket contains. When told it is Mr. Brownlow&#x27;s late wife, and that they had one daughter who always carried a gold locket with that portrait, he and Rose realize that it means he may be Mr. Brownlow&#x27;s grandson and her cousin. 
Meanwhile, Dodger manages to locate Oliver. Deciding that he knows too much about the group to be left on his own, Sikes convinces Fagin to let him kidnap Oliver with Dodger and Nancy&#x27;s help. However, Nancy does so unwillingly, and Dodger refuses to put Oliver in the bag intended to be used for his abduction. Back at the hideout, Oliver confirms that he let nothing slip about the group, but tells Nancy that he loved the Brownlows. Nancy tries to return Oliver to the mansion, but is seen in the street by Sikes and forced to go back. Suspicious, Sikes hires Dodger to follow her the next day. Sikes later weasels out of Oliver that he knows where Fagin&#x27;s treasure is kept. At night, he forces him to go to the Brownlow&#x27;s to steal at gunpoint. Inside, Oliver purposely drops the bag of silver he&#x27;s holding to wake Rose. Sikes and Oliver escape, but Mr. Brownlow sees Oliver, confirming his suspicion that he is a thief. Dodger encourages Oliver to escape if he gets the chance. 
The next day, Nancy goes to the Brownlows unknowingly followed by Dodger. She tells them of Oliver&#x27;s abduction and agrees to return him at London Bridge at midnight. Dodger, threatened by Sikes, admits of overhearing the agreement. Still wanting Oliver to be free, he takes him to the bridge himself to throw Sikes off the trail, but Nancy, unaware of Dodger&#x27;s plan, is murdered there by a furious Sikes who accuses her of double-crossing him. Meanwhile, Oliver has gone back to the hideout to retrieve his locket. Sikes walks in the door and sees the treasure. As he attempts to flee with it himself, Fagin arrives, followed by Dodger who stops Sikes, furious at Nancy&#x27;s murder. Nancy&#x27;s dead body has been found, and the police follow Sikes&#x27;s dog to the hideout. Sikes locks the door, takes the box and Oliver (as a hostage) up to the roof, and leaves Dodger and Fagin below. On the roof, Oliver grabs the box from Sikes, who turns on him and slips. His neck gets caught in a coil of rope, and he is hung by the noose as the police watch. Dodger is arrested for his pilfering, and while Fagin negotiates with Oliver for the locket, ultimately returns it. The locket finally proves that Oliver is in fact Mr. Brownlow’s grandson by the matching of the portraits. After bidding a fond farewell to the arrested Dodger promising to see him again someday, Oliver is last seen sleeping happily in his new home.

<text>Arthur Forbes Gordon Kilby (3 February 1885 – 25 September 1915) was an English officer in the British Army during the First World War, and recipient of the Victoria Cross.

==Early life==
Forbes was born on 3 February 1885 in East Hayes, Cheltenham, the only son of Sandford and Alice F. Kilby, He was educated at Bilton Grange near Rugby and Winchester College. He graduated from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in July 1905, and was commissioned into the South Staffordshire Regiment.

==Military career==
Kilby was promoted to Captain on 1 April 1910 when he was only 25. An accomplished linguist, he was fluent in Hungarian and German, and when war broke out in August 1914 he was learning Spanish. He was posted to the British Expeditionary Force in France and Flanders with the 2nd Battalion, The South Staffordshire Regiment during the First World War.

Kilby was 30 years old, and a captain when he performed an act for which he was awarded the VC and during which he died. He was killed in action on 25 September 1915 whilst leading his company attacking enemy positions near Cuinchy, on the Le Bassee Canal, on the first day of the Battle of Loos. Kilby&#x27;s extreme heroism and gallantry during this attack was noted and he was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross on 30 March 1916.

===Citation===
==Legacy==
Kilby&#x27;s heroism was acknowledged by the German defenders who erected a memorial cross at the location of his death. His body was eventually found on 19 February 1929 and interred at Arras Road Cemetery, Roclincourt, Plot III, Row N, Grave 27.

In 1919 a memorial was placed in St Nicholas&#x27;s Chapel, York Minster; which was inscribed with details of Arthur Kilby&#x27;s deeds and awards, and contained a bust of him surmounted by the family coat-of-arms. His name is also listed on a war memorial in St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church, Peasholme Green, York.

In 2012, Kilby&#x27;s Victoria Cross, along with another awarded to Private Sidney Godley, the very first VC recipient of World War I, was sold at a London auction for £276,000 each to Lord Ashcroft. Captain Kilby&#x27;s medal are now part of the Lord Ashcroft Medal Collection in the Imperial War Museum in London.

<text>The Forgotten Soldier (1965), originally published in French as &quot;Le soldat oublié&quot;, is an account by Guy Sajer (pseudonym of Guy Mouminoux) of his experiences as a German soldier on the Eastern Front during World War II. With reference to the author&#x27;s ambiguous relationship to war, the book has been called &quot;the account of a disastrous love affair with war and with the army that, of all modern armies, most loved war&quot;, being written with the &quot;admiration of a semi-outsider&quot;. The English edition was translated by Lily Emmet.

==Personal narrative==
Sajer wrote that &quot;The Forgotten Soldier&quot; was intended as a personal narrative, stressing the non-technical and anecdotal nature of his book. In a 1997 letter to US Army historian Douglas Nash, he stated that, &quot;Apart from the emotions I brought out, I confess my numerous mistakes. That is why I would like that this book may not be used under [any] circumstances as a strategic or chronological reference.&quot;

After reading Sajer&#x27;s latest letter, one of his staunchest critics—&quot;Großdeutschland&quot; Veteran&#x27;s Association leader Helmuth Spaeter—recanted his original suspicions of Sajer, noting &quot;I have underestimated Herr Sajer and my respect for him has greatly increased. I am myself more of a writer who deals with facts and specifics, much less like one who writes in a literary way. For this reason, I was very skeptical towards the content of his book.&quot;

The British writer Alan Clark, author of &quot;Barbarossa: The Russian-German Conflict 1941–45&quot;, refers to Sajer&#x27;s book in his &quot;Diaries&quot; as a book &quot;to which AC [Alan Clark] often turned&quot;. The book was considered by the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College to be an accurate &quot;roman à clef&quot; and has remained on its recommended reading list for World War II, along with other historical novels. It is also on the recommended reading list of the Commandant of the United States Marines Corps.

==Reviews and critical commentary==
The book was reviewed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by J. Glenn Gray in 1971. He reports the &quot;book is painful to get through. But it is also difficult to put down and is worth the cost in horror that reading it entails.&quot; Other reviews from 1971 include &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; magazine, and &quot;The New Republic&quot; by James Walt. Walt says the book is not anti-war but an accounting of those soldiers caught up in events bigger than themselves.

Other more recent English reviewers include James Varner in &quot;Military Review&quot; in 2009. Jason S. Ridler in &quot;War in the Precious Graveyard: Death through the Eyes of Guy Sajer&quot;, from the journal &quot;War, Literature, and the Arts&quot; suggests that Sajer idealized death in battle, and Sajer&#x27;s reactions to corpses in the book reveals survivor guilt.

==Criticism==
The accuracy and authenticity of the book have been disputed by some historians. Some of the details Sajer mentions appear to be incorrect, while other are impossible to verify due to the lack of surviving witnesses and documents.

The most frequently cited inaccuracy is Sajer&#x27;s statement that, after being awarded the coveted Grossdeutschland Division cuff title, he and a friend were ordered to sew it on their left sleeves, when it is well established that this specific unit always wore their cuff titles on the right sleeve. Edwin Kennedy wrote that this error was &quot;unimaginable&quot; for a former member of such an elite German unit. Sajer also discusses campaign locations in vague terms and never with specific dates. For example, he asserts that during the summer of 1942 he was briefly assigned to a Luftwaffe training unit in Chemnitz commanded by famed Stuka ace Hans-Ulrich Rudel, but according to Rudel himself, his training unit was actually in Graz, Austria, during the whole of 1942. Sajer mentions seeing &quot;the formidable Focke-Wulf [...] 195s, which could soar up quickly,&quot; taking off from an airfield outside Berlin, when no such aircraft ever existed (a Focke-Wulf projekt 195, a heavy transport, was in the pipeline, but never got off the drawing board). Finally, the names of most of Sajer&#x27;s companions and leaders do not appear on official rolls in the Bundesarchiv, nor are they known to the &quot;Grossdeutschland&quot; Veterans Association, whose leader, Helmuth Spaeter, was one of the first to question whether Sajer actually served in the Grossdeutschland Division as he claimed.

However, some authors and other Großdeutschland veterans have testified to the book&#x27;s historical plausibility, even if they cannot speak to the specific events in the book. Lieutenant Hans Joachim Schafmeister-Berckholtz, who served in the Grossdeutschland Division during the same period as Sajer, confirmed in a letter that he had read the book and considered it an accurate overall account of the Division&#x27;s battles in the East, while also noting that he remembered a &quot;Landser&quot; named Sajer in his (5th) Panzergrenadier company, the same company number Sajer mentions being assigned to (though there was more than one &quot;5th Company&quot; in the Division).

Sajer himself struck back against the critics, claiming that &quot;The Forgotten Soldier&quot; was intended as his own personal recollections of an intensely chaotic period in German military history, and not an attempt at a serious historical study of World War II: &quot;You ask me questions of chronology, situations, dates, and unimportant details. Historians and archivists have harassed me for a long time with their rude questions. All of this is unimportant. Other authors and high-ranking officers could respond to your questions better than I. I never had the intention to write a historical reference book; rather, I wrote about my innermost emotional experiences as they relate to the events that happened to me in the context of the Second World War.&quot;

==Film rights==
Dutch film director Paul Verhoeven has discussed with Sajer the possibility of turning &quot;The Forgotten Soldier&quot; into a film.

<text>Major Matthew Fontaine Maury Meiklejohn VC (; 27 November 1870 – 4 July 1913) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==

Meiklejohn was the son of Professor John Meiklejohn, of the University of St. Andrews, and was educated at Madras College and Fettes College. He was a 28 year old captain in the 2nd Battalion, The Gordon Highlanders, British Army during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place at the Battle of Elandslaagte for which he was awarded the VC.
His VC action cost him his arm which was amputated. Despite this, he remained in the army as a staff officer. He was promoted to the substantive rank of captain in the Gordon Highlanders on 22 January 1902, and was seconded as a staff officer to Saint Helena. He later achieved the rank of major.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Gordon Highlanders Museum along with his campaign medals.

==Death==

His death occurred when his horse bolted while he was riding in Hyde Park. With only one arm to control the horse, he chose to steer it into some cast iron railings, to avoid a nursemaid who was pushing a baby in her pram. This was considered an act of high bravery and cost him his life. He died on 4 July 1913 and was given a hero&#x27;s funeral in Brookwood Cemetery. He is commemorated by a plaque on the wall of Hyde Park Barracks, London.

<doc id="1219487" wikidata="Q2668909" url="?curid=1219487" title="Cross of Independence">
<text>Cross of Independence () was the second highest Polish military decoration between World Wars I and II. It was awarded to individuals who had fought actively for the independence of Poland, and was released in three classes.

== History ==
The Cross of Independence was established with a decree of the President of Poland of 29 October 1930. It was to be awarded to the people who &quot;laid foundations for the independence of the Fatherland before the World War or during it, as well as during the fights between 1818 and 1921, with the exception of the Polish-Russian War&quot;. After 1938 it was also awarded to people responsible for Trans-Olza&#x27;s annexation by Poland.

Although the cross without the swords was awarded mainly to the civilians, all versions were considered to be military decorations. If awarded to a soldier it was worn before the 4th class of the Polonia Restituta and when awarded to a civilian – before the Volunteer Cross for War (&quot;Medal Ochotniczy za Wojnę&quot;).

The recipients of all grades of the Cross of Independence had a right to be elected to the Senate of Poland, the right to travel by Polish State Railways free of charge and a right to send their children to the schools of their choice free of charge.

== Design ==

Both the Cross and the Medal were designed by professor Mieczysław Kotarbiński and most of the copies were made by Warsaw-based jeweller Wiktor Gontarczyk.

The Cross of Independence had three classes:
# Cross of Independence with Swords (1,818 awarded by 1938)
# Cross of Independence (7,917 awarded by 1938)
# Medal of Independence (51,735 awarded all together)

The cross was 42 by 42 mm, made of gilt bronze. The obverse had a rectangle shield with stylised eagle in bas-relief. The reverse was covered with black enamel and the motto &quot;Bojownikom Niepodległości&quot; (&quot;To the Fighters for Independence&quot;). The version with Swords had two golden swords crossed above the cross.

Medal of Independence was round, 35 mm in diameter and made entirely of bronze. On the obverse there was a symbolic depiction of three Hydras (symbolising three partitioning Powers) stroke with two swords and surrounded by the &quot;Bojownikom Niepodległości&quot; motto. The reverse was plain with letters &quot;RP&quot; in the centre (standing for Rzeczpospolita Polska).

<text>Lance Sergeant Thomas Kenny VC (4 April 1882 − 29 November 1948) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy given to British and Commonwealth forces.

On 4 November 1915 near La Houssoie, France, 33-year-old Kenny performed an act of bravery for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

==Biography==
He was a private in the 13th Battalion, The Durham Light Infantry, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

In thick mist, an officer in charge of a patrol was shot through both thighs. Private Kenny, although repeatedly fired on by the enemy, crawled about for more than an hour with his wounded officer on his back, trying to find his way through the fog to the British trenches. He refused to leave the officer although told several times to do so, and at last, utterly exhausted, left him in a comparatively safe ditch and went for help. He found a rescue party and guided them to the wounded officer who was then brought to safety.

The officer Lt. Philip Brown later died of his wounds.

<text>Siemens Mobile was a German mobile phone manufacturer and a division of Siemens AG. Siemens sold Siemens Mobile to the Taiwan-based BenQ in 2005, subsequently becoming BenQ-Siemens and succeeded by Gigaset. The last Siemens-branded mobile phones, the AL21, A31 and AF51, were released in November 2005.

==History==
The first Siemens mobile phone, the Siemens Mobiltelefon C1, was launched in 1985. In 1994 the Siemens S1 GSM phone was launched. In 1997 Siemens launched the first phone with a colour screen, the Siemens S10, with a screen capable of displaying red, green, blue and white. In the same year Siemens launched the first &quot;outdoor&quot; phone, the Siemens S10 Active, with enhanced shock, dust and splash protection. Siemens launched the first slider phone, the Siemens SL10, in 1999.

Siemens acquired the mobile phone division of Bosch in 2000. In the same year Siemens launched one of the first phones with an MP3 player and external memory card support (MultiMediaCard), the Siemens SL45.

In 2003 Siemens launched its first phone running on the Symbian OS operating system, the Siemens SX1. The phone featured hot swappable MultiMediaCard. In the same year Siemens launched the Xelibri range of fashion phones. In 2005 Siemens launched the first phone with real GPS support, the Siemens SXG75.

As of Q3 2000, Siemens had an 8.6% mobile handset market share, putting it behind Ericsson, Motorola and Nokia. For the calendar year 2003, Siemens was again fourth behind Samsung, Motorola and Nokia, with a figure of 8.5%. In 2004 it decreased to 7.2%. Siemens Mobile was making large losses and plummeting sales at this time. By the first quarter of 2005, market share was down to 5.6% as it fell behind competitors LG and Sony Ericsson. Their Xelibri range of phones, which was the company&#x27;s answer to the fashionable handset trend at the time, became a costly failure.

On 7 June 2005, the Taiwanese company BenQ agreed to acquire the loss-making Siemens Mobile from Siemens, together with exclusive right to use the Siemens trademark on its mobile phones for 5 years. Before transferring the mobile phone subsidiary to BenQ, Siemens invested 250 million euros and wrote down assets amounting to 100 million euros. Siemens also acquired a 2.5% stake in BenQ for 50 million euros. BenQ subsequently released mobile phones under the BenQ-Siemens brand, from its German unit. In 2006 the German unit of BenQ filed for bankruptcy.

Siemens restarted the production of mobile phones under the Gigaset brand name.

In 2007 Alhamra published her second collection of short stories, &quot;Blessings&quot;.

Shah&#x27;s third novel &quot;Slum Child&quot; was published in India by Tranquebar, an imprint of Westland-Tata, in 2010. An Italian-language version was published in 2009 under the title &quot;La Bambina Che Non Poteva Sognare&quot; by Newton Compton Editori in Italy, where it reached number 3 on the paperback bestseller list, and sold more than 20,000 copies. It was published in Spanish by Grijalbo, an imprint of Random House Mondadori, in June 2011.

Shah&#x27;s fourth novel, , was published by Delphinium Books (November 2014) to critical acclaim. It was also published in Italy by Newton Compton as &quot;Il Bambino Che Credeva Nella Liberta&quot; in 2010. For this novel, Shah was awarded the Premio Internazionale in the Un Mondi di Bambini category of the Almalfi Coast Literary Festival in 2010 for translated fiction.

Shah&#x27;s fifth novel &quot;Before She Sleeps&quot;, a feminist dystopian novel, was published by Delphinium Books in 2018. An extract from the novel was featured in the Dawn&#x27;s special 70th anniversary Pakistan edition &quot;Seventy+Seventy&quot;. The novel was praised by Margaret Atwood on Twitter as &quot;a fascinating new angle on &#x27;emotional work&#x27;.&quot; American newspaper &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; it &quot;charged and thrilling.&quot; Before She Sleeps was recognized as part of a new canon of feminist dystopia pioneered by Booker Prize winning author Atwood and relevant to the global fight for women&#x27;s rights and empowerment worldwide, as well as an important part of the #MeToo movement. Shah&#x27;s novel was also considered noteworthy because it stood out from most Western-centric feminist dystopias, describing a futuristic society in the Middle East where women are forced into polygamous marriages by an authoritarian government in a society ravaged by war and disease.

In 2019 Shah contributed an essay, &quot;The Life and Death of Pakistan&#x27;s Sabeen Mahmud&quot;, about the assassination of Pakistan&#x27;s beloved human rights activist Sabeen Mahmud, to the anthology Brave New Words: The Power of Writing Now published by Myriad and edited by Susheila Nasta. The anthology of fifteen specially commissioned essays examining the value of critical thinking and the power of the written word was published to commemorate 35 years of Wasafiri, a UK magazine of international literature. Other contributors to the anthology included Booker Prize winner Bernardine Evaristo, Githa Hariharan, Eva Hoffman, Romesh Gunesekera, James Kelman, Tabish Khair, Kei Miller, Blake Morrison, Mukoma wa Ngugi, Hsiao-Hung Pai, and Marina Warner.

<doc id="1219502" wikidata="Q5342969" url="?curid=1219502" title="Edward Foster (VC)">
<text>Edward Foster VC (4 January 1886 – 22 January 1946) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in Streatham, London on 4 February 1886, Foster worked for Wandsworth Council in South West London as a dustman. On 27 July 1915, during the First World War, he enlisted in the 13th Battalion (Wandsworth) East Surrey Regiment, British Army, and went to France with the battalion in June 1916.

Foster was 31 years old, and a corporal in the 13th East Surreys, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 24 April 1917 at Villers-Plouich, Nord, France, during an attack, the advance was held up in a portion of the village by two machine-guns which were entrenched and strongly covered by wire entanglements. Corporal Foster, who was in charge of two Lewis guns, succeeded in entering the trench and engaging the enemy guns. One of the Lewis guns was lost, but the corporal rushed forward, bombed the enemy and recovered the gun. Then, getting his two guns into action, he killed the enemy gun team and captured their guns.

Foster was also awarded the Médaille Militaire by France.

Foster was discharged from the Army in October 1918 and returned to work with Wandsworth Council. The council, in recognition of his gallant record, promoted him to Dusting Inspector in which capacity he continued to work for twenty-six years. He died suddenly at the age of 60 on 22 January 1946. He is buried in Streatham Cemetery in London where a headstone was erected on his grave in 1997.

His Victoria Cross and other medals were sold by Sotheby&#x27;s on 30 June 1988 for £11,000. His VC is now on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

A footpath in King George&#x27;s Park – Foster&#x27;s Way – is named in Foster&#x27;s honour.

<doc id="1219503" wikidata="Q5254592" url="?curid=1219503" title="Delta Chi">
<text>Delta Chi () is an international Greek letter collegiate social fraternity formed on October 13, 1890, at Cornell University, initially as a professional fraternity for law students. On April 30, 1922, Delta Chi became a general membership social fraternity, eliminating the requirement for men to be studying law, and opening membership to all areas of study. Delta Chi became one of the first international fraternities to abolish &quot;hell week&quot;, when it did so on April 22, 1929. Delta Chi is a charter member of the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC). As of Fall 2019, Delta Chi has initiated over 116,000 members at over 110 Chapters and Colonies, with 34 Alumni Chapters. Its headquarters is in Indianapolis, Indiana.

==History==
===Founding===

According to Frederick Moore Whitney, there were two or three groups working on the idea of a new law fraternity during the spring of 1889. After the class election, there were meetings held in Myron Mckee Crandall&#x27;s apartment as well as in Monroe Marsh Sweetland&#x27;s law office. It is not clear how these two groups came together, though there seem to have been some individuals who had attended both groups.

Over the summer of 1890, many of the details of the organization were worked out by Myron Mckee Crandall, who had stayed in Ithaca until after school opened. In regard to the adoption of the constitution, Albert Sullard Barnes wrote the following in his 1907 &quot;Quarterly&quot; article:

&quot;As I recall it, after refreshing my recollection from the original minutes now in my possession, on the evening of October 13, 1890, six students in the Law School, Brothers John M. Gorham, Thomas J. Sullivan, F.K. Stephens, A.D. Stillman and the writer, together with Myron Crandall and O.L. Potter, graduate students, and Monroe Sweetland, a former Student in the Law School, met in a brother&#x27;s room and adopted the constitution and by-laws, and organized the Delta Chi Fraternity.&quot;

The minutes from that meeting state, &quot;Charter granted to Cornell Chapter,&quot; indicating from the beginning the intent to start a national fraternity.

===Single membership===
In 1909, in Ithaca, New York, the 15th Convention of Delta Chi adopted an amendment to the Constitution prohibiting dual-membership in multiple fraternities.. As a professional law fraternity, Delta Chi had originally allowed members from other general fraternities to join. The change in policy led to the loss of chapters in New York Law, West Virginia, Northwestern and Washington University in St. Louis.

===General fraternity===
During World War I, a majority of the members of the active chapters dropped their college courses and enlisted in the armed forces. Chapter houses became almost deserted, and a convention in August 1917 was skipped. At the end of the war, members returned to the universities to complete their courses. The chapter finances were generally in bad condition as were the houses. Attempting to rebuild, many chapters stretched the recruiting restrictions by initiating men who had no intention of studying law.

Starting in 1919 in Minneapolis at the 20th Convention, the issue of becoming a general fraternity was debated. In 1921 in Columbus, Ohio at the 21st Convention, two amendments were proposed, for and against general membership respectively. For three days votes were held, until (on a swing vote by the Buffalo Alumni Chapter representative), the Wadsworth amendment was adopted. Ratified in 1922, the amendment made Delta Chi a general fraternity, no longer requiring its members to be law students at their respective universities and colleges.

==Founding fathers==

==Philanthropy==

In 2006, the fraternity named the V Foundation as its official philanthropic organization. Since then, Delta Chi has raised over one million dollars for the V foundation.

==Organization of the fraternity==

===Undergraduate officer positions===
Delta Chi chapters and colonies have six permanent officer positions. While each position has strict definitions of responsibility, their duties may vary slightly from group to group.
*A – The &quot;A&quot; is the president of the chapter or colony. He serves as presiding officer at chapter meetings and chapter events.
*B – The &quot;B&quot; is the vice president of the chapter or colony. He schedules and chairs executive committee meetings, and oversees all committees.
*C – The &quot;C&quot; is the secretary of the chapter or colony. He keeps record of chapter or colony meetings, and is responsible for completing necessary paperwork and online forms.
*D – The &quot;D&quot; is the treasurer of the chapter or colony. He is responsible for tracking chapter financial records and files, as well as collecting dues and creating a budget.
*E – The &quot;E&quot; is the historian of the chapter or colony. He is responsible for contacting and communicating with alumni. He also works on chapter or colony newsletters and other publications.
*F – The &quot;F&quot; is the Sergeant at Arms. The &quot;F&quot; works on developing and implementing safety precautions for chapter or colony events.

===Committee positions===
Each chapter and colony is encouraged to have a functioning committee system. Each committee chairman has duties designated by Delta Chi. Committees include subjects such as recruitment, educating new recruits, philanthropy, scholarship, social events, housing, and others.

===Support alumni positions===
*BB – The role of the &quot;BB&quot; is to mentor, advise and service as a liaison between student members and alumni. This position is required by Delta Chi Law to be a two-year term and served by a Delta Chi alumnus.
*Alumni Board of Trustees – The purpose of The Alumni Board of Trustees (ABT) is to lead, supervise and advise the chapter. Members may include alumni, chapter officers, parents, grandparents, faculty, and local business &amp; community leaders. Members may be aligned to advise and mentor chapter undergraduate officers and the chapter&#x27;s committees.
*Housing Corporation – The role of the Housing Corporation is to manage the chapter or colony housing facilities and all legal responsibilities of such management. Since a Housing Corporation is a separate, incorporated legal entity, it has no requirements set forth by Delta Chi Law.

&quot;The Delta Chi Quarterly&quot; is distributed to members and alumni.

==Chapters==

Delta Chi chapters are unique in naming. Most college fraternities and sororities are named in an alphabetical Greek system. Delta Chi chapters and colonies are named by institution, and sometimes by self-naming. Therefore, the first &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; was the &quot;Cornell chapter&quot;.

==Notable members==
==Local chapter misconduct==
In February 2021, Virginia Commonwealth University&#x27;s chapter was suspended after freshman Adam Oakes died of alcohol poisoning after an off-campus fraternity party. The VCU chapter was later expelled from the university three months after Oakes&#x27;s death, after the university found that the chapter had violated several university policies, including those on hazing and alcohol.

<doc id="1219504" wikidata="Q397926" url="?curid=1219504" title="Aguardiente">
<text>&#x27; (Portuguese) or &#x27; (Spanish) (; ; ) is a type of distilled alcoholic spirit that contains between 29% and 60% alcohol by volume (ABV). It is a somewhat generic term that can refer to liquors made from various foods. It originates from and is typically consumed on the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain) and in Iberian America (Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries of the Americas).

==Etymology==
The word is a compound of the Iberian languages&#x27; words for &quot;water&quot; ( in Castilian; in Catalan; in Portuguese; in Galician) and &quot;burning&quot;/&quot;fiery&quot; ( in Castilian; in Catalan; in Portuguese and Galician). A comparable word in English is &quot;firewater&quot;, though the English term is colloquial or humorous, whereas &quot;aguardiente&quot; is stylistically neutral in Spanish.

== Definition ==
&quot;Aguardientes&quot; are strong alcoholic beverages obtained by fermentation then distillation of sugared or sweet musts, vegetable macerations, or mixtures of the two. This is the most generic level; by this definition, &quot;aguardientes&quot; may be made from many different sources. Fruit-based aguardientes include those made from oranges, grapes, bananas, or medronho (&quot;cane apple&quot;). Grain-based ones may be made from millet, barley, or rice and tuber-based aguardientes from beet, manioc, or potato, and finally what are classed as &quot;true&quot; &quot;aguardientes&quot; from sugarcane and other sweet canes, including some species of bamboo.

&quot;Cane aguardiente&quot; and &quot;cachaça&quot; are similar but distinct products. Brazil defined &quot;cane aguardiente&quot; as an alcoholic beverage of between 38% and 54% ABV, obtained by simple fermentation and distillation of sugarcane that has already been used in sugar production and has a distinct flavor similar to rum. &quot;Cachaça&quot;, on the other hand, is an alcoholic beverage of between 38% and 48% ABV, obtained by fermenting and distilling sugarcane juice, and may have added sugar up to 6 g/L.

===Regulation===
According to Spanish and Portuguese versions of European Union spirits regulations, &quot;aguardiente&quot; and &quot;aguardente&quot; are generic Spanish and Portuguese terms, respectively, for some of the distilled spirits that are fermented and distilled exclusively from their specified raw materials, contain no added alcohol or flavoring substances, and if sweetened, only &quot;to round off the final taste of the product&quot;. However, &quot;aguardiente&quot; and &quot;aguardente&quot; are not legal denominations.

Instead, different categories of &quot;aguardientes&quot; (spirits in the English version) are established according to raw materials. In the Spanish version, wine spirit (brandy) is &quot;aguardiente de vino&quot;, fruit spirit is &quot;aguardiente de fruta&quot;, grain spirit (other than whiskey and neutral grain spirit) is &quot;aguardiente de cereales&quot;, etc.

Many &quot;aguardentes&quot; have a protected designation of origin:
*Portugal
**&quot;Aguardente Bagaceira Alentejo&quot;
**&quot;Aguardente Bagaceira Bairrada&quot; (grape marc of Bairrada)
**&quot;Aguardente Bagaceira da Região dos Vinhos Verdes&quot;
**&quot;Aguardente de Vinho Ribatejo&quot;
**&quot;Aguardente de Vinho Alentejo&quot;
**&quot;Aguardente de Vinho Lourinhã&quot;
**&quot;Aguardente de Vinho Douro&quot; (wine spirit of Douro)
**&quot;Aguardente de Vinho da Região dos Vinhos Verdes&quot;
*Spain 
**&quot;Aguardiente de sidra de Asturias&quot; (cider spirit of Asturias)
**&quot;Aguardiente de hierbas de Galicia&quot; (herbal spirit of Galicia).

==Regional variations==
Some drinks named &quot;aguardiente&quot; or similar are of different origins (grape pomace, sugarcane); other drinks with the same origin may have different names (clairin, brandy).
===Brazil===

In Brazil, a beverage known as &quot;cachaça&quot; or &quot;pinga&quot;, considered distinct from traditional &quot;aguardiente&quot;, is made from sugarcane. &quot;Cachaça&quot; has two varieties: unaged (white) and aged (gold). White &quot;cachaça&quot; is usually bottled immediately after distillation and tends to be cheaper. It is often used to prepare caipirinha and other beverages in which &quot;cachaça&quot; is an ingredient. Dark &quot;cachaça&quot;, usually seen as the &quot;premium&quot; variety, is aged in wood barrels and is meant to be drunk neat. Traditionally, no herbs are used to flavor the &quot;cachaça&quot;; its flavor is influenced by the fermentation agent, time spent in the cask, or the type of wood from which the barrel is made.

One form that can be qualified as moonshine is known as &quot;Maria Louca&quot; (&quot;Crazy Mary&quot;). This is &quot;aguardiente&quot;, made in jails by inmates. It can be made from many cereals, ranging from beans to rice, or whatever can be converted into alcohol, be it fruit peels or candy, using improvised and illegal equipment.

===Cape Verde===

Grogue, also known as grogu or grogo (derived from English grog), is a Cape Verdean alcoholic beverage, an &quot;aguardiente&quot; made from sugarcane processed in a trapiche. Its production is fundamentally artisanal, and nearly all the sugarcane is used in producing grogue.

===Chile===

In Chile, &quot;aguardiente&quot; is an alcoholic beverage of 45% and higher ABV (beverages with over 55% ABV are illegal). It is made, like Italian grappa, by distilling the grape residue, primarily the skins and pulp (&#x27;) plus the stems (&#x27;) and seeds, left over from winemaking after pressing the grapes. It is used to make several other flavored liquors, such as the &quot;murtado&quot; or &#x27; (using sun-dried &quot;murtilla&quot;, an orange-reddish wild rose fruit), the &#x27; (soaking sun-dried morello cherries) and &quot;licor de oro&quot; (flavored with saffron and lemon peel). Dried mint, peeled walnuts, almonds, and other aromatic herbs are also used to flavor the &quot;aguardiente&quot;. It is mainly consumed by itself or as a base to make &quot;cola de mono&quot; (&quot;monkey tail&quot;).

===Colombia===

In Colombia, &quot;aguardiente&quot; is an anise-flavored liqueur derived from sugarcane, popular in the Andean region. Different flavors are obtained by adding different amounts of aniseed, leading to extensive marketing and fierce competition between brands. &quot;Aguardiente&quot; has 24%–29% alcohol content. Other anise-flavored liqueurs similar to &quot;aguardiente&quot;, but with a lower alcohol content, are also sold. Since the Spanish era, &quot;aguardiente&quot; has maintained the status of the most popular alcoholic beverage in the Andean regions of Colombia, with the notable exception of the Caribbean region, where rum is most popular. Generally, &quot;aguardiente&quot; is rarely drunk in cocktails and usually drunk neat.

On the Caribbean coast, there is a moonshine called &quot;Cococho&quot;, an &quot;aguardiente&quot; infamous for the number of blindness cases due to the addition of methanol.

===Costa Rica===

In Costa Rica, it is 30% alcohol, with a neutral flavor. The Costa Rican government tightly controls Guaro to help prevent clandestine production.

===Guam and the Mariana Islands===

In Guam and the Mariana Islands, a distilled version of &quot;tubâ&quot; (coconut palm wine introduced from the Philippines) is known as &quot;aguajente&quot; (also &quot;aguayente&quot; or &quot;agi&quot;). It is similar to Filipino &quot;lambanóg&quot;. It was prevalent among the Chamorro people, but is largely extinct; the United States banned its manufacture soon after the acquisition of Guam from the Spanish Empire in 1899. A local company &quot;Aguayente distillers&quot; has recently installed a commercial still and will soon start distilling liquor from locally grown potatoes.

===Ecuador===

In Ecuador, &quot;aguardiente&quot; is also derived from sugar cane, but unlike Colombia, it is left largely unflavoured. It is then taken straight as shots, mulled with cinnamon (&quot;canela&quot; in Spanish) and fruit juices to make the hot cocktail &quot;canelazo&quot;, or mixed with the juice of naranjilla and spices for the hot cocktail &quot;draquita&quot;. Locally or artisanally made &quot;aguardiente&quot; is commonly called &quot;punta&quot;, &quot;puro&quot; or &quot;trago&quot;, and alcohol content can vary widely, from &quot;mild&quot; &quot;puntas&quot; of about 10% to &quot;strong&quot; of about 40% or higher. The traditional distillation process produces &quot;aguardiente&quot; as strong as 60 g/L. Every Ecuadorian province has a slightly different flavor to the &quot;aguardiente&quot; made there, and each province has a different recipe for &quot;canelazo&quot;. In Ecuador, &quot;aguardiente&quot; is the most commonly consumed strong alcohol. &quot;Aguardiente Astillero&quot; is one of the newest brands, becoming very popular due to its symbolic title, especially around Guayas.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, &quot;aguardiente&quot; goes by many names, including &quot;habanero&quot;. In the state of Michoacán, &quot;charanda&quot; is a traditional rum-like sugar cane &quot;aguardiente&quot;.

Casa Berreteaga marketed an &quot;aguardiente&quot; called &quot;Berreteaga&quot;, which used sugarcane sourced from the Coxcatlan region of Puebla. Berreteaga was a fortified wine made from rum and sweet wine (usually Muscat) or (uncommonly) a sweet brandy that was then aged in oak barrels.

===Portugal===

Portuguese &quot;aguardente&quot; has several varieties. &quot;Aguardente vínica&quot; is distilled from either good quality or undrinkable wine. It is mostly used to fortify wines such as port or aged to make &quot;aguardente velha&quot; (old burning water), a kind of brandy. &quot;Aguardente bagaceira&quot; is made from pomace to prevent waste after the close of wine season. It is usually bootlegged, as most drinkers only appreciate it in its traditional formulation of 50% to 80% ABV. A common way to drink it is as &quot;café com cheirinho&quot; (&quot;coffee with a little scent&quot;), a liqueur coffee made with espresso.

In the Azores, this &quot;espresso-aguardente&quot; combination is commonly referred to as &quot;café com música&quot; (&quot;coffee with music&quot;). &quot;Aguardente Medronho&quot; is a variety distilled from the fruit of the &quot;Arbutus unedo&quot; tree.

In Madeira, it is the core ingredient for &quot;poncha&quot;, a beverage around which a festival is based. Most of the &quot;aguardente&quot; from the region is made from sugarcane.

===Spain===
In certain areas of the Pyrenees in Catalonia, &quot;aiguardent&quot;, as it is known in Catalan, is used as an essential ingredient in the preparation of &quot;tupí&quot;, a type of cheese.

Galicia is renowned for the quality and variety of its &quot;augardentes&quot;(Galician), or &quot;aguardientes&quot; (Spanish), including &quot;augardente de bagazo&quot; (&quot;aguardiente de Orujo&quot;), which is obtained from the distillation of the pomace of grapes, and is clear and colorless. It typically contains over 50% alcohol, sometimes significantly more, and is still made traditionally in many villages across Galicia today. &quot;Augardente de herbas&quot;, usually yellow, is a sweet liqueur made with &quot;augardente de bagazo&quot; and herbs (&quot;herbas&quot;), with chamomile being a substantial ingredient. &quot;Licor café&quot; (typical distilled drink in the province of Ourense), black in color, is a sweet liqueur made with &quot;augardente de bagazo&quot;, coffee (&quot;café&quot;), and sugar. &quot;Crema de augardente&quot; or c&quot;rema de caña&quot; is a cream liqueur based on &quot;augardente&quot;, coffee, cream, milk, and other ingredients. It is similar to Irish cream liqueur. In some places in Galicia, a small glass is traditionally taken at breakfast as a tonic before a hard day&#x27;s work on the land. The word &quot;orujo&quot; is Spanish and not Galician, but is used to distinguish Galician and some Spanish augardentes from those of other countries. &quot;Bagazo&quot; is the Galician for &quot;Orujo&quot;.

Most of the moonshine in Spain is made as a byproduct of winemaking by distilling the squeezed skins of the grapes. The essential product is called &quot;&quot;orujo&quot; or &quot;aguardiente&quot;&quot; (burning water). The homemade versions are usually more potent and have a higher alcoholic content, well over the 40% that the commercial versions typically have. It is often mixed with herbs, spices, fruits, or other distillates. Types include &quot;pacharán&quot;, &quot;licor de café&quot; and &quot;orujo de hierbas&quot; (tea mixed with orujo).

===United States===
During the mission and rancho periods of California history, &quot;aguardiente&quot; was made out of mission grapes. It was popular during the Gold Rush of 1849.

<doc id="1219506" wikidata="Q1542544" url="?curid=1219506" title="Ryan X-13 Vertijet">
<text>The Ryan X-13 Vertijet (company designation Model 69) is an experimental tail-sitting vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) jet aircraft built by Ryan Aeronautical and flown in the United States in the 1950s. The main objective of the project was to demonstrate the ability of a pure jet to vertically take off, hover, transition to horizontal forward flight, and vertically land.

==Development==
Just after World War II, Ryan engineers wondered whether the Ryan/U.S. Navy FR-1 Fireball, which had a thrust-to-weight ratio of 1:1 at low fuel quantities, would take off vertically. The United States Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Aeronautics in 1947 awarded Ryan a contract, originally under the designation F3R, to investigate the development of a vertically launched jet fighter. This was part of a program to evaluate the feasibility of submarine-based aircraft. Ryan conducted remote controlled VTOL tethered rig tests from 1947 to 1950 and a flying rig in 1951. Ryan was awarded an Air Force contract in 1953 to develop an actual flying jet-powered VTOL aircraft, which was given the designation X-13. The aircraft was designed using calculations on a REAC 100, and two prototypes were ultimately built.

The Ryan X-13 Vertijet was long. It was just large enough to accommodate the single-place cockpit with a tilting seat and the thrust Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet. The high-mounted delta wing of the aircraft had a wingspan of only and was capped with flat endplates. The nose of the aircraft had a hook on the underside and a short pole for gauging distance from the trailer. The hook was used to hang the Vertijet from the vertical trailer bed landing platform. After the aircraft was secured vertically, the trailer was lowered to horizontal and then used to transport the aircraft on the ground. Pitch and yaw control in hover were provided by vectored engine thrust. Roll control was provided by &quot;puffer&quot; jets (also known as &quot;jet reaction control&quot;) mounted outboard of the wingtip endplates. 

The first prototype (#54-1619) was fitted with temporary landing gear and made its first horizontal flight on December 10, 1955. Later, it made full horizontal to vertical attitude conversions and back again at altitude. The first prototype then had the landing gear replaced with a tail-mounted framework that held it in a vertical attitude on the ground. Using this rig, hooking practice was conducted. The second prototype (#54-1620), on April 11, 1957, made a vertical take-off from the vertically raised trailer, transitioned to horizontal flight and back again. It then returned to the vertical trailer and landed by hooking the landing wire. Flight tests were performed by two test pilots: Ryan&#x27;s Chief Test Pilot Peter F. &quot;Pete&quot; Girard, and Ryan Test Pilot W. L. &quot;Lou&quot; Everett.

On July 28–29, 1957, the X-13 was demonstrated in Washington, D.C. It crossed the Potomac River and landed at the Pentagon.

The Air Force chose not to continue development of the Ryan X-13 Vertijet because of the lack of an operational requirement.

==Operational history==

The X-13 was designed to investigate vertical takeoff, horizontal flight transition, and return to vertical flight for landing. The first prototype of the X-13 was equipped with temporary tricycle landing gear. The X-13 was flown conventionally on December 10, 1955 to test its aerodynamic characteristics. The Vertijet was then fitted with a temporary &quot;tail sitting&quot; rig. On May 28, 1956, it was flown from the ground in a vertical position to test its hovering qualities. The X-13 VertiJet completed its first full-cycle flight at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on April 11, 1957, when it took off vertically from its mobile trailer, angled over into a horizontal attitude, and flew for several minutes. The X-13 then transitioned to vertical flight and slowly descended back onto its trailer and landed.

==Surviving aircraft==

Only two X-13 aircraft were built and both are on public display:
*Serial number &quot;54-1619&quot; is on display at the Gillespie Field Annex of the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum. It is on loan from the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.
*Serial number &quot;54-1620&quot; which was the Vertijet which made the full-cycle flight on April 11, 1957 was transferred to the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Dayton, Ohio, in May 1959. It is on display in the museum&#x27;s Research and Development Hangar.

<text>George Alexander Graham Adamson MBE (3 February 1906 – 20 August 1989), also known as the &quot;Baba ya Simba&quot; (&quot;Father of Lions&quot; in Swahili), was a British wildlife conservationist and author based in Kenya. His wife Joy Adamson related in her best-selling book &quot;Born Free&quot; (1960) (in 1966 made into a film) the couple&#x27;s life with Elsa the Lioness, an orphaned lioness cub they raised and later released into the wild. 

==Life==
George Alexander Graham Adamson was born on 3 February 1906 in Etawah, India to English and Irish parents. He was educated at Dean Close School, Cheltenham, England, and moved to work on his father&#x27;s coffee plantations in Kenya in 1924. After the death of his parents he worked in a series of jobs, which included gold prospector, goat trader and professional safari hunter, before joining Kenya&#x27;s wildlife department in 1938, working as a game warden. Six years later he married Friederike Victoria &quot;Joy&quot; Gessner. (who became the best-selling author Joy Adamson). It was in 1956 that he raised the lioness cub, Elsa, which he later released into the wild, which adventure became the subject of his wife&#x27;s best-selling book &quot;Born Free&quot; (1960), later in 1966 made into the feature film &quot;Born Free&quot;.

Adamson retired as a Senior Wildlife Warden of the Northern Frontier District Province of Kenya (Meru National Park area) in 1961 and devoted himself to raising lions that could not look after themselves and training them to survive in the wild. In 1970, he moved to the Kora National Reserve in northern Kenya to continue the rehabilitation of captive or orphaned big cats for eventual reintroduction into the wild. George and Joy separated in 1970, but continued to spend Christmas holidays together until she was murdered on 3 January 1980.

==Death==
On 20 August 1989, George Adamson was murdered near his camp in Kora National Park, by Somali bandits, when he went to the rescue of his assistant and a young European tourist in the Kora National Park. He was 83 years old. George is buried in the Kora National Park next to his brother, Terrance and two lions named: Super Cub and Mugie, a lion released in Kora after George&#x27;s death.

<text>Mark Almond (born 1958) is a British author, and was a lecturer in Modern History at Oriel College, Oxford.

Almond holds a master&#x27;s degree (M.A.), and was the Chair of the British Helsinki Human Rights Group (which despite its name was not affiliated with the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights). He served as an election observer under the aegis of the BHHRG, a group that has been accused of producing fraudulent reports on elections in countries such as Georgia and Ukraine. Almond took part in these reports. Almond has been critical of what he characterizes as Western interference with democracy, such as the activities of George Soros.

His research interests lie in 19th century and 20th century Central-Eastern Europe; Almond has written a biography of Nicolae and Elena Ceauşescu, a study of Albanian migration, and a study of the Bosnian War in its historical context. He has recently been teaching a course on 18th Century France, focusing on the writings of Alexis de Tocqueville.

As of 2012, Almond was delivering lectures on European History in Bilkent University in Turkey. Almond also writes articles for national papers.
