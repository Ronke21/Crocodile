<text>The Irish People&#x27;s Liberation Organisation was a small Irish socialist republican paramilitary organisation formed in 1986 by disaffected and expelled members of the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), whose factions coalesced in the aftermath of the supergrass trials. It developed a reputation for intra-republican and sectarian violence as well as criminality, before being forcibly disbanded by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) in 1992.

Some of the IPLO&#x27;s most notable attacks during its short existence were: 
*the Orange Cross shooting in which IPLO gunmen killed a member of the Red Hand Commando and injured an Ulster Defence Regiment soldier;
* the 1991 Donegall Arms shooting when they fired indiscriminately on a Protestant-owned pub, killing two Protestant civilians and injuring four others; and
* the assassination of outspoken loyalist politician and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) member George Seawright in November 1987.

On 1 May 1990 the IPLO became a proscribed organisation by the British government. Although officially disbanded, the IPLO retains that classification under the Terrorism Act 2000.

==Foundation==
The IPLO emerged from a split within the INLA. After the 1981 Irish hunger strike, in which three of its members died, the INLA began to break apart. The INLA virtually dissolved as a coherent force in the mid-1980s. Factions associated with Belfast and Dublin fell into dispute with each other. When INLA man Harry Kirkpatrick turned supergrass, he implicated many of his former comrades in various activities and many of them were convicted on his testimony.

Members both inside and out of prison broke away from the INLA and set up the IPLO. Some key players at the outset were Tom McAllister, Gerard Steenson, Jimmy Brown and Martin &quot;Rook&quot; O&#x27;Prey. Jimmy Brown formed a minor political group, known as the Republican Socialist Collective, which was to act as the political wing of the IPLO.

The IPLO&#x27;s initial priority was to forcibly disband the Irish Republican Socialist Movement from which it had split, and most of its early attacks reflected this, being more frequently against former comrades than on the security forces. The feud with the INLA lasted from 1986 to 1987 and resulted in the deaths of 12 people including IPLO leader Gerard Steenson who was shot in March 1987.

==Internal feud==
The IPLO was accused of becoming involved in the illegal drug trade, especially in ecstasy. Some of its Belfast members were also accused of the prolonged gang rape of a North Down woman in Divis Flats in 1990. Many of its recruits had fallen out of favour with the IRA and the portents for its future were not good. Sammy Ward, a low-level IPLO member, broke away from the main body of the organisation with a few supporters when the IPLO were severely depleted and weak in Belfast. His faction attacked the rest of the IPLO, culminating in the killing of Jimmy Brown. A full-scale feud followed between two factions terming themselves &quot;Army Council&quot; (formerly led by Jimmy Brown) and &quot;Belfast Brigade&quot; (led by Ward), which led to the 3000th killing of the Troubles, Hugh McKibben, a 21-year-old &quot;Army Council&quot; man. Brown had been the previous victim when he was shot dead in West Belfast on 18 August 1992. This feud was described by the IPLO&#x27;s critics as a lethal squabble over money and drugs.

==Disbandment==
The Provisional IRA – by far the largest armed republican group in Ireland – decided to attack and remove the IPLO, given its involvement in the drug trade and due to increasingly provocative actions by the IPLO towards the Provisional IRA. On Saturday 31 October 1992, in an event that was later dubbed &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot; by locals in Belfast, the IRA attacked the two IPLO factions in Belfast, killing the breakaway Belfast Brigade leader Sammy Ward in the Short Strand. There were also raids on pubs and clubs where IPLO members were kneecapped. On 2 November 1992 the second-in-command of the IPLO Belfast Brigade formally surrendered to the Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade adjutant, which brought an end to the group in Belfast.

Outside Belfast the IRA did not attack any IPLO units and issued statements absolving the IPLO units in Derry, Newry and Armagh from any involvement in the drugs trade that was alleged against those in Belfast. In Dublin the IRA reprieved the IPLO Chief of Staff in return for surrendering a small cache of arms held in Ballybough.

The IPLO also had a presence in Strabane, and in Munster; like the INLA drawing its support from the Cork, Limerick, and Shannon areas. Reportedly the group had also established small support bases in Continental Europe including France, Belgium, and the Netherlands.

==Casualties==
According to the Sutton database of deaths at the University of Ulster&#x27;s CAIN project , the IPLO was responsible for 22 killings during the Troubles. Among its victims were twelve civilians, six INLA members, two loyalist paramilitary figures, a Royal Navy reservist, and one member of the British security forces, a Royal Ulster Constabulary constable.

==List of attacks and actions==
===1986===

*21 December – Thomas McCartan (31), a member of the INLA, was shot dead by the Irish People&#x27;s Liberation Organisation in Andersonstown. This was the first killing in an INLA-IPLO feud that was to last until March 1987. The IPLO used the alias &quot;INLA Army Council&quot; to claim responsibility for actions carried out during the feud. However, in the case of McCartan callers representing the Irish People&#x27;s Liberation Organisation claimed responsibility for the killing shortly afterwards, accusing him of &quot;abusing the republican struggle for his own selfish ends.&quot;

===1987===

*22 December – The IPLO hijacked a taxi in West Belfast and forced the driver to carry a device consisting of two full gas cylinders wrapped in detonating cord to an unknown target.

<text>William Johnstone VC (6 August 1823 – 20 August 1857) was a Royal Navy sailor and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He enlisted and served as John Johnstone.

He is listed as being born in Hanover and served on four ships; the St. Vincent, an emigrant ship transporting people to Australia (1845-1849), HMS Reynard (1849-1852) which operated in the China Seas, fighting pirates and was shipwrecked near Pratas Island in the South China Sea on 31 May 1851. The whole crew survived the sinking when HMS Pilot rescued them. There was no hope for the Reynard. After that, he moved on to HMS Arrogant and then HMS Brunswick.

==Victoria Cross==

He was 31 years old, and a stoker in the Royal Navy during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 9 August 1854 in the Baltic, Leading Stoker Johnstone and a Lieutenant (John Bythesea) from HMS &quot;Arrogant&quot;, landed on the island of Vårdö, Åland off Finland in order to intercept important despatches from the tsar which were being sent via Vårdö to Bomarsund. The two men spent two nights reconnoitring the island, being helped by a local farmer and his daughter to evade capture by the Russians and on 12 August when the despatches arrived, they ambushed the five Russians carrying them. Two of the carriers dropped their mail bags and ran, but the other three surrendered and were taken to the &quot;Arrogant&quot;. In this action the Officer and Leading Stoker were armed with just one pistol and a knife. Upon their return, the Commanders of both the English and French ships in the fleet were delighted.

Johnstone was not in England when Queen Victoria held the first VC investiture at Hyde Park, London, on 26 June 1857. The medal was sent for presentation to the Commanding Officer of HMS &quot;Brunswick&quot;, who returned it to the Admiralty on 16 October 1857, Johnstone having died nine weeks earlier. His widow was sent his Victoria Cross by registered post.

His RN records in the UK National Archives show he was a Leading Stoker until May 24, 1856 when he was demoted to Ship&#x27;s Cook until his demise. The reason for the demotion is not given, but given his good character throughout his career at sea, it is assumed by his descendants that there was cause to place him in such a lowly position on board.

==Death==
He died on 20 August 1857 from self-inflicted wounds while serving aboard in the West Indies. He cut his own throat after attacking another man with a knife and felt the remorse of his actions, taking his own life by the same knife. He was then buried at sea in the St Vincent Passage, West Indies.

William Johnstone&#x27;s medal was sold after his death and became part of a collection which on the death of the new owner, was gifted to and displayed in the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.

Upon his death, his wife, Caroline, was &quot;looked after by the Patriotic Fund,&quot; which was set up to cater for the needs of War Widows. He left a wife and a young son, Richard John. The family lived in St. Germans, Cornwall. UK.

A pencil sketch exists in the Imperial War Museum&#x27;s catalogues pertaining to information on Victoria Cross winners.

<text>Lechaio () is a village in the municipal unit of Assos-Lechaio in Corinthia, Greece. It is situated on the coast of the Gulf of Corinth, 8 km west of Corinth and 12 km southeast of Kiato. The Greek National Road 8 passes through the town. It had a railway station on the Piraeus–Patras railway, but passenger service on this line was halted in 2009.

==Historical population==

==History==

Ancient Lechaeum was one of the ports of Ancient Corinth. It was connected to Corinth by a pair of strong walls. In the 390 BC Battle of Lechaeum, a Spartan mora (regiment) was defeated by the Athenians led by Iphicrates at Lechaeum.

The small airport was built by the Germans in the World War II to serve as a military air-base for the control of the south-eastern Mediterranean area. In tunnels under the airport, a large inventory of weapons and many barrels of oil were stored by the German army.

<doc id="1212299" wikidata="Q4894265" url="?curid=1212299" title="Berni Inn">
<text>Berni Inn was a chain of British steakhouses, established in 1955. It was established by brothers Frank and Aldo Berni, who modelled the chain on restaurants they had seen in America. The restaurants introduced the postwar British public to its own home-grown restaurant chain, which came with stylised restaurants with Tudor-looking false oak beams and white walls.

By 1970 the chain comprised 147 hotels and restaurants, including the New Inn at Gloucester, the Mitre at Oxford and several in Japan. It was the largest food chain outside the USA.

==History==
Brothers Aldo and Frank Berni, with their partner Paul Rosse, opened the first Berni Inn on 27 July 1956 at &quot;The Rummer&quot;, a historic pub in St Nicholas Market in central Bristol. More outlets were opened, and the company went public in 1962. The chain offered slick service and value for money, achieved partly by offering only a limited meat-based menu and a relatively small wine list. It had a loyal and regular following and quickly expanded through the 1960s, first in Bristol and then through much of the rest of the country.

Unlike other restaurants, Berni Inns did not do their own butchery but bought in quality steaks already prepared. Behind the scenes, staff training manuals showed that they expected high standards from their employees.

The first female manager was Gerda Thut, who took over &quot;The Sawyer&#x27;s Arms&quot; in Nottingham in the 1960s. This was noted as a progressive step in management and equality. The chain was sold to Grand Metropolitan for £14.5 million in 1970. Berni Inn was sold to Whitbread in 1995, who converted the outlets into their own Beefeater restaurants.

Aldo Berni died in 1997 at the age of 88 in Bristol. Frank died 10 July 2000, aged 96, in Jersey. Their brother Marco managed Harvey&#x27;s Restaurant in Bristol in the 1960s.

==Fare==

The most frequently ordered meal, even as late as the 1980s, was prawn cocktail, steak and Black Forest gateau. This is sometimes called the &quot;Great British Meal&quot;. As Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham note in their 1997 book &quot;The Prawn Cocktail Years&quot;, &quot;cooked as it should be, this much derided and often ridiculed dinner is still something very special indeed&quot;.

<text>Lechaeum or Lechaion (), also called Lecheae and Lecheum, was the port in ancient Corinthia on the Corinthian Gulf connected with the city of Corinth by means of the Long Walls, 12 stadia in length. The Long Walls ran nearly due north, so that the wall on the right hand was called the eastern, and the one on the left hand the western or Sicyonian. The space between them must have been considerable; since there was sufficient space for an army to be drawn up for battle. Indeed, the area was the scene of battles between Sparta and Athens in 391 BCE, leaving Spartans in command of Lechaeum, which they garrisoned with their troops (see Battle of Lechaeum). One of the earliest active ports in Europe, Lechaeum was in use as a commercial port as early as 1381 BCE.

The flat country between Corinth and Lechaeum is composed only of the sand washed up by the sea; and the port must have been originally artificial, though it was no doubt rendered both spacious and convenient by the wealthy Corinthians. Lechaeum was the chief station of the Corinthian ships of war; and during the occupation of Corinth by the Macedonians, it was one of the stations of the royal fleet. It was also the emporium of the traffic with the western parts of Greece, and with Italy and Sicily. The proximity of Lechaeum to Corinth prevented it from becoming an important town like Piraeus. The only public buildings in the place mentioned by Pausanias, who visited in the 2nd century, was a temple of Poseidon, who is hence called Lechaeus by Callimachus. The temple of the Olympian Zeus was probably situated upon the low ground between Corinth and the shore of Lechaeum.

Its site is located near the modern village of Lechaio.

<doc id="1212308" wikidata="Q6266292" url="?curid=1212308" title="Johnny Barnes">
<text>John James Randolf Adolphus Mills (June 23, 1923 – July 9, 2016), known as Johnny Barnes, was a Bermudian entertainer who waved to passing traffic at the Foot of the Lane roundabout in Hamilton, Bermuda, from roughly 3:45 am to 10 am, every workday.

A Bermuda institution mentioned in several guidebooks and profiled in two documentary films, he was known for waving and saying &quot;I love you, God loves you&quot;, to passing commuters during the morning rush hour into Hamilton. Due to the unique layout of the island and its roads, nearly all drivers at rush hour coming from the western and southern areas of the island passed Barnes at the roundabout.

==Life==
Barnes, born to parents from St. Kitts, was an electrician by trade and worked on the Bermuda Railroad as an electrician until the railroad closed in 1948. He then became a bus driver. Barnes was fond of waving to people while driving the bus, and would occasionally sit and wave to people on his breaks or when coming to work.

Barnes was married in 1949 and lived with his wife until his death on July 9, 2016. His wife had a cheery disposition because he had &quot;covered her with honey&quot; since they were married. They had no children.

In approximately 1986, Barnes stopped at the Crow Lane roundabout and took up waving to traffic. He was there almost every day, until his &quot;retirement&quot; in December 2015. Local radio stations report receiving frantic calls when Barnes was not at his unofficial post. He was occasionally joined by people, sometimes costumed, waving signs to promote a charity, event, or business.

==Attitudes and beliefs==
Barnes credits his mother for teaching him goodwill and kindness to strangers, including &#x27;speaking to everyone you see, because you never know when you might need them&#x27;, and punishing him for not talking to a lady he saw.

Barnes has said, &quot;I enjoy making people happy, ... I like to let them know that life is sweet, that it&#x27;s good to be alive&quot;. In the 2011 documentary &quot;Mr Happy Man&quot;, he says &quot;Life is sweet, life is beautiful, it is sweet to be alive. Enjoy the sunshine, the flowers, the birds – they&#x27;re happy&quot;.

In the 2011 short-subject documentary &quot;Mr. Happy Man&quot;, Barnes identified himself as a religious man, a Seventh-Day Adventist who was motivated to share God&#x27;s love for everyone. Though Barnes would pray with visitors to his post if requested, he was not known as a religious proselytizer.
Barnes said &quot;We human beings got to learn how to love one another ... Then there wouldn&#x27;t be any wars, there wouldn&#x27;t be any killing&quot;, and &#x27;&quot;People need to know that love is important&quot;.

==Legacy==

In November 1998, a group of local businessmen unveiled a life-size bronze statue of Barnes blowing kisses in the air. The statue is located on Crow Lane just up from the roundabout. Although there were objections to spending $70,000 to build a statue to a man still living, Barnes said in &quot;Mr. Happy Man&quot; that he appreciated the gesture while he was still alive, saying he would not be able to enjoy it if he were dead.

In early June 2016, Dennis Bean took up Johnny&#x27;s position at the roundabout at the bottom of Trimingham Road, waving to traffic in the same manner made famous by Johnny Barnes.

<text>Richard Scott Kotschau (born November 22, 1975) is an American former soccer player who last played as a defender for the Real Salt Lake of Major League Soccer.

==Club career==
Kotschau was born in Levittown, New York. After playing college soccer at George Mason University, where he helped his team to their first-ever NCAA Tournament appearance, Kotschau was drafted by the Chicago Fire second overall in the 1998 MLS College Draft. Although he helped the Fire to the MLS Cup and US Open Cup double in his rookie year he was traded to the Tampa Bay Mutiny midway through the 1999 season.

Midway through 2001, Kotschau was part of the deal that sent Carlos Valderrama to the Colorado Rapids. With Colorado, Ritchie was a first-choice player, played a number of defensive roles, and scored his first MLS goal. After the 2005 season, he was dealt to the Crew for Cornell Glen. While with the Columbus Crew defender Ritchie Kotschau was named the Huntington man of the year by the Columbus Crew. The award is presented to the player who embodies an exceptional sense of leadership, civic pride, family values and community service. Kotschau, 30, in his first season with the Crew, appeared in 26 games, starting 23. The nine-year MLS veteran wore the captain&#x27;s armband 17 times this season and recorded one goal and two assists. That goal was a game-winner.
In ten years in MLS, Kotschau scored nine regular season goals and added 15 assists.

==International career==
Kotschau earned his first cap for the United States national team on March 9, 2005, against Colombia and was a former member of the U-23, U-20, B and U-18 teams.

==Personal life==
Kotschau now lives in Broomfield, Colorado where he is employed by Life Time Fitness as the Member Engagement Manager. Kotschau is married with two children.

<text>William James Gordon, (19 May 1864 – 15 August 1922) was a West Indian soldier in the British Army and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Born in Jamaica, Gordon enlisted in the 1st battalion, West India Regiment of the British Army in July 1885. At the beginning of 1892, he returned for a second tour of duty in west Africa, and was sent to the Gambia during the Second Gambia Campaign, to counter local hostility towards an Anglo-French boundary commission. Here he was part a detachment sent up river to the village of Toniataba, about 80 miles inland from Bathurst.

On 13 March 1892 lance corporal Gordon, then 27 years old, performed an act of gallantry for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. His citation reads: During the attack on the town of Toniataba, Major G. O. Madden, West India Regiment, who was in command of the Troops, was superintending a party of twelve men who were endeavouring with a heavy beam to break down the South Gate of the town, when suddenly a number of musket muzzles were projected through a double row of loop-holes which had been masked. Some of these were within two or three yards of that Officer&#x27;s back, and before he realized what had happened Lance-Corporal Gordon threw himself between. Major Madden and the muskets, pushing that Officer out of the way, and exclaiming &quot;Look out, Sir!&quot; At the same moment Lance-Corporal Gordon was shot through the lungs.&lt;br&gt;By his bravery and self-devotion on this occasion the Lance-Corporal probably saved the life of his Commanding Officer.

Gordon recovered from his wound, and continued to serve in the army. In 1897, and now a sergeant, he was part of the West India Regiment contingent that attended Queen Victoria&#x27;s 1897 diamond jubilee celebrations in London. After leaving the army in April 1902, he served as warden of the firing range at Up-Park Camp in Kingston, Jamaica. He died on 15 August 1922 following a stroke, and was buried with military honours at Up Park military cemetery.

Gordon&#x27;s VC is on display at the Jamaica Defence Force Museum in Kingston, Jamaica.

Gordon was one of two members of the West India Regiment to be awarded the VC. The other, Private Samuel Hodge, from Tortola, British Virgin Islands, received the award for bravery in the Gambia in 1866.

<text>Samuel Hodge, VC ( 1840 – 14 January 1868) was a West Indian soldier in the British Army and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth soldiers. From the island of Tortola in the British Virgin Islands, he was the second black man to be awarded the Victoria Cross after William Hall.

==Details==
Samuel Hodge was one of the West Indian soldiers who garrisoned British positions on the West coast of Africa during the 19th century. White troops suffered terribly from malaria, blackwater fever and dysentery, and the War Office addressed the problem by using troops of the West India Regiments.

In 1866, Lieutenant Colonel George Abbas Kooli D&#x27;Arcy, commanding officer of the 3rd West India Regiment and Governor of The Gambia, marched to confront a rebellious Marabout leader named Amar Faal at (also known as Tubab Kolon), a stockaded town on the northern bank of the River Gambia; taking with him 270 officers and men of the 4th West India Regiment from the Bathurst garrison, Hodge being one; around 500 warriors from the Soninke people later joined his force. He attacked the town on 30 June.

Private Hodge was about 26 years old (his precise date of birth is not known). The British force had light armaments and rockets, but failed to break through the wooden stockade by bombardment. D&#x27;Arcy called for volunteers to assist him in trying to cut a breach by hand. Two officers and fifteen men (including Hodge) seized axes and followed him. However, the fire of the defenders was intense; those officers were killed almost immediately, and most of the remaining men were wounded. D&#x27;Arcy and the two uninjured men, Hodge and another soldier (Private Boswell), reached the stockade, and hacked a gap in it large enough for a man. Boswell was killed, leaving only D&#x27;Arcy and Hodge of the original assault party of eighteen. D&#x27;Arcy went through the gapfollowed closely by Hodge, who used his axe to hack open the inside fastenings on two more gates before being shot down.

Hodge sustained serious gunshot wounds, but survived. British troops poured in through the now open gates; and in the fierce fighting that followed, several hundred of the Marabouts were killed, and the village and stockade burned down. Once the day had been won, D&#x27;Arcy presented Hodge to his regiment as the bravest man among them, to universal acclamation.

Hodge was promoted to the rank of lance corporal, and was presented with the Victoria Cross on 24 June 1867. However, he never fully recovered from the terrible injuries he had sustained during the attack, and died of fever less than a year later during service in British Honduras (now Belize), and was buried at the military cemetery there.

<text>The Committee of Safety, established by the Parliamentarians in July 1642, was the first of a number of successive committees set up to oversee the English Civil War against King Charles I, and the Interregnum.

==1642–1644==
The initial committee of safety consisted of five members of the House of Lords: the Earls of Essex, Holland, Northumberland and Pembroke and Viscount Saye-and-Sele, and ten members of the House of Commons: Nathaniel Fiennes, John Glynn, John Hampden, Denzil Holles, Henry Marten, Sir John Merrick, William Pierrepoint, John Pym, Sir Philip Stapleton, and Sir William Waller. It sat until 1644 when Parliament and their new Scottish allies agreed to replace it with the Committee of Both Kingdoms.

==1647==
The Presbyterians in the House of Commons set up a new committee of safety, to coordinate defence of London and Parliament from the New Model Army which was advancing on London with demands that the Presbyterians did not wish to meet. When it became clear that the populace did not support them, the committee was dissolved and the Presbyterians fled.

==1659==
There were two committees of safety in 1659. The first was set up on 7 May, on the authority of the Rump Parliament, to replace the Lord Protector Richard Cromwell&#x27;s Council of State. It initially had seven members Charles Fleetwood, Sir Arthur Hesilrige, Sir Henry Vane the Younger, Edmund Ludlow, William Sydenham, Richard Salwey, and John Jones. Two days later on 9 May four more men were appointed to the committee John Lambert, John Desborough, James Berry and Thomas Scot. It was only a temporary expediency and was dissolved two weeks later when on 19 May a new Council of State was appointed.

The last Committee of Safety was set up on 26 October 1659 by the high command of the New Model Army just before the Restoration. It was set up in response to the Rump Parliament which the day before tried to place the commander of the army Charles Fleetwood as chief of a military council under the authority of the speaker. The members of the last committee were:
* Henry Vane the Younger
* Bulstrode Whitelocke
* William Sydenham
* John Lambert
* James Berry 
* Lord Warriston (Archibald Johnston)
* Edmund Ludlow
* Richard Salwey
* John Desborough
* Charles Fleetwood
* Sir James Harrington
* William Steele
* Walter Strickland
* Henry Lawrence
* John Ireton
* Robert Tichborne
* Henry Brandrith
* Robert Thomson
* John Hewson
* John Clark (or John Clerk)
* Robert Lilburne
* Robert Bennet
* Cornelius Holland

<text>The Gulf of Taranto (; Tarantino: ; ) is a gulf of the Ionian Sea, in Southern Italy.

The Gulf of Taranto is almost square, long and wide, making it the largest gulf in Italy, and it is delimited by the capes Santa Maria di Leuca (to the east, in Apulia) and Colonna (the ancient &quot;Lacinium&quot;, to the west, in Calabria), encompassed by the three regions of Apulia, Basilicata and Calabria. The most important rivers are the Basento, the Sinni, and the Agri.

The main cities on the gulf are Taranto and Gallipoli. Also the Greek colonies (Magna Graecia) of Kroton, Heraclea, Thurii, and Sybaris were founded on the Gulf of Taranto.

Italy claims the whole gulf as national waters, thus closed to international traffic. This position, which is similar to that of Libya on the Gulf of Sidra, is not recognized by some other countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom.

<doc id="1212374" wikidata="Q884590" url="?curid=1212374" title="Incontinentia pigmenti">
<text>Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare X-linked dominant genetic disorder that affects the skin, hair, teeth, nails and central nervous system. It is named from its appearance under a microscope.

The disease is characterized by skin abnormalities that begin in childhood, usually a blistering rash which heals, followed by the development of harder skin growths. The skin may develop grey or brown patches which fade with time. Other symptoms can include hair loss, dental abnormalities, eye abnormalities that can lead to vision loss and lined or pitted fingernails and toenails. Associated problems can include delayed development, intellectual disability, seizures and other neurological problems. Most males with the disease do not survive to childbirth.

&quot;Incontinentia pigmenti&quot; is caused by a mutation in the &quot;IKBKG&quot; gene, which encodes the NEMO protein, which serves to protect cells against TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. A lack of IKBKG therefore makes cells more prone to apoptosis.

There is no specific treatment; individual conditions must be managed by specialists.

==Presentation==

The skin lesions evolve through characteristic stages:
# blistering (from birth to about four months of age),
# a wart-like rash (for several months),
# swirling macular hyperpigmentation (from about six months of age into adulthood), followed by
# linear hypopigmentation.

Alopecia, dental anomalies, and dystrophic nails are observed. Some patients have retinal vascular abnormalities predisposing to retinal detachment in early childhood. Cognitive delays or intellectual disability are occasionally seen.

The discolored skin is caused by excessive deposits of melanin (normal skin pigment).
Most newborns with IP will develop discolored skin within the first two weeks.
The pigmentation involves the trunk and extremities, is slate-grey, blue or brown, and is distributed in irregular marbled or wavy lines.
The discoloration sometimes fades with age.

Neurological problems can include cerebral atrophy, the formation of small cavities in the central white matter of the brain, and the loss of neurons in the cerebellar cortex.
About 20% of children with IP will have slow motor development, muscle weakness in one or both sides of the body, intellectual disability, and seizures.
They are also likely to have visual problems, which can include: crossed eyes, cataracts, retinal detachment, and severe visual loss.
Dental problems are also common, and can include hypodontia, abnormally shaped teeth, and delayed tooth eruption.

Breast anomalies can occur in 1% of patients and can include hypoplasia or supernumerary nipples.

Skeletal and structural anomalies can occur in approximately 14% of patients, including:
* Somatic asymmetry
* Hemivertebrae
* Scoliosis
* Spina bifida
* Syndactyly
* Acheiria (congenital absence of the hands—note: other limbs may be affected)
* Ear anomalies
* Extra ribs
* Skull deformities

==Genetics==
IP is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. IP is lethal in most, but not all, males. A female with IP may have inherited the IKBKG mutation from either parent or have a new gene mutation. Parents may either be clinically affected or have germline mosaicism. Affected women have a 50% risk of transmitting the mutant IKBKG allele at conception; however, most affected male conceptuses miscarry. Thus, the effective ratio for liveborn children from a mother carrying the mutation is 33% unaffected females, 33% affected females, and 33% unaffected males. Genetic counseling, prenatal testing, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis is available.

In females, the cells expressing the mutated IKBKG gene due to lyonization selectively die around the time of birth, so the X-inactivation is extremely skewed.

IP is caused by mutations in a gene called NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator).

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of IP is established by clinical findings and occasionally by corroborative skin biopsy. Molecular genetic testing of the NEMO IKBKG gene (chromosomal locus Xq28) reveals disease-causing mutations in about 80% of probands. Such testing is available clinically. In addition, females with IP have skewed X-chromosome inactivation; testing for this can be used to support the diagnosis. Many people in the past were misdiagnosed with a second type of IP, formerly known as IP1. This has now been given its own name: Hypomelanosis of Ito (incontinentia pigmenti achromians). This has a slightly different presentation: swirls or streaks of hypopigmentation and depigmentation. It is &quot;not&quot; inherited and does not involve skin stages 1 or 2. Some 33–50% of patients have multisystem involvement—eye, skeletal, and neurological abnormalities. Its chromosomal locus is at Xp11, rather than Xq28.

==Treatment==
There does not yet exist a specific treatment for IP. Treatment can only address the individual symptoms.

==History==
This disorder was first reported by Swiss dermatologist Bruno Bloch in 1926 and American dermatologist Marion Sulzberger in 1928.

<text>Adin Brown (born May 27, 1978) is an American soccer coach and former player. He is currently the goalkeeping coach for San Jose Earthquakes in Major League Soccer.

==Youth and High School==
Born in Pleasant Hill, California, Brown attended De La Salle High School in Concord, California. He started for the 1996 soccer team which is now in the Hall of Fame at De La Salle. The 1996 De La Salle team is the only team in school history to have a perfect record, while letting in no goals in the regular season. Only 3 goals were let in during the playoffs.

==Career==
===College===
A highly touted prospect and a starting goalkeeper for the United States in the run-up prior to the 2000 Summer Olympics, Brown played college soccer at the College of William and Mary. In 1999, he became only the third goalkeeper in NCAA history (Tony Meola and Brad Friedel were the other two) to be named NCAA First Team All-American twice.

===Professional===
The Colorado Rapids then made Brown the third overall pick of the 2000 MLS SuperDraft. Rosenborg BK of the Eliteserien bid $1M for Brown&#x27;s services, but the bid was rejected. Brown signed a five-year deal with MLS. Brown&#x27;s pro career was not as solid as was expected due to various injuries. In 2000 and 2001 with the Rapids, Brown made 22 starts, and recorded three shutouts over 1,976 minutes.
After sharing goalkeeping duties with David Kramer in his rookie season (an injury which kept him from going to the Olympics), Brown was the principal of the deal that sent Carlos Valderrama from the Tampa Bay Mutiny to Colorado.

The trade saw Valderrama, goalkeeper Scott Garlick and defender Ritchie Kotschau sent to Colorado for Brown, defender Scott Vermillion and the Rapids&#x27; first-round pick in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Vermillion was then was dealt to D.C. United for defender Eric Denton.

After only half of one season in Tampa, the Mutiny folded, leaving him exposed in the 2002 MLS Dispersal Draft. Brown&#x27;s high contract kept him from being selected, although he signed with the New England Revolution a few days after the draft, on January 15, 2002.

It was in New England that Brown had his best season in 2002; Brown won the starting job from Juergen Sommer midway through the year and led the Revolution to the brink of winning MLS Cup 2002, posting one of the &quot;finest performances ever seen in MLS history during the 2002 playoffs.&quot; Brown started sixteen games and posted a 1.23 goals-against average in the 2002 MLS regular season. Call-ups (but no caps) to the senior national team and a solid 2003 followed, in which Brown made 25 starts and posted a 1.42 goals-against average, being named Revolution team Defender of the Year. but so did more injuries.

During the 2004 New England Revolution season, Brown&#x27;s playing time was reduced due to struggles with injuries, and also the emergence of Matt Reis, who had joined the Revolution from the LA Galaxy in 2003. Brown would make only seven appearances during the campaign, and without a starting job, he signed with Aalesunds FK on a free transfer.

Brown played 69 games in net during his tenure with Aalesund from 2005 to 2009. In 2006, he led Aalesund to a second-place finish in the Norwegian First Division, and a return to the country&#x27;s Premier League in 2007.

On July 2, 2007, Brown made a number of great saves early in the game against Rosenborg, and then he headed in the equalizer at the end of the stoppage time to tie the game 2–2. It was his first ever goal.

In the next few seasons he spent most of his time being injured and was retired from the Aalesund squad after the season of 2009. Brown became a cult figure at Aalesund FK.

On February 23, 2010, Brown signed with Portland Timbers in the USSF Division 2 Professional League. He made his first appearance for the team on September 25, 2010, in Portland&#x27;s penultimate game of the 2010 season, as a late replacement for an injured Matt Pyzdrowski in a game against Crystal Palace Baltimore. Brown signed with the new Major League Soccer expansion team Portland Timbers on January 18, 2011.

Following the 2011 season, the Timbers announced that they had declined a second year option on Brown&#x27;s contract and he would not be brought back for the 2012 season. Brown entered the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft but was not selected and became a free agent.

On March 12, 2012, the Timbers announced that Brown would be one of the team&#x27;s Alumni Ambassadors, making public appearances for the team and assisting with the team&#x27;s youth efforts and clinics.

<doc id="1212381" wikidata="Q368349" url="?curid=1212381" title="Carl Dix">
<text>Carl Dix (born 1948) is a founding member, and a representative, of the Revolutionary Communist Party, USA (RCP). He is a regular contributor to &quot;Revolution&quot; newspaper and a longtime associate of Bob Avakian.

In 1996, Dix co-founded the October 22nd Coalition to Stop Police Brutality, Repression and the Criminalization of a Generation. Dix along with Cornel West was a central figure in the campaign to &quot;Stop &quot;Stop and Frisk&quot;&quot; aimed at opposing the New York City stop-and-frisk program to stop hundreds of thousands of people in New York City and frisk them.

Dix is a member of Refuse Fascism, a coalition group co-initiated by the RCP in 2016 to drive out the Trump administration. Dix was also a member of the Black Workers Congress, the African Liberation Support Committee, and Vietnam Veterans Against the War.

==Early life==

Dix grew up in an African-American working class community of West Baltimore, Maryland. He was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1968 while attending college and at the height of the Vietnam War. He received orders to report to Fort Bragg Army base in North Carolina. He recalled in an oral history heading onto the base for the first time and seeing a big sign on the side of the road just outside the gate, &quot;Welcome to KKK Country&quot;. He thought to himself &quot;what did they get us into here?&quot; He was influenced by the black consciousness movement of the times, including Malcolm X&#x27;s critique of the United States for talking about being for justice while oppressing people in other countries like the Vietnamese, &quot;especially when your people are oppressed at home in America.&quot; Dix reached a crossroads in December 1969 when during the same month he received orders to report for Vietnam and also heard about the police murder of Fred Hampton in Chicago and the police attack on the Black Panther headquarters in Los Angeles. He thought, &quot;this war isn&#x27;t just something over there, it&#x27;s here too, and I have to decide what side I&#x27;m on. I decided I couldn&#x27;t be part of the war in Vietnam, I couldn&#x27;t go fight for America.&quot;

==Refusal, courts-martial and prison==

He was one of six GIs who refused orders to go to Vietnam in June 1970 and faced courts-martial. This was the largest mass refusal of direct orders to Vietnam during the war and they became known as the Fort Lewis Six. Dix was immediately thrown into the military stockade at the base for pre-trial confinement, an unusual move contrary to military regulations. The local GI underground newspaper, the &quot;Lewis-McChord Free Press&quot; reported that base &quot;regulation 27-2 explicitly states that pre-trial confinement is to be used only when there is danger&quot; of self-harm or flight, neither of which applied to Dix. And things went downhill from there according to Dix. In their courts-martial, &quot;The military judge made it very clear he wasn&#x27;t listening. He says, &#x27;You guys can make your arguments for the record, I am not going to consider them, I don&#x27;t care what you have to say&#x27;&quot;. Dix was imprisoned for two years in Leavenworth Military Penitentiary. He commented at the time, &quot;I just have to exist, to be my own man, and accept the consequences. If I had continued to participate in the Army, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to relate to myself or humanity.&quot;

It was during his incarceration that he became a revolutionary. One of the first things that happened to him at Leavenworth was a beating by prison guards. As Dix described in a letter to his attorney, &quot;Sgt. Davis told me to stand in a yellow square and face the wall, which I did. Specialist Bartlett approached me from the right and questioned me as to why I wasn&#x27;t standing at the position of parade rest.&quot; Dix hadn&#x27;t received an order to stand at parade rest and said so. This led to what Dix described as an unprovoked assault from both guards during which he &quot;was struck in the back several times&quot; and thrown &quot;to the floor&quot;. Dix was then charged and sentenced by prison officials with &quot;assault on a guard and disobeying an order to stand at parade rest.&quot;

After his release from Leavenworth, Dix returned to Baltimore and worked and organized at the Bethlehem Steel plant at Sparrows Point from 1973 to 1978.

==Political activities==

In 2011 Dix played a key role in initiating the &quot;Stop Mass Incarceration Network&quot; and wrote &quot;Taking the Movement of Resistance to Mass Incarceration to a Higher Level Thru Unleashing Determined Mass Resistance&quot;. Dix, together with Cornel West, author and journalist Herb Boyd, Efia Nwangaza of the Malcolm X Center in Greenville, North Carolina, and Rev. Omar Wilkes, issued a statement &quot;From Up Against the Wall to Up in Their Faces: STOP – &quot;STOP &amp; FRISK&quot; calling for a campaign against at the New York Police Department&#x27;s &quot;Stop and Frisk&quot; program. On October 21, 2011, over 30 people, including Dix and West, were arrested at the NYPD&#x27;s 28th Police Precinct in a mass act of non-violent civil disobedience. Earlier that day Dix posted an article on &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; about why he was going to participate in the protest.

<doc id="1212383" wikidata="Q837187" url="?curid=1212383" title="Hamdanid dynasty">
<text>The Hamdanid dynasty () was a Shia Muslim Arab dynasty that ruled modern day Northern Mesopotamia and Syria (890–1004). They descended from the ancient Banu Taghlib tribe of Mesopotamia and Arabia.

==History==
===Origin===
The Hamdanids hailed from Arab Taghlib tribe, and are descendants of Adi ibn Usama al-Taghlibi. They&#x27;re sometimes called Adawis or Taghlibis in historical sources.

===Hamdanid emirate of Jazirah and Aleppo===
The Hamdanid dynasty was founded by Hamdan ibn Hamdun. By 892–893, he was in possession of Mardin, after fighting the Kharijites of the Jazira. In 895, Caliph al-Mutadid invaded and Hamdan fled Mardin. 

Hamdan&#x27;s son, Husayn, who was at Ardumusht, joined the caliph&#x27;s forces. Hamdan later surrendered to the caliph and was imprisoned. In December 908, Husayn conspired to establish Ibn al-Mu&#x27;tazz as Caliph. Having failed, Husayn fled until he asked for mediation through his brother Ibrahim. Upon his return, he was made governor of Diyar Rabi&#x27;a. In 916, Husayn, due to a disagreement with vizier Ali b. Isa, revolted, was captured, imprisoned, and executed in 918.

Hamdan&#x27;s other son, Abdallah, was made governor of Mosul in 905–906. He conducted campaigns against the Kurds in that region and in 913–914, was dismissed from his post and subsequently revolted. Abdallah submitted himself to Mu&#x27;nis, and with his pardon was made governor of Mosul in 914–915. During his brother Husayn&#x27;s revolt, both he and his brother Ibrahim were temporarily imprisoned. By 919, Abdallah was commanding an army against Yusuf b. Abi l&#x27;Sadj, governor of Adharbaydjan and Armenia. During their rule the Hamdanids intermarried with Kurdish dignitaries.

The rule of Hassan Nasir al-Dawla (929–968), governor of Mosul and Diyar Bakr, was sufficiently tyrannical to cause him to be deposed by his own family.

His lineage still ruled in Mosul, a heavy defeat by the Buyids in 979 notwithstanding, until 990. After this, their area of control in northern Iraq was divided between the Uqaylids and the Marwanids.

Ali Sayf al-Dawla &#x27;Sword of the State&#x27; ruled (945–967) northern Syria from Aleppo, and became the most important opponent of the Christian Byzantine Empire&#x27;s re-expansion. His court was a centre of culture, thanks to its nurturing of Arabic literature, but it lost this status after the Byzantine sacking of Aleppo.

To stop the Byzantine advance, Aleppo was put under the suzerainty of the Fatimids of Egypt, but in 1003 the Fatimids deposed the Hamdanids.

<text>Clemente Yerovi Indaburu (10 August 1904 – 19 July 1981) was a politician and the interim president of Ecuador from 30 March 1966, to 16 November 1966.

Yerovi was born in Barcelona, Spain, where his parents Clemente Yerovi Matheus and María Indaburu Seminario lived temporarily as consul general of Ecuador. Yerovi studied at Vicente Rocafuerte High School in Guayaquil, and then at San Gabriel High School in Quito. He married Victoria Gómez Ycaza and had four children, who were named:

* María Laura Yerovi Gómez
* Elena Yerovi Gómez
* Clemente Yerovi Gómez
* Fernando Yerovi Gómez

He had many links to agriculture on the coast of the country, where he acquired a farm, that split in parts among its workers. Yerovi tenure is remembered by most Ecuadorians as a time of peace and prosperity. Even though Yerovi was not elected by popular vote, Ecuadorians are very fond of his persona, erecting many monuments and naming avenues with his name.

In 1948 he was economy minister of Galo Plaza&#x27;s government, and then senator for agriculture.

Yerovi died in Guayaquil, Ecuador.

<text>Douglas Steven Trendle (né Woods; born 6 September 1958), better known as Buster Bloodvessel, is an English singer who has been the frontman of the two-tone band Bad Manners since forming the band in 1976. He took his stage name from the bus conductor played by Ivor Cutler in the Beatles&#x27; 1967 film &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;.

==Personal life==
Bloodvessel once owned a hotel in Margate called Fatty Towers, which specifically catered for larger customers with features such as extra large beds and baths as well as fatty meals. The hotel closed in 1998 and Bloodvessel moved back to London. He often appears as a guest on various television shows, as well as in the tabloid newspapers. He was the main sponsor of football team Margate F.C. in the 1990s.

In early 2001, Bloodvessel was taken ill with a Strangulated hernia during a concert in Perugia, Italy. He wanted to return to England, but was advised to have operation in Italy, even though operation would have been extremely dangerous due to his weight.

Bloodvessel has struggled with morbid obesity and underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery in 2004, with his weight dropping from 31 stone (196.86 kg; 434 lbs) to 13 stone (82.6 kg; 182 lbs). Bloodvessel is married with two children.

<text>Rosy Armen () is a French singer of Armenian descent. She is a multilingual singer, with most songs in French and Armenian, but also in other languages such as English, German, Spanish, and Italian.

== Biography ==
Rosy Armen was born to Kourchoud Hovhannessian from Dzhagry, Nakhitchevan and to Nvart Alozian from an Armenian suburb of Van. The Armenian couple had met each other after having immigrated to France in the 1920s. Rosy Hohannessian was born in Paris, France, on 1 May 1939. Rosy has been singing since the age of four, when she would lead the youth orchestra of her school until she eventually started singing solo songs. Despite her parents disapproval of a career in singing, Rosy Hohannessian, later Rosy Bedrossian continued on with her passion and eventually, took the stage name Rosy Armen and had success also singing next to established French music stars in France. She chose the last name Armen so that her Armenian fans would be aware of her nationality.

This success made her a well-known figure not only in France, but also all over Europe, the Soviet Union, United States and the Middle East where there were many Armenian communities and was invited to the imperial coronation as the official singer in October 1967.
In 1970 she took part in the selection rounds to represent Spain at the Eurovision Song Contest 1970, singing &quot;Gwendolyne&quot;. Julio Iglesias, went on to represent Spain with the same song. In the finals, Armen was part of the trio singing backing vocals.

Her repertoire includes music from Aram Khachaturian, Arno Babadjanian, Michel Legrand. She sing Boris Pasternak and Yevgeny Yevtushenko poems.

At the height of her career, French television covered her concerts abroad through the efforts of Michel Lancelot and Roger Benamou. In France, she gave concerts in best music theaters including one Olympia in Paris. She also sang at the Waldorf Astoria in New York, at the Los Angeles Music Center, at Place des Arts theater in Montreal, and Luzhniki Palace of Sports in Moscow.

After the 1988 earthquake in Armenia, Charles Aznavour invited her to record alongside him and other singers the song &quot;Pour toi Arménie&quot;, a song that remained in 1st place for 10 weeks in a row in the French Top 50. In 1990, she did a tour in Armenia to help the people recovering from the earthquake and to show France&#x27;s support to Armenians. Already popular in the Armenian diaspora for many decades, Rosy Armen has become very popular in Armenia as well. Since the nineties Rosy Armen performed several live shows in Russia, Armenia, Los Angeles, as well as on many TV and radio shows in France and Armenia.

In April 2014, she received the &quot;Armenian Music Award&quot; as the honor of the Armenian music in the Kremlin in Moscow from the President of Armenians in Moscow, Ara Abramyan.

In December 2014, during a new ceremony, Rosy Armen received further recognition with &quot;International Music Award&quot; at the Moscow Kremlin, for singing in the countries of the world in different languages including Armenian.

During MIDEM 2015 in Cannes, Armenia was honored to mark the centennial of the Genocide 24 April 1915, Rosy Armen received the Legion of Honor from the hands of the President of Armenia, Serzh Sargsyan.

After being honored by all these prizes she returned to the recording studio to work on her new album, expected for 2017.

<text>HD 168443 is an ordinary yellow-hued star in the Serpens Cauda segment of the equatorial constellation of Serpens. It is known to have two substellar companions. With an apparent visual magnitude of 6.92, the star lies just below the nominal lower brightness limit of visibility to the normal human eye. This system is located at a distance of 127 light years from the Sun based on parallax, but is drifting closer with a radial velocity of −48.7 km/s.

This stellar object is a core hydrogen fusing G-type main-sequence star with a classification of G6V, although it is likely evolved with an age of around 11 billion years. It is slightly lower in mass than the Sun but has a radius that is larger by 51%. The star is spinning with a leisurely projected rotational velocity of 2.2 km/s and it has a very inactive chromosphere. It is radiating 2.4 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5,491 K.

HD 168443 is known to be orbited by a super-Jupiter exoplanet, discovered in 1999, and a brown dwarf, discovered in 2001. The brown dwarf takes 30 times longer to orbit the star than the planet. Both have eccentric orbits. An orbital fit to Hipparcos astrometric data suggested the brown dwarf has a mass of . A 2022 study utilizing both Hipparcos and Gaia data instead measured a true mass of for HD 168443 c, close to the minimum mass. Test simulations of massless particles orbiting in between these two bodies show that all such objects are quickly ejected within two million years. That suggests any other planetary companions would be orbiting further out from the star.

<text>Hubert Jude Brown (born September 25, 1933) is an American former professional basketball player, coach, and analyst. Brown is a two-time NBA Coach of the Year, the honors separated by 26 years. Brown was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2005.

Following his retirement from coaching, Brown worked as a television analyst for CBS, TNT, ESPN and ABC. Brown called his final game on February 9, 2025.

==Early life==
Brown was born on September 25, 1933, in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. His family moved to Elizabeth, New Jersey, when he was three years old and grew up there, living in a small apartment building without a telephone. Brown, an only child, has said that his father, Charlie, who worked at the shipyards, was a &quot;demanding man.&quot;

He graduated from St. Mary of the Assumption High School in 1951. While he was in high school, St. Mary won state championships in football, basketball and baseball.

==College career==
Brown played college basketball and baseball at Niagara University, graduating in 1955 with a degree in education. While at Niagara, Brown was a teammate (and roommate) of former Utah Jazz coach Frank Layden, as well as Larry Costello and Charlie Hoxie, who would go on to star for the Harlem Globetrotters.

==Professional career==
===Rochester Colonels (1958–1959)===
After leaving Niagara, Brown joined the U.S. Army where he joined the Army&#x27;s basketball team. After being honorably discharged in 1958, Brown briefly played for the Rochester Colonels of the Eastern Professional Basketball League (the forerunner to the Continental Basketball Association) before they folded after just eight games. He averaged 13.8 points per game in his brief stint as a pro and was an excellent defender as a player.

Brown also returned to Niagara to earn a master&#x27;s degree in education as he looked to pursue a coaching career.

==Coaching career==
===St. Mary Academy (1955–1956)===
Brown&#x27;s defensive mentality would carry on into his coaching career, which began in 1955 at St. Mary Academy in Little Falls, New York where he coached both basketball and baseball.

===Cranford High School (1959 or 1960–196?)===
Brown coached at Cranford High School in Cranford, New Jersey in the 1960s.

===Fair Lawn High School (196?–1967)===
Brown coached at Fair Lawn High School in Fair Lawn, New Jersey until 1967. He was replaced in that role before the start of the 1967 season by Bob Gottlieb.

===William &amp; Mary (1967–1968)===
Brown became an assistant coach for one season at the College of William &amp; Mary from 1967 to 1968.

===Duke (1968–1972)===
The following season, Brown joined Duke University as an assistant coach. Brown coached the Duke Blue Devils until 1972.

===Milwaukee Bucks (1972–1974)===
Brown joined the NBA as an assistant coach for the Milwaukee Bucks in 1972 under Larry Costello. Milwaukee made the NBA Finals in 1974 with future Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson, but fell in seven games to the Boston Celtics, who were led by their own superstars: Dave Cowens, John Havlicek, Jo Jo White and future Bucks coach Don Nelson.

===Kentucky Colonels (1974–1976)===
After two seasons in the NBA, Brown was given his first professional head coaching opportunity with the Kentucky Colonels of the American Basketball Association. Brown led the Colonels to the 1975 ABA Championship. Brown continued as the Colonels&#x27; coach until the ABA-NBA merger in 1976 when the Colonels franchise folded, one of two ABA teams that did not join the NBA (the Spirits of St. Louis being the other).

===Atlanta Hawks (1976–1981)===
Brown then rejoined the NBA as head coach of the Atlanta Hawks, going 31–51 in his first season with the Hawks. But by the 1977–78 season, the Hawks had rebounded into a .500 team, finishing 41–41 and earning Coach of the Year honors for Brown. Two years later, in 1979–80, they won only their second division title since moving to Atlanta. However, after they tumbled to a 31-win season in 1980–81, Brown was fired with just three games remaining in the season.

===New York Knicks (1982–1987)===
Brown joined the New York Knicks in 1982, succeeding long-time coach Red Holzman. He stayed with the Knicks until he was fired in 1986 after starting the season 4–12. After reaching the playoffs in each of Brown&#x27;s first two seasons, the Knicks plummeted to 24–58 in 1984–85 and 23–59 in 1985–86. But there were circumstances that were far beyond Brown&#x27;s control that hastened the downfall. Star forward Bernard King suffered a devastating knee injury in March 1985 in a game against the Kansas City Kings, not fully recovering for two seasons, while Patrick Ewing, the top overall pick in the 1985 NBA draft, missed 32 games in an injury-plagued rookie season. Brown left the Knicks at the beginning of the 1986–87 season, succeeded by Bob Hill.

===Memphis Grizzlies (2002–2004)===
Sixteen years removed from his previous NBA coaching job, Brown was again tapped to be a head coach in the NBA 2002–03 season by Jerry West of the Memphis Grizzlies, who fired coach Sidney Lowe after an 0–8 start. The Grizzlies&#x27; choice of Brown was quite controversial at the time; Hubie Brown was the oldest coach in the NBA at the age of 69.

Brown finished the season with a 28–46 record with the team, at the time the team&#x27;s record for wins. However, the team underwent a complete turnaround for the 2003–04 season, finishing 50–32 and making the playoffs for the first time in team history. Brown was again named the NBA&#x27;s Coach of the Year.

However, by the 2004–05 season, there were again concerns about Brown&#x27;s health and age. Brown was given medical clearance to start the season, but was forced to delegate much work to his assistant coaches, including his son, Brendan Brown. This led to an incident between Brendan Brown and Jason Williams when Williams snapped at Brown during the fourth quarter of a game early on in the season. Williams eventually apologized, but the Grizzlies were beginning to struggle during the season, starting 5–7.

Brown then unexpectedly resigned from the Grizzlies on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 2004. In a statement, he cited &quot;unexpected health-related issues... [that were] absolutely nonexistent at the beginning of the season.&quot; Details of the specific &quot;health-related issues&quot; were not announced. Shortly afterward Mike Fratello was announced as the new Grizzlies coach, marking the second time in his career that he had succeeded Brown in an NBA head coaching position.

Soon after Brown&#x27;s unexpected departure, it was reported by Ronald Tillery of the Memphis &quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; that a combination of negative attitudes among James Posey, Jason Williams, and Bonzi Wells led to his leaving. Brown coached his team with a 10-man rotation, which meant that players got smaller amounts of playing time.

==Broadcasting career==
Brown began broadcasting after being fired by the Hawks, working for USA Network&#x27;s coverage of the NBA, including playoff games as well as CBS before being hired by the Knicks. During the 1985 NBA playoffs, Brown lent his services to CBS once again while still coaching the Knicks, who were not in the playoffs, teaming up with Brent Musburger. Following his dismissal from the Knicks, CBS hired Brown full-time as a broadcaster in December 1986, and served alongside Verne Lundquist as the third team during select regular season and playoff games, promoted to the second team the next season. When asked in 1988 how long he would remain involved with the game of basketball, Brown responded &quot;I will stay involved in some capacity until the day Verne Lundquist dies.&quot; In 1988, CBS named Brown to replace Billy Cunningham as its lead analyst alongside play-by-play man Dick Stockton. Brown remained with CBS until the end of their NBA coverage following the 1990 NBA Finals, then worked on the local broadcasts for the Philadelphia 76ers and the Detroit Pistons before joining TNT in the early 1990s. Brown continued anchoring TNT&#x27;s basketball coverage through the 2001–02 season, in which he was paired with announcers such as Bob Neal, Ron Thulin, Pete Van Wieren, and his old CBS partners Verne Lundquist and Dick Stockton.

Shortly after his departure from the Grizzlies, Brown signed with ABC as its top NBA analyst. Brown worked with Al Michaels and Mike Breen on some regular-season and playoff games, including the 2005 NBA Finals and 2006 NBA Finals, before he was replaced as lead analyst by Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy. Brown has later called games with Mike Tirico until 2016, when Tirico moved to NBC Sports. His later broadcast partners included Mark Jones, Dave Pasch and Ryan Ruocco. Brown called his final game, between the Philadelphia 76ers and Milwaukee Bucks on ABC, on February 9, 2025, accompanied by Breen.

Brown was nominated for a Sports Emmy in 1994 and 1999.

==Halls of Fame==
* Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame (class of 2005 as a contributor).
* College Basketball Hall of Fame (class of 2006)
* National Sports Media Association Hall of Fame (class of 2022 as a broadcaster)

==Personal life==

Brown and his late wife of 54 years, Claire, have three daughters – Molly, Virginia, and Julie - and a son, Brendan, an NBA scout and assistant coach who then worked for the New York Knicks as a radio analyst. Claire Brown died on June 7, 2024, at the age of 87. His son Brendan died November 3, 2024, at the age of 54 due to health complications.

<text>Archibald Hunter (23 September 1859 – 29 November 1894) was a Scottish footballer who, in 1887, was the first captain of Aston Villa to lift the FA Cup. He was one of Victorian football&#x27;s first household names.

== Life and career ==
Born in Joppa near Ayr, Hunter played for Ayr Thistle and Third Lanark (featuring on the losing side in the 1878 Scottish Cup Final) before signing for Aston Villa in August 1878, four years after their formation. His Aston Villa career began 10 years before the commencement of the first Football League season. In his league career (1888–1890) he played 73 matches scoring 42 goals. Also his 33 goals for Villa in the FA Cup (including 3 in 1888–1889) remains the club record in the competition. Hunter made his League debut on 15 September 1888 at Wellington Road, as a forward, against Stoke. Aston Villa won 5–1 and Hunter scored one of the goals. He missed three League games (out of 22) in 1888–89 and scored seven League goals including one brace.

Despite being one of the greats of the 19th century game, Hunter never fulfilled his dream of playing for Scotland against England. This is because at the time the Scottish Football Association had a policy of not picking &#x27;Anglo-Scots&#x27; (i.e. Scots who played in the English League) which persisted until 1896.

Hunter originally came to Birmingham planning to sign for Calthorpe F.C., but was persuaded to sign for Villa instead, ostensibly after hearing of Aston Villa&#x27;s Scottish connections, although, given Hunter &quot;had become acquainted with the Calthorpe Football Club&quot; when in Scotland, and given Calthorpe had been founded and run by Scots, and played in Scottish colours, this rationale is questionable. Calthorpe&#x27;s links with Queen&#x27;s Park F.C. meant the club was resolutely amateur, unlike Villa. Hunter later recalled in his memoirs; 

He was idolized by the crowds and became the first player to score in every round of the FA Cup in Villa&#x27;s victorious 1887 campaign. 

During a League match against Everton in 1890, Hunter suffered a heart attack and collapsed. He never played again, and died in Aston at the age of 35. It is said that on his death-bed he asked to be lifted up one last time to see the crowd going to Perry Barr (then Villa&#x27;s home).

His brother Andy also played for Villa, and scored their first ever FA Cup goal. Another brother, John, was a Scotland international.

One source said that there was no doubt that the auburn-haired Hunter was a great player – one of the best footballers of the 1880s and 90s. He was an individualist with a commanding personality; he was robust yet decidedly fair and never committed a foul in anger. Known as &#x27;The Old Warhorse&#x27;, he was a mixture of toughness and cleverness, a player who often ran down the touchline, pulling defenders all over the field.

== Legacy ==
In 1998, Hunter was inducted into the English Football League&#x27;s list of 100 legends.

<text>HD 169830 is a star in the southern constellation of Sagittarius. It has a yellow-white hue and is dimly visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of +5.90. The star is located at a distance of 120 light years from the Sun based on parallax. It is drifting closer with a radial velocity of −17.3 km/s, and is predicted to come as close as in 2.08 million years. HD 169830 is known to be orbited by two large Jupiter-like exoplanets.

This is an F-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of F7V. It is 3.83 billion years old and chromospherically inactive with a slow rotation rate, having a projected rotational velocity of 3.83 km/s. This star is 40% more massive and 84% larger than the Sun. Combining the mass and radius makes the surface gravity only 41% that of the Sun. It is radiating 4.6 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,300 K.

A candidate stellar companion, designated component B, lies at an angular separation of along a position angle of 265°.

==Planetary system==
On April 15, 2000, the Geneva Extrasolar Planet Search Team announced the discovery of a minimum mass planet in a 226-day orbit. Three years later on June 30, 2003, the same team, using the same method, discovered a minimum mass second planet orbiting the star. In 2022, the inclination and true mass of HD 169830 c were measured via astrometry.

<doc id="1212459" wikidata="Q4316372" url="?curid=1212459" title="Alexander Ney">
<text>Alexander Ney (; born September 1939 in Leningrad, Soviet Union) is an American sculptor and painter. After establishing himself in 1972 as a resident of France, he immigrated to the United States in 1974 and has since lived and worked in New York City. Developing several individualistic styles in modern art, he is most famous for his unique work in terra cotta sculpture, involving heavily perforated surfaces and intriguing forms.

== Early life ==
Born at the outbreak of World War II, Ney&#x27;s early childhood was entrenched in difficulty. Two weeks before Ney became 2 years old, the Siege of Leningrad was launched, described by historians as the second most lethal battle in the war&#x27;s tragic history. The pivotal city’s rail connections were severed, cutting off all access to any food and power supplies. In the following winters that ensued, between two and three million civilians—including 400,000 children—died during the Leningrad Blockade.

==Biography==
After being given private art lessons at the home of influential Russian sculptor V.V. Lishev (1877–1960), from 1954 to 1957 Ney studied at the Art School of the Leningrad Academy of Arts, and later at the Art School of the Moscow Surikov State Academic Institute of Fine Arts from 1957 to 1959. Ney befriended a wide number of progressive-minded art students, now stars of the contemporary Russian art scene such as Alexander Kosolapov, Leonid Sokov, Alexander Yulikov, Lev Nussberg and Vadim Kosmatschof. His relentless efforts in creating strikingly new interpretations of art quickly made the young artist legendary amidst his peers. Artists Alexander Kosolapov and Igor Makarevich, amongst others, recall that Ney played an influential role in their early years.

From 1965 to 1967, Ney taught sculpture to children at the House of Young Pioneers in Leningrad. Students included future Russian novelist Sergei Dovlatov (1941–1990).

In 1967 through 1969, Ney attended art history and theory courses at the Ilya Repin Institute. He continued to perfect his skills as both a painter and sculptor, as well as an art theoretician.

Due to his highly productive creative output&#x27;s clashing with the Soviet mandates of Socialist Realism, Ney absconded to France in 1972 on a tourist visa, as immigration was not permitted. His was granted residencies and established studios in the famed art colonies of both Cité internationale des arts in Paris and Villa Arson in Nice. In 1974, at the encouragement of American Abstract Expressionist painter Elaine de Kooning (wife of Willem), he immigrated with his family to the United States.

One of the first of several noted cultural figures whose early departure inadvertently signaled the start of a new wave of American immigrants from the Soviet Union, the legendary late American designer Gene Moore discovered Ney&#x27;s work at a chance meeting at The Russian Tea Room. As the longtime Vice President of the flagship landmark location of Tiffany &amp; Co. on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, having displayed the works of contemporary artists Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, James Rosenquist and Andy Warhol, Moore created displays featuring Ney&#x27;s works annually since 1978 for over thirty years.

On May 29, 1997, a 4-alarm rooftop fire apparently caused by a neighboring commercial building descended into Ney&#x27;s two-floor home and studio located in Manhattan&#x27;s Diamond District, destroying thousands of artwork.

In 2009, the National Centre for Contemporary Arts (NCCA) in Moscow held a special anniversary exhibition to honor the artist&#x27;s 70th anniversary. NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg wrote in the accompanying publication&#x27;s introductory forward:

″Throughout his career, Mr. Ney has made an indelible impact on the creative life of our City and beyond—building a diverse and unique range of work that has inspired and moved individuals from around the world. What’s more, Mr. Ney’s success demonstrates the boundless potential of the New York immigrant experience, and his hard work and perseverance set a wonderful example for us all. On behalf of the City of New York, I applaud Mr. Ney for his tremendous achievements and invaluable contributions to the cultural life of our City.″

==Public collections==
Notable collections of Ney’s sculptures, paintings and drawings are held at:
* Museum Beelden aan Zee, containing the largest collection of international sculpture in the Netherlands
* The State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia

<doc id="1212465" wikidata="Q3049346" url="?curid=1212465" title="Listen Like Thieves">
<text>Listen Like Thieves is the fifth studio album by Australian rock band INXS. It was released on 14 October 1985. It spent two weeks at number one on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart. Considered an international breakthrough album for the band, it peaked at No. 11 on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, No. 24 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; 100 Albums and in the top 50 in the United Kingdom.

The album features the band&#x27;s first top 5 single in the U.S., &quot;What You Need&quot;, and it also won the group the &quot;Countdown&quot; Music and Video Award for &#x27;Best Video&#x27;. &quot;Listen Like Thieves&quot; also marks the beginning of the group&#x27;s off-and-on alliance with producer Chris Thomas.

== Background ==
&quot;Listen Like Thieves&quot; is the fifth studio album by INXS. The Sydney-based group had formed in 1977 by the three Fariss brothers: Andrew on guitar and keyboards, Jon on percussion and drums, and Tim on guitar, along with Garry Gary Beers on bass guitar, Michael Hutchence as lead vocalist, and Kirk Pengilly on guitar, saxophone, and vocals. Their previous album, &quot;The Swing&quot; (April 1984), had local chart success peaking at number one on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart and No. 6 in New Zealand. Although appearing on international charts – No. 52 on United States &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and No. 27 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; 100 Albums – INXS wanted to improve their worldwide impact.

After recording their last album in New York and Oxfordshire, they returned to Sydney where they worked with Chris Thomas (Sex Pistols, Pretenders, Roxy Music, Elton John) producing at Rhinoceros Studios.

==Recording and production==
&quot;Listen Like Thieves&quot; was recorded over a three-month period at the Rhinoceros studio in Sydney, NSW, Australia. Many of the album&#x27;s songs were written by the song writing duo of Hutchence and Andrew Farriss.

As production came close to completion, Thomas told the band that the album was lacking a crucial hit single, so the band members left the studio having just a few days to come up with one last song. &quot;Chris Thomas told us there was still no &#x27;hit&#x27;&quot;, Farriss later recalled. &quot;We left the studio that night knowing we had one day left and we had to deliver a &#x27;hit&#x27;. Talk about pressure.&quot; Both Hutchence and Farriss searched through the demos that Farriss had composed throughout the album&#x27;s production. Out of the remaining demos, Thomas persuaded the duo to focus on one particular demo titled &quot;Funk Song no 13&quot;. &quot;It was great. I thought, &#x27;I could listen to that groove for 10 minutes!&#x27; I said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s work with that groove&#x27;&quot;, said Thomas. INXS spent the next two days working on the demo track, which would eventually turn out to be the hit single &quot;What You Need&quot;, giving the band their first top 5 hit in the U.S.

== Critical reception ==

AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that with &quot;Listen Like Thieves&quot; the band &quot;completes its transition into an excellent rock &amp; roll singles band&quot;. However &quot;the new configuration only works for three songs&quot;, which were its first three singles, &quot;What You Need&quot;, &quot;Listen Like Thieves&quot; and &quot;Kiss the Dirt (Falling Down the Mountain)&quot;. Despite this commentary, the music critic stated as well that &quot;the album cannot be dismissed&quot; and gave it four out of five stars in his ranking. Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane opined that &quot;Listen Like Thieves&quot; had &quot;a much harder sound than heard on previous INXS records, but somehow it lacked the pop smarts that had made &quot;The Swing&quot; so appealing&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Parke Puterbaugh felt the group were &quot;going for the jugular – or is that the groin?&quot; and with Thomas they &quot;forge an unlikely union between the sonic extremism of Led Zeppelin-style crunch rock and the step-lively beat of disco&quot; such that the album &quot;rocks with passion and seals the deal with a backbeat that&#x27;ll blackmail your feet&quot;.

<doc id="1212468" wikidata="Q2281554" url="?curid=1212468" title="Claude Cahen">
<text>Claude Cahen (26 February 1909 – 18 November 1991) was a 20th-century French Marxist orientalist and historian. He specialized in the studies of the Islamic Middle Ages, Muslim sources about the Crusades, and social history of the medieval Islamic society (works on Futuwa orders).

Claude Cahen was born in Paris to a French Jewish family. After studying at the École Normale Supérieure on the rue d&#x27;Ulm, he attended the Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales, receiving a doctorate in 1940. He was a professor at the University of Strasbourg from 1945 to 1959 and then at the Sorbonne; in 1967 he was invited to teach at the University of Michigan, and in 1973, he was elected to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. He was later elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1983.

Cahen was married and had six children, including the historian Michel Cahen, who wrote a biography of his father. Cahen was a member of the French Communist Party from the 1930s until 1960, and remained an active Marxist afterwards. Despite his origins, he neither self-identified as Jewish nor supported the State of Israel.

In 1954 he published &quot;An Introduction to the First Crusade&quot; in the Oxford journal &quot;Past and Present&quot;. Cahen has been called &quot;the &quot;doyen&quot; of Islamic social history and one of the most influential Islamic historians of [his] century,&quot; and &quot;the best historian of the Middle East in the twentieth century.&quot; Mark Cohen describes him as a distinguished Islamic historian. He was a prisoner of war in World War II. The Festschrift &quot;Itineraires d&#x27;Orient: Hommages a Claude Cahen&quot;, edited by Raoul Curiel and Rika Gyselen, appeared in 1995 as an honor to his &quot;distinguished career&quot;, and an issue of the journal &quot;Arabica&quot; (43/1 (1996)) was dedicated to him. That issue also includes a nearly complete bibliography of his works.

<doc id="1212472" wikidata="Q1045802" url="?curid=1212472" title="Gliese 436">
<text>Gliese 436 is a red dwarf located away in the zodiac constellation of Leo. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 10.67, which is much too faint to be seen with the naked eye. However, it can be viewed with even a modest telescope of aperture. In 2004, the existence of an extrasolar planet, Gliese 436 b, was verified as orbiting the star. This planet was later discovered to transit its host star.
==Nomenclature==
The designation &quot;Gliese 436&quot; comes from the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars. This was the 436th star listed in the first edition of the catalogue.

In August 2022, this planetary system was included among 20 systems to be named by the third NameExoWorlds project. The approved names, proposed by a team from the United States, were announced in June 2023. Gliese 436 is named Noquisi and its planet is named Awohali, after the Cherokee words for &quot;star&quot; () and &quot;eagle&quot; ().

==Properties==
Gliese 436 is a M2.5V star, which means it is a red dwarf. Stellar models give both an estimated mass and size of about 43% that of the Sun. The same model predicts that the outer atmosphere has an effective temperature of 3,480 K, giving it the orange-red hue of an M-type star. Small stars such as this generate energy at a low rate, giving it only 2.5% of the Sun&#x27;s luminosity.

Gliese 436 is older than the Sun by several billion years and it has an abundance of heavy elements (with masses greater than helium-4) less than half% that of the Sun. The projected rotation velocity is 1.0 km/s, and the chromosphere has a low level of magnetic activity. Gliese 436 is a member of the &quot;old-disk population&quot; with velocity components in the galactic coordinate system of &quot;U&quot;=+44, &quot;V&quot;=−20 and &quot;W&quot;=+20 km/s.

==Planetary system==

The star is orbited by one known planet, designated Gliese 436 b. The planet has an orbital period of 2.6 Earth days and transits the star as viewed from Earth. It has a mass of 22.2 Earth masses and is roughly 55,000 km in diameter, giving it a mass and radius similar to the ice giant planets Uranus and Neptune in the Solar System. In general, Doppler spectroscopy measurements do not measure the true mass of the planet, but instead measure the product m sin i, where m is the true mass and i is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between the line-of-sight and the normal to the planet&#x27;s orbital plane), a quantity that is generally unknown. However, for Gliese 436 b, the transits enable the determination of the inclination, as they show that the planet&#x27;s orbital plane is very nearly in the line of sight (i.e. that the inclination is close to 90 degrees). Hence the mass quoted is the actual mass. The planet is thought to be largely composed of hot ices with an outer envelope of hydrogen and helium, and is termed a &quot;hot Neptune&quot;.

GJ 436 b&#x27;s orbit is likely misaligned with its star&#x27;s rotation. In addition the planet&#x27;s orbit is eccentric. Because tidal forces would tend to circularise the orbit of the planet on short timescales, this suggested that Gliese 436 b is being perturbed by an additional planet orbiting the star.

===Claims of additional planets===
In 2008, a second planet, designated &quot;Gliese 436 c&quot; was claimed to have been discovered, with an orbital period of 5.2 days and an orbital semimajor axis of 0.045 AU. The planet was thought to have a mass of roughly 5 Earth masses and have a radius about 1.5 times larger than the Earth&#x27;s. Due to its size, the planet was thought to be a rocky, terrestrial planet. It was announced by Spanish scientists in April 2008 by analyzing its influence on the orbit of Gliese 436 b. Further analysis showed that the transit length of the inner planet is not changing, a situation which rules out most possible configurations for this system. Also, if it did orbit at these parameters, the system would be the only &quot;unstable&quot; orbit on UA&#x27;s Extrasolar Planet Interactions chart. The existence of this &quot;Gliese 436 c&quot; was thus regarded as unlikely, and the discovery was eventually retracted at the Transiting Planets conference in Boston, 2008.

Despite the retraction, studies concluded that the possibility that there is an additional planet orbiting Gliese 436 remained plausible. With the aid of an unnoticed transit automatically recorded at NMSU on January 11, 2005, and observations by amateur astronomers, it has been suggested that there is a trend of increasing inclination of the orbit of Gliese 436 b, though this trend remains unconfirmed. This trend is compatible with a perturbation by a planet of less than 12 Earth masses on an orbit within about 0.08 AU of the star.

In July 2012, NASA announced that astronomers at the University of Central Florida, using the Spitzer Space Telescope, strongly believed they had observed a second planet. This candidate planet was given the preliminary designation UCF-1.01, after the University of Central Florida. It was measured to have a radius of around two thirds that of Earth and, assuming an Earth-like density of 5.5 g/cm3, was estimated to have a mass of 0.3 times that of Earth and a surface gravity of around two thirds that of Earth. It was thought to orbit at 0.0185 AU from the star, every 1.3659 days. The astronomers also believed they had found some evidence for an additional planet candidate, UCF-1.02, which is of a similar size, though with only one detected transit its orbital period is unknown. Follow up observations with the Hubble Space Telescope as well as a reanalysis of the Spitzer Space Telescope data were unable to confirm these planets.

<doc id="1212480" wikidata="Q16931816" url="?curid=1212480" title="Lady Snowblood (manga)">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written by Kazuo Koike and illustrated by Kazuo Kamimura. It was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Playboy&quot; magazine from February 1972 to March 1973. The series revolves around the title character, a female assassin who seeks vengeance against the bandits who murdered her stepfather and older half-brother and raped her mother.

&quot;Lady Snowblood&quot; was translated into English and published in four volumes by Dark Horse Comics between 2005 and 2006. The manga was adapted into a live-action film of the same name starring Meiko Kaji in 1973, which was followed by &quot;Lady Snowblood: Love Song of Vengeance&quot; in 1974. The manga and film adaptations have influenced a number of other works.

== Title ==
The Japanese title &quot;Shurayuki-hime&quot; is a pun on . Additionally, &quot;shura&quot; nods to the Buddhist path of the asura, in which a devout follower is prepared to kill. The title was translated as &quot;Lady Snowblood&quot; because Asura is associated with the term &quot;shuraba&quot; &quot;scene of a great battle&quot; or &quot;scene of carnage&quot;.

== Plot ==
Four bandits-Shokei Tokuichi, Okono Kitahama, Gishiro Tsukamoto, and Banzo Takemura-murder the husband and son of Sayo, a woman whom they also rape. Sayo kills Tokuichi, but gets locked up in a women&#x27;s prison for life; she then seduces multiple men to conceive a child whom she wants to deliver her vengeance on the three remaining bandits. Months later on a cold snowy night in winter, Sayo gives birth to a baby girl, whom the other women inmates name Oyuki after the snow. Sayo tells the midwife who had delivered Oyuki her story and makes her the girl&#x27;s guardian before dying from childbirth complications.

Raised by the midwife, Oyuki is subjected to hellish training by a Buddhist priest. By the time she growns into an adult, Oyuki has become the assassin known as Syura Yuki (). With her sword concealed in the shaft of her umbrella, Oyuki travels around Japan to hunt down her mother&#x27;s enemies and deliver her vengeance. Along the way, Oyuki does contract killings, seduces her female targets, dons disguises, and even has the pickpocket Kiku-who had served time at the same prison where Oyuki was born-train her to become an expert thief.

After Oyuki gets them a hojicho, an impoverished man named Matsuemon and his fellow beggars aid her by looking for the bandits and informing her of their current whereabouts. Matsuemon even convinces Oyuki to recruit the writer Miyanara, whom she inspires to publish books about her life to draw out her mother&#x27;s enemies and who becomes a father figure to her. With Miyanara and the beggars&#x27; help, Oyuki successfully commits her acts of vengeance: she frames the mastermind Okono as a murderer so she will be convicted; when Tsukamoto discovers Oyuki&#x27;s plan, he holds Miyanara hostage, only to be outsmarted and slain by her; when Takemura begs Oyuki for forgiveness, she kills him and sends his body falling into the sea, yet saves his young daughter, Kobue, from a life of prostitution.

Having avenged her family, Syura Yuki throws her umbrella sword into the sea.

== Characters ==

;Oyuki/Syura Yuki ()
:Oyuki, also known as Syura Yuki, is the main protagonist of the manga. A seductive and beautiful woman, she has formidable skills in using a sword hidden in her umbrella. She has been entrusted with a task of vengeance by her mother Sayo to kill the three surviving criminals who murdered her half-brother and stepfather. When necessary, she uses her sex appeal to distract her foes.

;Miyanara-san
:A writer who pens Oyuki&#x27;s story in an effort to draw the final two tormentors out in the open. Although antagonistic at first, he comes to treat Oyuki as his daughter, even risking his life to assist in her quest. It is implied through their final interaction that Oyuki will return to take care of him, as he is the closest thing to a father that she has ever had.

;Matsuemon-san
:The leader of a band of beggars who assists Oyuki in discovering the location of her kill list in return for Oyuki stealing a hojicho for him.

== Production ==
Written by Kazuo Koike and illustrated by Kazuo Kamimura, &quot;Lady Snowblood&quot; was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Playboy&quot; magazine between February 29, 1972 and March 6, 1973. The chapters were collected and published under the Playboy Zōkan imprint in two volumes on December 10, 1972 and March 15, 1973. Since then the manga has been republished in various editions by different publishers, including a 1976–1977 three volume edition by Akita Shoten, a five volume 1985 edition by Takeshobo, and a two volume 2001 edition by Kadokawa Shoten.

 was serialized in &quot;Weekly Playboy&quot; from November 1973 to June 1974.

&quot;Lady Snowblood&quot; was translated and published in English between 2005–2006 by Dark Horse Comics as a series of four volumes, collected into more-or-less self-contained chapters.

== Media ==

=== English volumes ===



=== Film adaptations ===
In 1973, the manga was adapted into a feature film of the same name by director Toshiya Fujita, starring Meiko Kaji. The film was followed by &quot;Lady Snowblood: Love Song of Vengeance&quot; in 1974. A science fiction remake titled &quot;The Princess Blade&quot;, starring Yumiko Shaku, was released in 2001.

&quot;Lady Snowblood&quot; and its 1973 adaptation are credited as major sources of inspiration behind Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Kill Bill: Volume One&quot; and &quot;Two&quot; and its protagonist The Bride (Beatrix Kiddo), as well as the Marvel Comics supervillainess Lady Bullseye (Maki Matsumoto), created by Ed Brubaker, Marko Djurdjevic, and Clay Mann, and voiced by Reiko Aylesworth in the animated series &quot;Hit-Monkey&quot;.

Additionally, the manga and film adaptation are an inspiration for the 2021 anime series &quot;&quot;.

=== Stage adaptations ===
In November 2021, the stage adaptation of the manga was performed at the CBGK Shibugeki theater in Tokyo, with Yui Imaizumi as the main character. A sequel titled was performed in February 2022.

=== Video game adaptations ===
Character of Setsuka from the SoulCalibur franchise (started as a &quot;Soul Edge&quot; in the first entry of the series) of fighting video games was heavily inspired by Oyuki, both in visuals and her fighting/fencing style. Setsuka uses a knife concealed in an umbrella, exactly the same way Oyuki does, and also has nearly identical backstory and motivations for her actions in all respective SoulCalibur games where she appears. Some of Setsuka&#x27;s extra costumes and additional color palettes directly reference and mirror Oyuki&#x27;s clothes in original Lady Snowblood manga and both movie adaptations.

== Reception ==
Tom Rosin from &quot;Manga Life&quot; considers &quot;Lady Snowblood&quot; &quot;another cold-blooded revenge drama from the author of &quot;Lone Wolf&quot;&quot;, and says he enjoyed the mix of Western modernization and Japanese traditionalism. W .E. Wallo from Blogcritics.org finds the English translation weak compared to that of &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;, but recommends it to any fans of the latter series. Similarly to Tom Rosin, he praises the prevalent East–West dichotomy.

<text>The Battle of Cienfuegos, also known as the Raid on Cienfuegos, was an engagement of the Spanish–American War, intended by the United States Navy to tighten its blockade of Cuba.

==Background==
The Spanish were using undersea cables as a means to communicate with not only the rest of Cuba, but also the Spanish command. These cables had many key junctions, namely, a shore near Cienfuegos. The cables connected to Havana, the port of Santiago, and then branched off to other Caribbean islands such as Jamaica. The cables were run out from an easily located house which contained a critical hub for the undersea cable system. While the house could easily be destroyed, this would only inflict largely superficial damage, and could easily be repaired and functioning in a short period of time. Therefore, command decided to grapple the three cables out of the sea and cut them in several places, disrupting much of the communications between the Spanish and their operations in Cuba. This damage would be much more difficult to repair, as the cables were nearing two inches in diameter which made cutting, and by extension repairing them, a difficult task. For the mission, the cruiser USS &quot;Marblehead&quot;, the gunboat USS &quot;Nashville&quot;, and the revenue cutter USS &quot;Windom&quot; were dispatched under the command of Captain Bowman H. McCalla to sever them.

==Battle==

The &quot;Marblehead&quot; and &quot;Nashville&quot; both opened fire on the cable house at 6:45 a.m. on May 11, 1898. Rather quickly, the cable house collapsed from the fire from the two warships. Ten minutes later, at 6:55 a.m. the warships dispatched their work boats, each carrying a minimal crew of sixteen, in order to minimize the risk of casualty. The element of surprise was quickly lost, as a Spanish Cavalryman spotted the ships en route to the beach.

While the first cable was out of the line of fire, the second cable was not so easy to cut. Because of coral formation, the cable was very difficult to snare in order to bring it up to the surface and cut. The Spanish forces were also much closer to the second cable, so the crew had to contend with both of these problems. In order to suppress the increased fire from the Spanish forces, both warships increased their bombardment. As the raid crew hauled up the second cable to cut it, they discovered a third, smaller cable. After the second had been cut, they moved on to find this third and final cable. They were not able to however, as a large contingent of Spanish forces arrived from Cienfuegos to repel what they thought at the time was a full-scale invasion. By 11:15 a.m. the raid was over.

After a tense, hour-long firefight, two cables were cut, and the sailors and Marines withdrew, but a third cable near the shore remained untouched.

==Aftermath==
Fifty-two US sailors and marines were awarded the Medal of Honor for &quot;setting an example of extraordinary bravery and coolness under fire.&quot;

<doc id="1212489" wikidata="Q953129" url="?curid=1212489" title="Reflexive pronoun">
<text>A reflexive pronoun is a pronoun that refers to another noun or pronoun (its antecedent) within the same sentence.
In the English language specifically, a reflexive pronoun will end in &quot;-self&quot; or &quot;-selves&quot;, and refer to a previously named noun or pronoun (&quot;myself&quot;, &quot;yourself&quot;, &quot;ourselves&quot;, &quot;themselves&quot;, etc.). English intensive pronouns, used for emphasis, take the same form.
In generative grammar, a reflexive pronoun is an anaphor that must be bound by its antecedent (see binding). In a general sense, it is a noun phrase that obligatorily gets its meaning from another noun phrase in the sentence. Different languages have different binding domains for reflexive pronouns, according to their structure.

==Origins and usage of reflexive pronouns==

In Indo-European languages, the reflexive pronoun has its origins in Proto-Indo-European. In some languages, some distinction exists between normal object and reflexive pronouns, mainly in the third person: whether one says &quot;I like me&quot; or &quot;I like myself&quot;, there is no question that the object is the same person as the subject; but, in &quot;They like them(selves)&quot;, there can be uncertainty about the identity of the object unless a distinction exists between the reflexive and the nonreflexive. In some languages, this distinction includes genitive forms: see, for instance, the Danish examples below. In languages with a distinct reflexive pronoun form, it is often gender-neutral.

A reflexive pronoun is normally used when the object of a sentence is the same as the subject. Each personal pronoun (such as &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot;) has its own reflexive form:
* &quot;I — myself&quot;
* &quot;thou — thyself/thyselves&quot; (archaic)
* &quot;he — himself&quot; 
* &quot;she — herself&quot; 
* &quot;it — itself&quot;
* &quot;we — ourselves&quot;
* &quot;you — yourself/yourselves&quot; 
* &quot;they — themself/themselves&quot; 
* &quot;one — oneself&quot;

These pronouns can also be used &quot;intensively&quot;, to emphasize the identity of whomever or whatever is being talked about:

* Jim bought himself a book (reflexive)
* Jim himself bought a book (intensive)
Intensive pronouns usually appear near and/or before the subject of the sentence.
Usually after prepositions of locality it is preferred to use a personal object pronoun rather than a reflexive pronoun:
* Close the door &quot;after you.&quot; (NOT &quot;... after yourself.&quot;)
* He was pulling a small cart &quot;behind him.&quot; (NOT &quot;... behind himself.&quot;)
* She took her dog &quot;with her.&quot; (NOT ... &quot;with herself.&quot;)
Compare:

* She&#x27;s very pleased &quot;with herself.&quot; (NOT ... &quot;with her.&quot;)
Certain verbs have reflexive pronouns in some languages but not in English:
* Do you &quot;shave&quot; on Sundays? (NOT Do you &quot;shave yourself&quot; on Sundays?)
* Try to &quot;concentrate.&quot; (NOT Try to &quot;concentrate yourself&quot;)
* I &quot;feel&quot; strange&quot;.&quot; (NOT I &quot;feel myself&quot; strange.)

Compare to French:

* (&quot;te&quot; is the second person singular reflexive pronoun in French, but it can serve as an object pronoun)
* 
The list of such verbs:
* &quot;complain, concentrate, get up/hot/tired, lie down, meet, relax, remember, sit down, wake up, shave, undress, wash, acclimatise, adapt, behave, hide, move...&quot;

==Non-reflexive usage in English==

Non-reflexive use of reflexive pronouns is rather common in English. Most of the time, reflexive pronouns function as emphatic pronouns that highlight or emphasize the individuality or particularity of the noun. Grammatically, the position of reflexive pronouns in this usage is either right after the noun the pronouns are emphasizing or, if the noun is subject, after-verb-or-object position is also possible. For example, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you &quot;yourself&quot; do the job?&quot;, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you do the job &quot;yourself&quot;?&quot;, or &quot;I want to fix my phone &quot;itself&quot;; I will not fix your watch as well.&quot;
Some speakers use reflexive pronouns without local linguistic antecedents to refer to discourse participants or people already referenced in a discourse: for example, &quot;Please, forward the information to &quot;myself&quot;, Anything else for &quot;yourself&quot; today?&quot; Within the linguistics literature, reflexives with discourse antecedents are often referred to as logophors. Standard English allows use of logophors in some contexts: for example, &quot;John was angry. Embarrassing pictures of himself were on display.&quot; However, within Standard English, this logophoric use of reflexives is generally limited to positions where the reflexive does not have a coargument. The newer non-standard usage does not respect this limitation. In some cases, reflexives without local antecedents may be better analyzed as emphatic pronouns without any true reflexive sense.
It is common in some dialects of English to use standard object pronouns to express reflexive relations, especially in the first and sometimes second persons, and especially for a recipient: for example, &quot;I want to get me some supper.&quot; While this was seemingly standard in Old English through the Early Modern Period (with &quot;self&quot; constructs primarily used for emphatic purposes), it is held to be dialectal or nonstandard in Modern English.
It is also common in informal speech to use &quot;myself&quot; in a conjunctive phrase when &#x27;me&#x27; would suffice: &quot;She stood by Jane and myself.&quot; Also &quot;myself&quot; is used when &#x27;I&#x27; would also be appropriate; for example, Thomas Jefferson was quoted as saying, &quot;Hamilton and myself were daily pitted in the cabinet like two cocks.&quot;

==In languages other than English==

===Chinese===

In Mandarin Chinese, the reflexive pronoun is , meaning &quot;self&quot;. The antecedent it refers to can be inferred by context, which is generally the subject of the sentence:
* 。(Take care of &quot;(your)self&quot;.)
* 。(&quot;I&quot;&#x27;ll take care of &quot;(my)self&quot;.)

The antecedent can be reiterated before the reflexive pronoun; this can be used to refer to an antecedent that&#x27;s not the subject:
* 。(I gave him &quot;his own&quot; book.)
* 。(I gave him &quot;my own&quot; book.)
Like English, the reflexive can also be used to emphasize the antecedent:
* 。(&quot;He&quot; took it &quot;(him)self&quot;.)
The reflexive can also be the subject of an embedded clause.
* 。 (&quot;He&quot; considers &quot;(him)self&quot; very clever. &quot;He&quot; feels that &quot;he&quot; is very clever.)
Also unlike English, the reflexive can refer to antecedents outside of the embedded clause. Because of this, it may be ambiguous whether the antecedent refers to the subject of the main clause or the embedded clause, in which case it may be necessary to reiterate the antecedent:

* 。(I feel that &quot;Mr. Wang&quot; likes you more than he likes &quot;(him)self&quot;.)
* 。(I feel that &quot;Mr. Wang&quot; likes you more than he likes &quot;myself&quot;.)

The reflexive pronoun in Cantonese Chinese, &quot;jihgéi&quot;, cognate to Mandarin &quot;zìjǐ&quot; (and thus also written as ), also follows the same rules. This was also the case in Classical Chinese, which simply used (Old Chinese: *&quot;kəʔ&quot;).

===Danish===

Danish uses the separate reflexive pronoun &quot;&quot; for third person pronouns, and &#x27;selv&#x27; to mark intensive.
* (&quot;I protect myself&quot;)
In Danish, there is also a difference between normal and reflexive genitives, the latter being used only in the singular:
* (Anna gave Maria her [&quot;Maria&#x27;s, or possibly some unknown third person&#x27;s&quot;] book.)
* (Anna gave Maria her [&quot;Anna&#x27;s&quot;] book.)
In the latter case, is a case of a &quot;reflexive possessive pronoun&quot;, i.e. it reflects that the subject in the phrase (Anna) owns the object (the book).

===Esperanto===

The Esperanto third-person reflexive pronoun is , or for the possessive (to which can be added &quot;-j&quot; for plural agreement and &quot;-n&quot; for direct object).
* (&quot;He reads his (someone else&#x27;s) books.&quot;)
* (&quot;He reads his (own) books.&quot;)

===French===

In French, the main reflexive pronoun is , with its indefinite form .
There are also intensifying reflexive pronouns, such as , , , , and , similar in meaning (but not often used) to myself, yourself, etc.

French also uses reflexive verbs to express actions that somebody is doing to themselves. Many of these are related to daily routine. For example,
* (I get washed, lit &quot;I wash myself&quot;)

===German===

In German, the reflexive case is not distinguishable from the accusative and dative cases except in the third person reflexive. As discussed above, the reflexive case is most useful when handling third person because it is not always clear that pronouns refer to the same person, whereas in the first and second persons, it is clear: &quot;he hit him&quot; and &quot;he hit himself&quot; have different meanings, but &quot;I hit me&quot; and &quot;I hit myself&quot; mean the same thing although the former is nonstandard English.
Because the accusative and dative cases are different, the speaker must know whether the verb is reflexive accusative or reflexive dative. There are very few reflexive dative verbs, which must be memorised to ensure that the correct grammar is used. The most notable one is (to hurt oneself): (I hurt myself.) See also German pronouns.

=== Hindi/Urdu ===
In Hindi, there are two primary reflexive pronouns, the reflexive pronoun () [from PIE ] meaning &quot;self&quot; and pronoun () [from PII &quot;self&quot;] which is the possessive reflexive pronoun and both these pronouns are used with all the three, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, persons. There is also the pronoun () which is used with either the inessive case-marker () forming the reflexive pronoun () meaning &quot;among ourselves&quot; or the genitive postpostion () forming the reflexing pronoun () meaning &quot;of ourselves&quot;. The genitive reflexive pronoun can also be used to emphasise when used with the personal genitive pronouns, so e.g. () &quot;mine&quot; becomes () &quot;my very own&quot;. Alternatively, using the genitive postposition () with () gives () meaning the same as ().
These reflexive pronouns can be used with case-marking postpositions as shown below in the table to the right.
===Hungarian===

Hungarian has two primary means of expressing reflexivity.

==== Mag- ====
The most common is by means of the stem &quot;mag-&quot; which behaves much like standard postpositions and case endings in Hungarian in that it can take the six personal suffixes to form the following personal pronouns: 
* &quot;magam&quot; (myself)
* &quot;magad&quot; (yourself)
* &quot;maga&quot; (himself/herself)
* &quot;magunk&quot; (ourselves)
* &quot;magatok&quot; (yourselves)
* &quot;maguk&quot; (themselves)

Thus formed, these reflexive pronouns are in the nominative (i.e. subject) case and can take any case ending or postposition: &quot;magamnak&quot; (for myself), &quot;magunk előtt&quot; (in front of ourselves), &quot;magát&quot; (himself/herself (acc.)). However the accusative case marking &quot;-t&quot; is often omitted in &quot;magamat&quot; (myself), and &quot;magadat&quot; (yourself) remaining &quot;magam&quot; and &quot;magad&quot; respectively. This is also the case with possessed nouns using the same personal endings e.g. &quot;házam&quot; (my house), and &quot;kocsid&quot; (your car) both of which can be interpreted in less formal language as either nominative or accusative depending on context. Nonetheless, using the accusative ending &quot;-t&quot; (as in &quot;házamat&quot; and &quot;kocsidat&quot;) is still considered formal and correct.

Relfexive pronouns in the nominative case exist but have no logical reflexive function. Rather they have an intensifying purpose and follow the subject (if given): 
* &quot;ő maga csinálta&quot; (He himself did it)
* &quot;a kutya maga ásta a gödröt&quot; (the dog himself dug the hole)
* &quot;magam is így gondoltam&quot; (I myself am also of this mind) 
note the absence of non-reflexive subject pronoun in the latter case where the verb marking implies the subject. In order to intensify a relfexive pronoun in any other case, i.e. a reflexive pronoun with a genuine reflexive grammatical function the word &quot;saját&quot; (one&#x27;s own) is added before the reflexive pronoun: 
* &quot;saját magának okoz gondot&quot; (he&#x27;s making trouble for his own self).

==== Ön ====
The second reflexive mechanism in Hungarian is the word &quot;ön&quot; (self) which is most commonly used as a prefix with the meaning of &quot;(one)self-&quot;, For example &quot;öngyilkos&quot; (suicide victim, lit. &quot;self-murderer&quot;) and &quot;önfeláldozni&quot; (to sacrifice oneself). This can be combined with the reflexive pronouns above to express intensity or formality:
* &quot;önmagam&quot; (myself)
* &quot;önmagad&quot; (yourself)
* &quot;önmaga&quot; (himself/herself)
* &quot;önmagunk&quot; (ourselves)
* &quot;önmagatok&quot; (yourselves)
* &quot;önmaguk&quot; (themselves)
The prefix &quot;ön&quot; can also be used in the manner of &quot;saját&quot;, above, but the sense is more formal than intensive.

==== Formal Pronouns ====

Hungarian does not have a T-V distinction as in many European languages, rather it uses third person reflexive pronouns and third person verbs to indicate politeness. The singular pronouns &quot;ön&quot; (self) and &quot;maga&quot; (himself/herself) and the plural pronouns &quot;önök&quot; (selves) and &quot;maguk&quot; (themselves) are used when addressing one or more people (respectively) in a formal context, whether written or spoken. Largely seen as interchangeable, &quot;ön&quot; and &quot;önök&quot; are less common and perceived as somewhat more formal than &quot;maga&quot; and &quot;maguk&quot;. The combined forms &quot;önmaga&quot; and &quot;önmaguk&quot; are only used to express intensity and genuine reflexivity as laid out above, but are not used as non-reflexive formal/polite pronouns.

Grammatically, when using &quot;ön&quot;, &quot;maga&quot;, &quot;önök&quot;, or &quot;maguk&quot; as subject pronouns, they will be treated as though they were non-reflexive third person pronouns. This means verbs agree with a third person subject (despite having a second person referent in reality) but unlike a true reflexive object pronoun (which requires a definite verb ending), verbs using formal/polite pronouns conjugate for definite or indefinite objects as that verb&#x27;s actual object requires. Compare the following:

* &quot;(ti) mostok&quot; (you (pl.) are washing [informal]) 
Here the verb uses the second person plural indefinite ending -tok indicating that the object of the verb is unclear or non-existent.
* &quot;(ti) magatokat mossátok&quot; (you (pl.) are washing yourselves [informal])
Here the verb has changed from the second person plural indefinite ending to the definite ending -játok to indicate the reflexive object.
* &quot;(ők) mosnak&quot; (they are washing [informal])
Here the verb uses the third person plural indefinite ending -nak
* &quot;maguk mosnak or &quot;önök mosnak (you (pl.) are washing [formal]) 
Here the verb also uses the third person plural indefinite ending -nak as the formal pronoun is third person, but unlike true reflexives, it does not require a definite verb ending.
* &quot;magukat mossák&quot; (&quot;they are washing themselves&quot; or &quot;you (pl.) are washing yourselves&quot; [formal])
Here the verb is conjugated with the third person plural definite ending -ják as the pronoun is a genuine reflexive. In this case, it is not possible to tell from the sentence alone whether the intention is third person informal, or second person formal. In reality however when clarity is required an explicit subject pronoun can be used to express informal third person (&quot;ők magukat mossák&quot;), or more formal language can be used to express formal second person usage (&quot;magukat tetszik mosni&quot; lit. &quot;it pleases to wash oneselves&quot;).

===Icelandic===

There is only one reflexive pronoun in Icelandic and that is the word &quot;&quot;. It does not differ between genders nor number.
The reflexive pronouns are as such:
* Reflexive pronoun: (himself/itself/herself/themselves)
* : (his/her/its/their)


====Examples====

The reflexive pronoun refers to the third person:
* .(masc. sing.) (He talks about &quot;himself&quot;)

===Italian===

The reflexive pronouns in Italian are:
* (first person singular)
* (second person singular)
* (third person singular)
* (first person plural)
* (second person plural)
* (third person plural)
Reflexive pronouns are usually employed when the direct object in a sentence is also its subject, thus reflecting the action as expressed in the verb on the subject itself.
This pronoun allows the building of three kinds of reflexive verbal forms: proper, non-proper (or ostensible), and reciprocal.
* , or (I wash myself): reflexive proper, because the subject is at the same time the object of the sentence.

Notice that the sentence &quot;I wash myself&quot; could also be translated in Italian as , stressing the reflexiveness much more than English.

The complete list of intensifying reflexive pronouns is:
* (first person masculine singular)
* (first person feminine singular)
* (second person masculine singular)
* (second person feminine singular)
* (third person masculine singular)
* (third person feminine singular)
* (first person masculine plural)
* (first person feminine plural)
* (second person masculine plural)
* (second person feminine plural)
* (third person masculine plural)
* (third person feminine plural)

===Japanese===

In the Japanese language, () and () are reflexive pronouns that correspond roughly to &#x27;oneself&#x27;. They differ from English in some ways; for example, and do not have to agree in gender or number where English reflexives do. can further be bound locally or long distance where English reflexives must always occur locally. Although both English and Japanese pronouns must be c-commanded by their antecedents, because of the syntactic structure of Japanese, long distance binding is allowed.

===Korean===

In Korean, and are used as reflexive pronouns that refer to &#x27;myself&#x27;, &#x27;himself&#x27;, &#x27;herself&#x27;, and &#x27;ourselves&#x27;. is also a reflexive pronoun but it usually corresponds only to the first person (myself).

===Latin===

In the first and second persons, Latin uses the ordinary oblique forms of the personal pronouns as reflexive pronouns. In the third person, Latin uses the special reflexive pronoun , which is the same for all genders and numbers, and declined in all cases except the nominative and the vocative.

====Example====

===Macedonian===

An alternative full form, , is used for emphasis.
* (Ana gave her [&quot;Maria&#x27;s&quot;] book to Maria.)
* (Ana gave her [&quot;Ana&#x27;s&quot;] book to Maria.)

===Novial===

(Novial is a constructed language, mostly based on Romance languages.)
* (He sees him.)

===Polish===

====Oblique====
 
In Polish the oblique reflexive pronouns is and it declines as above. It is used with 1st, 2nd and 3rd person:
* &quot;I wash myself&quot;
* &quot;You wash yourself&quot;
* &quot;Peter washes himself&quot;

It has been grammaticalized to a high degree, becoming also a marker of medial and/or anti-causative voice:
* &quot;Door opened&quot;, lit. &quot;Door opened itself&quot;
* &quot;We fell&quot;, lit. &quot;We turned ourselves over&quot;

Similarly, the dative gained an additional, volitional/liberative meaning, usually used in informal speech:
* &quot;So, I&#x27;m casually walking down the street and suddenly I see 10 zloty just lying there.&quot;, lit. &quot;I&#x27;m walking for myself, I&#x27;m looking for myself, and there lies for itself 10 zloty&quot;
* &quot;I&#x27;m a kindergartner&quot; (from children&#x27;s song)

Moreover, the phrase has been lexicalized and means &quot;to leave&quot; (cf. French ):
* &quot;This party&#x27;s boring, I&#x27;m leaving&quot;

====Possessive====

Polish also has a possessive reflexive pronoun . It assumes the gender of the possessed object, not that of the possessor.
* &quot;He took his (own) things and went out.&quot;
* &quot;He looked at his (own) phone.&quot;
* &quot;Anna gave her (Anna&#x27;s) book to Cathy.&quot;
Not using a reflexive pronoun might indicate the other party&#x27;s possession of the object:

* &quot;Anna returned Cathy&#x27;s book&quot;

====Intensive====

The intensive meaning is done by the pronoun (inflecting for case, gender and number):


Usually inflected is added in obliques:
* (fem.) &quot;I listen to myself&quot;
* (fem.) &quot;I believe myself&quot;

Emphatically the accusative can be replaced with dative:
* (masc.) &quot;I did it myself&quot;, &quot;I did it alone&quot;
* (masc.) &quot;I did it myself&quot;, &quot;I did it personally&quot;

===Portuguese===

* (&quot;When he sees him.&quot;)
* (&quot;When he sees himself.&quot;)

There are two ways to make a reflexive sentence in Portuguese. The first way is by attaching the reflexive pronoun (me, te, se, nos - also vos) to the verb. The second way is by also attaching the words or , masc/fem. (plural) (=&quot;self&quot;), immediately after the verb to add stress/intensity :

* (I hurt myself.)

===Romanian===

* Dative: himself, herself
* Accusative: himself, herself

=== Russian ===

In Russian, the pronoun universally means &quot;oneself&quot;/&quot;myself&quot;/&quot;himself&quot;, etc. It is inflected depending on the case.

When used to indicate that the person is the direct object of the verb, one uses the accusative form, . (It does not have a nominative form.)

* . . (&quot;He has wounded himself.&quot;)

Emphasized forms are &quot;sam sebya&quot; - masculine, &quot;sama sebya&quot; - feminine, &quot;sami sebya&quot; - plural. However, the word &quot;sam&quot; usually comes after the noun it is emphasizing.

* . . (&quot;He has wounded himself.&quot; Literally: &quot;He himself has wounded himself.&quot;)

This sentence underlines that the subject inflicted the wounds while in the previous example, &quot;sebya&quot; merely indicates that the subject was wounded.

In addition, the reflexive pronoun gave rise the reflexive affix () used to generate reflexive verbs, but in this context the affix indicates that the action happened accidentally:

* (He has wounded himself by accident.)

There are certain stylistic differences between the three usages, despite being rendered in the same way in English.

When the person is not a direct object of the verb, other cases are used:
* . . (&quot;He brought a bottle of vodka with himself.&quot;) - instrumental case
* . (&quot;He dropped a bag on his (own) foot.&quot; Literally: &quot;He dropped a bag to himself on the foot.&quot;) - dative case

Compare:

* . . (&quot;He dropped a bag on his (someone else&#x27;s) foot.&quot;)

Russian has a reflexive possessive as well.

* (&quot;He loves his wife (his own).&quot; - Reflexive possessive)
* (&quot;He loves his wife (someone else&#x27;s).&quot; - It is ambiguous in English, but less so in Russian.)

Because of the existence of reflexive forms, the use of a non-reflexive pronoun indicates a subject that is different from the object. If it is impossible, the sentence is invalid or at least irregular:

* . . (&quot;He has wounded him (someone else).&quot;)

===Serbo-Croatian===

Serbo-Croatian uses the reflexive pronoun , which is the same for all persons, numbers and genders, and declined as follows:
 
* (&quot;Ana gave &quot;her&quot; [Maria&#x27;s] book to Maria.&quot;)
* (&quot;Ana gave &quot;her&quot; [Ana&#x27;s] book to Maria.&quot;)

The words that modify the reflexive pronoun do show gender and number:
* &quot;He wondered at himself.&quot;
The enclitic form of the reflexive pronoun, &quot;se&quot;, has been grammaticalized to a high degree:
* lit. &quot;Door opened itself&quot; (&quot;Door opened&quot;)
* lit. &quot;We turned ourselves over&quot; (&quot;We fell&quot;)

===Spanish===

In Spanish, the reflexive pronouns are: (first person singular/plural), (second person) or (third person). In Latin America, is not used, being replaced by for the pronoun . For clarity, there are optional intensifying adjuncts for reflexive pronouns, accompanied by (masculine and feminine forms for &quot;self&quot;). They are not strictly adjuncts: (instead of ), (in the Río de la Plata region, it is replaced by ), —they usually postpend the genitive.

Example with &quot;wash oneself&quot;:
* &quot;(I wash myself.)&quot;

Note that the indirect object &quot;le&quot;/&quot;les&quot; does &quot;not&quot; override &quot;se&quot; in the reflexive.

===Slovene===

The Slovene language has reflexive pronouns as well:
* (&quot;Ana gave her&quot; [Maria&#x27;s] &quot;book to Maria.&quot;)
* (&quot;Ana gave her&quot; [Ana&#x27;s] &quot;book to Maria.&quot;)

=== Uzbek ===

In Uzbek, the pronoun (), refers to &quot;oneself&quot; and, to create a person specific forms, it requires certain affixes:

&quot;myself&quot; - + =&gt; (); to &quot;myself&quot; - + =&gt; (); from &quot;myself&quot; - + =&gt; ();

&quot;yourself&quot; - + =&gt; (); to &quot;yourself&quot; - + =&gt; (); from &quot;yourself&quot; - + =&gt; ();

&quot;himself&quot;/ &quot;herself&quot;/ &quot;itself&quot; - + =&gt; (); to &quot;himself&quot;/ &quot;herself&quot;/ &quot;itself&quot;- + =&gt; (); from &quot;himself&quot;/ &quot;herself&quot;/ &quot;itself&quot;- + =&gt; ();

&quot;ourselves&quot; - + =&gt; (); to &quot;ourselves&quot;- + =&gt; (); from &quot;ourselves&quot; - + =&gt; ();

&quot;yourselves&quot; - + =&gt; (); to &quot;yourselves&quot; - + =&gt; (); from &quot;yourselves&quot; - + =&gt; ();

&quot;themselves&quot; - + =&gt; (); to &quot;themselves&quot;- + =&gt; (); from &quot;themselves&quot;- + =&gt; ();

Emphatic-pronoun use:

&quot;myself&quot; - + =&gt; ()

&quot;yourself&quot; - + =&gt; ()

&quot;himself&quot;/ &quot;herself&quot;/ &quot;itself&quot; - + =&gt; ()

&quot;ourselves&quot; - + =&gt; ()

&quot;yourselves&quot; - + =&gt; ()

&quot;themselves&quot; - + =&gt; ()

Basically, the suffixes change based on the preposition used:

* (John bought &quot;himself&quot; a car)
* (We hurt &quot;ourselves&quot; playing football)
* (This refrigerator defrosts &quot;itself&quot; )
* (I&#x27;m annoyed &quot;with myself&quot;)
* (They looked &quot;at themselves&quot;)
* (Take care &quot;of yourselves&quot;)

===Vietnamese===

In Vietnamese, the reflexive pronoun is whose meaning can be &quot;myself&quot;, &quot;herself&quot;, &quot;himself&quot;, &quot;themselves&quot; etc. depending on the number/gender of its antecedent. 
* (John hit himself.)

=== Guugu Yimithirr ===

A Pama–Nyungan language, Guugu Yimithirr uses the suffix &quot;/-gu/&quot; on pronouns—much like &quot;-self&quot; in English, to emphasize that the action of the verb is performed by the subject and not someone else. Take for example, the following exchange.

A:

B:

<text>Mountain running is a sports discipline which takes place mainly off-road in mountainous terrain, but if there is significant elevation gain on the route, surfaced roads may be used. In this it differs from fell running; also its courses are more clearly marked and avoid dangerous sections. It is a form of trail running if it is run on unpaved surfaces. Mountain running is a combination of running, jogging, and walking, depending on how steep the trail is.

It is recognized by World Athletics and governed by the World Mountain Running Association which has been organising world championships since 1985.

==What is Mountain Running?==
The World Mountain Running Association (WMRA) is the global governing body of mountain running. For World Athletics purposes, mountain running takes place on terrain that is mainly off-road, but if there is significant elevation gain on the route, surfaced roads may be used. Courses involve considerable amounts of ascent (for mainly uphill races), or both ascent and descent (for up and down races with the start and finish at similar heights). The average incline is normally between five and twenty percent. Courses are clearly marked and should avoid dangerous sections.

==World Championships==

The WMRA co-organises a bi-annual world championships, the event is called the World Mountain and Trail Running Championships and was first held in Chiang Mai, Thailand in 2022. Until 2019 there was a standalone World Mountain Running Championships also known for a time as the World Mountain Running Trophy, the World Long Distance Mountain Running Championships was discontinued in 2019 after the adoption of the new combined event.

==Mountain Running World Cup==
The World Mountain Running Association runs an annual World Cup competition, which pulls together the best athletes in a series of the biggest and most prominent races in the sport. The Valsir Mountain Running World Cup usually takes place between July and October predominantly in Continental Europe. The series encompasses a variety of races in categories including; Classic (Up &amp; Down), Vertical (Steep Uphill &gt; 20%) and Long Distance Mountain Running with there usually being at least 3 races making up each category.

<doc id="1212497" wikidata="Q362009" url="?curid=1212497" title="Victor Serge">
<text>Victor Serge (; December 30, 1890 – November 17, 1947), born Victor Lvovich Kibalchich (), was a Russian writer, poet, Marxist revolutionary, and historian. Originally an anarchist, he joined the Bolsheviks five months after arriving in Petrograd in January 1919 and later worked for the Comintern as a journalist, editor and translator. He was critical of the Stalinist regime and remained a revolutionary Marxist until his death. He was a close supporter of the Left Opposition and associate of Leon Trotsky.

According to William Giraldi, Serge&#x27;s novels may be &quot;read like an alloy of&quot; George Orwell and Franz Kafka: &quot;the uncommon political acuity of Orwell and the absurdist comedy of Kafka, a comedy with the damning squint of satire, except the satire is real.&quot; In his studies of Serge, Richard Greeman described him as a Modernist writer influenced by James Joyce, Andrei Bely and Freud; Greeman also believed that Serge, although writing in French, continued the experiments of such Russian Soviet writers as Isaac Babel, Osip Mandelstam, and Boris Pilnyak, and poets Vladimir Mayakovsky and Sergei Yesenin.

Serge is remembered as the author of novels and other prose works, memoirs (e.g. &quot;Memoirs of a Revolutionary&quot;) and poetry. Among his novels chronicling the lives of Soviet people and revolutionaries and of the first half of the 20th century, the best-known is &quot;The Case of Comrade Tulayev&quot; (). Nicholas Lezard calls the novel &quot; of the great 20th-century Russian novels&quot; that follows the traditions of &quot;Gogolian absurdity&quot;.

==Early life==
Serge was born in Belgium to Russian revolutionaries in exile. He had little formal schooling and left home in his teens. He lived in a French mining village, worked as a typesetter, and went to Paris. While in Paris he became an anarchist and editor of one of the movement&#x27;s newspapers.

During that time, Serge was caught up in the trial of the Bonnot Gang with his then-wife Rirette Maîtrejean and others. Some of the accused were executed, the women were acquitted, and Serge was sentenced to five years imprisonment for refusing to testify. He was 22 years old at the time of his sentencing and was released in 1917.

In 1919, Serge arrived in revolutionary Russia during the civil war between the Red (revolutionary) and White (counter-revolutionary) armies. While concerned that the Bolsheviks were repressing opposition to their left, he later wrote, &quot;Even if there was only one chance in a hundred for the regeneration of the revolution and its workers&#x27; democracy, that chance had to be taken.&quot;

== Emigration and death ==
Serge was arrested in 1928, shortly after Leon Trotsky, with whom he had sometimes associated, and confined to Leningrad until 1933, a time in which his second wife Liouba Roussakov began to suffer from mental illness.

Following international pressure on the USSR over its treatment of writers and other cultural figures in the Moscow trials, Serge was expelled from the USSR in 1936 and left for Belgium and France, where he returned to Paris. Roussakov came with him, as did their son Vlady, but Roussakov was institutionalized in 1937, following the move to Paris. Serge met the Italian-born archaeologist Laurette Séjourné. Upon the German invasion of France in 1941, Serge decided to leave Europe, seeking passage to the United States, where he could not obtain a visa. He accepted passage for Mexico despite having heard of Trotsky&#x27;s recent assassination there. He took an oceanliner for Mexico (sharing a passage with Claude Levi-Strauss and Andre Breton), with Séjourné joining him in 1942. They married that year, but in Mexico Serge was beset with fear of arrest or assassination and struggled to work. He died in 1947 and was buried in Mexico City.

<text>Charles Arthur Floyd (February 3, 1904 – October 22, 1934), nicknamed Pretty Boy Floyd, was an American bank robber. He operated in the West and Central states, and his criminal exploits gained widespread press coverage in the 1930s. He was seen positively by the public because, during robberies, he burned mortgage documents freeing many people from their debts. He was pursued and killed by a group of Bureau of Investigation (BOI, later renamed FBI) agents led by Melvin Purvis. Historians have speculated as to which officers were at the event, but accounts document that local officers Robert &quot;Pete&quot; Pyle and George Curran were present at his fatal shooting and also at his embalming. Floyd has continued to be a familiar figure in American popular culture, sometimes seen as notorious, other times portrayed as a tragic figure, even a victim of the hard times of the Great Depression in the United States. Floyd is viewed by many as a prime example of a real life anti-hero.

==Early life==
Floyd was born in Adairsville, Georgia, in 1904 to Walter Lee Floyd and Mamie Helene (née Echols). His family moved to Akins, Oklahoma, in 1911, and he grew up there. He was arrested at age 18 after he stole $3.50 (adjusted for inflation would be $50 in 2023) from a local post office. Three years later, he was arrested for a payroll robbery on September 16, 1925, in St. Louis, Missouri, and was sentenced to five years in prison. He served three and a half years before being granted parole.
Floyd entered into partnerships with criminals in the Kansas City underworld after his parole. He committed a series of bank robberies over the next several years, and it was during this period that he acquired the nickname &quot;Pretty Boy,&quot; although accounts differ. In one account Orville Drake gave him the name because he would wear a white button-up dress shirt and slacks to work in the oil fields. The men on the rig began calling him &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; which was later turned into &quot;Pretty Boy Floyd&quot;. In another account, the payroll master in the 1925 St. Louis Kroger office holdup described one of the robbers as &quot;a pretty boy with apple cheeks&quot;. Floyd despised the nickname.

In 1929, Floyd was wanted in numerous cases. On March 9, he was arrested in Kansas City on investigation, and again on May 7 for vagrancy and suspicion of highway robbery, but he was released the next day. Two days later, he was arrested in Pueblo, Colorado, and charged with vagrancy. He was fined $50.00 and sentenced to 60 days in jail.

Floyd was arrested in Akron, Ohio, on March 8, 1930, under the alias Frank Mitchell and charged with the murder of an Akron police officer who had been killed during a robbery that evening. He was arrested in Toledo, Ohio, for bank robbery and murder on May 20. He was convicted of a Sylvania, Ohio, bank robbery and sentenced on November 24, 1930, to 12 to 15 years in Ohio State penitentiary, but he escaped.

Floyd was a suspect in the deaths of Kansas City brothers Wally and Boll Ash, who were rum-runners found dead in a burning car on March 25, 1931. Members of his gang killed Patrolman R. H. Castner of Bowling Green, Ohio, on April 23. On July 22, Floyd killed federal agent Curtis C. Burke in Kansas City, Missouri.

Former sheriff Erv Kelley of McIntosh County, Oklahoma, was shot by Floyd while trying to arrest him on April 7, 1932. In November, three members of Floyd&#x27;s gang attempted to rob the Farmers and Merchants Bank in Boley, Oklahoma. 

Despite his life of crime, Floyd was viewed positively by the general public. When he robbed banks, he allegedly destroyed mortgage documents, but this has never been confirmed and may be myth. One of four elements of the &quot;outlaw-hero&quot; American folktype is that the person &quot;steals from the rich and gives to the poor&quot;; Floyd is one example of a historical person who has become an outlaw-hero with this element in folklore. Floyd was often protected by locals of Oklahoma who referred to him as &quot;Robin Hood of the Cookson Hills&quot;.

==Kansas City massacre==

Floyd and Adam Richetti became the primary suspects in a gunfight known as the &quot;Kansas City massacre&quot; on June 17, 1933, which resulted in the deaths of four law enforcement officers. J. Edgar Hoover leveraged the incident to seek more authority to pursue Floyd, although historians are divided as to whether Floyd was involved. The gunfight was an attack by Vernon Miller and accomplices on lawmen escorting robber Frank &quot;Jelly&quot; Nash to a car parked at the Union Station in Kansas City, Missouri. Kansas City detectives William Grooms and Frank Hermanson, Oklahoma police chief Otto Reed, and special agent Ray Caffrey were killed. Nash was also killed while sitting in the car, shot in the head by his would-be rescuers. Two other Kansas City police officers survived by slumping forward in the back seat and feigning death. As the gunmen inspected the car, another officer responded from the station and fired at them, forcing them to flee. Miller was found dead on November 27, 1933, outside Detroit, Michigan, having been beaten and strangled.

Floyd and Richetti were allegedly Miller&#x27;s accomplices. Evidence against them included their presence in Kansas City at the time, eyewitness identifications (although these have been contested), Richetti&#x27;s fingerprint recovered from a beer bottle at Miller&#x27;s hideout, an underworld account naming Floyd and Richetti as the gunmen, and Hoover&#x27;s firm advocacy of their guilt. Fellow bank robber Alvin Karpis claimed that Floyd confessed involvement. However the bandit alleged to have been Floyd was reported to have been wounded by a gunshot to the shoulder in the attack, and Floyd&#x27;s body showed no sign of this injury when examined later. The underworld account identifying Floyd and Richetti as the killers was offset by equally unreliable underworld accounts proclaiming their innocence. The Floyd family has maintained that Floyd admitted to many other crimes, but vehemently denied involvement in this one, as did Richetti.

Kansas City police received a postcard dated June 30, 1933, from Springfield, Missouri, that read: &quot;Dear Sirs - I - Charles Floyd - want it made known that I did not participate in the massacre of officers at Kansas City. Charles Floyd&quot;. The police department believed the note to be genuine. Floyd also reportedly denied involvement in the massacre to the agents who had fatally wounded him. In addition, a 2002 book on the massacre attributes at least some of the killing to friendly fire by a lawman who was unfamiliar with his weapon, based on ballistic tests.

==Death==
J. Edgar Hoover, director of the BOI, named Floyd &quot;Public Enemy No. 1&quot; following the death of John Dillinger. Local police and F.B.I. agents led by Melvin Purvis under the direct supervision of Inspector Samuel P. Cowley shot Floyd on October 22, 1934, in a corn field in East Liverpool, Ohio. Accounts differ on who shot him and the manner in which he was killed. 

Floyd and Richetti had left Buffalo, New York, on October 18, and their vehicle slid into a telephone pole in heavy fog at 3 am the following morning. No one was injured, but the car was disabled, so they sent two female companions to get a tow truck. They planned to have the women accompany the tow truck driver into town and have the vehicle repaired while they waited by the roadside.

After dawn on October 19, motorist Joe Fryman and his son-in-law David O&#x27;Hanlon passed by, observing two men dressed in suits lying by the roadside. They thought it suspicious and informed Wellsville, Ohio, police chief John H. Fultz. Fultz investigated with officers Grover Potts and William Erwin. Richetti saw the lawmen and fled into the woods, pursued by two officers, while Fultz went towards Floyd. Floyd immediately drew his gun and fired. During the ensuing gunfight, Fultz was wounded in the foot and Potts was wounded in the right shoulder. Floyd fled into the forest. After enlisting the help of another local police officer, Chester C. Smith (February 14, 1895 – October 23, 1984), who had served as a sniper during World War I, the group of lawmen resumed the pursuit and successfully apprehended Richetti, but Floyd remained on the run. News of the search quickly spread. Local police in the surrounding areas were mobilized, and a team of BOI agents was quickly dispatched.

On October 22, Floyd was able to hitch a ride to East Liverpool, Ohio, where he obtained food at a pool hall owned by his friend Charles Joy. Differing accounts of the events that followed were given by responding BOI agents, local law enforcement officers, and nearby civilians. All agree that Floyd was confronted by a group of lawmen soon after leaving the pool hall, and attempted to flee on foot. Soon after he was shot and wounded by pursuing officers, who then arrested Floyd and formally placed him in federal custody. Accounts differ about which officers fired at Floyd, how many times they fired, and in what sequence. 

According Special Agent Winfred E. Hopton, BOI agents alone participated in the final confrontation with Floyd, and local law enforcement arrived later. BOI accounts state that four of their agents: Hopton, Samuel K. McKee Jr., and David E. Hall, led by Purvis, and four members of the East Liverpool Police Department: Herman H. Roth, Jr., Chester C. Smith, and Glenn G. Montgomery, led by Chief Hugh J. McDermott, were searching the area south of Clarkson, Ohio, in two cars. They saw a car move from behind a corn crib and then move back. Floyd then emerged from the car and drew a .45 caliber pistol, and the BOI agents opened fire. Floyd reportedly said, &quot;I&#x27;m done for. You&#x27;ve hit me twice.&quot; 

Contradicting this, a news report from the time states that Floyd crawled out of the corn crib toward the Dyke automobile, then changed direction toward a wooded ridge. Purvis yelled &quot;Halt!&quot; but Floyd ran. Purvis called out &quot;Fire!&quot; and Floyd was mortally wounded by four bullets. Handcuffs were placed on his wrists. Floyd asked, “Who the hell tipped you?” Floyd refused to answer Purvis&#x27;s questions about the Kansas City Massacre, but did say, &quot;I am Floyd…where is Eddie?&quot; referring to Adam Richetti. Thinking he had been shot twice, he remarked, &quot;You got me twice.&quot; Purvis did not disclose Floyd&#x27;s last words. Allegedly four days before, Floyd and two accomplices had robbed a bank of $500. Floyd’s share of his last bank robbery was $120. Among Floyd&#x27;s effects found on him was a watch and a fob. Each had ten notches, allegedly for ten persons Floyd had killed.

Retired East Liverpool police captain Chester Smith described events differently in a 1979 issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. He was credited with shooting Floyd first, and he stated that he had deliberately wounded Floyd but not killed him. &quot;I knew Purvis couldn&#x27;t hit him, so I dropped him with two shots from my .32 Winchester rifle.&quot; According to Smith&#x27;s account, Floyd fell and did not regain his footing, and Smith then disarmed him. At that point, Purvis ran up and ordered, &quot;Back away from that man. I want to talk to him.&quot; Purvis questioned Floyd briefly and received curses in reply, so he ordered agent Herman Hollis to &quot;fire into him.&quot; Hollis then shot Floyd at point-blank range with a sub-machine gun, killing him. The interviewer asked if there was a cover-up by the FBI, and Smith responded: &quot;Sure was, because they didn&#x27;t want it to get out that he&#x27;d been killed that way.&quot;

FBI agent Winfred E. Hopton disputed Smith&#x27;s claim in a letter to the editors of &quot;Time&quot;, published in the November 19, 1979, issue. He stated that he was one of four BOI agents present when Floyd was killed on a farm several miles from East Liverpool. According to Hopton, members of the East Liverpool police department arrived only after Floyd was already mortally wounded. He also claimed that, when the four agents confronted Floyd, he turned to fire on them, and two of the four killed him almost instantly. Smith&#x27;s account said that Herman Hollis shot the wounded Floyd on Purvis&#x27;s order, but Hopton claimed that Hollis was not even present. At least one other source discredits Smith&#x27;s version, stating that although Smith&#x27;s story received wide currency, Hollis was not at the orchard that afternoon. Hollis&#x27; FBI profile does not mention his participation in this incident. Hopton also stated that Floyd&#x27;s body was transported back to East Liverpool in Hopton&#x27;s own car. In an October 29 memo, Hoover instructed his assistant, Edward Allan Tamm, to send Floyd&#x27;s personal effects to Floyd&#x27;s mother after photographing Floyd&#x27;s watch to record the ten notches carved into it which Hoover speculated were for men Floyd had killed.

Floyd&#x27;s body was embalmed and briefly viewed at the Sturgis Funeral Home in East Liverpool, Ohio, before being sent on to Oklahoma. His body was placed on public display in Sallisaw, Oklahoma. His funeral was attended by between 20,000 and 40,000 people and remains the largest funeral in Oklahoma history. He was buried in Akins, Oklahoma.

==Popular portrayals==


Woody Guthrie wrote a protest song romanticizing Floyd&#x27;s life in 1939 called &quot;Pretty Boy Floyd&quot; which recounted Floyd&#x27;s supposed generosity to the poor. It compared foreclosing bankers to outlaws, calling both actions robbery. Guthrie&#x27;s song has been subsequently covered by many recording artists.
Dick Tracy&#x27;s adversary Flattop Jones was based on Pretty Boy Floyd. Flattop claims to be a freelancer from the &quot;Crookston Hills&quot;, a parody of Cookson Hills in Oklahoma, and the comic strip refers to Flattop&#x27;s involvement in the Kansas City Massacre.

Several films have been made about Floyd:
* John Ericson portrayed him in &quot;Pretty Boy Floyd&quot; (1960), directed by Herbert J. Leder
* Fabian Forte portrayed him in &quot;A Bullet for Pretty Boy&quot; (1970)
* Steve Kanaly portrayed him in the Film &quot;Dillinger&quot; (1973)
* Martin Sheen portrayed him in the TV movie &quot;The Story of Pretty Boy Floyd&quot; (1974)
* Bo Hopkins portrayed him in the TV movie &quot;The Kansas City Massacre&quot; (1975)
* Andrew Robinson portrayed him in the film &quot;The Verne Miller Story&quot; (1987) starring Scott Glenn as Vernon Miller
* Channing Tatum portrayed him in &quot;Public Enemies&quot; (2009) starring Christian Bale and Johnny Depp, in which he is falsely depicted as being killed before John Dillinger

==Floyd in literature==
&quot;Pretty Boy&quot;, by William Cunnigham, originally published by Vanguard in 1936, was republished by Mongrel Empire Press, Norman, Oklahoma, in 2014. There is an informative introduction by James Murray. This novel is a combination of fiction and propaganda, but much of it is consistent with historical data. The propaganda is interwoven as an essential plot element, namely, the legend of Robin Hood. And it is consistent with other depictions of Pretty Boy Floyd in contemporary works, namely, John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1939), and Woody Guthrie&#x27;s ballad, &quot;Pretty Boy Floyd&quot; (1939).

&quot;Pretty Boy Floyd&quot; (1995) is a fictionalized account of Floyd&#x27;s life by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana.

In John Steinbeck&#x27;s 1939 novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, the character Ma Joad refers several times to Pretty Boy Floyd as a young man driven to a tragic fate by social injustice and the Great Depression:

Floyd is (along with Baby Face Nelson and Machine Gun Kelly) one of the main characters of the comic book series &quot;Pretty, Baby, Machine&quot;.

<text>The J. Reuben Clark Law School (BYU Law or JRCLS) is the law school of Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. Founded in 1973, the school is named after J. Reuben Clark, a former U.S. Ambassador, Undersecretary of State, and general authority of the institution&#x27;s sponsoring organization, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

BYU Law is fully accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA), and a member of the Association of American Law Schools.

==History==
On March 9, 1971, the BYU Board of Trustees announced that a law school would be established at the Just two-and-one-half years later the opening ceremonies were held on Classes were initially held several blocks south in an old Catholic school building (St. Francis of Assisi, affectionately referred to as &quot;St. Reuben&#x27;s&quot; by the students.

The law school&#x27;s inaugural dean was American lawyer Rex Lee, who later served as U.S. Solicitor General during the administration of President Ronald Reagan. The JRCLS Building was completed and dedicated in 1975, and the law school graduated its first class in 1976. The law school has since graduated more than 5,000 students.

==Campus==

The nearly BYU Law building is located on the east side of the BYU campus and backdropped by Y Mountain. The building&#x27;s five floors contain eleven classrooms, three seminar rooms, a student commons area, a student lunchroom, spaces for student organizations and activities, a large computer lab, and a computer training room.

The Howard W. Hunter Law Library occupies the north wing of the law building and houses a collection of over 450,000 volumes and volume equivalents in paper and microform. The library provides students with 470 individually assigned study carrels, 17 group study rooms, a reading room for quiet study, and a popular reading and conversation room. The library also has two classrooms where library faculty teach legal research and writing classes, familiarizing students with specific types of legal research and with library holdings. In 2014, the &quot;National Jurist&quot; ranked the Howard W. Hunter Law Library as the 25th best law library in the country.

The campus is located within the original jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Utah and the appellate jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit).

== Academics ==

===Admissions===
Many admitted students have graduate and/or doctoral degrees in a wide range of academic disciplines, and most have spent time abroad. Entering students graduated from over 70 different undergraduate colleges and universities in 11 countries and nearly 40 US states.

In 2009, the incoming class had a median GPA of 3.73 and a median LSAT score of 165. Based on these numbers, BYU Law ranks 19th in the nation for GPA and 25th in the nation for LSAT admissions standards.

Admission to the BYU Law School is open to people of any faith or sexual orientation, subject to the school&#x27;s Honor Code. Among other things, the Honor Code precludes the admission and retention of students who are former members of the LDS Church, or whose actions are categorized as &quot;homosexual behavior&quot;, which includes both sexual relations and &quot;all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings&quot;. To verify Honor Code compliance, students are required to obtain, and maintain during their course of study, an ecclesiastical endorsement from a religious leader or designated BYU chaplain. In 2016, the ABA, which accredits the school, conducted a review to determine whether BYU Law School&#x27;s admission and retention policy was in accordance with its nondiscrimination policy. The ABA ended the review later in 2016 after BYU modified the Honor Code to make it easier for students to obtain an exemption to the ecclesiastical endorsement requirement.

===Degree programs===
====Juris Doctor (JD) program====
Most of the students at BYU Law are enrolled in the Juris Doctor (JD) program. JD students are required to take 90 semester hours of credit in order to graduate. In the first year of law school all students are required to take one semester each of Civil Procedure, Contracts, Criminal Law, Property, Torts, Introduction to Legal Research and Writing, Introduction to Advocacy, Legislation and Regulation, and Structures of the Constitution. Additionally, each student must take Professional Responsibility during their second or third year and prepare a substantial paper (at least 30 pgs). Students must also fulfill a Professional Skills Requirement by completing six hours of externship credit or Professional Skills Courses. In addition to their substantive coursework, many second and third-year students participate in moot court, a scholarly publication, a clinic, or an externship.

====Joint Degree programs====
For students interested in a more general interdisciplinary course of study, BYU Law offers five joint degree programs (usually completed in four years, as opposed to three for a standard JD):
:JD-MAcc, with the School of Accountancy within the Marriott School of Business
:JD-MBA, with the Marriott School of Business
:JD-MEd, with the David O. McKay School of Education
:JD-MPA, with the Romney Institute of Public Service and Ethics within the Marriott School of Business

For foreign lawyers seeking a master&#x27;s degree in Comparative American law, BYU Law offers a two semester Master of Laws (LLM) program. Applicants must have a law degree or certification from an institution located outside the U.S. to participate in the program.

===Academic offerings===
The student-to-faculty ratio at BYU Law is about 18 to one. The current faculty includes numerous former U.S. Supreme Court and U.S. Circuit Court judicial law clerks. The school hosts several events each year, including the World Family Policy Center / United Nations Conference (July), the International Law and Religion Symposium (October), and the Orrin G. Hatch Distinguished Trial Lawyer Lecture Series (November).

Students at BYU Law publish four law journals: the BYU Law Review, the BYU Journal of Public Law, the BYU Education and Law Journal, and the BYU International Law &amp; Management Review.

==Rankings==
The &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Best Law Schools&quot; ranked BYU Law tied for 28th in the country overall (2024).

&quot;The National Jurist&quot; named BYU Law 1st in &quot;Best Value Law Schools&quot; (2022, 2021, 2016). In 2020, &quot;The National Jurist&quot; reported data from the U.S. Department of Education reflecting that BYU Law had the lowest median federal student debt ($51,250) of any law school in the country.

<text>Sutton Lenore Foster (born March 18, 1975) is an American actress. She is known for her work on the Broadway stage, for which she has won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical twice, in 2002 for her role as Millie Dillmount in &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot;, and in 2011 for her performance as Reno Sweeney in &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, a role which she reprised in 2021 for a production in London and for which she received a nomination for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical.

She left Troy High School before graduating (she received her diploma via correspondence courses) to join the national tour of &quot;The Will Rogers Follies&quot; directed by Tommy Tune. She then attended Carnegie Mellon University for one year, but left to pursue a theatrical career full-time. In May 2012, she received an honorary doctorate from Ball State University, &quot;in recognition of her outstanding career in theater, television and music and for her contributions to the educational experience and professional growth of Ball State students.&quot; 
In May 2019, she also received an honorary doctorate from Boston Conservatory at Berklee, which introduced a merit scholarship in her name to be awarded to one student every four years. Her older brother, Hunter Foster, is also an actor.

==Career==
===1995–2001: Early career===
After touring in the role of Sandy Dumbrowski in the musical &quot;Grease&quot; throughout 1995, Foster transferred to the Broadway production in 1996. She left to appear in the ensemble of the Broadway musical &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; in 1997, and after that closed she returned as the Star to Be in the revival of &quot;Annie&quot;.

She then understudied the same role on Broadway in 2000.

Foster left &quot;Les Misérables&quot; to join the ensemble of &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; in its pre-Broadway run at the La Jolla Playhouse. Original leading lady Kristin Chenoweth landed a television series shortly after rehearsals began and was replaced with Erin Dilly as Millie and Foster as her understudy. After apparent clashes between the creative team, a &quot;mutual&quot; decision was made for Dilly to leave the production. With only nine days remaining before the first preview, Foster took over the role of Millie Dilmount. During a hiatus (before &quot;Millie&quot; was set to open on Broadway), Foster appeared in &quot;Dorian&quot; at Goodspeed Musicals, &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; at the American Musical Theatre of San Jose, and &quot;South Pacific&quot; at the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera.

===2002–2010: Breakthrough and stage success===
&quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; finally opened on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre in 2002, to positive reviews. &quot;The New York Daily News&quot; reviewer said: &quot;newcomer Sutton Foster, who has the pert look, the silver voice and the dazzling legwork to make an extraordinarily winning Millie.&quot; Clive Barnes, reviewing for the &quot;New York Post&quot; wrote &quot;Newcomer Sutton Foster&#x27;s own star turn as Millie is perfectly charming, but as a star she doesn&#x27;t twinkle, glitter or light up Broadway like a Christmas tree defying a July noon. But she has a good voice and is cutely agreeable.&quot; The &quot;Newsday&quot; reviewer wrote: &quot;She has a smile that may remind you of Mary Tyler Moore, the gawky comic precision of the young Carol Burnett, the lyricism of a romantic heroine and a smallish but vibrant voice as accurate as it is expressive. As [Millie], another of New York&#x27;s prototypical small-town girls with big-city dreams, [Sutton Foster] appears unfazed by the burden of a character created onscreen by Julie Andrews. The newcomer takes the big stage with an uninhibited what-the-heck comfort level and the discipline to go with her instincts.&quot; &quot;Time Magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;she&#x27;s [Sutton Foster] got the full package: girlish gawkiness and Broadway brass, the legs and the lungs. Foster is a big reason the show is just about the cutest thing to hit Broadway since Annie&#x27;s dimples, with perkily retro songs by Jeanine Tesori and clever staging by director Michael Mayer...&quot; Foster went on to win the 2002 Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical, the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical, and the Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical for her performance. During the run, Foster appeared in concert versions of &quot;Chess&quot; and &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, before leaving in 2004.

Upon leaving, Foster did a concert version of &quot;Snoopy! The Musical&quot; and returned to the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera for a production of &quot;Me and My Girl&quot; to wrap up the year. In May 2005, Foster co-starred as Jo March opposite Maureen McGovern as Marmee in the musical adaptation of Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s classic novel &quot;Little Women&quot;, for which she was nominated for her second Tony Award. The production closed after just a few months. She returned to Broadway at the Marquis Theatre in May 2006 in &quot;The Drowsy Chaperone&quot;, a spoof of 1920s musicals. She played Janet van de Graaff, a famous Broadway starlet who opts to forgo a stage career in favor of married life. The musical had a pre-Broadway run at the Ahmanson Theatre, Los Angeles in November to December 2005. Her performance earned her a third Tony nomination. Foster left the musical in 2007 and co-starred in Mel Brooks&#x27; musical adaptation of his film &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; as the Swedish yodeling fräulein Inga, first at the Paramount Theatre and then on Broadway from October 2007 to July 2008.

In 2007, Foster guest-starred on the children&#x27;s musical puppet show &quot;Johnny and the Sprites&quot; and in a three-episode story arc on the HBO sitcom &quot;Flight of the Conchords&quot;. She left the show to play Princess Fiona in &quot;Shrek the Musical&quot;, which opened on Broadway on December 14, 2008. For this role, Foster won her second Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical and was nominated for her fourth Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical. She played her final performance on January 3, 2010, when the show closed on Broadway. Foster participated in a reading of a work-in-progress new musical, &quot;Bonnie and Clyde: A Folktale&quot;, in June 2009. Her brother, Hunter is writing the music for this musical.

Foster&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Wish&quot; was released by Ghostlight Records in February 2009. The songs range from jazz to pop to cabaret to Broadway. In 2010, Foster promoted the album with concert performances in Boston, New York City, Chicago, the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Orange County, California, and Washington, D.C. Foster starred as Nurse Fay Apple in the New York City Center&#x27;s Encores! production of &quot;Anyone Can Whistle&quot;, which played from April 8 to 11, 2010. Foster made her Off-Broadway debut in Paul Weitz&#x27;s comedy &quot;Trust&quot; with Zach Braff, Bobby Cannavale and Ari Graynor which began previews July 23, 2010, with an official opening August 12, running through September 12, 2010, at Second Stage Theatre. Foster and Seth Rudetsky participated in the one night only Actors Fund benefit concert version of &quot;They&#x27;re Playing Our Song&quot; on August 30, 2010, at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater, John Jay College, New York. The full cast included Efé, Kaitlyn Davidson, Alex Ellis, Maynard, Matt Loehr, and Jesse Nager, and was directed by Denis Jones.

Foster taught a Spring Semester master class at New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts Undergraduate Department of Drama, beginning in January 2010. It culminated in a cabaret performance at Joe&#x27;s Pub in May titled &quot;From Rodgers To Heart&quot;. She taught the master class again in Fall Semester 2010, culminating in another performance at Joe&#x27;s Pub, &quot;Crazy for Gershwin&quot;. Both were musically directed by Deborah Abramson. She is now on the faculty of NYU&#x27;s New Studio on Broadway. Foster taught a week-long master class session at Ball State University (Muncie, IN) in January 2010.

She also guest-starred in an episode of the NBC legal drama &quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU&quot; (opposite comedian Kathy Griffin), which aired on March 3, 2010.

Foster performed at the 33rd Annual Kennedy Center Honors in a tribute to Jerry Herman, singing &quot;Before the Parade Passes By.&quot; She performed at the Kennedy Center Honors the following year in a tribute to Barbara Cook. She made a third appearance at the Kennedy Center Honors in 2013, performing for the tribute to Shirley MacLaine. Foster performed a concert tour, &quot;An Evening With Sutton Foster&quot; from September 2010 to May 2011, performing songs from both her Broadway career and her solo album.

===2011–2014: &quot;Anything Goes&quot; and branching out===
Foster played Reno Sweeney in the Broadway revival of &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, which began performances on March 10, 2011, at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre and officially opened on April 7, 2011.

Foster&#x27;s final performance was on March 11, 2012, when she was replaced by Stephanie J. Block. Foster left to film the television comedy-drama &quot;Bunheads&quot;, which premiered on ABC Family on June 11, 2012. Foster played the lead role in this short-lived 2012 ABC Family drama, developed by Amy Sherman-Palladino, the creator of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;.

===2015–present: &quot;Younger&quot;, London debut, and Broadway return===
She made her Carnegie Hall debut in April 2015, with guest appearances from Joshua Henry and Megan McGinnis. This was part of a new tour effort &quot;An Evening With Sutton Foster: Broadway In Concert&quot;, which continued through 2016.

<text>The Eswatini national football team, nicknamed &quot;Sihlangu Semnikati&quot; (King&#x27;s Shield), represents Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, in international football and is controlled by the Eswatini Football Association. It has never qualified for the World Cup or the Africa Cup of Nations finals. Swaziland&#x27;s best performance in an international tournament is a semi-final finish in the COSAFA Cup.

On 8 June 2008, they achieved their first win in a World Cup qualifier since 1992, beating 2006 finalists Togo 2–1 on home soil. The team&#x27;s best recent performance came in 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification where Eswatini finished second in Group L above Guinea and Malawi.

==History==

===Beginnings===

The team played its first international match against Malawi, winning 2–0. For the first decade, the national team only played Malawi and Zambia, failing to register a single win from 1969 until 1984, when they beat Lesotho 3–1 in a friendly at home. Following the Lesotho win, Eswatini entered the 1986 African Cup of Nations qualifiers for the first time, losing 1–8 on aggregate to Zimbabwe. The team then entered the 1987 All-Africa Games qualifiers however they lost 2–9 on aggregate against Malawi. 

The first time that Eswatini progressed past the first round of a qualifying competition was for the 1990 African Cup of Nations qualifiers, beating Tanzania 3–1 on penalties after drawing the tie 2–2. In the second round they faced Malawi who knocked them out again, 1–3 after two legs. Eswatini next entered the 1990 SADCC Tournament, advancing past the group stage on goal difference ahead of Malawi, before losing to Zimbabwe on penalties (5–3) in the semi-finals following a 4–4 draw after extra-time. In the 1992 African Cup of Nations qualifiers, Eswatini beat Zambia (2–1) during the preliminary group stage but finished in third and failed to progress. 

Eswatini entered the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifiers for the first time, but ended up in second place behind Cameroon thereby not advancing to the final round. For the 1998 World Cup first qualification round, Eswatini lost twice to Gabon (0–1 and 0–2) and were eliminated. They failed to make it past the first qualifying round for the inaugural 1997 COSAFA Cup, where they lost 0–4 to Mozambique, and in the 1998 COSAFA Cup where they lost to an own-goal in extra-time against Angola (0–1). Eswatini returned to the 2000 African Cup of Nations qualification matches after missing the previous three tournaments but they fell 2–3 against Madagascar and were eliminated. They managed to qualify for the 1999 COSAFA Cup after beating Mozambique 3–1 in the qualifiers, then beat Zimbabwe in the quarter-finals 4–3 on penalties after drawing 1–1 in regular time, with Bongani Mdluli having scored the equaliser for Eswatini in the 89th minute. In the semi-finals they lost to Namibia on penalties, 2–4.

===21st century===

Eswatini were eliminated by Angola in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, losing 1–8 on aggregate. They then lost to Kenya in the 2002 African Cup of Nations qualification round 3–5. Their next success in a competition came in the 2002 COSAFA Cup where they qualified ahead of Namibia (2–1) and beat Zimbabwe (2–0) to advance to the semis. There they lost to South Africa (1–4) who would go on to win the tournament. In the 2004 AFCON qualifiers, Eswatini finished third in their group, two points behind Libya and three behind DR Congo therefore missing out on qualification.

In the following tournaments, Eswatini failed to progress past the first qualifying round. They finished bottom of their qualifying groups until 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification where they finished in second on goal-difference ahead of Guinea but were three points off of qualifying, behind Zimbabwe. In the 2018 World Cup qualifying, Eswatini thrashed Djibouti 8–1 over two legs, but were beaten 0–2 by Nigeria to end their hopes of qualification.

<text>VME eXtensions for instrumentation bus (VXI bus) refers to standards for automated test based upon VMEbus. 
VXI defines additional bus lines for timing and triggering as well as mechanical requirements and standard protocols for configuration, message-based communication, multi-chassis extension, and other features. In 2004, the 2eVME extension was added to the VXI bus specification, giving it a maximum data rate of 160 MB/s.

The basic building block of a VXI system is the mainframe or chassis. This contains up to 13 slots into which various modules (instruments) can be added. The mainframe also contains all the power supply requirements for the rack and the instruments it contains. Instruments in the form of VXI Modules then fit the slots in the rack. VXI bus modules are typically 6U in height (see Eurocard) and C-size (unlike VME bus modules which are more commonly B-size). It is therefore possible to configure a system to meet a particular requirement by selecting the required instruments.

The basic architecture of the instrument system is described in US patent 4,707,834. This patent was freely licensed by Tektronix to the VXIbus Consortium. The VXIbus grew from the VME bus specification, it was established in 1987 by Hewlett Packard (now Keysight Technologies), Racal Instruments (now Astronics Test Systems), Colorado Data Systems, Wavetek and Tektronix. VXI is promoted by the VXIbus Consortium, whose sponsor members are currently (in alphabetical order) Astronics Test Systems (formerly Racal Instruments), Bustec, Keysight Technologies, National Instruments, Teradyne, and VTI Instruments (formerly known as VXI Technology)
ZTEC Instruments] is a participating Executive Member. VXI&#x27;s core market is in Military and Avionics Automatic Test Systems. 

The VXI&quot;plug&amp;play&quot; Alliance specified additional hardware and software interoperability standards, such as the Virtual Instrument Software Architecture (VISA), although the alliance was eventually merged with the IVI Foundation. Application software that supports VXI&quot;plug&amp;play&quot; instrument drivers for controlling instruments include LabVIEW and MATLAB.

<doc id="1212523" wikidata="Q1428393" url="?curid=1212523" title="Rotaract">
<text>Rotaract originally began as a Rotary International youth program in 1968 at Charlotte North Rotary Club in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States, and has grown into a major organization of ~9,000 clubs and nearly 120,000 members in 189 countries and geographic areas. It is a service, leadership, professional, and community service organization (often miscommunicated as a Social Service Club) for young adults aged 18 and over.

Rotaract focuses on young adults&#x27; development as leaders in their communities and workplaces. Clubs also take part in international service projects, in a global effort to bring peace and international understanding to the world.

&quot;Rotaract&quot; stands for &quot;Rotary in Action&quot;, although the name originally comes from a combination of &quot;Rotary&quot; and &quot;Interact&quot; (International + Action), the high-school level program Rotary International created in 1962.

Most Rotaract activities take place at the club level. Rotaract clubs hold formal meetings in person or virtually, usually every two weeks, that feature speakers, special outings, social activities, discussions or visits to other clubs. Club members get together on designated days for service project work, social events, or professional/leadership development workshops.

To be eligible for membership, you must be 18 years of age and show that you are committed to Rotaract and of good standing in your community. After being approved by the club, members are inducted into Rotaract.

Avenues of service include Club Service, Community Service, International Service and Professional Development.

In 2019, Rotaract went from being a program of Rotary International to being a membership type of Rotary International, elevating its status to resemble that of Rotary clubs. As of 1 July 2020, Rotaract clubs can exist on their own or be sponsored by Rotary and/or Rotaract clubs. This makes them true &quot;partners in service&quot; and key members of the Rotary family. A Rotaract club may, but is not required to, establish upper age limits if its members so desire and record it in the club&#x27;s bylaws. 

==Multidistrict communication and MDIOs==

Rotaract multidistrict information organizations (MDIOs) function as regional resource centers for Rotaractors. They comprise Rotaract clubs in two or more districts either within a country or across several countries. 

Rotaract MDIOs are directly involved in preparing Rotaractors for leadership and are excellent coordinators for communicating program updates, local and international news, and event bulletins. They also facilitate uniting members from different clubs and districts within a particular region.

<doc id="1212524" wikidata="Q1469646" url="?curid=1212524" title="Bloom syndrome">
<text>Bloom syndrome (often abbreviated as BS in literature) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by short stature, predisposition to the development of cancer, and genomic instability. BS is caused by mutations in the &quot;BLM&quot; gene which is a member of the RecQ DNA helicase family. Mutations in genes encoding other members of this family, namely &quot;WRN&quot; and &quot;RECQL4&quot;, are associated with the clinical entities Werner syndrome and Rothmund–Thomson syndrome, respectively. More broadly, Bloom syndrome is a member of a class of clinical entities that are characterized by chromosomal instability, genomic instability, or both, and cancer predisposition.

Cells from a person with Bloom syndrome exhibit a striking genomic instability that includes excessive crossovers between homologous chromosomes and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs). New York dermatologist Dr. David Bloom discovered and first described the condition in 1954.

Bloom syndrome has also appeared in the older literature as Bloom–Torre–Machacek syndrome.

==Presentation==
The most prominent feature of Bloom syndrome is proportional small size. The small size is apparent in utero. At birth, neonates exhibit rostral to caudal lengths, head circumferences, and birth weights that are typically below the third percentile.

The second most commonly noted feature is a rash on the face that develops early in life due to sun exposure. The facial rash appears most prominently on the cheeks, nose, and around the lips. It is described as erythematous, which is red and inflamed, and telangiectatic, which is characterized by dilated blood vessels at the skin&#x27;s surface. The rash commonly also affects the backs of the hands and neck, and it can develop on any other sun-exposed areas of the skin. The rash is variably expressed, being present in a majority but not all persons with Bloom syndrome, and it is on average less severe in females than in males. Moreover, the sun sensitivity can resolve in adulthood. There are other dermatologic changes, including hypo-pigmented and hyper-pigmented areas, cafe-au-lait spots, and telangiectasias, which can appear on the face and on the ocular surface.

There is a characteristic facial appearance that includes a long, narrow face; prominent nose, cheeks, and ears; and micrognathism or undersized jaw. The voice is high-pitched and squeaky.

There are a variety of other features that are commonly associated with Bloom syndrome. There is a moderate immune deficiency, characterized by deficiency in certain immunoglobulin classes and a generalized proliferative defect of B and T cells. The immune deficiency is thought to be the cause of recurrent pneumonia and middle ear infections in persons with the syndrome. Infants can exhibit frequent gastrointestinal upsets, with reflux, vomiting, and diarrhea, and there is a remarkable lack in interest in food. There are endocrine disturbances, particularly abnormalities of carbohydrate metabolism, insulin resistance and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and compensated hypothyroidism. Persons with Bloom syndrome exhibit a paucity of subcutaneous fat. There is reduced fertility, characterized by a failure in males to produce sperm (azoospermia) and premature cessation of menses (premature menopause) in females. Despite these reductions, several women with Bloom syndrome have had children, and there is a single report of a male with Bloom syndrome bearing children.

Although some persons with Bloom syndrome can struggle in school with subjects that require abstract thought, there is no evidence that intellectual disability is more common in Bloom syndrome than in other people.

The most serious and frequent complication of Bloom syndrome is cancer. In the 281 persons followed by the Bloom Syndrome Registry, 145 persons (51.6%) have been diagnosed with a malignant neoplasm, and there have been 227 malignancies. The types of cancer and the anatomic sites at which they develop resemble the cancers that affect persons in the general population. The age of diagnosis for these cancers is earlier than for the same cancer in normal persons, and many persons with Bloom syndrome have been diagnosed with multiple cancers. The average life span is approximately 27 years. The most common cause of death in Bloom syndrome is cancer. Other complications of the disorder include chronic obstructive lung disease and type 2 diabetes.

There are a variety of excellent sources for more detailed clinical information about Bloom syndrome.

There is a closely related entity that is now referred to as Bloom-syndrome-like disorder (BSLD) which is caused by mutations in components of the same protein complex to which the &quot;BLM&quot; gene product belongs, including &quot;TOP3A&quot;, which encodes the type I topoisomerase, topoisomerase 3 alpha, &quot;RMI1&quot;, and &quot;RMI2&quot;. The features of BSLD include small size and dermatologic findings, such as cafe-au-lait spots, and the presence of the once pathognomonic elevated SCEs is reported for persons with mutations in &quot;TOP3A&quot; and &quot;RMI1&quot;.

Bloom syndrome shares some features with Fanconi anemia possibly because there is overlap in the function of the proteins mutated in this related disorder.

== Genetics ==

Bloom syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder, caused by mutations in the maternally- and paternally-derived copies of the gene &quot;BLM&quot;. As in other autosomal recessive conditions, the parents of an individual with Bloom syndrome do not necessarily exhibit any features of the syndrome. The mutations in BLM associated with Bloom syndrome are nulls and catalytically inactive missense mutations. The cells from persons with Bloom syndrome exhibit a striking genomic instability that is characterized by hyper-recombination and hyper-mutation. Human BLM cells are sensitive to DNA damaging agents such as UV and methyl methanesulfonate, indicating deficient repair capability. At the level of the chromosomes, the rate of sister chromatid exchange in Bloom&#x27;s syndrome is approximately 10-fold higher than normal, and quadriradial figures, which are the cytologic manifestations of crossing-over between homologous chromosomes, are highly elevated. Other chromosome manifestations include chromatid breaks and gaps, telomere associations, and fragmented chromosomes. The hyper-recombination can also be detected by molecular assays The &quot;BLM&quot; gene encodes a member of the protein family referred to as RecQ helicases. The diffusion of BLM has been measured to 1.34 formula_1 in nucleoplasm and 0.13 formula_2 at nucleoli DNA helicases are enzymes that attach to DNA and temporarily unravel the double helix of the DNA molecule. DNA helicases function in DNA replication and DNA repair. BLM very likely functions in DNA replication, as cells from persons with Bloom syndrome exhibit multiple defects in DNA replication, and they are sensitive to agents that obstruct DNA replication.

The BLM helicase is a member of a protein complex with topoisomerase III alpha, RMI1, and RMI2, also known as BTRR, Bloom Syndrome complex, or the dissolvasome. Disruption of the proper assembly of the Bloom Syndrome complex leads to genome stability, genetic dependence on cellular nucleases GEN1 and MUS81, and loss of normal cell growth. Bloom-like phenotypes have been associated with mutations in topoisomerase III alpha, RMI1 and RMI2 genes.

===Relationship to cancer and aging===
As noted above, there is a greatly elevated rate of mutation in Bloom syndrome and the genomic instability is associated with a high risk of cancer in affected individuals. The cancer predisposition is characterized by 1) broad spectrum, including leukemias, lymphomas, and carcinomas, 2) early age of onset relative to the same cancer in the general population, and 3) multiplicity, that is, synchronous or metachronous cancers. There was at least one person with Bloom syndrome who had five independent primary cancers. Persons with Bloom syndrome may develop cancer at any age. The average age of cancer diagnoses in the cohort is approximately 26 years old.

==Pathophysiology==
When a cell prepares to divide to form two cells, the chromosomes are duplicated so that each new cell will get a complete set of chromosomes. The duplication process is called DNA replication. Errors made during DNA replication can lead to mutations. The BLM protein is important in maintaining the stability of the DNA during the replication process. Lack of BLM protein or protein activity leads to an increase in mutations; however, the molecular mechanism(s) by which BLM maintains the stability of the chromosomes is still a very active area of research.

Persons with Bloom syndrome have an enormous increase in exchange events between homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids (the two DNA molecules that are produced by the DNA replication process), and there are increases in chromosome breakage and rearrangements compared to persons who do not have Bloom&#x27;s syndrome. Direct connections between the molecular processes in which BLM operates and the chromosomes themselves are under investigation. The relationships between molecular defects in Bloom syndrome cells, the chromosome mutations that accumulate in somatic cells (the cells of the body), and the many clinical features seen in Bloom syndrome are also areas of intense research.
==Diagnosis==

Bloom syndrome is diagnosed using any of three tests - the presence of quadriradial (Qr, a four-armed chromatid interchange) in cultured blood lymphocytes, and/or the elevated levels of sister chromatid exchange in cells of any type, and/or the mutation in the BLM gene. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced on February 19, 2015, that they have authorized the marketing of a direct-to-consumer genetic test from 23andMe. The test is designed to identify healthy individuals who carry a gene that could cause Bloom Syndrome in their offspring.

==Treatment==
Bloom syndrome has no specific treatment; however, avoiding sun exposure and using sunscreens can help prevent some of the cutaneous changes associated with photo-sensitivity. Efforts to minimize exposure to other known environmental mutagens are also advisable in multiple forms.

== Epidemiology ==
Bloom syndrome is extremely rare in most populations and the frequency of the disease has not been measured in most populations. However, the disorder is relatively more common amongst people of Central and Eastern European Ashkenazi Jewish background. Approximately 1 in 48,000 Ashkenazi Jews are affected by Bloom syndrome, who account for about one-third of affected individuals worldwide.

=== Bloom&#x27;s Syndrome Registry ===
The Bloom&#x27;s Syndrome Registry lists 283 individuals reported to have this rare disorder (as of 2020), collected from the time it was first recognized in 1954. The registry was developed as a surveillance mechanism to observe the effects of cancer in the patients, which has shown 122 individuals have been diagnosed with cancer. It also acts as a report to show current findings and data on all aspects of the disorder.

<text>Faun Fables is an American band based in Oakland, California. Faun Fables is a concept and vehicle for Dawn McCarthy, who was inspired to write the original material while traveling after leaving the New York City music scene in 1997. Faun Fables also covers 20th century compositions by other songwriters and traditional folk songs. The music on the first album is entirely by McCarthy, as are all lyrics and most of the music on &quot;Mother Twilight&quot;. All albums except for the first are collaborations with Nils Frykdahl, inspired by McCarthy&#x27;s previous work and &quot;Dawn the Faun&quot; stage persona.

==Collaborations==
Main collaborator Nils Frykdahl is known for his work with Sleepytime Gorilla Museum and Idiot Flesh. 
Faun Fables albums and shows also feature collaborations with:
* Family members - sister Sheila Bosco (Autobody; Drumhead; Flaming Fire; zBug), brother Brian McCarthy, and mother Michelina Tyrie;
* Matt Waldron of &#x27;irr. app. (ext.)&#x27;
* Robin Coomer of &#x27;Loop!Station&#x27;
* Kirana Peyton of Blackbird Stitches;
* Isabel Douglass of Rupa &amp; the April Fishes;
* Noe Venable;
* Will Oldham;
* Dan Rathbun of Sleepytime Gorilla Museum (bass guitar)

==Performance==
McCarthy&#x27;s performances draw on many influences, including British, Scandinavian, Appalachian and Eastern European music. Her shows often contain elements of theater—dance and puppet shows are common elements. She has covered songs of Ewa Demarczyk and Brigitte Fontaine, and her music has been compared to neo-psych-folk artists such as Devendra Banhart and Current 93. 

===The Transit Rider===
This is an ambitious performance and multimedia documentation of a song cycle entitled &quot;The Transit Rider&quot;.

<text>The Heaton Park Tramway is a heritage tramway that operates within Heaton Park, a large municipal park in the English city of Manchester. It is operated by the Manchester Transport Museum Society, a registered charity.

In normal times, the tramway operates on Sunday afternoons between March and mid-November and on Saturday afternoons between May and mid-September. Operation may be suspended whilst major events are being held in the park, and was temporarily suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic although the tramway has now reopened.

== History ==
Heaton Park was originally the private landscape park surrounding Heaton Hall, but was sold to Manchester City Council in 1902 for use as a municipal park. Shortly after the park was bought by the council, a branch of Manchester Corporation Tramways was built into the park from the existing tramway on Middleton Road. A large waiting shelter was constructed at the end of this branch, and the first tram arrived on 31 May 1903. By 1934 buses were taking over from trams and the stub tramway into the park was disconnected from the main system and covered in tarmac for use by buses.

The Manchester Transport Museum Society (MTMS) was founded as a registered charity in the early 1960s, with the aim of the preservation of documents and artifacts relating to public transport in the Manchester region. An early project of the society was the restoration of Manchester Corporation Tramways 765, with aspirations to operate the car in Manchester, and identified Heaton Park as a possible site.

In the 1970s the society approached the city council with this idea. The initial plan, to construct a tramway from Grand Lodge to Heaton Hall, was considered too expensive, as it would require remedial works to carry it across the railway tunnel. A new scheme was proposed to open up the old Manchester Corporation Tramways spur from Middleton Road to the old tram shelter. The original track was buried under a layer of tarmac which was cleared and the tram shelter restored and modified to form a depot and museum. Work was completed in 1979 and the Heaton Park Tramway was officially opened on 28 March 1980.

Since 1980, the museum tramway has been extended further into the park on three occasions, using track salvaged from elsewhere, and is now 0.52 miles long. The most recent extension was in 2011 and reaches the boathouse and lake. A new tram depot has been constructed at this terminus. Additionally, major restoration of the original depot and museum complex was completed in 2007.

== Tramcars ==
=== Permanent collection ===
The following trams form the permanent collection of the Heaton Park Tramway:

===Former Fleet===
=== Other visitors ===
Trams that have visited the line include:
* Blackpool &amp; Fleetwood No. 40 single-decker built in 1914.
* Blackpool No. 225 Boat open-decker built in 1934.
* Oporto No. 196 single-decker built in 1935.
* Marton Box No. 31 open-topper built in 1901. (The first Double Decker to run at the park since 1925).
* Blackpool No. 706 Balloon open-topper built in 1934.

== Projects ==
Overhauls to Stockport 5 are now complete, Vanguard 619 is now the main focus of priority for the tramway. A funding appeal will soon start for extension of the Lakeside depot in order to provide space for the T68 being preserved to move to the tramway. Future projects include the restoration of Manchester Corporation Tramways open top tram 173 built in 1901, Blackpool Balloon 702, Oldham 43 built in 1902 and the Blackpool railgrinder No. 752. Plans exist for a further extension of the tramway towards Heaton Park Metrolink stop.

<text>The Democratic National Salvation Front (, FDSN) was a Romanian political party formed by former President Ion Iliescu and his supporters stemming from the National Salvation Front (FSN) on 7 April 1992. It was the result of the breakup of the previously ruling FSN during the early 1990s.

The smaller wing led by Petre Roman continued using the brand FSN. Unlike the Petre Roman wing of the FSN, which wanted faster economic reforms, the FDSN advocated for an socialist democracy and a slower pace of transition from the communist command economy to a social market economy. On 10 July 1993, the FDSN merged with the Romanian Socialist Democratic Party (PSDR), the Republican Party, and the Cooperative Party, creating the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR). In 2001, PDSR merged with PSDR to create the present-day Social Democratic Party (PSD).

<doc id="1212545" wikidata="Q2325854" url="?curid=1212545" title="Familial dysautonomia">
<text>Familial dysautonomia (FD), also known as Riley–Day syndrome, is a rare, progressive, recessive genetic disorder of the autonomic nervous system that affects the development and survival of sensory, sympathetic, and some parasympathetic neurons in the autonomic and sensory nervous system.

FD results in variable symptoms, including insensitivity to pain, inability to produce tears, poor growth, and labile blood pressure (episodic hypertension and postural hypotension). People with FD have frequent vomiting crises, pneumonia, problems with speech and movement, difficulty swallowing, and inappropriate perception of heat, pain, and taste, as well as unstable blood pressure and gastrointestinal dysmotility.

Originally reported by Drs. Conrad Milton Riley and Richard Lawrence Day in 1949, FD is one example of a group of disorders known as hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSANs). All HSANs are characterized by widespread sensory dysfunction and variable autonomic dysfunction caused by incomplete development of sensory and autonomic neurons. The disorders are believed to be genetically distinct from each other.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms of familial dysautonomia usually commence during infancy and worsen with age, and may include gastrointestinal dysmotility (including erratic gastric emptying, gastroesophageal reflux, abnormal esophageal peristalsis, oropharyngeal incoordination), dysphagia (as poor suckling in infancy) and frequent choking/gagging, recurrent vomiting, poor weight gain/growth, delayed development (especially walking) and puberty (especially in girls), recurrent aspiration pneumonia (due to inhalation of food or vomitus) with possible secondary chronic lung disease, absence of overflow tears during crying, corneal ulcers, red skin blotches and excessive sweating (often during eating or excitement), breath-holding spells, slurred speech/nasal voice, tongue ulcers (from accidental self-injuries), hyporeflexia (variable absence of deep tendon reflexes), hypotonia, enuresis, arrhythmias, hypertension (including episodic hypertension in response to emotional stress or visceral pain), hypotension (including orthostatic hypertension with compensatory tachycardia (invariably present)), impaired (but not absent) temperature and pain perception (leading to frequent accidental injury), impaired proprioception, a smooth glossy tongue, scoliosis (with possibly secondary restrictive lung disease), abnormal gait, short stature, chronic renal failure (common), visual impairment, variable cognitive ability, characteristic facial features that develop with time, impaired vibration perception, lack of fungiform papilla of the tongue, and impaired taste perception (especially for sweetness).
* Autonomic crises – In children with FD, recurrent episodes of vomiting may occur. Such episodes may be triggered by physical (e.g. infection) or emotional stress, may occur every 15–20 minutes for over 24 hours, and may be accompanied by significant hypertension, drenching sweat, breathing issues, fever, tachycardia, aspiration pneumonia, skin blotches, drooling, and negative personality change.
* Pain insensitivity – Insensitivity or indifference to painful stimuli may lead to frequent/progressive self-mutilation, burns, and ulcers. There may be self-mutilation of the tongue (especially in toddlers during teething), lips, and cheeks, or loss of teeth. Compulsive oral biting may result in ulcers or tumour-like masses (Riga–Fede disease).

=== Progression ===
Familial dysautonomia presents with progressive, age-specific symptoms.

Though usually not diagnosed until several years of age, generalised signs of FD are present during the newborn period in more than 80% of those affected. Dysmorphic facial features are not directly inherent to the disorder, but facial asymmetry and a straightened mouth eventually develop due to abnormal tone and molding of facial bones.

==== Perinatal ====
A very high incidence of breech presentation has been noted among infants with FD. A lower birth weight as compared to siblings, premature birth, and intrauterine growth restriction have also been noted.

==== Neonatal ====
During the neonatal period, hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency, poor feeding with difficulty swallowing and aspiration, developmental delay, short stature, scoliosis, and corneal disease may occur.

==== Infancy ====
Issues related to the disorder first appear during infancy. Early manifestations include hypotonia, feeding difficulty (impaired swallowing and suckling), poor growth, absence of tears, frequent lung infections, and poor body-temperature control (infants may display cold hands and feet). Developmental milestones (e.g. walking, speech) may or may not be delayed.

In infants with FD, a lack of overflow tears during emotional crying may be noted after the age of 7 months (until this age, overflow emotional tearing may also not occur in unaffected infants; overflow tearing is absent in neonates and begins to appear only after 2–3 months of age).

Affected infants&#x27; hands may alternatively appear cool and mottled (from vasoconstriction), or red and swollen (from vasodilation). Red skin blotching is often precipitated by emotional excitement.

In older infants and young children, breath-holding spells may occur, possibly leading to cyanosis or fainting. Breath-holding behaviour usually ceases by age 6.

==== Children ====

In school-age children, bed wetting, vomiting episodes, impaired pain, and temperature perception, impaired blood pressure control (including orthostatic hypotension, hypertension during periods of psychological excitement or vomiting), learning disabilities (e.g. short attention span; learning disabilities are present in about a third of those with FD, and may require special education), scoliosis, poor bone quality and bone fractures, and kidney and heart issues may be seen.

==== Adolescence and adulthood ====
Issues that tend to commence during adolescence or early adulthood include lung damage due to multiple respiratory infections, impaired kidney function, and impaired vision (due to atrophy of the optic nerve). By adulthood, difficulties with balance and unaided walking often arise.

==Cause==

Familial dysautonomia is the result of mutations in the &quot;IKBKAP&quot; gene on chromosome 9, which encodes for the IKAP protein (IkB kinase complex-associated protein). Three mutations in IKBKAP have been identified in individuals with FD. The most common FD-causing mutation occurs in intron 20 of the donor gene. Conversion of T→C in intron 20 of the donor gene resulted in shift splicing that generates an IKAP transcript lacking exon 20. Translation of this mRNA results in a truncated protein lacking all of the amino acids encoded by exons 20–37. Another less common mutation is a G→C conversion resulting in a one-amino-acid mutation in 696, where proline substitutes for normal arginine. The decreased amount of functional IKAP protein in cells causes familial dysautonomia.

==Diagnosis==

===Clinical diagnosis===
A clinical diagnosis of FD is supported by a constellation of criteria:
* No fungiform papillae on the tongue
* Decreased deep-tendon reflexes
* Lack of an axon flare following intradermal histamine
* No overflow tears with emotional crying

===Genetic testing===
Genetic testing is performed on a small sample of blood from the tested individual. The DNA is examined with a designed probe specific to the known mutations. The accuracy of the test is above 99%. Dr. Anat Blumenfeld of the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem identified chromosome 9 as the responsible chromosome.

===Prenatal testing===

Familial dysautonomia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. If both parents are shown to be carriers by genetic testing, a 25% chance exists that the child will have FD. For pregnancies at increased risk for FD, preimplantation genetic diagnosis or prenatal diagnosis by amniocentesis (at 15–17 weeks) or chorionic villus sampling (at 10–14 weeks) is possible.

==Management==
No cure for FD has been identified. The only two treatment centers are at New York University Hospital and the Sheba Medical Center in Israel. One is being planned for the San Francisco area. Although the FD-causing gene has been identified and it seems to have tissue-specific expression, no definitive treatment exists at present.

A major issue has been aspiration pneumonia. Fundoplications (by preventing regurgitation) and gastrostomy tubes (to preclude oral nutrition) have reduced the frequency of hospitalization. Other issues that can be treated include FD crises, scoliosis, and various eye conditions due to limited or no tears.

Treatment of FD remains preventative, symptomatic, and supportive. FD does not express itself in a consistent manner. The types and severity of symptoms displayed vary among patients and even at different ages on the same patients, so patients should have specialized individual treatment plans. Medications are used to control vomiting, eye dryness, and abnormal blood pressure. Common management strategies include artificial tears, appropriate feeding strategy (maintenance of adequate nutrition, avoidance of aspiration (thickened formula and differently shaped nipples for infants)), daily chest physiotherapy (nebulization, bronchodilators, and postural drainage) for chronic pulmonary disease, pharmaceutical management of autonomic features (e.g. intravenous or rectal diazepam, or rectal chloral hydrate), preventing accidental injury, prevention of orthostatic hypotension (hydration, leg exercise, frequent small meals, a high-salt diet, and medication (e.g. with fludrocortisone)), treatment of orthopedic problems, compensating labile blood pressure.

Parents and patients should be informed regarding daily eye care and early signs of corneal problems, as well as punctal cautery. Informing patients and caretakers has resulted in decreased corneal scarring and the need for more aggressive surgical measures such as tarsorrhaphy, conjunctival flaps, and corneal transplants.

==Prognosis==

The average age of death is in the third decade of life, but affected persons may live into their 70s. Death occurs in 50% of the affected individuals by age 30. The outlook for patients with FD depends on the particular diagnostic category. Patients with chronic, progressive, generalized dysautonomia in the setting of central nervous system degeneration have a generally poor long-term prognosis. Death can occur from pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, or sudden cardiopulmonary arrest in such patients.

The survival rate and quality of life have increased since the mid-1980s, mostly due to a greater understanding of the most dangerous symptoms. At present, FD patients can be expected to function independently if treatment is begun early and if major disabilities are avoided.

==Epidemiology==
Familial dysautonomia is seen almost exclusively in Ashkenazi Jews and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Both parents must be carriers for a child to be affected. The carrier frequency in Jews of Eastern and Central European (Ashkenazi) ancestry is about one in 30, while the carrier frequency in non-Jews is unknown. If both parents are carriers, a one-in-four chance exists with each pregnancy for an affected child. Genetic counseling and genetic testing are recommended for families who may be carriers of familial dysautonomia.

Worldwide, about 600 diagnoses have been recorded since the discovery of the disease, with around 350 of them still living.

==Research==
In January 2001, researchers at Fordham University and Massachusetts General Hospital simultaneously reported finding the genetic mutation that causes FD, a discovery that opens the door to many diagnostic and treatment possibilities. Genetic screening subsequently became available in 2001, enabling Ashkenazi Jews to find out if they are carriers.

Stem-cell therapy has been proposed as a potential future treatment. Eventually, treatment could be given &quot;in utero&quot;.
Research into treatments is being funded by foundations organized and run by parents of those with FD. No governmental support has been given beyond recognizing those diagnosed with FD as eligible for certain programs.

<text>Choroid plexus cysts (CPCs) are cysts that occur within choroid plexus of the brain. They are the most common type of intraventricular cyst, occurring in 1% of all pregnancies.

It is believed that many adults have one or more tiny CPCs. The fetal brain may create these cysts as a normal part of development. They are temporary and usually are gone by the 32nd week of pregnancy.

CPCs are a rare cause of intermittent hydrocephalus. This is caused by a blockage of foramina within the ventricular drainage system of the central nervous system (CNS), which can lead to expansion of the ventricles, compressing the brain (the cranial cavity cannot expand to accommodate the increase in fluid volume) and possibly causing damage.

==Pathology==
The brain contains pockets or spaces called ventricles with a spongy layer of cells and blood vessels called the choroid plexus. This is in the middle of the fetal brain. The choroid plexus has the important function of producing cerebrospinal fluid. The fluid produced by the cells of the choroid plexus fills the ventricles and then flows around the brain and the spinal cord to provide a cushion of fluid around these structures.

CPCs can form within this structure and come from fluid trapped within this spongy layer of cells, much like a soap bubble or a blister. CPCs are often called &quot;soft signs&quot; or fetal ultrasound &quot;markers&quot; because some studies have found a weak association between CPCs and fetal chromosome abnormalities.

Choroid plexus cysts are usually asymptomatic and disappears by 26 to 28 weeks of pregnancy. However, large cysts can cause hydrocephalus.

==Genetic causes==
There is a possible association between ultrasound-detected fetal CPCs and Trisomy 18. It is not correlated to the presence of Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). Therefore, genetic counseling is often recommended to provide more information about fetal CPCs, to answer questions and concerns, and to outline available options such as amniocentesis or a blood test from the mother.

Generally the risks are very low if there are no other risk factors. If no additional abnormalities are detected by a thorough &quot;level II&quot; ultrasound, the likelihood the fetus has trisomy 18 is very low.

A meta-analysis of 8 studies between 1990 and 2000 with choroid plexus cysts that were identified in second-trimester (an incidence of 1.2%). The incidence of the cysts in women younger than 35 was 1% (n=1017). The study found no cases of trisomy 18 in fetuses with cysts whose mother was younger than 35. The study concluded that &quot;there is no evidence that detection of isolated choroid plexus cyst in women who are &lt;35 years of age increases the risk of trisomy 18&quot;.

Other factors which may have a bearing on the baby&#x27;s chances of developing chromosome problems include:
* mother&#x27;s age at the expected date of delivery
* the results of serum screening; XAFP triple testing or quad screening
* evidence of other &quot;fetal findings&quot; seen at the time of the ultrasound that may suggest a chromosome problem

<doc id="1212575" wikidata="Q33739" url="?curid=1212575" title="Pahari-Pothwari">
<text>Pahari Pothwari is an Indo-Aryan language variety of the Lahnda group, spoken in the northern half of Pothohar Plateau, in Punjab, Pakistan, as well as in the most of Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir and in the western areas of Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir. It is known by a variety of names, the most common of which are Pahari (; an ambiguous name also applied to other unrelated languages of India), and Pothwari (or Pothohari).

The language is transitional between Hindko and standard Punjabi and is mutually intelligible with both. There have been efforts at cultivation as a literary language, although a local standard has not been established yet. The Shahmukhi script is used to write the language, such as in the works of Punjabi poet Mian Muhammad Bakhsh.

Grierson in his early 20th-century Linguistic Survey of India assigned it to a so-called &quot;northern cluster&quot; of Lahnda (Western Punjabi), but this classification, as well as the validity of the Lahnda grouping in this case, have been called into question. In a sense all Lahnda varieties, and standard Punjabi are &quot;dialects&quot; of a &quot;greater Punjabi&quot; macrolanguage.

== Geographic distribution and dialects ==

There are at least three major dialects: Pothwari, Mirpuri and Pahari.

The dialects are mutually intelligible, but the difference between the northernmost and the southernmost dialects (from Muzaffarabad and Mirpur respectively) is enough to cause difficulties in understanding.

===Pothohar Plateau===
Pothwari (), also spelt &quot;Potwari&quot;, &quot;Potohari&quot; and &quot;Pothohari&quot; (), is spoken in the north-eastern portion of Pothohar Plateau of northern Punjab, an area administratively within Rawalpindi division. Pothwari is its most common name, and some call it &quot;Pindiwal Punjabi&quot; to differentiate it from the Punjabi spoken elsewhere in Punjab.

Pothwari extends southwards up to the Salt Range, with the city of Jhelum marking the border with Majha dialect. To the north, Pothwari transitions into the Pahari-speaking area, with Bharakao, near Islamabad, generally regarded as the point where Pothwari ends and Pahari begins. In Attock and Talagang districts of Pothohar, it comes in contact with other Lahnda varieties, namely Chacchi, Awankari and Ghebi. In Chakwal, yet another dialect is spoken, Dhani.

Pothwari has been represented as a dialect of Punjabi by the Punjabi language movement, and in census reports the Pothwari areas of Punjab have been shown as Punjabi-majority.

===Mirpur===
East of the Pothwari areas, across the Jhelum River into Mirpur District in Azad Kashmir, the language is more similar to Pothwari than to the Pahari spoken in the rest of Azad Kashmir.
Locally it is known by a variety of names: &quot;Pahari&quot;, &quot;Mirpur Pahari&quot;, &quot;Mirpuri&quot;, and &quot;Pothwari&quot;, while some of its speakers call it &quot;Punjabi&quot;.
Mirpuris possess a strong sense of Kashmiri identity that overrides linguistic identification with closely related groups outside Azad Kashmir, such as the Pothwari Punjabis.
The Mirpur region has been the source of the greater part of Pakistani immigration to the UK, a process that started when thousands were displaced by the construction of the Mangla Dam in the 1960s and emigrated to fill labour shortages in England.
The British Mirpuri diaspora now numbers several hundred thousand, and Pahari has been argued to be the second most common mother tongue in the UK, yet the language is little known in the wider society there and its status has remained surrounded by confusion.

===Kashmir, Murree and the Galyat===
Pahari () is spoken to the north of Pothwari. The central cluster of Pahari dialects is found around Murree. This area is in the Galyat: the hill country of Murree Tehsil in the northeast of Rawalpindi District (just north of the capital Islamabad) and the adjoining areas in southeastern Abbottabad District. One name occasionally found in the literature for this language is Dhundi-Kairali (&quot;Ḍhūṇḍī-Kaiṛālī&quot;), a term first used by Grierson who based it on the names of the two major tribes of the area – the Kairal and the Dhund. Its speakers call it &quot;Pahari&quot; in Murree tehsil, while in Abbottabad district it is known as either &quot;Hindko&quot; or &quot;Ḍhūṇḍī&quot;.
Nevertheless, Hindko – properly the language of the rest of Abbottabad District and the neighbouring areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa – is generally regarded as a different language. It forms a dialect continuum with Pahari, and the transition between the two is in northern Azad Kashmir and in the Galyat region. For example, on the road from Murree northwest towards the city of Abbottabad, Pahari gradually changes into Hindko between Ayubia and Nathiagali.

A closely related dialect is spoken across the Jhelum River in Azad Kashmir, north of the Mirpuri areas. Names associated in the literature with this dialect are &quot;Pahari&quot; (itself the term most commonly used by the speakers themselves), Chibhālī, named after the Chibhal region or the Chibh ethnic group, and Pahari (Poonchi) (, also spelt &quot;Punchhi&quot;). The latter name has been variously applied to either the Chibhali variety specific to the district of Poonch, or to the dialect of the whole northern half of Azad Kashmir. 
This dialect (or dialects) has been seen either as a separate dialect from the one in Murree, or as belonging to the same central group of Pahari dialects. The dialect of the district of Bagh, for example, has more shared vocabulary with the core dialects from Murree (86–88%) than with the varieties of either Muzaffarabad (84%) or Mirpur (78%).

In Muzaffarabad the dialect shows lexical similarity of 83–88% with the central group of Pahari dialects, which is high enough for the authors of the sociolinguistic survey to classify it is a central dialect itself, but low enough to warrant noting its borderline status. The speakers however tend to call their language &quot;Hindko&quot; and to identify more with the Hindko spoken to the west, despite the lower lexical similarity (73–79%) with the core Hindko dialects of Abbottabad and Mansehra. Further north into the Neelam Valley the dialect, now known locally as &quot;Parmi&quot;, becomes closer to Hindko.

Pahari is also spoken further east across the Line of Control into the Pir Panjal mountains in Indian Jammu and Kashmir. The population, estimated at 1 million, is found in the region between the Jhelum and Chenab rivers: most significantly in the districts of Poonch and Rajouri, to a lesser extent in neighbouring Baramulla and Kupwara, and also – as a result of the influx of refugees during the Partition of 1947 – scattered throughout the rest of Jammu and Kashmir. Pahari is among the regional languages listed in the sixth schedule of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. This Pahari is sometimes conflated with the Western Pahari languages spoken in the mountainous region in the south-east of Indian Jammu and Kashmir. These languages, which include Bhadarwahi and its neighbours, are often called &quot;Pahari&quot;, although not same they are closely related to Pahari–Pothwari.

===Diaspora===
Pahari Pothwari is also very widely spoken in the United Kingdom. Labour shortages after World War II, and the displacement of peoples caused by the construction of the Mangla Dam, facilitated extensive migration of Pahari-Pothwari speakers to the UK during the 1950s and 1960s, especially from the Mirpur District. Academics estimate that between two thirds and 80% of people officially classified as British Pakistanis originate as part of this diaspora, with some suggesting that it is the second most spoken language of the United Kingdom, ahead of even Welsh, with hundreds of thousands of speakers. However, since there is little awareness of the identity of the language among speakers, census results do not reflect this. The highest proportions of Pahari-Pothwari speakers are found in urban centres, especially the West Midlands conurbation and the West Yorkshire Built-up Area.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===

A long diphthong /ɑi/ can be realized as .

=== Consonants ===


* Sounds are heard from Persian and Arabic loanwords.
* is realized as voiced in word-initial position.
* before a velar consonant can be heard as .

== Morphology ==

=== Nouns ===

==== Case table ====
Extended masculine forms can be realised as being added the oblique forms ending in -e, which is shortened to &quot;-i-&quot; (phonetically [e̯]) before back vowels and is lost before front vowels.

Notes:

* Extended nouns generally end in -ā for masculine and -ī for feminine in the direct singular form

==== Oblique form ====
The numbers in their oblique form function the same throughout Punjabi dialects.
===== Oblique case of nouns =====
Pahari-Pothwari has unique forms for nouns in oblique cases. This is not observed in standard Punjabi, but is seen in Hindko.
==== Vocative case ====
These cases remain the same between Pothohari and other dialects.

As example of the vocative case:

Pronominal suffixes

Pothohari makes use of the general Punjabi suffixes.

Examples:
=== Pronouns ===

==== Full pronoun tables: ====

=== Verbs ===

==== Adding &quot;i&quot; to root form of verb ====
A peculiar feature of Pahari-Pothwari is to end the basic root form of verbs with an &quot;i&quot; sound.

==== Future tense ====
The future tense in Pothwari is formed by adding -s as opposed to the Eastern Punjabi &quot;gā.&quot;

This tense is also used in other western Punjabi dialects such as the Jatki dialects, Shahpuri, Jhangochi and Dhanni, as well as in and Hindko and Saraiki.

This type of future tense was also used by classical Punjabi poets. Punjabi poet Bulleh Shah sometimes uses a similar form of future tense in his poetry:

&quot;Shahmukhi: جو کُجھ کرسَیں, سو کُجھ پاسَیں&quot;

&quot;Transliteration: jo kujh karsãĩ, so kujh pāsãĩ&quot;

&quot;Translation: whatsoever you do, is what you shall gain&quot;

==== Continuous tense ====
Similar to other Punjabi varieties, Pothwari uses &quot;peyā&quot; (past tense form of &quot;pēṇā&quot;) to signify the continuous tense.

==== Present Continuous ====
===== Past continuous =====
The past tense in Pothwari resembles that of Eastern Punjabi, however depending on the dialect, there may be slight variations.
The place of &quot;pyā&quot; may sometimes be switched with respect to the verb. This is common in Majhi (e.g: Noor Jehan&#x27;s &quot;&quot;chann māhi teri rāh pyi takkni ãã&quot;) and as well as in Jhangochi, Shahpuri, etc

&quot;tusā̃ báhū̃ changā kamm karne ò pa&#x27;e&quot;, meaning &quot;you (plural/sing. formal) are doing a very good thing&quot;

&quot;mē̃ vī tā̃ éhe gall ākhnā sā̃ peyā&quot;, meaning &quot;I was also saying the same thing&quot;

&quot;mē̃ vī tā̃ ehe gall peyā ākhnā ā̃̀&quot;, meaning &quot;I am also saying the same thing&quot;

=== Post-positions ===
These are typically the same in Pothohari and standard Punjabi, but some differences can be noted.

==== Adverbs and post-positions ====

Note:

* Some Majhi subdialects do use کٹھّیوں for کٹھّیاں
* Standard Punjabi makes use of اُپّر
* In Pahari-Pothohari مسیں means now, while in other dialects مسیں / مساں means &quot;barely/hardly&quot;
* The pronunciation وِشکار is not unique to Pahari-Pothohari alone
* The word and expression ہلا / &quot;Hala&quot; is common throughout Western Punjab, also used in Majhi

==== Genitive marker ====
The genitive marker in Pahari-Pothwari is represented through the use of &quot;nā&quot; (ਨਾ / {{resize|{{Nastaliq|نا}}}}) as opposed to &quot;dā&quot; (ਦਾ / {{resize|{{Nastaliq|دا}}}}) in common Punjabi.
* The phrase: &quot;lokkā̃ dā (ਲੋਕਾਂ ਦਾ / {{resize|{{Nastaliq|لوکاں {{strong|دا}}}}}}), meaning &quot;people&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;of the people&quot; in Pahari-Pothwari, would become &quot;lokkā̃ nā (ਲੋਕਾਂ ਨਾ / {{resize|{{Nastaliq|لوکاں {{strong|نا}}}}}})

It should also be noted that in Pahari-Pothwari, the present form of verb does not end with the standard &quot;dā&quot; sound either, and is replaced with &quot;nā.&quot; This means that &quot;ākhdā&quot; would be &quot;ākhnā&quot; in Pahari-Pothwari meaning &quot;to say&quot; and similarly the word &quot;takkdā&quot; would be &quot;takknā&quot; in Pahari-Pothwari meaning &quot;to look/to watch&quot;.
For example:

* &quot;miki eh nih si cāhinā&quot; ({{Nq|میکی ایہہ نِیہ سی چاہینا}}), meaning &quot;this is not what I wanted&quot;
* &quot;oh kai pyā ākhnā ae?&quot; ({{Nq|اوہ کے پیا آخنا ہے؟}}), meaning &quot;what is he saying?&quot;
* This also affects the common Punjabi passive tense: &quot;is tarhā̃ nih ākhī nā ({{Nq|اِس طرحاں نہیں آخی نا}}), instead of &quot;ākhee dā&quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;that&#x27;s not how it should be said&quot;

==== Dative and definite object marker ====
The dative and definite object marker in Pothwari is &quot;kī&quot; (ਕੀ /کی) as opposed to &quot;nū̃&quot; (ਨੂੰ / نوں) in standard Punjabi.

The phrase: &quot;lokkā̃ nū̃ (ਲੋਕਾਂ ਨੂੰ / لوکاں نوں), meaning &quot;to the people&quot; in standard Punjabi, would become &quot;lokkā̃ kī (ਲੋਕਾਂ ਕੀ / لوکاں کی) in Pothwari.

=== Adjectives ===
=== Tribal groupings ===
Pahari-Pothwari speakers belong to the same tribes found in Punjab. While the names of the tribes remain the same, the Punjabi word for tribe &quot;birādrī/barādarī&quot; ({{resize|{{nq|برادری}}}}) becomes &quot;bilādrī/balādarī&quot; ({{resize|{{nq|بلادری}}}}) in Pahari-Pothwari and several other Punjabi dialects such as Jatki and Shahpuri.

=== Numbering system ===
Pahari-Pothwari follows the numbering traditions of standard Punjabi. A point of departure from eastern Punjabi dialects occurs in the use of trai ({{resize|{{nq|ترَے}}}}) instead of &quot;tinn&quot; ({{resize|{{nq|تِنّ}}}}) for &quot;three&quot;. Other western Punjabi dialects also tend to use &quot;trai&quot; over &quot;tinn&quot;.

Similarly, Pothwari, Majhi and other western Punjabi dialects use &quot;yārā̃&quot;&quot; (یاراں) for &quot;gyarā̃&quot; (گیاراں), &quot;trei&quot;&quot; (ترئی) for &quot;tei&quot; (تئی) &quot;panji&quot; (پنجِی) for &quot;pachchi&quot; (پچّی) and &quot;trih&quot; (ترِیہہ) for &quot;tih&quot; (تِیہہ), for the numbers 11, 23, 25, and 30.

Unlike Jhangochi, Shahpuri and Dhanni, Pothohari does not use &quot;dāh&quot; for 10, and instead uses &quot;das&quot; as in Eastern Punjabi and Urdu/Hindi.
==== Ordinals ====
The ordinal numbers are largely the same. The only difference occurs in the words for &quot;second&quot; and &quot;third&quot;. The former is &quot;dūwā&quot; (دووا) in Pothwari, whilst it is &quot;dūjjā&quot; (دوجا) in Punjabi; the latter is &quot;trēyā&quot; (تریا) in Pothwari whilst it is &quot;tējjā&quot; (تیجا) in Punjabi. Western Punjabi in general tends to follow this trend.

== Vocabulary ==
=== General verbs ===
A majority of the general verbs between Pothohari and most other dialects of Punjabi appear to be the same.

Note:

* Eastern Majhi and Malvai use khichchna for pulling, while western Majhi, Jhangochi, Shahpuri, Pothohari use chhikkna.
* Eastern dialects will use bhann-toṛ and tuṭṭ-bhajj, while western dialects like Pothohari use bhann-troṛ and truṭṭ-bhajj.
* saṭṭna for throwing is used in Western dialects, and chāna for picking (as opposed to s&quot;uṭṭna / chukkna&quot;), though Pothohari may use c&quot;hukkna&quot; as well.
* Pothohari verbs do not seem to involve the -&quot;āvna&quot; or -&quot;āuna&quot; sound. This is similar to certain Majhi sub-dialects.
* labbhna is used for obtaining and receiving as in most dialects of Punjabi, however it is often not used in the active sense. For this Pothohari prefers loṛna. (The passive form of this word &quot;loṛīnda&quot; is commonly used in standard Punjabi)
* The Pothohari word for grabbing and holding is nappṅa (common in Punjabi) and lapaṛna (unique verb)

==== The passives remain the same throughout Punjabi dialects ====
* &quot;bhanṅa&quot; (to break) and &quot;bhajjṅa&quot; (to be broken)
* &quot;bhunṅa&quot; (to roast) and &quot;bhujjṅa&quot; (to be roasted)
* &quot;rinnhṅa&quot; (to cook) and &quot;rijjhṅa&quot; (to be cooked)
* &quot;dolhṅa&quot; (to spill) and &quot;dullhṅa&quot; (to be spilt)
* &quot;lāhṅa&quot; (to take off) and &quot;lehṅa&quot; (to descend/come off)
* &quot;laveṛna&quot; (to besmear) and &quot;livaṛna&quot; (to be besmeared)

==== The irregular past tense remains the same throughout Punjabi dialects ====
Differences in brackets.

* &quot;khādhā&quot;
* &quot;pītā&quot;
* &quot;dittā&quot;
* &quot;kītā&quot;
* &quot;suttā&quot;
* &quot;moeā&quot;
* &quot;seāṅtā&quot; (Jhangochi/Shahpuri/Dhanni: s&quot;eātā&quot;, Majhi: s&quot;eāṅeā&quot;)
* &quot;latthā&quot;
* &quot;ḍhaṭṭhā&quot;
* &quot;baddhā&quot;
* &quot;nahātā&quot;
* &quot;dhotā&quot;
* &quot;khaltā&quot; (in other dialects: &quot;khalotā&quot;) e.g.: &quot;miki saṛke apar khalteon addhā ghantā hoi gya sā&quot;
* &quot;baṅtā&quot; (in other dialects: &quot;baṅeā&quot;) e.g.: &quot;chāʼ kadū̃ ni banti hoi ae&quot;
* &quot;guddhā&quot;

==== &quot;nā&quot; and &quot;khā̃&quot; (emphatics) ====
Used throughout Punjabi dialects (e.g.: Majhi, Jhangochi, etc.)

* &quot;gall suṅeṉ na&quot; &quot;please listen&quot;
* &quot;gall suṅ khā̃&quot; &quot;listen up!&quot;

Word for sleep
=== Family relations ===
The names of family relations are mostly the same throughout the Punjabi dialects.

Some words unique to Pothohari include:

* dād-potrā to refer to a cousin (son of father&#x27;s brother, &quot;potrā&quot; is a common Punjabi word)
* be for mother (eastern Punjabi uses &quot;be-be&quot; for mother)
* bhāpā for brother (sometimes used in eastern Majhi)

=== Body part names ===
Names of body parts are the same throughout Punjabi dialects with minimal differences.
=== Words for &quot;coming&quot; and &quot;going&quot; ===
The Pahari-Pothwari word for &quot;coming&quot; is acchṇā, whereas for &quot;going&quot; gacchṇā, julṇā and jāṇā are used.

The imperative for gacchṇā is both &quot;gacch&quot; and &quot;gau&quot;.

=== Causative verbs ===
Pahari-Pothwari causative verbs end with -ālnā. This feature also exists in the eastern Majhi dialect. (e.g.: &quot;vikhālṇā&quot;)
Not all causative verbs are formed like this, e.g. to play -&quot;kheṛṇā&quot; to &quot;khaṛāṇa,&quot;

=== Words used for &quot;taking&quot; and &quot;bringing&quot; ===
Commonly observed in the Lahnda dialects is the use of &quot;ghinṇā&quot; ({{Nq|گھِننا}}) and &quot;ānṇā&quot; ({{Nq|آننا}}) instead of the eastern Punjabi words &quot;laiṇā&quot; ({{Nq|لَینا}}) and &quot;lyāṇā&quot; ({{Nq|لیانا}}).

Notice how &quot;ghin āo&quot; becomes ghini achho, and &quot;ghin ghidā&quot; becomes ghini ghidā in accordance with Pothwari grammar and vocabulary.

<text>Edin Osmić (born 22 December 1978), better known by his stage name Edo Maajka, is a Bosnian rapper, record producer and songwriter. His popularity brought his group Disciplinska Komisija to the mainstream. He lives in Zagreb, Croatia, with his wife and children.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Edin Osmić was born to Bosniak parents Azemina and Fehim, and raised in Brčko (at the time SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia) where he finished elementary school. In 1992, when the Bosnian War started, he left Bosnia and Herzegovina and went to Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, where he began attending high mechanical engineering school. After the war, he returned to Bosnia to study criminal law in Tuzla, but never graduated.

He took an interest in hip-hop when he was in high school and began to do rap battling at the age of fifteen. He also recorded a few demo tracks, creating his own instrumentals by beatboxing. He went to Tuzla and became a member of the hardcore rap group Diskord, later named Odbrana (Defence in Bosnian). The group became one of the best in the city of Tuzla and all of Bosnia. Their demo single &quot;Odbrana &#x27;99&quot; (Defence &#x27;99) was the hit of the year on the &quot;Radio Hit&quot; station in Brčko.

After a year of studying, he left school due to financial problems and returned to Zagreb to meet a friend (from the group Elemental) and recorded his first single &quot;Minimalni rizik&quot; (Minimum Risk) and, a month later, &quot;Mahir i Alma&quot;. The songs were top hits on the Zagreb &quot;Radio 101&quot; station&#x27;s show &quot;Blackout&quot; and the response was enthusiastic. The demo, &quot;Mahir i Alma&quot;, became Kameleon&#x27;s hit of 2001.

===Career===
====Debut album (2001-04)====
Osmić announced his debut album with the single Znaš me. He released his debut album, Slušaj mater, in the spring of 2002 under the Menart and Fmjam label. He released two more singles, Jesmo&#x27;l sami (Are we alone) at the end of 2002 and Prikaze (Spectres) at the beginning in 2003, which officially closed the album. He was featured by other artists, such as in &quot;Teško je ful biti kul&quot; by Hladno Pivo, &quot;Rat&quot; by Pioniri among others.

====Second album (2004-06)====
In April 2004, he released his second album No Sikiriki. On day one, the album sold 5,000 copies. He toured until the end of the year to promote his second album. In 2005, Osmić toured the US and Canada, visiting cities including Toronto, St. Louis, New York, Atlanta and Detroit, first time a Bosnian hip hop star has toured North America.

====Third album (2006-08)====
Recording of songs for the third studio album Stig&#x27;o Ćumur (Coal&#x27;s Arrived) started in August 2005, and the album was released in March 2006. The first single was &quot;To mora da je ljubav&quot; (It Must Be Love) featuring Remi from Elemental), for which he shot the music video in Sarajevo. He started the promotion of his third album at the end of March, the day his album was released.

In January 2007, Osmić &#x27;s single &quot;Bomba&quot; was featured in an episode of the TV series Sleeper Cell. In the summer of 2007, Maajka and his band decided to part, but remained good friends.

====Fourth album (2008-12)====
His fourth album was released on 25 March 2008. The album&#x27;s name was changed from &quot;Sjeti Se&quot; to &quot;Idemo Dalje&quot;. In December 2008 the album received the name Balkansko a naše. At the beginning of June he announced that he created a new band called TRNOKOP and the band premiered at the Rokajfest.

At the end of 2008, &quot;Balkansko a Nase&quot; came at number 36 of the year&#x27;s top albums.

In June 2010, he released his best off album Spomen ploča 2002-2009, but he redid the album with his newly formed band, where they would use band instruments as the music and softer vocals.

Osmić was also featured as a judge and performer in the first Red Bull MC Battle that was held in Sarajevo, Bosnia on 23 April 2010. The next year, he was the host for the Bosnian Red Bull MC Battle 2011.

====Fifth album (2012-18)====
Osmić&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Štrajk mozga&quot;, was released in April 2012. The first single was &quot;Imaš li ti šta para&quot;, followed by the first music video and second single &quot;Panika&quot;, released on 26 December 2011. The third single was &quot;Džigera beat&quot;, followed by the fourth single and second music video &quot;Facebook&quot;, released on 19 November 2012. The director Filip Filkovic Philatz, who directed both music videos, described the video being a sequel to &quot;Panika&quot; because it is set in the same universe, and is second part of the music video trilogy from the &quot;Štrajk Mozga&quot; album.

==Artistry==
===Influences and rapping technique===
Osmić has named several artists that have influenced him, including Rambo Amadeus, TBF, Safet Isović, Miladin Šobić, Azra, Zabranjeno Pušenje, Disciplina Kičme, Atomsko Sklonište, Majke, Rupa u Zidu among others.

His rapping technique is described as having a perfect flow, also his varied subject matter, connecting with his audience, carrying a concept over a series of albums and got most praised for his ability to write brilliant lyrics.

His lyrics have also been described as a variation in connecting emotionally to the viewer. As Anur Hadžiomerspahić says &quot;once you start listening to a Edo Maajka song, when you first start listening it hits you, gives you goosebumps and grabs you by the throat, then the very next verse makes you laugh&quot;.

===Alter ego===
Osmić has an alter ego or pseudonym that he names MC Berbo. He is described as a man who loves drugs, alcohol, fast and expensive cars, women and pop music. Osmić stated that the character of Berbo is the complete opposite of himself and that it is more of a joke than taken seriously.

===Themes and lyrical content===
Osmić started his career with storytelling songs with the demo songs of &quot;Minimalni rizik&quot; (small risk) and the storytelling/love songs &quot;Mahir i Alma&quot;. He is known for his brilliant storytelling ability.

==Personal life==
===Business ventures===
In September 2006, Osmić opened up a cafe bar called &quot;No sikiriki&quot;, named after his second album. Along with beverages, the cafe also serves his favorite food, ćevapi.

Along with the cafe bar, he also plans to publish a weekly magazine which will only focus on positive things that are happening in everyday life and the music scene.

===Legal issues===
Osmić released his first single and music video for his third album, named &quot;To mora da je ljubav&quot;, before his album came out, in which his producer Koolade used the song &quot;Cissy Strut&quot; from 1969 by The Meters. Some media outlets have criticized him for plagiarizing the music in the song. Osmić answered back by saying &quot;Sampling is not stealing. In hip hop you sample music, you take someones beat and rap on that beat. My album was postponed 1 week just because of that reason, while we waited for the authorization to use that song. The fact is that sometimes this waiting for authorization can be as long as one year, we redid the beat a little, gave credit to the author and not on us. You can see that the credit goes to the author on the inside cover of the album. Hip hop is made up of sampling, that is normal. On this particular track, Koolade is not named as the beat maker, but the author is. Remi, who is featured on the song, also gave a comment on the issue, saying that &quot;That is not stealing, we are dealing with sampling of a already made song. You take one part of a song and combine it with your text. People who are not in hip hop don&#x27;t usually know that this is a practice in this type of music.

===Sports Hall Incident===
Osmić held a concert in the Sports Hall (Dom sportova) in 2005. The sponsor for the concert was T-mobile Croatia. Osmić held a press conference before the concert where he criticized his sponsors for the firing of workers after they changed their &quot;brand&quot;. He also explained his decision to work with a telecommunications monopoly by saying that he wanted his ticket for his concert to be 45 kuna or less. He added &quot;you can only do that with a compromise, no one is criticizing Hladno Pivo that they sold out because their sponsor for the tour was Ozujsko beer, whose owners are also foreigners&quot;.

===Concert in Serbia controversy===
Bassivity (music label that released Osmić&#x27;s album in Serbia) promoted Osmić&#x27;s concert, which he was unaware of. When Osmić was asked about this in an interview for Svet magazine, he replied &quot;I don&#x27;t know where this idea that I will promote my album in Belgrade came from? &quot;Bassivity&quot; did that promotion on their own. I don&#x27;t plan to go to Serbia, at least in the coming months. I don&#x27;t want to go to a country that promotes the burning of mosques, and yet thousands of young people are howling on the streets. If I come to Serbia for an album promotion, which I promised to do, I am sure that it will not be for a while.&quot; Svet also tried to bring some of Osmić mistakes from the past to light, in which they stated that he was supposed to have concert with Mile Kitić, but they never revealed the source for that. In the same interview, Svet made some untrue and false accusations against Osmić and his family, saying that his brother and sister &quot;live from black marketing in Northern Bosnia&quot; and that his close family live of pirate sales from his own albums.

===UNICEF&#x27;s Education Action in Bosnia===
Osmić was one of three artists that was featured in UNICEF&#x27;s education program in Bosnia against HIV/AIDS.

===Refusal to air music video===
At the end of November 2005, a month after Osmić premiered his video for the single &quot;Mater Vam Jebem&quot; on MTV Adria, HTV and Nova TV refused to air that video spot based on the name of the song and some theorized because the song&#x27;s lyrics were critical of the countries leaders and the media.

<doc id="1212595" wikidata="Q1431933" url="?curid=1212595" title="Aortoiliac occlusive disease">
<text>In medicine, aortoiliac occlusive disease is a form of central artery disease involving the blockage of the abdominal aorta as it transitions into the common iliac arteries.

==Signs and symptoms==
Classically, it is described in male patients as a triad of the following signs and symptoms:
# claudication of the buttocks and thighs
# absent or decreased femoral pulses
# erectile dysfunction

==Diagnosis==
The physical examination usually shows weakened femoral pulses and a reduced ankle-brachial index. The diagnosis can be verified by color duplex scanning, which reveals either a peak systolic velocity ratio ≥2.5 at the site of stenosis and/or a monophasic waveform. MRA and multidetector CTA are often used to determine the extent and type of obstruction. Another technique is digital subtraction angiography which allows verification of the diagnosis and endovascular treatment in a single session. &lt;br&gt;
Angiography provides important information regarding the perfusion and patency of distal arteries (e.g. femoral artery). The presence of collateral arteries in the pelvic and groin area is important in maintaining crucial blood flow and lower limb viability. However, angiography should only be used if symptoms warrant surgical intervention.

==Treatment==
Treatment involves revascularization typically using either angioplasty or a type of vascular bypass
* Kissing balloon angioplasty +/- stent, so named because the two common iliac stents touch each other in the distal aorta.
* Aorto-iliac bypass graft
* Axillary-bi-femoral and femoral-femoral bypass (sometimes abbreviated &quot;ax-fem fem-fem&quot;)

==History==
The condition was first described by Robert Graham in 1813, but the condition with its triad of symptoms was ascribed to René Leriche. Leriche, a French surgeon, linked the pathophysiology with the anatomy of the condition. John Hunter&#x27;s dissections of atherosclerotic aortic bifurcations from the late 18th century are preserved at the Hunterian Museum, but Leriche was first to publish on the subject based on a patient he treated with the condition at the age of 30. Following treatment the 30-year-old was able to walk without pain and maintain an erection.

<text>The arithmometer () was the first digital mechanical calculator strong and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. This calculator could add and subtract two numbers directly and perform long multiplications and divisions effectively by using a movable accumulator for the result.

Patented in France by Thomas de Colmar in 1820 and manufactured from 1851 to 1915, it became the first commercially successful mechanical calculator. Its sturdy design gave it a strong reputation for reliability and accuracy and made it a key player in the move from to calculating machines that took place during the second half of the 19th century.

Its production debut of 1851 launched the mechanical calculator industry which ultimately built millions of machines well into the 1970s. For forty years, from 1851 to 1890, the arithmometer was the only type of mechanical calculator in commercial production, and it was sold all over the world. During the later part of that period two companies started manufacturing clones of the arithmometer: Burkhardt, from Germany, which started in 1878, and Layton of the UK, which started in 1883. Eventually about twenty European companies built clones of the arithmometer until the beginning of World War I.

==Evolution==

===Searching for a solution: 1820–1851===

The arithmometers of this period were four-operation machines; a multiplicand inscribed on the input sliders could be multiplied by a single-digit multiplier by simply pulling on a ribbon (quickly replaced by a crank handle). It was a complicated design and very few machines were built. Additionally, no machines were built between 1822 and 1844.

This hiatus of 22 years coincides almost exactly with the period of time during which the British government financed the design of Charles Babbage&#x27;s difference engine, which on paper was far more sophisticated than the arithmometer, but wasn’t finished at this time.

In 1844 Thomas reintroduced his machine at the &quot;Exposition des Produits de l&#x27;Industrie Française&quot; in the newly created category of &quot;Miscellaneous measuring tools, counters and calculating machines&quot; but only received an honorable mention.

He restarted the development of the machine in 1848. In 1850, as part of a marketing effort, Thomas built a few machines with exquisite Boulle marquetry boxes that he gave to the crown heads of Europe. He filed two patents and two patents of addition in between 1849 and 1851.

===Creating an ===

The multiplier was removed, making the arithmometer a simple adding machine, but thanks to its moving carriage used as an indexed accumulator, it still allowed for easy multiplication and division under operator control. It was introduced in the UK at The Great Exhibition of 1851 and true industrial production started in 1851.

Each machine was given a serial number and user manuals were printed. At first, Thomas differentiated machines by capacity and therefore gave the same serial number to machines of different capacities. This was corrected in 1863 and each machine was given its own unique serial number starting with a serial number of 500.

The constant use of some of the machines exposed some minor design flaws like a weak carry mechanism, which was given an adequate fix in 1856, and an over rotation of the Leibniz wheels when the crank handle is turned too fast, which was corrected by the addition of a Maltese cross.

A patent covering all these innovations was filed in 1865.
Because of its reliability and accuracy, government offices, banks, observatories and businesses all over the world started using the arithmometer in their day-to-day operations. Around 1872, for the first time in calculating machine history, the total number of machines manufactured passed the 1,000 mark. In 1880, twenty years before the competition, a mechanism to move the carriage automatically was patented and installed on some machines, but was not integrated into the production models.

===The golden age: 1887–1915===

Under the management of Louis Payen, and later his widow, many improvements were introduced, such as an incline mechanism, a removable top, cursors and result windows that were easier to read, and a faster re-zeroing mechanism.

Many clone makers appeared during that period, mostly in Germany and the United Kingdom. Eventually twenty independent companies manufactured clones of the arithmometer. All these companies were based in Europe but sold their machines worldwide.

The fundamental design stayed the same; and after 50 years at the top, the arithmometer lost its supremacy in the mechanical calculator industry. While in 1890, the arithmometer was still the most produced mechanical calculator in the world, ten years later, by 1900, four machines, the comptometer and Burroughs&#x27; adding machine in the USA, Odhner&#x27;s Arithmometer in Russia, and Brunsviga in Germany had passed it in volume of machines manufactured.

Production of the arithmometer stopped in 1915, during World War I.

Alphonse Darras, who had bought the business in 1915, was unable to restart its manufacturing after the war because of the many shortages and a lack of qualified workers.

==Legacy==
Because it was the first mass-marketed and the first widely copied calculator, its design marks the starting point of the mechanical calculator industry. Its user interface was used throughout during the 120 years that the mechanical calculator industry lasted. First with its clones and then with the Odhner arithmometer and its clones, which was a redesign of the arithmometer with a pinwheel system but with exactly the same user interface.

Over the years, the term arithmometer or parts of it have been used on many different machines like Odhner&#x27;s arithmometer, the &quot;Arith&quot;maurel or the Compt&quot;ometer&quot;, and on some portable pocket calculating machines of the 1940s. Burroughs corporation started as the &quot;American Arithmometer Company&quot; in 1886. By the 1920s it had become a generic name for any machine based on its design with about twenty independent companies manufacturing Thomas&#x27; clones like Burkhardt, Layton, Saxonia, Gräber, Peerless, Mercedes-Euklid, XxX, Archimedes, etc.

==History==

===Design===
Thomas started to work on his machine in 1818 while serving in the French Army where he had to do a great deal of calculations. He made use of principles from previous mechanical calculators like the stepped reckoner of Leibniz and Pascal&#x27;s calculator. He patented it on November 18, 1820.

This machine implemented a true multiplication where, by just pulling on a ribbon, the multiplicand entered on the input sliders was multiplied by a one-digit multiplier number and it used the  method for subtracting. Both of these features would be dropped in later designs.

===First machine===
The first machine was built by Devrine, a Parisian clockmaker, and took him a year to build. But, in order to make it work, he had to modify the patented design quite substantially. The Société d’encouragement pour l’industrie nationale was given this machine for review and it issued a very positive report on December 26, 1821. The only known prototype of this time is the on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

===Production===

Manufacturing started in 1851 and ended around 1915. There were about machines built during this sixty-year period; 40% of the production was sold in France and the rest was exported.

The manufacturing was managed by:
* Thomas de Colmar himself until his death in 1870, then by his son Thomas de Bojano until 1881 and by his grandson Mr. de Rancy until 1887. Misters Devrine (1820), Piolaine (1848), Hoart (1850) and Louis Payen (around 1875) were the engineers responsible for building the machines. All the machines manufactured during this time have the logo .

* Louis Payen who bought the business in 1887 until his death in 1902; all these machines have the logo .

* Veuve (widow) L. Payen who took over the business at her husband&#x27;s death and sold it in 1915 with the logos , and &quot;VLP&quot;. Alphonse Darras built most of these machines.

* Alphonse Darras who bought the business in 1915 and manufactured the last machines. He added a logo made of the letters A and D interlaced and went back to the logo.

During the early part of manufacturing, Thomas differentiated machines by capacity and therefore gave the same serial number to machines of different capacities. He corrected this in 1863, giving every machine its own unique serial number starting with a serial number of 500. This is why there isn&#x27;t any machine with a serial number in between 200 and 500.

From 1863 to 1907 the serial numbers were consecutive (from 500 to 4000) then, after patenting a rapid zeroing mechanism in 1907, Veuve L. Payen started a new numbering scheme at 500 (the number of arithmometers she had built with the old scheme) and was at serial number 1700 when she sold the business to Alphonse Darras in 1915. Alphonse Darras went back to the old serial numbers (while adding approximately the number of machines made by Veuve L. Payen) and restarted at 5500.
===Ease of use and speed===
An article published in January 1857 in The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine best describes it:

===Models===

The various models had capacities of 10, 12, 16 and 20 digits which gave results ranging from to . Only two machines were built outside this range:

*The first prototype (the 1822 machine) had a capacity of 6 digits even though the machine described in the 1820 patent is an 8 digits machine.
*The piano arithmometer with a capacity of 30 digits, allowing for numbers up to 1 nonillion , which was built for the 1855 &quot;Exposition universelle de Paris&quot; and which is now part of the IBM collection of mechanical calculators. Jules Verne must have been quite impressed by this machine because in his novel &quot;Paris in the Twentieth Century&quot;, after mentioning Pascal and Thomas de Colmar, he talks of mechanical calculators that will be some huge pianos with keyboards of keys that will deliver answers instantaneously to anyone that can play them!

The last 10-digit arithmometers were built in 1863 with the serial numbers 500–549. After this the smallest machines were 12-digit machines.

All the machines, regardless of capacity, were about 7 inches (18 cm) wide and from 4 up to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) tall (the tallest ones had an incline mechanism). A 20-digit machine was 2 ft 4 in (70 cm) long while the length a 10-digit machine was around 1 ft 6 in (45 cm).

===Prices===
A 12-digit arithmometer sold for 300 francs in 1853, which was 30 times the price of a table of logarithms book and 1,500 times the cost of a first-class stamp (20 French cents), but, unlike a table of logarithms book, it was simple enough to be used for hours by an operator without any special qualifications.

An advertisement taken from a magazine published in 1855 shows that a 10-digit machine sold for 250 francs and a 16-digit machine sold for 500 francs.

===Development costs===
In 1856, Thomas de Colmar estimated that he had spent 300,000 francs of his own money during the thirty years that he perfected his invention.

==Physical design==
The arithmometer is a brass instrument housed in a wooden box often made of oak or mahogany and for the oldest ones ebony (solid or veneer). The instrument itself is divided into two parts.
===Input – control – execution===
The bottom part is composed of a set of sliders that are used to input the value of the operands. On the left of it is a control lever which allows to select the current operation, namely &quot;Addition/Multiplication&quot; or &quot;Subtraction/Division&quot;. A crank located on the right of the sliders is used to execute the operation selected by the control lever.

===Output – accumulator===
The top part is a movable carriage composed of two display registers and two reset buttons. The top display register holds the result of the previous operation and acts as accumulator for the current operation. Each command adds or subtracts the number inscribed on the sliders to the part of the accumulator directly above it. The lower display register counts the number of operations performed at each index therefore it displays the multiplier at the end of a multiplication and the quotient at the end of a division.

Each number in the accumulator can be individually set with a knob situated right below it. This feature is optional for the operation counter register. &lt;br&gt;The accumulator and the result counter are in between two buttons used to reset their content at once. The left button resets the accumulator, the right button resets the operation counter. These buttons are also used as handles when lifting and sliding the carriage.

===Arithmometer&#x27;s Leibniz wheel===
The animation on the side shows a nine-toothed Leibniz wheel coupled to a red counting wheel. The counting wheel is positioned to mesh with three teeth at each rotation and therefore would add or subtract 3 from the counter at each rotation.

The computing engine of an arithmometer has a set of linked Leibniz wheels coupled to a crank handle. Each turn of the crank handle rotates all the Leibniz wheels by one full turn. The input sliders move counting wheels up and down the Leibniz wheels, which are themselves linked by a carry mechanism.

In the arithmometer the Leibniz wheels always turn the same way. The difference in between addition and subtraction is achieved by a reverser operated by the execution lever and located in the movable display carriage.

==Operations==

===Sliding the top carriage===
First lift the carriage using the reset buttons located at its extremities, then slide it. The carriage can only be moved to the right initially. Release it when it is above the index you want (ones, tens, hundreds, ...).

===Resetting the displays===
First lift the carriage using the reset buttons located at its extremities, then turn them to reset the display registers. The left button resets the accumulator, the right button resets the operation counter.

===Addition===
Set the control lever to &quot;Addition/Multiplication&quot; and reset the display registers. Each turn of the execution lever adds the number from the sliders to the accumulator. So input the first number and turn the lever once (it adds it to zero) then enter the second number and turn the lever once more.

===Multiplication===
Set the control lever to &quot;Addition/Multiplication&quot; and reset the display registers. To multiply 921 by 328, first input 921 on the input sliders and then turn the execution lever 8 times. The accumulator shows and the operation counter shows 8. Now, shift the carriage to the right once and turn the lever 2 times, the accumulator shows and the operation counter shows 28. Shift the carriage one last time to the right and turn the lever 3 times, the product appears on the accumulator and the operation counter displays the multiplier 328.

===Subtraction===
Set the control lever to &quot;Subtraction/Division&quot;. Lift the carriage then reset the display registers and input the minuend, right justified, into the accumulator using the corresponding knobs. Lower the carriage to its default position and then set the subtrahend onto the input sliders and turn the execution lever once.

===Integer division===
Set the control lever to &quot;Subtraction/Division&quot; and set the divisor onto the input sliders. While keeping the carriage lifted, reset the display registers, set the dividend, right justified, using the corresponding knobs and shift the carriage so that the highest number in the dividend corresponds to the highest number in the divisor. Lower the carriage then turn the execution lever as many times as required until the number situated above the divisor is less than the divisor, then shift the carriage once to the left and repeat this operation until the carriage is back to its default position and the number in the accumulator is less than the divisor, then the quotient will be in the operations counter and the remainder will be what is left over in the accumulator.

===Decimal division===
In order to increase the decimal division accuracy add as many zeros as required to the right of the dividend but still input it right justified and then proceed as with an integer division. It is important to know where the decimal point is, when you read the quotient (some markers, first ivory and then metal, were usually sold with the machine and used for this purpose).

==Variants==
In 1885, Joseph Edmondson of Halifax, England, patented his &#x27;Circular Calculator&#x27; – essentially a 20-digit arithmometer with a circular carriage (the slides being arranged radially around it) instead of the straight sliding carriage. One benefit of this was that the carriage always remained within the footprint (to use a modern term) of the machine instead of overhanging the case at one side when the higher decimal places were in use. Another was that one could make a calculation of up to ten places, using half the circumference of the carriage, and then turn the carriage through 180°; the result of the calculation was locked in place by means of brass prongs mounted on the framework, and one could leave it there while making an entirely new calculation using the fresh set of display windows now brought into alignment with the sliders. Thus the machine could be said to have a rudimentary memory. See the Rechenmaschinen-Illustrated website (&quot;External links&quot; below) for pictures and a description.

<text>Chevys Fresh Mex is an American chain of Mexican-style casual dining restaurants located in the United States. The chain was founded in 1986 by Warren Simmons in Alameda, California. The chain&#x27;s headquarters are currently located in Cypress, California. The chain is owned by Xperience Restaurant Group. 

==History==

The chain was founded in 1981 by Warren Simmons, with his first restaurant in Alameda, California. It grew to 37 restaurants across California by August 1993, when it was acquired by PepsiCo subsidiary Taco Bell. When PepsiCo exited the restaurant business in 1997, Chevys was sold to the investment group J.W. Childs Associates. In 1999, Chevys purchased Rio Bravo Cantina, a poorly-performing chain of Tex-Mex restaurants with 66 locations across the United States, from Applebee&#x27;s International for $59 million.

Business was poor at the Rio Bravo locations, and in 2003 Chevys&#x27; executives filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. For the next year and a half, Chevys operated as debtor in possession under Chapter Eleven. In January 2005, Chevys and Fuzio Universal Pasta were acquired by Real Mex Restaurants, Inc., the Long Beach, California-based parent company of El Torito Restaurants and Acapulco Mexican Restaurants. The acquisitions gave Real Mex Restaurants claim as the largest operator of full-service Mexican restaurants in the United States. Real Mex subsequently passed through bankruptcy in 2011–2012, and was acquired by Xperience Restaurant Group in 2018.

14 more underperforming Chevys Fresh Mex restaurants, mostly in northern California, were closed on December 26, 2016. Among these were the Redding, Chico, South Lake Tahoe, Modesto, and Fresno locations in California.

In 2021, Xperience Restaurant Group began the expansion of the Chevys Fresh Mex restaurants with a new location in Orlando, FL near the Mall at Millenia and plans to open a flagship location on the Las Vegas strip, near the T-Mobile arena across from Park MGM, that will hold seating for 400 guests.

==Restaurants==

As of April 2024, the company operates 18 locations in California, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, South Dakota, and Virginia. Many of these locations are owned by the company; however, some are franchisee-owned. Franchised Chevys locations, a handful of restaurants in California, and a single unit in Orlando, Florida remain after the October, 2018 bankruptcy and asset sale.

<text>The Miami Circle, also known as The Miami River Circle, Brickell Point, or The Miami Circle at Brickell Point Site, is an archaeological site in Brickell, Miami, Florida. It consists of a perfect circle measuring 38 feet (11.5m) of 600 postmolds that contain 24 holes or basins cut into the limestone bedrock, on a coastal spit of land, surrounded by a large number of other &#x27;minor&#x27; holes. It predates other known permanent settlements on the East Coast. It is believed to have been the location of a structure, built by the Tequesta (also Tekesta) Indians, in what was possibly their capital. Discovered in 1998, the site is believed to be somewhere between 1,700 and 2,000 years old.

On February 5, 2002, the site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was declared a National Historic Landmark on January 16, 2009.

On February 3, 2014, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; reported additional postholes had been excavated in Downtown Miami, further indicating presence of ancient habitation.

The state bought the 2.5-acre site for $26.7 million to save the valuable historical artifact. Because of the fragility of the artifact, it was buried again beneath layers of limestone, rather than putting it on display.

==History==
The site of 401 Brickell Avenue, named after William Brickell, co-founder of Miami in the 1870s, held an apartment complex until 1998. Property developer Michael Baumann purchased the site for $8.5 million to build a luxury condominium, and in July 1998 tore down the standing apartment complex. According to City of Miami historic preservation code requirements, he was obliged to commission a routine archaeological field survey of the site prior to commencement of building, but this didn&#x27;t occur until Bob Carr, then Director of the Miami-Dade County Historic Preservation Division, pressed the issue with the City and Baumann. The Miami-Dade Historic Preservation Division, along with volunteers and employees of the Archaeological &amp; Historical Conservancy, conducted the salvage excavation of the site.

In the course of the exploration, the team discovered a number of holes cut into the Oolitic limestone bedrock. On examining the layout of the holes, the land surveyor postulated that they were part of a circle in diameter. Having calculated the center, he projected the likely location of the remaining holes. Excavation revealed that there were 24 holes forming a perfect circle in the limestone. Examination of the earth revealed numerous archeological artifacts, ranging from shell-tools and stone axe-heads to human teeth and charcoal from fires.

The developer Baumann offered to pay to relocate the circle to another site for preservation, an idea that former mayor and current City Commissioner Joe Carollo supported. Public opposition grew, concerned that the removal could potentially destroy one of the most archaeologically significant finds in North America. The Elizabeth Ordway Dunn Foundation made a donation of $25,000 to fund further exploration of the site, which continued until February 1999.

Following issuance of building permits by the City of Miami during the last week of January 1999, the Dade Heritage Trust (Miami-Dade County&#x27;s largest historic preservation organization) filed a lawsuit on January 31, 1999, seeking an injunction against further construction on site. The Trust filed the suit and arranged for an emergency hearing at the home of Circuit Court Judge Thomas Wilson. The basis for the lawsuit was that the developer had not obtained required approval in the form of a certificate of appropriateness from the City of Miami&#x27;s Historic and Environmental Preservation Board. At the hearing, the developer and the City were represented by counsel. Following arguments and Dade Heritage Trust&#x27;s admission that it was not prepared to post a bond to support the injunction request, the Judge denied the motion for temporary injunction. Baumann agreed to postpone construction on the site for thirty days while the archaeologists finished their work.

County Mayor for Miami-Dade Alex Penelas and others interested in saving the Circle, asked the County Commission to file a lawsuit to take ownership of the property. The Commission approved such action on February 18, and Judge Richard Feder ordered a temporary injunction against building on the site. Baumann agreed to sell, but asked for $50 million, a price which he eventually lowered to $26.7 million. In an unprecedented move, the State of Florida Preservation 2000 land acquisition program purchased the site from Baumann for that sum in November 1999, using both state funds and donations from various foundations and private citizens. The state considered creating a 3-D replica of the buried circle so that visitors could envision what the 2,000-year-old circle looked like.

The &quot;Brickell Point Site&quot; was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 5, 2002.

==Archaeology==

Artifacts recovered from the Miami Circle site are stored and on display at HistoryMiami. It is the official repository for all archaeological materials recovered in Miami-Dade County.

===Age===
In order to date the site, pieces of burnt wood were sent in March 1999 for radiocarbon dating by John Ricisak, a specialist in the County Historic Preservation department. The results were a surprise, indicating that the wood was between 1,800–2,000 years old. Some scholars, most notably Dr. Jerald Milanich, doubted that the circle was as old as the wood. Further evidence to support the theory that the holes were of that age comes from Tom Scott and Harley Means of the Florida Geological Survey, who point to the buildup of a calcite &quot;duricrust&quot; on the edge of the cut face. Though this is an extremely imprecise way to date the holes, it rules out that they were of modern origin.

===Origin===
Initial theories on the origin of the site by many members of the public were that it was created by the Olmec or Mayan civilizations. No evidence was found of any artifacts of Central American origin, however. Further examination of the artifacts found at the site, particularly the shell tools, shark teeth, and other items of aquatic origin, showed that they matched perfectly with artifacts known to be from a local tribe, the historic Tequesta.

The Tequesta were a tribe who were believed to be primarily nomadic, hunting fish and alligators in the Florida Everglades. They were considered aggressive as they killed many early European explorers who attempted landfall in Florida. The Tequesta, like many other Native Americans, succumbed to the new infectious diseases brought by European colonists, as well as were disrupted by warfare.

===Purpose===
Randolph Widmer of the University of Houston suggested holes were postholes for some kind of structure, probably a cone-shaped building with a hole in the top. These sorts of structures were known to have existed in the Eastern United States, yet none was thought to have had such a permanent base as the Miami Circle. Critics of this theory pointed out that there was no evidence of fire on the bedrock as is usually found in the remains of this type of buildings. Widmer&#x27;s response was that, given the weather common across Florida and resulting flooding, the early people may have raised the structure on stilts. This theory also suggested that the seemingly random array of holes could have been for support posts. They appear in clusters perhaps due to the necessity to replace them as the wood rotted.

Researchers next tried to determine the purpose of the structure. Two obvious candidates are living quarters, or a ceremonial building of some sort. The lack of evidence for the former began to suggest the latter, and further evidence can be put forward to support the theory. Firstly the effort necessary to create such a structure would involve considerable teamwork, particularly given the lack of tools. This sort of teamwork is often seen in the construction of religious buildings.

Secondly, there were certain anomalies in the artifacts discovered. Many &#x27;common&#x27; Tequesta relics were found at the site—tools and perhaps decorative items made from shells and other aquatic materials like sharks&#x27; teeth—but there were a few pieces discovered that did not fit. The main items were two basalt axe heads. These axes would have been a particularly sought after item on the southern Florida coast due to the lack of any equivalent hard stone in the area, yet these axe heads are completely untouched. Further analysis of the stone by Dr. Jacqueline Dixon, University of Miami, found that the basalt was likely from the region of Macon, Georgia, some away. Additional items that may have been placed in, or buried under the structure were a complete long shark skeleton, aligned east to west, a dolphin skull, and a complete carapace of a sea-turtle. Four human teeth were also found, though no other evidence pointed to its being a burial site.

=== Former septic tank ===
University of Florida archaeologist Jerald Milanich was concerned that there was, from the previous apartment block, a septic tank that was aligned perfectly at the edge of the circle. He suggested that the circle could be nothing more than a sink for the sewage from the septic tank.

In attempting to refute this claim, Ricicek pointed to two things. Firstly there was clearly a terracotta outflow from the tank that would not tie with the need for a sink, and the plans for the apartment complex clearly show a sewage outflow to the south, into the river. Secondly, returning to the analysis of the calcite buildup on the holes by the Florida Geological Survey, the bedrock that had been cut out to lay the tank had little or no duricrust, showing the considerable age difference between the septic tank construction and the Circle.

==Miami Circle Park==
HistoryMiami, then known as the Historical Museum of Southern Florida, signed a 44-year lease of the site in March 2008.

A waterfront park managed by HistoryMiami opened in 2011. The circle itself remains buried to protect it, while an audio tour and several panels describing it are available.

<doc id="1212631" wikidata="Q1569795" url="?curid=1212631" title="Sea state">
<text>In oceanography, sea state is the general condition of the free surface on a large body of water—with respect to wind waves and swell—at a certain location and moment. A sea state is characterized by statistics, including the wave height, period, and spectrum. The sea state varies with time, as the wind and swell conditions change. The sea state can be assessed either by an experienced observer (like a trained mariner) or by using instruments like weather buoys, wave radar or remote sensing satellites.

In the case of buoy measurements, the statistics are determined for a time interval in which the sea state can be considered to be constant. This duration has to be much longer than the individual wave period, but shorter than the period in which the wind and swell conditions can be expected to vary significantly. Typically, records of one hundred to one thousand wave periods are used to determine the wave statistics.

The large number of variables involved in creating and describing the sea state cannot be quickly and easily summarized, so simpler scales are used to give an approximate but concise description of conditions for reporting in a ship&#x27;s log or similar record.

== WMO sea state code==

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) sea state code largely adopts the &#x27;wind sea&#x27; definition of the Douglas Sea Scale.

:The direction from which the swell is coming should be recorded.

== Sea states in marine engineering ==

In engineering applications, sea states are often characterized by the following two parameters:

* The &quot;significant wave height&quot; &quot;H&quot;1/3 — the mean wave height of the highest third of the waves.
* The mean &quot;wave period&quot;, &quot;T&quot;1.

In addition to the short-term wave statistics presented above, long-term sea state statistics are often given as a joint frequency table of the significant wave height and the mean wave period. From the long and short-term statistical distributions, it is possible to find the extreme values expected in the operating life of a ship. A ship designer can find the most extreme sea states (extreme values of H1/3 and T1) from the joint frequency table, and from the wave spectrum, the designer can find the most likely highest wave elevation in the most extreme sea states and predict the most likely highest loads on individual parts of the ship from the response amplitude operators of the ship. Surviving the once in 100 years or once in 1000 years sea state is a normal demand for design of ships and offshore structures.

<doc id="1212650" wikidata="Q1686059" url="?curid=1212650" title="Triple test">
<text>The triple test, also called triple screen, the Kettering test or the Bart&#x27;s test, is an investigation performed during pregnancy in the second trimester to classify a patient as either high-risk or low-risk for chromosomal abnormalities (and neural tube defects).

The term &quot;multiple-marker screening test&quot; is sometimes used instead. This term can encompass the &quot;double test&quot; and &quot;quadruple test&quot; (described below).

The Triple screen measures serum levels of AFP, estriol, and beta-hCG, with a 70% sensitivity and 5% false-positive rate. It is complemented in some regions of the United States, as the &quot;Quad screen&quot; (adding inhibin A to the panel, resulting in an 81% sensitivity and 5% false-positive rate for detecting Down syndrome when taken at 15–18 weeks of gestational age) and other prenatal diagnosis techniques, although it remains widely used in Canada and other countries. A positive screen indicates an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities (and neural tube defects), and such patients are then referred for more sensitive and specific procedures to receive a definitive diagnosis, often prenatal diagnosis via amniocentesis, although the stronger screening option of cell-free fetal DNA screening (also popularly known as noninvasive prenatal screening) is frequently offered. The Triple test can be understood as an early predecessor to a long line of subsequent technological improvements. In some American states, such as Missouri, Medicaid reimburses only for the Triple test and not other potentially more accurate screening tests, whereas California offers Quad tests to all pregnant women.

While the triple test can be performed at any point between 15 and 21.9 weeks of gestation, the highest detection rate for open neural defects is given by a test performed between 16 and 18 weeks of gestation.

==Conditions screened==
The most common abnormality the test can screen is trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). In addition to Down syndrome, the triple and quadruple screens assess risk for fetal trisomy 18 also known as Edwards syndrome, open neural tube defects, and may also detect an increased risk of Turner syndrome, triploidy, trisomy 16 mosaicism, fetal death, Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome, and steroid sulfatase deficiency.

==Values measured==
The triple test measures the following three levels in the maternal serum:

# alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
# human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
# unconjugated estriol (UE3)

==Interpretation==
The levels may indicate increased risk for certain conditions or may be benign:

An estimated risk is calculated and adjusted for the expectant mother&#x27;s age; if she is diabetic; if she is having twins or other multiples, and the gestational age of the fetus. Weight and ethnicity may also be used in adjustments. Many of these factors affect the levels of the substances being measured and the interpretation of the results:

* As maternal weight increases, MSAFP level decreases
* African-American women have MSAFP levels that are 10-15% higher than those of Caucasian women for unknown reasons 
* Women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus have MSAFP levels that are 20% lower than the rest of the population
* Having multiple gestations, such as twins, increases MSAFP because each fetus secretes its own AFP
* Incorrect estimation of gestational age is the most common cause of abnormal MSAFP levels

The test is for screening, not for diagnosis, and does not have nearly the same predictive power as that of genetic blood testing (testing cell-free fetal DNA, or invasive genetic testing which are performed by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. The screening test carries a much lower risk to the fetus than invasive testing, however, and in conjunction with the age-related risk of the patient it is useful to help determine the need for more invasive tests.

==Variations==

If only two of the hormones above are tested for, then the test is called a double test. A quad test tests an additional hormone, inhibin. Furthermore, the triple test may be combined with an ultrasound measurement of nuchal translucency. 

===Double test===
Free beta hCG and PAPP-A are measured. However, the maternal age, weight, ethnicity etc. are still included. In the UK the double test is part of the combined test for prenatal diagnostics.

===Quadruple test===
A test of levels of dimeric inhibin A (DIA) is sometimes added to the other three tests, under the name &quot;quadruple test.&quot; Other names used include &quot;quad test&quot;, &quot;quad screen&quot;, or &quot;tetra screen.&quot; Inhibin A will be found high in cases of trisomy 21 and unchanged in cases of trisomy 18.

<text>Fritz Schiesser (born 23 April 1954) is a Swiss lawyer and politician, member of the Swiss Council of States (1990–2007).

Schiesser became a Member of the Swiss Council of States in 1990 as a Free democrat. President (speaker) of the Council of States in 2003/04. He was also member of the Parliament of the Canton of Glarus from 1995 to 2009. Member of the Swiss Delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.

In November 2007, Schiesser was appointed President of the ETH-Board for 2008–2011. The function being incompatible with the membership in the Council of States, Schiesser has to resign from the Council, despite his re-election a few weeks earlier. In November 2011, he was reappointed as President of the ETH Board for 2012-2016.

<doc id="1212671" wikidata="Q1765014" url="?curid=1212671" title="The Divine Comedy (Milla Jovovich album)">
<text>The Divine Comedy is the debut studio album by American actress and model Milla Jovovich, released on April 5, 1994, by SBK Records. She was billed as simply Milla for this release. The album is named after Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;.

&quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; was met with positive reception by critics and peaked at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Albums chart, while its lead single, &quot;Gentleman Who Fell&quot;, reached number 21 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Jovovich toured North America throughout 1994 to promote the album, opening for Crash Test Dummies and Toad the Wet Sprocket, as well as playing smaller acoustic sets.

==Background and production==
Milla Jovovich began working on a music album as early as 1988, when she was signed by SBK Records after the company heard a demo she had recorded. After some scrapped early recording sessions with producers under whom Jovovich found her creative input limited, Rupert Hine and Richard Feldman were ultimately enlisted to produce, and SBK acquiesced to Jovovich&#x27;s demand for creative control over her own album. Jovovich was the album&#x27;s primary lyricist and songwriter, while the music on four songs was co-written with Feldman and Mark Holden. Jovovich also collaborated musically with longtime friend Chris Brenner, who, in addition to co-writing one song, later served as a musical coordinator and member of Jovovich&#x27;s backing band for the album&#x27;s supporting tour.

Jovovich titled the album &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; after the 14th-century epic poem by Dante Alighieri of the same name, widely considered the preeminent work of Italian literature. She chose the title after seeing Russian artist Alexis Steele&#x27;s proposed cover artwork sketch for the then-untitled album, explaining: &quot;When I was first working on the sketch for the album cover my mom introduced me to a young Russian artist named Alexis Steele. I looked at his sketch for the cover and I saw that struggle—all the struggle that I&#x27;m singing about. It the divine comedy.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==
In August 1990, Jovovich asserted in an interview that the then-forthcoming album would be &quot;a mix between Kate Bush, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, This Mortal Coil and the Cocteau Twins&quot;. After it was initially presented by SBK strictly as a pop album, Jovovich protested, insisting on using her personal poetry for lyrics and recording her own instrumental material. Drawing inspiration from philosophy readings and her own Slavic background, Jovovich had written the songs when she was 16, with the exception of a Ukrainian folk song, &quot;In a Glade&quot;, that she covered in her native tongue. Three songs were written by Jovovich during the period she spent shooting the film &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; (1993); one, &quot;The Alien Song (For Those Who Listen)&quot;, would be incorporated into the film itself, which features Jovovich performing a short rendition of the song. Describing her lyrics on &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; as reflecting a mixture of &quot;youth and experience&quot;, Jovovich said: &quot;I was confused like any other 16-year-old is. There&#x27;s this young woman just fighting to get out, but there&#x27;s still a kid, you know—an experienced kid that&#x27;s gone through a lot, that&#x27;s read a lot of books and that knows a lot more than a lot of 40-year-olds do.&quot;

Musically, &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; is predominantly acoustic, coupling Jovovich&#x27;s &quot;strong, emotional&quot; vocals with guitars, flutes, mandolins, and dulcimers, among other instruments. Chris Willman of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it an album of &quot;acoustic-oriented, airy, folk-pop tunes&quot;, while &quot;Razor&quot; journalist Bret Love noted its &quot;largely acoustic folk-rock&quot; sound and &quot;philosophical lyrics and earnest melodies&quot;, which earned Jovovich comparisons to musicians such as Tori Amos and Kate Bush.

==Release and promotion==
For &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, Jovovich was billed mononymously as Milla, which she attributed to her surname frequently being mispronounced. Before the album&#x27;s release, SBK Records issued a promotional EP called &quot;Music from the Forthcoming Album ″The Divine Comedy″&quot;, featuring five songs from the album: &quot;Gentleman Who Fell&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Your Life&quot;, &quot;Bang Your Head&quot;, &quot;Clock&quot;, and &quot;In a Glade&quot;. &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; was released on April 5, 1994, peaking at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Albums chart.

&quot;Gentleman Who Fell&quot; was released as the first single from &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;. It reached number 21 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Modern Rock Tracks chart. In the United Kingdom, where &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; was released on June 6, 1994, &quot;Gentleman Who Fell&quot; peaked at number 65 on the UK Singles Chart, while in Canada, it reached number 72 on &quot;RPM&quot;″s singles chart. A music video for the song, directed by Lisa Bonet and featuring Harry Dean Stanton, was produced, but Jovovich was unsatisfied with the results and decided to film another version. The second video paid homage to Maya Deren&#x27;s short film &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; (1943) and was filmed in black and white. Later in 1994, &quot;Bang Your Head&quot; was released as a promotional single to radio, as was &quot;It&#x27;s Your Life&quot; the following year.

The supporting tour for &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; comprised three legs and 50 shows in total. The tour began with a small concert at the Borderline in London on February 1, 1994. The tour resumed in July with a first leg consisting of 22 shows at bars and cafés across North America. Jovovich had opted to perform in smaller and more intimate settings, turning down a musical appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The second and third legs consisted of 14 North American shows each, during which Jovovich opened for the bands Crash Test Dummies and Toad the Wet Sprocket.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; was released to positive reviews from music critics. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, John McAlley praised the album as &quot;remarkable&quot; and &quot;strikingly mature and rich in invention, counterpointing Milla&#x27;s lovelorn, angst-laced poetry with vivid melodies and arrangements that find a common spirit in synth pop, European folk and psychedelic dream rock.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Dimitri Ehrlich highlighted Jovovich as a gifted songwriter and melodist, noting &quot;an ear for delicate, medieval tunes and aching drama that would make Tori Amos envious.&quot; Dan O&#x27;Kane of &quot;CD Review&quot; called her &quot;a decent songwriter with a poetic style (in the Kate Bush vein) and a smoky, provocative voice&quot;, adding that the album&#x27;s various &quot;exotic flavors—pipes, panflute, Eastern strings, and chants—make this first effort interesting and different from the onslaught of grrrl rock.&quot; &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; critic Mikel Toombs stated that Jovovich &quot;impressively keeps both her imagery and her import-implying vocals in check&quot; and &quot;supplies just the right touch of the dark drama suggested by the album&#x27;s unnecessarily pretentious title, and gives all indications of a bright future.&quot;

Mike Joyce of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that Jovovich &quot;is forever struggling with words and emotions on... &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, forever trying to make sense of love or the lack of it. She never succeeds, of course, but her tenacity is what makes the album worth hearing. Evoking a curious combination of childlike innocence, Harlequin romance and hippie sentimentality, her songs are tone poems of a sort, inspired by vulnerability and wariness, sung in a small, plaintive, unguarded soprano. At times she seems hopelessly lovesick, a prime candidate for any heartbreaker&#x27;s ruse, but on &#x27;You Did It All Before,&#x27; &#x27;Clock,&#x27; and &#x27;Don&#x27;t Fade Away&#x27; she sounds a lot older and wiser, no stranger to hurt and disillusionment.&quot; &quot;Let It Rock&quot; commented: &quot;Her songs take form in fairytale poetry, as if she were some medieval storybook princess, held captive against her will in a Dragon&#x27;s Lair. Authentic Russian acoustic instruments create a soundscape of delicate beauty, ethereal, yet soulful and heartfelt. An original.&quot;

Johnny Cigarettes was more ambivalent in &quot;NME&quot;, writing that &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; lacked &quot;a decent tune&quot; despite Jovovich&#x27;s &quot;fine voice&quot; and &quot;intriguingly whimsical lyrics&quot;. In his Microsoft Music Central review, Ian Cranna said: &quot;At times it&#x27;s all too ethereal for its own good (though the second half is brighter and catchier), or a tad adolescent (she&#x27;s still only 18). Milla already floats like a butterfly; now she needs to sting like a bee. Better will come.&quot;

==Legacy==
Following &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, Jovovich expressed interest in releasing a second album, having had ten songs ready for a future recording that was intended for a summer 1997 release. However, Jovovich has yet to formally release a second album. Her 1998 studio album &quot;The People Tree Sessions&quot; was reportedly unauthorized, and Jovovich launched legal action in order for it to be taken off the market. In recent years, Jovovich has opted to release her new songs for free on her official website. With these demos, she extends to all listeners the right to remix the songs, but reserves the right to sell the songs, preventing unauthorized resale of her material.

&quot;While it&#x27;s now common for models and actors to try their hand at music,&quot; wrote Tom Demalon in a review for AllMusic, &quot;the good results of &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; are not as common... Milla has a pleasant voice and above-average songwriting ability, and the songs are organic, light, airy concoctions that work well in their understated settings.&quot; In 2003, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; named &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; to their list of &quot;50 Essential Pop Albums&quot;. &quot;Slant&quot; critic Sal Cinquemani said:

&quot;Gentleman Who Fell&quot; appears on the soundtracks for &quot;The Leading Man&quot; and &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;; &quot;It&#x27;s Your Life&quot; appears on the soundtrack for the Randal Kleiser film &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot;. &quot;In a Glade&quot; plays on many of the in-game radios in the &quot;Oblivion Lost&quot; mod of the game &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl&quot;, which takes place in Ukraine.

<text>The gang-gang cockatoo (Callocephalon fimbriatum) is a parrot found in the cooler and wetter forests and woodlands of Australia, particularly alpine bushland. It is the only species placed in the genus Callocephalon. Mostly mild grey in colour with some lighter scalloping (more pronounced and buffy in females), the male has a red head and crest, while the female has a small fluffy grey crest. It ranges throughout south-eastern Australia. The gang-gang cockatoo is the faunal emblem of the Australian Capital Territory. It is easily identified by its distinctive call, which is described as resembling a creaky gate, or the sound of a cork being pulled from a wine bottle.

The name &quot;gang-gang&quot; comes from a New South Wales Aboriginal language, probably from one of the coastal languages, although possibly from Wiradjuri. It is probably an onomatopoeic name.

==Taxonomy==
In 1803 the British Royal Navy officer James Grant included an illustration of the gang-gang cockatoo in his book describing a voyage to the colony of New South Wales in Australia. Grant coined the binomial name &quot;Psittacus fimbriatus&quot;. The gang-gang cockatoo is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Callocephalon&quot; that was introduced in 1837 by the French naturalist René Lesson. The type locality is the Bass River in the state of Victoria. The specific epithet is from Latin &quot;fimbriata &quot; meaning &quot;fringed&quot;. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;kallos&quot; meaning &quot;beauty&quot; and &quot;kephalē&quot; meaning &quot;head&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The classification of the gang-gang cockatoo has always been controversial due to the unusual appearance and coloration of the bird, especially its sexual dichromatism. The gang-gang cockatoo was thought to be a distinctive early offshoot of the Calyptorhynchinae (black) cockatoos. However, more recent molecular phylogenetic analysis places it in the Cacatuinae clade, not the Calyptorhynchinae, and having diverged from the palm cockatoo (&quot;Probosciger aterrimus&quot;).

== Description ==
The gang-gang cockatoo is in length with a wingspan, and weighs 230–334 grams. They are grey birds with wispy crests. The head and crest is bright red in males, but dark grey in females. The edges of feathers in underparts have edges of yellow or pink. The edges of feathers on upperarts are slightly paler grey than the rest of the feather, which makes the bird look somewhat barred. Juvenile males can be distinguished by their brighter crowns and shorter crests, but otherwise look similar to the adult female. The birds are not easily mistaken for other cockatoos, but while in flight may resemble the Galah. Gang-gangs are very social birds, but not overly noisy.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Gang-gangs are endemic to coastal regions of south-eastern Australia. They used to inhabit King Island off of Tasmania, but have become extinct there. They are an introduced species on Kangaroo Island. Gang-gangs prefer forests and woodlands in the mountains, with dense shrub understories. They migrate short distances during winter into more open habitats, but must migrate back to denser forests to breed, because they need tall trees in order to build nests.

==Behaviour and ecology==

=== Breeding habits ===
Unlike most other cockatoos, gang-gangs nest in young, solid trees. They often nest near water. The females using their strong beaks to excavate nesting cavities. Gang-gangs are monogamous. The breeding season lasts from spring to summer. The birds will lay 2-3 white eggs, the incubation period is 4 weeks and both sexes take care of the young.

=== Diet ===
They forage in canopies mostly feed on the flowers and buds of eucalypts.

==Status==
Loss of older, hollow trees and loss of feeding habitat across south-eastern Australia through land clearing has led to a significant reduction in the numbers of this cockatoo in recent years. As a result, the gang-gang is now listed as vulnerable in New South Wales. It is protected as a vulnerable species under the &quot;Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016&quot; (NSW). This protection status as a threatened species makes it a Tier 1 criminal offence for a person or corporation to knowingly damage the bird&#x27;s habitat. Damage is defined to include &quot;damage caused by removing any part of the habitat&quot;. Habitat is defined to include &quot;an area periodically or occasionally occupied by a species&quot;.

In July 2021, an Australian Department of the Environment and Energy spokesperson stated the population has declined by approximately 69% in the last three generations, or 21 years and in addition to this decline, the species has suffered direct mortality and habitat loss during the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season. Between 28 and 36 per cent of the species&#x27; distribution was impacted by the fires. As a result, it is set to be listed as endangered under the threatened fauna of Australia.

<text>Angiomas are benign tumors derived from cells of the vascular or lymphatic vessel walls (endothelium) or derived from cells of the tissues surrounding these vessels.

Angiomas are a frequent occurrence as patients age, but they might be an indicator of systemic problems such as liver disease. They are not commonly associated with cancer.

==Signs and symptoms==

Angiomas usually appear at or near the surface of the skin anywhere on the body, and may be considered bothersome depending on their location. However, they may be present as symptoms of another more serious disorder, such as cirrhosis. When they are removed, it is generally for cosmetic reasons.

==Types==

* Hemangiomas

<doc id="1212686" wikidata="Q2310285" url="?curid=1212686" title="Battle of Cárdenas">
<text>The Battle of Cárdenas was a minor naval engagement of the Spanish–American War fought on 11 May 1898 in the port of Cárdenas, Cuba, between an American squadron of 5 ships under Captain Chapman C. Todd and 3 small Spanish vessels under Mariano Mateu. The battle resulted in an unusually costly American reverse that dissuaded the U.S. Navy from undertaking further attacks on the port.

==Background==
In May 1898, a small squadron of the United States Navy, consisting of the torpedo boats and , the gunboats and , and the U.S. Revenue Cutter &quot;Hudson&quot;, was operating off the northern coast of Cuba. On May 11, 1898, this fleet entered the Bay of Cárdenas to destroy the three small Spanish gunboats reportedly moored in the harbor. Having swept the area for mines, Captain Todd ordered the &quot;Winslow&quot; to approach the shore and investigate a steamer moored alongside the wharf to determine whether the vessel was an enemy warship.

The Spanish squadron based on Cárdenas consisted of three ships: &quot;Ligera&quot;, &quot;Alerta&quot; and &quot;Antonio López&quot;, under the command of Teniente de Navío Mariano Mateu. The 42-ton &quot;Ligera&quot;, which had driven off &quot;Foote&quot; two weeks earlier in a fortuitous encounter off the harbour&#x27;s mouth, was under Lieutenant Antonio Pérez Rendón, while &quot;Alerta&quot;, of the same tonnage, was under Lieutenant Pasquín. Both gunboats mounted a cannon of 42 mm and a Maxim of 37 mm. &quot;Antonio López&quot; was a small tug armed with a Nordenfelt gun, and under the command of Lieutenant Domingo Montes Reguefeiros. The Spanish Line had transferred the &quot;Antonio Lopez&quot; to the navy some years before.

==Battle==

By 13:35, &quot;Winslow&quot; reached a point approximately 1,500 yards from her quarry when a white puff of smoke from &quot;Antonio López&quot;&#x27;s bow gun signaled the beginning of an artillery duel which lasted one hour and 20 minutes. &quot;Winslow&quot; responded with her 1-pounders. The Spanish concentrated their efforts on &quot;Winslow&quot;, and she soon received several direct hits. The first shot to score on the torpedo boat destroyed both her steam and manual steering gear. Her crew tried to rig an auxiliary steering system, but she swung broadside to the enemy and a shot pierced her hull near the engine room and knocked the port main engine out of commission. She maneuvered with her remaining engine to evade enemy fire and maintained a steady return fire with her 1-pounders. &quot;Wilmington&quot; and &quot;Hudson&quot; brought their guns to bear on the Spanish ship and shore, and the combined fire of the three American warships put the Spanish tugboat out of action while several waterfront buildings caught fire.

All but disabled, &quot;Winslow&quot; requested &quot;Hudson&quot; to tow her out of action. The revenue cutter approached the stricken torpedo boat and rigged a tow line between the two ships. As Hudson began to tow Winslow out to sea, one of the last Spanish shells to strike the torpedo boat hit her near the starboard gun and killed Ensign Worth Bagley who had been helping to direct the warship&#x27;s maneuvers by carrying instructions from the deck to the base of the engine room ladder. Ensign Bagley became known as the first U.S. naval officer killed in the Spanish–American War, killed along with four other sailors, John Barberes, John Daniels, George B. Meek and E.B. Tunnell.

==Aftermath==
Badly damaged, &quot;Winslow&quot; was towed clear of the action. Her commanding officer and several others in her crew were wounded. Lieutenant John Bernadou saw that the dead and wounded were transferred to &quot;Hudson&quot;, and he then left the ship after turning command over to Chief Gunner&#x27;s Mate George P. Brady, who — along with Chief Gunner&#x27;s Mate Hans Johnsen and Chief Machinist T. C. Cooney — later received the Medal of Honor.

Because at the time members of the Revenue Cutter Service were not eligible for the Navy Medal of Honor, Congress approved a special medal struck for them. Frank Newcomb, the commanding officer of &quot;Hudson&quot;, received the medal in gold, his officers received it in silver, and the enlisted crewmen in bronze. On the Spanish side, Teniente de Navío Montes, commander of the &quot;Antonio López&quot;, received the Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand.

The Spanish gunboat squadron, made of two steam launches and an armed tug, remained unscathed until the end of the war, when all the units were sold by the Spanish government. 

Another outcome was the legal cases initiated due to the damage sustained to private property. The surrounding area of the battle, near the present-day resort town of Varadero, was noted as an elite community that was home to many Cuban aristocratic families of European descent and several took up cases with the post-war Spanish Treaty Committee to receive compensation for damage made to their homes or businesses. The most high-profile of the cases was that of the socialite and heiress Enriqueta García Martín and her husband, landowner Francisco E. Cazañas for damages to their Buena Vista estate grounds near the Bay of Cárdenas, which included extensive farmlands and a major sugar plantation. The couple was awarded a total of $13,138 (over $360,000 in 2020 when adjusted for inflation) by the US Secretary of the Treasury, the second highest sum awarded by the Spanish Treaty Committee and the most to any private citizen not representing a corporation.

<text>Lance Corporal John Pennington Harman VC (20 July 1914 – 9 April 1944) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

His was one of three VC&#x27;s awarded for action in India during World War II, the others being awarded to John Niel Randle (also at the Battle of Kohima) and Abdul Hafiz (VC) at the Battle of Imphal.

==Early life &amp; education==
John Harman was the son of millionaire Martin Coles Harman, owner of Lundy Island, and followed his father&#x27;s interest in natural history.

Harman was educated at Bedales School and Clifton College.

==Details==
In 1935, Harman applied for a commission in the Royal Air Force, but was turned down for lack of qualifications in mathematics. He would later join the Army in 1941 as a private. 

Harman was 29 years old, and a lance-corporal in the 4th Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Own Royal West Kent Regiment, British Army during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.On 8/9 April 1944 at the Battle of Kohima, British India, Lance-Corporal Harman was commanding a section of a forward platoon where soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army had established a machine-gun post within 50 yards of his company and were becoming a menace. Since it was not possible to bring fire on to the enemy post the lance-corporal went forward by himself and threw a grenade into the position, destroying it. He returned carrying the enemy machinegun as a trophy. Early next morning, having ordered covering fire from his Bren gun team, he went out alone, with a Lee–Enfield rifle with fixed bayonet and charged a party of Japanese soldiers who were digging in. He shot four and bayoneted one. On his way back, Lance Corporal Harman was severely wounded by a burst of enemy machine-gun fire and died soon after reaching British lines.Having been shot Harman was recovered to the nearest trench by his company commander, Captain Donald Easten, and died in his arms. His final words were &quot;I got the lot&quot; referring to the party of Japanese soldiers. A plaque is displayed on the house where he was born in Shrewsbury Road, Beckenham, located in the London Borough of Bromley. There is also a memorial to him erected by his father in VC Quarry, on the east side of Lundy Island.

<doc id="1212699" wikidata="Q201659" url="?curid=1212699" title="Gotō, Nagasaki">
<text>is a city in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. It comprises the south-west half of the Gotō Islands plus (uninhabited) Danjo and Hizen Torishima archipelagos in the East China Sea. Although the core islands of the city lay some 100 kilometers from Nagasaki, the other archipelagos lay 60 km further to South-West. The city consists of 11 inhabited and 52 uninhabited islands. The three main islands of the city are Fukue, Hisaka, and Naru. As of March 31, 2017, the city has an estimated population of 37,775 and a population density of 90 persons per km2. The total area is 420.81 km2.

==History==
The area which is now Gotō City was a port of call on the trade route between Japan and Tang dynasty China in the Nara period. Noted Buddhist prelate Kukai stopped at Gotō in 806. The islands came under the control of the Gotō clan from the Muromachi period and was the location of intense European missionary activity in the late 16th century, which converted most of the population to the &quot;Kirishitan&quot; faith. After the start of the Tokugawa bakufu, the area was part of Fukue Domain in the Edo period. Fukue City was established in 1954. Most of the town was destroyed in a fire in 1962.

The modern city of Gotō was established on August 1, 2004, from the merger of the city of Fukue with the towns of Kishiku, Miiraku, Naru, Tamanoura and Tomie (all from Minamimatsuura District). The population of the area has declined from over 60,000 inhabitants in 1980 due to economic migration and aging population issues.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Gotō has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) with hot summers and cool winters. Precipitation is high throughout the year, and is heavy from April to September.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Gotō in 2020 is 34,391 people. Gotō has been conducting censuses since 1920.
==Events==
Gotō used to host the Ironman Japan Triathlon. The triathlon was established in 2001, and the event was canceled in 2010. Ironman chose not to renew the race for 2011. The city now hosts the Goto Nagasaki International Triathlon using the same course for the previous Ironman event.

In late summer there is the Bon festival where people gather in the main area of Fukue and hold a parade along with street vendors. The parade features various floats all of which are lit up at night and walked through the town. At the end there is a beautiful firework show.

In winter there (usually held on the 2nd or 3rd weekend of January) is an event called &quot;Hettomatto&quot;, also known as the &#x27;naked man race&#x27;. Participants run along a course in a fundoshi.

==Transportation==
Gotō-Fukue Airport on Fukue serves the city. It was established in 1963 to serve as a regional airport.

<doc id="1212702" wikidata="Q213534" url="?curid=1212702" title="Syngnathidae">
<text>The Syngnathidae is a family of fish which includes seahorses, pipefishes, and seadragons (&quot;Phycodurus&quot; and &quot;Phyllopteryx&quot;). The name is derived from (), meaning &quot;together&quot;, and (), meaning &quot;jaw&quot;. The fused jaw is one of the traits that the entire family have in common.

==Description and biology==
Syngnathids are found in temperate and tropical seas across the world. Most species inhabit shallow, coastal waters, but a few are known from the open ocean, especially in association with sargassum mats. They are characterised by their elongated snouts, fused jaws, the absence of pelvic fins, and by thick plates of bony armour covering their bodies. The armour gives them a rigid body, so they swim by rapidly fanning their fins. As a result, they are relatively slow compared with other fish but are able to control their movements with great precision, including hovering in place for extended periods.

Uniquely, after syngnathid females lay their eggs, the male then fertilizes and carries the eggs during incubation, using one of several methods. Male seahorses have a specialized ventral brood pouch to carry the embryos, male sea dragons attach the eggs to their tails, and male pipefish may do either, depending on their species. The most fundamental difference between the different lineages of the family Syngnathidae is the location of male brood pouch. The two locations are on the tail (Urophori) and on the abdomen (Gastrophori). There is also variation in Syngnathid pouch complexity with brood pouches ranging from simple ventral gluing areas to fully enclosed pouches. In species with more developed, enclosed pouches it has been demonstrated that males directly provide their brood with not only nutrients but also immunity to pathogens. Syngnathids with more developed brood pouches are also known to be able to partially or completely abort a brood from a female with low fitness.

A wide variety of mate choice and mating competition has been observed in Syngnathidae. For example, &quot;Hippocampus fuscus&quot; exhibits conventional sex roles of males competing for female access while &quot;Corythoichthys haematopterus&quot; is completely sex role reversed. Most conventional sex role syngnathids are monogamous whereas sex role reversed species mostly exhibit polygamous behavior.

Seahorses and pipefish also have a unique feeding mechanism, known as elastic recoil feeding. Although the mechanism is not well understood, seahorses and pipefish appear to have the ability to store energy from contraction of their epaxial muscles (used in upward head rotation), which they then release, resulting in extremely fast head rotation to accelerate their mouths towards unsuspecting prey.

== Evolution ==
Phylogenetic analysis implies that the most recent common ancestor of all syngnathids was likely pouchless. The family &quot;Solenostomidae&quot; (ghost pipefish) is a family in the order Syngnathiformes. Female ghost pipefish incubate their developing embryos inside fused pelvic fins. Evolutionary transitions from female to male care are practically nonexistent in teleosts, so brood pouches were likely not ancestral. Genome sequencing supports this, revealing multiple different origins across and within different brood pouch types. Oviparity was the ancestral trait, and the evolution of viviparity must have relied on the evolution and integration of multiple complex traits such as morphology, physiology, and behavior.

Syngnathidae was historically divided into two major lineages based on brood pouch location: &quot;Neophinae&quot; (located on the trunk) and &quot;Syngnathinae&quot; (located on the tail). Genome sequencing shows a parallel increase in brood pouch complexity in both &quot;Neophinae&quot; and &quot;Syngnathinae&quot;. Some species may have also independently evolved to have trunk brooding phenotypes, separate from the &quot;Neophinae&quot;. One example of this convergent evolution arises in pygmy seahorses (&quot;Hippocampus bargibanti, Hippocampus denise, Hippocampus pontohi&quot;). Pygmy seahorses are very small (about 1–2 cm tall) trunk brooders, phylogenetically surrounded by tail brooders. It&#x27;s likely that the pygmy seahorse once had their brood pouch on their tail. The brood pouch may have moved locations when there was strong a correlated selection for a prehensile tail and diminutive size, resulting in a very small, trunk brooding organism.

Viviparity and male-pregnancy in Syngnathidae have a complex evolutionary history with many independent origins of similar traits. Early members of the family developed traits to limit the presence of deleterious mutations, allowing for more rapid evolution. The advantage of a more controlled and protected embryonic development seemed to be enough to enact evolutionary development throughout Syngnathidae to varying degrees.

In species with the most complex brood pouch systems, many traits (behavioral, physiological, morphological, and immunological) must have co‑evolved to allow for male pregnancy, driven by the increase of the fitness of those individuals’ offspring. The evolution of these traits resulted in a sex-role reversal in which females may exhibit competitive behavior for a mate.

Recent research, especially whole-genome sequencing, has allowed for greatly improved understanding of the evolutionary history of Syngnathidae, but there is still a need for further development in the field. Further investigations into the genetic mechanisms and selective motivation for the evolution of these traits in Syngnathidae may provide insight into the evolution of pregnancy separate from the female reproductive system.

The earliest syngnathids are known from the Eocene of Monte Bolca, Italy.

<text>Online consultations or e-consultations refer to an exchange between government and citizens using the Internet. They are one form of online deliberation. Further, online consultation consists in using the Internet to ask a group of people their opinion on one or more specific topics, allowing for trade-offs between participants. Generally, an agency consults a group of people to get their thoughts on an issue when a project or a policy is being developed or implemented, e.g. to identify or access options, or to evaluate ongoing activities. This enables governments to draft more citizen-centered policy.

As the Internet gains popularity with the public for voicing opinion, citizen participation in policy development through cyberspace is changing the face of democracy. The rise of the Internet has given way to buzzwords such as e-democracy, referring to citizen participation in politics, government issues and policy development through electronic technologies and the Internet, and eGovernment, pertaining to providing citizens with government information and services online. Online consultation is an extension of these concepts. Through online engagement, government is enabled to hold interactive dialogues with the public as they have a more direct route to citizen opinion via the Internet.

The California Report Card (CRC) facilitates online consultation, working to support collaboration between citizens and the government though the Internet. Gavin Newsom, Lt. Governor of California, and the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society at University of California, Berkeley jointly launched the CRC in January 2014. The CRC allows for Californians to vote online on six timely issues. The site then redirects users to an electronic &quot;cafe&quot; using Principal Component Analysis. In the &quot;cafe&quot;, participants can textually submit their own suggestions and assess the ideas of other users. The CRC offers a means of connecting the public to the California government. 

While this definition is framed in the Canadian context, other countries like the UK, Denmark, Scotland, and Australia can also be considered leaders in the field. These and many other countries are integrating online consultations and engagement using various methods and for a range of purposes. The European Union also utilises online consultations. These complement face-to-face consultations and help to create greater transparency of the democratic process. Online consultations are also increasingly being used by the United Nations and its Specialized Agencies. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN hosts online consultations to allow for more inclusive drafting processes of policy guidelines, reports and strategy papers. The Global Forum on Food Security and Nutrition (FSN Forum) is tasked with carrying out many of these consultations.

==Channels==
Online consultations and engagement activities can utilize: 
*Websites, discussion boards, and electronic mailing lists, which have the ability to aid in policy development by providing the public with pertinent information and engaging them in order to extract feedback on issues. 
*Weblogs and real time online chat that can often put the public in direct contact with government officials, such as their MP, deputy or other political figure with whom they can share opinion and concerns

<text>The wooden ox (木牛流馬; &quot;lit.&quot; wooden ox and flowing horse) was a single-wheeled cart with two handles (i.e., a wheelbarrow) whose invention within China is sometimes credited to Zhuge Liang while he served Shu Han around the year 230 CE. The wooden ox purportedly allowed a single man to transport enough food to supply four others for up to three months, and this allowed for the feeding of large armies in the field. The wooden ox is pulled from the front, like an ox with a yoke; the flowing horse is pushed from behind. The basic device, however, appears to have been recorded centuries earlier in stone carvings dating from as early as 206 BCE.

<doc id="1212721" wikidata="Q3380604" url="?curid=1212721" title="Release notes">
<text>Release notes are documents that are distributed with software products or hardware products, sometimes when the product is still in the development or test state (e.g., a beta release). For products that have already been in use by clients, the release note is delivered to the customer when an update is released. Another abbreviation for Release notes is &quot;Changelog&quot; or &quot;Release logs&quot; or &quot;Software changes&quot; or &quot;Revision history&quot; &quot;Updates or README file&quot;. However, in some cases, the release notes and changelog are published separately. This split is for clarity and differentiation of feature-highlights from bugs, change requests (CRs) or improvements on the other side.

==Purpose==
Release Notes are documents that are shared with end users, customers and clients of an organization. The definition of the terms &#x27;End Users&#x27;, &#x27;Clients&#x27; and &#x27;Customers&#x27; are very relative in nature and might have various interpretations based on the specific context. For instance, the Quality Assurance group within a software development organization can be interpreted as an internal customer.

== Content ==
Release notes detail the corrections, changes or enhancements (functional or non-functional) made to the service or product the company provides.

They might also be provided as an artifact accompanying the deliverables for System Testing and System Integration Testing and other managed environments especially with reference to an information technology organization.

Release notes can also contain test results and information about the test procedure. This kind of information gives readers of the release note more confidence in the fix/change done; this information also enables implementer of the change to conduct rudimentary acceptance tests.

They differ from End-user license agreement, since they do not (should not) contain any legal terms of the software product or service. The focus should be on the software release itself, not for example legal conditions.

Release notes can also be interpreted as describing how to install or build the software, instead of highlighting new features or resolved bugs. Another term often used in this context is &quot;System Requirements&quot;, meaning the required hardware and software for installing or building the software.

==Format style==
There is no standard format for release notes that is followed throughout different organizations. Organizations normally adopt their own formatting styles based on the requirement and type of the information to be circulated. The content of release notes also vary according to the release type. For products that are at testing stage and that are newly released, the content is usually more descriptive compared to release notes for bug fixes and feature enhancements, which are usually brief.

Release notes may include the following sections:
* Header – Document name (i.e. release notes), product name, release number, release date, note date, note version, etc.
* Overview - A brief overview of the product and changes, in the absence of other formal documentation.
* Purpose - A brief overview of the purpose of the release note with a listing of what is new in this release, including bug fixes and new features.
** Issue summary - A short description of the bug or the enhancement in the release.
** Steps to reproduce - The steps that were followed when the bug was encountered.
** Resolution - A short description of the modification/enhancement that was made to fix the bug.
* End-user impact - What different actions are needed by the end-users of the application. This should include whether other functionality is impacted by these changes.
* Support impacts - Changes required in the daily process of administering the software.
* Notes - Notes about software or hardware installation, upgrades and product documentation (including documentation updates)
* Disclaimers - Company and standard product related messages. e.g.; freeware, anti-piracy, duplication etc.. See also disclaimer.
* Contact - Support contact information.

A release note is usually a terse summary of recent changes, enhancements and bug fixes in a particular software release. It is not a substitute for user guides. Release notes are frequently written in the present tense and provide information that is clear, correct, and complete.

A proposal for an open-specification exists and is called Release Notes Schema Specification.

<doc id="1212738" wikidata="Q471325" url="?curid=1212738" title="Rafael Urdaneta">
<text>Rafael José Urdaneta y Farías (October 24, 1788 – August 23, 1845) was a Venezuelan General and hero of the Spanish American wars of independence. He served as President of Gran Colombia from 1830 until 1831. He was an ardent supporter of Simón Bolívar and one of his most trusted and loyal allies.

== Personal life ==

Rafael Urdaneta was born in Maracaibo, Captaincy General of Venezuela to a prominent family of Spanish descent on October 24, 1788. He was a son of the marriage between Miguel Jerónimo de Urdaneta y Troconis and María Alejandrina de Farías. He began his elementary education in Maracaibo, and his secondary education in Caracas. Prior to the independence war, he was a student of Latin and philosophy.

He married Dolores Vargas París, a young and renowned heroine of the city of Santa Fe, in Santa Fe, Gran Colombia, on August 31, 1822. Before Gran Colombia was dissolved in 1831, the marriage had enjoyed much popularity. However, following the dissolution and the establishment of a dictatorship in the Republic of New Granada, they were forced to flee the country. Upon reaching Maracaibo, Venezuela (Urdaneta&#x27;s native city), they suffered persecution from General Páez, who had become one of Bolívar&#x27;s ideological adversaries after the end of the Venezuelan War of Independence. Urdaneta and Dolores were supporters of Bolívar&#x27;s cause; so they were forced to flee again, this time to Curaçao.

In 1832, they were able to return to Caracas through a license granted to the family by the government of Venezuela, but it stipulated that Urdaneta was not to intervene in the politics of the country. The family moved to Santa Ana de Coro, where a revolt erupted against the government. This opened the doors for Urdaneta to venture into Venezuelan politics once again. He was eventually able to retain a position as a senator until 1845.

In 1845, he was appointed Envoy of Venezuela to Spain, but he died in Paris, France, on the 23rd of August of that year from complications from kidney stones, and before ever reaching Spain.

Urdaneta is buried in the National Pantheon of Venezuela since May 16, 1876.

In 2015, the 24th of October was decreed as a national holiday in Venezuela to commemorate him.

== Military career ==
Encouraged by his uncle, Martín de Urdaneta y Troconis, who had been employed in Santa Fe, Viceroyalty of New Granada as the chief accountant of the Court of Accounts of the Real Audiencia of Santa Fe, Urdaneta traveled to that city in 1804 with the intention of developing his studies. He lived several years in Santa Fe, acquiring experience in the administration of military affairs.

On July 20, 1810, a junta was formed in Santa Fe: one of the many independence movements that were beginning to take shape across the entire continent following the establishment of the Caracas Junta in April of that year; Urdaneta joined the movement. He was incorporated into the first battalion of the patriot army of New Granada on November 1, 1810, as a lieutenant, and the following year fought in the &quot;Campaña del Sur&quot; of New Granada. Following the Battle of Santa Fe in 1813, he was captured by the royalists and imprisoned for a few months before being liberated.

=== Admirable Campaign ===

Simón Bolívar had been exiled from Venezuelan territory after the collapse of the first republic he had established in 1811, but by 1813 he was fighting the royalists in the New Granada region. It was during this time that Urdaneta was able to join Bolívar&#x27;s revolutionary army. Bolívar&#x27;s Admirable Campaign to reclaim Venezuela proved to be a stage for Urdaneta. He distinguished himself under the command of colonel José Félix Ribas on July 2, 1813, in the Battle of Niquitao, and was decisive for the patriot victory at the Battle of Taguanes against the royalist forces of Colonel Julián Izquierdo.

Following the patriot victory and the establishment of the Second Republic of Venezuela, in the report before the New Granada Congress at Tunja, Bolívar described Urdaneta as: &quot;worthy of recommendation and deserving of all esteem from the government for the valor and intelligence with which he distinguished himself in action.&quot;

From that moment on he led numerous military actions, among which stand out the , the 1814 Caracas Exodus, the (after which he was promoted to Lieutenant-general at only 26 years of age), the Capture of Maracaibo, and the March to San Carlos in 1821 that liberated the Province of Coro and set the stage for the Battle of Carabobo. He did not participate in the Battle of Carabobo since Bolívar considered that the exhaustion his troops had suffered during the march was too great. In view of Urdaneta&#x27;s service, Bolívar requested at this moment that he be promoted to General Officer.
Following the Battle of Carabobo in 1821, with Venezuela independent and after years of service to the patriotic cause, Urdaneta became one of Bolívar&#x27;s closest friends and collaborators.

=== Conspiración Septembrina ===

In 1828 Urdaneta, then Minister of War and presiding over the Cabinet, was in charge of judging the alleged traitors behind the September Conspiracy by which an attempt was made to assassinate Bolívar, then president of Gran Colombia. Convinced without any doubt that Francisco de Paula Santander was the head conspirator, Urdaneta, along with the majority of the ministers in the Cabinet, sentenced him to death. Bolívar was afraid for the stability of the union between New Granada and Venezuela, so he forced Santander to lifelong exile instead. 
However, conflicts such as this one, in addition to the assassination of Antonio José de Sucre in 1830, ultimately led to the collapse of Gran Colombia and; therefore, the union for which Bolívar had sacrificed so much to maintain since independence was achieved.

Throughout his life, Urdaneta also served as Chief of Army Staff and as Minister of War and Navy.

Bolívar called him &quot;&quot;El Brillante&quot; (&quot;The Brilliant&quot;&quot;), for his remarkable sense of strategy in battle; a name now used to refer to him in Venezuelan historiography.

He is considered to have been &quot;the most loyal of loyals to Bolívar&quot;. His loyalty to the patriotic cause and the ideals of Bolívar was perpetuated in the words he once said to him:
== Presidency ==

In 1830, the rising animosity between New Granadians and Venezuelans reached a boiling point. At the time, the Venezuelan battalion Callao, loyal to General Bolívar, was stationed in Bogotá. Another battalion, loyal to General Francisco de Paula Santander, and also stationed in the same city, persuaded the Government to relocate Callao to the city of Tunja. This action provoked an uproar in the civilian population from Venezuela that lived in Bogotá, and triggered a confrontation between both battalions.

The Callao battalion defeated the Neogranadine battalion and President Joaquín Mosquera y Arboleda and Vice President Domingo Caycedo y Sanz de Santamaría fled from the capital. On September 5, 1830, General Urdaneta took control of the presidency under the title of &quot;Provisional Chief of the Government of the Republic of Colombia&quot;. It was the hope of General Urdaneta and his allies to persuade Bolívar, who had resigned in May of that year, to return to the capital and once again take over as president.

When it became clear that Bolívar would not return to the capital, and in an effort to restore peace and order, Urdaneta ordered Congress to convene on June 15, 1831, in the city of Villa de Leyva.

Nevertheless, before congress could convene, the Neogranadine generals expressed their displeasure against General Urdaneta, and military actions erupted throughout the country. Generals José María Obando and José Hilario López took control of the southern states of New Granada, and General José Salvador Córdova Muñoz of the northern states. On April 14, 1831, the advancing armies proclaimed Caycedo as the legitimate head of the executive, and requested General Urdaneta to enter into peace negotiations. Urdaneta accepted, and met with the Neogranadine generals in the town of Apulo. On 28 April both parties signed the &quot;Treaty of Apulo&quot;, by which peace was secured and Urdaneta relinquished power.

<text>The province of Ancona () is a province in the Marche region of Italy. Its capital is the city of Ancona, and the province borders the Adriatic Sea. The city of Ancona is also the capital of Marche.

To the north, the province is bordered by the Adriatic Sea, and the Apennine Mountains to the west. The population of the province is mostly located in coastal areas and in the provincial capital Ancona, which has a population of 101,518; the province has a total population of 477,892 as of 2015.

Due to its coastal location, it is strategically important. Its coastline of sandy beaches is popular with Italians but has not been greatly affected by tourism. A large area of the province&#x27;s land is farmland often used for wine production; the province produces wines using the Montepulciano, Sangiovese, and Verdicchio varieties of grape. Annually, feasts occur in the province during the harvesting period. It contains mountainous regions and the Conero Regional Park, which contain dense forests where black truffles are found. These are sold in Acqualagna, in the neighbouring province of Pesaro and Urbino.

Famous people born of the province of Ancona include Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor (Iesi); International Gothic painter Gentile da Fabriano (Fabriano); writer Rafael Sabatini (Iesi); composer Gaspare Spontini (Maiolati, which has since been named after him as Maiolati Spontini); composer Giovanni Battista Pergolesi (Jesi); mathematician and physicist Vito Volterra (Ancona); footballer Roberto Mancini (Jesi); Pope Leo XII (Genga); Pope Pius IX (Senigallia); and actress Virna Lisi (Iesi).

<doc id="1212755" wikidata="Q535185" url="?curid=1212755" title="Edward Goldsmith">
<text>Edward René David Goldsmith (8 November 1928 – 21 August 2009), widely known as Teddy Goldsmith, was an Anglo-French environmentalist, writer and philosopher.

He was a member of the prominent Goldsmith family, the eldest son of Major Frank Goldsmith, and elder brother of the financier James Goldsmith. Edward Goldsmith was also the founding editor and publisher of &quot;The Ecologist&quot;. Known for his outspoken views opposing industrial society and economic development, he expressed a strong sympathy for the ways and values of traditional peoples.

He co-authored the influential &quot;A Blueprint for Survival&quot; with Robert Allen, becoming a founding member of the political party &quot;People&quot; (later renamed the Green Party), itself largely inspired by the&quot; Blueprint&quot;. Goldsmith&#x27;s more conservative view of environmentalism put him at odds with socialist currents of thought which came to dominate within the Green Party. 

A deep ecologist and systems theorist, Goldsmith was an early proponent of the Gaia hypothesis, having previously developed a similar cybernetic concept of a self-regulating biosphere.

A talented after-dinner speaker and raconteur, Goldsmith was an articulate spokesman and campaigner, receiving a number of awards for his work protecting the natural world and highlighting the importance and plight of indigenous peoples, including an honorary Right Livelihood Award and the Chevalier de la Legion d&#x27;Honneur.

== Early life ==
Goldsmith (widely known as Teddy) was born in Paris in 1928 to a German Jewish father, Frank Goldsmith, and French mother, Marcelle Mouiller.

He entered Millfield School, Somerset, as a grammar student, and he later graduated with honours in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Magdalen College, Oxford (1947–1950). While studying at Oxford, Goldsmith rejected the reductionist and compartmentalised ideas taught at the time, and he sought a more holistic worldview with which to study societies and the problems facing the world at large.

After fulfilling his National Service as a British Intelligence Officer in Hamburg and Berlin, he involved himself unsuccessfully in a number of business ventures and devoted most of his spare time to the study of the subjects that were to preoccupy him for the rest of his life.

Throughout the 1960s, he spent time travelling the world with his close friend, John Aspinall, witnessing at first hand the destruction of traditional societies. He concluded that the spread of economic development and its accompanying industrialisation, far from being progressive as claimed, was actually the root cause of social and environmental destruction.

== Work ==

=== Primitive People&#x27;s Fund ===

In London, at meetings of the Primitive People&#x27;s Fund (the committee that founded Survival International), Goldsmith teamed up with the fund&#x27;s treasurer Robert Prescott-Allen, the explorer Jean Liedloff, and a writer from &quot;World Medicine&quot;, Peter Bunyard, to found &quot;The Ecologist&quot; in 1969.

=== &quot;Theory of a Unified Science&quot; ===
After rejecting what he saw as the excessively reductionist and compartmentalised approach of mainstream academia, he spent much of his time researching and developing his own theories for the unification of the sciences. The &quot;Theory of a Unified Science&quot; was heavily influenced by cybernetics, as well as the General Systems Theory of Ludwig von Bertalanffy, the holism of the early academic ecologists, and the functionalism employed by many anthropologists. His theory would later be published, in its final form, as &quot;The Way: An Ecological World View.&quot; (see below)

Early on, Goldsmith had formulated a concept of the biosphere as an integrated cybernetic entity, the self-regulating parts (in which he included tribal societies) co-operating, largely unconsciously, for the mutual benefit of the whole, a view that anticipated aspects of the Gaia thesis, of which he was to become a leading proponent.

Goldsmith was also a critic of neo-Darwinism. He claimed that it is a reductionist theory and that if you understand evolution, it is necessary to &quot;abandon the reductionistic and mechanistic paradigm of science&quot;.

=== &quot;The Ecologist&quot; ===

Having established &quot;The Ecologist&quot; in 1969 with founding editors Robert Allen, Jean Liedloff, and Peter Bunyard, Goldsmith was to use the journal as a platform for his theoretical concerns with regular articles appearing under the heading &quot;Towards a Unified Science&quot;. The journal also became an important forum for the early green movement, with articles focusing on the relevance and survival of hunter-gatherer societies, alternative technology and organic farming, together with prescient articles about climate change, resource depletion, and nuclear accidents. They were accompanied by the usual gamut of articles examining pollution, overpopulation, deforestation, soil erosion, corporate power, large dams, and, not least, the World Bank&#x27;s alleged role in &quot;financing the destruction of our planet&quot;.

=== &quot;A Blueprint For Survival&quot; ===

Signed by over thirty of the leading scientists of the day, including Sir Julian Huxley, Sir Frank Fraser Darling, Sir Peter Medawar, Sir Peter Scott, and C. H. Waddington, Goldsmith and his fellow editor Robert Allen made headlines in January 1972 with &quot;A Blueprint for Survival&quot;.

The &quot;Blueprint&quot; was a far reaching proposal for a radical transition to a largely decentralised and deindustrialised society, an attempt to prevent what the authors referred to as &quot; the breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the life-support systems on this planet&quot;. It became a key text for the early Green movement, selling over half a million copies, and it was translated into 16 languages. In many ways, it anticipated the concerns taken up by today&#x27;s Transition Movement.

Goldsmith and Allen argued that rather than devise imaginary utopias, as did Marxist and liberal political theorists of the time, they should instead look to the example of existing tribal peoples, who, the authors claimed, were real-life working models of societies perfectly adapted to both their long-term survival needs and the needs of the living world on which they depended. The tribal peoples alone, the authors argued, had demonstrated a viable means by which the most pressing problems facing humanity could be answered successfully.

Such societies were characterised by their small, human-scale communities, low-impact technologies, successful population controls, sustainable resource management, holistic and ecologically integrated worldviews and a high degree of social cohesion, physical health, psychological well-being and spiritual fulfilment of their members.

=== The People Party ===

The &quot;Blueprint&quot; was a major inspiration for the embryonic political party called &quot;People&quot; (later to become the Green Party,) which invited Goldsmith to stand for the Eye constituency in Suffolk as their candidate in the February 1974 general election.

The campaign focused on the threat of desertification from the intensive farming practised in the area, which Goldsmith emphasised with the help of a Bactrian camel supplied by Aspinall. Goldsmith was in turn accompanied by bearded supporters dressed in the garb of Arab sheiks, the implication being that if modern oil-intensive farming practises were allowed to continue, the camel would be the only viable means of transport left in Suffolk. Goldsmith lost his deposit, but his unorthodox campaign succeeded in attracting the media&#x27;s attention and highlighted the issues. He again stood for the now-renamed Ecology Party at the European elections in 1979, now winning a more respectable portion of the vote.

=== Cornwall ===
In 1973, buoyed by the success of the &quot;Blueprint&quot; and a sudden rise in public awareness of ecological issues, partly brought about by the Stockholm Conference and the publication of the Club of Rome&#x27;s &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; in the same year. Goldsmith and his editorial team moved from their offices in London to relocate to rural Cornwall, in the far west of England. Goldsmith and his colleagues bought themselves farms, and for the following 17 years, they attempted to form a small-scale, relatively self-sufficient community of their own, and &quot;The Ecologist&quot; continued to be produced on-site, in between their other chores.

In 1977, when the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) threatened to site a nuclear reactor on farmland in Luxulyan, Cornwall, Goldsmith was among those who organised a continuous sit-in of the land, with local people blocking the entrance and staffing round-the-clock garrisons to prevent CEGB contractors from starting their drilling work. An early example of an environmental protest camp, the High Court of England and Wales eventually awarded in favour of CEGB allowing the drilling to go ahead. The CEGB never went on to develop the site, however.

=== The Gandhi Peace Foundation ===
In 1974, Goldsmith spent four months with the Gandhi Peace Foundation in New Delhi, comparing the Gandhian (&quot;Sarvodaya&quot;) movement with the Ecology movement in Europe. This led Goldsmith to forge close links with Indian environmental activists, in particular with the Chipko movement, including Sunderlal Bahuguna and Vandana Shiva. That was to have a major influence on Goldsmith&#x27;s approach to environmental activism and led to a special issue of &quot;The Ecologist&quot; on the subject.

=== World Bank ===
In 1984, together with his colleague Nicholas Hildyard, Goldsmith authored a multi-volume report on the destructive effects of large-scale, hydroelectric dams. It was the beginning of a long attack against the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which Goldsmith and his colleagues accused of financing the destruction of the planet.

In one episode, Goldsmith wrote an open letter to the then President of the World Bank, Alden W. Clausen, demanding that the bank &quot;stop financing the destruction of the tropical world, the devastation of its remaining forests, the extermination of its wildlife and the impoverishment and starvation of its human inhabitants&quot;. At the time, the connection between large-scale development projects and social and environmental destruction had not been widely recognised, even within the environmental movement.

=== Forests campaign ===
In 1989, Goldsmith helped to organise an international campaign calling for an immediate end to the destruction of the world&#x27;s remaining forests with its detrimental effects on indigenous cultures, biodiversity and global climate. The campaign raised over 3 million signatures, which were taken in wheelbarrows to the UN&#x27;s headquarters in New York City. Goldsmith and a party of activists subsequently occupied the main lobby, refusing to move until the Secretary-General, Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, agreed to see them. The group demanded for him to call an extraordinary general meeting of the Security Council to tackle the global crisis of deforestation. Although failing, the campaign managed to organise a meeting in the US Senate with a group of senators, headed by Al Gore, whom the activists called upon to end their support of the World Bank.

=== The Goldsmith Foundation ===
In 1991, with the financial support of his brother James, Goldsmith established the Goldsmith (JMG) Foundation supporting a diverse range of non-governmental organisations campaigning against environmentally destructive activities, along with organisations providing sustainable alternatives.

=== The Way ===
In 1990, urged on by Arne Næss, Goldsmith left the editorship of &quot;The Ecologist&quot; to Nicholas Hildyard, while taking time off to write his philosophical magnum opus &quot;The Way: an ecological worldview&quot;. &quot;The Way&quot; (1992) was the culmination and synthesis of more than four decades of theoretical development, embodying a &quot;coherent worldview&quot; by which Goldsmith would attempt to explain the self-inflicted problems facing the world and to propose a way out of them. Much of the work was already mature in Goldsmith&#x27;s mind by the time that he published the first issues of &quot;The Ecologist&quot; in 1970.

=== Later life ===
In addition to the UK &quot;Ecologist&quot;, Goldsmith later helped to found and support &quot;The Ecologist&quot; as independent enterprises in many parts of the world:

: &quot;Brazil&quot; (in Portuguese); &quot;France&quot; (in French); &quot;Asia&quot; (India); &quot;Italy&quot; (in Italian); &quot;Greece&quot; (in Greek); &quot;The Pacific&quot; (New Zealand); &quot;Lebanon&quot; (in Arabic); &quot;Latin America&quot; (in Spanish); and &quot;Colombia&quot; (in Spanish).

He continued to attend key meetings around the world and involved himself with a variety of campaign organisations by becoming President of the &quot;Climate Initiatives Fund&quot;, Richmond, London; a board member of the &quot;International Forum on Globalization&quot;, San Francisco, USA; a founder member of &quot;Marunui Conservation Ltd.&quot;, Mangawhai, New Zealand (1987); and a founder member and vice-president of ECOROPA, a European ecological club and think tank (1975).

* Neotribalism
* Perennial Philosophy

== Controversies ==
In 1997, after a political split with the editorial team of The Ecologist, Goldsmith was left to run the magazine on his own. Having been absent for some years, he brought in the International Society for Ecology and Culture (ISEC) to act as the editorial team. His nephew Zac, who was then working for ISEC, eventually took over the editorship on their behalf.

The split led to a period of often-bitter criticism from some members of the political left in the environmental movement, which, compounded with failing health, resulted in a period of isolation from the British scene.

Goldsmith was accused of having affiliated himself with the Nouvelle Droite, an intellectual voice of the European &quot;New Right&quot;, after addressing a symposium on Green issues organised in Paris by the GRECE (Research and Study Group on European Culture), a school of political thought founded largely on the works of Alain de Benoist. It was the attending of that and another similar event that had led to rising tensions with the editorial team at The Ecologist. The title of Goldsmith&#x27;s contribution in Paris being simply &quot;Une société écologique: la seule alternative&quot; (&quot;An Ecological Society: The Only Alternative&quot;).

Later, in a controversial article for the &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper, entitled &quot;Black Shirts in Green Trousers&quot;, George Monbiot (a cofounder of the left-wing political party Respect) accused Goldsmith of having &quot;advocated the enforced separation of Tutsis and Hutus in Rwanda and Protestants and Catholics in Ulster, on the grounds that they constitute &#x27;distinct ethnic groups&#x27; and are thus culturally incapable of co-habitation&quot; (a point rejected by Goldsmith). That, along with other attacks, eventually led Goldsmith to counter his critics with his indepth rebuttal &quot;My Answer&quot;.

Goldsmith&#x27;s close association with his brother, Sir James Goldsmith, his lifelong friendship with the controversial casino owner and conservationist John Aspinall, along with his anti-modernist stance and support for indigenous peoples, ensured that Goldsmith had many detractors throughout his life. Still, Goldsmith received affectionate support and respect from across the full spectrum of the environmental movement and from many of the people whose views and preoccupations were the focus of his theoretical and philosophical critique.

Goldsmith&#x27;s message continued to be sponsored around the world, in particular through his work with the International Forum on Globalization (IFG).

<doc id="1212766" wikidata="Q173038" url="?curid=1212766" title="Luigi Fagioli">
<text>Luigi Cristiano Fagioli (; 9 June 1898 – 20 June 1952) was an Italian racing driver, who competed in Grand Prix motor racing from 1928 to 1949, and Formula One from to . Nicknamed &quot;The [[Abruzzi]] Robber&quot;, Fagioli won the 1951 French Grand Prix with Alfa Romeo aged 53, and remains the oldest driver to win a Formula One Grand Prix. Fagioli was runner-up in the European Drivers&#x27; Championship in 1935 with Mercedes.

Fagioli is the only Formula One Grand Prix winner born in the 19th century, and the only Grand Prix racing driver to have won a championship race in both the AIACR European Championship and the World Drivers&#x27; Championship.

==Grand Prix racing==

Fagioli was born in the small town of Osimo, in the Marche region in central Italy. As a boy Fagioli was fascinated by the relatively new invention of the automobile and the ensuing, newly-born racing scene. Blessed with great natural driving instincts, the young Fagioli started racing hillclimbing and sports car before entering Grand Prix racing in 1926. In 1930 he was offered the opportunity to join the Maserati team. He soon established himself as a serious contender, winning the Coppa Ciano and the Circuit of Avellino Grand Prix. In April the following year, he went head to head with Louis Chiron and his Bugatti Type 51 at the Monaco Grand Prix. In what would go down as one of motorsport&#x27;s most famous battles, Chiron eventually took the chequered flag first but Fagioli received universal praise for the skill he displayed in racing a car set up for long stretches as opposed to the tight twists and short runs that characterize the street circuit of Monte Carlo. Fagioli avenged his defeat in Monaco a few weeks later by winning the Autodromo Nazionale Monza Grand Prix in Monza, Italy ahead of Chiron and fellow Italian drivers Achille Varzi and Tazio Nuvolari. In 1932, Fagioli won the Grand Prix of Rome driving for Maserati but for the 1933 season he signed with the Alfa Romeo team of Scuderia Ferrari. At the wheel of an Alfa Romeo P3, Fagioli ran a successful campaign, winning the Coppa Acerbo, the Grand Prix du Comminges, and the Italian Grand Prix. The win at Coppa Acerbo happened at the expense of Nuvolari, who was forced to retire with a mechanical failure while on the lead during the closing stages of the race. For this reason Fagioli became known as &quot;Il ladro degli Abruzzi&quot; (The Abruzzi Robber).

Fagioli&#x27;s confidence in his abilities would occasionally inform his fiery temper. One not to refrain from retaliating against other drivers when he felt they had done something wrong on the track, he would frequently take chances, and as such developed a somewhat controversial reputation after a string of significant crashes. In 1934 Mercedes, acknowledging Fagioli&#x27;s talent, hired him to drive one of their Silver Arrows alongside chief mechanic Hermann Lang. The relationship was successful although not without drama. In his very first outing for Mercedes, a furious Fagioli abandoned his car after team manager Alfred Neubauer ordered him to stay put in second place and let fellow Mercedes driver Manfred von Brauchitsch to win the race. Despite such bumpy start, Fagioli went on to win his second consecutive Coppa Acerbo and, together with Rudolf Caracciola in a Mercedes W25A, won his second straight Italian Grand Prix. Fagioli&#x27;s third win of the season came on the occasion of the Spanish Grand Prix at the Circuito Lasarte.

For the 1935 racing season, Fagioli&#x27;s factory Mercedes was upgraded to a W25B model. He won the Monaco Grand Prix, the AVUS and Penya Rhin Grand Prix. However, his relationship with the team soured after he displayed a blatant disregard for team orders by trying to take on Rudolf Caracciola on multiple occasions. 

Fagioli left Mercedes at the end of the 1936 season and joined Auto Union. No longer restricted by team politics, his rivalry with Caracciola escalated, culminating in a physical altercation between the two at the Tripoli Grand Prix. Towards the end of the season, a series of health problems, including crippling rheumatism, began to severely affect Fagioli&#x27;s racing ability. At the 1936 Coppa Acerbo, he could only walk with the aid of a cane and was forced to drop out of the race.

==Formula One==
By the end of World War II, Fagioli&#x27;s health had improved and at 52-year-old he joined Alfa-Romeo&#x27;s 1950 Formula One squad for the first ever FIA World Championship. Fagioli drove the 158/159 Alfetta, and managed to score five podium finishes in six races, entering the final round as one of three drivers in contention for the title. Giuseppe Farina eventually won the championship, with Juan-Manuel Fangio finishing second and Fagioli third. In 1951 Fagioli won the French Grand Prix with Juan-Manuel Fangio, earning the distinction of being the oldest person to ever win a Formula One race. During the race, the Alfa Romeo team manager ordered him to hand over his healthy car to Fangio while Fagioli would drive Fangio&#x27;s car, which was plagued with engine problems. This was common practice in Grand Prix racing before 1957 – Enzo Ferrari had done the same, ordering José Froilán González to hand over to the quicker and more experienced Alberto Ascari; Fagioli was allegedly so disappointed with this arrangement that he elected to retire from Formula One racing there and then.

==Final years==

For 1952, Fagioli signed with Lancia to drive sports cars. He finished in third place at the 1952 edition of the Mille Miglia ahead of arch rival Caracciola. 

==Death==
In June 1952, while practising for the Monaco Grand Prix, which was a sport cars event that year, Fagioli crashed during practice in the tunnel. His injuries, initially believed to be minor, worsened after a few days. Fagioli died in a Monte Carlo hospital three weeks later.

==Legacy==
Luigi Fagioli ranks as one of Italy&#x27;s greatest race car drivers. With the exception of the 1950 Monaco Grand Prix, where a pile-up on the opening lap involving seven cars forced him to retire, he managed to finish on the podium of every single Formula One race he entered. That gives him the second-highest percentage of podium finishes in the Formula One World Championship (85.71%), after &quot;one-time wonder&quot; Dorino Serafini who has a perfect 100%.

<doc id="1212792" wikidata="Q2252676" url="?curid=1212792" title="Pezzottaite">
<text>Pezzottaite, marketed under the name raspberyl or raspberry beryl, is a mineral species first recognized by the International Mineralogical Association in September 2003. Pezzottaite is a caesium analogue of beryl, a silicate of caesium, beryllium, lithium and aluminium, with the chemical formula Cs(Be2Li)Al2Si6O18. Named after Italian geologist and mineralogist Federico Pezzotta, pezzottaite was first thought to be either red beryl or a new variety of beryl (&quot;caesium beryl&quot;); unlike actual beryl, however, pezzottaite contains lithium and crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system rather than the hexagonal system.

== Appearance ==
Colors include shades of raspberry red to orange-red and pink. Recovered from miarolitic cavities in the granitic pegmatite fields of Fianarantsoa province, southern Madagascar, the pezzottaite crystals were small—no more than about in their widest dimension—and tabular or equant in habit, and few in number, most being heavily included with growth tubes and liquid feathers. Approximately 10 per cent of the rough material would also exhibit chatoyancy when polished. Most cut pezzottaite gems are under one carat (200 mg) in weight and rarely exceed two carats (400 mg).

== Physical and optical properties ==
With the exception of hardness (8 on Mohs scale), the physical and optical properties of pezzottaite—i.e., specific gravity 3.10 (average), refractive index 1.601 to 1.620, birefringence 0.008 to 0.011 (uniaxial negative)—are all higher than typical beryl. Pezzottiate is brittle with a conchoidal to irregular fracture, and streaks white. Like beryl, it has an imperfect to fair basal cleavage. Pleochroism is moderate, from pink-orange or purplish pink to pinkish purple. Pezzottaite&#x27;s absorption spectrum, as seen by a hand-held (direct vision) spectroscope, features a band at 485–500 nm with some specimens showing additional weak lines at 465 and 477 nm and a weak band at 550 to 580 nm.

== Deposits ==
The mineral was recovered from granitic pegmatite fields of Fianarantsoa province, southern Madagascar. Most (if not all) of the Madagascan deposits have since been exhausted. Pezzottaite has been found in at least one other locality, Afghanistan: this material was first thought to be caesium-rich morganite (pink beryl). Like morganite and red beryl, pezzottaite is believed to owe its color to radiation-induced color centres involving trivalent manganese. Pezzottaite will lose its color if heated to 450 °C for two hours, but the color can be restored with gamma irradiation.

<doc id="1212797" wikidata="Q459110" url="?curid=1212797" title="Burundi national football team">
<text>The Burundi national football team, (), nicknamed &quot;The Swallows&quot; (; ), represents Burundi in international football and is controlled by the Football Federation of Burundi. The team has never qualified for the World Cup. Burundi previously did come very close to qualifying for the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations, losing only on penalties to Guinea in a playoff. However, in 2019, it qualified for the first time in a major tournament, and took part in the Africa Cup of Nations finals in Group B, but lost all its matches and left from the group stage without scoring a single goal.

==History==
===Difficult beginnings (1974–1992)===
The Burundi football team was created in 1971 by the Football Federation of Burundi. The Swallows&#x27; first match was in a 1976 African Cup of Nations qualification match against Somalia, which ended in a 2–0 victory. Following a 1–0 loss in the second leg, Burundi qualified to meet Egypt in the next round where they lost 5–0 on aggregate and were eliminated. It would be seventeen years before Burundi played another AFCON qualifying match. In their first twenty years, Burundi played in twenty fixtures and managed 6 wins, 2 draws and 12 defeats.

===Narrowly missing qualification (1992–1998)===
In 1992, Burundi entered the qualification rounds for the FIFA World Cup for the first time, but were eliminated in the first round following one win (1–0 against Ghana), one draw (0–0 against Algeria) and two losses in the reverse fixtures to finish bottom of the group. Burundi then finished joint top in their 1994 African Cup of Nations qualification group however they lost their play-off match against Guinea on penalties. Due to the Burundian Civil War, Burundi withdrew from the 1996 and 1998 AFCON qualifiers and, despite beating Sierra Leone 2–0 on aggregate and qualifying for the final round of the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, they withdrew again.

===African Cup of Nations qualifiers (2000–2015)===
Following successive withdrawals from the AFCON qualifiers, Burundi returned for the 2000 competition, beating Tanzania in the preliminary rounds before finishing third in their group behind Burkina Faso and Senegal. In the 2002 qualifiers, Burundi again advanced to the group stages of qualification by beating Djibouti (4–1), but finished last in their group with only two points. In 2004, Burundi performed even worse, collecting no points and finishing last behind South Africa and Ivory Coast. In 2008 Burundi finished five points behind leaders Egypt and didn&#x27;t make it through to the next round. In 2012 Burundi were even further adrift, finishing thirteen points behind group winners Ivory Coast. For the 2013 qualifiers, Burundi failed to advance due to away goals against Zimbabwe (2–2), and in 2015 they lost to Botswana (1–0) .

===FIFA World Cup qualifiers (2002–2014)===
Burundi did not participate in the 2002 qualification process but re-entered in 2006, only to get knocked out by Gabon in the first round (4–1). In 2010, Burundi managed two victories, both against Seychelles but failed to go through behind Burkina Faso and Tunisia. The 2006 and 2010 qualifiers doubled as qualification for the FIFA World Cup and Africa Cup of Nations. The following qualification cycle, Burundi were eliminated by Lesotho in the first round (3–2).

===First CAN qualification (2017–present)===

After falling in the second qualifying round for the 2018 FIFA World Cup against DR Congo, Burundi focused on convincing Gaël Bigirimana and Saido Berahino to come and play for the selection, both playing in Europe (for Hibernian and Stoke City respectively). Both players agreed and Berahino scored on his debut to earn the team a 1–1 draw against Gabon. In March 2019, in the final group game, Burundi played a decisive match against Gabon needing only one point to qualify. The match ended in a draw (1–1), with a goal from Cédric Amissi earning Burundi their first opportunity to play in the Africa Cup of Nations. Burundi lost all three of their matches at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, failing to register a single goal.

==Team image==
===Colours===
Traditionally, the Burundi team wears the three colours of its flag: red, green and white.

===Sponsors===
During these beginnings, Burundi is equipped by Erreà, an Italian sports brand. In 2012, he signed a contract with Adidas for a period of 10 years. Despite this long-term contract with Adidas, Burundi is committed in 2018 with Nike. She even signs a contract with Lumitel (a phone brand).

===Stadium===
The Burundi team have played most of their matches in Bujumbura at the Intwari Stadium. The second match in its history, Burundi is playing its first home match against Somalia (3–0 victory). The Prince Louis Rwagasore stadium is home to Vital&#x27;O FC and Prince Louis FC, as well as the national team. The stadium has been renovated several times, notably in March 2018, due to a flooded pitch.

===Supporters===
During the matches at the Prince Louis Rwagasore stadium, the Burundian supporters are often outnumbered, in particular because of the rather low capacity of the stadium (10,000 seats) for around 13,000 spectators. Just like the players, the supporters dress in red, green and white and bring the flag of the country. During the match in March 2019 against Gabon, the authorities have made additional seats available because of the lack of space in the stands.

<doc id="1212798" wikidata="Q8018306" url="?curid=1212798" title="Reputation of William Shakespeare">
<text>In his own time, William Shakespeare (1564–1616) was rated as merely one among many talented playwrights and poets, but since the late 17th century has been considered the supreme playwright and poet of the English language.

Shakespeare&#x27;s plays remain enormously popular across the world stage, with the plays often being drastically adapted in performance. During the 18th and 19th centuries, to be a star on the British stage was synonymous with being a great Shakespearean actor. Then the emphasis was placed on the soliloquies as declamatory turns at the expense of pace and action, and Shakespeare&#x27;s plays seemed in peril of disappearing beneath the added music, scenery, and special effects produced by thunder, lightning, and wave machines.

Editors and critics of the plays, disdaining the showiness and melodrama of Shakespearean stage representation, began to focus on Shakespeare as a dramatic poet, to be studied on the printed page rather than in the theatre. The rift between Shakespeare on the stage and Shakespeare on the page was at its widest in the early 19th century, at a time when both forms of Shakespeare were hitting peaks of fame and popularity: theatrical Shakespeare was successful spectacle and melodrama for the masses, while book or closet drama Shakespeare was being elevated by the reverential commentary of the Romantics into unique poetic genius, prophet, and bard. Before the Romantics, Shakespeare was simply the most admired of all dramatic poets, especially for his insight into human nature and his realism, but Romantic critics such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge refactored him into an object of almost religious adoration, George Bernard Shaw coining the term &quot;bardolatry&quot; to describe it. To the later 19th century, Shakespeare became in addition an emblem of national pride, the crown jewel of English culture, and a &quot;rallying-sign&quot;, as Thomas Carlyle wrote in 1841, for the whole British Empire.

==17th century==
===Jacobean and Caroline===
It is difficult to assess Shakespeare&#x27;s reputation in his own lifetime and shortly after. England had little modern literature before the 1570s, and detailed critical commentaries on modern authors did not begin to appear until the reign of Charles I. The facts about his reputation can be surmised from fragmentary evidence. He was included in some contemporary lists of leading poets, but he seems to have lacked the stature of the aristocratic Philip Sidney, who became a cult figure due to his death in battle at a young age, or of Edmund Spenser. Shakespeare&#x27;s poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays; but Shakespeare&#x27;s plays were written for performance by his own company, and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays, Shakespeare&#x27;s troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed. That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market, and the regular patronage of his company by the court, culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the &quot;King&#x27;s Men,&quot; suggests his popularity among higher stations of society. Modern plays (as opposed to those in Latin and Greek) were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries. Some of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, particularly the history plays, were reprinted frequently in cheap quarto (i.e. pamphlet) form; others took decades to reach a 3rd edition.

After Ben Jonson pioneered the canonisation of modern plays by printing his own works in folio (the luxury book format) in 1616, Shakespeare was the next playwright to be honoured by a folio collection, in 1623. That this folio went into another edition within 9 years indicates he was held in unusually high regard for a playwright. The dedicatory poems by Ben Jonson and John Milton in the 2nd folio were the first to suggest Shakespeare was the supreme English poet of his age. These expensive reading editions are the first visible sign of a rift between Shakespeare on the stage and Shakespeare for readers, a rift that was to widen over the next two centuries. In his 1630 work &#x27;Timber&#x27; or &#x27;Discoveries&#x27;, Ben Jonson praised the speed and ease with which Shakespeare wrote his plays as well as his contemporary&#x27;s honesty and gentleness towards others.

===Interregnum and Restoration===

During the Interregnum (1642–1660), all public stage performances were banned by the Puritan rulers. Though denied the use of the stage, costumes and scenery, actors still managed to ply their trade by performing &quot;drolls&quot; or short pieces of larger plays that usually ended with some type of jig. Shakespeare was among the many playwrights whose works were plundered for these scenes. Among the most common scenes were Bottom&#x27;s scenes from &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and the gravedigger&#x27;s scene from &quot;Hamlet&quot;. When the theatres opened again in 1660 after this uniquely long and sharp break in British theatrical history, two newly licensed London theatre companies, the Duke&#x27;s and the King&#x27;s Company, started business with a scramble for performance rights to old plays. Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and the Beaumont and Fletcher team were among the most valuable properties and remained popular after Restoration playwriting had gained momentum.
In the elaborate Restoration London playhouses, designed by Christopher Wren, Shakespeare&#x27;s plays were staged with music, dancing, thunder, lightning, wave machines, and fireworks. The texts were &quot;reformed&quot; and &quot;improved&quot; for the stage. A notorious example is Irish poet Nahum Tate&#x27;s happy-ending &quot;King Lear&quot; (1681) (which held the stage until 1838), while &quot;The Tempest&quot; was turned into an opera replete with special effects by William Davenant. In fact, as the director of the Duke&#x27;s Company, Davenant was legally obliged to reform and modernize Shakespeare&#x27;s plays before performing them, an ad hoc ruling by the Lord Chamberlain in the battle for performance rights which &quot;sheds an interesting light on the many 20th-century denunciations of Davenant for his adaptations&quot;. The modern view of the Restoration stage as the epitome of Shakespeare abuse and bad taste has been shown by Hume to be exaggerated, and both scenery and adaptation became more reckless in the 18th and 19th centuries.

The incomplete Restoration stage records suggest Shakespeare, although always a major repertory author, was bested in the 1660–1700 period by the phenomenal popularity of Beaumont and Fletcher. &quot;Their plays are now the most pleasant and frequent entertainments of the stage&quot;, reported fellow playwright John Dryden in 1668, &quot;two of theirs being acted through the year for one of Shakespeare&#x27;s or Jonson&#x27;s.&quot; In the early 18th century, however, Shakespeare took over the lead on the London stage from Beaumont and Fletcher, never to relinquish it again.

By contrast to the stage history, in literary criticism there was no lag time, no temporary preference for other dramatists: Shakespeare had a unique position at least from the Restoration in 1660 and onwards. While Shakespeare did not follow the unbending French neo-classical &quot;rules&quot; for the drama and the three classical unities of time, place, and action, those strict rules had never caught on in England, and their sole zealous proponent, Thomas Rymer, was hardly ever mentioned by influential writers except as an example of narrow dogmatism. Dryden, for example, argued in his influential &quot;Essay of Dramatick Poesie&quot; (1668) – the same essay in which he noted that Shakespeare&#x27;s plays were performed only half as often as those of Beaumont and Fletcher – for Shakespeare&#x27;s artistic superiority. Though Shakespeare does not follow the dramatic conventions, Dryden wrote, Ben Jonson does, and as a result Jonson lands in a distant second place to &quot;the incomparable Shakespeare.&quot;

==18th century==

===Britain===
In the 18th century, Shakespeare dominated the London stage, while Shakespeare productions turned increasingly into the creation of star turns for star actors. After the Licensing Act 1737, a quarter of plays performed were by Shakespeare, and on at least two occasions rival London playhouses staged the very same Shakespeare play at the same time (&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in 1755 and &quot;King Lear&quot; the next year) and still commanded audiences. This occasion was a striking example of the growing prominence of Shakespeare stars in the theatrical culture, the big attraction being the competition and rivalry between the male leads at Covent Garden and Drury Lane, Spranger Barry and David Garrick. There appear to have been no issues with Barry and Garrick, in their late thirties, playing adolescent Romeo one season and geriatric King Lear the next. In September 1769 Garrick staged a major Shakespeare Jubilee in Stratford-upon-Avon, which was a major influence on the rise of bardolatry. It was at the Shakespeare Jubilee that Garrick thanked the Shakespeare Ladies Club for saving Shakespeare from obscurity: &quot;It was You Ladies that restor&#x27;d Shakespeare to the Stage you form&#x27;d yourselves into a Society to protect his Fame, and Erected a Monument to his and your own honour in Westminster Abbey.&quot;
As performance playscripts diverged increasingly from their originals, the publication of texts intended for reading developed rapidly in the opposite direction, with the invention of textual criticism and an emphasis on fidelity to Shakespeare&#x27;s original words. The texts that are being read and performed today were largely settled in the 18th century. Nahum Tate and Nathaniel Lee had already prepared editions and performed scene divisions in the late 17th century, and Nicholas Rowe&#x27;s edition of 1709 is considered the first truly scholarly text for the plays. It was followed by many good 18th century editions, crowned by Edmund Malone&#x27;s landmark &quot;Variorum Edition&quot;, which was published posthumously in 1821 and remains the basis of modern editions. These collected editions were meant for reading, not staging; Rowe&#x27;s 1709 edition was, compared to the old folios, a light pocketbook. Shakespeare criticism also increasingly spoke to readers, rather than to theatre audiences.

The only aspects of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays that were consistently disliked and singled out for criticism in the 18th century were the puns (&quot;clenches&quot;) and the &quot;low&quot; (sexual) allusions. While a few editors, notably Alexander Pope, attempted to gloss over or remove the puns and the double entendres, this was quickly reversed, and by mid-century the puns and sexual humour were (with only a few exceptions, notably Thomas Bowdler) restored permanently.

Dryden&#x27;s sentiments about Shakespeare&#x27;s imagination and capacity for painting &quot;nature&quot; were echoed in the 18th century by, for example, Joseph Addison (&quot;Among the English, Shakespeare has incomparably excelled all others&quot;), Alexander Pope (&quot;every single character in Shakespeare is as much an Individual as those in Life itself&quot;), and Samuel Johnson (who scornfully dismissed Voltaire&#x27;s and Rhymer&#x27;s neoclassical Shakespeare criticism as &quot;the petty cavils of petty minds&quot;). The long-lived belief that the Romantics were the first generation to truly appreciate Shakespeare and to prefer him to Ben Jonson is contradicted by praise from writers throughout the 18th century. Ideas about Shakespeare that many people think of as typically post-Romantic were frequently expressed in the 18th and even in the 17th century: he was described as a genius who needed no learning, as deeply original, and as creating uniquely &quot;real&quot; and individual characters (see Timeline of Shakespeare criticism). To compare Shakespeare and his well-educated contemporary Ben Jonson was a popular exercise at this time, a comparison that was invariably complimentary to Shakespeare. It functioned to highlight the special qualities of both writers, and it especially powered the assertion that natural genius trumps rules, that &quot;there is always an appeal open from criticism to nature&quot; (Samuel Johnson).

Opinion of Shakespeare was briefly shaped in the 1790s by the &quot;discovery&quot; of the Shakespeare Papers by William Henry Ireland. Ireland claimed to have found in a trunk a goldmine of lost documents of Shakespeare&#x27;s including two plays, &quot;Vortigern and Rowena&quot; and &quot;Henry II&quot;. These documents appeared to demonstrate a number of unknown facts about Shakespeare that shaped opinion of his works, including a Profession of Faith demonstrating Shakespeare was a Protestant and that he had an illegitimate child. Although there were many believers in the provenance of the Papers, they soon came under fierce attack from scholars who pointed out their numerous inaccuracies. &quot;Vortigern&quot; had only one performance at the Drury Lane Theatre before Ireland admitted he had forged the documents and written the plays himself.

===In Germany===
English actors started visiting the Holy Roman Empire in the late 16th century to work as &quot;fiddlers, singers and jugglers&quot;, and through them the work of Shakespeare had first become known in the &quot;Reich&quot;. In 1601, in the Free City of Danzig (modern Gdańsk, Poland), which had a large English merchant colony living within its walls, a company of English actors arrived to put on plays by Shakespeare. By 1610, the actors were performing Shakespeare in German as his plays had become popular in Danzig. Some of Shakespeare&#x27;s work was performed in continental Europe during the 17th century, but it was not until the mid-18th century that it became widely known. In Germany Lessing compared Shakespeare to German folk literature. In France, the Aristotelian rules were rigidly obeyed, and in Germany, a land where French cultural influence was very strong (German elites preferred to speak French rather than German in the 18th century), the Francophile German theatre critics had long denounced Shakespeare&#x27;s work as a &quot;jumble&quot; that violated all the Aristotelian rules.

As a part of an effort to get the German public to take Shakespeare more seriously, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe organised a Shakespeare jubilee in Frankfurt in 1771, stating in a speech on 14 October 1771 that the dramatist had shown that the Aristotelian unities were &quot;as oppressive as a prison&quot; and were &quot;burdensome fetters on our imagination&quot;. Goethe praised Shakespeare for liberating his mind from the rigid Aristotelian rules, saying: &quot;I jumped into the free air, and suddenly felt I had hands and feet...Shakespeare, my friend, if you were with us today, I could only live with you&quot;. Herder likewise proclaimed that reading Shakespeare&#x27;s work opens &quot;leaves from the book of events, of providence, of the world, blowing in the sands of time&quot;.

This claim that Shakespeare&#x27;s work breaks through all creative boundaries to reveal a chaotic, teeming, contradictory world became characteristic of Romantic criticism, later expressed by Victor Hugo in the preface to his play &quot;Cromwell&quot;, in which he lauded Shakespeare as an artist of the grotesque, a genre in which the tragic, absurd, trivial and serious were inseparably intertwined. In 1995, the American journalist Stephen Kinzer writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed: &quot;Shakespeare is an all-but-guaranteed success in Germany, where his work has enjoyed immense popularity for more than 200 years. By some estimates, Shakespeare&#x27;s plays are performed more frequently in Germany than anywhere else in the world, not excluding his native England. The market for his work, both in English and in German translation, seems inexhaustible.&quot; The German critic Ernst Osterkamp wrote: &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s importance to German literature cannot be compared with that of any other writer of the post-antiquity period. Neither Dante or Cervantes, neither Moliere or Ibsen have even approached his influence here. With the passage of time, Shakespeare has virtually become one of Germany&#x27;s national authors.&quot;

===In Russia===
Shakespeare, as far as can be established, never went any further from Stratford-upon-Avon than London, but he made a reference to the visit of Russian diplomats from the court of Tsar Ivan the Terrible to the court of Elizabeth I in &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; in which the French aristocrats dress up as Russians and make fools of themselves. Shakespeare was first translated into Russian by Alexander Sumarokov, who called Shakespeare an &quot;inspired barbarian&quot;, who wrote of the Bard of Avon that in his plays &quot;there is much that is bad and exceedingly good&quot;. In 1786, Shakespeare&#x27;s reputation in Russia was greatly enhanced when the Empress Catherine the Great translated a French version of &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; into Russian (Catherine did not know English) and had it staged in St. Petersburg. Shortly afterwards, Catherine translated &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; from French into Russian. The patronage of Catherine made Shakespeare an eminently respectable author in Russia, but his plays were rarely performed until the 19th century, and instead he was widely read.

=== In France ===
Shakespeare and his works began to circulate in France from the beginning of the 18th century. Until this moment, the most admired English poets were Alexander Pope, John Milton, James Thomson and Thomas Gray and their texts had already been translated into French.

In the first half of the century, French intellectuals who had visited or sojourned in England for a period of time and, therefore, had had the opportunity to see theatrical representations of English plays, began to express their opinions and judgments on Shakespeare and his theatre.

Voltaire was a prominent figure in this debate. In &quot;Essai sur la poésie épique&quot; (1728), he declared himself to be an admirer of the English theatre, especially of its tragedies, which he considered to be superior to all the other genres brought to the English stage. Voltaire&#x27;s appreciation for the English theatre was so sincere that he tried to import some of its characteristics into France. The adoption of such features was not immediate or easy. In &quot;Discours sur la tragédie&quot; (1731), Voltaire had analysed all the rules that had to be categorically respected in French theatres, all the events that could be represented and those that were absolutely forbidden. As a result, «la delicatesse», la «bienséance» e la «coutume» dominated the French plays and they constituted an obstacle to the introduction of any innovation. Such mutations were scarcely appreciated by the playwrights, actors and audiences. Voltaire showed his will to partly abandon such conventions, mainly because they were an impediment for the realisation of some scenes he was working on, firstly the death of Julius Caesar. The main impediment for this scene was the rule that in French tragedies, characters could commit suicide, but not murder. Voltaire fought to change this convention, supporting his thesis with examples from Ancient Greek theatre and the contemporary English theatre, where assassinations were regularly represented on stage. However, Voltaire also stated that English tragedies could turn into « un lieu de carnage». What he wanted to achieve was a compromise between tradition and innovation.

Eventually, innovations infiltrated into French theatre and when Voltaire presented &quot;La Mort de Cèsar&quot; to his audience in 1743, he was able to represent Caesar&#x27;s death as he had originally imagined it.

Voltaire also lamented that no one among his fellow countrymen had tried to translate Shakespeare. He personally translated the speech of Brutus in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, becoming the first Frenchman to translate a passage from a Shakespearean play. His translation was included in &quot;Discours sur la tragedie&quot;, published in 1730. Some years later, he translated Hamlet&#x27;s monologue, which was published in &quot;Les Lettres philosophiques&quot; (1734). Shakespeare&#x27;s popularity steadily increased during the century and others tested themselves with translating the Bard. The appearance of numerous translations points out a change in the taste of French playwrights and audiences.

In 1746 Pierre-Antoine de La Place published eight volumes containing summaries of every Shakespearean play and partial translations of some of them. Between 1776 and 1782 Pierre Letourner translated the complete corpus of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. His work also included comments on Shakespeare, particularly on his ability to depict human emotions and make characters talk in a language close to that used in everyday life. Letourner&#x27;s translations do not lack errors, but his work was fundamental in spreading the knowledge of Shakespeare and the English theatre in France.

=== In Italy ===
Shakespeare remained almost unknown in Italy until the beginning of the 18th century. The most translated and admired English poets were Alexander Pope, John Milton, Thomas Gray and James Thomson.
The knowledge of Shakespeare spread in the peninsula in two different ways. On one hand, Italian intellectuals who sojourned for a period of time in England had the possibility to witness theatrical representations and to write about their experiences; their texts, then, travelled back to Italy. On the other hand, many English people travelled to Italy in the 18th century, since it was one of the many destinations on the Grand Tour. The occasions for interactions between English and Italian people were numerous. Moreover, English people who migrated or were banished from England, often chose Italy as their new home.
However, many French translations and adaptations of Shakespearean plays began to circulate in Europe in this period, and the majority of Italian writers started to read Shakespeare in French. Few people knew English and dictionaries were not widely available. For Italians, their first approach towards English plays was often through French renditions and, even though they presented substantial differences from the originals, they introduced the knowledge of English theatre and its rules into Italy. One of the most famous and most-read French adaptations was &quot;La mort de César&quot; by Voltaire, based on &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; by Shakespeare. Shakespearean plays began to be staged in Italian theatres in the second half of the century, and they were nearly always adaptations or rewrites.

In 1705, Apostolo Zeno wrote &quot;Ambleto&quot;, which was staged in Venice the following year. Ambleto was not a translation of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, not even an adaptation. The only similarity with &quot;Hamlet&quot; was its source of inspiration, and it has now been verified that the author did not know Shakespeare. The production was so successful that it was brought to the stage of the Haymarket Theatre in London in 1712. The play was staged again in Italy in 1750, but it had not been influenced by the Shakespearean &quot;Hamlet&quot;. As a matter of fact, it was identical to the first version of 1706. This is a signal of how there was no real interest for the English theatre and its characteristics in Italy, yet.

The first Italian melodrama which was inspired by a tragedy by Shakespeare dates to 1789: &quot;Amleto&quot; by Gimbattista Zanchi. He, however, worked with the help of a French rendition. It is possible, then, that he did not know the original version of the tragedy.
The only melodrama which took inspiration directly from an original work by Shakespeare was &quot;Rosalinda&quot; (1744) by Paolo Rolli. His source of inspiration was &quot;As you like it&quot; and it was the only theatrical production that took inspiration from a Shakespearean comedy instead of a tragedy.

From the beginning of the century, however, some intellectuals attempted to translate some passages from Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, even if these were often via French translations. Antonio Conti lived in London from 1715 to 1718 and he composed two tragedies during his sojourn: &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and &quot;Marcus Brutus&quot;, both inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;. In the preface to the tragedies, Conti praised Shakespeare and expressed his surprise at the fact that no Italian writer had attempted a translation of the Bard sooner. He also noted how Shakespeare did not respect the Aristotelian units. Italian playwrights, on the other hand, were still observing these principles and Conti was no exception. Therefore, the action of his tragedies takes place in one location and it only lasts a few hours.

In 1729, Paolo Rolli published an Italian translation of the first six books of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. In the preface, he praised Shakespeare and compared him to Dante. In 1739 he published a translation of one of Hamlet&#x27;s monologues.

The first complete Italian translation of a Shakespearean tragedy was &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; by Domenico Valentini, printed in 1756. Valentini used the English edition of the tragedy printed in 1733 by Lewis Theobald for his translation. In his preface, he stated that he did not understand English, therefore, he asked for the help of some knights, whose identity is still unknown. It is probable that they were English knights who were visiting Siena as part of The Grand Tour. It was common for Italian and English people to meet in social and cultural gatherings. This is probably how Valentini met them and asked them to assist him in the process of translation.

Other intellectuals worked on Shakespeare towards the end of the century. Giuseppe Baretti published &quot;Discours sur Shakespeare et M.r de Voltaire&quot; in 1777; Alessandro Verri translated &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Othello&quot; between 1769 and 1777; Francesco Algarotti, who did not appreciate English theatre, changed his mind when he saw a representation of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; in London. He also translated the passages he thought were the most salient in Brutus&#x27;s speech. Giustina Renier Michiel translated &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Coriolanus&quot; between 1798 and 1801. It is still uncertain whether she worked alone. Letters exchanged with Cesarotti lead scholars to think that she may have been helped by another Italian writer. It is also possible that she worked alone, using a French rendition to help with the translations. The question is still unsolved.

=== In Spain ===
The knowledge of Shakespeare and his works in European countries, including Spain, arrived centuries after his death and not always easily. 
While it is possible that some Shakespeare plays may have arrived in Spain as soon as the end of the 16th century and the first half of the 17th century, the earliest documented example of a work of Shakespeare&#x27;s in Spain is The Two Noble Kinsmen, circa 1640. But the first editions to reach Spain were in recusant libraries and did not have an impact on playwrights and play-goers in Spain.

There is weak evidence that a First Folio and strong evidence that Second Folio containing historical dramas arrived in the country after 1632, the year in which the latter was published in England. There is also evidence of a third Folio imported in Spain in 1742 but it is now lost. However, these editions alone were not sufficient to spark the interest of Spanish writers and critics. Shakespeare&#x27;s works began to be read by a larger number of intellectuals in the 18th century; however, Shakespeare did not arrive to Spain in his original language, but he began to be studied thanks to French adaptations and rewritings. Spanish scholars rarely read Shakespeare in English.

The arrival of Shakespeare in the country brought with it the debate on theatre, its rules, its virtues and vices. The classical rules of Spanish, French and Italian theatre, derived from the classical theatre, were often an obstacle for the introduction of innovations coming from different theatrical traditions. English theatre, for instance, did not respect classical rules. This provoked admiration but, at the same time, rejection for Shakespeare and his works: on one hand his imagination was admired but on the other he used too many features that did not find their place in the Spanish tradition. Those critics who expressed their judgment on the Bard in the 18th century judged him from a classical perspective and since he did not comply with the classical rules of theatre, he was not worth of appreciation. As a consequence, his works began to be translated only at the end of the 18th century. The first Spanish translation of Shakespeare dates to 1798, when Leandro Fernandéz de Moratìn translated &quot;Hamlet&quot;. However, the first tragedy to be translated directly from the original English version, without the mediation of a French text, dates to 1838 and it was &quot;Macbeth&quot; translated by José García de Villalta. Shakespearean plays began to be represented in Spanish theatres only at the beginning of the 19th century but they were often neoclassic adaptations derived from French rewritings. Between 1808 and 1817 &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot; were brought to the stage. Shakespeare began to be appreciated more with the advent of Romanticism.
==19th century==

===Shakespeare in performance===
 Theatres and theatrical scenery became ever more elaborate in the 19th century, and the acting editions used were progressively cut and restructured to emphasise more and more the soliloquies and the stars, at the expense of pace and action. Performances were further slowed by the need for frequent pauses to change the scenery, creating a perceived need for even more cuts to keep performance length within tolerable limits; it became a generally accepted maxim that Shakespeare&#x27;s plays were too long to be performed without substantial cuts. The platform, or apron, stage, on which actors of the 17th century would come forward for audience contact, was gone, and the actors stayed permanently behind the fourth wall or proscenium arch, further separated from the audience by the orchestra, see image right.

Through the 19th century, a roll call of legendary actors&#x27; names all but drown out the plays in which they appear: Sarah Siddons (1755–1831), John Philip Kemble (1757–1823), Henry Irving (1838–1905), and Ellen Terry (1847–1928). To be a star of the legitimate drama came to mean being first and foremost a &quot;great Shakespeare actor,&quot; with a famous interpretation of, for men, Hamlet, and for women, Lady Macbeth, and especially with a striking delivery of the great soliloquies. The acme of spectacle, star, and soliloquy Shakespeare performance came with the reign of actor-manager Henry Irving at the Royal Lyceum Theatre in London from 1878 to 1899. At the same time, a revolutionary return to the roots of Shakespeare&#x27;s original texts, and to the platform stage, absence of scenery, and fluid scene changes of the Elizabethan theatre, was being effected by William Poel&#x27;s Elizabethan Stage Society.

===Shakespeare in criticism===

The belief in the unappreciated 18th-century Shakespeare was proposed at the beginning of the 19th century by the Romantics, in support of their view of 18th-century literary criticism as mean, formal, and rule-bound, which was contrasted with their own reverence for the poet as prophet and genius. Such ideas were most fully expressed by German critics such as Goethe and the Schlegel brothers. Romantic critics such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Hazlitt raised admiration for Shakespeare to worship or even &quot;bardolatry&quot; (a sarcastic coinage from bard + idolatry by George Bernard Shaw in 1901, meaning excessive or religious worship of Shakespeare). To compare him to other Renaissance playwrights at all, even for the purpose of finding him superior, began to seem irreverent. Shakespeare was rather to be studied without any involvement of the critical faculty, to be addressed or apostrophised—almost prayed to—by his worshippers, as in Thomas De Quincey&#x27;s classic essay &quot;On the Knocking at the Gate in &quot;Macbeth&quot;&quot; (1823): &quot;O, mighty poet! Thy works are not as those of other men, simply and merely great works of art; but are also like the phenomena of nature, like the sun and the sea, the stars and the flowers,—like frost and snow, rain and dew, hail-storm and thunder, which are to be studied with entire submission of our own faculties...&quot;.

As the concept of literary originality grew in importance, critics were horrified at the idea of adapting Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedies for the stage by putting happy endings on them, or editing out the puns in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. In another way, what happened on the stage was seen as unimportant, as the Romantics, themselves writers of closet drama, considered Shakespeare altogether more suitable for reading than staging. Charles Lamb saw any form of stage representation as distracting from the true qualities of the text. This view, argued as a timeless truth, was also a natural consequence of the dominance of melodrama and spectacle on the early 19th-century stage.

Shakespeare became an important emblem of national pride in the 19th century, which was the heyday of the British Empire and the acme of British power in the world. To Thomas Carlyle in &quot;On Heroes, Hero-Worship, &amp; the Heroic in History&quot; (1841), Shakespeare was one of the great poet-heroes of history, in the sense of being a &quot;rallying-sign&quot; for British cultural patriotism all over the world, including even the lost American colonies: &quot;From Paramatta, from New York, wheresoever... English men and women are, they will say to one another, &#x27;Yes, this Shakespeare is ours; we produced him, we speak and think by him; we are of one blood and kind with him&#x27;&quot; (&quot;The Hero as a Poet&quot;). As the foremost of the great canonical writers, the jewel of English culture, and as Carlyle puts it, &quot;merely as a real, marketable, tangibly useful possession&quot;, Shakespeare became in the 19th century a means of creating a common heritage for the motherland and all her colonies. Post-colonial literary critics have had much to say of this use of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays in what they regard as a move to subordinate and uproot the cultures of the colonies themselves.

Across the North Sea, Shakespeare remained influential in Germany. In 1807, August Wilhelm Schlegel translated all of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays into German, and such was the popularity of Schlegel&#x27;s translation (which is generally regarded as one of the best translations of Shakespeare into any language), that German nationalists were soon starting to claim that Shakespeare was actually a German playwright who had just written his plays in English. By the middle of the 19th century, Shakespeare had been incorporated into the pantheon of German literature. In 1904, a statue of Shakespeare was erected in Weimar, showing the Bard of Avon staring into the distance, becoming the first statue built to honor Shakespeare on the mainland of Europe.

===Romantic icon in Russia===
In the Romantic age, Shakespeare became extremely popular in Russia. Vissarion Belinsky wrote he had been &quot;enslaved by the drama of Shakespeare&quot;. Russia&#x27;s national poet, Alexander Pushkin, was heavily influenced by &quot;Hamlet&quot; and the history plays, and his novel &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; showed strong Shakespearean influences. Later on, in the 19th century, the novelist Ivan Turgenev often wrote essays on Shakespeare with the best known being &quot;Hamlet and Don Quixote&quot;. Fyodor Dostoevsky was greatly influenced by &quot;Macbeth&quot; with his novel &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; showing Shakespearean influence in his treatment of the theme of guilt. From the 1840s onward, Shakespeare was regularly staged in Russia, and the black American actor Ira Aldridge, who had been barred from the stage in the United States on the account of his skin color, became the leading Shakespearean actor in Russia in the 1850s, being decorated by the Emperor Alexander II for his work in portraying Shakespearean characters.

==20th century==
Shakespeare continued to be held in extraordinarily high regard throughout the 20th century. Many Western educational systems required the textual study of two or more of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, and both amateur and professional stagings of Shakespeare were commonplace. It was the proliferation of high-quality, well-annotated texts and the unrivalled reputation of Shakespeare that allowed for stagings of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays to remain textually faithful, but with an extraordinary variety in setting, stage direction, and costuming. Institutions such as the Folger Shakespeare Library in the United States worked to ensure constant, serious study of Shakespearean texts, and the Royal Shakespeare Company in the United Kingdom worked to maintain a yearly staging of at least two plays.

Shakespeare performances reflected the tensions of the times, and early in the 20th century, Barry Jackson of the Birmingham Repertory Theatre began the staging of modern-dress productions, thus starting a new trend in Shakespearean production. Performances of the plays could be highly interpretive. Thus, play directors would emphasise Marxist, feminist, or, perhaps most popularly, Freudian psychoanalytical interpretations of the plays, even as they retained letter-perfect scripts. The number of analytical approaches became more diverse by the latter part of the century, as critics applied theories such as structuralism, New Historicism, Cultural materialism, African American studies, queer studies, and literary semiotics to Shakespeare&#x27;s works.

===In the Third Reich===

In 1934 the French government dismissed the director of the Comédie Française over a controversial production of &quot;Coriolanus&quot; that had been the occasion for right-wing violence, amidst the Stavisky affair. In the international protests that followed, came one from Germany, from none other than Joseph Goebbels. Although productions of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays in Germany itself were subject to &#x27;streamlining&#x27;, he continued to be favoured as a great classical dramatist, especially so as almost every new German play since the late 1890s onwards was portrayed by German government propaganda as the work of left-wingers, of Jews or of &quot;degenerates&quot; of one kind or another. Politically acceptable writers had simply been unable to fill the gap, or had only been able to do so through producing propaganda. In 1935, Goebbels was to say &quot;We can build autobahns, revive the economy, create a new army, but we... cannot manufacture new dramatists.&quot; With Schiller suspect for his radicalism, Lessing for his humanism and even Goethe for his lack of patriotism, the legacy of the &quot;Aryan&quot; Shakespeare was reinterpreted for new purposes.

Rodney Symington, Professor of Germanic and Russian Studies at the University of Victoria, Canada, deals with this question in &quot;The Nazi Appropriation of Shakespeare: Cultural Politics in the Third Reich&quot; (Edwin Mellen Press, 2005). The scholar reports that Hamlet, for instance, was reconceived as a proto-German warrior rather than a man with a conscience. Of this play, one critic wrote: &quot;If the courtier Laertes is drawn to Paris and the humanist Horatio seems more Roman than Danish, it is surely no accident that Hamlet&#x27;s alma mater should be Wittenberg.&quot; A leading magazine declared that the crime which deprived Hamlet of his inheritance was a foreshadowing of the Treaty of Versailles, and that the conduct of Gertrude was reminiscent of the &quot;spineless&quot; Weimar politicians.

Weeks after Hitler took power in 1933, an official party publication appeared, entitled &quot;Shakespeare – a Germanic Writer&quot;, a counter to those who wanted to ban all foreign influences. At the Propaganda Ministry, Rainer Schlosser, given charge of German theatre by Goebbels, mused that Shakespeare was more German than English. After the outbreak of the Second World War, the performance of Shakespeare was banned, though this ban was quickly lifted by Hitler in person, a favour extended to no other playwright. Not only did the regime appropriate the Bard, but it also appropriated Elizabethan England itself. To the Nazi leaders, Elizabethan England had been a young, vigorous nation, much like the Third Reich itself, quite unlike the decadent British Empire of the then present day.

There were some exceptions to the official approval of Shakespeare, as the great patriotic plays, most notably &quot;Henry V&quot;, were shelved. The reception of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; was at best lukewarm (Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;The Jew of Malta&quot; was suggested as a possible alternative), because it was not anti-Semitic enough for Nazi taste (the play&#x27;s conclusion, in which the daughter of the Jewish antagonist converts to Christianity and marries one of the Gentile protagonists, particularly violated Nazi notions of racial purity). &quot;Hamlet&quot; was by far the most popular play, along with &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;.

===In the Soviet Union===
Given the popularity of Shakespeare in Russia, there were film versions of Shakespeare that often differed from western interpretations, usually emphasizing a humanist message that implicitly criticized the Soviet regime. &quot;Othello&quot; (1955) by Sergei Yutkevich celebrated Desdemona&#x27;s love for Othello as a triumph of love over racial hatred. &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1964) by Grigori Kozintsev portrayed 16th century Denmark as a dark, gloomy and oppressive place, with recurring images of imprisonment, these marking the film from the focus on the portcullis of Elsinore to the iron corset Ophelia is forced to wear as she goes insane. The tyranny of Claudius was made to resemble the tyranny of Stalin with gigantic portraits and busts of Claudius being prominent in the background of the film, suggesting that Claudius had engaged in a &quot;cult of personality&quot;. Given the emphasis on images of imprisonment, Hamlet&#x27;s decision to avenge his father becomes almost subsidiary to his struggle for freedom, as he challenges the Stalin-like tyranny of Claudius. Hamlet in this film resembles a Soviet dissident who—despite his own hesitation, fears and doubts—can no longer stand the moral rot around him. The film was based on a script written by the novelist Boris Pasternak, who had been persecuted under Stalin. The 1971 version of &quot;King Lear&quot;, also directed by Kozintsev, presented the play as a &quot;Tolstoyan panorama of bestiality and courage&quot; as Lear finds his moral redemption amongst the common people.

===Acceptance in France===
Shakespeare, for a variety of reasons, had never caught on in France, and even when his plays were performed in France in the 19th century, they were drastically altered to fit in with French tastes, with, for example, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; having a happy ending. It was not until 1946 that &quot;Hamlet&quot;, as translated by André Gide, was performed in Paris and &quot;ensured Shakespeare&#x27;s elevation to cult status&quot; in France. The philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre wrote that French intellectuals had been &quot;abruptly reintegrated into history&quot; by the German occupation of 1940–44 as the old teleological history version of history with the world getting progressively better (as led by France) no longer held, and as such the &quot;nihilist&quot; and &quot;chaotic&quot; plays of Shakespeare finally found an audience in France. &quot;The Economist&quot; observed: &quot;By the late 1950s, Shakespeare had entered the French soul. No one who has seen the &quot;Comédie-Française&quot; perform his plays at the Salle Richelieu in Paris is likely to forget the special buzz in the audience, for the bard is the darling of France.&quot;

===In China===
In the years of tentative political and economic liberalization after the death of Mao in 1976, Shakespeare became popular in China. The very act of putting on a play by Shakespeare, formerly condemned as a &quot;bourgeois Western imperialist author&quot; whom no Chinese could respect, was in and of itself an act of quiet dissent. Of all Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, the most popular in China in the late 1970s and 1980s was &quot;Macbeth&quot;. It has been posited that Chinese audiences saw in this play, first performed in England in 1606 and set in 11th century Scotland, a parallel with the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s. The violence and bloody chaos of &quot;Macbeth&quot; reminded Chinese audiences of the violence and bloody chaos of the Cultural Revolution, and furthermore, the story of a national hero becoming a tyrant, complete with a power-hungry wife, was seen as a parallel with Mao Zedong and his wife, Jiang Qing. Reviewing a production of &quot;Macbeth&quot; in Beijing in 1980, one Chinese critic, Xu Xiaozhong, praised &quot;Macbeth&quot; as the story of &quot;how the greed for power finally ruined a great man&quot;. Another critic, Zhao Xun, wrote: &quot;&quot;Macbeth&quot; is the fifth Shakespearean play produced on the Chinese stage after the smashing of the Gang of Four. This play of conspiracy has always been performed at critical moments in the history of our nation&quot;.

Likewise, a 1982 production of &quot;King Lear&quot; was hailed by the critics as the story of &quot;moral decline&quot;, of a story &quot;when human beings&#x27; souls were so polluted that they even mistreated their aged parents&quot;, an allusion to the days of the Cultural Revolution when the young people serving in the Red Guard had berated, denounced, attacked and sometimes even killed their parents for failing to live up to &quot;Mao Zedong thought&quot;. The play&#x27;s director, the Shakespearean scholar Fang Ping, who had suffered during the Cultural Revolution for studying this &quot;bourgeois Western imperialist&quot;, stated in an interview at the time that &quot;King Lear&quot; was relevant in China because King Lear, the &quot;highest ruler of a monarchy&quot;, created a world full of cruelty and chaos where those who loved him were punished and those who did not were rewarded, a barely veiled reference to the often capricious behavior of Mao, who punished his loyal followers for no apparent reason. Cordelia&#x27;s devotion and love for her father—despite his madness, cruelty and rejection of her—is seen in China as affirming traditional Confucian values, where love of the family counts above all, and for this reason, &quot;King Lear&quot; is seen in China as being a very &quot;Chinese&quot; play that affirms the traditional values of filial piety.

A 1981 production of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; was a hit with Chinese audiences, as the play was seen to promote the theme of justice and fairness in life, with the character of Portia being especially popular, as she is seen as standing for, as one critic wrote, &quot;the humanist spirit of the Renaissance&quot; with its striving for &quot;individuality, human rights and freedom&quot;. The theme of a religious conflict between a Jewish merchant vs. a Christian merchant in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; is generally ignored in Chinese productions of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, as most Chinese find do not find the theme of Jewish-Christian conflict relevant. Unlike in Western productions, the character of Shylock is presented very much as an unnuanced villain, capable only of envy, spite, greed and cruelty, a man whose actions are only motivated by his spiritual impoverishment. By contrast, in the West, Shylock is usually presented as a nuanced villain, a man who has never held power over a Christian before, and lets that power go to his head. Another popular play, especially with dissidents under the Communist government, is &quot;Hamlet&quot;. &quot;Hamlet&quot;, with its theme of a man trapped under a tyrannical regime is very popular with Chinese dissidents, with one dissident Wu Ningkun, writing about his time in internal exile between 1958 and 1961 at a collective farm in a remote part of northern Manchuria, that he understood all too well the line &quot;Denmark is a prison!&quot;

===Film===

The divergence between text and performance in Shakespeare continued into the new medium of film. For instance, both &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; have been filmed in modern settings, sometimes with contemporary &quot;updated&quot; dialogue. Additionally, there have been efforts (notably by the BBC) to ensure the existence of a filmed or videotaped version of every Shakespeare play. The reasoning for this was educational, as many government initiatives recognised the need to get performative Shakespeare into the same classrooms as the plays being read.

===Poetry===

Many English-language Modernist poets drew on Shakespeare&#x27;s works, interpreting him in new ways. Ezra Pound, for instance, considered the Sonnets as a kind of apprentice work, with Shakespeare learning the art of poetry through writing them. He also declared the history plays to be the true English epic. In &quot;Tradition and the Individual Talent&quot;, T. S. Eliot wrote that &quot;Some can absorb knowledge, the more tardy must sweat for it. Shakespeare acquired more essential history from Plutarch than most men could from the whole British Museum.&quot; Basil Bunting rewrote the sonnets as modernist poems by simply erasing all the words he considered unnecessary. Louis Zukofsky had read all of Shakespeare&#x27;s works by the time he was eleven, and his &quot;Bottom: On Shakespeare&quot; (1947) is a book-length prose poem exploring the role of the eye in the plays. In its original printing, a second volume consisting of a setting of &quot;The Tempest&quot; by the poet&#x27;s wife, Celia Zukofsky, was also included.

==21st century==
Shakespeare&#x27;s reputation continues to have an influence on the film industry, with new versions of his works, such as &quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth&quot; (2021), directed by Joel Coen, being put into production. Regular performances of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays continue to be held globally, with Shakespeare&#x27;s works often appreciated by the younger generation of students, the liberal, progressive Gen Z. Critics continue to regard Shakespeare as the greatest playwrights of the English Language. Shakespeare&#x27;s plays (especially A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream, The Merchant of Venice and Julius Caesar) continue to be taught in numerous English-speaking schools globally, and have been translated into different languages.

==Critical quotations==
The growth of Shakespeare&#x27;s reputation is illustrated by a timeline of Shakespeare criticism, from John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;when he describes any thing, you more than see it, you feel it too&quot; (1668) to Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s estimation of Shakespeare as the &quot;strongest of rallying-signs&quot; (1841) for an English identity.

<doc id="1212808" wikidata="Q1495674" url="?curid=1212808" title="Gastroschisis">
<text>Gastroschisis is a birth defect in which the baby&#x27;s intestines extend outside of the abdomen through a hole next to the belly button. The size of the hole is variable, and other organs including the stomach and liver may also occur outside the baby&#x27;s body. Complications may include feeding problems, prematurity, intestinal atresia, and intrauterine growth restriction.
The cause is typically unknown. Rates are higher in babies born to mothers who smoke, drink alcohol, or are younger than 20 years old. Ultrasounds during pregnancy may make the diagnosis. Otherwise, diagnosis occurs at birth. It differs from omphalocele in that there is no covering membrane over the intestines.
Treatment involves surgery. This typically occurs shortly after birth. In those with large defects, the exposed organs may be covered with a special material and slowly moved back into the abdomen. This condition affects about 4 per 10,000 newborns. Rates of the condition appear to be increasing.

== Signs and symptoms ==
There are no signs during pregnancy. About sixty percent of infants with gastroschisis are born prematurely. At birth, the baby will have a relatively small (&lt;4cm) hole in the abdominal wall, usually just to the right of the belly button. Some of the intestines are usually outside the body, passing through this opening. In rare circumstances, the liver and stomach may also come through the abdominal wall. After birth, these organs are directly exposed to air.

== Causes ==
The cause of gastroschisis is not known. There may be genetic causes in some cases, and there may be environmental factors to which the mother is exposed during pregnancy.

Risk factors include the mother being young, and use of alcohol or tobacco.

== Pathophysiology ==
During the fourth week of human embryonic development, the lateral body wall folds of the embryo meet at the midline and fuse together to form the anterior body wall. However, in gastroschisis and other anterior body wall defects, this fails to occur due to either one or both of the lateral body wall folds not moving properly to meet with the other and fuse. This incomplete fusion results in a defect that allows abdominal organs to protrude through the abdominal wall, and the intestines typically herniate through the rectus abdominis muscle, lying to the right of the umbilicus. The forces responsible for the movement of the lateral body wall folds are poorly understood, and a better understanding of these forces would help to explain why gastroschisis occurs mostly to the right of the umbilicus, while other ventral body wall defects occur in the midline.

At least six hypotheses have been proposed for the pathophysiology:
# Failure of mesoderm to form in the body wall
# Rupture of the amnion around the umbilical ring with subsequent herniation of bowel
# Abnormal involution of the right umbilical vein leading to weakening of the body wall and gut herniation
# Disruption of the right vitelline (yolk sac) artery with subsequent body wall damage and gut herniation
# Abnormal folding of the body wall resulting in a ventral body wall defect through which the gut herniates
# Failure to incorporate the yolk sac and related vitelline structures into the umbilical stalk

The first hypothesis does not explain why the mesoderm defect would occur in such a specific small area. The second hypothesis does not explain the low percentage of associated abnormality compared with omphalocele. The third hypothesis was criticized due to no vascular supplement of anterior abdominal wall by umbilical vein. The fourth hypothesis was commonly accepted, but it was later shown that the right vitelline artery (right omphalomesenteric artery) did not supply the anterior abdominal wall in this area. More evidence is needed to support the fifth hypothesis.

==Diagnosis==
In the developed world, around 90% of cases are identified during normal ultrasound screens, usually in the second trimester.

Distinguished from other ventral body wall defects such as omphalocele, there is no overlying sac or peritoneum, and the defect is usually much smaller in gastroschisis.

==Treatment==
Gastroschisis requires surgical treatment to return the exposed intestines to the abdominal cavity and close the hole in the abdomen. Sometimes this is done immediately but more often the exposed organs are covered with sterile drapings, and only later is the surgery done. Affected newborns frequently require more than one surgery, as only about 10% of cases can be closed in a single surgery.

Given the urgent need for surgery after birth, it is recommended that delivery occur at a facility equipped for caring for these high-risk neonates, as transfers to other facilities may increase risk of adverse outcomes. There is no evidence that cesarean deliveries lead to better outcomes for babies with gastroschisis, so cesarean delivery is only considered if there are other indications.

The main cause for lengthy recovery periods is the time taken for the infant&#x27;s bowel function to return to normal. After surgery infants are fed through IV fluids and gradually introduced to normal feeding.

== Prognosis ==
If left untreated, gastroschisis is fatal to the infant; however, in adequate settings the survival rate for treated infants is 90%.

Most risks of gastroschisis are related to decreased bowel function. Sometimes blood flow to the exposed organs is impaired or there is less than the normal amount of intestine. This may put infants at risk for other dangerous conditions such as necrotizing enterocolitis. Also, because their intestines are exposed, infants with gastroschisis are at increased risk for infection, and must be closely monitored.

After surgery a child with gastroschisis will have some degree of intestinal malrotation. About 1% of children will experience a midgut volvulus after surgery.

== Epidemiology ==
As of 2015 the worldwide incidence was about 2 to 5 per 10,000 live births, and this number seemed to be increasing.

As of 2017 the CDC estimates that about 1,871 babies are born each year in the United States with gastroschisis.

<text>Hyderabad District ( ), is a district of Sindh, Pakistan. Its capital is the city of Hyderabad. The district is the second most urbanized in Sindh, after Karachi, with 80% of its population residing in urban areas.

==History==
The East India Company occupied Sindh in 1843. They formed three districts in Sindh administratively: Hyderabad, Karachi and Shikarpur.

In 1901, a new taluka named Nasrat was created from Sakrand and Shahdadpur talukas.

In 1912, the northern side of the district separated to form Nawabshah district.

In 1975, the southern side also separated to form Badin district.

After the 1998 census, two new talukas were created in the district named; Hyderabad city and Latifabad talukas.

After the 2002 elections, a new taluka was created in the district named Qasimabad from Hyderabad City taluka.

The city of Hyderabad is where the district headquarters were located and the district government used to be seated. The last Deputy Commissioner of the district was Rizwan Ahmed. Until the early 1970s the district included all the four districts mentioned above as well as the Badin district. This administrative setup was demolished by former President Pervez Musharraf in 2001 when he introduced the local body government.

In 2005, three new districts - Tando Muhammad Khan, Matiari and Tando Allahyar districts were formed out of Hyderabad district.

<doc id="1212828" wikidata="Q970705" url="?curid=1212828" title="Enrique (album)">
<text>Enrique is the debut English album and fourth studio album by Enrique Iglesias recorded in English and released on 23 November 1999. The album launched two number one US Billboard Hot 100 hits, &quot;Bailamos&quot; and &quot;Be with You&quot;.

==Background==

After the success of his first English crossover single &quot;Bailamos&quot;, Iglesias signed a multi-album deal with Interscope and spent the next two months recording the first English album. Knowing that Iglesias was a Bruce Springsteen fan, Interscope chairman Jimmy Iovine recommended that Iglesias covered the Springsteen track &quot;Sad Eyes&quot; which had recently been released on Springsteen&#x27;s collection of rare recordings &quot;Tracks&quot;. The album also contains a duet with Whitney Houston, titled &quot;Could I Have This Kiss Forever&quot;, which Iglesias and Houston recorded separately. Iglesias recorded the song in Los Angeles and Houston in Hamburg, Germany with both of them singing with each other over the phone. They did eventually meet when they re-recorded the track for the single release. The album also included the crossover song &quot;Bailamos&quot; which had previously been on a special edition of Enrique&#x27;s &quot;Cosas del Amor&quot; album and the &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; soundtrack. The album cover was photographed by Pepe Botella.

==Commercial performance==
The album debuted at number 33 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart and would go on to be certified Platinum in the United States for shipping 1 million units. It was certified for two platinum awards by IFPI Europe, for selling 2 million units all over Europe. The album was a success in Canada too, where it became 5 times Platinum. It achieved Platinum status in Australia and New Zealand and Gold in Mexico and other countries.

<text>Pierre-Henri Teitgen (29 May 1908 – 6 April 1997) was a French lawyer, professor and politician. Teitgen was born in Rennes, Brittany. Taken POW in 1940, he played a major role in the French Resistance. Teitgen&#x27;s father, Henri Teitgen (1882–1965), was a senior politician of the Popular Republican Movement.

A member of French Parliament from 1945 to 1958 for Ille-et-Vilaine, Pierre-Henri was president of the Popular Republican Movement (Christian Democratic Party) from 1952 to 1956. He was Minister of Information in 1944 (one of the founders of the daily &quot;Le Monde&quot;), Minister of Justice in 1945–1946 (in charge of the purges from government of the Vichy regime&#x27;s followers and of Nazi collaborators), Minister of Defence in 1947–48 in Robert Schuman&#x27;s government at the time of the insurrectional strikes. In May 1948, he attended the Congress of The Hague and worked closely with Robert Schuman in Schuman Declaration and the start of the European Community when he was Minister of Information and Civil service in 1949–1950. He was later Minister of Overseas in 1950. He was member of the Constitutional Committee in 1958. He was twice Deputy Prime Minister in 1947–1948 and 1953–1954. He was member of the Consultative Constitutional Committee in 1958 but became a critic of de Gaulle&#x27;s policies.

He supported the Socialist Defferre in his attempt as candidate for presidency in 1965. In September 1976, he was appointed member of the European Court of Human Rights. He had helped to create the court some 27 years earlier, in 1949, outlining its powers and the rights it should protect in a report for the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe. Teitgen died in Paris in 1997.

<text>In project management, a death march is a project which participants believe to be destined for failure, or that requires a stretch of unsustainable overwork. The project &quot;marches to its death&quot; as its members are forced by their superiors to continue the project, against their better judgment. The term originated in the field of software development, and has since spread to other fields.

Death marches are usually a result of unrealistic or overly optimistic expectations in scheduling or feature scope, and often result from a lack of appropriate documentation, relevant training, or outside expertise needed to complete the project. Death marches can also be triggered by misunderstandings between parties, unresolved assumptions, mismatched expectations, and sometimes external change. Management may desperately attempt to right the course of the project by asking team members to work grueling hours (14-hour days or 7-day weeks) or by attempting to &quot;throw (enough) bodies at the problem&quot;, often causing burnout.

The discomfort is heightened by project participants&#x27; knowledge that the failure is avoidable. It may have succeeded with competent management, such as by devoting the obviously required resources, including bringing all relevant expertise, technology, or applied science to the task, rather than just whatever incomplete knowledge a few employees happened to possess. Business culture pressures may play a role in addition to mere incompetence.

The term &quot;death march&quot; is discussed at length in Edward Yourdon&#x27;s book &quot;Death March&quot;. Yourdon&#x27;s definition: &quot;a death march project is one whose &#x27;project parameters&#x27; exceed the norm by at least 50 percent.&quot;

=== WARSIM ===
WARSIM is a U.S. Army wargame. The project was originally called WARSIM 2000 at its inception in the early 1990s. Several decades after its original scheduled delivery date, WARSIM had yet to support a single Army training exercise, but is still being funded, largely to vindicate those who conceived of the system and defended it over the lifetime of its development. WARSIM was eventually used in the North Carolina National Guard&#x27;s Brigade Warfighter Exercise in January 2013. The WARSIM schedule slipped many times and still does not measure up to the legacy system it was supposed to replace. Moreover, WARSIM has a clumsy architecture that requires enough servers to fill a small room, while earlier &quot;legacy&quot; wargames run efficiently on a single standard desktop workstation.
