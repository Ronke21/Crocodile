<text>The Queens Museum (formerly the Queens Museum of Art) is an art museum and educational center at Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Queens, New York City, United States. Established in 1972, the museum includes the &quot;Panorama of the City of New York&quot;, a room-sized scale model of the five boroughs of New York City built for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Its collection includes a large archive of artifacts from both the 1939 and 1964 World&#x27;s Fairs, a selection of which is on display. , Queens Museum&#x27;s director is Sally Tallant.

The museum&#x27;s building was constructed for the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair as the New York City Pavilion. The structure was used as an ice-skating and roller-skating rink during the 1940s and 1950s, except when it housed the United Nations General Assembly from 1946 to 1951. The building also served as the New York City Pavilion for the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair and was preserved following the fair. The museum opened in the northern part of the building in November 1972. The museum was renovated in the late 1970s, during which a community gallery was added; another renovation in the 1990s added an entrance from the east. The museum was expanded significantly in the 2010s, during which the ice rink was closed. Another expansion was announced in the 2020s.

==History==

=== Early building use ===

==== 1939 World&#x27;s Fair ====
The Queens Museum is located in the New York City Pavilion at Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, designed by architect Aymar Embury II for the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair. The fair was first announced in 1935, and engineering consultant J. Franklin Bell drew up preliminary plans for the fairground the next year, including a structure for the New York City government. The building was originally proposed as a two-story &quot;glass house&quot;, but it was ultimately erected as a more conventional rectangular building. Mayor Fiorello La Guardia said he wanted the building to showcase &quot;modern municipal government in all its aspects&quot;. In April 1937, the New York City Board of Estimate approved the sale of $180,000 in bonds to fund the construction of the City Building&#x27;s foundation. That August, Psaty &amp; Fuhrman submitted a low bid of $556,000 for the building&#x27;s construction. The building&#x27;s ceremonial cornerstone was laid in January 1938, and the facade was completed by the beginning of May. La Guardia used the building as his &quot;summer City Hall&quot; during mid-1938, and his office there was fitted with temporary mechanical equipment while other parts of the building were being completed.

The New York City Pavilion ultimately cost $1.645 million. The pavilion was the second-largest structure at the fair, after the United States pavilion, and it was intended as a permanent structure for the outset, in contrast to nearly all the other structures, which would have been demolished. Next to the building was a plaza named City Hall Square, which separated it from the Trylon and Perisphere, the central monument of the 1939 fair. Around it was a spiral hedge ranging from tall, as well as English boxwood trimmed in the shape of the fair&#x27;s seal. Malvina Hoffman designed a bas-relief called &quot;Dances of the Races&quot; to the east of the building, while William Zorach designed the sculptural group &quot;Builders of the Future&quot; to the west. Inside the pavilion were dioramas, murals, models, and displays about various departments of the city government. The pavilion included exhibits on such topics as the WNYC radio station, the city&#x27;s courts, and the Independent Subway System, along with stage shows and a voting demonstration. There were a total of 63 exhibits, as well as an auditorium.

La Guardia dedicated the building when the fair opened on April 30, 1939. The fair ran for two 6-month seasons until October 26, 1940. A special edition of &quot;New York Advancing&quot;, a book about the city government, was published in celebration of the fair&#x27;s opening. The special edition included an official guide to the New York City Pavilion. After the end of the fair&#x27;s first season in November 1939, the space east of the building was converted to a concert area, and furniture was stored in the pavilion prior to the 1940 season. A memorial plaque was installed on the New York City Pavilion after two policemen were killed in 1940 while attempting to defuse a bomb nearby.

==== United Nations and skating rink ====

The New York City Building was one of seven structures at Flushing Meadows to be preserved following the 1939 fair. Within days of the fair&#x27;s closure in October 1940, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation had requested $25,000 from the New York City Board of Estimate to convert the building to an ice rink. The building was divided into a roller skating rink to the north and an ice-skating rink to the south. The roller rink measured , while the ice rink measured and could be used for other sports such as basketball and tennis. The rinks opened on January 12, 1941, as the park&#x27;s first sporting facility. Skaters had to pay an admission fee, and spectators were also charged a fee after late 1941. The rinks recorded 150,000 total visitors in their first three months and 1.4 million total visitors in five years.

The United Nations was planning a permanent headquarters during the 1940s. While the organization was deciding on a permanent headquarters, UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie decided in April 1946 to use the New York City Pavilion as a meeting hall for the United Nations General Assembly. The city and UN agreed to spend $2.27 million to renovate the pavilion and environs, and workers began renovations in May 1946. A wall was built between the northern and southern halves of the building, and an auditorium and small annex was built in the northern half. The southern half was converted to space for air conditioning equipment. Workers also planted a flower garden at the site of the Trylon and Perisphere, in addition to 1,000 trees, 2,500 shrubs, and 200,000 other plants around the building. In addition, nearby roads were upgraded. Early plans called for the General Assembly to use the building for only six months; the building would have continued to function as a roller-skating and ice-skating rink afterward.

Once the renovations were completed, the UN took over the building that September, and a formal ceremony was hosted on October 18, 1946. Later that year, the UN decided to build its permanent headquarters in Manhattan, and the UN was allowed to stay at the New York City Pavilion until the Manhattan headquarters was finished. Numerous significant events occurred at the New York City Pavilion in the UN&#x27;s early years, including the creation of UNICEF, the partition of Korea, and the authorization of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine (during which Israel was created). The UN renewed its lease of the building in late 1947. The pavilion was the temporary home of the General Assembly until October 20, 1951, and the General Assembly met in Manhattan afterward.

After the UN vacated the space, contractors converted the building back into a rink as part of a $237,000 renovation. A wooden roller-skating rink and a ice rink were added, and ramps and public announcement systems were also installed. The rink reopened on October 18, 1952, and was renovated again in mid-1953. To celebrate the New York City Pavilion&#x27;s usage as a temporary General Assembly hall, the building was depicted in a stamp released by the United Nations in 1958. By the 1960s, it was one of two major structures in Flushing Meadows Park that remained from the 1939 fair, the other being Billy Rose&#x27;s Aquacade.

==== 1964 World&#x27;s Fair ====

The Flushing Meadows site was selected in 1959 for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Gilmore David Clarke and Michael Rapuano, who had redesigned the park for the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair, were retained to tailor the park layout for the new fair. New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses was appointed as president of the World&#x27;s Fair Corporation, which was to operate the fair. Moses decided to reuse the New York City Building as the city&#x27;s exhibition space during the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair. Almost all of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park was closed in early 1961 in advance of the fair, except for the New York City Building&#x27;s ice skating rink. In June 1961, the New York City Board of Estimate awarded a contract for the construction of the &quot;Panorama of the City of New York&quot;, a scale model of New York City within the City Building. The city government announced in 1962 that it would spend $832,500 to renovate the building&#x27;s skating rink. The architect Daniel Chait was hired to renovate the City Building. Moses requested $1.066 million for the building&#x27;s renovation in June 1962, and the Board of Estimate ultimately approved $2 million in funding. In mid-1963, two figure-skating companies were selected to perform at the City Building as part of a show called Dick Button&#x27;s Ice-Travaganza.

The New York City Building was formally rededicated on April 25, 1964, two days after the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair opened. Tickets to the ice-skating show ranged from $1 to $2, while tickets for simulated helicopter rides above the &quot;Panorama&quot; cost 10 cents apiece. The main attraction in the building was the &quot;Panorama of the City of New York&quot;, which had cost the city $600,000 and taken two years to construct. The building&#x27;s ice rink was equipped with a ski run, in addition to six movable stages and 12 stationary stages. Memorabilia and artworks from 34 museums were displayed inside the building to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the British conquest of New Netherland, and a film displayed the history of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA). Radio station WNYC also moved much of its broadcasting operations to the City Building during the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair. A replica of a New York City Police Department precinct was added to the building.

During the 1964 season, there were rarely any queues to get inside the City Building. The &quot;Panorama&quot; was initially relatively unpopular with visitors, but it ultimately recorded an average of 1,400 visitors a day. Dick Button&#x27;s Ice-Travaganza was also unsuccessful, despite the building&#x27;s central location within the World&#x27;s Fair grounds. The New York City Building operated until the end of the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair in October 1965. From the outset, Moses planned to preserve the New York City Building after the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair, and the World&#x27;s Fair Corporation set aside funding for the building&#x27;s renovation at the end of the fair. The initial plans called for the &quot;Panorama&quot; to be moved from the building to the Civic Center of Manhattan, allowing the City Building to be used as a skating rink. Moses subsequently offered to have the TBTA take responsibility for the &quot;Panorama&quot;. The City Building was one of the few buildings to remain from the 1964 fair, along with the Unisphere, Singer Bowl, New York State and U.S. pavilions, and the Hall of Science. The structure was used by the TBTA in the 1960s, and the city government took over the surrounding park in 1967.

=== Late 20th century ===

==== Creation of museum ====

After the TBTA moved out of the New York City Pavilion, city parks commissioner August Heckscher II announced in November 1971 that part of the New York City Pavilion would be converted into Queens&#x27;s first art museum. Heckscher organized a board of 14 trustees, and the city government provided $100,000 for the museum. During mid-1972, the mechanical systems for the building&#x27;s skating rink were refurbished, and part of the building was renovated to accommodate the museum. A local group, the Flushing Meadows Corona Park World&#x27;s Fair Association, also asked the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission to conduct a historical study of the New York City Pavilion. Queens borough president Donald Manes announced in July 1972 that the Queens County Art and Cultural Center had been established at the New York City Pavilion. The museum opened on November 12, 1972, with Clare Fisher as the museum&#x27;s first director. The writer Lawrence R. Samuel wrote that the building&#x27;s conversion into a museum helped to raise Flushing Meadows Park&#x27;s profile, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the museum as &quot;a primary force in [the] renaissance of the arts&quot; in Queens.

Originally, the Queens County Art and Cultural Center occupied , and two-fifths of the museum&#x27;s space was taken up by the &quot;Panorama&quot;. There was only about of actual display space, which meant that the museum had to close every time a temporary exhibit was being added or replaced. The museum had four to five school groups per day, though nearly as many school groups had to be denied admission to the lack of space. The museum&#x27;s main entrance was at the northern end of the New York City Pavilion building, while the ice-skating rink occupied the structure&#x27;s southern half. The museum&#x27;s collection also had no clear focus; according to a 1991 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, many visitors assumed the Queens Museum was a history museum or knew only about its &quot;Panorama&quot;. Shortly after the museum opened, the city allocated $140,000 for additional upgrades to the New York City Pavilion, which was later increased to $317,000. The ice-skating rink continued to operate five days a week.

==== Mid-1970s to 1980s ====
The Queens County Art and Cultural Center changed its name to the Queens Museum in late 1973. The board of trustees fired Fisher as the museum director that year, following disagreements over policy. Kenneth Kahn was hired to replace Fisher in 1974. The museum&#x27;s eight employees subsequently expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of personnel guidance from the board of trustees, and the staff sought to restructure the museum. Kahn alleged in early 1975 that the trustees were &quot;a closed corporation, representing a narrow spectrum of the community&quot;. The Friends of the Queens Museum, a volunteer group for the museum, suspended its operations to protest the trustees&#x27; actions. The museum&#x27;s board of trustees fired Kahn in February 1975, along with the museum&#x27;s administrator Betty Miller the next month. Several trustees also resigned, and the museum&#x27;s staff took over the museum&#x27;s gift shop from the Friends group. Kahn later sued several trustees, claiming that they had broken a contract and slandered him.

Thomas Hoving, the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s director, was hired as the museum&#x27;s interim director in March 1975, and the dissent surrounding the museum subsided. Blanche Taub, the leader of the Friends, was also elected to the museum&#x27;s board of trustees, and the board itself was replaced shortly thereafter. Amid the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis, the city reneged on a $350,000 grant that it had offered to the museum&#x27;s staff for a renovation of the building. It took more than two years before a permanent director was hired. Janet Schneider was hired as the museum&#x27;s executive director in February 1978. Geraldine Eiber, who was appointed the same year as the museum&#x27;s president, wanted to increase public awareness of the museum, in addition to obtaining new art and corporate sponsorships. The New York City Council provided more than $500,000 for an expansion of the Queens Museum shortly afterward, which would add over of exhibition space. The Queens Museum&#x27;s Community Gallery opened in September 1979 as an exhibit space for the local community. The Queens Museum also began visiting local groups in an attempt to increase residents&#x27; involvement with the museum.

The museum continued to expand its space within the New York City Pavilion through the 1980s. By 1982, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reported that the museum&#x27;s gallery, studios, workshops, office, and backroom spaces took up nearly half the building. The Queens Museum began developing a sculpture hall in 1983, when Chase Manhattan Bank gave the museum $150,000 to fund the acquisition of casts from the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s collection. Ultimately, the Queens Museum loaned 40 casts permanently, and the sculpture hall opened in 1986 with 22 casts. The museum also considered restoring the &quot;Panorama&quot; and adding moving walkways to that exhibit. Schneider resigned in 1989 after twelve years as the museum&#x27;s director; by then, the museum was planning a $14 million expansion. Steven Klindt was hired as the new director later that year. By then, the museum had 100,000 annual visitors (many times higher than in the 1970s), though membership was less than projected, with 1,200 members. Furthermore, many visitors were either part of school groups or came specifically to see the &quot;Panorama&quot;.

==== 1990s ====
In the early 1990s, the museum received $13.5 million from the city government for a renovation of the New York City Pavilion. Despite citywide budget cuts, the museum was able to keep most of its programs intact, though it did have to fire some staff. Queens Museum officials began renovating the museum building in June 1991, and the museum&#x27;s name was lengthened from &quot;Queens Museum&quot; to &quot;Queens Museum of Art&quot;. The architect Rafael Viñoly reconfigured the structure into galleries, classrooms, and offices. A new entrance and galleries were built to the east, facing the Unisphere, and a 117-seat auditorium was also built. In addition, a ramp was constructed between the upper and lower levels of the museum. The &quot;Panorama&quot;, the museum&#x27;s sole permanent exhibit, was removed so workers could update it. Museum workers had finished renovating the facade by 1992.

During the renovation, the museum recorded fewer visitors, in part because the &quot;Panorama&quot; was temporarily removed and because the existing exhibits did not appeal to Queens&#x27;s increasingly ethnically diverse population. The museum also began looking to hire an executive to help raise funds, and Carma C. Fauntleroy was hired as the museum&#x27;s executive director in 1993. In addition, museum executives began meeting with Queens community groups, as the museum wanted to host more shows that signified Queens&#x27;s cultural diversity. The renovation was completed in November 1994 with double the amount of gallery space. Fauntleroy said the new galleries would allow the museum to display more visual art. The renovation ultimately cost $15 million. In the long term, the museum also wanted to expand into the space occupied by the ice rink.

By the late 1990s, Queens borough president Claire Shulman was considering replacing the New York City Pavilion&#x27;s ice rink with a new rink at Cunningham Park in eastern Queens. The relocation would allow the Queens Museum to expand even further, though the proposal was controversial. At the time, the ice rink was deteriorating, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation preferred to demolish the rink rather than repair it. Laurene Buckley took over as the museum&#x27;s executive director in July 1999, with plans to expand the permanent collection and attract more visitors. That November, she initiated the First Thursdays program, in which the museum hosted events and activities one Thursday a month.

=== 21st century ===

==== 2000s and early 2010s ====
In 2001, the New York City Department of Design and Construction hosted an architectural design competition for a proposed renovation of the Queens Museum building. The museum hired Eric Owen Moss to design the expansion that December. The plans called for the relocation of the ice skating rink, as well as a new bent-glass roof, an exhibition space at the center of the structure, and a dirt mound facing Grand Central Parkway to the west. This would have doubled the museum&#x27;s space and allowed it to accommodate more art exhibitions and programs. The city government also promised $22.5 million toward the museum&#x27;s expansion, but the museum needed to raise another $15 million. Architectural critics derided Moss&#x27;s plans, and preservationists described it as being incongruous with the building&#x27;s original design; museum officials then voted to scale down Moss&#x27;s plans. NYC Parks began building another ice rink nearby in 2002 to replace the New York City Pavilion&#x27;s rink, but work on the new rink was delayed later that year due to funding shortages. The next year, city officials said they could not provide funds for the museum&#x27;s expansion until 2006.

Tom Finkelpearl was hired as the museum&#x27;s director in early 2002. Finkelpearl said at the time that many visitors to Flushing Meadows Corona Park continued to ignore the museum because the building looked &quot;like it&#x27;s closed, even when we&#x27;re open&quot;. He was advocating for changes to the museum&#x27;s renovation plans by late 2004, saying that Moss&#x27;s plan &quot;wasn&#x27;t jelling from a practical perspective&quot;. Accordingly, the museum abandoned Moss&#x27;s plan in early 2005. The museum solicited a new proposal from Grimshaw Architects, which agreed to work with local engineering firm Ammann &amp; Whitney. Queens borough president Helen Marshall gave the museum a $10.6 million grant for the expansion in March 2006, which at the time was the largest gift the museum had ever received. Grimshaw presented revised designs for the expansion that October. The revised plans called for new facades to the west and east, as well as a skylit interior courtyard. At the time, the renovation was supposed to cost $37 million of which $21 million came from Marshall&#x27;s office.

The museum began an expansion project in 2009. Grimshaw Architects and Ammann &amp; Whitney developed plans for of exhibition, education, and office space, as well as eight new artist studios. The new space would be created on the site of the old ice skating rink. The ice rink was relocated to a new facility in the northeastern section of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. and the interior of the ice rink was demolished by the beginning of 2010. The project ultimately ended up costing $69 million. The expanded museum reopened in November 2013 with a new entrance at Grand Central Parkway. After it reopened, the museum shortened its name to Queens Museum.

==== Mid-2010s to present ====

Finkelpearl resigned in 2014 when he was hired as commissioner of the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs. Subsequently, the Queens Museum appointed Laura Raicovich as its director that October. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that, in contrast to other museum directors (who tended to be politically uninvolved), Raicovich was politically outspoken during her tenure as the Queens Museum&#x27;s director; Raicovich said her actions were intended to make the museum more attractive to Queens&#x27;s diverse population. During the first inauguration of Donald Trump as U.S. president in January 2017, the museum closed temporarily in conjunction with a protest hosted by artists. The museum also began hosting events at nearby houses and streets. Raicovich told the &quot;Times&quot; that these events had been intended to counter a decline in visitor numbers that occurred after Trump&#x27;s election.

In 2017, the museum controversially canceled an agreement to rent space for a party celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Israeli Declaration of Independence. Raicovich had called the party a &quot;political event&quot;. Local politicians worked to restore the museum&#x27;s commitment to host the event, which was ultimately reinstated at the museum. The event included a staged reenactment of the November 29, 1947, United Nations vote to partition the British Mandate for Palestine. As a consequence of the controversy, the Queens Museum&#x27;s board commissioned an investigation into misbehaviors by Raicovich and deputy director David Strauss. Raicovich resigned in January 2018, and Strauss was fired. The British curator Sally Tallant was hired as the museum&#x27;s new director in late 2018.

The Queens Museum was closed temporarily from March to September 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. The city government gave the museum $26.4 million in September 2021 to complete the second phase of its expansion. In mid-2022, the museum hired Levenbetts to design the renovation, which museum officials predicted would cost $69 million. The project would create a children&#x27;s museum wing; add of storage space; build a art lab; and add classrooms, conservation, and exhibit preparation spaces. The project was to involve repairing the south facade as well. The city allocated another $8.5 million for the children&#x27;s museum space in August 2023.

==Building==
The museum building, originally the New York City Pavilion, covers following the 2013 renovation. As constructed, the building measured across, with a ceiling high. The building includes exhibit spaces, event spaces, artists&#x27; studios, a cafe, and an atrium. The structure is one of five buildings that survive from the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair. The other structures include a boathouse and an administration building in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park; the Parachute Jump on Coney Island; and the Belgian Building at Virginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia. It is also one of several 1964 World&#x27;s Fair structures that remain in the park, along with the New York Hall of Science, the New York State Pavilion, Terrace on the Park, and the Unisphere.

The exterior is primarily made of concrete. When the New York City Pavilion was built, it had rectangular pillars, glass-block walls, and a geometric cornice. In advance of the 1964 fair, the glass blocks were covered up, and the cornice was removed. Prior to the 2013 renovation, the building had no main entrance; thus, many visitors to Flushing Meadows–Corona Park did not know of the museum&#x27;s existence. After the 2013 renovation, there is a , glass wall on the western facade of the museum building. The glass facade consists of fritted glass panels interspersed with aluminum panels. At night, the facade is illuminated by LED lights that are visible from Grand Central Parkway immediately to the west. The eastern end of the building has a set of revolving doors embedded within a curtain wall, which in turn is recessed behind a colonnade.

==Collections and exhibits==
===Permanent collection===
The museum&#x27;s permanent collection includes 10,000 items related to the 1939 and 1964 World&#x27;s Fairs. As of 2013, about 900 World&#x27;s Fair objects are on permanent display. Acquisitions over the years have included works by Salvador Dalí and Mark Dion. 

==== &quot;Panorama of the City of New York&quot; ====
The largest permanent exhibition at the Queens Museum is the &quot;Panorama of the City of New York&quot;, which was constructed by Lester Associates for the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair. A celebration of the city&#x27;s municipal infrastructure, this architectural model includes almost every building that existed in all five boroughs in 1992, at a 1:1200 scale. One hundred employees from Raymond Lester Associates built the model in three years. The model is made of 273 panels. The panorama depicts 895,000 individual structures, which are made of plastic or wood. All of the bridges are made of brass. The panel depicting the Far Rockaway neighborhood was not originally installed due to space limitations; in 1987, the Far Rockaway panel was installed in its own room.

After the Fair closed, the &quot;Panorama&quot; remained open to the public, and Lester&#x27;s team updated the map in 1967, 1968, and 1969. After 1970, very few changes were made until 1992, when again Lester Associates was hired to update the model, adding over 60,000 structures. In March 2009, the museum announced that it would allow people to donate at least $50 to have accurate scale models created and added. The mechanical &quot;helicopter&quot; vehicles for conveying exhibition visitors were showing signs of wear, and were removed before the 1994 reopening. The &quot;Panorama&quot; has also hosted temporary exhibits, such as models of unbuilt structures the 2018 exhibit &quot;Never Built New York&quot;.

The current installation, dating to a 1990s renovation of the museum by Rafael Viñoly, features accessible ramps and an elevated glass floored walkway which surround the &quot;Panorama&quot;. Since 2023, the museum has also allowed visitors to look at individual structures in the &quot;Panorama&quot;, via an electronic kiosk display.

==== &quot;Relief Map of the New York City Water Supply System&quot; ====
The museum also displays the &quot;Relief Map of the New York City Water Supply System&quot;, which measures across, with a total area of . The map is a scale model of the New York City water supply system and watershed. Tunnels and reservoirs are marked by lights that are placed across the map. The map is divided into 27 panels so it can be easily disassembled.

The Department of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity (a predecessor to the New York City Department of Environmental Protection) commissioned the Cartographic Survey Force of the Works Progress Administration to create the map for the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair. Work began in 1938, with a budget of $100,000 (), but it was not displayed at the 1939 fair. The reason for this is variously attributed to World War II-era security concerns and the map&#x27;s large area. The map was displayed at Grand Central Palace in 1948, the only time in the 20th century that it was publicly displayed. For the rest of the century, the map remained in storage and experienced dust and water damage. Museum officials announced in 2005 that they would install the map in the museum. The map was restored by the McKay Lodge Fine Arts Conservation Lab in Oberlin, Ohio, between 2006 and 2008, then displayed at the Queens Museum.

==== World&#x27;s Fair Visual Storage and Gallery ====
Located on the second floor of the Queens Museum, this exhibit displays memorabilia from both the 1939 and 1964 World&#x27;s Fairs. About 900 objects are displayed on-site. The online catalog contains over 10,000 items in total from both fairs.

=== Non-permanent collection ===

==== Neustadt Collection of Tiffany Glass ====
Since 1995, the museum has maintained a partnership with the Neustadt Collection of Tiffany Glass. Selections from the collection are on long-term display, drawn from a large private Tiffany collection assembled by Egon Neustadt and his wife Hildegard starting in the mid-1930s. The pieces originally went on display in 1997, after the museum&#x27;s expansion was completed, and were intended to be exhibited for a decade. There are 440 pieces in the collection, most of which are kept in storage in Long Island City, Queens, and are not on public view. The history of the creation of Tiffany&#x27;s artworks is featured in the Queens Museum exhibitions, as Tiffany Studios and Furnaces was once located in Corona, which were closed in the 1930s.

=== Temporary exhibits ===
The museum also stages temporary exhibits regularly. In its first decade, the museum staged eight to ten temporary exhibits annually. The museum&#x27;s first-ever exhibition was a set of 19th-century landscapes from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Starting in the 1970s, local artists&#x27; work was displayed at the museum every year, and there were two or three annual exhibitions of local artists&#x27; work. The topics of other exhibits in the 1970s included works by Joseph Cornell, animals in art, historical representations of cows, sports-themed art, the history of Queens, and items from the 1939 and 1964 fairs. During the 1980s, the topics of the museum&#x27;s exhibits included American art films, 18th- and 19th-century European prints, Spanish gold artifacts, and the creation of the &quot;Panorama&quot; exhibit. By the end of that decade, the museum displayed about 15 exhibits a year.

The museum began hosting exhibits relating to Queens residents and ethnic groups in the 1990s. These included exhibits about Korean Americans and the musician Louis Armstrong. Exhibits in the first decade of the 21st century included a showcase of crime scene photographs from the &quot;Daily News&quot;″ archives, a showcase of banners created by schoolchildren, a show about the diplomat Ralph Bunche, drawings from the court reporter William Sharp, and an exhibit of photographs of Robert Moses&#x27;s work. During the 2010s, temporary exhibits included collections of World&#x27;s Fair artifacts. When the museum reopened after the COVID-19 pandemic, it hosted exhibitions about the concept of home, the photographer Bruce Davidson, and children&#x27;s art.

== Programs and outreach ==
The Queens Museum has run numerous outreach programs for the surrounding community. In the 1970s, it offered a free art program for local youth. The museum also hosted Latin American cultural events and arts-education activities during the 1990s. When the museum building was closed during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Queens Museum organized a food pantry for residents of the surrounding neighborhood. The museum launched an activist program for teens, the Queens Teens Institute for Art and Social Justice, in 2023.

The Queens Museum has also been involved in community projects. These have included the restoration of Corona Plaza, a public plaza near the New York City Subway&#x27;s 103rd Street–Corona Plaza station, in the early 21st century. Starting in 2004, the museum helped sponsor the Queens Culture Trolley, which traveled between Flushing Meadows and the neighborhoods of Corona and Jackson Heights.

== Operation ==

=== Management ===
The museum is operated by the Queens Museum of Art, which is classified as a 501(c)(3) organization since 1972. , Queens Museum&#x27;s director is Sally Tallant. In the 1970s, the Queens Museum was part of the Flushing Arts Council, a group of Flushing cultural institutions that also included Flushing Town Hall and Queens Botanical Garden.

=== Attendance and funding ===
The museum accommodated 60,000 or 100,000 annual visitors in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Roughly half of visitors came as part of school field trips. By the 2010s, the museum had 200,000 annual visitors; prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the museum accommodated 30,000 students annually. In 2020, the Queens Museum made admission free for all visitors, and the museum instead operates on a pay what you want model.

When the museum opened, it sold annual memberships. Members received regular newsletters and bulletins, and the museum also hosted member-only events and exhibition previews. , the Queens Museum sells four tiers of memberships, and the museum hosts member-only publications, events, and exhibition previews. The Queens Museum is also part of the Culture Pass program, whose members can enter for free.

In the 1970s, the museum&#x27;s annual operating budget totaled $150,000, of which four-fifths came from the New York City government. The budget grew steadily during the 1970s and 1980s, reaching $2 million by 1989. During the 1990s, the museum had an operating budget of $1.8 million, and seven-tenths of the budget was funded by the city or other public sources. For the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2022, the Queens Museum recorded total revenue of $6.38 million, expenses of $6.59 million, assets of $36.6 million, and liabilities of $364,000.

<text>William Henry Pitt (17 July 1937 – 17 November 2017) was a British politician. A Liberal Member of Parliament between 1981 and 1983, he was the first candidate elected to Parliament under the banner of the SDP–Liberal Alliance.

==Early life==
Pitt was born on Brixton Hill, South London in 1937. His family later moved to Upper Norwood, where he attended Heath Clark School, followed by the London Nautical School and South Bank Polytechnic where he studied to be a Lighting Engineer. He spent some time in Wales working on a farm and learning to play the tuba, prior to his National Service in the Royal Army Service Corps. His initial political allegiance was to the Conservatives; he was Chairman of South Norwood Young Conservatives from 1959 to 1960. He joined the Liberal Party in the 1960s. He had a keen interest in theatre and music from his teens onwards, and was offered a place in Leslie Crowther&#x27;s Repertory Company aged 16, which he was unable to take up. He had an abiding love for and interest in France, French film and French language engendered by his teacher Arthur Birtles; French was his second language. The rest of his education did not match up to Mr Birtles&#x27; standards, but his passion for learning and self-education continued throughout his life.

==Liberal politics==
In the 1970s, Pitt worked as a local government officer for Lambeth London Borough Council. Whilst working as an Environmental Health Officer in the Mayall &amp; Railton Roads Housing Action Area of Brixton he became Chair of Lambeth NALGO. He stood as Liberal candidate for Croydon North West in February 1974 obtaining 23% of the vote. He stood again in the October election, but this time, the vote for most Liberal Candidates declined, including his own. In the 1979 general election he, like 60% of Liberal candidates in London and 50% overall, lost his deposit. He was, however, popular within the party and served as Chairman of the London Liberal Party and as a member of the Liberal Party National Executive Committee and the Party Council from 1977 until 1981. He took on the editorship of Radical Bulletin following Peter Hain&#x27;s move to Labour. Pitt unsuccessfully stood for the Greater London Council seat of Brent East in 1977 and Croydon North West in 1981.

==By-election==
When the Conservative MP Robert Taylor died, who had represented Croydon North-West since 1970, Pitt was quickly chosen as the prospective Liberal candidate for the following by-election. As a bearded local government officer, Pitt looked more like a stereotypical Liberal Party member, unrepresentative of the newly formed Social Democratic Party, which was working in alliance with the Liberals. The choice of Pitt as by-election candidate was resisted by some senior members of the party, who were keen to give the SDP a chance to win its first Parliamentary election (potentially with a big name like Shirley Williams as the candidate), but Pitt and the local Liberal Association were insistent, and there was no way to force them to cede the candidature. He had &quot;nursed&quot; the seat since 1974 and was the approved Candidate at national, regional and local level. Considerable pressure was put on the CNW Committee, especially on Alan Mead—Chairman at the time—who was also at the time Chair of Croydon CHE (which prompted a &quot;Guardian&quot; article entitled &quot;the queering of Croydon&quot;), as well as the Regional Party. The Liberal Party Council of 17 July 1981 further endorsed Pitt and thus put an end to any speculation or manipulation.

Pitt was elected at the Croydon North West by-election on 22 October 1981 with a majority of 3,254 (standing as &quot;Liberal with SDP support&quot;). During the campaign, posters summed up the relationship between the two parties as &quot;The Alliance&quot; and the term stuck as the official name thereafter, although it had originally been intended as a stopgap slogan. Pitt&#x27;s was the first in a sequence of SDP-Liberal by-election victories during the period when support for the Labour Party was at a low ebb. Pitt&#x27;s win delighted Liberal leader David Steel who said after the result was known that the party had won a greater majority than they had expected. Pitt himself claimed that his victory showed that the Alliance had &quot;caught the imagination of the voters&quot; and that as consequence there were &quot;no longer any safe seats for Tory or Labour in the country.&quot;

==Parliament==
He served in the House of Commons as Liberal Home Affairs Spokesman and led for the Alliance throughout the first Police and Criminal Evidence Bill, which fell when Margaret Thatcher called a general election. Pitt lost his seat to the Conservative, Humfrey Malins, in the 1983 general election. He fought two further elections for the Liberals in South Thanet in 1987 and 1992.

==Later career==
Taking a break from campaigning, Bill took a degree in Classics and Philosophy at Polytechnic of North London, graduating with a BA in 1987, achieving his long-held wish. Like many of his generation and class from South London, his education was generally poor, and he left school at 16 with one O Level in spite of his clear intelligence.

Bill and his wife Janet moved to Broadstairs in 1988, becoming quickly involved in the local community. In 1996, Pitt joined the Labour Party, disillusioned with the Liberal Democrats (which had been formed by the merger of the Alliance parties) and concerned with preventing Jonathan Aitken holding his seat in Thanet South. He campaigned for Labour in Thanet and for Malcolm Wicks in Croydon North in the 1997 general election.

He retired from full-time employment in August 2003, having been Head of Training for the Canary Wharf Group, where he set up a Construction Apprenticeship Programme, initiating and embedding a training programme for all staff; he well understood the value of lifelong learning to improve personal wellbeing and improve society.

In 2005, he became editor of the &quot;Norwood Review&quot;, the newsletter of the Norwood Society.

Following retirement, he became Chairman of the Occupational Pensioners Alliance. He was a member of the Methodist Church for over 55 years and was latterly Senior Steward for Canterbury &amp; East Kent Methodist Circuit. He became a senior member of the Academy FM Thanet news team after joining the station in 2013, and was a helpful mentor to less experienced colleagues. Pitt loved radio and the opportunities it gave him to interview politicians, alongside local and international artists (including Grayson Perry, a favourite) as well as highlighting community activity.

His hobbies included photography, while music was a lifelong enthusiasm: his tastes embraced folk, classical, jazz and many more recent genres, including punk. He sang in choirs for over 50 years, including latterly the Amici Choir (part of Canterbury Cantata Trust). He was a keen and active member of Thanet University of the Third Age (Thanet U3A).

Pitt died late on 17 November 2017 in Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Hospital, Margate after a short illness, leaving his wife Janet and daughter Jane. He was 80.

<text>Forti Corse, commonly known as Forti, was an Italian motor racing team chiefly known for its brief and unsuccessful involvement in Formula One in the mid-1990s. It was established in the late 1970s and competed in lower formulae for two decades. The team&#x27;s successes during this period included four Drivers&#x27; Championships in Italian Formula Three during the 1980s, and race wins in the International Formula 3000 championship, in which it competed from 1987 to 1994. From 1992, team co-founder Guido Forti developed a relationship with the wealthy Brazilian businessman Abílio dos Santos Diniz that gave Diniz&#x27;s racing driver son, Pedro, a permanent seat in the team and the outfit a sufficiently high budget to consider entering Formula One.

Forti graduated to Formula One as a constructor and entrant in , but its first car—the Forti FG01—proved to be uncompetitive, and the team failed to score a point. Despite this setback, Forti was committed to a three-year deal with Diniz, which was broken when Pedro moved to the Ligier team prior to the 1996 season, taking most of the team&#x27;s sponsorship money with him. Nevertheless, Forti continued to compete in the sport, and produced the much-improved FG03 chassis, before succumbing to financial problems mid-season after an ultimately fruitless deal with a mysterious entity known as Shannon Racing. The team competed in a total of 27 Grands Prix, scoring no points, and is recognised as one of the last truly privateer teams to race in an era when many large car manufacturers were increasing their involvement in the sport.

==Establishment and early years==
Forti was founded by Italian businessmen Guido Forti, a former driver, and Paolo Guerci, an engineer, in the late 1970s and was based in Alessandria in northern Italy. It was registered as a &quot;Società a Responsabilità Limitata&quot;, or Limited liability company. It was initially run in lower motor racing categories such as Formula Ford and Formula Three, both at Italian and European levels. The team was well equipped and soon became a regular winner. Forti drivers Franco Forini, Enrico Bertaggia, Emanuele Naspetti and Gianni Morbidelli (who would all go on to drive in Formula One) won Italian Formula Three titles in 1985, 1987, 1988 and 1989 respectively. In addition, Bertaggia won the prestigious Macau F3 Grand Prix and the Monaco Grand Prix F3 support race in 1988, and Morbidelli won the FIA European Formula Three Cup in 1989. Teo Fabi and Oscar Larrauri also raced for the team in its early years, the former winning the Italian FFord 2000 championship in 1977, and the latter racing as far afield as South America, in the Argentine Formula Three Championship. Forti continued racing in Formula Three until the end of 1992, when it quit the formula in order to concentrate solely on International Formula 3000.

==Formula 3000==
For 1987, Forti moved up to International Formula 3000 with less immediate success than experienced in Formula Three. The main reason for this was the chassis the team chose to compete with. Instead of using customer Lolas, Marches or Ralts, all of which were produced by established companies who had many years&#x27; experience of designing and building such cars, Forti stuck with their Italian Formula Three chassis supplier Giampaolo Dallara, who had just designed his company&#x27;s first F3000 machine. Forti was the first team to use this machine, which was dubbed the Dallara 3087 (a chassis which later would make a single appearance in Formula One for the BMS Scuderia Italia team, as that team&#x27;s car was not ready for the first race of the 1988 season). This combination of an inexperienced team and an untested car did not score any points in its first F3000 year, nor did the team attend every race on the schedule. Forti used 1988 to gain valuable experience in F3000, and this helped the team to perform better in following seasons, as did a change to more competitive Lola and then Reynard chassis.

After a full season in 1988 and the team&#x27;s first championship points, courtesy of Claudio Langes in 1989, it became apparent that Forti was improving as a competitive force. In 1990, Gianni Morbidelli scored Forti&#x27;s first victory in an F3000 race, and although no Forti driver won a championship title in this category, the team established itself as a frequent front-runner, scoring nine wins and five pole positions in International F3000. From 1993 onwards, Forti concentrated solely on F3000, and ran drivers such as Naspetti, Fabrizio Giovanardi, Andrea Montermini and Hideki Noda. 1991 was Forti&#x27;s most successful season in F3000, with Naspetti finishing third in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, ten points behind champion Christian Fittipaldi. Although the team&#x27;s form dipped over subsequent years, by 1994 Forti was the most experienced team in the championship, employing Noda and Pedro Diniz as drivers.

==Formula One==

===Preparation===
As his team became more successful, Guido Forti started to think about a move upwards, into Formula One. However, there had been several discouragingly recent examples of teams, such as Coloni and Onyx, which had graduated from F3000 into Formula One and failed more or less immediately due to a lack of finance. Conversely, Eddie Jordan had shown that the move could be made successfully, with an impressive performance in with his Jordan team, which had finished fifth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship with a total of seven points-scoring finishes. Forti considered a solid financial base to be the most important factor for success. In 1991 he therefore started working on his Formula One project. At the end of , he signed a deal with wealthy Brazilian driver Pedro Diniz, whose personal fortune and sponsorship connections proved invaluable in increasing the team&#x27;s budget. Diniz&#x27;s father, Abílio dos Santos, was the owner of the large Brazilian distribution company Companhia Brasileira de Distribuição and the supermarket chain Pão de Açúcar. By offering companies preferential product-placement in the Brazilian market, the Diniz family was able to obtain personal sponsorship deals with brands such as Arisco, Duracell, Gillette, Kaiser, Marlboro, Parmalat and Sadia, in addition to backing from Unibanco, to fund Pedro&#x27;s career. By , through Abílio dos Santos, Forti met Carlo Gancia, an Italo-Brazilian businessman. Gancia became a co-owner of the team, buying Guerci&#x27;s shares, and started working on the team&#x27;s Formula One project. He finally managed to ensure a respectable budget for Formula One by late , which was &quot;effectively underwritten by the Diniz family&quot;. He also hired several experienced personnel, including designer Sergio Rinland and former Ferrari team manager Cesare Fiorio. Furthermore, retired driver René Arnoux was employed as a consultant and driver coach for Diniz. Guerci remained with Forti as one of its race engineers.

This securing of financial assistance and recruitment of staff meant that Forti&#x27;s ability to participate in Formula One for was assured. Financed by the companies brought in by Abílio Diniz, the team was guaranteed financial stability in the short term, with a claimed first year budget of around $17 million. In addition, this was only the first year of a planned three-year contract with Diniz and his backers.

===Forti FG01 car===

The hardest task for the team was designing and building its own car for the first time, instead of buying one from a general supplier such as Dallara or Lola, as was required by the Formula One Technical Regulations. Guido Forti&#x27;s first attempt at an F1 chassis, the Forti FG01, resulted in an outdated, overweight and very slow machine, and has been described as nothing more than &quot;a revised F3000 car&quot; and, more harshly, &quot;a fearful pile of junk&quot;.

The FG01 had many influences. Design consultant Rinland had previously worked on the Brabham BT60 chassis in and Fondmetal GR02 chassis in , the latter under the auspices of his own company, Astauto, before moving to the United States to work on a Champ Car project. In late 1994, Forti bought the remaining assets of the now defunct Fondmetal team, including the remaining GR02 chassis, and requested Rinland&#x27;s assistance in developing the bespoke Forti chassis based on a planned Fondmetal chassis for the season. Rinland thus provided a great deal of input on the FG01 chassis, assisting experienced Italian engineers Giorgio Stirano and Giacomo Caliri in designing and building the car. The car&#x27;s aerodynamics were completed by former Brabham, Fondmetal and Astauto employee Hans Fouche using wind tunnels in South Africa, and composite work was done by the Belco Avia company. However, it was rumoured that the FG01 was little more than a re-working of the GR02.

Thus the FG01 did not promise much in terms of performance. It was angular and bulky, with poor aerodynamic performance negatively affecting grip and handling; it had a plump nose, initially no airbox, and was overweight and under-powered, using a small Ford-Cosworth ED V8 customer engine largely financed by Ford do Brasil, which developed an estimated 100 bhp less than the most powerful engine in the field, the Renault V10 supplied to the Benetton and Williams teams. It was also the only car to have a manual gearbox in the 1995 F1 season. The car was liveried in a distinctive yellow-and-blue colour scheme accompanied by fluorescent green wheel-rims, illustrating the team&#x27;s Brazilian influence in its first year. The precise hue of each colour was chosen as a tribute to Ayrton Senna, who had been killed at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix; the cars were liveried in identical shades to those used on the Brazilian&#x27;s helmet design.

===1995 season===
Forti&#x27;s number one driver for the season was rookie Pedro Diniz who had raced for Forti in F3000, but without much success. However, he was guaranteed a seat as his family and sponsors were paying a significant amount of the team&#x27;s budget. The second driver was later confirmed as his more experienced compatriot Roberto Moreno, who had last competed in F1 back in when he had a disastrous year driving for the infamous Andrea Moda team. However, his seat was initially only guaranteed on a race-by-race basis, as Portuguese driver Pedro Lamy, in addition to the team&#x27;s former F3000 drivers Emanuele Naspetti and Andrea Montermini, were also considered. It was speculated that whoever joined the team would be contractually bound to be number two to Diniz and that his father had insisted on an all-Brazilian driver line-up. A Forti spokesman indeed confirmed that Moreno&#x27;s nationality, in addition to his experience, was the main reason for his selection. The team later attempted to enter its former F3000 driver Hideki Noda for the 1995 Pacific Grand Prix, but he was refused an FIA Super Licence despite driving in three races for Larrousse in 1994.

Unlike some of the existing teams, Forti was able to test its chassis extensively prior to the start of the season. However, Diniz proved to be around seven seconds per lap off the pace of the leading runners in group testing at the Estoril circuit in March, indicating that the team was likely to be mired at the back of the field. Diniz finished 10th in the season-opening Brazilian GP, but was seven laps down on winner Michael Schumacher. In Argentina, this situation became worse, as, although both drivers finished, they were both nine laps down on winner Damon Hill at the end of the race (with Diniz ahead) and neither were classified, as they had failed to complete 90% of the race distance. The drivers&#x27; similar fastest laps during the race were over ten seconds slower than Schumacher&#x27;s fastest race lap, and almost five seconds slower than the next slowest runner&#x27;s fastest lap (Domenico Schiattarella in the Simtek). Imola was similarly poor, as both drivers finished seven laps down (with Diniz again ahead) and again failed to reach the 90 per cent threshold for classification. Forti was already the butt of paddock jokes, and were far slower than the other (and financially poorer) backmarkers: Pacific, Simtek, and Minardi. However, the budget enabled improvements to be made to the car. During the season, its weight was reduced by a significant 60 kilograms (approximately 10 per cent of the F1 minimum weight limit of ), and a semi-automatic gearbox, an airbox and redesigns of the front wing, sidepods and monocoque were introduced. The personnel count also doubled during the course of the season. This resulted in a gradual improvement in pace throughout the year, and there were no more non-classified finishes.

In between the Brazilian and Argentine Grands Prix, Rinland returned to Europe full-time to take the official post of the team&#x27;s Technical Director. His long-term task was to establish an English-based design office for the team, but his initial job was to improve the competitiveness of the FG01 through a series of technical upgrades. However, Rinland subsequently left the team after a few weeks, after falling out with the team&#x27;s management over the car&#x27;s lack of competitiveness.

Indeed, Forti&#x27;s finishing record was good for rookies at 50 per cent (excluding the non-classifications), helping Diniz to establish a reputation as a steady, dependable driver. Forti were then elevated when Simtek folded after the Monaco GP, and Pacific&#x27;s lack of finance and development enabled Forti to start matching them from the half-way point of the season. At the German GP, both Fortis outqualified both the Pacifics for the first time, and this happened on two further occasions during 1995. Forti&#x27;s improvement was also aided by Pacific taking on two slower pay drivers, Giovanni Lavaggi and Jean-Denis Délétraz, to ensure that the team finished the season. At the final race of the season, in Adelaide, Forti seemed to have established a firm base for the season, emphasised by Moreno qualifying within 107% of pole position for the first time – a crucial result, as this percentage of the pole time would be used to determine non-qualifiers in 1996 – and Diniz scoring the team&#x27;s best result in F1, with a reliable run to seventh place, ahead of Gachot in the Pacific. This was only one position behind the points-scoring placings. Nevertheless, despite not scoring any points, Forti finished a &quot;de facto&quot; 11th in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, ahead of Pacific and Simtek by virtue of better finishes outside of the points.

Post-championship, Forti took part in the 1995 Bologna Motor Show, where three FG01s—driven by Montermini, Lavaggi and Vittorio Zoboli—raced against, and lost to three Minardis in the Formula One Indoor Trophy.

Despite the progress made by Forti during the course of the season, 1995 was still regarded as a failure. The team had spent more money than its immediate rivals in designing, building and developing a fundamentally inefficient car. Diniz and his sponsors were described as &quot;throwing their money away&quot;, and the Brazilian&#x27;s reputation as a serious F1 driver was damaged, as it took him several years to prove that he was not just in the sport because of his funding. In addition, Moreno&#x27;s participation with Forti was lamented by many observers, who felt that the experienced driver did not deserve the ignominy of such an uncompetitive car. The only positives were the reasonable reliability record and the fact that the Diniz family were contracted to fund the team for the next two years.

===1996 season===
With a solid base to build on and a healthy budget, looked promising for Forti. The team negotiated for the most powerful and expensive Cosworth V8 engines in late 1995 to replace the outdated and underpowered ED models, and its financial security was demonstrated by rumours during the 1995 season that the more competitive but less well-funded Minardi team was considering a merger with Forti as a means of maintaining its own presence in the sport. However, these aspirations were dealt a devastating blow when Pedro Diniz signed for the more competitive Ligier team, taking Martin Brundle&#x27;s vacated seat as the latter moved to Jordan. Forti&#x27;s sponsors brought in by the Diniz family, including Parmalat and Marlboro, all left; the budget was significantly dented. For a time it seemed that the team would not compete in 1996 at all, and its survival was constantly questioned. The new car was delayed, and the team was forced to use the uprated FG01B car for the start of the season with the only slightly more competitive Ford Zetec-R V8 engine (instead of the &quot;JS&quot; unit it had been negotiating for), and to rely on temporary sponsors. Nevertheless, Forti remained in the sport for the 1996 season. Moreno was not retained; the team signed Minardi and Pacific refugees Luca Badoer and Montermini to take the two empty seats (although Hideki Noda was also considered), both drivers bringing a small amount of personal backing. Frenchman Franck Lagorce was also signed as a test driver. Pacific had folded during the off-season, and it was clear that Forti would be some way behind the rest of the field in the slow FG01B. Badoer and Montermini failed to make the new 107 per cent cut in qualifying for the and thus did not start the race, but both then managed to qualify for the Grands Prix held in Brazil and Argentina, scoring a 10th- and an 11th-place finish between them in the races. Badoer, however, attracted attention in Argentina for a different reason. As Diniz attempted to lap him, the two collided and Badoer&#x27;s car flipped over; the Italian escaping injury. Both cars then failed to qualify at the Nürburgring.

Forti produced a new chassis, the FG03, for the next race of the season in Imola. It had been designed by the same personnel as the previous year, with further work carried out by George Ryton after the latter moved to the team from Ferrari and took up the post of Technical Director mid-season. Both drivers judged it a significant improvement over the old car, with increased aerodynamic downforce and directional sensitivity, but there was only one FG03 available, and Montermini failed to qualify in the old car. Badoer, however, qualified last, but comfortably within the 107 per cent cut-off, and only 0.7s behind Ricardo Rosset in the Footwork. Badoer finished 10th and last, but had suffered reliability problems in the new car and was two laps behind Pedro Lamy&#x27;s Minardi. Both drivers qualified in Monaco, but Montermini crashed in the wet warm-up session and did not start the race, whilst Badoer struggled in the slippery conditions and took out Jacques Villeneuve as he was being lapped by the Williams. He was fined $5000 and received a two-race suspended ban.

===Deal with Shannon Racing===

After the Monaco GP, there were rumours that Forti would not survive the season without some form of takeover. In the period before the next race, the Spanish GP, Belco Avia boss Arron Colombo announced that a deal had been reached between Guido Forti and an entity known as Shannon Racing for the latter to buy a 51 per cent share of the team. The deal was concluded later in the month, on June 30. Shannon Racing and its parent company FinFirst were Irish-registered sections of a Milanese financial group, and had already established teams in various Formula Three championships and in International Formula 3000 in 1996. The group was keen to move into Formula One, and Forti provided an opportunity for this to happen. It was believed that Colombo had organised the deal, which was scheduled to continue throughout 1996 with an option for , because Belco Avia was owed money by Forti. As part of the management change, Cesare Fiorio left the team to join Ligier and was replaced by Daniele Coronna, whilst designer George Ryton joined from Ferrari.

For the Spanish GP, the cars therefore appeared in a new green-white-red livery (based on the Italian flag), apparently confirming Shannon Racing&#x27;s acquisition of 51 per cent of Forti. This financial boost appeared to ensure the team&#x27;s survival. With the off-track confusion, both drivers again failed to qualify. Nevertheless, at the Canadian and French Grands Prix, both Fortis made it to the grid, Badoer even outqualifying Rosset in Montréal. However, Forti had lost its good 1995 reliability record, as these starts only resulted in four retirements. By this time, Forti&#x27;s financial problems, caused by a conflict of team ownership between Guido Forti and Shannon Racing, were becoming increasingly urgent in nature. Both cars retired with &quot;engine problems&quot; at the French GP, although it was widely rumoured that this was due to the team running out of engine mileage as it went into debt with engine suppliers Cosworth.

===Bankruptcy and withdrawal===
Guido Forti alleged that Shannon Racing had not paid him any money within the stipulated six-day deadline after the deal was concluded and refuted the claim that it now owned 51 per cent of his team. As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether it would turn up at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time quick enough to qualify. This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and was running out of engine mileage for its cars, only having enough to make a token effort at participation. The team made it to the next race – the German GP – but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.

Guido Forti, after discussing the matter with commercial rights-owner Bernie Ecclestone, had decided to withdraw the team from the German GP as negotiations over the team&#x27;s ownership between himself and Shannon continued, despite the threat of the FIA (F1&#x27;s governing body) imposing a fine on the outfit for missing the race. Following the failure of these negotiations, he then announced that Shannon&#x27;s deal had fallen through and that he was back in charge of the team. He hoped to finalise some more sponsorship deals which would allow Forti to compete in the Hungarian GP. Shannon responded by claiming it still owned 51 per cent of the team, and that it intended to solve Forti&#x27;s financial problems itself, in addition to replacing Guido Forti as Team Principal. He duly took the company to court over the matter, an arduous process in the Italian legal system.

With the team in limbo whilst the ownership dispute was judged, Forti&#x27;s situation was bleak. The team faced the prospect of further heavy FIA-imposed fines for missing races if the situation did not improve, or even exclusion from the championship for bringing the sport into disrepute, as had happened to the Andrea Moda team in . Forti withdrew his team from the sport; it did not make an appearance at the Hungarian GP, the Belgian GP, nor at any further point in the championship. Badoer and Montermini were left without drives, and the promising FG03 chassis would no longer race. By the time Shannon Racing won the court case in September, Forti had ceased to exist. Shannon Racing&#x27;s teams in the lower motorsport categories also closed down. Coincidentally, Guido Forti had signed the 1997 Concorde Agreement shortly before his team&#x27;s demise, which could have given his team a chance of surviving if it had made it into that year due to the extra television revenue that was duly granted to each of the teams under the terms of the agreement.

==Legacy==
Forti&#x27;s withdrawal marked not only the end of its participation in Formula One, but also terminated a team which had enjoyed success in International Formula 3000 and other minor categories. It is generally agreed that Forti may have succeeded if it had its 1995 budget and the FG03 car at the same time, and that Diniz&#x27;s departure meant that it stood little chance of survival, but the team has become another example of a small, backmarking team unable to finance its aspirations. One of the final &quot;privateer&quot; teams to enter the sport in an era of increasing influence and participation from the large car manufacturers, Forti is often cited along with Pacific and Simtek as prime examples of this tendency. It was also argued that the increasing amount of money involved in financing an F1 team which was forcing many of the smaller teams to withdraw in the early to mid-1990s was a long-term threat to the future of the sport. Alternatively, some saw Forti and similar tail-enders as undeserving of a place in F1, and it has been suggested that the imposition of the 107 per cent rule by the FIA in 1996 was a move to force them to raise their game or leave the sport altogether.

However, the Forti F1 cars have since been used for other purposes. Examples of the FG03 are currently being used as part of F1-themed track days in the United Kingdom at motor racing circuits such as Rockingham.

<text>A propelling nozzle is a nozzle that converts the internal energy of a working gas into propulsive force; it is the nozzle, which forms a jet, that separates a gas turbine, or gas generator, from a jet engine.

Propelling nozzles accelerate the available gas to subsonic, transonic, or supersonic velocities depending on the power setting of the engine, their internal shape and the pressures at entry to, and exit from, the nozzle. The internal shape may be convergent or convergent-divergent (C-D). C-D nozzles can accelerate the jet to supersonic velocities within the divergent section, whereas a convergent nozzle cannot accelerate the jet beyond sonic speed.

Propelling nozzles may have a fixed geometry, or they may have variable geometry to give different exit areas to control the operation of the engine when equipped with an afterburner or a reheat system. When afterburning engines are equipped with a C-D nozzle the throat area is variable. Nozzles for supersonic flight speeds, at which high nozzle pressure ratios are generated, also have variable area divergent sections. Turbofan engines may have an additional and separate propelling nozzle which further accelerates the bypass air. 

Propelling nozzles also act as downstream restrictors, the consequences of which constitute an important aspect of engine design.

==Principles of operation==
* A nozzle operates according to the Venturi effect to bring the exhaust gasses to ambient pressure, while forming them into a propulsive jet; if the pressure upstream of the nozzle is high enough, the flow will reach sonic speed (choke). The role of the nozzle in back-pressuring the engine is explained below.
* The energy to accelerate the stream comes from the temperature and pressure of the gas. The gas expands adiabatically with low losses and hence high efficiency. The gas accelerates to a final exit velocity which depends on the pressure and temperature at entry to the nozzle, the ambient pressure it exhausts to (unless the flow is choked), and the efficiency of the expansion. The efficiency is a measure of the losses due to friction, non-axial divergence as well as leakage in C-D nozzles.
* Airbreathing engines create forward thrust on the airframe by imparting a net rearward momentum to the exhaust gas. If thrust exceeds the resistance incurred by the aircraft moving through the air, it will accelerate. The jet may or may not be fully expanded.
* On some engines that are equipped with an afterburner the nozzle area is varied during non-afterburning or dry thrust conditions. Typically the nozzle is fully open for starting and at idle. It may then close down as the thrust lever is advanced reaching its minimum area before or at the Military or maximum dry thrust setting. Two examples of this control are the General Electric J-79 and the Klimov RD-33 in the MIG-29. Reasons for varying the nozzle area are explained in section: Nozzle area control during dry operation.

==Principal geometries==
===Convergent nozzle===
Convergent nozzles are used on many jet engines. If the nozzle pressure ratio is above the critical value (about 1.8:1) a convergent nozzle will choke, resulting in some of the expansion to atmospheric pressure taking place downstream of the throat (i.e., smallest flow area), in the jet wake. Although jet momentum still produces much of the gross thrust, the imbalance between the throat static pressure and atmospheric pressure still generates some (pressure) thrust.

===Divergent nozzle===
The supersonic speed of the air flowing into a scramjet allows the use of a simple diverging nozzle

===Convergent-divergent (C-D) nozzle===

Engines capable of supersonic flight have convergent-divergent exhaust duct features to generate supersonic flow. Rocket engines — the extreme case — owe their distinctive shape to the very high area ratios of their nozzles.

When the pressure ratio across a convergent nozzle exceeds a critical value, the flow chokes, and thus the pressure of the exhaust exiting the engine exceeds the pressure of the surrounding air and cannot decrease via the conventional Venturi effect. This reduces the thrust producing efficiency of the nozzle by causing much of the expansion to take place downstream of the nozzle itself. Consequently, rocket engines and jet engines for supersonic flight incorporate a C-D nozzle which permits further expansion against the inside of the nozzle. However, unlike the &quot;fixed&quot; convergent-divergent nozzle used on a conventional rocket motor, those on turbojet engines must have heavy and expensive variable geometry to cope with the great variation in nozzle pressure ratio that occurs with speeds from subsonic to over Mach3.

Nonetheless, low area ratio nozzles have subsonic applications.

==Types of nozzle==
===Fixed-area nozzle===
Non-afterburning subsonic engines have nozzles of a fixed size because the changes in engine performance with altitude and subsonic flight speeds are acceptable with a fixed nozzle.
This is not the case at supersonic speeds as described for Concorde below.

====With low area ratio====
At the other extreme, some high bypass ratio civil turbofans control the fan working line by using a convergent-divergent nozzle with an extremely low (less than 1.01) area ratio on the bypass (or mixed exhaust) stream. At low airspeeds, such a setup causes the nozzle to act as if it had variable geometry by preventing it from choking and allowing it to accelerate and decelerate exhaust gas approaching the throat and divergent section, respectively. Consequently, the nozzle exit area controls the fan match, which, being larger than the throat, pulls the fan working line slightly away from surge. At higher flight speeds, the ram rise in the intake chokes the throat and causes the nozzle&#x27;s area to dictate the fan match; the nozzle, being smaller than the exit, causes the throat to push the fan working line slightly toward surge. This is not a problem, however, for a fan&#x27;s surge margin is much greater at high flight speeds.

====In rockets (with high area ratio)====
Rocket motors also employ convergent-divergent nozzles, but these are usually of fixed geometry, to minimize weight. Because of the high pressure ratios associated with rocket flight, rocket motor convergent-divergent nozzles have a much greater area ratio (exit/throat) than those fitted to jet engines.
===Variable-area for afterburning===
The afterburners on combat aircraft require a bigger nozzle to prevent adversely affecting the operation of the engine. The variable area iris nozzle consists of a series of moving, overlapping petals with a nearly circular nozzle cross-section and is convergent to control the operation of the engine. If the aircraft is to fly at supersonic speeds, the afterburner nozzle may be followed by a separate divergent nozzle in an ejector nozzle configuration, as below, or the divergent geometry may be incorporated with the afterburner nozzle in the variable geometry convergent-divergent nozzle configuration, as below.

Early afterburners were either on or off and used a 2-position clamshell, or eyelid, nozzle which gave only one area available for afterburning use.

===Ejector===
Ejector refers to the pumping action of the very hot, high speed, engine exhaust entraining (ejecting) a surrounding airflow which, together with the internal geometry of the secondary, or diverging, nozzle controls the expansion of the engine exhaust. At subsonic speeds, the airflow constricts the exhaust to a convergent shape. When afterburning is selected and the aircraft speeds up, the two nozzles dilate, which allows the exhaust to form a convergent-divergent shape, speeding the exhaust gasses past Mach1. More complex engine installations use a tertiary airflow to reduce exit area at low speeds. Advantages of the ejector nozzle are relative simplicity and reliability in cases where the secondary nozzle flaps are positioned by pressure forces. The ejector nozzle is also able to use air which has been ingested by the intake but which is not required by the engine. The amount of this air varies significantly across the flight envelope and ejector nozzles are well suited to matching the airflow between the intake system and engine. Efficient use of this air in the nozzle was a prime requirement for aircraft that had to cruise efficiently at high supersonic speeds for prolonged periods, hence its use in the SR-71, Concorde and XB-70 Valkyrie.

A simple example of ejector nozzle is the fixed geometry cylindrical shroud surrounding the afterburning nozzle on the J85 installation in the T-38 Talon. More complex were the arrangements used for the J58 (SR-71) and TF-30 (F-111) installations. They both used tertiary blow-in doors (open at lower speeds) and free-floating overlapping flaps for a final nozzle. Both the blow-in doors and the final nozzle flaps are positioned by a balance of internal pressure from the engine exhaust and external pressure from the aircraft flowfield.

On early J79 installations (F-104, F-4, A-5 Vigilante), actuation of the secondary nozzle was mechanically linked to the afterburner nozzle. Later installations had the final nozzle mechanically actuated separately from the afterburner nozzle. This gave improved efficiency (better match of primary/secondary exit area with high Mach number requirement) at Mach2 (B-58 Hustler) and Mach3 (XB-70).

===Variable-geometry convergent-divergent===
Turbofan installations which do not require a secondary airflow to be pumped by the engine exhaust use the variable geometry C-D nozzle. These engines don&#x27;t require the external cooling air needed by turbojets (hot afterburner casing).

The divergent nozzle may be an integral part of the afterburner nozzle petal, an angled extension after the throat. The petals travel along curved tracks and the axial translation and simultaneous rotation increases the throat area for afterburning, while the trailing portion becomes a divergence with bigger exit area for more complete expansion at higher speeds. An example is the TF-30 (F-14).

The primary and secondary petals may be hinged together and actuated by the same mechanism to provide afterburner control and high nozzle pressure ratio expansion as on the EJ200 (Eurofighter). Other examples are found on the F-15, F-16, B-1B.

===Additional features===
====Thrust-vectoring====
Nozzles for vectored thrust include fixed geometry Bristol Siddeley Pegasus and variable geometry F119 (F-22).

====Thrust-reversing====

The thrust reversers on some engines are incorporated into the nozzle itself and are known as target thrust reversers. The nozzle opens up in two halves which come together to redirect the exhaust partially forward. Since the nozzle area has an influence on the operation of the engine (see below), the deployed thrust reverser has to be spaced the correct distance from the jetpipe to prevent changes in engine operating limits. Examples of target thrust reversers are found on the Fokker 100, Gulfstream IV and Dassault F7X.

====Noise-reducing====
Jet noise may be reduced by adding features to the exit of the nozzle which increase the surface area of the cylindrical jet. Commercial turbojets and early by-pass engines typically split the jet into multiple lobes. Modern high by-pass turbofans have triangular serrations, called chevrons, which protrude slightly into the propelling jet.

==Further topics==
===The other purpose of the propelling nozzle===
The nozzle, by virtue of setting the back-pressure, acts as a downstream restrictor to the compressor, and thus determines what goes into the front of the engine. It shares this function with the other downstream restrictor, the turbine nozzle. The areas of both the propelling nozzle and turbine nozzle set the mass flow through the engine and the maximum pressure. While both these areas are fixed in many engines (i.e. those with a simple fixed propelling nozzle), others, most notably those with afterburning, have a variable area propelling nozzle. This area variation is necessary to contain the disturbing effect on the engine of the high combustion temperatures in the jet pipe, though the area may also be varied during non-afterburning operation to alter the pumping performance of the compressor at lower thrust settings.

For example, if the propelling nozzle were to be removed to convert a turbojet into a turboshaft, the role played by the nozzle area is now taken by the area of the power turbine nozzle guide vanes or stators.

===Reasons for C-D nozzle over-expansion and examples===
Overexpansion occurs when the exit area is too big relative to the size of the afterburner, or primary, nozzle. This occurred under certain conditions on the J85 installation in the T-38. The secondary or final nozzle was a fixed geometry sized for the maximum afterburner case. At non-afterburner thrust settings the exit area was too big for the closed engine nozzle giving over-expansion. Free-floating doors were added to the ejector allowing secondary air to control the primary jet expansion.

===Reasons for C-D nozzle under-expansion and examples===
For complete expansion to ambient pressure, and hence maximum nozzle thrust or efficiency, the required area ratio increases with flight Mach number. If the divergence is too short giving too small an exit area the exhaust will not expand to ambient pressure in the nozzle and there will be lost thrust potential With increasing Mach number there may come a point where the nozzle exit area is as big as the engine nacelle diameter or aircraft afterbody diameter. Beyond this point the nozzle diameter becomes the biggest diameter and starts to incur increasing drag. Nozzles are thus limited to the installation size and the loss in thrust incurred is a trade off with other considerations such as lower drag, less weight.

Examples are the F-16 at Mach2.0 and the XB-70 at Mach3.0.

Another consideration may relate to the required nozzle cooling flow. The divergent flaps or petals have to be isolated from the afterburner flame temperature, which may be of the order of , by a layer of cooling air. A longer divergence means more area to be cooled. The thrust loss from incomplete expansion is traded against the benefits of less cooling flow. This applied to the TF-30 nozzle in the F-14A where the ideal area ratio at Mach2.4 was limited to a lower value.

===What is adding a divergent section worth in real terms?===
A divergent section gives added exhaust velocity and hence thrust at supersonic flight speeds.

The effect of adding a divergent section was demonstrated with Pratt &amp; Whitney&#x27;s first C-D nozzle. The convergent nozzle was replaced with a C-D nozzle on the same engine J57 in the same aircraft F-101.
The increased thrust from the C-D nozzle ( at sea-level take-off) on this engine raised the speed from Mach1.6 to almost 2.0 enabling the Air Force to set a world&#x27;s speed record of which was just below Mach2 for the temperature on that day. The true worth of the C-D nozzle was not realised on the F-101 as the intake was not modified for the higher speeds attainable. 
Another example was the replacement of a convergent with a C-D nozzle on the YF-106/P&amp;W J75 when it would not quite reach Mach2. Together with the introduction of the C-D nozzle, the inlet was redesigned. The USAF subsequently set a world&#x27;s speed record with the F-106 of 1526 mph (Mach2.43).

===Nozzle area control during dry operation===

Some very early jet engines that were not equipped with an afterburner, such as the BMW 003 and the Jumo 004 (which had a design ), had a variable area nozzle formed by a translating plug known as a &quot;Zwiebel&quot; [wild onion] from its shape. The Jumo 004 had a large area for starting to prevent overheating the turbine and a smaller area for take-off and flight to give higher exhaust velocity and thrust. The 004&#x27;s &quot;Zwiebel&quot; possessed a range of forward/reverse travel to vary the exhaust nozzle area, driven by an electric motor-driven mechanism within the body&#x27;s divergent area just behind the turbine.

Afterburner-equipped engines may also open the nozzle for starting and at idle. The idle thrust is reduced which lowers taxi speeds and brake wear. This feature on the J75 engine in the F-106 was called &#x27;Idle Thrust Control&#x27; and reduced idle thrust by 40%. On aircraft carriers, lower idle thrust reduces the hazards from jet blast.

In some applications, such as the J79 installation in various aircraft, during fast throttle advances, the nozzle area may be prevented from closing beyond a certain point to allow a more rapid increase in RPM and hence faster time to maximum thrust.

In the case of a 2-spool turbojet, such as the Olympus 593 in Concorde, the nozzle area may be varied to enable simultaneous achievement of maximum low-pressure compressor speed and maximum turbine entry temperature over the wide range of engine entry temperatures which occurs with flight speeds up to Mach2.

On some augmented turbofans the fan operating line is controlled with nozzle area during both dry and wet operation to trade excess surge margin for more thrust.

===Nozzle area control during wet operation===
The nozzle area is increased during afterburner operation to limit the upstream effects on the engine. To run a turbofan to give maximum airflow (thrust), the nozzle area may be controlled to keep the fan operating line in its optimum position. For a turbojet to give maximum thrust, the area may be controlled to keep the turbine exhaust temperature at its limit.

===What happens if the nozzle doesn&#x27;t open when the afterburner is selected?===
In early afterburner installations, the pilot had to check the nozzle position indicator after selecting afterburner. If the nozzle did not open for some reason, and the pilot did not react by cancelling the afterburner selection, typical controls of that period (e.g. the J47 in the F-86L), could cause the turbine blades to overheat and fail.

===Other applications===

Certain aircraft, like the German Bf 109 and the Macchi C.202/205 were fitted with &quot;ejector-type exhausts&quot;. These exhausts converted some of the waste energy of the (internal combustion) engines exhaust-flow into a small amount of forward thrust by accelerating the hot gasses in a rearward direction to a speed greater than that of the aircraft. All exhaust configurations do this to some extent if the exhaust gasses are discharged in a rearward direction.

A particular thrust-producing exhaust device was patented by Rolls-Royce Limited in 1937. On the 1944 de Havilland Hornet&#x27;s Rolls-Royce Merlin 130/131 engines the thrust from the multi-ejector exhausts were equivalent to an extra 70bhp per-engine at full-throttle height.

<text>Bertrand Leslie Hallward (24 May 1901 – 17 November 2003) was a British educationalist who served as Headmaster of Clifton College and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Nottingham.

==Family and education==
Hallward was born in Hove, Sussex, to Norman Hallward, who worked for the Indian Civil Service, and Eva Gurdon, the daughter of an Indian Army officer. Among his paternal ancestors were several Anglican clergymen, and on his mother&#x27;s side he was the nephew of Bertrand Evelyn Mellish Gurdon.

He was a pupil at Warden House in Deal, Kent, and at Haileybury College, and later an undergraduate at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. After two terms teaching at Harrow School he returned to Cambridge as a fellow of Peterhouse, where he quickly developed an interest in academic administration.

In 1926 he married Margaret Tait (1900–1991), the daughter of the Rev. Arthur Tait, Principal of Ridley Hall, Cambridge, and granddaughter of the Rt. Rev. Thomas Drury, Master of St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Bertrand and Margaret had four daughters together.

==Academic career==

===Clifton College===
Having unsuccessfully applied for the headmastership of Felsted School in 1931, Hallward was offered the position of Headmaster of Clifton College in Bristol in 1939. After a bomb hit the school, he moved the pupils to Bude in Cornwall for the remainder of the Second World War. Returning to Bristol, he set about increasing enrollment and improving the quality of the staff.

===University of Nottingham===
In 1947, after declining an offer from Charterhouse School, Hallward applied to become principal of University College, Nottingham, which, when his term began the following year, had received full university status. He immediately began enlarging and developing the campus from 122 to 400 acres and enhancing the quality of teaching. He retired from the University of Nottingham in 1965.

==Other interests and later life==

Hallward served as chairman of the Nottingham Playhouse for 15 years. On retirement, he built an ocean-going yacht, sailing around the Mediterranean Sea during the summer months.

He celebrated his 100th birthday at Peterhouse in 2001 and died in 2003, at the age of 102.

The Hallward Library, opened in 1972, at the University of Nottingham was named after him and, after his death, a girls&#x27; boarding house at Clifton College was established and named after him (Hallward&#x27;s House).

<doc id="1226765" wikidata="Q756413" url="?curid=1226765" title="Battle of Asculum">
<text>The Battle of Asculum was a poorly documented battle that took place near Asculum (modern Ascoli Satriano) in 279 BC, and was thought to have lasted either one or two days, between the Roman Republic under the command of the consuls Publius Decius Mus (who by some accounts died before the battle) and Publius Sulpicius Saverrio, and the forces of King Pyrrhus of Epirus. The battle took place during the Pyrrhic War, after the Battle of Heraclea of 280 BC, which was the first battle of the war. There currently exists accounts of this battle only by three ancient historians: Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Plutarch, and Cassius Dio, although these historians in turn reference other historians whose work is now lost. Asculum was in Lucanian territory, in southern Italy. The Battle of Asculum was the original &quot;Pyrrhic victory&quot;. The result of the battle is not definitively known, with Plutarch stating that it was a pyrrhic Greek victory, Cassius Dio recording it as a Roman victory. The constituents of both armies are also poorly known, with each historian offering largely divergent estimates for the strength of the armies or the length of the battle.

== Prelude and armies ==

Cassius Dio wrote that during the winter of 280/279 BC both sides prepared for the next battle. In the spring of 279 BC, Pyrrhus invaded Apulia. Many places were captured or capitulated. The Romans came upon him near Asculum and encamped opposite him. In Plutarch&#x27;s account, after resting his army, Pyrrhus marched to Asculum to confront the Romans.

According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Pyrrhus had 70,000 infantry, of whom 16,000 were Greeks. The Romans had more than 70,000 infantry, of whom about 20,000 were Romans (four legions which at the time had 4,000 men each), the rest being troops from allies. The Romans had about 8,000 cavalry and Pyrrhus had slightly more, plus 19 war elephants. The 1st century AD Roman senator Frontinus estimated a strength of 40,000 men for both sides. Pyrrhus had men from Thesprotia, Ambracia, and Chaon, two cities and a district in Epirus, and mercenaries from the Aetolians, Acarnanians, and Athamanians. These Greeks fought in the Macedonian Phalanx battle formation. He had cavalry squadrons from Thessaly. The Greeks of the city of Tarentum, in southern Italy, were allies of Pyrrhus. Pyrrhus also had allies from three Italic peoples in southern Italy: the Bruttii, Lucani, and Samnites. Among the allies of Rome mentioned by Dionysius of Halicarnassus there were the Frentani, Marrucini, Paeligni, Dauni, and Umbrians. There might also have been contingents from the Marsi and Vestini, who were also allies of Rome.

Since Pyrrhus&#x27; elephants had caused much terror and destruction in the Battle of Heraclea, the Romans devised special wagons against them. They were four-wheeled and had poles mounted transversely on upright beams. They could be swung in any direction. Some had iron tridents, spikes, or scythes, and some had &quot;cranes that hurled down heavy grappling irons&quot;. Many poles protruded in front of the wagons and had fire-bearing grapnels wrapped in cloth daubed with pitch. The wagons carried bowmen, hurlers of stones, and slingers who threw iron caltrops and men who threw grapnels on fire against the trunks and faces of the elephants. The Romans had 300 such wagons.

Pyrrhus lined up the Macedonian phalanx of the Epirots and Ambracians, mercenaries from Tarentum with white shields, and the Bruttii and Lucani allies on the right wing. The Thesprotians and Chaonians were deployed in the centre next to the Aetolian, Acarnanian, and Athamanian mercenaries. The Samnites formed the left wing. On the right wing of the cavalry were the Samnite, Thessalian, and Bruttii squadrons and Tarentine mercenaries. On the left wing were the Ambracian, Lucanian, and Tarentine squadrons and Acarnanian, Aetolian, Macedonian, and Athamanian mercenaries. Pyrrhus divided the light infantry and the elephants into two groups and placed them behind the wings, on a slightly elevated position. Pyrrhus had an agema of 2,000 picked cavalrymen behind the battle line to help hard-pressed troops. The Romans had their first and third legions on the right wing. The first faced the Epirot and Ambracian phalanx and the Tarentine mercenaries. The third faced the Tarentine phalanx with white shields and the Bruttii and Lucani. The fourth legion formed the centre. The second legion was on the right wing. The Latins, Volsci, and Campanians (who were part of the Roman Republic) and Rome&#x27;s allies were divided into four legions which were mingled with the Roman legions to strengthen all the lines. The light infantry and wagons which were to be deployed against the elephants were outside the line. Both the Roman and the allied cavalry were on the wings.

== Battle ==
In Plutarch&#x27;s account, the battle was fought over two days. In the accounts of Cassius Dio and Dionysius of Halicarnassus it lasted one day. According to Plutarch the battle was won by Pyrrhus, according to Cassius Dio, it was won by the Romans. Dionysius of Halicarnassus did not state the outcome of the battle.

===Plutarch&#x27;s account===

By Plutarch&#x27;s account the battle lasted two days. After resting his army, Pyrrhus marched to Asculum to confront the Romans. However, he was forced into an area where, due to the wooded banks of the river, he could not deploy the cavalry or use his elephants against the Romans. The fighting was fierce and many were killed or wounded, before the battle was interrupted by nightfall. During the night Pyrrhus sent a detachment to occupy the unfavourable areas of the field so that he could fight and deploy his elephants on level ground. He put many archers and slingers between the elephants and charged in compact formation. The Romans could not use sidelong shifts or make counter-movements as on the previous day. They had to fight on level ground in a frontal attack. They fought fiercely with their swords against the Macedonian pikes, in an attempt to repulse the enemy troops before the elephants could charge. Despite their resistance, they were eventually driven back by the elephants and fled to their camp.

===Cassius Dio&#x27;s account===

Cassius Dio wrote that the two sides avoided each other for several days. There were rumours that Publius Decius Mus (one of the two consuls for 279 BC) was getting ready to devote himself like his father and grandfather. In a devotio a Roman commander sacrificed his life by launching himself into the enemy ranks as a vow to the gods in exchange for victory when the Roman troops were overwhelmed. This galvanised the Roman soldiers. The rumour alarmed the Italic followers of Pyrrhus, who believed that Decius&#x27; death would ruin them. Pyrrhus endeavoured to reassure them and ordered them to seize alive anyone who wore the garments the Decii family used when devoting themselves. He sent a man to tell Publius Decius that he would not succeed in his intent and after being taken alive he would die miserably. The Roman consuls replied that there was no need to resort to a devotio because the Romans would defeat him without it.

In Cassius Dio&#x27;s version of the battle, the river between the two camps was not easy to ford. The Romans asked whether Pyrrhus would choose to cross it unmolested or whether he would allow them to do so unharmed so that the two forces would fight intact, thus giving an accurate test of their valour. Pyrrhus, confident of the strength of his elephants, allowed the Romans to cross the river. However, the Romans deployed their wagons against the elephants, shooting fire and missiles. The Romans gradually forced the Epirotes back until Pyrrhus moved the elephants to the other end of the line, away from the wagons. He used them to charge the Roman cavalry, which was routed by the elephants before they even got close. Meanwhile, some Dauni had set out against the camp of the Epirotes. This won the battle for the Romans because when Pyrrhus sent some of his men against them, the rest suspected that the camp had fallen and that their companions had fled. Because of this they gave way. Many fell and Pyrrhus and many of his officers were wounded. Others died later because of lack of food and of medical supplies. Pyrrhus withdrew to Tarentum before the Romans became aware of this. The Romans did not pursue him because many of their men were wounded. They went into winter quarters in Apulia, while Pyrrhus sent for soldiers and money from home and went on with his other preparations.

===Dionysius of Halicarnassus&#x27; account===

In the account of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the Roman cavalry engaged in hand-to-hand, stationary combat, and the Greek cavalry engaged in flanking manoeuvres. When the Romans were pursued by the Greeks, they turned their horses around and fought the infantry. When the battle was even, the Greeks swerved to the right, counter-marched past one another and then turned to charge the enemy. The right wing of the infantry of each army was the stronger one. The Macedonian phalanx repulsed the first Roman legion and the Latins who fought alongside it. Pyrrhus ordered the elephants to charge the part of the Roman line which was in difficulty. The Romans sent the wagons against them, with some initial success. Then the men leading the elephants stopped driving them forward and threw down spears. Lightly-armed Greek troops attacked the wagons and those who manned them fled into the nearest infantry line, throwing it into confusion. The Bruttii and Lucanians in the middle of the formation of Pyrrhus fled when they were repulsed by the Roman fourth legion. When the line was broken through, the Tarentines also fled. Pyrrhus sent part of the agema and part of the cavalry on the right wing to help this weakened line.

Some of the Daunians from Arpi (4000 infantry and 4000 cavalry), who had been sent to help, got close to Pyrrhus’ camp by chance while travelling on a road that led to the enemy&#x27;s rear. They decided to attack the camp, and after having heard from some prisoners that it had but a few guards, attacked on all sides. Pyrrhus sent the elephants and the bravest cavalrymen to the camp, but it was taken and set on fire before they arrived. The Daunians fled to a hill which could not be ascended by horses or elephants. The enemy detachment then attacked the third and fourth legions, which had routed their opponents. After fleeing up a steep and wooded hill, they lined up in battle order. Although the horses and elephants of Pyrrhus could not pursue them, many were killed or wounded by bowmen and slingers. Pyrrhus sent forward the Athamanians, the Acarnanians and some of the Samnites. The Romans sent forward some cavalry squadrons, and the two forces clashed with many casualties at the bottom of the hill. Both sides recalled their troops just before sunset. The Romans crossed the river to reach their camp. Pyrrhus, whose forces had lost the tents, pack-animals and baggage which were kept in the camp, encamped on a hill and spent the night outdoors and without food. Many of the wounded died as a result of the conditions.

==Aftermath==
Plutarch noted that according to Hieronymus of Cardia the Romans lost 6,000 men and that, according to Pyrrhus&#x27; own commentaries, he lost 3,505 men. He wrote that Dionysius of Halicarnassus made &quot;no mention of two battles at Asculum, nor of an admitted defeat of the Romans&quot; and that (in a passage which is now lost) Dionysius wrote that over 15,000 men on both sides fell in the battle. Plutarch also wrote that Pyrrhus said to someone who was congratulating him: &quot;If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined.&quot; This was because he lost a great part of the forces he had brought to Italy and most of his commanders. He could not call up more men from home and his allies in Italy were becoming indifferent. The Romans, instead, could quickly replenish their forces &quot;as if from a fountain gushing forth indoors&quot;, and did not lose courage or determination in defeat.

Realising that he could not win a war against the Romans, Pyrrhus accepted a request from the Greek city-states of eastern and southern Sicily to help them against the Carthaginians in western Sicily. He went to Sicily and campaigned there for three years. His allies in southern Italy were aggrieved because he abandoned them. He took over all the Carthaginian domains in Sicily except for the stronghold of Lilybaeum. His siege of this city was unsuccessful. After this he wanted to build a large fleet to invade Carthage&#x27;s home territory in Africa. He needed to man and equip these ships and to do this he treated the Greek city-states despotically. These cities turned against him. He was forced to return to southern Italy. He fought the Romans at the Battle of Beneventum (275 BC), where he was defeated. He then left Italy and returned to Epirus.

<text>Taman Johor Jaya is a suburb in Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia. Johor Jaya consists of mainly residential zones, but it also has light industrial and commercial zones.

==Development history==

Johor Jaya was developed by Housing Developer Daiman Development Berhad, a subsidiary of Daiman Group. Construction and development works started in 1983. The first phase of development focused mainly on the construction of single storey terrace houses. Construction of the houses completed in 1987, but residents were initially hesitant to move into their houses due to reports of house break-ins. Daiman subsequently announced plans in January 1989 to develop the next 3 phases in Anggerik, Dedap and Teratai. Plans were made to build single and double storey terrace houses, shophouses and a sports complex. Development of these 3 phases completed by 1992, and there were some 11,132 residential houses built by then. The then-general manager of Daiman Group, Tan Yeong Kan quoted that the completion of the development phases were fuelled by their company&#x27;s cash surpluses with no borrowings. Development of the Keembong and Seroja phases followed suit between 1992 and 1993. The development of the final phase of Johor Jaya around Jalan Rosemerah Utama began in the mid-1990s and concluded with the construction of build-to-order bungalows in the area to the west of the Daiman Golf Course in 1998.

The Family Food Centre was built in 2004 along Jalan Dedap 14 serving various type of common Malay cuisine. A new neighbouring megamall, ÆON Tebrau City, was built in 2005 along Tebrau Highway. Other neighbouring hypermarkets include Giant in Plentong and ÆON Big along Tebrau Highway, just south of ÆON. The At-Taqwa Mosque, which was built in 2009, is located along Jalan Dedap 10. Johor Jaya new police station is in Rosmerah. There is also a Hindu Temple located beside the police station.

==Demographics==

Most of Johor Jaya&#x27;s residents are Malays (51.7%), followed by Chinese (40.9%) and Indians (6.8%).

<doc id="1226795" wikidata="Q4793685" url="?curid=1226795" title="Armor (novel)">
<text>Armor is a military science fiction novel by John Steakley. It features the military use of exoskeletons and insect-like alien enemies but concentrates on the psychological effects of violence on human beings.

It was first published in December 1984.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Armor&quot; is the story of humanity&#x27;s war against an alien race whose foot soldiers are three-meter-tall insects, referred to in the book as &quot;ants&quot;. It is also the story of a research colony on the fringes of human territory which is threatened by pirates. The two sub-plots intersect at the end, with each providing answers and insight into events of the other.

The title refers to the nuclear-powered exoskeletons worn by the soldiers, but also references the emotional armor the protagonists maintain to survive.

===The plot on Banshee===
The protagonist is Felix, an enlistee who&#x27;s been given &quot;scout&quot; duty on an alien planet in the seemingly endless Antwar. Little is known of him initially but that he suffers from burnout and refuses to die, even when it seems inevitable. When entering into combat, a persona he calls the &quot;Engine&quot; takes over. The Engine makes him into a ruthless killing machine dedicated to keeping him alive at all costs.

The novel starts with Felix and his company assaulting an inhospitable planet aptly named &quot;Banshee.&quot; Using armored infantry suits, soldiers drop onto the planet from starships via a teleportation device called &quot;Transit.&quot; The attack goes horribly wrong, as Felix&#x27;s company is completely wiped out, and the mountain fort they were originally supposed to capture is revealed to be a giant hive. In the aftermath of his first encounter, Felix regroups with the surviving humans. There, he meets another highly skilled scout named Forest, who participated in the fleet-wide Armored Olympics against decorated soldier Nathan Kent. It is also revealed that the Ants can lock onto the fleet&#x27;s Transit beacons and barrage them with missiles fired from the Hive, making retreat impossible.

During a fallback to an elevated bluff, a dying soldier keys all functions on the suit and blows up the nuclear powered armor. Several warriors are killed in the disaster, including Forest. Before dying she confesses to Felix that she always loved Kent. With no options left the warriors resort to attacking the Hive to secure transport back to the ship. Exploiting the Hive&#x27;s tunnel system, they plan to use a wounded soldier as a bomb to destroy it. Before the attack, Felix meets a soldier named Bolov who tells him that as a scout on his first drop, Felix has a 10% chance of survival.

Felix and his fellow soldiers are ambushed by ants on their way up the hive. During the attack, the soldier they planned on using as a bomb is killed, rendering him useless. In a stroke of bad luck, Bolov is also mortally wounded, grudgingly accepts the task of sacrificing himself and is thrown in the Hive by Felix. The Hive is then destroyed and the survivors are able to retreat back to the ship.

After 19 drops on Banshee, Felix has learned that he is an almost unstoppable warrior. His 20th drop is revealed to be a fleet mission to create humanity&#x27;s first forward operating base on Banshee. He also learns that Nathan Kent will be dropping with him.

The soldiers successfully create an impregnable fort on Banshee. Felix learns from his inexperienced Commanding Officer, Canada Shoen, that one of the purposes of the fort is to show non-combat officers and journalists what the war is like. Felix is disgusted by this revelation. After spending time with Nathan Kent, he tells him about Forest&#x27;s death and her true feelings for him. Kent is devastated and attacks Felix in a drunken rage. The fort withstands several assaults from the ants and wears them down almost to complete exhaustion. During a celebration for their victory, ants attack from underground and kill dozens of people, before ultimately being crushed again.

Felix discovers that his 21st drop will be with the Masao, the hereditary ruler of an extremely wealthy extra-solar planet of the same name founded and inhabited by Japanese. They drop into an area not infested with ants so that he can see Banshee for himself. The Masao goads Felix until he admits his past as the Guardian Archon, the elected leader of Golden, a similarly affluent planet. Felix&#x27;s wife Angel was killed in a tragic freighter accident when she fled Golden, whose people would not accept her because she was from Earth. Felix had blamed Golden, shirked his responsibilities and joined the fleet in hopes of dying in battle. The Masao, who is his lifelong best friend, Allie, begs for Felix to return to Golden. He agrees to leave the military as Allie has brought a small courier ship and funds for him and his desire to die had subsided, but still refuses to return to Golden. Only moments before being teleported onto the ship, Felix notices a Hive in the distance that barrages them with missiles, killing Allie.

In the ensuing chaotic moments after being beamed back to the ship, Kent grabs Felix, who is being blamed for Allie&#x27;s death. He pops Felix&#x27;s armor and pushes him onto the ship that Allie had brought before being killed by troops as he blocked their path to Felix.

===The plot on Sanction===

A secondary plot takes place on Sanction, a planet far removed from the fighting, at a Fleet research facility. The two plots are intertwined, with events Felix experienced on Banshee recalled as flashbacks.

Jack Crow is a notorious celebrity and one-time pirate. A morally questionable character with views and opinions that are just as questionable, he is a tough man who does not hesitate to kill. He is constantly at odds with his own morality but he knows the difference between his celebrity reputation and his real personality. At times, his reputation is more of a burden than a blessing.

Jack, having been imprisoned, escapes and reaches the ship of a mutineer and deserter from the Antwar named Borglyn. Jack strikes a deal where, in exchange for Borglyn saving his life, he will infiltrate and sabotage the Fleet research project on Sanction so Borglyn can access its limitless Fleet power source to refuel his ship, a pretense as Borglyn actually wants to take over the planet. Borglyn will also pay Jack and give him a VIP courier ship to go his own way.

On Sanction, Jack takes an old suit of battle armor from the courier ship to project Director Hollis &quot;Holly&quot; Ware, to ingratiate himself and get the necessary access to fulfill his bargain with Borglyn. But Jack is then asked by Holly to participate in an experiment to retrieve the data from the suit&#x27;s battle recorder, which is the &quot;memory&quot; of the wearer while the suit was active.

Out of curiosity and a bit of false bonhomie, Jack agrees; he, Holly and Lya (a Fleet psychologist and Holly&#x27;s girlfriend) spend several sessions &quot;immersed&quot; firsthand in the life of Felix on Banshee and on board ship. During these sessions, more of events on Banshee are described, and the reader is introduced for the first time to Felix as he sees himself and experiences battle.

Through either the complacency or gross incompetence of his superiors, Felix has suffered unbelievably, yet continues to soldier on. This also challenges the trio to deal with the knowledge that the public story of the Antwar is far different from the true horror. These immersions change Jack - as it does the others - so that he chooses to make an almost certain suicidal stand with Holly against Borglyn&#x27;s attack on the facility.

Throughout the novel, Jack comes into contact with the alcoholic owner of Sanction, a wealthy rancher named Lewis. Lewis is profoundly anti-war and doesn&#x27;t allow his citizens to carry energy weapons. Jack comes to despise Lewis for his irresponsible drunken nature. During Borglyn&#x27;s attack, Jack and Holly are on the verge of defeat when Lewis mounts a last minute rescue. Sensing the hopelessness of the situation, he reactivates the armor, revealing himself to be Felix. The ship Borglyn gave Jack was Felix&#x27;s. He dons the fully charged scout armor and uses it to destroy Borglyn&#x27;s forces and attack the ship. At the last second, Borglyn fires all of the ships weapon&#x27;s, seemingly destroying everything around it. He orders the crew to lift off to escape Felix.

Jack and Holly watch in awe as this happens, and catch a final glimpse of Felix on the back of the starship through a security camera just before the ship moves out of range. The government of Golden sends emissaries to Sanction to learn the story. They refuse to end their search for their leader as no wreckage or bodies were found. Jack, Holly, and Lya start new lives on Sanction outside of fleet influence.

==Relation to &quot;Vampire$&quot;==
Characters named &quot;Felix&quot; and &quot;Jack Crow&quot; appear in the 1990 John Steakley novel &quot;Vampire$&quot;, along with an easter egg about the &quot;Antwar&quot;. &quot;Vampire$&quot; is set in a contemporary modern age fantasy world, unlike the science fiction future world of &quot;Armor&quot;.

==Developments==
A sequel was in the works at the time of Steakley&#x27;s death. An excerpt can be found at a fan web-page, posted with the author&#x27;s consent.

<doc id="1226796" wikidata="Q3208037" url="?curid=1226796" title="The Skylark of Space">
<text>The Skylark of Space is a science fiction novel by American writer Edward E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith, written between 1915 and 1921 while Smith was working on his doctorate. Though the original idea for the novel was Smith&#x27;s, he co-wrote the first part of the novel with Lee Hawkins Garby, the wife of his college classmate and later neighbor Carl Garby. The novel starts as an edisonade, but turns into a space travel adventure when the characters go into deep space. &quot;The Skylark of Space&quot; is considered to be one of the earliest novels of interstellar travel and the first example of space opera. Originally serialized in 1928 in the magazine &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, it was first published in book form in 1946 by the Buffalo Book Co. The novel was followed by three sequels, beginning with &quot;Skylark Three&quot;.

==Plot synopsis==

: &quot;Note: This synopsis is consistent with the novel in its later forms (1946 and subsequent editions) but differs in detail from the original 1928 text as transcribed at Project Gutenberg. There were significant changes between the 1928 magazine publication and the 1946 hardcover, and between the early hardcovers and the late 1950s and later paperback editions.&quot;

&quot;The Skylark of Space&quot; is the first book of the &quot;Skylark&quot; series and pits the idealistic protagonist, Dick Seaton, against the mercantile antagonist Marc &quot;Blackie&quot; DuQuesne.

At the beginning of the story, Seaton accidentally discovers a workable space drive in combining pure copper with a newly discovered [fictional] element &quot;X&quot; (suggested to be a stable transactinide element in the platinum group) in solution. Having failed to re-create the effect, Seaton realizes that the missing component is a field generated by DuQuesne&#x27;s particle accelerator, and thereafter sets up a business with his millionaire friend, Martin Crane, to build a spaceship. DuQuesne conspires to sabotage Seaton&#x27;s spaceship and build his own from Seaton&#x27;s plans, which he uses to kidnap Seaton&#x27;s fiancée, Dorothy Vaneman, to exchange for the &quot;X&quot;. In the resulting fight, DuQuesne&#x27;s ship is accidentally set to full acceleration on an uncontrolled trajectory, until the copper &#x27;power bar&#x27; is exhausted at a vast distance from Earth&#x27;s Solar System. Using an &quot;Object Compass&quot; that once locked on an object, always points toward that object, Seaton and Crane follow DuQuesne in their own spaceship (the eponymous &quot;Skylark&quot;) to rescue Dorothy and her fellow-hostage, Margaret &quot;Peg&quot; Spencer, until the &quot;Skylark&quot; discovers DuQuesne&#x27;s ship derelict in orbit around a massive dead star (resembling a cold neutron star). Having obtained the hostages, Seaton extracts a promise from DuQuesne to &quot;act as one of the party until they get back to Earth&quot;, in which relationship they leave orbit and travel further in search of additional fuel.

On an Earthlike exoplanet, they obtain &quot;X&quot; from an outcrop almost purely of that mineral; then leave that planet in search of copper. Following an encounter with a &quot;Disembodied Intelligence&quot;, they enter a cluster of stars nicknamed “The Green System” and locate a planet having copper sulfate oceans. On the Earth-like &quot;Osnome&quot;, they befriend the rulers of Mardonale, one of the two factions of the Osnomian natives. When the Mardonalian ruler attempts to betray Seaton and his friends, they find allies in Prince Dunark (a crown-prince of Mardonale&#x27;s rival &quot;Kondal&quot;) and his consort Princess Sitar, whom they later assist in destroying Mardonale. In gratitude, the Kondalians make new copper &quot;power bars&quot; and rebuild the &quot;Skylark&quot; as &quot;Skylark Two&quot;, with new weapons known to Kondalian science. Thereafter Seaton&#x27;s marriage to Dorothy, and Crane&#x27;s to Margaret, are solemnized by the Kondalian monarchy, and Seaton himself declared nominal &quot;Overlord&quot; of Kondal. The &quot;Skylark&quot; then returns to Earth, laden with jewels, platinum, radium, and a plenitude of &quot;X&quot;; but near Earth, DuQuesne leaves the &quot;Skylark&quot; by parachute, and the story ends with the &quot;Skylark&quot;&#x27;s landing on Crane&#x27;s Field.

==Reception==
Frederik Pohl says of the book: &quot;With the exception of the works of H. G. Wells, possibly those of Jules Verne—and almost no other writer—it has inspired more imitators and done more to change the nature of all the science fiction written after it than almost any other single work.&quot; Mike Ashley called it &quot;the seminal space opera.&quot; Despite its influence, its critical reputation is mixed; Groff Conklin&#x27;s review of the 1950 edition noted that &quot;This tale is the sort of thing that only insatiable fans will enjoy, being . . . uncommonly amateur and awkward&quot;, and Isaac Asimov wrote that &quot;It had adventure of an unprecedented kind ... the first great &#x27;classic&#x27; of American science fiction&quot;, but &quot;As literature, it was a total flop&quot;. Damon Knight, however, praised the novel for its &quot;fast, lean plot, an air of excitement, . . . four characters who are comfortingly bigger than life [and] the feeling that adventures are waiting everywhere,&quot; concluding that &quot;In &quot;The Skylark&quot;, everything is big and simple.&quot; R. D. Mullen wrote that Smith&#x27;s &quot;great success&quot; was &quot;surely due first of all to the skill with which Smith mixed elements of the spy thriller and the western story . . . with those of the traditional cosmic voyage.
In the science fiction novel &quot;Islands in the Sky&quot; by Arthur C. Clarke a starship is named &quot;The Skylark of Space,&quot; &quot;a name apparently taken from a famous old science fiction story&quot;.

==Sequels==

The novel was followed by three sequels:
# &quot;Skylark Three&quot; (&quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, Aug–Oct 1930)
# &quot;Skylark of Valeron&quot; (&quot;Astounding Stories&quot; Aug 1934 – Feb 1935, Fantasy Press 1949)
# &quot;Skylark DuQuesne&quot; (&quot;Worlds of If&quot; Jun–Oct 1965, Pyramid Books 1966) - Hugo Award nominee

<doc id="1226799" wikidata="Q1937453" url="?curid=1226799" title="Vehicle armour">
<text>Military vehicles are commonly armoured (or armored; see spelling differences) to withstand the impact of shrapnel, bullets, shells, rockets, and missiles, protecting the personnel inside from enemy fire. Such vehicles include armoured fighting vehicles like tanks, aircraft, and ships.

Civilian vehicles may also be armoured. These vehicles include cars used by officials (e.g., presidential limousines), reporters and others in conflict zones or where violent crime is common. Civilian armoured cars are also routinely used by security firms to carry money or valuables to reduce the risk of highway robbery or the hijacking of the cargo.

Armour may also be used in vehicles to protect from threats other than a deliberate attack. Some spacecraft are equipped with specialised armour to protect them against impacts from micrometeoroids or fragments of space debris. Modern aircraft powered by jet engines usually have them fitted with a sort of armour in the form of an aramid composite kevlar bandage around the fan casing or debris containment walls built into the casing of their gas turbine engines to prevent injuries or airframe damage should the fan, compressor, or turbine blades break free.

The design and purpose of the vehicle determines the amount of armour plating carried, as the plating is often very heavy and excessive amounts of armour restrict mobility. In order to decrease this problem, some new materials (nanomaterials) and material compositions are being researched which include buckypaper, and aluminium foam armour plates.

==Materials==
===Metals===

====Steel====
&quot;Rolled homogeneous armour&quot; is strong, hard, and tough (does not shatter when struck with a fast, hard blow). Steel with these characteristics are produced by processing cast steel billets of appropriate size and then rolling them into plates of required thickness. Rolling and forging (hammering the steel when it is red hot) irons out the grain structure in the steel, removing imperfections which would reduce the strength of the steel. Rolling also elongates the grain structure in the steel to form long lines, which enable the stress the steel is placed under when loaded to flow throughout the metal, and not be concentrated in one area.

&quot;Cast homogenous armour&quot; or &quot;cast steel armour&quot; is produced by directly casting steel into the desired shape. It tends to be softer as heat treatment is difficult or impossible. Nevertheless, the flexibility in shape has made it popular as the structural hull in modern tanks.

====Aluminium====

&quot;Aluminium&quot; is used when light weight is a necessity. It is most commonly used on APCs and armoured cars. While certainly not the strongest metal, it is cheap, lightweight, and tough enough that it can serve as easy armour.

====Iron====
Wrought &quot;iron&quot; was used on ironclad warships. Early European iron armour consisted of 10 to 12.5 cm of wrought iron backed by up to one metre of solid wood. It has since been replaced by steel due to steel being significantly stronger.

====Titanium====
Titanium has almost twice the density of aluminium, but can have a yield strength similar to high strength steels, giving it a high specific strength. It also has a high specific resilience and specific toughness. So, despite being more expensive, it finds an application in areas where weight is a concern, such as personal armour and military aviation. Some notable examples of its use include the USAF A-10 Thunderbolt II and the Soviet/Russian-built Sukhoi Su-25 ground-attack aircraft, utilising a bathtub-shaped titanium enclosure for the pilot, as well as the Soviet/Russian Mil Mi-24 attack helicopter.

====Uranium====
Because of its high density, depleted uranium (DU) can also be used in tank armour, sandwiched between sheets of steel armour plate. For instance, some late-production M1A1HA and M1A2 Abrams tanks built after 1998 have DU reinforcement as part of the armour plating in the front of the hull and the front of the turret, and there is a program to upgrade the rest (see Chobham armour).

===Plastic===

&quot;Plastic metal&quot; was a type of vehicle armour originally developed for merchant ships by the British Admiralty in 1940. The original composition was described as 50% clean granite of half-inch size, 43% of limestone mineral, and 7% of bitumen. It was typically applied in a layer two inches thick and backed by half an inch of steel.

Plastic armour was highly effective at stopping armour piercing bullets because the hard granite particles would deflect the bullet, which would then lodge between plastic armour and the steel backing plate. Plastic armour could be applied by pouring it into a cavity formed by the steel backing plate and a temporary wooden form.

Some main battle tank armour utilises polymers, for example polyurethane as used in the &quot;BDD&quot; appliqué armour applied to modernized T-62 and T-55.

===Glass===
Bulletproof glass is a colloquial term for glass that is particularly resistant to being penetrated when struck by bullets. The industry generally refers to it as &quot;bullet-resistant glass&quot; or &quot;transparent armour&quot;.

Bullet-resistant glass is usually constructed using a strong but transparent material such as polycarbonate thermoplastic or by using layers of laminated glass. The desired result is a material with the appearance and light-transmitting behaviour of standard glass, which offers varying degrees of protection from small arms fire.

The polycarbonate layer, usually consisting of products such as Armormax, Makroclear, Cyrolon, Lexan or Tuffak, is often sandwiched between layers of regular glass. The use of plastic in the laminate provides impact-resistance, such as physical assault with a hammer, an axe, etc. The plastic provides little in the way of bullet-resistance. The glass, which is much harder than plastic, flattens the bullet and thereby prevents penetration. This type of bullet-resistant glass is usually 70–75 mm (2.8–3.0 in) thick.

Bullet-resistant glass constructed of laminated glass layers is built from glass sheets bonded together with polyvinyl butyral, polyurethane or ethylene-vinyl acetate. This type of bullet-resistant glass has been in regular use on combat vehicles since World War II; it is typically about 100–120 mm (3.9–4.7 in) thick and is usually extremely heavy.

Newer materials are being developed. One such, aluminium oxynitride, is much lighter but at US$10–15 per square inch is much more costly.

===Ceramic===

Ceramic&#x27;s precise mechanism for defeating HEAT was uncovered in the 1980s. High speed photography showed that the ceramic material shatters as the HEAT round penetrates, the highly energetic fragments destroying the geometry of the metal jet generated by the hollow charge, greatly diminishing the penetration. Ceramic layers can also be used as part of composite armour solutions. The high hardness of some ceramic materials serves as a disruptor that shatters and spreads the kinetic energy of projectiles.

===Composite===
Composite armour is armour consisting of layers of two or more materials with significantly different physical properties; steel and ceramics are the most common types of material in composite armour. Composite armour was initially developed in the 1940s, although it did not enter service until much later and the early examples are often ignored in the face of newer armour such as Chobham armour. Composite armour&#x27;s effectiveness depends on its composition and may be effective against kinetic energy penetrators as well as shaped charge munitions; heavy metals are sometimes included specifically for protection from kinetic energy penetrators.

Composite armour used on modern Western and Israeli main battle tanks largely consists of non-explosive reactive armour (NERA) elements - a type of reactive armour. These elements are often a laminate consisting of two hard plates (usually high hardness steel) with some low density interlayer material between them. Upon impact, the interlayer swells and moves the plates, disrupting heat &#x27;jets&#x27; and possibly degrading kinetic energy projectiles. Behind these elements will be some backing element designed to stop the degraded jet or projectile element, which may be of high hardness steel, or some composite of steel and ceramic or possibly uranium.

Soviet main battle tanks from the T-64 onward utilised composite armour which often consisted of some low density filler between relatively thick steel plates or castings, for example Combination K. For example, the T-64 turret had a layer of ceramic balls and aluminum sandwiched between layers of cast steel armour, whilst some models of the T-72 features a glass filler called &quot;Kvartz&quot;. The tank glacis was often a sandwich of steel and some low density filler, either textolite (a fibreglass reinforced polymer) or ceramic plates. Later T-80 and T-72 turrets contained NERA elements, similar to those discussed above.

==Ships==

Belt armour is a layer of armour-plating outside the hull of warships, typically on battleships, battlecruisers, cruisers and some aircraft carriers.

Typically, the belt covers from the deck down someway below the waterline of the ship. If built within the hull, rather than forming the outer hull, it can be fitted at an inclined angle to improve the protection.

When struck by a shell or torpedo, the belt armour is designed to prevent penetration, by either being too thick for the warhead to penetrate, or sloped to a degree that would deflect either projectile. Often, the main belt armour was supplemented with a torpedo bulkhead spaced several metres behind the main belt, designed to maintain the ship&#x27;s watertight integrity even if the main belt were penetrated.

The air-space between the belt and the hull also adds buoyancy. Several wartime vessels had belt armour that was thinner or shallower than was desirable, to speed production and conserve resources.

&quot;Deck armour&quot; on aircraft carriers is usually at the flight deck level, but on some early carriers was at the hangar deck. (See armoured flight deck.)

==Aircraft==

Armour plating is not common on aircraft, which generally rely on their speed and maneuverability to avoid attacks from enemy aircraft and ground fire, rather than trying to resist impacts. Additionally, any armour capable of stopping large-calibre anti-aircraft fire or missile fragments would result in an unacceptable weight penalty. So, only the vital parts of an aircraft, such as the ejection seat and engines, are usually armoured. This is one area where titanium is used extensively as armour plating. For example, in the American Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II and the Soviet-built Sukhoi Su-25 ground attack aircraft, as well as the Mil Mi-24 Hind ground-attack helicopter, the pilot sits in a titanium enclosure known as the &quot;bathtub&quot; for its shape. In addition, the windscreens of larger aircraft are generally made of impact-resistant, laminated materials, even on civilian craft, to prevent damage from bird strikes or other debris.

==Armoured fighting vehicles==

The most heavily armoured vehicles today are the main battle tanks, which are the spearhead of the ground forces, and are designed to withstand anti-tank guided missiles, kinetic energy penetrators, high-explosive anti-tank weapons, NBC threats and in some tanks even steep-trajectory shells. The Israeli Merkava tanks were designed in a way that each tank component functions as added back-up armour to protect the crew. Outer armour is modular and enables quickly replacing damaged parts.

===Layout===
For efficiency, the heaviest armour on an armoured fighting vehicle (AFV) is placed on its front. Tank tactics require the vehicle to always face the likely direction of enemy fire as much as possible, even in defence or withdrawal operations.

Sloping and curving armour can both increase its protection. Given a fixed thickness of armour plate, a projectile striking at an angle must penetrate more armour than one impacting perpendicularly. An angled surface also increases the chance of deflecting a projectile. This can be seen on v-hull designs, which direct the force of an improvised explosive device or landmine away from the crew compartment, increasing crew survivability.

===Spall liners===
Beginning during the Cold War, many AFVs have &quot;spall liners&quot; inside of the armour, designed to protect crew and equipment inside from fragmentation (spalling) released from the impact of enemy shells, especially high-explosive squash head warheads. Spall liners are made of aramids (Kevlar, Twaron), UHMWPE (Dyneema, Spectra Shield), or similar materials.

===Appliqué===

Appliqué armour, or add-on armour, consists of extra plates mounted onto the hull or turret of an AFV. The plates can be made of any material and are designed to be retrofitted to an AFV to withstand weapons that can penetrate the original armour of the vehicle. An advantage of appliqué armour is the possibility to tailor a vehicle&#x27;s protection level to a specific threat scenario.

===Improvised===

Vehicle armour is sometimes improvised in the midst of an armed conflict by vehicle crews or individual units. In World War II, British, Canadian and Polish tank crews welded spare strips of tank track to the hulls of their Sherman tanks. U.S. tank crews often added sand bags in the hull and turrets on Sherman tanks, often in an elaborate cage made of girders. Some Sherman tanks were up-armoured in the field with glacis plates and other armour cut from knocked-out tanks to create &quot;Improvised Jumbos&quot;, named after the heavily armoured M4A3E2 assault tank. In the Vietnam War, U.S. &quot;gun trucks&quot; were armoured with sandbags and locally fabricated steel armour plate. More recently, U.S. troops in Iraq armoured Humvees and various military transport vehicles with scrap materials: this came to be known as &quot;hillbilly armour&quot; or &quot;haji armour&quot; by the Americans. Moreover, there was the Killdozer incident, with the modified bulldozer being armoured with steel and concrete composite, which proved to be highly resistant to small arms.

===Spaced===
Armour with two or more plates spaced a distance apart, called spaced armour, has been in use since the First World War, where it was used on the Schneider CA1 and Saint-Chamond tanks. Spaced armour can be advantageous in several situations. For example, it can reduce the effectiveness of kinetic energy penetrators because the interaction with each plate can cause the round to tumble, deflect, deform, or disintegrate. This effect can be enhanced when the armour is sloped. Spaced armour can also offer increased protection against HEAT projectiles. This occurs because the shaped charge warhead can detonate prematurely (at the first surface), so that the metal jet that is produced loses its coherence before reaching the main armour and impacting over a broader area. Sometimes the interior surfaces of these hollow cavities are sloped, presenting angles to the anticipated path of the shaped charge&#x27;s jet in order to further dissipate its power. Taken to the extreme, relatively thin armour plates, metal mesh, or slatted plates, much lighter than fully protective armour, can be attached as side skirts or turret skirts to provide additional protection against such weapons. This can be seen in middle and late-World War II German tanks, as well as many modern AFVs. Taken as a whole, spaced armour can provide significantly increased protection while saving weight.

The analogous Whipple shield uses the principle of spaced armour to protect spacecraft from the impacts of very fast micrometeoroids. The impact with the first wall melts or breaks up the incoming particle, causing fragments to be spread over a wider area when striking the subsequent walls.

===Sloped===
Sloped armour is armour that is mounted at a non-vertical and non-horizontal angle, typically on tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles. For a given normal to the surface of the armour, its plate thickness, increasing armour slope improves the armour&#x27;s level of protection by increasing the thickness measured on a horizontal plane, while for a given area density of the armour the protection can be either increased or reduced by other sloping effects, depending on the armour materials used and the qualities of the projectile hitting it. The increased protection caused by increasing the slope while keeping the plate thickness constant, is due to a proportional increase of area density and thus mass, and thus offers no weight benefit. Therefore, the other possible effects of sloping, such as deflection, deforming and ricochet of a projectile, have been the reasons to apply sloped armour in armoured vehicles design. Another motive is the fact that sloping armour is a more efficient way of covering the necessary equipment since it encloses less volume with less material. The sharpest angles are usually seen on the frontal glacis plate, both as it is the hull side most likely to be hit and because there is more room to slope in the longitudinal direction of a vehicle.

===Reactive===
&quot;Explosive reactive armour&quot;, initially developed by German researcher Manfred Held while working in Israel, uses layers of high explosive sandwiched between steel plates. When a shaped-charge warhead hits, the explosive detonates and pushes the steel plates into the warhead, disrupting the flow of the charge&#x27;s liquid metal penetrator (usually copper at around 500 degrees Celsius; it can be made to flow like water by sufficient pressure). Traditional &quot;light&quot; ERA is less effective against kinetic penetrators. &quot;Heavy&quot; reactive armour, however, offers better protection. The only example currently in widespread service is Russian Kontakt-5. Explosive reactive armour poses a threat to friendly troops near the vehicle.

&quot;Non-explosive reactive armour&quot; is an advanced spaced armour which uses materials which change their geometry so as to increase protection under the stress of impact.

&quot;Active protection systems&quot; use a sensor to detect an incoming projectile and explosively launch a counter-projectile into its path.

===Slat===
Slat armour is designed to protect against anti-tank rocket and missile attacks, where the warhead is a shaped charge. The slats are spaced so that the warhead is either partially deformed before detonating, or the fuzing mechanism is damaged, thereby preventing detonation entirely. As shaped charges rely on very specific structure to create a jet of hot metal, any disruption to this structure greatly reduces the effectiveness of the warhead. Slat armour can be defeated by tandem-charge designs such as the RPG-27 and RPG-29.

===Electric armour===

Electric armour is a recent development in the United Kingdom by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory. A vehicle is fitted with two thin shells, separated by insulating material. The outer shell holds an enormous electric charge, while the inner shell is at ground. If an incoming HEAT jet penetrates the outer shell and forms a bridge between the shells, the electrical energy discharges through the jet, disrupting it. Trials have so far been extremely promising, and it is hoped that improved systems could protect against KE penetrators. The developers of the Future Rapid Effect System (FRES) series of armoured vehicles are considering this technology.

<text>In molecular biology, pertactin (PRN) is a highly immunogenic virulence factor of &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot;, the bacterium that causes pertussis. Specifically, it is an outer membrane protein that promotes adhesion to tracheal epithelial cells. PRN is purified from &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot; and is used for the vaccine production as one of the important components of acellular pertussis vaccine.

A large part of the N-terminus of the pertactin protein is composed of beta helix repeats. This region of the pertactin protein is secreted through the C-terminal autotransporter. The N-terminal signal sequences promotes the secretion of PRN into the periplasm through the bacterial secretion system (Sec) and consequently, the translocation into the outer membrane where it is proteolytically cleaved. The loops in the right handed β-helix of the N-terminus that protrudes out of cell surface (region R1) contains sequence repeats Gly-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Pro and the RGD domain Arg-Gly-Asp. This RGD domain allows PRN to function as an adhesin and invasin, binding to integrins on the outer membrane of the cell. Another loop of the extending β-helix is region 2 (R2) which contains Pro-Gln-Pro (PQP) repeats towards the C-terminus. This protein’s contribution to immunity is still premature. Reports suggest that R1 and R2 are immunogenic regions, however, recent studies regarding genetic variation of those regions prove otherwise.

== In &quot;B.bronchiseptica&quot; ==
Pertactin adheres to only ciliated epithelial cells of &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot; &quot;in vivo&quot;. However, &quot;in vitro&quot;, PRN does not adhere to either. PRN does however help provide resistance towards a hyperinflammatory response of innate immunity for &quot;B. bronchiseptica.&quot; With respect to the adaptive immunity, studies show that PRN plays a role in combating neutrophil-mediated clearance of &quot;B. bronchiseptica.&quot;

<text>Livery Dole in Exeter, Devon, is an ancient triangular site between what is today Heavitree Road and Magdalen Road, in the eastern suburbs of Exeter. It was most notoriously used as a place for executions, and has contained an almshouse and chapel since 1591.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Livery Dole&quot; is first recorded in a document of 1279 and probably derives from the Old English &quot;Leofhere&quot;, a man who owned the land, and &quot;dole&quot;, meaning a piece of land.

==Place of execution==

There were two places in Livery Dole used for executions. Until 1531, heretics were burned at the stake near the modern day junction of Magdalen Road and Barrack Road. From 1531 to 1818 hangings were performed on a site near College Avenue known as &quot;Magdalen Drop&quot;.

The most notable execution was the 1531 burning at the stake of the Protestant martyr Thomas Benet. Lighted furze was pushed into his face when he refused to deny as heresy his action of nailing on the west door of Exeter Cathedral a message proclaiming the pope to be an Anti-Christ and rejecting his supremacy in religious affairs.

In 1909 a monument in the form of an obelisk of Dartmoor granite was erected to Benet&#x27;s memory in nearby Denmark Road. This monument was designed by Harry Hems and was erected with money raised through public subscription. It also commemorates the martyrdom of Agnes Prest who in 1557 was burnt for heresy at the stake in Southernhay. Two bronze sculpted relief panels by Harry Hems on the base of the obelisk depict Benet banging on the door of the Cathedral and Prest burning at the stake. The following inscriptions are contained on two bronze plaques affixed on opposite sides of the base:

&quot;In grateful remembrance of Thomas Benet, M.A. who suffered at Livery Dole A.D. 1531 for denying the supremacy of the Pope and of Agnes Prest who suffered on Southernhay A.D. 1557 for refusing to accept the doctrine of Transubstantiation. Faithful unto death&quot;. 
And:

&quot;To the glory of God &amp; in honour of his faithful witnesses who near this spot yielded their bodies to be burned for love to Christ and in vindication of the principles of the Protestant Reformation this monument was erected by public subscription AD 1909. They being dead yet speak&quot;.

According to Charles Worthy, in his &quot;History of the Suburbs of Exeter&quot; (1892), the iron ring which was placed around the victims&#x27; bodies and the chain which attached them to the stake were found in 1851 during rebuilding work on the almshouses.

==Chapel and almshouses==

Occupying the apex, or easternmost part, of the triangular site is the Chapel of Saint Clarus, an English missionary martyred in about 894 near the River Epte in Normandy.

The present building made from red Heavitree stone dates from a re-building of 1592 by Sir Robert Dennis (died 1592) of Holcombe Burnell, but it was built originally between 1418 and 1439 to serve as a chantry in which to pray for the souls of persons executed on this spot.
The chapter roll of 1439 mentions the Livery Dole Chapel as &quot;Capella Sancti Clari extra portam australem infra parochiam de Hevetre&quot; (&quot;The Chapel of Saint Clarus outside the southern gate (of the City of Exeter) within the parish of Heavitree&quot;). In the year 1418 however the chapel was not included amongst a deed of that date found in the 19th century amongst the records of Exeter City Corporation listing all the other chapels in Heavitree, namely St Clements and St Eligius.

Sir Robert Dennis (1525–1592) of Holcombe Burnell and Bicton stated in his will dated 25 July 1592 and proved 22 September 1592, that he had &quot;designed to set aside a plot of ground and to erect an alms-house and chapel for a certain number of poor people with weekly stipends and certain yearly commodities, as would appear in a devise signed and sealed by him&quot;. He appointed his son Sir Thomas Dennis as sole executor, with the testator&#x27;s brothers Edward and Walter Dennis as overseers together with George Cary of Cockington and four others. He requested in his will that if he should die before its completion his son Sir Thomas Dennis should complete the building work &quot;in consideration of the love he bore him and that he had not disinherited him&quot;. He also directed his overseers to complete the work if his son should refuse to do so. Sir Robert did indeed die before the work was finished, and his son Sir Thomas Dennis completed the work in 1594. A &quot;peppercorn&quot; chief rent of one penny per annum was payable by the Livery Dole Hospital to the lord of the manor of Heavitree.

There is not the slightest doubt of this Sir Thomas Dennis having been the testator&#x27;s son, yet on a seemingly contemporary stone tablet erected over the entrance to the formerly existing quadrangle he was erroneously described as Sir Robert&#x27;s brother: &quot;These alms-houses were founded by Sir Robert Dennis, knight, in March 1591 and finished by Sir Thomas Dennis his brother (sic) in 1594&quot;. The tablet contains also a heraldic escutcheon sculpted in relief showing the following ten quarterings of the Dennis family. The Dennis almshouses occupy the central part of Livery Dole to the west of the chapel.

===Rolle family===

In the 17th century the Rolle family of Stevenstone was the heir of the Dennis family of Bicton. Henry Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (1708–1750) left in his will an endowment to &quot;The Hospital of Livery Dole&quot;. The almshouses were demolished and rebuilt in 1849 by Louisa, Lady Rolle (1794–1885), nee Trefusis, daughter of Robert George William Trefusis, 17th Baron Clinton (1764–1797), and widow of John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (died 1842) of Bicton House. In his will Lord Rolle stipulated that &quot;the patronage of the Livery Dole in Heavitree...shall be in the owner of my mansion house at Bicton&quot;, and he had left a life interest in that mansion to his widow. The original almshouses stood at the south-west side of the chapel, but the new buildings were positioned north-west of the chapel, which allowed space for lawns and gardens in front of them. Lady Rolle also rebuilt Bicton Church and Otterton Church. Following Lady Rolle&#x27;s death in 1885 the patronage descended to Lord Rolle&#x27;s residuary legatee, his widow&#x27;s nephew Hon. Mark (Trefusis) Rolle (1836–1907), second son of Charles Trefusis, 19th Baron Clinton.

===20th century===

The windows of St Clarus&#x27;s Chapel were destroyed by German bombing of Exeter in May 1942 during World War II. The chapel was restored by Mark Rolle&#x27;s nephew and heir Charles Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis, 21st Baron Clinton (1863–1957). The east window was rebuilt by him in 1946, and some mediaeval stained glass roundels from a tower in the demolished old Church at Bicton were inserted into the side windows in 1947.

The almshouses were extended in 1980.

==General Gordon Memorial==
At the apex of the Livery Dole triangle, where the two roads meet, was formerly situated a toll house. On that spot since 1885 and still standing today is a Victorian memorial lamp post bearing the inscription: &quot;Charles George Gordon, 26th January 1885&quot;. It was erected in memory of General Gordon who was killed in the Siege of Khartoum in 1885, and paid for by Prebendary Barnes, vicar of Heavitree, who was a friend of the General&#x27;s.

<text>Hornsund is a fjord on the western side of the southernmost tip of northern Norway&#x27;s Spitsbergen island.

The fjord&#x27;s mouth faces west to the Greenland Sea, and is wide. The length is , the mean depth is , and the maximal depth is . Hornsund cuts different geological formations, from the Precambrian to the west to the upper Mesozoic to the east, and it is perpendicular to the main regional fractures of Spitsbergen.
The coastline of Hornsund is diversified, with a number of bays at the mouths of mountainous glacial valleys. Some of these bays have appeared as late as the beginning of the last century due to recession of glaciers.

A Polish research station has been operating there since 1957.

==History==

The English explorer Jonas Poole visited Hornsund in 1610, giving the fjord its name after his men had brought back a reindeer antler. In 1613 the first whaling ships used Hornsund, the majority of which were driven away by the English. In 1614 the fjord was ceded to the Dutch, but only for this season. In 1617 and 1618 Dutch ships again used Hornsund, but were either driven away or had their goods stolen. Danish ships also resorted to the fjord in 1617, and were forced to give a fifth of their catch to the English. The English held a near monopoly on whaling in the bay until they abandoned it in the late 1650s. In 1634 there was a dispute between the London and Yarmouth ships there, resulting in the death of one man.

<doc id="1226820" wikidata="Q5501113" url="?curid=1226820" title="Freeport Doctrine">
<text>The Freeport Doctrine was articulated by Stephen A. Douglas on August 27, 1858, in Freeport, Illinois, at the second of the Lincoln-Douglas debates. Former one-term U.S. Representative Abraham Lincoln was campaigning to take Douglas&#x27;s U.S. Senate seat by strongly opposing all attempts to expand the geographic area in which slavery was permitted. Lincoln tried to force Douglas to choose between the principle of popular sovereignty proposed by the Kansas-Nebraska Act (which left the fate of slavery in a U.S. territory up to its inhabitants), and the majority decision of the United States Supreme Court in the case of &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;, which stated that slavery could not legally be excluded from U.S. territories (since Douglas professed great respect for Supreme Court decisions, and accused the Republicans of disrespecting the court, yet this aspect of the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; decision was contrary to Douglas&#x27;s views and politically unpopular in Illinois). Douglas responded that, despite the court&#x27;s ruling, slavery could be excluded from any territory by the refusal of the people living in that territory to pass laws favorable to slavery. Likewise, if the people of the territory supported slavery, legislation would provide for its continued existence.

Douglas&#x27;s actual words were:

&quot;The next question propounded to me by Mr. Lincoln is, Can the people of a Territory in any lawful way, against the wishes of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery from their limits prior to the formation of a State constitution? I answer emphatically, as Mr. Lincoln has heard me answer a hundred times from every stump in Illinois, that in my opinion the people of a Territory can, by lawful means, exclude slavery from their limits prior to the formation of a State constitution. Mr Lincoln knew that I had answered that question over and over again. He heard me argue the Nebraska bill on that principle all over the State in 1854, in 1855, and in 1856, and he has no excuse for pretending to be in doubt as to my position on that question. It matters not what way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the abstract question whether slavery may or may not go into a Territory under the Constitution, the people have the lawful means to introduce it or exclude it as they please, for the reason that slavery cannot exist a day or an hour anywhere, unless it is supported by local police regulations. Those police regulations can only be established by the local legislature; and if the people are opposed to slavery, they will elect representatives to that body who will by unfriendly legislation effectually prevent the introduction of it into their midst. If, on the contrary, they are for it, their legislation will favor its extension. Hence, no matter what the decision of the Supreme Court may be on that abstract question, still the right of the people to make a Slave Territory or a Free Territory is perfect and complete under the Nebraska bill. I hope Mr. Lincoln deems my answer satisfactory on that point.&quot;

By taking this position, Douglas was defending his popular sovereignty or &quot;Squatter Sovereignty&quot; principle of 1854, which he considered to be a compromise between pro-slavery and anti-slavery positions. It was satisfactory to the legislature of Illinois, which reelected Douglas over Lincoln to the Senate. However, the Freeport Doctrine, or &quot;Freeport Heresy&quot; as Southern Democrats called it, alienated many of them. Douglas had actually stated the essence of the doctrine previous to the debate at Freeport, but its prominent public assertion at Freeport contributed (along with other political disputes, such as over the Lecompton Constitution) to antagonizing those in the Southern United States who were demanding ever-increasing protections for slavery. These Southerners subsequently insisted on the Congressional repudiation of the Freeport Doctrine (i.e., the passage of slave codes for the territories), in order to block Douglas&#x27;s presidential bid in 1860. This led to the split of the Democratic party in 1860, and Douglas&#x27;s loss in the 1860 presidential election.

<doc id="1226822" wikidata="Q423671" url="?curid=1226822" title="Transforming growth factor">
<text>Transforming growth factor (, or TGF) is used to describe two classes of polypeptide growth factors, TGFα and TGFβ.

The name &quot;Transforming Growth Factor&quot; is somewhat arbitrary, since the two classes of TGFs are not structurally or genetically related to one another, and they act through different receptor mechanisms. Furthermore, they do not always induce cellular transformation, and are not the only growth factors that induce cellular transformation.

==Types==
* TGFα is upregulated in some human cancers. It is produced in macrophages, brain cells, and keratinocytes, and induces epithelial development. It belongs to the EGF family.
* TGFβ exists in three known subtypes in humans, TGFβ1, TGFβ2, and TGFβ3. These are upregulated in Marfan&#x27;s syndrome and some human cancers, and play crucial roles in tissue regeneration, cell differentiation, embryonic development, and regulation of the immune system. Isoforms of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β1) are also thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. They belong to the transforming growth factor beta family. TGFβ receptors are single pass serine/threonine kinase receptors.

==Function==
These proteins were originally characterized by their capacity to induce oncogenic transformation in a specific cell culture system, rat kidney fibroblasts. Application of the transforming growth factors to normal rat kidney fibroblasts induces the cultured cells to proliferate and overgrow, no longer subject to the normal inhibition caused by contact between cells.

<text>Gretchen Cryer ( Kiger; born October 17, 1935) is an American playwright, lyricist, and actress. Along with Nancy Ford, she created several successful stage musicals, including &quot;Shelter&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Getting My Act Together and Taking It on the Road&quot;, and &quot;The Last Sweet Days of Isaac&quot;. 

==Early life==
Cryer was born Gretchen Kiger in Dunreith, Indiana, the daughter of Louise Geraldine (née Niven; 1911-1991) and Earl William &quot;Bill&quot; Kiger, Jr. (1911-2004), who sold school supplies and ran a home printing business. Cryer attended DePauw University as an English major.

==Career==
In one of her music classes, she met Nancy Ford, and the two forged a friendship that eventually led to a number of professional collaborations as the first female composer-lyricist team in Off-Broadway and Broadway New York theater. Their first work, &quot;For Reasons of Royalty&quot;, was produced at DePauw University and their musical &quot;Rendezvous&quot; was done at Boston University.

Their first professional New York production was &quot;Now Is The Time For All Good Men&quot; (1967), a highly political piece about Cryer&#x27;s pacifist brother, who spent time as a teacher in a conservative mid-western high school, that was panned by the critics. Undaunted, they mounted &quot;The Last Sweet Days of Isaac&quot; – with Austin Pendleton and Fredricka Weber – in 1970, winning not only rave reviews, but the Obie, Drama Desk, and Outer Critics Circle Awards as well.

From there they moved to Broadway, but the musical, &quot;Shelter&quot; (1973), was not a success, despite a few good reviews. It would prove to be their only Broadway production. Using the pseudonym Sally Niven (Niven is her mother&#x27;s maiden name), Cryer played the leading role in &quot;Now Is the Time...&quot; opposite her real-life husband, David. Dagne Crane had originally been cast in the part, but left shortly before the opening to become a regular on the soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;.

Cryer and Ford&#x27;s most notable success was &quot;I&#x27;m Getting My Act Together and Taking It on the Road&quot; (1978), based on Cryer&#x27;s life experiences. She not only co-wrote the piece, but performed in it as well. Despite being lambasted by the critics, the show began to find an audience via word-of-mouth, and producer Joseph Papp moved it from his Public Theater in lower Manhattan to the Circle in the Square Downtown, where it ran from 12/14/1978 to 3/15/1981. Cryer and Ford&#x27;s latest musical, &quot;Einstein and the Roosevelts&quot;, premiered at DePauw University in October 2008.

Cryer appeared in the 1987 film &quot;Hiding Out&quot; as the aunt of her real-life son, Jon Cryer.

Cryer&#x27;s additional work as a performer included roles on Broadway in &quot;Little Me&quot; (1962), &quot;110 in the Shade&quot; (1963) and &quot;1776&quot; (1969). Recently, she appeared in two episodes of the Broadway Podcast Network&#x27;s anthology &quot;Around the Sun&quot; audio drama (written by Brad Forenza) as part of 2024&#x27;s Season 4: &quot;Artists Within&quot;&quot;––&quot;a metaphysical odyssey set amid the cosmos that features writer-performers in leading roles. 

==Personal life==
Cryer and her husband, actor/singer David Cryer, divorced in 1971. She has two daughters – Robin, who has appeared with her in cabaret shows, and Shelley, who is a theatrical make-up artist. Her son is film and television actor Jon Cryer.

Cryer is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma.

<text>George Thomas Morgan (June 28, 1924 – July 7, 1975) was a mid-20th-century American country music singer. He is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame and a former member of the Grand Ole Opry. He is best known for his 1949 hit single &quot;Candy Kisses&quot;. He was the father of singer Lorrie Morgan, who is also a country music star.

==Biography==
Morgan was born to Zachariah &quot;Zach&quot; Morgan and Ethel Turner in Waverly, Tennessee, United States, but was raised in Barberton, Ohio. He was, along with a few other contemporaries (most notably Eddy Arnold and Jim Reeves), referred to as a &quot;country crooner;&quot; his singing style being more similar to that of Bing Crosby or Perry Como than that of Ernest Tubb or Lefty Frizzell.

Morgan was a member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1948, and is best remembered for the Columbia Records song &quot;Candy Kisses&quot;, which was a No. 1 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country music chart for three weeks in 1949. He also had several hits based on a &quot;rose&quot; theme: &quot;Room Full of Roses&quot;, &quot;Red Roses for a Blue Lady&quot;, and &quot;Red Roses From the Blue Side of Town&quot;. His version of &quot;Almost&quot; (1952), written by Vic McAlpin and Jack Toombs, was Morgan&#x27;s second million selling record. In the early 1950s he hosted a 15-minute radio program syndicated nationally by RadiOzark Enterprises in Springfield, Missouri.

In 1974, Morgan was the last person to sing on the stage of the Ryman Auditorium, before the Grand Ole Opry moved to the new Grand Ole Opry House. A week later, he was the first to sing on stage at the venue.

==Death ==
He died in 1975 of a heart attack after undergoing open heart surgery, and was interred in the Spring Hill Cemetery in Madison, Tennessee.

==Personal life ==
His daughter, country music singer Lorrie Morgan, released two songs as duets with her late father dubbed in: &quot;I&#x27;m Completely Satisfied&quot; (1979) and &quot;From This Moment On&quot; (2006).

A&quot;Room Full of Roses&quot; also peaked at No. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

<text>The Mushrikites ( or , singular ) were the Arab polytheists who committed shirk and opposed the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his followers, the Muslims, in the early 7th century. Their leaders were mostly from the Quraysh, but others also belonged to the Qays.

After Muhammad&#x27;s declaration of prophethood, the Mushrikites harassed members of the nascent Muslim community and were led by Amr ibn Hisham (&quot;Abu Jahl&quot;). Following the increase of tensions between the Mushrik and the Muslims, Muhammad and his companions () migrated to the neighboring city of Medina, where the Islamic prophet was offered sovereignty over the city. An Islamic state was formed in Medina, which received vehement opposition from the Mushrikites, and subsequently, both parties fought at the Battle of Badr in 624, resulting in a defeat.

== Etymology ==
The word Mushrikites is the English term derived from the Arabic , which itself is derived from . The term is sometimes translated as &#x27;polytheists&#x27; as well. The Meccan polytheists who opposed Islam, were initially the ones to be referred to as the Mushrikites.

<doc id="1226841" wikidata="Q3283708" url="?curid=1226841" title="Penn &amp; Teller Get Killed">
<text>Penn &amp; Teller Get Killed is a 1989 black comedy film directed by Arthur Penn, starring the magicians Penn &amp; Teller, who play themselves in a satirical account of what the audience would perhaps imagine them doing in their daily lives. Most of the action involves Penn and Teller playing practical jokes on each other and Penn&#x27;s girlfriend, Carlotta (Caitlin Clarke). The final joke, as the title implies, has serious consequences for all three. It was the last theatrical film directed by Arthur Penn, and received mostly negative reviews from critics.

== Plot ==
Penn and Teller appear on a television show where Penn jokingly comments that he wishes someone were trying to kill him. Soon after, the magicians are off to a scheduled show in Atlantic City. At the airport, a religious zealot mockingly confronts Penn about his comments from the television show the night before. Teller and Carlotta play a prank on Penn while going through security and Penn gets back at Teller by planting a toy gun on him while at the airport.

After exposing fraudulent psychic surgery to Carlotta&#x27;s wealthy Uncle Ernesto, Penn and Teller are kidnapped by angry Filipinos wishing revenge for damaging their reputation. Immediately before being brutally tortured, the situation is revealed to Penn as a birthday prank played by Teller, Carlotta and Uncle Ernesto.

Soon after, while leaving the theatre from their nightly performance, someone opens fire on Penn, shooting him in the arm. Teller is accused of hiring an assassin as a joke, but as time goes on it becomes clear that Teller is not part of the joke. Teller purchases a gun for self-defense and &quot;femme fatale&quot; Officer MacNamara vows to keep Penn safe from snipers.

Officer MacNamara announces that a nameless villain, a supposed vehement Penn &amp; Teller fan who dresses and acts like Penn, has been arrested. Penn and Teller get to tour his bizarre apartment turned Penn &amp; Teller shrine. Teller innocuously disposes of his gun in a trashcan of the apartment. Shortly after MacNamara departs, Penn is stabbed in the stomach by an assailant on the street. Penn rushes off to the hospital where, once Teller is out of sight, he appears perfectly fine. Teller proceeds to pursue the would-be assassin in a peculiar chase scene back to the apartment.

The madman, dressed as Penn, forces Teller to enact a Penn &amp; Teller routine with him, hanging in gravity boots in front of a camera. He then uses duct tape to secure the hapless Teller to the gravity boot rig. Officer MacNamara returns and the assassin leaves to finish off Penn. MacNamara confesses to Teller her contempt of Penn and Teller. The confused Teller is able to grab the gun from the wastebasket and threatens MacNamara with it. He hears a voice behind him and as the individual grabs him, he shoots the individual only to realize it&#x27;s Penn, who appears to fall over dead.

MacNamara laughs, thinking that it&#x27;s a new joke. She then reveals herself as Carlotta. The implications of what has just happened suddenly catch up with them: The whole event had been a joke on Teller who turned everything around on the players. Teller, breaking silence for the first time, immediately thinks they switched the gun for a replica, but then realizes the gun he was holding is real and he just killed his partner. Teller turns the gun on himself.

Carlotta, stricken with grief, throws herself out the window. Upon returning to his apartment and finding everyone dead, the &quot;hired assassin&quot;, realizing he&#x27;ll certainly be implicated in the deaths, shoots himself. Others who come into the apartment and find the carnage shoot themselves. Gunshots are heard in the distance, while the Bee Gees song &quot;I Started a Joke&quot; plays in the background. In a voice-over, Penn explains this is the definitive end of it all.

<doc id="1226858" wikidata="Q1949189" url="?curid=1226858" title="Moses Isserles">
<text>Moses Isserles (; ; 22 February 1530 / 25 Adar I 5290 – 11 May 1572 / 18 Iyar 5332), also known by the acronym Rema, was an eminent Polish Ashkenazi rabbi, talmudist, and &quot;posek&quot; (expert in Jewish law). He is considered the &quot;Maimonides of Polish Jewry.&quot;

==Biography==
Isserles was born in Kraków, Poland. His father, Israel ben Josef (known as Isserl), was a prominent talmudist and independently wealthy, who had probably headed the community; his grandfather, Jehiel Luria, was the first rabbi of Brisk. (In an era which preceded the common use of surnames, Moses became known by his patronymic, Isserles.)

At first he studied at home, and then in Lublin under Rabbi Shalom Shachna, who would later become his father-in-law. Among his fellow pupils were his relative Solomon Luria (Maharshal)—later a major disputant of many of Isserles&#x27; halachic rulings, and Chayyim b. Bezalel, an older brother of the Maharal. His first wife died young, at the age of 20 and he later established the &quot;Rema Synagogue&quot; in Kraków in her memory (originally his house, built by his father in his honor—which he gave to the community). He later married the sister of Joseph ben Mordechai Gershon Ha-Kohen.

He returned to Kraków in 1549, establishing a large &quot;yeshiva&quot; where as a wealthy man, he supported his pupils. In his teaching, he was opposed to pilpul and emphasized simple interpretation of the Talmud. In 1553 he was appointed as dayan; he also served on the Council of the Four Lands. He was approached by many other well-known rabbis, including Yosef Karo, for Halachic decisions. He was one of the greatest Jewish scholars of Poland, and was the primary halakhic authority for European Jewry of his day. He died in Kraków and was buried next to his synagogue. On his tombstone is inscribed: &quot;From Moses (Maimonides) to Moses (Isserles) there was none like Moses&quot;. Until the Second World War, thousands of pilgrims visited his grave annually on Lag Ba&#x27;omer, his &quot;Yahrzeit&quot; (date of death).

Not only was Isserles a renowned Talmudic and legal scholar, but he was also learned in Kabbalah and studied history, astronomy, and philosophy. Many had criticized Maimonides&#x27; heavy use of philosophy, and these criticisms continued into Isserles&#x27; day. He, on the other hand, took a moderate approach despite being concerned with philosophy entering into education. He stated that philosophy should be learned only &quot;sporadically&quot;, and that religious scripture should always be held in a higher esteem. Around 1550, he had several correspondences with Rabbi Solomon Luria. Isserles represented the pro-philosophy aspect of study, while Luria was more critical.

Isserles taught that &quot;the aim of man is to search for the cause and the meaning of things.&quot; He also held that &quot;it is permissible to now and then study secular wisdom, provided that this excludes works of heresy... and that one [first] knows what is permissible and forbidden, and the rules and the mitzvot&quot;. Maharshal reproached him for having based some of his decisions on Aristotle. His reply was that he studied Greek philosophy only from Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, and then only on Shabbat and Yom Tov - and furthermore, it is better to occupy oneself with philosophy than to err through Kabbalah.

Despite his suggestions about learning philosophy sparingly, Isserles and his students are considered the &quot;first wave&quot; of philosophical learning within Polish Jewry and is deemed the &quot;Isserles School&quot; by Leonard S. Levin.

Isserles had several children: &quot;Drezil (named after his maternal grandmother), wife of R. Bunem Meisels. A daughter whose name is unknown to us... A son, R. Yehuda... A third daughter... who is totally unknown to us.&quot; He is buried in the eponymous Remuh Cemetery in Kraków.

==Genealogy==
A reputed descendant of King David through Rashi, he has many notable descendants, among which are included members of the Meisel family, alongside Rabbi Yakov Kuli Slonim, son-in-law of the Mittler Rebbe, the composers Felix Mendelssohn and Giacomo Meyerbeer, the pianist Julius Isserlis, the cellist Steven Isserlis, the author Inbali Iserles, the mathematician Arieh Iserles and the statistician Leon Isserlis.

==Approach==

Isserles is perhaps best known for his halakhic works, chief among them his notes to the Shulchan Aruch by Yosef Karo. He is noted for his approach to customs (minhagim): &quot;it should be remembered that R. Isserles did not regard the Jewish Minhag lightly. On the contrary, he too expressed reverence and respect for it, and whenever possible endeavored to uphold it and also to explain its origin. Only, unlike many great Talmudic scholars, he refused to follow it blindly. When convinced of the unsound basis of a Minhag, he was ready to repudiate it regardless of its acceptance by the people.&quot;

Furthermore: &quot;The Talmud is, of course, the great reservoir to which R. Isserles turns as the first step in attempting to solve a problem. The question at hand is immediately referred to an identical or similar case in the Talmud. The second step is the weighing of the opinions of the ראשונים, i.e. Alfasi (רי”ף), Tosafists, Nachmanides, etc. expanding and explaining the text. The opinion of the majority is followed by R. Isserles and even Maimonides, whom he respected very highly, is disregarded if he was in the minority. After the Rishonim, R. Isserles proceeds to examine writings of אחרונים, i.e. Mordechai, Ashri and Tur, and the latter is followed especially when the Tosafists agree with him. At this point, the Responsa of still later authorities are cited extensively in accordance with the well-established principle of הלכה כבתרא, paying due attention even to the opinions of contemporaries and to customs of Polish Jewry which the ב”י omitted. Thus, Isserles, in his responsa as well as in the ד”מ and his commentary on the Shulchan Aruch, served as a supplement and offered his community the code of Law adjusted to its authorities, customs, and needs. He spread the “cloth” over the table prepared by his contemporary, the ב”י.&quot;

Isserles, like Yosef Karo in the Shulchan Aruch, often quotes Kabbalistic sources and opinions in his various works, and writes of his great joy upon finding that his ruling concurred with what he later found written in the &quot;words of the Zohar which were given at Sinai...&quot;.

Writing to a friend who had become a rabbi in Germany, Isserles expressed his preference for living in Poland over Germany: &quot;You would be better off living with us in Poland on stale bread if need be, but safe&quot;.

==Works==
Isserles is renowned for his fundamental work of &quot;Halakha&quot; (Jewish law), entitled &quot;ha-Mapah&quot; (lit., &quot;the tablecloth&quot;), an inline commentary on the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; (lit. &quot;the set table&quot;), upon which his &quot;great reputation as a halakist and codifier rests chiefly.&quot;

===&quot;Darkhei Moshe&quot;===
Darkhei Moshe (דרכי משה) is a commentary on the &quot;Tur&quot; as well as on the &quot;Beth Yosef&quot;, which is Yosef Karo&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Tur&quot; and the work underlying the &quot;Shulkhan Aruch&quot;. Isserles had originally intended the &quot;Darkhei Moshe&quot; to serve as a basis for subsequent &quot;halakhic&quot; decisions. As such, in this work he evaluates the rulings of the &quot;Tur&quot;—which was widely accepted among the Ashkenazim and Sephardim—comparing these with rulings of other &quot;halakhic&quot; authorities. The &quot;Beth Yosef&quot; was published while Isserles was at work on the &quot;Darkhei Moshe&quot;. Recognizing that Karo&#x27;s commentary largely met his objectives, Isserles published the &quot;Darkhei Moshe&quot; in a modified form. &quot;In publishing the דרכי משה, R. Isserles rendered a great service to Ashkenazic Jewry, for he reestablished its Talmudic authorities as the deciding factor in determining a law.&quot; An abridgement of the original work is published with the &quot;Tur&quot;; the complete version of the &quot;Darkhei Moshe&quot; is published separately.

===&quot;HaMapah&quot;===
HaMapah (המפה) is written as a gloss to the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; of Yosef Karo, discussing cases where Sephardi and Ashkenazi customs differ. Hamapah is the &quot;tablecloth&quot; for the &quot;Shulkhan Aruch&quot;, the &quot;set table&quot;. Karo had based his normative positions on three authorities: Maimonides, Asher ben Jehiel (the Rosh), and Isaac Alfasi (the Rif). Of these, only Asher ben Jehiel had non-Sephardic roots, having lived most of his life in Germany before moving to Spain, but even so, his work is largely Sephardic in orientation. Isserles thus created a series of glosses, in which he supplemented Karo with material drawn from the laws and customs (&quot;Minhagim&quot;) of Ashkenazi Jewry, chiefly based on the works of Yaakov Moelin, Israel Isserlein and Israel Bruna.

All editions of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; since 1578 include &quot;HaMapah&quot; embedded in the text (introduced by the word: הגה &quot;Hagahah&quot;, meaning &quot;gloss&quot;), and distinguished by a semi-cursive &quot;Rashi script&quot;. Isserles&#x27; HaMapah was &quot;considered to be an interpretation and supplement to Karo&#x27;s work, while also challenging its claim to universal authority by introducing Ashkenazic traditions and customs that differed from the Sephardic ones. Rather than challenge the status of the Shulhan ‘Arukh, however, Isserles established the status of the Shulhan ‘Arukh as the authoritative text. In most of the editions since 1574, the Shulhan ‘Arukh was printed with HaMapah, thus creating an interesting tension that was realized on the printed page. It was an act of integrating the Sephardic tradition and its accommodation into the Ashkenazi world, the confirmation of the authority and its undermining appearing on the same page.&quot;

The citations &quot;indicating the sources in earlier authorities of the decisions in the annotations to the Shulchan Aruch, were not placed by Isserles. This may be seen from the fact that many times incorrect references are given. An anonymous scholar placed them at the end of each comment and gradually they have been mistaken as being indications of the author himself.&quot;

Isserles&#x27; weaving &quot;his comments into the main text as glosses, indicates, besides upholding the traditional Ashkenazi attitude to a text, that the work itself, meant to serve as a textbook for laymen, had been accepted in Rema&#x27;s yeshivah at Krakow as a students&#x27; reference book. Instead of the Arba‘ah Turim, the main text for the study of posekim in the Ashkenazi yeshivah up to Rema&#x27;s day, he chose to use the new book, which was free of accumulated layers of glosses and emendations, up-to-date and lucid, and arranged along the same lines as the old Turim so that it could easily be introduced into the yeshivah curriculum. This was the crucial step in altering the canonical status of the Shulhan Arukh.&quot;

Today, the term &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; refers to the combined work of Karo and Isserles. This consolidation of the two works strengthened the underlying unity of the Sephardi and Ashkenazi communities. It is through this unification that the &quot;Shulkhan Aruch&quot; became the universally accepted Code of Law for the entire Jewish people, with the notable exception of Yemenite Jews who still follow the &quot;Rambam&quot; (Maimonides).

=== &quot;Torat Ha-Olah&quot; ===
Torat Ha-Olah (תורת העלה), written between 1560 and 1570, was a discussion of the deeper meaning of the Temple in Jerusalem and the temple sacrifices. In addition to discussing the principles of the Jewish faith invoked, Isserles connects the Torah laws and symbols to philosophy, physics, astronomy, and Kabbalah. The title translates into the &quot;Law of the Burnt-Offering.&quot; In addition to citing the Tanakh and Talmud, Isserles heavily references the Midrash.

<doc id="1226869" wikidata="Q1401322" url="?curid=1226869" title="Valmara 69">
<text>Valmara 69 or V-69 is an Italian bounding anti-personnel mine manufactured by Valsella. The mine was developed from the V-59 mine, and although the mine is no longer produced in Italy, a number of copies were produced in other countries e.g. the &quot;SPM-1&quot; manufactured by Singapore.

The South African version was called the J-69, and was an identical copy of the Italian version. A single centre prong version was also produced. It is no longer produced by South Africa who are compliant with the Mine Ban Treaty requirements.

==Description==
The mine has a short tubular olive green or sand colored plastic body inside which is the steel bounding body of the mine. On top of the mine is a round fuze cap with five prongs. The mine is triggered when the fuze cap tilts, either because of pressure on one of the prongs or a pull on an attached tripwire. The tilting fuze mechanism is not affected by overpressure. When the mine is triggered, a spring-loaded firing pin fires a percussion cap inside the fuze, which ignites a propelling charge at the base of the mine. The propellant charge launches the mine up out of the ground and into the air.

When the mine reaches a height of approximately 50cm above ground, which takes less than one second, an integral tether wire (connecting it to the plastic body from which it was launched) tugs on a spring-loaded firing pin in the body of the mine, which detonates the main explosive charge. Embedded in a plastic fragmentation sleeve surrounding the main explosive charge are approximately 1,000 pre-cut steel fragments, which are projected at high velocity in all directions. The mine has a lethal radius of 25 m, but the fragments remain dangerous at a considerable distance beyond that, e.g. can inflict deeply penetrating eye wounds.

This mine has significant metal content, which makes it easy to find using a metal detector. However, like the majority of bounding mines, most of the Valmara 69 is hidden underground and may be difficult to see, particularly in heavy undergrowth. Additionally, the Valmara 69 may be laid along with minimum metal mines such as the VS-50, VS MK2, TS-50, SB-33 and SB-81, which complicates the clearance process.

Valsella also manufactured a completely separate electronic anti-handling device known as the VS-AR. This was a tilt-operated device, specifically designed to be fitted to any of the following Valsella products: the VS-50 (standard version, not the VS-50AR) and Valmara 69 anti-personnel mines, as well as the VS-1.6 and VS-1.2 anti-tank mines. The VS-AR4 has a series of fuze adaptors which allow it to be screwed into the bottom of any of those mines. It has a 10-minute mechanical arming delay (started by removing a pin) followed by a 30-minute electronic arming delay. The power source are two 1.5 V batteries and the operational life is longer than a year.

The Valmara 69 is found in Angola, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Kuwait, Mozambique, Sudan, and the Western Sahara

<doc id="1226871" wikidata="Q1326650" url="?curid=1226871" title="No Retreat, No Surrender">
<text>No Retreat, No Surrender is a 1985 martial arts film directed by Corey Yuen in his American film directorial debut. It is the first title in the &quot;No Retreat, No Surrender&quot; franchise, whose plot lines and characters are mostly unrelated. It stars Kurt McKinney, with a supporting cast of Jean-Claude Van Damme, J.W. Fails, Kathie Sileno, and Kim Tai-chung. The film was released in Italy on October 20, 1985, and in the United States on May 2, 1986. McKinney performs as Jason Stillwell, an American teenager who learns martial arts from the spirit of Bruce Lee. Stillwell uses these lessons to defend his martial arts dojo against Soviet martial artist Ivan Kraschinsky (Van Damme).

The film was written by Keith W. Strandberg, after being contracted by Ng See-yuen, the owner of Seasonal Film Corporation, to put together a script for them, despite not having done so before. Van Damme was cast in the film and caused problems on the set for continually physically contacting other actors and stuntmen during fight scenes, even after director Yuen told him not to. Upon release, the film received negative reviews, focusing on the story, which many critics found too similar to &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;, &quot;The Last Dragon&quot;, and &quot;Rocky IV&quot;.

==Plot==
Jason Stillwell is a young karate student and Bruce Lee fanatic who trains in his father Tom&#x27;s dojo in Sherman Oaks, California. One night after a training session, the dojo is visited by members of an organized crime syndicate looking to take over all the dojos in the country. After refusing to join the organization, Tom&#x27;s leg is broken by a Soviet martial artist named Ivan &quot;the Russian&quot; Krachinsky, one of the boss&#x27; hired thugs. A furious Jason tries to take revenge but is easily subdued by the Soviet. Tom discourages any further effort, telling his son that fighting is not the answer.

The Stillwell family relocates to Seattle, where Jason meets R.J. Madison, and they become good friends. Jason reunites with his old girlfriend Kelly Riley, who lives in the neighborhood with her brother, Ian &quot;Whirlwind&quot; Riley, the newly crowned U.S. National Karate Champion. Despite this, Jason has a hard time adjusting, as he and R.J. are constantly beaten and harassed by local bullies, led by an obese boy named Scott and arrogant martial artist Dean &quot;Shooting Star&quot; Ramsay. After getting beaten up and humiliated by Scott and Dean at Kelly&#x27;s birthday party, Jason visits the grave of Bruce Lee and asks him for help.

Later that night, Jason and Tom have a heated argument over Jason&#x27;s fighting. When Jason calls his father a coward for running away from the syndicate, Tom destroys some of Jason&#x27;s Bruce Lee memorabilia in the garage. Distraught, Jason consults with R.J., who helps him move all of his training gear into an empty house nearby. Exhausted from the move, Jason falls asleep at the house but is suddenly awakened by the soul of Bruce Lee, who begins to train him. Under Lee&#x27;s tutelage, Jason goes from a below-average fighter to a superior martial artist, at one point able to fend off several thugs who ambush his father in a parking lot. In doing so, Jason convinces him that there are times when fighting is necessary.

Later on, Jason, Tom, and R.J. attend an annual kickboxing tournament between the Seattle Sidekicks and the Manhattan Maulers. Before the contest can get under way, the crime syndicate interrupts and makes a wager that none of the Seattle fighters can defeat Ivan. While Dean and Frank are easily bested by the Soviet, Ivan&#x27;s last opponent, Ian, makes an impressive showing, forcing Ivan to resort to dirty tactics to defeat him. With Ian helplessly entangled in the ring ropes, Scott attempts to bite Ivan in the leg, but the Soviet dispatches him with a headbutt. Kelly tries to stop Ivan by hitting him with a stool, but the Soviet easily disarms her and grabs her by the hair. Angered by this, Jason charges to the ring and attacks Ivan, to the crowd&#x27;s delight. Utilizing his advanced training, Jason is finally able to conquer his nemesis and earns the respect of his peers and family, who celebrate with him as the frustrated crime syndicate leaves Seattle.

==Production==
===Development and writing===
After living in Taiwan for a year in the early 1980s, screenwriter Keith W. Strandberg became interested in working in martial arts films as an actor. He moved back to the United States and became a tour director in China, from where he continued to visit Hong Kong to make contact with producers and screenwriters. After being turned down by several studios, including Shaw Brothers, Strandberg read about Seasonal Film Corporation and got in contact with the studio head, Ng See-yuen. Ng expressed an interest in making an American film and asked if Strandberg knew anything about screenplays; Strandberg lied that he did. A year later, Ng contacted Strandberg in America, stating that he wanted to write a script for them. Strandberg wrote a draft of what would become &quot;No Retreat, No Surrender&quot;. While production began on the film, Strandberg was on set and spent hours every night changing the script to improve its quality while filming.

===Casting===
Jean-Claude Van Damme was cast as the Soviet villain, Ivan Kraschinsky. On set, he performed a roundhouse kick on Pete Cunningham, rendering him unconscious. Actor and martial artist Timothy Baker stated that during action scenes on the set, the production manager and director Corey Yuen instructed Van Damme to not make contact with the other actors and stuntmen. Despite repeated warnings, Van Damme continued to do so, performing kicks on Baker during filming. Other actors and martial artists claimed that Van Damme had not been reckless with his physical contact, including Ron Pohnel, who said, &quot;His control wasn&#x27;t such as mine, but I had no complaints&quot;. Van Damme originally had a two-picture deal with Strandberg but broke his contract.

==Release==
===Home media===
While there was never a DVD release in the United States, a Blu-ray edition of the film was published by Kino Lorber Classics in Region A, on February 21, 2017, which contained both the American theatrical release and a longer international cut.

==Reception and legacy==
===Box office===
&quot;No Retreat, No Surrender&quot; was released on May 2, 1986. It was the eleventh-highest grossing film on its opening week at the American box office, earning $739,723; it grossed a total of $4,662,137 in the United States and Canada.

The film sold tickets in the United States and 395,013 in France.

===Critical response===
Walter Goodman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a negative review, writing that the story appeared to have been &quot;slapped-together&quot;. &quot;Time Out&quot; compared it to &quot;The Last Dragon&quot;, &quot;Karate Kid&quot;, and &quot;Rocky IV&quot;, noting that it &quot;borrows heavily&quot; from those films and &quot;makes them look like masterpieces&quot;. Martial arts magazine &quot;Black Belt&quot; gave the film a rating of one-and-a-half out of five, noting that Jean-Claude Van Damme does not have much screen time and that the film was derivative of &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;. Patrick Goldstein of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;hilariously bad&quot; and an &quot;amateurish clunker&quot; with poor action scenes.

In 1993, &quot;Black Belt&quot; placed the film at seventh on their list of top-ten choreographed martial arts films. The magazine specifically praised Van Damme&#x27;s jump kicks, while noting that McKinney&#x27;s look &quot;suspiciously quick&quot;, mentioning that, &quot;unlike the Hong Kong movie industry, American filmmakers have yet to master the technique of speeding up the film without &quot;jumpy/fidgety&quot; side effects&quot;. In 2017, Ed Travis of &quot;Cinapse&quot; said the film &quot;manages to entertain and delight with a combination of pure earnestness and legitimately cool fight work&quot;. Austin Trunick of &quot;Under the Radar&quot; said Van Damme&#x27;s scenes &quot;are prime Van Damme, at least, with some fantastic fight choreography and a full showcase of splits, high-kicks, and bug-eyed snarling&quot;.

The film was riffed live at a number of venues on the &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000 Live: The Great Cheesy Movie Tour&quot;, by Joel Hodgson, in 2019. It was also riffed by RiffTrax on October 15, 2015.

<doc id="1226874" wikidata="Q1068135" url="?curid=1226874" title="Illinois Route 31">
<text>Illinois Route 31 (IL 31) is a north–south state highway in northeastern Illinois, United States. It travels from U.S. Route 34 (US 34) in Oswego north to US 12, near the Wisconsin state line, just south of Richmond.

==Route description==

IL 31 follows the Fox River along the western bank. It parallels IL 25, which travels along the eastern bank of the Fox River. It travels concurrent with IL 120 in McHenry.

IL 31 is called Richmond Road north of IL 120 and Front Street south of IL 120 in McHenry, Main Street in Algonquin, Western Avenue in Carpentersville, Eighth Street in West Dundee, State Street in Elgin, La Fox Street in South Elgin, Second Street in St. Charles, First Street in Geneva, Batavia Avenue in Batavia, Lincolnway Street in North Aurora, Lake Street (Southbound) and River Street (Northbound) in Aurora, and Lake Street in Montgomery. It is also, along with IL 25, signed as part of the Fox River Valley area. IL 31 between Aurora and Geneva was considered part of the Lincoln Highway transcontinental route.

The Western Algonquin Bypass was completed in 2014 and redirects traffic around downtown Algonquin.

==History==
SBI Route 31 traveled from Quincy to Canton along various routes. This was dropped in 1935 and was replaced with US 24. In 1937, it was reapplied along other routes on its modern routing. There have been no changes to the routing since.

===U.S. Route 430===

U.S. Route 430 (US 430) was commissioned from 1926 to 1935 in the U.S. state of Illinois, and traveled from Aurora to Crystal Lake. It traveled concurrently with US 30 from Aurora to Geneva at present-day IL 38. In 1934, US 430 was removed north of West Dundee after US 14 was formed. In 1935, US 430 was decommissioned after US 330 was extended north from Geneva to West Dundee. The northern extension was later removed in 1937 in favor of IL 31 and the western extension of US 330 to Dixon.

==Future==
===McHenry===
The intersection of IL 31 and IL 120 is now the most congested intersection in McHenry County.

IDOT is currently in Phase 1 of a planned widening of IL 31 from IL 176 in Crystal Lake to IL 120 in McHenry.

A bypass of McHenry continues to appear in documents planning for a Metra station at Prairie Grove, that include an interchange with the existing IL 31 alignment and the proposed west McHenry bypass alignment to the north of Gracy Road.

The west McHenry bypass was originally planned to travel over undeveloped farm lands from north of IL 31 and Gracy Road to IL 120 and Ringwood Road. The corridor was planned to be protected from development in the mid-1990s, but because of a lack of funding, the corridor was never protected from development and has since been developed.

<text>Antillean Creole (also known as Lesser Antillean Creole, Kreyol, or Patois) is a French-based creole that is primarily spoken in the Lesser Antilles. Its grammar and vocabulary include elements of French, Carib, English, and African languages.

== Geographical situation ==
There are two main geographical and linguistic groups in the Antilles or Caribbean Islands: the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles. Intercomprehension between these two groups is possible, but despite a large proportion of shared vocabulary and largely similar grammatical functioning, it is limited by varying key vocabulary and different words for basic grammar. Nevertheless, it is easy to begin to understand each other completely, as long as one of the two has a basic knowledge of the other&#x27;s language.

Antillean Creole is spoken natively, to varying degrees, in Haïti, Saint Lucia, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Îles des Saintes, Martinique, Saint-Barthélemy (St. Barts), Dominica, French Guiana, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela (mainly in Macuro, Güiria and El Callao Municipality). It is also spoken in various Creole-speaking immigrant communities in the United States Virgin Islands, British Virgin Islands, and the Collectivity of Saint Martin. Antillean Creole has approximately thirteen million speakers and is a means of communication for migrant populations traveling between neighboring English- and French-speaking territories. Since French is a Romance language, French Antillean Creole is considered to be one of Latin America&#x27;s languages by some linguists.

In a number of countries (including Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, Trinidad, Brazil (Lanc-Patuá) and Venezuela) the language is referred to as &quot;patois&quot;. It has historically been spoken in nearly all of the Lesser Antilles, but its number of speakers has declined in Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada. Conversely, it is widely used on the islands of Dominica and Saint Lucia; though they are officially English-speaking, there are efforts to preserve the use of Antillean Creole, as there are in Trinidad and Tobago and its neighbour, Venezuela. In recent decades, Creole has gone from being seen as a sign of lower socio-economic status, banned in school playgrounds, to a mark of national pride.

Since the 1970s, there has been a literary revival of Creole in the French-speaking islands of the Lesser Antilles, with writers such as Raphaël Confiant and Monchoachi employing the language. Édouard Glissant has written theoretically and poetically about its significance and its history.

==History==
Pierre Belain d&#x27;Esnambuc was a French trader and adventurer in the Caribbean who established the first permanent French colony, Saint-Pierre, on the island of Martinique in 1635. Belain sailed to the Caribbean in 1625, hoping to establish a French settlement on the island of St. Christopher (St. Kitts). In 1626, he returned to France, where he won the support of Cardinal Richelieu to establish French colonies in the region. Richelieu became a shareholder in the Compagnie de Saint-Christophe, created to accomplish that with d&#x27;Esnambuc at its head. The company was not particularly successful, and Richelieu had it reorganised as the Compagnie des Îles de l&#x27;Amérique. In 1635, d&#x27;Esnambuc sailed to Martinique with 100 French settlers to clear land for sugarcane plantations.

After six months on Martinique, d&#x27;Esnambuc returned to St. Christopher, where he soon died prematurely in 1636, leaving the company and Martinique in the hands of his nephew, Jacques Dyel du Parquet, who inherited d&#x27;Esnambuc&#x27;s authority over the French settlements in the Caribbean. Dyel du Parquet became governor of the island. He remained in Martinique and did not concern himself with the other islands.

The French permanently settled on Martinique and Guadeloupe after being driven off Saint Kitts and Nevis () by the British. Fort Royal (now Fort-de-France) on Martinique was a major port for French battle ships in the region from which the French were able to explore the region. In 1638, Dyel du Parquet decided to have Fort Saint Louis built to protect the city against enemy attacks. From Fort Royal, Martinique, Du Parquet proceeded south in search for new territories, established the first settlement in Saint Lucia in 1643 and headed an expedition that established a French settlement in Grenada in 1649.

Despite the long history of British rule, Grenada&#x27;s French heritage is still evident by the number of French loanwords in Grenadian Creole and the French-style buildings, cuisine and placenames (Petit Martinique, Martinique Channel, etc.)

In 1642, the Compagnie des Îles de l&#x27;Amérique received a 20-year extension of its charter. The king would name the governor general of the company, and the company would name the governors of the various islands. However, by the late 1640s, Cardinal Mazarin had little interest in colonial affairs, and the company languished. In 1651, it dissolved itself, selling its exploitation rights to various parties. The Du Paquet family bought Martinique, Grenada and Saint Lucia for 60,000 livres. The sieur d&#x27;Houël bought Guadeloupe, Marie-Galante, La Desirade and the Saintes. The Knights of Malta bought Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin and then sold them in 1665 to the Compagnie des Indes occidentales, formed one year earlier.

Dominica is a former French and British colony in the Eastern Caribbean, about halfway between the French islands of Guadeloupe (to the north) and Martinique (to the south). Christopher Columbus named the island after the day of the week on which he spotted it, a Sunday (), on 3 November 1493. In the 100 years after Columbus&#x27;s landing, Dominica remained isolated. At the time, it was inhabited by the Island Caribs, or Kalinago people. Over time, more settled there after they had been driven from surrounding islands, as European powers entered the region.

In 1690, French woodcutters from Martinique and Guadeloupe begin to set up timber camps to supply the French islands with wood and gradually become permanent settlers. France had a colony for several years and imported slaves from West Africa, Martinique and Guadeloupe to work on its plantations. The Antillean Creole language developed.

France formally ceded possession of Dominica to Great Britain in 1763. The latter established a small colony on the island in 1805. As a result, Dominica uses English as an official language, but Antillean Creole is still spoken as a secondary language because of Dominica&#x27;s location between the French-speaking departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique.

In Trinidad, the Spanish possessed the island but contributed little towards advancements, with El Dorado being their focus. Trinidad was perfect for its geographical location. Because Trinidad was considered underpopulated, Roume de St. Laurent, a Frenchman living in Grenada, was able to obtain a Cédula de Población from King Charles III of Spain on 4 November 1783.

Trinidad&#x27;s population jumped to over 15,000 by the end of 1789, from just under 1,400 in 1777. In 1797, Trinidad became a British crown colony, despite its French-speaking population.

===Origin of creole===
Antillean Creole began as the pidgin &quot;baragouin&quot; in 1635. It was spoken by French settlers, the Africans they enslaved, and Aboriginal peoples that resided on the islands. It originated in the Guadeloupe and Martinique areas of the Lesser Antilles. It was not until 1700, when there was an increase in African influences, that this pidgin transitioned into the creole that it is today. The formation of this creole was influenced by many different dialects and languages. These include dialects of French, other European languages, Carib (both Karina and Arawakan), and African languages.

Due to the influences from its origins, this creole has some distinctive linguistic features. Features of French included in Lesser Antillean Creole include infinitive forms of verbs, the use of only the masculine noun forms, oblique pronouns, and its subject to verb word order. Features from African languages include their verbal marking system as well as providing a West-African substrate. Other features of this creole also include doubling to emphasize a sentence, the word &quot;point&quot; to inflect the negative, and the non-distinguished adverbs and adjectives.

The language emerged in a context of plantation slavery in the French Antilles. Due to differing native tongues, it was difficult for French settlers to communicate with the enslaved Africans and vice versa, as well as for slaves of different ethnic origins to communicate between each other. As a result, they were forced to develop a new form of communication by relying on what they heard from their colonial enslavers and other slaves. According to Jesuit missionary Pierre Pelleprat, French settlers would change their way of speaking to a simpler form to be more accommodating to the enslaved people. For example, to say &quot;I have not eaten&quot; settlers would say &quot;moi point manger&quot; even though the proper French translation is &quot;Je n&#x27;ai pas mangé&quot;. This simpler form of French, along with linguistic influences from other languages, eventually evolved into Antillean Creole.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
: This sound occurs on islands where the official language is English in certain loanwords e.g .
: The uvular r only occurs on islands wherein French is an official language. Otherwise, where the uvular r would occur where other dialects use . Furthermore, this sound is usually pronounced as a velar fricative and is much softer than the European French .

===Vowels===



==Orthography==


There is some variation in orthography between the islands. In St. Lucia, Dominica and Martinique &#x27;dj&#x27; and &#x27;tj&#x27; are used whereas in Guadeloupe &#x27;gy&#x27; and &#x27;ky&#x27; are used. These represent differences in pronunciations. Several words may be pronounced in various ways depending on the region:

: &#x27;heart&#x27;
: kè 
: kyè 
: tjè 

The letter &#x27;r&#x27; in St. Lucia and Dominica represents the English whereas in Guadeloupe and Martinique it represents the more French-like sound .

==Grammar==


#Mon is used in Dominica and in Grenada #man is used in Martinique. An is used in Guadeloupe, but less so in the latter.
# m, ng, and n are contracted forms of mwen which occur before certain verb particles: Mwen pa → m&#x27;a, mwen ka → ng&#x27;a or n&#x27;a mwen kay → ng&#x27;ay or n&#x27;ay
# w and y occur after a vowel: Nonm-lan wè i → Nonm-lan wè&#x27;y, Koumonon ou? → Koumonon&#x27;w?
# li occurs after consonants: Ou konnèt i? → Ou konnèt li?

Personal pronouns in Antillean Creole are invariable so they do not inflect for case as in European languages such as French or English. This means that mwen, for example, can mean I, me or my; yo can mean they, them, their etc.
Possessive adjectives are placed after the noun; kay mwen &#x27;my house&#x27;, manman&#x27;w &#x27;your mother&#x27;

&#x27;ou&#x27; and &#x27;li&#x27; are used after nouns ending in a consonant and &#x27;w&#x27; and &#x27;y&#x27; after nouns ending in a vowel. All other possessive adjectives are invariable.

Kaz ou - Your house, Kouto&#x27;w - Your knife

Madanm li - His wife, Sésé&#x27;y - Her sister

=== Indefinite article ===
The indefinite article is placed before the noun and can be pronounced as &quot;on, an, yon, yan&quot;. The word &quot;yonn&quot; means &quot;one&quot;.

On chapo, Yon wavèt

An moun, Yan tòti

=== Definite article ===

This example does not work for Guadeloupe Creole where article are always &quot;la&quot;, and for Haitian creole whose article are more similar but have &quot;nan&quot; in addition.

In Creole, there are five definite articles (la, lan, a, an, nan) which are placed &quot;after&quot; the nouns they modify, in contrast to French. The final syllable of the preceding word determines which is used with which nouns.

If the last sound is an oral consonant and is preceded by an oral vowel, it becomes &quot;la&quot;:

If the last sound is an oral consonant and is preceded by a nasal vowel, it becomes &quot;lan&quot;:

If the last sound is an oral vowel and is preceded by an oral consonant, it becomes &quot;a&quot;:

If a word ends in a nasal vowel, it becomes &quot;an&quot;:

If the last sound is a nasal consonant, it becomes &quot;nan&quot;, but this form is rare and is usually replaced by &quot;lan&quot;:

Note that in Guadeloupean Creole there is no agreement of sounds between the noun and definite article and &quot;la&quot; is used for all nouns

Demonstrative article

Like the definite article this is placed after the noun. It varies widely by region.

Verbs in Creole are invariable and unlike French or English have no inflection to distinguish tenses. A series of particles placed before the verb indicate tense and aspect. There is no Subjunctive mood.

==Vocabulary==
The vocabulary of Antillean Creole is based mostly on French, with many contributions from West African languages, Spanish, English and Amerindian languages.

==Varieties==

===Martinican Creole French===
Martinican Creole is widely spoken in Martinique which had mixed between French and African languages developed between the white settlers and the slaves from Africa who has settled in the New World. Martinique&#x27;s history and its origin were the Arawaks that became the first known inhabitants along with the Carib tribes before the Spanish led by Christopher Columbus arrive in Martinique in 1502 and claimed it for Spain before handing over to the French in 1635 by King Louis XIV of France which affected as the Code Noir which tens of thousands of slaves from Africa were taken to the new French colony of Martinique. The elements of Martinican Creole was mixed with English, Spanish, Portuguese, Indian, African, Amerindian and other ethnic minorities as a mixture of blend like Haitian Creole and Louisiana Creole once the French settlers along with their African slaves became the heart of the French Caribbean. Martinican Creole is a regional language because the island has European, British, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Indians (&quot;Tamils&quot;), Blacks (&quot;Africans&quot;), Martinicans, Caribs and others. It is considered part of Overseas France and a European region which became an Overseas département on 19 March 1946. Martinique shares characteristics with both the Caribbean and Latin America as a whole, with various African language that develops Martinican Creole had bring more closely tied to the latter due to its French, Spanish and Latin connections with the black majority.

===Dominican Creole French===
Dominican Creole French is the generally-spoken language in Dominica.
Its mutual intelligibility rate with other varieties of Antillean Creole is almost 100%. Its syntactic, grammatical and lexical features are virtually identical to that of Martinican Creole, but like its Saint Lucian counterpart, it has more English loanwords than the Martinican variety. People who speak Haitian Creole can also understand Dominican Creole French. Even though there are a number of distinctive features, they are mutually intelligible.

Like the other Caribbean Creoles, Dominican French Creole combines a syntax of African and Carib origin with a vocabulary primarily derived from French.

===Saint Lucian Creole French===
Saint Lucian Creole French is commonly spoken in Saint Lucia. Its syntactic, grammatical and lexical features are virtually identical to that of Martinican Creole.

Like the other Caribbean creoles, Saint Lucian French Creole combines a syntax of African and Carib origin with a vocabulary primarily derived from French. The language can be considered to be mutually intelligible with French creoles of the Lesser Antilles and is related to Haitian Creole, which has nonetheless a number of distinctive features.

It is still widely spoken in Saint Lucia. In the mid-19th century, migrants took the language with them to Panama, where it is now moribund.

===Grenadian Creole French===
Historically, French, or French Creole, was the language of the large majority of the inhabitants, enslaved Africans and estate owners. Though the new British administrators spoke English, French was still predominant.

Grenadian Creole French is a variety of Antillean Creole French. In Grenada and among Grenadians, it is referred to as &quot;Patois&quot; or &quot;French Patois&quot;. It was once the lingua franca in Grenada and was commonly heard as recently as 1930 when children in some rural areas could speak it. In the 21st century, it can be heard only among elderly speakers in a few small pockets of the country. They are becoming fewer and fewer because unlike St. Lucia and Dominica, which lie close to the French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, Grenada does not have Kwéyòl-speaking neighbours to keep the language alive.

Additionally, the language is not taught in schools.

===Trinidadian French Creole===
Trinidadian French Creole is a French Creole (Patois) of Trinidad spoken by descendants of the French Creole migrants from the French Antilles.

The Cedula of Population of 1783 laid the foundation and growth of the population of Trinidad. French planters and the Africans they enslaved, free coloureds and mulattos, from the French Antilles of Martinique, Grenada, Guadeloupe and Dominica, migrated to Trinidad during the French Revolution. The immigrants establishing local communities of Blanchisseuse, Champs Fleurs, Paramin, Cascade, Carenage, Laventille, etc. Trinidad&#x27;s population, which numbered less than 1,400 in 1777, soared to over 15,000 by the end of 1789.

In 1797, Trinidad became a British crown colony, with a French-speaking and Patois-speaking population. Today, Trinidadian French Creole can be found spoken in regional pockets among the elders, particularly in the villages of Paramin and Lopinot.

<text>Jaycar, formerly Jaycar Electronics, is an Australia-based retailer dealing in electronic components and related products for electronics enthusiasts. The company owns around 110 stores across Australia and New Zealand, and also sells its products online in the UK and US. It was founded in 1981 by Gary Johnston, who remained managing director until his death in 2021.

The company also has a wholesale arm, Electus Distribution.

==History==
Jaycar was founded when Gary Johnston, a former Dick Smith Electronics employee, purchased John Carr &amp; Co. Pty Ltd. He became managing director of the company.

In 2005, Jaycar received negative attention from its imported Taiwanese &quot;Choke-A-Chicken&quot; toy that squawked and flapped its wings when strangled around its neck, described by the RSPCA Queensland as &quot;grossly irresponsible&quot;.

In October 2012, remarks made by Johnston on Sydney radio station 2GB, seen as providing justification for sexist behaviour by unidentified staff at the Canterbury-Bankstown NRL club (Bulldogs), of which Jaycar was a major sponsor at the time, caused controversy. There were calls to boycott Jaycar stores.

In October 2016, Freetronics owner Jonathan Oxer accused Jaycar of copying his business&#x27; open source Arduino Experimenters kit in two videos posted to his YouTube channel.

In September 2018 Johnston ended Jaycar&#x27;s sponsorship of the Bulldogs, following questionable behaviour from players during Mad Monday celebrations.

Johnston died on 10 March 2021, after being diagnosed with mesothelioma two weeks earlier.

==Description==

, Jaycar has over 110 stores across Australian and New Zealand, and more than 170 authorised stockists and agents that carry Jaycar products. The group also owns a number of Road Tech Marine stores.

Electus Distribution is Jaycar&#x27;s wholesale arm. It operates as a separate company and provides products to independent and other retailers, as well as original equipment manufacturers, in Australia and New Zealand.

==Community involvement==

Jaycar became a major sponsor of NRL club Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in 2009, but questionable behaviour from players led Johnston to end the partnership in September 2018. Jaycar sponsors Warby Motorsport and a number of local sports teams. Jaycar has sponsored the Western Suburbs Magpies rugby league team, based in western Sydney, since 2019. Johnston had been a &quot;lifelong supporter&quot;.

The company has supported or hosted maker culture events, and supports several charities, including:
*Starlight Children&#x27;s Foundation
*Charlie Teo Foundation
*Operation Restore Hope
*FSHD Global Research Foundation
*Steve Waugh Foundation
*Exodus Foundation
*Save our Sons

<text>Xuyun or Hsu Yun (; 5 September 1840? – 13 October 1959) was a renowned Chinese Chan Buddhist master and an influential Buddhist teacher of the 19th and 20th centuries.

==Early life==
Xuyun was purportedly born on 5 September 1840 in Fujian, Qing China. His original name was Xiao Guyan (). He was the son of Xiao Yutang () and his mother was surnamed Yan (). His mother died during childbirth. Xuyun&#x27;s grandmother insisted that her grandson take a wife. In order to continue both his and his uncle&#x27;s lineage, Xuyun was arranged to marry one woman from the Tian family and one from the Tan family.

His first exposure to Buddhism was during the funeral of his grandmother. Soon afterward he began reading Buddhist sutras and later made a pilgrimage to Mount Heng, one of the most important Buddhist sites in China.

When he was fourteen years old, Xuyun announced that he wished to renounce the material world in favour of monastic life. His father did not approve of Buddhism and had him instructed in Taoism instead. Xuyun was dissatisfied with Taoism, which he felt could not reach the deeper truths of existence. The storerooms of his house were full of very old books. Going through them, he found a volume called the &quot;Story of Incense Mountain&quot; (cf. Guanyin#Miaoshan), which described the life of Guanyin. After reading the book, he was deeply influenced and was inspired to leave home and practice Buddhism as a monk.

When Xuyun was seventeen, he attempted to flee to Mount Heng to become a monk without his family&#x27;s permission. On a winding mountain path, he encountered envoys sent by his uncle who successfully intercepted Xuyun and escorted him back home. When he arrived home, the family feared that he would escape again, so he was sent with his first cousin, Fu Guo (), to Quanzhou. His father formally received two brides from the Tian and Tan families for Xuyun, and his marriage was completed. Although they lived together, Xuyun did not have sexual contact with his wives. Moreover, he extensively explained the dharma to them so that they too would practice Buddhism.

Fu Guo also had previously explored Buddhism and had the same aspirations as Xuyun, so they &quot;amicably traveled the Path together.&quot; When Xuyun was nineteen years old, he began the journey to Gu Shan (Drum Mountain) in Fuzhou, accompanied by Fu Guo. Before leaving, he wrote the &quot;Song of the SkinBag&quot; which he left behind for his two wives.

At Gu Shan monastery, Xuyun had his head shaved and received ordination as a monk. When his father sent agents to find him, Xuyun concealed himself in a grotto behind the monastery, where he lived in solitude for three years. At the age of twenty-five, Xuyun learned that his father had died, and his stepmother and two wives had entered the monastic life.

==Middle Age and Enlightenment==

During his years as a hermit, Xuyun made some of his most profound discoveries. He visited the old master Yong-jing, who encouraged him to abandon his extreme asceticism in favor of temperance. He instructed the young monk in the sutras and told him to be mindful of the Hua Tou. In his thirty-sixth year, with the encouragement of Yong-jing, Xuyun went on a seven-year pilgrimage to Mount Putuo off the coast of Ningbo, a place regarded by Buddhists as the bodhimaṇḍa of Avalokiteśvara. He went on to visit the Temple of King Ashoka and various Chan holy places. By age forty-three, Xuyun had left home life for more than twenty years, but had not yet completed his practice in the Path. He had not repaid his parents&#x27; kindness, and so he vowed to again make a pilgrimage to Nan Hai. From Fa Hua Temple all the way to Qingliang Peak at Mount Wutai of the northwest, the bodhimaṇḍa of Manjushri, he made one full prostration every three steps. He prayed for the rebirth of his parents in the Pure Land. Along the way, Xuyun is said to have met a beggar called Wen Ji, who twice saved his life. After talking with the monks at Mount Wutai, Xuyun came to believe that the beggar had been an incarnation of Manjushri.

Having achieved singleness of mind, Xuyun traveled west and south, making his way through Tibet. He visited many monasteries and holy places, including Sichuan&#x27;s Mount Emei, the bodhimaṇḍa of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, the Potala Palace, the seat of the Dalai Lama, and Tashilhunpo Monastery, the seat of the Panchen Lama. He traveled through India and Ceylon, and then across the sea to Burma. During this time of wandering, he felt his mind clearing and his health growing stronger. Xuyun composed a large number of poems during this period.

After returning to China at age fifty-three, Xuyun joined with other Venerable Masters Pu Zhao, Yue Xia, and Yin Lian (Lotus Seal) to study together. They climbed Mount Jiuhua (bodhimaṇḍa of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva) and repaired the huts on Cui Feng Summit, where Dharma Master Pu Zhao expounded the Mahavaipulyabuddha Avatamsaka (Flower Adornment) Sutra.

When Xuyun was fifty-six, the Abbot Yue Lang of Gaomin Temple in Yangzhou was going to convene a twelve-week session of continuous dhyana meditation. Preparing to leave, the group asked Xuyun to go first. After reaching Di Gang, he had to cross the water, but the ferry left without him as he had no money. As he walked along the river&#x27;s edge, he suddenly lost his footing and fell into the rushing water, where he bobbed helplessly for a day and night before being caught in a fisherman&#x27;s net. He was carried to a nearby temple, where he was revived and treated for his injuries. Feeling ill, he nevertheless returned to Yangzhou. When asked by Yue Lang whether he would participate in the upcoming weeks of meditation, he politely declined, without revealing his illness. The temple had rules that those who were invited had to attend or else face punishment. In the end, Yue Lang had Xuyun beaten with a keisaku. He willingly accepted this punishment, although it worsened his condition.

For the next several days, Xuyun sat in continuous meditation. In his autobiography, he wrote: &quot;[in] the purity of my singleness of mind, I forgot all about my body. Twenty days later, my illness vanished completely. From that moment, with all my thoughts entirely wiped out, my practice took effect throughout the day and night. My steps were as swift as if I was flying in the air. One evening, after meditation, I opened my eyes and suddenly saw I was in brightness similar to broad daylight in which I could see everything inside and outside the monastery...&quot; But he knew that this occurrence was only a mental state, and that it was not at all rare. He did not become attached to this achievement, but continued his single-minded investigation of the question, &quot;who is mindful of the Buddha?&quot; He delved into this topic without interruption.

Xuyun composed a commemorative verse for the oft-cited moment of profound insight, which was galvanized by the sound of a breaking teacup in the Chan Hall:

==Later life==

Xuyun worked tirelessly as a bodhisattva, teaching precepts, explaining sutras, and restoring old temples. He worked throughout Asia, creating a following across Burma, Thailand, Malaya, and Vietnam, as well as Tibet and China. He remained in China during World War II. In the winter of 1942, Xuyun held a &quot;Protect the Nation, Quell the Disaster, Mahākaruṇā Dharma Assembly&quot; that lasted over three months in Chongqing, the capital of China at that time. He stayed after the rise of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) to support the Buddhist communities rather than retreat to the safety of Hong Kong or Taiwan.

In the spring of 1951, Xuyun and twenty-five monks were accused of hiding weapons and treasure. They were arrested and tortured in Yunmen Monastery () in Shaoguan, Guangdong province. Some of the monks were tortured to death or suffered broken bones. Xuyun endured several beatings during the interrogations, resulting in fractures to his rib cage. He closed his eyes and would not talk, eat, or drink, and stayed in the samādhi for nine days. During this time, his attendants Fayun and Kuanchun waited on him. Several of his works on scriptural commentary were also destroyed. Li Jishen, who was Vice President of the PRC at the time, informed and sought help from the then Premier of the PRC, Zhou Enlai, who put an end to the monks&#x27; detention after three months. This incident later became known as the &quot;Yunmen Incident.&quot;

In 1953, with Dharma Master Yuan Ying and others, Xuyun formed the Chinese Buddhist Association at Guangji (Extensive Aid) Monastery where he was Honorary President. The following resolutions were proposed to the government:
# In all places, further destruction of monasteries and temples, the desecration of images, and the burning of sutras shall immediately cease; 
# Forcing bhikshus and bhikshunis to leave their monastic orders will not be tolerated; and
# All monastery property shall be returned forthwith, and enough arable acreage should be returned to the Sangha so as to make the monasteries self-supporting.

The petition was approved. Xuyun then represented the Association in receiving three gifts from a Buddhist delegation from Sri Lanka. He also responded to the invitation of Dharma Master Nan Tong to head another Dharma assembly at Lang Shan Monastery, where several thousand people from all over took refuge in Triple Gems. He returned to Shanghai in the third lunar month, and the next month received a telegram from Beijing requesting his presence in the capital. After arriving, he stayed at Guangji Monastery. Representatives of various Buddhist groups also were present, and the Chinese Buddhist Association was officially inaugurated. After a plenary meeting in which important policies were decided, some monks suggested to him some changes to precepts and rules. Xuyun then scolded them and wrote an essay about the manifestation of the Dharma Ending Age.

==Death==
Xuyun became ill in the summer of 1959 and died on 13 October of the same year.

== Significance ==
In 1953, the Chinese Buddhist Association was established at a meeting with 121 delegates in Beijing. The meeting also elected a chairman, four honorary chairmen, seven vice-chairmen, a secretary general, three deputy secretaries-general, eighteen members of a standing committee, and ninety-three directors. The four elected honorary chairmen were the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama, the Grand Lama of Inner Mongolia, and Xuyun himself.

<doc id="1226882" wikidata="Q1166032" url="?curid=1226882" title="Dike Kokaral">
<text>Dike Kokaral is a 12 km long dam across a narrow stretch of the former Aral Sea, splitting off the North Aral Sea (also called &quot;The Small Sea&quot;) from the area that once contained the much larger South Aral Sea (&quot;The Large Sea&quot;). The dike is conserving the dwindling waters of the Syr Darya river and maintaining (and attempting to revive) the damaged ecology of the North Aral Sea, at the expense of sealing the fate of the larger South Aral. Work was completed in August 2005, with help from the World Bank. Dike Kokaral is named after the Kokaral peninsula (an island until the 1960s), which would connect it to the other shore of the Aral Sea and separate the northern from the southern seas.

==History==
As the waters of the contributory rivers to the Aral have been progressively redirected for irrigation, the water levels in the Aral have fallen, the shore receded, and the water quality has dropped precipitously.
The dike was built twice in the past from local sand, but due to a lack of funding necessary to strengthen it once the water level in the North Aral Sea (and therefore pressure to the dike) began to rise, the dike was washed away. This happened in 1992 and 1998. However, for the short time that the dike stood, positive changes were already noticed - the climate became milder, and fauna was partly restored. When the dike was washed away, the water level fell again, as much of the water poured into the South Aral Sea. In some places, the coastline of North Aral retreated by as much as a few hundred meters.

==North Aral&#x27;s sea level==

After the completion of Dike Kokaral, the water level of the North Aral has risen, and its salinity has decreased. By 2006, some recovery of the sea level was recorded, sooner than expected. &quot;The dam has caused the small Aral&#x27;s sea level to rise swiftly to 38m (125ft), from a low of less than 30m (98ft), with 42m (138ft) considered the level of viability.&quot; Economically significant stocks of fish have returned, and observers who had written off the North Aral Sea as an environmental catastrophe were surprised by reports that in 2006 its returning waters already were partly reviving the fishing industry and producing a catch for export as far as Ukraine. The restoration reportedly gave rise to long-absent rain clouds and possible microclimate changes, bringing tentative hope to an agricultural sector swallowed by a regional dustbowl, and some expansion of the shrunken sea. The sea, which had receded almost south of the port-city of Aralsk, was a mere away by 2015.

<text>Ngorongoro Conservation Area (, ) is a protected area and a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Ngorongoro District, west of Arusha City in Arusha Region, within the Crater Highlands geological area of northeastern Tanzania. The area is named after Ngorongoro Crater, a large volcanic caldera within the area. The Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority administers the conservation area, an arm of the Tanzanian government, and its boundaries follow the boundary of the Ngorongoro District in Arusha Region. The western portion of the park abuts the Serengeti National Park, and the area comprising the two parks and Kenya&#x27;s Maasai Mara game reserve is home to Great Migration, a massive annual migration of millions of wildebeest, zebras, gazelles, and other animals. The conservation area also contains Olduvai Gorge, one of the most important paleoanthropological sites in the world.

Ngorongoro Conservation is one of the most popular attractions in Tanzania with 752,232 tourists visiting it in 2023. 

The 2009 Ngorongoro Wildlife Conservation Act placed new restrictions on human settlement and subsistence farming in the Crater, displacing Maasai pastoralists, most of whom had been relocated to Ngorongoro from their ancestral lands to the north when the British colonial government established Serengeti National Park in 1959.

==History and geography==

The name of the crater has an onomatopoeic origin; it was named by the Maasai pastoralists after the sound produced by the cowbell (&quot;ngoro ngoro&quot;). Based on fossil evidence found at the Olduvai Gorge, various hominid species have occupied the area for 3 million years.

Hunter-gatherers were replaced by pastoralists a few thousand years ago. The Mbulu came to the area about 2,000 years ago and were joined by the Datooga around the year 1700. Both groups were driven from the area by the Maasai in the 1800s.

No Europeans are known to have set foot in the Ngorongoro Crater until 1892 when it was visited by Oscar Baumann. Two German brothers (Adolph and Friedrich Siedentopf) farmed in the crater until the outbreak of World War I, after leasing the land from the administration of German East Africa. The brothers regularly organized shooting parties to entertain their German friends. They also attempted to drive the wildebeest herds out of the crater.

In 1921, the first game preservation ordinance was passed, which restricted hunting to permit holders throughout Tanzania. In 1928, hunting was prohibited on all land within the crater rim, except the former Siedentopf farms. The National Park Ordinance of 1948 (implemented in 1951) created the Serengeti National Park (SNP). This, however, caused problems with the Maasai and other tribes, resulting in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Ordinance (1959) that separated the conservation area from the national park. Maasai pastoralists living in Serengeti National Park were systematically relocated to Ngorongoro, increasing the population of Maasai and livestock living in the Crater. The Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority was established by the Game Park Laws (miscellaneous amendments) Act, 1976, and owns the majority of Ngorongoro Conservation Area land, including the Crater. The area became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979, originally inscribed for its natural significance. It then received Mixed Heritage Status in 2010. Its cultural recognition stemming from &quot;an exceptionally long sequence of crucial evidence related to human evolution and human-environment dynamics…including physical evidence of the most important benchmarks in human evolutionary development&quot;. This recognition, however, has not included the Maasai community, hence the longstanding conflict surrounding the use and management of the park. The Wildlife Conservation Act of 2009 further restricted human use of Ngorongoro Crater and created a legal framework to politically disenfranchise and forcibly displace traditional pastoralists. The restriction on land use generates tension between the local Maasai communities and conservation authorities. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is seeking solutions to ease conflict and improve collaborative efforts toward conservation with the locals.

The conservation area land is multi-use and unique because it is the only conservation area in Tanzania that protects wildlife while allowing human habitation. Land use is controlled to prevent negative effects on the wildlife population. For example, cultivation is prohibited at all but subsistence levels.

The area is part of the Serengeti ecosystem and, to the northwest, adjoins the SNP and is contiguous with the southern Serengeti plains. These plains also extend to the north into the unprotected Loliondo division and are kept open to wildlife through transhumance pastoralism practiced by the Maasai. The south and west of the area are volcanic highlands, including the famous Ngorongoro Crater and the lesser-known Empakaai Crater. The southern and eastern boundaries are approximately defined by the rim of the East African Rift wall, which also prevents animal migration in these directions.

==Geology==
The Pliocene Ngorongoro volcanic group consists of eight extinct shield volcanoes within the Eyasi half-graben, the eastern boundary marked by the Gregory Rift Western Escarpment. The Lake Eyasi escarpment bounds the half-graben on the southwest. Within the complex, five volcanoes are dome-shaped cones, while three have calderas. Ngorongoro Volcano (2.5–1.9 Ma) is primarily basaltic trachyandesite. The caldera is fed by the Munge and Oljoro Nyuki Rivers, while the Ngoitokitok hot springs feed into the Goringop swamp. Lake Magadi is a shallow (1.7 m) alkaline lake. Other volcanoes within the complex include Olmoti (2.01–1.79 Ma), Empakaai, Loolmalasin, Sadiman (3.7 Ma), Lemagrut, and Oldeani. The northwest portion of the conservation area consists of the Serengeti Plains, the Salei Plains, the Oldupai Gorge, and the Gol Mountains inselbergs. These inselbergs are part of the Mozambique Belt quartzite and mica schist about (800–500 Ma) in age.
==Ngorongoro Crater==

The main feature of the Ngorongoro Conservation Authority is the Ngorongoro Crater, the world&#x27;s largest inactive, intact and unfilled volcanic caldera. The crater, which formed when a large volcano erupted and collapsed on itself two to three million years ago, is deep and its floor covers . Estimates of the height of the original volcano range from high. The crater floor is above sea level. The crater was voted by Seven Natural Wonders as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa in Arusha, Tanzania, in February 2013. The Ngorongoro volcano was active from about 2.45 to 2 million years ago. Volcanic eruptions like that of Ngorongoro, which resulted in the formation of Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania, were very common. Similar collapses occurred in the case of Olmoti and Empakaai, but they were much smaller in magnitude and impact.

Out of the two recent volcanoes to the northeast of the Empakaai caldera, Kerimasi and Ol Doinyo Lengai, Doinyo Lengai is still active and had major eruptions in 2007 and 2008. Smaller ash eruptions and lava flows continue to slowly fill the current crater. Its name in Maasai means &#x27;Mountain of God&#x27;.
The Munge Stream drains Olmoti Crater to the north and is the main water source draining into the seasonal salt lake in the center of the crater. This lake is known by two names: &quot;Makat&quot; as the Maasai called it, meaning salt; and &quot;Magadi&quot;. The Lerai Stream drains the humid forests to the south of the Crater and feeds the Lerai Forest on the crater floor – when there is enough rain, the Lerai drains into Lake Magadi as well. Extraction of water by lodges and Ngorongoro Conservation Area headquarters reduces the amount of water entering Lerai by around 25%.

The other major water source in the crater is the Ngoitokitok Spring, near the eastern crater wall. There is a picnic site here open to tourists and a huge swamp fed by the spring, and the area is inhabited by hippopotamuses, elephants, lions, and many others. Many other small springs can be found around the crater&#x27;s floor, and these are important water supplies for the animals and local Maasai, especially during times of drought. Maasai were previously permitted to graze their cattle within the crater, but as of 2015 were restricted from doing so.
==Oldupai or Olduvai Gorge==

The Ngorongoro Conservation Area also protects Oldupai or Olduvai Gorges, situated in the plains area. It is considered to be the seat of humanity after the discovery of the earliest known specimens of the human genus, &quot;Homo habilis &quot; as well as early hominidae, such as &quot;Paranthropus boisei&quot;.

The Olduvai Gorge is a steep-sided ravine in the Great Rift Valley, which stretches along eastern Africa. Olduvai is in the eastern Serengeti Plains in northeastern Tanzania and is about long. It lies in the rain shadow of the Ngorongoro highlands and is the driest part of the region. The gorge is named after &#x27;Oldupaai&#x27;, the Maasai word for the wild sisal plant, &quot;Sansevieria ehrenbergii&quot;.

It is one of the most important prehistoric sites in the world and research there has been instrumental in furthering understanding of early human evolution. Excavation work there was pioneered by Mary and Louis Leakey in the 1950s and is continued today by their family. Some believe that millions of years ago, the site was that of a large lake, the shores of which were covered with successive deposits of volcanic ash. Around 500,000 years ago seismic activity diverted a nearby stream which began to cut down into the sediments, revealing seven main layers in the walls of the gorge.

==Wildlife==

Approximately 25,000 large animals, mostly ungulates, live in the crater.
Large mammals in the crater include the black rhinoceros (&quot;Diceros bicornis michaeli&quot;), the local population of which declined from about 108 in 1964–66 to 13 in 1993. Following the monitoring and protection initiatives of the Frankfurt Zoological Society, International Rhino Foundation and World Wildlife Fund, the current total of 55 animals as of 2018 is 55. 

Large mammals in the crater also include African buffalo or Cape buffalo (&quot;Syncerus caffer&quot;), and the hippopotamus (&quot;Hippopotamus amphibius&quot;). There also are many other ungulates: the blue wildebeest (&quot;Connochaetes taurinus&quot;) (7,000 estimated in 1994), Grant&#x27;s zebra (&quot;Equus quagga boehmi&quot;) (4,000), the eland (&quot;Taurotragus oryx&quot;), and Grant&#x27;s (&quot;Nanger granti&quot;) and Thomson&#x27;s gazelles (&quot;Eudorcas thomsonii&quot;) (3,000). Waterbucks (&quot;Kobus ellipsiprymnus&quot;) occur mainly near Lerai Forest.

Absent are Giraffe, impala (&quot;Aepyceros melampus&quot;), topi (&quot;Damaliscus lunatus&quot;), oribi (&quot;Ourebia oribi&quot;), and crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus niloticus&quot;).

Cheetah (&quot;Acinonyx jubatus raineyi&quot;), East African wild dog (&quot;Lycaon pictus lupinus&quot;), and African leopard (&quot;Panthera pardus pardus&quot;) are rarely seen. Spotted hyenas (&quot;Crocuta crocuta&quot;) have been the subject of a long-term research study in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area since 1996.

Although thought of as &quot;a natural enclosure&quot; for a very wide variety of wildlife, 20 percent or more of the wildebeest and half the zebra populations vacate the crater in the wet season, while Cape buffalo (&quot;Syncerus caffer&quot;) stay; their highest numbers are during the rainy season.

Since 1986, the crater&#x27;s wildebeest population has fallen from 14,677 to 7,250 (2003–2005). The numbers of eland and Thomson&#x27;s gazelle also have declined while the buffalo population has increased greatly, probably due to the long prevention of fire which favors high-fibrous grasses over shorter, less fibrous types.

Serval (&quot;Leptailurus serval&quot;) occurs widely in the crater.

Lake Magadi, a large lake in the southwest of the crater, is often inhabited by thousands of mainly lesser flamingoes.

The crater has one endemic species of mammal: Mduma&#x27;s shrew (&quot;Crocidura mdumai&quot;), which is restricted to montane forests on the edge of the crater. This shrew is considered endangered due to deforestation from smallholder farming.

=== Lions ===

The crater has one of the densest known population of lions, numbering 62 in 2001.

A side effect of the crater being a natural enclosure is that the lion population is significantly inbred. This is due to the very small amount of new bloodlines that enter the local gene pool, as very few migrating male lions enter the crater from the outside. Those who do enter the crater are often prevented from contributing to the gene pool by the crater&#x27;s male lions, who expel any outside competitors.

Long-term data imply that lions in the crater were struck by four deadly disease outbreaks between 1962 and 2002. Drought in 1961 and rains throughout the 1962 dry season caused a massive build-up of blood-sucking stable flies (&quot;Stomoxys calcitrans&quot;) by May 1962. They drained blood and caused painful skin sores that became infected, causing lion numbers to crash from 75–100 to 12. The population recovered to around 100 by 1975 and remained stable until 1983 when a persistent decline began. Numbers have generally remained below 60 animals since 1993, reaching a low of 29 in 1998. In 2001, 34 percent of the lion population died between January and April from a combination of tick-borne disease and canine distemper.

The lion population is also influenced to some extent by the takeover of prides by incoming males, which typically kill small cubs. The biggest influence, however, appears to be disease, particularly canine distemper.

==Outside Ngorongoro Crater==
The Ngorongoro Conservation Area has a healthy resident population of most species of wildlife, and Masai people. The Ndutu Lake area to the west of the conservation area has particularly strong cheetah and lion populations. Common in the area are hartebeest (&quot;Alcelaphus buselaphus&quot;), spotted hyena (&quot;Crocuta crocuta&quot;), and jackals. The population of African wild dog may have declined recently. Servals occur widely on the plains to the west of the Ngorongoro Crater.

The annual ungulate migration passes through the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, with 1.7 million wildebeest, 260,000 zebra, and 470,000 gazelles moving into the area in December and moving out in June. This movement changes seasonally with the rains, but the migration traverses almost the entire plains in search of food.

==Threats to the Conservation Area==
High demands for natural resources and modernity from an increasing resident human population, as well as the need to promote and manage tourism, are the most pressing current concerns. The estimated 93,000 pastoralists who live within NCA today are nearly five times the number that were there when the property was listed (1979). Emerging dwellings and settlements have apparent ramifications. Despite the fact that small-scale agriculture is currently illegal, communities are increasingly requesting the resumption of subsistence crop farming to attain food self-sufficiency, escalating tensions between residents and conservation organizations. Furthermore, approximately 300,000 domestic animals live with wildlife on NCA property.

The area&#x27;s resident pastoralist community has gradually increased from approximately 8,700 in 1966 to 20,000 at the date of World Heritage status (1979) to 93,136 in 2017. By 2027, the population is predicted to reach 161,000 people. The repercussions of this population growth include increased infrastructure, grazing areas, human-wildlife confrontations, and land use conflicts.

The scenic values of the place are being conserved. However, it is clear that houses and other infrastructure associated with the growing pastoralist population may have a negative impact on the values. Traditional building materials and techniques (based on locally available natural materials) are gradually giving way to the use of imported materials (e.g., cement and corrugated iron) and the unsustainable usage of heavy poles from local forests. Although the NCAA has devised a set of &quot;building codes&quot; to guide such developments, the outcomes of code implementation are unknown. Lodge and tented camp developments are frequently well-located, disguised, and appropriately constructed, whereas pastoralist habitation is uncontrolled. Moving vehicle dust plumes have a minor impact on scenic qualities in the near term. Uncontrolled dwelling unit construction on the property would damage the site&#x27;s integrity. The construction of structures must be regularly supervised and regulated.

Human-animal conflict occurs whenever livestock is lost to predatory animals and/or depredated by wildlife inside or near a conservation area. The Maasai have a long tradition of coexisting with wildlife and have developed a high tolerance for it. Poverty, food insecurity, increasing human population in the landscape, and limiting resources, on the other hand, are bringing cow and animal interactions closer together, as well as intensifying competition and conflict.

Historically, the traditional Maasai culture has posed challenges for individuals seeking to assume complex managerial roles within their communities. Until recently, there was resistance among the Maasai towards embracing education as a necessity. It was only shortly before 2000 that attitudes have shifted, with the realization that to influence the ongoing changes affecting their community, they must engage with external influences rather than remain isolated. For example, one senior traditional leader remarked that he sincerely regretted running away from school as a child, and he has almost certainly passed this attitude on to the younger members of his community. As a result, traditionally, the NCAA faced a significant issue in encouraging Maasai villages to use any schools they established. This alone will have dampened the NCAA&#x27;s enthusiasm for school-building initiatives.

<doc id="1226892" wikidata="Q16481835" url="?curid=1226892" title="Iberian scripts">
<text>The Iberian scripts are the Paleohispanic scripts that were used to represent the extinct Iberian language. Most of them are typologically unusual in that they are semi-syllabic rather than purely alphabetic. The oldest Iberian inscriptions date to the 4th or possibly the 5th century BCE, and the latest from end of the 1st century BCE or possibly the beginning of the 1st century CE.

==Variants==
There are two main graphic as well as geographic variants in the family:
* Northeastern Iberian script
** Dual variant (4th century BCE and 3rd century BCE) (tentative)
** Non-dual variant (2nd century BCE and 1st century BCE)
* Southeastern Iberian script

In the sense that the Iberian scripts are the scripts created for the Iberians to represent the Iberian language, the Greco-Iberian alphabet, a separate adaptation of the Greek alphabet, was also an Iberian script. It was used mainly in Alicante and Murcia. Likewise, neither the southwestern script, very similar to southeastern Iberian script but used for the Tartessian language, nor the Celtiberian script, a direct adaptation of the northeastern Iberian script used for the Celtiberian language, are technically Iberian scripts.

The northeastern Iberian script is often known simply as the Iberian script, because it is the script of 95% of known Iberian inscriptions. These have been found mainly in the northeastern quadrant of the Iberian Peninsula, mostly along the coast from Languedoc-Roussillon to Alicante, but with a deep penetration on the Ebro valley.

The southeastern Iberian script is poorly attested, and there are some gaps in the records: There are no positively identified symbols for /gu/, /do/, and /m/, for example. Unlike the northeastern Iberian script the decipherment of the southeastern Iberian script is not still closed, because there are a significant group of signs without consensus value. The southeastern inscriptions have been found mainly in the southeastern quadrant of Iberia: Eastern Andalusia, Murcia, Albacete, Alicante, and Valencia.

There is substantial graphic variation in the Iberian glyphs, and over the past several decades many scholars have come to believe that, at least in northeastern Iberian script (and recently also in Celtiberian script) some of this variation is meaningful. It appears that the original simple letters were assigned specifically to the voiced consonants /b/, /d/, /g/, whereas the voiceless consonants /t/ and /k/ were derived from /d/ and /g/ syllables with the addition of a stroke. (This is the so-called &quot;dual signary&quot; model: see the image at right). If correct, this innovation would parallel the creation of the Latin letter G from C by the addition of a stroke.

==Typology==
Excepting the Greco-Iberian alphabet, the Iberian scripts are typologically unusual, in that they were partially alphabetic and partially syllabic: Continuants (fricative sounds like /s/ and sonorants like /l/, /m/, and vowels) were written with distinct letters, as in Phoenician (or in Greek in the case of the vowels), but the non-continuants (the stops /b/, /d/, /t/, /g/, and /k/) were written with &quot;syllabic&quot; glyphs that represented both consonant and vowel together, as with Japanese kana. That is, in written Iberian, &quot;ga&quot; displayed no resemblance to &quot;ge,&quot; and &quot;bi&quot; had no connection to &quot;bo.&quot; This possibly unique writing system is called a &quot;semi-syllabary&quot;.

The southeastern script was written right to left, as was the Phoenician alphabet, whereas the northeastern script reversed this to left to right, as in the Greek alphabet.

==Origins==

The Iberian scripts are classified as Paleohispanic scripts for convenience and based on broad similarities, but their relationships to each other and to neighboring contemporaneous scripts, such as Greco-Iberian, are not firmly established. It is generally accepted that they were derived at least partly from the Greek alphabet and/or Phoenician alphabet, with which they share many similar-looking glyphs. Some researchers conclude that the origin of the northern and southern Iberian scripts ultimately lies solely with the Phoenician alphabet; others believe the Greek alphabet also played a role; others still have suggested influences from Old Italic. It appears that either the glyphs themselves were changed, or that they assumed new values. For example, the southern glyph for /e/ derives from Phoenician &quot;‘ayin&quot; or Greek Ο, whereas northern /e/ resembles Phoenician &quot;he&quot; or Greek Ε, though the letter arguably had the value of /be/ in southern Iberian. However, it is clear that they had a common origin, and the most commonly accepted hypothesis is that the northeastern script derives from the southeastern script.

<text>Scott Hastings Beckett (October 4, 1929 – May 10, 1968) was an American actor. He began his career as a child actor in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; shorts and later costarred on &quot;Rocky Jones, Space Ranger&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Born in Oakland, California, Beckett got his start in show business at age three when the family moved to Los Angeles and a casting director heard him singing by chance. He was at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital visiting his father, who was recovering from an illness. A studio casting director noticed the child and told his parents he had movie potential. He auditioned, and landed a part in &quot;Gallant Lady&quot; (1933), alongside Dickie Moore. The same year, his father died. In 1934, he joined &quot;Our Gang&quot;, in which Moore had appeared from 1932 to 1933.

===&quot;Our Gang&quot;===

Beckett appeared as a regular in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short subjects series from 1934 to 1935. In it, he played George &quot;Spanky&quot; McFarland&#x27;s best friend and partner in mischief. His trademark look was a crooked baseball cap and an oversized sweater exposing one shoulder. His role was taken over by Carl &quot;Alfalfa&quot; Switzer in 1935, and he left the series for features in 1936. In 1939, he returned briefly as Alfalfa&#x27;s cousin, Wilbur, in &quot;Cousin Wilbur&quot; and &quot;Dog Daze&quot;.

==Career after &quot;Our Gang&quot;==
After his &quot;Our Gang&quot; tenure ended, Beckett won increasingly prominent roles in major Hollywood films, usually playing the star&#x27;s son or the hero as a boy. Among his major credits are &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot; with Spencer Tracy, &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot; with Fredric March, &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; with Errol Flynn, &quot;Conquest&quot; with Greta Garbo, &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; with Norma Shearer; &quot;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves&quot;, in which he played Jon Hall&#x27;s character as a child, and &quot;Kings Row&quot;, in which he played Robert Cummings&#x27;s character as a child. In 1940, he played Tim in &quot;My Favorite Wife&quot;, starring Cary Grant and Irene Dunne. He appeared as one of the unborn children in Shirley Temple&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Bird&quot; (1940). He also had a central role in the wartime propaganda film &quot;The Boy from Stalingrad&quot; (1943).

Beckett attended Los Angeles High School and took time off from filming to try his luck on the stage. Adolescence did not hamper his career, as he won important roles as that of young Al Jolson in &quot;The Jolson Story&quot;, with his singing voice provided by Rudy Wissler, and Junior in the radio show &quot;The Life of Riley&quot;. His performance as Jolson was described as &quot;touching, enchanting, and to all indications, accurate&quot;. In 1947, he appeared alongside former &quot;Our Gang&quot; member Dickie Moore and Marilyn Monroe in &quot;Dangerous Years&quot;.

Beckett was signed by MGM in 1947, with his first role under contract as Will Parker in &quot;Cynthia&quot;. He gained the role of Oogie Pringle in &quot;A Date with Judy&quot;, the film adaptation of the radio series of the same name, opposite Jane Powell as Judy Foster. In 1949, he was featured in the war drama &quot;Battleground&quot; and the following year he starred as the fast-talking Tennessee Shad in the comedy &quot;The Happy Years&quot;. By 1950, the success of those three films resulted in expectations that his career would rise. Unfortunately, while other actors his age moved into leading roles, his career declined, as evidenced by his small role in &quot;Nancy Goes to Rio&quot;, again with Powell.

Beckett attended the University of Southern California, but dropped out when the combined workload of school and films became too great. Although he was working steadily at MGM, his life grew increasingly tumultuous in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1948, he was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving.

In 1954, Beckett&#x27;s career took an upward turn when he was cast as Winky, the comic sidekick in the popular TV show &quot;Rocky Jones, Space Ranger&quot;. However, he was fired from the series after being arrested on a concealed weapons charge and for passing a bad check. According to actor Jimmy Lydon, who appeared with him in the &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; films and also replaced him after he was fired from &quot;Rocky Jones&quot;, he earned a bad reputation due to his excessive drinking. Lydon also claimed that he made many enemies because he gambled frequently but refused to pay his gambling debts or repay money that was lent to him. After being fired from &quot;Rocky Jones&quot;, he made only a few subsequent TV and film appearances, some uncredited bit parts, before leaving show business forever.

==Post-acting life==
After leaving the entertainment industry, Beckett sold real estate, cars, and twice enrolled at universities with the intention of becoming a physician. He was also arrested several times for drunkenness, drunk driving, drug possession, and passing bad checks. His first arrest for drunk driving came in 1948, followed by a second arrest in March 1959. In February 1957, he was arrested after attempting to cross the Mexican border with 250 &quot;stimulant pills.&quot; On August 14, 1959, he was arrested for possessing four Benzedrine pills. He was released after twelve hours after the county prosecutor refused to press charges. Four days later, at age 29, he sustained a broken hip and skull fracture after crashing his car into a tree while driving in West Los Angeles. Lydon claimed that the accident left Beckett severely disabled and he had to utilize a wheelchair and crutches for the remainder of his life. In 1962, he attempted suicide after a heavy drinking binge.

==Personal life==
Beckett was married three times and had one child. He married professional tennis player Beverly Baker on September 28, 1949, in Las Vegas. She was granted a divorce in June 1950. His second marriage was to model and actress Sunny Vickers. They married in 1951 and had one son, Scott Jr., before divorcing in 1957. In 1961, he married Margaret C. Sabo; she remained with him until his death.

==Death==
On May 8, 1968, Beckett checked into a Los Angeles nursing home to seek medical attention after suffering a serious beating (the circumstances surrounding it were never made clear). He was found dead in his room on May 10. He was 38 years old. A note and pills were found, but the Los Angeles County coroner stated that an exact cause of death was unknown even though an autopsy had been performed. While no official cause of death has been listed, various media reports state that he overdosed on either barbiturates or alcohol.

Beckett is buried at San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Mission Hills, Los Angeles.

<doc id="1226897" wikidata="Q7109129" url="?curid=1226897" title="Ottawa-Carleton District School Board">
<text>The Ottawa-Carleton District School Board (OCDSB, known as English-language Public District School Board No. 25 prior to 1999) refers to both the institution responsible for the operation of all English public schools in the city of Ottawa, Ontario and its governing body. Like most school boards, the OCDSB is administered by a group of elected trustees and one director selected and appointed by the Board itself. Additionally, annually, two student trustees are selected per provincial regulation.

Every four years, within the context of the Ottawa municipal elections, an election is held within each of Ottawa&#x27;s twelve trustee electoral zones to elect each trustee. Following election and annually thereafter, the board of trustees holds its organizational meeting, where the Board membership elects two of its members to the positions of chair and vice-chair of the Board. Chairs and membership of each of the Board&#x27;s committees are also determined as part of the organizational meeting. In addition to the twelve trustees, two student trustees are elected by their peers, providing opportunities for the student body to become informed and involved in Board governance.

== History ==
The Ottawa-Carleton District School Board was created on 2 January 1998 in accordance with Ontario provincial government legislation including merging of the former adjacent Carleton Board of Education and the Ottawa Board of Education. The headquarters of the amalgamated school district is located at the former headquarters of the Carleton Board of Education at 133 Greenbank Road, Nepean.

Historically, and to this day, the OCDSB is one of the very few school boards in Ontario with an advisory council on the arts providing input and annual reports to the board of trustees.

In 2009–2010 the OCDSB tried to shut down the Alternative program. A group of students and parents from Lady Evelyn Alt teamed up with a trustee and won the Review.

In 2017 a family was awarded approximately $3,000 after winning a lawsuit against the OCDSB over the board&#x27;s failure to take a student&#x27;s complaints about bullying seriously.

In 2018 two former students filed lawsuits against the OCDSB for failing its &quot;legal duty to provide for the safety of its students&quot;.

In 2019 an investigation was launched to look into what ultimately resulted in three sex offense charges against OCDSB teacher Majed Turk in July 2020. The alleged incidents occurred between September and November 2019.

As of 2020, there were ongoing lawsuits filed against the OCDSB for the sexual abuse of its students by now deceased teacher and Bell High School basketball coach, Donald Greenham.

In 2023 a disciplinary panel with the Ontario College of Teachers found former OCDSB teacher Peter Des Brisay guilty of professional misconduct after sexually abusing a former student in the late 1990s.

==Schools and programs==
The OCDSB has 147 school sites (117 elementary, 25 secondary including the Adult High School, plus five secondary alternate sites). Schools within the OCDSB provide English with Core French, Alternative, Early French Immersion, Middle French Immersion, Late French Immersion, Special Education, IEP&#x27;s and gifted program.

==Finances==
The OCDSB has an operating budget of $784.8 million for the 2010–2011 school year. In 2007, the school busses belonging to the OCDSB and the co-terminus catholic school board were taken over by a new corporation: The Ottawa Student Transportation Authority (See external link, below)

==Demographics==
The Ottawa-Carleton District School Board is the largest school board in Eastern Ontario, serving students within the City of Ottawa, covering an area of . The OCDSB is the seventh largest district by school population in the province of Ontario. Enrolment as of 31 October 2007 totalled 72,388 students (47,099 elementary and 25,455 secondary).

The District has 2,711 full-time equivalent (FTE) elementary teachers and 1,337 secondary teachers, as of 31 October 2007, with 238 principals and vice-principals. In addition to the full-time teachers, approximately 2,494 teachers are on the district&#x27;s occasional teachers list. The OCDSB also has 2,059 administrative and support staff of whom 1,817 work in the schools.

The chair of the OCDSB is Lyra Evans.

<text>Eye in the Sky is the sixth studio album by British rock band the Alan Parsons Project, released in May 1982 by Arista Records. At the 25th Annual Grammy Awards in 1983, &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album. In 2019, the album won the Grammy Award for Best Immersive Audio Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.

==Production==
&quot;Eye in the Sky&quot; is the first of three albums the Project recorded on analogue equipment and mixed directly to the digital master tape.

==Release==
&quot;Eye in the Sky&quot; was the last platinum record in the United States from the band.

&quot;Eye in the Sky&quot; contains the title track, the Alan Parsons Project&#x27;s biggest hit, with lead vocals by Eric Woolfson. The album itself was a major success, reaching the top 10 (and sometimes the number one slot) in numerous countries.

The album features the instrumental piece &quot;Sirius&quot;, which has become a staple of many college and professional sporting arenas throughout North America. It is best known for its use by the Chicago Bulls to introduce its starting line-up during its championship years of the 1990s and is still used today.

Another instrumental, &quot;Mammagamma&quot;, was used separately by TVNZ in New Zealand and BBC Wales in the mid-1980s for their snooker coverage, and as a bed for the &quot;My Favourite Five&quot; feature on Tony Fenton&#x27;s late-night 2FM show in Ireland across 1989 and 1990. The instrumental also saw use in an industrial video for Iveco in Italy.

On 1 December 2017, a 35th-anniversary-edition box set of the album was released, for which Alan Parsons, along with surround mastering engineers Dave Donnelly and PJ Olsson, won the Grammy Award for Best Immersive Audio Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.

==Reception==
From contemporary reviews, Ken Tucker of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; gave the album a one star rating out of five rating, calling it a &quot;hopelessly banal album&quot; with &quot;Paul McCartney-as-manic-depressive melodies and whining vocals would be merely pathetic were it not for Parsons&#x27; lyric pretensions&quot;.

From retrospective reviews, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated that &quot;this is a soft rock album through and through, one that&#x27;s about melodic hooks and texture,&quot; noting that &quot;with the exception of those instrumentals and the galloping suite &quot;Silence and I,&quot; all the artiness was part of the idea of this album was pushed into the lyrics, so the album plays as soft pop album—and a very, very good one at that [...] it adds up to arguably the most consistent Alan Parsons Project album—perhaps not in terms of concept, but in terms of music they never were as satisfying as they were here.&quot;

<text>John H. Davis (April 5, 1914 – November 3, 1992) was an American child actor, notable for appearing in Hal Roach&#x27;s &quot;Our Gang&quot; series. His sister Mildred Davis also acted; she appeared in Roach comedian Harold Lloyd&#x27;s films as his leading lady. When Lloyd and Mildred were married in 1923, Lloyd pulled Jack out of &quot;Our Gang&quot; and enrolled him in military school.

==Career==

Davis first appeared in the fourth &quot;Our Gang&quot; short, &quot;Young Sherlocks&quot;. He was known as the little tough boy and was a rival (usually with Mickey) for Mary Kornman&#x27;s affections. In other shorts he was a just a member of the gang instead of a bully. His screen career ended after 19 shorts in the series when Harold Lloyd and his older sister, Mildred Davis, got married, and Lloyd put the boy into military school. His final appearance was the 1923 short &quot;Derby Day&quot;. After degrees in anthropology and medicine Davis became a successful physician in the Los Angeles area, specialising in cardiology, and associate professor at the UCLA School of Medicine. He was the grandfather of American actress Carrie Mitchum and actor Bentley Mitchum.

==Death==
Davis died in 1992 in Santa Monica, California of respiratory failure at the age of 78.

<doc id="1226906" wikidata="Q6093538" url="?curid=1226906" title="Italic script">
<text>Italic script, also known as chancery cursive and Italic hand, is a semi-cursive, slightly sloped style of handwriting and calligraphy that was developed during the Renaissance in Italy. It is one of the most popular styles used in contemporary Western calligraphy.

==History==
Italic script is based largely on Humanist minuscule, which itself draws on Carolingian minuscule. The capital letters are the same as the Humanist capitals, modeled on Roman square capitals. The Italian scholar Niccolò de&#x27; Niccoli was dissatisfied with the lowercase forms of Humanist minuscule, finding it too slow to write. In response, he created the Italic script, which incorporates features and techniques characteristic of a quickly written hand: oblique forms, fewer strokes per character, and the joining of letters. Perhaps the most significant change to any single character was to the form of the &quot;a&quot;, which he simplified from the two-story form to the one-story form ⟨ɑ⟩ now common to most handwriting styles.

Under the influence of Italic movable type used with printing presses, the style of handwritten Italic script moved toward disjoined, more mannered characters. By the 1550s the Italic script had become so laborious that it fell out of use with scribes.

The style became increasingly influenced by the development of Copperplate writing styles in the eighteenth century. The style of Italic script used today is often heavily influenced by developments made as late as the early 20th century. In the past few decades, the italic script has been promoted in English-speaking countries as an easier-to-learn alternative to traditional styles of cursive handwriting.

In the UK this revival was due in part to the 19th-century artist William Morris. In 1905 Monica Bridges’ book, &quot;A New Handwriting for Teachers&quot; was published. She was a skilled calligrapher and this book is credited with making italic handwriting fashionable in British schools.

Edward Johnston&#x27;s book &quot;Writing &amp; Illumination &amp; Lettering&quot; was published in 1906, Alfred Fairbank&#x27;s book &quot;A Handwriting Manual&quot; in 1932 and the &quot;Dryad Writing Cards&quot; in 1935. These Dryad cards were used for teaching young school children to write an italic hand.

Italics script is considered one of the best examples of Latin cursive writing, and had a great influence on the calligraphic styles that followed throughout Europe. It was developed at a time when the spread of printing technology had already decreed the fall into disuse of manuscript books, consequently shifting the calligraphic attention from the books to the production of single papers and documents, for which handwriting remained an irreplaceable tool. For these needs, it was necessary to write faster than how humanistic script originally allowed, yet just as elegantly, hence the birth of the Italic script with a thinner and slightly inclined style that made it adaptable to more rapid execution. This period also gave birth to the first treatises on calligraphy: among them stands out &quot;La Operina&quot; by Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi (c.1475-c.1527).

A modern version called Getty-Dubay Italic was introduced in 1976.

<doc id="1226918" wikidata="Q2207682" url="?curid=1226918" title="SR Class 4DD">
<text>The SR Class 4DD was an experimental double-decker electric multiple unit built in 1949 and operated by the Southern Railway until 1971. Conceived by Oliver Bulleid for the Southern Railway&#x27;s commuter line from London Charing Cross to Dartford, the two trains were the only double-decker trains to be used on the mainline railway network in Britain. Whilst commonly used in continental Europe and North America, the restrictive railway loading gauge in the United Kingdom prohibits normal double-decker trains with two fully separated decks.

==History==
The 4DD was more split-level than truly double-deck because the compartments were alternately high and low to ensure that the overall height of the train was exactly within the clearances necessary to safely pass through tunnels and under bridges. A mock-up was displayed at London Marylebone in 1949 shortly before it was first introduced into service, but an assessment after one year in service revealed that the design would not be the optimum solution to the problems of overcrowding, nor would it help increase capacity, and the decision was made to extend trains from eight coaches to ten coaches by using regular, single-decker multiple units.

The intention to carry more passengers in a train of the same length as other contemporary stock was met, with the two 4-DD units having 1,104 seats compared to 800 in other units of similar age. However it was found that the additional number of passengers meant longer time spent at stations to allow passengers to get on and off. In practice, the upper compartments were cramped and poorly ventilated because the upper-level windows were impossible to open due to tight clearance. To resolve this problem, the compartments were pressure-ventilated, but the equipment proved to be unreliable.

Near the end, they were renumbered 4901 and 4902. 4001 and 4002 were reassigned to another pair of prototype Southern Region four-coach EMUs, the 4-PEPs.

Unusually for an &quot;experiment&quot; they lasted in traffic from 1949 to 1971, undergoing routine maintenance and repaints with no hiccups in their life. The two units were finally withdrawn on 1 October 1971 having travelled approximately 700,000 miles in service.

==Formations==


==Preservation==
Driving motor cars 13003 and 13004 survive, the former at Kent Locomotives Ltd - Sellindge, Kent, and the latter at the Northamptonshire Ironstone Railway Trust. 13004 was moved to Kent by the Bulleid 4DD group to join 13003 in May 2023. One trailer was also preserved, but it was scrapped when Ashford Steam Centre closed in 1984, in lieu of rent owed. Driving motor cars 13003 and 13004 are now (May 2023) both in the care of Bulleid 4-DD Group, which plans to restore them.

<text>Peter John Hartley (born 18 April 1960) is an English first-class cricketer and umpire.

==Playing career==
Born 18 April 1960, in Keighley West Riding of Yorkshire, Hartley made his debut for Warwickshire in 1982. A right-arm medium fast bowler, he moved to Yorkshire in 1985, and stayed there until 1997, when he relocated to Hampshire. When he retired at the end of the 2000 season, Hartley was Hampshire&#x27;s opening bowler.

He made his highest first-class score for Yorkshire in a Roses match in 1988, making 127 not out out of a total of 224, while batting at no. 8 and coming to the wicket with his team at 37 for 6. Another highlight of his playing career was playing in the final when Yorkshire won the 1987 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup, a rare triumph for the county in these years.

Hartley represented the England team in a Masters tournament in Sharjah in 1996.

==Umpiring career==
After retiring as a player, Hartley became an umpire, making his first-class umpiring debut in 2003. Between 2006 and 2009 he officiated in international cricket, taking charge of six one day international matches and three Twenty20 international matches. He continues to stand in List A and first-class cricket matches.

As of 2021, he remains a member of the England and Wales Cricket Board&#x27;s umpire list.

<doc id="1226923" wikidata="Q61910" url="?curid=1226923" title="Adolf Brudes">
<text>Adolf Brudes von Breslau (15 October 1899 – 5 November 1986) was a Formula One driver from Germany and a member of German nobility. He started racing motorcycles in 1919. As an owner of a BMW and Auto Union dealership in Breslau, he had the opportunities to go racing, which he did from 1928 onwards, initially in hillclimbs. After World War II wiped out his business, he moved to Berlin and for a while became a mechanic, wherever he could find jobs. However he soon was back racing, and he continued until 1968, in hillclimbs (a career of 49 years). He participated in one World Championship Grand Prix, the 1952 Großer Preis von Deutschland, but scored no championship points. He also participated in several non-Championship Formula One races.

==Pre-war career==

Adolf was born in Kotulin, near Breslau. Today, Breslau is known as Wrocław, and is in Poland. Back in 1899, it was part of the German Reich.

He began his racing career on two wheels as early as 1919. Between 1924 and 1927, he was the master mechanic and works rider for motorcycle manufacturer Victoria. In 1925, the company added a Root blower to their 2-cylinder ohv 597cc flat engine. A year later, Brudes set a Land Speed Record of 102½ mph (165 km/h), riding one of these bikes.

Adolf wished to race at a higher level, and with that in mind, he started racing cars alongside the bikes in 1928. He purchased a Bugatti Type 37A with which he went hillclimbing mostly in Poland, taking a number of overall and class victories. Meanwhile, he established a BMW and Auto Union dealership in Breslau. By 1934, he had added a Bugatti Type 35B and a MG C-type to his stable, and it was with the MG, he scored a class victory in the 1934 Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring.

1936 saw Adolf take part on an Auto Union driver evaluation test, but the driver when to another driver. Not to be put off by this set back, he acquired a BMW 328. After some excellent results, he earns himself place in their works squad of the 1938 Spa 24 Hours race. Partnered by Paul Heinemann, the finish fourth overall, second in class. Also would also go on to record a podium finish in the 1940 Mille Miglia. The race ran over a shortened course, under the title of Gran Premio Bescia delle Mille Miglia. Brudes was paired with Ralph Röese in a BMW 328 spider, finished third.

==Post-war career==

With the outbreak, naturally racing stopped. Once the war ended, Brudes&#x27; situation was much changed and by 1945, he had lost everything. His family were forced to move to Sedlitz, a small town in east of Germany where his brothers lived. After numerous odd jobs, he moved to Berlin looking for work. He found work at the BMW dealer in Halensee, when he was introduced to an American officer who was interested in racing, Alexander Orley. Brudes was employed to prepared BMW coupés for Orley to race.
When Brudes resuming his own racing career, it was driving one of Orley&#x27;s BMW Orley Speciale, based upon the Vertias-Meteor. It was in this car, he took part in his only World Championship Grand Prix, 1952 Großer Preis von Deutschland. His race latest only 5 laps behind him retired with engine problems. A few years earlier, he received an invitation from August Momberger to drive the new Borgward sports cars, in a number of record attempts. In October 1953, in a very streamlined 1500cc sports car with lightweight twin tube chassis, he set a number of speed and endurance records at L&#x27;autodrome de Linas-Monthlhéry. During the season of 1953, he was finally given a contract by Borgward and became an official works driver. When the team took their steps into international motorsport, Brudes was amongst the squad of drivers. Their first event was the 24 Heures du Mans, with a trio of Borgward-Hansa 1500 Rennsport Coupés. Brudes&#x27;s car would run out of fuel just after three hours of racing.

He would continue to race until 1968, when he made his last competitive appearance on the Taunus Hillclimb, where in an Alfa Romeo Giulia, he finished third in class.

<doc id="1226927" wikidata="Q10836209" url="?curid=1226927" title="Digital currency">
<text>Digital currency (digital money, electronic money or electronic currency) is any currency, money, or money-like asset that is primarily managed, stored or exchanged on digital computer systems, especially over the internet. Types of digital currencies include cryptocurrency, virtual currency and central bank digital currency. Digital currency may be recorded on a distributed database on the internet, a centralized electronic computer database owned by a company or bank, within digital files or even on a stored-value card.

Digital currencies exhibit properties similar to traditional currencies, but generally do not have a classical physical form of fiat currency historically that can be held in the hand, like currencies with printed banknotes or minted coins. However, they do have a physical form in an unclassical sense coming from the computer to computer and computer to human interactions and the information and processing power of the servers that store and keep track of money. This unclassical physical form allows nearly instantaneous transactions over the internet and vastly lowers the cost associated with distributing notes and coins: for example, of the types of money in the UK economy, 3% are notes and coins, and 79% as electronic money (in the form of bank deposits). Usually not issued by a governmental body, virtual currencies are not considered a legal tender and they enable ownership transfer across governmental borders.

This type of currency may be used to buy physical goods and services, but may also be restricted to certain communities such as for use inside an online game.

Digital money can either be centralized, where there is a central point of control over the money supply (for instance, a bank), or decentralized, where the control over the money supply is predetermined or agreed upon democratically.

==History==
Precursory ideas for digital currencies were presented in electronic payment methods such as the Sabre (travel reservation system). In 1983, a research paper titled &quot;Blind Signatures for Untraceable Payments&quot; by David Chaum introduced the idea of digital cash. In 1989, he founded DigiCash, an electronic cash company, in Amsterdam to commercialize the ideas in his research. It filed for bankruptcy in 1998.

e-gold was the first widely used Internet money, introduced in 1996, and grew to several million users before the US Government shut it down in 2008. e-gold has been referenced to as &quot;digital currency&quot; by both US officials and academia. In 1997, Coca-Cola offered buying from vending machines using mobile payments. PayPal launched its USD-denominated service in 1998. In 2009, bitcoin was launched, which marked the start of decentralized blockchain-based digital currencies with no central server, and no tangible assets held in reserve. Also known as cryptocurrencies, blockchain-based digital currencies proved resistant to attempt by government to regulate them, because there was no central organization or person with the power to turn them off.

Origins of digital currencies date back to the 1990s Dot-com bubble. Another known digital currency service was Liberty Reserve, founded in 2006; it lets users convert dollars or euros to Liberty Reserve Dollars or Euros, and exchange them freely with one another at a 1% fee. Several digital currency operations were reputed to be used for Ponzi schemes and money laundering, and were prosecuted by the U.S. government for operating without MSB licenses. Q coins or QQ coins, were used as a type of commodity-based digital currency on Tencent QQ&#x27;s messaging platform and emerged in early 2005. Q coins were so effective in China that they were said to have had a destabilizing effect on the Chinese yuan currency due to speculation. Recent interest in cryptocurrencies has prompted renewed interest in digital currencies, with bitcoin, introduced in 2008, becoming the most widely used and accepted digital currency.

== Sub-types of digital currency and comparisons ==

=== Digital currency as a specific type and as a meta-group name ===
Digital currency is a term that refers to a specific type of electronic currency with specific properties. Digital currency is also a term used to include the meta-group of sub-types of digital currency, the specific meaning can only be determined within the specific legal or contextual case. Legally and technically, there already are a myriad of legal definitions of digital currency and the many digital currency sub-types. Combining different possible properties, there exists an extensive number of implementations creating many and numerous sub-types of digital currency. Many governmental jurisdictions have implemented their own unique definition for digital currency, virtual currency, cryptocurrency, e-money, network money, e-cash, and other types of digital currency. Within any specific government jurisdiction, different agencies and regulators define different and often conflicting meanings for the different types of digital currency based on the specific properties of a specific currency type or sub-type.

===Digital versus virtual currency===

A virtual currency has been defined in 2012 by the European Central Bank as &quot;a type of unregulated, digital money, which is issued and usually controlled by its developers, and used and accepted among the members of a specific virtual community&quot;. The US Department of Treasury in 2013 defined it more tersely as &quot;a medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments, but does not have all the attributes of real currency&quot;. The US Department of Treasury also stated that, &quot;Virtual currency does not have legal-tender status in any jurisdiction.&quot;

According to the European Central Bank&#x27;s 2015 &quot;Virtual currency schemes – a further analysis&quot; report, virtual currency is a digital representation of value, not issued by a central bank, credit institution or e-money institution, which, in some circumstances, can be used as an alternative to money. In the previous report of October 2012, the virtual currency was defined as a type of unregulated, digital money, which is issued and usually controlled by its developers, and used and accepted among the members of a specific virtual community.

According to the Bank for International Settlements&#x27; November 2015 &quot;Digital currencies&quot; report, it is an asset represented in digital form and having some monetary characteristics. Digital currency can be denominated to a sovereign currency and issued by the issuer responsible to redeem digital money for cash. In that case, digital currency represents electronic money (e-money). Digital currency denominated in its own units of value or with decentralized or automatic issuance will be considered as a virtual currency. As such, bitcoin is a digital currency but also a type of virtual currency. bitcoin and its alternatives are based on cryptographic algorithms, so these kinds of virtual currencies are also called cryptocurrencies.

=== Digital versus cryptocurrency ===
Cryptocurrency is a sub-type of digital currency and a digital asset that relies on cryptography to chain together digital signatures of asset transfers, peer-to-peer networking and decentralization. In some cases a proof-of-work or proof-of-stake scheme is used to create and manage the currency. Cryptocurrencies can allow electronic money systems to be decentralized. When implemented with a blockchain, the digital ledger system or record keeping system uses cryptography to edit separate shards of database entries that are distributed across many separate servers. The first and most popular system is bitcoin, a peer-to-peer electronic monetary system based on cryptography.

===Digital versus traditional currency===
Most of the traditional money supply is bank money held on computers. They are considered digital currency in some cases. One could argue that our increasingly cashless society means that all currencies are becoming digital currencies, but they are not presented to us as such.

== Types of systems ==

=== Centralized systems ===
Currency can be exchanged electronically using debit cards and credit cards using electronic funds transfer at point of sale.

==== Mobile digital wallets ====
A number of electronic money systems use contactless payment transfer in order to facilitate easy payment and give the payee more confidence in not letting go of their electronic wallet during the transaction.
* In 1994 Mondex and National Westminster Bank provided an &quot;electronic purse&quot; to residents of Swindon
* In about 2005 Telefónica and BBVA Bank launched a payment system in Spain called Mobipay which used simple short message service facilities of feature phones intended for pay-as-you-go services including taxis and pre-pay phone recharges via a BBVA current bank account debit.
* In January 2010, Venmo launched as a mobile payment system through SMS, which transformed into a social app where friends can pay each other for minor expenses like a cup of coffee, rent and pay a share of the restaurant bill when one has forgotten their wallet. It is popular with college students, but has some security issues. It can be linked to a bank account, credit/debit card or have a loaded value to limit the amount of loss in case of a security breach. Credit cards and non-major debit cards incur a 3% processing fee.
* On 19 September 2011, Google Wallet released in the United States to make it easy to carry all one&#x27;s credit/debit cards on a phone.
* In 2012 Ireland&#x27;s O2 (owned by Telefónica) launched Easytrip to pay road tolls which were charged to the mobile phone account or prepay credit.
* The UK&#x27;s O2 invented O2 Wallet at about the same time. The wallet can be charged with regular bank accounts or cards and discharged by participating retailers using a technique known as &#x27;money messages&#x27;. The service closed in 2014.
* On 9 September 2014, Apple Pay was announced at the iPhone 6 event. In October 2014 it was released as an update to work on iPhone 6 and Apple Watch. It is very similar to Google Wallet, but for Apple devices only.

==== Central bank digital currency ====
A central bank digital currency (CBDC) is a form of universally accessible digital money in a nation and holds the same value as the country&#x27;s paper currency. Like a cryptocurrency, a CBCD is held in the form of tokens. CBDCs are different from regular digital cash forms like in online bank accounts because CBDCs are established through the central bank within a country, with liabilities held by one&#x27;s government, rather than from a commercial bank. Approximately nine countries have already established a CBDC, with interest in the system increasing highly throughout the world. In these nations, CBDCs have been used as a form of exchange and a way for governments to try to prevent risks from occurring within their financial systems.

A major problem with central bank digital currencies is deciding whether the currency should be easily trackable. If it&#x27;s traceable, the government has more control than it currently does. Additionally, there&#x27;s a technical aspect to consider: whether CBDCs should be based on tokens or accounts and how much anonymity users should have.

=== Decentralized systems ===
Digital Currency has been implemented in some cases as a decentralized system of any combination of currency issuance, ownership record, ownership transfer authorization and validation, and currency storage.

Per the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), &quot;These schemes do not distinguish between users based on location, and
therefore allow value to be transferred between users across borders. Moreover, the speed of a
transaction is not conditional on the location of the payer and payee.&quot;

== Law ==
Since 2001, the European Union has implemented the E-Money Directive &quot;on the taking up, pursuit and prudential supervision of the business of electronic money institutions&quot; last amended in 2009.

In the United States, electronic money is governed by Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code for wholesale transactions and the Electronic Fund Transfer Act for consumer transactions. Provider&#x27;s responsibility and consumer&#x27;s liability are regulated under Regulation E.

==Regulation==
Virtual currencies pose challenges for central banks, financial regulators, departments or ministries of finance, as well as fiscal authorities and statistical authorities.

==Adoption by governments==
As of 2016, over 24 countries are investing in distributed ledger technologies (DLT) with $1.4bn in investments. In addition, over 90 central banks are engaged in DLT discussions, including implications of a central bank issued digital currency.
* Hong Kong&#x27;s Octopus card system: Launched in 1997 as an electronic purse for public transportation, is the most successful and mature implementation of contactless smart cards used for mass transit payments. After only 5 years, 25 percent of Octopus card transactions are unrelated to transit, and accepted by more than 160 merchants.
* London Transport&#x27;s Oyster card system: Oyster is a plastic smartcard that can hold pay-as-you-go credit, Travelcards and Bus &amp; Tram season tickets. An Oyster card can be used to travel on bus, Tube, tram, DLR, London Overground and most National Rail services in London.
* Japan&#x27;s FeliCa: A contactless RFID smart card, used in a variety of ways such as in ticketing systems for public transportation, e-money, and residence door keys.
* The Netherlands&#x27; Chipknip: As an electronic cash system used in the Netherlands, all ATM cards issued by the Dutch banks had value that could be loaded via Chipknip loading stations. For people without a bank, pre-paid Chipknip cards could be purchased at various locations in the Netherlands. As of 1 January 2015, payment can no longer be made with Chipknip.
* Belgium&#x27;s Proton: An electronic purse application for debit cards in Belgium. Introduced in February 1995, as a means to replace cash for small transactions. The system was retired on 31 December 2014.
In March 2018, the Marshall Islands became the first country to issue their own cryptocurrency and certify it as legal tender; the currency is called the &quot;sovereign&quot;.

=== United States of America ===

==== US Commodity Futures Trading Commission guidance ====
The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has determined virtual currencies are properly defined as commodities in 2015. The CFTC warned investors against pump and dump schemes that use virtual currencies.

==== US Internal Revenue Service guidance ====
The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruling Notice 2014-21 defines any virtual currency, cryptocurrency and digital currency as property; gains and losses are taxable within standard property policies.

==== US Treasury guidance ====
On 20 March 2013, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued a guidance to clarify how the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act applied to persons creating, exchanging, and transmitting virtual currencies.

====US Securities and Exchange Commission guidance====
In May 2014 the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) &quot;warned about the hazards of bitcoin and other virtual currencies&quot;.

====New York state regulation====
In July 2014, the New York State Department of Financial Services proposed the most comprehensive regulation of virtual currencies to date, commonly called BitLicense. It has gathered input from bitcoin supporters and the financial industry through public hearings and a comment period until 21 October 2014 to customize the rules. The proposal per NY DFS press release &quot;sought to strike an appropriate balance that helps protect consumers and root out illegal activity&quot;. It has been criticized by smaller companies to favor established institutions, and Chinese bitcoin exchanges have complained that the rules are &quot;overly broad in its application outside the United States&quot;.

===Canada===
The Bank of Canada has explored the possibility of creating a version of its currency on the blockchain.

The Bank of Canada teamed up with the nation&#x27;s five largest banks – and the blockchain consulting firm R3 – for what was known as Project Jasper. In a simulation run in 2016, the central bank issued CAD-Coins onto a blockchain similar Ethereum. The banks used the CAD-Coins to exchange money the way they do at the end of each day to settle their master accounts.

===China===

In 2016, Fan Yifei, a deputy governor of China&#x27;s central bank, the People&#x27;s Bank of China (PBOC), wrote that &quot;the conditions are ripe for digital currencies, which can reduce operating costs, increase efficiency and enable a wide range of new applications&quot;. According to Fan Yifei, the best way to take advantage of the situation is for central banks to take the lead, both in supervising private digital currencies and in developing digital legal tender of their own.

In October 2019, the PBOC announced that a digital renminbi would be released after years of preparation. The version of the currency, known as DCEP (Digital Currency Electronic Payment), is based on cryptocurrency which can be &quot;decoupled&quot; from the banking system. The announcement received a variety of responses: some believe it is more about domestic control and surveillance.

In December 2020, the PBOC distributed million worth of digital renminbi to the residents of Suzhou through a lottery program to further promote the government-backed digital currency. Recipients of the currency could make both offline and online purchases, expanding on an earlier trial that did not require internet connection through the inclusion of online stores in the program. Around 20,000 transactions were reported by the e-commerce company JD.com in the first 24 hours of the trial. Contrary to other online payment platforms such as Alipay or WeChat Pay, the digital currency does not have transaction fees.

===Denmark===
The Danish government proposed getting rid of the obligation for selected retailers to accept payment in cash, moving the country closer to a &quot;cashless&quot; economy. The Danish Chamber of Commerce is backing the move. Nearly a third of the Danish population uses MobilePay, a smartphone application for transferring money.

=== Ecuador ===
A law passed by the National Assembly of Ecuador gives the government permission to make payments in electronic currency and proposes the creation of a national digital currency. &quot;Electronic money will stimulate the economy; it will be possible to attract more Ecuadorian citizens, especially those who do not have checking or savings accounts and credit cards alone. The electronic currency will be backed by the assets of the Central Bank of Ecuador&quot;, the National Assembly said in a statement. In December 2015, Sistema de Dinero Electrónico (&quot;electronic money system&quot;) was launched, making Ecuador the first country with a state-run electronic payment system.

=== El Salvador ===
On 9 June 2021, the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador has become the first country in the world to officially classify bitcoin as legal currency. Starting 90 days after approval, every business must accept bitcoin as legal tender for goods or services, unless it is unable to provide the technology needed to do the transaction.

===Netherlands===
The Dutch central bank is experimenting with a blockchain-based virtual currency called &quot;DNBCoin&quot;.

===India===

The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a real-time payment system for instant money transfers between any two bank accounts held in participating banks in India. The interface has been developed by the National Payments Corporation of India and is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. This digital payment system is available 24 hours a day, every day of the year. UPI is agnostic to the type of user and is used for person to person, person to business, business to person and business to business transactions.
Transactions can be initiated by the payer or the payee. To identify a bank account it uses a unique Virtual Payment Address (VPA) of the type &#x27;accountID@bankID&#x27;. The VPA can be assigned by the bank, but can also be self specified just like an email address. The simplest and most common form of VPA is &#x27;mobilenumber@upi&#x27;. Money can be transferred from one VPA to another or from one VPA to any bank account in a participating bank using account number and bank branch details. Transfers can be inter-bank or intra-bank.
UPI has no intermediate holding pond for money. It withdraws funds directly from the bank account of the sender and deposits them directly into the recipient&#x27;s bank account whenever a transaction is requested. A sender can initiate and authorise a transfer using a two step secure process: login using a pass code → initiate → verify using a passcode. A receiver can initiate a payment request on the system to send the payer a notification or by presenting a QR code. On receiving the request, the payer can decline or confirm the payment using the same two step process: login → confirm → verify. The system is extraordinarily user friendly to the extent that even technophobes and barely literate users are adopting it in huge numbers.

===Russia===
Government-controlled Sberbank of Russia owns YooMoney – electronic payment service and digital currency of the same name.

===Sweden===
Sweden is in the process of replacing all of its physical banknotes, and most of its coins by mid-2017. However, the new banknotes and coins of the Swedish krona will probably be circulating at about half the 2007 peak of 12,494 kronor per capita. The Riksbank is planning to begin discussions of an electronic currency issued by the central bank to which &quot;is not to replace cash, but to act as complement to it&quot;. Deputy Governor Cecilia Skingsley states that cash will continue to spiral out of use in Sweden, and while it is currently fairly easy to get cash in Sweden, it is often very difficult to deposit it into bank accounts, especially in rural areas. No decision has been currently made about the decision to create &quot;e-krona&quot;.

In her speech, Skingsley states: &quot;The first question is whether e-krona should be booked in accounts or whether the ekrona should be some form of a digitally transferable unit that does not need an underlying account structure, roughly like cash.&quot; Skingsley also states: &quot;Another important question is whether the Riksbank should issue e-krona directly to the general public or go via the banks, as we do now with banknotes and coins.&quot; Other questions will be addressed like interest rates, should they be positive, negative, or zero?

===Switzerland===
In 2016, a city government first accepted digital currency in payment of city fees. Zug, Switzerland, added bitcoin as a means of paying small amounts, up to , in a test and an attempt to advance Zug as a region that is advancing future technologies. In order to reduce risk, Zug immediately converts any bitcoin received into the Swiss currency. Swiss Federal Railways, government-owned railway company of Switzerland, sells bitcoins at its ticket machines.

===UK===
In 2016, the UK&#x27;s chief scientific adviser, Sir Mark Walport, advised the government to consider using a blockchain-based digital currency.

The chief economist of Bank of England, the central bank of the United Kingdom, proposed the abolition of paper currency. The Bank has also taken an interest in blockchain. In 2016 it has embarked on a multi-year research programme to explore the implications of a central bank issued digital currency. The Bank of England has produced several research papers on the topic. One suggests that the economic benefits of issuing a digital currency on a distributed ledger could add as much as 3 percent to a country&#x27;s economic output. The Bank said that it wanted the next version of the bank&#x27;s basic software infrastructure to be compatible with distributed ledgers.

==Adoption by financial actors==
Government attitude dictates the tendency among established heavy financial actors that both are risk-averse and conservative. None of these offered services around cryptocurrencies and much of the criticism came from them. &quot;The first mover among these has been Fidelity Investments, Boston based Fidelity Digital Assets LLC will provide enterprise-grade custody solutions, a cryptocurrency trading execution platform and institutional advising services 24 hours a day, seven days a week designed to align with blockchain&#x27;s always-on trading cycle&quot;. It will work with bitcoin and Ethereum with general availability scheduled for 2019.

== Hard vs. soft digital currencies ==
Hard electronic currency does not have the ability to be disputed or reversed when used. It is nearly impossible to reverse a transaction, justified or not. It is very similar to cash. Contrarily, soft electronic currency payments can be reversed. Usually, when a payment is reversed there is a &quot;clearing time.&quot; A hard currency can be &quot;softened&quot; with a third-party service.

== Criticism ==
Many existing digital currencies have not yet seen widespread usage, and may not be easily used or exchanged. Banks generally do not accept or offer services for them. There are concerns that cryptocurrencies are extremely risky due to their very high volatility and potential for pump and dump schemes. Regulators in several countries have warned against their use and some have taken concrete regulatory measures to dissuade users. The non-cryptocurrencies are all centralized. As such, they may be shut down or seized by a government at any time. The more anonymous a currency is, the more attractive it is to criminals, regardless of the intentions of its creators. bitcoin has also been criticised for its energy inefficient SHA-256-based proof of work.

According to Barry Eichengreen, an economist known for his work on monetary and financial economics, &quot;cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are too volatile to possess the essential attributes of money. Stablecoins have fragile currency pegs that diminish their utility in transactions. And central bank digital currencies are a solution in search of a problem.&quot;

<text>The Gambia national football team (recognized as The Gambia by FIFA) represents The Gambia in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Gambia Football Federation. Until 1965, the team and the country were known as British Gambia. The team has never qualified for the World Cup. In 2021, Gambia qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations finals for the first time in history. The team represents both FIFA and Confederation of African Football (CAF).

==History==
Under the name British Gambia, the team played their first ever game on 9 February 1953 against Sierra Leone, winning 2–1 at home in a friendly. In April 1963, the team entered the &quot;L&#x27;Amitié&quot; tournament in Senegal, a competition mainly for French-speaking nations. They were drawn in a group with France&#x27;s amateur team, the Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) and Gabon. Their first match was lost 5–1 to the French amateurs on 11 April. The Gambia drew 2–2 with the Upper Volta on 13 April, and had the same result the very next day versus Gabon. The Gambia did not advance to the next round.

After the tournament in Senegal, the Gambia did not play another match until 16 November 1968, when they travelled to Sierra Leone to play its team in a friendly and lost 2–1. They played again in Sierra Leone in The Gambia&#x27;s next match on 24 April 1971, and the hosts won 3–1. On 2 May 1971, The Gambia travelled to Guinea for a friendly and lost 4–2. On 14 May 1972, The Gambia returned to Guinea for their first African Games qualifier and lost 8–0 and were knocked out.

In 1975, the Gambia entered its first qualification campaign for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Canada. They were drawn in a qualifier against Guinea, and lost the first leg 1–0 at home on 27 April 1975. The second leg was lost 6–0 in Guinea on 1 June as Guinea advanced 7–0 on aggregate.

In August of that same year, the Gambia entered their first qualification for the African Cup of Nations, with the aim of reaching the 1976 finals in Ethiopia. They were drawn in a two-legged qualifier against Morocco and lost the first leg 3–0 away on 10 August. They lost by the same score in their home leg on 24 August and Morocco advanced 6–0 on aggregate.

After the qualification campaign for the 1976 finals, The Gambia played their first match against a full European side, losing a home friendly 4–1 to Denmark on 30 January 1977.

On 13 October 2002, the team got their biggest ever victory in international competition, a 6–0 victory against Lesotho.

In May 2014, the Gambia was banned from all CAF competitions for two years after deliberately falsifying players&#x27; ages.

The nation&#x27;s fortunes improved in qualification for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. Although they failed to qualify, they took it to the final round of games, including drawing twice with African giants Algeria.

On 13 November, in their first Group D match of 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualification, Gambia defeated Angola 1–3 in Luanda. This was the Scorpions&#x27; first away win in an AFCON or FIFA World Cup qualifier ever, at their 40th attempt. An impressive campaign saw them qualify for their first ever major tournament that year. As the lowest-ranked team in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, the Gambia defied the odds by defeating favourites Tunisia in the group stage, finishing unbeaten in 2nd place in the group. A further win against Guinea in the Round of 16 saw them reach the quarter-finals at their first attempt, eventually going out to tournament hosts Cameroon.

==Home stadium==

The Independence Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Bakau, Gambia. It is currently used mostly for football matches, although it is also used for music concerts, political events, trade fairs and national celebrations. The stadium holds 30,000 people.

<doc id="1226932" wikidata="Q3059562" url="?curid=1226932" title="Eugene Jackson">
<text>Eugene W. Jackson II (December 25, 1916 – October 26, 2001) was an American child actor who was a regular of the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short series during the silent Pathé era.

==Career==
When he joined the gang, Jackson replaced the series&#x27; first black cast member, Ernie Morrison who was billed in the series as Sunshine Sammy, Jackson&#x27;s characters nickname was &quot;Pineapple&quot; because of his haircut&#x27;s similarity to the shape of the pineapple fruit.

He played the character &quot;Humidor&quot; in one of Mary Pickford&#x27;s most successful films, &quot;Little Annie Rooney&quot; (1925). A large film poster of the cast of &quot;Little Annie Rooney&quot;, including Jackson, hangs in the lobby of the Mary Pickford Theatre of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Hollywood.

Jackson also starred in &quot;Hearts in Dixie&quot; (1929), one of the first all-talking, big-studio productions to boast a predominately African-American cast. He was the first African-American child to have a speaking part in a major motion picture.

In television, Jackson was a recurring character on &quot;Julia&quot;, the first network sitcom to have a female African-American lead, Diahann Carroll. Jackson played Julia&#x27;s uncle.

Jackson&#x27;s last major feature film was &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1991) with Anjelica Huston, Raul Julia and Christopher Lloyd. He played a one-armed musician.

Jackson wrote an autobiography in 1999 that contains pictures from his career in show business.

==Death==
Jackson died of a heart attack in Compton, California on October 26, 2001. He was 84.

<text>HippoPress is the publisher of the free weekly newspaper Hippo, based in Manchester, New Hampshire. 

== History ==
&quot;Hippo&quot;, which is independently owned by Jody Reese, Jeff Rapsis and Dan Szczesny, started in January 2001. In 2004 it launched a second edition in Nashua and in 2005 it started a third in Concord. In 2007 the editions were combined into one newspaper with a circulation of 42,000. 

In 2009 HippoPress launched Quality of Life Printing and Distribution, a commercial distribution service for other free newspapers and fliers. QOL Distribution circulates publications throughout New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. QOL Printing offers commercial printing. It also handled direct mail and list services. 

In 2010, Hippo launched &quot;Seacoast Hippo&quot;, a free weekly distributed from mid June through mid September, to cover arts, entertainment and events in the Seacoast region of southern Maine, New Hampshire and northern Massachusetts. It has a weekly circulation of 20,000 and is distributed along the coast from Kennebunkport to Newburyport.

The Hippo&#x27;s parent company, Quality of Life Publication, began some other publications that later folded: a free weekday newspaper in Manchester called the &quot;Manchester Daily Express&quot;; &quot;The Oxx&quot;, a semi-weekly circular geared towards males that in the summer of 2007 was turned into a monthly called &quot;OxxCycle&quot;, covering the state&#x27;s motorcycling scene, that in 2009 was converted to a semi-yearly glossy magazine before shutting. In 2009, HippoPress purchased &quot;The York Independent&quot;, a twice-monthly newspaper in York, Maine, that ceased publication around 2011.

<doc id="1226947" wikidata="Q1072137" url="?curid=1226947" title="Chichimeca">
<text>Chichimeca () is the name that the Nahua peoples of Mexico generically applied to nomadic and semi-nomadic peoples who were established in present-day Bajío region of Mexico. Chichimeca carried the same meaning as the Roman term &quot;barbarian&quot; that described Germanic tribes. The name, with its pejorative sense, was adopted by the Spanish Empire. In the words of scholar Charlotte M. Gradie, &quot;for the Spanish, the Chichimecas were a wild, nomadic people who lived north of the Valley of Mexico. They had no fixed dwelling places, lived by hunting, wore little clothes and fiercely resisted foreign intrusion into their territory, which happened to contain silver mines the Spanish wished to exploit.&quot; Gradie noted that Chichimeca was used as a broad and generalizing term by outsiders, writing, &quot;[it] was used by both Spanish and Nahuatl speakers to refer collectively to many different people who exhibited a wide range of cultural development from hunter-gatherers to sedentary agriculturalists with sophisticated political organizations.&quot; They practiced animal sacrifice, and they were feared for their expertise and brutality in war.

The Chichimeca War (1550-1590) ended with the Spanish making favorable peace terms with the Chichimeca. Spanish/Chichimeca interaction resulted in a &quot;drastic population decline in population of all the peoples known collectively as Chichimecas, and to their eventual disappearance as peoples of all save the Pames of San Luis Potosí and the related Chichimeca-Jonaz of the Sierra Gorda in eastern Guanajuato.&quot; In modern times, only one ethnic group is customarily referred to as Chichimecs, namely the Chichimeca Jonaz, a few thousand of whom live in the state of Guanajuato.

== Etymology ==
The Nahuatl name &quot;Chīchīmēcah&quot; (plural, pronounced ; singular &quot;Chīchīmēcatl&quot;) means &quot;inhabitants of Chichiman,&quot; &quot;Chichiman&quot; meaning &quot;area of milk.&quot; It is sometimes said to be related to &quot;chichi&quot; &quot;dog&quot;, but both &quot;i&quot;&#x27;s in &quot;chichi&quot; are short, and both in &quot;Chīchīmēcah&quot; are long. That changes the meaning, as vowel length is phonemic in Nahuatl.

==Ethnohistorical descriptions==
In the late sixteenth century, Gonzalo de las Casas wrote about the Chichimec. He had received an &quot;encomienda&quot; near Durango and fought in the wars against the Chichimec peoples: the Pame, the Guachichil, the Guamare and the Zacateco, who lived in the area known at the time as &quot;La Gran Chichimeca.&quot; Las Casas&#x27; account was called &quot;Report of the Chichimeca and the Justness of the War Against Them.&quot; He described the people, providing ethnographic information. He wrote that they only covered their genitalia with clothing; painted their bodies; and ate only game, roots and berries. He mentioned, in order to prove their supposed barbarity, that Chichimec women, having given birth, continued traveling on the same day without stopping to recover.

In the late 16th century, according to the Spanish, the Chichimeca did not worship idols as did many of the surrounding indigenous peoples.

==Wars with the Spanish==

Chichimeca military strikes against the Spanish included raidings, ambushing critical economic routes, and pillaging. In the long-running Chichimeca War (1550–1590), the Spanish initially attempted to defeat the combined Chichimeca peoples in a war of &quot;fire and blood&quot;, but eventually sought peace as they were unable to defeat them. The Chichimeca&#x27;s small-scale raids proved effective. To end the war, the Spanish adopted a &quot;Purchase for Peace&quot; program by providing foods, tools, livestock, and land to the Chichimecas, sending Spanish to teach them agriculture as a livelihood, and by converting them to Catholicism. Within a century, the Spanish and Chichimeca assimilated.

<text>Jay R. Smith (August 29, 1915 – October 5, 2002) was an American child actor and comedian who had a brief career appearing the &quot;Our Gang&quot; film short series during the silent Pathé era, from 1925 to 1929. He racked up appearances in 36 shorts, where he was billed as the skinny freckle-faced character &quot;Specks&quot;. This series was syndicated to television as &quot;The Little Rascals&quot;.

==Career==
Smith&#x27;s first film in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series was &quot;Boys Will Be Joys&quot; in 1925. He rivalled the retiring Mickey Daniels as the freckle-faced kid in the gang and continued until the silent era ended. He also appeared as himself in &quot;45 Minutes from Hollywood&quot; (1926).

Bowing to pressure from the studio, Smith appeared in the sixth &quot;Our Gang&quot; talkie titled &quot;Moan and Groan, Inc.&quot; (1929), his only talkie. He was dissatisfied with his performance in the film and feared he would not have a successful career in talkies, he quit acting overall. He came back to appear in The Boy Friends&#x27; episode &quot;Blood and Thunder&quot;, where he was seen throwing water.

==Personal life==
Jay R. Smith, the son of a labourer, was one of 5 siblings. His younger brother, Donnie &quot;Beezer&quot; Smith, appeared in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short film &quot;Cat, Dog &amp; Co.&quot;.

According to an article in &quot;Variety&quot; in 1936, Smith was married to Gloria Narath, who provided the original voice of the Disney character Minnie Mouse, for Walt Disney Studios. He later married Mabel Florine Case, and they remained married until her death on February 1, 2002. After leaving acting, Smith, a native of Los Angeles, California, joined the U.S. Navy. He served during World War II in Guam before starting his own retail paint business and moving to Kailua, Hawaii.

==Murder==
Smith, having retired from the retail paint business after 15 years, moved to Las Vegas, Nevada in the early 1990s. 

In October 2002, aged 87, he was reported missing by his daughter. His body was found on October 5, 2002, in the desert near Las Vegas. He had died of multiple stab wounds. 

52-year-old Charles Wayne Crombie (known as Wayne), a homeless man whom Smith reportedly befriended, was convicted of the murder of Smith, stealing his belongings and Visa debit card, multiple counts of fraud, and stealing his motor vehicle. 

Crombie was sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison, which he was serving at the Northern Nevada Correctional Center where he died on July 17, 2014, of which was described in press reports as a &quot;chronic illness&quot; at the age of 64.

<doc id="1226954" wikidata="Q1646516" url="?curid=1226954" title="Jean Darling">
<text>Jean Darling (born Dorothy Jean LeVake; August 23, 1922 – September 4, 2015) was an American child actress who was a regular in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short subjects series from 1927–29. Prior to her death, she was one of four surviving cast members from the silent era cast of &quot;Our Gang&quot; (Lassie Lou Ahern, Mildred Kornman and Dorothy Morrison being the others). At the time of her death in 2015, Darling was, along with Baby Peggy, one of the last surviving actors who worked in the silent film era.

==Child star==
Born Dorothy Jean LeVake, her name was legally changed to Jean Darling when she was five months old, a few days after her mother and father separated. She began in movies at six months old as a freelance baby. She got her break in 1926 when she passed a screen test and was accepted for a part in Hal Roach&#x27;s &quot;Our Gang&quot; series. Darling appeared in 46 silents and five talkies with &quot;Our Gang&quot; during this period. She left the series in the fall of 1929 along with Joe Cobb and Harry Spear. She was not replaced right away.

She continued to appear in films after leaving the gang, including an appearance in Laurel &amp; Hardy&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; (uncredited) and as the young Jane in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (both 1934). A round of stage and radio shows followed. Stage shows involved up to seven performances a day. It was a punishing schedule for a fourteen-year-old, and that was not taking into account her educational studies.

==Later life and career==
Darling began to study singing, and in 1940 she was given a scholarship by the New York Municipal Opera Association. She turned down an offer to appear alongside Mickey Rooney in one of the MGM &quot;Andy Hardy&quot; movies, and went on Broadway, making her debut in the musical &quot;Count Me In&quot; in 1942. Darling&#x27;s stage career hit a real high when she landed the role of Carrie Pipperidge in the original Broadway production of &quot;Carousel&quot; in 1945. She appeared in 850 consecutive performances.

Her role as Carrie Pipperidge helped her with parts for radio and TV in the 1950s. She hosted her own television show for NBC in New York City, &quot;A Date with Jean Darling&quot;. Her daily TV show for women, &quot;The Singing Knit-Witch&quot;, was aired on KHJ-TV in Hollywood. Her last work was a humorous silent comedy short, &quot;The Butler&#x27;s Tale&quot;, from 2013. Written and directed by her good friend René Riva, a Dutch actor and singer, it was styled after the ones Darling starred in as a child.

In 1974, Darling moved to Dublin, Ireland, where she wrote mystery stories and had over 50 short stories published in the &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; and &quot;Whispers&quot;. As &quot;Aunty Poppy&quot;, she read stories, which she wrote herself, on RTÉ radio and TV. She also wrote plays for radio and worked as a journalist.

==Personal life==
Darling married Reuben Bowen; they had a son, Roy. Reuben Bowen died of cancer on August 22, 1980. She never remarried. She later lived with her son in Rodgau, Germany.

She died at a nursing home in Rödermark on September 4, 2015, after a sudden illness, aged 93. Her death was reported two days later.

<text>Joseph Patrick Jones (born 4 March 1955) is a Welsh former footballer who played as a full-back.

Jones most notably played for Liverpool, with whom he won two European Cups. He is also known for his long association with Wrexham, playing for the club in three separate stints, and has been involved in the coaching set-up on-and-off since the early 1990s, including a brief spell as caretaker manager in 2001. Internationally, he represented Wales on 72 occasions from 1975 to 1986.

==Club career==

===Wrexham===
Jones was born in Llandudno, and joined Wrexham in 1971. He made his debut at the age of 17 in a Welsh Cup tie against local rivals Chester City; Wrexham lost 1–0. He did, however, win the Welsh Cup with the club in 1975, when they beat Cardiff City in the final. Jones established himself as a right-back and helped Wrexham to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in 1974, the first time the club had reached that stage.

===Liverpool===
Jones left Wrexham to join his boyhood heroes, Liverpool (he had a Liverbird tattoo, which he later had removed for medical reasons, on his forearm), when Bob Paisley paid £110,000 for his services in July 1975. He made his debut on 16 August in a 2–0 league defeat to Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. He missed out on a league championship medal in 1975–76, as he did not play enough matches to qualify.

In 1977, Jones was part of the treble-chasing Liverpool team which won the League championship and reached the finals of the FA Cup and European Cup. Jones scored his first goal for the club on 9 November 1976 in the 5–1 league thrashing of Leicester City at Anfield. The treble, unprecedented in English football, was not forthcoming. Liverpool lost 2–1 in the FA Cup final at Wembley to Manchester United, though Jones supplied the accurate long pass for Jimmy Case to score Liverpool&#x27;s goal. However, Jones became the first Welshman to receive a European Cup winners medal when Liverpool won their first European Cup in Rome four days later, defeating Borussia Mönchengladbach 3–1. A memorable banner was unfurled by Liverpool supporters at the European Cup final in Rome which said &quot;Joey Ate The Frogs Legs, Made The Swiss Roll, Now He&#x27;s Munching Gladbach&quot;.

Jones was in and out of the side the following year, with the renaissance of Tommy Smith and the emergence of young Scottish defender Alan Hansen severely reducing his first team opportunities. He left in the summer of 1978 after exactly 100 appearances, in which he scored 3 goals.

===Return to Wrexham===
He returned to Wrexham in 1978 for £210,000, a record that stood as Wrexham&#x27;s record signing, until the £300,000 signing of Ollie Palmer in January 2022.

===Chelsea===
In 1982, Jones joined Chelsea for £34,000, having been signed by John Neal. Jones was sent off on his debut against Carlisle United at Brunton Park. However, Jones&#x27;s committed attitude and pre-match fist-clenching ritual eventually made him a cult hero among the fans. He also proved instrumental in Chelsea&#x27;s successful battle to avoid relegation to the Third Division. He was a part of the side which romped to promotion as Second Division champions in 1983–84. He remained with the club in the top flight for one more season, before surprisingly being sold to Huddersfield Town for £35,000 in August 1985. He finished his Chelsea career with 78 league appearances and 2 goals.

===Later career===
He joined Huddersfield in the summer of 1985 from Chelsea, and was named Town&#x27;s player of the year in his first season. After two seasons he left to re-join Wrexham, where he retired at the end of the 1991–92 season.

==International career==
Joey made his Wales debut in November 1975 against Austria. He went on to win 72 caps, scoring one goal, his last action coming in a friendly away to Canada in May 1986.

==After retirement==
Jones underwent cardiac surgery in 2002 and has since scaled down his commitments with Wrexham, where he worked as the Under 18&#x27;s and Reserve team coach until his retirement in 2017. He returned to the club in the position of youth team ambassador in 2021. In 2001, he had a brief spell as caretaker manager between the departure of Brian Flynn and arrival of Denis Smith.

In 2005, Jones completed his autobiography entitled &quot;Oh Joey, Joey!&quot; about his life in football. This was a book of the week on Sky Sports News in February 2006.

Also in 2005, Jones was named as Wrexham&#x27;s ultimate Cult Hero on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Football Focus&quot;. Jones is much respected by Liverpool supporters and he finished in 63rd place in the 2006 poll of all-time favourite Liverpool players (&quot;100 Players who shook the Kop&quot;). 110,000 fans worldwide had taken part in the vote.

<text>Suro (), posthumous name Sureung (; ?–199), commonly called Kim Suro, was the legendary founder and Hero King of Geumgwan Gaya (43–532), in southeastern Korea.

== Legend ==
According to the founding legend of Geumgwan Gaya, which was recorded in the 13th century texts of the chronicle &quot;Garakguk-gi&quot; and was cited in &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, when the 9 Khans (9干) and their people who were commanded by heaven performed ancestral rites, danced and sang, a gold bowl wrapped in red cloth came down from heaven. There were six eggs in them, and 12 days later six princes were born from the eggs. Suro was the firstborn among them and led the others in setting up six states while asserting the leadership of the Gaya confederacy.

Also according to legend, King Suro&#x27;s wife, Heo Hwang-ok or Suriratna was a princess from a distant country called Ayuta 아유타, 阿踰, also implied to be in Southern India.

The legend as a whole is seen as indicative of the early view of kings as descended from heaven. Notably, a number of Korean Kingdoms besides Gaya, made foundation legends with ties to chickens and eggs. Jumong, the founding King of Goguryeo, is said to have been born from an egg laid by Lady Yuhwa; Park Hyeokgeose, the first King of Silla (or Saro-guk) is said to have hatched from an egg discovered in a well; and Kim Al-chi, the progenitor of the Kim dynasty of Silla, is said to have been discovered in Gyerim Forest by Hogong in a golden box, where a rooster was crowing. Aspects of the legend have been mined for information about the customs of Gaya, of which little is known.

==Family==
*Wife: Heo Hwang-ok
**1st son: King Geodeung
**2nd son: Prince Geochil of the Heo clan ()
**3rd son: Prince Seongyeong of the Heo clan ()
**seven other sons (all become Buddhist monks: Haejin (); Gakcho (); Jigam (); Deungyeon (); Dumu (); Jeonghong (); Gyejang ())
**1st daughter: Princess Yeongan () – married Bae Yeolmun ().
**2nd daughter: Lady Jijinnaerye of the Kim clan () – married Seok Guchu ().

== Incorporation of tomb into the Silla ancestor worship ==
At the time of King Munmu, the spirit tablet of Suro was temporarily respected along with fellow Silla Kings, as Munmu was his 15th grandson. According to the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, Munmu ordered the Jesa of King Suro.

==In modern culture==

===Tomb and descendants===

A tomb attributed to King Suro is still maintained in modern-day Gimhae. Members of the Gimhae Kim clan, who continue to play essential roles in Korean life today, trace their ancestry to King Suro, as do the members of the Incheon Yi clan and Gimhae Heo clan; they did not inter-marry until the beginning of the 20th century. A Memorial Park for Kim Suro and his wife Heo Hwang-ok is being built in Ayodhya, India jointly by South Korean Government and Indian Government to strengthen relationship between both countries on the grounds of history and cultural heritage. Ayodhya and Gimhae became sister cities in 2001.

<doc id="1226959" wikidata="Q5672525" url="?curid=1226959" title="Harry Spear">
<text>Harry Sherman Bonner (December 16, 1921 – September 22, 2006), also known as Harry Spear, was an American child actor and vaudevillian. He was notable for appearing in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short subjects series from 1927 to 1929 and Educational Pictures shorts from 1925 to 1927. He was a native of Los Angeles, California.

Notable for appearing in a total of 31 &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies, Spear also appeared in other shorts before his time in the Gang. He gained recognition for his ginger hair and freckles, as both of his well-known nicknames. After leaving the film business, Spear started in vaudeville.

== Early life ==
Born on December 16, 1921, on Los Angeles, California, Harry was born to Joseph Francis Bonner and Louise Dorothy Spear 

He had a grandmother, Bertha Spear. Spear&#x27;s legal surname, Bonner, was not used in documents like contracts, with his mother&#x27;s maiden name, Spear being used instead. This was used after his parents divorced.

== Acting career ==
=== Early acting career ===

Before joining the wildly popular &quot;Our Gang&quot; series, Spear made appearances in several &quot;Juvenile Comedies&quot; as supporting character Ginger. He also appeared in Educational Pictures comedias, like the &quot;Tuxedo Comedies&quot;, and in a couple &quot;Smith Family&quot; shorts. Though Spear slowly was given a lead role over time, Spear was often foreshadowed by &quot;Big Boy&quot; Malcolm Sebastian, the leading and youngest character in the series. Even though Maltin, Leonard and Bann state that he appeared in a few Buck Jones westerns, Spear actually appeared in one, The Flying Horseman.

=== &quot;Our Gang&quot; ===

Spear made his first appearance in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series at the age of five in the film &quot;Chicken Feed&quot;. Spear first made small appearances as an extra during mid-1927. After a void was left by Scooter Lowry after his contract expired, Spear took over the &quot;tough kid&quot; role, often targeting Allen &quot;Farina&quot; Hoskins, though it would not be until 1928 when Spear made appearances as a leader. Spear was a popular member of the gang during the late silent era (1927–1929), often donning an oversized bowler hat. At the dawn of the sound era, newcomer Jackie Cooper took over the role as either the leader or tough guy in the gang, replacing Spear, though Spear did make a few sound appearances. Spear&#x27;s final &quot;Our Gang&quot; film would be &quot;Bouncing Babies&quot;.

== Vaudeville ==
After departing the series, Spear briefly entered vaudeville, entertaining audiences with a dancing and monologue routine. Joining in 1930, Spear was dubbed as Freckles and known for his bad boy character. He was one of the young vaudeville stars that took dance instruction from Roy Randolph around September of that year. Spear &quot;told several amusing stories&quot; at a meeting of the Rotary Club in Waynesboro, Virginia, in April 1932. In Christmas 1933, twelve-year-old Spear would be offered a contract for a series similar to that of Horatio Alger, however, it was never completed. In the mid-1940s, though, he had left the entertainment industry and severed ties with his former &quot;Our Gang&quot; alumni.

== Lost &quot;Rascal&quot; ==
Spear&#x27;s whereabouts after the 1940s remained a mystery for over half a century. However, several diligent &quot;Our Gang&quot; fans attempted to track down Spear in 1995. Residing in San Diego, California, at the time, Spear (who went by his legal name of Harry Bonner) continually denied being the &quot;Harry Spear&quot; of &quot;Our Gang&quot; fame for unknown reasons, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary From U.S. Naval records, it was found that Harry Spear served as a Chief Petty Officer in the U.S. Navy during World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam War.
== Death ==
Spear died of kidney cancer on September 22, 2006, in San Diego, California. He was 84 years of age.
== Personal life ==
Spear was managed by his grandmother Bertha Spear, who was also his legal guardian. Some name confusion existed for a while because of a different actor named Harry Spear, who appeared in some bit roles in several movies in the 1960s.

<doc id="1226963" wikidata="Q413272" url="?curid=1226963" title="Glaucophane">
<text>Glaucophane is a mineral and a mineral group belonging to the sodic amphibole supergroup of the double chain inosilicates, with the chemical formula Na2(Mg3Al2)Si8O22(OH)2.

Glaucophane crystallizes in the monoclinic system.

==Name==
Glaucophane is named for its typical blue color. In Greek, &quot;glaucophane&quot; means &quot;blue appearing&quot;. As the major mineral component, it is glaucophane&#x27;s color that gives the &quot;blueschist&quot; metamorphic rock type its name.

==Characteristics==
The blue color is very diagnostic for this species. Glaucophane, along with the closely related mineral riebeckite, to which it forms a series with, and their intermediate crossite, are the only well known amphiboles that are commonly blue. Glaucophane forms a solid solution series with ferroglaucophane (). Glaucophane is the magnesium-rich endmember and ferroglaucophane is the iron-rich endmember.

Ferroglaucophane is similar to glaucophane but is slightly denser and hence increased specific gravity. The two endmembers are indistinguishable in hand specimens and are strongly pleochroic. Glaucophane&#x27;s hardness is 5–6 and its specific gravity is approximately 3–3.2.

==Occurrence==
The blueschist metamorphic facies gets its name from abundant blue minerals glaucophane and lawsonite. Glaucophane generally forms in blueschist metamorphic rocks of gabbroic or basaltic composition that are rich in sodium and have experienced low temperature-high pressure metamorphism such as would occur along a subduction zone.

This material has undergone intense pressure and moderate heat as it was subducted downward toward the mantle. Glaucophane is also found in eclogites that have undergone retrograde metamorphism.

There is also a rare amphibole called holmquistite, chemical formula Li2Mg3Al2Si8O22(OH)2, which occurs only in lithium-rich continental rocks. For many years, holmquistite was mistaken for glaucophane, as the two look identical in thin section.

<text>William Churchill Houston ( 1746 – August 12, 1788), a Founding Father of the United States, was a teacher, lawyer and statesman. Houston served as a delegate representing New Jersey in both the Continental Congress and Constitutional Convention. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1780.

==Early life and career==
Houston was born in the Sumter District of central South Carolina. His parents, Archibald and Margaret Houston, were farmers who had emigrated to the then British colony from Ireland. He studied at the Poplar Tent Academy before attending the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University), where he taught grammar school on the side to fund his studies. After his graduation in 1768 he stayed on as a tutor and became a professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy (science) in 1771. He married Jane Smith and together they had five children. It was probably Houston&#x27;s connection with the college and John Witherspoon that drew him into politics as the Revolution approached. John Adams, who met him in 1774, applauded him as among the Sons of Liberty, and in the winter of 1775, he had traveled to Boston, possibly for the Continental Congress. In February 1776, the New Jersey Council of Safety recorded his election as an officer in the Somerset County militia; he resigned that summer, to return to the college, but apparently took up his commission again in the fall, when British forces moved on Princeton, and may have seen active combat during the winter campaigns in central New Jersey.

==American Revolution==

===Militia===
When British forces occupied Princeton in 1776 at the outset of the Revolution the college was closed and the students and professors returned home. Houston then joined with the militia of nearby Somerset County and saw action in the area. He was later elected Captain of one of their companies. When the British withdrew from New Jersey in 1777 and the college reopened, he returned to his teaching post. Houston&#x27;s most significant contributions to rebellion came not as a soldier, however, but as public official in New Jersey and in the revolutionary confederation government. In March 1777 he was elected to the position of Deputy Secretary of the Continental Congress, serving under Charles Thomson, and continued in the post until September, when Somerset County sent him to the New Jersey General Assembly as one of its three representatives. He remained active in the Assembly, gradually gaining greater and greater committee responsibilities, until May 1779, when he and Abraham Clark were elected as New Jersey representatives to the Continental Congress (replacing Frederick Frelinghuysen and Elias Dayton). He played a particularly active role in Congress through July 1781, when he became seriously ill, and then served intermittently, through the winter of 1785.

===Continental Congress and legal career===
He was elected to represent Somerset County in the New Jersey General Assembly in 1777. In 1778 he served on the state&#x27;s Committee of Safety. Then from 1779 to 1781 New Jersey sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress. His work in Congress was largely directed to issues of finance and supply. He began to study law under Richard Stockton and was admitted to the bar in April 1781.

He returned to the college and also opened a law office in Trenton. During these years he was named as clerk of the New Jersey Supreme Court. In 1783, he resigned from the college to devote himself to his legal career. He returned to the Continental Congress in 1784 and 1785.

===Constitutional Convention delegate===
In 1786 Houston was appointed to a commission to study the defects in the Articles of Confederation which joined the states. He went to the Annapolis Convention to discuss the problem. Instead of proposing changes to the articles, this Convention called for a full Constitutional Convention. When the United States Constitutional Convention assembled in 1787, he went to Philadelphia, and Pennsylvania as a delegate. Houston only remained at the convention for a week before his failing health caused him to withdraw.

==Death==
Houston died of tuberculosis the following year in Frankford, Pennsylvania (now part of Philadelphia) and was buried at the Second Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Philadelphia. Later, he was reburied at the Mount Vernon Cemetery in Philadelphia.

<text>Alan &quot;Al&quot; Victor Pease (15 October 1921 – 4 May 2014) was a British-Canadian motor racing driver, who was born in Darlington, England. He holds the unusual accolade of being the only driver to be disqualified from a Formula One World Championship race due to being too slow.

==Biography==
Growing up in England, he joined the British Army as a young man, serving in India, Rhodesia and Egypt. After his service, he emigrated to the United States, then Canada, in the 1960s; after a brief career as an illustrator, he took up motorsports.

He participated in three Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 27 August 1967. He is the only competitor disqualified from a World Championship race, the 1969 Canadian Grand Prix, for being too slow. He was black-flagged after a series of on-track incidents, the last involving Matra driver Jackie Stewart. In response, Matra owner, Ken Tyrrell, protested to the officials and had Pease disqualified. At the time, he had completed 22 laps in an uncompetitive car while the leaders had finished 46. His Formula One career was limited to three Canadian Grands Prix, consisting of a non-classification (1967, finishing 43 laps behind the leaders), a failure to start (engine trouble in 1968), and a disqualification (1969).

Despite the brief duration of his Formula One career, Pease was highly successful in domestic Canadian motorsport competitions, and was inducted as a member of the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame in 1998.

He died on 4 May 2014 at his home in Tennessee.

<text>Alan Brinley Rees (12 January 1938 – 6 September 2024) was a British racing driver. He participated in three World Championship Grands Prix in the 1960s, although two of those appearances were driving Formula 2 cars. He scored no championship points. His best result was seventh place (second in the Formula Two class) in the 1967 German Grand Prix.

Rees drove for the works Lotus Formula Junior team in 1962, and won three races before a crash at the Nürburgring 1000 km sports car race ended his season. From 1963 to 1968, he drove for the Roy Winklemann Racing team in Formula Two and frequently achieved victories over experienced drivers such as Jackie Stewart and Jochen Rindt.

==Background==
Rees was born in Langstone, Newport, Monmouthshire, Wales on 12 January 1938.

Rees died in Ascot, Berkshire on 6 September 2024 at the age of 86. His death was announced via Facebook by his son, racing driver and television presenter Paul Rees.

==Formula One team management==
In 1969 Rees co-founded March Engineering; his initials being the &quot;AR&quot; in &quot;March&quot;, alongside Max Mosley, Graham Coaker and Robin Herd. At the end of 1971 he moved to a Shadow Racing Cars where he became team principal. In 1977 he left Shadow to co-found Arrows. In 1996 he and the other remaining founders sold Arrows to Tom Walkinshaw. Following the death of Max Mosley in 2021, he became the sole surviving March co-founder.

<doc id="1226978" wikidata="Q8041563" url="?curid=1226978" title="X-machine">
<text>The X-machine (&quot;XM&quot;) is a theoretical model of computation introduced by Samuel Eilenberg in 1974.
The &quot;X&quot; in &quot;X-machine&quot; represents the fundamental data type on which the machine operates; for example, a machine that operates on databases (objects of type &quot;database&quot;) would be a &quot;database&quot;-machine. The X-machine model is structurally the same as the finite-state machine, except that the symbols used to label the machine&#x27;s transitions denote relations of type &quot;X&quot;→&quot;X&quot;. Crossing a transition is equivalent to applying the relation that labels it (computing a set of changes to the data type &quot;X&quot;), and traversing a path in the machine corresponds to applying all the associated relations, one after the other.

== Original theory ==
Eilenberg&#x27;s original X-machine was a completely general theoretical model of computation (subsuming the Turing machine, for example), which admitted deterministic, non-deterministic and non-terminating computations. His seminal work published many variants of the basic X-machine model, each of which generalized the finite-state machine in a slightly different way.

In the most general model, an X-machine is essentially a &quot;machine for manipulating objects of type X&quot;. Suppose that X is some datatype, called the &quot;fundamental datatype&quot;, and that Φ is a set of (partial) relations φ: X → X. An X-machine is a finite-state machine whose arrows are labelled by relations in Φ. In any given state, one or more transitions may be &quot;enabled&quot; if the domain of the associated relation φi accepts (a subset of) the current values stored in X. In each cycle, all enabled transitions are assumed to be taken. Each recognised path through the machine generates a list φ1 ... φ&quot;n&quot; of relations. We call the composition φ1 ... φ&quot;n&quot; of these relations the &quot;path relation&quot; corresponding to that path. The &quot;behaviour&quot; of the X-machine is defined to be the union of all the behaviours computed by its path relations. In general, this is non-deterministic, since applying any relation computes a set of outcomes on X. In the formal model, all possible outcomes are considered together, in parallel.

For practical purposes, an X-machine should describe some finite computation. An encoding function α: Y → X converts from some &quot;input&quot; data type Y into the initial state of X, and a decoding function β: X → Z, converts back from the final state(s) of X into some &quot;output&quot; data type Z. Once the initial state of X is populated, the X-machine runs to completion, and the outputs are then observed. In general, a machine may deadlock (be blocked), or livelock (never halt), or perform one or more complete computations. For this reason, more recent research has focused on deterministic X-machines, whose behaviour can be controlled and observed more precisely.

=== Example ===
A compiler with a peep-hole optimizer can be thought of as a machine for optimizing program structure. In this Optimizer-machine, the encoding function α takes source code from the input-type Y (the program source) and loads it into the memory-type X (a parse tree). Suppose that the machine has several states, called FindIncrements, FindSubExprs and Completed. The machine starts in the initial state FindIncrements, which is linked to other states via the transitions:

 FindIncrements →DoIncrement FindIncrements
 FindIncrements →SkipIncrement FindSubExprs
 FindSubExprs →DoSubExpr FindSubExprs
 FindSubExprs →SkipSubExpr Completed

The relation DoIncrement maps a parsed subtree corresponding to &quot;x := x + 1&quot; into the optimized subtree &quot;++x&quot;. The relation DoSubExpr maps a parse tree containing multiple occurrences of the same expression &quot;x + y ... x + y&quot; into an optimized version with a local variable to store the repeated computation &quot;z := x + y; ... z ... z&quot;. These relations are only enabled if X contains the domain values (subtrees) on which they operate. The remaining relations SkipIncrement and SkipSubExpr are &quot;nullops&quot; (identity relations) enabled in the complementary cases.

So, the Optimizer-machine will run to completion, first converting trivial additions into in-place increments (while in the FindIncrements state), then it will move on to the FindSubExprs state and perform a series of common sub-expression removals, after which it will move to the final state Completed. The decoding function β will then map from the memory-type X (the optimized parse-tree) into the output-type Z (optimized machine code).

=== Convention ===
When referring to Eilenberg&#x27;s original model, &quot;X-machine&quot; is typically written with a lower-case &quot;m&quot;, because the sense is &quot;any machine for processing X&quot;. When referring to later specific models, the convention is to use a capital &quot;M&quot; as part of the proper name of that variant.

== 1980s ==
Interest in the X-machine was revived in the late 1980s by Mike Holcombe, who noticed that the model was ideal for software formal specification purposes, because it cleanly separates &quot;control flow&quot; from &quot;processing&quot;. Provided one works at a sufficiently abstract level, the control flows in a computation can usually be represented as a finite-state machine, so to complete the X-machine specification all that remains is to specify the processing associated with each of the machine&#x27;s transitions. The structural simplicity of the model makes it extremely flexible; other early illustrations of the idea included Holcombe&#x27;s specification of human-computer interfaces,
his modelling of processes in cell biochemistry,
and Stannett&#x27;s modelling of decision-making in military command systems.

== 1990s ==
X-machines have received renewed attention since the mid-1990s, when Gilbert Laycock&#x27;s deterministic Stream X-Machine was found to serve as the basis for specifying large software systems that are &quot;completely&quot; testable. Another variant,
the Communicating Stream X-Machine offers a useful testable model for biological processes 
and future &quot;swarm-based&quot; satellite systems.
== 2000s ==
X-machines have been applied to lexical semantics by András Kornai, who models word meaning by `pointed&#x27; machines that have one member of the base set X distinguished. Application to other branches of linguistics, in particular to a contemporary reformulation of Pāṇini were pioneered by Gerard Huet and his co-workers

== Major variants ==
The X-machine is rarely encountered in its original form, but underpins several subsequent models of computation. The most influential model on theories of software testing has been the Stream X-Machine. NASA has recently discussed using a combination of Communicating Stream X-Machines and the process calculus WSCSS in the design and testing of &quot;swarm satellite&quot; systems.

=== Analog X Machine (AXM) ===
The earliest variant, the continuous-time &quot;Analog X-Machine&quot; (&quot;AXM&quot;), was introduced by Mike Stannett in 1990 as a potentially &quot;super-Turing&quot; model of computation;
it is consequently related to work in hypercomputation theory.

=== Stream X-Machine (SXM) ===

The most commonly encountered X-machine variant is Gilbert Laycock&#x27;s 1993 &quot;Stream X-Machine&quot; (&quot;SXM&quot;) model,
which forms the basis for Mike Holcombe and Florentin Ipate&#x27;s theory of &quot;complete&quot; software testing, which guarantees known correctness properties, once testing is over. The Stream X-Machine differs from Eilenberg&#x27;s original model, in that the fundamental data type X is of the form &quot;Out&quot;* × &quot;Mem&quot; × &quot;In&quot;*, where &quot;In&quot;* is an input sequence, &quot;Out&quot;* is an output sequence, and &quot;Mem&quot; is the (rest of the) memory.

The advantage of this model is that it allows a system to be driven, one step at a time, through its states and transitions, while observing the outputs at each step. These are witness values, that guarantee that particular functions were executed on each step. As a result, complex software systems may be decomposed into a hierarchy of Stream X-Machines, designed in a top-down way and tested in a bottom-up way. This divide-and-conquer approach to design and testing is backed by Florentin Ipate&#x27;s proof of correct integration, which proves how testing the layered machines independently is equivalent to testing the composed system.

=== Communicating X-Machine (CXM) ===
The earliest proposal for connecting several X-machines in parallel is Judith Barnard&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Communicating X-machine&quot; (&quot;CXM&quot; or &quot;COMX&quot;) model,
in which machines are connected via named communication channels (known as &quot;ports&quot;); this model exists in both discrete- and real-timed variants. Earlier versions of this work were not fully formal and did not show full input/output relations.

A similar Communicating X-Machine approach using buffered
channels was developed by Petros Kefalas. The focus of this work was on expressiveness in the composition of components. The ability to reassign channels meant that some of the testing theorems from Stream X-Machines did not carry over.

These variants are discussed in more detail on a separate page.

=== Communicating Stream X-Machine (CSXM) ===
The first fully formal model of concurrent X-machine composition was proposed in 1999 by Cristina Vertan and Horia Georgescu, based on earlier work on communicating automatata by Philip Bird and Anthony Cowling. In Vertan&#x27;s model, the machines communicate indirectly, via a shared &quot;communication matrix&quot; (essentially an array of pigeonholes), rather than directly via shared channels.

Bălănescu, Cowling, Georgescu, Vertan and others have studied the formal properties of this CSXM model in some detail. Full input/output relations can be shown. The &quot;communication matrix&quot; establishes a protocol for synchronous communication. The advantage of this is that it decouples each machine&#x27;s processing from their communication, allowing the separate testing of each behaviour. This compositional model was proven equivalent to a standard Stream X-Machine, so leveraging the earlier testing theory developed by Holcombe and Ipate.

This X-machine variant is discussed in more detail on a separate page.

=== Object X-Machine (OXM) ===
Kirill Bogdanov and Anthony Simons developed several variants of the X-machine to model the behaviour of objects in object-oriented systems. This model differs from the Stream X-Machine approach, in that the monolithic data type X is distributed over, and encapsulated by, several objects, which are serially composed; and systems are driven by method invocations and returns, rather than by inputs and outputs. 
Further work in this area concerned adapting the formal testing theory in the context of inheritance, which partitions the state-space of the superclass in extended subclass objects.

A &quot;CCS-augmented X-machine&quot; (CCSXM) model was later developed by Simons and Stannett in 2002 to support complete behavioural testing of object-oriented systems, in the presence of asynchronous communication This is expected to bear some similarity with NASA&#x27;s recent proposal; but no definitive comparison of the two models has as yet been conducted.

<doc id="1226979" wikidata="Q818534" url="?curid=1226979" title="Benzyl group">
<text>In organic chemistry, benzyl is the substituent or molecular fragment possessing the structure . Benzyl features a benzene ring () attached to a methylene group ().

==Nomenclature==
In IUPAC nomenclature, the prefix benzyl refers to a substituent, for example benzyl chloride or benzyl benzoate. Benzyl is not to be confused with phenyl with the formula . 
The term benzylic is used to describe the position of the first carbon bonded to a benzene or other aromatic ring. For example, is referred to as a &quot;benzylic&quot; carbocation. The benzyl free radical has the formula . The benzyl cation or phenylcarbenium ion is the carbocation with formula ; the benzyl anion or phenylmethanide ion is the carbanion with the formula . None of these species can be formed in significant amounts in the solution phase under normal conditions, but they are useful referents for discussion of reaction mechanisms and may exist as reactive intermediates.

===Abbreviations===
Benzyl is most commonly abbreviated Bn. For example, benzyl alcohol can be represented as BnOH. Less common abbreviations are Bzl and Bz, the latter of which is ambiguous as it is also the standard abbreviation for the benzoyl group . Likewise, benzyl should not be confused with the phenyl group , abbreviated Ph.

==Reactivity of benzylic centers==
The enhanced reactivity of benzylic positions is attributed to the low bond dissociation energy for benzylic C−H bonds. Specifically, the bond is about 10–15% weaker than other kinds of C−H bonds. The neighboring aromatic ring stabilizes benzyl radicals. The data tabulated below compare benzylic C−H bond to related C−H bond strengths.
The weakness of the C−H bond reflects the stability of the benzylic radical. For related reasons, benzylic substituents exhibit enhanced reactivity, as in oxidation, free radical halogenation, or hydrogenolysis. As a practical example, in the presence of suitable catalysts, &quot;p&quot;-xylene oxidizes exclusively at the benzylic positions to give terephthalic acid:
:&lt;chem&gt;CH3C6H4CH3 + 3 O2 -&gt; HO2CC6H4CO2H + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
Millions of tonnes of terephthalic acid are produced annually by this method.

=== Functionalization at the benzylic position ===
In a few cases, these benzylic transformations occur under conditions suitable for lab synthesis. The Wohl-Ziegler reaction will brominate a benzylic C–H bond: (). Any non-tertiary benzylic alkyl group will be oxidized to a carboxyl group by aqueous potassium permanganate () or concentrated nitric acid (): (). Finally, the complex of chromium trioxide and 3,5-dimethylpyrazole () will selectively oxidize a benzylic methylene group to a carbonyl: (). 2-iodoxybenzoic acid in DMSO performs similarly.

==As a protecting group==
Benzyl groups are occasionally employed as protecting groups in organic synthesis. Their installation and especially their removal require relatively harsh conditions, so benzyl is not typically preferred for protection.
=== Alcohol protection ===
Benzyl is commonly used in organic synthesis as a robust protecting group for alcohols and carboxylic acids.

* Treatment of alcohol with a strong base such as powdered potassium hydroxide or sodium hydride and benzyl halide (BnCl or BnBr)
* Monobenzylation of diols can be achieved using Ag2O in dimethylformamide (DMF) at ambient to elevated temperatures
* Primary alcohols can be selectively benzylated in presence of phenol functional groups using Cu(acac)2

===Deprotection methods ===
Benzyl ethers can be removed under &quot;reductive conditions&quot;, &quot;oxidative conditions&quot;, and the use of &quot;Lewis acids&quot;.

* Removed using hydrogenolysis
* Single electron process with Na/NH3 or Li/NH3

* Benzyl protecting groups can be removed using a wide range of oxidizing agents including:
** CrO3/acetic acid at ambient temperature
** Ozone
** &quot;N&quot;-Bromosuccinimide (NBS)
** &quot;N&quot;-Iodosuccinimide (NIS)

* Trimethylsilyl iodide (Me3SiI) in dichloromethane at ambient temperature (selectivity can be achieved under specific conditions)

===The &quot;p&quot;-methoxybenzyl protecting group===
&quot;p&quot;-Methoxybenzyl (PMB) is used as a protecting group for alcohols in organic synthesis (4-Methoxybenzylthiol is used to protect thiols).
* Strong base such as powdered potassium hydroxide or sodium hydride and &quot;p&quot;-methoxybenzyl halide (chloride or bromide)
* 4-methoxybenzyl-2,2,2-trichloroacetimidate can be used to install the PMB group in presence of:
**Scandium (III) triflate (Sc(OTf)3) in toluene at 0 °C
** Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH) in dichloromethane at 0 °C

==== Deprotection methods ====
* 2,3-Dichloro-5,6-dicyano-&quot;p&quot;-benzoquinone (DDQ)
* Conditions for deprotection of benzyl group are applicable for cleavage of the PMB protecting group

=== Amine protection ===
The benzyl group is occasionally used as a protecting group for amines in organic synthesis. Other methods exist.

* Aqueous potassium carbonate and benzyl halide (BnCl, BnBr) in methanol
* Benzaldehyde, 6 M HCl and NaBH3CN in methanol

====Deprotection methods ====
* Hydrogenation in the presence of the palladium catalyst

<doc id="1226985" wikidata="Q821932" url="?curid=1226985" title="Stretton, Rutland">
<text>Stretton is a village and civil parish in the county of Rutland, England, just off the A1 Great North Road. The population of the civil parish was 770 at the 2001 census, including Thistleton and increasing to 1,260 at the 2011 census. The ecclesiastical parish of Stretton shares the same boundaries and is part of the Rutland deanery of the diocese of Peterborough.

==Geography==

The principal landmark is a large modern prison, HMP Stocken. Stocken Hall itself, dating principally from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, was used as the prison farm from the 1950s until the 1980s and is now converted into apartments. Of the seventeen Strettons in England, all but two are on Roman roads, and Stretton in Rutland is no exception, being situated on Ermine Street. 

The civil parish extends along the east side of the A1 up to the edge of Morkery Wood. It also extends at this point to the west side of the A1, as far south as Hooby Lane, and includes Hooby Lodge.

The B668 (for Oakham) meets the A1 at a junction, improved in 1971 when the A1 was dualled to Great Casterton.

==History==
The village&#x27;s name means &quot;farm/settlement on a Roman Road&quot; in Anglian and Old English. The village is situated on Ermine Street.

The pub is called the Jackson Stops (the name of an estate agent). It was previously called the &quot;White Horse&quot; but was for sale for so long with the estate agents&#x27; sign outside that it is now officially called by their name.

The &quot;Ram Jam Inn&quot; (former Winchelsea Arms), situated on the Great North Road next to a service station, is just inside the parish of Greetham. It was bought by the then-owner of Stocken Hall, Major Charles Fleetwood-Hesketh (1871–1947), in the 1920s, who transformed it into a well-known roadside inn. He was also a Deputy Lieutenant of Lancashire, as was his son, Roger Fleetwood-Hesketh, who became a Conservative MP.

Geno Washington &amp; the Ram Jam Band took their name from the inn in the 1960s. Also in the parish of Greetham is the former &quot;Greetham Inn&quot; (previously the &quot;New Inn&quot;).

The parish church is dedicated to St Nicholas. Rev. Edward Bradley (rector of Stretton, 1871–83), who wrote as Cuthbert Bede, and who paid for its restoration, is buried in the churchyard.

<doc id="1226987" wikidata="Q219854" url="?curid=1226987" title="Philippines national football team">
<text>The Philippines national football team () represents the Philippines in men&#x27;s international football, governed by the Philippine Football Federation (PFF) and has been playing internationally since 1913.

Prior to World War II, the Philippines had regularly competed with Japan and the Republic of China in the Far Eastern Championship Games. So far, the national team has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup and has qualified for the AFC Asian Cup only once, in 2019. They finished second at the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup after losing to Palestine in the final.

Unlike most of Southeast Asia where football is the most popular sport, the Philippines&#x27; most popular sports are basketball and boxing, inherited from American rule. Often, the Philippines would suffer group stage eliminations at the AFF Championship.

However, since the 2010 AFF Championship, the country has attempted to develop football as part of the sport&#x27;s renaissance, finding more incentives to increase football development and fan support.

==History==
===1910s–1940s: Early years===

The Philippines participated in the Far Eastern Championship Games, which included football. The first edition was in 1913 and the last was in 1934. The games were the first regional football tournament for national teams outside the British Home Championship. The national team routinely faced Japan and China and at one edition the Dutch East Indies at the games. The Philippines won over China at the inaugural tournament with a scoreline of 2–1. During the 1917 edition, the national team achieved its biggest win in international football. Led by Filipino-Spanish icon Paulino Alcantara, the Philippines defeated Japan 15–2.

After the dissolution of the Far Eastern Championship Games, the national squad participated in the 1940 East Asian Games organized to commemorate the 2600th anniversary of the foundation of the Empire of Japan by Emperor Jimmu. The team finished third behind champions Japan and second placers Manchukuo, and ahead of the Republic of China.

===1950s–1990s: Decline of football===
In the 1950s the Philippines hosted friendlies with international-based sides, However, the national team experienced lack of funding and barely received any coverage from the media. During that time talents from the national team were drawn from the Manila Football League which received substantial support from the Chinese-Filipino community. The national team&#x27;s decent performance at the 1958 Asian Games, hosted in Tokyo, where they defeated Japan 1–0, was labeled as an upset by the Japanese press.

The years following 1958 saw the decline of Philippine football, as several key players resigned from the national team due to financial challenges for playing. National team players Ed Ocampo and Eduardo Pacheco switched to basketball, and went on playing for commercial basketball clubs where players are paid. The Philippine Congress passed Republic Act 3135 that revised the charter of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation, which had a provision, or a 60-40 rule, that mandated teams to not have more than 40 percent Chinese and other players with foreign blood. Sponsors withdrew and leagues, which were mostly funded by the Chinese-Filipino community, started to decline. The 60–40 rule was lifted much later during the tenure of president Johnny Romualdez of the Philippine Football Federation (PFF), after 1982 when the PFA had reorganized itself as the PFF.

The national team suffered defeats with big margins at the 1962 Asian Games in Jakarta. This includes the national team&#x27;s record 15–1 defeat to Malaysia, which became the worst defeat of the national team at that time. The record was later broken by the 15–0 loss to Japan in 1967 at the qualifiers for the 1968 Summer Olympics. Foreigners were hired to serve as head coaches for the national team in an attempt to reduce big margin loses. Englishman Allan Rogers was hired following the record defeat to Malaysia, and Spaniard Juan Cutillas was likewise tasked to lead the national team following the record defeat to Japan.

In the early sixties, the Philippine Football Association partnered with the San Miguel Corporation to seek foreign assistance to train local football players and coaches and to develop the sport in the country. These included Alan Rogers and Brian Birch, coaches from the United Kingdom. After the two were relieved, Danny McClellan and Graham Adams continued their task. In 1961, San Miguel, through the national football association, brought in four medical students from Spain who were experts in football — Francisco Escarte, Enrique dela Mata, Claudio Sanchez and Juan Cutillas. Escarte and dela Mata left the country after one year.

In 1971, head coach Juan Cutillas recruited five foreign players to play for the national team: four Spaniards and one Chinese. The national team joined several international competitions such as the Merdeka Tournament, Jakarta Anniversary Tournament and the President Park Tournament. The team caused some upset results against the national teams of Thailand, Singapore and South Korea. The national team saw another decline after the four Spanish players left the team due to financial reasons and basketball gained more foothold over football in the country.

The national team under German head coach Eckhard Krautzun finished fourth overall at the 1991 Southeast Asian Games, its best ever finish at the tournament. The Philippines dealt a 1–0 defeat to defending champions Malaysia at the tournament which knocked out the latter out of the tournament at just the group stage. Norman Fegidero scored the sole goal for the Philippines.

=== 2000s ===
In September 2006, the country fell to 195th on the FIFA World Rankings, its lowest ever. By the end of the year, the Philippines moved back up to 171st overall, after a good run in the 2007 AFF Championship qualification. They were able to win three games in a row, which was a first for the Philippines and thus qualifying for the 2007 AFF Championship. Coach at that time Aris Caslib, aimed to reach the semifinals with two wins at the group stage. The decision came despite Philippine Football Federation president Juan Miguel Romualdez stating that they would still be underdogs in the tournament and that they should not raise their expectations too high, as the Philippines have only gotten their first ever win of the tournament during the 2004 AFF Championship.

The Philippines eventually failed to reach their target, only getting a draw in three matches. Their poor performances led to Caslib&#x27;s resignation, as well as the refusal of the PFF to register and enter the qualification stages for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. They would be one of four nations, all from Southeast Asia, not to enter after a record number of entries. However, it was revealed that the decision not to enter the 2010, as well as the 2006 World Cup qualification, was made during the PFF presidency of Rene Adad, whose term ended in 2003. Instead, the PFF wanted to focus on domestic and regional competitions.

The Philippines failed to qualify for any major competition in 2008. They missed out on the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup only on goal difference, and the 2008 AFF Championship with an inferior goals scored record.

Dan Palami, businessman and sports patron, was appointed as team manager of the national team in 2009 by the Philippine Football Federation. The national team still received minimal support from the government. Palami made financial investments into the team using his own personal money. Since taking responsibility over the national team, he envisioned a plan named Project 100, which aimed to make the team among the top 100 national teams in the world in terms of FIFA rankings. More foreign-born Filipinos were called up to play for the national squad.

===2010s: Era of renaissance===

The Philippines&#x27;s campaign at the 2010 AFF Championship under Simon McMenemy&#x27;s tenure was a breakthrough. Holding a primal ticket as one of two teams along with Laos that had to qualify for the tournament, the Philippines advanced from the group stage for the first time, did not concede a single defeat, and their win against defending champions Vietnam in particular was considered one of the biggest upsets in the tournament&#x27;s history. The match, which would later be referred by local Filipino fans as the &quot;Miracle of Hanoi&quot;, is also considered the match that started a football renaissance in the country where basketball is the more popular sport. In the knockout stage, they had to play both their designated home and away games against Indonesia in Jakarta due to the unavailability of a stadium that passes AFF standards. The Philippines lost both games to end their campaign.

The following year, Michael Weiß became the head coach. The national team managed to qualify for the 2012 edition of the AFC Challenge Cup, the first time since qualifiers were introduced and also recorded their first ever victory in the FIFA World Cup qualification, beating Sri Lanka 4–0 in the second leg of the first preliminary round. Kuwait finished the Philippines&#x27; World Cup qualification campaign after winning over them twice in the second round.

In 2012, the Philippines qualified for the semifinals of the AFC Challenge Cup for the first time winning over former champions India and Tajikistan, though they lost 2–1 against Turkmenistan in the semifinal. In the third place-playoff the Philippines won 4–3 over Palestine. The Philippines won the 2012 Philippine Peace Cup, a friendly tournament hosted at home, which was their first title since the 1913 Far Eastern Games. At the 2012 AFF Championship, the Philippines replicated their performance in 2010 by advancing to the semifinal. They lost to Singapore on aggregate by a single goal in the two-legged semifinal.

The Philippines reached the final of the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup. With a berth to the 2015 AFC Asian Cup on the line, the Philippines lost to Palestine 1–0 on May 30. The Philippines once again advanced from the group stage at the 2014 AFF Championship by winning over Indonesia, the first time since the 1934 Far Eastern Games, and Laos despite their loss to Vietnam. The Philippines faced Thailand in the two-legged semifinal, coming up with a goalless draw against their opponents at home in Manila but losing the away match at Bangkok.

Thomas Dooley became the head coach of the national team. In October 2015 their 2–0 victory over Yemen in Doha, Qatar in the 2018 FIFA World Cup and 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers was their first-ever World Cup qualifier victory away from home. Their campaign to qualify for the FIFA World Cup ended in the second round though they advance to the third round of the Asian Cup qualifiers.

In late 2016 the Philippines jointly hosted the group stage of the AFF Championship with Myanmar though they fail to progress from the group stage like they did in the past three editions.Though the national team failed to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, they secured qualification for 2019 AFC Asian Cup after defeating Tajikistan, 2–1 at home in their final qualifier match. In May 2018, the national team reached 111th rank in the FIFA World Ranking making it the highest rank that the team has.
The Philippines made its historic debut in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup with a 0–1 defeat to South Korea. then a 0–3 loss to China and was edged 1–3 by Kyrgyzstan, with Stephan Schröck scoring a historic goal for the Azkals in the tournament.

===2020–&quot;present&quot;===
Following a relatively successful debut in the Asian Cup, the Philippines began their 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification where they were grouped together with Syria, China, Guam and Maldives. In their opening game, the Azkals met Syria at home and took an early lead, only to see the Syrians manage an outstanding comeback and smash the Azkals 5–2 in Bacolod. Following the crushing home defeat, the Pinoys regained its pace with two away wins over Guam and the Maldives. Between these matches, the Pinoys also hosted China at home where they acquired an encouraging goalless draw, after a splendid performance by the Azkals goalkeeper Neil Etheridge which increased the team&#x27;s chance. However, the Syrians once again blew the chance of the Filipinos, with the Syrians emerging with a 1–0 win over the Azkals. When COVID-19 pandemic led the games to be postponed to 2021, the Philippines had to play in a centralised venue in Sharjah. The Filipinos then won against Guam 3–0, but lost 0–2 to China and thus did not manage to reach the 2022 FIFA World Cup, before ending the qualification with a 1–1 draw to the Maldives. Nonetheless, the third place in their group meant the Philippines qualified for the third round of 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers.

At the third round of the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers in Ulaanbaatar, the Philippines managed to draw with Yemen 0–0 and defeat the hosts Mongolia 1–0 through a last-minute goal by debutant Gerrit Holtmann but were defeated 4–0 by eventual group winners Palestine. Despite finishing second in Group B, in which the five best runner-up teams across all the groups qualify for the tournament, the Azkals failed to qualify for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup after finishing as the worst runner-up.

Philippines then played in the second round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification being place alongside Iraq and two regional rivals, Indonesia and Vietnam. The team the finished last in the table with 1 draw against Indonesia on November 21, 2023, and 5 losses.

Long-time general manager, Dan Palami stepped down from his role in January 2024. In 2024, Philippines was invited by Malaysia for the 2024 Merdeka Tournament in September and Thailand for the 2024 King&#x27;s Cup in October. Philippines then played in the 2024 ASEAN Championship drawing 1–1 all their first group stage match against Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam. Needing a win in their final group stage fixtures against Indonesia, against all odds, Philippines went on to win 1–0 after Bjørn Martin Kristensen scored from the penalty spot to secure a spot in the semi-finals where the team didn&#x27;t lose a game in the group stage. During the first leg of the semi-finals match on December 27 against Thailand, with the match coming to an end, Kike Linares scored in the 90+5&#x27; stoppage time header to secured a 2–1 win which then see Philippines beating Thailand for the first time in 52 years.

===Supporters===
Some fans have organized themselves to support the national team, one of them is the Ultras Filipinas, which formed in 2011. The Kaholeros started out as a gathering of friends using Twitter calling for fans to watch games of the AFC Challenge Cup at the National Sports Grill in Greenbelt. The &#x27;Ultras Filipinas&#x27; was established when fans of Philippine Air Force and &#x27;Ultras Kayas&#x27; decided to form a support group for the national teams of the Philippines not necessarily just for the football team. The first outing of Ultras Filipinas was not for the national football team but for the national rugby union team. The two fan groups take alternative turns in cheering and chanting for the national team during games.

===Colors===
The traditional home kit is similar to the France national team; blue jersey, white shorts, and red socks. However, in recent times, the home and away kit has either been all-blue, all-red or all-white, currently is the all-white as home jerseys. The current kit supplier of the national team is German sportswear Puma. Adidas, as well as Japanese company Mizuno, has provided kits for the team in the past.

Puma was the official outfitter of the national team during the 1996 AFC Asian Cup qualification. Later that year, Adidas assumed that role and outfitted the team that participated at the 1996 Tiger Cup.

For three years from March 2008, Mizuno served as the official outfitter and equipment supplier of the team. It also helped the national federation in its grassroots development program. On June 4, 2012, Puma supplanted Mizuno&#x27;s role with the national team.

Local firm LGR Sportswear became the official kit provider of the national team in 2015 and a new set of kits made by LGR were unveiled to the public on June 5 which was later used by the team at the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. The home and away kits were white and blue respectively. Filipino weave design and the three stars and the sun are present at the back of the home and away kits. The goalkeeper&#x27;s kit is black and has a yellow trim on the chest area and a weave pattern with the three stars and the sun and Azkals logo incorporated in the design, in front around the shoulder area. Adidas was also announced as the footwear sponsor of the team for the qualifiers.

Spanish sportswear brand Kelme became the official kit provider of the national team in 2021.

In June 2022, the team used Chronos Athletics-made kits when they competed in the third round of the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers in Mongolia. It was later explained that the Kelme kits they were supposed to wear arrived late.

Following Kelme&#x27;s deal with the Philippines expiring in January 2023, local sportswear brand Chronos Athletics finally became the Philippines&#x27; new kit supplier. In March 2023, following a TikTok video that went viral, presenting a concept shirt for the Philippines. The management then decided to acquire the design made by JerseyBird, a small US-based sportswear brand. Chronos Athletics remained as the kit supplier, with both sides agreed to retain the JerseyBird logo on the kits and to be distributed under a subsidiary brand, Azkals Sportswear.

In the recent 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Iraq, the Philippines were seen wearing a new kit design supplied by Puma. On May 3, 2024, Philippines announced a four-year partnership with Puma until 2028.

===Names===

Under the official FIFA Trigramme the team&#x27;s name is abbreviated as PHI; this acronym is used by FIFA, the AFC and the AFF to identify the team in official competitions. The team is also identified under the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) country code for the Philippines as PHL. However the team was more commonly known as the RP, the acronym for the country&#x27;s official name, &quot;Republika ng Pilipinas&quot;, which the local press used when they referred to the team as the &quot;RP Booters&quot; or the &quot;RP XI&quot;. This was until late October 2010 when the Department of Foreign Affairs decided to change the official abbreviation of the country from &quot;RP&quot; to &quot;PH&quot; or &quot;PHL&quot;, to be in line with ISO standards. The local press have since referred to the team as either &quot;PH/PHL Booters&quot; or &quot;PH/PHL XI&quot;.

They were also known as the &quot;Tri–Stars,&quot; which was derived from the three stars on the Philippine flag, although this nickname was not frequently used.

The national team was referred to as the &quot;Azkals&quot;. The name was coined when an online Philippine football community proposed the nickname &quot;Calle Azul&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Streets of Blue&quot;, referring to the color of their kit) which was modified to &quot;Azul Calle&quot;, shortened to &quot;AzCal&quot;, and finally became &quot;Azkal&quot; – a word that is similar to Filipino term &quot;Askal&quot; meaning street dog. &quot;Azkals&quot; became a trending topic on Twitter during the semifinals of the 2010 AFF Championship. The name would be officially adopted by the PFF during the tenure of general team manager Dan Palami until 2023. Its discontinuation of its use by the federation was confirmed in February 2024. The Azkals name would be adopted by an independent 7-a-side club in 2024 competing in the 7&#x27;s Football League led by Palami and former national team players. There are no serious efforts to replace the &quot;Azkals&quot; moniker as of December 2024.

===Home stadium===
During the early years of the Philippine national team, they played their home matches at the Manila Carnival Grounds. By 1934 it became the site of the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex. One of the facilities within the complex is the 12,000 capacity national stadium, known as the Rizal Memorial Track and Football Stadium or simply the Rizal Memorial Stadium. Since its opening, it has been the home venue of the Philippine national team until May 2015 when they declared the 25,000 seater and Philippine Sports Stadium in Bocaue, Bulacan as their new home. However, due to disappointing attendance numbers in PSS and RMS and an impressive crowd for Ceres–Negros&#x27;s run to the 2017 AFC Cup, the Philippine Football Federation decided to make Panaad Stadium the national team&#x27;s home again for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers.

The RMS has also become a hub for track and field. The continued use for athletics along with poor maintenance has deteriorated the stadium and the 1991 Southeast Asian Games was the last time it was used for international football matches.vIn early 2009, the Philippine Sports Commission planned to transform it to a modern football stadium which would make it usable by the national team for international matches.

The national team also held official international matches at the Cebu City Sports Center in Cebu City, and at the Barotac Nuevo Plaza Field in Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo.

<text>Narayanrao (10 August 1755 – 30 August 1773) was the 10th Peshwa of the Maratha Confederacy from November 1772 until his assassination in August 1773. He married Gangabai Sathe who later gave birth to Sawai Madhavrao.

==Early life==
Narayanrao Bhat was born 10 August 1755. He was the third and youngest son of Balaji Baji Rao (also known as Nana Saheb) and his wife Gopikabai. He received a conventional education in reading, writing and arithmetic and possessed a functional understanding of Sanskrit scriptures. He was married to Gangabai Sathe on 18 April 1763 before his eighth birthday. Gangabai was born in Kelashi village and belonged to Sathe family . Her father&#x27;s name is not known, but Keshav Vinayak Sathe was the family head. Sathe&#x27;s were the dashagranthi Brahmins and were serving as priests of Kelashi&#x27;s Mahalakshmi. Ruins of Gangabai&#x27;s house are still present in Kelshi village near a small Datta Mandir. He was very close to Parvatibai, the widow of Sadashivrao, who took him under her care to lessen her sorrows after her husband&#x27;s death. His eldest brother Vishwasrao, heir to the title of the Peshwa, died in the Battle of Panipat in 1761 along with Sadashivrao. His father died a few months later and his elder brother Madhavrao took over as Peshwa.

He accompanied his brother Madhavrao in his expeditions to Carnatic on two occasions, once in 1765 and later in 1769. He received a wound in his wrist at the storming of fort Nijagal at the end of April 1770. In last one or two years of his brother&#x27;s reign, he was placed in the care of the Maratha minister Sakharam Bapu in order to train him in his administrative work. His behaviour and performance of his duties always failed to impress his brother Madhavrao who expressed great fears about his future.

== Ascension ==

Before his death, Madhavrao conducted a court session in which the issue of ascension was discussed at length and at the end of which, in the presence of the family deity, he nominated his younger brother Narayanrao as the next Peshwa. He counseled Narayanrao to conduct his administration by the advice of Sakharam Bapu and Nana Padnavis. Raghunathrao, the uncle of both Madhavrao and Narayanrao, didn&#x27;t have the courage to openly oppose the nomination of Narayanrao in front of the dying Peshwa and so he apparently acquiesced to the arrangement. The Peshwa had also ordered in writing that Raghunathrao was to continue his confinement so as to prevent him from engaging in mischief. Raghunathrao attempted an escape shortly before the Peshwa&#x27;s death but was immediately caught and put back into confinement.

Madhavrao finally died on 18 November 1772. His funeral rites were conducted at Theur and the court returned to Pune on 2 December. Narayanrao prepared to set off for Satara in order to receive his robes from Rajaram II. Before he could leave, his uncle Raghunathrao demanded to accompany him to Satara unless he was granted an independent fief of 25 lakhs annually for him and his family. But Raghunathrao was persuaded to give up his demands. And so Narayanrao went to Satara and received his robes from Rajaram II on 13 December. At the same time, Sakharam Bapu took his role as Karbhari (&quot;Chief Administrator&quot;) and other officials confirmed their respective posts.

== Reign ==

=== Alienation of various groups ===

==== Gardis ====
The Peshwas employed Gardi soldiers for police duty around the palace and the city of Pune. The Gardis were less than 5000 strong and were mostly composed of North Indians, Pathans, Ethiopians, Arabs, Rajputs and Purbiyas. Their monthly salary ranged somewhere between Rs. 8 and Rs. 15. According to French military leader and administrator Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau, the Gardis saw their role in purely commercial terms and had no personal attachment to their employer. The new Narayanrao inherited an empty treasury from his brother. Madhavrao had lost all the wealth he had accumulated over the years in paying off the empire&#x27;s debts and had failed to bring funds in the last few years of life due to his illness. On top of that, with Ibrahim Khan Gardi and Marquis de Bussy gone, the Gardis no longer had an overarching leader to keep them disciplined. The unpaid and disorganised Gardis had now become a liability for the Marathas but neither Peshwa nor his advisors paid much attention to the pressing issue.

==== Prabhus ====

The Prabhus were an influential community in the Maratha empire. They claimed to be belonging to the Kshatriya (&quot;warrior&quot;) caste which gave them the right to perform religious functions through the use of Vedic chants. A dispute over their caste status had occurred in the late 17th century but it was virtually resolved after the founder of the Maratha empire Shivaji and his confidential secretary Balaji Avji Chitnis, a Prabhus by caste, performed the sacred thread ceremony of their sons at the same time by using Vedic chants under the direction of the celebrated Brahmin scholar Gaga Bhatt. This created a precedent that allowed the Prabhus to hold on to their Kshatriya status without interference from orthodox Brahmins. But then Narayanrao decided to take up the cause of the orthodoxy and, likely under the impression from Nana Phadnavis, reduced their caste status from that of Kshatriya (&quot;warrior&quot;) to that of Shudra (&quot;servant&quot;). Prominent leaders of the Prabhu community were called together and under severe torture, including starvation, forced to give up their caste status. They were compelled to sign an agreement of nine specific articles, according to which they would give up Kshatriya status and accept Shudra status. This action on the part of Narayanrao lost him the support of an influential community who later supported Raghunathrao.

==== Sakharam Bapu ====
Sakharam Bapu&#x27;s policy which favoured compromise over radicalism was at odds with the rash and irritable behaviour of Narayanrao. The differences between the two quickly came to light during the appointment of the governorship of Vasai. The position had previously been held for a long time by a soldier and diplomat named Visajipant Lele. Sakharam Bapu held him in high regard because he had faithfully served him in several awkward situations that required mutual support. But Visajipant Lele was a corrupt official whose ill deeds were long known to Madhavrao. During the last days of his tenure, Madhavrao dismissed Visajipanth Lele after he misappropriated government property worth 20 lakhs. So when Narayanrao became Peshwa, Visajipanth Lele requested the new Peshwa to reappoint him as the Governor of Vasai. His request was supported by Sakharam Bapu but Narayanrao rejected Bapu&#x27;s advice and appointed Trimbak Vinayak instead.

Narayanrao and Sakharam Bapu also disagreed on the issue of the Patwardhan Sardars. The Patwardhan Sardars had gained enormous power through their loyal service to the late Peshwa which irked Sakharam Bapu and Raghunathrao who took certain steps to lower their prestige, much to the displeasure of Narayanrao. Since the differences between Narayanrao and Sakharam Bapu were growing they decide to consult the opinions of Gopikabai, the widow of Balaji Rao and the eldest member of the family. And so Narayanrao, Sakharam Bapu and Vamanrao Patwardhan, the leading of the Patwardhan family, repaired to Gangapur in the middle of March 1773 to meet and ask for her advice. They spent a few days in frank discussion but could not arrive at any definite resolution.

==== Other Maratha officials ====

The courtiers at Pune had very negative opinions of the new Peshwa whom they described as impatient, irritable, facetious, gullible and immature person who refused to follow the guidance of Sakharam Bapu. Narayanrao had started imitating the manners and behaviour of his elder brother Madhavrao and had openly disrespected Sakharam Bapu and other elderly officials on several occasions. Nana Phadnavis kept himself aloof due to lack of confidence shown towards him. Unlike his senior colleague Sakharam Bapu, he only involved himself with the administration when absolutely necessary. This explains why Nana Phadnavis did not notice the talks of intrigues and plots taking place in the city. Moroba Phadnavis was another member of the executive government who shared the attitutde of indifference towards the Peshwa. The same was true for the Maratha general Haripant Phadke.

=== Confinement of Raghunathrao ===

==== First attempt to escape ====
Narayanrao&#x27;s relationship with his uncle Raghunathrao was cordial at the beginning. When Raghunathrao&#x27;s daughter Durgabai was about to get married, Narayanrao made the arrangements for the marriage which took place on 7 February 1773. But later when Narayanrao was at Nashik, Raghunathrao tried to take advantage of the Peshwa&#x27;s absence and plotted his escape. Raghunathrao began to enlist his own troops and wrote to Haidar Ali for support. Naro Appaji, the Maratha officer incharge for law and order in Pune, heightened the security around Raghunathrao by placing guards to watch all the exits of the palace and the city. Raghunathrao pitched his tents outside and declared that he was going on an expedition.

As soon as this news reached Narayanrao he returned to Pune and found Raghunathrao in his tents. He brought him back to the palace on 11 April 1773 and placed additional guards to prevent his escape. This further strained the relationship between Narayanrao and Raghunathrao. In July 1773, Raghunathrao become so exasperated with the restrictions imposed on him that he threatened to starve himself, his wife and his adopted son to death. Narayanrao failed to sooth things over by compromise. He had no advisors whom he could trust upon at this point.

==== Second attempt to escape ====
Two agents from Nagpur had been dispatched to Pune to request the Peshwa&#x27;s confirmation for making Raghuji Bhonsle, the son of Mudhoji Bhonsle, the ruler of Nagpur in order to put the succession dispute between Mudhoji and his brother Sabaji to an end. But when the two agents arrived at Pune in the summer of 1773 and discovered the tensions between Narayanrao and Raghunathrao, they realised they had much to benefit from the chaos. At the same time Narayanrao continued supporting the claim of Sabaji and sent armed reinforcements under Khanderao Darekar to support him against his brother. This caught the ire of Mudhoji who vaguely told his agents to do whatever they deemed necessary for accomplishing their mission by supporting Raghunathrao&#x27;s power.

But the agents needed to have a discussion with Raghunathrao before they could formulate a plan. Raghunathrao was in strict confinement at the time and so they approached Sakharam Hari Gupte, a strong partisan of Raghunathrao who had also been incensed by the Peshwa&#x27;s decision to reduce the caste status of his community. They manage to obtain a secret meeting with Raghunathrao in which they hatch a plan which involved seizing Narayanrao and placing Raghunathrao on the throne. This would require for Raghunathrao to be free and organise an armed foce. In August 1773, during night time, Raghunathrao tried to escape using the help of Lakshman Kashi. But Raghunathrao was caught and taken into custody while Lakshman Kashi managed to escape and fled from Pune.

When news of Raghunathrao&#x27;s attempted escape reached Narayanrao he made the terms of uncle&#x27;s confinement harsher. Raghunathrao was no longer allowed to leave his room, all his essentials were delivered to him and his lavish lifestyle was curtailed. As part of his prayer, Raghunathrao would stand in the open and gaze at the sun, but he was now barred from performing it which made him furious. Although the relationship between Madhavrao and Raghunathrao, the former carefully avoided exasperating his uncle beyond a certain limit and skillfully employed his uncle&#x27;s partisans so as to prevent any action against him. But Narayanrao lacked his elder brother&#x27;s foresight and so his dissidents were able to find a common goal in supporting his uncle.

==== Third attempt to escape ====
Raghunathrao was also able to find the finding the sympathy of Appaji Ram, the ambassador of Haidar Ali at Pune, who managed to persuade his ruler to support Raghunathrao&#x27;s cause. When Narayan found out about his uncle&#x27;s plan to escape by enlisting the support Haidar Ali, he confined him in his palace and allowed neither his friends to visit him nor his servants to attend to him. His uncle, whether through exasperation or shrewdness, declared that he would starve himself to death so that his murder would be attributed to his nephew. For the next eighteen days, he consumed nothing except for two ounces of deer milk each day. When he was finally exhausted due to pangs of hunger, his nephew somewhat relented by promising him a district and five castles and a jagir of Rs. 12 lakh per annum, provided some of the great chieftains would become surety for his future conduct.

== Foreign Policy ==

=== Resettlement of old allies ===
The Marathas led by Mahadji Shinde had recaptured Delhi in 1771. Mahadji Shinde and other Marathas chiefs were later occupied in looking after the affairs of Delhi and collecting revenues from other North Indian districts. Ghazi-uddin Imad-ul-mulk, an ally of the Marathas, was anxious to be reinstalled as the Wazir of the Mughal Empire as he had once been. The Mughal emperor Shah Alam II bitterly hated Ghazi-uddin for he murdering his father and would not give him any help. Meanwhile, Ghazi-uddin had been reduced to the status of a vagabond and so he went to Pune in December 1772 to make his case in front of the new Peshwa. In recognition of the services he had rendered onto the Marathas so far, and likely because of a promise made to him by Narayanrao, Nana Padnavis gave Ghazi-uddin a small provision in Bundelkhand. The previous Nawab of Bengal Mir Qasim was another important friend of the Marathas and expected a similar compensation for his services but it was beyond the power of the Peshwa to satisfy him.

=== British naval attack ===

In April 1772, as Madhavrao was on his death bed, the President of Bombay Council received orders from the Home authorities to try and acquire from the Maratha certain places such as Salsette, Vasai, Elephanta, Karanja and others islands in the vicinity of Mumbai and to station a British agent in Pune in order to gain that object. British official Thomas Mostyn was chosen for the task as he was already familiar with the Pune court, having led the British mission of 1767. He arrived in Pune on 13 October 1772 and spent the next two years keenly watching the events unfold and advising the Bombay Council to take the necessary steps for the acquisition of those place.

Soon after the death of Madhavrao and ascension to the Maratha throne of his ostensibly weaker brother Narayanrao, the British navy sensing an opportunity started wanton aggression against Maratha posts of Thane, Vasai, Vijaydurg and Ratnagiri on the west coast. But Narayanrao took immediate action by appointing Trimbak Vinayak as the Sar-Subah of Vasai and the Konkan, and dispatched him with necessary funds to counter the British efforts. Trimbak Vinayak and the Maratha naval officer Dhulap of Vijaydurg together successfully repelled the British attack. But Mostyn remained at Pune watching and waiting for another opportunity.

=== Nagpur succession crisis ===
The death of the ruler of Nagpur Janoji Bhonsle in May 1772 set off a succession dispute within his family and led to a civil war between his sons Mudhoji and Sabaji. The disputed created ruptures at the Court of Pune as Sakharam Bapu and Raghunathrao supported Mudhoji while Narayanrao, Nana Phadnavis and others supported Sabaji. Sabaji also gained the support of Nizam Ali Khan and fought some battles against him brother whose result turned out to be indecisive. The brothers finally reached an agreement, according to which Mudhoji&#x27;s son Raghuji was to be made the ruler of Nagpur. The arrangement had to be approved by the Peshwa, and so two agents, Vyankatrao Kashi Gupte and his brother Lakshman, were sent to Pune in order to acquire the robes for Raghuji.

The agents sent to Pune belonged to the Prabhu caste whose members were cross with Narayanrao who, likely under the impression from Nana Phadnavis, had reduced their caste status from that of Kshatriya (&quot;warrior&quot;) to that of Shudra (&quot;servant&quot;). Prominent leaders of the Prabhu community were called together and under severe torture, including starvation, forced to give up their caste status. This action on the part of Narayanrao lost him the support of an influential community who later supported Raghunathrao. The two agents then tried to help Raghunathrao escape from his confinement. The actions of the agents exasperated and disgusted the Peshwa who on 16 August 1773 issued orders recognising Sabaji as the rightful ruler of Nagpur and commanded the agents to go back to Nagpur along with the third agent Bhavani Shivam who had just arrived.

==Assassination==
The period between 16 and 30 August witnessed an unprecedented number of secret talks and concealed discussions taking place among the various partisans of Raghunathrao, but as this had been a regular occurrence at the palace, no responsible official paid any serious attention to them. Since Raghunathrao could not leave his confinement, the preparations for the plot were carried out by Tujali Pawar, an influential personal servant of Raghunathrao and his wife Anandibai. Tujali additionally felt he had been wronged by Narayanrao and possibly Madhavrao, and regardless of whether this supposed offense was real or not, it motivated him to play an integral part in the plot. While the previous plan involved simply capturing Narayanrao, the new plan involved his murder and was partly based on the assumption that Sakharam Bapu would remain neutral with regards to the plot.

=== Legal consequences ===
Ram Shastri, the Nyayadhish (&quot;Chief Justice&quot;) of the Maratha empire, likely began looking into the killing of Narayanrao immediately after the incident despite Raghunathrao&#x27;s opposition. The investigation lasted for around six weeks and decisions were made in accordance with established judicial practices. Shastri found Raghunathrao as the main culprit and in addition about fifty persons more or less responsible for the murder (forty nine males and one female servant). Of these forty nine men, thirteen were Gardis (eight Hindus and five Muslims), twenty six were Brahmin, three were Prabhu and seven were Marathas. The twenty six Brahmins were essentially clerks who acted as agents in planning and executing the details of the plan. Vyankatrao Kashi, his brother Laxman and Sakharam Hari Gupte were the three Prabhus who were declared to have played a prominent role in the plot. When Shastri approached Raghunathrao, the latter downplayed the murder as a private, personal affair and asked the former to not concern himself with it. Shastri on his part, without an ounce of fear, told Raghunathrao that he was the main culprit for the murder of his nephew. Hence Raghunathrao and the general public understood the degree of power that lay with the judiciary in a well-governed state. But Shastri was dismissed from his office by Raghunathrao and went back to his native village.

==== Barbhais Council ====
While Shastri was conducting his investigation, Sakharam Bapu ensured that pregnant Gangabai, the widow of Narayanrao, was secure and safe from harm&#x27;s way. If Gangabai were to give birth to a male child, he would become the heir to the kingdom. But if she were to give birth to a female child, Sakharam Bapu contemplated the idea of making Ali Bahadur, the grandson of Baji Rao, the Peshwa of the Maratha empire. He convinced most of the Maratha chiefs from Raghunathrao&#x27;s camp to switch sides without rousing his suspicion. He laid the foundations of a group of twelve Maratha officials and chiefs who were collectively known as the Barbhais Council (&quot;Twelve Comrades&quot;). These included Nana Phadnavis, Haripant Phadnavis, Babuji Naik, Maloji Ghorpade, Bhavanrao Pratinidhi, Raste, Patwardhans with the addition of Mahadji Shinde and Tukoji Holkar.

=== Raghunathrao&#x27;s short lived government ===

Having failed to convince the senior and most highly competent ministers such as Sakharam Bapu and Nana Phadnavis to join his new administration, Raghunathrao had to begin his rule with the help of ministers Chinto Vithal and Moroba Phadnavis. The two Nagpur agents also continued supporting him. Raghunathrao sent one of them, Laksham Kashi with a letter of friendly terms to Mudhoji Bhonsle inviting him to Pune with all his forces. The other Nagpur agent Vyankatrao remained in Pune to help the new Peshwa manage the new administration. He sent Amritrao to Satara to procure the robes from Chhatrapati Rajaram II but there was a delay and the robes were finally obtained on 10 October 1773. He did not ceremoniously accept them in a durbar at Pune but rather at Alegaon near the river Bhima on the last day of October. He prepared his own seal and purposefully omitted Rajaram&#x27;s name as being inauspicious.

During the Dashera festival occurring on 25 September 1773, apart from having to discuss the threats posed by Haidar Ali and Nizam Ali, Raghunathrao also had to deal with the Gardi chiefs who virtually held all the power and whose only goal was to get as much money from him as possible. He appointed Bhavanrao Pratinidhi as his agent for settling the matter with the Gardi chiefs. Bhavanrao Pratinidhi got rid of the Gardi chiefs from the palace by paying them the stipulated five lakh rupees and an additional amount of three lakh rupees in lieu of the three forts they wanted as their safe resort. During the negotiations, the Gardis had threatened to depose Raghunathrao and install Ali Bahadur (grandson of Peshwa Baji Rao) as the peshwa if their payments were made. They also demanded and were given a written order that Raghunathrao would protect them under all circumstances.

Hence Raghunathrao now had no strong supporters except second rate men such as the Gardi chiefs, and Sakharam Hari, Sadashiv Ramchandra, Vyankatrao Kashi, Abaji Mahadev, Tulaji Pawar, Moroba Phadnavis, Maloji Ghorpade, Govindrao Gaikwad, Manaji Phadke and Mudhoji Bhonsle. Gangadhar Yeshwant, an important partisan of Raghunathrao, died on 20 February 1774 and this considerably weakened his party. But at least his monetary troubles were relieved after Visaji Krishna arrived in Pune and brought with him, under orders from the previous Peshwa, a treasure of 22 lakh rupees and which Raghunathrao greedily sized.

=== Legacy ===
*The Narayan Peth area in Pune is named after Peshwa Narayanrao.
*There is a belief in Pune that Narayanrao&#x27;s ghost roams the ruins of Shaniwar Wada at every full moon night and calls out for help just like the way he did on the fateful day of his assassination . Bajirao II believed in the ghost superstition too and planted thousands of mango trees around Pune city and gave donations to Brahmins and religious institutions in the hope that this would propitiate the ghost.
*S. N. Patankar directed an early Indian silent film on the assassination of the Peshwa, titled &quot;Death of Narayanrao Peshwa&quot;, in 1915.

<text>Granulites are a class of high-grade metamorphic rocks of the granulite facies that have experienced high-temperature and moderate-pressure metamorphism. They are medium to coarse–grained and mainly composed of feldspars sometimes associated with quartz and anhydrous ferromagnesian minerals, with granoblastic texture and gneissose to massive structure. They are of particular interest to geologists because many granulites represent samples of the deep continental crust. Some granulites experienced decompression from deep in the Earth to shallower crustal levels at high temperature; others cooled while remaining at depth in the Earth.

The minerals present in a granulite will vary depending on the parent rock of the granulite and the temperature and pressure conditions experienced during metamorphism. A common type of granulite found in high-grade metamorphic rocks of the continents contains pyroxene, plagioclase feldspar and accessory garnet, oxides and possibly amphiboles. Both clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene may be present, and in fact, the coexistence of clino- and orthopyroxene in a metabasite (metamorphed basalt) defines the granulite facies.

A granulite may be visually quite distinct with abundant small pink or red pyralspite garnets in a &#x27;granular&#x27; holocrystalline matrix. Concentrations of garnets, micas, or amphiboles may form along a linear pattern resembling gneiss or migmatite banding.


== Formation ==
Granulites form at crustal depths, typically during regional metamorphism at high thermal gradients of greater than 30 °C/km. In continental crustal rocks, biotite may break down at high temperatures to form orthopyroxene + potassium feldspar + water, producing a granulite. Other possible minerals formed at dehydration melting conditions include sapphirine, spinel, sillimanite, and osumilite. Some assemblages such as sapphirine + quartz indicate very high temperatures of greater than 900 °C. Some granulites may represent the residues of partial melting at extraction of felsic melts in variable amounts, and in extreme cases represent rocks that all constituent minerals are anhydrous and thus look as if they did not melt at ultrahigh temperature conditions. Therefore, very high temperatures of 900 to 1150 °C are even necessary to produce the granulite-facies mineral assemblages. Such high temperatures at crustal depths only can be delivered by upwelling of the asthenospheric mantle in continental rifting settings, which can cause the regional metamorphism at the high thermal gradients of greater than 30 °C/km.

== Granulite facies ==
The granulite facies is determined by the lower temperature boundary of 700 ± 50 °C and the pressure range of 2–15 kb. The most common mineral assemblage of granulite facies consists of antiperthitic plagioclase, alkali feldspar containing up to 50% albite and Al2O3-rich pyroxenes.

Transition between amphibolite and granulite facies is defined by these reaction isograds:

:amphibole → pyroxene + H2O

:biotite → K-feldspar + garnet + orthopyroxene + H2O.

Hornblende granulite subfacies is a transitional coexistence region of anhydrous and hydrated ferromagnesian minerals, so the above-mentioned isograds mark the boundary with &quot;pyroxene granulite subfacies&quot; – facies with completely anhydrous mineral assemblages.

== 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; definition ==
Granulite (Latin &quot;granulum&quot;, &quot;a little grain&quot;) is a name used by petrographers to designate two distinct classes of rocks. According to the terminology of the French school it signifies a granite in which both kinds of mica (muscovite and biotite) occur, and corresponds to the German &quot;Granit&quot;, or to the English muscovite biotite granite. This application has not been accepted generally. [&quot;This granitic meaning of granulite is now obsolete.&quot;] To the German petrologists granulite means a more or less banded fine-grained metamorphic rock, consisting mainly of quartz and feldspar in very small irregular crystals and usually also containing a fair number of minute, rounded, pale-red garnets. Among English and American geologists the term is generally employed in this sense.

The granulites are very closely allied to the gneisses, as they consist of nearly the same minerals, but they are finer-grained, have usually less perfect foliation, are more frequently garnetiferous, and have some special features of microscopic structure. In the rocks of this group the minerals, as seen in a microscopic slide, occur as small rounded grains forming a closely fitted mosaic. The individual crystals never have perfect form, and indeed traces of it are rare. In some granulites they interlock, with irregular borders; in others they have been drawn out and flattened into tapering lenticles by crushing. In most cases they are somewhat rounded with smaller grains between the larger. This is especially true of the quartz and feldspar which are the predominant minerals; mica always appears as flat scales (irregular or rounded but not hexagonal). Both muscovite and biotite may be present and vary considerably in abundance; very commonly they have their flat sides parallel and give the rock a rudimentary schistosity, and they may be aggregated into bands in which case the granulites are indistinguishable from certain varieties of gneiss. The garnets are very generally larger than the above-mentioned ingredients, and easily visible with the eye as pink spots on the broken surfaces of the rock. They usually are filled with enclosed grains of the other minerals.

The feldspar of the granulites is mostly orthoclase or cryptoperthite; microcline, oligoclase and albite are also common. Basic feldspars occur only rarely. Among accessory minerals, in addition to apatite, zircon, and iron oxides, the following may be mentioned: hornblende (not common), riebeckite (rare), epidote and zoisite, calcite, sphene, andalusite, sillimanite, kyanite, hercynite (a green spinel), rutile, orthite and tourmaline. Though occasionally we may find larger grains of feldspar, quartz or epidote, it is more characteristic of these rocks that all the minerals are in small, nearly uniform, imperfectly shaped individuals.

On account of the minuteness with which it has been described and the important controversies on points of theoretical geology which have arisen regarding it, the granulite district of Saxony (in the area of Rosswein and Penig) in Germany may be considered the typical region for rocks of this group. It should be remembered that though granulites are probably the commonest rocks of this country, they are mingled with granites, gneisses, gabbros, amphibolites, mica schists and many other petrographical types. All of these rocks show more-or-less metamorphism either of a thermal character or due to pressure and crushing. The granites pass into gneiss and granulite; the gabbros into flaser gabbro and amphibolite; the slates often contain andalusite or chiastolite, and show transitions to mica schists. At one time these rocks were regarded as Archean gneisses of a special type. Johannes Georg Lehmann propounded the hypothesis that their present state was due principally to crushing acting on them in a solid condition, grinding them down and breaking up their minerals, while the pressure to which they were subjected welded them together into coherent rock. It is now believed, however, that they are comparatively recent and include sedimentary rocks, partly of Palaeozoic age, and intrusive masses which may be nearly massive or may have gneissose, flaser or granulitic structures. These have been developed largely by the injection of semi-consolidated highly viscous intrusions, and the varieties of texture are original or were produced very shortly after the crystallization of the rocks. Meanwhile, however, Lehmanns advocacy of post-consolidation crushing as a factor in the development of granulites has been so successful that the terms granulitization and granulitic structures are widely employed to indicate the results of dynamometamorphism acting on rocks at a period long after their solidification.

The Saxon granulites are apparently for the most part igneous and correspond in composition to granites and porphyries. There are, however, many granulites which undoubtedly were originally sediments (arkoses, grits and sandstones). A large part of the highlands of Scotland consists of paragranulites of this kind, which have received the group name of Moine gneisses.

Along with the typical acid granulites above described, in Saxony, India, Scotland and other countries there occur dark-colored basic granulites (trap granulites). These are fine-grained rocks, not usually banded, nearly black in color with small red spots of garnet. Their essential minerals are pyroxene, plagioclase and garnet: chemically they resemble the gabbros. Green augite and hypersthene form a considerable part of these rocks, they may contain also biotite, hornblende and quartz. Around the garnets there is often a radial grouping of small grains of pyroxene and hornblende in a clear matrix of feldspar: these centric structures are frequent in granulites. The rocks of this group accompany gabbro and serpentine, but the exact conditions under which they are formed and the significance of their structures is not very clearly understood.

<text>Valentine Ruth Henshall (born 7 March 1967), known professionally as Ruthie Henshall, is an English actress, singer and dancer, known for her work in musical theatre. She began her professional stage career in 1986, before making her West End debut in &quot;Cats&quot; in 1987. A five-time Olivier Award nominee, she won the 1995 Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her role as Amalia Balash in the London revival of &quot;She Loves Me&quot; (1994).

Henshall&#x27;s other Olivier nominated roles are Polly Baker in the original London production of &quot;Crazy for You&quot; (1993–1994), Roxie Hart in the revival of &quot;Chicago&quot; (1997–1998) and the title roles in the original productions of &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; (2001) and &quot;Marguerite&quot; (2008). She made her Broadway debut in 1999 as Velma Kelly in &quot;Chicago&quot; and returned to the Broadway production to play Roxie Hart in 2010. She also starred as Mrs Wilkinson for two years in the West End production of &quot;Billy Elliot the Musical&quot; (2014–2016). She returned to television acting in 2021 by appearing as Miranda Evans in the BBC soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot;.

==Early and personal life==
Henshall was born on 7 March 1967 in Orpington, London. Her father, David, was a journalist, later the editor of the &quot;East Anglian Daily Times&quot;, a Suffolk morning newspaper. Henshall dated Prince Edward for a number of years, before becoming engaged to actor John Gordon Sinclair. After she took the role of Velma Kelly in &quot;Chicago&quot; on Broadway, the relationship ended. 

She met actor and singer Tim Howar, her male co-star lead in the West End production of &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot;. The couple married in 2004 and have two daughters, Lily and Dolly. The couple separated in August 2009 and later divorced in January 2010.

==Career==
Prior to making her stage debut at the age of 19, Henshall trained at Laine Theatre Arts in Epsom, Surrey. Her debut performance was in the &quot;Cascade Revue&quot; at the West Cliff Theatre in Clacton-on-Sea. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, she took part in a touring production of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; as Maggie. Her West End debut came shortly thereafter when she was cast in &quot;Cats&quot;, making appearances as Jemima, Demeter, Griddlebone and Grizabella.

In 1988, at the age of 21, Henshall was cast in &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; as one of the bar girls, showing at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. She then went on to originate the role of Aphra in &quot;Children of Eden&quot; at the Prince Edward Theatre. The summer of 1989 saw her at the Chichester Festival Theatre performing in plays by Shakespeare, Molière as well as a role in the musical &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;, based on &quot;You Can Never Tell&quot; by George Bernard Shaw.

In 1992, at the age of 25, Henshall was cast as Fantine in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. Her first starring role came in the 1993 trans-Atlantic transfer of the Broadway production &quot;Crazy for You&quot; which opened at the Prince Edward Theatre. Her performance earned her the first of five Olivier Award nominations. In 1995, Henshall starred in &quot;She Loves Me&quot;, winning the Olivier as Best Actress in a Musical. That same year, she performed a concert of Gershwin songs at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall. Later, in October, she recreated her role of Fantine for the 10th Anniversary Concert performance of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall. In 1996, she took on the role of Nancy in producer Cameron Mackintosh&#x27;s hit revival of &quot;Oliver!&quot; at the London Palladium. In 1997, Henshall originated the role of Roxie Hart in the West End transfer of the Broadway revival of &quot;Chicago&quot;. For this role, she received her third Olivier nomination for Best Actress in a Musical, which went to her co-star Ute Lemper.

Henshall was cast in the title role of the stage musical adaptation of the Francis Ford Coppola film &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot;, which opened in London in August 2001 to mixed reviews. Although it closed after a run of just eight weeks, she was once again nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for her performance.

Henshall has also appeared at the Chichester Festival Theatre, has toured Britain in the revue &quot;The Magnificent Musicals&quot;, and has performed in &quot;Hey, Mr. Producer!&quot;, a celebration of the works of Cameron Mackintosh. Her solo recordings include &quot;The Ruthie Henshall Album&quot;, &quot;Pilgrim&quot;, and &quot;Love Is Here to Stay&quot;, a collection of Gershwin tunes. She succeeded the role of Marian Halcombe from Maria Friedman in Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;The Woman in White&quot;, from July 2005 until February 2006. She was also cast in the title role in Marguerite, a new musical from the pens of Michel Legrand, Herbert Kretzmer, Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schönberg. The show opened on 7 May 2008 at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London, but closed early on 13 September 2008.

Henshall&#x27;s Broadway credits include Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Putting It Together&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot; (as both Velma and Roxie), and off-Broadway &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. In 2000 she guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; titled &quot;Panic&quot;; she played an author named P.K. Todd. Her first feature film, a musical version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; with Kelsey Grammer, aired on NBC in the United States in November 2004 and was released as a commercial attraction to theatres in the UK and Europe. In January 2006 she appeared in the four-part BBC Television series &quot;The Sound of Musicals&quot;.

In 2008, Henshall replaced Natalia Bestemianova as a judge on the ITV1 show &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; alongside Robin Cousins, Karen Barber, Nicky Slater and Jason Gardiner. Her appointment to &quot;The Ice Panel&quot; caused some controversy as she was the only judge with no experience in ice skating. She returned for a second series in 2009. Following the conclusion of the 2009 series, Henshall said on &quot;Angela and Friends&quot; the Sky1 TV programme that she was glad that she was away from &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;. Her replacement for the 2010 series was Emma Bunton.

Henshall performed two evening concerts with Kim Criswell entitled &quot;From Broadway to Hollywood&quot; at London&#x27;s Cadogan Hall in the summer of 2009.

She returned to the role of Roxie in &quot;Chicago&quot; at the Cambridge Theatre, London, on 14 December 2009 and completed her run on 24 April 2010. This was the second time Henshall played the role in London, having created it in 1997. She stated in an interview that she felt more comfortable in the part the second time around, being in her forties. She has stated that, &quot;Anyone who plays the role of Roxie should be in their forties, as they have lived and learned&quot;. She has also recently played Roxie in the Broadway company of &quot;Chicago&quot;.

In March 2011, Henshall took the role of Elvira in the classic play &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; in the West End, after playing the role in several regional theatre engagements.

In 2011 she also appeared as a theatre actor in an episode of the HBO comedy &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; that aired 14 August, as well as a lawyer in &quot;The Case&quot;, a 5-part legal drama that aired from 31 October to 4 November on BBC One.

In February 2012 it was announced that Henshall will headline a concert of &quot;Side by Side by Sondheim&quot; in Australia. Henshall took a purely acting role as billionaire Stephanie Gaunt in the CBBC series &quot;Wizards vs Aliens&quot; in 2012. Henshall and Daniel Bowling (director of musicals) have written a book, &quot;So You Want to Be in Musicals?&quot;, published in 2012. In 2014, it was announced that she would play Mrs Wilkinson in &quot;Billy Elliot the Musical&quot; from 12 May. After two years in the production, she became the final actress to take on the role before the show&#x27;s closure.

In 2020, it was confirmed that Henshall would be participating in the twentieth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here&quot;. She was eliminated on 29 November, finishing in 11th place. In March 2021, she began appearing in the BBC soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot; as Miranda Evans.

In 2022, Henshall starred in the revival of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine&#x27;s musical &quot;Passion&quot; at the Hope Mill Theatre in Manchester, playing Fosca.

<text>Saintfield () is a village and civil parish in County Down, Northern Ireland. It is about halfway between Belfast and Downpatrick on the A7 road. It had a population of 3,588 in the 2021 Census, made up mostly of commuters working in both south and central Belfast, which is about 18 km away. The population of the surrounding countryside is mostly involved in farming.

Running east to west across the A7 is the B6 road, and to the west of this crossroads is Main Street, which takes one towards Lisburn and Ballynahinch, and to the east is Station Road which takes one towards Killyleagh.

== History ==
The area that is now Saintfield was historically called &quot;Tawnaghnym&quot; (recorded in 1605) or &quot;Taunaghnieve&quot; (recorded in 1663), which is believed to come from the Irish &quot;Tamhnach Naomh&quot; or &quot;Tamhnaigh Naomh&quot;, meaning &quot;field of saints&quot;. The English translation, Saintfield, did not come into use until the 18th century.

In the 16th century, the Saintfield area was part of South Clannaboy owned by Sir Con McNeil Oge O&#x27;Neil. His lands were confiscated after a false accusation of disloyalty in 1602 and were granted to Sir James Hamilton in 1605 who &#x27;planted&#x27; English and Scottish settlers in the area. Saintfield was originally an early 17th-century settlement, with the first church being built about 1633. In 1709 Hamilton sold the estate to Major General Nicholas Price of Hollymount, County Down, who laid the foundations of the town and renamed it Saintfield in 1712.

Nicholas Price remained owner of the village until his death in 1734 and encouraged linen manufacturers and tradesmen to settle, established a barracks, repaired the parish church and established markets and fairs. The village had a number of corn, flour and flax mills, the remains of which are visible today, and has retained a tradition of textile manufacture through Saintfield Yarns. Development was continued by the Price family and in 1750 the family, headed by Francis Price, grandson of Nicholas, moved to a newly built Saintfield House, just north of the village.

Multiple churches were built in the late 1700s. The Price family rebuilt the Church of Ireland parish church in 1776, including an older church in the construction. The First Presbyterian Church was built one year later despite Presbyterian worship existing since the early 1600s. Society of United Irishmen members killed at the Battle of Saintfield in June 1798 are buried here. A Roman Catholic church was built in 1787 as the Chapel of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.

A new Roman Catholic Church (Mary Mother of the Church) was built to a Romanesque design and opened in December 1965 off the A7 road. It can seat up to 600 people and was the highpoint of the pastorate of Fr. Hugh O&#x27;Neill PP.

A Second Presbyterian Church was built in 1796 on the Ballynahinch Road. The architectural and historic significance of the town centre is reflected in its designation as a Conservation Area in 1997.

===1798 in Saintfield===

In 1792 the Presbyterian minister Thomas Ledlie Birch convened a Saintfield branch of the Society of United Irishmen, founded the year before by liberal Protestant in Belfast, and moved their first resolutions. These called for &quot;a more equal representation of the people&quot; in the Parliament in Dublin and the recognition of &quot;our brethren Roman Catholics as men deprived of their just rights&quot;. Faced with growing repression, the United Irishmen launched a rebellion in 1798, which began with a largely Catholic uprising in Leinster but quickly spread to the Presbyterian Ulster.

On 9 June 1798, a British force was ambushed in a wood near Saintfield. About 100 men were killed altogether, and the United Irishmen emerged victorious. The headstones of men who were killed in this battle can be seen near the river at the bottom of the First Presbyterian Church graveyard. Following a patriotic sermon delivered by Birch, the insurgents marched south to the main rebel encampment at Ballynahinch, where on 13 June they were routed by government forces. In the aftermath of the battle, Saintfield was sacked and only a few pre-1798 buildings remain.

The village was subsequently rebuilt. In 1802 the Price family residence in Main Street was converted to an inn. In 1803 the Market House was built. The White Horse Inn was also built and almshouses in 1813. However, the village declined from the mid-19th century, with population reducing from 923 in 1851 to 533 just before the First World War.

===The Troubles===
On 26 January 1974, soldiers from the Special Air Service (SAS) intercepted a team of loyalist paramilitaries returning weapons to a derelict farmhouse on the outskirts of Saintfield that was being used as an arms cache. One of the loyalists was shot and wounded in the chest as he entered the farmhouse and ascended the staircase. Three comrades waiting for him in front of the building were captured by soldiers emerging from a hidden observation post.

<text>The Nokia 5210 is a mobile phone manufactured by Nokia. Announced on 19 November 2001, it was released in early 2002. The 5210 is designed for use in tough conditions and is dust, shock and water resistant. Many of the features are similar to the Nokia 3330, which include WAP over CSD. It features rubber Xpress-On covers, and a built-in thermometer. The thermometer displays the internal temperature of the phone&#x27;s battery. This feature is also present on other phones that have &quot;netmonitor&quot; enabled.

Like most Nokia&#x27;s phones, users can customize the case easily from its original colors: blue or orange mixed with silver and black. The 5210 is notably also the only Nokia phone with an orange backlight, unlike the green or blue ones on other Nokia models with a monochrome display.

The device runs on Series 20 and its calling features include Last Number Redial, Speed Dial, Conference Call, and Call Waiting. The basic calling features such as Hold, Un-hold, End all calls, Mute and Transfer are available as well. Productivity tools and utilities are available such as Calculator, Countdown Timer, Stopwatch, Thermometer, and Calendar. It shares the same pre-loaded games as the Nokia 3330, which include &quot;Snake II&quot;, &quot;Space Impact&quot;, &quot;Bantumi&quot;, &quot;Pairs II&quot; and &quot;Bumper&quot;.

Moreover, the phone has a built-in infrared interface which allows data transfers to any device that is equipped with an infrared interface. Nokia supplies free software to allow the phone book to be edited and text messages to be typed, sent and read from the PC.

The phone supports 17 languages for the menu interface and 11 languages for the T9 dictionary.

==Bugs==
Some versions of the Nokia 5210 firmware, particularly the Arabic models, contains a bug with the Arabic language text, that occurs when user tries to type SMS, the space between words in Arabic becomes a small rectangular symbol instead of a space.

==Successor==
The 5210 was superseded by the Nokia 5100.</text><links>

<doc id="1227008" wikidata="Q2041065" url="?curid=1227008" title="Vassian Patrikeyev">
<text>Vassian Patrikeyev, also known as Vassian Kosoy (&quot;Вассиан Патрикеев&quot;, &quot;Вассиан Косой&quot; in Russian; real name – knyaz &quot;Василий Иванович Патрикеев&quot;, or Vasili Ivanovich Patrikeyev) (c. 1470 – between 1531 and 1545) was a bishop of Rostov and confidant of Ivan III of Moscow. Vassian was an ecclesiastic and political figure and writer and an early member of the House of Golitsyn that traced its male-line descent to Duke Patrikas of Korela and to Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania.

==Political action==
He was known to have been one of the leaders of the boyar party, which supported tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich (grandson of Ivan III) in a struggle against Sophia Paleologue&#x27;s son Vasili for succession to the throne.

In ecclesiastic matters, the boyar party was generally closer to heretical and freedom-loving circles.

Vassian wrote the &quot;Epistle on the Ugra&quot; (&quot;Poslanie na Ugru&quot;), which contains political propaganda about the so-called &quot;Stand on the Ugra&quot;. It argued that Batu Khan had plundered and enslaved the land, usurping the title of &quot;tsar&quot; without being &quot;of a &quot;tsarian&quot; family&quot;, alleging that his descendant Ahmed Khan bin Küchük was a mere &quot;brigand and savage and fighter-of-God&quot;, while insisting Ivan III was the only real, legitimate, Orthodox &quot;tsar&quot;. Vassian wrote that the Tatar campaign (&quot;nakhozhdenie&quot;) had made the Muscovites afraid, but the Church released Ivan from any oath made to Ahmed Khan, as it was made under duress, and so he no longer owed his Golden Horde overlord any loyalty. The problem with this logic is that Rus&#x27; writers had traditionally translated both the Mongol title &quot;khan&quot; and the Greek Byzantine title &quot;basileus&quot; (&quot;king, emperor&quot;) as &quot;tsar&quot; (originally from &quot;caesar&quot;), but Vassian was arguing only Christian Orthodox monarchs such as the Byzantine &quot;basileus&quot; and the Muscovite &quot;knyaz&quot; (&quot;prince&quot;) should be called &quot;tsars&quot;. Therefore, Vassian resolved that he needed to elevate the prince of Moscow to the status of &quot;tsar&quot;, while claiming the Chingisid khans must have been imposters, stealing the &quot;tsar&quot; title they never deserved, even though Vassian thereby rejected the Pauline doctrine invoked in the &quot;Life of Alexander Nevsky&quot; and the &quot;vita&quot; of Michael of Chernigov. It is the first written political attempt to deny the legitimacy of the Golden Horde&#x27;s supremacy over the Rus&#x27; principalities since the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27; in 1237–1242, and also the first Muscovite attempt to portray the 1480 Stand on the Ugra as having major ideological significance. Literary successors of Vassian&#x27;s epistle would greatly exaggerate the standoff, wherein &#x27;the events of 1480 assume the status of pivotal moments in the history of man.&#x27;

In 1499, Ivan III found out about the conspiracy against Vasili and ordered arrests (the tsar first favored Dmitry Ivanovich). Vassian Patrikeyev was forced to take monastic vows and sent to Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery.

==Ecclesiastic career==
At the monastery, Patrikeyev became a student of Nil Sorsky and absorbed his philosophy. It appears that in 1503 Patrikeyev and Sorsky came to Moscow to attend a church council (&quot;sobor&quot;). During this ecclesiastic meeting, the two demanded leniency for the heretics and opposed Joseph Volotsky&#x27;s views on this issue, subsequently inflaming a dispute between the two parties in the form of personal letters.

During the reign of Vasili III, Patrikeyev reached an important status. Due to his rising influence, many heretics escaped severe punishment. At some point, the tsar even forbade Volotsky to defame Patrikeyev. It appears that Varlaam, who had been close to Nil Sorsky and his followers, was elected Metropolitan bishop with some assistance from Vassian Patrikeyev.

In about 1517, Patrikeyev began his work on revision of the so-called &quot;Кормчая книга&quot; (Kormchaya kniga, or Book of guidelines; see Canon law), a code of ecclesiastic decrees and laws by the Byzantine emperors. In 1518, Maximus the Greek came from Mount Athos to take part in his work, gathering oppositionary people around him, including Vassian Patrikeyev.

In 1523, a Josephinian hegumen from Volokolamsk named Daniel was elected metropolitan. Soon after this, the church commenced prosecution of the opposition.

A few years later, Patrikeyev&#x27;s influence began to weaken due to, among other things, his open disapproval of Vasili&#x27;s divorce. In 1531, Vassian was summoned to appear before the church council as a defendant. Metropolitan Daniel accused Patrikeyev of unauthorized revision of the &quot;Kormchaya kniga&quot;; insertion of Hellenistic ideas; arbitrary removal of passages which had asserted the right of the monasteries to own patrimonies; revilement of miracle workers, e.g. Saint Makarius Kalyazinsky and Metropolitan Jonah; &quot;heretic lines&quot; in his translation of Simeon Metaphrastes&#x27; &quot;Life of St. Mary&quot;. The church council found Patrikeyev guilty and sent him to a hostile Joseph-Volokolamsk Monastery, where he would die a decade later.

Patrikeyev&#x27;s date of death is uncertain. He died no later than 1545 and a violent death, if one is to believe Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s closest associate Andrei Kurbsky.

<doc id="1227015" wikidata="Q3882169" url="?curid=1227015" title="Omeros">
<text>Omeros is an epic poem by Saint Lucian writer Derek Walcott, first published in 1990. The work is divided into seven &quot;books&quot; containing a total of sixty-four chapters. Many critics view &quot;Omeros&quot; as Walcott&#x27;s finest work.

In 2022, it was included on the &quot;Big Jubilee Read&quot; list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

==Overview==
The poem very loosely echoes and references Homer and some of his major characters from the &quot;Iliad&quot;. Some of the poem&#x27;s major characters include the island fishermen Achille and Hector, the retired English officer Major Plunkett and his wife Maud, the housemaid Helen, the blind man Seven Seas (who symbolically represents Homer), and the author himself. Although the main narrative of the poem takes place on the island of St. Lucia, where Walcott was born and raised, Walcott also includes scenes from Brookline, Massachusetts (where Walcott was living and teaching at the time of the poem&#x27;s composition) and the character Achille imagines a voyage from Africa onto a slave ship that&#x27;s headed for the Americas; also, in Book Five of the poem, Walcott narrates some of his travel experiences in a variety of cities around the world, including Lisbon, London, Dublin, Rome, and Toronto.

The island of Saint Lucia was historically known as &quot;the Helen of the West Indies&quot; during the 18th century because colonial control of the island frequently changed hands between the French and English who fought over the island due to its strategic location &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; North America. In reference to this appellation, Walcott sometimes personifies the island as if it is a character referred to as &quot;Helen&quot;, symbolically tying the island to both the Homeric Helen as well as to the housemaid Helen.

Unlike a conventional epic poem, Walcott divides the narrative between his characters and his own voice so that his epic has no main protagonist or &quot;hero&quot;. Moreover, his narrative does not follow a clear, linear path. Instead, Walcott jumps around in time and from character to character without much concern for narrative plotting. These tendencies, combined with Walcott&#x27;s insertion of himself into the poem, as well as his commentary on his characters as fictional creations, make the poem a postmodernist epic.

Although most of the poem is supposed to take place in the late 20th century, there are sections of the poem that take place in other time periods. For instance, there are chapters that take place in the West Indies in the late 18th century (following the ancestors of the characters Achille and Plunkett). These passages describe the Battle of the Saintes which took place off the coast of St. Lucia in 1782 and ended with the British fleet, under the command of Admiral George Rodney (who appears in the poem), defeating the French. For another example, in Books 4 and 5 of the poem, Walcott also writes about and in the voice of the 19th-century activist Caroline Weldon who worked on behalf of the rights of the Lakota Sioux Indian tribe in the Dakotas.

The plot of &quot;Omeros&quot; can be divided into three main narrative threads that crisscross throughout the book. The first one follows the Homeric rivalry of Achille and Hector over their love for Helen. There is also a minor character named Philoctete, an injured fisherman, inspired by Homer&#x27;s Philoctetes. The second thread is the interwoven story of Major Plunkett and his wife Maud, who live on the island and must reconcile themselves to the history of British colonization of St. Lucia. The final thread is the autobiographical narrative of Walcott himself. Walcott, by using myth and history, advocates the need to return to traditions in order to challenge the modernity born out of colonialism.

==Form==
Through the vast majority of the poem, Walcott uses a three-line form that is reminiscent of the terza rima form that Dante used for the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. However, Walcott&#x27;s form is much looser than Dante&#x27;s. His rhyme scheme does not follow a regular pattern like Dante&#x27;s. Although Walcott claimed in an interview that the poem was written in hexameter, this characterization of the poem&#x27;s form is inaccurate. Lance Callahan notes that &quot;despite the fact that most lines are composed of twelve syllables, so wildly varied is the metrical construction of the poem that at times it gives the appearance of being in free verse&quot;. Jill Gidmark notes that &quot;Walcott&#x27;s lines are visually, though not metrically, the same length&quot;.

For one brief section (Section III) of the opening chapter of Book 4, Walcott breaks completely with the three-line form and writes rhyming couplets in tetrameter.

==Reception==
Soon after its publication in 1990, &quot;Omeros&quot; received praise from publications like &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, the latter of which chose the book as one of its &quot;Best Books of 1990&quot; and called it &quot;one of Mr. Walcott&#x27;s finest poetic works.&quot; The book also won the WH Smith Literary Award in 1991. In 1992, Walcott was also awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, and the Nobel committee member who presented the award, Professor Kjell Espmark, singled out Walcott&#x27;s most recent achievement at the time, &quot;Omeros&quot;, recognizing the book as a &quot;major work&quot;. Walcott painted the cover for the book, which depicts some of his main characters at sea together in a boat. In 2004, the critic Hilton Als of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the book &quot;Walcott&#x27;s masterpiece&quot; and characterized the poem as &quot;the perfect marriage of Walcott’s classicism and his nativism&quot;.

==Stage adaptation==
Walcott has adapted his poem for performance at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe, London. Starring Saint Lucian actor Joseph Marcell and Jade Anouka, it was presented in May and June 2014, and was reprised in October 2015.

<text>USS &quot;Attala&quot; (APA-130) was a &quot;Haskell&quot;-class attack transport in service with the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946. She was scrapped in 1974.

== History ==
&quot;Attala&quot; was of the VC2-S-AP5 Victory ship design type was named for Attala County, Mississippi. She was laid down under a United States Maritime Commission contract (MCV hull 46) on 18 July 1944 at Wilmington, Los Angeles, by the California Shipbuilding Corporation; launched on 27 September 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Paul Pigott; and simultaneously acquired by the Navy and commissioned on 30 November 1944.

After shakedown training along the west coast, the attack transport departed Seattle, Washington, on 31 January 1945. She paused at Pearl Harbor to embark troops and equipment and then got underway on 9 February, bound for Eniwetok. &quot;Attala&quot; pushed on to Iwo Jima, where she arrived on 13 March. The ship spent several days there disembarking troops and unloading equipment. On the 18th, &quot;Attala&quot; moored at Saipan to take on wounded marines for passage back to the United States. She stopped briefly at Pearl Harbor to disembark passengers and then continued on to San Francisco, California.

On 18 April, &quot;Attala&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor. She then began a week of intensive amphibious training off Maui. &quot;Attala&quot; embarked replacement personnel, loaded cargo, and got underway on 14 May. She made stops at Saipan and Ulithi before anchoring in Leyte Gulf on 5 June. On that day, she assumed duty as a receiving ship.

&quot;Attala&quot; left the Philippines on 17 June and made stops at Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor before arriving in San Francisco on 8 July. From 12 until 20 July, &quot;Attala&quot; was in drydock at a shipyard in Everett, Washington. The ship departed the west coast on 24 July, and on 5 August, reached Eniwetok, where she joined a convoy bound for Okinawa.

On 21 August, &quot;Attala&quot; dropped anchor off Hagushi beach, Okinawa. Early in September, she took on board troops and equipment slated for occupation duty in Korea. On the 7th, she arrived at Jinsen, Korea, and-after debarking her charges returned to Okinawa.

&quot;Attala&quot; took on board Marines for transportation to Qingdao, China. She began debarking them there on 21 November. &quot;Attala&quot; left Chinese waters on the 23rd and began the long journey to the United States. Making only one stop en route at Manila, Philippines, &quot;Attala&quot; arrived in Los Angeles, California, on 18 December.

After voyage, repairs, and a period of liberty for the crew, &quot;Attala&quot; resumed operations. On 14 January 1946, she got underway for San Diego, California. The transport transited the Panama Canal on the 23rd and then continued on to Norfolk, Virginia. She anchored off Hampton Roads on 1 February and began the deactivation.

She proceeded to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia, and on 26 February 1946 &quot;Attala&quot; was decommissioned. She was transferred to the War Shipping Administration for disposal. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 20 March 1946.

=== Fate ===
&quot;Attala&quot; entered the National Defense Reserve Fleet at James River, Virginia on 3 March 1946. In 1954 &quot;Attala&quot; was withdrawn from the Reserve Fleet as part of a Repair Program, GAA-No. Atl. &amp; Gulf, and then returned. On 15 March 1974 she was sold to Mr. Isaac Varela, for $727,007, to be scrapped. At 1000 EDT, on 3 April 1974 she was withdrawn from the Reserve Fleet and sent to the breaker&#x27;s yard.

All that remains of &quot;Attala&quot; is her brass builder&#x27;s plate.

== Awards ==
&quot;Attala&quot; earned one battle star for her World War II service.

<text>Tansley is a village on the southern edge of the Derbyshire Peak District, two miles east of Matlock.

==History==
Tansley is recorded in the Domesday Book as Taneslege, and its name comes from the combination of the Old English elements &quot;tān&quot; and &quot;lēah&quot;. &quot;Lēah&quot; has been translated as &#x27;woodland clearing&#x27;, but the &quot;tān&quot; element is contested. It may mean &#x27;branch&#x27;, perhaps used of &#x27;a valley branching off from the main valley&#x27;. However, it has also been translated as a masculine Anglo-Saxon personal name, that is otherwise unrecorded. Other suggestions have been &#x27;sprout, shoot&#x27;, thus translating the name as &#x27;wood or clearing from which shoots were obtained&#x27;.
Tansley grew during the Industrial Revolution, its main industry being the quarrying of millstone grit (for making mill-stones, now adopted as the symbol of the Peak District National Park). A copious amount of water runs off Tansley moor above the village, eventually running into Bentley Brook, a tributary of the Derwent. Bentley Brook and three of its feeder streams have been dammed in the past to make artificial lakes which provided water to power mills. As well as five mills in Lumsdale Valley there were also three mills in Tansley village, two of which remain having been restored for new uses. Nowadays the surviving lakes are stocked with fish for angling. The water also led to the establishment of Tansley Hydro (later Tansley House residential adult care home, now closed) when spas and hydrotherapy were in fashion and Victorian tourists came to the Matlock area for its Romantic charm.
Tansley is now more famous for its many garden centres and plant nurseries, its many small businesses and its large Sunday car-boot market.

==Twinning arrangements==
Tansley has an informal twinning arrangement with the small town of Babadag in Tulcea County, Romania. The two communities have occasional exchange visits, and more frequent postal and email contact, arranged through an organisation named TABALINK (the Tansley Babadag Association). The aims of TABALINK are:

- to promote friendship and understanding between the people of the village of Tansley, and the wider area of Derbyshire, England; and the people of the town of Babadag and the surrounding area of Tulcea, Eastern Romania.

- to build links between the peoples of the communities concerned in all possible ways - educational, cultural and commercial.

- to stimulate and foster mutual exchanges between individuals, families and societies within the communities.

- to organize social and fund raising events and activities to support the objects of the Association.
==Media==
The Tansley Village Hall was used in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;How to Look Good Naked&quot; in 2009. Tansley was also used a filming location for Shane Meadows&#x27; 2004 film &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Shoes.&quot;

Tansley&#x27;s communications network includes the Tansley Hotwire, a village e-mail service which distributes news and information to residents, and a website.

In February 2010 Tansley featured in the Sunday Times Property Section as a village that was &quot;alive and kicking&quot;, one where community spirit still thrives.

==Community buildings==

===Anglican Church===

 In 1839 Tansley was part of the parish of Crich. At that time it is recorded in a petition by the churchwardens and other parishioners of the parish of Crich that &quot;the hamlet of Tansley contains a population of upwards of 500 souls and is distant from the Parish Church (of Crich) of four miles and that it is extremely inconvenient for the inhabitants of the said hamlet to attend divine service in the said parish of Crich, and in order to provide some church accommodation and aid for spiritual wants of the people residing therein considerable funds have been raised by voluntary contributions together with other grants to build a chapel&quot;.

The church was started in 1839, built of stone quarried locally, and opened 1 year later dedicated to the Holy Trinity.

By the middle of the 1860s, Matlock Bank, just over a mile away, had become popular with visitors coming to take the waters and although Holy Trinity church was large enough for local residents, it was not big enough to cope with additional visitors from Matlock Bank. The church was enlarged in 1870 by adding a North Aisle. New pews replaced the box pews and the altar area was changed. It was recognised that the addition of one aisle “ ... produced an oddity but it is intended to add a corresponding wing should further accommodation be necessary&quot;. In the event, it obviously did not prove to be necessary.

===Methodist Church===
 The Methodist church was built in Church Street in 1829, 11 years before the Anglican church (Holy Trinity).

It replaced the smaller old Chapel, an octagonal building at The Knoll, built in 1811 on the site of a former cockfighting pit.

The present church has been modernised in recent years. It has its own schoolroom behind it.

===Village Hall===
 Tansley Village Hall is located next to Tansley village green. It is a popular venue for clubs, groups, parties and events. It is home to Tansley Film, hosts live comedy and musical shows (including Live &amp; Local), and provides a meeting place for Tansley Ladies Group, Tansley Garden &amp; Countryside Club, Tansley Tuesday Club, Tansley Players (drama group), an art group, yoga, pilates, Zumba, tai chi and pre-school children&#x27;s cookery classes.

The hall, opened in 1843, was used as a school until 1949.

The hall (as of February 2014) has been substantially renovated since July 2010. It has had a new entrance, with oak door and disabled access, new toilet facilities, a new ground floor roof with a skylight, a new upper floor roof, new windows, internal renovation and redecoration of the main hall, bar area and small meeting room (with kitchen) and new curtains and blinds. 
===Community Hall===
 The Community Hall, at the lower end of Church Street, was built in 1887 as the Liberal Club when stones in the front wall were inscribed with the names of eminent men from the parish.

Its ownership was later transferred to the Parish Council, as seen by the inscription &quot;Parish Building&quot; over the entrance. The Parish Council sub-let it in 1906 to the Tansley Institute as a Reading Room, to replace the one within The Church School. The institute also used it as a non-sectarian Adult Sunday School and for Technical Education. Later it was also used for general recreation such as snooker and billiards and a youth club.

==Sport==
Tansley is home to Tansley Juniors Football Club, a charter standard club who currently have around 10 teams ranging from U7s to Seniors. The club has the first Under-21 football team within the Derbyshire Dales.

The village is the site of the headquarters of the British Orienteering Federation.

<doc id="1227022" wikidata="Q256865" url="?curid=1227022" title="Riebeckite">
<text>Riebeckite is a sodium-rich member of the amphibole group of silicate minerals, chemical formula Na2(Fe2+3Fe3+2)Si8O22(OH)2. It forms a solid solution series with magnesioriebeckite. It crystallizes in the monoclinic system, usually as long prismatic crystals showing a diamond-shaped cross section, but also in fibrous, bladed, acicular, columnar, and radiating forms. Its Mohs hardness is 5.0–6.0, and its specific gravity is 3.0–3.4. Cleavage is perfect, two directions in the shape of a diamond; fracture is uneven, splintery. It is often translucent to nearly opaque.

==Name and discovery==
Riebeckite was first described in 1888 for an occurrence on Socotra Island, Aden Governorate, Yemen, and named for German explorer Emil Riebeck (1853–1885).

The mineral is also known as crocidolite.

==Occurrence==
Riebeckite typically forms dark-blue elongated to fibrous crystals in highly alkali granites, syenites, rarely in felsic volcanics, granite pegmatites and schist. It occurs in banded iron formations as the asbestiform variety &quot;crocidolite&quot; (blue asbestos). It occurs in association with aegirine, nepheline, albite, arfvedsonite in igneous rocks; with tremolite, ferro-actinolite in metamorphic rocks; and with grunerite, magnetite, hematite, stilpnomelane, ankerite, siderite, calcite, chalcedonic quartz in iron formations.

==Riebeckite granite==

The riebeckite granite known as &quot;ailsite&quot;, found on the island of Ailsa Craig in western Scotland, is prized for its use in the manufacture of curling stones.

Riebeckite granite was used for the facing stones of the Canton Viaduct from Moyles Quarry (a.k.a. Canton Viaduct Quarry) now part of Borderland State Park in Massachusetts, US. The commonwealth&#x27;s name is even taken from an Algonquian word for the Great Blue Hill, which got its color from this form of granite.

== Crocidolite (fibrous riebeckite) ==
The fibrous forms of riebeckite are known as &quot;crocidolite&quot; and are one of the six recognised types of asbestos. Often referred to as blue asbestos, it is considered the most hazardous. The association between blue asbestos and mesothelioma was established by J. C. Wagner, C. A. Sleggs, and P. Marchand by 1960.

Crocidolite asbestos was mined in South Africa, Bolivia, and Wittenoom, Western Australia. Bolivian crocidolite was used in approximately 13 billion Kent Micronite cigarette filters, manufactured from March 1952 until at least May 1956 by the Lorillard Tobacco Company (now part of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company). Blue asbestos was also used to similar effect, and hazard, in early gas masks.

<doc id="1227024" wikidata="Q3108932" url="?curid=1227024" title="Global Challenge">
<text>The Global Challenge (not to be confused with Global Challenge Award) was a round the world yacht race run by Challenge Business, the company started by Sir Chay Blyth in 1989. It was held every four years, and took a fleet of one-design steel yachts, crewed by ordinary men and women who have paid to take part, round Cape Horn and through the Southern Ocean where winds can reach . The fee for the last race proposed (in 2008) was £28,750. It was unique in that the race took the westabout route around the world against prevailing winds and currents – often referred to as the ‘wrong way’ route.

The route of the race covered a distance of some . It changed to accommodate different ports of call, but in 2004/5 started from Portsmouth (UK) and stopped at Buenos Aires (ARG), Wellington (NZ), Sydney (AUS), Cape Town (SA), Boston (USA) and La Rochelle (FRA) before returning again to Portsmouth.

The event claimed the motto “The World’s Toughest Yacht Race” and was the ultimate sailing challenge for amateur sailors. The official charity for the races was Save the Children and the race patron was The Princess Royal.

After failing to secure a title sponsor, the company went into administration on 9 October 2006 appointing Grant Thornton as administrators and placing the future of the race in doubt. The fleet was then put up for sale.

==Background==
The seeds of the race were sown in Blyth&#x27;s previous sailing exploits. In 1970/71 he became the first person to sail alone round the world westabout in the yacht &quot;British Steel&quot;. The practicality of training people who had never sailed before was demonstrated during the 1973/74 Whitbread Around the World race, when Blyth had raced &quot;Great Britain II&quot; with a crew from the Parachute Regiment. Subsequently, he ran charters for paying crew.

The design philosophy for the identical yachts used on the Global Challenge races was forged by Blyth&#x27;s longtime associate Andrew Roberts. It was his idea to start from the largest top-action production winch available, which would in turn dictate sail area, displacement and size. He also oversaw the build of the two fleets of steel cutters used in the four races to date to designs by David Thomas and Thanos Condylis (Challenge 67) and Rob Humphreys (Challenge 72).

==British Steel Challenge 1992/3==

The first race started from Southampton in September 1992 with 10 identical boats sailed by a skipper and 13 crew. There were a number of serious rigging screw failures in the Southern Ocean and &quot;British Steel II &quot;, after the initial success of winning the first leg of the race, was dismasted in mid-Southern Ocean, but managed to motorsail safely to Hobart under jury rig. She was re-rigged in time to rejoin the race for the next leg to Cape Town.

The winner of the first race was John Chittenden and crew in &quot;Nuclear Electric&quot;. Chittenden went on to win the 2001 Yachtsman of the Year Award.
==BT Global Challenge 1996/7==
An expanded fleet of 14 Challenge 67 yachts set out from Southampton in driving rain and gales. Again rigging problems struck in the Southern Ocean and &quot;Concert &quot; was dismasted. Skipper Chris Tibbs and crew made a jury rig and motorsailed to Wellington, New Zealand. &quot;Concert &quot; was re-rigged in time to start leg 3 from Wellington to Sydney and was 2nd on the Sydney to Cape Town leg. Yacht &quot;Pause to Remember&quot;, skippered by Tom O&#x27;Connor, suffered a snapped boom halfway between Sydney and Cape Town. There seemed no choice but to fly their trysail until crewmembers Graham Phelp and Matthew Reeves took on the challenge of trying to repair it by using a cut out section as a splint. Two days later a shortened boom emerged from below decks and was successfully attached to the mast. Three weeks later and having suffered several storms with wind speeds in excess of , Pause to Remember sailed into Cape Town, with boom still intact.

This race featured an extra leg to Boston and a crew of disabled men and women took part on “Time &amp; Tide”, the first to sail round the world.

Mike Golding dominated, winning five out of six legs in &quot;Group 4&quot; with Andy Hindley winning the remaining leg in &quot;Save the Children &quot;. Three skippers had graduated from being crew volunteers four years earlier: Andy Hindley; Mark Lodge; and Simon Walker, all of whom appeared in the top five placings. Simon Walker went on to become Managing Director of Challenge Business, helping to organise the 2000/1 and 2004/5 Global Challenges.
==BT Global Challenge 2000/1==

On 10 September, a new fleet of steel cutters made their debut in this race. The winner, Conrad Humphreys and crew on &quot;LG Flatron&quot;, won four of the seven legs.

For the first time the race was scored on points, with equal points for each leg, though combined elapsed times are shown here for comparison.
* These teams did not finish all legs, a requirement for a position in the overall standings, but their positions are shown without displacing any other team

The same fleet of yachts sailed again in the 2004 race, and the winner was the Australian skipper Andy Forbes and his crew on &quot;BG SPIRIT &quot;, who won three of the seven legs. Once again, although the overall safety record of the race was very good, medical emergencies did unfold, most notably onboard yachts &#x27;Imagine It. Done.&#x27;, &#x27;Team Stelmar&#x27; (with TWO separate medical evacuations), and &#x27;Save The Children&#x27;. In the case of &#x27;Imagine It. Done.&#x27;, only an extraordinary combined effort of several yachts within the fleet, the doctor onboard (Dr Roche), and the efforts of the Westpac Rescue team saved the life of John Masters. &#x27;Team Stelmar&#x27; suffered both their medical evacuations in the Southern Oceans on the BA – Wellington leg, costing them a detour and 17 more days at sea, making the leg instead of and 52 days at sea. They carried on with 3 crew down crossing the Southern Ocean alone, set the 24-hour record for that leg and finished 11th due to the retirement of &#x27;Imagine It. Done.&#x27; Team Stelmar later went on to set the overall 24-hour race record during the penultimate leg of the race between Boston and La Rochelle.

==Specifications of the Challenge 72 one-design==

The current 12-strong race fleet of Challenge 72-footers was developed from the Challenge 67s and was specifically designed to be strong, safe and seaworthy in even the worst conditions and to be self-sufficient for long periods at sea, with enough fuel and water to take their crews safely to a distant port. The yachts were also designed to be relatively easy to sail and handled by crews who are not professional.
The yachts have a snakepit, an unusual feature that allows anyone working the halyards to &#x27;hunker down&#x27; and shelter in strong wind and rain, and, more importantly, from waves washing over the deck.
Designed by Rob Humphreys, the identical steel ocean racing yachts were built by Devonport Yachts in the UK by a new method using a unique flat-pack yacht assembly kit of precision cut laser steel panels.

<doc id="1227025" wikidata="Q1460144" url="?curid=1227025" title="Gouverneur K. Warren">
<text>Gouverneur Kemble Warren (January 8, 1830 – August 8, 1882) was an American civil engineer and United States Army general during the American Civil War. He is best remembered for arranging the last-minute defense of Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg and is often referred to as the &quot;Hero of Little Round Top&quot;. His subsequent service as a corps commander and his remaining military career were ruined during the Battle of Five Forks, when he was relieved of command of the V Corps by Philip Sheridan, who claimed that Warren had moved too slowly. A post-war court of inquiry found that Sheridan&#x27;s relief of Warren was unjustified.

==Early life==
Warren was born in Cold Spring, New York, and named for Gouverneur Kemble, a prominent local Congressman, diplomat, industrialist, and owner of the West Point Foundry. His sister, Emily Warren Roebling, would later play a significant role in building the Brooklyn Bridge. He entered the United States Military Academy across the Hudson River from his hometown at age 16 and graduated second in his class of 44 cadets in 1850. He was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the Corps of Topographical Engineers.

In the Antebellum South, he worked on the Mississippi River, participating in the Pacific Railroad Surveys of possible transcontinental railroad routes, and, in 1857, mapping the Western United States, extensively exploring the vast Nebraska Territory, including Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, part of Montana, and part of Wyoming. He served as the engineer on William S. Harney&#x27;s Battle of Ash Hollow in the Nebraska Territory in 1855, where he saw his first combat.

One region he surveyed was the Minnesota River Valley, a valley much larger than expected from the low-flow Minnesota River. In some places, the valley is 5 miles (8 km) wide and 250 feet (80 m) deep. Warren first explained the region&#x27;s hydrology in 1868, attributing the gorge to a massive river that drained Lake Agassiz between 11,700 and 9,400 years ago. The great river was named Glacial River Warren in his honor after his death.

==American Civil War==
At the start of the war, Warren was a first lieutenant and mathematics instructor at the United States Military Academy. He helped raise a local regiment for service in the U.S. Army and was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 5th New York Infantry Regiment on May 14, 1861. Warren and his regiment saw their first combat at the Battle of Big Bethel in Virginia on June 10, arguably the first major land engagement of the war. He was promoted to colonel and regimental commander on September 10.

In the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, Warren commanded his regiment at the Siege of Yorktown and also assisted the chief topographical engineer of the Army of the Potomac, Brig. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys, by leading reconnaissance missions and drawing detailed maps of appropriate routes for the army in its advance up the Virginia Peninsula. He commanded a small brigade (3rd Brigade, 2nd Division, V Corps) during the Seven Days Battles consisting of his own 5th New York along with the 10th New York. At Gaines Mill, he was bruised in the knee by a shell fragment but remained on the field. He continued to lead the brigade at the Second Battle of Bull Run, suffering heavy casualties in a heroic stand against an overwhelming enemy assault, and at Antietam, where the V Corps was in reserve and saw no combat.
Warren was promoted to brigadier general on September 26, 1862, and he and his brigade went to the Battle of Fredericksburg in December, but again were held in reserve and saw no action. When U.S. Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker reorganized the Army of the Potomac in February 1863, he named Warren his chief topographical engineer and then chief engineer. As chief engineer, Warren was commended for his service in the Battle of Chancellorsville.

At the start of the Gettysburg Campaign, as Confederate General Robert E. Lee began his invasion of Pennsylvania, Warren advised Hooker on the routes the Army should take in pursuit. On the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, July 2, 1863, Warren initiated the defense of Little Round Top, recognizing the importance of the undefended position on the left flank of the U.S. Army and directing, on his initiative, the brigade of Col. Strong Vincent to occupy it just minutes before it was attacked. Warren suffered a minor neck wound during the Confederate assault.

Promoted to major general after Gettysburg (August 8, 1863), Warren commanded the II Corps from August 1863 until March 1864, replacing the wounded Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock, and distinguishing himself at the Battle of Bristoe Station. On March 13, 1865, he was brevetted to major general in the regular army for his actions at Bristoe Station. During the Mine Run Campaign, Warren&#x27;s corps was ordered to attack Lee&#x27;s army. Still, he perceived that a trap had been laid and refused the order from army commander Maj. Gen. George G. Meade. Although initially angry at Warren, Meade acknowledged that he had been right. Upon Hancock&#x27;s return from medical leave and the spring 1864 reorganization of the Army of the Potomac, Warren assumed command of the V Corps and led it through the Overland Campaign, the Siege of Petersburg, and the Appomattox Campaign.

During these Virginia campaigns, Warren established a reputation for bringing his engineering traits of deliberation and caution to the role of an infantry corps commander. He won the Battle of Globe Tavern, August 18 to August 20, 1864, cutting the Weldon Railroad, a vital supply route north to Petersburg. He also won a limited success in the Battle of Peebles&#x27; Farm in September 1864, carrying a part of the Confederate lines protecting supplies moving to Petersburg on the Boydton Plank Road.

The aggressive Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan, a key subordinate of Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, was dissatisfied with Warren&#x27;s performance. He was angry at Warren&#x27;s corps for supposedly obstructing roads after the Battle of the Wilderness and its cautious actions during the Siege of Petersburg. At the beginning of the Appomattox Campaign, Sheridan requested that the VI Corps be assigned to his pursuit of Lee&#x27;s army. Still, Grant insisted that the V Corps was better positioned. He gave Sheridan written permission to relieve Warren if he felt it was justified &quot;for the good of the service&quot;. Grant later wrote in his &quot;Personal Memoirs&quot;,


At the Battle of Five Forks on April 1, 1865, Sheridan judged that the V Corps had moved too slowly into the attack and criticized Warren fiercely for not being at the front of his columns. Warren had been held up, searching for Samuel W. Crawford&#x27;s division, which had gone astray in the woods. But overall, he had handled his corps efficiently, and their attack had carried the day at Five Forks, arguably the pivotal battle of the final days. He even led the final charge, which broke the Confederate lines. Nevertheless, Sheridan relieved Warren of command on the spot. Warren asked Sheridan for reconsideration, who retorted, &quot;Reconsider? Hell, I&#x27;ll never reconsider. Obey the order!&quot; Meade told Warren that he had contemplated his relief for some time, but he relented and later recommended Grant reinstate him as the V Corps commander to ease tensions in the Army. He was assigned to the defenses of Petersburg and then briefly to command of the Department of Mississippi.

==Post-war==
Humiliated by Sheridan, Warren resigned his commission as major general of volunteers due to his disagreement with suppressing the meeting of the Mississippi legislature &quot;by any means necessary&quot; on May 27, 1865. He reverted to his permanent rank as major in the United States Army Corps of Engineers. He served as an engineer for 17 years, building railroads with assignments along the Mississippi River, achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1879. By all accounts, Warren worked with intensity at great sacrifice to himself and his family. But the career that had shown so much promise at Gettysburg was ruined. He urgently requested a court of inquiry to exonerate him from the stigma of Sheridan&#x27;s action. Numerous requests were ignored or refused until Ulysses S. Grant retired from the presidency. President Rutherford B. Hayes ordered a court of inquiry that convened in 1879. After hearing testimony from dozens of witnesses over 100 days, including Grant and Sheridan, the court found that Sheridan&#x27;s relief of Warren had been unjustified. General Winfield Hancock, his former fellow corps commander during the Overland Campaign, initially presided over the court of inquiry held on Governor&#x27;s Island, New York. Sheridan&#x27;s accounts did not hold up to facts established by others, reflected ignorance of Warren&#x27;s movements at Five Forks, and were perceived as reflective of personal animosity. Joshua Chamberlain, the hero of the Little Round Top and former governor of Maine, who commanded a Brigade in Warren&#x27;s corps, gave strong testimony to support Warren. During his testimony, Grant commented that he never doubted Warren&#x27;s courage and tactical skill but wanted his orders followed &quot;promptly&quot; and did not want second-guessing that assumed senior leadership had not considered the options, strongly inferring such insubordination led to Warren&#x27;s relief. His statement was stricken from the record at Grant&#x27;s request, simultaneously with the objection of Warren&#x27;s counsel. On November 21, 1881, President Chester Alan Arthur directed that the findings be published; no other action was taken. Unfortunately for Warren, these results were not published until after his death.

In 1867, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

Warren&#x27;s last assignment in the Army was as district engineer for Newport, Rhode Island, where he died of complications from diabetes on August 8, 1882. He was buried in the Island Cemetery in Newport in civilian clothes and without military honors at his request. His last words were, &quot;The flag! The flag!&quot;

==Legacy==
A bronze statue of Warren stands on Little Round Top in Gettysburg National Military Park. It was created by Karl Gerhardt (1853–1940) and dedicated in 1888. Another bronze statue, by Henry Baerer (1837–1908), was erected in the Grand Army Plaza, Brooklyn, New York. It depicts Warren standing in uniform, with field binoculars on a granite pedestal made of stone quarried at Little Round Top.

Reflecting a pattern of naming many Washington, DC streets in newly developed areas in the Capital after Civil War generals, an east–west street in the Northwest quadrant is named Warren Street, NW.

The United States Army Transport was named for Warren.

The G. K. Warren Prize is awarded approximately every four years by the United States National Academy of Sciences. It is funded by a gift from his daughter, Miss Emily B. Warren, in memory of her father.

Mount Warren in California is named in his honor.

<doc id="1227026" wikidata="Q200929" url="?curid=1227026" title="Marcus Statius Priscus">
<text>Marcus Statius Priscus Licinius Italicus (&quot;M. Statius M. f. Cl. Priscus Licinius Italicus&quot;) was a Roman senator and general active during the reigns of Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius. Contemporary sources refer to him as Marcus Statius Priscus or simply Statius Priscus. He was consul for the year 159 as the colleague of Plautius Quintillus; Priscus was one of only two &quot;homines novi&quot; to attain the ordinary consul in the reigns of Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius.

==Life==
The cursus honorum of Statius Priscus is preserved in an inscription found in Rome. His career began as an equestrian officer, first as &quot;praefectus&quot; or commander of the Cohors IV Lingonum, an &quot;auxilia&quot; nominally one thousand men in strength. Next he was a military tribune in three different legions: Legio III Gallica, Legio X Gemina, and Legio I Adiutrix. It was at this time he received &quot;dona militaria&quot;, or decorations while fighting in the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132–136; Anthony Birley believes Priscus was commissioned with the III Gallica when he earned this distinction. His third step in his equestrian career was as &quot;praefectus&quot; with an ala stationed in Cappadocia. He then advanced from military appointments, and served as procurator of the &quot;vicesima hereditatium&quot; in Gallia Narbonensis and Aquitania.

At this point Statius Priscus entered the Senate. No details are provided, but we can surmise a few details. One is that this happened under emperor Antoninus Pius. Another was that he owed his advance to the patronage of Quintus Lollius Urbicus, of whom Birley writes, &quot;his influence in the 140s was no doubt considerable.&quot; More importantly, instead of being adlected into the Senate at praetorian or even quaestorian rank, he was forced to proceed through the traditional Republican magistracies of &quot;quaestor&quot;, plebeian tribune, and peregrine praetor. &quot;This reflects the conservatism of the reign of Antoninus Pius,&quot; Birley states. &quot;Priscus must have been well over thirty when he entered the senate as a quaestor, and well over fifty when he finally became consul.&quot; It was at this point he was admitted into the priesthood of the sacerdoti Titali. Once praetor, Priscus was commissioned &quot;legatus legionis&quot; or commander of Legio XIV Gemina; Birley suggests this was while Claudius Maximus, a friend of heir apparent Marcus Aurelius governed Pannonia Superior.

Statius Priscus was appointed governor of Dacia between 157 and 158, as attested by a number of surviving military diplomas. Birley notes that Priscus had distinguished himself in Dacia: &quot;he undoubtedly had some military success in Dacia, as a number of inscriptions from that province reveal.&quot; His success was recognized upon his return to Rome, with his ordinary consulship. The following year he was made &quot;curator alvei Tiberis et cloacarum urbis&quot;, the official responsible for maintaining the channels of the Tiber River, as well as the sewers of Rome, but his tenure was brief. Priscus is attested as governor of Moesia Superior by another military diploma dated to February 161, as well as a dedication he erected after the death of Antoninus Pius to the new emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus at Viminacium. The northern frontier of Roman Britain came under threat that required an experienced general, so the new emperors reassigned him there later that year.

He had been in Britain only a few months when a more serious threat presented itself—the war with Parthia. In 162 Vologases IV defeated Marcus Sedatius Severianus in Armenia; Roman Syria was threatened. Priscus was made governor of Cappadocia. His forces, made up of Eastern auxiliaries and several legions transferred from the Rhine and the Danube, quickly crushed the Parthians and destroyed the town of Artaxata. Priscus then installed Sohaemus, who was under the protection of Rome, on the Armenian throne, and rebuilt the city of Valarshapat. The satirist Lucian records how one contemporary historian described &quot;how Priscus the general merely shouted out and 27 of the enemy dropped dead.&quot; Birley comments, &quot;It is foolhardy to try to squeeze some truth out of evidence of this kind, but one might perhaps suppose, at least, that Priscus was a man with an aggressive and boisterous style of leadership.&quot;

According to Cassius Dio, when Avidius Cassius (the governor of Egypt and Syria) was declared emperor by his legions, it was Priscus who informed Emperor Aurelius. Cassius declared himself emperor at the behest of Aurelius&#x27; wife who convinced Cassius and his legions that the emperor had died. Aurelius quickly defeated Cassius and installed Priscus as governor of Syria.

==Family==
Although no wife is attested for Priscus, Giuseppe Camodeca published the inscription of a statue honoring one Fufidia Clementiana, a &quot;clarissima puella&quot;, who is described as the granddaughter of Priscus. This implies he had a daughter, who married Lucius Fufidius Pollio, ordinary consul in 166. There is also a Marcus Statius Longinus, governor of Moesia Inferior under the emperor Macrinus, who is possibly Statius Priscus&#x27; grandson. If Longinus is his grandson, the existence of a son follows.

<text>GRML – an acronym for General Reuse Markup Language – is a markup language similar to HTML and XML, using tags to organize data in files and web pages. Data is organized in columns and rows. Tags are used to define forms, images, and hyper-linking. Its syntax, like HTML, is based on a simplified subset of SGML. GRML is not in very wide use as of May 2005. 

GRML is a data-oriented format which defines data content rather than data presentation; the file or web browser determines how data is displayed. This is the same goal as HTML&#x27;s separating CSS from HTML, moving away from codice_1 tags, but GRML takes it even further. One of the key aims in creating the format was to separate &quot;views&quot; of the data from &quot;forms&quot; used to manipulate it.

It is also a common result of a typographical error when attempting to type HTML, because HT and GR are adjacent on a Qwerty keyboard.

<doc id="1227032" wikidata="Q948351" url="?curid=1227032" title="Jōnan-ku, Fukuoka">
<text>is one of the seven wards of Fukuoka City, Japan. As of November 1, 2004, it had a population of 128,057 people, making up 9.2% of Fukuoka City, with an area of 16.02 km2. At the time of Fukuoka City&#x27;s official designation as a City in 1972, the area now known as Jōnan-ku was part of the larger ward of Nishi-ku. On May 1, 1982, Nishi-ku was subdivided into the three smaller wards of Nishi-ku, Sawara-ku and Jōnan-ku.

Located southwest of the downtown area of Tenjin, Jōnan-ku is a primarily residential area. Despite its proximity to downtown Fukuoka, Jōnan-ku has suffered from a lack of transport infrastructure, leading to congested roads and difficult access to the rest of the city. The Nanakuma Line of the Fukuoka Subway opened in 2005, improving traffic flow in the area.

Like most of Fukuoka City, the construction in Jōnan-ku is relatively recent, as the area consisted mostly of fields after World War 2, lacking even paved roads. The result has been a crowded jumble of roads, houses, apartment buildings and businesses, with no real centre to the ward. A few large parks help to create a peaceful atmosphere.

Jōnan-ku is home to Fukuoka University, whose students are everpresent during the school year and help support a growing number of local convenience stores. The St Sulpice Great Seminary of Fukuoka is another notable landmark, having been built in the 1950s and serving to train Japanese Catholic priests from Kyūshū.

Historical sites include Kikuchi Shrine and Yūsentei Park.

<text>The Harmelen train disaster, on 8 January 1962, was the worst railway accident in the history of the Netherlands. Harmelen, in the central Netherlands, is the location of a railway junction where a branch to Amsterdam leaves the Rotterdam to Utrecht line. It is common at high-speed junctions to avoid the use of diamond crossings wherever possibleinstead, a ladder crossing is employed where trains destined for the branch line cross over to the track normally employed for trains travelling in the opposite direction for a short distance before taking the branch line.

The accident happened 18 months after the Woerden train accident, the derailment of a British furlough train nearby. Previously, the Weesp train disaster of 1918 had been the worst railway disaster in the Netherlands.

==Collision==
Shortly before 9.20 a.m. on Monday, 8 January 1962, a foggy day, a Rotterdam to Amsterdam local-train consisting of electric multiple unit sets 700 and 297 was authorised to carry out this manoeuvre, protected by a red signal to stop trains approaching from Utrecht. The EMU was travelling at approximately 75 km/h (47 mph). Simultaneously, an express train from Leeuwarden to Rotterdam, hauled by electric locomotive 1131, was approaching at 107 km/h (67 mph). 

Perhaps because of the foggy weather, the driver of the train from Utrecht missed the warning yellow signal and applied the emergency brake when he saw the red signal protecting the junction, far too late to prevent a near head-on collision between the two trains. Six coaches of the Amsterdam train and three on the express train were destroyed.

== Victims ==
Both trains were heavily packed180 occupants in the six-carriage multiple units and circa 900 aboard the 11-carriage express train, made up of seven recent vehicles and five old Mat &#x27;24 trailers. Of approximately 1080 people aboard the trains, 93 lost their lives, including the drivers of both trains.

== Aftermath ==

The collision spurred the installation on Dutch railways of the system of automatic train protection known as &quot;Automatische treinbeïnvloeding&quot; (ATB), which automatically overrides the driver in such a &quot;signal passed at danger&quot; situation.

The junction was later rebuilt as a flying junction in the 1990s.

== Memorial ==

On 8 January 2012, Pieter van Vollenhoven unveiled a memorial for the victims of the disaster, which on that day had taken place exactly 50 years earlier. The organization of the disclosure was owned by the local &quot;Dorpsplatform&quot; Harmelen. 

The monument was designed by , an artist from Kamerik. The mason was Maurice van Dam from Woerden. The design consists of two stone slabs that are tilted relative to each other and contain the names of the 93 victims. Looking through the two slabs discloses the actual spot where the collision happened. A red stone plinth, bearing a body that represents the victims, is placed in the middle in front of the two slabs. Three names on the slabs were spelled incorrectly; the names are copied from contemporary handwritten police reports. The mistakes have since been corrected.

<text>Sir Charles Blyth (born 14 May 1940), known as Chay Blyth, is a Scottish yachtsman and rower. He was the first person to sail single-handed non-stop westwards around the world (1971), on a 59-foot boat called &quot;British Steel&quot;.

==Early life==
Blyth was born in Hawick, Roxburghshire. He joined the Parachute Regiment when he was 18 and was promoted to Sergeant at the age of 21.

==Rowing and sailing career==
==Business career==
Blyth founded a company named Challenge Business to organise the 1992/1993 British Steel Challenge in 1989. This event allowed novices to sail around the world in a professionally organised race. After the British Steel Challenge, Global Challenge organized other Round the World yacht races. 

The British Steel Challenge was followed by two successive BT Global Challenge races in 1996/97 and 2000/01. However, a downturn in the sponsorship market meant that the 2004/2005 Global Challenge race set off without a title sponsor. In September 2007, Challenge Business went into administration, when Blyth had been unable to find a sponsor for the 2008-09 Global Challenge Race.

While chairman of Challenge Business, Blyth was the mentor for Dee Caffari on her successful bid to be the first woman to sail around the world against the prevailing winds and currents in 2005–2006.

As chairman of Inspiring Performance, Blyth also headed the board of directors of the train operating company First Great Western – Greater Western franchise. He became non-executive chairman of the franchise which was formed to run a new and enlarged service from 1 April 2006. The franchise combines the previous First Great Western, First Great Western Link and Wessex Trains franchises.
==Awards and accolades==
*In the 1997 Birthday Honours, Blyth was created a Knight Bachelor for services to sailing.
*A street has been named after him in his birth town of Hawick, known as &quot;Chay Blyth Place&quot;.
*3rd Worthing Scout Groups Blyth Cub Pack is named after him.
*Awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Technology from Plymouth University in 1994.
*The Chartered Institute of Marketing awarded The Companion of Honour to Sir Chay in 2000 for his services to the Profession of Marketing.

<doc id="1227040" wikidata="Q157212" url="?curid=1227040" title="Odd Hassel">
<text>Odd Hassel (17 May 1897 – 11 May 1981) was a Norwegian physical chemist and Nobel Laureate.

==Biography==
Hassel was born in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway. His parents were Ernst Hassel (1848–1905), a gynaecologist, and Mathilde Klaveness (1860–1955). In 1915, he entered the University of Oslo where he studied mathematics, physics and chemistry, and graduated in 1920. Victor Goldschmidt was Hassel&#x27;s tutor when he began studies in Oslo, while Heinrich Jacob Goldschmidt, Victor&#x27;s father, was Hassel&#x27;s thesis advisor. Father and son were important figures in Hassel&#x27;s life and they remained friends. After taking a year off from studying, he went to Munich, Germany to work in the laboratory of Professor Kasimir Fajans.

His work there led to the detection of absorption indicators. After moving to Berlin, he worked at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, where he began to do research on X-ray crystallography. He furthered his research with a Rockefeller Fellowship, obtained with the help of Fritz Haber. In 1924, he obtained his PhD from Humboldt University of Berlin, before moving to his alma mater, the University of Oslo, where he worked from 1925 through 1964. He became a professor in 1934.

His work was interrupted in October, 1943 when he and other university staff members were arrested by the Nasjonal Samling and handed over to the occupation authorities. He spent time in several detention camps, until he was released in November, 1944.

==Work==

Hassel originally focused on inorganic chemistry, but beginning in 1930 his work concentrated on problems connected with molecular structure, particularly the structure of cyclohexane and its derivatives. He introduced the Norwegian scientific community to the concepts of the electric dipole moments and electron diffraction. The work for which he is best known established the three-dimensionality of molecular geometry. He focused his research on ring-shaped carbon molecules, which he suspected filled three dimensions instead of two, the common belief of the time. By using the number of bonds between the carbon and hydrogen atoms, Hassel demonstrated the impossibility of the molecules existing on only one plane. This discovery led to him being awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 1969.

==Honors==
Hassel was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1969, shared with English chemist Derek Barton.

He received the Guldberg-Waage Medal (&quot;Guldberg-Waage Medal&quot;) from the Norwegian Chemical Society and the Gunnerus Medal from the Royal Norwegian Society of Science and Letters, both in 1964.

Hassel held honorary degrees from the University of Copenhagen (1950) and University of Stockholm (1960). An annual lecture named in his honor is given at the University of Oslo.

He was an honorary Fellow of the Norwegian Chemical Society, Chemical Society of London, Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters and Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

He was made a Knight of the Order of St. Olav in 1960.

<doc id="1227041" wikidata="Q2339798" url="?curid=1227041" title="Original six frigates of the United States Navy">
<text>The United States Congress authorized the original six frigates of the United States Navy with the Naval Act of 1794 on March 27, 1794, at a total cost of $688,888.82 (equivalent to $ in ). These ships were built during the formative years of the United States Navy, on the recommendation of designer Joshua Humphreys for a fleet of frigates powerful enough to engage any frigates of the French or British navies, yet fast enough to evade any ship of the line.

One of these original six, the , is still in commission and is the world&#x27;s oldest commissioned naval warship still afloat.

== Purpose ==
After the Revolutionary War, a heavily indebted United States disbanded the Continental Navy, and in August 1785, lacking funds for ship repairs, sold its last remaining warship, the . But almost simultaneously troubles began in the Mediterranean when Algiers seized two American merchant ships and held their crews for ransom. Minister to France Thomas Jefferson suggested an American naval force to protect American shipping in the Mediterranean, but his recommendations were initially met with indifference, as were the recommendations of John Jay, who proposed building five 40-gun warships. Shortly afterward, Portugal began blockading Algerian ships from entering the Atlantic Ocean, thus providing temporary protection for American merchant ships.

Piracy against American merchant shipping had not been a problem when under the protection of the British Empire prior to the Revolution, but after the Revolutionary War the &quot;Barbary States&quot; of Algiers, Tripoli, and Tunis felt they could harass American merchant ships without penalty. Additionally, once the French Revolution started, Britain and France each began interdicting American merchant ships suspected of trading with the other. Lacking a proper navy, the American government could do little to prevent such seizures.

The formation of a naval force had been a topic of debate in the new American republic for years. Opponents argued that building a navy would only lead to calls for a navy department, and the staff to operate it. This would further lead to more appropriations of funds, which would eventually spiral out of control, giving birth to a &quot;self-feeding entity&quot;. Those opposed to a navy felt that payment of tribute to the Barbary States and economic sanctions against Britain were a better alternative.

In 1793, Portugal reached a peace agreement with Algeria, ending its blockade of the Mediterranean, thus allowing Algerian ships back into the Atlantic Ocean. By late in the year, eleven American merchant ships had been captured. This, combined with the actions of Britain, finally led President Washington to request Congress to authorize a navy.

On January 2, 1794, by a narrow margin of 46–44, the House of Representatives voted to authorize building a navy and formed a committee to determine the size, cost, and type of ships to be built. Secretary of War Henry Knox submitted proposals to the committee outlining the design and cost of warships. To appease the strong opposition to the upcoming bill, the Federalist Party inserted a clause into the bill that would bring an abrupt halt to the construction of the ships should the United States reach a peace agreement with Algiers.

The bill was presented to the House on March 10 and passed as the Naval Act of 1794 by a margin of 50–39, and without division in the Senate on March 19. President Washington signed the Act on March 27. It provided for acquisition, by purchase or otherwise, of four ships to carry forty-four guns each, and two ships to carry thirty-six guns each. It also provided pay and sustenance for naval officers, sailors and marines, and outlined how each ship should be manned in order to operate them. The Act appropriated $688,888.82 (equivalent to $ in ) to finance the work.

==Design and preparations==
With the formation of a Department of the Navy still several years away, responsibility for design and construction fell to the Department of War, headed by Secretary Henry Knox. As early as 1790 Knox had consulted various authorities regarding ship design. Discussions of the designs were carried out in person at meetings in Philadelphia. Little is known about these discussions due to a lack of written correspondence, making determination of the actual designers involved difficult to assemble. Secretary Knox reached out to ship architects and builders in Philadelphia, which was the largest seaport in North America at the time and possibly the largest freshwater port in the world. This meant that many discussions of ship design took place in Knox&#x27;s office, resulting in few if any records of these discussions being available to historians. Joshua Humphreys is generally credited as the designer of the six frigates, but Revolutionary War ship captains John Foster Williams and John Barry and shipbuilders Josiah Fox and James Hackett also were consulted.

The final design plans submitted to President Washington for approval called for building new frigates rather than purchasing merchant ships and converting them into warships, an option under the Naval Act. The designers realized that the fledgling United States could not match the European states in the number of ships afloat. Nevertheless, this gave the Americans the distinct advantage in that their ship design was not constrained by access to timber nor limited crew. This allowed the designers to plan for enormous ships given their role. They had the ability to overpower other frigates, but were capable of a speed to escape from a ship of the line. The design was unusual for the time, being deep, long on keel and narrow of beam (width); mounting very heavy guns; incorporating a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme aimed at limiting hogging; while giving the ships extremely heavy planking. This gave the hull greater strength than the hulls of other navies&#x27; frigates. Knox advised President Washington that the cost of new construction would likely exceed the appropriations of the Naval Act. Despite this, Washington accepted and approved the plans the same day they were submitted, April 15, 1794.

Joshua Humphreys was appointed Master Constructor of the ships. An experienced draftsman, Josiah Fox, was hired into the War Department to put plans to paper. However, Fox disagreed with the large dimensions of the design and, according to Humphreys, attempted to downsize the measurements while producing his drafts. This incensed Humphreys enough that Fox was soon assigned to the mold loft with William Doughty.

After or simultaneously with the creation of the drawings, a builder&#x27;s half model was assembled from which measurements were taken to create molds of the timbers. In a process known as &quot;molding&quot;, the dimensions of the framing pieces were chalked onto the floor of a mold loft where a template was formed using strips of light wood. Once the molds were transported to the timber crews, the templates were used to select the part of a tree that closely matched the template. From there the timber was felled and roughed out close to the required dimensions, then numbered for identification and loaded onto a ship for transport. An additional set of more detailed molds was required for each frigate for the construction crews to follow.

==Construction==
Secretary Knox suggested to President Washington that six different construction sites be used, one for each ship, rather than building at one particular shipyard. Separate locations enabled the allotted funds to stimulate each local economy, and Washington approved the sites on April 15, 1794. At each site, a civilian naval constructor was hired to direct the work. Navy captains were appointed as superintendents, one for each of the six frigates as follows:

Humphreys wished to use the most durable materials available for construction, primarily white pine, longleaf pine, white oak, and, most importantly, southern live oak. Live oak was used for framing as it was a strong, dense, and long-lasting wood weighing up to 75 lb per cubic foot (1,200 kg/m3) when freshly cut. The live oak tree grows primarily in coastal areas of the United States from Virginia to Texas, with the most suitable timber found in the coastal areas of Georgia near St. Simons. This desire for live oak was the primary cause of delays in the frigates&#x27; construction. Appropriated funds from the Naval Act were not available until June 1794. Shipbuilder John T. Morgan was hired by the War Department to procure the live oak and supervise the cutting and crews. Morgan wrote to Humphreys in August reporting that it had hardly ceased raining since his arrival and &quot;the whole country is almost under water&quot;. Captain John Barry was sent to check up on progress in early October; he found Morgan and several persons sick with malaria. Timber cutting finally began when the crews arrived on the 22nd. The earliest delivery of timber occurred in Philadelphia on December 18, but another load of live oak destined for New York was lost when its cargo ship sank. Delays continued to plague the timber cutting and delivery operations throughout 1795. By December of that year all six keels had been laid down, though the frigates were still unframed and far from finished.

Construction of the frigates slowly continued until the 1796 announcement of the Treaty of Tripoli, which was witnessed by Algiers. In accordance with the clause in the Naval Act, construction of the frigates was to be discontinued. However, President Washington instead requested instructions from Congress on how to proceed. Several proposals circulated before a final decision was reached allowing Washington to complete two of the 44-gun and one of the 36-gun frigates. The three frigates nearest to completion, &quot;United States&quot;, &quot;Constellation&quot; and &quot;Constitution&quot;, were chosen. Construction of &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, &quot;Congress&quot;, and &quot;President&quot; was halted, and some of their construction materials were sold or placed in storage.

The earlier predictions of Henry Knox regarding costs of the frigates came to a head in early 1797. Of the original appropriation of $688,888.82, only about $24,000 remained. Secretary of War James McHenry requested of Congress an additional $200,000, but only $172,000 was appropriated. The additional funds were enough to finish the three frigates&#x27; construction, but did not allow them to be manned and put to sea. &quot;United States&quot; launched on May 10, &quot;Constellation&quot; on September 7, and &quot;Constitution&quot; on October 21. Meanwhile, interference with American shipping by France because of their disagreement over the Jay Treaty prompted Congress to debate authorizing completion and manning of the three frigates. Secretary McHenry reported that an additional $200,000 would be required for this stage of construction, touching off grumbling in Congress over the escalating costs. Nevertheless, on July 1, Congress approved the completion and appropriated the requested funds.

When the next session of Congress convened in November, Secretary McHenry again requested funds to complete the three frigates. Though upset over the escalating costs, Congress approved an additional $115,833, but simultaneously launched an investigation into possible waste or fraud in the frigate program. On March 22, 1798, McHenry turned over a report outlining several main reasons for cost escalations: problems procuring the live oak; the logistics of supplying six separate shipyards; and fires, yellow fever, and bad weather. Additional inquiries prior to McHenry&#x27;s report revealed that the War Department used substandard bookkeeping practices, and that the authorized funds had to be released by the Treasury Department, resulting in delays, causing waste. These problems led to the formation of the Department of the Navy on April 30.

Simultaneously, relations with France soured even further when President John Adams informed Congress of the XYZ Affair. In response, on May 28, Congress authorized vessels of the United States to capture any armed French vessels lying off the coast of the United States. As &quot;Constellation&quot;, &quot;Constitution&quot; and &quot;United States&quot; were still fitting out, the first U.S. Navy vessel to put to sea for this undeclared Quasi-War was the sloop with Richard Dale in command. Finally, on July 16, Congress appropriated $600,000 for completion of the remaining three frigates; &quot;Congress&quot; launched on August 15, 1799, &quot;Chesapeake&quot; on December 2, and &quot;President&quot; on April 10, 1800.

==Armament==


The 44-gun ships sometimes carried over 50 guns, and &quot;Constitution&quot; was known to carry 24-pounder guns in her main battery instead of the normal 18-pounders most frigates carried.

The Naval Act of 1794 had specified 36-gun frigates in addition to the 44s, but at some point the 36s were re-rated as 38s. Their &quot;ratings&quot; by number of guns were meant only as an approximation.

Ships of this era usually had no permanent battery of guns, as modern navy ships carry. The guns and cannons were designed to be completely portable, and often were exchanged between ships or shore as situations warranted. Each commanding officer generally outfitted armaments to his liking, taking into consideration factors such as the overall tonnage of cargo, complement of personnel on board, and planned routes to be sailed. Consequently, the armaments on ships would change many times during their careers, and records of the changes were not generally kept.

Commonly, twelve men and a powder-boy were required to operate each gun. If needed, some men were designated to take stations as boarders, to man the bilge pumps, or to fight fires. Guns were normally manned on the engaged side only; if a ship engaged two opponents, gun crews had to be divided. All of the guns were capable of using several different kinds of projectiles: round shot, chain or bar shot, grape shot, and heated shot. Each gun was mounted on a wooden gun carriage controlled by an arrangement of rope and tackle. The captain ordered the gun crews to either open fire together in a single broadside, or allowed each crew to fire at will as the target came close alongside. The gun captain pulled the lanyard to trip the flintlock which sent a spark into the pan. The ignited powder in the pan sent a flame through the priming tube to set off the powder charge in the gun and hurl its projectile at the enemy.

The marine detachment on board provided the naval infantry that manned the fighting tops, armed with muskets to fire down onto the decks of the enemy ship.

==Frigates==
The frigates were originally designated by the letters A through F until March 1795, when Secretary of War, Timothy Pickering, prepared a list of ten suggested names for the ships (in addition to those later used, the list also included &quot;Defender&quot;, &quot;Fortitude&quot;, &quot;Perseverance&quot;, &quot;Protector&quot;, and &quot;Liberty&quot;). President Washington was responsible for selecting five of the names: &quot;Constitution&quot;, &quot;United States&quot;, &quot;President&quot;, and &quot;Congress&quot;, each of which represented a principle of the United States Constitution, together with &quot;Constellation&quot; which derived from the blazon of the Arms of the United States, &quot;13 stars, forming a constellation.&quot; The sixth frigate, &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, remained nameless until 1799, when Secretary of the Navy, Benjamin Stoddert, designated her a namesake of the Chesapeake Bay, ignoring the previous Constitutional naming protocol.

===&quot;United States&quot;===
 was built in Philadelphia, launched on May 10, 1797, and commissioned on July 11, 1797. On October 25, 1812, &quot;United States&quot; fought and captured the frigate . &quot;United States&quot; was decommissioned on February 24, 1849, and put in reserve at Norfolk, Virginia. In 1861, while still in reserve at Norfolk, the ship was seized and commissioned into the Confederate States Navy, which later scuttled the ship. In 1862, Union forces raised the scuttled ship and retained control until she was broken up in 1865.
===&quot;Constellation&quot;===

 was built in Baltimore and launched on September 7, 1797. On February 9, 1799, she fought and captured the French frigate &quot;Insurgente&quot;. This was the first major victory by an American-designed and -built warship. In February 1800, &quot;Constellation&quot; fought the . Although &quot;Vengeance&quot; was not captured or sunk, she was so badly damaged that her captain intentionally grounded the ship to prevent her from sinking. &quot;Constellation&quot; was struck in 1853 and broken up. During construction of a new in 1854, it was claimed that it was a &quot;repair&quot; of the original ship (a common dodge of the time for political reasons) leading to uncertainty over which ship was preserved in Baltimore until it was proven in 1999 to be the second &quot;Constellation&quot;.

===&quot;Constitution&quot;===
, rated at 44 guns, launched from Edmund Hartt&#x27;s shipyard in Boston on October 21, 1797, by naval constructor George Claghorn and Captain Samuel Nicholson. During the Quasi-War she captured the French merchant ship &quot;Niger&quot;, and was later involved in battling the Barbary pirates in the First Barbary War.

She is most well known for her actions during the War of 1812 against Britain, when she captured numerous merchant ships and defeated four British warships: , , , and . The battle with the &quot;Guerriere&quot; earned her the nickname of &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; and public adoration that has repeatedly saved her from scrapping. She continued to actively serve the nation as flagship in the Mediterranean and African squadrons and made a circumnavigation of the world in the 1840s. During the American Civil War she served as a training ship for the United States Naval Academy and carried artwork and industrial displays to the Paris Exposition of 1878. Retired from active service in 1881, she served as a receiving ship until designated a museum ship in 1907. In 1931 she made a three-year, 90-port tour of the nation, and in 1997 after a comprehensive restoration to her 1812 configuration she finally sailed again under her own power for her 200th birthday.

The oldest commissioned warship afloat in the world, &quot;Constitution&quot; is berthed at the Charlestown Navy Yard in Massachusetts and is used to promote understanding of the Navy&#x27;s role in war and peace through educational outreach, historic demonstration, and active participation in public events. &quot;Constitution&quot; is open to visitors year-round, providing tours, with the USS &quot;Constitution&quot; Museum nearby.

===&quot;Chesapeake&quot;===


 was built at the Gosport Navy Yard, Virginia, and was launched on December 2, 1799. The &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was the only one of the six frigates to be disowned by Humphreys due to liberties taken by her Master Constructor Josiah Fox during construction relating to overall dimensions. The frigate that became was originally planned as a 44-gun ship, but when her construction began in 1798 Josiah Fox altered the original design plan, resulting in the ship&#x27;s re-rating to 36 guns. Fox&#x27;s reason for making the alteration is not clear, but may be attributed to construction materials that were diverted to complete . Additionally, Fox and Humphreys had earlier disagreed over the design of the six frigates, and Fox may have taken opportunities during construction to make alterations to his own liking. Regardless, the plan for the redesigned frigate was approved by Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert.

When construction finished on &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, she had the smallest dimensions of all six frigates. A length of between perpendiculars and of beam contrasted with the other two 36-gun frigates, and &quot;Constellation&quot;, which were built to in length and of beam.

On June 22, 1807, what has become known as the &quot;Chesapeake&quot;–&quot;Leopard&quot; affair occurred when the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was fired upon by for refusing to comply with a demand to permit a search for deserters from the Royal Navy. After several quick broadsides from &quot;Leopard&quot;, to which the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; replied with only one gun, the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; struck her colors. HMS &quot;Leopard&quot; refused the surrender, searched the &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, captured four alleged deserters, and sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was captured on June 1, 1813, by shortly after sailing from Boston, Massachusetts. Taken into Royal Navy service, she was later sold, and broken up at Portsmouth, England, in 1820 (with a good deal of her timbers being made into a watermill).

===&quot;Congress&quot;===

—rated at 38 guns—was launched on August 15, 1799, from Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, under the command of Captain James Sever. Beginning her maiden voyage on January 6, 1800, she headed for the East Indies, but soon after her masts were destroyed in a gale, forcing her return to port; repairs took six months. She sailed again on July 26 for the West Indies and made uneventful patrols through April 1801.

Under the command of John Rodgers, &quot;Congress&quot; sailed for the Mediterranean in June 1804 and performed services during the First Barbary War. She assumed blockade duties off Tripoli and participated in the capture of a xebec in October. In July 1805, she helped to blockade Tunisia, and in September of that year carried the Tunisian ambassador back to Washington, D.C. Afterward, she served as a classroom for midshipman training through 1807.

Under the command of Captain John Smith during the War of 1812, she made three extended cruises in company with &quot;President&quot; and briefly with &quot;United States&quot;. She was part of a pursuit of a fleet of British merchant ships and assisted &quot;President&quot; in the attempted capture of . On the return voyage, &quot;Congress&quot; and &quot;President&quot; captured seven merchant ships. &quot;Congress&quot;&#x27; second cruise began in October 1812, and she pursued and captured the merchant ship &quot;Argo&quot;. Arriving back in Boston on December 31, she assisted in capturing eight additional merchant ships. After repairs, she sailed in company with &quot;President&quot; on April 30, 1813, and pursued , which escaped. Setting off on her own, she made a lengthy voyage off the Cape Verde Islands and the coast of Brazil. During this long cruise she captured only four small merchant ships, returning home in late 1813. Because of a lack of materials to repair her, she was placed in reserve for the remainder of the war.

In 1815 she returned to active service for the Second Barbary War under Captain Charles Morris, and in August &quot;Congress&quot; joined a squadron and began patrol duties, subsequently making appearances off Tripoli and Tunis. Returning to Boston, she decommissioned in December. She patrolled against piracy in the Gulf of Mexico from December 1816 to July 1817 and made a voyage to South America in 1818. Early in 1819 she made a voyage to China, becoming the first U.S. warship to visit that country. In 1822 she served as the flagship of James Biddle, combating piracy in the West Indies. Under Biddle she made a voyage to Spain and Argentina. She began serving as a receiving ship in 1824 and remained on that duty until ordered broken up in 1834.

===&quot;President&quot;===

Minor alterations were made to &quot;President&quot; based on experience gained in constructing the 44-gun ships &quot;Constitution&quot; and &quot;United States&quot;. Humphreys instructed &quot;President&quot;&#x27;s naval contractor to raise the gun deck by and move the mainmast farther aft. In the case of &quot;President&quot;, construction was begun at New York in the shipyard of Foreman Cheesman and work on her was discontinued in 1796. Construction resumed in 1798, under Christian Bergh and naval constructor William Doughty.

Rated at 44 guns, was the last frigate to be completed, launching from New York City on April 10, 1800, with Captain Thomas Truxtun in command. She departed for patrols during the Quasi-War on August 5 and recaptured several American merchant ships. After the peace treaty, she returned to the United States in March 1801.

In May 1801 she sailed under the command of Richard Dale for service in the First Barbary War. She made appearances off Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, capturing a Greek vessel with Tripolitan soldiers aboard and participating in a prisoner exchange. She returned to the United States on April 14, 1802, then left for a second patrol on the Barbary coast in 1804 under the command of Samuel Barron. In company with &quot;Congress&quot;, &quot;Constellation&quot;, and &quot;Constitution&quot;, &quot;President&quot; experienced a mostly uneventful tour, assisting in the capture of three vessels, performing blockade duties, and undergoing two changes of commanding officers. She sailed for home on July 13, 1805, carrying with her many sailors released from captivity in Tripoli.

On May 16, 1811, in what became known as the Little Belt affair, &quot;President&quot;, under the command of Captain John Rodgers, mistakenly identified as the frigate while searching for impressed American sailors taken by the Royal Navy. Though the sequence of events is disputed on both sides, both ships discharged cannon for several minutes before Rodgers determined that &quot;Little Belt&quot; was a much smaller ship than &quot;Guerriere&quot;. &quot;Little Belt&quot; suffered serious damage and thirty-one killed or wounded in the exchange. Rodgers offered assistance to &quot;Little Belt&quot;″s Captain Arthur Bingham, but he declined and sailed off for Halifax, Nova Scotia. The U.S. and Royal Navy investigations each determined the other ship to be responsible for the attack, increasing tensions leading up to the War of 1812.

Still under the command of John Rodgers, &quot;President&quot; made three extended cruises during the War of 1812 in company with &quot;Congress&quot; and briefly with &quot;United States&quot;. &quot;President&quot; encountered and engaged in a fight from which &quot;Belvidera&quot; eventually escaped. Pursuing a fleet of merchant ships, &quot;President&quot; sailed to within a day&#x27;s journey of the English Channel before returning to Boston, capturing seven merchant ships en route. Her second cruise began with a pursuit of and , but she failed to overtake either of them. Later prizes were the packet ship &quot;Swallow&quot;, carrying a large amount of currency, and eight other merchant ships. &quot;President&quot; returned on December 31. Her third cruise of the war began April 30, 1813, with her pursuit of , but she once again lost a race to overtake an enemy ship. &quot;President&quot; spent five months at sea, capturing several merchant ships, but the only highlight was the capture of in late September.

After the ship spent a year blockaded in port, Stephen Decatur assumed command of &quot;President&quot;. On the evening of January 14, 1815, &quot;President&quot; headed out of New York harbor but ran aground, suffering some damage to the copper. Unable to return to port, she was forced to head out to sea. Later the next afternoon she fought a battle with . Decatur attempted to capture &quot;Endymion&quot; to replace &quot;President&quot;, but this plan failed because &quot;Endymion&quot; was smaller and more maneuverable. Decatur surrendered his ship to &quot;Endymion&quot; only to sail away under the cover of night. Subsequently, HMS &quot;Pomone&quot; and overtook &quot;President&quot;, and Decatur surrendered the ship once again to &quot;Endymion&quot;. &quot;President&quot; was taken into the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;President&quot;, but served only a few years before being broken up in 1818.
