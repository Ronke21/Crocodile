<text>The biodiversity of New Caledonia is of exceptional biological and paleoecological interest. It is frequently referred to as a biodiversity hotspot. The country is a large South Pacific archipelago with a total land area of more than . The terrain includes a variety of reefs, atolls, small islands, and a variety of topographical and edaphic regions on the largest island, all of which promote the development of unusually concentrated biodiversity. The region&#x27;s climate is oceanic and tropical.

New Caledonia is separated from the nearest mainland by more than of open sea. Its isolation dates from at least the mid-Miocene, and possibly from the Oligocene, and that isolation has preserved its relict biota, fostering the evolution of wide ranges of endemic species.

==Location and description==
New Caledonia lies on the southernmost edge of the tropical zone, near the Tropic of Capricorn. It is part of the Melanesia subregion. It includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, the Belep archipelago, the Isle of Pines, the Chesterfield Islands in the Coral Sea, and a few remote islets.

The archipelago is about east of Australia and 1500 km, 1800 km and 1200 km from New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Fiji respectively. A few lesser islands are closer, but now provide no convenient island-hopping path by which animal species could pass either to or from major mainlands. Some plants, invertebrates, sea mammals, and many flying species as aquatic birds, parrots, and bats have spread to new locations, either under their own power or due to freak events such as storms, or have been transported by humans. Some plant species have colonized new areas by means of seed carried by ocean currents.

Some animal and plant species have reached New Caledonia from surrounding regions and in turn, some New Caledonian species have successfully extended their ranges into the Pacific Ocean area. Other New Caledonian species or their close relatives are found in regions remote from the archipelago. For example, the New Caledonian parakeet is known to be the basal species in the genus &quot;Cyanoramphus&quot;, which has spread to many Pacific islands. Many bats and birds that rely heavily on fruit for their diet, including members of the families Cotingidae, Columbidae, Trogonidae, Turdidae, and Ramphastidae, swallow seeds, then regurgitate them or pass them in their faeces. Such seed dispersal (ornithochory) has been a major mechanism of seed dispersal across ocean barriers. Seeds of grasses, spores of algae, and the eggs of molluscs and other invertebrates may stick to the feet or feathers of birds, particularly migratory or aquatic birds, and in this way may travel long distances.

The main island, Grande Terre hosts multiple habitats under the influence of varied precipitation, geology, edaphic factors and altitude. New Caledonia has several biotopes, including dense evergreen forests, maquis shrubland, sclerophyllous (dry) forest, wetlands, savannas, and halophytic vegetation. The island has two main ecoregions: the greater area is occupied by the eastern &quot;New Caledonia rainforest&quot; while the now-fragmentary &quot;New Caledonia dry forest&quot; runs along the west coast.

The most conspicuous aspects of the New Caledonian marine environment are associated with the surrounding coral reef.

Such circumstances may be expected in general to promote biodiversity, but in the case of New Caledonia, a striking feature is the intense biodiversity in such a small land area. Presumably this is partly due to the edaphic and topographic features that define a number of discrete regions and ecological gradients. However, the local species do not always occupy all the potential niches, leaving the territory vulnerable to certain forms of invasion.

The larger flora include &quot;Nothofagus&quot;, &quot;Beilschmiedia&quot;, &quot;Adenodaphne&quot;, Winteraceae, Myrtaceae, southern sassafras (Atherospermataceae), conifers of Araucariaceae, Podocarpaceae, and Cupressaceae, and tree ferns.

===Geologic origins===

New Caledonia comprises fragments of the continental crust of Gondwana, dating to over one hundred million years ago (MYA), as well as volcanic material. The fragments apparently split from the Indo-Australian tectonic plate. Prevailing opinion holds that the archipelago represents the non-submerged regions of the continental fragment known as Zealandia. Zealandia broke away from the Australian part of Gondwana some 80-90 MYA. The separation of New Caledonia from mainland contact must have begun some tens of millions of years ago, probably during the Cretaceous period.

However, the view of the island as a surviving fragment of the Cretaceous period is obsolete. Islands from that time are partly or fully submerged. Most modern New Caledonian terranes formed via accretion of oceanic island arcs and seamounts. The biota evolved as metapopulations on islands that changed constantly until they merged into the archipelago. This hypothesis that the islands and their biota emerged some 30 MYA during the Oligocene better explains the organisms that occur in New Caledonian biota.

In the Carboniferous and Permian, New Zealand and New Caledonia were on the periphery of Gondwana, which included Africa, South America, Antarctica, India, New Zealand and Australia. Paleomagnetic data locate New Caledonia as originally near the South Pole. In the Triassic and early Jurassic, Gondwana moved northward, warming the eastern margin.
New Caledonia separated from Australia and New Zealand during the breakup of the super-continent, separating from Australia at the end of the Cretaceous (66 MYA) and probably completing its separation from New Zealand in the mid-Miocene. However, as with any plate tectonic process, the process was protracted and in this region it was exceptionally complex. Many questions remain to be resolved.

The island soils derived largely from ultramafic rocks and have been a refuge for many native flora species that have adapted to their composition a long time ago; such flora can survive on acid soils with unfavourable compositions of nutrient elements. On New Caledonia examples of such soils commonly have an excess of magnesium, plus unusually high concentrations of phytotoxic compounds of heavy metals such as nickel. Not many invader species can compete successfully with plants adapted to such challenging soils.

The native flora evolved many extremophile species that thrive in environments sufficiently toxic to put invasive plants at a disadvantage. Many areas, mainly on Grand Terre have some very high concentrations of metalliferous rocks. Their mineral content is poorly suited to most foreign species of plants.

Ultramafic rocks also contain elevated amounts of chromium and nickel which may be toxic to plants. As a result, a distinctive type of vegetation develops on these soils. Examples are the ultramafic woodlands and barrens of the Appalachian mountains and piedmont, the &quot;wet maquis&quot; of the New Caledonia rain forests, and the ultramafic forests of Mount Kinabalu and other peaks in Sabah, Malaysia. Vegetation is typically stunted and is sometimes home to endemic species adapted to the soils.

Often thick, magnesite-calcrete caprock, laterite and duricrust forms over ultramafic rocks in tropical and subtropical environments. Particular floral assemblages associated with highly nickeliferous ultramafic rocks are indicative tools for mineral exploration. Weathered ultramafic rocks may form lateritic nickel ore deposits.

===Early organisms===
The marine fauna of the period, separate from that of the southwest Pacific, was distinguished as the &quot;Maori province&quot;. Gondwana began its fragmentation in the middle and upper Jurassic, and the arrival of benthic invertebrate fauna is visible in fossil deposits. The Cretaceous marked the appearance of marine invertebrate fauna of southern origin. It was then that angiosperm flora such as &quot;Nothofagus&quot; and Proteaceae colonized New Zealand and New Caledonia, from South America, along the Antarctic margin of Gondwana.

At the beginning of the Tertiary, New Zealand and New Caledonia moved north to a warmer climate. This led to a long period of evolution in near complete isolation. New Caledonia&#x27;s natural heritage includes species whose ancestors were present on New Caledonia when it broke away from Gondwana; not only species but entire genera and even families are unique to the island.

==Evolution and history==

The species of the archipelago of New Caledonia are relicts of a type of vegetation which earlier covered much of the tropics of the Earth, including much of the mainland of Australia, South America, Antarctica, South Africa, and North America. Although tropical cloud forests disappeared during the glaciations, they re-colonized large areas during successive geological eras when the weather was favorable again. At other times they were replaced by more cold-tolerant or drought-tolerant sclerophyll plant communities. Many of the then existing species became extinct because they could not cross the barriers posed by new oceans, mountains and deserts, but others found refuge as species relict in coastal areas and islands.

When the large landmasses became drier and with a harsher climate, this type of forest was reduced to those boundary areas. Although some remnants of archaic rich flora still persisted in coastal mountains and sheltered sites, their biodiversity was reduced. The location of the New Caledonian Islands in the Pacific Ocean moderated these climatic fluctuations, and maintained the relatively humid and mild climate which has allowed these communities to persist to the present day.

The ecological requirements of many of the species are those of the laurel forest, and like most of their counterparts laurifolia in the world, they are vigorous species with a great ability to populate the habitat that is conducive. The geographical isolation and special edaphic conditions helped to preserve it too. Some species are even specialized in nickel hyperaccumulation such as the Sapotaceae &quot;Sebertia acuminata&quot;.

Some geologists assert that, as the island moved north due to the effects of continental drift, it submerged at various intervals, extinguishing its terrestrial flora and fauna. Botanists counter that some areas must have remained above sea-level, serving as refugia. Many members of the late Cretaceous – early Tertiary Gondwanan flora survived in New Caledonia&#x27;s equable climate but were eliminated in Australia due to increasingly dry conditions. The isolation of New Caledonia was not absolute, given the rise and fall of sea level caused by the ebb and flow of ice ages. Land bridges or islands formed between New Caledonia and its neighbours, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Australia. Thus new species came to New Caledonia while &quot;Gondwanan&quot; species were able to penetrate the Pacific Islands region. Plants have limited &quot;seed dispersal&quot; mobility away from the parent plant and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors.

===Extinct species===
Numerous species were wiped out by humans before the arrival of Europeans. Fossils found in cave deposits show the island once had an endemic species of barn owl &quot;Tyto letocarti&quot;; two extinct hawks, &quot;Accipiter efficax&quot;, &quot;Accipiter quartus&quot;; a large, flightless galliform bird, &quot;Sylviornis neocaledoniae&quot;; a snipe, (&quot;Coenocorypha&quot; sp.); a gallinule, &quot;Porphyrio kukwiedei&quot;; the lowland kagu, &quot;Rhynochetos orarius&quot;; a ground dove, &quot;Gallicolumba longitarsus&quot;; the pile-builder megapode; a hornbill of Lifou (Loyalty Islands); a possibly extinct lorikeet, &quot;Charmosyna diadema&quot;; as well as a giant bat, arthropods and others. The island also hosted the giant terrestrial turtle &quot;Meiolania&quot;, unlike any alive today which was armed with a clubbed tail and a spiked head. There was also a species of terrestrial crocodile, the mekosuchine &quot;Mekosuchus inexpectatus&quot; which became extinct after the arrival of humans. Both &quot;Meiolania&quot; and &quot;Mekosuchus&quot; may have arrived after crossing the ocean, via island hopping and/or wave dispersal from Australia.

==Ecoregions==
There are several vegetation types, in a variety of niches, landforms and micro-climates where endemic species thrive, among including dense evergreen forests, maquis (shrubland), sclerophyllous forests (dry forests), wetlands, savannas, and halophytic vegetation.

New Caledonia has two terrestrial ecoregions. The greater area is occupied by the eastern New Caledonia rain forests, which covers the eastern part of Grande Terre, Loyalty Islands, and Isle of Pines.

In the habitat of tropical montane laurel forest of New Caledonia with Laurisilvas, which are cloud-covered for much of the year, the moist evergreen forests have a closed canopy of moderately sized trees, up to in the lowlands and in montane forest. In humid montane &quot;Melaleuca&quot; forests of lowland, communities of Mt. Ignambi and of the Yaté Lake with area of low shrubland, is the ideal habitat for the native species. For example, &quot;Erythrinas&quot; are food plants for some native parakeet species.

The now-fragmentary New Caledonia dry forests runs along the west coast of Grand Terre. Europeans generally settled here, avoiding the eastern part of the Kanakas.

New Caledonia&#x27;s marine environment is characterized by the surrounding New Caledonia Barrier Reef.

===Dry forests===
The west coast of New Caledonia has a drier climate and different habitat from the rain forests that cover most of the island. The plant life of the west coast consists of nearly 400 species, including endemic species such as the unique &quot;Captaincookia margaretae&quot;, and &quot;Oryza neocaledonica&quot;, an endangered wild rice. This coast is home to endangered animals including the New Caledonia wattled bat (&quot;Chalinolobus neocaledonicus&quot;) and the ornate flying fox. Dry forests are vulnerable to fire and human intervention. The original vegetation was cleared for farming, especially cattle ranching, leaving only two percent of the original dry forest, in isolated patches, none of them protected. Urban areas on the west coast include New Caledonia&#x27;s cosmopolitan capital Nouméa, while there are farms and farming communities all along the coast.

===Rainforest===

Mountain forests are mainly located on the lee slopes, where communities are evergreen species of laurel forest. The forests are typically evergreen because the mild climate allows for continuous biological activity. In the continuously-mild conditions, the number of species that share the canopy is high. This diversity earns them the name &quot;rainforest&quot;, as opposed to &quot;woods&quot; (&quot;Mediterranean wood&quot;, &quot;temperate wood&quot;, etc.), implying canopies dominated by one or a few tree species. In this sense, the laurel forest is a transitional formation between temperate forests and rainforests. Many tree species do not have a coordinated timing of shedding their leaves, flowering or fruit ripening, with phases occurring at any time of year. The woody plants including conifers of the families Podocarpaceae, Araucariaceae and the subfamily Callitroideae of Cupressaceae and angiosperms such as families Erythroxylaceae, Epacridaceae, Proteaceae, Griseliniaceae, Cunoniaceae, Atherospermataceae, and Winteraceae, and genera such as southern beech (&quot;Nothofagus&quot;).

Many other families of flowering plants and ferns inhabit the forest, including some tree fern genera also known from Canadian fossils, including &quot;Dicksonia&quot; and &quot;Cyathea&quot; (&quot;Cyathea novae-caledoniae&quot;), or the tallest in the world, &quot;Cyathea intermedia&quot;. Amborella has emerged as of great interest to plant systematists because molecular phylogenetic analyses consistently place it as the sister group to all other flowering plants.

There are many epiphytes and large, hanging mossy formations, giving a surreal and ghostly effect. Moisture is abundant, creating a moist, hygrophilous environment with great visual appeal, in the form of mists, sprays, ponds and streams that permeate the entire visual field.

==Flora==

New Caledonia&#x27;s vegetation is distinguished by the world&#x27;s highest rate of endemism: 5 families, 107 genera and 3,380 species. Among these are &quot;Acacia spirorbis&quot;, &quot;Dracophyllum&quot; species, &quot;Drosera neocaledonica&quot;, &quot;Grevillea gillivrayi&quot;, &quot;Neocallitropsis pancheri&quot; (Cupressaceae), and &quot;Austrotaxus spicatus&quot; (Taxaceae). Of the 44 species of gymnosperm in the archipelago, 43 are endemic, including the unique parasite gymnosperm &quot;Parasitaxus ustus&quot;.

The palm trees (Arecaceae) include 37 endemic species belonging to 16 genera. All Arecaceae species in the genera &quot;Actinokentia&quot;, &quot;Basselinia&quot;, &quot;Burretiokentia&quot;, &quot;Chambeyronia&quot;, &quot;Clinosperma&quot;, &quot;Cyphokentia&quot;, &quot;Cyphophoenix&quot;, &quot;Kentiopsis&quot;, and &quot;Pritchardiopsis&quot; are endemic to New Caledonia. For the endangered &quot;Pritchardiopsis jennencyi&quot;, one only adult specimen is known.

Three of the most primitive genera of Araliaceae also occur.

Some New Caledonia plant communities are true living fossils. Flora contains many groups of plants that appear to be remnants of the Gondwanan flora in late Cretaceous - early Tertiary that once covered large parts of Australasia. The flora is exceedingly diverse and includes a level of endemism, per square kilometre, seen almost nowhere else on Earth. Three-quarters of native plant species on New Caledonia are endemic, but a quarter of those are &quot;at risk&quot; of decline or extinction.

There are besides 454 species of marine macrophytes.

In contrast, several groups that are well represented in the rest of tropics have only a few species on the Archipelago, such as Melastomataceae with one species, or are absent all together, e.g., Ochnaceae (sensu stricto) and Begoniaceae. Other families, such as Araceae, Boraginaceae, Brassicaceae, Commelinaceae, Gesneriaceae, and Zingiberaceae, are substantially under-represented.

Five families are considered endemic: the Amborellaceae, the Oncothecaceae, the Phellinaceae that was often included in Aquifoliaceae, the Paracryphiaceae, and the Strasburgeriaceae, before placed in Ochnaceae.

Some genera originated in the Gondwanian Antarctic flora. The most remarkable Gondwanian groups include the Cunoniaceae, the Myrtaceae, the Escalloniaceae and the Proteaceae. Due to this fact, the islands share many plant families with the Valdivian forest of South America, New Zealand, Tasmania and Australia, in habitats of cloud forest and temperate rainforest. Angiosperm flora colonized New Zealand and New Caledonia during the Cretaceous with genera such as &quot;Nothofagus&quot;, &quot;Forgesia&quot;, and &quot;Polyosma&quot;.

Many other groups reached New Caledonia after it separated from Australia, which took place as part of a widespread movement of Indo-Malesian elements that expanded into Australasia during the early and middle Tertiary. Some of these newer flora speciated intensively and are now among the largest genera on the island. Examples include &quot;Phyllanthus&quot;, with 111 species, &quot;Psychotria&quot; with about 85 species, and &quot;Eugenia&quot; with around 37 species, &quot;Flindersia&quot; in the family Rutaceae, and Polyosma among others.

Most gymnosperm species are in rainforest. The gymnosperms are more common in the poorer acid soils and in soils with an excess of magnesium and other phytotoxic elements derived from ultramafic rocks. 39 species are extant, while 27 are considered extinct. The gymnosperms are more common on exposed ridges or next to rivers or creeks in floodplains. Their concentration is important at individual locations which provide lifesaving refugia, because environmental conditions make interspecific competition less severe.

Four genera, &quot;Araucaria&quot;, &quot;Libocedrus&quot;, &quot;Prumnopitys&quot; and &quot;Retrophyllum&quot; that populate the subantarctic Pacific, have endemic species in New Caledonia. The genus &quot;Acmopyle&quot; (Podocarpaceae), currently present in New Caledonia and Fiji, is a fossil in Patagonia. There are 13 endemic species of &quot;Araucaria&quot;, including &quot;A. rulei&quot; and &quot;A. columnaris&quot;. The island shares some &quot;Araucaria&quot; species with Australia&#x27;s Norfolk Island. Many, if not all current populations are relict.

Angiosperms also include many groups of archaic characteristics that appear as vestiges of an old Gondwanan floral background.

The bamboo genus &quot;Greslania&quot; is endemic to New Caledonia and comprises three or four species. They are found only in the southern part of the island where the soil contains heavy metals such as iron.

Several genera, belonging to primitive families, are endemic or sub-endemic. &quot;Amborella&quot; is the monospecific endemic genus of the endemic family Amborellaceae. Others are &quot;Hedycarya&quot; and &quot;Kibaropsis&quot; (Monimiaceae), &quot;Nemuaron&quot; (Atherospermataceae) and &quot;Balanops&quot; (Balanopaceae). The Winteraceae, of the order Magnoliales, considered the oldest group of angiosperms, are represented by the genus &quot;Zygogynum&quot; with 18 species of an order with fifty genera ranging over the Moluccas islands to northern Australia.
Among the families with &quot;conducting vessels&quot; absent or imperfect, New Caledonia has Atherospermataceae, Amborellaceae, Annonaceae and Winteraceae, representatives of families of Chloranthaceae, such as the genus &quot;Ascarina&quot; with two species, Piperaceae, with twenty species of genera &quot;Piper&quot; and &quot;Peperomia&quot;, and Trimeniaceae with &quot;Trimenia neocaledonica&quot;.

The importance of the families of Gondwanan origin, both in the number of species and their abundance in different plant communities contrasts with the low representation in indigenous communities of more modern groups such as the Compositae, Gramineae, Labiatae and Melastomataceae.

The groups of Gondwanan origin are the most remarkable flora and include Cunoniaceae, Proteaceae and Myrtaceae. The family of Cunoniaceae has six genera in New Caledonia. &quot;Pancheria&quot; and &quot;Codia&quot; are endemic, although the last is known as a fossil in Australia, while &quot;Cunonia&quot; has 23 endemic species in New Caledonia and one species in South Africa.
The other three genera have a Papuan-Australian (&quot;Acsmithia&quot;), Australian (&quot;Geissois&quot;) and Madagascan-Malesian-Papuan (&quot;Pterophylla&quot;) distribution.

Proteaceae&#x27;s two main centers of dispersion are in Australia and Southern Africa; the family is represented in the archipelago by 43 species. They divide into six endemic genera: &quot;Beauprea&quot;, &quot;Beaupreopsis&quot;, &quot;Garnieria&quot;, &quot;Kermadecia&quot;, &quot;Sleumerodendron&quot; and &quot;Virotia&quot; and three non-endemic genera &quot;Grevillea&quot;, &quot;Knightia&quot; and &quot;Stenocarpus&quot;.

Myrtaceae, although basically Gondwanan in origin, currently range throughout the tropical world and have reached the Northern Hemisphere. With 229 species, it is the largest family in New Caledonia. It has two widely distributed genera, &quot;Eugenia&quot; and &quot;Syzygium&quot;. The endemic genera are &quot;Arillastrum&quot;, &quot;Cloezia&quot;, &quot;Myrtastrum&quot;, &quot;Pleurocalyptus&quot;, and &quot;Purpureostemon&quot;. The genus &quot;Melaleuca&quot; is represented by six endemic species and one shared with Australia and Papua New Guinea, &quot;Melaleuca quinquenervia&quot;, known locally as &quot;niaouli&quot;.

==Fauna==
The New Caledonia Great Barrier Reef is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the second largest barrier reef in the world. Amedee island is a special marine reserve of coral reef lagoon, Ilot aux Goelands is a tiny lagoon island surrounded by a large shallow reef flat.
The reef has great species diversity with a high level of endemism. Many groups have been under sampled and insufficiently studied, especially when considering hard bottoms of the intermediate coral reefs and external slopes of the barrier reef. This diversity includes oceanic and continental reefs forming islands, atolls, uplifted reefs, immerged reefs, fringing reefs, barrier reefs, patch reefs and shallow or deep lagoons, is home to endangered dugongs (&quot;Dugong dugon&quot;) and is an important nesting site for green sea turtle (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;). New Caledonia has a remarkable marine fauna due to the abundance of relic organisms from the Mesozoic, for example some sponges of the Lithistideae and the Tetractinellideae which are considered living fossils due to their closeness to Cretaceous species. The endemic mollusc &quot;Nautilus macromphalus&quot; is one of only four &quot;Nautilus&quot; species known in the world, the only living group of cephalopods with an external shell. This mollusc seems to be identical to its Paleozoic ancestor. &quot;Cephalodiscus graptolitoides&quot;, described in 1993, is also considered a living fossil member of the graptolites, previously thought to be extinct for over 300 million years.

Today&#x27;s New Caledonian marine biodiversity has been counted to 9372 species, belonging to 3582 genera and 1107 families. Important groups that contribute include the molluscs (2151 species), fish (1695 species), the Foraminifera (585 species), the Brachyura (552 species) and the marine macrophytes (454 species).

New Caledonia&#x27;s animal land diversity was similar to that of some oceanic islands, particularly New Zealand and as in these islands, the biodiversity was greater before being inhabited by humans. The island has no native mammals except for bats and no native amphibians. The vertebrates are dominated by reptiles and birds. Today the island has 21 endemic species of birds, including one endemic family, the Rhynochetidae, represented by one living species, the kagu. The island is also home to the unusual tool-using New Caledonian crow. The separation of the Gondwana islands before the mammalian expansion that allowed the radiation of flightless birds (moa, kiwi, sylviornis, cagous) and Mesozoic reptilian forms such as the tuatara of New Zealand.

Endemic species comprise 62 of 69 total. No crocodiles or terrestrial turtles remain on the islands. Two species of snake are found in the Territory, one on Grand Terre and the other on the Loyalty Islands. It is the home to a large number of skinks and geckos.

The island &quot;Île des Pins&quot; is home to the crested gecko &quot;Correlophus ciliatus&quot; and the world&#x27;s largest gecko &quot;Rhacodactylus leachianus&quot;.

The island of &quot;Grande Terre&quot; has the greatest variety of reptiles, including the giant gecko (&quot;Rhacodactylus leachianus&quot;) and the giant skink (&quot;Phoboscincus bocourti&quot;). The local sea snakes laticaudinae have venom ten times as potent as rattlesnake venom.

Before the arrival of Europeans, the only mammals in the island were six endemic bat species, including &quot;Rousettus&quot;, a large fruit bat that was eaten by locals.

The world&#x27;s highest biodiversity of Volutomitridae is in waters off New Caledonia.

Tropical invertebrates make up the bulk of the endemic fauna. They include freshwater sponges, annelid worms, molluscs terrestrial and freshwater, arachnids, scorpions and mygalomorphs of this many vicariant to the mygales of Queensland. There are fourteen endemic species of decapod crustaceans in rivers and lakes.

Mites, Pauropoda, Isopoda and Collembola inhabit the island. The most studied insect orders are Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Psocoptera, Odonata, Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera and Dermaptera. About 4,000 insect species are recorded, showing high endemism at the species and genus levels. Notable are the giant coconut grasshopper (&quot;Pseudophyllanax imperialis&quot;) and other endemic insects including an ant (&quot;Cerapachys cohici&quot;), a cicada &quot;Kanakia typica&quot;, a damselfly &quot;Caledopteryx maculata&quot; a longhorned beetle &quot;Buprestomorpha montrouzieri&quot;, a phasmid &quot;Gigantophasma bicolor&quot; and a leafcutting bee &quot;Eutricharaea australis&quot;. There are 521 species of Lepidoptera, with 197 endemic (38%), notably the butterfly Montrouzier&#x27;s swallowtail (&quot;Papilio montrouzieri&quot;), &quot;Graphium gelon&quot;, &quot;Polyura gamma&quot;, &quot;Paratisiphone lyrnessa&quot;, &quot;Austroypthima petersi&quot; and a sphinx moth &quot;Compsulyx cochereaui&quot;.

===Birds===
There are twenty-two endemic species of terrestrial birds, three endemic genera and one family. The New Caledonian crow (&quot;Corvus moneduloides&quot;) is known for its intelligence. The laurel forest pigeon (&quot;Columba vitiensis hyponochroa&quot;), giant wood pigeon notou (&quot;Ducula goliath&quot;). Two genera are endemic: &quot;Drepanoptila&quot; (the green pigeon), and &quot;Eunymphicus&quot;, Ouvea parakeet. The New Caledonian parakeet known to be the basal species in the genus &quot;Cyanoramphus&quot;, which had its origins in New Caledonia from where it spread to many ocean Pacific islands.

The best-known animal species is the &quot;Rhynochetos jubatus&quot; or cagou, which is at risk from dogs, rats and other predators. It is a chicken-sized bird, almost unable to fly, with a long crest and a funny cackling song, found in leafy forest mountains.

The other terrestrial endemic birds are &quot;Accipiter haplochrous&quot;, &quot;Philemon diemenensis&quot;, &quot;Erythrura psittacea&quot;, &quot;Zosterops xanthochroa&quot;, &quot;Phylidonyris undulata&quot;, &quot;Pachycephala caledonica&quot;, &quot;Aplonis striata&quot;, &quot;Gymnomyza aubryana&quot;, &quot;Eopsaltria flaviventris&quot;, &quot;Coracina analis&quot;, &quot;Myzomela caledonica&quot;, island thrushes (&quot;Turdus poliocephalus&quot;) &quot;T. p. xanthopus&quot;, &quot;T. p. pritzbueri&quot; (probably extinct) and &quot;Megalurulus mariei&quot;.

==Threats==
New Caledonia&#x27;s biodiversity is threatened by many factors. The ecosystems of isolated islands are typically vulnerable to takeover by introduced species, because they faced reduced competitive pressure as they originally evolved. Insects such as &quot;Wasmannia auropunctata&quot; and mammals such as rat, cat, dog and pig have taken a toll on native species, such as the ground-living kagu.

Deforestation from logging, mining, uncontrolled fires, agriculture, urban development and tourism all increase pressure on these fragile ecosystems by destroying vital habitat. Hunting is a problem in remote areas. Some species are at risk from overexploitation as medicinal plants.

Deforestation alone could cause the extinction of complete genera and orders across the restricted region with an accompanying loss of genetic and phylogenic information. For example, the reproductive structures of primigenia group of Amborella are true flowers that have a unique and provide an anatomical bridge between the structures seen for cone-bearing and flower-bearing plants. Its order is found only in New Caledonia.

The mining industry is focused on the island&#x27;s rich nickel deposits, which comprise about one fourth of world reserves. In consequence, mining poses serious threats to its ecology.

The dry zone is the area most degraded by human activity, largely occupied by Colonial buildings fronting fine beaches and the infrastructure of the nickel industry.

Despite these threats, no species are known to have become extinct since 1500. Two species, the New Caledonian rail and the New Caledonian lorikeet have not been seen for over a hundred years and are considered to be critically endangered if not actually extinct. A similar fate was thought to have befallen the New Caledonian owlet-nightjar, but a recent survey found them in remote areas. The New Caledonian crested gecko was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered in 1994. Native grasses are being outcompeted by robust, introduced competitors, such as &quot;Melinis minutiflora&quot;.

The biodiversity of native tree species has protected against invasive introduced tree species, as has happened on other Pacific islands. The government created protective parks and reserves.

==Preservation==
New Caledonia is considered a conservation priority by many environmental organizations, which have lobbied to preserve the islands&#x27; unique ecosystems. To date they have failed to achieve definitive protection for New Caledonia&#x27;s remaining natural areas. For instance, all attempts to grant them UNESCO World Heritage Site-status protection failed, due to opposition by regional governments and mining and development interests.
Mining continues to expand in sensitive areas, although mining companies perform minimal rehabilitation after a mine closes. However, even when taking such rehabilitation efforts into account, mining activity devastates the local biodiversity. World Heritage Site-status would limit mining activity in areas of ecological importance, affecting employment and government revenues.

Grass-roots conservation efforts have been tentative at best, and invariably failed when in direct conflict with mining and other development projects. Recent efforts to increase habitat protection met with strong official opposition, and violence against the proponents. Notably, Bruno Van Peteghem, recipient of the 2001 Goldman Environmental Prize, used the local court system to force government leaders to obey laws protecting the country&#x27;s coral reefs. After winning in court, his home was firebombed, and his family was repeatedly threatened. Ultimately, the head of government, Jacques Lafleur, succeeded in silencing Van Peteghem, forcing him into de facto exile by arranging the termination of his employment with the national airline.

The entirety of New Caledonia&#x27;s EEZ is officially a marine protected area, the Natural Park of the Coral Sea. Levels of protection within the EEZ differ, 2.4% is highly protected, with economic activities including fishing and mining being legal in the remainder. On 18 October 2023 the government announced the highly protected area would be expanded to cover 10% of the EEZ.

<text>The Gombe National Park (), (&quot;Hifahdi ya Taifa ya Gombe&quot;, in Swahili) formerly called the Gombe Stream National Park is a national park with the IUCN category II located within the Kigoma District of the Kigoma Region in Tanzania, north of Kigoma City, the capital of Kigoma Region.

==Overview==
Established in 1968, it is one of the smallest national parks in Tanzania, with only of protected land along the hills of the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika. The terrain is distinguished by steep valleys, and the vegetation ranges from grassland to woodland to tropical rainforest. Accessible only by boat, the park is most famous as the location where Jane Goodall pioneered her behavioural research on the common chimpanzee populations. The Kasakela chimpanzee community, featured in several books and documentaries, lives in Gombe National Park.

==Ecology==
The park is home to a rich tapestry of ecosystems, including grasslands, woodlands, steep valleys, and tropical rainforests. This remarkable variety is unexpected given the park&#x27;s small size. The region where monkeys and other primates reside is a dense jungle, often reminiscent of a true Tarzan-like environment. The Ha people are recognized as the first custodians and inhabitants of this area, having lived in harmony with the land for generations. 

Gombe Stream National Park is famous for being the site of Jane Goodall&#x27;s groundbreaking research on chimpanzees and other primates. Starting her studies in 1960, Goodall&#x27;s meticulous observations have greatly contributed to our understanding of primate behavior and communication. 

While chimpanzees are undoubtedly the main attraction in the park, they share their habitat with several other primate species, beachcomber olive baboons, red colobus, red-tailed monkeys, blue monkeys, and vervet monkeys. Red-tailed monkeys and blue monkeys have also been known to hybridize in the area.s. This area boasts one of the highest concentrations of primates in Africa. 

Birdwatchers can also find around 200 different bird species to observe. Other wildlife in the park includes bush pigs, hippopotamuses, various snakes, small antelope, and leopards. Notably, leopards serve as one of the primary predators of chimpanzees and their primate relatives. and bushpigs. There are also many species of snakes, and occasional hippopotami and African leopards.

===Jane Goodall&#x27;s impact on Gombe===
Jane Goodall first travelled to Tanzania in 1960 at the age of 26 with no formal college training. At the time, it was accepted that humans were undoubtedly similar to chimpanzees, sharing over 98% of the same genetic code. However, little was known about chimpanzee behaviour or community structure. At the time she began her research, she says “it was not permissible, at least not in ethological circles, to talk about an animal&#x27;s mind. Only humans had minds. Nor was it quite proper to talk about animal personality. Of course, everyone knew that they did have their own unique characters--everyone who had ever owned a dog or other pet was aware of that. But ethologists, striving to make theirs a &quot;hard&quot; science, shied away from the task of trying to explain such things objectively.” However, her research eventually proved just that—the intellectual and emotional sophistication of non-humans, chimpanzees in particular. With the support of renowned anthropologist Louis Leakey, Goodall set up a small research station in Gombe in hopes of learning more about the behaviour of our closest relatives. There she spent months tracking the elusive chimpanzee troops, particularly the Kasekela chimpanzee community, and observing their daily habits until she was slowly accepted by one troop and was allowed rare and intimate glimpses into chimpanzee society.

===Research findings===

Without college training directing her research, Goodall observed things that strict scientific doctrines may have overlooked. Instead of numbering the chimpanzees she observed, she gave them names such as Fifi and David Greybeard, and observed them to have unique and individual personalities, an unconventional idea at the time. She found that &quot;it isn’t only human beings who have personality, who are capable of rational thought [and] emotions like joy and sorrow&quot;. She also observed behaviours such as hugs, kisses, pats on the back, and even tickling, what people consider identifiable human actions. Goodall insists that these gestures are evidence of “the close, supportive, affectionate bonds that develop between family members and other individuals within a community, which can persist throughout a life span of more than 50 years.” These findings suggest similarities between humans and chimpanzees exist in more than genes alone but can be seen in emotion, intelligence, and family and social relationships.

Goodall’s research at Gombe is best known to the scientific community for challenging two long-standing beliefs of the day: that only humans could construct and use tools, and that chimpanzees were passive vegetarians. While observing one chimpanzee feeding at a termite mound, she watched him repeatedly place stalks of grass into termite holes, then remove them from the hole covered with clinging termites, effectively “fishing” for termites. The chimps would also take twigs from trees and strip off the leaves to make the twig more effective, a form of object modification which is the rudimentary beginnings of toolmaking. Humans had long distinguished ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom as &quot;Man the Toolmaker&quot;. In response to Goodall’s revolutionary findings, Louis Leakey wrote, &quot;We must now redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as human!&quot; Over the course of her study, Goodall found evidence of mental traits in chimpanzees such as reasoned thought, abstraction, generalization, symbolic representation, and even the concept of self, all previously thought to be uniquely human abilities.
In contrast to the peaceful and affectionate behaviours she observed, Goodall also found an aggressive side of chimp nature at Gombe. She discovered that chimps will systematically hunt and eat smaller primates, such as colobus monkeys. Goodall watched a hunting group isolate a colobus monkey high in a tree and block all possible exits, then one chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus. The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing with other members of the troop in response to begging behaviours. The chimps at Gombe kill and eat as much as one-third of the colobus population in the park each year. This alone was a major scientific find which challenged previous conceptions of chimp diet and behaviour.

But perhaps more startling, and disturbing, was the tendency for aggression and violence within chimpanzee troops. Goodall observed dominant females deliberately killing the young of other females in the troop in order to maintain their dominance, sometimes going so far as cannibalism. She says of this revelation, “During the first ten years of the study I had believed […] that the Gombe chimpanzees were, for the most part, rather nicer than human beings. […] Then suddenly we found that chimpanzees could be brutal—that they, like us, had a darker side to their nature.” These findings revolutionized contemporary knowledge of chimpanzee diet and feeding behaviours, and were further evidence of the social similarities between humans and chimpanzees, albeit in a much darker manner.

===Gombe Stream Research Centre===
Goodall lived at Gombe almost full-time for fifteen years and the long-term data she accumulated is still of value to scientists today. In 1967, the Gombe Stream Research Centre (GSRC) was established to coordinate ongoing chimpanzee research in the park. Run mostly by a team of trained Tanzanians, the GSRC is the longest-running field study of an animal species in their natural surroundings, now over 60 years. This long-term data has provided scientists with insight into chimpanzee demographic patterns, male politics, hunting, culture and mother-infant relationships over multiple generations—rare and valuable data. The ongoing research is also providing information on the current threats to chimpanzees, such as disease, poaching, and habitat disturbance, which affect other species at Gombe as well. The research of Goodall has also drastically changed ethological thinking and how behavioural studies are conducted. Where once talk of animal emotion was dismissed as anthropomorphism, her observations of animals in their natural habitat show that societies, behaviour, and relationships between animals are quite complex. Her research of chimpanzee habitat (food and other requirements) also aid in improved design for new protected areas. The GSRC also conducts research on the baboon population, led by the Jane Goodall Center for Primate Studies. Research from the GSRC has resulted in 35 Ph.D. theses, over 400 papers and 30 books.

==Conservation==

The biodiversity of Gombe National Park is primarily threatened by human encroachment. Although 25% of Tanzania is set aside in parks and reserves, wildlife populations are still declining. This is mainly due to the lack of collaboration between park management, government sectors, and rural communities. Village lands often lie between parks and become obstacles for animals traveling between protected areas. Without incentives to protect the animals, rural communities will hunt them for food or kill them for safety reasons. Poverty also increases the demand.

<text>Paul Robert Milgrom (born April 20, 1948) is an American economist. He is the Shirley and Leonard Ely Professor of Humanities and Sciences at the Stanford University School of Humanities and Sciences, a position he has held since 1987. He is a professor in the Stanford School of Engineering as well and a Senior Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Research. Milgrom is an expert in game theory, specifically auction theory and pricing strategies. He is the winner of the 2020 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, together with Robert B. Wilson, &quot;for improvements to auction theory and inventions of new auction formats&quot;.

He is the co-creator of the no-trade theorem with Nancy Stokey. He is the co-founder of several companies, the most recent of which, Auctionomics, provides software and services for commercial auctions and exchanges.

Milgrom and his thesis advisor Wilson designed the auction protocol the FCC uses to determine which phone company gets what cellular frequencies. Milgrom also led the team that designed the broadcast incentive auction between 2016 and 2017, which was a two-sided auction to reallocate radio frequencies from TV broadcast to wireless broadband uses.

In 2024, Milgrom&#x27;s firm, Auctionomics, won a technical Emmy Award for their contributions to spectrum auction design.

==Early life and education==
Paul Milgrom was born in Detroit, Michigan, April 20, 1948, the second of four sons to Jewish parents Abraham Isaac Milgrom and Anne Lillian Finkelstein. His family moved to Oak Park, Michigan, and Milgrom attended the Dewey Elementary School and then Oak Park High School. Milgrom had a strong interest in math from a young age, which was fostered by his teachers. He attended the Ross summer math camp at Ohio State University in 1965, where he finished number one in his class.

Milgrom graduated from the University of Michigan in 1970 with a B.A. in mathematics. He worked as an actuary for several years in San Francisco at the Metropolitan Insurance Company and then at the Nelson and Warren consultancy in Columbus, Ohio. Milgrom became a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries in 1974. In 1975, Milgrom enrolled for graduate studies at Stanford University and earned an M.S. in statistics in 1978 and a Ph.D. in business in 1979.

==Academic career==
Milgrom assumed a teaching position at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University where he served from 1979 to 1983. Milgrom was part of a group of professors including future Nobel laureate Roger Myerson, Robert B. Wilson, Bengt Holmstrom, Nancy Stokey, Robert J. Weber, John Roberts and Mark Satterthwaite that helped to bring game theory and information economics to bear on a wide range of problems in economics such as pricing, auctions, financial markets, and industrial organization.

Weber recounted his collaboration with Milgrom. During what was supposed to be a brief meeting to ponder a problem faced by Weber, Milgrom had a key insight. Weber wrote, &quot;And there, in a matter of a few minutes, was the heart of our first two joint papers.&quot;

From 1982 to 1987, Milgrom was a professor of economics and management at Yale University. In 1987, Milgrom returned as an economics professor to his alma mater, Stanford University, where he is currently the Shirley and Leonard Ely Professor of Humanities and Sciences in the Department of Economics.

Milgrom held editorial positions at the &quot;American Economic Review&quot;, &quot;Econometrica&quot; and the &quot;Journal of Economic Theory&quot;. He became a Fellow of the Econometric Society in 1984, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992. In 1996, he gave the Nobel memorial lecture honoring the laureate William Vickrey, who had died three days after the Nobel prize announcement. In 2006, Milgrom was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.

=== Awards and honors ===
Milgrom received the Erwin Plein Nemmers Prize in Economics in 2008 &quot;for contributions dramatically expanding the understanding of the role of information and incentives in a variety of settings, including auctions, the theory of the firm, and oligopolistic markets.&quot;

Upon receiving the Nemmers Prize in 2008, the official release highlighted the following:Milgrom&#x27;s path-breaking work has developed and popularized new tools for the analysis of asymmetric information and strategic interaction and, most significantly, has shown the usefulness of those tools for the analysis of applied problems,&quot; said Charles Manski, professor and chair of economics at Northwestern. Milgrom&#x27;s work on auctions helped lay the groundwork for one of the most fruitful research areas in microeconomics over the last 30 years. His work on the theory of the firm has been equally influential. Milgrom has also made important contributions to the study of how asymmetric information can affect firm behavior in oligopolistic markets.

He won the 2012 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Economy, Finance and Management category &quot;for his seminal contributions to an unusually wide range of fields of economics including auctions, market design, contracts and incentives, industrial economics, economics of organizations, finance, and game theory.&quot;

The jury citation for the BBVA Award wrote:His work on auction theory is probably his best-known. He has explored issues of design, bidding and outcomes for auctions with different rules. He designed auctions for multiple complementary items, with an eye towards practical applications such as frequency spectrum auctions. Professor Milgrom&#x27;s research in industrial organization includes influential studies on limit pricing, entry deterrence, predation, and advertising. In addition, Milgrom has added important novel insights to finance, particularly in connection to speculative trading and market micro-structure. The common theme of his works on auctions, industrial strategies, and financial markets is that economic actors infer from prices and other observables information about the fundamental market values.

In 2013, Milgrom was elected as Vice President of the American Economic Association. In 2014, he won a Golden Goose Award for his work involving auction design. In 2017, he won the CME Group-MSRI Prize in Innovative Quantitative Applications for his work in auction design. In 2020, he was appointed a Distinguished Fellow of the American Economic Association.

In October 2020, Milgrom was the co-recipient of the 2020 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Robert B. Wilson. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences stated that it awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize jointly to Milgrom and Wilson because they &quot;used their insights to design new auction formats for goods and services that are difficult to sell in a traditional way, such as radio frequencies. Their discoveries have benefitted sellers, buyers and taxpayers around the world.&quot; The citation went on to say:

Paul Milgrom formulated a more general theory of auctions that not only allows common values, but also &quot;private values&quot; that vary from bidder to bidder. He analysed the bidding strategies in a number of well-known auction formats, demonstrating that a format will give the seller higher expected revenue when bidders learn more about each other&#x27;s estimated values during bidding.

Over time, societies have allocated ever more complex objects among users, such as landing slots and radio frequencies. In response, Milgrom and Wilson invented new formats for auctioning off many interrelated objects simultaneously, on behalf of a seller motivated by broad societal benefit rather than maximal revenue. In 1994, the US authorities first used one of their auction formats to sell radio frequencies to telecom operators. Since then, many other countries have followed suit.

===Game theory===
Milgrom made several fundamental contributions to game theory in the 1980s and 1990s on topics including the game-theoretic analysis of reputation formation, repeated games, supermodular games and learning in games.

====Reputation formation====
In an influential 1982 paper with David M. Kreps, John Roberts, and Robert B. Wilson (Kreps et.al., 1982), Milgrom showed that if one or both players have even a very small probability of being committed to playing tit-for-tat, then in equilibrium both players cooperate until the last few periods. This is because even an uncommitted player has an incentive to &quot;build a reputation&quot; for being committed to tit-for-tat, as doing so makes the other player want to cooperate. The Kreps-Milgrom-Roberts-Wilson &quot;Gang of Four&quot; paper launched an entire branch of the game theory literature on such &quot;reputation effects.&quot;

====Distributional strategies====
Milgrom&#x27;s 1985 paper with Robert J. Weber on distributional strategies showed the general existence of equilibria for a Bayesian game with finitely many players, if the players&#x27; sets of types and actions are compact metric spaces, the players&#x27; payoffs are continuous functions of the types and actions, and the joint distribution of the players&#x27; types is absolutely continuous with respect to the product of their marginal distributions. These basic assumptions are always satisfied if the sets of types and actions are finite.

====Repeated games====
Milgrom made a fundamental contribution to the theory of repeated games. When players&#x27; actions are hidden and noisy signals about their actions are observable (i.e., in the case of imperfect monitoring), there are two general ways to achieve efficiency. One way is to transfer future payoffs from one player to others. This is a way to punish a potential deviator without reducing the total future payoffs. The classical folk theorem result under imperfect monitoring is built on this idea. The second general method is to delay the release of information. Under the second method, the outcomes of the noisy signals are released in every &quot;T&quot; periods, and upon the release of information players &quot;review&quot; the signals in the last &quot;T&quot; periods and decide to punish or reward each other. This is now widely known as the &quot;review strategy&quot;, and Milgrom&#x27;s paper with D. Abreu and D. Pearce (Abreu, Milgrom and Pearce, 1991) was the first to show the efficiency of review strategy equilibrium in discounted repeated games. The review strategy turns out to be useful when players receive private signals about each other&#x27;s actions (the case of private monitoring), and the folk theorem for the private monitoring case is built on the idea of the review strategy.

====Supermodular games====
The theory of supermodular games is an important recent developments in economic theory. Key contributions to this theory include seminal work Topkis&#x27;s Theorem, Vives (1990), and the Milgrom and Roberts (1990c).

The impact and importance of the theory of supermodular games came from its breadth of application, including search, technology adoption, bank runs, arms races, pretrial negotiations, two-player Cournot competition, N-player Bertrand competition, and oil exploration, and the economics of organizations (Milgrom and Roberts, 1990b).

====Learning in games====
Milgrom and Roberts build on their work in supermodular games to understand the processes by which strategic agents reach equilibrium in a normal-form game. In Milgrom and Roberts (1991), they proposed two learning processes each with a degree of generality so as to not model learning but learning processes. They considered a sequence of plays over time which, for a player &quot;n&quot;, is denoted {&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)} where for each possible time, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is a pure strategy. Given this, an observed sequence, {&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)}, is &quot;consistent with adaptive learning&quot; if a player &quot;n&quot; eventually chooses only strategies that are nearly best-replies to some probability distribution over the joint strategies of other players (with near zero probability being assigned to strategies that have not been played for a sufficiently long time). By contrast, {&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)}, is &quot;consistent with sophisticated learning&quot; if the player eventually chooses only nearly best-replies to their probabilistic forecast of the choices of other players, where the support of that probability distribution may include not only past plays but also strategies that the players might choose if they themselves were adaptive or sophisticated learners. Thus, a sequence consistent with adaptive learning is also consistent with sophisticated learning. Sophisticated learning allows players to make use of payoff information that is used in equilibrium analysis but does not impose the fulfilled expectations requirement of equilibrium analysis.

With these definitions in place, Milgrom and Roberts showed that if a sequence converges to a Nash equilibrium or correlated equilibrium then it is consistent with adaptive learning. This gave a certain generality to those processes. They then showed how these processes related to the elimination of dominated strategies. This was shown to have implications for convergence in Cournot and Bertrand games.

===Comparative statics===
Milgrom&#x27;s research has often highlighted the restrictiveness (and often superfluity) of these assumptions in economic applications. For example, in the study of modern manufacturing (Milgrom and Roberts, 1990b), one would like to focus on the complementarity or substitutability across production inputs, without making assumptions on scale economies or divisibility (through a concavity condition on the production function).

Monotonic relationships, in which more of one quantity would imply more of another, are found pervasively in economic analysis. Milgrom pioneered in the development of new mathematical methods for understanding monotonic relationships in economics. His work on auctions with Robert Weber introduced the concept of affiliation of random variables, to indicate systems of unknown quantities where learning that any one of them is higher than some given level would cause beliefs about others to be higher. His work with John Roberts and Chris Shannon advanced the use of supermodularity as a property of individuals&#x27; preferences that can yield general monotonicity results in economic analysis.

The work of Milgrom and Shannon (1994) showed that comparative statics results could often be obtained through more relevant and intuitive ordinal conditions. Indeed, they show that their concept of quasi-supermodularity (a generalization of supermodular function) along with the single-crossing property, is necessary and sufficient for comparative statics to obtain on arbitrary choice sets. Their theory extends earlier work in the Operations Research literature (Topkis, 1968; Veinott, 1989) which already uses lattice theory but focuses on cardinal concepts. Milgrom and John Roberts (1994) extended this to comparative statics on equilibria, while Milgrom (1994) demonstrated its wider applicability in comparing optima. Milgrom and Roberts (1996) also generalized Paul Samuelson&#x27;s application of Le Chatelier&#x27;s Principle in economics. In related work, Milgrom and Ilya Segal (2002) reconsidered the Envelope Theorem and its applications in light of the developments in monotone comparative statics. Due to the influence of Milgrom and Shannon&#x27;s paper and related research by Milgrom and others, these techniques, now often referred to as monotone comparative statics, are widely known and used in economic modelling.

The single-crossing property as reformulated by Milgrom and Shannon was subsequently shown by Joshua Gans and Michael Smart not only to resolve Condorcet&#x27;s Voting paradox in majority voting and social choice theory but also to give rise to a complete characterization of social preferences. Susan Athey extended these results to consider economic problems with uncertainty.

Writing in 1994 on the comparative statics and theoretical modeling, Milgrom relates a theorem that would demonstrate when a result with a specific functional form may easily generalize, and notes:

These conclusions do not mean that functional form assumptions are either useless or inconsequential for economic analysis. Functional form assumptions may be helpful for deriving explicit formulas for empirical estimation or simulations or simply to lend insight into the problem structure, and they certainly can help determine the magnitude of comparative statics effects. But with economic knowledge at its current state, functional form assumptions are never really convincing, and this lends importance to the question I ask and to its answer: One can indeed often draw valid general comparative statics inferences from special cases.

. ... these results suggest that comparative statics conclusions obtained in models with special simplifying assumptions can often be significantly generalized. The theorems help to distinguish the critical assumptions of an analysis from the other assumptions that simplify calculations but do not alter the qualitative comparative statics conclusions. In that way, the theorems improve our ability to develop useful models of parts of the economy and to interpret those models accurately.

===Market design===

Milgrom describes &quot;Market Design&quot; this way:

Market design is a kind of economic engineering, utilizing laboratory research, game theory, algorithms, simulations, and more. Its challenges inspire us to rethink longstanding fundamentals of economic theory.

His work comprises three broad theoretical and practical efforts in the field: &quot;auction theory&quot; and &quot;matching theory&quot;, and &quot;simplifying participants&#x27; message&quot;.

===Organizational and information economics===
====Agency theory====
Milgrom, together with Bengt Holmstrom, asked what features of a contracting problem would give rise to a simpler, say, linear, incentive scheme (that is, a scheme in which the wage consisted of a base amount plus amounts that were directly proportional to specific performance measures). Previously, most theoretical papers in agency theory assumed that the main problem was to provide an incentive for an agent to exert more effort on just one activity. But in many situations, agents can actually exert unobservable efforts on several different activities. In such contexts, new kinds of incentive problems can arise, since giving an agent more incentive to exert effort on one dimension could cause the agent to neglect other important dimensions. Holmstrom and Milgrom believed that incorporating this multi-dimensional feature of incentive problems would generate implications for optimal incentive design that were more relevant for real world contracting problems.

In their 1987 paper, Holmstrom and Milgrom introduced new techniques for studying multidimensional agency problems. The key insight in the Holmstrom-Milgrom paper is that simple linear incentive schemes can become optimal when the agent can monitor the evolution over time of the performance measures on which his compensation will be based. In that paper, an agent continuously chooses the drift of an &quot;N&quot;-dimensional Brownian motion, contingent on observing the whole history of the process. Under some assumptions on the agent&#x27;s utility function, it is shown that the optimal compensation scheme for the principal specifies a payment to the agent that is a linear function of the time-aggregates of the performance measures. Such a linear compensation scheme imposes a &quot;uniform incentive pressure&quot; on the agent, leading him to choose a constant drift for each dimension of the Brownian process.

Having demonstrated that the optimal incentive contract in a dynamic principal-agent problem will be linear in certain environments, Holmstrom and Milgrom then used linear contracts to explore in more detail what happens when agents allocate their efforts or attention across multiple tasks. Prior to 1991, models had generally considered effort on a single task. To reward performance on a single task, a principal can either reward performance (or some measure of it) or change the agent&#x27;s opportunity cost of performing that task. This second strategy is key to understanding what happens when an agent has more than one task to which he can allocate effort, because increasing the reward on one task will generally alter the agent&#x27;s opportunity cost of allocating effort to other tasks, increasing it when the tasks are substitutes for the agent and decreasing it when the tasks are complements. Holmstrom and Milgrom&#x27;s (1991) paper demonstrates that when tasks are substitutes for the agent and it is difficult to measure performance on one of them, it may be optimal to have low-powered incentives, or even no incentives, on all tasks, even if some can be easily measured. They also demonstrated that the difficulties of providing incentives on multiple tasks have implications for the design of jobs. For instance, it may be better to split conflicting tasks between agents or to vary the intensity of monitoring and communication. Finally, in their 1994 paper, Holmstrom and Milgrom broadened the scope of their analysis to include not only performance-related pay but also other management choices that affect agents&#x27; incentives, such as choices about how much discretion to give agents and about whether or not agents own the assets with which they work. This paper stressed the interactions (the &quot;complementarities&quot;) between these different choices, showing that the optimal choices for the principal will often vary together as the contracting environment changes. Holmstrom recounted the impact of this work at the Nemmers Conference in Honor of Paul Milgrom.

Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991) anticipated an important aspect of the debate in education on the issue of teacher pay and incentives. In considering incentive pay for teachers based on student test scores, they wrote:

Proponents of the system, guided by a conception very like the standard one-dimensional incentive model, argue that these incentives will lead teachers to work harder at teaching and to take greater interest in their students&#x27; success. Opponents counter that the principal effect of the proposed reform would be that teachers would sacrifice such activities as promoting curiosity and creative thinking and refining students&#x27; oral and written communication skills in order to teach the narrowly defined basic skills that are tested on standardised exams. &quot;It would be better, these critics argue, to pay a fixed what without any incentive scheme than to base teachers&#x27; compensation only on the limited dimensions of student achievement that can be effectively measured&quot;. (Emphasis in original).
This work was mentioned in the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2011

Too much pressure to improve students&#x27; test scores can reduce attention to other aspects of the curriculum and discourage cultivation of broader problem-solving skills, also known as &quot;teaching to the test.&quot; The economists Bengt Holmstrom and Paul Milgrom describe the general problem of misaligned incentives in more formal terms – workers who are rewarded only for accomplishment of easily measurable tasks reduce the effort devoted to other tasks.

====Information economics====
In Milgrom (1981), Milgrom introduced into economics a new notion of &quot;favorableness&quot; for information; namely, that one observation &quot;x&quot; is more favorable than another observation &quot;y&quot;, if, for all prior beliefs about the variable of interest, the posterior belief conditional on x first-order stochastically dominates the posterior conditional on &quot;y&quot;. Milgrom and others have used this notion of favorableness and
the associated &quot;monotone likelihood ratio property&quot; of information structures
to derive a range of important results in information economics, from properties of the optimal incentive contract in a principal-agent problem, to the notion of the winner&#x27;s curse in auction theory.

In the same paper, Milgrom introduced a novel &quot;persuasion game&quot;, in which a salesperson has private information about a product, which he can, if he chooses, verifiably report to a potential buyer. (That is, the salesperson can, if he wishes, conceal his information, but he cannot misreport it if he reveals it.) Milgrom demonstrates that, with substantial generality, at every sequential equilibrium of the sales encounter game, the salesperson employs a strategy of full disclosure. This result has come to be known as the &quot;unraveling result,&quot; because Milgrom shows that, in any candidate equilibrium in which the buyer expects the salesperson to conceal some observations, the salesperson will have an incentive to reveal the most favorable (to himself) of those observations---thus, any strategy of concealment will &quot;unravel&quot;. In a subsequent paper (1986), Milgrom and John Roberts observed that when there is competition among informed, self-interested agents to persuade an uninformed party, all of the relevant information may be disclosed in equilibrium even if the uninformed party (e.g. the buyer) is not as sophisticated as was assumed in the analysis with a single informed agent (e.g. the salesperson). The unraveling result has implications for a wide variety of situations in which individuals can strategically choose whether to conceal information, but in which lying carries substantial penalties. These situations include courtroom battles, regulation of product testing, and financial disclosure. Milgrom&#x27;s persuasion game has been hugely influential in the study of financial accounting as a tool for understanding the strategic response of management to changes in disclosure regulation. This work has led to a large literature on strategic communication and information revelation.

====Organizational economics====
In the late 1980s, Milgrom began working with John Roberts to apply ideas from game theory and incentive theory to the study of organizations. Early on in this research, they focused on the importance of complementarities in organizational design. Activities in an organization are complementary, or synergistic, when there is a return to coordination. For example, a company that wants to make frequent changes in its production process will benefit from training workers in a flexible manner that allows them to adapt to these changes.

Milgrom and Roberts first came on the ideas and applicability of complements when studying an enriched version of the classic news vendor problem of how to organize production that allowed both make to order after learning demand and make to stock (Milgrom and Roberts, 1988). The problem they formulated turned out to be a convex maximization problem, so the solutions were end points, not interior optima where first derivatives were zero. So the Hicks-Samuelson methods for comparative statics were not applicable. Yet they got rich comparative statics results. This led Milgrom to recall the work of Topkis (1968), particularly Topkis&#x27;s theorem, which led to their development and application of complementarity ideas in many spheres. The incorporation of these methods into economics, discussed below, has proved very influential.

In perhaps their most famous paper on organizations, (Milgrom and Roberts, 1990b) Milgrom and Roberts used comparative statics methods to describe the development of &quot;modern manufacturing,&quot; characterized by frequent product redesigns and improvements, higher production quality, speedier communication and order processing, smaller batch sizes, and lower inventories. Subsequently, Milgrom and Bengt Holmstrom (1994), used similar methods to identify complementarities in incentive design. They argued that the use of high-intensity performance incentives would be complementary to placing relatively few restrictions on workers and decentralizing asset ownership.

In an influential paper, Milgrom and Roberts (1994) applied the framework of thinking about change of a system of complements to tackle some key issues in organizational economics. They noted that when organizations adapt by changing one element in a complementary system, it can often be the case that performance will degrade. This will make change a hard sell within organizations. Milgrom and Roberts suggested that this is why businesses had been unable to replicate Lincoln Electric&#x27;s performance incentive system because the classic piece rate contract was supported by a string of human resource policies (e.g., subjective bonuses, lifetime employment) as well as production management policies (including organizational slack on delivery), and, perhaps most importantly, deep trust between workers and management. Thus, successful replication would require getting all of these elements in place. Milgrom and Roberts used the same theory to forecast the difficulties Japanese businesses would have in adjusting to change in the decade and a half following the recession that began in the early 1990s; a prediction that was borne out by subsequent experience.

In a series of papers, Milgrom studied the problem of lobbying and politicking, or &quot;influence activities&quot; that occur in large organizations. These papers considered models in which employees are affected by post-hiring decisions. When managers have discretion over these decisions, employees have incentives to spend time attempting to influence the outcomes. Since this time could instead be spent on productive tasks, influence activities are costly for the firm. Milgrom shows that firms may limit the discretion of managers in order to avoid these costs (Milgrom, 1988). In a paper with John Roberts, Milgrom also studied a model in which employees have information that is valuable to the decision maker. As a result, allowing some degree of influence is beneficial, but excessive influence is costly. Milgrom and Roberts compare various strategies that firms might use to discourage excessive influence activities, and they show that typically, limiting employees&#x27; access to decision makers and altering decision-making criteria are preferable to the use of explicit financial incentives (Milgrom and Roberts, 1988). In another paper, with Margaret Meyer and Roberts (1992), Milgrom studied the influence costs that arise in multiunit firms. They demonstrate that managers of underperforming units have incentives to exaggerate the prospects of their unit in order to protect their jobs. If the unit were embedded in a firm whose other units were more closely related, there would be a lower threat of layoffs, because reassignment of workers could occur instead. Similarly, if the unit were independent, there would many fewer opportunities to misrepresent its prospects. These arguments help explain why divestitures of underperforming units occur so frequently and why, when such units do not become stand-alone firms, they are often purchased by buyers operating in related lines of business.

In 1992, Milgrom and Roberts published their textbook on organizations, &quot;Economics, Organization and Management&quot;. The book covers a wide range of topics in the theory of organizations using modern economic theory. It is Milgrom&#x27;s most cited work, a remarkable fact, given that it is a textbook aimed at undergraduates and masters students, while Milgrom has so many highly influential, widely cited research papers. In addition to discussing incentive design and complementarities, the book discusses some of the inefficiencies that can arise in large organizations, including the problem of lobbying or &quot;influence costs.&quot; In the 2008 Nemmers Prize conference, Roberts commented that the impact of the work on influence on management scholarship had exceeded its impact on economic scholarship.

===Industrial organization===
In a series of three seminal papers, Milgrom and Roberts developed some of the central ideas regarding asymmetric information in the context of industrial organization. The work of George Akerlof, Joseph Stiglitz, and especially Michael Spence, mostly developed in the 1970s, provides some of the conceptual and methodological background. However, it was primarily in the 1980s and largely due to the Milgrom-Roberts contributions in applying incomplete information game theory to industrial organization problems that these ideas were adopted into the mainstream of the field.

Consider first the case of predatory pricing. For a long time, McGee&#x27;s (1958) analysis, frequently associated with the Chicago school, provided the only coherent economic perspective regarding the main issues. McGee (1958) argued that the concept of predatory pricing lacks logical consistency. His idea is that, in addition to the prey, the predator too suffers from predatory pricing. If the prey resists predation and remains active, then the predator eventually will give up its efforts. Anticipating this outcome, the prey is indeed better off by resisting predatory efforts. Anticipating this outcome, in turn, the alleged predator is better off by refraining from its predatory strategy. Even if the alleged prey were short of cash, it could always borrow from a bank with the (correct) promise that its losses are only temporary. Further, supposing the predation were successful in inducing exit, if the predator subsequently raised prices to enjoy the fruits of its victory, new entry could be attracted, and the problem starts all over.

Milgrom and Roberts (1982a), as well as Kreps and Wilson (1982), provide a novel perspective on the issue. Methodologically, this perspective is based on the concept of reputation developed by Kreps, Milgrom, Roberts and Wilson (1982), where reputation is understood as the Bayesian posterior that uninformed agents (e.g., an entrant) hold about the type of an informed agent (e.g., an incumbent). Suppose that, with some small probability, an incumbent may be &quot;irrational&quot; to the point of always fighting entry (even if this is not a profit maximizing reaction to entry). In this context, by repeatedly fighting rivals with low prices, a predator increases its reputation for &quot;toughness&quot;; and thus encourages exit and discourages future entry.

If Kreps, Milgrom, Roberts and Wilson (1982) effectively created a novel economic theory of reputation, Milgrom and Roberts (1982a), as well as Kreps and Wilson (1982), provided a first application to an outstanding issue of central importance in industrial organization theory and policy (predatory pricing).

Appendix A in Milgrom and Roberts (1982a) proposes an alternative theory for equilibrium predatory pricing, that is, an alternative response to McGee&#x27;s (1958) Chicago school criticism. In this appendix, Milgrom and Roberts examine an infinite horizon version of Selten&#x27;s chain-store model (with complete information) and demonstrate the existence of an equilibrium where any attempted entry is met by predation — and thus entry does not take place in equilibrium.

Returning to the issue of information asymmetry between incumbent and entrant, Milgrom and Roberts (1982b) consider the alternative case when the entrant is uncertain about the incumbent&#x27;s costs. In this case, they show that the incumbent&#x27;s low prices signal that its costs are low too, and so are the target&#x27;s long term prospects from entry. Like Milgrom and Roberts (1982a), this paper brought formal understanding to an old idea in industrial organization, this time the concept of limit pricing. In the process of doing so, the paper also uncovered new results of interest. In particular, Milgrom and Roberts (1982b) show that the equilibrium entry rate may actually increase when asymmetric information is introduced.

Finally, Milgrom and Roberts (1986) bring the asymmetric information framework to bear in analyzing the issue of advertising and pricing. Traditionally, economists have thought of advertising as being either informative (as for example classified ads, which describe the characteristics of the product for sale), or persuasive (as for example many television commercials which seem to provide little or no information about a product&#x27;s characteristics). Following earlier ideas by Nelson (1970, 1974), Milgrom and Roberts (1986) show that even &quot;uninformative&quot; advertising, that is, advertising expenditures that provide no direct information about a product&#x27;s characteristics, may be informative in equilibrium to the extent that they work as a signal of the advertiser&#x27;s quality level. Methodologically, Milgrom and Roberts (1986) also make an important contribution: the study of signaling equilibria when the informed party has more than one available signal (price and advertising, in the present case).

===Law, institutions and economic history===
Milgrom made early contributions to the growing literature applying game theoretic models to our understanding of the evolution of the legal institutions of the market economy. Milgrom, Douglass North and Barry Weingast (1990) presents a repeated game model that shows the role for a formal institution that serves as a repository of judgments about contract behavior to coordinate a multilateral reputation mechanism. Milgrom and his co-authors argued that this model sheds light on the development of the Law Merchant, an institution of late medieval trade in Europe, whereby merchants looked to the judgments of the Law Merchant to decide what counted as &quot;cheating.&quot; In their model, merchants query the Law Merchant to determine whether a potential trading partner has cheated on prior contracts, triggering the application of punishment by other merchants. The incentive to punish in this model arises from the structure of the repeated game, assumed to be a prisoners&#x27; dilemma, where cheating is the dominant strategy and the only incentive not to cheat is because future partners can learn of this and cheating a cheater is not punishable; this makes the equilibrium sub-game perfect. Understanding the merchants&#x27; incentives to create an institution to support decentralized contract enforcement like this helps to overcome the tendency in the law and economics and positive political theory literatures to assume that the role of law is exclusively attributable to the capacity to take advantage of centralized enforcement mechanisms such as state courts and police power.

In a further contribution in this area, Milgrom, together with Barry Weingast and Avner Greif, applied a repeated game model to explain the role of merchant guilds in the medieval period (Greif, Milgrom and Weingast, 1994). The paper beings with the observation that long-distance trade in the somewhat chaotic environment of the Middle Ages exposed traveling merchants to the risk of attack, confiscation of goods and unenforced agreements. Merchants thus required the assistance of local rulers for protection of person, property and contract. But what reason did rulers have to provide this assistance? A key insight from the paper is that neither bilateral nor multilateral reputation mechanisms can support the incentives of a ruler to protect foreign merchants as trade reaches an efficient level. The reason is that at the efficient level the marginal value of losing the trade of a single or even a subset of merchants—in their attempt to punish a defaulting ruler—approaches zero. The threat is, thus, insufficient to deter a ruler from confiscating goods or to encourage their expenditure of resources or political capital to defend foreign merchants against local citizens. Effective punishment that will deter rulers&#x27; bad behavior requires more extensive coordination of effectively all the merchants who provide value for the ruler. The question then becomes, what incentives do the merchants have to participate in the collective boycott? Here is the role for the Merchant Guild, an organization that has the power to punish its own members for failure to abide by a boycott announced by the guild.

These insights have been built on to explore more generally the role of legal institutions in coordinating and incentivizing decentralized enforcement mechanisms like the multilateral reputation system.

Milgrom&#x27;s contribution to the understanding of legal institutions also includes one of the early express analyses of the functioning of adjudicatory institutions. In Milgrom and Roberts (1986b) the authors explore the role of strategic revelation in an adjudicatory setting. They show that the core notion that adversarial litigation will lead to the truth is true if the parties are symmetrically informed and both have access to verifiable evidence that demonstrates the truth and so long as one of the parties prefers the decision that even a naive decisionmaker (who chooses from a set of decisions suggested by the parties) will reach under full information to the alternative under partial information. They also show, building on Milgrom (1981c) and Grossman (1981) that a decisionmaker can induce parties with less than complete information to reveal enough to ultimately result in full revelation by adopting a skeptical posture, drawing sufficiently negative inferences from weak or non-existent evidentiary showings. This early model laid the groundwork for future work on strategic information behavior in courts Shin (1998) and Daughter and Reinganum (2000) relax the symmetry assumption, for example, looking at the impact of sequential evidentiary search decisions or Bayesian inference by judges; Froeb and Kobayashi (1996) and Farmer and Pecorino (2000) investigate the role of evidentiary costs and alternative models of judicial inference; Che and Severinov (2009) explore a role for lawyers who are better informed about the legal significance of evidence and can advise their clients about to reveal in court. This important literature sheds light on the impact of legal rules governing discovery and attorney-client privilege as well as the function of lawyers in adjudicatory systems.

===Finance and macroeconomics===
====Securities markets====
Milgrom and Stokey (1982) addressed an important question about why people trade securities and whether one can profit from speculation. The famous no-trade theorem in this paper showed that if traders have the same prior beliefs and trading motives are purely speculative, then no trading should happen. This is because all traders correctly interpret the information reflected by the equilibrium prices and expect other people to trade rationally; as a result, an uninformed trader anticipates that he would incur a loss if he traded with an informed trader so would be better off not trading.

&quot;Why do traders bother to gather information if they cannot profit from it? How does information come to be reflected in prices if informed traders do not trade or if they ignore their private information in making inferences?&quot; These questions, asked at the end of Milgrom and Stokey (1982), were addressed in Glosten and Milgrom (1985). In this seminal paper, the authors provided a dynamic model of the price formation process in securities markets and an information-based explanation for the spread between the bid and ask prices. Because informed traders have better information than market-makers, market-makers incur a loss when trading with informed traders. Market-makers use the bid-ask spread to recoup this loss from uninformed traders, who have private reasons for trading, for example, because of liquidity needs. This dynamic trading model with asymmetric information has been one of the workhorse models in the literature on market microstructure.

Trading on stock exchanges had been growing at a growing rate in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, which led Milgrom and coauthors (Bresnahan, Milgrom and Paul 1992) to ask whether the rapid increase of trading volume also brings rapid increase of the real output of stock exchanges. Traders in this model make profit by gathering information of the value of the firm and trading its stocks. However, information valuable for making a real decision on the firm is the value added rather than the value of the firm. Their analysis suggests that the increased trading activity increased the resources devoted to rent-seeking, without improving real investment decisions.

At the 2008 Nemmers Prize conference, Stephen Morris provided an explanation of Milgrom&#x27;s contributions to the understanding of financial markets as well as of the impact that they have had on financial analysis.

====Labor markets====
In 1987, Milgrom with Sharon Oster examined imperfections in labor markets. They evaluated the &quot;Invisibility Hypothesis&quot; which held that disadvantaged workers had difficult signalling their job skills to potential new employers because their existing employers denied them promotions that would improve visibility. Milgrom and Oster found that, in a competitive equilibrium, such invisibility could be profitable for firms. This led to less pay to disadvantaged workers in lower-level positions even when they otherwise had the same education and ability as their more advantaged co-workers. Not surprisingly, the returns to investing in education and human capital were reduced for those in disadvantaged groups; reinforcing discriminatory outcomes in labor markets.

Two decades later, Milgrom, in a paper with Bob Hall (Hall and Milgrom, 2008), contributed to macroeconomics directly. Macroeconomic models, including real business cycle models, efficiency wage models and search/matching models, have long had difficulty accounting for the observed volatility in labor market variables. In an influential paper, Shimer explained the problem as it appears in the standard search/matching model, an important macroeconomic model for which the Nobel prize was recently granted to Diamond, Mortensen and Pissarides (DMP). Shimer explained that in the standard DMP model, a shock that raises the value of what firms sell – other things the same – increases their incentive to hire workers by raising profits per worker. The problem, according to Shimer is that this mechanism sets into motion a negative feedback loop which in the end largely cancels firms&#x27; incentive to expand employment. In particular, as employment expands, labor market conditions in general begin to improve for workers and this puts them in a stronger position as they negotiate wages with employers. But, the resulting rise in the wage then cuts into the profits earned by firms and thus limits their incentive to hire workers. The problem has come to be known as the &#x27;Shimer puzzle&#x27;. That puzzle can loosely be paraphrased as follows: &quot;what modification to the DMP framework is needed to put it in line with the empirical evidence that employment rises sharply during a business cycle expansion?&quot; Although enormous efforts have been made, the puzzle has largely resisted a solution, until the Milgrom paper. Milgrom (with Hall), argued that the bargaining framework used in the standard DMP model does not correspond well to the way wages are actually negotiated. They argue that, by the time workers and firms sit down to bargain, they know that there is a substantial amount to be gained if they make a deal. The firm&#x27;s human resources department has most likely already checked out the worker to verify that they are suitable. Most likely, the worker has done a similar preliminary check to verify that they could make a useful contribution to the firm. A consequence of this is that if, during the negotiations, the firm and worker disagree, they are very unlikely to simply part ways. Instead, it is more likely that they continue negotiating until they do reach agreement. It follows that as they make proposals and counterproposals, bargaining worker/firm pairs are mindful of the various costs associated with delay and the making of counterproposals. They are not so concerned about the consequences of a total breakdown in negotiations and of having to go back to the general labor market to search for another worker or job. Milgrom stresses that with this shift in perspective on bargaining, the impact of improved general conditions on the wage bargain is weakened as long as costs of delay and renegotiation are not very sensitive to broader economic conditions. In particular, the approach provides a potential resolution to the Shimer puzzle, a puzzle that has confounded macroeconomists generally.

==Policy==

===FCC spectrum auction, 1993===
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has responsibility for allocating licenses for the use of electromagnetic spectrum to television broadcasters, mobile wireless services providers, satellite service providers, and others. Prior to 1993, the FCC&#x27;s authorization from the U.S. Congress only allowed it to allocate licenses through an administrative process referred to as &quot;comparative hearings&quot; or by holding a lottery. Comparative hearings were extremely time-consuming and costly, and there were concerns about the ability of such a process to identify the &#x27;best&#x27; owners for licenses. Lotteries were fast, but clearly a random allocation of licenses left much to be desired in terms of efficiency. Neither of these methods offered any ability for the FCC to capture some of the value of the spectrum licenses for the U.S. taxpayers.

Then in 1993, Congress authorized the FCC to hold auctions to allocate spectrum licenses. Auctions offered great potential in terms of obtaining an efficient allocation of licenses and also capturing some of the value of the licenses to be returned to the U.S. taxpayers. However, the FCC was directed to hold the auction within a year, and at that time no suitable auction design existed, either in theory or in practice.

Milgrom, together with Robert Wilson, Preston McAfee, and John McMillan, played a role in designing the simultaneous multiple round auction that was adopted and implemented by the FCC. Milgrom&#x27;s auction theory research provided foundations that guided economists&#x27; thinking on auction design and ultimately the FCC&#x27;s auction design choices.

The FCC needed an auction design suited to the sale of multiple licenses with potentially highly interdependent values. The FCC&#x27;s goals included economic efficiency and revenue (although the legislation suggests an emphasis on efficiency over revenue) as well as operational simplicity and reasonable speed.

According to FCC economist Evan Kwerel, who was given the task of developing the FCCís auction design, Milgrom&#x27;s proposals, analysis, and research were hugely influential in the auction design. Milgrom and Wilson proposed a simultaneous ascending bid auction with discrete bidding rounds, which &quot;promised to provide much of the operational simplicity of sealed-bid auctions with the economic efficiency of an ascending auction.&quot; Milgrom argued successfully for a simultaneous closing rule, as opposed to a market-by-market closing rule advocated by others because the latter might foreclose efficient backup strategies.

Describing the Milgrom-Wilson auction design, Kwerel states:

It seemed to provide bidders sufficient information and flexibility to pursue backup strategies to promote a reasonably efficient assignment of licenses, without so much complexity that the FCC could not successfully implement it and bidders could not understand it. Just having a good idea, though, is not enough. Good ideas need good advocates if they are to be adopted. No advocate was more persuasive than Paul Milgrom. He was so persuasive because of his vision, clarity and economy of expression, ability to understand and address FCC needs, integrity, and passion for getting things right. 

Milgrom&#x27;s proposed design was adopted in large part by the commission. Called the simultaneous multiple round (SMR) auction, this design introduced several new features, mostly importantly an &quot;activity rule&quot; to ensure active bidding. Milgrom and Weber developed an activity rule to accompany their simultaneous closing rule to ensure that bidders could not hold back while observing the bids of others. The activity rule required that bidders maintain a certain level of activity, either by being the current high bidder or by submitting a new bid, in each round or else forfeit all or part of its eligibility to submit bids in future rounds. &quot;Milgrom and Weber developed this insight into the activity rule that the FCC has used in all its simultaneous multiple round auctions. The Milgrom-Wilson activity rule was an elegant, novel solution to a difficult practical auction design issue.&quot; Activity rules are now common in dynamic multi-item auctions.

Milgrom&#x27;s role in creating the FCC design is noted in an account by the US National Science Foundation (America&#x27;s Investment in the Future), which identifies this auction design as one of the main practical contributions of 20th century research in microeconomic theory. The same invention and Milgrom&#x27;s role in creating it was celebrated again by the prestigious National Academy of Sciences (Beyond Discovery), which is the main scientific advisor to the US government. The SMR design has been copied and adapted worldwide for auctions of radio spectrum, electricity, natural gas, etc. involving hundreds of billion dollars.

In the words of Evan Kwerel, &quot;In the end, the FCC chose an ascending bid mechanism, largely because we believed that providing bidders with more information would likely increase efficiency and, as shown by Milgrom and Weber (1982), mitigate the winner&#x27;s curse.&quot; The result alluded to by Kwerel is known as the Linkage principle and was developed by Milgrom and Weber (1982). (Milgrom (2004) recasts the linkage principle as the &#x27;publicity effect.&#x27;) It provided a theoretical foundation for the intuition driving the major design choice by the FCC between an ascending bid and sealed bid auction.

===FCC incentive auctions===
In 2012, the US Congress authorized the FCC to conduct the first spectrum incentive auctions. As envisioned by the FCC, the incentive auctions will enable television broadcast stations to submit bids to relinquish existing spectrum rights. Broadcast stations that opt to stay on-air will be reassigned to channels in a way that frees up a contiguous block of spectrum to be repurposed for wireless broadband, with licenses sold to telecommunications firms. Relative to prior spectrum auctions run in the United States and around the world, the incentive auctions will have the novel feature that they are a double auction: the proceeds from selling wireless broadband licenses will be used to compensate broadcasters who relinquish rights, or who must be re-located to new channels. Any further revenue will go to the Treasury.

Subsequent to receiving Congressional authorization, the FCC announced in March 2012 that Milgrom had been retained to lead a team of economists advising the FCC on the design of the incentive auctions. In September 2012, the FCC released Milgrom&#x27;s preliminary report on the possible auction design.

==Teaching==
Milgrom has taught a variety of courses in Economics. In the 1990s, he has developed a popular undergraduate course on The Modern Firm in Theory and Practice, based on his 1992 book with John Roberts. In the early 2000s, together with Alvin E. Roth, Milgrom taught the first graduate course on Market Design, which brought together topics on auctions, matching, and other related areas. The market design course has served as a basis for many similar graduate courses across the US and around the world, and has helped jump-start the field of Market Design.

In his teaching, Milgrom was always cognisant of what economic models could and could not do. He stressed the assumptions that made them useful in generating robust empirical predictions as well as the core assumptions upon which those predictions relied. This philosophy is perhaps exemplified in this reflect on the assumption of rational choice (with Jonathan Levin).

 ... it is worth emphasizing that despite the shortcomings of the rational choice model, it remains a remarkably powerful tool for policy analysis. To see why, imagine conducting a welfare analysis of alternative policies. Under the rational choice approach, one would begin by specifying the relevant preferences over economic outcomes (e.g. everyone likes to consume more, some people might not like inequality, and so on), then model the allocation of resources under alternative policies and finally compare policies by looking at preferences over the alternative outcomes.

Many of the &quot;objectionable&quot; simplifying features of the rational choice model combine to make such an analysis feasible. By taking preferences over economic outcomes as the starting point, the approach abstracts from the idea that preferences might be influenced by contextual details, by the policies themselves, or by the political process. Moreover, rational choice approaches to policy evaluation typically assume people will act in a way that maximizes these preferences – this is the justification for leaving choices in the hands of individuals whenever possible. Often, it is precisely these simplifications – that preferences are fundamental, focused on outcomes, and not too easily influenced by one&#x27;s environment and that people are generally to reason through choices and act according to their preferences – that allow economic analysis to yield sharp answers to a broad range of interesting public policy questions.

The behavioral critiques we have just discussed put these features of the rational choice approach to policy evaluation into question. Of course institutions affect preferences and some people are willing to exchange worse economic outcomes for a sense of control. Preferences may even be affected by much smaller contextual details. Moreover, even if people have well-defined preferences, they may not act to maximize them. A crucial question then is whether an alternative model - for example an extension of the rational choice framework that incorporates some of these realistic features – would be a better tool for policy analysis. Developing equally powerful alternatives is an important unresolved question for future generations of economists.

==Business==
Milgrom has been involved for at least two decades in the design and practice of large-scale auctions. Working with Bob Wilson on behalf of Pacific Bell, he proposed the simultaneous multiple round auction that was adopted by the FCC to run the initial auctions for radio spectrum in the 1990s. He has also advised regulators in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, Sweden and Mexico on spectrum auctions, Microsoft on search advertising auctions and Google on the auction at the basis of their IPO.

In 2006, along with Jeremy Bulow and Jonathan Levin, Milgrom advised Comcast in bidding on FCC Auction 66 including a rarely successfully implemented &quot;jump bid.&quot; In the words of the&quot; Economist&quot;:

In the run-up to an online auction in 2006 of radio-spectrum licences by America&#x27;s Federal Communications Commission, Paul Milgrom, a consultant and Stanford University professor, customised his game-theory software to assist a consortium of bidders. The result was a triumph.

When the auction began, Dr Milgrom&#x27;s software tracked competitors&#x27; bids to estimate their budgets for the 1,132 licences on offer. Crucially, the software estimated the secret values bidders placed on specific licences and determined that certain big licences were being overvalued. It directed Dr Milgrom&#x27;s clients to obtain a patchwork of smaller, less expensive licences instead. Two of his clients, Time Warner and Comcast, paid about a third less than their competitors for equivalent spectrum, saving almost $1.2 billion.

In 2007, Milgrom co-founded Auctionomics, with Silvia Console Battilana, to design auctions and advise bidders in different industries.

In 2009, Milgrom was responsible for the development of assignment auctions and exchanges. This was a mechanism that allowed for arbitrage possibilities and retained some of the flexibility of the simultaneous ascending bid auction but could be achieved instantaneously. The speed was an important attribute along with the potential to extend the auction design to consider bidding with non-price attributes.

In 2011, the FCC hired Auctionomics to tackle one of the most complex auction problems ever, the incentive auction. FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said,
:I am delighted to have this world-class team of experts advising the Commission on this historic undertaking. Our plan is to ensure that incentive auctions serve as an effective market mechanism to unleash more spectrum for mobile broadband and help address the looming spectrum crunch. Our implementation of this new Congressional mandate will be guided by the economics, and will seek to maximize the opportunity to unleash investment and innovation, benefit consumers, drive economic growth, and enhance our global competitiveness. The knowledge and experience of this team will complement the substantial expertise of agency staff to meet these goals.

In 2012, Auctionomics and Power Auctions were hired to design the FCC&#x27;s first Incentive Auction, with the goal of creating a market for repurposing television broadcast spectrum to wireless broadband. The design team was led by Milgrom and includes Larry Ausubel, Kevin Leyton-Brown, Jon Levin and Ilya Segal.

Over the years, Milgrom has been active as an innovator and has been awarded four patents relating to auction design.

In June 2024, 16 Nobel Prize in Economics laureates, including Milgrom, signed an open letter arguing that Donald Trump’s fiscal and trade policies coupled with efforts to limit the Federal Reserve&#x27;s independence would reignite inflation in the United States.

<doc id="1195169" wikidata="Q3487409" url="?curid=1195169" title="The Empath">
<text>&quot;The Empath&quot; is the twelfth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Joyce Muskat and directed by John Erman, it was first broadcast on December 6, 1968.

In the episode, while visiting a doomed planet, the landing party is subjected to brutal experiments by powerful aliens.

This episode is one of a handful not screened in the United Kingdom by the BBC for many years, owing to its disturbing content (torture). It was not broadcast by the BBC until January 1994.

==Plot==
The starship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives at Minara II to recover research personnel as its star is about to go supernova. Captain Kirk, Dr. McCoy, and Science Officer Spock beam to the surface but find the research station deserted. Chief Engineer Scott moves &quot;Enterprise&quot; to a safe distance to protect it from being bombarded by a solar flare.

The landing party is suddenly transported to an underground chamber and discover that they are trapped along with a beautiful mute woman, whom McCoy names &quot;Gem&quot;. The landing party is attacked by two aliens, Lal and Thann, from a race of humanoid beings with humongous craniums known as Vians, who proceed to injure Kirk. Gem proves to be an empath by absorbing Kirk&#x27;s injuries, briefly taking them on herself before they are healed.

The four search the nearby chambers and find machinery and computer systems, along with transparent cylinders, some containing the missing research personnel in grotesque poses, and three empty ones labeled with the landing party&#x27;s names. Lal arrives, but Spock subdues him with a Vulcan nerve pinch, allowing the group to escape to the surface. They are surprised to see Scott and a landing party waiting for them, but soon discover they are only a mirage. The Vians arrive and transport Gem and Kirk back into the underground complex, where they begin torturing Kirk as Gem watches. During this, the aliens explain that they had tested the research personnel (Linke and Ozaba) similarly, but both men died from their fears.

Gem and a badly injured Kirk are transported back to where McCoy and Spock are held, and Gem heals Kirk&#x27;s wounds, but only after McCoy urges her to do so. The Vians demand another test subject, and McCoy sedates Kirk and Spock to prevent them from going. When Kirk and Spock awaken, they understand from Gem what McCoy has done and make their escape to find McCoy near death in the medical chamber.

Kirk and Spock attempt to help McCoy but are stopped by a force field. They watch as Gem attempts to absorb McCoy&#x27;s wounds, though she seems afraid to take them completely upon herself. The Vians explain that is a test of Gem as a representative of her people: if she is willing to sacrifice her life for that of another, the Vians, who can save only one race from the coming supernova, will choose hers. Gem attempts again to absorb McCoy&#x27;s wounds but he pushes her away, not wanting her to die. Spock observes the force field reacts to resistant force, and theorizes that total calm would dissipate the field, allowing them the opportunity to overcome the Vians. Kirk pleads that Gem has proven her willingness to sacrifice herself, and accuses the aliens of lacking compassion. The Vians, apparently in agreement, return Gem and McCoy to full health, and promise to save Gem&#x27;s people. They and Gem then disappear.

Kirk, Spock and McCoy return to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; safely. After hearing the trio discussing the probability of meeting a woman like Gem, Scott comments that she must have been a &quot;pearl of great price&quot;, and they agree.

==Production==
===Writing and conception===
&quot;Star Trek&quot; fan Joyce Muskat, fresh out of UC Berkeley, was working as a newspaper reporter when she wrote her first television script, &quot;The Answerer&quot;. It was inspired by the 1933 science fiction novel &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot;, and also by an ancient Egyptian custom of inviting a person to speak on behalf of another who was being judged. Muskat was also working at a local theater, and wanted her story to be shot on a bare, surreal set, like a stage play that focused on the characters. Her theater employer, playwright and screenwriter Robert Fisher, liked the script and, acting as her agent, submitted it. 
&quot;Star Trek&quot; producers Gene Roddenberry, Fred Freiberger and Robert Justman all thought it had promise, but agreed there would have to be some changes. Muskat reworked the script based on their input. Freiberger, Justman and story consultant Arthur Singer made further changes and Singer also gave the story a new title, &quot;The Empath&quot;. Since Muskat was not a member of the Writers Guild, &quot;Star Trek&quot; would be saving money, which was becoming very tight.

===Direction and casting===
&quot;Star Trek&quot; associate producer Robert Justman had worked on an episode of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; called &quot;Nightmare&quot;, which also dealt with men being brutally interrogated by aliens on a minimalistic set. The episode was directed by John Erman, and Justman hired him for &quot;The Empath&quot;, given their similar themes. 
Erman in turn hired a few actors he had previously worked with. He remembered Kathryn Hays from his time as a casting director, and recommended her for the part of Gem. She had also impressed Gene Roddenberry in an episode of &quot;Naked City&quot; that he had written.
The actors who played the Vians (Lal and Thann) were friends of Erman. Willard Sage (Thann) had also worked on the &quot;Outer Limits&quot; episode. Alan Bergmann played the main Vian, Lal. He was reluctant at first, as the part sounded limited and he didn&#x27;t like the idea of wearing grotesque makeup, but Erman eventually persuaded him, and promised to expand his role.

===Filming===
Filming began on Thursday, July 25, 1968. There was a delay due to Shatner, Nimoy and Kelley being unhappy with elements of the script, and various injuries and illnesses including Kelley suffering a back spasm. The scenes on the surface of the planet were filmed first, then the cast and crew moved to Paramount&#x27;s giant Marathon stage 1, dressed as the surrealistic underground chamber. Guest star Kathryn Hays recalled, &quot;A cyclorama went around the entire studio set right up against the walls and that, along with the floors and ceilings, was painted black, so it looked like we were out in space.&quot; Filming finished on Friday, August 2, one full day behind due to the problems at the start of the shoot. This was to be cinematographer Jerry Finnerman&#x27;s last &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode; he had been with the show since the first episode. This was also the only &quot;Star Trek&quot; assignment for director John Erman. He did not enjoy the experience, due to Shatner and Nimoy wishing to direct themselves. Erman later said, &quot;Nobody was like Bill and Lenny. I don&#x27;t remember any other actors saying what those guys said, which was, &#x27;Oh no, my character just wouldn&#x27;t do that.&#x27; That was the ultimate put down for a director.&quot; Guest star Alan Bergmann recalled, &quot;Mr. Shatner and Mr. Nimoy seemed to be in conflict. They struggled over better camera positions and made life difficult for the director.&quot;

===Music===
&quot;The Empath&quot; has a distinctive music score, composed by George Duning. His use of the Yamaha organ was, according to the composer himself, the first time that the electronic instrument (newly arrived from Japan) was featured in a Hollywood film score. The enchanting theme for Gem was used in multiple subsequent episodes during tender, romantic scenes.

==Reception==
===Broadcast===
&quot;The Empath&quot; was broadcast on NBC at 10pm on Friday, December 6, 1968, and was the second most-watched season three episode (after the season opener, &quot;Spock&#x27;s Brain&quot;), with 34 percent of the audience share. It was not repeated on NBC in summer 1969 because the torture scenes were considered too graphic for the earlier time slot.

In the UK, the BBC decided to cancel the scheduled 16 December 1970 screening of the episode (it was listed in the &quot;Radio Times&quot;), following the screening of &quot;Miri&quot; two weeks previously, which had received a number of complaints from viewers. This caused the BBC to look at &quot;Star Trek&quot; more closely, resulting in the banning of both episodes along with &quot;Plato&#x27;s Stepchildren&quot; and &quot;Whom Gods Destroy&quot;. Fans writing to the BBC prior to another repeat run in 1984 received this reply: &quot;There are no plans to screen the four episodes because we feel that they deal most unpleasantly with the already unpleasant subjects of madness, torture, sadism and disease.&quot; The episodes were not screened by the BBC until the 1990s.

===Cast and crew response===
This was one of DeForest Kelley&#x27;s favourite episodes. He said, &quot;I thought it was so dramatically done. The entire stage was blacked out in black curtains, and everything was done in &#x27;pen spots&#x27;. It was so unique in production values and the cinematography on it.&quot;
Guest star Kathryn Hays recalled in an interview, &quot;I’ve often thought that was an interesting role for me to play. I loved playing that. It was technically very interesting. That show was fascinating to work on from a technical point of view. It was so different from a regular show.&quot;
Guest star Alan Bergmann said, &quot;Given the minimal sets and the ludicrous pajama-like costumes of the regulars, the episode was quite successful in text and production.&quot;
Writer Joyce Muskat said, &quot;When I saw it, there were a lot of changes. But the storyline of Gem learning something is the same, and the idea of the stark setting and four characters interacting was still there. So I couldn&#x27;t find fault with it. I was very satisfied.&quot;

===Critical response===
In 2015, &quot;Polygon&quot; ranked &quot;The Empath&quot; as one of the three best Spock-centric episodes of Star Trek. They praised the episode for its moralistic conclusion and what they call the best acting performance by Nimoy, who plays Spock. However, many critics view this as one of the worst, if not the worst, episode of the series, thanks to its gratuitous violence and questionable moral tone.

A 2018 &quot;Star Trek&quot; binge-watching guide by &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, recommended this episode for featuring the trio of characters Kirk, Spock, and Bones of the original series.

== Home video releases ==
This episode was released in Japan on December 21, 1993, as part of the complete season 3 LaserDisc set, &quot;Star Trek: Original Series log.3&quot;. A trailer for this and the other episodes was also included, and the episode had English and Japanese audio tracks. The cover script was スター・トレック TVサードシーズン 

This episode was included in TOS Season 3 remastered DVD box set, with the remastered version of this episode.

<doc id="1195175" wikidata="Q4744812" url="?curid=1195175" title="American Regions Mathematics League">
<text>The American Regions Mathematics League (ARML), is an annual, national high school mathematics team competition held simultaneously at four locations in the United States: the University of Iowa, Penn State, University of Nevada, Reno, and the University of Alabama in Huntsville. Past sites have included San Jose State University, Rutgers University, UNLV, Duke University, and University of Georgia.

Teams consist of 15 members, which usually represent a large geographic region (such as a state) or a large population center (such as a major city). Some schools also field teams. The competition is held in June, on the first Saturday after Memorial Day.

In 2022, 120 teams competed with about 1800 students.

ARML problems cover a wide variety of mathematical topics including algebra, geometry, number theory, combinatorics, probability, and inequalities. Calculus is not required to successfully complete any problem, but it may facilitate solving the problem more quickly or efficiently. While part of the competition is short-answer based, there is a cooperative team round, and a proof-based power question (also completed as a team). ARML problems are harder than most high school mathematics competitions.

The contest is sponsored by D. E. Shaw &amp; Co. Contest supporters are the American Mathematical Society, Mu Alpha Theta (the National Mathematics Honor Society for High School and Two-Year College students), Star League, Penguin Books, and Princeton University Press.

==Competition format==
The competition consists of four formal events:
* A team round, where the entire team has 20 minutes to solve 10 problems. Each problem is worth 5 points, for a possible total of 50 points
* A power question, where the entire team has one hour to solve a multiple-part (usually ten) question requiring explanations and proofs. This is usually an unusual, unique, or invented topic so students are forced to deal with complex new mathematical ideas. Each problem is weighted for a possible 50 points.
* An individual round, where each team member answers five groups of two questions each, with ten minutes per pair. Starting in 2009, the individual round expanded from eight questions to ten. Each problem is worth 1 point, for a grand total of 150 points possible for the team. Only 12 students nationwide received a perfect score in 2014. This round&#x27;s format is similar to that of the Target Round in MATHCOUNTS.
* A relay, where the team is broken into five groups of three. Within each group, the first team member solves a problem and passes the solution to the next team member, who plugs that answer into their question, and so on. The allotted time is six minutes, but extra points are given for solving the problem in three minutes. Solving the relay in 3 minutes gives 5 points, solving it in 6 minutes gives 3 points. The whole process is done twice, making the maximum 50 points possible for the team.

The teams are scored based on the number of points they attained with the maximum being 300 points. Team score ties are broken by first considering the sum of the Team and Power Rounds, then the Relay Round total.

At the end, there is a set of tiebreaker questions to determine the top 20 participants, who receive cash prizes from D. E. Shaw &amp; Co. Each student tied for the highest score (or the highest two scores if there are fewer than 20 tied with the top score) is given up to three tiebreaker questions, one at a time, with the goal of answering correctly as quickly as possible. As soon as a student answers a tiebreaker question correctly, they have finished the tiebreaker. Students are then ranked by individual round score, followed by the time to answer the first tiebreaker question correctly, then the time to answer the second tiebreaker (if applicable), then the third. Students are given 10 minutes to answer the first tiebreaker question, and 6 minutes to answer each of the second and third tiebreaker questions.

In recent years, there has been a super relay, where two groups of seven team members (fourteen in all) both work to give a correct answer to the fifteenth team member. That last team member substitutes &quot;two&quot; answers into his problem. For logistical reasons, the Super Relay has never counted towards the team score. It was instituted as a &quot;filler&quot; while scores are tabulated. Candies and other goodies are sometimes rewards for the super relay round.

Also in recent years, a song contest has become an informal event at ARML. Each school is allowed to have any number of their students perform a song related to mathematics, usually a parody of a popular song, with its lyrics replaced.

The format of the ARML competition is based on the NYSML competition, but is generally considered more difficult than the NYSML competition. This format also inspired the Great Plains Math League.

==History==
The New York State Mathematics League held its first competition in 1973, a competition intended for New York state teams. A team from Massachusetts asked to participate in the 1974 NYSML competition, and it took first place. This led to the creation of the &quot;Atlantic Regions Mathematics League&quot; in 1976, which became the American Regions Mathematics League in 1984.

When the Atlantic Regions Mathematics League was founded, the competition was held at a single eastern site that changed from year to year:

After 1983, the coordinators decided to keep the competition at Penn State University. ARML expanded to two sites in the late 1980s and to three sites in 1995. In 2008, ARML added a fourth site at the University of Georgia in Athens to better accommodate students in the Southeast, which moved to the University of Alabama in Huntsville in 2020.

The 2006 competition saw significant expansion of about 25% more participants than ever before. Attendance at the western site, UNLV, nearly doubled.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ARML competition was not held in 2020, and it was only held virtually in 2021.

<doc id="1195192" wikidata="Q2091274" url="?curid=1195192" title="Bareboat charter">
<text>A bareboat charter, or demise charter, is an arrangement for the chartering or hiring of a ship or boat for which no crew or provisions are included as part of the agreement. Instead, the people who rent the vessel from the owner are responsible for taking care of such things and (for commercial shipping) obtaining insurance, usually for a minimum term of one year. The act is commonly known as bareboating or bareboat charter.

There are legal differences between a bareboat charter and other types of charter arrangements, commonly called &quot;time&quot; or &quot;voyage&quot; charters. In a voyage or time charter, the charterer charters the ship or part of it for a particular voyage or for a set period of time. The charterer then can direct where the ship will go but the owner of the ship retains possession of the ship by its employment of the master and crew. In a bare-boat or demise charter, on the other hand, the owner gives possession of the ship to the charterer, and the charterer hires its own master and crew. The bare-boat charterer is sometimes called a &quot;disponent owner&quot;. The giving up of possession of the ship by the owner is the defining characteristic of a bareboat or demise charter.

== In shipping ==
In a bareboat charter, no administration or technical maintenance is included as part of the agreement. The charterer obtains possession and full control of the vessel, along with the legal and financial responsibility for it. The charterer pays for all operating expenses, including fuel, crew, port expenses and P&amp;I and hull insurance.

A bareboat charter is in effect a financing arrangement. It is generally considered a lease contract, specifically a finance lease, for accounting purposes, under both international financial reporting standards (IFRS 16) and US accounting standards.

== In yachting ==
In yachting, a bareboat charter is usually for a short period. There are hundreds of bareboat yacht charter brokers or agent companies, which offer yacht finding and travel organisation services that are similar to travel agents but only more specialized. Their purpose is to use their experience and networks to locate a client&#x27;s ideal bareboat in terms of price and location. Much like online travel agencies that sell unsold inventory of airline tickets and hotel rooms at a fraction of the price, there are now also last-minute bareboat charter brokers, where travellers can find excellent rates.

Bareboat technically refers to any boat that can be chartered without a skipper or crew, but typically, bareboating refers to sailing yachts, including monohulls and catamarans.

Bareboat hire has become increasingly common since the mid-1990s, particularly since the early 2000s. There has been increasing demand for yacht vacations, and many experienced and semi-experienced yachties now consider it easier and cheaper to hire a bareboat than own their own yacht. While both the international leisure travel industry (particularly outdoor activities based vacations) and the boating industry boomed in the 2000s, so too did the bareboat charter industry, which incorporates both of pursuits. Bareboat chartering is extremely common in the Caribbean such as the British Virgin Islands, but also in Croatia with around 4000 charter boats which makes probably the largest charter fleet in the world before Greece with around 2500.

In the United States, there is an additional legal distinction with regard to bareboat or for hire, or &quot;skippered&quot; charters. When persons pool their finances to bareboat so that the qualified master among them may skipper for the group, the master is not ostensibly a paid skipper but now takes on the legal responsibilities of one. That can have far-reaching consequences in the event of negative occurrences at sea.

<text>Panel of Judges is an indie rock band from Melbourne, Australia. Dion Nania began the group in 1997 as a solo project, then added Alison Bolger, Michael Nichols and Paul Williams soon afterwards.

Nania, originally from Geelong, had played with the Golden Lifestyle Band; Bolger, originally from Brisbane, had played bass in Clag and Sleepy Township and in looser configurations such as an improvisational group with Mia Schoen and Ellen Turner; Williams had been a member of Perth group Molasses and, in the early days of Panel of Judges was also drumming in Melbourne band Jaguar is Jaguar; and Nichols had been a formative figure in the Hanshalf Trio in Melbourne, Crabstick and Blairmailer in Sydney, and the &#x27;travelling&#x27; group Ruff Buff.

Panel of Judges&#x27; first release was an EP, &quot;Blind as a Bat&quot; on Chapter Music in 1998; their debut album &quot;Cool Fool&quot; was released later that year after which Nichols left and the band continued as a three-piece. They travelled to Europe in 2002, playing in London and Paris, and returned in 2004 to record their second album &quot;No Scandal - No Future - In Heaven&quot;, the title of which was &#x27;stolen from a card left on Serge Gainsbourg&#x27;s grave&#x27;. They have since toured Japan and New Zealand; their third album, &quot;Bad Vibrations&quot; was released on Mistletone in late 2008.

<text>William McGregor ( 1846 – 1911) was a Scottish association football administrator in the Victorian era who was the founder of the Football League (now English Football League), the first organised association football league in the world.

After moving from Perthshire to Birmingham to set up business as a draper, McGregor became involved with local football club Aston Villa, which he helped to establish as one of the leading teams in England. He served the club for over 20 years in various capacities, including president, director and chairman. In 1888, frustrated by the regular cancellation of Villa&#x27;s matches, McGregor organised a meeting of representatives of England&#x27;s leading clubs, which led to the formation of the Football League, giving member clubs a guaranteed fixture list each season. This was instrumental in the transition of football from an amateur pastime to a professional business.

McGregor served as both chairman and president of the Football League and was also chairman of The Football Association (the FA). He was recognised by the FA for his service to the game shortly before his death in 1911, and was posthumously honoured by the local football authorities and Aston Villa.

==Personal life==
Born in Braco in Perthshire, Scotland, McGregor first became interested in football after watching a match between locals and visiting artisans at Ardoch. He served an apprenticeship as a draper in Perth, and in 1870, following the example of his brother Peter, moved to Birmingham, and opened his own drapery business in Aston, an area then just outside the city. Upon his arrival in the English Midlands he became involved with a local football club, Calthorpe F.C., which had been formed by a fellow Scot, Campbell Orr. McGregor was enthusiastic enough about the game to arrange for his shop to close early on Saturdays to allow him to watch matches, and he later sold football kits at the shop, which became a popular meeting place for football enthusiasts.

McGregor was married to Jessie, and the couple had a daughter and a son, also named Jessie and William. A teetotaller, McGregor was a supporter of the Temperance movement, and was active in the local branch of the Liberal Party until his membership lapsed in 1882 due to the increasing amount of time he devoted to football. He was involved in the early attempts to establish a baseball league in the United Kingdom, and served as the honorary treasurer of the Baseball Association of Great Britain and Ireland. Despite his commitment to sport, he continued his drapery business throughout his life.

McGregor was a committed Christian who was widely respected for his honesty and integrity. He worshipped for forty years at the Congregational church in Wheeler Street, Aston. His pastor, the Revd. W.G. Percival said that the best thing about him &quot;was not so much the genial, kindly, honest sportsman, but the Christian behind it all&quot;. He described him as &quot;a man of absolutely unblemished personal character&quot;.

==Association with Aston Villa==

In 1877, McGregor was invited to become a committee member of Aston Villa, a football club formed three years earlier. He also umpired matches for the club. At the time the club played at Aston Park, close to the premises of McGregor&#x27;s business. He became interested in joining Villa due to the strong Scottish contingent in the club&#x27;s ranks, the team&#x27;s exciting style of play, and the club&#x27;s connection to a Wesleyan Chapel. He quickly assumed the post of club administrator, helping the impecunious club to survive its financial troubles. After some of Aston Villa&#x27;s possessions were seized by bailiffs, McGregor allowed the club to use his shop as a store to prevent further seizures. Under McGregor&#x27;s leadership, Aston Villa won their first trophy, the Birmingham Senior Cup, in 1880, shortly after which McGregor became the club&#x27;s president.

The following year McGregor became a member of the club&#x27;s board of directors. Villa&#x27;s standing within the game continued to grow, and, in 1887, the club became the first from the Midlands to win the FA Cup, defeating local rivals West Bromwich Albion in the final. In 1895, McGregor became vice-chairman, and went on to become the club&#x27;s chairman in 1897. During his time at the club he was noted for his organisational skills and ambition, and was responsible for adopting the lion rampant depicted on the Royal Standard of Scotland, as the club&#x27;s crest.

==Founder of the Football League==
As the 1880s progressed, the balance of power within English football began to change. The first national competition, the FA Cup, had previously been dominated by amateur clubs from privileged backgrounds, such as Wanderers and Old Etonians. However the 1883 FA Cup Final saw the first victory by a working-class team, Blackburn Olympic. At this time professionalism was not permitted. Clubs from urban areas in the north were strong advocates of the practice, but the southern amateur teams and the FA authorities were firmly opposed. Though not initially an advocate of professionalism, McGregor came to favour its introduction. By 1885 the issue threatened to split the FA when a group of clubs, predominantly from Lancashire, announced their intention to leave and form a rival British Football Association if professionalism was not accepted. An emergency FA conference was called in response. Representing Aston Villa, McGregor spoke in favour of professionalism, the only delegate from the Midlands to do so, and was one of the few delegates to admit that his club had been paying players. Though not as outspoken as stronger proponents, such as Preston North End&#x27;s William Sudell, McGregor was well respected. The conference ended with the FA accepting professionalism, although each club was permitted only to pay players who had been born or lived for at least two years within six miles of its home stadium.

Professionalism brought fresh complications for club administrators. Many friendlies were cancelled due to opponents&#x27; FA Cup or county cup matches taking precedence or clubs simply failing to honour a fixture in favour of a more lucrative match elsewhere. This made it hard for the clubs to pay players&#x27; wages on a regular basis. McGregor took action after seeing Villa matches cancelled, to the increasing frustration of the club&#x27;s fans, on five consecutive Saturdays. On 1888, he wrote to the committee of his own club, Aston Villa, as well as to those of Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End and West Bromwich Albion, suggesting the creation of a league competition that would provide a number of guaranteed fixtures for its member clubs each season. Corinthian F.C. founder Nicholas Lane Jackson, writing in 1899, stated that McGregor took his inspiration from the existing league set-up used in American baseball, although McGregor himself cited the County Cricket Championship as his inspiration. McGregor&#x27;s letter to the clubs read:

Every year it is becoming more and more difficult for football clubs of any standing to meet their friendly engagements and even arrange friendly matches. The consequence is that at the last moment, through cup-tie interference, clubs are compelled to take on teams who will not attract the public.&lt;br&gt;
I beg to tender the following suggestion as a means of getting over the difficulty: that ten or twelve of the most prominent clubs in England combine to arrange home-and-away fixtures each season, the said fixtures to be arranged at a friendly conference about the same time as the International Conference.&lt;br&gt;
This combination might be known as the Association Football Union, and could be managed by representative from each club. Of course, this is in no way to interfere with the National Association; even the suggested matches might be played under cup-tie rules. However, this is a detail.&lt;br&gt;
My object in writing to you at present is merely to draw your attention to the subject, and to suggest a friendly conference to discuss the matter more fully. I would take it as a favour if you would kindly think the matter over, and make whatever suggestions you deem necessary.
I am only writing to the following – Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End, West Bromwich Albion, and Aston Villa, and would like to hear what other clubs you would suggest.&lt;br&gt;
I am, yours very truly, William McGregor (Aston Villa F.C.)
P.S. How would Friday, 23 March 1888, suit for the friendly conference at Anderton&#x27;s Hotel, London?

McGregor chose 23 March as the date of his proposed meeting because it was the day before the FA Cup final and representatives of the country&#x27;s top clubs would be in London. Representatives from ten clubs attended, including the FA Cup finalists West Bromwich Albion and Preston North End, but it quickly became clear that clubs from the South of England were not interested in McGregor&#x27;s proposal and none attended. A second meeting was held in Manchester on , and details concerning the new competition were finalised. McGregor&#x27;s suggested name for the competition, &quot;The Association Football Union&quot; was rejected as too similar to that of the Rugby Football Union and &quot;The Football League&quot; was chosen, despite McGregor&#x27;s opposition on the grounds that he felt it might invoke associations with the unpopular Irish Land League. The term &quot;English League&quot; was avoided, to leave the possibility of future applications from Scottish clubs. McGregor also proposed a rule that only one club from each town should be included. The other founders agreed to this rule, which caused controversy, as it meant Birmingham team Mitchell St. George&#x27;s were denied membership in favour of McGregor&#x27;s Aston Villa. Twelve clubs kicked off the first season of League football in September 1888.
McGregor served as the first chairman of the League&#x27;s Management Committee. One of the committee&#x27;s main jobs was handling issues of discipline, but committee members were not barred from involvement in decisions involving their own clubs. In fact, the first disciplinary meeting saw fines issued to three of the four clubs with representatives on the committee. McGregor was re-elected unopposed in 1891. Earlier he had spoken of his pleasure that &quot;of the 132 matches in which the League clubs have taken part and in which about 300 players have taken the field, not a single fatal accident has to be recorded&quot;. A year later he oversaw the expansion of the Football League into two divisions when the rival Football Alliance was merged into the competition, but he relinquished his post later that year due to ill health, which caused him to miss meetings.

After stepping down as chairman, he was unanimously elected to an honorary position of president, a role he kept until 1894, and was named the first-ever life member of the League in 1895. The role was that of a figurehead with little actual authority, but he was used as a mediator to resolve league disagreements. In the second half of the decade McGregor&#x27;s failure to attend many committee meetings led to criticism from John Bentley, his successor as president. Bentley&#x27;s criticism achieved the desired effect; from 1899 until his health deteriorated in 1910, McGregor seldom missed a meeting. During this period McGregor was noted for his reserved nature. He was silent for large parts of committee meetings, but would contribute enthusiastically on the occasions he felt his input was necessary.

==Other football activities==
Between 1888 and 1894 McGregor also served as chairman of The Football Association (the FA), English football&#x27;s overall governing body, which had existed since 1863. He became known as a football celebrity, writing a weekly column for the &quot;Birmingham Gazette&quot; and endorsing products such as footballs, and a type of football boot which the manufacturer billed as the &quot;McGregor lace-to-toe boot&quot;. Though he held many different administrative posts in his lifetime, McGregor never played the sport competitively; his only on-pitch involvement was occasional goalkeeping during Aston Villa practices in the 1870s.
==Baseball==
In 1890 McGregor was appointed President of the Aston Villa baseball club, for the upcoming professional 1890 National League of Baseball of Great Britain.

==Death and legacy==

Although McGregor envisaged the League as a friendly union, within which clubs would share ticket revenues and work together in their mutual best interests, the immediate effect of its creation was that football came to be treated as a business for the first time, as opposed to something that players and officials simply regarded as a pastime. All the clubs involved experienced significant increases in their turnover, which at Aston Villa, McGregor&#x27;s own club, increased more than sixfold between 1889 and 1899. The wages paid to players, however, remained low due to restrictions imposed by the FA, so clubs were able to use their increased profitability to build larger stadiums and accommodate ever larger crowds of spectators. Although the League initially contained a small number of clubs, all of which were based in the northern half of the country, by the early years of the twentieth century it included clubs from all parts of England. At its peak nearly 100 clubs played in the Football League, and it remained the pre-eminent competition in English football until the 1990s, when the top clubs broke away to form the Premier League. In keeping with McGregor&#x27;s views on mutual support and co-operation, gate receipts were shared amongst the clubs until the 1980s, which helped to ensure that a select few wealthy clubs were not able to dominate the competition. McGregor himself had little interest in the business aspect of football, and was adamant that the Football League should not challenge the longstanding authority of the FA. The success of the Football League directly inspired the creation of similar competitions in other countries, beginning with Scotland, where the Scottish Football League was formed in 1890.

In May 1910, McGregor was taken ill and later confined to a nursing home. His condition worsened towards the end of 1911. His last public appearance was a committee meeting on , and he underwent an operation on . However, after a brief improvement in his condition he relapsed and died the following day. Although a devout Congregationalist, he is buried in the grounds of a Church of England church, St. Mary&#x27;s, in the Handsworth district of Birmingham, alongside his wife, who died in 1908. McGregor is remembered as the &quot;father of The Football League&quot;, an Aston Villa legend, and a legend of football in general.

Shortly before his death, the FA presented McGregor, who was at that time a vice-president of the association, with a long service medal. After his death, Aston Villa dedicated a bed in the children&#x27;s ward of one of Birmingham&#x27;s hospitals in his honour, and the Birmingham County Football Association unveiled a commemorative drinking fountain, which is now preserved at Villa Park, current home of his former club. In the modern era, Aston Villa selected him as one of the twelve inaugural members of its Hall of Fame, and named a hospitality suite at Villa Park after him. In 2008, the Aston Villa Supporters&#x27; Trust announced plans to further honour him with a bronze statue outside the stadium. The statue, by sculptor Sam Holland, is displayed outside the Directors&#x27; Entrance of the Trinity Road Stand, and was unveiled on 2009. The Trust also raised £1,000 to restore and rededicate McGregor&#x27;s grave in 2011.

==Notes==
*A. In the 1870s the concept of the referee had not been introduced to football. Matches were officiated by two umpires, one supplied by each of the two teams involved

<doc id="1195234" wikidata="Q1169249" url="?curid=1195234" title="Multiplicative group of integers modulo n">
<text>In modular arithmetic, the integers coprime (relatively prime) to &quot;n&quot; from the set formula_1 of &quot;n&quot; non-negative integers form a group under multiplication modulo &quot;n&quot;, called the multiplicative group of integers modulo &quot;n&quot;. Equivalently, the elements of this group can be thought of as the congruence classes, also known as &quot;residues&quot; modulo &quot;n&quot;, that are coprime to &quot;n&quot;.
Hence another name is the group of primitive residue classes modulo &quot;n&quot;.
In the theory of rings, a branch of abstract algebra, it is described as the group of units of the ring of integers modulo &quot;n&quot;. Here &quot;units&quot; refers to elements with a multiplicative inverse, which, in this ring, are exactly those coprime to &quot;n&quot;.

This group, usually denoted formula_2, is fundamental in number theory. It is used in cryptography, integer factorization, and primality testing. It is an abelian, finite group whose order is given by Euler&#x27;s totient function: formula_3 For prime &quot;n&quot; the group is cyclic, and in general the structure is easy to describe, but no simple general formula for finding generators is known.

==Group axioms==
It is a straightforward exercise to show that, under multiplication, the set of congruence classes modulo &quot;n&quot; that are coprime to &quot;n&quot; satisfy the axioms for an abelian group.

Indeed, &quot;a&quot; is coprime to &quot;n&quot; if and only if . Integers in the same congruence class satisfy ; hence one is coprime to &quot;n&quot; if and only if the other is. Thus the notion of congruence classes modulo &quot;n&quot; that are coprime to &quot;n&quot; is well-defined.

Since and implies , the set of classes coprime to &quot;n&quot; is closed under multiplication.

Integer multiplication respects the congruence classes, that is, and implies .
This implies that the multiplication is associative, commutative, and that the class of 1 is the unique multiplicative identity.

Finally, given &quot;a&quot;, the multiplicative inverse of &quot;a&quot; modulo &quot;n&quot; is an integer &quot;x&quot; satisfying .
It exists precisely when &quot;a&quot; is coprime to &quot;n&quot;, because in that case and by Bézout&#x27;s lemma there are integers &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; satisfying . Notice that the equation implies that &quot;x&quot; is coprime to &quot;n&quot;, so the multiplicative inverse belongs to the group.

==Notation==
The set of (congruence classes of) integers modulo &quot;n&quot; with the operations of addition and multiplication is a ring.
It is denoted formula_4  or  formula_5  (the notation refers to taking the quotient of integers modulo the ideal formula_6 or formula_7 consisting of the multiples of &quot;n&quot;).
Outside of number theory the simpler notation formula_8 is often used, though it can be confused with the -adic integers when &quot;n&quot; is a prime number.

The multiplicative group of integers modulo &quot;n&quot;, which is the group of units in this ring, may be written as (depending on the author) formula_9   formula_10   formula_11   formula_12   (for German &quot;Einheit&quot;, which translates as &quot;unit&quot;), formula_13, or similar notations. This article uses formula_14

The notation formula_15 refers to the cyclic group of order &quot;n&quot;.
It is isomorphic to the group of integers modulo &quot;n&quot; under addition.
Note that formula_4 or formula_8 may also refer to the group under addition.
For example, the multiplicative group formula_18 for a prime &quot;p&quot; is cyclic and hence isomorphic to the additive group formula_19, but the isomorphism is not obvious.

==Structure==
The order of the multiplicative group of integers modulo &quot;n&quot; is the number of integers in formula_1 coprime to &quot;n&quot;. It is given by Euler&#x27;s totient function: formula_21 .
For prime &quot;p&quot;, formula_22.

===Cyclic case===

The group formula_2 is cyclic if and only if &quot;n&quot; is 1, 2, 4, &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot; or 2&quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot;, where &quot;p&quot; is an odd prime and . For all other values of &quot;n&quot; the group is not cyclic.
This was first proved by Gauss.

This means that for these &quot;n&quot;:
:formula_24 where formula_25

By definition, the group is cyclic if and only if it has a generator &quot;g&quot; (a generating set {&quot;g&quot;} of size one), that is, the powers formula_26 give all possible residues modulo &quot;n&quot; coprime to &quot;n&quot; (the first formula_27 powers formula_28 give each exactly once).
A generator of formula_2 is called a primitive root modulo &quot;n&quot;.
If there is any generator, then there are formula_30 of them.

===Powers of 2===
Modulo 1 any two integers are congruent, i.e., there is only one congruence class, [0], coprime to 1. Therefore, formula_31 is the trivial group with element. Because of its trivial nature, the case of congruences modulo 1 is generally ignored and some authors choose not to include the case of &quot;n&quot; = 1 in theorem statements.

Modulo 2 there is only one coprime congruence class, [1], so formula_32 is the trivial group.

Modulo 4 there are two coprime congruence classes, [1] and [3], so formula_33 the cyclic group with two elements.

Modulo 8 there are four coprime congruence classes, [1], [3], [5] and [7]. The square of each of these is 1, so formula_34 the Klein four-group.

Modulo 16 there are eight coprime congruence classes [1], [3], [5], [7], [9], [11], [13] and [15]. formula_35 is the 2-torsion subgroup (i.e., the square of each element is 1), so formula_36 is not cyclic. The powers of 3, formula_37 are a subgroup of order 4, as are the powers of 5, formula_38   Thus formula_39

The pattern shown by 8 and 16 holds for higher powers 2&quot;k&quot;, : formula_40 is the 2-torsion subgroup, so formula_41 cannot be cyclic, and the powers of 3 are a cyclic subgroup of order , so:formula_42

===General composite numbers===
By the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, the group formula_2 is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power orders.

More specifically, the Chinese remainder theorem says that if formula_44 then the ring formula_4 is the direct product of the rings corresponding to each of its prime power factors:

:formula_46

Similarly, the group of units formula_2 is the direct product of the groups corresponding to each of the prime power factors:

:formula_48

For each odd prime power formula_49 the corresponding factor formula_50 is the cyclic group of order formula_51, which may further factor into cyclic groups of prime-power orders.
For powers of 2 the factor formula_52 is not cyclic unless &quot;k&quot; = 0, 1, 2, but factors into cyclic groups as described above.

The order of the group formula_27 is the product of the orders of the cyclic groups in the direct product.
The exponent of the group, that is, the least common multiple of the orders in the cyclic groups, is given by the Carmichael function formula_54 .
In other words, formula_54 is the smallest number such that for each &quot;a&quot; coprime to &quot;n&quot;, formula_56 holds.
It divides formula_27 and is equal to it if and only if the group is cyclic.

==Subgroup of false witnesses==
If &quot;n&quot; is composite, there exists a possibly proper subgroup of formula_58, called the &quot;group of false witnesses&quot;, comprising the solutions of the equation formula_59, the elements which, raised to the power , are congruent to 1 modulo &quot;n&quot;. Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem states that for &quot;n = p&quot; a prime, this group consists of all formula_60; thus for &quot;n&quot; composite, such residues &quot;x&quot; are &quot;false positives&quot; or &quot;false witnesses&quot; for the primality of &quot;n&quot;. The number &quot;x =&quot; 2 is most often used in this basic primality check, and &quot;n =&quot; is notable since formula_61, and &quot;n =&quot; 341 is the smallest composite number for which &quot;x =&quot; 2 is a false witness to primality. In fact, the false witnesses subgroup for 341 contains 100 elements, and is of index 3 inside the 300-element group formula_62.

===Examples===
====&quot;n&quot; = 9====
The smallest example with a nontrivial subgroup of false witnesses is . There are 6 residues coprime to 9: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8. Since 8 is congruent to , it follows that 88 is congruent to 1 modulo 9. So 1 and 8 are false positives for the &quot;primality&quot; of 9 (since 9 is not actually prime). These are in fact the only ones, so the subgroup {1,8} is the subgroup of false witnesses. The same argument shows that is a &quot;false witness&quot; for any odd composite &quot;n&quot;.
====&quot;n&quot; = 91====
For &quot;n&quot; = 91 (= 7 × 13), there are formula_63 residues coprime to 91, half of them (i.e., 36 of them) are false witnesses of 91, namely 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17, 22, 23, 25, 27, 29, 30, 36, 38, 40, 43, 48, 51, 53, 55, 61, 62, 64, 66, 68, 69, 74, 75, 79, 81, 82, 87, 88, and 90, since for these values of &quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;90 is congruent to 1 mod 91.

====&quot;n&quot; = 561====
&quot;n&quot; = 561 (= 3 × 11 × 17) is a Carmichael number, thus &quot;s&quot;560 is congruent to 1 modulo 561 for any integer &quot;s&quot; coprime to 561. The subgroup of false witnesses is, in this case, not proper; it is the entire group of multiplicative units modulo 561, which consists of 320 residues.

==Examples==

This table shows the cyclic decomposition of formula_2 and a generating set for &quot;n&quot; ≤ 128. The decomposition and generating sets are not unique; for example, 

formula_65 

(but formula_66). The table below lists the shortest decomposition (among those, the lexicographically first is chosen – this guarantees isomorphic groups are listed with the same decompositions). The generating set is also chosen to be as short as possible, and for &quot;n&quot; with primitive root, the smallest primitive root modulo &quot;n&quot; is listed.

For example, take formula_67. Then formula_68 means that the order of the group is 8 (i.e., there are 8 numbers less than 20 and coprime to it); formula_69 means the order of each element divides 4, that is, the fourth power of any number coprime to 20 is congruent to 1 (mod 20). The set {3,19} generates the group, which means that every element of formula_67 is of the form (where &quot;a&quot; is 0, 1, 2, or 3, because the element 3 has order 4, and similarly &quot;b&quot; is 0 or 1, because the element 19 has order 2).

Smallest primitive root mod &quot;n&quot; are (0 if no root exists)
:0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 3, 5, 2, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 2, 7, 2, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0, 3, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 7, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, ... 

Numbers of the elements in a minimal generating set of mod &quot;n&quot; are
:1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, ...

<text>is a romance anime produced by Toei Animation and aired between February 2, 2003 and January 25, 2004 on ABC, TV Asahi and other ANN affiliates. A manga version, written by Izumi Todo and drawn by Yui Ayumi, was serialized by Kodansha in the manga magazine &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; from March 2003 to February 2004, and collected in two bound volumes.

A sequel novel was released on September 12, 2017.

==Plot==
Nadja is an orphan who lives at the Applefield Orphanage, in early 20th-century England. Nadja is called by Miss Appleton, the orphanage&#x27;s owner, to receive a package delivered to her. The gifts sent for her thirteenth birthday are a dress and a diary. She is told in the accompanying letter that her mother is still alive. She later joins a traveling street performance act called the &quot;Dandelion Troupe&quot; in search of her mother after a fire breaks out in her orphanage. She travels the world, finding many friends along the way that teach her things about herself, ultimately having to learn the truth about her parentage and discovering her own destiny.

==Characters==
===Dandelion Troupe===
:

Nadja Applefield is a Franco-Austrian sunny, charming girl, with a talent for dancing and making friends wherever she goes. Even though she is young, she shoulders responsibility quite well, often taking care of the younger children at the orphanage. On the other hand, she is impulsive to the point of foolhardiness and extremely trusting, which leads others to take easy advantage of her and even abuse her thoroughly, if the right buttons are pressed. Her biggest dream is to someday be reunited with her mother.

Nadja was given to Miss Applefield to raise when she was a baby, her only possession at the time being an elaborate heart-shaped brooch. Nadja grew up at the orphanage believing her parents were dead; in the days before her 13th birthday, Nadja received a surprising gift in the mail: a trunk containing a ball gown and diary, both keepsakes belonging to her birth mother. The gown was worn by Nadja&#x27;s mother at her first ball, and the diary was her mother&#x27;s colorful description of all the people she met and danced with at that ball. Nadja is amazed by this gift, and stunned to discover that her mother might actually be alive out there somewhere. When bad men arrive to steal the brooch away from Nadja, she leaves the Applefield orphanage and begins a career as a dancer with the travelling Dandelion Troupe. Her true date of birth is unknown, even by Nadja herself, but she claims it to be on July 25.

In episode 40 of the series, she departs for England leaving Dandelion Troupe to look for witnesses to testify her identity, after finding out that her former friend Rosemary was impersonating her and was spending time with her mother. Early in the series, she meets the Harcourt twins, Francis and Keith. She initially feels attached to Francis and once mistook Keith for Francis. Halfway through the series, she seems to be falling in love with Keith, as Francis tells him, even though she doesn&#x27;t confess or seems unaware of her true feelings. She is ultimately forced to choose between them romantically. Near the end of the series, she chooses Francis over Keith because she thinks that he was the first person to help her. Indeed, the first person to help her was Keith. Since she is confused about her feelings, she chooses Francis, but later comes to realize the one that she loves is Keith. Francis is the one that makes her realize it. In the end, she did not choose either one and re-joined the Dandelion Troupe. It is hinted that she will make another decision. Interestingly, she is very popular among the males of the show, with Francis, Keith, Christian, Kennosuke, Oliver, TJ, and Fernando all developing crushes on her.
:

George is vigorous and trusting; his co-workers often call him &#x27;Dancho&#x27; (&quot;master&quot;) due to his leadership skills. He is the unofficial head of the Dandelion Troupe and a good friend to Raphael, the free-spirited troubador. George is the &quot;gentle strongman&quot; and leader of the Dandelion Troupe; the car they all travel in appears to belong to him, and he is the one who decides where they will travel to next.

George is gruff and macho, but he has his weaknesses as well. He is extremely superstitious and addicted to treasure hunting, and cannot turn down maps offered to him. His treasure hunting passion has dragged the Troupe off course in their travels several times. It is unclear if his treasure hunting exploits have actually yielded treasure, but George is always keen on going after the next treasure on the horizon.
:

A mysterious, kindly Russian old lady who makes extravagant hats or hair ornaments for dukes and nobles. She knitted a dress for Nadja as soon as she tried to join the troupe (as well as other dancing outfits for her and Kennosuke), and it is likely that she is the primary source of income for the Dandelion Troupe, along with donations.

Anna is a mysterious character: she is sort of a grandmotherly figure for everyone in the Troupe, yet none of them are really sure just how old she is. Anna sews all the costumes for the Troupe (though it seems that Nadja and Kennosuke are the only ones who occasionally change costume) and she operates the phonograph mounted on the top of the car. She&#x27;s also good at handling money, always getting discounts and lower prices.

Anna has a side business of making fashionable hats for noblewomen, and occasionally the Dandelion car must detour so Anna can deliver a hat to a buyer. In fact, Nadja and Francis meet each other thanks to Anna delivering a hat for Francis&#x27; aunt, Emma. Anna is a fortune teller; she know right away after she first sees Nadja that fate has adventures in store for her, and throughout the series she always seems to know when important things will happen to Nadja. She is an unexpectedly good fighter, due to her small size and skill with her deadly iron pan. Although celebrated in one of the episodes, Anna&#x27;s birthday is never mentioned, but it&#x27;s supposedly at the same day as Nadja&#x27;s unknown yet true birthday, as her mother celebrates it at that same day.
:

The French singer for the Dandelion Troupe. Somewhat of a skeptical and exigent lady when it comes to performing abilities, she takes kindly to Nadja when she proves her worth as a performer, and takes her under her wing openly in France. Sylvie is the &quot;songbird&quot; of the Dandelion Troupe; her beautiful voice and sexy looks captivate her audience wherever she goes. Sylvie is sort of an older sister figure for Nadja while they are on the road, good at giving Nadja advice, and is someone Nadja can turn to with her emotional problems.

Sylvie can be frivolous at times; she&#x27;s vain about her looks, likes going shopping, like other girls her age, and at one point she is seen dating Antonio Fabiani, a shady character, but she also has romantic problems of her own; she suffers an unrequited love for Raphael, a traveling musician and friend of the Dandelion Troupe, who currently cannot correspond her feelings due to his past. Sylvie is also a good fighter, thanks to her ability to use her umbrella as a weapon.
:

Abel is German and works as the Pierrot of the Troupe, in charge of comedy and laughter. He wears clown make-up while on stage, and performs all kinds of amusing antics such as juggling, acrobatics and standing on a large ball. Even though he is the Pierrot, Abel can be very serious and wise at times. He is a well-educated man, somewhat of a scholar and mentor figure; he helps Nadja to look for books in libraries and reads her mother&#x27;s diary, which is written in German, a language Nadja does not know since she has been raised in England.

Behind Abel&#x27;s Pierrot make-up lies a sad past and a family he had to leave behind; he was the doctor of an impoverished village, but spent a time in jail after stealing medicine from an hospital to save his patients from an epidemic and had to abandon his family after his release, since his son Stefan had the illness and was left in a wheelchair.
:

A gentle Irish musician, Thomas plays the violin for the Dandelion Troupe. He is quiet and talented and dedicated to his music; one of the times Thomas really gets angry is when someone insults his music and his playing, like genius pianist John Whittard does. Thomas gives Nadja her first dancing prop: a baton of sorts that has a matching castagnet that attaches to one end, and a belled piece that attaches to the other end.

Another thing about Thomas is his practicality; he is gentle and quiet, but he is down to earth when it comes to day-to-day life, becoming concerned about how the Troupe earns money and the success of their performances. He is rather cowardly when faced with violence and physical danger, and at those times Abel and Sylvie give him alcohol to make him overcome his fear.
:

A descendant of samurais, Kennosuke set off to Europe from Japan after being orphaned, determined to get money for himself and his sister Hanako. His dream is to become either a good samurai or an aviator, since one of his first bosses in Japan was a dreamy inventor who wanted to fly. In England, he sneaks into the Dandelion Troupe&#x27;s car and accidentally sets a whole disaster, but is forgiven and joins the company.

On stage, he usually performs dance and/or fighting sequences with his bokken (wooden sword), and occasionally joins Nadja in her own dance acts. He has a crush on Nadja, usually portrayed as a running gag more than a serious issue; whatever the source of those feelings is, he always acts as her best friend. He is a skilled mechanic who maintains the Dandelion Troupe&#x27;s car.
:

A young Italian girl, who is a mute, she communicates with Nadja and Kennosuke quite easily, regardless.

Rita was orphaned when her parents (lion tamers, who raised her in the circus life) died in a fire that consumed their circus two years before Nadja&#x27;s arrival. That tragic incident robbed her of the ability to speak and left her with an absolute fear of fire. After the death of her parents, Rita was adopted by the Dandelion Troupe (who witnessed the tragedy), and performs on stage with the twin lions Creme (who is white) and Chocolat (who is white like his sibling, but is dyed black by George). Despite time passing, neither of the lions seems mature. With Nadja&#x27;s help, Rita comes to terms with her trauma and gradually starts talking again.

===Applefield Orphanage===
:
A childhood friend of Nadja in the Applefield Orphanage. While Nadja is the type to always run around climbing trees with the boys, Rosemary is more dreamy and would rather watch from afar. Secretly, Rosemary is unhappy about her status as an orphan, and always likes to fantasize that she is really a beautiful princess who was lost by her family, and who will be rescued any day now (in fact, she at times refers to herself as &#x27;Princess Rosemary&#x27;). Nadja played along with Rosemary&#x27;s dreams by calling Rosemary &#x27;princess&#x27; and pretending to be her faithful knight.

When Rosemary turns 13, she, like all Applefield children, has to leave the orphanage and get a job. She works first as the maid of a wealthy family in Spain, and later as a lady-in-waiting for the scheming Herman Preminger, who disguises her as Nadja for his own purposes. Rosemary sees her second job as a way to make her own princess dreams finally come true at any costs even if it hurts Nadja, whom she sees as a traitor after a tragic misunderstanding that happens when they re-meet in Spain, months after they parted.

Rosemary originally is a good-hearted girl with hidden self-worth issues, but she soon develops an extremely nasty and cruel personality after her trust with Nadja shatters, resorting to practically anything to get what she sees as revenge. Believing that Nadja had betrayed her and seeing that her dream is at the grasp of her fingers, Rosemary becomes active and manipulative and at times even reaches levels of madness and scheming that are scary for a 13-year-old girl. Even Herman starts to fear her at one point, since he knows Rosemary is perfectly able and willing to use his weaknesses against him if needed.

In the end, Rosemary recovers her dignity and becomes tired of all the lies and manipulations, realizing that even in achieving victory through them that she is empty and unsatisfied. After speaking to Nadja one last time, she leaves the Preminger manor to &quot;build her own princess castle&quot;, in her own words.

===Preminger and Colorado clans===
;Duke Preminger
A well-respected Austrian nobleman, he is the father of Collette and Herman and Nadja&#x27;s grandfather. He is a powerful and proud man, but also cold and obsessed with family honor. The only people he seems to have a soft spot for are Oscar and Collette.

Raymond Colbert, Nadja&#x27;s father, worked for the Duke and was fired when Collette asked for permission to marry him, which was refused. As a result, the two eloped. Tragically, Raymond died in an accident while both Collette and Nadja were very sick. The Duke told his retainers to give baby Nadja away to a friend of theirs, Miss Applefield, and tell Collette that her child had perished, thus tricking her into coming back home.

Duke Preminger also hires two private investigators, Rosso and Bianco, to gather information about Nadja&#x27;s life to see if she is worthy of joining the Preminger clan. It&#x27;s hinted that he is, in fact, the one who sent Nadja the gown and the diary. Unbeknownst to him, Rosso and Bianco are actually working with his son Herman to eliminate Nadja, making Herman the family heir.

;Collette Preminger
Nadja&#x27;s mother, whose pink gown and diary were sent to Nadja around her 13th birthday, Collette is the eldest daughter of the rich Austrian nobleman Duke Preminger. She eloped with Raymond, a French musician and her piano teacher, when her father fired him after learning they were involved. They lived in poverty but happily in Paris until Raymond died in an accident. Both Nadja and Collette were very ill at the time. The Duke&#x27;s retainers gave Nadja to the orphanage and told Collette that she had died. The grief-stricken Collette was easily convinced to return home where she has lived a quiet life in the company of her father, second husband (her old friend, Count Waltmüller, a good man who takes care of her very well) and younger brother Herman.

Collette is remarkably similar to Nadja: trusting, good-hearted, stubborn when she wants to be, and slightly klutzy at times. They cross paths several times not knowing that they&#x27;re mother and daughter until almost the end.

;Herman Preminger
Nadja&#x27;s uncle and son of Duke Preminger, who openly scorned his son after he failed to meet his expectations and almost impoverished the clan with his poor financial decisions. As a result, Herman became a cynical, scheming, money- and power-hungry man who only wants to disprove Nadja&#x27;s worth as the possible future heiress of the Premingers. He first sends the private detectives Rosso and Bianco to steal Nadja&#x27;s brooch, and later hires Rosemary to pose as Nadja - a move he would later regret, as Rosemary proves to be less tractable than he thought and whenever he threatens to expose her as a fraud she reminds him he cannot do it without getting himself into bigger trouble for being responsible for this hoax.

Near the end of the series, it&#x27;s revealed that, as a result of being forced to train in order to one day succeed his father, Herman never had a chance to make friends during his whole childhood and that he resents Nadja because she was chosen over him despite having a happy childhood.

Eventually, Rosso and Bianco start taking advantage of Herman, forcing him to buy stuff for them as he cannot let his father find out about them. As a revenge, when they lock Nadja in Herman&#x27;s mansion catacombs, Herman locks them in with her. Rosso and Bianco betray Herman and let Nadja escape so that she can expose Herman&#x27;s plans. In the end, Herman is arrested and, despite his pleas, his father refuses to pay for his release, disowns him as his son and leaves him imprisoned.

;Oscar Colorado
Herman&#x27;s stepson, son of his wife Hilda, Oscar does not get along with his stepfather, but Collette and the Duke like him. In fact, Oscar&#x27;s lack of Preminger blood is the only thing keeping him from consideration as the Duke&#x27;s heir but he does not seem to care about it. He is cares for Collette, who may look to him as a surrogate for Nadja. In fact, the viewer learns of Nadja&#x27;s true past when Collette is shown telling Oscar her story. Oscar is protective of his mother Hilda, a sweet and still-young woman trapped in an unhappy marriage with Herman, who abuses her psychologically and once even physically.

Oscar is nice and gentle, but can have a devious side as well. When he attends a ball where Herman expected him to find a rich girl to marry. He instead meets people who tell him that, in order to finance his search for Nadja, Herman borrowed money from Antonio Fabiani and that he now avoids meeting his creditor since he missed the deadline to pay the debt and still does not have enough money to do so. Oscar then arranges a meeting between Antonio and Herman who says that he will be able to repay his debt as soon as he inherits his father&#x27;s fortune. Antonio suggests discussing that matter with Duke Preminger and Herman asks him not to do so. Oscar tells Antonio he hates guys like him and only arranged the meeting because he intends to use &quot;poison against poison&quot;.

Oscar is an heir of the Colorado clan, which owns the mansion where Herman lives, and has enough money to pay Herman&#x27;s debt but Oscar will not do it unless Herman agrees to leave Hilda and the Colorado mansion forever.

===Harcourt clan===
;Francis Harcourt
:
He is the son of a wealthy English nobleman, raised by his kind aunt Emma Queensbury after his mother died. Unlike other nobles, he does not believe in social classes and differences, so under the &#x27;noblesse oblige&#x27; motto he becomes an active advocate for charity and a sort of kind, sweet guardian angel for the poor. He is extremely focused in this work to the point of being somewhat workaholic, therefore ignoring the affections of girls like his close friend Marianne Hamilton.

Francis and Nadja meet in a charity ball, bonding through their common memories and crossing paths many times as they separately travel through Europe. While still good-hearted, Francis is not as ultra-perfect as he seems, especially since he has serious self-worth problems regarding both his own persona and someone he dearly loves, as well as heavy guilt trips that arise when he sees that his good intentions aren&#x27;t enough to make the poor happier. He and Keith fall in love with Nadja, but he is aware that Nadja&#x27;s affections are for Keith and accepts it. In episode 44, Nadja is forced to choose between Keith or Francis. In the end of that episode, she chooses Francis, but in episode 50 when she is talking with her mother, she talks about how she is &quot;has not come to recognize her own feelings anymore&quot;. This along with a scene later on in the episode when the Harcourt twins stated that they will &quot;play fair&quot; for the love of Nadja concludes that Nadjas love interest has actually not been chosen.
;Keith Harcourt (a.k.a. the Black Rose)
The Black Rose is a dashing, handsome and mysterious thief who steals from the rich and gives the stolen wealth to the poor, since he believes that all the wealthy people are frivolous and self-centered. He is well loved by the crowd, and famous among the journalists. His trademarks are his black costume with cape, mask, and calling card that he uses to taunt his future victims. He crosses paths with Nadja several times during her travels with the Dandelion Troupe; she is at first enraged by his dry wit and exploits, but later learns his motives and starts to empathize more with him.

The Black Rose&#x27;s true identity is revealed mid-way in the series. His true name is Keith Harcourt, and he is the older twin brother of Francis, who walked away from his family after he finished his schooling at age 15. He shares his twin&#x27;s desire to help the poor, but is far more cynical and disenchanted, since he thinks that &#x27;noblesse oblige&#x27; is insufficient. The death of their mother had an influence; while the more innocent Francis saw only Countess Harcourt&#x27;s kinder side, Keith saw her secret unhappiness upon being a bird in a gilded cage. Nadja&#x27;s love of freedom touches him so much that he appoints himself as her protector after he rescues her from Rosso and Bianco. Like his brother, he falls in love with Nadja as he protects her and is drawn to her personality. In episode 44, Nadja is forced to choose between Keith or Francis. In the end of that episode, she chooses Francis, but in episode 50 when she is talking with her mother, she talks about how she is &quot;has not come to recognize her own feelings anymore&quot;. This along with a scene later on in the episode when the Harcourt twins stated that they will &quot;play fair&quot; for the love of Nadja concludes that Nadjas love interest has actually not been chosen.

===Others===
;Harvey Livingston
A friendly, lanky and talented American journalist who works for a French newspaper, and due to his work he travels through Europe searching for the most outrageous news. He is one of the first people to give Nadja serious hints about her true origins; he examines her brooch during their meeting in Italy and, noting its craftsmanship, deduces that she is of very noble origin and warns her of how serious a matter it could be.

Despite his lazy outlook, Harvey is extremely serious when it comes to his work. He also has a strong sense of justice and greatly admires the thief Black Rose; one of his most cherished dreams is to interview him. He has looked after his little brother, T.J., ever since they were orphaned.

;Marianne Hamilton
Marianne is the daughter of another English noble clan, who has known Francis Harcourt since childhood and has loved him since then. In fact, the Hamilton and Harcourt families were planning to engage Marianne and Francis, but Nadja&#x27;s appearance disrupts these plans.

While she makes clear to Nadja that she will not give Francis up to her and says that Nadja is better off with Keith, upon hearing her family plea Marianne accepts to help Nadja and Francis to prove Nadja&#x27;s bond to the Premingers, wanting to see if she really is who she claims to be, and even saying that if Nadja truly is a Preminger, she will cancel her engagement to Francis.

Marianne is painted as a morally ambiguous character with both good (focused, honest and straightforward) and bad (manipulative and possessive of Francis) traits. She is less malicious than Rosemary and Herman, but still not completely good. Despite her selfishness, she seems to truly care for Francis, as seen in a scene with Nadja where Marianne blurts out that Nadja has Keith and the Dandelion Troupe while she only has Francis to hold on to, and runs away from Nadja almost in tears.

;Antonio Fabiani
Cynical and greedy, Antonio was raised by his widowed mother, Irma, in the slums of Venice. He left home at age 16 and gradually grew up into a disenchanted, selfish, cold businessman, who apparently won his wealth through extremely shady deals, which may or may not have included scams.

Antonio and Nadja have butted heads several times. Nadja met him when he was courting a rich girl who rejected him and he tried to silence her with money, which Nadja angrily refused. She continued to think poorly of Antonio until she learned of his past from Irma. It&#x27;s later revealed that Herman Preminger owed him a large sum of money (Herman borrowed the money so he could bribe his father&#x27;s detectives). Duke Preminger paid off the debt and then disowned his son.

Antonio seems to be somewhat of a ladies&#x27; man, going out with Sylvie once in a while (it&#x27;s hinted that he occasionally helps the Dandelion Troupe with their finances) and openly courting the heiress Julietta, with a notable lack of success.

;Fernando Gonzales
Fernando Gonzales is the son of a wealthy Spanish noble family, and all his life he has been pampered and spoiled. This resulted in Fernando&#x27;s petty, malicious personality. Fernando finds Nadja attractive (in a snotty rich kid way) but instead of being nice to her, he bosses her around and publicly humiliates her by forcing her to attend a masked ball as an entertainer, and later blackmailing her into attending another ball at his own house. His family also happened to employ Rosemary after she left the orphanage. Rosemary has a huge crush on Fernando, but his mean attitude towards her and his &quot;niceness&quot; towards Nadja is one of the things that causes Rosemary&#x27;s betrayal.

;Raphael, the troubadour
:Voiced by: Kouji Yamamoto
A kind-hearted and wise man, he&#x27;s a traveling musician and a long-time friend of the Dandelion Troupe. Once he and a young noblewoman eloped, but she was taken ill and died. Since then, Raphael sings beautiful love songs but, believing it&#x27;s his fault that his wife died and not wishing to inflict such pain on anybody else, refuses to become involved with another woman. Sylvie knows his sad history and has fallen deeply in love with him despite knowing that her love will never be requited. He counsels Nadja on occasion, telling her that she has beautiful wings.

;Christian Strand
Christian is a kind and klutzy Egyptologist who keeps bumping into Nadja. He develops feelings for Nadja, but due to her involvement with the Harcourt twins, he never really gets to tell her. Christian was a street child with a great love of knowledge; a kind professor saw him in the Museum where he worked and took him in as his pupil and, later, heir. Several years previously, Christian&#x27;s landlady worked for Duke Preminger, and was one of the people who gave the baby Nadja to Miss Applefield. She also helps the Duke send Collette&#x27;s trunk to Nadja at the orphanage.

;Leonardo Capinale
A young noble with a good heart, he is a womanizer who often shows up with different women in tow and often meets Nadja, calling her My Little Rosebud despite her complaints. Nonetheless, he is a frequent ally to Nadja and her search for his mother. He is engaged to a woman named Julietta since birth who has feelings for him but he often plays around because he wants the desire to be free before he marries.

;Thierry
A close friend of Leonardo who helps him assist Nadja in searching for her mother and is his close confidant.

;TJ
Harvey&#x27;s younger brother who has a small boyish crush on Nadja and a rivalry/friendship with Kennosuke. He looks up to Harvey.

;Oliver
One of Nadja&#x27;s friends from her orphanage. After the orphanage was burned down, his master from his previous job in London found him a factory job in France. He has a crush on her and tries several times to confess (especially in episode 11) but in the end fails and reaffirms their relationship as family. He currently works under a saddle maker.

;Julietta
A noblewoman and friend of Nadia, she is Leonardo&#x27;s fiancée due to an arranged marriage by their parents decided at their birth. She is a kind gentle woman who has loved Leonardo but he initially did not return her affection and also flirted with many women, saying he didn&#x27;t want to be tied down. Antonio later pursued her to obtain her social status but later grew to fall for her. Leonardo then began to see her as a woman. She meets with Nadia in episode 44 and gives advice on who to choose between Keith and Francis. Julietta herself says she chose the person she fell for not the one who fell for her.

<doc id="1195246" wikidata="Q7609864" url="?curid=1195246" title="Stephen M. Wolownik">
<text>Stephen M. &quot;Steve&quot; Wolownik (July 22, 1946 – May 18, 2000) was a pioneer in the Russian and Eastern European music community in the United States. He was a co-founder of the Balalaika and Domra Association of America.

== Biography ==

Born in Chester, Pennsylvania, Wolownik grew up with Russian and Ukrainian music. As a child and young adult, he participated in the balalaika orchestra at St. Nicholas&#x27;s Russian Orthodox Church in Philadelphia under the tutelage of Paul Kauriga of the Kovriga Balalaika Orchestra. He also played under Anastasia Karnow.

Wolownik received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Pennsylvania, where he founded the University of Pennsylvania Balalaika Orchestra (commonly known as &quot;PennBO&quot; or &quot;Penn Balalaika Orchestra&quot;) in 1964. PennBO was unique in that, with the exception of the Tamburitzans at Pittsburgh&#x27;s Duquesne University, it was the only university-level music ensemble dedicated solely to Eastern European music.

He later moved to Los Angeles, where he received a master&#x27;s degree in ethnomusicology from the University of California, Los Angeles. While there, he founded another balalaika group, the Odessa Balalaikas. Later, he founded balalaika groups in Houston and Atlanta.

After returning to Philadelphia from Los Angeles, Wolownik received a master&#x27;s degree in library science from Drexel University, whereupon he worked as a reference librarian at the Lippincott Library of the Wharton School. He also co-founded two more balalaika ensembles, The Balalaika Russe and The Gypsy Balalaikas, the members of both of which were from the Philadelphia area.

Wolownik also continued directing the Penn Balalaika Orchestra until its demise in 1996.

He later moved to Mount Laurel, New Jersey, where he was an assistant library director at the Mount Laurel Public Library until his death in 2000. Wolownik is buried in Lawn Croft Cemetery in Linwood, Pennsylvania, in the shadow of his boyhood home.

== Influence ==

Wolownik is largely credited with reviving interest in the cabaret-style balalaika ensemble in the United States and reconnecting the balalaika and domra with their peasant roots. Popular in the 1910s and 1920s, the cabaret-style ensemble usually had no more than 10 members and played in small, intimate settings, often performing pieces which were not precisely Russian in appellation, but perhaps more Gypsy, Jewish, or Ukrainian in origin. The cabaret-style ensemble fell into disfavor with the rise of Communism, as Soviet government preferred huge Andreyev-style state-run ensembles with elaborate orchestral arrangements as sort of an antipode to the Western orchestra.

Wolownik, having established balalaika societies and groups in Atlanta, Maine, and Pennsylvania, was well known in the balalaika community in the United States and abroad for his simple yet deep arrangements of tunes for small balalaika ensembles. In keeping with the cabaret tradition, Wolownik did not limit himself strictly to Russian music, but also arranged Romanian, Hungarian, Moldavian, Gypsy, and klezmer tunes, some of which had never been played on anything other than the native instruments for which they were composed.

Despite his commitment to serious musicianship, some have claimed that Wolownik, who had an irreverent sense of humor, was a living embodiment of the skomorokhi of old Russia, street musicians who actively poked fun at both the Tsars and the Church.

The Balalaika and Domra Association of America now numbers several hundred members. It is actively involved in promoting traditional Russian music in the United States. It holds a yearly convention in which luminaries of Russian music participate by teaching and performing.

<text>Friedrich V. Kratochwil is a prominent scholar in the field of International Relations (IR), known for his contributions to constructivism and his focus on norms, rules, and the processes of social construction in international politics. His work emphasizes the role of language, meaning, and social practices in shaping international relations, offering a counterpoint to traditional rationalist and materialist perspectives in IR.
==History==

Kratochwil was born in Lundenburg (former Czechoslovakia). After graduating in 1963 from the humanistic Maximiliansgymnasium in Munich, he studied philosophy, history and political science at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität. He received in 1969 his university degree (M.A.) in International Relations from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. In 1976, he received his doctorate (Ph.D.) from Princeton University in political science with a focus on international relations.

Kratochwil taught at American universities in Princeton, Columbia, Pennsylvania and at the European University Institute in Florence. Until 2003, Friedrich Kratochwil was Professor of International Politics at the Geschwister Scholl Institute of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich.

One of his famous books is &quot;Rules, Norms and Decisions&quot; (1989), introducing constructivism to the discipline, a landmark study in the discipline of international relations.

He has been the editor of the European Journal of International Relations and member of the editorial boards of several journals, including the Journal of International Relations of the Asia-Pacific, International Studies Quarterly, International Organization, World Politics, and member of the editorial advisory board of .

<text>A beneficiary in the broadest sense is a natural person or other legal entity who receives money or other benefits from a benefactor. For example, the beneficiary of a life insurance policy is the person who receives the payment of the amount of insurance after the death of the insured. In trust law, beneficiaries are also known as &quot;cestui que use&quot;. 

Most beneficiaries may be designed to designate where the assets will go when the owner(s) dies. However, if the primary beneficiary or beneficiaries are not alive or do not qualify under the restrictions, the assets will probably pass to the &quot;contingent beneficiaries&quot;. Other restrictions such as being married or more creative ones can be used by a benefactor to attempt to control the behavior of the beneficiaries. Some situations such as retirement accounts do not allow any restrictions beyond the death of the primary beneficiaries, but trusts allow any restrictions that are not illegal or for an illegal purpose.

The concept of a &quot;beneficiary&quot; will also frequently figure in contracts other than insurance policies. A third-party beneficiary of a contract is a person whom the parties intend to benefit from its provisions but who is not a party to the contract. A software distributor, for example, may seek provisions protecting its customers from infringement claims. A software licensor may include in its agreements provisions that protect those who provided code to that licensor.

In the context of development aid, the term &quot;beneficiaries&quot; refer to the persons and the communities that use the project outputs: the entities that development-aid projects.

<text>A reverberation room or reverberation chamber is a room designed to create reverberation, a diffuse or random incidence sound field (i.e. one with a uniform distribution of acoustic energy and random direction of sound incidence over a short time period). Reverberation chambers tend to be large rooms (the resulting sound field becomes more diffused with increased path length) and have very hard exposed surfaces. The change of impedance (compared to the air) these surfaces present to incident sound is so large that virtually all of the acoustic energy that hits a surface is reflected back into the room. Arranging the room surfaces (including the ceiling) to be non-parallel helps inhibit the formation of standing waves - additional acoustic diffusers are often used to create more reflecting surfaces and further encourage even distribution of any particular sound field.

Reverberation chambers are used in acoustics as well as in electrodynamics, such as for measurement microphone calibration, measurement of the sound power of a source, and measurement of the absorption coefficient of a material. All these techniques assume the sound field in the chamber to be diffuse, and will normally use a broadband sound source (e.g. white noise or pink noise) so that the resulting sound field contains acoustic energy across the whole audible range.

<text>The Third Lake Washington Bridge, officially the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge, is a floating bridge in the Seattle metropolitan area of the U.S. state of Washington. It is one of the Interstate 90 floating bridges, carrying the westbound lanes of Interstate 90 across Lake Washington between Mercer Island and Seattle. The floating bridge is the fifth-longest of its kind in the world, at 5,811 feet (1,772 m).

==History==

A third floating bridge on Lake Washington was proposed in the 1950s during construction of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge to the north. After several locations were considered, a span parallel to the existing Lake Washington Floating Bridge (now the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge) was chosen in the 1960s. The first pontoon for the new bridge was floated from Everett to Lake Washington in September 1983.

The bridge opened in June 1989 and was named in 1993 for Homer More Hadley, who designed the bridge&#x27;s companion span, the parallel Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge. Hadley also designed the McMillin Bridge in Pierce County. It originally carried bidirectional traffic while the older Murrow Bridge underwent extensive renovations. On November 25, 1990, sections of the Murrow Bridge sank during a windstorm that flooded several pontoons; the sinking sections also severed 13 of the 58 anchor cables of the Hadley Bridge, which remained closed for several days.

Following the reopening of the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge, two reversible high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes were set up on the Hadley Bridge to accommodate the traffic flow between Seattle and the suburban Eastside (westbound in the morning, eastbound in the evenings). The lanes were opened to all Mercer Island commuters, including single-occupant vehicles, per a 1978 agreement negotiated by the city government. The reversible lanes were planned to be converted for light rail use at a future date, but design issues prevented a simple conversion from being feasible.

Sound Transit and the Washington State Department of Transportation added HOV lanes to the bridge&#x27;s westbound lanes in 2017. This preceded construction of the 2 Line, a light rail line from downtown Seattle to Bellevue and Redmond which will use the former reversible express lanes. When this section of the 2 Line, scheduled to be completed in 2025, begins operation, it will be the first permanent railroad on a floating bridge. (In a temporary capacity, the Maxau Pontoon Rhine Bridge of 1865 in Germany preceded it.) The light rail line will employ a set of floating spans for tracks on the transition between pontoons and the fixed spans.

==Usage==

The bridge carries four westbound lanes, including a HOV lane, as well as a bicycle and pedestrian path on the north side. The path is wide and includes two barriers: a outer railing and a concrete barrier facing traffic.

Prior to 2017, it also carried two reversible lanes, configured to normally carry westbound traffic on weekday mornings and eastbound traffic at other times. Use of the reversible express lanes was restricted to HOV traffic, except for vehicles traveling to and from Mercer Island. The express lanes were closed to road traffic on June 5, 2017, rebuilt for light rail and are dedicated for the trains of &quot;East Link Extension&quot; (opening planned in 2025).

With a total of five traffic lanes and three full-sized shoulders, the Third Lake Washington Bridge was the widest floating bridge in the world, until the completion of the new Evergreen Point Floating Bridge in 2016.

<doc id="1195277" wikidata="Q7873716" url="?curid=1195277" title="USS Sachem (1776)">
<text>The first Sachem was a sloop of war in the United States Navy during the American Revolutionary War.

The Continental brigantine , commanded by Captain John Barry, captured the sloop , a tender to British frigate , off the Delaware Capes on 7 April 1776, after a fierce, one-hour fight. &quot;Lexington&quot; escorted her prize to Philadelphia where &quot;Edward&quot; was libeled on 13 April, condemned on 29 April, and purchased by the Marine Committee of the Continental Congress on 2 May. Renamed USS &quot;Sachem&quot;, the sloop was fitted out under the direction of 17-year-old Joshua Barney who received his commission as a lieutenant while the ship was being prepared for sea. Shortly before &quot;Sachem&quot; was ready for action, Captain Isaiah Robinson assumed command of the sloop.

On 6 July, &quot;Sachem&quot;, carrying dispatches for Barry who was patrolling the mouth of the bay, dropped down the Delaware. The orders directed Barry to put to sea in &quot;Lexington&quot;. Since Barry declined the suggestion that the two ships cruise together, they parted after clearing the capes. On 12 August, &quot;Sachem&quot; fought brigantine, &quot;Three Friends&quot;, for over two hours before the British letter of marque surrendered.

Robinson sent the prize to Philadelphia for adjudication and, since &quot;Sachem&quot; had suffered substantial damage in the battle, she followed &quot;Three Friends&quot; into port for repairs.

After &quot;Sachem&quot; was back in fighting trim, she was placed under the direction of the Secret Committee which handled procurement matters for the Continental Congress. Few details of her subsequent operations have survived. It is known that she sailed for the West Indies on 29 March 1777 carrying dispatches for William Bingham, the Continental agent in Martinique. These letters were duplicates of earlier messages which had gone astray when the frigate was diverted to Charleston, South Carolina for repairs after losing two masts.

It is said that &quot;Sachem&quot; was burned in the Delaware River the following autumn to avoid capture by the British, but evidence to substantiate this claim is scant.

<doc id="1195281" wikidata="Q2105663" url="?curid=1195281" title="Rugby league positions">
<text>A rugby league team consists of 13 players on the field, with 4 substitutes on the bench. Each of the 13 players is assigned a position, normally with a standardised number, which reflects their role in attack and defence, although players can take up any position at any time.

Players are divided into two general types, forwards and backs. Forwards are generally chosen for their size and strength. They are expected to run with the ball, to attack, and to make tackles. Forwards are required to improve the team&#x27;s field position thus creating space and time for the backs. Backs are usually smaller and faster, though a big, fast player can be of advantage in the backs. Their roles require speed and ball-playing skills, rather than just strength, to take advantage of the field position gained by the forwards. Typically forwards tend to operate in the centre of the field, while backs operate nearer to the touch-lines, where more space can usually be found.

==Names and numbering==


The laws of the game recognise standardised numbering of positions. The starting side normally wear the numbers corresponding to their positions, only changing in the case of substitutions and position shifts during the game. In some competitions, such as Super League, players receive a squad number to use all season, no matter what positions they play in.

The positions and the numbers are defined by the game&#x27;s laws as:

; Backs
* 1 Full back 
* 2 Right wing 
* 3 Right centre 
* 4 Left centre 
* 5 Left wing 
* 6 Stand-off half (Predominately used in the Northern hemisphere) or Five-eighth (Elsewhere)
* 7 Scrum half (Predominately used in the Northern hemisphere) or Half-back

;Forwards
* 8 Prop (Front Row Forward)
* 9 Hooker or Dummy-half
* 10 Prop (Front Row Forward)
* 11 Second Row Forward
* 12 Second Row Forward
* 13 Lock Forward or Loose Forward

In practice, the term &#x27;front row forward&#x27; is used less frequently than the term &#x27;Prop&#x27; of which a team has two. The scrum half is often known as the half back, especially in Australasia, and the lock forward is usually known as loose forward in England.

== Backs ==
There are seven backs, numbered 1 to 7. For these positions, the emphasis is on speed and ball-handling skills. Generally, the &quot;back-line&quot; consists of smaller, more agile players.

=== Fullback ===
Numbered 1, the fullback&#x27;s primary role is the last line of defence, standing behind the main line of defenders. Defensively, fullbacks must be able to chase and tackle any player who breaks the first line of defence, and must be able to catch and return kicks made by the attacking side. Their role in attack is usually as a support player, and they are often used to come into the line to create an overlap in attack. Fullbacks that feature in their respective nations&#x27; rugby league halls of fame are France&#x27;s Puig Aubert, Australia&#x27;s Clive Churchill, Charles Fraser, Graeme Langlands, Graham Eadie and Billy Slater, Great Britain/Wales&#x27; Jim Sullivan, New Zealand&#x27;s Des White and Great Britain&#x27;s Kris Radlinski.


=== Threequarters ===
There are four threequarters: two wingers and two centres - right wing (2), right centre (3), left centre (4) and left wing (5). Typically these players work in pairs, with one winger and one centre occupying each side of the field.

==== Wing ====

Also known as wingers. There are two wings in a rugby league team, numbered 2 and 5. They are usually positioned closest to the touch-line on each side of the field. They are generally among the fastest players in a team, with the speed to exploit space that is created for them and finish an attacking move. In defence their primary role is to mark their opposing wingers, and they are also usually required to catch and return kicks made by an attacking team, often dropping behind the defensive line to help the fullback. Wingers that feature in their nations&#x27; rugby league halls of fame are Great Britain&#x27;s Billy Batten, Billy Boston and Clive Sullivan, Australia&#x27;s Brian Bevan, John Ferguson, Ken Irvine, Harold Horder and Brian Carlson, South African Tom van Vollenhoven and France&#x27;s Raymond Contrastin.

==== Centre ====
There are only 2 centres, right and left, numbered 3 and 4 respectively. They are usually positioned just inside the wingers and are typically the second-closest players to the touch-line on each side of the field. In attack their primary role is to provide an attacking threat out wide and as such they often need to be some of the fastest players on the pitch, often providing the pass for their winger to finish off a move, by drawing and passing to give the fast wingers space to move. In defence, they are expected to mark their opposite centre. Centres that feature in their countries&#x27; halls of fame are France&#x27;s Max Rousié, England&#x27;s Eric Ashton, Harold Wagstaff and Neil Fox, Wales&#x27; Gus Risman and Australia&#x27;s Reg Gasnier, H &quot;Dally&quot; Messenger, Dave Brown, Jim Craig, Bob Fulton, Mal Meninga, and Greg Inglis.

===Half pair===
There are two halves. Positioned more centrally in attack, beside or behind the forwards, they direct the ball and are usually the team&#x27;s main play-makers, and as such are typically required to be the most skillful and intelligent players on the team. These players also usually perform most tactical kicking for their team.

==== Stand-off / five-eighth ====
Numbered 6, the stand-off or five-eighth is usually a strong passer and runner, while also being agile. Often this player is referred to as &quot;second receiver&quot;, as in attacking situations they are typically the second player to receive the ball (after the half-back) and are then able to initiate an attacking move.

====Scrum-half / half-back====
Numbered 7, the scrum-half or half-back is usually involved in directing the team&#x27;s play. The position is sometimes referred to as &quot;first receiver&quot;, as half-backs are often the first to receive the ball from the dummy-half after a play-the-ball. This makes them important decision-makers in attack.

==Forwards==
A rugby league forward pack consists of six players who tend to be bigger and stronger than backs, and generally rely more on their strength and size to fulfill their roles than play-making skills. The forwards also traditionally formed and contested scrums; however, in the modern game it is largely immaterial which players pack down in the scrum. Despite this, forwards are still referred to by the position they would traditionally take in the scrum.

===Front row===
The front row of the scrum traditionally included the hooker with the two props on either side. All three may be referred to as front-rowers, but this term is now most commonly just used as a colloquialism to refer to the props.

====Hooker====
The hooker or rake, numbered 9, traditionally packs in the middle of the scrum&#x27;s front row. The position is named because of the traditional role of &quot;hooking&quot; the ball back with the foot when it enters the scrum. It is usually the hooker who plays in the dummy-half position, receiving the ball from the play-the-ball and continuing the team&#x27;s attack by passing the ball to a teammate or by running with the ball. As such, hookers are required to be reliable passers and often possess a similar skill-set to half backs.

====Prop====

There are two props, numbered 8 and 10, who pack into the front row of the scrum on either side of the hooker. Sometimes called &quot;bookends&quot; in Australasia, the props are usually the largest and heaviest players on a team. In attack, their size and strength means that they are primarily used for running directly into the defensive line, as a kind of &quot;battering ram&quot; to simply gain metres. Similarly, props are relied upon to defend against such running from the opposition&#x27;s forwards. Prop forwards that feature in their respective nations&#x27; rugby league halls of fame are Australia&#x27;s Arthur Beetson, Duncan Hall, Frank Burge and Herb Steinohrt and New Zealand&#x27;s Cliff Johnson.

===Back row===
Three forwards make up the back row of the scrum: two second-rowers and a loose forward. All three may be referred to as back-rowers.

====Second-row forward====
Second-row forwards are numbered 11 and 12. While their responsibilities are similar in many ways to the props, these players typically possess more speed and agility and take up a wider position in attack and defence. Often each second rower will cover a specific side of the field, working in unison with their respective centre and winger. Second rowers are often relied upon to perform large numbers of tackles in defence. Second-row forwards that feature in their nations&#x27; halls of fame include New Zealand&#x27;s Mark Graham, Australia&#x27;s Norm Provan, George Treweek and Harry Bath, France&#x27;s Jean Galia, and Great Britain &amp; England&#x27;s Martin Hodgson.

====Loose forward / lock forward ====
Numbered 13, the loose forward or lock forward packs behind the two-second-rows in the scrum. Some teams choose to simply deploy a third prop in the loose forward position, while other teams use a more skilful player as an additional playmaker. Loose forwards that feature in their nation&#x27;s Halls of Fame include Australia&#x27;s Ron Coote, Johnny Raper, Bradley Clyde and Wally Prigg, Great Britain&#x27;s Vince Karalius, Ellery Hanley and &#x27;Rocky&#x27; Turner, and New Zealand&#x27;s Charlie Seeling.

==Interchange==
In addition to the thirteen on-field players, there are a maximum of five substitute players who start the game on their team&#x27;s bench. Usually, they will be numbered 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18. Each player normally keeps their number for the whole game, regardless of which position they play in. That is, if player number 14 replaces the fullback, they will wear the number 14 for the whole game, and not change shirts to display the number 1. 

The rules governing if and when a replacement can be used have varied over the history of the game; currently they can be used for any reason by their coach – typically because of injury, to manage fatigue, for tactical reasons or due to poor performance. Under current rules, players who have been substituted are typically allowed to be substituted back into the game later on. Leagues in different countries have had different rules on how many interchanges can be made in a game. the Super League allowed up to ten interchanges per team in each game, this was reduced to eight interchanges per team per game, commencing in the 2019 season. Commencing in the 2016 season, Australia&#x27;s National Rugby League permits up to eight interchanges per team per game. Additionally, if a player is injured due to foul play and an opposition player has been sin-binned or sent off then the injured player&#x27;s team is given a free interchange. Often an interchange bench will include at least one (and usually two) replacement props, as it is generally considered to be the most physically taxing position and these players are likely to tire the quickest.

===Concussion substitute===

Commencing in 2021, a player named as the squad&#x27;s 18th player on match day is able to take the field when three players fail a head injury assessment; or when a player suffers a match-ending injury caused by foul play, in which the opposing player was either sin-binned or sent off. Since the change, there have been calls to reduce the number of players that suffer a match-ending injury to two players, in the wake of a few incidents in the NRL.

The concussion substitute was used during the 2021 Rugby League World Cup played in 2022, and adopted by the RFL in 2023.

==Roles==
As well as their positions, players&#x27; roles may be referred to by a range of other terms.

===Marker===
Following a tackle, the defending team may position two players – known as markers – at the play-the-ball to stand, one behind the other facing the tackled player and the attacking team&#x27;s dummy-half.

===Dummy half===
The dummy half or (acting half-back) is the player who stands behind the play-the-ball and collects the ball, before passing, running or kicking the ball. The hooker has become almost synonymous with the dummy half role. However, any player of any position can play the role at any time and this often happens during a game, particularly when the hooker is the player tackled.

===First receiver===
The first receiver is the name given to the first player to receive the ball off the play-the-ball, i.e. from the dummy-half.

===Second receiver===
If the ball is passed immediately by the first receiver, then the player catching it is sometimes referred to as the second receiver.

===Utility===
A player who can play in a number of different positions is often referred to as a &quot;utility player&quot;, &quot;utility forward&quot;, or &quot;utility back&quot;.

===Goal-kicker===
Although any player can attempt their team&#x27;s kicks at goal (penalty kicks or conversions), most teams have specific players who train extensively at kicking, and often use only one player to take goal kicks during a game.

===Captain===
The captain is the on-field leader of a team and a point of contact between the referee and a team, and can be a player of any position. Some of the captain&#x27;s responsibilities are stipulated in the laws.

Before a match, the two teams&#x27; captains toss a coin with the referee. The captain that wins the toss can decide to kick off or can choose which end of the field to defend. The captain that loses the toss then takes the other of the alternatives.

The captain is often seen as responsible for a team&#x27;s discipline. When a team persistently breaks the laws, the referee while issuing a caution will often speak with the team&#x27;s captain to encourage them to improve their team&#x27;s discipline.

The captains are also traditionally responsible for appointing a substitute should a player suffer an injury during a game, although in the professional game there are other procedures in place for dealing with this.

<text>A degree (in full, a degree of arc, arc degree, or arcdegree), usually denoted by ° (the degree symbol), is a measurement of a plane angle in which one full rotation is 360 degrees.

It is not an SI unit—the SI unit of angular measure is the radian—but it is mentioned in the SI brochure as an accepted unit. Because a full rotation equals 2 radians, one degree is equivalent to radians.

==History==

The original motivation for choosing the degree as a unit of rotations and angles is unknown. One theory states that it is related to the fact that 360 is approximately the number of days in a year. Ancient astronomers noticed that the sun, which follows through the ecliptic path over the course of the year, seems to advance in its path by approximately one degree each day. Some ancient calendars, such as the Persian calendar and the Babylonian calendar, used 360 days for a year. The use of a calendar with 360 days may be related to the use of sexagesimal numbers.

Another theory is that the Babylonians subdivided the circle using the angle of an equilateral triangle as the basic unit, and further subdivided the latter into 60 parts following their sexagesimal numeric system. The earliest trigonometry, used by the Babylonian astronomers and their Greek successors, was based on chords of a circle. A chord of length equal to the radius made a natural base quantity. One sixtieth of this, using their standard sexagesimal divisions, was a degree.

Aristarchus of Samos and Hipparchus seem to have been among the first Greek scientists to exploit Babylonian astronomical knowledge and techniques systematically. Timocharis, Aristarchus, Aristillus, Archimedes, and Hipparchus were the first Greeks known to divide the circle in 360 degrees of 60 arc minutes. Eratosthenes used a simpler sexagesimal system dividing a circle into 60 parts.

Another motivation for choosing the number 360 may have been that it is readily divisible: 360 has 24 divisors, making it one of only 7 numbers such that no number less than twice as much has more divisors . Furthermore, it is divisible by every number from 1 to 10 except 7. This property has many useful applications, such as dividing the world into 24 time zones, each of which is nominally 15° of longitude, to correlate with the established 24-hour day convention.

Finally, it may be the case that more than one of these factors has come into play. According to that theory, the number is approximately 365 because of the apparent movement of the sun against the celestial sphere, and that it was rounded to 360 for some of the mathematical reasons cited above.

==Subdivisions==
For many practical purposes, a degree is a small enough angle that whole degrees provide sufficient precision. When this is not the case, as in astronomy or for geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), degree measurements may be written using decimal degrees (&quot;DD notation&quot;); for example, 40.1875°.

Alternatively, the traditional sexagesimal unit subdivisions can be used: one degree is divided into 60 &quot;minutes (of arc)&quot;, and one minute into 60 &quot;seconds (of arc)&quot;. Use of degrees-minutes-seconds is also called DMS notation. These subdivisions, also called the &quot;arcminute&quot; and &quot;arcsecond&quot;, are represented by a single prime (′) and double prime (″) respectively. For example, . Additional precision can be provided using decimal fractions of an arcsecond.

Maritime charts are marked in degrees and decimal minutes to facilitate measurement; 1 minute of latitude is 1 nautical mile. The example above would be given as 40° 11.25′ (commonly written as 11′25 or 11′.25).

The older system of thirds, fourths, etc., which continues the sexagesimal unit subdivision, was used by al-Kashi and other ancient astronomers, but is rarely used today. These subdivisions were denoted by writing the Roman numeral for the number of sixtieths in superscript: 1I for a &quot;prime&quot; (minute of arc), 1II for a second, 1III for a third, 1IV for a fourth, etc. Hence, the modern symbols for the minute and second of arc, and the word &quot;second&quot; also refer to this system.

SI prefixes can also be applied as in, e.g., millidegree, microdegree, etc.

==Alternative units==

In most mathematical work beyond practical geometry, angles are typically measured in radians rather than degrees. This is for a variety of reasons; for example, the trigonometric functions have simpler and more &quot;natural&quot; properties when their arguments are expressed in radians. These considerations outweigh the convenient divisibility of the number 360. One complete turn (360°) is equal to 2&quot;&quot; radians, so 180° is equal to radians, or equivalently, the degree is a mathematical constant: 1° = .

One turn (corresponding to a cycle or revolution) is equal to 360°.

With the invention of the metric system, based on powers of ten, there was an attempt to replace degrees by decimal &quot;degrees&quot; in France and nearby countries, where the number in a right angle is equal to 100 gon with 400 gon in a full circle (1° = gon). This was called or &quot;grad&quot;. Due to confusion with the existing term &quot;grad(e)&quot; in some northern European countries (meaning a standard degree, of a turn), the new unit was called in German (whereas the &quot;old&quot; degree was referred to as ), likewise in Danish, Swedish and Norwegian (also &quot;gradian&quot;), and in Icelandic. To end the confusion, the name &quot;gon&quot; was later adopted for the new unit. Although this idea of metrification was abandoned by Napoleon, grades continued to be used in several fields and many scientific calculators support them. Decigrades () were used with French artillery sights in World War I.

An angular mil, which is most used in military applications, has at least three specific variants, ranging from to . It is approximately equal to one milliradian ( ). A mil measuring of a revolution originated in the imperial Russian army, where an equilateral chord was divided into tenths to give a circle of 600 units. This may be seen on a lining plane (an early device for aiming indirect fire artillery) dating from about 1900 in the St. Petersburg Museum of Artillery.

<text>The term degree is used in several scales of temperature, with the notable exception of kelvin, primary unit of temperature for engineering and the physical sciences. The degree symbol ° is usually used, followed by the initial letter of the unit; for example, &quot;°C&quot; for degree Celsius. A degree can be defined as a set change in temperature measured against a given scale; for example, one degree Celsius is one-hundredth of the temperature change between the point at which water starts to change state from solid to liquid state and the point at which it starts to change from its liquid to gaseous state.

==Scales of temperature measured in degrees==
Common scales of temperature measured in degrees:
* Celsius (°C)
* Fahrenheit (°F)
* Rankine (°R or °Ra), which uses the Fahrenheit scale, adjusted so that 0 degrees Rankine is equal to absolute zero.

Unlike the degree Fahrenheit and degree Celsius, the kelvin is no longer referred to or written as a degree (but was before 1967). The kelvin is the primary unit of temperature measurement in the physical sciences, but is often used in conjunction with the degree Celsius, which has the same magnitude.

Other scales of temperature:
* Delisle (°D)
* Newton (°N)
* Réaumur (°Ré)
* Rømer (°Rø)
* Wedgwood (°W)

==Kelvin==
The &quot;degree Kelvin&quot; () is a former name and symbol for the SI unit of temperature on the thermodynamic (absolute) temperature scale. Since 1967, it has been known simply as the kelvin, with symbol K (without a degree symbol). Degree absolute (°A) is obsolete terminology, often referring specifically to the kelvin but sometimes the degree Rankine as well.

==Comparisons== 
* Boiling point of water: 100.0 °C / 212.0 °F
* Melting point of ice: 0.0 °C / 32.0 °F
* Typical human body temperature: 37.0 °C / 98.6 °F
* Room temperature: 20–25 °C / 68–77 °F

==Temperature conversions==

All three of the major temperature scales are related through a linear equation, and so the conversion between any of them is relatively straightforward. For instance, any Celsius temperature &quot;c&quot; °C can be calculated from a corresponding Fahrenheit temperature &quot;f&quot; °F or absolute temperature &quot;k&quot; K.

The equations above may also be rearranged to solve for formula_2 or formula_3, to give

His roles have included Bill Lester in &quot;She Came to the Valley&quot; (1979), Pfc Glenn Kelly in &quot;Nashville&quot; (1975), Wes Hightower in &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; (1980), astronaut Alan Shepard in &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (1983), Emmett in &quot;Silverado&quot; (1985), Captain Bart Mancuso in &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1990), Jack Crawford in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991), John Adcox in &quot;Backdraft&quot; (1991), Bill Burton in &quot;Absolute Power&quot; (1997), Roger in &quot;Training Day&quot; (2001), Ezra Kramer in &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; (2007), Chris Chenery in &quot;Secretariat&quot; (2010), Kevin Garvey Sr. in the HBO series &quot;The Leftovers&quot; (2014–2017), and as Stick in the Marvel Cinematic Universe series &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2015–2016) and &quot;The Defenders&quot; (2017).

==Early life==
Glenn has Irish and Native American ancestry. During his childhood, he was regularly ill, and for a year was bed-ridden, including having scarlet fever. Through intense training in boxing, wrestling and tang soo do, he recovered from his illnesses, although he would have a limp for the next couple of years.

After graduating from a Pittsburgh High School, Glenn entered the College of William &amp; Mary, where he majored in English and graduated in 1961. He joined the United States Marine Corps for three years, then worked for about seven months in 1963 as a news and sports reporter for the &quot;Kenosha News&quot;, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He tried to become an author, but found he could not write dialogue that satisfied the readers. To learn the art of dialogue, he began taking acting classes taught by William Hickey.

==Career== 
Glenn made his Broadway debut in &quot;The Impossible Years&quot; in 1965. He joined George Morrison’s acting class, helping direct student plays to pay for his studies and appearing onstage in La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club productions.

In 1968, he joined The Actors Studio and began working in professional theatre and TV. Two of Glenn&#x27;s early television roles were as Hal Currin in the 1966 crime series &quot;Hawk&quot;, starring Burt Reynolds, and Calvin Brenner on the CBS daytime serial &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;. In 1970, director James Bridges offered him his first movie role, in &quot;The Baby Maker&quot;, released the same year.

Glenn spent eight years in Los Angeles, California, acting in small roles in films and doing TV stints, including a TV movie &quot;Gargoyles.&quot; In 1978, Glenn left Los Angeles with his family for Ketchum, Idaho, and worked as a barman, huntsman, and mountain ranger, occasionally acting in Seattle stage productions. He appeared in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979) and worked with directors such as Jonathan Demme and Robert Altman.

In 1980, he appeared as ex-convict Wes Hightower in Bridges&#x27; &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;. After that, he starred in the World War II horror film, &quot;The Keep&quot; (1983), and action films such as &quot;Wild Geese II&quot; (1985) opposite Laurence Olivier, &quot;Silverado&quot; (1985), and &quot;The Challenge&quot; (1982), and drama films such as &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (1983), TV film &quot;Countdown to Looking Glass&quot; (1984), &quot;The River&quot; (1984), and &quot;Off Limits&quot; (1988) as he alternately played good guys and bad guys during the 1980s. He returned to Broadway in &quot;Burn This&quot; in 1987. That same year, he tried his hand at gangster movies when he starred as the real-life sheriff turned gunman Verne Miller in the movie &quot;Gangland: The Verne Miller Story&quot;, which was given a theatrical release only in Finland and went straight to video in the U.S.

In the beginning of the 1990s, Glenn&#x27;s career was at its peak as he appeared in several well-known films, such as &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1990), &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991), &quot;Backdraft&quot; (1991), and &quot;The Player&quot; (1992). He played a vicious mob hitman in a critically acclaimed performance in &quot;Night of the Running Man&quot; (1995). Later, he gravitated toward more challenging movie roles, such as in the Freudian farce &quot;Reckless&quot; (1995), tragicomedy &quot;Edie &amp; Pen&quot; (1997), and Ken Loach&#x27;s sociopolitical declaration &quot;Carla&#x27;s Song&quot;. In the late 1990s, Glenn alternated between mainstream films (&quot;Courage Under Fire&quot; (1996), &quot;Absolute Power&quot; (1997)), independent projects (&quot;Lesser Prophets&quot; (1997) and &quot;Larga distancia&quot; (1998), written by his daughter Dakota Glenn) and TV (&quot;Naked City: A Killer Christmas&quot; (1998)). He was also cast in a supporting role in &quot;Training Day&quot; (2001). Glenn was cast in the FX drama &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; (2008), as Clay Morrow, but he was replaced after an early pilot episode by Ron Perlman. He portrayed Eugene van Wingerdt in a leading role in the thriller film &quot;The Barber&quot;. Glenn acted in the 2011 film &quot;Sucker Punch&quot; as Wise Man.

Glenn appeared in the drama &quot;Freedom Writers&quot;, in which he played the father of Hilary Swank&#x27;s character, and in &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; and &quot;The Bourne Legacy&quot; as CIA Director Ezra Kramer.

He played the character Stick in Netflix&#x27;s television series &quot;Daredevil&quot; and returned to the character in &quot;The Defenders&quot; series a year later.

In 2020 he played the grandfather in &quot;Greenland,&quot; opposite Gerard Butler &amp; Morena Baccarin-- an apocalyptic thriller about a comet destroying most of Earth.

==Personal life==
He wed Carol Schwartz in 1968 and upon their marriage, Glenn converted to Judaism, his wife&#x27;s faith, from Catholicism. They have two daughters.

<doc id="1195313" wikidata="Q1932811" url="?curid=1195313" title="The ABBA Generation">
<text>The ABBA Generation is the debut studio album by Swedish pop group A-Teens. It was released on 25 August 1999 by Stockholm Records. The album is composed of cover versions of well-known ABBA songs. The album spawned four singles, &quot;Mamma Mia&quot;, &quot;Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)&quot;, &quot;Super Trouper&quot;, and &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;.

The album reached number one in Sweden and Argentina. In the United States, the album peaked at seventy-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Albums Chart and was certified Gold.

==Background==
In 1998, Marie, Sara, Dhani, and Amit came together to form the ABBA-Teens and began recording their debut album which would consist entirely of covers of ABBA songs. Their first single, &quot;Mamma Mia&quot;, was first released in April 1999 in their native Sweden where it stayed at number one for eight consecutive weeks. Following this release, the group&#x27;s name was changed to the A-Teens to avoid litigation. &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; was released internationally following their name change and topped the charts in over ten countries.

Further singles from the album were hits in Sweden: &quot;Super Trouper&quot; peaked at number two and &quot;Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight) peaked at number ten; both songs charted moderately worldwide. &quot;Happy New Year&quot; was released as a standalone single in Sweden at the end of 1999 and peaked at number four.

In March 2000, the group released the single &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;. The single reached ninety-five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and sold over 500,000 copies in the U.S. alone, being certified Gold. Coinciding with this release, the band embarked on a promotional tour of the United States and was an opening act for the Britney Spears tour later that summer.

==Critical reception==
Despite its commercial success around the world, the album received generally negative reviews from music critics. Alex Henderson of AllMusic said that the group&#x27;s &quot;versions of ABBA gems like &quot;Take a Chance on Me&quot;, &quot;Mamma Mia&quot;, &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;, and &quot;Voulez-Vous&quot; aren&#x27;t brilliant, but they&#x27;re enjoyable—and they show just how well the songs have held up over time.&quot; He concluded his review by saying, “All things considered, &quot;The ABBA Generation&quot; is a pleasing, if unremarkable, testament to the durability of ABBA&#x27;s songs.&quot; In an average review for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Steven Thompson wrote, &quot;Pop music doesn&#x27;t get more marginal than a collection of overdriven dance-pop covers, but &quot;The ABBA Generation&quot; succeeds on its own modest terms.&quot; 

David Hiltbrand of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a B+, saying that the group &quot;look and sound better than their supergroup heroes; even the music is spruced up, thanks to a cast of savvy Swedish producers.&quot; Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Arion Berger gave the album one and a half out of five stars, saying that &quot;all the keyboard doodling and note-for-note diligence in Scandinavia wouldn&#x27;t help these poseurs bring the pure-pop greatness of the real ABBA to life.&quot;

<text>VH2 was a sister channel to VH1 in the United Kingdom. It launched in 2003, and slowly became an Indie rock channel, aimed primarily at men in the 25-34 demographic. It mainly showed music videos, though it also aired documentaries about artists.

During its launch, the screen identity was created by Paul Wilkinson of Nuw Creative.

VH2 also had many chart shows, including the &quot;Indie 500&quot; weekend, which counted down the Top 500 Indie Songs with songs by artists such as The Stone Roses, Pixies, Oasis, Dinosaur Jr, The Cure, The Strokes, Blur and Radiohead. The winner of the Indie 500 was &quot;There Is a Light That Never Goes Out&quot; by The Smiths, whilst The Stone Roses&#x27; song &quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot; was second (though on a condensed version of the counting listing just the top 50, the two tracks had switched place, leading &quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot; to first place)

VH2 closed at 6 a.m. on 1 August 2006 and was replaced by MTV Flux. Its last days saw it unspool older MTV idents of the past.

<doc id="1195321" wikidata="Q6544983" url="?curid=1195321" title="Life Story (film)">
<text>Life Story (known as The Race for the Double Helix in the United States) is a 1987 television historical drama which depicts the progress toward, and the competition for, the discovery of the structure of DNA in the early 1950s. It was directed by Mick Jackson for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Horizon&quot; science series, and stars Jeff Goldblum, Tim Pigott-Smith, Juliet Stevenson, and Alan Howard. It won several awards in the UK and U.S., including the 1988 BAFTA TV Award for Best Single Drama.

==Summary==
The film dramatises the rivalries of the two teams of scientists attempting to discover the structure of DNA: Francis Crick and James D. Watson at Cambridge University; and Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin at King&#x27;s College London. They are also competing with other scientists in the UK, and with international scientists such as American Linus Pauling.

The film manages to convey the loneliness and competitiveness of scientific research but also educates the viewer about how DNA&#x27;s structure was discovered. It explores the tension between the patient, dedicated laboratory work of Franklin and the sometimes uninformed intuitive leaps of Watson and Crick, against a background of institutional turf wars, personality conflicts, and sexism.

The film also highlights many examples of social injustice such as exemplifying gender binary system that supports male norming. The film shows many instances in which they highlight that due to a male built society James Watson and Francis Crick were able to pull ahead in the discovery. 

In the film, Watson, extolling the path of intuition, says: &quot;Blessed are they who believed before there was any evidence.&quot; It also shows how Watson and Crick made their discovery, overtaking their competitors in part by reasoning from genetic function to predict chemical structure, helping to establish the field of molecular biology.

==Cast==
* Jeff Goldblum as James Watson
* Tim Pigott-Smith as Francis Crick
* Juliet Stevenson as Rosalind Franklin
* Alan Howard as Maurice Wilkins
* Nicholas Fry as Raymond Gosling
* John Moreno as Vittorio Luzzati
* Geoffrey Chater as Lawrence Bragg
* Lyndon Brook as Erwin Chargaff
* Betsy Brantley as Elizabeth Watson (James Watson&#x27;s sister)
* Anthony Benson as J. T. Randall

==Production==
The film script was written by William Nicholson, based on James Watson&#x27;s 1968 memoir &quot;The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA&quot;. It was produced and directed by Mick Jackson for &quot;Horizon&quot;, the long-running British documentary television series on BBC Two that covers science and philosophy. The film was produced by the BBC in association with the American A&amp;E network

Original music was composed for the film by Peter Howell of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. The main music theme is the &quot;Le Grand Choral&quot; by Georges Delerue, first used in the 1973 French film &quot;Day for Night&quot; directed by Truffaut.

Detailed 1950s-style molecular models were recreated for the film.

==Accuracy==
In his book &quot;What Mad Pursuit&quot;, Francis Crick wrote that there were a few inaccuracies, such as portraying Watson as too manic and as always chewing gum, but wrote that overall &quot;it tells a good story at a good pace so that people from all walks of life can enjoy it and absorb some of its lessons. All in all, &quot;Life Story&quot; must be considered a success. In other hands it could easily have been nothing quite as good.&quot;

==Video recordings==
The film has had a number of VHS and DVD releases, but most have been exclusively for institutional educational use and are held by the libraries of colleges and universities. A VHS in PAL format, with the title &quot;Life Story&quot;, was produced for the educational market. A shortened 90-minute VHS in NTSC format was produced in 1993 by EDDE Entertainment under the title &quot;The Race for the Double Helix&quot;. In the 2000s, Films for the Humanities &amp; Sciences produced a full-length DVD exclusively for the institutional and educational market, under the title &quot;Double Helix&quot;.

In December 2024, the film was made available on the BBC iPlayer

<text>Mornington Crescent is a terraced street in Camden Town, Camden, London, England. It was built in the 1820s, on a greenfield site just to the north of central London. Many of the houses were subdivided into flats during the Victorian era, and what was the street&#x27;s communal garden is now the Carreras Building. Mornington Crescent tube station which opened in 1907, takes its name from the street.

==History==
The crescent was named after the Earl of Mornington, brother of the Duke of Wellington. Comprising three curved terraces grouped in a crescent form around communal gardens, the north side of the crescent (numbers 37–46) was constructed first, dating from the 1820s or earlier. With 36 spacious houses suitable for professional people, the crescent was originally surrounded by green fields, enjoying views across open country to the front and rear, yet was conveniently close to &quot;town&quot;. It was at the southern end of the slightly older Arlington Street, now Arlington Road.

However, the building of the railway line into the Euston terminus, and encroachment from the nearby working class districts of Kings Cross and Camden Town led to a change in the demographics of the area during the Victorian era. More and more, the houses were subdivided into houses of multiple occupancy with flats housing artists and artisans.
The communal gardens of the crescent are occupied by a large Art Deco building, known as the Carreras Building. Originally built as a tobacco factory in 1926–28 by the Carreras Tobacco Company, it is a striking example of early 20th Century Egyptian Revival architecture and a distinctive local landmark, not least because of the large bronze statues of the Egyptian cat god Bastet which adorn the front. In the 1990s the building was restored and converted into an office building and renamed Greater London House.

==Cultural associations==
The crescent has a number of literary and artistic associations. The artist Frank Auerbach has a studio nearby and has often painted the crescent and surrounding area. The crescent was a popular subject of the Camden Town Group; the painter Walter Sickert lived there from 1905, at number 6, and Spencer Gore lived at number 31 from 1909 to 1912. Clarkson Stanfield (a painter friend of Charles Dickens) lived at number 36 from 1834 to 1841. The painter Harden Sidney Melville lived for a time at number 34. Dickens went to a school, Wellington House Academy, on Granby Terrace adjoining Mornington Crescent, after his spell working in a blacking warehouse.

<text>Erotic asphyxiation (variously called asphyxiophilia, hypoxyphilia or breath control play) is the intentional restriction of oxygen to the brain for the purposes of sexual arousal. With a partner (or alone), the act often involves strangulation. The term autoerotic asphyxiation is used when the act is done by a person to themself. Colloquially, a person engaging in the activity is sometimes called a &quot;gasper&quot;. Erotic asphyxiation can lead to accidental death due to asphyxia.

The erotic interest in asphyxiation is classified as a paraphilia in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&quot; of the American Psychiatric Association.

==Physiology==

Concerning hallucinogenic states brought about by chronic hypoxia, Dr. E. L. Lloyd notes that they may be similar to the hallucinations experienced by climbers at altitude. He further notes that no such state occurs in hypoxia brought about by sudden aircraft decompression at altitude. These findings suggest to him that they do not arrive purely from a lack of oxygen. Upon examining the studies on hypoxia he found that &quot;abnormalities in the cerebral neurochemistry involving one or more of the interconnected neurotransmitters, dopamine, serotonin, and beta-endorphin had been reported in all the conditions associated with hallucinations.&quot;

Practitioners describe a number of physiological responses including &quot;pleasurable sensations/euphoria (81.7%), a head rush (43.8%), feeling like they could not breathe (43.0%), difficulty swallowing (38.9%), unable to speak (37.6%), and watery eyes (37.2%). About 15% had noticed neck bruising and 3% had lost consciousness from being choked.&quot;

== History ==

Historically, the practice of autoerotic asphyxiation has been documented since the early 17th century. It was first used as a treatment for erectile dysfunction. The idea for this most likely came from subjects who were executed by hanging. Observers at public hangings noted that male victims developed an erection, sometimes remaining after death (a death erection), and occasionally ejaculated when being hanged.

==Practice==
Various methods are used to achieve the level of oxygen depletion needed, such as a hanging, suffocation with a plastic bag over the head, self-strangulation such as with a ligature, gas or volatile solvents, chest compression, or some combination of these. Complicated devices (such as hydraulics) are sometimes used to produce the desired effects. The practice can be dangerous even if performed with care and has resulted in a significant number of accidental deaths. Uva (1995) writes &quot;Estimates of the mortality rate of autoerotic asphyxia range from 250 to 1000 deaths per year in the United States.&quot; Cases have also been reported in Scandinavia and Germany. Swedish police reported in 1994 that the number of autoerotic asphyxiation fatalities in the Stockholm area (c. 1.7 million inhabitants) were at least five annually, but the number of unrecorded cases was assumed to be high. Autoerotic asphyxiation may often be mistaken for suicide, which is a major cause of death in teenagers.

In a 2021 survey of US students, women and transgender/nonbinary/gender nonconforming individuals are more likely to have been choked during sex than men.

== Accidental death (with autoerotic asphyxiation) ==

Deaths often occur when the loss of consciousness caused by partial asphyxia leads to loss of control over the means of strangulation, resulting in continued asphyxia and death. While often asphyxiophilia is incorporated into sex with a partner, others enjoy this behaviour by themselves, making it potentially more difficult to get out of dangerous situations.

In some fatality cases, the body of the asphyxiophilic individual is discovered naked or with genitalia in hand, with pornographic material or sex toys present, or with evidence of having orgasmed prior to death. Bodies found at the scene of an accidental death often show evidence of other paraphilic activities, such as fetishistic cross-dressing and masochism. In cases involving teenagers at home, families may disturb the scene by &quot;sanitizing&quot; it, removing evidence of paraphilic activity. This can have the consequence of making the death appear to be a deliberate suicide, rather than an accident.

The great majority of known erotic asphyxial deaths are male; among all known cases in Ontario and Alberta from 1974 to 1987, only 1 out of 117 cases was female. Some individual cases of women with erotic asphyxia have been reported. The main age of accidental death is mid-20s, but deaths have been reported in adolescents and in men in their 70s.

Lawyers and insurance companies have brought cases to the attention of clinicians because some life insurance claims are payable in the event of accidental death, but not suicide.

== In fiction ==

The sensational nature of erotic asphyxiation often makes it the subject of urban legends. It has also been mentioned specifically in a number of works of fiction.
* In the Marquis de Sade&#x27;s famous novel &quot;Justine, or The Misfortunes of the Virtue&quot;, Justine is subjected to this by one of her captors. She survives the encounter.
* In the Guts short story in Chuck Palahniuk&#x27;s novel &quot;Haunted&quot;, one the characters discusses parents who discover the accidental deaths of their sons to autoerotic asphyxiation. They are said to cover up the deaths before police or coroners arrive to save the family from shame.
* In the novel (and later movie adaptation) &quot;Rising Sun&quot;, death as a result of this type of sexual arousal is explained when it is offered as a possible cause for a murder victim&#x27;s death.
* In the film &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Dad&quot;, the protagonist&#x27;s teenage son accidentally kills himself with asphyxiation whilst sexually aroused. The protagonist then stages his son&#x27;s death as a suicide, which gives him the opportunity to rise to infamy through a literary hoax.
* In the film &quot;Ken Park&quot;, a character named Tate practices autoerotic asphyxia.

* Autoerotic asphyxiation occurs in the cold open of &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; episode &quot;Back to the Garden&quot;. 
* Kenny from &quot;South Park&quot; dies from suffocating while wearing a Elon Musk costume and practicing autoerotic asphyxia in the episode &quot;Sexual Healing&quot;. 
* In the season four episode of &quot;Californication&quot;, titled &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, the character Zig Semetauer is found dead in his bathroom by Hank, Charlie and Stu after suffocating due to autoerotic asphyxia, to which Hank quips &quot;I&#x27;m not averse to the occasional choke-n&#x27;-stroke, but this is a prime example of why one must always use a buddy system.&quot;
* A character in the film &quot;Knocked Up&quot; offers to be a &quot;spotter&quot; for a friend if he intends on performing autoerotic asphyxiation.

*reoccuring theme in the fiction to William S Burroughs especially Naked Lunch, where hanging is depicted in resulting in instant ejaculation.
* Bruce Robertson, the main character in the 1998 Irvine Welsh novel, &quot;Filth&quot;, engages in the practice. This is also depicted in the 2013 film adaptation.
*In the sixth episode, season two of &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;, autoerotic asphyxiation and celebrity deaths are recurrent discussions.
*In the episode, &quot;Clyde Bruckman&#x27;s Final Repose&quot; of the TV series &quot;The X-Files&quot;, a psychic implies that special agent Fox Mulder will die by autoerotic asphyxiation.
*In the third episode, season ten of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, titled &quot;Screams of Silence: The Story of Brenda Q&quot;, after failing to show up to a fishing trip, Joe and Peter find that Quagmire has fallen unconscious after autoerotically asphyxiating himself.
*In the Tim Winton book Breath and subsequent film, erotic and autoerotic asphyxiation occurs.
*In the novel The Northern Clemency, by Philip Hensher, a character dies from autoerotic asphyxiation.

<text>Howard Michael Johnson (born November 29, 1960), nicknamed &quot;HoJo&quot;, is an American former professional baseball third baseman, shortstop and outfielder. He played for the Detroit Tigers, New York Mets, Colorado Rockies, and Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1982 to 1995. He has also coached in MLB for the Mets and Seattle Mariners.

Johnson made his MLB debut with the Tigers in 1982 and was a part of the 1984 World Series champions. The Tigers traded Johnson to the Mets after the season and he won a second World Series title in 1986. Johnson was a two-time All-Star with the Mets, in 1989 and 1991, and led the National League in home runs and runs batted in in 1991. After playing for the Mets through the 1993 season, Johnson finished his career with the Rockies in 1994 and the Cubs in 1995.

Johnson is third on the Mets&#x27; all-time lists for home runs, runs batted in, doubles, and stolen bases. He was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Johnson was born on November 29, 1960, in Clearwater, Florida, to Bill and Sue Johnson. He was the oldest of three children. He was named for his grandfather, Raymond Howard Johnson. His family went to Howard Johnson&#x27;s every Sunday after church, where he was never charged for lunch.

Bill coached Howard in Little League Baseball and taught him to become a switch hitter when he was three or four years old.

Johnson attended Clearwater High School and played for the baseball team. He had a .375 batting average in his junior year, but it declined to .275 in his senior year. As a pitcher, Johnson had a 0.91 earned run average and 110 strikeouts in 91 innings pitched in his senior year. The New York Yankees selected Johnson in the 23rd round of the 1978 MLB draft, but they did not offer him a signing bonus and he instead attended St. Petersburg Junior College and played college baseball as a pitcher and a position player.

==Baseball career==

===1979–1983: Transition from minor leagues to major leagues===
The Detroit Tigers selected Johnson in the first round, with the 12th overall selection, of MLB&#x27;s secondary draft in January 1979. He signed with the Tigers, who converted him into an infielder. He played for the Lakeland Tigers of the Class A Florida State League in 1979 and 1980. The Tigers promoted him to the Birmingham Barons of the Class AA Southern League, where he hit 22 home runs.

Johnson began the 1982 season with the Evansville Triplets of the Class AAA American Association. He was promoted to the major leagues. Johnson finished the season with a .316 batting average in the major leagues. He began the 1983 season in the major leagues with the Tigers, but was demoted to Evansville in May. He returned to the Tigers later in the year.

===1984: Detroit Tigers and a first championship===
In 1984, Johnson was back with the Tigers and was made the left side of a platoon with Tom Brookens. Johnson started fairly well but had a poor second half. He finished the regular season with a .248 batting average, 12 home runs, and 50 runs batted in (RBIs) and in 355 at bats. The Tigers led the division for the entire season to reach the 1984 MLB postseason, but Johnson did not play in the 1984 American League Championship Series as manager Sparky Anderson preferred to use more experienced players. Brookens, Marty Castillo, and Darrell Evans split time at third. In the 1984 World Series, the Tigers used Johnson as a pinch hitter once; he reached base on an error by second baseman Alan Wiggins as the Tigers eased through the postseason en route to the world championship.

===1985–1986: New York Mets and a second championship===

The Tigers traded Johnson to the New York Mets for Walt Terrell at the Winter Meetings on December 7, 1984. Three days later, the Mets traded third baseman Hubie Brooks to the Montreal Expos as part of a trade for catcher Gary Carter.

Johnson&#x27;s inability to hit well from the right side resulted in him being platooned by the Mets in 1985, this time with Ray Knight. Both started terribly and neither reached .200 until early July. Johnson hit below average all season, while Knight was even worse. The Mets, as they had in 1984, narrowly missed the postseason in 1985.

1986 was the year of the Mets and both Johnson and Knight started very well. The Mets&#x27; problems shifted from third base to shortstop as Rafael Santana struggled to keep his average above .150 most of the season. Johnson was a capable shortstop defensively and picked up extra playing time moving between short and third but his hitting started declining in May. Between his mediocre hitting, continued lack of power, and an injury that wiped out three weeks in June, Johnson played in only 88 games in the regular season. When he returned from the June injury, Johnson went on a home run tear including two in his first game back and, within six weeks, his slugging percentage jumped from .376 to .510. One of Johnson&#x27;s home runs occurred in a legendary game on July 22, 1986, against the Cincinnati Reds. When a 10th-inning bench-clearing fight ended, three Mets players were out of the game and they were forced to spend the rest of the game with a pitcher in the outfield and two pitchers in the batting lineup. When one of the pitchers, Jesse Orosco, drew a walk in the 14th inning, Johnson followed with a three-run home run that led to a Mets win. Johnson faded down the stretch and was virtually shut out of the postseason, going 0-for-7 in four games. His only start was Game 2 of the 1986 World Series, when he went 0-for-4 in a crucial Mets loss that put them in an 0–2 hole. His only other at bat in the series was in Game 6, when he struck out in the ninth inning. Nevertheless, at age 25, Johnson already had his second World Series ring.

===1987: Breakout season===
Knight became a free agent after the 1986 World Series and left the Mets. Johnson, given sole ownership of the third base position, began a three-month power surge in mid-May. In 10 games, he hit five home runs, including a pair of three-run shots, with 13 RBIs. In an 11-game span a month later, he hit another six home runs with 10 RBIs. In seven games around the all-star break, he hit another six home runs and seven RBIs, raising his slugging percentage over .520. With his 22nd home run of the season in mid-July, the previously light-hitting Johnson took over the team home run lead from Darryl Strawberry while hitting from the seventh spot in the batting order. He ended July with six RBIs in seven games along with a four-hit game, and then started August with a grand slam. In a 13-game span in late July and early August, he had at least one RBI in all but one game and amassed 17 RBIs overall. Three games in mid-August brought another three home runs and seven RBIs. Johnson was accused of using a corked bat in July by Astros manager Hal Lanier and in August by Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog. Six of his bats were confiscated by umpires and X-rayed; all were found to be legal.

Johnson&#x27;s power surge was complemented by a surge in speed. Although he had 31 stolen bases in five previous seasons, on September 11, 1987, Johnson stole his 30th base to join the 30–30 club for the first time. Johnson became the first switch-hitter to join the club, and he and Strawberry became the only teammates to achieve 30–30 status in the same season. Another grand slam in September brought Johnson&#x27;s home run total to 36, just four shy of his entire career before 1987. Unfortunately for the Mets, as Johnson&#x27;s power faded, so did their run at the postseason and the defending champions missed the playoffs. The entire league took notice of Johnson&#x27;s unexpected rise in 1987 and he received 42 points in the voting for National League MVP. His home run and RBI totals were second only to Strawberry on the team and his home runs were seventh-best in the entire majors. His right-handed hitting was substantially better than his left-handed hitting with numbers better in almost every category including a batting average 36 points higher and slugging 74 points higher. His 36 home runs overall were the most in National League history by a switch-hitter, breaking Ripper Collins&#x27; 53-year-old record.

In 1988, Johnson received a raise from $297,500 to $695,000. He reverted to hitting much better from the left side with a .183 average and .338 slugging from the right side. A mid-season injury to his right shoulder contributed to his poor offense. One bright spot was September 8, 1988, when he had the only five-hit game of his career, going 5-for-5 with a three-run home run and four RBIs in a Wrigley Field victory. While Johnson was struggling to stay above .230, the Mets tried out 21-year-old third-base prospect, Gregg Jefferies, who blazed through September. After 13 games, Jefferies, who was also a switch hitter, had a batting average of .462 and a fantastic slugging percentage of .962 with five home runs, a four-hit game and four three-hit games. Despite Johnson&#x27;s mediocre season, the Mets easily coasted to a division win but Johnson went 1-for-18 with six strikeouts in the 1988 NLCS. With the heavily favored Mets down 3–2 in the series, he was benched for Games 6 and 7 in favor of Jefferies. Johnson pinch-hit in Game 7 and struck out for the final out of the Mets disappointing season.

===1988–1989: Trade rumors===
With Johnson and Jefferies competing for the third base job, the 1988–89 off-season was filled with trade rumors. The logjam was cleared when second baseman Wally Backman was traded to the Minnesota Twins making Jefferies the Mets&#x27; regular second baseman in 1989. Johnson was moved from sixth or seventh in the lineup to third, in front of star slugger Darryl Strawberry, who had led the N.L. in home runs and slugging in 1988. Johnson batted .340 with 11 home runs in June, earning him his first National League Player of the Month Award. On July 9, the Mets announced that they signed Johnson to a three-year contract extension worth $6.1 million, making him their second-highest paid player behind Dwight Gooden.

Mike Schmidt was elected to start at third base for the N.L. but he retired six weeks before the game. As a result, Johnson was chosen to start for his first All-Star Game. In his first All-Star at bat, he drove in the second run of the game in which the N.L. lost 5–3. Johnson played well in the second half but an overall team slowdown knocked the Mets out of the playoffs. With his 30th home run on August 20, 1989, Johnson joined Bobby Bonds and Willie Mays as the only multi-year members of the 30–30 club. The only other infielders in major league history who had had multiple 30–30 seasons as of 2011 were Ian Kinsler, Alfonso Soriano, and Jeff Bagwell. Johnson ended the 1989 season with 36 home runs, tying his career-high and his own N.L. record for switch hitters. He also broke the 100-RBI mark for the first time, finishing with 101. Only Kevin Mitchell&#x27;s career year stopped Johnson from winning both the home run and slugging titles in the N.L. like his teammate Strawberry had done in 1987. Johnson also stole 41 bases, a career high, and scored 104 runs which tied for first in the N.L. He received 153 points in voting for N.L. MVP, finishing fifth. Both his on-base percentage and slugging from 1989 were career highs.

In 1990, Johnson stole 34 bases and, for the third time, he played in over 150 games. Despite finishing with only a .244 average and .434 slugging percentage, Johnson still racked up 90 RBIs and 37 doubles. He spent the last two months of the season as Kevin Elster&#x27;s replacement at shortstop. The Mets started the season so poorly that manager Davey Johnson was fired in May but, under new manager Bud Harrelson, they recovered to win 91 games. They even took over first place in early September, but still missed the playoffs. Johnson&#x27;s best game was his first ever five-RBI game, including a grand slam, at Wrigley Field on June 13, 1990. The quality of his season again mirrored the quality of his right-handed hitting, as he batted only .208 from his weaker side.

===1990–1991: Leading the National League===
Johnson&#x27;s fall-off in 1990 led to more trade rumors. Instead, the Mets&#x27; troubled all-time home run and RBIs leader, Darryl Strawberry, left New York when he was signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers in December 1990. Johnson became the leader of the offense for the Mets and, in response, became arguably the best offensive player in the National League in 1991, winning two-thirds of the coveted Triple Crown. Johnson started slowly in April and caught fire in early May. The RBIs came in waves all season as he hit a right-handed grand slam on June 18, 1991 and had 26 RBIs in 22 games before the All-Star break. With 63 RBI, Johnson was selected as a reserve to his second and last All-Star Game. He finished out July well and had a slow August before a fantastic September in which he hit ten home runs with 28 RBIs while slugging nearly .700, earning him his second National League Player of the Month award. Johnson was the last Met to win the award until David Wright in June 2006.

At season&#x27;s end, Johnson had won both the National League home run title and RBI title. The 38 home runs broke his own record for N.L. switch hitters and 117 RBIs set the Met record for most runs batted in during a season until 1999. Both were also career bests for Johnson. On October 1, 1991, he stole his 30th base becoming only the second player, after Bobby Bonds, to join the 30–30 club in three different seasons. In June 1991, he passed Dave Kingman into second place on the Mets&#x27; all-time home run list. Johnson received 112 votes for National League MVP, finishing fifth. He likely would have received more MVP consideration except that the Mets had fallen all the way to a 77–84 record, second-to-last in the division. Despite his heroics, the Mets scored the fifth fewest runs per game in the majors. Johnson&#x27;s had become a one-man show—his 38 home runs were more than the next &quot;two&quot; highest totals on the team combined and his RBI total was tops on the team by more than 40. His biggest liability was defense as he accumulated a career-worst 31 errors. In September, with Johnson leading the league with 29 errors, the Mets played Johnson as a right fielder for most of the rest of the year.

===1992–1995: Later years and retirement===
Going into the 1992 season, Johnson was surrounded by high-priced veterans like Eddie Murray, Bobby Bonilla, Vince Coleman, and Bret Saberhagen. While he was a spotty right-handed hitter his whole career, in 1992, he stopped hitting from either side of the plate. He hit three home runs in April and followed up with an even worse May. After three months, he had only seven home runs and was batting .223 with a slugging percentage well under .400. A home run in late June turned out to be his last of the season. He went homerless for another month before fracturing his wrist in late July. He played a few more games in agony before the fracture was diagnosed and his season ended in early August. Johnson made over $2 million while his slugging percentage dropped nearly 200 points from 1991. The Mets had the third-highest payroll in the majors and finished 72–90, two games out of last place in the division. He hit his 183rd National League home run that year, breaking Ted Simmons&#x27; league career record for home runs by a switch hitter.

In 1993, a year that found the Mets with 103 losses and the worst record in the majors, Johnson&#x27;s batting average did not reach .200 until almost May and his slugging only rose above .400 for barely a week before diving back down. He missed three weeks in June and his season again ended prematurely in late July. At the end of the campaign, Johnson was granted free agency.

Johnson signed with the Colorado Rockies in 1994. Despite the hitter-friendly atmosphere of Mile High Stadium, he wound up hitting more home runs on the road finishing with only ten overall. In the crowded left field position, he split time with Mike Kingery and Eric Young but was mostly pinch hitting by August when the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike ended the season. He batted .211 with 10 home runs and the Rockies declined his $2.95 million option for the 1995 season, paying him a $400,000 buyout and making him a free agent.

Shortly after the strike ended in April 1995, Johnson signed with the Chicago Cubs. He saw limited playing time and his average was at .115 in mid-August, lower than many of the team&#x27;s pitchers. All of his production was at Wrigley Field, as his average on the road was under .100 with only two extra-base hits. A spurt in September raised his overall average to .195 but was not enough to garner a new contract from the Cubs. When he found no team interested, Johnson retired at age 35.

===1996–present: Post-retirement / comeback attempts / coaching career===
After retiring, Johnson expressed an interest in coaching. In mid-1996, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays named Johnson to the coaching staff of their rookie-level minor league team, the Butte Copper Kings.

In February 1997, Johnson attempted a comeback with the Mets as a non-roster player. The Mets cut Johnson after he batted .129 during spring training and he announced his retirement. Later in the year, he signed on as a scout with the Mets.

Johnson was named the batting coach of the Mets&#x27; Brooklyn Cyclones minor league team for 2001. He was made the manager for 2002 after Brooklyn was named co-champion of the New York–Penn League (the championship was cancelled due to the September 11, 2001 attacks). In 2003, Johnson was the hitting coach under manager, Ken Oberkfell, when the St. Lucie Mets won the Florida State League championship. Johnson and Oberkfell were promoted to the AA Binghamton Mets for 2004 and guided them into the Eastern League playoffs. Both were promoted again to the AAA Norfolk Tides for 2005 and the Tides posted their highest batting average in six seasons. He served as the Tides&#x27; hitting coach again in 2006 under Oberkfell.

In 2007, Johnson became the first base coach for the Mets, In July, he was named the hitting coach after Rick Down was fired. In 2011, he was replaced by Dave Hudgens.

In 2011, at age 50, Johnson played in two minor league games with his son Glen for the Rockland Boulders of the Can-Am League, an independent baseball league.

Johnson was named hitting coach for AAA Tacoma Rainiers of the Seattle Mariners organization for the 2013 baseball season. Johnson joined the Mariners as a hitting coach for the 2014 season, as part of the new coaching staff. He was replaced by Edgar Martínez on June 20, 2015.

Johnson managed the single-A Down East Wood Ducks in 2017, and was hitting instructor for the AAA Round Rock Express in 2018. In 2019, he was the hitting coach for the AAA Nashville Sounds.

In 2020, Johnson joined the Toros de Tijuana of the Mexican League as their hitting coach.

<text>Canter&#x27;s Deli is a Jewish-style delicatessen, opened in 1931 in Boyle Heights, and later moved to the Fairfax District of Los Angeles, California, near the border of West Hollywood. It has been frequented by many movie stars and celebrities.

The restaurant serves traditional food items, including: lox and bagels, corned beef, matzoh ball soup, and challah bread. However, it is not certified kosher, being open on Saturdays and offering many non-kosher menu items like ham sandwiches.
Canter&#x27;s has remained open 24 hours most days, except on the Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. However, its dining room is only open until 11:30 PM.

In 2021, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; ranked it as one of the &quot;50 greatest food stores in the world.&quot;

== History ==
The Canter family originally opened a delicatessen in Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1924. They came west along with many Jews from the northeastern United States,
and in 1931 they opened a delicatessen on Brooklyn Avenue in the Boyle Heights neighborhood, which at that time had a substantial Jewish population. After World War II, the Jewish population of Boyle Heights left en masse for the Fairfax District, West Hollywood, and other West Side neighborhoods (as well as the San Fernando Valley) and Canter&#x27;s followed the influx of Jewish businesses west. A location at 439 North Fairfax Avenue opened in 1948; in 1953, the restaurant moved up the block into the former Esquire Theater (which had previously shown Yiddish-language films), resulting in a delicatessen much larger than its previous spaces. The restaurant was further expanded in 1959, and the Kibitz Room cocktail lounge opened in 1961. The Boyle Heights location remained in business until the 1970s.

Canter&#x27;s quickly became a hang-out for show business personalities, given its location a block north of Television City and its 24/7 hours. It has remained such ever since. In the 1960s, Canter&#x27;s became a late night hang-out for hippies,
rock musicians, and other countercultural types, partially for the same reasons. Also, many rock musicians had grown up in Fairfax and West Hollywood, and the Sunset Strip was only a half-mile (0.8 km) away. Canter&#x27;s has remained a favorite of rock musicians to the present day, and its bakery and deli counter are still open 24 hours. Canter&#x27;s is open every day except for the Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.

Canter&#x27;s is known for its traditional deli favorites, such as pastrami, corned beef, matzah ball soup, challah, lox and bagels, and brisket. It also has a large menu of other breakfast, lunch, and dinner options and has been awarded for its food many times over the years. For example, Los Angeles Magazine named Canter&#x27;s waffles the Best Waffle in Los Angeles. Esquire magazine called their Monte Cristo sandwich one of the best sandwiches in America.

The bar in Canter&#x27;s, called the Kibitz Room, has its own history and has been a favorite of music personalities. Chuck E. Weiss. a regular at Canter&#x27;s who has his name on a plaque at the booth where he would sit, wrote a song about the Kibitz Room called, &quot;Rocking in the Kibitz Room.&quot;
Although the restaurant is open 24 hours, the Kibitz Room closes at 2 am. They have live music every night, and were the launch pad for several bands, most notably the Wallflowers, Fiona Apple, and Rick Rubin&#x27;s new project, the Vacation. The Big Jam has had plenty of &quot;A List&quot; musicians sit in, including Phil Everly, Jackson Browne, Melissa Etheridge, and Marc Canter&#x27;s high school friend Slash. Marc Canter, currently the restaurant&#x27;s co-owner, published a book in 2007 about the early days of Guns N&#x27; Roses. In 2019, Gina Canter and Alex Canter released a book titled &quot;Stories on Rye&quot;, cataloging a collection of memories shared at Canter&#x27;s.

The restaurant has been featured in several movies and television shows, including HBO&#x27;s &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; in the episode &quot;The Blind Date&quot; (2004) and AMC&#x27;s &quot;Mad Men&quot; in the episode &quot;Time Zones&quot; (2014). In 2007, Adam Stein, finalist on the FOX TV show &quot;On the Lot&quot;, filmed &quot;Dough: The Musical&quot; at Canter&#x27;s. Canter&#x27;s is also mentioned in the song, &quot;Oh Daddy,&quot; by The Turtles.

In 1993, the restaurant was featured in &quot;Visiting... with Huell Howser&quot; Episode 125.

In 2003, Canter&#x27;s opened an additional location inside Treasure Island Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. It closed in December 2012.
On 14 October 2008, Canter&#x27;s celebrated their 60th anniversary on Fairfax. To mark the occasion, the deli reduced the price of their corned beef sandwich to its 1948 price of 60 cents, limited to one per customer, for a period of 12 hours.

In 2008, Canter&#x27;s had opened another deli outlet at Dodger Stadium. The operation at the baseball park closed in 2011 and was replaced by Dodgertown Deli.

On July 24, 2014, President Barack Obama surprised the lunchtime diners and staff when he visited Canter&#x27;s.
On August 7, 2017, Canter&#x27;s Restaurant was ordered closed for three days by the Los Angeles County Health Department for eleven health code violations, including a vermin infestation. Among other things, inspectors observed more than 10 cockroaches and 20 rodent droppings in the restaurant storage area, and 20 flies in the food preparation area. The additional health code violations cited that food contact surfaces were not clean and sanitized and the food was not in a safe, healthy condition.

After returning to the Las Vegas market in September 2017, the Canter&#x27;s Tivoli Village location closed in July 2018. Opening in October 2017, the second Las Vegas location at the Linq Promenade closed in March, 2019.

On May 30, 2020, at the start of the George Floyd Protests, Canter&#x27;s neighborhood was the site of one of the first intense confrontations between protestors and police in Los Angeles. Canter&#x27;s posted messages in support of Black Lives Matter and stayed open during the protests, giving out food and water to demonstrators.

On November 1, 2023, antisemitic graffiti was painted in the Canter&#x27;s parking lot below a mural of photographs that document the history of the Jewish community in Los Angeles.

<text>Cleon Joseph Jones (born June 24, 1942) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a left fielder. Jones played most of his career for the New York Mets and in 1969 caught the final out of the &quot;Miracle Mets&quot; World Series Championship over the Baltimore Orioles.

==Baseball career==
===Minor leagues===
Jones played football and baseball at Mobile County Training School in Mobile, Alabama, and Alabama A&amp;M University. With the Bulldogs, Jones scored 26 touchdowns in nine games. He also played baseball for the Grambling State Tigers of Grambling State University.

Jones signed with the New York Mets as an amateur free agent in 1962. After batting over .300 for both the Carolina League Raleigh Mets and New York–Penn League Auburn Mets in 1963, Jones received a September call-up to the major league club without having played double or triple A ball. He got two hits in 15 at-bats for a .133 batting average during his stint with the New York Mets.

After spending all of 1964 with the triple A Buffalo Bisons, Jones made the Mets out of Spring training and was in the 1965 season opener against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Jones was demoted to Buffalo on May 2 with a .156 batting average. He again received a call up to New York that September, and hit his first major league home run on September 22 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He finished the season with a .149 batting average.

===New York Mets===
Jones was awarded the starting center fielder job in 1966, and batted .275 with eight home runs, 57 runs batted in (RBIs) and 16 stolen bases to finish tied for fourth in National League Rookie of the Year balloting. His batting average dipped to .246 in 1967, and he ended up sharing playing time in center field with Larry Stahl. Following the season, the Mets acquired Jones&#x27; childhood friend Tommie Agee from the Chicago White Sox. Jones was moved to left field with the former Gold Glove-winner Agee playing center field.

Jones began the 1968 season platooning with Art Shamsky in left. He was batting .205 on May 18, when he went three for four with a home run, two RBIs and two runs scored to lift the Mets to a 5–2 victory over the Atlanta Braves. From there, Jones began to hit; perhaps the finest game of his career occurred on July 16 at Connie Mack Stadium in Philadelphia, when Jones went four for six with three RBIs and a run scored, and played all three outfield positions. He ended the season with a .297 batting average, which was sixth best in the National League.

===Amazin&#x27; Mets===
Jones was batting .341 with ten home runs and 56 RBIs in the first half of 1969 earning the starting left field job for the All-Star Game. He went two for four with two runs scored in the NL&#x27;s 9–3 victory. He hit a home run in the first game after the break, and emerged as the hitting star of the surprising Mets, with a team-leading batting average of .340. The Amazins found themselves in second place, five games back of the Chicago Cubs in the newly aligned National League East when the Houston Astros came to Shea Stadium for a July 30 double header.

===July 30, 1969===
After losing the first game 16–3, the Mets were down 7–0 in the third inning of the second game when Johnny Edwards hit a double to Jones in left field to make the score 8–0. Mets manager Gil Hodges emerged from the dugout, walked past Nolan Ryan on the mound, and walked all the way out to left field. A few minutes later, Hodges walked back to the dugout, with Jones a few paces behind him, and replaced Jones in left with Ron Swoboda. Newspapers at the time said Jones suffered a leg injury and he was not in the Mets lineup for several games after July 30. Other reporters opined that Jones was removed for failure to hustle, and still others suggested the effect of Hodges’s decision sent a message to the whole team: that he would not tolerate a lack of effort on his team, not even from its star player.

On August 22, 2009, following pre-game ceremonies honoring the 40th anniversary of the &quot;Miracle Mets&quot;, Jones discussed the incident during SportsNet New York&#x27;s telecast of that night&#x27;s game. Jones said Hodges asked him why he did not look good going after a fly ball on the previous play. According to Jones, he pointed down to the water-filled turf. Jones said he reminded Hodges of his leg injury, and that the conditions on the field made it difficult for him to play his best. Jones said Hodges agreed, that he shouldn’t be playing, and they walked off the field together. Jones explained that Hodges was his favorite manager, and that he would never publicly embarrass a player. According to Jones, neither party ever revealed the contents of the conversation. Jones believes that the fear instilled in other players by the incident was the turning point in the season.

===World Series champions===
The Mets won 38 of their last 50 games, and finished the 1969 season with 100 wins —- eight games better than the second place Cubs.

Jones ended the season with a .340 batting average, which was third in the league behind Pete Rose and Roberto Clemente, and was second on the team in home runs, RBIs and runs scored, behind Tommie Agee in all three categories.

Jones batted a stellar .429 in the Mets&#x27; three game sweep of the Atlanta Braves in the 1969 National League Championship Series. In game two of the series, Jones went three for five with a home run, two runs scored and three RBIs in the Mets&#x27; 11–6 victory.

The Mets were heavy underdogs in the 1969 World Series but took a 3–1 series lead. The Orioles were ahead 3–0 in game five when Jones led off the sixth inning. Dave McNally struck Jones in the foot with a pitch, however, home plate umpire Lou DiMuro ruled that the ball missed Jones. Gil Hodges emerged from the dugout to argue, and showed DiMuro the shoe-polish smudged ball. DiMuro reversed his call, and awarded Jones first base. The following batter, Donn Clendenon, hit a two-run home run to pull the Mets within a run of Baltimore.

Following an Al Weis solo home run in the seventh to tie the game, Jones led off the eighth inning with a double off the wall that missed being a home run by about , and scored on Ron Swoboda&#x27;s double two batters later. With the Mets leading 5–3 in the ninth inning, Orioles second baseman Davey Johnson hit a 2-1 fastball which Jones caught near the warning track to win the World Series.

===1973 World Series===

Early in the 1970 season, Jones suffered through the worst slump in his career that saw his batting average reach .167 on May 26. His average improved to .251 by the time he began a then-club record 23-game hitting streak on August 25. For the season, he wound up hitting .277. In 1971, Jones was again a .300 hitter, as he was seventh in the league with a .319 batting average.

In 1972, Jones platooned with John Milner in left field. He played twenty games at first base, but not very well, and endured one of his worst seasons. The following season, Milner was shifted to first with Jones once again in left field.

In the 1973 season opener, Jones had his first career two home run game against the Philadelphia Phillies. He had his second on September 19, against the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first game of a crucial three game series at Shea for first place. The following day, Jones started one of the most memorable plays in Mets history, what has become known as the &quot;Ball on the Wall Play&quot;. In the top of the 13th inning, with Richie Zisk on first, Dave Augustine hit what appeared to be a home run over the left field wall. Jones turned to play the ball off the wall and the ball hit the top of the wall and went right into Jones&#x27; glove on the fly. He turned and threw to relay man Wayne Garrett, who threw home to catcher Ron Hodges to nail Zisk at the plate. Following this miracle play, the Mets won the game in the bottom half of the inning to move within half a game of the first place Pirates. Jones caught fire at the end of the season, hitting six homers in the last ten games of the season to lead the Mets to the pennant. The Mets won the Eastern Division title on the last day of the season with a record of 82-79 but went on to demonstrate that it was no fluke when they upset the &quot;Big Red Machine&quot; in the National League Championship Series. Jones went three for five with two RBIs and a run scored in the series clincher.

The Mets lost in seven games to the Oakland Athletics in the 1973 World Series. For his part, Jones batted .286 with a home run in Game 2, and scored one of the four runs the Mets scored in the 12th inning of their Game 2 victory.

===Incident in 1975===
Jones suffered a knee injury, and was out on extended spring training when the 1975 season started. At 5:00 a.m. on May 4, Jones was arrested and charged with indecent exposure in St. Petersburg, Florida. Police officers found him asleep in a station wagon with 21-year-old Sharon Ann Sabol, who was charged with possession of marijuana. Jones said he did not know Sabol, but was giving her a ride home in a friend&#x27;s borrowed station wagon, which ran out of gas, and that he had fallen asleep fully clothed, except for his shoes, waiting for help. The charges were later dropped, but chairman of the New York Mets M. Donald Grant fined Jones $2,000, four times as much as a Met had ever been assessed before, and forced him to publicly apologize during a press conference held in New York. Jones apologized with his wife Angela, his high school sweetheart, by his side. He and Angela have been married for more than 50 years.

==Retirement==
Jones rejoined the Mets on May 27. He was batting .240, mostly as a pinch hitter, when he was released by the Mets on July 18 after an altercation with manager Yogi Berra. He was acquired by the Chicago White Sox in 1976. He was released 13 games into the season with a .200 batting average, and retired afterwards.

Jones earned a reputation as an outfielder with one of the strongest arms in the National League. For his career, he had 64 outfield assists, including ten in 1966 and 1970.

In 1981, Jones was hired by Frank Cashen of the New York Mets to play a key role as a minor-league hitting coach. Jones helped shape the careers of future Met stars, including Kevin Mitchell, who figured prominently in the 1986 World Series Championship.

==Honors==

Jones was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1991. His .340 average in 1969 remained a team record until John Olerud batted .354 in 1998. Jones remains among the team&#x27;s all-time leaders in games played, at bats, and hits.

Jones is a member of the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame, and a member of the Mobile Sports Hall of Fame.

In June 2012, Jones was selected as the Mets&#x27; &quot;All-Time Leftfielder&quot; by a panel of sports writers and broadcasters, an honor which he said &quot;means a lot to me.&quot;

On November 14, 2021, Jones was inducted into the New York State Baseball Hall of Fame during a ceremonial dinner in Troy, New York. His wife of 57 years, Angela, was by his side.

==After baseball==
He appeared as himself in a 1999 episode of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; along with several other members of the 1969 Mets. The hip-hop duo The High &amp; Mighty mention Jones in their song entitled &quot;B-Boy Document &#x27;99.&quot;

&quot;Men in Black 3&quot; features a scene that re-enacts a few moments of the 1969 World Series, which mentions Jones, and depicts his catching of the fly ball off the bat of Davey Johnson that ended the Fall Classic.

Jones resides in his native Mobile where he and his wife, Angela, refurbish homes of senior residents of the Africatown section of Mobile.

Jones&#x27; autobiography &quot;Coming Home: My Amazin&#x27; Life with the New York Mets&quot; was published in August 2022.

<text>MBASIC is the [[MBASIC|M]]icrosoft [[MBASIC|BASIC]] implementation of BASIC for the CP/M operating system. MBASIC is a descendant of the original Altair BASIC interpreters that were among Microsoft&#x27;s first products. MBASIC was one of the two versions of BASIC bundled with the Osborne 1 computer. The name &quot;MBASIC&quot; is derived from the disk file name MBASIC.COM of the BASIC interpreter. MBASIC, like its predecessor family of 8-bit interpreters Microsoft BASIC, were heavily inspired by Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10&#x27;s BASIC-PLUS.

== Environment ==

MBASIC version 5 required a CP/M system with at least 28 KB of random-access memory (RAM) and at least one diskette drive.

Unlike versions of Microsoft BASIC-80 that were customized by home computer manufacturers to use the particular hardware features of the computer, MBASIC relied only on the CP/M operating system calls for all input and output. Only the CP/M console (screen and keyboard), line printer, and disk devices were available.

MBASIC in the uncustomized form had no functions for graphics, color, joysticks, mice, serial communications, networking, sound, or even a real-time clock function. MBASIC did not fully support the features of the host CP/M operating system, for example, it did not support CP/M&#x27;s user areas for organizing files on a diskette. Since CP/M systems were typically single-user and stand alone, there was no provision for file or record locking, or any form of multitasking. Apart from these limitations, MBASIC was considered at the time to be a powerful and useful implementation of BASIC.

== Features ==

=== Language system ===
MBASIC is an interpreter. Program source text was stored in memory in tokenized form, with BASIC keywords replaced by one-byte tokens which saved memory space and speeded execution. Any line prefixed with a line number was stored as program text; BASIC statements not prefixed with a line number were executed immediately as commands. Programs could be listed on the screen for editing, or saved to disk in either a compressed binary format or as plain ASCII text. Every source line was identified with a number, which could be used as the target of a GOTO or GOSUB transfer. Only line editing commands were provided. It was often beneficial to save a program as plain text and edit it with a full featured editor.

Program text, variables, disk buffers and the CP/M operating system itself all had to share the 64 kilobyte address space of the 8080 processor. Typically when first starting MBASIC there would be less than 32 kB memory available for programs and data, even on a machine equipped with a full 64 kilobytes of RAM. Comment lines, prefixed with the codice_1 keyword or an apostrophe, could be placed in the program text but took up valuable memory space, which discouraged BASIC users from fully documenting their code. To allow larger and more complex programs to be run, later versions of MBASIC supported functions that allowed portions of program text to be read in and executed under program control (the &quot;codice_2&quot; and codice_3 statements). No support for &quot;shell&quot; command execution was provided, though this functionality could be duplicated by a determined programmer.

A particular advantage of MBASIC was the full-text error messages provided for syntax and run-time errors. MBASIC also had a &quot;trace&quot; function that displayed line numbers as they were executed. While this occupied the same screen space as normal program output, it was useful for detecting conditions such as endless loops.

=== Files and input/output ===
Data could be read and stored to disk as either sequential files (delimited by the CP/M convention of CR/LF at the end of each line) or else as fixed-record-length random access files, which, given a sufficiently determined programmer, could be used to perform database-type record manipulation. The Microsoft Binary Format for floating point numbers was proprietary to the implementation, which meant that data could only be interchanged with other programs using ASCII text representation or else with extensive programming to convert the binary format.

=== Variables and data types ===
MBASIC supported the following data types:
* 8-bit character data, in strings of length 0 to 255 characters;
* 16-bit integers;
* 32-bit floating point (single precision), equivalent to six decimal digits, with a two-digit exponent;
* 64-bit floating point (double precision), equivalent to sixteen decimal digits, with a two-digit exponent.

String operators included substring selection, concatenation, assignment, and testing for equality.

Arrays of the above types were allowed with up to 7 dimensions, but no functions or operators worked on arrays; for example, there was no assignment of arrays. Unlike some other BASIC implementations of the time, MBASIC did not provide support for matrix operations, complex numbers, or a decimal (BCD) data type for financial calculations. All floating point operations were carried out in software since typical CP/M systems did not have floating point hardware. The built-in mathematics functions (sine, cosine, tangent, natural log, exponential, square root) only gave single precision results. A software pseudorandom number generator was provided; this relied on the user to key in a seed number to obtain a sequence of numbers useful for games and some simulations. MBASIC permitted but did not require the codice_4 keyword for assignment statements.

Early versions of BASIC on microcomputers were infamous for one- or two-character variable names, which made the meanings of variables difficult to recall in complex programs. MBASIC version 5 allowed identifiers up to 40 characters long, which permitted programmers to give variables readable names.

=== Program flow control ===
Program flow control in MBASIC was controlled by codice_5 conditional tests, codice_6 loops, and codice_7 and codice_8 instructions. No codice_9 statement was available, although an codice_10(computed GOTO) provided multi-way branches. Subroutines had no parameters and all variables were global. MBASIC did not make structured programming mandatory for programmers and it was easy to write spaghetti code.

== PEEKs, POKEs, and user functions ==
No discussion of BASICs on the 8-bit computers of the late &#x27;70s and early &#x27;80s would be complete without mentioning the importance of the PEEK and POKE functions for directly reading and writing to memory. Since these systems typically had no memory protection, this allowed a programmer to access portions of the operating system, or functions that would not otherwise be available. This also provided opportunities for user programs to hang the system (by accident, usually). For example, a CP/M programmer might use a codice_11 function to allow BASIC to switch the console device to the serial port, if the system BIOS supported this. For machines with real-time clocks, a set of codice_12 instructions might have been used to access the time.

For more complex operations, MBASIC allowed user-defined functions that could be called from a BASIC program. These were typically placed in a reserved area of memory, or POKEd into string constants, as a series of machine codes (opcodes). MBASIC also provided hardware codice_13 and codice_14 instructions that read and wrote directly to the 8080 hardware input/output ports. This could be used to control peripheral devices from a BASIC program if the system hardware permitted. 

Any MBASIC programs that made use of codice_12 and codice_16, and of machine code user functions, were not portable between machines without modifications.

== Successors to MBASIC ==
Besides Microsoft&#x27;s BASIC-80 for CP/M, a variant of MBASIC was also available as for the ISIS-II operating system.

MSX-BASIC is also a well known successor of MBASIC, featuring several extensions specific to the MSX machines.

All the functions of CP/M MBASIC were available in the IBM PC disk-based BASICA or GWBASIC which made migration of programs from CP/M systems to PC-compatibles possible. The tokens used to represent keywords were different, so CP/M programs had to be saved in ASCII source form. Typically screen formatting escape sequences put into the CP/M version would be replaced with the cursor positioning commands found in the PC versions of BASIC, otherwise little rewriting would be needed.

== BASCOM ==
Microsoft sold a CP/M BASIC compiler (known as BASCOM) which used a similar source language to MBASIC. A program debugged under MBASIC could be compiled with BASCOM. Since program text was no longer in memory and the run-time elements of the compiler were smaller than the interpreter, more memory was available for user data. Speed of real program execution increased about 3 fold.

Developers welcomed BASCOM as an alternative to the popular but slow and clumsy CBASIC. Unlike CBASIC, BASCOM did not need a preprocessor for MBASIC source code so could be debugged interactively. While approving of its superior edit-compile-run-debug loop compared to CBASIC, and stating that binaries ran far faster, Jerry Pournelle in December 1980 denounced Microsoft&#x27;s requirement of a 9% royalty for each binary copy and $40 for hardware-software combinations. The company also reserved the right to audit developers&#x27; financial records. Because authors&#x27; typical royalty rates for software was 10-25%, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; in 1980 stated that BASCOM&#x27;s additional 9% royalty rate &quot;could make software development downright unprofitable&quot;, concluding that &quot;Microsoft has the technical solution [to CBASIC&#x27;s flaws], but not the economic one&quot;.

== Importance of MBASIC ==
MBASIC was an important tool during the era of 8-bit CP/M computers. Skilled users could write routines in MBASIC to automate tasks that in modern-day systems would be performed by powerful application program commands or scripting languages. Exchange of useful MBASIC programs was a common function of computer users&#x27; groups. Keying in long BASIC listings from a magazine article was one way of &quot;bootstrapping&quot; software into a new CP/M system. At least one compiler for a high-level language was written in MBASIC, and many small games and utility programs ranging from a few lines to a few thousand lines of code were written.

== Other uses ==
MBASIC is also the name of a commercial BASIC compiler for the Microchip Technology PIC microcontroller family developed by Basic Micro, Inc., unrelated to the CP/M interpreter.

<text>Jerome Martin Koosman (born December 23, 1942) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets, Minnesota Twins, Chicago White Sox, and Philadelphia Phillies between and . Koosman is best known as a member of the Miracle Mets team that won the 1969 World Series.

==New York Mets==

===Rookie year===
Koosman was discovered by the son of a Shea Stadium usher, John Lucchese, who caught Koosman when he pitched in the United States Army at Fort Bliss, Texas. The Mets offered Koosman a contract after his discharge from the military. Koosman was about to be cut from the Mets in 1966, when Joe McDonald, the assistant farm director, requested Koosman be retained at least until his first payday, as he owed the Mets money they had wired him after his car broke down en route to spring training.

After leading all International League pitchers in strikeouts in , Koosman broke into the Mets’ rotation in . He posted a 19–12 record with seven shutouts, 178 strikeouts, and a 2.08 earned run average. The wins, shutouts, and ERA set franchise records, breaking those set by teammate Tom Seaver the year prior. Koosman also made the first of two All-Star teams in his career. The National League won the game 1–0 (to date, the only All-Star Game to end in a 1–0 score) in the &quot;Year of the Pitcher.&quot; Koosman pitched a scoreless ninth for the save, striking out Carl Yastrzemski for the final out. Koosman was named to the 1968 Topps All-Star Rookie Roster and finished runner-up to Johnny Bench for the National League Rookie of the Year honors.

===The Miracle Mets===

In Koosman posted a 17–9 record with a 2.28 ERA and 180 strikeouts in another All-Star season. That year, he was a member of the Mets team that unexpectedly won the National League East title (both leagues had split into two divisions after expanding from ten teams to 12) after finishing last in five of their first seven seasons, as well as trailing the Chicago Cubs for much of the season, and by as many as 9 games. After Koosman lost to the Houston Astros to fall to 9–8, he won eight of his final nine decisions.

In Game Two of the NLCS against the Atlanta Braves, Koosman was shelled for six runs in 4 innings (including a Hank Aaron three-run homer). The Mets won 11–6, however, then won the next game to complete the series sweep.

Koosman was the pitching star of the 1969 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles. After Seaver was defeated in Game One, Koosman, leading 1–0, held the Orioles hitless until Paul Blair singled to lead off the bottom of the seventh inning, eventually scoring on Brooks Robinson&#x27;s only hit in 19 Series&#x27; at-bats. The Mets regained the lead in the top of the ninth; Koosman got two outs in the bottom of the frame, then walked the next two batters. He was relieved by Ron Taylor, who induced Robinson to ground out to end the game.

With the Series shifting from Memorial Stadium to Shea Stadium for the next three games, the Mets won Games Three and Four, and Koosman took the mound for Game Five. He fell behind 3–0 in the third inning after giving up home runs to his mound opponent, Dave McNally, and Frank Robinson. The Mets, however, cut into the Oriole lead on Donn Clendenon&#x27;s two-run home run in the sixth, then tied the game in the seventh on a homer by Al Weis, who had hit only six career homers at that point—none of which had been in a home game. The Mets scored two runs in the eighth to take the lead, and after walking Frank Robinson to lead off the ninth, Koosman retired the next three hitters to end the game and complete the Mets’ improbable World Series win.

====Game ball for game 5====
After catching Davey Johnson&#x27;s fly ball for the final out of the World Series, left fielder Cleon Jones gave the game ball to Koosman. That ball, as well as the game ball from Game 2, was stored in a safe in Koosman&#x27;s residence. In the early 1990s, Koosman sold the ball from Game 5. The Game 5 ball&#x27;s current whereabouts are unknown.

===&quot;Ya Gotta Believe!&quot; and &quot;It Ain’t Over &#x27;til It&#x27;s Over&quot;===

In Koosman posted a 12–7 record with a 3.14 ERA. Over the next two seasons, however, he posted losing records: 6–11 in (a season in which he was beset by arm woes) and 11–12 in with a 4.14 ERA—more than a run and a half above his career ERA to that point. In he went 5–0 in his first six starts, but ended the season 14–15. In late August/early September of that year, he set a Mets&#x27; record by pitching 31 consecutive scoreless innings (R. A. Dickey broke his mark by pitching 32 consecutive scoreless innings in ). As in 1969, the Mets unexpectedly won the NL East title—once again overtaking the Cubs, whom they had trailed this time by as many as nine games—on the strength of the pitching of Koosman, Seaver and the previous year&#x27;s NL Rookie of the Year, Jon Matlack. This comeback gave rise to two slogans: Tug McGraw&#x27;s &quot;Ya Gotta Believe!&quot; and manager Yogi Berra&#x27;s &quot;It ain’t over &#x27;til it&#x27;s over.&quot;

In Game Three of the NLCS against the Cincinnati Reds, Koosman pitched a complete game for a 9–2 victory in a game that was headlined by Pete Rose&#x27;s altercation with Mets&#x27; shortstop Bud Harrelson. The victory gave the Mets a 2–1 lead in the NLCS; they won the pennant two days later in five games.

Koosman was the winning pitcher in Game Five of the World Series against the defending champion Oakland Athletics, holding Oakland scoreless for 6 innings. This victory gave the Mets a 3–2 lead in the Series; however, Oakland won the next two games to repeat as World Champions.

===Later Met years===

Koosman posted a 15–11 record in and 14–13 record in . In he had possibly his best season ever, establishing career bests with 21 wins (against 10 losses) and 200 strikeouts. He also finished runner-up to Randy Jones for the National League Cy Young Award. In , the Mets traded Seaver to the Reds. The remainder of the team deteriorated, especially Koosman who slumped to 8–20, finishing tied with Phil Niekro for most losses in the NL. After a 3–15 season in Koosman, seeing no imminent improvement to the team, was traded to the Minnesota Twins at his request. His departure left Ed Kranepool as the last remaining member of the 1969 Miracle Mets (although Seaver returned to the Mets for the 1983 season).

The Mets acquired Jesse Orosco in the trade that sent Koosman to the Twins. (Orosco had been the player to be named later who went to the Mets to complete the deal, which had been made two months earlier, in December 1978.)

==Later career==


Koosman rebounded in to post a 20–13 record, and went 16–13 in . On August 30, , less than a month after the 1981 players&#x27; strike ended, the Twins traded Koosman to the Chicago White Sox. He went 4–13 on the season, again finishing tied for his league lead in losses.

Koosman posted identical 11–7 records in and . In the latter year, the White Sox won the American League West title to make their first post-season appearance since the 1959 World Series; however, the Baltimore Orioles defeated the White Sox in four games. After the season Koosman was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies; he went 14–15 in his last productive season.

On April 13, 1984 Koosman gave up a double to Pete Rose for his 4000th hit.

With 222 wins, he is tied (with Hooks Dauss) at #72 on the all-time win list. He ended his career with a 222–209 record and a 3.36 ERA in 612 games. He struck out 2,556 batters in 3,839 innings pitched.

Koosman has the third most wins in Mets history (140) behind Tom Seaver (198) and Dwight Gooden (157).

Koosman was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in . He attended the 40th anniversary reunion of the 1969 Miracle Mets at Citi Field on August 22, 2009.

The Mets retired Koosman&#x27;s number 36 on August 28, 2021, making him the third Mets player (after Tom Seaver and Mike Piazza) to have his number retired. Koosman has since been joined by Keith Hernandez, Willie Mays and Dwight Gooden in having their numbers retired.

==Federal tax conviction==

In May 2009, Koosman pleaded guilty to misdemeanor federal tax evasion after failing to pay up to $90,000 in federal income taxes for 2002, 2003, and 2004. Koosman admitted to being &quot;suckered&quot; by anti-tax rhetoric. On September 3, 2009, he was sentenced to six months in prison. He was released from Federal Prison Camp, Duluth on June 30, 2010.

<text>Edward Emil Kranepool III (November 8, 1944 – September 8, 2024) was an American professional baseball player. He spent his entire Major League Baseball career with the New York Mets. He was predominantly a first baseman, but he also played in the outfield.

Born in the Bronx, New York, Kranepool attended James Monroe High School, where he began playing baseball and basketball. Mets&#x27; scout Bubber Jonnard signed Kranepool in at the age of 17 as an amateur free agent. By the time he retired in 1979, he had become the last remaining Met from their inaugural 1962 season and was a member of the Miracle Mets World Championship team of 1969.

==Baseball career==
===1962–1963: Debut with the Mets===
After batting a combined .301 at three levels of the Mets&#x27; minor league system in 1962, Kranepool received a September call-up in just his first professional season. At age 17, Kranepool was six years younger than the next-youngest &#x27;62 Met, a reflection of the decision of Met management to select mostly older veterans in the expansion draft. He made his major league debut wearing number 21 on September 22, 1962, as a late inning defensive replacement for Gil Hodges at first base in a 9–2 loss to the Chicago Cubs at the Polo Grounds. He grounded out to Cubs second baseman Ken Hubbs in his only at bat. He made his first start the next day, September 23, playing first base, and went one for four with a double.

Kranepool began the season splitting playing time with &quot;Marvelous&quot; Marv Throneberry at first base and Duke Snider in right field. By May 5, Throneberry&#x27;s ineptitude at the plate (.143 batting average and only one run batted in during the first 23 games of the season) wore thin on Met fans and management, and he was demoted to the Mets&#x27; Triple A affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons. Tim Harkness was awarded the first base job, with Snider shifting to left field and Kranepool becoming the Mets&#x27; everyday right fielder. This arrangement, however, did not last, as Kranepool was sent down to the minors in July with a .190 batting average. He resurfaced later that season as a September call-up, and went four for five with a run batted in and a run scored in his first game back. He continued to hit better following his late season call-up, and managed to bring his batting average up to .209 for the season.

===1964: Earning the first base job===
With Harkness, Dick Smith, and Frank Thomas sharing first base, Kranepool received most of his playing time in right field at the start of the season. On May 24, Joe Christopher was batting .303 and had won a starting job in right field. He was awarded the right field job, and Kranepool was demoted to Buffalo with a .139 batting average.

Kranepool played just 15 games with the Bisons, hitting three home runs and batting .352 to earn a promotion back to the Mets. On his last day with the Bisons, Kranepool played all 18 innings of a double header, before getting the call to come to Shea Stadium where the Mets were playing two games the next day. On Sunday, May 31, he played first base in game one of the double header against the San Francisco Giants. Kranepool also played first in the second game of the double header, which went 23 innings. Kranepool ended up playing all 23 innings, going four for 14 over the two games. In all, he played 50 innings in two days. &quot;I wish we could have played another 40 minutes&quot;, Kranepool was later quoted as saying of the record setting double header that lasted nearly 10 hours and ended at 11:20 PM. &quot;That way, I could always say I played in a game that started in May and ended in June.&quot;

These two games were the start of a 13-game hitting streak that saw Kranepool&#x27;s batting average rise to .264. For the season, Kranepool batted .257 with 10 home runs and 45 RBI.

===1965–1966: All-Star===
Prior to the start of the season, the Mets acquired future Hall of fame pitcher Warren Spahn from the Milwaukee Braves. Kranepool gave up his number 21 to Spahn, who had worn that number his entire career, and began wearing number 7.

By midseason, Kranepool was batting .287 with seven home runs and 37 RBIs. He was named the Mets sole representative on the National League All-Star team at the 1965 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, though he did not play. By the end of the season, Kranepool&#x27;s batting average had fallen to .253, but that was still enough to lead the Mets, as the team lost 112 games that season and finished in tenth and last place in the National League. He also led his team with 133 hits and 24 doubles.

In , Kranepool paced the Mets with a career high 16 home runs to help the Mets avoid a last place finish and 100 losses for the first time in franchise history (95).

===1969: Miracle Mets===
Kranepool was reportedly part of proposed a trade package along with Amos Otis and Bob Heise when the Mets attempted to acquire the Braves&#x27; Joe Torre who went to the St. Louis Cardinals for Orlando Cepeda instead.

On May 21, , the Mets won their third game in a row for a .500 winning percentage 36 games into the season for the first time in franchise history. This was followed by a five-game losing streak that saw the Mets fall into fourth place in the newly aligned National League East.

The Mets then went on an 11-game winning streak that included a two home run performance by Kranepool against the Los Angeles Dodgers. By the end of the streak, the Mets were in second place, seven games back of the Chicago Cubs.

On July 8, Kranepool hit a fifth-inning home run off Ferguson Jenkins to give the Mets a 1–0 lead over the Cubs. By the time the Mets batted in the ninth inning, however, the first place Cubs had taken a 3–1 lead. The Mets scored three runs in the ninth to win the game, with Cleon Jones scoring the last run on Kranepool&#x27;s single to center.

The Mets completed their remarkable &quot;Miracle&quot; 1969 season, in which the team, backed by Kranepool, Tom Seaver, and Jerry Koosman, won their first World Series title against the Baltimore Orioles. Kranepool hit a home run in game three of the series, a 5–0 win for the Mets.

===1970–1973: Demoted to Tidewater===

On June 23, , Kranepool was batting just .118, and was demoted to the Mets&#x27; triple A affiliate, the Tidewater Tides. He considered retirement, but instead, he accepted his reassignment, and batted .310 in 47 games at Tidewater. He was back with the Mets by the middle of August, but saw very little playing time. For the season, Kranepool had only 52 plate appearances in 43 games.

Kranepool bounced back with perhaps his best season in , batting .280 with 14 home runs, 58 RBI, and an on-base plus slugging+ of 123. He also led the National League with a .998 fielding percentage. The late-career demotion marked a turning point for Kranepool, with him becoming a useful hitter and first baseman/outfielder despite never entering a season with a specific full-time role.

In , Kranepool lost his starting job at first base to John Milner. Kranepool still managed to play 100 games and make 320 plate appearances backing up Milner at first and Cleon Jones in left. The Mets won the NL East, and faced the Cincinnati Reds in the 1973 National League Championship Series. Kranepool&#x27;s only appearance in the NLCS was in game five, and he drove in the first two runs of the Mets&#x27; series clinching victory to lead his team to the 1973 World Series. He played in 4 games of the 1973 World Series, going hitless in 3 at bats.

===1974–1976: Joan Payson&#x27;s death===
Kranepool batted .300 in consecutive seasons in and , sharing first base duties with Milner and Dave Kingman. When Mets owner Joan Payson died on October 4, 1975, she left the team to her husband Charles. While Joan had been the driving force behind the Mets, her survivors did not share her enthusiasm. Charles delegated his authority to his three daughters, who left control of baseball matters to club chairman M. Donald Grant. According to an interview with Kranepool, he was the only Met player invited to Mrs. Payson&#x27;s funeral.

The Mets enjoyed the second best winning percentage in franchise history in when they went 86–76 to finish third in the NL East. Kranepool was again a regular first baseman with the Mets that season, batting .292 with 10 home runs and 49 RBIs.
He compiled his best offensive years from 1974 through 1977, hitting .299 in 431 games with 28 home runs and 156 runs batted in.

===1977–1979: Pinch-hitting and retirement===
Popular centerfielder Lee Mazzilli became the face of the organization. Kranepool, perhaps as a symbol of the Mets&#x27; past glory, emerged as a fan favorite as well, despite his relegation to a limited pinch hitting role at that point in his career. From through , Kranepool hit .396 as a pinch hitter, batting .486 (17-for-35) in the role in 1974, still the major league single-season pinch hit batting average record. After the Mets traded Jerry Koosman at the end of the 1978 season, Kranepool became the last of the 1969 Miracle Mets.

When he retired after the season at the age of 34, he was the all-time Mets leader in eight offensive categories (all since surpassed).

As a pinch-hitter, Kranepool went 90-for-325 (.277) in his career with 6 home runs and 55 RBI.

Through the 2024 season, he still holds the mark of most games played with the Mets at 1,853 and became an enduring legend among Mets fans for having played 18 seasons. He was the last of the 1962 Mets to remain with the team, and the last of that team to retire from Major League Baseball.

Though still relatively young at that time, he was only useful as long as his pinch-hits kept dropping in. He had also reportedly had some friction with the team&#x27;s ownership group, led by Lorinda DeRoulet who was controlling the team after the death of her mother, Joan Payson. When the team was sold after the 1979 season to a group headed by Nelson Doubleday Jr. and Fred Wilpon, Kranepool was part of one of the groups offering a losing bid.

Kranepool had career fielding percentage of .994 as a first baseman and .975 as an outfielder. Overall, he finished with a .993 fielding percentage.

==Commercials and television appearances==
A 1978 television commercial for Gillette Foamy shaving cream began with black-and-white film footage of Kranepool striking out, and an announcer saying, &quot;From 1962 to 1970, Ed Kranepool batted .227. Then Ed switched to Gillette Foamy.&quot; The ad showed Kranepool in front of a mirror, lathering up and shaving, and switched to color footage of him hitting a ball down the right-field line. The announcer said, &quot;Since 1971, Ed&#x27;s batted .283! What do you think of that, Ed?&quot; As baseball players had long had a reputation for being superstitious, the ad closed with Kranepool standing in the dugout, in uniform but lathered up and holding up a can of Foamy, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, but now I shave every other inning.&quot; The closing narration was, &quot;Foamy: More than thick and rich enough for New York&#x27;s heavy hitters.&quot;

Another Gillette commercial featured Kranepool lighting a candle in his bathroom and trying to shave using Foamy during a blackout. The ad was clearly inspired by the New York blackout of the previous season, which came during a Mets home game at Shea Stadium on July 13, 1977. Kranepool also appeared in an ad for SportsPhone with Jerry Koosman.

Kranepool caught flak for a campaign commercial he did for New York Senator Alfonse D&#x27;Amato in which he appeared wearing a New York Mets uniform. Following protest from the Mets&#x27; ownership group, the commercial was quickly pulled. Kranepool also appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in a cameo appearance, being interviewed by Bill Murray during a skit filmed during spring training in , regarding Chico Escuela&#x27;s (portrayed by Garrett Morris) tell all book, &quot;Bad Stuff &#x27;bout The Mets&quot; (a parody of Sparky Lyle&#x27;s tell all book about the New York Yankees, &quot;The Bronx Zoo&quot;). He appeared as himself in a episode of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; along with several other members of the 1969 Mets.

==Post-retirement and health problems==
Kranepool made a living after retirement as a stockbroker, a restaurateur, and working for a credit card processing company. He was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1990. He ranks third on the all-time Mets hits list with 1,418. He was surpassed by Mets third baseman David Wright, with 1,777, and, in 2017, by José Reyes, who has 1,534 hits as a member of the Mets.

Kranepool developed diabetes shortly after retirement. In 2017, Kranepool had a toe removed due to an abscess that became infected. The infection could not be controlled because both of his kidneys were failing. At the time, Kranepool was on a waiting list for a kidney transplant. On May 7, 2019, Kranepool received a kidney transplant from a living donor at Stony Brook University Hospital.

Kranepool&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Last Miracle: My 18-Year Journey with the Amazin&#x27; New York Mets&quot;, was released in August 2023.

=== Death ===
Kranepool died of cardiac arrest in Boca Raton, Florida, on September 8, 2024, at the age of 79.

<text>Trans International Airlines (TIA) started as a United States supplemental air carrier. From 1964, such carriers were simply charter carriers, but until 1964 they also had the ability to fly a limited amount of scheduled service. After US airline deregulation in 1979, it also operated scheduled passenger service flying as Transamerica Airlines as well as passenger and cargo charter flights during its last decade. Its headquarters were at Oakland International Airport (OAK) in Oakland, California.

In 1947, future travel and entertainment mogul Kirk Kerkorian purchased Los Angeles Air Service, a small irregular air carrier, for $60,000. As tourism to Las Vegas, Nevada, boomed, so did the fortunes of the airline. From a single Douglas DC-3, the company expanded rapidly, adding Douglas DC-6s and Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellations, and it became the first charter airline to operate jet aircraft with the introduction of the Douglas DC-8 on trans-Pacific routes as well as the Boeing 727 on shorter routes. The airline later added McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Boeing 747 wide body jetliners to its fleet.

To better reflect its growing route structure, the airline was renamed Trans International Airlines in 1960. Between 1966 and 1986 TIA operated regular charter flights between the U.S. and Europe. International destinations were Paris Orly (ORY), London Gatwick (LGW), Brussels Zaventem (BRU) and Frankfurt (FRA). TIA contributed to cheap transatlantic flights which did not exist at the time. 
In 1962, as part of its diversification strategy that had seen companies such as Onan, Gravely Tractor and Cincinnati Testing Labs join its automotive operations, the Studebaker Corporation purchased the airline, retaining Kerkorian as president. In June 1964, Studebaker sold the company back to Kerkorian and a partner, with Studebaker&#x27;s president citing a desire to concentrate on manufactured goods like appliances, auto parts and tractors, instead of air travel. Kerkorian took the company public in 1965, then sold his interests in 1968 to insurance conglomerate Transamerica Corporation, profiting an estimated $85 million. He reinvested proceeds from the sale in Las Vegas property, notably the International Hotel. In 1966, the airline moved its headquarters from Las Vegas to Oakland, California.

Transamerica Corporation later assumed the passenger contracts of bankrupt Universal Airlines and in December 1976, bought Saturn Airways, and merged their operations into TIA. The airline remained focused on charter and cargo operations until the passage of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, which gave it the opportunity to offer scheduled passenger service. In 1979 the airline was renamed Transamerica Airlines and on November 2 of that year it commenced scheduled transatlantic passenger flights to Shannon (SNN) and Amsterdam (AMS). The May 1, 1982 Transamerica route map depicted scheduled nonstop flights being operated between Amsterdam and New York City as well as between Shannon and Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City and Oakland, CA. By 1983, the airline was flying scheduled service into Paris Orly Airport (ORY) on a weekly round trip routing of Paris-Shannon-Los Angeles-San Francisco with this flight being operated with a Super DC-8-73 jetliner.

Following the popular Alex Haley book &quot;&quot;, Transamerica flew charter flights between New York and Africa known as the &quot;Roots&quot; program. Other popular programs were to the Caribbean, South America, and Hong Kong. The airline also flew more than a hundred flights for the Jeddah hajj pilgrimage wet leased on behalf of Union des Transports Aériens (UTA) and Air Afrique.

During this time, the airline was under U.S. military contract and it operated a number of military charters. Most notable of these was the route that connected Clark Air Base, Philippines and Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, to Travis Air Force Base, California during the late 1970s, using DC-8s. TIA was heavily involved in the transport of troops during the Vietnam, Angola, and Middle East conflicts and the relocation of refugees.

In the early 1980s, Transamerica Corporation (per stockholder reports) announced its intention to divest all holdings that were not financial in nature. Transamerica Airlines, among the top five profitable holdings, was divested in 1986. Although there were potential buyers, it was more profitable to sell the airline in pieces and parts. The airline was dissolved and ceased operations on September 30, 1986.

==Second Trans International==
In 1984, Transamerica Corporation bought moribund Central American International, a former uncertificated carrier that the CAB certificated in 1981, and used its charter certificate to re-activate the Trans International Airlines (TIA) name. The new TIA, flying Super Douglas DC-8-61 aircraft, was led by Robert R. Lindberg as Chairman and CEO, and William A. Hardenstine as President (the latter formerly of World Airways). TIA operated in the mid-1980s, and was based at Orlando International Airport (MCO), Florida. TIA was sold as a going concern at approximately the same time as the larger Transamerica Airlines divested its aircraft.

==Transamerica destinations in 1984==
According to its May 1, 1984 system timetable, Transamerica Airlines was operating scheduled passenger service to the following destinations with the carrier using the two letter airline code &quot;TV&quot;:

* Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas (DFW)
* Frankfurt (FRA)
* Honolulu (HNL)
* Los Angeles (LAX)
* New York City (JFK)
* St. Louis (STL)
* Shannon, Ireland (SNN)
* Tel Aviv (TLV)

Also according to the above referenced timetable, all Transamerica passenger flights were being operated at this time with Boeing 747 aircraft with the exception of the New York-Shannon route which was being flown with Douglas DC-8-73 aircraft (which the airline called the &quot;Super-73&quot;).

Two years earlier in 1982, a Transamerica Airlines route map listed the following destinations being served with scheduled passenger flights: Amsterdam (AMS), Chicago (ORD), Los Angeles (LAX), New York City (JFK), Oakland, California (OAK) and Shannon (SNN).

Transamerica also operated charter flights from New York LaGuardia Airport (LGA) to Cozumel, Mexico (CZM) during the mid 1970s.

==Accidents and incidents==
* 8 September 1970: Trans International Airlines Flight 863, DC-8-63CF N4863T, a ferry flight from New York to Washington, DC, crashed shortly after takeoff when a foreign object lodged in the right elevator, jamming it and forcing the aircraft into a extreme nose-high attitude, from where it stalled and crashed. The National Transportation Safety Board cited the failure of the captain to adequately monitor the condition of the aircraft and reject the takeoff on time. All 11 crewmembers, the only people on board, were killed.

* 18 November 1979: Transamerica Lockheed L-188C Electra N859U operating Logair flight 3N18 for the US Air Force departed Hill Air Force Base en-route to Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas. While climbing between 12,000 and 13,000 ft, all electrical power was lost; the crew requested an immediate descent. The aircraft attained high airspeed and high rate of descent and disintegrated in flight, killing all three crew members. Probable cause was progressive failure of the electrical system leading to disabling or erratic performance of critical instruments and lighting in night-time instrument conditions. The crew became disoriented and lost control. The aircraft was inherited from Universal Airlines via Saturn Airways. Two other Universal Electras (N851U, N855U) previously crashed near Hill Air Force Base.

* 23 August 1980: Transamerica L-100-30 N18ST was descending into North Island Naval Air Station from Pensacola Naval Air Station at 5,000 ft when its tail hit and killed a parachutist near Otay, California. Aircraft and crew landed safely with minimal damage.

* 27 August 1983: Transamerica L-100-30 N17ST crashed in fog at an elevation of 2,650 near Dundo, Angola, killing all seven crew on board.

* 29 December 1984: Transamerica L-100-30 N24ST was destroyed on the ground by gunfire at Cafunfo, Angola.

<doc id="1195366" wikidata="Q3569102" url="?curid=1195366" title="Willie Randolph">
<text>William Larry Randolph (born July 6, 1954) is an American former professional baseball second baseman, coach, and manager. During an 18-year career in Major League Baseball (MLB), he played from 1975 to 1992 for six different teams, most notably the New York Yankees with whom he won back-to-back world titles against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He has joined ESPN as a post-season baseball analyst, beginning in September 2013. Mainly, he appeared on &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot; and provided updates during Monday and Wednesday night September network telecasts.

At the end of his playing career, he ranked fifth in major league history in games at second base (2,152), ninth in putouts (4,859), seventh in assists (6,336), eighth in total chances (11,429), and third in double plays (1,547). Upon retiring as a player, he joined the Yankees as a coach for 11 years. He later served as manager of the New York Mets from 2005 to June 2008, leading the Mets to a league-best record and the National League Championship Series in 2006.

==Playing career==
Randolph grew up in Brooklyn, New York, and graduated from Samuel J. Tilden High School, where he was a star athlete and was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 7th round of the 1972 draft. He made his major league debut in 1975, and was, at age 21, the sixth-youngest player in the National League.

He was traded with Dock Ellis and Ken Brett from the Pirates to the Yankees for Doc Medich on December 11, 1975.

Randolph spent 13 of his 18 seasons as a player with the Yankees and was co-captain of the Yankees with Ron Guidry from 1986 to 1988. He later played for the Los Angeles Dodgers (1989–90), Oakland Athletics (1990), and Milwaukee Brewers (1991), finishing his career with the New York Mets in 1992. He was selected to six All-Star teams over his career. As a career number 2 hitter in the order, he made use of his skills as bunter and a patient hitter who drew more than 80 walks seven times.

Randolph was also an outstanding defensive player, known especially for his ability to turn the double play. However, he never received the Gold Glove Award, which was perennially awarded to his equally sure-handed and more acrobatic and wide-ranging contemporaries: Frank White of the Kansas City Royals and Lou Whitaker of the Detroit Tigers. He was the Yankees&#x27; starting second baseman on the 1977 and 1978 World Series Championship teams.

In 1980 Randolph led the league in walks (119) and was second in the AL in on-base percentage (.427), eighth in stolen bases (30) and ninth in runs (99), and won the Silver Slugger Award at second base in the AL. He also batted .332 leading off the inning, and .340 with men in scoring position.
Randolph was involved in a controversial play during Game 2 of the 1980 American League Championship Series. He was on second base in the top of the eighth with two outs and the Yankees down by a run. Bob Watson hit a ball to the left field corner of Royals Stadium. Though the ball bounced to Willie Wilson, third base coach Mike Ferraro waved Randolph home. Wilson overthrew U L Washington, the cut-off man, but George Brett was in position behind him to catch the ball, then throw to Darrell Porter, who tagged out Randolph in a slide. TV cameras captured a furious George Steinbrenner fuming, hollering and swearing immediately after the play resulting in him being restrained by police when he tried to gain access to the field. The Yankees lost the game 3–2, then lost the series in three games.

In 1987 he batted .305 with a career-high 67 RBIs and led the league in at bats per strikeout (18.0), and was fourth in the AL in OBP (.411) and ninth in walks (82). He also batted .366 in tie games, and .345 in games that were late and close.

In December 1988 he signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Randolph led the Dodgers in batting average and hits in 1989, making his sixth All-Star team. In May 1990 he was traded by the Dodgers to the defending-world champion Oakland Athletics for Stan Javier. Later that year, Randolph and the A&#x27;s won the American League pennant, but were swept by the NL-champion Cincinnati Reds in the World Series.

In April 1991 he signed as a free agent with the Milwaukee Brewers. That year, Randolph was second in the AL on-base percentage (.424) and third in batting average (.327). He batted .373 with runners in scoring position.

In December 1991 he signed as a free agent with the New York Mets. In 1992, at 37 years old he was the eighth-oldest player in the NL. In his last career game with the Mets, the team&#x27;s second baseman of the future Jeff Kent moved to make his start at shortstop to allow Randolph to play his final game at second base.

Tommy John, Randolph&#x27;s teammate with the Yankees, called him the &quot;stabilizing influence&quot; and &quot;the club&#x27;s quiet leader&quot;. &quot;You couldn&#x27;t believe how good Willie was until you were on the same team and saw him play every day,&quot; John said.

==Coaching and managing career==
Randolph was a Yankees base and bench coach for 11 seasons, interviewing intermittently for managing jobs with other teams.

In 2004, Randolph was named Mets manager for the 2005 season. He became the eighth person to play for and later manage the Mets, joining Gil Hodges, Yogi Berra, Joe Torre, Bud Harrelson, Roy McMillan, Dallas Green, and Bobby Valentine (as well as interim manager Mike Cubbage). Randolph earned his first win as a manager on April 10, 2005, defeating the Atlanta Braves 2–1. The win halted a five-game losing streak to start the 2005 season. He then guided the Mets to five straight additional victories, giving the Mets their first six-game winning streak since August 2003.
Randolph ended his first season as manager of the 2005 Mets with an 83–79 record, the first time the franchise had finished above .500 since 2001, and 12 games better than the prior season. That record got them a tie for third place in the National League East.
In 2006, Randolph managed the Mets to a league-best 97–65 record (which also tied for the best record in the majors with the crosstown Yankees) and the NL East Division title (the team&#x27;s first division championship since 1988). The Mets came within one game of reaching the World Series, losing the seventh game of the NL Championship Series to the eventual world champion St. Louis Cardinals. Randolph was the first manager in major league history to have his team&#x27;s record improve by at least 12 games in each of his first two seasons (excluding seasons following strike-shortened seasons). He came in second place in the 2006 NL Manager of the Year voting, losing to Florida Marlins manager Joe Girardi. On January 24, 2007, Randolph signed a three-year, $5.65 million contract extension with the Mets. He had a club option for 2010 worth an additional $2.5 million.

In 2007, Randolph was managing the Mets when they had one of the worst collapses in major league history. Holding a seven-game first-place lead in the NL East with only 17 games to play, the Mets finished 5–12 and lost the division to the Philadelphia Phillies, who went 13–4 in the same timespan.

In 2008, Randolph&#x27;s job security steadily decreased after a disappointing start to the season and inconsistent performance through mid-June. On June 17, 2008, less than two hours after the Mets&#x27; 9–6 road victory over the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Randolph was fired, along with pitching coach Rick Peterson and first base coach Tom Nieto. He and his coaches were replaced by interim manager Jerry Manuel and coaches Ken Oberkfell, Dan Warthen, and Luis Aguayo. The team&#x27;s record at the time of the firing was 34–35, which was 6½ games behind the Phillies in the National League East. After 2008, the Mets did not have another winning season until 2015.

After the 2008 season, Randolph was interviewed by the Milwaukee Brewers for their managerial position. Although he was one of the three finalists, the job went to Ken Macha, and Randolph was given the bench coach position, which he held until November 2010. According to Brewers GM Doug Melvin, Randolph was asked to be Macha&#x27;s bench coach because Randolph had experience managing against National League teams, versus Macha&#x27;s American League experience.

On November 23, 2010, Randolph was named as the final piece to Buck Showalter&#x27;s coaching staff for the 2011 Baltimore Orioles. Randolph assumed the position of bench coach replacing Jeff Datz. In June 2011, Randolph switched places with John Russell, becoming Baltimore&#x27;s third-base coach. Randolph and the Orioles parted ways after the 2011 season.

On November 26, 2012, it was announced Randolph would be the third base coach in the World Baseball Classic for Team USA.

On February 16, 2015, the Yankees announced that they would honor Randolph with a plaque in Monument Park on June 20, 2015.

On October 21, 2015, Randolph was named as the manager of Team USA for the inaugural 2015 WBSC Premier12.

In August 2019, he became a United States national baseball team coach for the 2019 WBSC Premier12 tournament. The team finished fourth in the tournament, and failed to qualify for the 2020 Olympics as it finished behind Mexico, but will have another opportunity to qualify.

===Managerial record===

==Personal life==
As of 2008, Randolph resided in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey with his wife Gretchen. He has four children named Taniesha, Chantre, Andre, and Ciara. Tommy John has called him &quot;a devoted family man, a man interested in the community.&quot;

Randolph delivered the commencement address to Fordham University&#x27;s 2007 graduating class, of which his daughter Ciara was a member. That same day, he managed the second game in a three-game series against the Yankees.

== Notes ==
:1.Carlos Beltrán was also technically manager of the Mets after having played for them from 2005-2011, but stepped down from the position before managing a game.

<doc id="1195377" wikidata="Q7426775" url="?curid=1195377" title="Saturn Airways">
<text>Saturn Airways was a US supplemental air carrier, overseen by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), the now-defunct Federal agency that, at the time, tightly regulated almost all US air transport. Saturn merged into Trans International Airlines in 1976. From 1965 onward Saturn was majority owned by Howard Korth, who previously controlled AAXICO Airlines, which merged into Saturn in 1965. Originally a Florida company, Saturn moved to Oakland, California in 1967 where its headquarters were located on the grounds of Oakland International Airport.

== History ==
The company was initially an irregular air carrier known as All-American Airways based in Miami, unrelated to the local service carrier All-American Airways that became Allegheny Airlines (later US Airways). The company was incorporated in Florida as of January 1, 1948. In 1953, the airline had two C-46 aircraft and had breakeven financial results on $425,714 of revenue, 99% of which was passenger revenue, 87% military revenue. See External links for a photo of an All American Airways C-46.

In 1960 the airline changed its name to Saturn Airways and began operating Douglas DC-6s. Saturn bought larger DC-7Cs in 1963 from BOAC and operated them on transatlantic passenger charter flights. On 5 November 1965 Saturn acquired AAXICO Airlines, in a merger where the surviving management and ownership was from AAXICO, making it effectively an acquisition by AAXICO. In 1967 the airline moved from Miami to Oakland.

In December 1967 and January 1968 Saturn took delivery of two Douglas DC-8 Super 61CF jets. This allowed it to operate transcontinental cargo and passenger charter flights, some of which included military flights to South Vietnam. Between 1968 and 1974 it had two DC-8 Series 50 planes in its inventory and added a third Super 61CF in 1972. In May 1972, Universal Airlines, also based at Oakland airport, collapsed. Saturn added nine former Universal Lockheed L-188 Electra aircraft to its fleet, taking over Universal&#x27;s military transport obligation. See External links for a photo of an Electra in a transitional Universal/Saturn livery. Saturn also operated nineteen Lockheed Hercules aircraft.

Saturn specialized in unusual cargo, including the Triple Crown-winning racehorse Secretariat, a limousine for Archbishop Makarios of Cyprus, and satellite communication equipment for the 1972 visit by Richard Nixon to China, the first time a US commercial air freight flight landed in mainland China in over 20 years. Saturn also delivered Rolls-Royce engines (in the UK) to Lockheed (at Palmdale) for the L-1011 program using Lockheed L-100 Hercules, and had a special CAB certification to do so.


===Trans International Airlines merger===
Saturn merged into Trans International Airlines (TIA) on November 30, 1976, making Trans International the largest air cargo operation at the time. A significant motivation in the merger was for Howard J. Korth, CEO and 84% owner of Saturn to step back after over 30 years in the industry. Korth had previously been the 96.5% owner of AAXICO. In approving the TIA merger, the CAB went against the recommendation of its own administrative law judge and its own internal Bureau of Operating Rights, both of which recommended against the merger on competitive grounds. The Board itself, however, saw the two companies as largely complementary. In the year ending September 30, 1974, TIA made 84% of its revenue from passenger travel, whereas Saturn&#x27;s revenue was 64% air-freight, and, moreover, its only passenger aircraft were currently parked, due to the weak state of the passenger charter market. The CAB saw the combined company as better able to compete against both foreign carriers and US scheduled carriers. The CAB noted Saturn&#x27;s highest-among-supplementals profits (even above that of TIA, which was almost twice the size of Saturn by revenue), despite being only the fourth largest in revenue. In 1975, TIA&#x27;s revenues were $123.5mm (over $720mm in 2024 dollars) whereas Saturn&#x27;s were $65.9mm (over $400mm in 2024 dollars).

The merger took over two and a half years to arrange and consummate. The possibility was first disclosed April 1974 when the terms were 1.8 million shares of TIA-parent Transamerica Corporation valued at $15 million. The process was still ongoing in 1976, and as shown in the table above, Saturn&#x27;s profitability improved greatly during that time. Korth renegotiated the transaction to almost 2.6 million shares of Transamerica which, when the deal closed in November 1976, was worth $35 million (over $190 million in 2025 terms).

==Fleet==
At the time the merger with AAXICO was being evaluated by the CAB, Saturn had eight Douglas DC-7Cs, six of them leased, two of them owned.

December 1967:
*15 Douglas DC-6

As of August 1971:

* 2 Douglas DC-8-61CF
* 1 Douglas DC-8-50
* 3 Lockheed L-100-20 Hercules
* 4 Lockheed L-100-30 Hercules
At the time the merger with Trans International was being evaluated by the CAB, Saturn had:

* 11 Lockheed L-100 Hercules
* 9 Lockheed L-188C Electra freighters
* 3 Douglas DC-8-61CF (not in service)
==Accidents and incidents==
* 11 August 1951 C-46F N3908B operating on a flight to Philadelphia from Newark, New Jersey suffered a loss of directional control on takeoff, overrunning the end of the runway into a swampy area. The four crew and 41 passengers on board evacuated safely before the aircraft was consumed by fire.
* 24 January 1967 DC-6 registration N74841 on a training flight applied asymmetric thrust on landing at Oakland, California, causing the aircraft to swerve off the runway and into mud, collapsing part of the landing gear and ripping off two propellers. The pilot in charge was cited for improper supervision. The four crew were safe but the aircraft was damaged beyond economic repair.
* 31 January 1967 DC-6A registration N640NA was operating on a cargo flight to Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona. Due to heavy fog, the crew diverted to San Antonio International Airport. The airplane descended 1100 feet below the glide slope, flew through trees and collided with a cliff, with the resulting destruction of the aircraft and deaths of three crew on board.
* October 10, 1970 Lockheed L-100-20 Hercules registration N9248R on a flight from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base became disoriented on approach to McGuire Air Force Base due to fog and glare and crashed into trees about a mile short of the runway, killing all three crew on board.
* 23 May 1974 Lockheed L-100-30 Hercules registration N14ST was en-route from Alameda, California to Indianapolis when the left wing failed due to metal fatigue, causing the aircraft to crash near Springfield, Illinois. Three crew and a Navy courier perished and the aircraft was destroyed.

<doc id="1195386" wikidata="Q506681" url="?curid=1195386" title="Bill of sale">
<text>A bill of sale is a document that transfers ownership of goods from one person to another. It is used in situations where the former owner transfers possession of the goods to a new owner. Bills of sale may be used in a wide variety of transactions: to sell goods, exchange, give, or mortgage objects. They can be used only to transfer ownership of goods that people already own or to transfer ownership of moveable tangible goods and only by individuals and unincorporated businesses.

Bills of sale exist in common law quite independently of any legislation. In England and Wales, they are regulated by two Victorian pieces of legislation: the Bills of Sale Act 1878 (41 &amp; 42 Vict. c. 31) and the Bills of Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882 (45 &amp; 46 Vict. c. 43). This area of the law was subject to review by the Law Commission, which published a proposal for change in 2017.

== United States ==

===Historical origin===

The term &quot;bill of sale&quot; originally referred to any writing by which an absolute disposition of personalty for value was effected or evidenced. A common feature of such dispositions is that the owner mortgagor remains in possession and exercises all the attendant rights of ownership, which may be so overwhelming as to induce a third party to accept the same chattel as security for a grant, albeit without notice of the first mortgagee. This scenario made the bill of sale a veritable tool of fraud.

The evolution of various bills of sale laws, within the US, was to curb the use of the bill of sale as a means of defrauding innocent persons.

A bill of sale has been defined as a legal document made by the seller to a purchaser, reporting that on a specific date at a specific locality and for a particular sum of money or other value received, the seller sold to the purchaser a specific item of personal property or parcel of real property of which he had lawful possession. &quot;Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot; on its part defines a bill of sale as &quot;an instrument for the conveyance of title to personal property, absolutely or by way of security&quot;. According to Omotola the bill of sale is &quot;a form of legal mortgage of chattels&quot;. Bullen and Leake and Jacobs define a bill of sale as &quot;a document transferring a proprietary interest in personal chattels from one individual (the &#x27;grantor&#x27;) to another (the &#x27;grantee&#x27;), without possession being delivered to the grantee&quot;.

In essence, a bill of sale is a written instrument showing the voluntary transfer of a right or interest or title to personal property, either by way of security or absolutely, from one person to another without the actual physical possession of the property leaving the owner and being delivered to the other party. It is clear from the definitions above that the bills of sale are essentially of two types: The absolute bill of sale and the conditional bill of sale.

===The absolute bill of sale===
Absolute bills of sale, which do not represent any form of security whatsoever, are simply documents evidencing assignments, transfers, and other assurances of personal chattels, which are substantially no more than mere contracts of sale of goods covered by the common law of contract and the sale of goods law.

===The conditional bill of sale===
The conditional bill of sale refers to any assignment or transfer of personal chattels to a person by way of security for the payment of money. The conditional bill of sale creates a security in favour of the grantee of the bill whereby the grantee is given personal right of seizure giving right to a security interest of a possessory nature.

There are other forms of security over goods such as a pledge and contractual lien which also only give right to a security interest of a possessory nature.

An example of a conditional bill of sale can be found where a creditor gives a loan and has transferred to himself, as collateral or security for the loan, the title of the goods or other personal property of the debtor. The physical goods or other property however remains with the debtor.

== England and Wales ==

=== Historical perspective ===
Bills of sale have existed at common law since at least the Middle Ages when they were most commonly used commercially in the shipping industry. As the general population began to own more personal goods in the Victorian era, bills of sale came to be used as a form of consumer credit. Lenders would extend credit on the security of:

Most often, people would grant bills of sale over their goods as security for a loan. Borrowers would transfer ownership of their goods to the lender, while retaining possession of them when making repayments. When the loan was repaid, the borrower would regain ownership. Bills of sale used in this way are known as &quot;security bills&quot;.

Sometimes, bills of sale would transfer ownership outright, such as when a person sold their goods to another while retaining possession. Bills of sale used for purposes other than borrowing money are known as &quot;absolute bills&quot;.

=== Bills of Sale Acts ===
The increased use of bills of sale in the Victorian era created a &quot;false wealth&quot; problem. Potential purchasers and other lenders could be misled into thinking that the person in possession of goods still owned them. The person in possession could sell the goods or use them to secure another loan. In both cases, the transaction was fraudulent, but the purchaser or lender had no way of discovering that the goods were already subject to a bill of sale.

As a result, Parliament passed the Bills of Sale Act 1878 (41 &amp; 42 Vict. c. 31). This largely replicated the provisions of an earlier Bills of Sale Act 1854 (17 &amp; 18 Vict. c. 36). It requires all bills of sale to be registered at the High Court so that interested third parties could check whether the person in possession has already transferred away ownership of goods.

The Bills of Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882 (45 &amp; 46 Vict. c. 43) had a different purpose. The 1878 Act led to a rise in the use of security bills. Concerns were expressed that such transactions could lead &quot;thousands of honest and respectable people to their ruin&quot;. Parliament noted that:

In response, Parliament enacted the 1882 Act, adding registration and understandable terms as forms of consumer protection, which land had already enjoyed for decades in many counties due to its compulsory registration of deeds of sale.

Both Acts remain in force today. Absolute bills are regulated only by the 1878 Act. Security bills are regulated by both and the latter naturally dominates by law.

=== Bills of sale in the 21st century ===
In the twenty-first century, bills of security are overwhelmingly used in the form of so-called &quot;logbook loans&quot;. These are security bills secured on the borrower&#x27;s vehicle. Borrowers transfer ownership contingently of their car, van or motorcycle to the logbook lender as security for meeting their loan repayments. While making repayments, borrowers keep possession (continue use). Borrowers hand the logbook lender the V5C vehicle registration document or &quot;logbook&quot;; whilst if taken to the court for civil breach of the Act (which is usually prohibitively expensive and complex), the lender would swear the transfer were purely symbolic and has no legal effect as it warns on its face, in reality they may seize the vehicle amicably, or with menaces, and in either case effect its transfer at the DVLA if any repayment instalment is missed. The bill of security is wrongly not registered as a trader&#x27;s hire purchase agreement tends to be.

=== Criticism and reform of the law ===
The law of bills of sale has been criticised on a number of occasions. The Crowther report in 1971 and the Diamond report in 1986 both considered the acts, with the latter recommending repeal.

In its consultation paper, the Law Commission made a number of criticisms of the law as it stood in 2015. It proposed to replace the Bills of Sale Acts with a new Goods Mortgages Act.

In its consultation paper, the Law Commission identified five key problems with the Bills of Sale Acts:
* undue complexity;
* highly technical documentation;
* the registration regime is in need of modernisation;
* they offer little protection to borrowers;
* they offer no protection to third party purchasers.

The Law Commission proposed to replace the Bills of Sale Acts with a new Goods Mortgage Act that would address each of the criticisms identified in the consultation paper.

<text>Philip Bradley Bird (born September 24, 1957) is an American filmmaker, animator, and voice actor. He has had a career spanning over four decades in both animation and live-action.

Bird was born in Montana and grew up in Oregon. He developed an interest in the art of animation early on, and completed his first short subject by age 14. Bird sent the film to Walt Disney Productions, leading to an apprenticeship from the studio&#x27;s Nine Old Men. He attended the California Institute of the Arts in the late 1970s, and worked for Disney shortly thereafter.

In the 1980s, he worked in film development with various studios; he wrote the screenplay for &quot;Batteries Not Included&quot; (1987), and developed two episodes of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; for Steven Spielberg, including its spin-off (based on a segment written by Bird for the show), the widely panned animated sitcom &quot;Family Dog&quot;. Afterwards, Bird joined &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as creative consultant for eight seasons. He directed the traditional animated feature &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; (1999), adapted from a book by poet Ted Hughes; though critically lauded, it was a box-office bomb. He moved to Pixar where he wrote and directed two computer-animated films, &quot;The Incredibles&quot; (2004) and &quot;Ratatouille&quot; (2007) that were worldwide critical and financial smash hits; they earned Bird two Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature wins and Best Original Screenplay nominations. He transitioned to live-action filmmaking with similarly successful &quot;&quot; (2011), he then directed Disney&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrowland&quot; (2015). He returned to Pixar to develop &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; (2018), which became the second-highest-grossing animated film of all time during its theatrical run, and earned him another nomination for the Academy Award.

Bird has a reputation for supervising his projects to a high degree of detail. He advocates for creative freedom and the possibilities of animation, and has criticized its stereotype as children&#x27;s entertainment, or classification as a genre, rather than an art.

==Early life==

Philip Bradley Bird was born in September 24, 1957, in Kalispell, Montana, the youngest of four children to Marjorie A. (née Cross) and Philip Cullen Bird. His father worked in the propane business, and his grandfather, Francis Wesley &quot;Frank&quot; Bird, who was born in County Sligo, Ireland, was a president and chief executive of the Montana Power Company. Bird&#x27;s fascination with filmmaking began at an early age. He started drawing at age three, with his first cartoons clear attempts at sequential storytelling. He was particularly enamored with animation after a screening of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967), and a family friend who had taken animation classes explained how the medium worked. Bird&#x27;s father found a used camera that could shoot one frame at a time, and helped him setup the device for making films. He began animating his first short subject at age 11; that same year, his family connection introduced him to composer George Bruns, who set him up a tour of Walt Disney Productions in Burbank, California. Bird met the Nine Old Men—the animators responsible for the studio&#x27;s earliest and most celebrated features—and proclaimed he would join them one day.

Bird has characterized his parents as generous and supportive of his interests. His mother once made a rainy drive two hours each way to the only theater playing a reissue of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; for Bird&#x27;s education. After two years, Bird had completed his first short, a fifteen-minute adaption of &quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&quot;. On his parents&#x27; advice, to &quot;start at the top and work your way down&quot;, he sent the film to his idols at Disney. The studio responded with an open invitation for Bird to stop by whenever in town, which led him to make several visits to the studio&#x27;s California headquarters in the ensuing years. This opportunity—an &quot;unofficial apprenticeship&quot; of sorts—was &quot;never offered&quot; to anyone previously. He worked closely with Milt Kahl, whom he considered a hero. He began another film, titled &quot;Ecology American Style&quot;, which was more ambitious and in color, but the workload was intense. Instead, Bird focused on other interests in his high school years, including dating, athletics, and photography. &quot;Animation is the illusion of life, and you can&#x27;t create that illusion convincingly if you haven&#x27;t lived it,&quot; he later remarked. The family relocated to Corvallis, Oregon in his youth, and he graduated from Corvallis High School in 1975.

That year, he was awarded a scholarship by Disney to attend the newly formed California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) in Valencia, California; Bird has joked he was a &quot;retired&quot; animator by the time he received this offer. Instead, he considered attending the acting program at Ashland University. After a three-year break, Bird chose CalArts and moved down south. Bird&#x27;s classmates included prominent future animators such as John Lasseter, Tim Burton, and Henry Selick. Like many students, they were dazzled by the special effects in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977); both Lasseter and Bird agreed these feats were possible in animation. First-year students met in the room labeled A113—a small, sterile classroom with no windows. Bird later used A113 as an Easter egg in his films; it has since become a fixture of media made by the school&#x27;s alumni. The first use of A113 was in the pilot episode for the short-lived television series &quot;Family Dog&quot; (1993). The pilot episode was a part of the series &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; (1985–1987), which aired February 16, 1987, and was titled &quot;Family Dog&quot;. He used it for the license plate number on a van. 

==Career==

===Initial years===
====Disney and development deals (1978–1984)====
Within two years, Bird accepted a job as an animator at Walt Disney Productions. Bird arrived at the studio in the midst of a transition: much of the studio&#x27;s original creative staff were retiring, leaving the studio to a new generation of artists. What was left of the original staff got along with the newcomers, but Bird clashed with the middlemen in charge. While animating at Disney, he became a part of a small group of animators who worked in a suite of offices inside the original studio called the &quot;Rat&#x27;s Nest&quot;. There, Bird openly criticized the state of the studio, and characterized senior leadership as unwilling to take risk. He felt as though he was standing behind the studio&#x27;s original principles. This volatile attitude prompted his firing by animation administrator Edward Hansen. He left Disney after only two years; he received credits on &quot;The Small One&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot; (1981), and went uncredited on &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; (1985).

Bird was dispirited with the state of the American animation industry, and he considered his departure from Disney as the end of his long-held love of the form. Still, he pulled together funds to make &quot;A Portfolio of Projects&quot;, a demo reel of potential animated projects, ones he felt the medium was capable of. Bird was hopeful of receiving financial backing from other studios, but ended up frustrated by Hollywood&#x27;s development system: &quot;for every good project I&#x27;ve made, I&#x27;ve got equally good projects that are sitting [un-produced by] various studios,&quot; he said in 2018. He relocated to the Bay Area, eager to become a part of its burgeoning film scene, which birthed films like &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; and &quot;The Black Stallion&quot;. He tried for several years to adapt Will Eisner&#x27;s comic book &quot;The Spirit&quot; to feature animation, but studios declined, unwilling to take a risk given Disney&#x27;s dominance. He briefly attempted a computer-animated film at Lucasfilm with Edwin Catmull, presaging his later work with Pixar. &quot;He had all these ideas for making animated movies, but he didn&#x27;t have a technical bone in his body and he didn&#x27;t have any tolerance that you would need to have at the time to put up with some of the awfulness of the early technology,&quot; said Alvy Ray Smith. Bird&#x27;s next credit was as an animator on the dark animated drama &quot;The Plague Dogs&quot; (1982); he was also fired by the film&#x27;s director, Martin Rosen, during its production.

====Work with Steven Spielberg (1985–1989)====
One piece from his test reel, &quot;Family Dog&quot;, attracted the attention of director Steven Spielberg. &quot;Family Dog&quot; centered on a pet&#x27;s perspective of his dysfunctional suburban family, and its original pencil test featured designs by Bird&#x27;s classmate Tim Burton. Bird had hoped to develop the concept into theatrical shorts, like those from the golden age of American animation, but the market simply no longer existed. Instead, Bird moved back to Los Angeles and joined Spielberg&#x27;s Amblin Entertainment, and became involved with his television program &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, an anthology series which debuted in 1985. He co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Main Attraction&quot;, the show&#x27;s second episode, with Mick Garris. Spielberg enjoyed the script, and invited Bird to pitch other ideas. Bird storyboarded another &quot;Family Dog&quot; segment, which was decided to be adapted into an episode of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. The episode, which aired in 1987, was a ratings success. The experience was exciting for Bird; &quot;Not only was Steven one of my favorite filmmakers, but he was powerful enough to clear space that allowed us creative freedom,&quot; he later remarked. &quot;Family Dog&quot; was later spun-off into its own half-hour sitcom, against Bird&#x27;s urging and without his involvement, as he felt the idea would not work. He was also perturbed to see Burton&#x27;s role in designing the characters overshadow his deeper contributions to the concept.

He was later brought on to co-write the screenplay for &quot;Batteries Not Included&quot; (1987), a comic sci-fi film that stemmed from an &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; outline. The film opened in fourth place domestically, and was overall a box office hit, generating $65.1 million on its $25 million budget. Bird also helped with &quot;Captain EO&quot;, a 3-D short film starring Michael Jackson viewed at Disney theme parks. These successes brought Bird more opportunity, but he continued to spend many years in development hell with studios. He grew irritated with notes from middle management: executives he felt &quot;would analyze your work and dictate everything you&#x27;d need to do to make it &#x27;more pleasing to an audience&#x27;—and in the process would only make stories smaller and more like everything else,&quot; he complained. In his personal life, he wed Elizabeth Canney, an editor on &quot;Batteries Not Included&quot;. In 1989, Bird&#x27;s sister Susan, with whom he was very close, was killed by her estranged husband in a murder-suicide. The event was traumatic for Bird; he felt emotionally &quot;kind of gone in that period. I don&#x27;t really have a lot of memories from it.&quot; He had enough funds to support himself for a time, so he simply rested: &quot;I just kind of didn&#x27;t do anything,&quot; he confessed.

===Career moves===
====Work on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (1989–1996)====
Bird&#x27;s cinematic sense of visual storytelling with &quot;Family Dog&quot; was uncommon in television animation to that point, mainly due to budgetary restrictions. Most television productions retained rudimentary cinematography, with frequent abuse of standard close-ups, medium angles, and establishing shots to move the story along. In contrast, Bird favored using more filmic techniques, utilizing extreme angles, long panning shots, quick camera cuts, pushed perspective, and so on. Bird&#x27;s work on &quot;Family Dog&quot; caught the eye of producers James L. Brooks and Sam Simon, who with Matt Groening were developing &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the first prime time animated sitcom in decades for Fox. In 1989, he was invited to join Klasky Csupo (and later Film Roman), where he served as &quot;executive consultant&quot; for the show. The role required Bird oversee the script-to-animation pipeline 2–3 days per week; the first episode produced on which Bird received credit (save for the reworked cut of the pilot episode &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;) was &quot;There&#x27;s No Disgrace Like Home&quot;.

Bird worked on the show for its first eight seasons (with his final credited episode being &quot;Treehouse of Horror VIII&quot; (1997), the second episode of season nine to be produced), and directed the episodes &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot; (1990) and &quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot; (1992). He also designed the character Sideshow Bob, who made his speaking debut in the former episode. In his role, Bird pushed the show&#x27;s artists to visualize episodes as miniature films, taking inspiration from the work of Stanley Kubrick and Orson Welles. In the 1990s, he also contributed to other episodic animated sitcoms like &quot;The Critic&quot; and the first season of &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, both of which took cues from this established template. Bird called his work at &quot;The Simpsons&quot; a &quot;golden opportunity,&quot; recognizing that the material was more to his sensibility than the work he had done for Disney. On a personal level, the job was deeply fulfilling; he attended weekly read-throughs which he found delightful, and he considered the gig the only bright spot in the years following his sister&#x27;s passing. The show&#x27;s crew hoped to get Bird to direct its later 2007 film adaptation, but he was too busy on &quot;Ratatouille&quot; which came out the same year.

====&quot;The Iron Giant&quot; (1997–2000)====

Animation had a commercial and creative renaissance in the U.S. during the 1990s, with Hollywood studios eager to capitalize on the success of Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994). Bird continued to shop around film ideas to studios throughout the decade, but grew frustrated with his lack of progress in his dream of directing a feature. He was momentarily signed to direct a live-action comedy, &quot;Brothers in Crime&quot;, at New Line Cinema, but it did not pan out. In addition, his growing family gave rise to other concerns. &quot;I had anxiety about devoting my energy to work that was meaningful and spending time with my family, which was also meaningful to me. If I did one, would I fail at the other?&quot; he worried. He poured these themes into a screenplay for &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, which he pitched to studios beginning in 1992. He also developed an original sci-fi feature titled &quot;Ray Gunn&quot;, with a script co-written by Matthew Robbins. Its futuristic story centered on a private detective in an Art Deco world of humans and aliens. Bird signed a production deal with Turner Feature Animation in January 1995, but the studio felt &quot;Ray Gunn&quot; would be too intense for its target demographic of young children. The following year, Turner merged with Time Warner, which contained the last three months of Bird&#x27;s contract.

Warner executives set up a meeting, and made it clear they had no interest in &quot;Ray Gunn&quot;. Instead, they offered Bird several in-development projects, including a musical version of poet Ted Hughes&#x27; book &quot;The Iron Man&quot;, first envisioned by rocker Pete Townshend. Bird read the novel and felt &quot;enchanted&quot; by it; he felt drawn to Hughes&#x27; rationale for writing the story, which was to comfort his children after the death of his wife, Sylvia Plath. Bird connected with its themes, relating it to his sister&#x27;s passing from gun violence. He significantly revised the entire story to center on a central question: &quot;What if a gun had a soul?&quot; Warner leadership was sold and Bird signed the contract to direct &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; in December 1996. Bird penned the screenplay with Tim McCanlies, which centers on a young boy named Hogarth Hughes, who discovers and befriends a giant alien robot during the Cold War in 1957.

He was quickly faced with assembling a team with little time to spare; most big-budget animated films of the era were workshopped for years, whereas Bird only had two. Adding to the pressure was Bird&#x27;s frequent disagreements with the film&#x27;s co-producer, Allison Abbate. In a trade-off, the crew received significant creative freedom to make the film they wanted to make, though Bird occasionally fielded suggestions from executives to make the film more merchandisable or kid-friendly. The film scored highly on test screenings, but Warner neglected to secure prominent promotion for the movie as they were promoting &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; instead. &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; opened in August 1999 to rave reviews from critics, but very low ticket sales; theater owners discarded the picture after only a few weeks. Altogether, the movie grossed $31.3 million worldwide against its $50 million budget, which was considered a significant loss for Warner. Upon its arrival on home video, the film took on a cult following. Bird was disappointed by the failure of &quot;Giant&quot;; he visited multiple cineplexes only to view the film in empty auditoriums. Afterwards, he was briefly attached to direct a &quot;Curious George&quot; adaptation for Universal, but he instead set his sights toward another animation studio: Pixar.

===Path to Pixar and beyond===
====&quot;The Incredibles&quot; and &quot;Ratatouille&quot; (2000–2008)====
In the late 1990s, Bird reconnected with old friend John Lasseter, who went on to work for Pixar, the computer hardware maker that had recently moved into animation. The company released the first fully computer-animated feature film, &quot;Toy Story&quot;, in 1995. Bird was stunned by the film, and in 1997, the two began to negotiate Bird joining Pixar. In March 2000, Bird went to Pixar&#x27;s Emeryville, California, campus and pitched his ideas, including &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, to Lasseter. The studio announced a multi-film contract with Bird in May of that year, making Bird the first outside voice for the studio, which previously required talent to rise through the ranks. He was excited to return to the Bay Area, where he had lived intermittently two decades prior. He purchased a home in Tiburon, across the bay from Pixar&#x27;s Emeryville headquarters. He grew comforted by the &quot;creative and supportive&quot; atmosphere at Pixar, unlike many of the L.A. studios he had worked for; he convinced a core team to join him up north, including artists Tony Fucile, Teddy Newton, and Lou Romano, all of whom had contributed development artwork for &quot;The Incredibles&quot; for much of the past decade.

Bird&#x27;s first film, &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, follows Bob (Craig T. Nelson) and Helen Parr (Holly Hunter), a couple of superheroes, known as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, who hide their powers in accordance with a government mandate, and attempt to live a quiet suburban life with their three children. Bob&#x27;s desire to help people draws the entire family into a confrontation with a vengeful fan-turned-foe, Syndrome. Bird also provides the voice of costume designer Edna Mode. As an inside joke, the character Syndrome was based on Bird&#x27;s likeness (as was Mr. Incredible) and according to him, he did not realize the joke until the movie was too far into production to have it changed. The animation team was tasked with creating computer animation&#x27;s first all-human cast, which required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Michael Giacchino composed the film&#x27;s orchestral score, marking the first in a series of collaboration between the two men. &quot;The Incredibles&quot; was Bird&#x27;s first global critical and box-office smash, grossing $631.4 million, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2004. Bird won his first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, and his screenplay was nominated for Best Original Screenplay. It was the first animated film to win the prestigious Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.

Bird&#x27;s next project was &quot;Ratatouille&quot; (2007), which follows a rat named Remy, who dreams of becoming a chef and tries to achieve his goal by forming an alliance with a Parisian restaurant&#x27;s garbage boy. The film was developed by Jan Pinkava, who worked on the concept for many years. By the time the project was slated to enter the animation process, Pixar leadership became concerned it was not ready. Bird was hired on in July 2005 to assess the mistakes and turn the project around in a short time. He disliked having to take over Pinkva&#x27;s passion project: &quot;It was a rough position to be in because I always come down on the side of the creator,&quot; he later said. However, he was also in position with Pixar as a member of their &quot;brain trust&quot;—a group of individuals who critique and help each other—so he felt the role came naturally. When Bird took over, much of the design work had been completed, but Bird wrote an entirely new script that eschewed much of its original dialogue. Giacchino returned to compose the Paris-inspired music for the film. Upon release, &quot;Ratatouille&quot; was another huge hit for Pixar; the film grossed $623.7 million and earned critical acclaim. It won the Best Animated Feature award at the 2008 Golden Globes; it was also nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Original Screenplay and Best Animated Feature, which it won.

====Move to live-action: &quot;Ghost Protocol&quot; and &quot;Tomorrowland&quot; (2008–2015)====
Midway through the aughts, Bird was attached to direct an adaption of James Dalessandro&#x27;s novel, &quot;1906&quot;, which chronicles the tumultuous earthquake that struck San Francisco a century prior. Due to the size and scale of such a project, three studios were to finance its making—Pixar, Disney, and Warner Bros.—but the project stalled. He paused when Pixar management asked he take over &quot;Ratatouille&quot;, and returned afterward. He attempted to re-write &quot;1906&quot; to work within the confines of a feature&#x27;s length, but struggled. Instead, Bird helmed &quot;&quot;, an installment of the action spy series &quot;&quot;, starring Tom Cruise.

Bird&#x27;s foray into live-action filmmaking after a major career in animation had little precedent, according to critics. Cruise had been impressed by the style and storytelling of &quot;Incredibles&quot;, and urged Bird to contact him should he venture into the live-action sphere. The idea of combining the commercial aspects of a franchise—this was the third &quot;Mission&quot; sequel—and more artistic tones challenged Bird, who signed on to direct in May 2010. In the picture, Cruise reprises his role of Impossible Missions Force agent Ethan Hunt, who with his team race against time to find a nuclear extremist who gains access to Russian nuclear launch codes. &quot;Ghost Protocol&quot; was shot on location partially in Dubai, and includes a memorable scene when Cruise scales the newly erected Burj Khalifa. Upon release in December 2011, it became the highest-grossing film in the series up to that point, with $694 million worldwide. It was the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2011 as well as the second-highest-grossing film starring Cruise.

Though he was asked to direct &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;, Bird turned down the opportunity to focus on his new project: the sci-fi film &quot;Tomorrowland&quot;, named for the futuristic themed land found at Disney theme parks. Bird co-wrote the screenplay with Damon Lindelof. In the film, a disillusioned genius inventor (George Clooney) and a teenage science enthusiast (Britt Robertson) embark to an intriguing alternate dimension known as &quot;Tomorrowland,&quot; where their actions directly affect their own world. The film ended up being a box-office bomb, losing Disney $120–150 million, and attracting a mixed critical response.

===Latest work===
====&quot;Incredibles 2&quot; (2015–2018)====
Over the years, Bird mentioned the possibility of an &quot;Incredibles&quot; sequel in interviews. An official sequel was announced in 2014. Bird began writing its screenplay in earnest the next year; he attempted to distinguish the script from the breadth of superhero-related content released since the first film, focusing on the family dynamic rather than the superhero genre. The story follows the Incredibles as they try to restore the public&#x27;s trust in superheroes while balancing their family life, only to combat a new foe who seeks to turn the populace against all superheroes. Though scheduled for release on June 21, 2019, the film was completed on an accelerated production schedule, as it was farther ahead in production than &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;, which required more development and was later released on that day; the two simply swapped years, with &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; debuting in theaters on June 15, 2018. Giacchino returned to compose the score.

&quot;Incredibles 2&quot; made $182.7 million in its opening weekend, setting the record for best debut for an animated film, and grossed over $1.2 billion worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing animated film at the time, the highest-grossing Pixar film, and the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year. &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; was named by the National Board of Review as the Best Animated Film of 2018. The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 76th Golden Globe Awards and 91st Academy Awards, but lost both awards to &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot;.

====Recent events (2019–present)====
Bird has expressed interest in developing an animated Western or horror film. However, Bird returned to revive his long-dormant project &quot;Ray Gunn&quot; at Warner Bros. Feature Animation before he was approached by John Lasseter to produce it for Skydance. In 2022, it was announced that Bird had signed a deal with Skydance the previous year and reassembled frequent collaborators Michael Giacchino, Teddy Newton, Tony Fucile, Darren T. Holmes, and Jeffrey Lynch for the film. According to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, the presumptive production costs were estimated to be $150 million. This resulted in Skydance leaving its distributor deal with Apple TV+, in which they later partnered with Netflix.

In August 2024, at the D23 Expo, Pixar chief creative officer Pete Docter announced &quot;Incredibles 3&quot; was in development, with Bird returning. Following the announcement of Pixar’s &quot;Incredibles 3&quot;, one news outlet reported that Bird’s &quot;Ray Gunn&quot; for Skydance Animation was still being made as well and expected for release in 2026, though there has not been any official confirmation from the studio as of the time of said publishing.

==Style and themes==

Bird says he was influenced by dozens of filmmakers, singling out early moviemakers Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, and Harold Lloyd, to mid-twentieth century auteurs like David Lean, Alfred Hitchcock, Walt Disney, and Akira Kurosawa. More contemporary directors like Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Hayao Miyazaki, and the Coen brothers have inspired Bird as well. His passion for the medium was evident even in his college years; friend John Lasseter remembered, &quot;Brad would hang out all night talking about Scorsese and Coppola and how he could do what they did in animation.&quot; Bird himself has observed that his career was &quot;very long, very delayed and full of disappointment,&quot; mainly because he aspired to &quot;lofty&quot; self-set expectations.

He has been characterized as controlling with an exquisite attention to detail. His &quot;demanding, often punishing&quot; direction has prompted some to consider him difficult to work with. Bird is outspoken about the potential of the art of animation, and has asked the public not refer to his films as cartoons. In the audio commentary for the home release of &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, Bird joked he would fight the next person to refer to animated movies as a &quot;genre&quot;, as opposed to an art form.
He has also taken exception to the classification of modern animated fare as solely for children or families; suggesting it discriminatory and belittling. He has expressed a love for hand-drawn animation and lamented its current absence from the industry.

Some critics have suggested that Bird&#x27;s films reflect novelist Ayn Rand&#x27;s Objectivism philosophy, which Bird has vehemently denied, saying that, &quot;Me being the Ayn Rand guy is a lazy piece of criticism.&quot; Critic A.O. Scott originally advanced the idea that the Incredibles suggested a &quot;feverish immersion&quot; in &quot;the philosophy of Ayn Rand,&quot; as the film&#x27;s hero, Bob Parr, complains of society&#x27;s &quot;celebration of mediocrity,&quot; though Scott also noted the film&#x27;s climax, in which Bob and his family learn to better serve society with their talents, would repudiate this idea. Some critics later pointed to Tomorrowland, in which a group of geniuses form a society sequestered from the rest of the world, as reminiscent of Atlas Shrugged and its Galt Gulch enclave. David Sims at the Atlantic has suggested Bird&#x27;s films are instead &quot;stories about the frustrations of unbridled creativity [...] In each film, there&#x27;s an indelible recurring image: the frustrated genius, locked away in a dusty closet, obsessing over the talents he has to hide.&quot;

==Personal life==
Bird and his wife Elizabeth (m. 1988) have three sons: Nicholas, who voiced Squirt in the Pixar film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; and Rusty the bike boy in &quot;The Incredibles&quot;; Michael, who voiced Tony Rydinger in &quot;The Incredibles&quot; and its sequel; and Jack. Bird maintains properties in Tiburon, California, and Los Feliz, California.

* &quot;Curious George&quot;, wrote a draft of the film at one point, but his script was not used in the produced version. 
* &quot;The Simpsons Movie,&quot; the crew from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; including James L. Brooks and Matt Groening were hoping to get Bird to direct, but was too busy with &quot;The Incredibles&quot; and &quot;Ratatouille&quot; at the time. David Silverman, who was also working at Pixar at the time and quit his job after finishing work on &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, became the film&#x27;s director.
* &quot;1906&quot;, a collaborative project from Warner Bros. and Pixar (which could have been their first live-action project), in association with Walt Disney Pictures, where Bird would have directed. Disney and Pixar left the project in 2012 in development limbo at Warner Bros. due to delays in the film&#x27;s several planned releases, several rejected scripts were not picked up, and going over budget ($200 million). However , Bird has expressed interest as to adapt the book as a TV series and the earthquake sequence as a live-action feature film.
* &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;, Bird was on a shortlist of directors to direct the seventh &quot;Star Wars&quot; film. He passed on the project in favor of &quot;Tomorrowland&quot;; &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; was directed by J. J. Abrams.
* &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, Bird was featured on a shortlist of writers when the film was still in development at Columbia Pictures. After Jeff Fowler was chosen to direct, Pat Casey and Josh Miller were picked as writers.
* Untitled musical film, Bird announced in 2019 he was developing an original musical that would include songs by frequent collaborator Michael Giacchino and contain about 20 minutes of animation.

<text>India Buildings is a commercial building with its principal entrance in Water Street, Liverpool, England. Mainly an office building, it also contains an internal shopping arcade and the entrance to an underground station. It was built between 1924 and 1932, damaged by a bomb in 1941, and later restored to its original condition under the supervision of one of its original architects. The building, its design influenced by the Italian Renaissance and incorporating features of the American Beaux-Arts style, occupies an entire block in the city.

==History==

India Buildings was built between 1924 and 1932. [See construction of Holt Building on Youtube, Pathes Nerves of Steel.] The competition for its design was won in 1923 by Arnold Thornely and Herbert J. Rowse, the assessor being Giles Gilbert Scott. It was built as a speculative venture by the shipping firm of Richard Durning Holt and Alfred Holt and Company (the Blue Funnel Line) partly for its own use, and partly for letting offices to other businesses. It was built by Dove Brothers of Islington, its steelwork being made and erected by Dorman Long of Middlesbrough. The cost of the building was £1.25 million (equivalent to £ in ). The building replaced an older one on the site known as &quot;India Building&quot;, built in the 1830s for George Holt, the father of Alfred. The new building was constructed in two stages, the first stage being alongside the earlier building, and the second stage demolishing and replacing it. The two stages straddled the former Chorley Street. Before the design was approved, Liverpool Corporation stipulated that an arcade of shops should run through the centre of the building on the route of the street, and this was incorporated into the design. The original occupants included Lloyds Bank, a post office, commercial and insurance companies, solicitors, and government offices. Alfred Holt and Company occupied most of the sixth, seventh and eighth floors. Also in the building were a public hall and a constitutional club. India Buildings was badly damaged by bombing in 1941, and was later restored to its original condition under the supervision of Herbert J. Rowse.

The property became involved in one of the UK&#x27;s largest fraud cases when it was used as collateral for large loans made by a company operated by Achilleas Kallakis and Alexander Williams. They had arranged for loans to be made in excess of the value of the buildings. This money was used to finance an expensive lifestyle including a helicopter and a plane.

India buildings was sold to an Irish company called Green Property in 2009 who still owned it in January 2013 when the former owners, Kallakis and Williams were jailed for fraud.

In August 2017 it was announced that British multinational financial services company, Legal &amp; General had bought India Buildings. HMRC will lease ten floors of the building to house a new Regional Centre. Around 3,500 HMRC staff were expected to start moving into the building when renovation work was completed in 2019. The plans were delayed when 400 tonnes of asbestos were discovered during the works. A new contractor was bought in to carry out the redevelopment work in September 2019 with the new tenants hoping to move in during 2020. The package of work being carried out includes repairing and cleaning the façade, removing more than 50% of office ceilings, re-lining the cast iron drainage system, refurbishing ornate windows and replacing the existing 8 lifts and the addition of 5 new lifts. On December 6, 2020, HMRC announced that they will move in on May 21, 2021, starting from floors 3–6 with floors 1-2 opening in the summer. In March 2021, due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and the government advice on home working, the May 2021 opening of floors 3-6 was cancelled. A new move date is provisionally set for &quot;summer 2021&quot; which will likely see staff from Regian House move in first as is tradition. St Johns House in Bootle will continue to operate until 2022.

==Architecture==
===Exterior===
The building occupies a whole block, and is surrounded by Water Street, Brunswick Street, Fenwick Street, and Drury Lane. It has nine storeys, a mezzanine, a basement and a sub-basement. The building is constructed on a steel frame and is clad in Portland stone. It is roofed in green Lombardic tiles. The main entrance is on Water Street, this front having 13 bays. The entrance itself consists of three tall arches that are flanked by four bronze lamps, made by the Bromsgrove Guild, their design being based on those at the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence. Over the entrance is an ornamental balcony. At the basement level are four decorative shop fronts, and to the right of these is an entrance to the James Street underground station. The Brunswick Street front is similar, except that its entrance has one arch rather than three. The Fenwick Street front and the Drury Lane front have 15 and 14 bays respectively.

===Sculpture===

All the sculpture on the exterior of the building is by Edmund C. Thompson. The keystones in the arches over the doorways and above some of the windows are carved with cherubs. Rather than all being identical, their designs are slightly varied. A frieze runs around the building just below the level of the top floor windows. On both the Water Street and the Brunswick Street fronts and incorporated in the frieze are crests, each of which is carved with a figure of Neptune kneeling in a scallop shell, and two reclining Tritons, reflecting the building&#x27;s maritime connections.

===Interior===
A shopping arcade runs through the centre of the building, with offices on all floors. The entrances in Water Street and Brunswick Street lead into foyers. Each foyer has three painted and coffered saucer domes in the ceiling, supported by fluted Ionic columns in Travertine marble. There are doors to two lifts on each side. The shopping arcade has Travertine walls and floors, and a coffered barrel-vaulted ceiling with pendant lights. Along the sides of the arcade are shops with decorative bronze fronts. Elsewhere on the ground floor are larger areas originally occupied by the bank, the Post Office and the public hall. The upper floors contain offices, some of which have retained their original layout, while others have been altered. There is a war memorial dedicated to 15 members of staff from Alfred Holt Blue Funnel who died during World War 1.
Public access to the arcade was closed as part of the deal to move in 3,500 HMRC staff, with HMRC citing security reasons for the proposed decision.

==Appraisal==

India Buildings was designated as a Grade II listed building on 14 March 1975. Following a campaign by the Twentieth Century Society, its designation was raised to Grade II* on 5 November 2013. One of the reasons given for this elevation in status is its transatlantic influence, reflecting Liverpool&#x27;s historic links with the United States, stating that it &quot;emulates the most impressive early 20th-century commercial buildings of the US&quot;, particularly those in New York. Other reasons include its architectural interest, including influences from the Italian Renaissance and the American Beaux-Arts movement, and the eminence of its architects. Also noted are its planning interest, in that it follows the United States grid system of town planning, the high quality of its internal finishes, its degree of survival with its major elements having been retained, and its group value with the nearby listed buildings.

<text>Modern Air Transport, Inc. (originally Modern Air Transport/MAT, subsequently Modern Air) was a United States-based supplemental air carrier founded in 1946. At different stages in its history its operations were based in Newark and Trenton, New Jersey, Baltimore, and Miami. In addition to Miami, New York used to be a base for Modern Air. In 1968, the airline established an overseas base at Berlin Tegel Airport in what used to be West Berlin prior to German reunification. Between 1968 and 1974, operations increasingly focused on Berlin Tegel. Modern Air ceased trading in 1975.

==History==

===The early years===
Although Modern Air was conceived in 1946 in Hempstead, Long Island, it was incorporated as Modern Air Transport, Inc. on 3 January 1947. Later that year, Modern Air commenced commercial operations from Miami International Airport with war-surplus Curtiss C-46 piston-engined aircraft.

In 1950, the airline&#x27;s operational base moved to New York&#x27;s Newark Airport. Following another move to Trenton–Mercer Airport, New Jersey shortly afterwards, the airline was bought by C-46 type-rated pilot, John B. Becker, in 1951.

In 1956, Modern Air became the first US &quot;non-sked&quot; to be granted rights for up to 10 regularly scheduled round trip flights per month by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). Modern&#x27;s first scheduled service departed Pittsburgh International Airport for Miami on 15 July 1956. The route was flown on week-ends at a one-way fare of $38.05 or, alternatively, a $60.75 16-day excursion fare.

From 1958, Gulf American Land Corporation, a Florida-based property developer, began contracting business to Modern Air. Gulf American Land, which had been formed to develop a tract of land in Cape Coral, Florida near Fort Myers into residential real estate, contracted the airline to fly hundreds of prospective customers for its real estate developments every week into Miami from the US Northeast and Midwest. At Miami, Gulf American Land&#x27;s prospective customers transferred between Modern Air&#x27;s Curtiss C-46s and the Douglas DC-3s of Gulf American Land&#x27;s own airline, Gulf American Airlines, which operated a shuttle service linking Miami to Fort Myers across the Everglades. Together with complimentary bus transfers between Gulf American Land&#x27;s Golden Gate Estates development in Cape Coral and Fort Myers&#x27; Page Field airport, these flights formed part of Gulf American Land&#x27;s free sales pitch and were free for prospective customers, who were also served a free meal on board the aircraft on each leg of their journey.

Modern Air&#x27;s charter flights on behalf of Gulf American Land into Miami eventually accounted for 25% of the airline&#x27;s total business.

Five ex-Capital Airlines Lockheed L-049 Constellation piston airliners were bought in 1961 to replace the C-46s. These joined the fleet during summer 1962. Only two of these entered actual airline service; the remaining three were used for spares.

The grant of an interim certificate by the CAB in October 1962 to operate domestic military contract flights, intrastate and overseas charters from 1 April 1963 was followed by further fleet expansion, including the temporary lease of a pair of Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellations and the purchase of an L-749A in 1964.

The acquisition of five Douglas DC-7Cs in April/May 1965 resulted in retirement of the Constellation fleet due to the former&#x27;s superior range. The same year also saw the acquisition of five DC-3s from Gulf American Airlines (for whom they continued to fly).

On 30 May 1966, the CAB authorised Modern Air to operate charter flights from the US to Canada and Mexico.

Further fleet expansion ensued in August 1966 with the acquisition of five Martin 2-0-2s from TWA and Allegheny Airlines, respectively. Also in 1966, the CAB broadened Modern&#x27;s civilian and military charter authority, including granting the airline permission for limited scheduled air services. This enabled it to temporarily replace scheduled air services normally provided by major US certified route carriers during labour disputes resulting in strike action at the certified carriers and to obtain temporary CAB authority for scheduled flights from New York and Washington, D.C. to Miami.

Total revenues and profits for 1966 exceeded $4 million and $30,000, respectively.

===The GAC era===
Following Gulf American Land&#x27;s purchase of Modern Air&#x27;s entire stock from John Becker for $807,500 in May/June 1966, the airline became a wholly owned subsidiary of Gulf American Land Corporation on 29 June 1966. Concentration of most of Modern Air&#x27;s business activities in Florida and the change in ownership resulted in consolidation of the airline&#x27;s operations at Miami International Airport, the transfer of the DC-3s and Martinliners to sister airline Gulf American Airlines and the sale of the company&#x27;s last remaining Constellation the following year. Gulf American Land Corporation&#x27;s stockholder meeting in December 1966 resolved to shorten its name to Gulf American Corporation (GAC) to reflect its increasing diversification and approved an employee stock purchase plan worth $600,000.

Although Modern Air and Gulf American Airlines shared the same owners, who attempted to merge both airlines under the Modern Air name, both airlines largely remained organisationally independent of each other, with former Modern Air pilots continuing to fly the DC-7s on long-haul charters and their former Gulf American Airlines colleagues flying the smaller piston types (the DC-3s and Martinliners) into Fort Myers.

Gulf American&#x27;s takeover by the General Acceptance Corporation in 1969 resulted in a major reorganisation of GAC&#x27;s business units. This saw Gulf American Corporation and Modern Air become wholly owned subsidiaries of newly created holding company GAC Corporation, with all real estate related business activities being absorbed into newly formed GAC Corp subsidiary GAC Properties. These changes resulted in former GAC treasurer James M. Browne being appointed Modern Air president.

====Transition to an all-jet fleet====
The award of a five-year licence by the CAB in October 1966 to engage in cargo and passenger charter operations including all-expense tour charters between the US and points in Canada and Mexico enhanced Modern Air&#x27;s new status as a permanently certificated US supplemental carrier. Following the award of these new foreign charter rights, the airline concluded a US$17.5 million purchase agreement with American Airlines to acquire five of the latter&#x27;s Convair CV-990A jetliners between January 1967 and February/March 1968, in anticipation of major growth for low-cost overseas travel by US tour groups. The first two examples sported a new natural metal &quot;Silver Palace&quot; livery, which replaced the &quot;Modern Air Transport/MAT&quot; fuselage titles used in previous schemes with &quot;Modern Air&quot; titles. Modern Air&#x27;s first jet, Convair CV-990A N5609, was handed over to the airline in February 1967. It was based in Miami and contracted by GAC to operate charter flights for prospective investors in its real estate development projects in Florida and Arizona. Modern received its second CV-990A, N5605, the following month. This aircraft was repainted in the contemporary Air France livery, in preparation of a short-term wet lease beginning in April that enabled the French national airline to introduce high-capacity jet aircraft on four daily round trips between Paris Orly and London Heathrow while awaiting delivery of its own Boeing 727-200s. Modern Air&#x27;s CV-990s were configured in a spacious 139-seat, single-class seating arrangement. The aircraft&#x27;s standard flight deck crew complement comprised three, including a flight engineer holding a mechanic&#x27;s and inspector&#x27;s licence. On flights involving long overwater sectors a navigator supplied by a third party joined the other three flight deck crew.

The slow and difficult integration of the old Gulf American Airlines and pre-GAC Modern Air workforces into a combined post-merger workforce encountered a further obstacle when Modern Air hired former military pilots to crew its new jets. This resulted in the two separate, unionised legacy pilot groups, as well as another unionised group representing flight attendants across both airlines and pre-GAC Modern Air flight engineers being joined by another, non-unionised group. In addition, the airline&#x27;s problems were compounded by reliability issues and high costs. It was at this point that GAC called on the services of experienced senior airline manager and aviation consultant, Morten Sternoff Beyer, to head up the airline and manage the integration as well as turn around its fortunes.

In addition to its new CV-990 jets, Modern Air also leased a pair of Boeing 727-100Cs from Executive Jet Aviation in September 1967 as DC-7 replacements and to enable eliminating the intermediate stop in Miami to change flights as the 727&#x27;s short-field capability permitted direct flights into Fort Myers&#x27; original airport at Page Field from GAC&#x27;s prospective customers&#x27; points of origin with a viable payload. It also began negotiations with Boeing for the purchase of a single 727-200 and two 727-100s direct from the manufacturer. Following a labour dispute with its pilots, new Executive Vice President Morten S. Beyer (who had arranged the 727 lease with Executive Jet) returned the leased Boeing jets, did not finalise its order with Boeing for three new-built 727s and began grounding all piston airliners permanently from the end of 1967. The latter move saw the DC-3s and DC-7s put into storage at Fort Myers while the Martinliners were stored at Cape May, New Jersey. It also resulted in 100 job losses among flight crew.

Modern Air carried more than 360,000 passengers in 1967 while revenues increased to over $9.5 million. However, costs associated with the transition to a jet fleet and excess capacity resulted in a $3 million loss (a $2.98 million operating loss and a $3.6 million net loss, respectively).

Disposal of the stored piston airliners proved more difficult and took longer than anticipated, especially of the four DC-7s. While two were partially cannibalised for spare parts, the remaining pair were put up for sale for $60,000 apiece. However, when these were eventually sold in 1969 to Miami-based Interair Parts for only $8,000, Modern Air was well into the jet era.

====Diversification into new business areas and overseas expansion====
The agreement with Air France for the temporary lease of one aircraft beginning in April 1967 provided additional work for the new jets.

Further work to increase the growing jet fleet&#x27;s utilisation was secured when the Federal Government awarded Modern Air a contract to carry military personnel between camps in the US. However, this was insufficient to justify continuing expansion of the fleet and workforce. By the time Modern&#x27;s third 990 was delivered, it experienced financial difficulties. This resulted in layoffs and management changes. As Modern Air was liable to pay substantial cancellation fees and would have forfeited the deposits that it had already paid for the outstanding aircraft deliveries if it terminated its purchase agreement with American Airlines unilaterally, Modern opted to begin looking for additional business opportunities to keep the expanding fleet fully employed.

As a result of a narrow Soviet interpretation of the Potsdam Agreement between the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, access to West Berlin by air was restricted to three high and -wide air corridors, for exclusive use by aircraft under the control of individuals and (where applicable) organisations from the United States, the United Kingdom and France, the three Western victorious powers of World War II. These three air routes existed from February 1946 until German reunification in October 1990. They linked the exclave of West Berlin with West Germany and passed over the territory of communist East Germany. The airspace they encompassed was jointly administered from the Berlin Air Safety Center in West Berlin by representatives of the governments of all four victorious powers that had defeated Germany in World War II.

The massive post-war reconstruction effort in West Berlin, the city&#x27;s rapid economic recovery following the end of the Berlin Blockade and the beginning of the German economic miracle resulted in rapidly rising living standards and disposable incomes of the local population. Together with the lifting of travel restrictions imposed by other countries on West German passport holders in the immediate aftermath of World War II and West Berlin&#x27;s location inside East Germany this in turn drove the local population&#x27;s rapidly rising demand for overseas travel and the growing popularity of package tours involving air travel. As West Berlin was out of bounds for German airlines, local tour operators chartered aircraft of the British independent airlines and US supplemental carriers that began flying from the city&#x27;s Tempelhof and Tegel airports in the early 1960s.

Prior to Modern Air&#x27;s arrival in Berlin, the biggest among these was US supplemental Saturn Airways. Saturn opened a base at West Berlin&#x27;s Tempelhof Airport in 1964. Its Berlin-based fleet comprised Douglas DC-6 and DC-7 piston airliners, which were chartered by Flug-Union Berlin for its flying programme to several airports serving popular holiday resorts, chiefly in the Mediterranean. Flug-Union Berlin was the first tour operator with a West Berlin flying programme and acted at the time as the city&#x27;s consolidator for the big West German tour companies Neckermann (then part of the eponymous department store chain) and Touristik Union International (TUI), the travel arm of the Federal German Railway. Local rival tour operator Berliner Flugring, which had begun as a consortium of 70 local travel agents arranging inclusive tour (IT) flights from West Berlin to holiday resorts in Europe, also chartered Saturn&#x27;s (as well as a number of different British independent airlines&#x27;) aircraft for its flying programme. When some British independent rivals in West Berlin began replacing their piston and turboprop planes with jets such as the BAC One-Eleven and de Havilland Comet 4 from the mid-1960s, Saturn&#x27;s piston airliners became obsolete. To remain competitive and to defend its market leadership in the West Berlin air charter market, it needed to re-equip with jets as well. Although it had already ordered the Douglas DC-8 Super 60 series and would operate the Boeing 707 as well, these were long-range aircraft unsuited to taking off from and landing on Tempelhof&#x27;s short runways (as well as short runways at some overseas destination airports) with a viable payload. They were also unsuitable for the short- and medium-haul flights that dominated West Berlin charter flying and had too many seats to fill for most of the routes served by West Berlin charter aircraft. To match the superior performance of British competitors&#x27; jets and to exceed their passenger comfort, Saturn had no option but to acquire a dedicated fleet of short-/medium-haul jets, such as the Boeing 727, Boeing 737 or Douglas DC-9 for its West Berlin operation. However, following a change in Saturn&#x27;s ownership, the new management decided to close the airline&#x27;s Tempelhof base in 1967.

Although Saturn&#x27;s contemporary British competitors in the West Berlin charter market moved quickly to fill the void left by the US supplemental&#x27;s departure from Berlin, Saturn&#x27;s former Tempelhof station manager, John D. MacDonald, was keen to re-establish a local US charter presence. This resulted in John MacDonald contacting rival supplemental Modern Air, who were looking for additional work for their recently acquired CV-990 jets, and using his local contacts with Flug-Union Berlin and Berliner Flugring to assist Modern with securing sufficient work to open a base in Berlin.

Ensuing successful negotiations with Berliner Flugring to operate a $3.5 million, West Berlin based programme, as well as a similar $2 million programme with Flug-Union Berlin and a $1.5 million, seven months wet lease of up to two aircraft to Canadian charter carrier Nordair, enabled Modern Air to profitably utilise its spare aircraft capacity.

By the time Modern Air assumed Berliner Flugring&#x27;s flying programme, the latter had become the city&#x27;s foremost package tour operator. The two West Berlin charter flight programmes the American supplemental operated under contract to Berliner Flugring and Flug-Union Berlin accounted for approximately 500 round trips during its first summer season in West Berlin. The decision to supply whole-plane charter airline seats to both of the city&#x27;s leading package tour operators also enabled Modern Air to take advantage of rules permitting regular charter flights from West Berlin all year round. This was more liberal than in the US, where restrictive rules governed non-scheduled air services as part of an effort by the CAB to protect the country&#x27;s scheduled airlines.

To enable Modern Air to operate its new CV-990s into Fort Myers Page Field with a viable payload, GAC agreed to co-finance the lengthening of one of its runways, which until then had been limited to revenue flights with jet aircraft no bigger than the Boeing 727-100. As a result, the airline operated its first CV-990 revenue flight, which was chartered by GAC Properties to carry 134 prospective land buyers from Sioux City, Iowa into Page Field on 1 February 1968 (before proceeding to Kansas City, Missouri and Lincoln, Nebraska to return with another load of prospective buyers to Fort Myers Page Field).

By 1968, Modern Air operated an all-jet fleet comprising five CV-990s. The acquisition of a further two CV-990s from American Airlines at the end of 1970 expanded Modern&#x27;s 990 fleet to seven aircraft. This allowed it to vie with Swissair for the title of the world&#x27;s largest Convair 990 operator. The final enlargement of Modern&#x27;s CV-990 fleet occurred in 1972, when it acquired former Brazilian flag carrier VARIG&#x27;s final two examples. This brought the airline&#x27;s 990 fleet to nine, briefly allowing it to assume the title of the world&#x27;s largest Convair 990 operator. The expanded all-jet fleet facilitated the introduction of regular tour group charters carrying American tourists from the Miami and New York areas to popular holiday resorts in North and Central America, as well as the launch in May 1968 of a Canadian-based Caribbean and transatlantic charter programme, in addition to operating a large German charter programme. Eventually, all three US-based Modern Air CV-990s were allocated to the Canadian transatlantic charter programme, which Modern Air operated for Nordair under a wet lease arrangement (until 1970, when the Government of Canada revoked Nordair&#x27;s permission to subcontract transatlantic flights to foreign airlines). At least two of these aircraft wore the full Nordair livery.

In 1968, Modern Air increased revenues by 20% to over $11.5 million (compared with 1967), while significantly reducing losses (a $1.3 million operating loss and a $2.4 million net loss, respectively).

Modern Air&#x27;s expanding jet operations also led to further development in the airline&#x27;s maintenance capabilities, as a result of the takeover of aircraft maintenance and conversion specialist, American Airmotive. This included one of Miami International Airport&#x27;s biggest aircraft hangars and an aircraft maintenance base. Together with the earlier acquisition of the entire CV-990 spares inventory and engine tooling equipment, it helped the airline reduce its maintenance costs and improve the reliability of its fleet by enabling it to perform most maintenance tasks in-house.

=====Establishment and growth of West Berlin operation=====
In March 1968, Modern Air stationed two CV-990 jets at West Berlin&#x27;s Tegel Airport. These were the biggest and fastest aircraft based at any Berlin airport at that time. Modern&#x27;s new base employed 120. Apart from the flight deck personnel (who were required to hold US, British or French passports under West Berlin commercial air transport regulations), all were local. The latter included locally based, all-female cabin crew, who were known as &quot;tiger girls&quot; because of their distinctive yellow-and-black striped uniforms.

While all Modern Air commercial flights from and to Berlin principally used Tegel to take advantage of the airport&#x27;s longer runways and the fact that it was not in a built-up area making for easier approaches (compared with nearby Tempelhof), the airline conducted its training for Berlin-based flight deck crews at Tempelhof. The latter was also the designated diversion airport in bad weather in the Tegel area. The establishment of Modern Air&#x27;s Berlin base also enabled it to provide aircraft ground handling, maintenance and catering services to third parties, including Air France and Pan American World Airways (Pan Am).

As Modern Air&#x27;s West Berlin charter permit did not authorise the carriage of cargo, the airline&#x27;s Berlin management decided to utilise the only lightly filled cargo holds of its Tegel-based CV-990s to carry inbound catering and essential spares and tooling, including a spare tyre. The reason for carrying catering destined for passengers booked on return flights all the way from Berlin rather than appointing local suppliers at destination airports was that it worked out cheaper and was deemed more reliable and safer (compared with relying on overseas suppliers with varying quality and hygiene standards and who often plied their trade only seasonally) while the reason for carrying essential spares and tooling on outbound aircraft was to ensure emergency serviceability at destination airports lacking CV-990 spares inventories, given the type&#x27;s narrow operator base (compared with the then ubiquitous Boeing and Douglas types and other popular contemporary aircraft types).

Modern&#x27;s two Berlin-based Convair jets flew to 19 destinations from Tegel Airport during their first summer season, which lasted from May to September. The successful conclusion of Modern&#x27;s first summer season in Berlin saw one aircraft speculatively retained for the winter season to develop a new charter programme to the Canary Islands, a first in the West Berlin market.

Modern Air appointed former Saturn Airways Berlin station manager John D. MacDonald general manager to oversee its European operations from its Tegel base.

Modern Air carried over 135,000 passengers (out of a company-wide total of just under 300,000) during its first year of operations from Tegel.

The successful conclusion of Modern Air&#x27;s first and promising start to its second year in West Berlin resulted in the airline signing a five-year contract with Berliner Flugring worth $20 million (£8.3 million). The contract ran from the beginning of the 1969/70 winter season until the end of the 1974 summer season.

Berliner Flugring began referring to business partner Modern Air&#x27;s CV-990s as Coronados in its marketing. This was the nickname pioneered by Swiss flag carrier Swissair, the type&#x27;s first operator in Europe.

Modern Air&#x27;s five-year contract with Berliner Flugring and an expanded US-based flying programme under contract to parent GAC that saw prospective homeowners flown into Tucson, Arizona from May 1969 to view the new Rio Rico property development near Nogales significantly improved aircraft utilisation.

Also in 1969, Modern Air&#x27;s Tegel-based European operations manager John MacDonald assumed additional responsibilities as the airline&#x27;s vice president. In addition, the airline sold a CV-990 to Spantax (which was replaced with another example acquired from Alaska Airlines in December) and began installing a then new type of light-weight, UK-manufactured &quot;slimline&quot; seat in its 990s. This enabled the addition of two extra rows, without compromising legroom. The resulting increase in capacity to 149 passengers per plane resulted in an up to 20% improvement in seat-mile cost (compared with American&#x27;s original 125-seat, low density configuration) and helped improve the airline&#x27;s financial performance. Modern Air also reduced the CV-990&#x27;s speed limit from Mach .85 to Mach .78. This reduced fuel burn by 30% per hour and had the beneficial side effect of increasing the aircraft&#x27;s range by 20% (by reducing drag), permitting non-stop transatlantic flights from the eastern seaboard of the US to Central Europe, such as Philadelphia to Vienna for example, with a full payload.

While Modern&#x27;s 990s were more expensive to operate than the dedicated short-/medium-haul jets of their British rivals in West Berlin due to higher fuel consumption and had more seats to fill, the airline compensated for these disadvantages with its single type fleet. This resulted in cost savings compared with mixed type fleet rivals. In addition, in the pre-1973 oil crisis era of low fuel prices, the relatively low acquisition costs of these well-maintained, older generation second-hand jets partially compensated for the superior economics of comparable, contemporary new-built, state-of-the-art jet aircraft such as the Boeing 727. Moreover, the 990&#x27;s ability to carry a similar number of passengers as the 727 over greater distances made it more versatile and resulted in greater operational flexibility.

Berliner Flugring&#x27;s ability to avail itself of an aircraft capable of non-stop long-haul missions and offer its package tour customers greater legroom on board Modern Air&#x27;s aircraft than competitors that contracted their flying programmes from West Berlin to various British charter airlines were important differentiators for the American supplemental&#x27;s main business partner. Emphasising in its marketing the superior comfort and speed of Modern&#x27;s 990s, as well as the fact that it was West Berlin&#x27;s only tour operator exclusively using four-engined aircraft to fly its customers on holiday, enabled Berliner Flugring to gain an important competitive advantage over its rivals.

In addition to the city&#x27;s established tour operators such as Berliner Flugring, which provided Modern Air with the bulk of its business out of West Berlin, Modern Air also attracted business from smaller local startups and other operators catering to a more cost-conscious clientele by offering lower rates for midweek and night flying. In addition to smaller local tour companies, the local organisers of VFR flights back home for West Berlin&#x27;s large Turkish migrant population contracted their business to Modern Air to take advantage of lower rates at less popular times. This in turn enabled the airline to generate more business outside the Friday to Sunday peak, with the aim of smoothing peaks and troughs in activity.

The total number of passengers carried company-wide in 1969 rose to just under 330,000 while revenues totalled over $14 million and losses stood at more than $980,000 (operating) and over $1.8 million (net), respectively.

Following the write-off of the ex-Alaska CV-990, as a result of the aircraft&#x27;s involvement in a landing accident in Acapulco in early-August 1970, another example was acquired from American Airlines as a replacement later that year. The total number of passengers carried that year increased marginally to just under 340,000 while there was a slight decrease in total revenues to below $14 million, mainly as a result of the termination of the Nordair wet lease.

As the company&#x27;s flying programme from Berlin gradually expanded, additional aircraft joined the Berlin-based fleet. By 1971, the 25th anniversary of the airline&#x27;s formation, five CV-990s were stationed at Tegel Airport year-round (along with most of the airline&#x27;s employees). This equalled the total number of aircraft Modern Air&#x27;s three main contemporary competitors in the West Berlin air charter market, the UK independent airlines Laker Airways, Dan-Air and Channel Airways, stationed at Tegel Airport, making the US supplemental the city&#x27;s leading charter airline at the time. The decision to base most of its aircraft away from the US was taken in response to the disappointing financial performance of US-based operations. This contrasted with good financial results achieved by the growing operation in Berlin, which had effectively subsidised the shrinking US operation for a number of years. The additional Berlin-based aircraft and personnel also enabled Modern Air to supplement its regular charter programme from Berlin with one-off luxury charters to far-flung, exotic destinations, such as Bangkok, Colombo, Hong Kong, Johannesburg, Karachi and Mauritius. To maximise the CV-990&#x27;s range, as well as to provide an enhanced level of passenger comfort, these flights had their usual Modern Air charter airline seats replaced with the original American Airlines first class seats and carried a bigger crew complement.

Another change in management at Modern Air&#x27;s parent company resulted in the adoption of a new strategy for the airline. This entailed focusing all commercial activities on West Berlin from the beginning of the 1972 summer season to eliminate persistent losses incurred by Modern&#x27;s US operations, which had consisted of contract flights taking prospective buyers from the US Northeast and Midwest to GAC Properties&#x27; real estate developments in Florida and Arizona, charter flights operating under contract to US-based tour operators ASTI and Berry to Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America from New York and Kansas City respectively, as well as extensive military charters carrying reservists within the US.

Under the stewardship of Modern Air&#x27;s newly appointed president, Thomas Ferguson, the airline&#x27;s entire fleet was stationed at Tegel Airport from May 1972. This move resulted in 250 job losses in the Miami area and the concentration of most of Modern Air&#x27;s remaining 297 employees in West Berlin. The increase in Modern&#x27;s Berlin-based fleet resulted in a huge influx of capacity into the West Berlin charter market, where it faced stiff competition from UK rivals Laker Airways and Dan-Air. At the time, Laker&#x27;s and Dan-Air&#x27;s Tegel-based fleets mainly comprised BAC One-Eleven twinjets. These aircraft were better suited to short- and medium-haul Mediterranean flying that accounted for most package tour flights from West Berlin and had fewer seats in a tighter seating configuration than the US supplemental&#x27;s four-engined Convair jets. This made the UK independents&#x27; aircraft more economical for the bulk of West Berlin charter flying and enabled them to undercut its American rival. In addition, the much closer proximity of the UK independent airlines&#x27; main operating bases at London Gatwick Airport and Luton Airport to West Berlin&#x27;s Tegel Airport (compared with Modern Air&#x27;s distant Miami base) enabled Modern&#x27;s West Berlin rivals to dispense with keeping expensive and unproductive spare aircraft and associated personnel in Berlin as replacements could be flown in at short notice. This, as well as their diverse fleets comprising a number of different short-, medium- and long-haul narrow-body and wide-body aircraft, also enabled Modern&#x27;s rivals to respond more flexibly and cost-effectively to seasonal peaks and troughs in demand.

Modern Air&#x27;s management sought to counteract the advantages British competitors enjoyed in the West Berlin charter market by partnering long-standing business partner Berliner Flugring in launching the city&#x27;s first regular, all year round long-haul charter flight programme. It was thought that, in addition to picking up some of the lucrative contracts for an extensive short-/medium-haul West Berlin charter flight programme from Tegel Airport a consortium of three West German tour operators had awarded to defunct British rival Channel Airways in September 1970 (beginning in March 1971), this would provide sufficient utilisation for the airline&#x27;s additional Berlin-based aircraft and enable it to obtain better rates than in the city&#x27;s heavily contested short-/medium-haul charter market. This in turn would allow Berliner Flugring to further differentiate itself from rivals and enable it to charge its customers a premium for a new, unique and superior product. However, this was dependent on regulatory approval by the Allied Air Attachés in Bonn and the aviation authorities of destination countries. However, as a result of pressure exerted by Pan Am, British European Airways (BEA) and Air France on the Allied Air Attachés, as well as objections lodged by the destination countries&#x27; national airlines with their aviation authorities, the relevant approvals were withheld. The established airlines viewed Modern Air&#x27;s plans as a backdoor route to the scheduled air market. They feared that granting permission to a non-member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) outside the relevant intergovernmental, bilateral air transport agreements would set a precedent for other non-IATA members to bypass regulatory restrictions in contemporary bilateral air transport agreements that limited access to scheduled air services and encourage circumvention of IATA fare rules by non-members.

A second attempt by Modern Air and Berliner Flugring to gain approval for their planned year-round long-haul charter programme sought to address the established airlines&#x27; concerns by teaming up with Swiss flag carrier Swissair, whereby Modern Air would fly partner Berliner Flugring&#x27;s long-haul package tour customers between Berlin Tegel and Swissair&#x27;s Zürich Airport base at a minimum frequency of two round trips per week to enable convenient transfers to and from Swissair&#x27;s global network. However, this revised plan still met with objections from Pan Am, BEA and Air France, who viewed Swissair&#x27;s support for it as an attempt to divert long-haul passengers on to the Swiss airline&#x27;s network by using Modern Air&#x27;s proposed Tegel–Zürich flights as a feeder. The Allied Air Attachés upheld the objections of West Berlin&#x27;s three main scheduled airlines by ruling that combining charter and scheduled flights in a package was impermissible. As a result of these rulings, despite increasing the total number of passengers carried in 1972 to just under 400,000 and growing total revenues to $15.6 million, Modern Air was unable to expand profitably in West Berlin and recorded a loss for the year (a $2.42 million operating loss and a $4.14 million net loss, respectively).

In addition, to Modern Air&#x27;s abortive attempts to launch a regular, year-round long-haul charter programme from West Berlin in partnership with Berliner Flugring, the airline and its long-standing business partner also attempted for a number of years to gain all necessary approvals for West Berlin&#x27;s first-ever charter flight to Moscow as part of a one-off, all-inclusive city break package in the Soviet capital. Modern Air&#x27;s management hoped to be able to build on its earlier success of 1968, when interventions at the highest level of the US government with its Soviet counterpart had resulted in Modern Air becoming the first US non-scheduled airline to be given permission at short notice to fly a US charter party to Moscow for a brief stopover on its first transpolar flight (&quot;Polar Byrd I&quot;). In addition to being a test of the limits of East-West cooperation in the then prevailing political climate of &quot;Détente&quot; (which aimed to create a more stable and predictable political environment by easing Cold War tensions), it was thought that this would be a major publicity coup for the airline and help it to raise its public profile further. Despite appearing cooperative initially, the Soviet authorities imposed increasingly onerous conditions on the airline and tour operator for the programme to go ahead. These ultimately proved unworkable and forced its abandonment. Similar to the case of the Bulgarian communist authorities&#x27; sudden and unexplained withdrawal of landing and overflight rights for flights originating/terminating in West Berlin (despite the much-needed hard currency Bulgaria earned from air navigation fees and airport user charges paid by the American and British airlines that operated these flights), some Western political observers at the time suspected behind-the-scenes East German lobbying of its Warsaw Pact ally and chief political backer respectively to have caused this to ensure East Germany&#x27;s political and economic interests were not ignored in its Cold war allies&#x27; interactions with the West, especially where these concerned relations with West Berlin.

=====Entering West Berlin executive charter and scheduled markets=====
At its Berlin base, Modern Air also experimented with executive charter and scheduled services.

Modern Air first applied for scheduled service rights between West Berlin and West Germany, as well as major European cities that could not be accessed by scheduled flights from West Berlin at the time, in 1969. Unlike West Berlin&#x27;s established scheduled airlines, Modern Air promised to operate its planned scheduled services without subsidies on the internal German routes for which it was applying and, where it was planning to compete with existing operators, to undercut existing scheduled air fares by up to 50%. Its application initially focused on the Berlin–Saarbrücken route, which was not served by any of the city&#x27;s established scheduled operators. Although the business community in both locations supported Modern&#x27;s application, West Berlin&#x27;s established airlines opposed it. Pan Am&#x27;s opposition to Modern Air&#x27;s plans was particularly fierce. As a consequence of a general slowdown in global air traffic growth and committing to a large number of Boeing 747s that proved difficult to fill profitably, it had fallen into loss. The only profitable part of Pan Am&#x27;s worldwide scheduled operation was its Internal German Services (IGS) division.

Although Modern Air&#x27;s application for scheduled rights between Berlin and Saarbrücken was outside the CAB&#x27;s regulatory scope as the route did not touch the US or its dependent territories, Pan Am began a major lobbying campaign in Washington, D.C. that aimed to thwart any future attempts by Modern Air and other US supplementals to apply to the CAB for permanent scheduled service authority.

Pan Am&#x27;s opposition to Modern Air&#x27;s Tegel–Saarbrücken scheduled service application focused on the US supplemental&#x27;s alleged lack of scheduled service experience, limited operational experience in the West Berlin air corridors and insufficient spare capacity (in terms of both aircraft and personnel) to cope with unforeseen disruptions. Pan Am claimed that this could result in an unreliable service and potentially endanger passengers&#x27; safety. It also warned that having to compete with Modern Air in addition to government-owned and -subsidised BEA and Air France in West Berlin&#x27;s crowded scheduled air market could threaten the IGS routes&#x27; viability and force it to shut down its operations in Berlin.

A single 12-seater HFB 320 Hansa Jet was acquired in 1970 as an air taxi to serve destinations not accessible by scheduled flights from West Berlin at the time. The arrival of Modern Air&#x27;s Hansa Jet at its Tegel base marked the first appearance of a German-built aircraft at the airport since the end of World War II.

Having overcome Pan Am&#x27;s opposition, Modern Air eventually launched thrice-daily Tegel–Saarbrücken flights with its 12-seater Hansa Jet in May 1971, marking the airline&#x27;s scheduled debut.

As a result of the Hansa Jet&#x27;s poor economics in scheduled airline service and a steady increase in passenger loads, Modern Air applied to the Allied Air Attachés for permission to operate two daily rotations with larger CV-990s. However, the Allied Air Attachés refused this under pressure from both Pan Am and BEA, West Berlin&#x27;s leading contemporary scheduled airlines. Having had its application to introduce larger equipment on this route turned down, Modern Air withdrew all Tegel–Saarbrücken flights in November 1971. Pan Am&#x27;s takeover of Modern Air&#x27;s Saarbrücken route in February 1972, which entailed serving it from the former&#x27;s base at the rival Tempelhof Airport with 128-seat Boeing 727-100s, was followed by the airline&#x27;s unexpected suspension of Tempelhof–Saarbrücken services after less than a year&#x27;s operation, citing insufficient demand. This turn of events resulted in Modern Air applying for permission to re-enter the Berlin–Saarbrücken scheduled market with two daily return flights using CV-990s. Permission for Modern Air to resume its Tegel–Saarbrücken route was granted in time for a summer 1973 re-launch. As a result, the CV-990 became the largest contemporary aircraft type to operate a scheduled service into Saarbrücken&#x27;s small airport.

Several fare increases and the recession following in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis resulted in much reduced demand for air travel in the Berlin–Saarbrücken market. This in turn necessitated a major reduction in frequency to just two round trips per week.

These events, as well as the fact that the CV-990 was far too big and consumed too much fuel to serve a regional scheduled route economically, ultimately put paid to the firm&#x27;s scheduled ambitions.

====Deteriorating business environment====
The setbacks Modern Air had suffered in 1972 and the CAB&#x27;s displeasure at its management&#x27;s decision to end all US operations necessitated a partial reversal of the previous strategy to focus all activities on West Berlin. This entailed a reduction in the Berlin-based workforce and the return of three of eight aircraft to the US at the end of that year&#x27;s summer season in November, in preparation for the resumption of limited charter services from the New York area in 1973.

The resumption of US-based flying featured a series of charters from New York to Miami, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Mexico City as well as entry of the US cargo charter market for the first time. However, startup costs associated with these flights (in addition to significant restructuring costs) meant that Modern Air remained unprofitable in 1973, when it recorded a $1.86 million operating loss and a $3.22 million net loss, respectively, despite total revenues reaching an all-time high of $25.06 million, increasing the total number of passengers carried to more than 490,000 and flying 13,000 freight tonne-kilometres (FTKs).

Steeply rising jet fuel prices in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis and Modern Air&#x27;s reliance on the fuel-thirsty CV-990 had caused a significant increase in its operating costs. This was of particular importance for its operations from and to West Berlin as under Allied air navigation rules aircraft were only permitted to fly at a height of while passing through the Allied air corridors over East Germany, a sub-optimal, fuel-inefficient cruising altitude for modern jet aircraft. A plan to cut costs by further densifying the seating on its 990s to 179, which would have been achieved by converting the aircraft&#x27;s seating arrangement from five to six abreast and resulted in narrowing the aisle to only 16 inches, was rejected by tour operators.

GAC cancelled its contract with Modern Air to fly in prospective land buyers from the US Northeast and Midwest to inspect its property developments in various locations in Florida and Arizona at the end of 1973, as a result of its dwindling property business. For the airline this was a major loss of a steady source of income.

The unexpected decision by the Greek government to close its airspace to all overflights from and to Turkey during the main European summer holiday season in August 1974 following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus on 20 July 1974 compounded Modern Air&#x27;s problems as this compelled all airlines flying between Northern Europe and Turkey to use Bulgarian airspace instead. At the time, Bulgaria&#x27;s then communist government banned all aircraft whose flights had originated or were going to terminate at a West Berlin airport from its airspace. This required all airlines flying between West Berlin and Turkey to make a technical stop en route at another airport outside West Berlin to make it appear to the Bulgarian authorities that these flights did not originate/terminate in West Berlin. This in turn significantly added to operating costs, which Modern Air (and rival airlines) found difficult to pass on in a highly price-sensitive market. It therefore undermined the viability of migrant charter flights between West Berlin and Turkey, especially when operated with fuel-inefficient aircraft such as Modern&#x27;s CV-990s.

To recoup its sharply higher fuel costs in the Berlin market, the airline imposed a fuel surcharge on all tour operators that had contracted their flying programme from Berlin to it. The operators passed on this fuel surcharge to their IT passengers. A major disagreement over the fuel surcharge between Modern Air&#x27;s management and its counterpart at Berliner Flugring, its main overseas business partner, led to a reduction in the Berlin-based fleet from five to four aircraft for the 1974 summer season. There was a plan to replace the fuel-guzzling CV-990s with more efficient, second-hand McDonnell Douglas DC-8s and DC-9s in time for the 1975 summer season. However, an attempt on Modern Air&#x27;s part to pass on a further increase in its fuel surcharge to Berliner Flugring for the planned 1974/75 winter flying programme resulted in the tour operator&#x27;s refusal to renew its long-standing charter contract with the airline. This in turn resulted in the closure of Modern Air&#x27;s Berlin Tegel base at the end of October 1974. The airline had carried over two million passengers during its seven-year presence in West Berlin, which roughly equated to the city&#x27;s contemporary population.

Nineteen seventy-four was Modern Air&#x27;s last full year of operation, during which it recorded a $4.17 million operating loss and an $8.98 million net loss, respectively, while the total number of passengers carried decreased by 17.3% to just over 400,000 and FTKs collapsed by 46.2% to a mere 7,000 (compared with 1973). Modern&#x27;s poor financial performance in 1974 was the worst among all US supplementals at the time. It was also a case of the smallest airline in this category recording the biggest loss.

====Business closure====
Having carried the airline&#x27;s losses since 1967 and failed to secure a buyer for the entire business, GAC refused to invest any further in its airline subsidiary and instructed the airline&#x27;s management to wind down operations and begin disposing of its fleet in 1975. This resulted in the sale of three CV-990s. It also resulted in a labour dispute that saw the airline&#x27;s last remaining seven pilots walk out on 1 September after abandoning the last two active CV-990s (out of a remaining airworthy fleet of five) at New York JFK and Chicago O&#x27;Hare, respectively. All remaining airworthy aircraft were parked at various US airports pending their eventual disposal. The last example was parked at Miami&#x27;s Opa Locka Airport shortly before Modern Air ceased operations on 6 October 1975 in response to the CAB&#x27;s decision to ground the airline, as a consequence of the regulator&#x27;s unhappiness over GAC&#x27;s refusal to commit new funds to the business (after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier that year). In addition, the CAB ordered it to surrender its operating permit the following month (with effect from 20 November). Its West Berlin traffic rights were acquired by Aeroamerica, another US charter and supplemental carrier. Denver-based travel club and charter airline Ports of Call acquired most of the erstwhile Modern Air fleet. Four CV-990As saw active service with Ports of Call while a further two were cannibalised. Other former Modern Air CV-990As were acquired by Detroit-based Nomads travel club and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The aircraft acquired by NASA was used on the Space Shuttle programme as a landing systems research aircraft.

In March 1977, the CAB granted Seattle-based real estate developer Eugene Horbach permission to acquire the remaining assets of bankrupt Modern Air (including the rights to the name). Horbach proceeded to transfer these to a new company named Modern Airways, Inc.. However, this company never became operational.

====Causes of demise====
While higher fuel consumption of Modern Air&#x27;s all-CV-990 mainline fleet (compared with most other contemporary jet aircraft types operated by rival airlines) was the primary cause that led to its demise in the post-1973 oil crisis environment of high fuel prices, there were other important, longer term underlying factors that predated this era and which contributed to the airline&#x27;s downfall.

The most important amongst these included
* the regulatory environment and
* the owners&#x27; attitude towards their airline.

As far as the former was concerned, compliance with contemporary regulatory restrictions on its operations in both the US and West Berlin, which were aimed at protecting bigger, established rival airlines, denied Modern Air access to potentially lucrative business opportunities that could have helped it to grow its presence in these markets as well as its economies of scale to enable it to spread its overheads over a greater level of activity.

Regarding the latter, GAC&#x27;s owners&#x27; view of their airline subsidiary as an adjunct to their property business rather than a profit centre in its own right resulted in failure to invest in the airline adequately. This in turn prevented the mainline fleet to grow beyond eight aircraft and left Modern Air a subscale business compared with rivals. It is important to note in this context that, in the pre-1973 oil crisis era of low fuel prices, Mort Beyer always regarded Modern Air&#x27;s CV-990s more capable than some rival US supplementals&#x27; early model DC-8s or the elderly Comets that still formed a major part of some British rivals&#x27; fleets and which competed with Modern&#x27;s 990s out of West Berlin. But in order for Modern Air to fully leverage the cost advantage of operating a single type fleet comprising CV-990s or later model DC-8s vis-à-vis its competitors and to achieve sustained profitability, it would have needed a homogeneous fleet of approximately 20 aircraft.

===Memorable one-offs===

====&quot;Bosom Bird&quot;====
The operation of a special, one-off &quot;Busenvogel&quot; charter excursion from Tegel to Paris to celebrate Father&#x27;s Day in June 1970, during which topless showgirls from West Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Daily Girl Club&quot; assisted four flight attendants in serving champagne to a group of 110 passengers (107 male, three female), gained Modern Air notoriety. It was organised by John MacDonald, who had been promoted to the role of Modern&#x27;s Berlin-based Vice President Europe by the time. However, MacDonald acted on his own, without informing Beyer or obtaining the GAC board&#x27;s prior approval. Despite succeeding in raising the airline&#x27;s public profile by gaining free worldwide publicity courtesy of the global media&#x27;s attention, this did not go down well with GAC&#x27;s owners. Mindful of their main business unit GAC Properties&#x27; predominantly older, socially conservative clientele, they did not wish to be associated with such stunts and the controversy generated in many parts of the world. GAC&#x27;s owners&#x27; displeasure at their airline&#x27;s senior management&#x27;s failure to uphold its values resulted in Beyer and MacDonald being summoned to GAC&#x27;s headquarters in Florida, where they were reprimanded for their conduct and where it was made clear to them that their future employment with Modern Air depended on there being no repetition.

====Transpolar flights====
The operation of two round-the-world transpolar luxury charter flights in 1968 and 1970, respectively, arguably ranks as Modern Air&#x27;s greatest achievement.

=====&quot;Polar Byrd I&quot;=====
On 22 November 1968, the first of these saw CV-990A N5612 &quot;Polar Byrd I&quot;, which had a special Polar Path Compass (PPC) system fitted for the polar trip, become the first commercial jetliner to land on and take off from the ice runway at the McMurdo Station airfield at Williams Field, McMurdo Sound in Antarctica. This flight commemorated the 40th anniversary of Admiral Richard Byrd&#x27;s South Pole flight.

The special commemorative flight was arranged by Edward C. Bursk, chairman of the &quot;Admiral Richard E. Byrd&quot; polar research centre in Boston and editor of the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot;. He offered 400 wealthy US businessmen the chance to make history by joining this unique mission in support of his fund raising exercise for the Byrd Center. Eventually, 70 US businessmen took up Bursk&#x27;s offer. They paid $10,000 each to partake in the special, round-the-world trip over both Poles.

Flight KV 907 departed Boston on 8 November 1968 with 70 passengers and 10 crew on board. Modern Air&#x27;s chief pilot (and former Air Force One pilot), Harold L. Neff was in command. The passengers were seated four abreast (two on each side of the aisle) in the former American Airlines first class seats, which Modern Air had acquired together with the aircraft from the US major and which had replaced the aircraft&#x27;s usual, five-abreast, slimline charter seating configuration for this trip. Cdr F.G. Dustin, who had accompanied [then Cdr] Byrd on his second Antarctic expedition in 1934, was among the passengers. The flight routed over the North Pole via Greenland, Alaska, the Philippines, Japan, Australia and New Zealand to Antarctica, where it made the historic landing at McMurdo Sound. From there it routed over the South Pole, before crossing the International Date Line a second time and proceeding northwards to southern Argentina, Brazil, West Africa and Europe. Rome was the first European stop, from where the flight continued to Moscow via Copenhagen (where an Aeroflot navigator joined the flight deck), before night-stopping in London and returning to Boston the following day, 3 December 1968.

The en route stop in Moscow also made Modern Air the first US commercial airline to operate a charter flight to the erstwhile Soviet Union.

Modern Air&#x27;s historic arrival in Moscow was memorable for a different reason as well. In common with other contemporary jet aircraft types, such as the Boeing 707/720, deHavilland Comet, Douglas DC-8, Sud Aviation Caravelle and Vickers VC-10, Convair&#x27;s 880/990 lacked an auxiliary power unit (APU). This made the Convair jets dependent on an external ground power unit (GPU) to provide electrical power for the aircraft while stationary on the ground, including starting the engines. When &quot;Polar Byrd I&quot; needed power externally supplied by a GPU to start its engines at the end of the stopover in Moscow to resume its journey, it was found that the Soviet GPUs could not be connected to the CV-990s air intake valve due to an incompatibility between the ground equipment&#x27;s fittings and the aircraft&#x27;s valve. This necessitated flying in a Modern Air GPU from West Berlin and resulted in the delay of the onward flight. It also resulted in a subsequent collaboration between Modern Air&#x27;s maintenance department and Garrett AiResearch to design and test a CV-990 APU, which was located in a hollow area behind the fuel tank inside the aircraft&#x27;s inboard anti-shock body on the starboard wing. This however proved unsuccessful, resulting in the unit&#x27;s removal after the first installation.

The Byrd Center kept half of the $700,000 it had raised for its historic round-the-world transpolar trip, which cost $250,000 to organise. This left Modern Air with a profit of $100,000.

=====&quot;Polar Bird II&quot;=====
Modern Air&#x27;s second round-the-world transpolar luxury charter flight was arranged by Hemphill World Cruises of Los Angeles. This time the flight was operated by CV-990A N5615 &quot;Polar Bird II&quot;, which departed Los Angeles International Airport in early December 1970 with 60 wealthy, elderly passengers with an average age of above 70 on board and Captain Ross Zimmermann in command. Unlike Modern&#x27;s first transpolar flight, where all passengers were male, this flight had a mixed, male/female passenger complement. As on the first flight two years earlier, former American Airlines first-class seats (configured four-abreast) replaced the usual slimline charter seats (configured five-abreast). However, unlike in 1968, there was also a lounge in the aircraft&#x27;s forward fuselage.

Similar to the pattern established in 1968, the flight routed over the North Pole (via Anchorage) before heading for Europe, Africa, South Asia and the South Pacific, where a stopover on Easter Island enabled passengers and crew to disembark and tour the island before proceeding to Santiago de Chile and Punta Arenas. Apart from there being far fewer en route stops (compared with 1968), the main difference between the &quot;Polarbyrd I&quot; and &quot;Polarbird II&quot; flights was that landing on McMurdo Station airfield&#x27;s ice runway at the US Navy&#x27;s Williams Field Antarctic research station in McMurdo Sound was no longer possible as the US Navy had begun restricting access to the airfield to essential flights only, in the wake of an incident two months earlier. This had resulted in a US Navy Constellation on a non-essential flight with 80 passengers and crew on board crash landing there in a snowstorm and stranding its passengers and crew for several days. As a result of this incident, the US Navy had also withdrawn refuelling facilities at the airfield, which made commercial airline operations impractical. A last-minute appeal at the highest level of the US government failed to reverse the US Navy&#x27;s decision. As a consequence (as well as owing to bad weather in the area at the time), when the flight departed Punta Arenas on 11 December on the last leg of the trip (before returning to the US) the closest &quot;Polarbird II&quot; came to the original South Pole experience of &quot;Polarbyrd I&quot; back in 1968 was to offer its passengers a round trip within a radius of the South Pole with views of the Antarctic icecap.

==Fleet details==

===Fleet in 1967===
In November 1967, Modern Air&#x27;s fleet comprised 16 piston airliners.

Deliveries of five former American Airlines Convair CV-990As began in January 1967.

===Fleet in 1972===
In May 1972, Modern Air&#x27;s fleet comprised nine jet aircraft.

300 people were employed.

==Accidents and incidents==
On 8 August 1970, ex-Alaska Convair CV-990A-30A-8 (registration N5603) undershot the runway at Acapulco&#x27;s Álvarez Airport during a VOR/ILS approach at the end of a ferry/positioning flight that had originated in New York, where 102 charter passengers travelling on a package tour arranged by Asti Mexican Tours had boarded the aircraft for their flight to Mexico City Benito Juárez Airport. Having safely disembarked its passengers at their intended destination, the aircraft was then ferried with only the flight deck and cabin crew on board to Acapulco to pick up another load of 146 charter passengers booked with the same tour operator for their return flight to New York as contemporary Mexican rules governing tour groups visiting the country by air did not permit their arrival at and departure from the same airport. The night time approach to Acapulco Álvarez Airport in rainy and foggy weather resulted in the aircraft colliding with the airport&#x27;s approach lights before touching down short of the runway, breaking up and catching fire. Initially, it was thought that this had resulted in the death of one of its cabin crew, who had remained unaccounted for during the rescue operation that had saved the other seven, badly injured crew members. When rescue workers returned to the crash site the following morning to retrieve the remains of the missing crew member, the unaccounted for crew member was found in the burnt-out tail section, still alive but seriously injured. After being rushed to the same hospital where the other seven crew members were receiving medical attention, all eight eventually made a full recovery.

On 28 May 1971, one of Modern Air&#x27;s Berlin-based CV-990As with 45 passengers on board en route from Berlin Tegel to Bulgaria was unexpectedly denied permission to enter Bulgarian airspace, as a result of a new policy adopted by that country&#x27;s communist government to deny any aircraft whose flight had originated or was going to terminate at a West Berlin airport the right to take off and land at any of its airports. This resulted in the aircraft having to turn back to Berlin, where it landed safely at the city&#x27;s Tegel Airport.

<doc id="1195420" wikidata="Q3358922" url="?curid=1195420" title="Overseas National Airways">
<text>Overseas National Airways (ONA) was a supplemental air carrier (also known as an irregular air carrier or a non-scheduled carrier) during the period in which the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), a now defunct United States Federal agency, tightly regulated almost all US commercial air transport. From 1964 onward, supplemental carriers were charter carriers, but until 1964 they were charter-scheduled hybrids. Until 1950, ONA was known as Calasia Air Transport, and until 1947, Air Travel.

ONA was effectively two distinct carriers, separated by a two-year interval in 1963–1965 during which it fell into bankruptcy and became almost completely moribund, after which it was reconstituted by new ownership/management. From 1969 through the mid-1970s, ONA was one of the largest charter carriers in the United States, engaged in diverse activities including building the Mississippi Queen paddlewheel riverboat. However, in its last years the carrier faced increasing competition, uncertainty and poor financial results and in 1975–1977 suffered the loss of three aircraft in accidents within a 16-month period, including two DC-10s within two months. The carrier chose to liquidate in 1978 outside bankruptcy.

==History==
===Early days===

San Francisco-based Air Travel was incorporated in California 18 May 1946 by George W. Tompkins, a former World War II Navy transport pilot who obtained a war surplus C-54 through preferences for returning veterans. In 1947, Air Travel became Calasia Air Transport. The carrier was issued its &quot;Letter of Registration&quot; on 12 August 1947 (in lieu of certificate, as was standard for irregular airlines at the time). Also in 1947, Calasia started operating its fleet of five leased C-54s under contract to Transocean Air Lines until January 1950. In July 1950, Overseas National Airways was incorporated in Delaware, and ONA started operating in the Pacific under contract to the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) (North Korean troops crossed into South Korea on June 25, 1950). In 1954, ONA was an applicant in a CAB case in which Seaboard &amp; Western Airlines was certificated as a scheduled transatlantic cargo carrier. ONA was judged able but not as able as Seaboard, which, based on 1953 data was about three times the size of ONA, whether by fleet (12 DC-4s vs 4) or revenues. ONA&#x27;s 1953 revenue was 100% military, split 52/48 passenger/cargo.

===Military charter carrier===

The CAB tightly regulated almost all commercial air transportation in the US, intentionally suppressing competition including regulating all fares as well as determining where scheduled airlines flew.

Until 1960, a major exception in this regime were military charter contracts, which were competitively bid. The CAB had to accept this situation because the US military permitted so-called Part 45 carriers to bid for military charters. Part 45 airlines were not common carriers (did not offer services to the public), and thus escaped CAB regulation. Any attempt by the CAB to impose minimum military charter bids on CAB-regulated carriers could be undercut by Part 45s. Thus military charters were a competitive free-for all. In 1959, for instance, the US military invited 97 carriers to bid for charter work.

This was relevant to ONA because until 1963, it was almost entirely a military charter carrier. In only three years did it have significant civil (commercial) business (see Table 1), including running 140 transatlantic charters in 1959. Once the Korean War was over in 1953, ONA was unable to sustain its financial performance which degraded substantially by the end of the decade. In 1959 ONA bid so aggressively for international MATS contracts that it won over half the awards by dollar value, stripping Trans World Airlines (TWA) and Pan Am of their former MATS business. To handle the volume, ONA leased nine DC-7s to augment its core fleet of four DC-6s. As Table 1 shows, 1960 ONA revenue increased dramatically from 1959, but it also suffered a substantial loss.


ONA&#x27;s 1960 gambit contributed to a substantial change in military charter contracting. US scheduled carriers had long been unhappy with competitive MATS bidding. ONA&#x27;s audacious bid motivated TWA, Pan Am and others to press their case with the military, Congress and the CAB. Separately, in February 1960, a report to President Eisenhower recommended, inter alia, and the President approved, that Part 45 carriers be excluded from international MATS bidding. With Part 45s no longer a factor, in July 1960 the CAB said it no longer accept competitive bidding for military business. The CAB duly set a minimum rate for international MATS flying. With price no longer a variable, MATS ranked bidders according to their ability to provide (1) turbine (jet or turboprop) equipment with cargo capability, (2) turbine equipment (3) piston equipment with cargo capability in that order. In 1960, no supplemental carrier had long-range turbine equipment (even in 1964, all supplementals together had only six such aircraft, against 427 among the scheduled carriers) so this substantially advantaged the scheduled carriers. When the first set of bids was announced later in 1960 subject to these criteria, Pan Am was on top with 20.5% of the dollar value and TWA was second with 18.6%. ONA&#x27;s share was 8.5%.

ONA of this era had its main operational base at Oakland, a smaller base in New York and a small headquarters in Washington, DC.

===1963–1965 bankruptcy and rebirth===
In October 1963, George Tompkins said that supplementals didn&#x27;t work without military business and ONA was having trouble obtaining it. October 1963 was eventful for ONA: operations ceased on the 4th and the company entered bankruptcy on the 28th. Tompkins&#x27;s bankruptcy affidavit noted jets rendered ONA&#x27;s fleet obsolete. Liabilities were $3.5 million (about $36 million in 2024 dollars), assets only $0.5mm. Ironically, in the same month, the CAB selected ONA as one of three supplementals to receive transatlantic charter authority (eliminating the need to ask CAB permission for each such charter) and sent the recommendation to the White House for required approval. In February 1964, when President Johnson signed off, the CAB had still not revised the selection to account for ONA&#x27;s defunct state. The White House noticed and Johnson declined that part of the recommendation. Also in February, Tompkins took a position at a Fort Lauderdale real estate firm.
G.F. Steedman Hinckley was a former ONA pilot and executive. Hinckley was from old money (his birth was announced in society pages and he dated Rockefeller debutantes). (the Flight 032 video in External links contains a brief clip of Hinckley speaking after the crash). Louis Marx Jr (son of toy tycoon Louis Marx), was a Princeton classmate. Marx was a childhood friend of Dan Lufkin, of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette (in which Marx invested). Marx and Lufkin were among Hinckley&#x27;s partners in funding ONA&#x27;s July 1965 bankruptcy exit and October 1965 resumption of operations, when Hinckley was just 33 years old. Many former ONA employees returned including George Tompkins as chairman. Retired Hall of Fame baseball player Hank Greenberg was on the board. Hinckley believed the superior economics, speed and comfort of jets would boost air travel and increase demand for commercial charters. In April 1966, the CAB gave ONA the right to fly Atlantic charters. The CAB had a strong preference for jets and ONA had two DC-8s coming for summer 1966 whereas two supplementals that already had Atlantic rights, American Flyers Airline and Saturn Airways, had yet to obtain such equipment. ONA also secured a contract through the Military Airlift Command (MAC), successor to MATS. Jet operations started June 1966.

===Success===

As Table 2 shows, ONA was immediately profitable in 1966, followed by two more highly profitable high-growth years. 1969 was less profitable, but in that year, ONA was the second largest supplemental by revenue, behind only World Airways. At the end of 1966, ONA had two DC-8-55Fs and four DC-7s, with a DC-8-63 on order and two optioned. In June 1967, ONA completed an initial public offering, raising over $10 million (over $90 million in 2024 terms). By year end, the airline added cargo DC-9s to its fleet for the US Air Force Logair domestic cargo contract. In January 1968, it committed to eight Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprop cargo conversions. In June 1969, ONA ordered three DC-10s, with three options, launching, with Trans International Airlines, a convertible (passenger/freight) version of the DC-10 that became known as the DC-10-30CF. In 1970, ONA had a fleet of five DC-9 freighters, four DC-9 passenger aircraft, eight Electra turboprop aircraft and five DC-8s, of which three were stretch models (60-series DC-8s). In 1972, when ONA announced its new maintenance base in Wilmington, Ohio (discussed below), part of the rationale was it was to be an operational center for its DC-9 and Electra domestic cargo business, both military and the flying of car parts for Ford from Detroit Willow Run Airport.
===Diversification===
ONA diversified outside of airlines. In October 1968 it announced participation in construction of a 400-room hotel in Nassau, Bahamas. In 1969, ONA ordered a cruise ship (with options for two more), to sail the Mediterranean in summer and Caribbean in winter. Also in 1969, it bought the Delta Queen paddlewheel riverboat. Another subsidiary was Automated Terminal Services, providing ground handling for the Navy&#x27;s Quicktrans domestic cargo program with about 400 employees in 1970. The hotel and cruise ships came to a quick end. Extrication from the hotel resulted in significant writeoffs in 1971 and 1972. Since cruise ships are also common carriers, operating such required CAB approval and the examiner was not favorable. ONA entered a joint venture with Cunard to operate the ship, but a disappointing 1969 and tough first quarter 1970 left ONA cash hungry, so, soon after ordering a second ship, ONA sold out to Cunard, freeing substantial liquidity and over $6 million in capital gains, but disappointing Hinckley. The riverboat investment lasted longer. Starting in 1973, ONA funded (with the aid of a government loan) the construction (for over $20 million—over $100 million in 2024 terms) of a larger boat, the Mississippi Queen, which started operation in 1976. Hinckley&#x27;s brother Albert (an architect) ran the project, but by its first voyage in 1976, ONA had sold the riverboats to the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York.

===Atlantic dependence===
In the last decade of the regulated era (ending 1978), the critical civilian market for US supplemental airlines was Europe. In 1976 the CAB noted the transatlantic market accounted for about 75% of global supplemental operations. By 1969 ONA was already the largest supplemental on the Atlantic (by revenue and by number of passengers flown) with transatlantic revenue of $22.8 million, or 77% of the civilian charter revenue shown for 1969 in Table 2. In September 1974, the CAB noted the Atlantic accounted for 99% of ONA civilian revenue. The CEO of Universal Airlines (another large supplemental of the era) attributed its 1972 demise to inability to secure finance in the face of a CAB attempt to strip it of Atlantic rights. With the exception of tiny Johnson Flying Service, bought by Evergreen Helicopters in 1975, all of ONA&#x27;s mid-1960s supplemental contemporaries without Atlantic rights ceased operations (Standard in 1969, Purdue in 1971, Modern in 1975, McCulloch in 1977). Lack of other big US charter markets frustrated ONA. It lobbied the CAB with a detailed white paper calling for US adoption of European-type inclusive tour rules, noting that in 1972, European charter airlines flew 8.5 million such passengers, while restrictive CAB rules limited the US inclusive tour market to just 100,000.

===Fleet changes===
ONA&#x27;s fleet changed significantly over its last five years.
* In 1973, two DC-10s delivered, bringing widebodies for the summer season. But ONA also started acquiring used early-model DC-8-20/30 aircraft (powered by less efficient turbojets rather than turbofans) and retrofitting them for high-density seating at the Ohio maintenance base.
* In 1974, the Electras left the fleet. As previously related, one rationale for the Ohio maintenance base was to be an operational center for the freight operation. ONA had 10 Electras in the fleet at year-end 1973, still had seven at August 1, 1974, but the fleet was gone by year end.
* An involuntary change was the loss of its two DC-10s within two months in November 1975 and January 1976 (see Accidents below for details), abruptly leaving ONA without widebodies.
* In 1976, the DC-9s were traded in as part of the deal to get replacement DC-10s. ONA was no longer in the domestic cargo business. Also, by year end, ONA stopped flying DC-8-20/30 aircraft, after effectively only three years of operation (these aircraft flew minimal hours in 1973, their year of introduction).
* In 1977, two replacement DC-10s arrived in time for summer. The simplified fleet of DC-10s and stretch DC-8s did far better than the prior year (see Table 2). Simplifying further, ONA grounded the remaining DC-8s at year end, going into 1978 a pure DC-10 operator, with a third DC-10 due for summer high season.

===Regulatory uncertainty===
1975–1978 was a period of profound airline regulatory change, starting with Senator Ted Kennedy&#x27;s 1975 Senate hearings on the CAB and the appointment of two pro-competition CAB chairs, John E. Robson (1975) and Alfred E. Kahn (1977). In October 1978 President Carter signed the Airline Deregulation Act, which initiated U.S. airline deregulation on 1 January 1979.

Effective September 1975, the CAB approved the one-stop charter (OTC), the Europe-type inclusive tour charter ONA wanted. OTCs had a big impact in 1976, especially in Hawaii and Las Vegas, and in October 1976, the CAB approved a further relaxation of charter rules, approving the ABC (the advance booking charter), another Hinckley desire. Other than booking in advance and through a tour operator, ABCs were little different than a scheduled flight. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and others, proclaimed the future belonged to charters. As the country debated deregulation, Hinckley wanted a protected niche for supplementals, he did not believe they could survive head-on competition with the scheduled airlines. Past experience showed scheduled airlines could crush charter carriers. For instance, in the late 1960s, supplementals built a successful charter business to Hawaii, only for it to evaporate when the CAB permitted scheduled carriers to offer low group fares that grabbed the business. US scheduled airlines had many empty seats: the CAB set a policy of aiming for 55% loadfactors, trying to increase them from a level closer to 50%. In 1976, it was the scheduled airlines that benefitted from OTCs, carrying 28% more passengers on charters in 1976 (5.2 million) than 1975. By comparison, supplementals carried 7% fewer passengers (2.2 million) in 1976. In March 1977, American Airlines (then mainly a domestic carrier) in response to ABCs, launched supersaver fares, offering deep discounts in return for charter-like restrictions such as advance booking and a week-long stay requirement. By the end of summer 1977, supersavers destroyed the market for domestic ABCs.

===Laker===
From June 1971 Laker Airways, a UK charter carrier, attempted to gain approval for its Skytrain concept: reservationless scheduled service between New York and London for a charter fare. ONA consistently opposed Laker&#x27;s attempts. But in late 1976 the British government backed Laker as the second carrier permitted under the UK air service treaty with the US. In June 1977 the CAB authorized Laker&#x27;s service, which launched in September. Incumbents responded with low fares of their own, including Atlantic markets outside New York-London. Europe-New York deep discount travel increased over 300% in the first quarter of 1978. The overall New York-London market expanded by 39% in the six months ending March 1978. This undermined the rationale for charters, and some tour operators started going out of business.

===Liquidation===
By 1976, ONA was considering exit strategies. In February the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York made an offer for ONA, but ultimately contented itself with buying the riverboat operation, as mentioned above. Still seeking a partner, ONA received an offer in September from Alaska International Air (AIA; later known as Markair), an Alaska intrastate airline operating Lockheed L-100 Hercules aircraft. The similarity with the then-pending merger between Hercules operator Saturn and Trans International was noted. For AIA, the attraction was using the ONA certificate to fly to the rest of the US. But the offer depended on AIA finding funding, and lenders were wary of supplemental carriers. The deal died in December.

In October 1977, Steedman Hinckley resigned, pushed out. ONA shares, which had once traded over $45, traded for only a couple dollars in 1977. Dominant shareholders were still Louis Marx and Dan Lufkin. Under a new non-airline leader, the airline grounded its DC-8s (as previously mentioned) and eliminated all remaining non-airline activity. An early 1978 strike at McDonnell Douglas delayed delivery of ONA&#x27;s third DC-10, with planned delivery shifting to October from June, thereby missing the 1978 high season. ONA sold the undelivered DC-10 and said it would ground, at least temporarily, the other two DC-10s after the high season. ONA and other supplementals were seeing tour program cancellations well above normal. ONA emphasized it was able to pay its bills, given its cash reserve. Later that summer, it confirmed it was going out of business. The downturn in traffic and collapse in pricing meant that even with the third DC-10, the carrier would have lost money. It was able to sell the DC-10s at a significant gain over book value, ensuring a return for shareholders. The airline simply did not believe it could compete with discounts offered by scheduled airlines. Last day was September 15.

==Legacy==
Steedman Hinckley went on to almost immediately create a second, separately certificated Overseas National Airways, which eventually was renamed National Airlines. The activities of that second airline are sometimes confused with the original; there were aircraft that operated for both versions. Any aircraft operating for &quot;Overseas National Airways&quot; 1978 or before was doing so for the original ONA. Any aircraft operating for &quot;Overseas National Airways&quot; in 1979 or later was doing that for the second version.

==Wilmington Air Park base==
From 1972 to 1977, ONA had a maintenance base at Wilmington Air Park in Ohio, as part of which, it also controlled the airfield. ONA moved functionality to Wilmington from a prior base in Norfolk, Virginia. Employment peaked at 140 in early 1976. Among other duties, the base performed the complete interior reconfigurations of several DC-8s purchased from Eastern Air Lines, moving galleys and lavatories to accommodate high density seating. The base also handled dispatch of the domestic cargo fleet, which operated for the US Air Force Logair system, and also delivered car parts. ONA shut the base after it disposed of the DC-8s. The assets were sold to an independent maintenance organization called Ohio Air Center, which took over in November 1977.

==ONA DC-10s==
ONA ordered five DC-10s, but the last delivered the week ONA ceased operations and was earlier sold to Seaboard World. The other four were destroyed in accidents, the two ONA accidents discussed in the Accidents section and two others after ONA was dissolved. Of the four accidents, only one was fatal:

* 13 September 1982: Spantax Flight 995, a tire on the DC-10 disintegrated on takeoff at Madrid Barajas Airport, leading to a late rejected takeoff, loss of control, aircraft destruction and the death of 50 out of 394 people on board.
* 23 December 1983: At Anchorage Ted Stevens International Airport, a Korean Air Lines crew became disoriented in fog and attempted to take off on the wrong runway, crashing their DC-10 into a small aircraft. There were no fatalities but the DC-10 was destroyed.

The Spantax (serial number 46962) and Korean Air Lines (serial number 46960) aircraft were delivered to ONA in June and May 1977 respectively.

==Accidents==

* 17 November 1951: DC-4 N79992 collided with California Eastern Airways DC-4 N4002B near Oakland Airport while both aircraft were on instrument check flights with hoods installed in the left-hand side of the cockpits. The collision destroyed the ONA DC-4 and killed all three pilots. The California Eastern pilots survived, albeit with aircraft damage. The pilots were cited for failure to keep watch, and California Eastern for lack of a third pilot as required observer.
* 20 June 1961 DC-7 N312A was doing an engine runup under the control of mechanics when the brakes failed and aircraft rolled forward into Lockheed Constellation N5595A, which was being moved by other mechanics. The collision resulted in substantial damage to both aircraft and injuries to the mechanic towing the Connie. The ONA aircraft was a writeoff.
* 26 September 1961 DC-7 N317A suffered a hydraulic failure on a ferry flight from New York to Norfolk Naval Air Station in Norfolk, Virginia. Captain did not properly brief the crew. Landing gear and flaps were deployed without hydraulics but there was loss of directional control on landing. Captain used unapproved means of differential reverse thrust, aircraft went off runway and hit an embankment, shearing off the nose gear and one of the mains, with post-impact fire. Crew of five was unharmed, aircraft was a writeoff.
* 2 May 1970: ALM Flight 980 operated by ONA DC-9-30 N935F named &quot;Carib Queen&quot;, originating at New York, failed several times to land at St. Maarten then attempted to divert to St. Croix, ditching 35 miles offshore St. Croix when the aircraft ran out of fuel, killing 23 of 63 on board. See External links for a reference to a 2008 book on this incident.
* 12 November 1975: Flight 032, DC-10 N1032F on a ferry flight to Frankfurt Airport, suffered a bird strike while on its takeoff roll at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. The aircraft was destroyed, but all 139 people on board survived.
* 2 January 1976: Saudia Flight 5130, ONA operated DC-10 N1031F, landed short at Istanbul. A fire occurred in the #1 engine after the aircraft crash-landed. The aircraft was destroyed but all passengers and crew survived. See External links for video of the aftermath.
* 4 March 1977: DC-8-63CF registration N8635 operating a cargo flight for French airline UTA, crashed on approach to Niamey Airport in Niger, killing two of the four crew and the write off of the aircraft.

<doc id="1195425" wikidata="Q3754125" url="?curid=1195425" title="Fujitsu VP2000">
<text>The VP2000 was the second series of vector supercomputers from Fujitsu. Announced in December 1988, they replaced Fujitsu&#x27;s earlier FACOM VP Model E Series. The VP2000 was succeeded in 1995 by the VPP300, a massively parallel supercomputer with up to 256 vector processors.

The VP2000 was similar in many ways to their earlier designs, and in turn to the Cray-1, using a register-based vector processor for performance. For additional performance the vector units supported a special multiply-and-add instruction that could retire two results per clock cycle. This instruction &quot;chain&quot; is particularly common in many supercomputer applications.

Another difference is that the main scalar units of the processor ran at half the speed of the vector unit. According to Amdahl&#x27;s Law computers tend to run at the speed of their slowest unit, and in this case unless the program spent most of its time in the vector units, the slower scalar performance would make it 1/2 the performance of a Cray-1 at the same speed. The reason for this seemingly odd &quot;feature&quot; is unclear.

One of the major complaints about the earlier VP series was their limited memory bandwidth—while the machines themselves had excellent performance in the processors, they were often starved for data. For the VP2000 series this was addressed by adding a second load/store unit to the scalar units, doubling memory bandwidth.

Several versions of the machines were sold at different price points. The low-end VP2100 ran at an 8 ns cycle time and delivered only 0.5 GFLOPS (about 4-8 times the performance of a Cray), while the VP2200 and VP2400 decreased the cycle time to 4 ns and delivered between 1.25 and 2.5 GFLOPS peak. The high-end VP2600 ran at 3.2 ns and delivered 5 GFLOPS. All of the models came in the /10 versions with a single scalar processor, or the /20 with a second, while the 2200 and 2400 also came in a /40 configuration with four. Due to the additional load/store units, adding additional scalar units improved performance by increasing memory bandwidth, as well as allowing several programs to run at the same time and thereby increase the chance there was something to process on the vector unit. Each unit is said to increase performance 1.5 times, allowing the VP2400/40 to match the performance of the earlier VP2600/20.

The machines were supplied with either the Unix-compatible UXP/M or the MVS-compatible VSP/S operating systems, both supplied by Amdahl. The later was used for Fortran programs while the former was typically used for C, and vectorizing compilers were supplied for both languages.

Like most companies, Fujitsu turned to massive parallelism for future machines, and the VP2000 family were not on the market for very long. Nevertheless, over 100 were sold, and in July 1993, there were 180 installed.

<doc id="1195428" wikidata="Q751819" url="?curid=1195428" title="Hem (band)">
<text>Hem is a musical group from Brooklyn, New York. Band members include Sally Ellyson (vocals), Dan Messé (piano, accordion, glockenspiel), Gary Maurer (guitar, mandolin), Steve Curtis (guitar, mandolin, banjo, back-up vocals), George Rush (bass guitar), Mark Brotter (drums), Bob Hoffnar (pedal steel guitar), and Heather Zimmerman (violin). The group sometimes expands to include other musicians and orchestral accompaniments.

Their music has been variously described as &quot;folk&quot;, &quot;indie&quot;, &quot;Americana&quot; and &quot;roots&quot;. Stylistically, their songs bridge 19th-century American parlour music, Appalachian folk music, gospel music, traditional American ballads, the European art song, early jazz, and even contemporary classical music.

==Band history==
In 1999, songwriter Dan Messé and producer Gary Maurer teamed up and decided to produce a record. A mutual friend, Steve Curtis, joined them. None of them knew any potential singing talents for the band, so they placed an advertisement in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Overwhelmed by an onslaught of bizarre and unlistenable demo tapes, the three friends soon abandoned their quest.

Months later Sally Ellyson called Messé in response to the ad, cautioning that she was not really a &quot;singer&quot;. A skeptical Messé asked Ellyson for a demo tape and was greatly surprised when he heard the very spare recording, which featured Ellyson&#x27;s a cappella renditions of several old-time lullabies that she had recorded for the infant son of a long-time friend. Messé was impressed — and Hem had finally found itself a singer. Ellyson was soon whisked into New York recording studio, Stratosphere sound, to record vocals on tracks that would later become the album &quot;Rabbit Songs&quot;.

Several of Ellyson&#x27;s lullabies have since surfaced on subsequent Hem releases. &quot;Rabbit Songs&quot; opened with the lullaby &quot;Lord, Blow the Moon Out, Please.&quot; from the original demo tape. &quot;Eveningland&quot; featured &quot;Now the Day is Over&quot; as a hidden track (after the song &quot;Carry Me Home&quot;), and &quot;No Word From Tom&quot; opened with yet another lullaby, &quot;All the Pretty Horses.&quot;

&quot;Rabbit Songs&quot; was widely acclaimed in the U.S. music press. The album received glowing praise in a feature story on NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot; and garnered an enthusiastic review from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Allmusic described the album as having an &quot;effortlessly timeless appeal&quot;. Including overseas releases, the album has been issued and reissued a total of eight times as of 2006.

Problems at Hem&#x27;s new label, DreamWorks Records, delayed the release of the band&#x27;s second album. Finally, in late 2004, &quot;Eveningland&quot; was released on Rounder Records. &quot;Eveningland&quot; capitalized on the success of &quot;Rabbit Songs&quot;, enjoying positive reviews in the U.S. from the likes of Pitchfork Media as well as from international media outlets, such as the BBC.

In early 2006, Hem&#x27;s third album, &quot;No Word From Tom&quot;, was released by Nettwerk. In much the same vein as the band&#x27;s EP &quot;I&#x27;m Talking With My Mouth&quot;, &quot;No Word From Tom&quot; showcased a collection of cover songs, live versions of original songs from prior albums, and some new material.

Later in 2006, Hem received a career boost when the song &quot;Half-Acre&quot;, from &quot;Rabbit Songs&quot;, was featured in a television commercial for Liberty Mutual insurance, which brought their music to many who might not otherwise have heard it. In May 2007, in a follow-up campaign, Liberty Mutual used Hem&#x27;s music once again, debuting a new song, &quot;The Part Where You Let Go.&quot;

Hem&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Funnel Cloud&quot;, was released on September 5, 2006. &quot;Funnel Cloud&quot; was recorded with a 21-piece orchestra, and with help from the likes of former The Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha and Ollabelle vocalist Amy Helm (daughter of Levon Helm). One of the songs from the album, &quot;Not California&quot;, was subsequently featured on NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Songs Considered.&quot;

In 2007, the band received another career boost when they played with the Boston Pops at Symphony Hall, for the Boston Pops&#x27; annual event Edgefest.

The band provided the music for the 2009 Public Theater production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, featuring Anne Hathaway in the role of Viola. The band received a nomination for Outstanding Music in a Play for the 2009/2010 Drama Desk Awards. The band released the album &quot;Departure and Farewell&quot; in 2013. A short UK tour took place in October 2013, along with a session on the &quot;Bob Harris Sunday&quot; show on BBC Radio 2.

A 2013 article on poptech.org noted, &quot;But as work on &quot;Departure and Farewell&quot; continued, it was increasingly characterized by upheaval, riven by the dissolution of two marriages, and punctuated by addiction, family loss and crisis. Eventually discord set in, making it even more likely that the band’s career would end here, and not with a grace note.&quot; This is repeated on the Nettwerk Music Group site.

Ten years after this hiatus, the band revealed on September 24th, 2023 that they had begun working on music once again. From their Facebook group: &quot;Dear Friends, at long last we can confirm that we are making new Hem music for you. We couldn’t be more excited. Stay tuned!&quot;

<doc id="1195432" wikidata="Q2461165" url="?curid=1195432" title="Hugh Aston">
<text>Hugh Aston (also spelled &quot;Asseton&quot;, &quot;Assheton&quot;, &quot;Ashton&quot;, &quot;Haston&quot;; c. 1485 – buried 17 November 1558) was an English composer of the early Tudor period. While little of his music survives, he is notable for his innovative keyboard and church music writing. He was also politically active, a mayor, Member of Parliament, and Alderman.

==Biography==
Hugh Aston was born in Leicester in or around 1485. His father was Alderman Robert Aston, a Senior Burgess of Leicester&#x27;s South Ward. Hugh&#x27;s subsequent musical education points to the likelihood that his early years were spent as a boy chorister, probably in the Choral College and Hospital of the Annunciation of St Mary in the Newarke, (The Newarke College). This was near the &#x27;South Ward&#x27; represented by his father, beside the south gates of medieval Leicester. At the time it was one of the most prestigious of England&#x27;s provincial choral institutions. A musically gifted boy such as Hugh would begin in the choir aged around 8, and would be one of six boys singing plainsong and newer polyphonic pieces at the daily services, alongside the choir of male professional singers. Hugh could have joined the choir school in 1493 and remained there as an additional lay clerk once his voice broke. In 1502 he left for the Oxford University Music School, from which he is recorded as graduating after 8 years of study in 1510, by which time he was probably aged 25.

===Bachelor of Music===
On 27 November 1510 he supplicated for the degree of BMus at Oxford University, proposing for his examination an oration on the volumes of Boethius, and the submission (and performance) of a mass and an antiphon. He stated that he had studied music in the University Music School for eight years. Presumably his study of Boethius was of the 6th century philosopher&#x27;s &quot;De Institutione Musica&quot;, which had been published in Venice in 1491 and 1492 (one of the first musical works to be published). The University records show that his examination was successful, and the University ordered that the University Proctors supervising the examination should retain the two manuscripts. It seems most likely that these were Aston&#x27;s five part &quot;Missa Te Deum Laudamus&quot; and the clearly associated antiphon &quot;Te Deum Laudamus.&quot; Though the original manuscripts are not in Music School archives today, excellent early copies of ca. 1528–30 almost certainly made for Cardinal&#x27;s College (now Christ Church) Oxford are in the Forrest-Heather Part Books now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.

===Return to Leicester===
After 1510 he may have lived in London, and it is suggested that he may have had some association with the court of Henry VIII. In 1517 he is recorded in the Leicester Borough Records Hall Book as being admitted as a &#x27;Freeman and Burgess of the Borough of Leicester&#x27;. The brief entry reads, &quot;Hugo Aston &quot;de eadem&quot; gent&quot;. The &quot;de eadem&quot; means &#x27;of the same&#x27; referring to the column heading &#x27;de Leicester&#x27;, meaning he was born in Leicester. The absence of any qualification shows he was a freeman &#x27;as of right&#x27;, as the son of a freeman. The term &#x27;gent&#x27; (Gentleman) is unusual as it would normally state a person&#x27;s trade or profession. Rather than implying nobility, in this instance it would seem to be acknowledging his status as a university graduate. In 1520/21 he was paid by the Dean and Chapter of the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick, to advise on the purchase and installing of a new organ. With the pre-1528 Newarke College account books missing from the records, the earliest documentation for Aston&#x27;s role as choir-master at Leicester is found in the Lincoln Diocesan Records. Aston was called to give testimony as part of Bishop Longland&#x27;s Visitation on 27 &amp; 28 November 1525. Amongst the long list of injunctions contained in the Bishop&#x27;s response was a requirement that the Dean and Canons appoint choral vicars of proper competence and suitability, and not appoint &#x27;unteachable&#x27; boy choristers. Also during 1525 the same Bishop Longland had recommended Aston to Cardinal Wolsey as a candidate for founder director of music at his new Cardinal&#x27;s College, Oxford, (now Christ Church College and Cathedral). However Longland had to report that Hugh Aston preferred to stay in Leicester &#x27;considering his greate wages which he alligith in perpetuity&#x27; (i.e. he claims they were promised to him for life). Wolsey appointed John Taverner to the Oxford post instead. 

From 1531 there are Duchy of Lancaster account books showing that Hugh Aston&#x27;s &#x27;greate wages&#x27; amounted to £10 per year, and rose to £12 from 1539. His appointment in Leicester was that of &quot;Keeper of the Organs and Magister Choristerorum&quot; (Master of the Choristers) at the major Royal foundation, the Hospital and College of St Mary of the Annunciation. This was first established by Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster in 1330, and re-endowed and substantially enlarged by his son Henry, 4th Earl and later 1st Duke of Lancaster under a Charter of 24 March 1355/6. Later known as The Newarke, the institution had a Dean and twelve Canons (later termed Prebends), thirteen Vicars-Choral, four Lay Clerks and six (boy) choristers. By the late 15th century it had achieved a high status and musical reputation and had acquired the privilege, apparently shared only with the Chapels Royal, of having the right to recruit outstanding musicians and singers from other institutions without their consent, in other words to poach the very best musicians of the country. From 1528

The Charters required among many other things the use of the Salisbury (&quot;Sarum&quot;) Rite, a daily sung Mass in honour of Our Lady, and also the singing of Matins, a High Mass and Vespers on more than two dozen high feasts, led by the Dean in Choir, so there would have been a heavy musical programme for the choir of around sixteen (including at least some of the Vicars) and its musical director. In addition to his annual wage Aston, also referred to in some documents as a singer and organist, was entitled to receive further significant payments for additional services such as funerals. He also appears to have been retained by six other Midland religious houses: Sulby and Pipewell in Northamptonshire; the abbeys at Coventry and Kenilworth in Warwickshire, and the Leicestershire abbeys of Launde and Leicester Abbey.

===Dissolution===
Just 18 months after Aston&#x27;s retirement the final dissolution of the Newarke Choral Foundation took place at Easter 1548. The almshouse with its chapel was re-branded as &#x27;Trinity Hospital&#x27; but the Collegiate Church was demolished along with most of the college buildings. Hugh Aston, on the other hand, continued to live in what appears to have been the official residence of the choir-master. This was a substantial property fronting onto Southgates Street directly opposite the main gate into the Newarke (The Magazine Gateway). On retirement he received not only a £12-a-year pension in respect of his Newarke College office, which was honoured by the state following the Dissolution, but he also received further pensions totalling £6 13s. 4d. in respect of loss of office at the six other suppressed choral institutions. Furthermore, he had been granted a life tenancy on the Southgates property, with its with barns, gardens and paddocks, and his wife, Elizabeth Aston, had been awarded the right to a 21 year lease to commence on the death of her husband. With the lease transferred to their son Robert Aston, and subsequent renegotiations with the Duchy of Lancaster and the Burough Council, the property remained the family home until at least 1595 and possibly into their grandson&#x27;s time in the early 17th century.

===Civic responsibilities===
Before 1530 Hugh Aston was already representing the Southgates Ward in which he lived as a member of the Town council and later as a Borough Alderman, and by 1550 the Ward was even being referred to in the Leicester Borough Records as &quot;the Ward of Mr Hugh Aston&quot;. From 1532 he was a Justice of the Peace, Coroner for two years, Auditor of Accounts for a total of 16 years, Mayor for 1541–1542, one of the two Members of Parliament for the Borough for the 1555 Parliament, and remained an Alderman to his death.

==Commemorations==
The exact date of his death is not known, but he was buried on 17 November 1558 in the parish church for the Southgates Ward, St Margaret&#x27;s. 

;Anniversary service: On 15 November 2008 a 450th anniversary Commemorative Service was held in St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Leicester, featuring two of Aston’s surviving antiphons, two known keyboard pieces and much of the Sarum Rite plainsong music for the Requiem Mass of the pre-Reformation Sarum liturgy, which had been restored by Queen Mary.

;Hugh Aston Building: Most of the buildings of the medieval Hospital and College of the Newarke, including the Collegiate Church much admired by Leland during his visit in ca. 1535, were demolished soon after the Dissolution. Today the campus of De Montfort University covers almost the whole collegiate site. In March 2015 the University opened a new DMU Heritage Centre incorporating the remaining ruins of the Church of the Annunciation together with displays explaining the history of the Newarke area. On 17 March 2010 Patrick McKenna, founder and Chief Executive of Ingenious Media, declared open De Montfort University&#x27;s new £35 million Faculty of Business and Law, adjacent to the great Gateway to The Newarke and only 100 metres or so from the site of Aston&#x27;s Hangman&#x27;s Lane house: this new building is called the Hugh Aston Building. The event was also marked by performances by singers from the choir of the Holy Cross Dominican Priory, New Walk, Leicester (directed by David Cowen) of sections from Aston&#x27;s &quot;Te Deum Mass&quot; and &quot;Te Deum&quot;, two of Aston&#x27;s keyboard compositions, and some of the &#x27;Sarum Rite&#x27; medieval plainsong for 17 March – St. Patrick&#x27;s Day.

== Works ==
Four sacred vocal compositions by Aston survive substantially complete:

Masses
* &quot;Missa Te Deum&quot; (five voices)
* &quot;Missa Videte manus meas&quot; (six voices)
*&quot;Gaude mater matris Christe&quot; (five voices)
*&quot;Te Deum laudamus&quot; (five voices)
Antiphones:
* &quot;Ave Maria Ancilla Trinitatus&quot;
* &quot;Ave Maria divae matris Annae&quot;
* &quot;Gaude Mater Matris Christi&quot; (some copies have &quot;Gaude Virgo Matris Christi&quot;)
* &quot;O baptista vates Christi&quot; (five voice: SATTB, reconstructed)
* &quot;Te Matrem Dei Laudamus&quot;

* Devotional song: &quot;Ave Domina Sancta&quot;

Keyboard Music
* Hornepype
* My Lady Carey&#x27;s Dompe (attrib)
* The Short Measure of My Lady Wynkfyld&#x27;s Rownde Again (attrib)
Other compositions may survive in fragments. His keyboard music, although with few surviving examples, showed an unusually progressive use of idiomatic keyboard: his &quot;Hornepype&quot; in particular is often cited as an example of early idiomatic keyboard writing. Some other famous early keyboard pieces have been attributed to him on stylistic grounds, including the often-recorded and anthologized &quot;My Lady Careys Dompe&quot; and &quot;My Lady Wynkfyld&#x27;s Rownde&quot;.

A lost piece, known as &#x27;Hugh Aston&#x27;s Grounde&#x27;, was copied by William Byrd in his &quot;Hugh Aston&#x27;s Maske&quot;

<text>Guastalla (Guastallese: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Reggio Emilia in Emilia-Romagna, Italy.

==Geography==
Guastalla is situated in the Po Valley, and lies on the banks of the Po River. Guastalla is located at around from the cities of Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Mantua.

In addition to the town of Guastalla itself, the &quot;comune&quot; also includes the hamlets of San Giacomo, San Girolamo, San Martino, San Rocco, and Tagliata.

==History==

The area of Guastalla was probably settled by Etruscans as early as the 7th century BC, but the name of the city is mentioned for the first time in 864 AD. Of Lombard origin, the city was ruled by the Torelli family from 1406 to 1539, when it became the capital of a duchy under the Gonzaga family and housed artists like Guercino and Torquato Tasso. From 1621 to 1748, it was part of its own Duchy of Guastalla. Then with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the city became part of the Duchy of Parma, Piacenza e Guastalla, to which it belonged until 1847, when it was inherited by the Duke of Modena. Since the unification of Italy in 1861, Guastalla has been a part of Italy proper.

=== Industry ===
SMEG (from Smalterie Metallurgiche Emiliane Guastalla), a major manufacturer of high-end domestic appliances, was founded by Vittorio Bertazzoni in Guastalla in 1948, where it still has its headquarters.

==Main sights==
Guastalla town:
*The Cathedral (16th century) by Francesco da Volterra.
*The Ducal Palace of Guastalla (1567).
*The Civic Theatre Ruggero Ruggeri (1671).
*The Town Hall.
*The octagonal Oratory of &quot;Madonna della Concezione&quot;.
*The church of &quot;Santa Maria dei Servi&quot;, designed by Francesco da Volterra. Noteworthy in the interior is a &quot;Deposition&quot;, canvas by Giuseppe Maria Crespi.
*The Civic Tower (18th century), in the location where once was the Spanish Castle

Around Guastalla:
*The Romanesque Oratory of St. George (probably from the 9th century).
*The Basilica of St. Peter at Pieve di Guastalla, which was seat of two Roman Catholic councils. It houses an ancient baptismal font (9th century) and painted terracotta portraying the &quot;Madonna with Child&quot;, attributed to Guido Mazzoni.

<text>Qwest Records was an American record label run by Quincy Jones.

==History==
Qwest Records was established by Quincy Jones in 1980 as a joint venture with Warner Bros. Records, although Jones remained under contract with A&amp;M Records until 1981. The first release on Qwest was George Benson&#x27;s 1980 album, &quot;Give Me the Night&quot;, shared with Warner Bros. Records, as Benson was under contract with it. Patti Austin, Jones&#x27;s goddaughter, was one of the first artists to sign with Qwest, and the label released her album, &quot;Every Home Should Have One&quot;, in 1981.

While Qwest Records primarily catered to the R&amp;B market, it also welcomed a diverse range of artists. This included Frank Sinatra (whom Jones produced in the 1960s), Tevin Campbell, Radiance, and the British alternative dance group New Order (formerly known as Joy Division, its earlier post-punk incarnation). Jones told &quot;NME&quot; in a May 1990 interview:


In the 1990s, Qwest Records demonstrated its adaptability by venturing into the burgeoning hip-hop music scene. It discovered and nurtured R&amp;B artist Tamia, who went on to enjoy a successful career. The label also signed the gospel group the Winans in 1985 and Táta Vega, who released &quot;Now I See&quot; through Qwest. Robert Stewart, a performer on the Pulitzer Prize-winning Wynton Marsalis recording &quot;Blood on the Fields&quot;, was signed to the label in 1994. His two albums for Qwest, &quot;In the Gutta&quot; and &quot;The Force&quot;, were met with critical acclaim.

Qwest was absorbed by Warner Bros. Records in 2000, with its roster of artists either transferred to its parent label (or its sister labels) or dropped. The Warner Music Group currently owns the Qwest catalogue. In 2006, select titles by Jones were licensed to Universal Music Group for distribution and reissues. Jones himself died on November 3, 2024.

<text>David Allen Wright (born December 20, 1982) is an American former professional baseball third baseman who spent his entire 14-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the New York Mets. Chosen by the Mets in the 2001 MLB draft, he made his MLB debut on July 21, 2004 at Shea Stadium. Wright was nicknamed &quot;Captain America&quot; after his performance in the 2013 World Baseball Classic where he led the tournament with 10 RBI and a .438 batting average.

Wright is a seven-time All-Star, a two-time Gold Glove Award winner, a two-time Silver Slugger Award winner, and a member of the 30–30 club. One of the most beloved players in franchise history, Wright is the Mets&#x27; all time leader in career plate appearances and holds many other franchise records for position players. He was named captain of the Mets in 2013, becoming the fourth captain in the team&#x27;s history. Wright is the third player to play in at least 10 MLB seasons and play his entire MLB career with the Mets.

Throughout the latter half of Wright&#x27;s career, he was plagued by injuries, most notably spinal stenosis, as well as additional ailments in his neck and shoulder. After missing significant time from 2015 to 2018 and receiving word from doctors that his spinal stenosis would not improve, Wright announced that 2018 would be his final season as an active player. Wright finished his major league career with a .296 career batting average, 242 home runs, and 970 runs batted in. Upon completion of his playing career, Wright was named a special advisor in the Mets front office.

==Early life==

Wright was born in Norfolk, Virginia, the oldest of four sons of Rhon, a police officer in the Norfolk Police Department, and Elisa Wright. Wright grew up a Mets fan due to his proximity to the Class AAA Norfolk Tides, whose stadium was ten minutes from his home. Wright took hitting lessons alongside fellow future Major Leaguer Michael Cuddyer in elementary school and played on teams with Ryan Zimmerman, Mark Reynolds, B.J. Upton and Justin Upton during high school. Wright played baseball at Hickory High School in Chesapeake, Virginia. He committed to play college baseball at Georgia Tech before his senior year of high school. As a high school senior, he had a .538 batting average.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
The New York Mets selected Wright in the 2001 MLB draft during the supplemental round as compensation for the Mets&#x27; loss of Mike Hampton to the Colorado Rockies in free agency. Wright was selected after future teammate Aaron Heilman who had been selected in the first round. According to then-Mets manager Bobby Valentine, Wright had caught the attention of coach Tom Robson who had actually been sent &quot;down to Virginia to scout someone else.&quot;

Wright progressed steadily in his first three years of minor league play, winning the Sterling award for best player on the class A St. Lucie Mets in 2003. In 2004, he quickly rose from the Double-A Binghamton Mets to the Triple-A Norfolk Tides to the major leagues.

===New York Mets===
====2004====
On July 21, 2004, Wright made his major league debut starting at third base against the Montreal Expos at Shea Stadium. The next day, Wright picked up his first career hit, a double off of Expos&#x27; pitcher Zach Day. On July 26, Wright hit his first major league home run, a solo blast off of pitcher John Patterson. Wright finished his rookie season with a .293 batting average, 14 home runs and 40 RBI in 263 at-bats in 69 games, and was voted as the This Year in Baseball Awards Rookie of the Year.

====2005====
Wright made an over-the-shoulder barehanded catch during the seventh inning of a game at Petco Park against the San Diego Padres on August 9, 2005. With one out in the inning, Brian Giles hit a broken-bat blooper beyond the edge of the outfield grass. Wright, retreating quickly with his back to home plate, extended his bare right hand and caught the ball cleanly while crashing to the field. Wright maintained control of the ball after landing hard on the outfield grass. The sellout crowd at Petco Park acknowledged the splendor of the catch with a standing ovation lasting several minutes. This play was voted the &quot;This Year in Baseball Play of the Year.&quot;

In 2005, the 22-year-old Wright played in 160 games and batted .306 with 27 home runs, 102 RBIs, 99 runs scored, 42 doubles, and 17 stolen bases, leading the team in average, runs, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, RBI, doubles, and finishing second in home runs to Cliff Floyd (34). Wright was also in the top 10 in the National League for average, hits, total bases, RBI, extra-base hits, and runs. However, his 24 errors tied him with Troy Glaus for the most errors by a third baseman in the major leagues.

====2006====

In 2006, Wright was named National League Co-Player of the Week for June 12–18 along with teammate José Reyes. For the month, Wright batted .327 with 10 home runs and 29 RBIs.

Wright also provided his share of heroics throughout the 2006 season. His first game-winning hit occurred on May 5 with a 2-out double just out of the reach of a chasing Andruw Jones in the bottom of the 14th inning off Jorge Sosa to defeat the Atlanta Braves, 8–7. Two weeks later on May 19, he hit a walk-off single off Yankees closer Mariano Rivera that just sailed over the head of center fielder Johnny Damon as the Mets rallied to beat the Yankees in the first game of the 2006 Subway Series, 7–6. He capped off the month on Memorial Day, May 29, with a single to the wall in left-center field off Arizona Diamondbacks closer José Valverde scoring José Reyes from first base as the Mets defeated Arizona, 8–7. Wright also made a game-saving stop at third base of a would-be game-tying single by Mike Lieberthal for the final out of a 4–3 Mets victory over Philadelphia on August 5.

Wright was voted on to his first MLB All-Star Game as the starting third baseman for the NL. During the 2006 season, Wright collected 74 RBIs before the All-Star break, breaking the Mets record previously held by Mike Piazza, who had 72 RBIs in 2000. Wright also participated in the 2006 Home Run Derby, reaching the final round but finishing second to Ryan Howard of the Philadelphia Phillies. He hit 22 home runs in the contest, including 16 in the first round, the third-highest total in any one round in the history of the Home Run Derby. The following night, he hit a home run in his first All-Star Game at-bat off American League starting pitcher Kenny Rogers.

Wright ranked among the club&#x27;s top three hitters in all offensive categories for the 2006 Mets, who were the second most run-scoring team in the National League. Fans at Shea Stadium have routinely greeted Wright&#x27;s performances with chants of &quot;M-V-P, M-V-P.&quot; According to then-teammate Tom Glavine, &quot;He&#x27;s probably been our most clutch hitter over the first half of the season and he&#x27;s certainly thrown his hat into the MVP talks.&quot;

On August 6, 2006, Wright signed a 6-year, $55 million contract extension with the Mets, as well as a $1.5 million signing bonus. The contract paid him $1 million in 2007, $5 million in 2008, $7.5 million in 2009, $10 million in 2010, $14 million in 2011, and $15 million in 2012. The contract also contained a club option for 2013 worth $16 million. Wright has already announced that he will donate $1.5 million to the Mets Foundation throughout the course of this contract.

The Mets clinched the NL East title in 2006 and returned to the playoffs for the first time since 2000. Wright finished the 2006 season batting .311 with 26 home runs, 116 RBI, 40 doubles, and 20 stolen bases in 154 games played. However, he struggled in his first postseason, going 4-for-25 (.160) in the Mets&#x27; NLCS loss to the St. Louis Cardinals, and batting .216 in 10 postseason games.

After the season, Wright participated in the 2006 MLB Japan All-Star Series along with teammates José Reyes, Julio Franco, and John Maine.

====2007====
As of April 21, 2007, Wright had a hitting streak of 26 regular-season games; the previous team record was 24, held by Mike Piazza and Hubie Brooks. He had a hit in the 12 final regular-season games of the 2006 season, and had a hit in all of the first 14 games of the 2007 season. Wright&#x27;s hit streak of 26 regular-season games ended on April 21, 2007, against the Atlanta Braves at Shea Stadium.

On September 16, 2007, Wright became the 29th player in baseball history to join the 30–30 club, after hitting a 7th inning solo home run against the Philadelphia Phillies at Shea Stadium. He is only the third player to reach this milestone before his 25th birthday, and only the third Met to reach this milestone in club history, the other two being Howard Johnson and Darryl Strawberry.

Wright finished the 2007 season with a .325 batting average, 30 home runs, 107 RBI, and 34 stolen bases. He was awarded the 2007 Gold Glove and the Silver Slugger Award at third base. Wright also was fourth in the NL MVP voting receiving 182 votes.

====2008====

Wright began the year with two doubles, including a bases-clearing double, in finishing 2–4 with three RBIs in the Mets&#x27; Opening Day victory over the Marlins, 7–2. With the RBIs, Wright already halfway matched his RBI production from the preceding April. In the final game of the series, Wright went 3–5 with a home run. On April 13, 2008, Wright hit his 100th career home run, a solo shot off of Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Jeff Suppan. 

On August 7, Wright hit the first walk-off home run of his career against the San Diego Padres, giving the Mets a 5–3 victory.

On November 5, Wright was announced as the recipient of the Gold Glove Award for third basemen. It was the second consecutive year in which Wright won the award. His teammate, Carlos Beltrán, also won the award for center fielders. He also won his second Silver Slugger Award.

On December 22, Wright was announced as a member of Team USA in the 2009 World Baseball Classic (WBC) to be held in March 2009. The third base position was taken by Alex Rodriguez in the 2006 WBC.

Wright finished seventh in the voting for the 2008 NL MVP award after finishing the season with a .302 batting average, 33 home runs and 124 RBI.

====2009====
On April 13, 2009, Wright hit the first Mets home run in Citi Field history on Opening Day. The three-run home run was hit off San Diego Padres pitcher Walter Silva in the 5th inning.

In mid-August, when 10 Mets players were on the disabled list, Wright was added to the list after sustaining an injury on August 15. Wright suffered a concussion when he was hit in the head with a fastball by San Francisco Giants pitcher Matt Cain. He was admitted to the Hospital for Special Surgery, where he underwent a precautionary CT scan, which turned out negative. The following day he left the hospital diagnosed with post-concussion symptoms. He was then placed on the disabled list for the first time in his career.

Despite the injury to Wright, Mets General Manager Omar Minaya stated that there were no plans to shut him down for the remainder of the season. In fact, Wright was activated from the disabled list on September 1 and started at third base against the Colorado Rockies that evening. In that game, Wright wore a new style of batting helmet (the Rawlings S100). He abandoned that helmet after wearing it in that one game. Wright explained that he found the helmet uncomfortable. &quot;It&#x27;s the last thing I need to be worrying about in the box is trying to shove it on my head. So I wanted to go back to the old one and just wait to see if there&#x27;s going to be any adjustments made.&quot; Wright experienced a decline in production after a potent campaign in 2008. His home run total dropped to 10, while his RBI total fell to 72, after hitting 33 home runs and 124 RBIs the previous season.

====2010====
Wright, along with José Reyes, arrived at the Mets&#x27; spring training camp in Port St. Lucie, Florida two weeks early to get a head start on preparing themselves after a disappointing 2009 campaign. Wright came into camp heavier than he was in previous seasons, adding more muscle to his body.
On Opening Day, Wright hit a two-run home run off of Marlins&#x27; pitcher Josh Johnson in his first at-bat of the season. On April 27 in the second game of a doubleheader against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Wright hit the 1,000th hit of his career against pitcher Ramón Troncoso in the bottom of the 5th inning as he hit a two-out RBI single scoring center fielder Ángel Pagán and giving the Mets a 4–3 lead. In the following inning, Wright hit a three-run triple to the right-center field wall, scoring Pagán, Luis Castillo, and José Reyes, and giving the Mets a 10–3 lead at the time. The Mets won the game 10–5. On May 20, he hit a three-run double after Mets manager Jerry Manuel gave Wright a day off. By June 25, Wright had 12 home runs, which led the team, and was batting .294 with 57 RBIs to lead the N.L. On July 4, Wright was named the starting third baseman for the National League in the 2010 MLB All-Star Game, making it Wright&#x27;s fifth consecutive All-Star appearance. On July 6, Wright was named the June 2010 National League Player of the Month after he hit .404 with 11 doubles, 6 home runs, and 29 RBIs. On July 13, Wright collected 2 hits and a stolen base in the 81st All-Star Game in Anaheim, bringing him to 6-for-13 in All-Star Game at-bats and tying him for fifth all-time in All-Star Game batting average. As of August 20, he more than doubled his home run total from 2009.

Wright finished the 2010 season with a .283 batting average, .354 on-base percentage, 29 home runs, 103 RBIs, 69 walks, and 19 stolen bases.

====2011====
On April 5, 2011, Wright singled against the Phillies&#x27; Cole Hamels for his 90th career game-winning RBI, surpassing Mike Piazza for the most in Mets history. Then on May 16, after undergoing examination by team doctors, it was announced Wright had a stress fracture in his lower back. The injury (caused by a diving tag on the Houston Astros&#x27; Carlos Lee) forced him to spend more than two months on the disabled list. Wright was activated from the DL on July 22. That day, he went 2-for-5 and had two RBIs and scored two runs against the Marlins. In his first series coming back from the DL, Wright hit 6-for-14, with one home run, three doubles and six RBIs. Wright enjoyed a career first on August 7, against the Atlanta Braves, playing shortstop for the first time in his professional career due to injuries to José Reyes (hamstring) and Daniel Murphy (MCL). In only 102 games, Wright finished the season with a .254 batting average, .345 on-base percentage, 14 home runs, 61 RBIs, 52 walks, and 13 stolen bases.

====2012====

On April 5, Wright went 2-for-3 with a walk on as the Mets&#x27; Opening Day third-baseman against the Braves, where Wright drove in Andrés Torres with a single for the game-winning run in the 6th inning off of Tommy Hanson, giving the Mets the 1–0 win. Less than a week later, on April 11, Wright fractured his right pinkie while diving into first base on a pick-off attempt. After missing just three games, Wright returned to the lineup, going 3-for-5 against the Phillies. Then on April 25, Wright hit a two-run home run in a 5–1 victory against the Miami Marlins, giving him 735 career RBIs, passing Darryl Strawberry for the most in Mets franchise history. Wright broke another franchise record on June 5, when he hit a solo-shot off of Washington Nationals pitcher Jordan Zimmermann, driving himself in and reaching 736 runs. The previous record-holder was José Reyes at 735 runs. On July 1, it was announced that Wright had made his 6th All-Star team, but as a backup to Pablo Sandoval. Wright led the All-Star vote for most of the year but was overtaken in the last week of voting.

For the first half of the season, Wright was either atop or close to the top of the league in both batting average and on-base percentage, and led NL third basemen in average, OBP, slugging, hits and runs scored. After the All-Star break, the Mets had their worst stretch to that point in the season, losing six straight, but on July 19, Wright hit two home runs and had five RBIs to help the Mets end their losing streak. He hit his 200th career home run in a loss on August 24 to the Houston Astros. On September 25, Wright tied the all-time Mets hit record with Ed Kranepool with 1,418 hits in a game at home against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Then on September 26, Wright surpassed Kranepool as Mets all-time hit record holder with an infield single also at home against the Pirates.

After the season, Wright finished 6th in the voting for the 2012 NL MVP Award.

====Contract extension====
On November 30, 2012, Ed Coleman and WFAN reported that Wright and the Mets agreed to a seven-year, $138 million contract extension (7 years for $122 million plus a club option for $16 million that the club picked up for the 2013 season). The contract became official on December 4 after Wright passed a physical. Wright was represented in negotiations by Seth and Sam Levinson of ACES Inc.

Wright&#x27;s $138 million deal was contrary to the Mets budget-conscious policy of not giving huge contracts to players in their 30s; nonetheless general manager Sandy Alderson made an exception as he viewed Wright as a leader and role model, both on and off the field. At the same time, many agents and front-office executives suggested that had Wright waited a year and became a free agent, he could have received a deal close to $200 million. Although it had been six years since the Mets&#x27; last playoff appearance and four years since their last winning season, Alderson managed to persuade Wright to stay as the Mets&#x27; farm system had young talented pitchers.

Wright&#x27;s contract had deferments which would be paid out through 2025. The Mets obtained injury insurance on the contract which kicked in after he missed 60 days, allowing the team to recoup 75 percent of his salary while he is unable to play.

====2013====
After a spring training game on March 21, 2013, the Mets announced that Wright had been named the fourth team captain in Mets history, joining Keith Hernandez, Gary Carter, and John Franco.

Wright got his 1,500th career hit on June 18 against the Atlanta Braves off of pitcher Cory Gearrin.

Wright was named the National League&#x27;s Home Run Derby team captain for the 2013 MLB All-Star Game. He selected Carlos González, Michael Cuddyer, and Bryce Harper as the other three participants for the National League. González, who was injured at the time, was later replaced by Pedro Álvarez. Wright would hit five home runs in the Derby, but would not move on.

On July 6, Wright was named the starting third baseman for the National League team in the 2013 MLB All-Star Game. In the All-Star Game, Wright went 1-for-3. He also became the fourth Mets player to appear in at least seven All-Star games.

On August 3, Wright was placed on the 15-day disabled list a day after he strained his right hamstring. Upon his return from the disabled list, Wright hit two home runs in his first two games, surpassing Mike Piazza for the second-most home runs hit by a player in a Mets uniform, behind Darryl Strawberry. Wright played in 112 games in 2013, batting .307 with 18 home runs, 58 RBIs and 17 steals.

====2014====

Wright was chosen as the &quot;Face of MLB&quot; in a contest online in February 2014. He narrowly beat out Oakland Athletics infielder Eric Sogard.

Wright finished second in All-Star voting for third base to the Brewers&#x27; Aramis Ramírez, making it only the third time in 10 seasons he had been left out. Second baseman Daniel Murphy represented the Mets at the 2014 MLB All-Star Game.

Wright&#x27;s 2014 performance declined from previous years. He hit at a .269 clip, his lowest batting average since his 2011 season was shortened due to injury. Wright&#x27;s .269/.324/.374 slash line was attributed to a recurring shoulder injury. Early in the season, he sustained a left rotator cuff contusion which slowed his offensive production and hurt his defense. Wright also finished the year playing in 134 games with 8 home runs, 63 RBI, and committed 15 errors, tied for most on the team.

====2015====
On April 14, 2015, Wright suffered a strained right hamstring while stealing second base. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list. He was later diagnosed with spinal stenosis, and was expected to return towards the end of the season. Wright was placed on the 60-day DL for his injury on July 24, to clear up space on the 40-man roster. On August 10, the Mets sent Wright on a rehab assignment to the St. Lucie Mets.

Following Chase Utley&#x27;s trade from the Philadelphia Phillies to the Los Angeles Dodgers in August, Wright became the longest-tenured active player to have played his entire career with one team. His 1,516 games with the Mets had previously only trailed Utley&#x27;s 1,551 games with the Phillies.

Wright returned from his injury for the Mets&#x27; August 24 game in Philadelphia. In his first at-bat, he hit a home run off Phillies pitcher Adam Morgan, the first of a club record eight home runs the Mets would hit in a 16–7 victory. His return helped propel the Mets to the 2015 World Series against the Kansas City Royals. In his only World Series appearance, he committed an error in the 14th inning that led to the winning run as the Royals took a 5–4 victory in Game 1. In Game 3, he went 2-for-4 with 4 RBIs including his only World Series home run, off of Yordano Ventura as part of the Mets&#x27; 9–3 victory in their only win of the series. Wright played in only 38 games for the Mets in 2015, batting a slash line of .289/.379/.434 with a career-low 5 home runs and 17 RBI.

====2016====
As a result of his spinal stenosis, Wright had to complete an extensive pre-game workout routine consisting of physical therapy, exercise, and some minimal batting and fielding drills. The entire process takes about 4–5 hours. On May 21, 2016, Wright hit a bases-loaded single off of Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Michael Blazek to break a tie in the bottom of the 9th inning and give the Mets a 5–4 victory. On June 3, Wright was placed on the disabled list due to a herniated disc in his neck. On June 16, he underwent neck surgery to repair the disc. Wright missed the remainder of the 2016 season, having played a career-low 37 games and batted .226/.350/.438 with 7 home runs and 14 RBI, the lowest batting average and RBI of his career.

====2017====
On February 28, 2017, after rehabbing from his neck surgery, Wright was diagnosed with a right shoulder impingement which, at the time, jeopardized his ability to play on Opening Day. He was, however, allowed to continue hitting as the injury only affected his ability to throw. This was yet another serious injury for Wright, which prompted people to ask General Manager Sandy Alderson if he thought that Wright would ever be able to play competitively again. He responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re at that point, the point where that concern is at a more heightened level. This is all part of the process of rehabilitation from the neck surgery and it&#x27;s taking longer than usual. I&#x27;m sure David would have hoped and we would hope – but it&#x27;s all part of the process.&quot; On September 4, it was revealed that Wright would undergo rotator cuff surgery on his right shoulder, which prevented him from playing in the majors all year in 2017. He underwent surgery the following day.

====2018====

On March 13, 2018, Wright experienced even more setbacks due to lingering back and shoulder injuries. At that point, he was shut down from baseball activities completely. On June 1, he was cleared to start baseball activities again. On June 25, he participated in batting practice at Citi Field. On August 12, Wright was slated to play five innings with the Single-A St. Lucie team at Clearwater. On August 28, Wright was promoted to AAA Las Vegas to continue his rehab, and singled in his first at bat.

On September 13, the Mets announced that Wright would be activated from the disabled list for the Mets&#x27; last homestand of the season and start the September 29 game against the Miami Marlins, his last appearance before retirement. On September 28, he grounded out as a pinch hitter against the Marlins, his first MLB appearance in over two years. On the following day, Wright batted 0-for-1 with a walk and fielded one ground ball before being removed in the fifth inning to a lengthy ovation by fans and players alike. The Mets went on to win the ballgame, 1–0, with Austin Jackson hitting a walk-off double in the 13th inning. After the game, Wright addressed the Citi Field crowd, thanking them for supporting him throughout his career.

===Career statistics===
In 1585 games over 14 seasons, Wright posted a .296 batting average (1777-for-5998) with 949 runs scored, 390 doubles, 26 triples, 242 home runs, 970 runs batted in, 196 stolen bases, 762 walks, .376 on-base percentage, .491 slugging percentage, and .867 on-base plus slugging. Defensively, he recorded a .955 fielding percentage as a third baseman. In 24 postseason games, he hit only .198 (18-for-91) with 5 doubles, 2 home runs, 13 RBI, and 15 walks.

=== Number retirement ===
On December 13, 2024, the Mets announced that Wright&#x27;s number 5 will officially be retired at Citi Field and will be inducted to the Mets Hall of Fame on July 19, 2025. 

==World Baseball Classic==

Wright was selected to play third base for the United States in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. In the second round, with the United States facing elimination against Puerto Rico, Wright delivered a 9th inning walk-off hit against Fernando Cabrera to win the game for the Americans 6-5. The win guaranteed Team USA a spot in the semifinal round against Japan.

He was again selected to play third base in the 2013 World Baseball Classic. In the 2013 WBC, Wright hit a 5th-inning grand slam in the United States&#x27;s game against Italy to put the team ahead 6-2. It was the second time a United States player hit a grand slam in WBC play. In the second-round opener against Puerto Rico, Wright had 5 RBIs. Wright ended the tournament with the most total RBIs of any player and earned the nickname &quot;Captain America&quot;. Wright sat out during the US loss to the Dominican Republic in the following game, citing soreness. He was later diagnosed with sore ribs and sent back to New York for further examination, ending his participation for the rest of the 2013 tournament. The US team went on to lose to Puerto Rico 4–3, resulting in an elimination. Wright was selected as the third baseman for the All-WBC team, the only American player to earn the honor.

==Personal life==
Wright has maintained homes in Manhattan, Manhattan Beach, California and Chesapeake, Virginia wherein he owns a boxer dog named Homer. His clubhouse nicknames include &quot;Visine&quot; and &quot;Hollywood&quot;.

In May 2007, Vitamin Water was sold to The Coca-Cola Company for $4.1 billion. As part of his endorsement deal, Wright was given 0.5% of the company, and thus netted approximately $20 million from the deal.

After dating model Molly Beers for several years, Wright announced in January 2013 that he and Beers were engaged to be married during the holidays. The couple were married in La Jolla, California, on December 26, 2013. They have two daughters and a son.

Wright&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Captain&quot;, was published on October 13, 2020, by Dutton-Penguin Books. It was co-written by Wright and Anthony DiComo, who is a Mets beat writer for MLB.com.

===Charitable organizations===
====David Wright Foundation====
In 2005, Wright began his own charitable organization, the David Wright Foundation. Its mission is to increase awareness about multiple sclerosis and to raise money for multiple sclerosis organizations and projects. The Foundation hosted its first annual at the New York Stock Exchange Members&#x27; Club on December 16, 2005, donating the proceeds to two multiple sclerosis centers.

During the 2009 season, Wright and New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter represented their foundations in a competition sponsored by Delta Air Lines. Jeter had the higher batting average and received $100,000 for his foundation from Delta while Wright&#x27;s foundation received $50,000.

====Big League Impact====
Wright is the New York City host for Big League Impact, an eight-city fantasy football network created and led by longtime St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright. In 2015, the organization raised more than $1 million in total for various charitable organizations.

==Media appearances==
Delta Air Lines named an MD-88 airplane &quot;The Wright Flight&quot;, after Wright. The plane&#x27;s name, along with Wright&#x27;s signature and jersey number (5), are next to the boarding door. The plane shuttles between New York, Boston and Washington. Wright is noted for his unaffected politeness and work ethic. He has been known to help participate with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America. He has developed a reputation for arriving very early to the park for games and being uncommonly accommodating with fans and reporters.

Wright was featured on the cover of &quot;MLB 07: The Show&quot;, as well as a TV commercial advertisement for the game on the PlayStation 3 game console. He has also appeared in a television commercial for Fathead, promoting the company&#x27;s wall graphics.

In 2006, Wright appeared on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; with then-teammate Cliff Floyd. He also made an appearance on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on July 12, 2006. That same day he appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; along with Mets teammates Carlos Beltrán, Paul Lo Duca, Carlos Delgado, and José Reyes.

On January 3, 2008, Wright appeared on &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; to purchase hot dogs for charity.

Wright is a celebrity spokesman for Ford in the New York/New Jersey market.

<doc id="1195443" wikidata="Q1156521" url="?curid=1195443" title="Tackey &amp; Tsubasa">
<text>were a Japanese idol duo consisting of Hideaki Takizawa and Tsubasa Imai from the Japanese talent agency Johnny &amp; Associates. Takizawa, nicknamed &quot;Tackey&quot; (sometimes spelled as its literal romanization, ), is best known for his drama works, and Tsubasa for his dancing ability. They have also been musically successful with hit singles such as &quot;Venus&quot; and &quot;Yume Monogatari&quot;. Their works are produced by Avex Trax.

==Career==

===Pre-debut===
Before their debut, Tackey and Tsubasa were the top &quot;Juniors&quot; in the Johnny &amp; Associates, a company which specializes in male teen idols led by Johnny Kitagawa. They started out as backdancers for better known teen idols in their label such as KinKi Kids (who also had not yet debuted at the time) in 1995, when both were 13 years old. They have hosted the Japanese variety shows, &quot;Gakibara Teikoku 2000&quot; and &quot;Music Enta&quot;. Besides hosting, the two have starred together in dramas such as &quot;Kaiki Club Ghost Stories&quot; and &quot;Genroku Ryoran&quot;. Initially, both of them did not get along well but during the filming of the NHK series &quot;Genroku Ryoran&quot;, which aired in 1999, they became best friends.

Before their official debut, the two performed together many times. In 1999, Tackey asked Tsubasa to join him in their first duet during the &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Juniors First Concert&quot; in Tokyo, Japan. In April 2000, at the &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Juniors Spring 2002 Concert&quot;, the two performed their second duet together on stage. For this duet, the two designed their outfits, choreography and even their unit symbol (a tarantula). It was after this time that they hosted the two variety shows, &quot;Gakibara Teikoku 2000&quot; and &quot;Music Enta&quot;, from 2000 to the beginning of 2001.

In February 2001, it was announced that the two would be headlining their first tour, called &quot;Takki and Tsubasa 21st-century Showdown with all Johnny&#x27;s Juniors&quot;. Tsubasa designed the costumes and Tackey designed the setting for this very successful tour, and for the first time in JE history, two Johnnys were distinguished in the title of a Junior tour. This led to many people believing that the two would debut as a duo like the KinKi Kids. Instead, at the end of this tour, Johnny Kitagawa announced the two would debut as solo artists in 2002. They were planned to officially debut when they reached 20-years-old due to their popularity.

For the 2002 &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Junior concert&quot; the two were again announced to be the headliners of the tour, and it was during this tour that Tackey mentioned he wanted to debut as a duo with Tsubasa. Tackey asked his fans to organize a letter campaign to Johnny &amp; Associates to let them debut as a duo. The fans then launched a campaign asking people who wanted them to debut together to send postcards and letters to Johnny &amp; Associates, imploring Kitagawa to debut the two boys as a duo instead of as solo artists. The campaign has lasted for about a year, but then on August 1, 2002, Johnny announced that they would debut solo. Their debut solo songs would be entitled &quot;Get Down&quot; (Tsubasa&#x27;s) and &quot;Kiseki&quot; (Tackey&#x27;s). Yet, as a surprise instead, where the official announcement of their debut was to take place, the two announced they would be debuting as a duet after all. The two solo songs of theirs along with the duet song &quot;True Heart&quot; were the first releases from their debut mini-album, Hatachi (meaning 20-years-old in Japanese), which was released on September 11, 2002.

===Post-debut===
To date, Tackey &amp; Tsubasa have released 10 singles, 3 albums and 3 DVDs: a significantly smaller number compared to their counterparts in the company. They have been quite successful; their most recent CD releases have reach the top position on the Japanese music charts. The two also share a very close friendship, being best friends; this aspect of their relationship is obvious through their interactions and interviews and is a very important part of the dynamic between them. Each has incredible strengths and skills, and as a result they complement each other very well. 

Their songs &quot;Crazy Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Mirai Koukai&quot; were one of the opening and ending theme songs respectively for popular Japanese anime &quot;One Piece&quot;. They were also featured in the opening animation of One Piece episode 303, added into the opening segment to their song that was used since episode 284. Also, their song &quot;One Day, One Dream&quot; was on the soundtrack of the Japanese anime &quot;Inuyasha&quot;.

===Hiatus and break-up===
On 3 September 2017, shortly before their 15th anniversary, the duo announced a hiatus. The hiatus began on 17 September, after they performed on &quot;Music Station Ultra Fes 2017&quot;. Tackey &amp; Tsubasa disbanded on 10 September 2018.

<doc id="1195447" wikidata="Q330190" url="?curid=1195447" title="Receipt">
<text>A receipt (also known as a packing list, packing slip, packaging slip, (delivery) docket, shipping list, delivery list, bill of the parcel, [[Manifest (transportation)|manifest]], or customer receipt) is a document acknowledging that something has been received, such as money or property in payment following a sale or other transfer of goods or provision of a service. All receipts must have the date of purchase on them. If the recipient of the payment is legally required to collect sales tax or VAT from the customer, the amount would be added to the receipt, and the collection would be deemed to have been on behalf of the relevant tax authority. In many countries, a retailer is required to include the sales tax or VAT in the displayed price of goods sold, from which the tax amount would be calculated at the point of sale and remitted to the tax authorities in due course. Similarly, amounts may be deducted from amounts payable, as in the case of taxes withheld from wages. On the other hand, tips or other gratuities that are given by a customer, for example in a restaurant, would not form part of the payment amount or appear on the receipt.

In some countries, it is obligatory for a business to provide a receipt to a customer confirming the details of a transaction. In most cases, the recipient of money provides the receipt, but in some cases, the receipt is generated by the payer, as in the case of goods being returned for a refund. A receipt is not the same as an invoice.

There is usually no set form for a receipt, such as a requirement that it be machine-generated. Many point-of-sale terminals or cash registers can automatically produce receipts. Receipts may also be generated by accounting systems, be manually produced, or generated electronically, for example, if there is no face-to-face transaction. To reduce the cost of postage and processing, many businesses do not mail receipts to customers unless specifically requested or required by law, with some transmitting them electronically. Others, to reduce time and paper, may endorse an invoice, account, or statement as &quot;paid&quot;.

==Process==
===Shop receipts===

The practice in most shops at the point of sale is for a salesperson to scan or record the price of a customer&#x27;s proposed purchases, including tax, discounts, credits, and other adjustments. In traditional situations and still in some family businesses today, the salesperson would then show the customer the summary, the invoice, for their agreement; but many shops today bypass this stage. The practice of presenting an invoice is most common in restaurants where a &quot;bill&quot; is presented after a meal.

The salesperson would indicate to the customer (whether by way of an invoice or otherwise) the total amount payable, and the customer would indicate the proposed method of payment of the amount. Payment in cash is regarded as payment of the amount tendered, but payment by store account is not. After processing the payment, the salesperson would then generate in one document an invoice and receipt. If payment was made by a payment card, a payment record would normally also be generated.

The invoice and receipt are the printed record of the transaction and are legal documents. A copy of these documents would normally be handed to the customer, though this step may be dispensed with. In many countries, a retailer may be under a legal obligation to provide a receipt to a customer which shows the details of a transaction and the shop and other information so that the tax authority can check that sales and related taxes are not being hidden. The document may also include messages from the retailer, warranty or return details, special offers, advertisements, or coupons, but these are merely promotional and not part of the formal receipt.

===Other receipts===
Receipts may also be provided for non-retail operations such as banking transactions.

===Barcodes===
Shops that use barcode readers may generate receipts with a barcode of the receipt identification number, which enables a salesperson to scan the barcode and quickly retrieve the details of the original transaction, for example: if a customer seeks to return or exchange goods or there is some other query.

===Customer history===
If linked to a customer shop account, some retailers&#x27; point-of-sale systems also allow the salesperson to see a complete record of the customer&#x27;s buying history. A receipt (or a copy of a receipt) is the proof of purchase usually needed to make a return and often plays a vital part in a company&#x27;s return and exchange policy.

==Recipients==
An invoice is sent to the person responsible for payment, while the shipping list (or packing slip) is included with the recipient’s shipment. The shipping list is included in the shipped box. In some scenarios, the same person will pay the bill and receive the shipment. However, someone may purchase and pay for a product to be delivered to another person (e.g., as a gift).

==Shipping or packing list details==
Shipping or packing lists vary depending on the business and its products. Every shipment to a customer should contain a shipping or packing list with the order date, the products included, and the quantity of each product. Some businesses may include the weight of each product. Many recipients use them as checklists when unpacking their shipments. If something they ordered is missing or shipped in error, they alert the seller.

In &quot;Carlos Soto Sau v AP Moller-Maersk AS&quot;, a packing list for a fish shipment included a reference to a &quot;rejection clause&quot;, which could have been treated as a reference to terms and conditions applicable to the contract of sale, but the person who received the packing list saw its only purpose as being &quot;to confirm the number of cartons and weight of the goods&quot; and, as no issues of ownership were alerted to him, the court held that he was entitled to use the packing list in this way.

==Manual receipts==
Hand-written or hand-completed receipts are more often used for infrequent or irregular transactions, or for transactions conducted in the absence of a terminal, cash register or point of sale: for example, as provided by a landlord to a tenant to record the receipt of rent. They can also be required when company representatives buy goods, because tax deduction rules might require hand signed receipts.

==Related industries==
Organizing receipts and similar financial documents is a multimillion-dollar industry in the United States. Consumers can use both desktop and online software to organize electronic receipts; sometimes, receipts are sent digitally from point of sale devices directly to consumers. The growing trend of digital receipts has led to the launch of new businesses focused on digital receipt management.

<text>Mega Man Legends 2 is a 2000 action-adventure game released by Capcom, acting as the sequel to &quot;Mega Man Legends&quot;. It was released for the PlayStation in 2000 for Japan and North America, and 2001 in Europe. Unchanged Japanese ports of the game were also released for the PC in Japan and parts of Asia in 2003 and for the PlayStation Portable in 2005. The game features Mega Man Volnutt&#x27;s quest to find four keys hidden in the planet in order to aid in the search of the Mother Lode, a legendary treasure thought to be an infinite energy source.

A demo of the game was originally featured in the spin-off &quot;The Misadventures of Tron Bonne&quot;, with its purpose being to show an overview of the gameplay of the title despite having an independent story. Critical reception to &quot;Mega Man Legends 2&quot; has overall been positive with video game publications praising how the graphics and the gameplay improved over the ones from its prequel. Additionally, the game&#x27;s story was praised for how complex it is in comparison to the ones from the original series, but was criticized for its ending.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay in &quot;Mega Man Legends 2&quot; is very similar to that of its predecessor and has a few changes. The player controls the protagonist Mega Man Volnutt in his explorations through ruins and fights against Reaverbots. The ruins, however, are from various islands in contrast to the prequel in which most ruins belonged to Kattelox Island. The player is able to travel to other islands with Roll&#x27;s ship, the Flutter, although he can only enter certain islands by completing different missions. Unlike &quot;Mega Man Legends&quot; in which the player could enter to different ruins by having the approval of Kattelox&#x27;s mayor, here the player must pass different tests in order to win Digger licenses from a specific level. The license allows Mega Man to enter into ruins which are forbidden to lower-class Diggers. Additionally, when winning a license, the Reaverbots&#x27; health is higher, but once they are destroyed, they drop more refractors&#x27; shards which are used in shops to buy items. Mega Man&#x27;s interactions with other characters can also affect the character&#x27;s state depending whether he is good with other people or makes them angry. Mega Man is also able to grab objects or people which help the player to complete missions. Mega Man can also suffer from special damage when fighting Reaverbots or touching fields that damage him such as lava. If the player equips Mega Man with a specific body part, he will become invulnerable to such states. Another addition is the underwater dungeon, in where the objects&#x27; weight is reduced and Mega Man can jump higher. The energy of the special weapons, which are developed by Roll using unusable items, are now shown in two energy bars, one green and one blue. The blue bar indicates how much energy the weapon has, while the green bar shows how much energy is consumed when the weapon is used.

==Plot==

===Setting and characters===
&quot;Mega Man Legends 2&quot; brings back several characters from its predecessor. This includes the protagonist Mega Man Volnutt (whose original name is Mega Man Trigger), a Digger in charge of exploring ruins to find Refractors, Roll Caskett, his spotter, who is searching for her missing parents, and Data, a mechanical monkey who contains all of Mega Man&#x27;s original memories. Roll&#x27;s grandfather, Barrel Caskett, also appears alongside his old friend Werner Von Bluecher in search of the Mother Lode, a legendary treasure supposed to have infinite energy. The pirates &quot;the Bonnes&quot;, made up of siblings Teisel, Tron, and Bon, and their Servbot followers, return once again as antagonists of the series but allied with three new members: a blonde-haired man named Glyde previously seen in &quot;The Misadventures of Tron Bonne&quot; who uses Birdbots as servants, and Bola and Klaymoor, a floating samurai and an enormous man wearing armor, respectively. Other characters include Yuna and Sera, whose purposes remain unknown during the game&#x27;s start, as well as the Master: a 3000-year-old man who is referred to as the last &quot;true&quot; human.

===Story===
A news conference is held by Professor Barrel Caskett and his old friend Werner Von Bluecher about the upcoming journey to the Forbidden Island in a large airship called the Sulphur Bottom to search for the Mother Lode. Barrel recognizes a reporter, Yuna, as his lost daughter, Matilda Caskett, who warns them of the catastrophe that could transpire if they pursue their journey. Yuna escapes with her servant, a Reaverbot flying machine-like being named Gatz to break the windows for her escape. Ignoring her warning Bluecher continues to the center of the island. Yuna orders Gatz to give warning shots but due to the hostile retaliation of the Sulphur Bottom, Gatz damages the engine, forcing the airship to descend to the island below.
Mega Man Volnutt and Roll Caskett watch the events from television and decide to rescue them. With Roll&#x27;s help, Mega Man makes his way to the center of the island and in the process releases a girl called Sera and her servant Geetz, both of whom go to the Sulphur Bottom. Geetz tells Bluecher and Barrel that the Mother lode can be accessed by means of four keys. Bluecher and Barrel ask Mega Man if he could retrieve the keys before the Pirates who heard their conversation with Geetz.

Mega Man along with Roll set forth to find the four Keys in the Manda, Nino, Saul Kada and Calinca Ruins, while battling the Pirates, most often the Bonne Family, along the way. When Mega Man returns with the final key to the Sulphur Bottom, Sera orders Geetz to attack the ship and take the keys. Yuna appears in the ship and orders Gatz to fight Geetz. Mega Man stumbles upon Yuna, who then gives some reminder about his former life and explains to him the terrible catastrophe she was trying to prevent: Sera&#x27;s plans for the execution of the &quot;Carbon Reinitialization Program&quot;, meant to kill every human from Terra and revive the original humans. Soon after, Mega Man reaches the deck of the Sulphur Bottom and sees Gatz defeated by Geetz. Mega Man is able to defeat Geetz, who, using his last forces, seriously damages Mega Man.

While recovering, Mega Man starts to explore his past. In his dreams he sees himself and a man known as &quot;Master&quot; going to Terra and giving Mega Man his &quot;Genetic Code&quot; before dying and requesting that Mega Man destroy the system that can start the Carbon Reinitialization Program. Yuna tells Mega Man to choose whether to follow what the System wants him to do or oppose it.

Mega Man then takes a flight in a ship merged with Gatz heading for the planet Elysium with Yuna. In Elysium, Mega Man reaches the room where the Carbon Reinitialization Program is to be executed from. Sera then appears in the form of a robot to Mega Man and states that she did not execute the Carbon Reinitialization Program but has, instead, been waiting for Mega Man&#x27;s arrival to challenge him in hopes that by defeating him she would prove that their master liked her more. In battle, Gatz tries to aid Mega Man by attacking Sera&#x27;s logic circuits, but dies in the attempt. As Mega Man defeats Sera, Yuna arrives at the scene reminding Sera that it is not their Master&#x27;s wish for her to die. Sera awakes in Yuna&#x27;s real body and decides to help Yuna protect the Carbons from the machines that are being activated in Terra due to an old system Master tried to stop. However, due to Gatz&#x27;s death, Mega Man, Sera and Yuna are now stranded in Elysium with no means of transporting back to Terra any time soon. The game ends with Roll and other characters working together to build a rocket to rescue Mega Man from Elysium.

==Development==
In 1999, Capcom announced that the series&#x27; spin-off, &quot;The Misadventures of Tron Bonne&quot;, would include a demo of the game. The demo was meant to show off the game&#x27;s improved graphics and a larger scale universe. The demo, titled , features an independent story in which Tron has kidnapped Roll and Mega Man sets to rescue her. It was only included in the Japanese version of the game and the PlayStation Portable port of the game. The game was released for the PlayStation in 2000 in Japan, as a regular release and another one under the label of &quot;PlayStation the Best&quot;. It was later released in 2000 in North America and in 2001 in Europe. Unchanged Japanese ports of the game were also released for the PC in 2001. In September 2005, Capcom ported the game to the PlayStation Portable but it was only published in Japan. Like the preceding game, the music was composed by Makoto Tomozawa with the ending theme used in the Japanese version being Hara Fumina&#x27;s . In October 2009, Capcom released , which is composed of a soundtrack including 17 tracks from the game and an artbook. The artbook also shows characters which were not featured in the game with all of them sharing the name of Mega Man like Mega Man Volnutt and Mega Man Juno. Producer Keiji Inafune comments that he was asked by several fans if a sequel to &quot;Mega Man Legends 2&quot; would be made. Inafune expressed desire in making, but at first stated that he could not do it.

==Reception==
The game was generally well received by critics in comparison to its predecessor. GameSpot directly stated that with &quot;Legends 2&quot;″s release, Capcom was able to turn &quot;what began as a mere spin-off into a worthy stand-alone franchise&quot;, while Allgame&#x27;s Jon Thompson stated it &quot;trumps its predecessor in almost every way, and shows that Capcom is certainly learning from its mistakes in the genre&quot;. IGN&#x27;s Adam Cleveland mentioned &quot;Mega Man Legends 2&quot; was &quot;the most involving game I&#x27;ve seen with Mega Man, and is one of the best, too&quot;. Publications commented that the gameplay was highly improved and that the variations of controls helped the players. Despite being compared with other games such as the ones from the &quot;Zelda&quot; franchise, the dungeons and missions were praised. Boss fights were also found to be entertaining, although some of the bosses&#x27; heights are larger than the ones featured in the first game. &quot;Famitsu&quot; found that the game&#x27;s overall sense of action was superior to the first incarnation, considering the ability to be assisted in missions by computer controlled characters as well as its mini-games and events.

The graphics received a mixed to positive reception. The graphic design and style was praised, but reviewers criticized the level design, saying it was still blocky and primitive. The story and cutscene animation were universally praised, and compared to watching an anime. In comparison to the first game, the story was also found to be darker and deeper. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; also focused on this, finding the game&#x27;s story to be a more &quot;rolling narrative rather than a simple &#x27;click the face, beat the boss, save the world&#x27; sort of cop-out&quot; comparing it with the original 2D series. Sound effects and music were likewise well-received, with the exception of Mega Man&#x27;s voice, which was derided as too feminine.

Samuel Bass reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that &quot;A fun game held back by pig-headed camera design.&quot;

GameRankings had an average of 76.60% for the PS version, while Metacritic had 76 favorable reviews out of 100 for it. In a 2007 retrospective of the &quot;Mega Man&quot; series, Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com ranked &quot;Mega Man Legends 2&quot; as &quot;Worth it!&quot;, praising its graphical improvements over the first title and commenting that its unresolved ending is &quot;one of gaming&#x27;s greatest injustices&quot;. In a similar feature, GameSpot stated that the game could &quot;fix lot of the flaws in the original and [&quot;Mega Man Legends 2&quot;] is a substantial improvement upon the Legends formula&quot;. 1UP.com analyzed &quot;Legends 2&quot;″s ending and found it unfortunate as the plot involving the Elder System mentioned in the game&#x27;s ending remained unresolved.

The PlayStation version of &quot;Mega Man Legends 2&quot; was the 139th best-selling video game in Japan in 2000 at 88,131 units sold. The PSP version of the game barely made it into the &quot;Famitsu&quot; top 500 best-sellers list in Japan for 2005 at a mere 15,309 units sold by the end of the year.

<text>John Meisel (born October 23, 1923) is a Canadian political scientist, professor, and scholar, and former chairman of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.

Meisel has written extensively on various aspects of politics, notably on parties, elections, ethnic relations, politics and leisure culture, and, at the beginning of his academic career, international politics. 

Meisel has been a pioneer in Canada of research on electoral behaviour, political parties and the relationship between politics and leisure culture, particularly the arts. Throughout his career he has examined the cohesion (or its absence) of the Canadian communities. He has also lectured and written about regulation, broadcasting, telecommunications, and the information society.

==Career==
John Meisel was born in Vienna, Austria in October 1923 to Jewish Czech parents. His father worked for Baťa Shoes at its headquarters in Zlín, Moravia, Czechoslovakia in the 1930s. As the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia became imminent, Baťa sent its Jewish employees out of Czechoslovakia to Bata centres abroad, and the Meisel family moved to Casablanca and then Haiti before settling in Bata&#x27;s Canadian company town of Batawa, Ontario in 1942.

John Meisel matriculated from Pickering College in Newmarket, Ontario. He received his university training at the University of Toronto&#x27;s Victoria College, and the London School of Economics. He has taught at Queen&#x27;s University since 1949, where he is a professor emeritus. He served on the Ontario Advisory Committee on Confederation in 1965.

Meisel worked on the 1965 Canadian National Election Study, and was a member of the ICPSR (Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research) Council from 1966 to 1968.

In 1975, he was a consultant for the Trilateral Commission&#x27;s report &quot;Crisis of Democracy&quot;. From 1980 to 1983 he was Chairman of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. From 1992 until 1995, he was the 103rd President of the Royal Society of Canada.

In 1989 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada; promoted to Companion in 1999.

Meisel was the founding editor of &quot;The Canadian Journal of Political Science&quot; and of &quot;The International Political Science Review&quot;.

== Philanthropy ==
In addition to his contributions to Canadian university research and public communications, Dr Meisel is known for his philanthropy in Kingston, Ontario. One gift was his 50-hectare property near Crow Lake north of Kingston. This was donated to the Rideau Valley Conservation Foundation in 2000 as a sanctuary of peace and quiet for the residents of Eastern Ontario. The property is called the Meisel Woods Conservation Area. Over the years, modest improvements and public safety features have been installed. A commemorative trail called the Sandi Slater Memorial Walk has been added by the Foundation.

<doc id="1195458" wikidata="Q6486528" url="?curid=1195458" title="Langstone, Hampshire">
<text>Langstone is a village near Havant, Hampshire in the south east of England in Portsmouth. It has good railway connections to London, Southampton, Portsmouth and Brighton, from the nearby Havant railway station. There are many large gated detached houses on the main road, &quot;Langstone Road&quot; and on the roads surrounding this. It has a sailing club, several architecturally unusual buildings, and several historically significant buildings, including a converted (water) millhouse and a converted 18th century windmill, the latter of which is a local landmark.

==Geography==

The village surrounds &quot;Langstone Road&quot; which leads to Hayling Island. There is a technology park on Langstone Road and this is due to the connections of the road. It lies just off the A27 that provides quick links to Portsmouth, Southampton and Brighton. The A3(M) to London is also nearby and the distance to the M25 is about 45 miles.

It is connected by Langstone Bridge, a single-carriageway road and footbridge, to Hayling Island to the South; this road (the A3023) is the only road connection from Hayling Island to the mainland. To the west of the road bridge the remains of the former railway bridge are visible; Langstone Harbour lies to the west of the railway bridge, Chichester Harbour to the east.
The historic causeway to Hayling Island known as the Wadeway still exists, however it is now completely impassable, having been cut in two by a deep channel for the Portsmouth and Chichester Canal in the 1820s, the same company having subsequently funded the old wooden road bridge, served by a toll-house situated at the northern end. There was a weight-limit and after WW2 only single-decker buses were allowed across and if they were carrying too many passengers some had to get out and walk, regardless of the weather, to reduce axle-weight. The old wooden bridge was demolished following construction of the current (2014) concrete bridge in the late 1950s. The much earlier causeway was known as the Wade Way, and was classified as a bridleway in 1988, and is shown as such on modern Ordnance Survey maps in spite of its use being considered hazardous at best. Excavation of this feature in 2006, constructed on a natural high point in the harbour, put its date in the Roman to mediaeval range but found no evidence to be more specific.

The village High Street is designated as a Conservation Area (denoted by a blue plaque at the sea-end of the High Street), while the coastal path leading eastwards from the village is both part of Hampshire County Council&#x27;s Solent Way and the same Councils&#x27; Wayfarers Walk.

Thorney Island and Portsea Island are also both clearly visible from the village coast.

===Pubs In Langstone===
There are two Grade II listed pubs in Langstone:

==Architecture==

Flooding can be a problem in the village, on occasion with water right up to the main Langstone Road, and many buildings on Langstone High Street have slots for wooden barriers on their door frames, and stack up sandbags. However flood risk to buildings is strictly limited to the older (pre-twentieth century) properties.

Houses in the terrace on Langstone High Street date back to the 18th century and a number are thatched. The other significant buildings, commonly featured in local postcards, is Langstone Towers, characterised by a large lightning conductor.

==History==
The village used to have rail links with Hayling Island and Havant in the form of the Hayling Billy railway, however the lines have since been torn up and the route replaced with a cycle and bridlepath. The remains of the Hayling Billy rail bridge over to Hayling Island can still be seen.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Langstone&quot; comes from &quot;Lang&quot; (compare the High German &quot;lang&quot;) meaning &quot;Long&quot;, and &quot;Stone&quot; with the same current-day usage.

==Notable people==
