<text>The Jacksonville Transportation Authority (JTA) is the independent agency responsible for public transit in the city of Jacksonville, Florida, and roadway infrastructure that connects northeast Florida. However, they do not maintain any roadways. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

== History ==
In 1955, the Florida Legislature established the Jacksonville Expressway Authority. Its responsibility was limited to highways, bridges and tolls in Duval County until 1971, when the Jacksonville Transportation Authority was formed by a merger of the Jacksonville Expressway Authority with several private bus companies.

== Governance ==
The JTA is governed by a seven-member Board of Directors. The mayor of Jacksonville appoints three members who must be confirmed by the Jacksonville City Council; the Florida Governor appoints three members who must be confirmed by the Florida Senate. Each member serves a four-year, unpaid term and can be re-appointed for a second term. If a member serves eight consecutive years, they must rotate off the board. From its membership, the Board elects its own Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer for one year terms. The seventh member is the District Two Secretary from the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) who serves as long as s/he is employed in the position. That individual is responsible for the FDOT activities within the 18 counties of the district, including administrative, planning and operations.

As of September 2022, members included Ari Jolly, chair; Debbie Buckland, vice chair; G. Ray Driver, secretary; Abel Harding, treasurer; Greg Evans, FDOT District Two Secretary; Kevin Holzendorf, board member; and Aundra Wallace, board member.

== Revenue ==
Originally, when a bridge or roadway was completed, a toll was imposed at that location to create a revenue stream to repay bonds used to fund construction. State and federal tax money was used for specific capital projects, such as interstate highways.

=== Gas surcharge ===
The Jacksonville City Council approved a 10-year, 6¢ per gallon gasoline surcharge in 1986 to pay for new roadways and other transportation projects. Prior to its expiration in 1996, the council extended the tax for 20 additional years, until 2016. In 2021, the City Council approved a further extension and increase to 12¢ per gallon in order to pay for infrastructure projects including the Emerald Trail system and the Ultimate Urban Circulator project to convert the Skyway monorail into an autonomous vehicle network.

=== Tolls ===
J. Turner Butler Boulevard, the Fuller Warren Bridge, Mathews Bridge, Hart Bridge, and Trout River Bridge were tolled by JTA until 1988, when Jacksonville voters approved a ½¢ sales tax increase to pay off the toll bonds, fund future road construction, and abolish toll collections.

=== Growth management ===
JTA was the major beneficiary of the $2.25 billion Better Jacksonville Plan (BJP), passed by voters in September, 2000. Roadway/drainage improvements, resurfacing, new sidewalks and railroad grade crossings accounted for $1.5 billion, of which half was funded by the BJP ½¢ sales tax increase and half from the existing gasoline surcharge. In 2005, the JTA and city re-prioritized the projects still outstanding. The actual cost for most projects had significantly exceeded the estimate due to an 18-month lag time and an unanticipated increase in the price of construction materials. Dozens of projects were deferred to the future and removed from the BJP or left on a $320 million list of unfunded tasks.

=== Budget ===
The gasoline surcharge generates approximately $30 million in revenue each year, about one third of JTA&#x27;s budget of $100 million in 2010. Prior to the 1986 gasoline surcharge, tolls were the primary source of local revenue for the JTA. Federal and state highway money provided the balance. In early June, 2010, JTA announced their intentions to request an extension of the 6¢ per gallon gasoline surcharge, due to expire in 2016. They will also ask the council for an additional 5¢ per gallon tax over 30 years that would generate another $25 million per year, for a total of $55 million each year. Most council members questioned the need to extend the existing tax and were opposed to any new tax during difficult economic times, but JTA executives warned that if the gas taxes are curtailed, no road construction will occur and bus service will be slashed.

== Responsibilities ==
The mission of the JTA is to improve Northeast Florida’s economy, environment and quality of life by providing safe, reliable, efficient and sustainable multimodal transportation services and facilities.

=== Roadway infrastructure ===
The JTA develops and implements construction and financing plans for state and city roads, bridges and interchanges in conjunction with the city government and the Florida Department of Transportation. This was the original role of the Expressway Authority.

=== Public transit ===
* Regular bus service: JTA&#x27;s fleet has 218 vehicles, as of 2024, that travel 8.5 million miles per year on 37 routes; 110 maintenance workers and 320 drivers are employed.
* Express bus service: five once-daily early morning routes are offered which originate from an outlying area and go directly to their destination with no intermediate stops, then return in late afternoon.
* First Coast Flyer: a bus rapid transit (BRT) system; all four planned routes are now in operation.
* Trolley-replica buses: local transportation available weekdays from mid-morning to early afternoon; Bay Street and Beaver Street (downtown) routes are free; Riverside and the Beach trolley have a minimal charge but also run on weekends.
* JTA Connexion: paratransit for the disabled and elderly, provided by private vendors with specially equipped vehicles and drivers.
* St. Johns River Ferry: vehicle and pedestrian ferry that operates between Mayport Village and Ft. George Island. 
* Stadium shuttle: game day bus transportation from suburban, downtown and Park-n-Ride locations to the stadium and back.
* Jacksonville Skyway: Automated people mover system which travels 2.5 miles from the King Street parking garage across the St. Johns River and through the central business district, ending at LaVilla or the Florida State College at Jacksonville downtown campus.
* Park-n-Ride: Parking facility available in combination with express bus service or JTA Skyway.
* Jacksonville Regional Transportation Center (JRTC): JTA opened a new intermodal transit center in May, 2020, bringing together Jacksonville Skyway, JTA bus, First Coast Flyer, intercity bus, and rail service in one facility. JRTC replaced the aging and overcrowded Rosa Parks Transit Station. JRTC is situated across the street from the Prime F. Osborn III Convention Center.

==== Future transit ====
* First Coast Commuter Rail: JTA is undertaking evaluations for a future commuter rail system.
* Ultimate Urban Circulator (U2C): JTA is undertaking a project to modernize and replace the Jacksonville Skyway by converting and expanding the automated people mover into an autonomous vehicle (AV) network.

=== Hurricanes ===
The JTA has the responsibility to identify, plan and prepare Jacksonville&#x27;s hurricane evacuation routes. The JTA and the city of Jacksonville established a &quot;Hurricane Preparedness Plan&quot; that will provide emergency evacuation/patient transport and move civilians and/or emergency service personnel with mass transit.

== Fleet ==
The Jacksonville Transportation Authority bus fleet is composed mostly of 35 or 40-foot Gillig BRT Plus buses, used on local routes, while some Gillig BRTs and Low Floors are used as contingency spares. Most of the standard Gilligs are painted in the same livery, with CNG units distinguishable by CNG stickers on the sides.
== First Coast Commuter Rail ==
First Coast Commuter Rail is a proposed commuter rail system serving Jacksonville, FL and northeast Florida. It is currently in the planning stages, having completed the first step of a feasibility study and currently pursuing an alternatives analysis.

Three routes were analyzed in depth, north to Yulee, FL, southwest to Green Cove Springs, FL and the southeast to St. Augustine, FL.

A feasibility study was completed in November 2009 for the Jacksonville Transportation Authority (JTA). James Boyle, JTA&#x27;s regional transportation planner, has since said that there are no fatal flaws in the study.

JTA hired a consultant to conduct a feasibility study in early 2008 at the cost of $400,000. It was completed in November 2009. The study looked into 7 routes, most along existing freight rail right of ways. Three of these, north to Yulee, FL, southwest to Green Cove Springs, FL and the southeast to St. Augustine, FL were selected for in depth study. In the Summer of 2010, JTA allocated $1 Million for an Alternative Analysis study on the proposed system. This is a required step to participate in the Federal Transit Administration&#x27;s (FTA) New Starts program.

In May 2013, St. Augustine City Commission voted in a resolution supporting the proposal of a commuter train service on the southeast corridor. JTA says that the federal government could fund half of the southeast corridor project, estimated to cost about $193.3 million. The proposal still needs approval from St. Johns County, The North Florida Transportation Planning Organization board, and the Jacksonville Transportation Authority board.

As of 2023, First Coast Commuter Rail is still in the planning stages and no funding has been identified for its implementation.
All routes in the in-depth study start in downtown Jacksonville and head out in one of three directions: North (to Yulee), South (to Green Cove Springs), and Southeast (to St. Augustine).
The North Corridor originates in Downtown Jacksonville, and heads North along the abandoned S-Line to the CSX Kingsland division line to Yulee, FL. The Kingsland division line is a remnant of the Seaboard Air Line&#x27;s mainline. The route passes two miles (3 km) from Jacksonville International Airport.
The Southwest Corridor originates in Downtown Jacksonville, and heads South along the CSX A-Line to Green Cove Springs, FL.
The Southeast Corridor originates in Downtown Jacksonville, and heads Southeast along the Florida East Coast Railway&#x27;s main line to St. Augustine, closely following U.S. 1, known as Philips Highway in Jacksonville and Ponce de Leon Boulevard in St. Augustine . The proposed route would share the railbed with the northernmost part of a freight rail line to Miami. The heavily trafficked corridor already serves 17 regularly scheduled interregional freight trains per day, a figure which does not include Amtrak service, unscheduled freight trains, and other services. The 2009 feasibility study estimated that this route could carry an estimated 5,469 passengers in 2020 on trains between Jacksonville and St. Augustine. Travel time is estimated at 51 minutes end to end, comparable to travel time by car. Notable proposed stops along the route include the J. Turner Butler Freeway, The Avenues, Race Track Road/Nocatee, the massive mixed-use residential/commercial development at Palencia, West St. Augustine, the Northeast Florida Regional Airport (not to be confused with the much larger and busier Jacksonville International Airport almost 50 miles to the north), the St. Johns County Government Complex, and its terminus in Downtown St. Augustine.

By 2023, planning for the Southeast Corridor had progressed to the planning phase with a potential of four stations along the route: the Jacksonville Regional Transportation Center at LaVilla, Avenues Walk, Racetrack Road, and St. Augustine.

<doc id="1202539" wikidata="Q2532676" url="?curid=1202539" title="Battletoads/Double Dragon">
<text>Battletoads/Double Dragon (fully titled Battletoads &amp; Double Dragon - The Ultimate Team) is a 1993 beat &#x27;em up developed by Rare and published by Tradewest. It was originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System and later ported to the Mega Drive/Genesis, Super NES, and Game Boy. The SNES version was released on Nintendo Switch Online in September 2024; it was the game&#x27;s first re-release as it was not released on the &quot;Rare Replay&quot; collection.

&quot;The Ultimate Team&quot; is a crossover of Technos Japan&#x27;s &quot;Double Dragon&quot; and Rare&#x27;s &quot;Battletoads&quot; game franchises, although Technos had little or no credited involvement in production beyond providing the &quot;Double Dragon&quot; license. The game features the characters from the &quot;Double Dragon&quot; series, Billy and Jimmy Lee, two young martial arts experts; also included are the three humanoid toad protagonists from the &quot;Battletoads&quot; game. It is also the first &quot;Battletoads&quot; game to feature all three toads as playable characters. The game&#x27;s engine and design are directly based upon the &quot;Battletoads&quot; series.

==Plot==
After she was defeated by the Battletoads, the evil Dark Queen flees to the outer reaches of the universe and the &#x27;Toads and their mentor get on with their lives. However, one day the Earth&#x27;s military is neutralized and the giant spaceship &quot;Colossus&quot; emerges from the Moon. Apparently, the Dark Queen is back with another plan to dominate the galaxy, and she has allied herself with the Shadow Warriors (from the &quot;Double Dragon&quot; series) to supplement her forces. Deciding to even the odds, the Battletoads contact Billy and Jimmy Lee for help. The brothers agree, and all five immediately take off for the &quot;Colossus&quot; in a mission to stop this two-pronged threat.

The first level of the seven-level game takes place on the tail of &quot;Colossus&quot;, the second on the interior corridors of the ship in level two, the third in the ship&#x27;s base, and the fourth where the player attempts to destroy the ship from the outside while on a small space craft. The fourth level is where the beat &#x27;em up game turns into a shooter, and the Dark Queen throws asteroids, mines, and UFOs at the spacecraft controlled by the player. Although the ship is successfully destroyed, the Dark Queen and the Shadow Boss survive by escaping in a missile hull, thus making the fifth level&#x27;s goal to board it. The final two stages are boss battles with the Shadow Boss (stage six) and the Dark Queen (stage seven).

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Battletoads/Double Dragon&quot; is a beat &#x27;em up video game where the players, as either one of the three Battletoads or Jimmy and Billy, attack enemies, swing ropes, go on spaceships, and turbo bike to defeat the Shadow Boss and Dark Queen. It has three play modes: a single-player, a &quot;2 Players A&quot; mode where the players can hit each other, and a &quot;2 Players B&quot; that doesn&#x27;t have that. Its engine and gameplay is from the original &quot;Battletoads&quot;, and less like &quot;Double Dragon&quot;. Like the prior &quot;Battletoads&quot; installment, there are only three continues and no password system, and in the two-player modes, if one player loses all lives, both players have to start a level over. The 16-bit versions have identical gameplay to their NES counterparts, attacks and jumping are triggered by only two buttons.

The player has a choice of five playable characters: Billy and Jimmy Lee from &quot;Double Dragon&quot;, and Zitz, Pimple, and Rash from &quot;Battletoads&quot;. All of the toads are equipped with their usual &quot;Smash Hit&quot; attacks, such as big punches (&quot;Kiss-My-Fist&quot;), big kicks (&quot;Big Bad Foot&quot;), double-handed hits (&quot;Nuclear Knuckles&quot;), headbutt (&quot;Battletoad Butt&quot;), a wrecking-ball-like charge used while hanging on a cable (&quot;BT Bashing Ball&quot;), kicks while hanging on a rope (&quot;Swingin&#x27; Size Thirteens&quot;), a pick-up and throwing of enemies (&quot;Take Out the Trash&quot;), backward kicks while riding a speeder bike (&quot;Bikin&#x27; Bash&quot;), walker leg bashes (&quot;No Way Back Thwack&quot;), and enemy slamming (&quot;Twin Side Slam&quot;), with a new attack being a kick while hanging on a ledge named &quot;Back &#x27;N Front Punt.&quot; Likewise, the Lee twins&#x27; Dragon Force techniques are playable, such as spin kick, knee drops, and elbow-drops. New abilities include hanging off of and moving across sides of platforms, and kicking off enemies while doing so, although the player can fall off and lose a life if other enemies step on his fingers.

== Development ==
&quot;Battletoads/Double Dragon&quot; was developed by the company that handled the 1991 &quot;Battletoads&quot; game, Rare, which produced several games as contract work for other intellectual properties in the late 1980s and early 1990s; the 1993 crossover was one of them, and its development involved Rare receiving little feedback from the owners of the &quot;Double Dragon&quot; license.

The NES version features 3D scrolling and other advanced special effects uncommonly sophisticated for the console. The Game Boy version is similar to the NES version, but it is only for one player. The sprites are the same size although the screen is smaller (leaving less room for movement) and the 3D effects are absent. The logo on the game cover art is one of Rare&#x27;s first uses of 3D graphics.

==Reception==
=== Contemporaneous ===

&quot;Nintendo Power&quot; asserted that the game has confusing depth perception, but &quot;great action, graphics and theme make this one of the strongest titles this year&quot;, and is better than &quot;Battletoads in Battlemaniacs&quot; (1993). Its staff rated it as the second-best NES game of 1993. The NES version was nominated for Nintendo Power Awards 1993 in the categories &quot;Graphics &amp; Sound&quot;, &quot;Theme &amp; Fun&quot;, &quot;Play Control&quot;, &quot;Villain&quot; (The Dark Queen), and &quot;The Best Overall Game&quot;.

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s Steve Harris, reviewing the NES version, loved its &quot;side-scrolling techniques&quot;, &quot;nice&quot; attack combos, and combination of game licenses, but found the graphics too average even for 8-bit technology and the controls &quot;slightly haphazard&quot;. Another critic from &quot;GamePro&quot; disappointed with the NES game&#x27;s graphics enjoyed the character animation, particularly when it came to the bosses and the playable characters&#x27; attacks; however, he also criticized the cutscenes and level designs, for replacing the &quot;pizazz&quot; and vibrant colors of the previous &quot;Battletoads&quot; installment with &quot;a flat, 2D appearance and almost robotic animation&quot;. He reported problems of disappearing sprites during &quot;hectic fighting scenes&quot;. Other reviews, such as &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; critic Martin Alessi and Mike Weigand of &quot;Electronic Games&quot;, found the visuals amazing for an 8-bit game, citing its parallax scrolling effects. Critics from &quot;GameFan&quot; called the SNES version superior to the Genesis version for its better presentation in color, detail, effects, and sound.

Alessi, Weigand, and Ed Semrad praised the two-player mode, attacks, moves, and fast-paced gameplay. Weigand praised the challenging gameplay and noted aspects of it that make it more forgiving that the previous &quot;Battletoads&quot; game, such as not having to re-do the speed bike section if the player falls off a bike. Sushi-X, however, brought up unfair elements to the difficulty, such as &quot;enormously cheap kills in many areas, like being knocked into pits and unblock-able attacks&quot;.

&quot;Mega Fun&quot;, reviewing the Game Boy version, stated that it benefitted from diversity when it came to playable characters, enemies, and backgrounds but lacked the &quot;unusual&quot; elements of other &quot;Battletoads&quot; games. Reviews of the Game Boy version frequently critiqued the graphics and music; &quot;Mega Fan&quot; criticized the small sprites for not giving the player a clear perspective of what is going on sometimes, and Michael Koczy of the German edition of &quot;Total!&quot; wrote the game had &quot;poor animation,&quot; &quot;average&quot; music, and toads that were hard to distinguish between each other. Mr. Goo of &quot;GameFan&quot; critiqued the small sprite size.

A &quot;GameFan&quot; reviewer was critical of the inclusion of &quot;Double Dragon&quot; characters, reasoning that the franchise was past its prime.

&quot;VideoGames &amp; Computer Entertainment&quot; journalist Chris Bieniek opined the NES version&#x27;s graphics was exceptional as expected for a late-era game, but received little improvement in the Genesis version.

=== Retrospective ===
The visuals were praised, particularly the humorous attack animations, and vibrant colors. Matt Hull of &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot;, reviewing the NES version, praised the humor of the moves and sound effects, &quot;superb&quot; music, &quot;very smooth&quot; controls, and for having the same 16-bit-looking graphics as the prior &quot;Battletoads&quot; game, particularly the animation, backgrounds, parallax scrolling, and the &quot;Colossus&quot;. He said, &quot;You&#x27;ll see parts of the spaceship moving and it just looks so fluid/smooth that I can&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s 8 bit!&quot;

&quot;The Video Game Critic&quot; called the stages &quot;fully interactive and full of surprises&quot;. Hull appreciated its more forgiving difficulty in comparison to the original&quot;Battletoads&quot;, Thornburg stated it was still unfair at times, noting &quot;unbalanced fights&quot;, &quot;moving down a rope too fast for the screen and being killed by seemingly nothing or being overcrowded by enemies at the most frustrated moments&quot;. 

The combination of the &quot;Battletoads&quot; and &quot;Double Dragon&quot; properties were well-received, with Skyler Miller of &quot;AllGame&quot; opining that &quot;Rare does a fine job at connecting the two universes without making it seem forced or arbitrary.&quot; However, some reviewers found problems in presenting the &quot;Double Dragon&quot; property, such as &quot;Double Dragon II&quot;″s Burnov being the Shadow Boss instead of Jimmy, and Roper being misnamed.

An &quot;AllGame&quot; critic, Brett Alan Weiss, was harsh on the SNES version, calling it &quot;an unnecessary creation, except to line the pockets of the companies involved&quot;, and too similar in looks and gameplay to its 8-bit counterpart, thus not taking enough advantage of the 16-bit console&#x27;s capabilities. His other criticisms were the &quot;slow&quot; controls, &quot;jerky&quot; character movements, and poor audio, writing that &quot;the sound effects are boring and the music is of the pseudo rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll variety, replete with drum machine-sounding drums and thoroughly unconvincing guitar riffs.&quot; 

The game was featured on the lists of &quot;top 11 video game crossovers&quot; by UGO Networks and the 15 most bizarre crossovers in gaming by GamesRadar. It has been ranked the 76th best NES game by &quot;IGN&quot;. In 2018, Complex listed the game 28th on its &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot;. In 2023, Time Extension included the NES version on their top 25 &quot;Best Beat &#x27;Em Ups of All Time&quot; list, saying that it &quot;[...] seamlessly blends the two worlds together, unshackling Double Dragon from its archaic routes and curbing the difficulty of Battletoads to create an excellent entry point for either series or just a fun, well made one-off.&quot;.

<doc id="1202546" wikidata="Q7594088" url="?curid=1202546" title="St Magnus the Martyr">
<text>St Magnus the Martyr, London Bridge, is a Church of England church and parish within the City of London. The church, which is located in Lower Thames Street near The Monument to the Great Fire of London, is part of the Diocese of London and under the pastoral care of the Bishop of Fulham. It is a Grade I listed building. The rector uses the title &quot;Cardinal Rector&quot; and, since the abolition of the College of Minor Canons of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in 2016, is the only cleric in the Church of England to use the title &quot;cardinal&quot;.

St Magnus lies on the original alignment of London Bridge between the City and Southwark. The ancient parish was united with that of St Margaret, New Fish Street, in 1670 and with that of St Michael, Crooked Lane, in 1831. The three united parishes retained separate vestries and churchwardens. Parish clerks continue to be appointed for each of the three parishes.

St Magnus is the guild church of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers and the Worshipful Company of Plumbers, and the ward church of the Ward of Bridge and Bridge Without. It is also twinned with the Church of the Resurrection in New York City.

Its prominent location and beauty have prompted many mentions in literature. In &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, Charles Dickens notes how, as Nancy heads for her secret meeting with Mr Brownlow and Rose Maylie on London Bridge, &quot;the tower of old Saint Saviour&#x27;s Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom&quot;. The church&#x27;s spiritual and architectural importance is celebrated in the poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot; by T. S. Eliot, who wrote, &quot;the walls of Magnus Martyr hold/Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold&quot;. He added in a footnote that &quot;the interior of St. Magnus Martyr is to my mind one of the finest among Wren&#x27;s interiors&quot;. One biographer of Eliot notes that at first he enjoyed St Magnus aesthetically for its &quot;splendour&quot;; later he appreciated its &quot;utility&quot; when he came there as a sinner.

==Dedication==
The identity of the St Magnus to whom the church is dedicated is disputed. It is now dedicated to St Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney, who died in 1116 or 1117. However, scholarly opinion is increasingly coming to the conclusion that the original dedication was to St Magnus of Anagni, a 2nd-century Italian saint whose cult was widespread.
St Magnus of Orkney was executed on the island of Egilsay on 16 April in 1116 or 1117 (the year is uncertain), having been captured during a power struggle with his cousin, a political rival. Magnus had a reputation for piety and gentleness and was sanctified (a form of unofficial canonisation) in 1136. St Ronald, the son of Magnus&#x27;s sister Gunhild Erlendsdotter, became Earl of Orkney in 1136 and in 1137 initiated the construction of St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall.
The London church was not linked to St Magnus of Orkney before the 18th century, when it was suggested that it was either &quot;dedicated to the memory of St Magnus or Magnes, who suffer&#x27;d under the Emperor Aurelian in 276 [&quot;this appears to be a reference to St Mammes of Caesarea, whose feast day is on 17 August&quot;], or else to a person of that name, who was the famous Apostle or Bishop of the Orcades.&quot;

For the next century most historians followed the suggestion that the church was dedicated to the Roman saint of Cæsarea. However, in the mid-19th century the prominent Danish archaeologist Professor Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae (1821–85) instead promoted the association with Magnus of Orkney, during his visit to the British Isles in 1846–47, when he was formulating the concept of the &quot;Viking Age&quot;, and then in his &quot;Account of the Danes and Norwegians in England, Scotland, and Ireland&quot; of 1852. This theory immediately found its way into both guides and academic works. The discovery of Magnus of Orkney&#x27;s relics in 1919 increased interest in a Scandinavian patron and this connection was encouraged by the rector who arrived in 1921. The dedication to St Magnus of Orkney was confirmed by the Bishop of London in 1926. Following this decision a patronal festival service was held on 16 April 1926. The 900th anniversary of the death of St Magnus was marked with a Pontifical High Mass and Solemn Pontifical Vespers at the London church on 16 April 2016 (although it was to be celebrated in 2017 at St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney).

The principal argument against an association with Magnus of Orkney is that the original church pre-dated his sanctification by around a century, and was also probably constructed before the cult of St Olaf, which did not become established in London until the 1050s. The dedication of the church to St Magnus (as for the four City churches dedicated to St Botolph) at least partly reflected interest in particular saints&#x27; relics during the 11th century. There was a cult of this earlier (unidentified) St Magnus before the Norman Conquest: several English monastic houses claimed to have relics of the saint; King Edgar gave one to Westminster Abbey; and the relic collection of Peterborough Abbey included the hand of St Magnus the Martyr. The feast of St Magnus the Martyr, celebrated on 19 August, appears in most liturgical calendars from the Gelasian Sacramentary in the eighth century and the missal of Robert of Jumièges in the 11th century to the 16th century.

It is therefore likely that the original dedication of the church was to St Magnus of Anagni, a putative second-century bishop, martyred in the reign of the Emperor Decius, whose feast was celebrated on 19 August. This identification was proposed by Richard Thomson in his &quot;Chronicles of London Bridge&quot; of 1827, and has more recently been argued at greater length by Matthew Payne and Michael Cooper. It is possible that the dedication was influenced by Cnut&#x27;s journey to Rome in 1027 or by the translation to Canterbury in 1023 of the remains of Alphage, Bishop and Martyr, from St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, where a cult had rapidly developed at his tomb.

The feast on 19 August was still celebrated in the 16th century. It was included in an &quot;Almanack&quot; attached to Miles Coverdale&#x27;s translation of the Bible and in the &quot;Preces Privitae&quot; of 1564 (authorised by Elizabeth I for private devotion), but was excluded from the Book of Common Prayer. It was also omitted from the Tridentine calendar, falling as it did within the Octave of the Assumption, but has remained in local calendars. St Magnus of Anagni also remains in the &quot;Martyrologium Romanum&quot;.

==History==
===11th and 12th centuries: foundation===

A metropolitan bishop of London attended the Council of Arles in 314, which indicates that there must have been a Christian community in Londinium by this date, and it has been suggested that a large aisled building excavated in 1993 near Tower Hill can be compared with the 4th-century Cathedral of St Tecla in Milan. However, there is no evidence to suggest that any of the mediaeval churches in the City of London had a Roman foundation.

The archaeological record suggests that the area of the bridgehead was not occupied from the early 5th century until the early 10th century. Environmental evidence indicates that the area was waste ground during this period, colonised by elder and nettles. Following Alfred the Great&#x27;s decision to reoccupy the walled area of London in 886, new harbours were established at Queenhithe and Billingsgate. A wooden bridge was in place by the early 11th century, a factor which would have encouraged the occupation of the bridgehead by craftsmen and traders. During the 10th and 11th centuries, as overseas trade revived, the landing places immediately downstream of the bridge became ever more significant. Streets were laid out in the vicinity of the bridge leading from the river into the eastern part of the City. Fish Street Hill, leading from the bridge itself to Bishopsgate, originated earlier.

The narrow strip of land south of the Roman river wall widened enough to accommodate a significant number of buildings and a collapse of part of the wall, probably at some point between 1016 and 1066, helped to facilitate access. The waterfront at this time was a hive of activity, with the construction of embankments sloping down from the riverside wall to the river. A lane connecting Botolph&#x27;s Wharf and Billingsgate to the rebuilt bridge had developed by the mid-11th century. Thames Street appeared in the second half of the 11th century immediately behind (north of) the old Roman riverside wall and in 1931 a piling from this was discovered during the excavation of the foundations of a nearby building. It now stands at the base of the church tower. St Magnus was built to the south of Thames Street to serve the growing population of the bridgehead area in the 11th century.

The small ancient parish extended about 110 yards along the waterfront either side of the old bridge, from &#x27;Stepheneslane&#x27; (later Churchehawlane or Church Yard Alley) and &#x27;Oystergate&#x27; (later called Water Lane or Gully Hole) on the West side to &#x27;Retheresgate&#x27; (a southern extension of Pudding Lane) on the East side, and was centred on the crossroads formed by Fish Street Hill (originally Bridge Street, then New Fish Street) and Thames Street. The mediaeval parish also included Drinkwater&#x27;s Wharf (named after the owner, Thomas Drinkwater), which was located immediately West of the bridge, and Fish Wharf, which was to the south of the church. The latter was of considerable importance as the fishmongers had their shops on the wharf. The tenement was devised by Andrew Hunte to the Rector and Churchwardens in 1446. The ancient parish was situated in the South East part of Bridge Ward, which had evolved in the first half of the 11th century between the embankments to either side of the bridge.

St Magnus was purportedly granted by William I in 1067 to Westminster Abbey. Although this charter is generally accepted to be a later forgery by Osbert of Clare, Prior of Westminster Abbey, as is a charter of confirmation in 1108–16, it may preserve genuine evidence of a foundation of the church in the 11th century. There is a further document referring to the church in 1128–33. In the second half of the 12th century control of the advowson of St Magnus was disputed between the Abbot of Westminster and the Prior of Bermondsey. The case was resolved in the Curia Regis on 23 April 1182, with the advowson being divided equally between them. Later in the 1180s, on their joint presentation, the Archdeacon of London inducted his nephew as parson. On 14 April 1208, again on the joint presentation of the Abbot of Westminster and the Prior of Bermondsey, the Bishop of London instituted Simon de Valenciis to St Magnus.

===13th and 14th centuries: stone bridge and chapel of St Thomas Becket===

Between the late Saxon period and 1209 there was a series of wooden bridges across the Thames, but in that year a stone bridge was completed. The work was overseen by Peter of Colechurch, a priest and head of the Fraternity of the Brethren of London Bridge. The Church had from early times encouraged the building of bridges and this activity was so important it was perceived to be an act of piety – a commitment to God which should be supported by the giving of alms. London&#x27;s citizens made gifts of land and money &quot;to God and the Bridge&quot;. The Bridge House Estates became part of the City&#x27;s jurisdiction in 1282.

Until 1831 the bridge was aligned with Fish Street Hill, so the main entrance into the City from the south passed the West door of St Magnus on the north bank of the river. The bridge included a chapel dedicated to St Thomas Becket for the use of pilgrims journeying to Canterbury Cathedral to visit his tomb. The chapel and about two thirds of the bridge were in the parish of St Magnus. After some years of rivalry a dispute arose between the church and the chapel over the offerings given to the chapel by the pilgrims. The matter was resolved by the brethren of the chapel making an annual contribution to St Magnus. At the Reformation the chapel was turned into a house and later a warehouse, the latter being demolished in 1757–58.

The church grew in importance. On 21 November 1234 a grant of land was made to the parson of St Magnus for the enlargement of the church. The London Eyre of 1244 recorded that in 1238 &quot;A thief named William of Ewelme of the county of Buckingham fled to the church of St. Magnus the Martyr, London, and there acknowledged the theft and abjured the realm. He had no chattels.&quot; Another entry recorded that &quot;The City answers saying that the church of ... St. Magnus the Martyr ... which [is] situated on the king&#x27;s highway ... ought to belong to the king and be in his gift&quot;. The church presumably jutted into the road running to the bridge, as it did in later times. In 1276 it was recorded that &quot;the church of St. Magnus the Martyr is worth £15 yearly and Master Geoffrey de la Wade now holds it by the grant of the prior of Bermundeseie and the abbot of Westminster to whom King Henry conferred the advowson by his charter.&quot;

In 1274 &quot;came King Edward and his wife [Eleanor] from the Holy Land and were crowned at Westminster on the Sunday next after the Feast of the Assumption of Our Lady [15 August], being the Feast of Saint Magnus [19 August]; and the Conduit in Chepe ran all the day with red wine and white wine to drink, for all such as wished.&quot; Edward I&#x27;s eldest son, Alphonso, Earl of Chester, died at Windsor on the feast of St Magnus, 19 August 1284. Stow records that &quot;in the year 1293, for victory obtained by Edward I against the Scots, every citizen, according to their several trade, made their several show, but especially the fishmongers&quot; whose solemn procession including a knight &quot;representing St Magnus, because it was upon St Magnus&#x27; day&quot;.

Alderman Hugh Pourt, fishmonger and Sheriff of London, and his wife Margaret founded a perpetual chantry at the start of the 14th century. An important religious guild, the Confraternity de Salve Regina, was in existence by 1343, having been founded by the &quot;better sort of the Parish of St Magnus&quot; to sing the anthem &#x27;Salve Regina&#x27; every evening. The Guild certificates of 1388/89 (12 Richard II) record that the Confraternity of Salve Regina and the guild of St Thomas the Martyr in the chapel on the bridge, whose members belonged to St Magnus parish, had determined to become one, to have the anthem of St Thomas after the Salve Regina and to devote their united resources to restoring and enlarging the church of St Magnus. An act of Parliament of 1437, the Guilds and Fraternities Act 1436 (15 Hen. 6. c. 6), provided that all incorporated fraternities and companies should register their charters and have their ordinances approved by the civic authorities. Fear of enquiry into their privileges may have led established fraternities to seek a firm foundation for their rights. The letters patent of the fraternity of St Mary and St Thomas the Martyr of Salve Regina in St Magnus dated 26 May 1448 mention that the fraternity had petitioned for a charter on the grounds that the society was not duly founded.

In the mid-14th century the Pope was the Patron of the living and appointed five rectors to the benefice.

Henry Yevele, the master mason whose work included the rebuilding of Westminster Hall, the naves of Westminster Abbey and Canterbury Cathedral and the tomb of John of Gaunt and his first wife Blanche of Lancaster in old St Paul&#x27;s, was a parishioner and rebuilt the chapel on London Bridge between 1384 and 1397. He served as a warden of London Bridge and was buried at St Magnus on his death in 1400. His monument was extant in John Stow&#x27;s time, but was probably destroyed by the fire of 1666.

Yevele, as the King&#x27;s Mason, was overseen by Geoffrey Chaucer in his capacity as the Clerk of the King&#x27;s Works. In &quot;The General Prologue&quot; of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; the five guildsmen &quot;were clothed alle in o lyveree of a solempne and a greet fraternitee&quot; and may be thought of as belonging to the guild in the parish of St Magnus, or one like it. Chaucer&#x27;s family home was near to the bridge in Thames Street. St Magnus appears several times in Anya Seton&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Katherine&quot;, which is set in the 14th century.

===15th and 16th centuries: before and after the Reformation===

In 1417 a dispute arose concerning who should take the place of honour amongst the rectors in the City churches at the Whit Monday procession, a place that had been claimed from time to time by the rectors of St Peter Cornhill, St Magnus the Martyr and St Nicholas Cole Abbey. The Mayor and Aldermen decided that the Rector of St Peter Cornhill should take precedence.

In 1413 John Hert, grocer, bequeathed £40 to the parish to build a new south aisle. Two adjoining plots of land laying to the south of the nave were donated to the church, one by Henry Yevele in 1400, and the other by John Hale, Goldsmith, in 1426. This site was quickly developed into a cloister, used primarily as a graveyard, but undoubtedly with additional symbolic and processional purposes. For example, Henry Crane, citizen and fletcher, requested burial in the cloister of St Magnus Martyr and left 3s 4d to the parish clerks&#x27; brotherhood to pray for his soul in his will of 18 July, proved 4 August 1486.

St Magnus Corner at the north end of London Bridge was an important meeting place in mediaeval London, where notices were exhibited, proclamations read out and wrongdoers punished. As it was conveniently close to the River Thames, the church was chosen by the Bishop between the 15th and 17th centuries as a convenient venue for general meetings of the clergy in his diocese.

St Magnus maintained a group of singing children from the 1470s until the 1550s.
In pictures from the mid-16th century the old church looks very similar to the present-day St Giles without Cripplegate in the Barbican. The London and Middlesex Chantry Certificate of 1548 listed the value of chantries attached to the church and the Fraternity of Salve Regina, the annual income of the latter being £49 16s 8d. The wardens said that church lands had been used for the past 200 years to maintain the church. A sum of £9 p.a. was paid to Robert Saye, priest. By the 1550s Saye was a Vicar Choral at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and he probably moved from St Magnus when the chantry there was closed.

Dr John Young, Bishop of Callipolis (rector of St Magnus 1514–15) pronounced judgement on 16 December 1514 (with the Bishop of London and in the presence of Thomas More, then under-sheriff of London) in the heresy case concerning Richard Hunne. In the summer of 1527, Thomas Bilney preached a sermon at St Magnus criticising its newly-erected rood, awaiting gilding, as idolatrous. He was tried for heresy in December 1527 but recanted and was released. However, there was a co-ordinated campaign to discredit him, and he was tried again in 1531 after a relapse into heresy and was burned at the stake in Norwich on 19 August (St Magnus Day) 1531. A plaque erected in 1931 to mark the 400th anniversary of his death calls him the &quot;spiritual father of the Reformation in England&quot;.

Maurice Griffith was rector here from 1537 until his death in 1558, holding the Bishopric of Rochester as well from 1554. His funeral, held at St Magnus, was a splendid affair, with chief mourners Sir William Petre, Sir William Garrard and Simon Lowe. These last two were parishioners. Sir William Garrard, Master of the Haberdashers&#x27; Company, Alderman, Sheriff of London in 1553/53, Lord Mayor in 1555/56 and a Member of Parliament was born in the parish and buried at St Magnus in 1571.Simon Lowe was a Member of Parliament and Master of the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Company during the reign of Queen Mary and one of the jurors who acquitted Sir Nicholas Throckmorton in 1554.

The patronage of St Magnus, having previously been in the Abbots and Convents of Westminster and Bermondsey (who presented alternately), fell to the Crown on the suppression of the monasteries. In 1553, Queen Mary, by letters patent, granted it to the Bishop of London and his successors. According to the martyrologist John Foxe, a woman was imprisoned in the &#x27;cage&#x27; on London Bridge in April 1555 and told to &quot;cool herself there&quot; for refusing to pray at St Magnus for the recently deceased Pope Julius III.

John Rylie, citizen and haberdasher, bequeathed his dwelling house at the north end of London Bridge to charity in 1577. Sir William Romney, merchant, philanthropist, Master of the Haberdashers&#x27; Company, Alderman for Bridge Within and Sheriff of London in 1603/04 was married at St Magnus in 1582. Ben Jonson is believed to have been married at St Magnus in 1594.

The church had a series of distinguished rectors in the second half of the 16th and first half of the 17th century, including Myles Coverdale (Rector 1564–66), John Young (Rector 1566–92), Theophilus Aylmer (Rector 1592–1625), (Archdeacon of London and son of John Aylmer), and Cornelius Burges (Rector 1626–41). Coverdale was buried in the chancel of St Bartholomew-by-the-Exchange, but when that church was pulled down in 1840 his remains were removed to St Magnus.

St Magnus&#x27;s rood, along with &quot;several other things of superstition belonging to that church&quot;, were destroyed on 16 September 1559 in &quot;an ebullition of Protestant zeal&quot; On 5 November 1562 the churchwardens were ordered to break, or cause to be broken, in two parts all the altar stones in the church. Coverdale, an anti-vestiarian, was Rector at the peak of the vestments controversy. In March 1566 Archbishop Parker caused great consternation among many clergy by his edicts prescribing what was to be worn and by his summoning the London clergy to Lambeth to require their compliance. Coverdale excused himself from attending. Stow records that a non-conforming Scot who normally preached at St Magnus twice a day precipitated a fight on Palm Sunday 1566 at Little All Hallows in Thames Street with his preaching against vestments. Coverdale&#x27;s resignation from St Magnus in summer 1566 may have been associated with these events. Separatist congregations started to emerge after 1566 and the first such, who called themselves &#x27;Puritans&#x27; or &#x27;Unspottyd Lambs of the Lord&#x27;, was discovered close to St Magnus at Plumbers&#x27; Hall in Thames Street on 19 June 1567.

===17th century: Civil War, Commonwealth and Restoration===


St Magnus narrowly escaped destruction in 1633. A later edition of Stow&#x27;s &quot;Survey&quot; records that &quot;On the 13th day of February, between eleven and twelve at night, there happened in the house of one Briggs, a Needle-maker near St Magnus Church, at the North end of the Bridge, by the carelessness of a Maid-Servant setting a tub of hot sea-coal ashes under a pair of stairs, a sad and lamentable fire, which consumed all the buildings before eight of the clock the next morning, from the North end of the Bridge to the first vacancy on both sides, containing forty-two houses; water then being very scarce, the Thames being almost frozen over.&quot; Susannah Chambers &quot;by her last will &amp; testament bearing date 28th December 1640 gave the sum of Twenty-two shillings and Sixpence Yearly for a Sermon to be preached on the 12th day of February in every Year within the Church of Saint Magnus in commemoration of God&#x27;s merciful preservation of the said Church of Saint Magnus from Ruin, by the late and terrible Fire on London Bridge. Likewise Annually to the Poor the sum of 17/6.&quot; The tradition of a &quot;Fire Sermon&quot; was revived on 12 February 2004, when the first preacher was the Rt Revd and Rt Hon Richard Chartres, Bishop of London.

Parliamentarian rule and the more Protestant ethos of the 1640s led to the removal or destruction of &quot;superstitious&quot; and &quot;idolatrous&quot; images and fittings. Glass painters such as Baptista Sutton, who had previously installed &quot;Laudian innovations&quot;, found new employment by repairing and replacing these to meet increasingly strict Protestant standards. In January 1642 Sutton replaced 93 feet of glass at St Magnus and in June 1644 he was called back to take down the &quot;painted imagery glass&quot; and replace it. In June 1641 &quot;rail riots&quot; broke out at a number of churches. This was a time of high tension following the trial and execution of the Earl of Strafford and rumours of army and popish plots were rife. The Protestation Oath, with its pledge to defend the true religion &quot;against all Popery and popish innovation&quot;, triggered demands from parishioners for the removal of the rails as popish innovations which the Protestation had bound them to reform. The minister arranged a meeting between those for and against the pulling down of the rails, but was unsuccessful in reaching a compromise and it was feared that they would be demolished by force. However, in 1663 the parish resumed Laudian practice and re-erected rails around its communion table.

Joseph Caryl was incumbent from 1645 until his ejection in 1662. In 1663 he was reportedly living near London Bridge and preaching to an Independent congregation that met at various places in the City.

During the Great Plague of 1665, the City authorities ordered fires to be kept burning night and day, in the hope that the air would be cleansed. Daniel Defoe&#x27;s semi-fictional, but highly realistic, work &quot;A Journal of the Plague Year&quot; records that one of these was &quot;just by St Magnus Church&quot;.

===Great Fire of London and rebuilding of the church===

Despite its escape in 1633, the church was one of the first buildings to be destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. St Magnus stood less than 300 yards from the bakehouse of Thomas Farriner in Pudding Lane where the fire started. Farriner, a former churchwarden of St Magnus, was buried in the middle aisle of the church on 11 December 1670, perhaps within a temporary structure erected for holding services.

The parish engaged the master mason George Dowdeswell to start the work of rebuilding in 1668. The work was carried forward between 1671 and 1687 under the direction of Sir Christopher Wren, the body of the church being substantially complete by 1676. At a cost of £9,579 19s 10d St Magnus was one of Wren&#x27;s most expensive churches. The church of St Margaret New Fish Street was not rebuilt after the fire and its parish was united to that of St Magnus.

The chancels of many of Wren&#x27;s city churches had chequered marble floors and the chancel of St Magnus is an example, the parish agreeing after some debate to place the communion table on a marble ascent with steps and to commission altar rails of Sussex wrought iron. The nave and aisles are paved with freestone flags. A lantern and cupola, closely modelled on the steeple built between 1614 and 1624 by François d&#x27;Aguilon and Pieter Huyssens for the church of St Carolus Borromeus in Antwerp, was added between 1703 and 1706. London&#x27;s skyline was transformed by Wren&#x27;s tall steeples and that of St Magnus is considered to be one of his finest.

The large clock projecting from the tower was a well-known landmark in the city as it hung over the roadway of Old London Bridge. It was presented to the church in 1709 by Sir Charles Duncombe (Alderman for the Ward of Bridge Within and, in 1708/09, Lord Mayor of London). Tradition says &quot;that it was erected in consequence of a vow made by the donor, who, in the earlier part of his life, had once to wait a considerable time in a cart upon London Bridge, without being able to learn the hour, when he made a promise, that if he ever became successful in the world, he would give to that Church a public clock ... that all passengers might see the time of day.&quot; The maker was Langley Bradley, a clockmaker in Fenchurch Street, who had worked for Wren on many other projects, including the clock for the new St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The sword rest in the church, designed to hold the Lord Mayor&#x27;s sword and mace when he attended divine service &quot;in state&quot;, dates from 1708.

Duncombe and his benefactions to St Magnus feature prominently in Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;The True-Born Englishman&quot;, a biting satire on critics of William III that went through several editions from 1700 (the year in which Duncombe was elected Sheriff).

Shortly before his death in 1711, Duncombe commissioned an organ for the church, the first to have a swell-box, by Abraham Jordan (father and son). The &quot;Spectator&quot; announced that &quot;Whereas Mr Abraham Jordan, senior and junior, have, with their own hands, joinery excepted, made and erected a very large organ in St Magnus&#x27; Church, at the foot of London Bridge, consisting of four sets of keys, one of which is adapted to the art of emitting sounds by swelling notes, which never was in any organ before; this instrument will be publicly opened on Sunday next [14 February 1712], the performance by Mr John Robinson. The above-said Abraham Jordan gives notice to all masters and performers, that he will attend every day next week at the said Church, to accommodate all those gentlemen who shall have a curiosity to hear it&quot;.

The organ case, which remains in its original state, is looked upon as one of the finest existing examples of the Grinling Gibbons school of wood carving. The first organist of St Magnus was John Robinson (1682–1762), who served in that role for fifty years (1712–62) and in addition as organist of Westminster Abbey from 1727. Other organists have included Henry Heron (1738–95, organist 1762-95), the blind organist George Warne (1792–1868, organist 1820–26 until his appointment to the Temple Church), James Coward (1824–80, organist 1868–80 who was also organist to the Crystal Palace and renowned for his powers of improvisation) and George Frederick Smith FRCO (1856–1918, organist 1880–1918 and Professor of Music at the Guildhall School of Music). The organ has been restored several times since it was first built: in 1760 by John Sedgewick, 1782 by Thomas Parker and John Frost, 1804 by George Parsons, 1855 by Gray &amp; Davison, 1861 by T Hill &amp; Son, 1879 by Messrs Brindley &amp; Foster, 1891 by Hill &amp; Son, 1924 and, after wartime damage, 1949 by R. Spurden Rutt &amp; Co, and 1997 by Hill, Norman &amp; Beard Sir Peter Maxwell Davies was one of several patrons of the organ appeal in the mid-1990s and John Scott gave an inaugural recital on 20 May 1998 following the completion of that restoration. The instrument has an Historic Organ Certificate and full details are recorded in the National Pipe Organ Register.

The hymn tune &quot;St Magnus&quot;, usually sung at Ascensiontide to the text &quot;The head that once was crowned with thorns&quot;, was written by Jeremiah Clarke in 1701 and named for the church.

===Last years of old London Bridge===

Canaletto drew St Magnus and old London Bridge as they appeared in the late 1740s. Between 1756 and 1762, under the London Bridge Improvement Act 1756 (29 Geo. 2. c. 40), the Corporation of London demolished the buildings on London Bridge to widen the roadway, ease traffic congestion and improve safety for pedestrians. The churchwardens&#x27; accounts of St Magnus list many payments to those injured on the Bridge and record that in 1752 a man was crushed to death between two carts. In the summer of 1724 the churchwardens had been obliged to spend 1/6 on &quot;Expenses with the churchwardens of Woodford about taking away their pentioner Jane Taverner killed [by a cart] on the Bridge&quot;

After the House of Commons had resolved upon the alteration of London Bridge, the Rev Robert Gibson (Rector 1747-91) applied to the House for relief; stating that 48l. 6s. 2d. per annum, part of his salary of 170l. per annum, was assessed upon houses on London Bridge; which he should utterly lose by their removal unless a clause in the bill about to be passed should provide a remedy. Accordingly, Sections 18 and 19 of London Bridge Improvement Act 1756 provided that the relevant amounts of tithe and poor rate should be a charge on the Bridge House Estates.

A serious fire broke out on 18 April 1760 in an oil shop at the south-east corner of the church, which consumed most of the church roof and did considerable damage to the fabric. The fire burnt warehouses to the south of the church and a number of houses on the northern end of London Bridge.

As part of the bridge improvements, overseen by the architect Sir Robert Taylor, a new pedestrian walkway was built along the eastern side of the bridge. With the other buildings gone St Magnus blocked the new walkway. As a consequence it was necessary in 1762 to 1763 to remove the vestry rooms at the West end of the church and open up the side arches of the tower so that people could pass underneath the tower. The tower&#x27;s lower storey thus became an external porch and two windows were lost from the north facade. Internally a lobby was created at the West end under the organ gallery and a screen with fine octagonal glazing inserted. A new vestry was built to the south of the church. The Act also provided that the land taken from the church for the widening was &quot;to be considered ... as part of the cemetery of the said church ... but if the pavement thereof be broken up on account of the burying of any persons, the same shall be ... made good ... by the churchwardens&quot;.

Soldiers were stationed in the Vestry House of St Magnus during the Gordon Riots in June 1780.

By 1782 the noise level from the activities of Billingsgate Fish Market had become unbearable and the large windows on the north side of the church were blocked up leaving only circular windows high up in the wall. The parapet and pediment above the north aisle door were probably removed at the same time. At some point between the 1760s and 1814 the present clerestory was constructed with its oval windows and fluted and coffered plasterwork. J. M. W. Turner painted the church in the mid-1790s.

The rector of St Magnus between 1792 and 1808, following the death of Robert Gibson on 28 July 1791, was Thomas Rennell FRS. Rennell was President of Sion College in 1806/07. There is a monument to Thomas Leigh (Rector 1808–48 and President of Sion College 1829/30), at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Goldhanger in Essex. Richard Hazard (1761–1837) was connected with the church as sexton, parish clerk and ward beadle for nearly 50 years and served as Master of the Parish Clerks&#x27; Company in 1831/32.

In 1825 the church was &quot;repaired and beautified at a very considerable expense. During the reparation the east window, which had been closed, was restored, and the interior of the fabric conformed to the state in which it was left by its great architect, Sir Christopher Wren. The magnificent organ ... was taken down and rebuilt by Mr Parsons, and re-opened, with the church, on the 12th February, 1826&quot;. Unfortunately, as a contemporary writer records, &quot;On the night of the 31st of July, 1827, [the church&#x27;s] safety was threatened by the great fire which consumed the adjacent warehouses, and it is perhaps owing to the strenuous and praiseworthy exertions of the firemen, that the structure exists at present. ... divine service was suspended and not resumed until the 20th January 1828. In the interval the church received such tasteful and elegant decorations, that it may now compete with any church in the metropolis.&quot;

===New London Bridge: a changing environment===

In 1823 royal assent was given to &#x27;An Act for the Rebuilding of London Bridge&#x27; and in 1825 John Garratt, Lord Mayor and Alderman of the Ward of Bridge Within, laid the first stone of the new London Bridge. In 1831 Sir John Rennie&#x27;s new bridge was opened further upstream and the old bridge demolished. St Magnus ceased to be the gateway to London as it had been for over 600 years. Peter de Colechurch had been buried in the crypt of the chapel on the bridge and his bones were unceremoniously dumped in the River Thames. In 1921 two stones from Old London Bridge were discovered across the road from the church. They now stand in the churchyard.

Wren&#x27;s church of St Michael Crooked Lane was demolished, the final service on Sunday 20 March 1831 having to be abandoned due to the effects of the building work. The Rector of St Michael preached a sermon the following Sunday at St Magnus lamenting the demolition of his church with its monuments and &quot;the disturbance of the worship of his parishioners on the preceding Sabbath&quot;. The parish of St Michael Crooked Lane was united to that of St Magnus, which itself lost a burial ground in Church Yard Alley to the approach road for the new bridge. However, in substitution it had restored to it the land taken for the widening of the old bridge in 1762 and was also given part of the approach lands to the east of the old bridge. In 1838 the Committee for the London Bridge Approaches reported to Common Council that new burial grounds had been provided for the parishes of St Michael, Crooked Lane and St Magnus, London Bridge.

Depictions of St Magnus after the building of the new bridge, seen behind Fresh Wharf and the new London Bridge Wharf, include paintings by W. Fenoulhet in 1841 and by Charles Ginner in 1913. This prospect was affected in 1924 by the building of Adelaide House to a design by John James Burnet, &quot;The Times&quot; commenting that &quot;the new &#x27;architectural Matterhorn&#x27; ... conceals all but the tip of the church spire&quot;. There was, however, an excellent view of the church for a few years between the demolition of Adelaide Buildings and the erection of its replacement. Adelaide House is now listed. Regis House, on the site of the abandoned King William Street terminus of the City &amp; South London Railway (subsequently the Northern Line), and the Steam Packet Inn, on the corner of Lower Thames Street and Fish Street Hill, were developed in 1931.

By the early 1960s traffic congestion had become a problem and Lower Thames Street was widened over the next decade to form part of a significant new east–west transport artery (the A3211). The setting of the church was further affected by the construction of a new London Bridge between 1967 and 1973. The New Fresh Wharf warehouse to the east of the church, built in 1939, was demolished in 1973-4 following the collapse of commercial traffic in the Pool of London and, after an archaeological excavation, St Magnus House was constructed on the site in 1978 to a design by R. Seifert &amp; Partners. This development now allows a clear view of the church from the east side. The site to the south-east of The Monument (between Fish Street Hill and Pudding Lane), formerly predominantly occupied by fish merchants, was redeveloped as Centurion House and Gartmore (now Providian) House at the time of the closure of old Billingsgate Market in January 1982. A comprehensive redevelopment of Centurion House (renamed Monument Place) began in October 2011 and the building was let in 2014. Regis House, to the south-west of The Monument, was redeveloped by Land Securities PLC in 1998.

The vista from The Monument south to the River Thames, over the roof of St Magnus, is protected under the City of London Unitary Development Plan, although the South bank of the river is now dominated by The Shard. Since 2004 the City of London Corporation has been exploring ways of enhancing the Riverside Walk to the south of St Magnus. Work on a new staircase to connect London Bridge to the Riverside Walk is due to commence in March 2013. The story of St Magnus&#x27;s relationship with London Bridge and an interview with the rector featured in the television programme &quot;The Bridges That Built London with Dan Cruickshank&quot;, first broadcast on BBC Four on 14 June 2012. The City Corporation&#x27;s &#x27;Fenchurch and Monument Area Enhancement Strategy&#x27; of August 2012 recommended ways of reconnecting St Magnus and the riverside to the area north of Lower Thames Street.

===Late 19th century and early 20th century===

A lectureship at St Michael, Crooked Lane, which was transferred to St Magnus in 1831, was endowed by the wills of Thomas and Susannah Townsend in 1789 and 1812 respectively. The Revd Henry Robert Huckin, Headmaster of Repton School from 1874 to 1882, was appointed Townsend Lecturer at St Magnus in 1871.

St Magnus narrowly escaped damage from a major fire in Lower Thames Street in October 1849.

During the second half of the 19th century the rectors were Alexander McCaul (1799–1863, Rector 1850–63), who coined the term &quot;Judaeo Christian&quot; in a letter dated 17 October 1821, and his son Alexander Israel McCaul (1835–1899, curate 1859–63, rector 1863–99). Another son, Joseph Benjamin McCaul (1827–92) served as curate from 1851 to 1854. The Revd Alexander McCaul Sr was a Christian missionary to the Polish Jews, who (having declined an offer to become the first Anglican bishop in Jerusalem) was appointed professor of Hebrew and rabbinical literature at King&#x27;s College London in 1841. His daughter, Elizabeth Finn (1825–1921), a noted linguist, was the wife of James Finn, the British Consul in Jerusalem from 1846 to 1863. She founded a number of organizations including the Jerusalem Literary Society, which was the forerunner to the Palestine Exploration Fund, the Society for the Relief of Persecuted Jews (Syrian Colonization Fund) and the Distressed Gentlefolk Aid Association (now known as Elizabeth Finn Care). Both McCaul and his daughter worked closely with Lord Shaftesbury.

In 1890 it was reported that the Bishop of London was to hold an inquiry as to the desirability of uniting the benefices of St George Botolph Lane and St Magnus. The expectation was a fusion of the two livings, the demolition of St George&#x27;s and the pensioning of &quot;William Gladstone&#x27;s favourite Canon&quot;, Malcolm MacColl. Although services ceased there, St George&#x27;s was not demolished until 1904. The parish was then merged with St Mary at Hill rather than St Magnus.

The patronage of the living was acquired in the late 19th century by Sir Henry Peek, Senior Partner of Peek Brothers &amp; Co of 20 Eastcheap, the country&#x27;s largest firm of wholesale tea brokers and dealers, and Chairman of the Commercial Union Assurance Co. Peek was a generous philanthropist who was instrumental in saving both Wimbledon Common and Burnham Beeches from development. His grandson, Sir Wilfred Peek, presented a cousin, Richard Peek, as rector in 1904. Peek, an ardent Freemason, held the office of Grand Chaplain of England. &quot;The Times&quot; recorded that his memorial service in July 1920 &quot;was of a semi-Masonic character, Mr Peek having been a prominent Freemason&quot;. In June 1895 Peek had saved the life of a young French girl who jumped overboard from a ferry midway between Dinard and St Malo in Brittany and was awarded the bronze medal of the Royal Humane Society and the Gold Medal 1st Class of the Sociâetâe Nationale de Sauvetage de France.

In November 1898 a memorial service was held at St Magnus for Sir Stuart Knill (1824–1898), head of the firm of John Knill and Co, wharfingers, and formerly Lord Mayor and Master of the Plumbers&#x27; Company. This was the first such service for a Roman Catholic taken in an Anglican church. Sir Stuart&#x27;s son, Sir John Knill (1856–1934), also served as Alderman for the Ward of Bridge Within, Lord Mayor and Master of the Plumbers&#x27; Company.

Until 1922 the annual Fish Harvest Festival was celebrated at St Magnus. The service moved in 1923 to St Dunstan in the East and then to St Mary at Hill, but St Magnus retained close links with the local fish merchants until the closure of old Billingsgate Market. St Magnus, in the 1950s, was &quot;buried in the stink of Billingsgate fish-market, against which incense was a welcome antidote&quot;.

A report in 1920 from a committee chaired by Lord Phillimore proposed the demolition of nineteen City churches, including St Magnus. A general outcry from members of the public and parishioners alike prevented the execution of this plan. The members of the City Livery Club passed a resolution that they regarded &quot;with horror and indignation the proposed demolition of 19 City churches&quot; and pledged the club to do everything in its power to prevent such a catastrophe. T. S. Eliot wrote that the threatened churches gave &quot;to the business quarter of London a beauty which its hideous banks and commercial houses have not quite defaced. ... the least precious redeems some vulgar street ... The loss of these towers, to meet the eye down a grimy lane, and of these empty naves, to receive the solitary visitor at noon from the dust and tumult of Lombard Street, will be irreparable and unforgotten.&quot; The London County Council published a report concluding that St Magnus was &quot;one of the most beautiful of all Wren&#x27;s works&quot; and &quot;certainly one of the churches which should not be demolished without specially good reasons and after very full consideration.&quot; Due to the uncertainty about the church&#x27;s future, the patron decided to defer action to fill the vacancy in the benefice and a curate-in-charge temporarily took responsibility for the parish. However, on 23 April 1921 it was announced that the Revd Henry Joy Fynes-Clinton would be the new rector. &quot;The Times&quot; concluded that the appointment, with the bishop&#x27;s approval, meant that the proposed demolition would not be carried out. Fr Fynes-Clinton was inducted on 31 May 1921.
A further attempt to implement the recommendations of the Phillimore Report in 1926 was resisted by the Earl of Crawford in a debate in the House of Lords on 15 July 1926 who quoted &quot;to your Lordships the list of these condemned churches. It will not take a moment. Even their fine resounding names are worthy of quotation... St. Magnus the Martyr – many of your Lordships must know that wonderful church by the water&#x27;s edge down below London Bridge&quot;.

The rectory, built by Robert Smirke in 1833-5, was at 39 King William Street. A decision was taken in 1909 to sell the property, the intention being to purchase a new rectory in the suburbs, but the sale fell through and at the time of the 1910 Land Tax Valuations the building was being let out to a number of tenants. The rectory was sold by the diocese on 30 May 1921 for £8,000 to Ridgways Limited, which owned the adjoining premises. The Vestry House adjoining the south-west of the church, replacing the one built in the 1760s, may also have been by Smirke. Part of the burial ground of St Michael, Crooked Lane, located between Fish Street Hill and King William Street, survived as an open space until 1987 when it was compulsorily purchased to facilitate the extension of the Docklands Light Railway into the City. The bodies were reburied at Brookwood Cemetery.

===Between the wars: Fr Fynes and the Anglo-Catholic tradition===

The interior of the church was restored by Martin Travers in 1924, in a neo-baroque style, reflecting the Anglo-Catholic character of the congregation following the appointment of Henry Joy Fynes-Clinton as rector. Fynes-Clinton served as rector of St Magnus from 31 May 1921 until his death on 4 December 1959 and substantially beautified the interior of the church.

Fynes-Clinton held very strong Anglo-Catholic views, and proceeded to make St Magnus as much like a baroque Roman Catholic church as possible. However, &quot;he was such a loveable character with an old-world courtesy which was irresistible, that it was difficult for anyone to be unpleasant to him, however much they might disapprove of his views&quot;. He generally said the Roman Mass in Latin; and in personality was &quot;grave, grand, well-connected and holy, with a laconic sense of humour&quot;. To a Protestant who had come to see Coverdale&#x27;s monument he is reported to have said &quot;We have just had a service in the language out of which he translated the Bible.&quot; The use of Latin in services was not, however, without grammatical danger. A response from his parishioners of &quot;Ora pro nobis&quot; after &quot;Omnes sancti Angeli et Archangeli&quot; in the Litany of the Saints would elicit a pause and the correction &quot;No, Ora&quot;te&quot; pro nobis.&quot;

In 1922 Fynes-Clinton refounded the Fraternity of Our Lady de Salve Regina. The fraternity&#x27;s badge is shown in the stained glass window at the east end of the north wall of the church above the reredos of the Lady Chapel altar. He also erected a statue of Our Lady of Walsingham and arranged pilgrimages to the Norfolk shrine, where he was one of the founding guardians. In 1928 the journal of the Catholic League reported that St Magnus had presented a votive candle to the shrine at Walsingham &quot;in token of our common Devotion and the mutual sympathy and prayers that are we hope a growing bond between the peaceful country shrine and the church in the heart of the hurrying City, from the Altar of which the Pilgrimages regularly start&quot;.

Fynes-Clinton was General Secretary of the Anglican and Eastern Orthodox Churches Union and its successor, the Anglican and Eastern Churches Association, from 1906 to 1920 and served as Secretary to the Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s Eastern Churches Committee from 1920 to around 1924. A Solemn Requiem was celebrated at St Magnus in September 1921 for the late King Peter of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

At the midday service on 1 March 1922, Ash Wednesday, J. A. Kensit, leader of the Protestant Truth Society, got up and protested against the form of worship. The proposed changes to the church in 1924 led to a hearing in the Consistory Court of the Chancellor of the Diocese of London and an appeal to the Court of Arches. Judgement was given by the latter Court in October 1924. The advowson was purchased in 1931, without the knowledge of the Rector and Parochial Church Council, by the evangelical Sir Charles King-Harman. A number of such cases, including the purchase of the advowsons of Clapham and Hampstead Parish Churches by Sir Charles, led to the passage of the Benefices (Purchase of Rights of Patronage) Measure 1933. This allowed the parishioners of St Magnus to purchase the advowson from Sir Charles King-Harman for £1,300 in 1934 and transfer it to the Patronage Board.

St Magnus was one of the churches that held special services before the opening of the second Anglo-Catholic Congress in 1923. Fynes-Clinton was the first incumbent to hold lunchtime services for City workers. Pathé News filmed the Palm Sunday procession at St Magnus in 1935. In &quot;The Towers of Trebizond&quot;, the novel by Rose Macaulay published in 1956, Fr Chantry-Pigg&#x27;s church is described as being several feet higher than St Mary&#x27;s, Bourne Street and some inches above even St Magnus the Martyr.

In July 1937 Fr Fynes-Clinton, with two members of his congregation, travelled to Kirkwall to be present at the 800th anniversary celebrations of St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall. During their stay they visited Egilsay and were shown the spot where St Magnus had been slain. Later Fynes-Clinton was present at a service held at the roofless church of St Magnus on Egilsay, where he suggested to his host Mr Fryer, the minister of the Cathedral, that the congregations of Kirkwall and London should unite to erect a permanent stone memorial on the traditional site where Earl Magnus had been murdered. In 1938 a cairn was built of local stone on Egilsay. It stands 12 feet high and is 6 feet broad at its base. The memorial was dedicated on 7 September 1938 and a bronze inscription on the monument reads &quot;erected by the Rector and Congregation of St Magnus the Martyr by London Bridge and the Minister and Congregation of St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall to commemorate the traditional spot where Earl Magnus was slain, AD circa 1116 and to commemorate the Octocentenary of St Magnus Cathedral 1937&quot;.

===World War II to 21st century===

A bomb which fell on London Bridge in 1940 during the Blitz of World War II blew out all the windows and damaged the plasterwork and the roof of the north aisle. However, the church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950 and repaired in 1951, being re-opened for worship in June of that year by the Bishop of London, William Wand. The architect was Laurence King. &quot;At St Magnus the Martyr almost the whole of the plaster work had to be reproduced. Fortunately, as in some other cases, the furniture had been safely stored, but against £16,000 only £9,000 was recoverable.&quot; Restoration and redecoration work has subsequently been carried out several times, including after a fire in the early hours of 4 November 1995. Cleaning of the exterior stonework was completed in 2010.

Some minor changes were made to the parish boundary in 1954, including the transfer to St Magnus of an area between Fish Street Hill and Pudding Lane. The site of St Leonard Eastcheap, a church that was not rebuilt after the Great Fire, is therefore now in the parish of St Magnus despite being united to St Edmund the King.

Fr Fynes-Clinton marked the 50th anniversary of his priesthood in May 1952 with High Mass at St Magnus and lunch at Fishmongers&#x27; Hall. On 20 September 1956 a solemn Mass was sung in St Magnus to commence the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the restoration of the Holy House at Walsingham in 1931. In the evening of that day a reception was held in the large chamber of Caxton Hall, when between three and four hundred guests assembled.

Fr Fynes-Clinton was succeeded as rector in 1960 by Fr Colin Gill, formerly Vicar of St Martin&#x27;s Brighton, who remained as incumbent until his death in 1983. Fr Gill was also closely connected with Walsingham and served as a Guardian between 1953 and 1983, including nine years as Master of the College of Guardians. He celebrated the Mass at the first National Pilgrimage in 1959 and presided over the Jubilee celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the Shrine in 1981, having been present at the Holy House&#x27;s opening. A number of the congregation of St Stephen&#x27;s Lewisham moved to St Magnus around 1960, following temporary changes in the form of worship there.

In 1971 a Commission chaired by Lord Justice Buckley proposed changes to the City churches, including the creation of seven team ministries. St Magnus would have been part of a Fenchurch team along with All Hallows by the Tower, St Olave&#x27;s Hart Street and St Margaret Pattens. In 1994 the Templeman Commission proposed a radical restructuring of the churches in the City Deanery. St Magnus was identified as one of the 12 churches that would remain as either a parish or an &#x27;active&#x27; church. However, the proposals were dropped following a public outcry and the consecration of a new Bishop of London. Following the departure of Fr Michael Woodgate (Rector 1984 to 1995) the presentation to the living was suspended until 2010. The Ven Ken Gibbons was Priest-in-Charge from 1997 to 2003.

The parish priest since 2003 has been Fr Philip Warner, who was previously priest-in-charge of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Belgrade (Diocese in Europe) and Apokrisiarios for the Archbishop of Canterbury to the Serbian Orthodox Church. Since January 2004 there has been an annual Blessing of the Thames, with the congregations of St Magnus and Southwark Cathedral meeting in the middle of London Bridge. On Sunday 3 July 2011, in anticipation of the feast of the translation of St Thomas Becket (7 July), a procession from St Magnus brought a relic of the saint to the middle of the bridge. On 25 May 2016, as part of a joint initiative between the Church of England and the Catholic Church of England and Wales, a relic of St Thomas Becket from Esztergom in Hungary was brought to St Magnus for veneration followed by Solemn Pontifical Vespers celebrated by the Revd Jonathan Baker, Bishop of Fulham. The Bishop of the Diocese of Szeged–Csanád, The Rt Revd László Kiss-Rigó, gave a short homily on the history of the relic.

William Petter was Director of Music from 2011 until his death in 2016, having been a founder member of the Choir of St Magnus the Martyr in 2005. His predecessor was Thomas Kennedy, and successor was Lottie Bagnall. William Johnston Davies took over in 2020, before the current Director, Edward Walters, commenced in September 2023. The choir issued CDs in 2013 (&quot;Regina Coeli&quot;) and 2014 (&quot;Inexplicable Splendour&quot;). St Magnus&#x27;s organist, John Eady, has won composition competitions for new choral works at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral (a setting of &quot;Veni Sancte Spiritus&quot; first performed on 27 May 2012) and at Lincoln Cathedral (a setting of the Matin responsory for Advent first performed on 30 November 2013). Joseph Atkins composed three pieces for the church: &quot;Missa Sancti Magni&quot;, &quot;Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis&quot; and &quot;The Blessing of the Bells&quot;, a litany and antiphon for the consecration of the new bells in 2009. David Pearson composed two pieces, the Communion anthem &quot;A Mhànais mo rùin&quot; (O Magnus of my love) and a hymn to St Magnus, &quot;Nobilis, humilis&quot;, for performance at the church on the feast of St Magnus the Martyr on 16 April 2012.

In addition to liturgical music of a high standard, St Magnus has been the venue for a range of musical events. The Clemens non Papa Consort, founded in 2005, has performed in collaboration with the production team Concert Bites as a resident ensemble. The band &quot;Mishaped Pearls&quot; performed at the church on 17 December 2011. St Magnus featured in the television programme &quot;Jools Holland: London Calling&quot;, first broadcast on BBC2 on 9 June 2012. The Platinum Consort made a promotional film at St Magnus for the release of their debut album &quot;In the Dark&quot; on 2 July 2012.

The Friends of the City Churches had their office in the Vestry House of St Magnus until 2013.

==Interior==

Martin Travers restored the 17th century high altar reredos, including the paintings of Moses and Aaron and the Ten Commandments, and reconstructed the upper storey. Above the reredos Travers added a painted and gilded rood. In the centre of the reredos there is a carved gilded pelican (an early Christian symbol of self-sacrifice) and a Baroque-style roundel with a nimbus and dove descending, attended by cherubim. The glazed east window, which can be seen in early photographs of the church, appears to have been filled in at this time. A new altar with console tables was installed and the communion rails moved outwards to extend the size of the sanctuary. Two old door frames were used to construct side chapels and placed at an angle across the north-east and south-east corners of the church. One, the Lady Chapel, was dedicated to the Rector&#x27;s parents in 1925 and the other was dedicated to Christ the King. Originally, a baroque aumbry was used for reservation of the Blessed Sacrament, but later a tabernacle was installed on the Lady Chapel altar and the aumbry was used to house a relic of the True Cross.

The interior was made to look more European by the removal of the old box pews and the installation of new pews with cut-down ends. Two new columns were inserted in the nave to make the lines regular. The Wren-period pulpit by the joiner William Grey was opened up and provided with a soundboard and crucifix. Travers also designed the statue of St Magnus of Orkney, which stands in the south aisle, and the statue of Our Lady of Walsingham.

On the north wall there is a Russian Orthodox icon, painted in 1908. The modern stations of the cross in honey-coloured Japanese oak are the work of Robert Randall and Ashley Sands. One of the windows in the north wall dates from 1671 and came from Plumbers&#x27; Hall in Chequer Yard, Bush Lane, which was demolished in 1863 to make way for Cannon Street railway station. A fireplace from the Hall was re-erected in the Vestry House. The other windows on the north side are by Alfred L. Wilkinson (1899–1983) and date from 1952 to 1960. These show the arms of the Plumbers&#x27;, Fishmongers&#x27; and Coopers&#x27; Companies together with those of William Wand when Bishop of London and Geoffrey Fisher when Archbishop of Canterbury and (as noted above) the badge of the Fraternity of Our Lady de Salve Regina.

The stained glass windows in the south wall, which are by Lawrence Lee and date from 1949 to 1955, represent lost churches associated with the parish: St Magnus and his ruined church of Egilsay, St Margaret of Antioch with her lost church in New Fish Street (where the Monument to the Great Fire now stands), St Michael with his lost church of Crooked Lane (demolished to make way for the present King William Street) and St Thomas Becket with his chapel on Old London Bridge.

The church possesses a fine model of Old London Bridge. One of the tiny figures on the bridge appears out of place in the mediaeval setting, wearing a policeman&#x27;s uniform. This is a representation of the model-maker, David T. Aggett, who is a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Plumbers and was formerly in the police service.

The Mischiefs by Fire Act 1708 and the Fires Prevention (Metropolis) Act 1774 placed a requirement on every parish to keep equipment to fight fires. The church owns two historic fire engines that belonged to the parish of St Michael, Crooked Lane. One of these is on display in the narthex of the church. The whereabouts of the other, which was misappropriated and sold at auction in 2003, is currently unknown.

In 1894 many bodies were disinterred from the crypt and reburied at the St Magnus&#x27;s plot at Brookwood Cemetery, which remains the church&#x27;s burial ground.

==Bells==

Prior to the Great Fire of 1666 the old tower had a ring of five bells, a small saints bell and a clock bell. 47 cwt of bell metal was recovered which suggests that the tenor was 13 or 14 cwt. The metal was used to cast three new bells, by William Eldridge of Chertsey in 1672, with a further saints bell cast that year by Hodson. In the absence of a tower, the tenor and saints bell were hung in a free standing timber structure, whilst the others remained unhung.

A new tower was completed in 1704 and it is likely that these bells were transferred to it. However, the tenor became cracked in 1713 and it was decided to replace the bells with a new ring of eight. The new bells, with a tenor of 21 cwt, were cast by Richard Phelps of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Between 1714 and 1718 (the exact date of which is unknown), the ring was increased to ten with the addition of two trebles given by two former ringing Societies, the Eastern Youths and the British Scholars. The first peal was rung on 15 February 1724 of Grandsire Caters by the Society of College Youths. The second bell had to be recast in 1748 by Robert Catlin, and the tenor was recast in 1831 by Thomas Mears of Whitechapel, just in time to ring for the opening of the new London Bridge. In 1843, the treble was said to be &quot;worn out&quot; and so was scrapped, together with the saints bell, while a new treble was cast by Thomas Mears. A new clock bell was erected in the spire in 1846, provided by B R &amp; J Moore, who had earlier purchased it from Thomas Mears. This bell can still be seen in the tower from the street.

The 10 bells were removed for safe keeping in 1940 and stored in the churchyard. They were taken to Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1951 whereupon it was discovered that four of them were cracked. After a long period of indecision, fuelled by lack of funds and interest, the bells were finally sold for scrap in 1976. The metal was used to cast many of the Bells of Congress that were then hung in the Old Post Office Tower in Washington, D.C.

A fund was set up on 19 September 2005, led by Dickon Love, a member of the Ancient Society of College Youths, with a view to installing a new ring of 12 bells in the tower in a new frame. This was the first of three new rings of bells he has installed in the City of London (the others being at St Dunstan-in-the-West and St James Garlickhythe). The money was raised and the bells were cast during 2008/9 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The tenor weighed 26cwt 3qtr 9 lbs (1360 kg) and the new bells were designed to be in the same key as the former ring of ten. They were consecrated by the Bishop of London on 3 March 2009 in the presence of the Lord Mayor and the ringing dedicated on 26 October 2009 by the Archdeacon of London. The bells are named (in order smallest to largest) Michael, Margaret, Thomas of Canterbury, Mary, Cedd, Edward the Confessor, Dunstan, John the Baptist, Erkenwald, Paul, Mellitus and Magnus. The bells project is recorded by an inscription in the vestibule of the church.

The first peal on the twelve was rung on 29 November 2009 of Cambridge Surprise Maximus. Notable other recent peals include a peal of Stedman Cinques on 16 April 2011 to mark the 400th anniversary of the granting of a Royal Charter to the Plumbers&#x27; Company, a peal of Cambridge Surprise Royal on 28 June 2011 when the Fishmongers&#x27; Company gave a dinner for Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh at their hall on the occasion of his 90th birthday and a peal of Avon Delight Maximus on 24 July 2011 in solidarity with the people of Norway following the tragic massacre on Utoeya Island and in Oslo. On the latter occasion the flag of the Orkney Islands was flown at half mast. In 2012 peals were rung during the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant on 3 June and during each of the three Olympic/Paralympic marathons, on 5 and 12 August and 9 September. Following the announcement on 9 April 2021 of the death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh the tenor bell was tolled 99 times and the flag of St George was lowered to half mast.

The BBC television programme, &quot;Still Ringing After All These Years: A Short History of Bells&quot;, broadcast on 14 December 2011, included an interview at St Magnus with the Tower Keeper, Dickon Love, who was captain of the band that rang the &quot;Royal Jubilee Bells&quot; during the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant on 3 June 2012 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. Prior to this, he taught John Barrowman to handle a bell at St Magnus for the BBC coverage.

The bells are often rung on Sundays around 12:15 (following the service) by the Guild of St Magnus.

==Livery companies and Bridge Ward==

St Magnus has connections with three livery companies, whose respective coats of arms are displayed in stained glass windows in the north aisle. Every other June, newly-elected wardens of the Fishmongers&#x27; Company, accompanied by the Court, proceed on foot from Fishmongers&#x27; Hall to St Magnus for an election service. St Magnus is also the Guild Church of The Plumbers&#x27; Company. Two former rectors have served as Master of the company, which holds all its services at the church. On 12 April 2011 a service was held to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the granting of the company&#x27;s Royal Charter at which the Bishop of London, the Rt Revd and Rt Hon Richard Chartres KCVO, gave the sermon and blessed the original Royal Charter. The Coopers&#x27; Company hold an annual service at which the will of Henry Cloker dated 10 March 1573 is read. Cloker left property in the parish of St Michael Crooked Lane to the Company in trust for the benefit of what is now the Coopers&#x27; Company and Coborn School.

St Magnus is also the ward church for the Ward of Bridge and Bridge Without, which elects one of the city&#x27;s aldermen. Between 1550 and 1978 there were separate aldermen for Bridge Within and Bridge Without, the former ward being north of the river and the latter representing the City&#x27;s area of control in Southwark. The Bridge Ward Club was founded in 1930 to &quot;promote social activities and discussion of topics of local and general interest and also to exchange ward and parochial information&quot; and holds its annual carol service at St Magnus.

<text>George L. Smith State Park is a Georgia state park located in Emanuel County. The park is named after George L. Smith, a former speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives and Emanuel County native. Attractions include a grist mill, covered bridge, and the dam of the Parrish Mill (built 1880). The park&#x27;s location on a mill pond dotted with many cypress trees makes it a destination for anglers and canoeists. The moderately-sized state park is in a remote location, making it an attraction for bird watchers and naturalists. Rare birds in residence include the great blue heron and the white ibis.

The lake/dam and mill host a museum documenting the history of the site, along with selected artifacts from the old grist mill, as well as educational materials on the 15 Mile Creek watershed and estuary.

*18 Tent/Trailer/RV Campsites
*8 Cottages
*1 Group Shelter
*1 Pioneer Campground
*Canoe Rental
*1 Group Shelter
*4 Picnic Shelters
* of walking trails, of canoe trails

==Habitat==
The park includes nature trails that wind over seven miles through sandy soil and pass through a bird sanctuary and a tortoise habitat. The many hardwoods also attract various woodpeckers, sap suckers, and other birds less often seen in the pine forests of southern Georgia. The old dunes of the lower Coastal Plain in the region features longleaf pines, wiregrass, turkey oaks, and a forest of dwarf oak. The loose soil is ideal for tortoise burrows, and the dense foliage of the wiregrass provides cover for a wide variety of wildlife.

==Pond==
The park features a prominent &quot;pond&quot; more than one mile long that (when full) ranges from deep near the edges, deep further out, in the middle of the &quot;red trail&quot; (in the flow of the original creek), and just in front of the mill house. In periods of extended drought the water level can drop considerably and some of the paddling trails around the perimeter can almost dry up. There are three paddling trails available; one that runs up the center of the pond, and one near each of the outside borders. Kayaks and canoes are available for rent. Inflatables are not recommended due to occasional submerged tree stumps.

<doc id="1202582" wikidata="Q7405007" url="?curid=1202582" title="Sallins Train robbery">
<text>The Sallins Train robbery occurred in Ireland on 31 March 1976 when the Cork to Dublin mail train was robbed near Sallins in County Kildare. Approximately £200,000 was stolen. Five members of the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP), Osgur Breatnach, Nicky Kelly, Brian McNally, Mick Plunkett and John Fitzpatrick, were arrested in connection with the robbery.

After the failure of the authorities to produce a &quot;book of evidence&quot; against them, the four were released but were immediately re-arrested. During interrogation in Garda Síochána custody, all except Plunkett signed alleged confessions, presenting with extensive bruising and injuries they claimed were inflicted by members of the Gardaí.

While awaiting trial, Fitzpatrick jumped bail and left the country. The trial of McNally, Kelly and Breatnach in the Special Criminal Court became the longest-running trial in Irish criminal history, at 65 days, before it collapsed due to the death of one of the three judges, Judge John O&#x27;Connor of the Circuit Court.

Medical evidence of beatings was presented to the court, both during the initial trial and the second trial. The court rejected this evidence, finding that the beatings had been self-inflicted or inflicted by the co-accused. Anticipating a conviction, Kelly fled before the conclusion of the second trial. The three were found guilty, solely on the basis of their confessions, and sentenced to between nine and 12 years&#x27; prison (Kelly was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot;).

In May 1980, Breatnach and McNally were acquitted on appeal on the grounds that their statements had been taken under duress. The same month, the Provisional IRA claimed responsibility for the robbery. Kelly returned to Ireland from the USA in June 1980, expecting to be acquitted. Instead he was incarcerated in the maximum-security Portlaoise Prison and spent the next four years proclaiming his innocence, including a 38-day period on hunger strike.

After a campaign by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Amnesty International and others (including a song, &quot;Wicklow Boy&quot;, by the popular folk singer Christy Moore), Kelly was eventually released on &quot;humanitarian grounds&quot; in 1984. He was given a Presidential pardon in 1992 and received £1,000,000 in compensation. Breatnach and McNally were also given compensation.

<text>Gwen Charles (born July 19, 1949, in Lindsay, Ontario) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. She was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 to 1990, representing the riding of Selkirk for the Manitoba Liberal Party.

The daughter of Allen Glover, she grew up in Belleville Ontario and began her career at the municipal level, serving as a councillor in the town of Selkirk. She married Garry James Gordon Charles in 1969. Charles first ran for provincial office in the election of 1986, finishing third in the Selkirk riding with 1023 votes. At the time, the riding&#x27;s MLA was New Democrat Howard Pawley, the provincial Premier.

In early 1988, Pawley&#x27;s government was unexpectedly defeated when disgruntled backbencher Jim Walding voted against his party&#x27;s annual budget in an evenly divided legislature. Pawley stepped down as premier and did not run in the election which followed. With the riding open, Charles was able to defeat NDP candidate Terry Sargeant by just 184 votes.

The Liberals increased their parliamentary representation from one to twenty in this election, and Charles spent the next two years in the official opposition. In 1990, she supported Paul Martin for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada.

Like many of her Liberal colleagues, she was defeated in the 1990 election amid a general decline in support for her party (once again, she placed third behind the NDP and Progressive Conservative candidates).

Gwen moved back to Ontario and built one of the first social enterprises, Pivotal Services of London, winning the Peter F. Drucker Award for Innovation.

It was loosely based on Asa Mercer&#x27;s efforts in the 1860s to import marriageable women (the Mercer Girls) from the East Coast cities of the United States to Seattle, where there was a shortage.

==Synopsis==

In the pilot episode, smooth-talking, charismatic logging company boss Jason Bolt (Robert Brown) is faced with a shutdown of his operation as lonely lumberjacks are ready to leave Seattle due to the lack of female companionship. He promises to find 100 marriageable ladies willing to come to the frontier town (population 152) and stay for a full year. Sawmill owner Aaron Stempel (Mark Lenard) puts up much of the expense money as a wager that Bolt will not succeed; the Bolt brothers bet Bridal Veil Mountain, home to their logging company.

The Bolts travel to New Bedford, Massachusetts, recruit the women, then charter a mule-ship to take them back to Seattle. Local saloon owner Lottie (Joan Blondell) takes the women under her wing and becomes a mother figure to them, while Bolt desperately works to keep the women from leaving at the next high tide.

Eventually, the women decide to give Seattle and the loggers a chance. The ship&#x27;s captain, Clancy (Henry Beckman), develops a relationship with Lottie and becomes a regular character in the series.

Much of the dramatic and comedic tension in the first season revolved around Stempel&#x27;s efforts to sabotage the deal so he can take over the Bolts&#x27; holdings. Stempel became more friendly in the second and final season, which focused more on the development of individual characters and the conflicts associated with newcomers and with people just passing through. One running theme is the importance of family, as the Bolt brothers show through the closeness of their relationships, that by sticking together, democratically taking family votes, they can overcome the surprising obstacles life presents.

Bobby Sherman and David Soul were propelled to pop stardom as Jason&#x27;s brothers, Jeremy and Joshua. Jeremy took a prominent role, not only as the boyfriend of Candy Pruitt (Bridget Hanley), the beautiful, unofficial leader of the brides, but also as a young man with a stammer. In one episode, he is temporarily able to manage his stammer following coaching by a traveler who has come to Seattle. Upon discovering that his benefactor is actually a con artist, his faith is shaken so deeply that the stammer returns.

==Background and production==
The producers said the show was inspired by the movie &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; in an interview with &quot;LA Times&quot; TV critic Cecil Smith.

As a television Western, set shortly after the end of the Civil War, the series rarely featured any form of gunplay, and violence was generally limited to comical fistfights. This was in keeping with the restrictions on television violence at the time. Stories highlighted the importance of cooperation, inter-racial harmony, and peaceful resolution of conflict. Plots were usually a mix of drama and humor. Being one of the first shows targeted at young women, most of the humor was at the expense of the men, but not particularly bitingly so.

The 1951 movie &quot;Westward the Women&quot; follows a similar theme.

The show addressed many social issues — racism, ethnic discrimination, treatment of the handicapped and mentally impaired, business ethics, and ecology.

=== Music ===
The theme song &quot;Seattle&quot; was composed by Hugo Montenegro with lyrics by Jack Keller and Ernie Sheldon. Both Perry Como and Bobby Sherman recorded slightly different variations of the song. Como&#x27;s version, recorded for his album of the same name, scored a minor hit, reaching No. 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and No. 2 on the Easy Listening chart. Sherman&#x27;s version, although receiving some airplay, was never released as a single. The actual show&#x27;s title is not included in the lyrics. Starting with the series debut in September 1968, the series opened with a rousing instrumental score featuring screen stills of &quot;Jason&quot;, &quot;Jeremy &amp; Joshua&quot;, &quot;Candy &amp; Aaron&quot; and &quot;Lottie&quot;. Starting with episode 8 (&quot;A Jew Named Sullivan&quot;) as evidenced by the end credits, and to coincide with the spring 1969 release of the Perry Como &#x27;pop&#x27; recording, the TV theme was reworked by overdubbing vocals/lyrics to the same theme music already recorded (as used previously) along with updating all the opening character stills, including the addition of a &quot;Clancy &amp; Biddie&quot; screen. The added lyrics performed by &quot;The New Establishment&quot; and updated screen stills were featured for the remainder of the first season and remained unchanged for the entire second season. In the beginning syndication years, the instrumental version of the opening credits was placed on all episodes. In recent years, the vocal theme of the opening credits has been restored to the second-season episodes (although with the first season screen stills).

Travanti, James B. Sikking, Larry Linville, and Billy Mumy all made guest appearances.

Mitzi Hoag, who played Miss Essie during the season 1, had two guest roles in season 2 as completely different characters, one as a Greek immigrant in the episode &quot;Land Grant&quot; and another as a nun in the episode &quot;Absalom&quot;.

==Episodes==
===Season 1 (1968–69)===
===Season 2 (1969–70)===
== Release ==

=== Syndication ===
Reruns were aired on CBN Cable during the mid-1980s.

Early in January 2011, digital sub-network Antenna TV began airing the series.

INSP began broadcasting a back to back 2 episode block of the series on Sunday mornings in 2018 continuing through 2020.

The Decades channel aired most of the series during a weekend marathon on June 2–3, 2018; February 1–2, 2019 and again January 23–24, 2021 in widescreen format. The episodes were cropped for the widescreen presentation.

In autumn 2021 the series began airing on MeTV+.

In January 2022 GetTV began airing episodes in a 75 minute format on Saturday &amp; Sunday at 11:15 am Eastern.

==Reception==
First season ratings were impressive enough to ensure its renewal for a second season, though only 152 ABC affiliates agreed to broadcast the series, compared to another Screen Gems&#x27; series, &quot;Bewitched&quot;, which was broadcast on 217 ABC affiliates in the same 1968/69 season, prompting ABC affiliated radio and television stations to add a voice-over in all related &quot;HCTB&quot; promotional commercials inviting viewers to watch &quot; ...&quot;Here Come the Brides&quot;!, Wednesdays at 7:30, 6:30 central, over MOST of these ABC stations!&quot; For the second season, the family-geared series was moved from the 7:30 Wednesday night &quot;Family Hour&quot; to the more adult-oriented time slot of 9:00 Friday night in September 1969. This move to the Friday night death slot combined with the low ABC affiliate support caused the ratings to quickly slide out of the top 40, and production ceased in the spring of 1970, although most of those ABC affiliates repeated episodes throughout the summer months, as was then a standard procedure with most series. The final primetime episode in the United States was broadcast on Friday September 18, 1970.
Joan Blondell received Emmy Award nominations each season for her performance as Lottie Hatfield. She lost to Barbara Bain in 1969, and to Susan Hampshire in 1970.

== Media information ==

=== French version ===
A French-language version of the show and theme song (performed by a chorus of male singers) was a smash hit in French Canada, under the title &quot;Cent filles à marier&quot; (&quot;A Hundred Girls to Marry Off&quot;). The show capitalized on the popularity of the American version and the fact that a similar &quot;bride drive&quot; (see Filles du roi) is also part of Québec&#x27;s cultural mythos.

=== Home media and books ===
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the first season on DVD in Region 1 on May 16, 2006.

On October 14, 2011, Shout! Factory announced that it had acquired the home-media rights to the series, and it later released the final season on DVD. It was subsequently released on February 28, 2012. However, the season 1 opening cast-and-credit sequence was used for this release, using the New Establishment&#x27;s vocals, but ignoring Henry Beckman&#x27;s and Susan Tolsky&#x27;s respective credits.

In December 2009, BearManor Media released a nostalgic look into the program&#x27;s history, &quot;Gangway, Lord: (The) Here Come The Brides Book&quot; by Jonathan Etter, which featured a foreword by Robert Brown. Bobby Sherman was the only (then) surviving cast member who did not cooperate with the author. However, Sherman did discuss the series in his autobiography, &quot;Bobby Sherman: Still Remembering You,&quot; whose contents he dictated to Dena Hill, and was subsequently published by Contemporary Books in 1996.

=== &quot;Star Trek&quot; crossovers ===
Barbara Hambly&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel &quot;Ishmael&quot; has Spock traveling back to the time and place of &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot; after discovering a Klingon plot to destroy the Federation by killing Aaron Stempel (spelled &quot;Stemple&quot; in the book) before he could thwart an attempted 19th-century alien invasion of Earth. During most of the story, Spock has lost his memory and is cared for by Stempel, who passes him off as his nephew &quot;Ishmael&quot; and helps him hide his alien origins.

At the end of the story, Captain Kirk discovers that Stempel is one of Spock&#x27;s mother&#x27;s ancestors, a reference to the fact that Mark Lenard also played Spock&#x27;s father Sarek in episodes of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, as well as several of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; motion pictures. Also the same actor played descendants of Mr. Spock on his father&#x27;s and his mother&#x27;s sides of the family.

Majel Barrett, who played Nurse Christine Chapel in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, appeared as Tessa a dancehall woman in the first-season episode &quot;Lovers and Wanderers&quot;.

Jane Wyatt who played Spock&#x27;s mother in the original series, made a guest appearance in the final episode of the series, &quot;Two Women&quot;. She did not have any scenes with Mark Lenard.

In addition to Lenard, other &quot;Brides&quot; actors appeared in &quot;Star Trek&quot;: Robert Brown (both of the Lazaruses in &quot;The Alternative Factor&quot;), David Soul (Makora in &quot;The Apple&quot;), and semi-regular Carole Shelyne (the visible representation of a Metron in &quot;Arena&quot;, whose voice Vic Perrin provided in that installment).

<doc id="1202593" wikidata="Q5014327" url="?curid=1202593" title="CSS Owl">
<text>CSS Owl was a blockade runner in the Confederate States Navy during the American Civil War. It was built by Jones Quiggen, a ship builder in Liverpool, England and launched on June 21, 1864.

&quot;Owl&quot;, sister to CSS &quot;Bat&quot;, was more fortunate than her twin which followed her closely. &quot;Owl&quot; succeeded in running into Wilmington, North Carolina sometime in September 1864, although United States Consul Mortimer Melville Jackson telegraphed Washington, D.C. that &quot;Owl&quot; had &quot;a large, valuable cargo&quot; cleared August 31—officially for Nassau, Bahamas. She escaped to sea from Wilmington on October 3; her masts were visible all the while she lay in port loading. The blockaders wounded her captain and several crewmen, but 9 shots failed to stop &quot;Owl&quot;.

She was now commanded by Commander John Newland Maffitt, CSN—the &quot;Prince of Privateers&quot;—detached from CSS &quot;Albemarle&quot; at Plymouth, North Carolina on or about September 9. Confederate Navy Secretary Stephen Mallory, telegraphing on September 19, warned Maffitt: &quot;It is of the first importance that our steamers should not fall into the enemy&#x27;s hands… these vessels, lightly armed, now constitute the fleetest and most efficient part of his blockading force off Wilmington.&quot; Maffitt was to take no passengers, as a rule, and Assistant Paymaster Adam Tredwell, CSN, would deliver &quot;5,000 pounds in sterling bills before sailing,&quot; Mallory concluded.

&quot;Owl&quot; was at Bermuda with cotton October 24–29, as the U.S. Consul faithfully reported. On December 5, Mallory instructed Maffitt to pick up CSS &quot;Florida&quot;&#x27;s men in Bermuda. A letter to Mallory captured, along with Assistant Paymaster Talley, CSN, by USS &quot;Forest Rose&quot; on May 7, 1865 bears an endorsement by her commander, Lieutenant A. N. Gould, USN: &quot;It shows that Maffitt has been landing on the Florida coast with the &quot;Owl&quot;.&quot; U.S. Consul William Thomas Minor at Havana, Cuba reported on May 20 that Maffitt was to leave there in a day or two for Galveston, Texas. On this last trip &quot;Owl&quot; was almost captured at Wilmington by a Federal cruiser and had to jettison valuable mail as well as sustain 12 casualties. Maffitt then tried Galveston, and grounded on Bird Island Shoals at the entrance within range of 16 enemy cruisers. Captain James H. MacGarvey, CSN, in little CSS &quot;Diana&quot; got &quot;Owl&quot; off barely in time; she not only ran into port but ran out safely too. There is some evidence &quot;Owl&quot;&#x27;s last two runs through the blockade were made under the name of &quot;Foam&quot;.

&quot;Owl&quot; was delivered to Fraser, Trenholm &amp; Co. in Liverpool after war&#x27;s end, and Maffitt took the Board of Trade examinations to command British merchant ships to South America.

<text>Dolour is a band led by Shane Tutmarc.

==History==
Dolour was formed in Seattle, Washington, releasing their debut 7&quot; in mid-1998 on Theory Records, and two self-released EPs before releasing their first album &quot;Waiting For A World War&quot; in April 2001 on Sonic Boom Records. By the release of Waiting for a World War, Dolour had become a solo project for Tutmarc. Tutmarc recorded Suburbiac, released on Fugitive Records in 2002, with producer Aaron Sprinkle. The self-produced &quot;New Old Friends (2004)&quot; was released on Made In Mexico Records in November 2004. In 2005, &quot;A Matter of Time: 2000-2005,&quot; an anthology, was released by Japanese label Quince Records. During 2004-2006 Dolour produced two separate albums, &quot;Hell or Highwater&quot; and &quot;Storm &amp; Stress&quot;, which were combined and released on Japanese label Quince Records as &quot;The Years in the Wilderness&quot; in 2007. On December 6, 2007, Tutmarc announced the end of Dolour as he focused his efforts on the band Shane Tutmarc &amp; the Traveling Mercies.

After Tutmarc pursued a solo career, Dolour became active again in 2020, releasing the album &quot;The Royal We&quot;, and in April 2021, the album &quot;Televangelist&quot;. In 2021, Dolour also released &quot;Origin Story&quot;, comprising re-recorded songs from previous releases.

<doc id="1202598" wikidata="Q607785" url="?curid=1202598" title="Western Apache people">
<text>The Western Apache are a subgroup of the Apache Native American people, who live primarily in east central Arizona, in the United States and north of Mexico in the states of Sonora and Chihuahua. Most live within reservations. The Fort Apache Indian Reservation, San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation, Yavapai-Apache Nation, Tonto Apache, and the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation are home to the majority of Western Apache and are the bases of their federally recognized tribes. In addition, there are numerous bands. The Western Apache bands call themselves Ndee (Indé) (“The People”). Because of dialectical differences, the Pinaleño/Pinal and Arivaipa/Aravaipa bands of the San Carlos Apache pronounce the word as Innee or Nnēē:.

==Language and culture==
The various dialects of Western Apache (which they refer to as &quot;Ndéé biyáti’ / Nnéé biyáti’&quot;) are a form of Apachean, a branch of the Southern Athabaskan language family. The Navajo speak a related Apachean language, but the peoples separated several hundred years ago and are considered culturally distinct. Other indigenous peoples who speak Athabaskan languages are located in Alaska and Canada.&quot;

The anthropologist Grenville Goodwin classified the Western Apache into five groups based on Apachean dialect and culture:
* Cibecue,
* Northern Tonto,
* Southern Tonto,
* San Carlos, and
* White Mountain.

Since Goodwin, other researchers have disputed his conclusion of five linguistic groups. They do agree that there are three main Apachean dialects, with several sub-groupings:
* San Carlos,
* White Mountain, and
* Dilzhę́’é (Tonto).

Some 20,000 Western Apache still speak their native language, and the tribes are working to preserve it. Bilingual teachers are often employed in the lower elementary grades to promote that goal, but many children tend to learn to speak only the widely spoken English, mingled with occasional Spanish, depending on their home languages.

In relation to culture, tribal schools offer classes in native handicrafts, such as basket weaving; making bows, arrows, spears, shields; and cradles for infants. Girls and young women at the elementary and secondary level are taught how to make native regalia from buckskin, in addition to making silver jewelry. In addition, young men often become jewelry makers and are taught skills in this area.

==Western Apache bands and tribes==

===White Mountain Apache===
The White Mountain Apache or &quot;Dził Łigai Si’án Ndéé&quot; &quot;People of the White Mountains&quot; (), are centered in Fort Apache Indian Reservation. It is the most eastern band of the Western Apache group. The White Mountain Apache are a federally recognized tribe. Their traditional area ranged from the White Mountains near present-day Snowflake, Arizona, the Little Colorado River in the north over the Gila Mountains south to the Pinaleno Mountains near Safford (Ichʼįʼ Nahiłtį́į́)) and parts of Chihuahua and Sonora, Mexico. They lived near waterways, which they used for their crops, such as along the East Fork and North Fork of the White River, Willow Creek, Black River and the Gila River. 
* Western White Mountain band (&quot;Łį́nabaahé&quot;, &quot;Łį́nabaahá&quot; – “Many Go to War People”, literally, “they scout with horses,” often called &quot;Coyoteros&quot; or &quot;Coyotero Apaches&quot;)

===Tonto Apache===
(autonym: &quot;Dilzhę́`é&quot; lived from the San Francisco Peaks, East Verde River and Oak Creek Canyon along the Verde River into the Mazatzal Mountains and to the Salt River in the SW and the Tonto Basin in the SE, extending eastward toward the Little Colorado River. They were the most westerly group of the Western Apache.

The Chiricahua called them &quot;Ben-et-dine&quot; – ‘wild’, ‘crazy’; neighboring Western Apache called them &quot;Koun`nde&quot; – ‘Those who you don’t understand’, ‘wild rough People’. The Spanish adapted the latter term, referring to the people as &quot;Tonto&quot; –meaning &#x27;loose&#x27;, &#x27;foolish&#x27; in Spanish. The &quot;Dine&quot; called the Tonto Apache and neighboring Yavapai &quot;Dilzhʼíʼ dinéʼiʼ&quot; – ‘People with high-pitched voices’, distinguishing them by language.
* &quot;Northern Tonto&quot; or &quot;Tonto&quot;, inhabited the upper reaches of the Verde River and ranged north toward the San Francisco Mountains north of Flagstaff. Because they shared hunting and gathering grounds with Wi:pukba/Wipukepaya bands of the Yavapai, they formed bilingual mixed-tribal bands with common headmen. Both the band/local group or its headman usually were given two names: one was Apache (Southern Athabascan) and the other Yavapai (Upland Yuman).
** Bald Mountain band (a bilingual, mixed Apache-Yavapai band known in Apache as: &quot;Dahszíné Dahsdáyé Iṉéé&quot; – ‘Porcupine Sitting Above People’, and in Yavapai: &quot;Wiipukepaya&quot;, meaning ′Oak Creek Canyon People′. In English they were often known as the &quot;Bald Mountain band&quot; (with focus on the Apache) or as &quot;Oak Creek Canyon band&quot; (with focus on the Yavapai). They lived mainly around Bald Mountain or Squaw Peak, on the west side of the Verde Valley, southwest of Camp Verde. They lived entirely by hunting and gathering plant foods.
** Oak Creek band (a bilingual mixed Apache-Yavapai band with two names: in Apache: &quot;Tséé Hichíí Nṉéé&quot; – ‘Horizontal Red Rock People’ and in Yavapai: &quot;Wiipukepaya&quot; local group – ′Oak Creek Canyon People′; in English often known as &quot;Oak Creek band&quot; (Apache) or as &quot;Oak Creek Canyon band&quot; (Yavapai). Lived near today&#x27;s Sedona, along Oak Creek, Dry Beaver Creek, Wet Beaver Creek and southward to the west side of the Verde River between Altnan and West Clear Creek, eastward to Stoneman&#x27;s and Mary&#x27;s Lakes, and northward to Roger&#x27;s Lake and Flagstaff.
** Fossil Creek band (a bilingual mixed Apache-Yavapai band with two names: in Apache: &quot;Tú Dotłʼizh Nṉéé&quot; – ‘Blue Water People,i.e. Fossil Creek People’ and in Yavapai: &quot;Matkitwawipa band&quot; – ′People of the Upper Verde River Valley (in Yavapai: Matkʼamvaha)′). Lived along and had a few tiny farms on Fossil Creek, Clear Creek and a site on the Verde River below the mouth of Deer Creek, they hunted and gathered west of the Verde River, northwest to the Oak Creek band territory and northeast to Apache Maid Mountain.
** Mormon Lake band (in Apache: &quot;Dotłʼizhi HaʼitʼInṉéé&quot; – ‘Turquoise Road Coming Up People’) Lived east of Mormon Lake near the head of Anderson&#x27;s Canyon and ranged up to the southern foot of the San Francisco Mountains, at Elden Mountain near Flagstaff, around Mormon, Mary&#x27;s, Stoneman&#x27;s and Hay Lakes, and at Anderson and Padre Canyons. Because they were exposed to the hostile Navajo on the north and east, they depended entirely on hunting and gathering wild plant foods for sustenance. &quot;Only the Mormon Lake band was composed entirely of Tonto Apache&quot;.
* &quot;Southern Tonto&quot; or &quot;Dilzhę́’é&quot; (lived in the Tonto Basin from the Salt River in south northward along and over the East Verde River, including the Sierra Ancha (&quot;Dził Nteel&quot; – &quot;Wide Flat Mountain&quot;), Bradshaw Mountains and Mazatzal Mountains – like the Northern Tonto Apache with the &quot;Wi:pukba/Wipukepaya&quot; – they formed with the &quot;Guwevkabaya/Kwevkepaya&quot; bands of Yavapai bilingual mixed-tribal bands with common headmen.)
** Mazatzal band (a bilingual mixed Apache-Yavapai band with two names and broken up in two local groups of the &quot;Tséé Nołtłʼizhń Band&quot; (‘Rocks in a Line of Greenness People’) of Southern Tonto Apache and the &quot;Wiikchasapaya/Wikedjasapa Band&quot; (′People of the McDowell Mountains (in Yavapai: Wi:kajasa)′) of Guwevkabaya/Kwevkepaya Yavapai). Lived mainly in the eastern slopes of Mazatzal Mountains and eastwards on both sides of Tonto Creek down where Theodore Roosevelt Lake now is.
*** Tséé Nołtłʼizhń (Apache name) or Hakayopa clan (Cottonwood People, Yavapai name); in English simply known as &quot;Mazatzal band&quot; (Apache). Claimed the area around the community Sunflower Valley, the Mazatzal Mountains south of its highest peak, Mazatzal Peak (2.409 m), and to the east in the area around the former Fort Camp Reno in the western Tonto Basin (also called Pleasant Valley).
*** Tsé Nołtłʼizhń (Apache name) or Hichapulvapa clan (‘bunch-of-wood-sticking-up People‘, Yavapai name); in English simply known as &quot;Mazatzal band&quot; (Apache). They claimed the Mazatzal Mountains southward from East Verde River and westward from North Peak to Mazatzal Peak.
** Dilzhę́ʼé semi-band (a bilingual mixed Apache-Yavapai group with two names: in Apache: &quot;Dilzhę́’é or Dilzę́`é&quot; – ‘People with high-pitched voices’ and in Yavapai: &quot;Matkawatapa&quot; clan (‚red-strata-country People, i.e. Sierra Ancha People‘). The &quot;Dilzhę́ʼé semi-band&quot; are the first and most important semi-band under which name the five remaining semi-bands were known, those Dilzhę́ʼé of Sierra Ancha formed with members of the Walkamepa band a bilingual unit).
*** second semi-band (lived along Tonto Creek and Rye Creek in the Gisela area, south of the third/Payson semi-band and northeast of the Mazatzal band).
*** third semi-band (perhaps one of the principal Dilzhę́ʼé Apache clans – the &quot;People of the Yellow Speckled Water&quot;, their territory encompassed the Tonto Apache Reservation, they were living in the Round Valley–Payson area known in Apache as Tégótsog (&quot;Place of the Yellow Water&quot; or &quot;Place of the Yellow Land&quot;).
*** fourth semi-band (lived near the confluence of the East Verde with the Verde River, most south of the East Verde between the territories of the Guwevkabaya-Yavapai southwest and Mazatzal band south, the second/Gisela semi-band to the east, and the third/Payson semi-band to the northeast, and the fifth/Pine semi-band north).
*** fifth semi-band (lived along the East Verde River north and along Pine Creek in Strawberry and Pine valleys, a tributary of Tonto Creek, in the Pine area).
*** sixth semi-band.

===Other bands and groups===
Often groups of &quot;Wi:pukba (Wipukepa)&quot; and &quot;Guwevkabaya (Kwevkepaya)&quot; of the Yavapai lived together with the Tonto Apache (as well as bands of the San Carlos Apache) in bilingual &quot;rancherias&quot;, and could not be distinguished by outsiders (Spaniards, Americans, or Mexicans) except on the basis of their first language. The Yavapai and Apache together were often referred to as &quot;Tonto&quot; or &quot;Tonto Apaches&quot;. Therefore, it is not always easy to find out whether it is now exclusively dealing with Yavapai or Apache, or those mixed bands. The &quot;Wi:pukba (Wipukepa)&quot; and &quot;Guwevkabaya (Kwevkepaya)&quot; were therefore, because of their ancestral and cultural proximity to the Tonto and San Carlos Apaches, often incorrectly called &quot;Yavapai Apaches&quot; or &quot;Yuma Apaches&quot;. The &quot;Ɖo:lkabaya (Tolkepaya)&quot;, the southwestern group of Yavapai, and the Hualapai (also belonging to the Upland Yuma Peoples) were also referred as &quot;Yuma Apaches&quot; or &quot;Mohave Apaches&quot;.

==Notable Western Apache==

===White Mountain Apaches===
* Alchesay (aka William Alchesay and Áłchʼísé – &quot;The Little One&quot;, May 17, 1853 – Aug.6, 1928) was a chief of the White Mountain Apache and an Apache Scout. He received United States militaries highest decoration for bravery, the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Apache Wars and the Yavapai Wars. He tried to convince Geronimo to surrender peacefully. Became later a prominent stockman, made several trips to Washington, D.C., and was active in Indian affairs.
* Bylas (aka &quot;Bailish&quot; or &quot;Baylas&quot; – &quot;One Who Does All the Talking&quot;) chief of the Eastern White Mountain band, for whom the present settlement of Bylas on the San Carlos Reservation is named, this Apache settlement is divided into two communities, one of the White Mountain, the other of San Carlos and Southern Tonto Apache.
* Francisco *Indian name (Gochaahá = Big One) killed 11/10 – 1865, chief of the Eastern White Mountain Coyotero Apache band, maybe he had been in his childhood a Mexican captive and thus inherited his Spanish name or he is to be identified with &quot;Na-ginit-a&quot; (&quot;He Scouts Ahead&quot;), an Eastern White Mountain chief closely engaged with Chiricahua chief Cochise – both Francisco and Na-ginit-a being killed by venom in 1865 at Camp Goodwin – arrested because of his involvement in the Cienega massacre and &quot;executed&quot; in unclear circumstances.
* Esh-kel-dah-sila (&quot;Eskiltesela&quot;, &quot;Esketeshelaw&quot;, &quot;Hashkéédásiláá&quot; – “He Is Constantly Angry”, &quot;Heske-hldasila&quot; – “Angry, Right Side Up”, also known as &quot;Clear-Eyed Eskeltesela&quot;, fl. c. 1850–1875) chief of the &quot;Nádots’osn&quot; clan (Nádohots’osn, Náhodits’osn, or Nádots’osin – “slender peak standing up people”) as of the entire Eastern White Mountain Apache band, most respected and prominent Eastern White Mountain Apache chief in history, he maintained alliances with Hopi and Zuni, offered land for the establishment of Camp Apache (later Fort Apache), Pedro and his Carrizo band of Cibecue Apaches got permission from him to settle near later Fort Apache on White Mountain Apache territory, he and his band were generally ill-disposed toward Cibecue Apache bands of Miguel, Diablo and Pedro, who had enlisted as Apache Scouts in 1871 and were scouting against “troublemakers” of Esh-kel-dah-sila&#x27;s band.
* Polone, succeeded in 1873 Esh-kel-dah-sila as chief of the Eastern White Mountain Apache band.

===Cibecue Apache===
* Miguel&quot; (also known as &quot;One-Eyed-Miguel&quot; or &quot;El Tuerto&quot;, &quot;Esh-ke-iba&quot;, &quot;Es-chá´-pa&quot;, &quot;Es-ca-pa&quot; or &quot;Hashkééba – &quot;Aware of His Anger&quot;, sometimes called &quot;Pin-dah-kiss&quot;, ca. ? – †1871) chief of the dominant local group and clan of the Carrizo band, during the 1850s and 1860s most prominent Carrizo chief, in 1869 Miguel and his younger brother Diablo initiated relations between Americans and the Cibecue and White Mountain Apaches, which led to the establishment of Fort Apache (first as Camp Apache in 1870). He supplied recruits for the first unit of Apache Scouts in 1871, because the Cibecue Apaches were forced to settle near Camp Apache on White Mountain Apache territory in spring 1874, he was killed shortly after during a feud with White Mountain Apaches, after that, Diablo took over leadership from his deceased older brother and avenged his death.
* Diablo (&quot;El Diablo&quot; – &quot;the Devil&quot; or &quot;Capitan Grande&quot;, &quot;Hashkéédásiláá (hash-kay-dah-si-laa)&quot; – “His Anger is Lying Side By Side”, c. 1846 – †30. Aug.1880) after the death of his older brother Chief Miguel in 1874 during a feud with the White Mountain Apaches, he became the most prominent chief of the Carrizo band, in the fall of 1874 he enlisted as Scout and was promoted to sergeant, in January 1876 he and his band together with other Cibecue Apache bands were forced to move onto the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation, only Pedro&#x27;s band was allowed to stay at Fort Apache – which led to ill feelings towards the latter, therefore Diablo&#x27;s band attacked on August 30, 1880, Pedro&#x27;s band near Fort Apache, which resulted in the killing of Diablo himself, not to be confused with &quot;Hashkéédásiláá&quot;, the most prominent Eastern White Mountain Apache chief at this time.
* Pedro (&quot;Hashkéé-yánáłtiʼi-dn&quot;, &quot;Hash-kay-ya-nal-ti-din&quot; – “Angry, He Ask for It”, also known as &quot;Pedro, the Imitator&quot;, ca. 1835 – †1885) chief of the &quot;Tséé hachíídn&quot; clan (“Red Rock Strata People”) and local group of the Carrizo band, during a clan dispute in the early 1850s he was driven off the Carrizo Creek by Miguel, was allowed by the great Eastern White Mountain Apache chief &quot;Hashkéédásiláá&quot; after two years to settle near Fort Apache, Pedro&#x27;s band intermarried with the White Mountain Apaches and were therefore classed as White Mountain Apaches, however they retained close clan ties with the Carrizo band of the Cibecue Apaches, he and his &quot;segundo&quot; (or war chief) Yclenny together with White Mountain Apache chiefs Alchesay and Petone killed August 30, 1880 Diablo, (oft mistaken for &quot;Hashkéédásiláá&quot;, the most prominent Eastern White Mountain Apache chief at this time) in selfdefense, in revenge for the death of Diablo he was shot through both knees but survived, only Petone was mortally wounded, was a constant friend of the Americans.
* Petone succeeded his father Pedro about 1873 as chief of the Carrizo band of Cibecue Apaches – now generally classed as White Mountain Apaches. He was involved in the murder of the influential Carrizo band chief Diablo on August 30, 1880, half a year later in February 1881 members of Diablo&#x27;s band would avenge his death. In this battle, Pedro was shot through both knees and Alchesay through the chest, both of them survived, but Petone was mortally wounded.
* Capitán Chiquito (also known as &quot;Captain Chiquito&quot;, Chief of the Cibecue band, not to be confused with the Pinaleño Apache Chief of the same name)
* Nock-ay-dot-klin-ne (&quot;Nakąįdotł’ini&quot; – “spotted or freckled Mexican”, called by the Whites &quot;Babbyduclone&quot;, &quot;Barbudeclenny&quot;, &quot;Bobby-dok-linny&quot; and &quot;Freckled Mexican Matthews&quot;) chief of the Cañon Creek band and a respected medicine man among his people, held dances and claimed to bring two dead chiefs, the Carrizo band chief &quot;Diablo&quot; and the Cibecue band chief &quot;Es-ki-ol-e&quot; to life, fearing an Apache uprising the Army tried to arrest the medicine man which led to the Battle of Cibecue Creek on Aug.30, 1881, after the fighting erupted the Apache scouts mutinied as suspected. The attacking Apaches fought mainly at rifle range, however, when the scouts turned against the soldiers, a brief close range engagement occurred. As the battle ended with a strategic Apache victory, despite their inability to rescue their leader, due to the soldiers retreat. After the battle, the American army buried six soldiers, Nakąįdotł’ini, his wife, and young son, who was killed while riding into battle on his father&#x27;s pony. The Cibecue affair touched off a regional Apache uprising, in which the leading men of the Chiricahua bands, such as Naiche (c. 1857–1919), Juh (c. 1825 – Nov. 1883), and Geronimo (June 16, 1829 – Feb.17, 1909), left the reservation and went to war in Arizona, New Mexico, and northern Mexico. The warfare lasted about two years, ultimately ending in the US defeat of the Apache.
* Ne-big-ja-gy (also called &quot;Ka-clenny&quot; and &quot;Es-keg-i-slaw&quot;) was brother of &quot;Nakąįdotł’ini&quot;, the medicine men and chief of the Cañon Creek band. He succeeded his brother as chief of the Cañon Creek band.
* Sánchez (&quot;Béshbiwoo’dn&quot; or &quot;Bé-cbiɣo&#x27;dn&quot; – “Metal Tooth” or “Iron Tooth”) was successor of Diablo as Chief of the Carrizo Creek band. This band of about 250 people lived on Carrizo Creek, twelve miles north of Carrizo Crossing, was closely associated with Nakąįdotł’ini.

===San Carlos Apaches===
* Casador (&quot;Casadora&quot;, &quot;Nantʼánchoh&quot; – &quot;Great Chief&quot;) was recognized as the main chief of the San Carlos band, before he left the reservation.
* Eskinospas (&quot;Eskénásbas&quot;, &quot;Hashkéénásbas&quot;– “Angry Circular”, called by the Whites &quot;Nosy&quot;) chief of a local group of the Arivaipa band.
* Santo, an Arivaipa Apache Chief and di-yin, father-in-law of Eskiminzin.
* Eskiminzin (aka &quot;Hashkéébánsiziin&quot;, &quot;Hashkíbáínzín&quot; – &quot;Angry, Men Stand in Line for Him&quot;, born approximately 1828 near the Pinal Mountains as a Pinaleño) through marriage into the Arivaipa, became one of them and later their chief. He and his band together with the Pinaleño band under &quot;Capitán Chiquito&quot; were attacked by on April 30, 1871, in the Camp Grant Massacre. Led by William S. Oury and Jesús María Elías, who blamed every depredation in southern Arizona on the 500 Camp Grant Apaches, contacted an old ally Francisco Galerita, leader of the Tohono O&#x27;odham at San Xavier to punish the Arivaipa. In a surprise attack, 98 Apaches were killed and mutilated by Tohono O&#x27;odham (all but eight were women and children) and 27 children were sold into slavery in Mexico by the Tohono O&#x27;odham and the Mexicans.
* Capitán Chiquito was chief of the Pinaleño band, became together with the Arivaipa Chief &quot;Eskiminzin&quot; victim of the Camp Grant Massacre by Mexicans and their Tohono O&#x27;odham-allies, after the massacre the surviving Arivaipa and Pinaleño bands fled north to their Tonto Apache and Yavapai allies, together they raiding and fought the Americans until into 1875 with its culmination in General George Crook&#x27;s Tonto Basin Campaign of 1872 and 1873.
* Talkalai (&quot;T&#x27;alkááli&quot;, *1817 – †March 4, 1930, Miami) was chief of the Apache Peaks band, and served as Chief of Scouts for three different United States Army Generals, Crook, Miles, and Howard. In April 1887 he was the leader of the scouts that marched 400 miles into Mexico and captured Geronimo. He once saved the life of his good friend John Clum, first Indian Agent at San Carlos Indian reservation, by shooting his own brother. This act so inflamed some of his band members that he was forced to flee the reservation and move into the town of Miami, Arizona. He was also a friend of the Earps in Tombstone and had been a guest of President Cleveland in the White House.
* Michael Minjarez, actor &amp; Apache dialect supervisor.

<text>Jack Hill State Park, formerly named Gordonia-Alatamaha State Park, is a Georgia state park located in Reidsville, a city on Georgia&#x27;s coastal plain region. The park is known for having a dramatic history, having been previously under water for nearly 20 million years. Until about 1 million years ago, the area was very similar to the dense jungles and plains of Africa. The park was named for the nearby Altamaha River and the park&#x27;s nearly extinct &quot;Gordonia&quot; Tree. The park contains a lake stocked with fish, as well as a 9-hole golf course, named Brazell&#x27;s Creek, which has recently been upgraded to 18 holes.

In 2020, the park was renamed from Gordonia-Alatamaha to Jack Hill, honoring the late Georgia senator who did much for the community. Hill was instrumental in bringing many facilities to the park, including its group shelter, cabins, splash pad, expanded golf course and more.

==Facilities==

<doc id="1202603" wikidata="Q2927538" url="?curid=1202603" title="Budge Pountney">
<text>Anthony Charles &#x27;Budge&#x27; Pountney (born 13 November 1973) is a rugby union coach and retired player. A flanker, he played in the Northampton Saints side that won the 1999–2000 Heineken Cup.

Pountney was born in Southampton in England, but had a grandmother from the Channel Islands which made him eligible for any of the British national teams. He won 31 caps for Scotland from 1998 to 2002. He was part of the Scotland team that won the 1999 Five Nations Championship, played in the 1999 World Cup, and later captained the team.

After retiring, he was head coach and later director of rugby at Northampton. He later worked in club and school coaching. He is now the development director for Ulster Rugby.

==Early life==
Pountney was born in Southampton, the son of a farm manager. He attended Weeke Primary School, Kings&#x27; School and Peter Symonds College in Winchester. He studied at Bedford College and gained a BA Honours in European Studies and Sports Studies. He was eligible to play rugby for Scotland by virtue of a grandmother born in the Channel Islands; as a dependency of the Crown outside of the United Kingdom, people from the Islands are eligible to represent whichever of the Home Nations they choose.

==Playing career==
He began playing rugby for the Winchester RFC mini rugby sides.

===Northampton club rugby===
At age 18 he joined Northampton Rugby Union Football Club who were playing in what was then the First Division. His senior debut came in 1994, against Coventry R.F.C. He had played for the England Students and U21s but had never really felt like he fitted in.

He started in the Northampton side that won the 2000 Heineken Cup Final, defeating Munster at Twickenham. He was club captain from 2001 to 2004. He had broken his nose twice that season, but with the Northampton squad stretched, he had continued to offer himself for selection. In September 2003 he sustained a broken ankle while playing a pre-season friendly match for Northampton. He did not recover sufficiently from that injury and in February 2004 he announced his retirement from playing rugby. He made 215 appearances for Northampton and scored 46 tries, playing in 104 English Premiership matches.

===International career===
Pountney represented England Students and Under-21s but was told that he was too short to play for England&#x27;s senior team. He qualified for Scotland through a grandmother from the Channel Islands.

He received his first cap for Scotland in November 1998, in an autumn international test match against South Africa. He had played a part in all the team&#x27;s matches when Scotland won the 1999 Five Nations Championship, where he was a replacement in the first three matches before Jim Telfer selected him in the starting line-up for the match against France in Paris. He was part of the Scotland squad for the 1999 Rugby World Cup, playing in four matches. He scored a try against New Zealand in the quarter-finals, although the All Blacks won the match and brought Scotland&#x27;s tournament came to an end. In January 2002, returning from injury, he captained Scotland against England
in their opening match of the 2002 Six Nations Championship. He made a total of 31 capped appearances for Scotland, scoring five tries. In January 2003 he left Murrayfield in frustration for the last time, after speaking his mind very plainly on the problems he saw there.

==Coaching career==
Late in 2004 he became head coach of Northampton Saints, together with former England fly-half and teammate Paul Grayson. In July 2005 he became Director of Rugby.

After retiring from top class rugby, he has worked as an independent citing officer, reviewing English Rugby Premiership matches.
In the summer of 2013 he became Director of Rugby at Bournemouth RFC who were playing in National Division 2 South. The club announced that he was to leave at the end of the 2014 season, citing a change in personal circumstances.

He then worked as Head of Rugby at Marlborough College and moved to Regent House School in Newtownards in 2017. In 2021 he became development director for Ulster Rugby.

<doc id="1202604" wikidata="Q15052586" url="?curid=1202604" title="Ian Dickson (TV personality)">
<text>Ian Ross Perrygrove (born 28 March 1963) better known as Ian &quot;Dicko&quot; Dickson or simply &quot;Dicko&quot; is an English Australian television and radio presenter, television producer, music journalist and former record company executive and talent scout. He has been a talent judge on &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, &quot;The Next Great American Band&quot;, the 2012 reboot of &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; and &quot;Australia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. He previously spent over twenty years working in the record industry in both the U.K. and Australia, for labels including Creation Records, Sony, A&amp;M and BMG and for music acts including Celine Dion, Ozzy Osbourne, Primal Scream and Pearl Jam.

==Early life and education==
Dickson is the grandson of former professional footballer Ian Dickson from Dumfries. As well as playing for hometown club Queen of the South, Dickson the footballer also played for Middlesbrough and for Aston Villa; while playing for the last he set roots in Birmingham, his grandson&#x27;s home town.

Dickson graduated from the University of Nottingham with a degree in politics in 1985. He met his wife, Melanie Bell, in Bristol around the same time. His first job in the music industry was as Press and Promotions Manager for Creation Records, and he managed bands including The Jesus and Mary Chain, Primal Scream, Felt, Weather Prophets, My Bloody Valentine and Oasis. He also wrote freelance reviews and features as a music journalist for Melody Maker and Record Mirror. 

==Career==
===1989–2004: Recording industry===
In 1989, Dickson joined Sony Music UK (then CBS Records) as a press officer, managing Public Enemy, LL Cool J, Midnight Oil, Warrant and Michael Bolton. In 1990, he moved to the Epic Records label as a marketing executive working with Pearl Jam, Ozzy Osbourne, Living Colour, Screaming Trees and Celine Dion. He became Director of International for Sony UK in 1993, overseeing global strategies for all Epic and S2 label artists, including Jamiroquai, Des&#x27;ree, Reef, Manic Street Preachers and Basia. He moved to A&amp;M Records UK in 1994 as Director of International, looking after acts such as Chris De Burgh, Therapy, Del Amitri, The Bluetones and the Mowax label, including DJ Shadow, Money Mark and U.N.C.L.E.

In 2001, he moved to Sydney to take up the position of General Manager of Marketing for Sony BMG Australia, and remained in the role until August 2004.

===2003–2004: &quot;Australian Idol&quot;===
In 2003, Dickson took up his best-known role—as the &quot;nasty&quot; judge on &quot;Australian Idol&quot; in the first and second seasons—alongside fellow judges Marcia Hines and Mark Holden. The first series premiered on 27 July 2003 on Network Ten. Viewers initially disliked him for his insensitive, cold attitude (including controversial comments on a female contestant&#x27;s weight), but towards the end of his tenure he became popular for his candid assessments of performances based on his expertise and experience within the record industry. He was also Australia&#x27;s judge at the first (and so far only) &quot;World Idol&quot; in December 2003.

===2005–2006: Seven Network===
Near the end of the 2004 series of &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, it was announced that Dickson would be leaving the show and Network Ten to move to the Seven Network to broaden his interests as a presenter and producer. The move caused controversy at the time, as the popularity of &quot;Idol&quot; and Dickson himself were at their peak. His first role at the Seven Network in 2005 was as host of the second season of reality TV series &quot;My Restaurant Rules&quot;, succeeding Curtis Stone. Also that year he was a contestant in &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, placing third.

During this time, Dickson and his business partner and manager, David Wilson, formed Watercooler Media, an independent television production company.

In December 2005, Dickson began his first stint on radio, hosting the morning show on Sydney and Melbourne radio stations Vega 95.3 and Vega 91.5, both part of the Vega radio network.

In 2006, Dickson was the host of &quot;Australian Celebrity Survivor&quot; on the Seven Network.

===2007–2009: Return to &quot;Australian Idol&quot; and Network Ten===
On 30 November 2006, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that Dickson would return to Network Ten in 2007 to become a fourth judge on the fifth season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, rejoining Mark Holden, Marcia Hines and his successor Kyle Sandilands. Season five premiered on 5 August 2007.

Also in 2007 Dickson accepted an offer to be a judge on &quot;The Next Great American Band&quot; on Fox in the U.S. He was scouted by &quot;American Idol&quot; executive producers Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick based on his performance at &quot;World Idol&quot; four years earlier. His fellow judges were Sheila E. and John Rzeznik, and the series premiered on 19 October 2007. &quot;Australian Idol&quot; and &quot;The Next Great American Band&quot; were filmed simultaneously, which meant Dickson traveled back and forth between the U.S. and Australia for his filming duties.

In 2008 and 2009, he was again a judge on &quot;Australian Idol&quot; for seasons six and seven, the final seasons of the series.

In January 2008, it was announced that Dickson would be hosting the breakfast radio show on Vega 91.5 alongside comedian Dave O&#x27;Neil and former &quot;Big Brother&quot; runner-up Chrissie Swan, replacing Denise Scott and Shaun Micallef. The breakfast show was titled &quot;Dicko, Dave &amp; Chrissie&quot;. Chrissie left the show in 2009 and Dickson and O&#x27;Neil continued the show for one more year until its end in 2010.

===2010–2011: &quot;Can of Worms&quot;===
On 4 July 2011 &quot;Can of Worms&quot; premiered on Network Ten with Dickson and Meshel Laurie as hosts. He and his business partner and manager, David Wilson, developed the show, in which celebrities were required to answer yes or no before a live studio audience to tricky moral questions such as, &quot;Is it wrong to tell your kids there is no God?&quot; and &quot;If a woman has had a boob job, is it an open invitation to have a good look?&quot;. He and Wilson had pitched the show several times to various TV networks from 2005 to 2009, finally selling the concept to Network Ten with a pitch meeting where Dickson acted as host and the executives the contestants. At the end of the first series he elected not to return as a host of subsequent series but remained as an executive producer. &quot;Can of Worms&quot; lasted two more seasons with Chrissie Swan and Dan Illic as hosts and ended in 2014.

===2012–2014: &quot;Young Talent Time&quot;, &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice Australia&quot; and return to radio===
After leaving his hosting duties on &quot;Can of Worms&quot; at the end of 2011, Dickson became a judge on the 2012 reboot of &quot;Young Talent Time&quot;, initially as a guest judge while Tina Arena was away ill before becoming a full time judge during the finals. He joined the cast of the second season of &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice Australia&quot;, which premiered on the Nine Network on 18 April 2012. He was announced the winner of the series in the final episode, and split his earnings with runner-up Nathan Joliffee. He won A$204,253 for his nominated charity, The Australian Children&#x27;s Music Foundation. His soft side seen during the series and the final was in contrast to his persona as the hard-as-nails judge on &quot;Australian Idol&quot;.

After his win Dickson returned to Europe to spend some time with his family. Upon his return to Australia, he announced he would be returning to radio in 2013 as the breakfast host on Sydney talkback AM radio station 2UE alongside 2UE police reporter Sarah Morice. In 2014 Dickson and Morice moved to the 12pm-3pm shift hosting their show &quot;Afternoons with Dicko &amp; Sarah&quot;. The show came to an end at the end of 2014.

===2015–onwards: Return to the judges&#x27; chair and &quot;First Contact&quot;===
In July 2015, Dickson played Widow Twanky in Bonnie Lythgoe&#x27;s stage production of &quot;Aladdin and his Wondrous Lamp&quot; at the State Theatre in Sydney, Australia. Jessica Rowe and Beau Ryan also appeared in the production.

On 28 October 2015, it was announced that Dickson would be one of the four new judges on the Nine Network&#x27;s new &quot;Australia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. The series premiered on 1 February 2016 with Dickson as a judge alongside Kelly Osbourne, Sophie Monk and Eddie Perfect.

Starting on 29 November 2016, Dickson appeared in the second season of the TV series &quot;First Contact&quot; on SBS, one of six well known Australians spending twenty-eight days living in various Indigenous communities across Australia.

From 2 April 2023, Dickson appeared as a contestant in the ninth season of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. Dickson was eliminated 3rd on 19 April 2023.

==Personal life==
Dickson is married to Melanie Bell; they have two daughters and live on the Sunshine Coast. He became an Australian citizen on Australia Day, 26 January 2006, presented by then Prime Minister John Howard.

He is good friends with his &quot;Pop Idol&quot; and &quot;American Idol&quot; counterpart Simon Cowell, going back to their days working together in the British music industry. It was Cowell who convinced Dickson to take the role as the &quot;villain judge&quot;, despite his reservations given that he was relatively new to his adopted homeland and wanted to settle at a gradual pace. Cowell guaranteed immediate money and fame as incentives.

Dickson is a Foundation Member and ambassador of the Western Sydney Wanderers Football Club and was one of 14 Australian supporters who traveled to Saudi Arabia to watch the club win the AFC Champions League title in 2014.

On an episode of the ABC Australian news program &quot;Four Corners&quot; broadcast on 19 February 2007, Dickson discussed his problems with alcohol.
Dickson is an atheist: &quot;I have developed a spirituality which I suppose you could call metaphysics or science of mind – nothing to do with Scientology, I hasten to add. It&#x27;s something that was developed by a guy called Ernest Holmes, and it&#x27;s about the law of the universe, the law of attraction. It&#x27;s all that stuff that&#x27;s been popular on The Secret but there&#x27;s far more to it than that. I&#x27;m an atheist but I&#x27;ve got a spirituality I can fall back on. I don&#x27;t like religion because I see it as a bureaucracy of faith and I&#x27;ve never really been big on bureaucracy.&quot;

<text>Guy Mattison Davenport (November 23, 1927 – January 4, 2005) was an American writer, translator, illustrator, painter, intellectual, and teacher.

==Life==
Guy Davenport was born in Anderson, South Carolina, in the foothills of Appalachia on November 23, 1927. His father was an agent for the Railway Express Agency. Davenport said that he became a reader only at 10, with a neighbor’s gift of one of the Tarzan series. At age eleven, he began a neighborhood newspaper, drawing all the illustrations and writing all the stories. At 13, he &quot;broke [his] right leg (skating) and was laid up for a wearisome while&quot;; it was then that he began &quot;reading with real interest&quot;, beginning with a biography of Leonardo. He left high school early and enrolled at Duke University a few weeks after his seventeenth birthday. At Duke, he studied art (with Clare Leighton), graduating with a BA &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in classics and English literature. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa his junior year.

Davenport was a Rhodes Scholar at Merton College, Oxford, from 1948 to 1950. He studied Old English under J. R. R. Tolkien and graduated with a B.Litt., with a thesis on James Joyce. In 1950, upon his return to the United States, Davenport was drafted into the US Army for two years, spending them at Fort Bragg in the 756th Field Artillery, then in the XVIII Airborne Corps. After the army, he taught at Washington University in St. Louis until 1955, when he began earning a PhD at Harvard, studying under Harry Levin and Archibald MacLeish.

Davenport befriended Ezra Pound during the poet&#x27;s incarceration in St. Elizabeths Hospital, visiting him annually from 1952 until Pound&#x27;s release, in 1958, and later at Pound&#x27;s home in Rapallo, Italy. Davenport described one such visit, in 1963, in the story &quot;Ithaka&quot;. Davenport wrote his dissertation on Pound&#x27;s poetry, published as &quot;Cities on Hills&quot; in 1983. This interest led him to Hugh Kenner, who became one of his most important literary friends. They carried on a voluminous correspondence from 1958 till 2002, as recorded in the book &quot;Questioning Minds: The Letters of Guy Davenport and Hugh Kenner&quot;. He also corresponded a Pound scholar and friend, the literary critic M. Bernetta Quinn.

After completing his PhD, he taught at Haverford College from 1961 to 1963 but soon took a position at the University of Kentucky, &quot;the remotest offer with the most pay,&quot; as he wrote to Jonathan Williams. Davenport taught at Kentucky until he received a MacArthur Fellowship, which prompted his retirement, at the end of 1990.

Davenport was married briefly in the early 1960s. He dedicated &quot;Eclogues&quot;, 1981, to &quot;Bonnie Jean&quot; (Cox), his companion from 1965 to his death. Other Davenport volumes dedicated to Cox include &quot;Objects on a Table&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Death of Picasso&quot; (2004). Cox became Trustee for the Guy Davenport Estate.
In one of his essays, Davenport claimed to &quot;live almost exclusively off fried baloney, Campbell&#x27;s soup, and Snickers bars.&quot;

He died of lung cancer on January 4, 2005, in Lexington, Kentucky.

==Writing==
Davenport began publishing fiction in 1970 with &quot;The Aeroplanes at Brescia,&quot; which is based on Kafka&#x27;s visit to an air show in September 1909. His books include &quot;Tatlin!&quot;, &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Bicycle&quot;, &quot;Eclogues&quot;, &quot;Apples and Pears&quot;, &quot;The Jules Verne Steam Balloon&quot;, &quot;The Drummer of the Eleventh North Devonshire Fusiliers&quot;, &quot;A Table of Green Fields&quot;, &quot;The Cardiff Team&quot;, and &quot;Wo es war, soll ich werden&quot;. His fiction uses three general modes of exposition: the fictionalizing of historical events and figures; the foregrounding of formal narrative experiments, especially with the use of collage; and the depicting of a Fourierist utopia, where small groups of men, women, and children have eliminated the separation between mind and body.

The first of more than four hundred Davenport essays, articles, introductions, and book reviews appeared while he was still an undergraduate; the last, just weeks before his death. Davenport was a regular reviewer for &quot;National Review&quot; and &quot;The Hudson Review&quot;, and, late in his life, at the invitation of John Jeremiah Sullivan, he spent a year writing the &quot;New Books&quot; column for Harper&#x27;s Magazine. His essays range from literary to social topics, from brief book reviews to lectures such as the title piece in his first collection of essays, &quot;The Geography of the Imagination&quot;. His other collections of essays were &quot;Every Force Evolves a Form&quot; and &quot;The Hunter Gracchus and Other Papers on Literature and Art&quot;.

He also published two slim volumes on art: &quot;A Balthus Notebook&quot; and &quot;Objects on a Table&quot;. Although he wrote on many topics, Davenport, who never had a driver&#x27;s license, was especially passionate about the destruction of American cities by the automobile.

Davenport published a handful of poems. The longest are the book-length &quot;Flowers and Leaves&quot;, an intricate meditation on art and America, and &quot;The Resurrection in Cookham Churchyard&quot; (borrowing the title from a painting by Stanley Spencer). A selection of his poems and translations was published as &quot;Thasos and Ohio&quot;.

Davenport translated ancient Greek texts, particularly from the archaic period. These were published in periodicals, then small volumes, and finally collected in &quot;7 Greeks&quot;. He also translated the occasional other piece, including a few poems of Rilke&#x27;s, some ancient Egyptian texts [after Boris de Rachewiltz], and, with Benjamin Urrutia, the sayings of Jesus, published as &quot;The Logia of Yeshua&quot;.

==Visual art==
With his childhood newspaper, Davenport launched both his literary and artistic vocations. The former remained dormant or sporadic for some time while the latter, &quot;making drawings, watercolors, and gouaches, [continued] throughout school, the army, and his early years as a teacher.&quot; He drew or painted nearly every day of his life, and his notebooks contain drawings and pasted-in illustrations and photos cheek by jowl with his own observations and other writings and quotations from others.

From college forward, Davenport supplied cover art and decorations to literary periodicals. He also supplied illustrations for others&#x27; books, notably two by Hugh Kenner: &quot;The Stoic Comedians&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Counterfeiters&quot; (1968). 

As a visual artist (and childhood newspaper magnate) who also wrote, Davenport had a lifelong interest in printing and book design. His poems and fictions were often first published in limited editions by small press craftsmen.

In 1965 Davenport and Laurence Scott prepared and printed Pound&#x27;s Canto CX in an edition of 118 copies, 80 of which they presented to Pound for his 80th birthday. The previous year they had produced &quot;Ezra&#x27;s Bowmen of Shu&quot; on the same press, a double broadside that published for the first time, with a brief introductory essay by Davenport, a drawing by sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and a letter of Gaudier&#x27;s from the trenches of World War I that cites Pound&#x27;s poem (translated from one in the Shi Jing) &quot;The Song of the Bowmen of Shu&quot;.

Many of Davenport&#x27;s earlier stories are combinations of pictures and text, especially &quot;Tatlin!&quot; and &quot;Apples and Pears&quot; (where some of the illustrations are of pages that resemble those of his own notebooks).

&quot;It was my intention, when I began writing fiction several years ago, to construct texts that were both written and drawn... I continued this method right through &quot;Apples and Pears&quot;... The designer [of A+P] understood [my] collages to be gratuitous illustrations having nothing to do with anything, reduced them all to burnt toast, framed them with nonsensical lines, and sabotaged my whole enterprise. I took this as final defeat, and haven&#x27;t tried to combine drawing and writing in any later work of fiction.&quot;

==Awards==

Davenport received a MacArthur Fellowship in 1990.
Davenport received the PEN Award for Poetry in Translation in 1996.

<text>codice_1 is a Unix command that moves one or more files or directories from one place to another. If both filenames are on the same filesystem, this results in a simple file rename; otherwise the file content is copied to the new location and the old file is removed. Using codice_2 requires the user to have write permission for the &quot;directories&quot; the file will move between. This is because codice_2 changes the content of both directories (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the source and the target) involved in the move. When using the codice_2 command on files located on the same filesystem, the file&#x27;s timestamp is not updated.

On UNIX implementations derived from AT&amp;T UNIX, cp, ln and mv are implemented as a single program with hard-linked binaries. The behavior is selected from the path name codice_5. This is a common technique by which closely related commands that have been packaged as a unit allow the user to specify the particular course of the intended action.

==History==
A command that moves a directory entry to a new directory was first implemented within Multics. It can be contracted to . Later, the command appeared in Version 1 Unix and became part of the X/Open Portability Guide issue 2 of 1987.
The version of codice_2 bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Mike Parker, David MacKenzie, and Jim Meyering. The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities. The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.

==Conflicting existing file==
When a filename is moved to an existing filename, the existing file is deleted (clobbered) by default. If the existing file is not writable but is in a directory that is writable, the mv command asks for confirmation (if run from a terminal) before proceeding, unless the -f (force) option is used.

Accidental overwriting can be prevented using the GNU codice_7 (long format: codice_8) flag. Alternatively, codice_9 (codice_10) only overwrites destination files that are older than source files, codice_11 (codice_12) asks for confirmation upon each name conflict, and codice_13 (codice_14) renames target files out of the way.

A related ambiguity arises when a filename is moved to an existing directory. By default, codice_2 would handle this as one trying to move a name inside this directory. GNU mv has a switch for disabling this assumption and try to overwrite the directory instead. An inverse makes the move-to-directory operation explicit.

==Moving versus copying and removing==
Moving files &quot;within the same file system&quot; is generally implemented differently than copying the file and then removing the original. On platforms that do not support the rename syscall, a new link is added to the new directory and the original one is deleted. The data of the file is not accessed. All POSIX-conformant systems implement the &quot;rename&quot; call.

An actual move (effectively a rename) is dramatically faster than the circuitous copy-and-move procedure. The file&#x27;s i-number (short for &quot;inode number&quot;) does not change. No permission is required to read the file being moved insofar as—conceptually speaking—it is only information that is being changed as a result of the &quot;move.&quot; Since the source and target directories are being modified, to wit, entries are being created within the target directory and erased from within the source directory, &quot;write&quot; permission in both directories is required to complete the move. Moving files from one file system to another may fail entirely or may be automatically performed as an atomic copy-and-delete action; the actual details are dependent upon the implementation.

Moving a directory from one parent to a different parent directory requires write permission in the directory being moved, in addition to permissions to modify the old and new parents. This is because the i-number for the directory entry &quot;..&quot; (which can be used in any context as an alias for the parent of the current directory) changes as a result of the rename.

==Options==
Most versions of mv support:
* codice_11 interactively process, write a prompt to standard error before moving a file that would overwrite an existing file. If the response from the standard input begins with the character &#x27;y&#x27; or &#x27;Y&#x27;, the move is attempted. (Overrides previous -f option.)
* codice_17 force overwriting the destination (overrides previous -i option).

These options are a part of X/Open Portability Guidelines, later the basis of POSIX and SUS. All POSIX-compliant mv implementations must support these.

==Examples==
Note that, in the above example, &quot;/mnt&quot; referred to the directory (the &quot;mount point&quot;) over which a given file system is mounted. Naming such directories &quot;/mnt&quot; is a popular convention but is by no means necessary. A &quot;file system&quot; can be thought of as an independent tree that is logically regarded as a unit; its root is &quot;mounted&quot; atop a directory of the administrator&#x27;s choice. Any previous contents of that directory are invisible, but they are &quot;restored&quot; when the new volume is unmounted.

<doc id="1202614" wikidata="Q974278" url="?curid=1202614" title="Mutiny on the Bay">
<text>Mutiny on the Bay is an album of live recordings by the Dead Kennedys. The album’s material was compiled from a number of concerts in 1982 and 1986 in the band’s hometown of San Francisco with an additional track taken from the band’s final show in Davis, California before their break up in 1986.

&quot;Mutiny on the Bay&quot; was put together and released after a lengthy lawsuit, which resulted in the rights to the Dead Kennedys&#x27; catalog being transferred from lead singer/songwriter Jello Biafra&#x27;s record label, Alternative Tentacles to the other three members of the band following Biafra&#x27;s conviction on civil fraud and other charges. The album’s title alludes to the wresting of these rights (the “mutiny”) and the band’s home (The San Francisco Bay Area) with a nod to the Royal Navy’s famed Mutiny on the Bounty that served as the basis for numerous novels and films. The album’s quality has been criticized by singer Jello Biafra.

==Track listing==
==Venues==
The album is not one consecutive concert, but rather tracks culled from various performances in 1982 and 1986.

The tracks &quot;Police Truck&quot;, &quot;Holiday in Cambodia&quot;, &quot;Forward to Death&quot;, &quot;I Am the Owl&quot; and &quot;Riot&quot; were recorded at the Elite Club, San Francisco, on March 20, 1982. &quot;Hellnation&quot;, &quot;California über alles&quot;, &quot;Too Drunk to Fuck&quot; and &quot;This Could Be Anywhere&quot; were recorded at The Stone, San Francisco, on February 16, 1986. &quot;Moon Over Marin&quot;, &quot;M.T.V. − Get off the Air&quot; and &quot;Goons of Hazard&quot; were also recorded at The Stone the following day.

As a peculiarity &quot;Kill the Poor&quot; was recorded on February 21, 1986, at Freeborn Hall in Davis, California. The show is notable in that it was the final performance of the Dead Kennedys with Jello Biafra.

<doc id="1202615" wikidata="Q380092" url="?curid=1202615" title="Francis Borgia">
<text>Francis Borgia (; ; 28 October 1510 – 30 September 1572) was a Spanish Jesuit priest. The great-grandson of both Pope Alexander VI and King Ferdinand II of Aragon, he was Duke of Gandía and a grandee of Spain. After the death of his wife, Borgia renounced his titles and became a priest in the Society of Jesus, later serving as its third superior general. He was canonized on 20 June 1670 by Pope Clement X.

==Early life==
He was born in the Duchy of Gandía in the Kingdom of Valencia (part of Crown of Aragon), on 28 October 1510. His father was Juan Borgia, 3rd Duke of Gandía, the son of Giovanni Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia). His mother was Juana, daughter of Alonso de Aragón, Archbishop of Zaragoza, who, in turn, was the illegitimate son of King Ferdinand II of Aragon. His brother, Tomás de Borja y Castro, also entered the Church, becoming Bishop of Málaga, and later Archbishop of Zaragoza.

As a child he was very pious and wished to become a monk, but his family sent him instead to serve in the court of his second uncle Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (who was also King Charles I of Spain), where he was welcomed warmly. He excelled there, accompanying the Emperor on several campaigns.

==Adult life and career==
In Madrid in the month of September 1529, he married a Portuguese noblewoman, Leonor de Castro Mello y Meneses. They had eight children: Carlos in 1530, Isabel in 1532, Juan in 1533, Álvaro circa 1535, Juana also circa 1535, Fernando in 1537, Dorotea in 1538, and Alfonso in 1539.

Upon Borgia&#x27;s marriage, Charles V appointed him Marquess of Lombay, master of the hounds, and equerry to the empress. In 1539, he convoyed the corpse of Isabella of Portugal, Philip II of Spain&#x27;s mother, to her burial place in Granada. In that same year, he became Viceroy of Catalonia, replacing Fadrique de Portugal y Noroña.

During this period of his life, Borgia composed liturgical music, which the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia praises for its contrapuntal style.

In 1543, Borgia&#x27;s father died, and Borgia accordingly became the 4th Duke of Gandía. His diplomatic abilities came into question after his failed attempt at arranging a marriage between Prince Philip of Spain and the Princess of Portugal, thus ending a hope of bringing these two countries together, and resulting in his retirement as duke, handing his title to his son, Carlos. Borgia, now 33, retired to his native place and devoted himself to religious activities.

==Jesuit priest==

After the 1546 death of his wife Eleanor, Francis Borgia decided to enter the newly formed Society of Jesus. He put his affairs in order, renouncing his titles in favour of his eldest son Carlos de Borja-Aragon y de Castro-Melo, and entered the order by 1550. On 25 May 1551, Borgia was ordained a Jesuit priest.

Borgia helped in the establishment of what is now the Gregorian University in Rome. Upon Borgia&#x27;s return from a journey to Peru, Pope Julius III made known his intention to make him a cardinal. To prevent this, Borgia decided, in agreement with Ignatius of Loyola, to leave the city secretly and go to the Basque Country.

In 1554, Borgia became the Jesuit commissary-general in Spain, where he founded a dozen colleges. After the death in January 1565 of Diego Laynez, Borgia was elected the third Superior General of the Society of Jesus.

Borgia went on to found the &quot;Collegium Romanum&quot; and closely supervised all the affairs of the rapidly growing order until his death in 1572.

==Death and legacy==
Francis Borgia died on 30 September 1572, in Rome. His body was repatriated to Spain in 1617; Francisco Gómez de Sandoval y Rojas, 1st Duke of Lerma financed the construction of a Jesuit professed house in Madrid north of Plaza Mayor where the body might be kept, and it was relocated there in 1627. 

On 30 July 1901, the silver urn containing Borgia&#x27;s relics was transferred to a church on Flor Baja street, which was dedicated to Sacred Heart and San Francis Borgia. This church was part of a new Jesuit residence established thanks to a donation from , and in 1911 the residence became a professed house. After that church was destroyed by arson in 1931, some of Borgia&#x27;s ashes were recovered and eventually reinterred in the new Jesuit complex on calle de Serrano.

Francis Borgia was beatified in Madrid on 23 November 1624, by Pope Urban VIII. He was canonized nearly 35 years later on 20 June 1670, by Pope Clement X. His liturgical feast was inserted into the General Roman Calendar in 1688 for celebration on 10 October.

Parishes are dedicated to Francis Borgia in locations including:
* Chicago, Illinois 
* Sturgis, Kentucky 
* Washington, Missouri
* Blair, Nebraska 
* Cedarburg, Wisconsin 
* Isio, Cauayan, Negros Occidental, Philippines 

The Jesuit-founded city of São Borja, in southern Brazil, is named after Francis Borgia. St. Francis Borgia Regional High School is located in Washington, Missouri. Marc-Antoine Charpentier composed &quot;Motet pour St François de Borgia&quot; (H.354, for 1 voice, 2 treble instruments, and continuo) in his honor in the late 1680s.

<text>Hamburg State Park is a 741 acre (3.00 km2) state park located near Jewell and Warthen in the U.S. state of Georgia. It is home to a 1921 water-powered grist mill still operating today, and a museum with antique agricultural tools and appliances used in rural Georgia. The park&#x27;s location on the 225 acre (0.91 km2) Hamburg Lake makes it a great place for fishing.

The state park took its name from the former industrial town of Hamburg, South Carolina.

<doc id="1202638" wikidata="Q3951813" url="?curid=1202638" title="Scene It?">
<text>Scene It? is an interactive film series created by Screenlife Games, in which players answer trivia questions about films or pop culture. The games were first developed to be played with questions read from trivia cards or viewed on a television from an included DVD or based on clips from movies, TV shows, music videos, sports and other popular culture phenomena. &quot;Scene It?&quot; was released on mobile and console platforms. After discontinuation in 2012, the series was revived in 2022, with streaming functionality replacing DVDs. It is owned by Paramount Pictures since 2008.

==History==
Screenlife Games, the game company that invented and produced &quot;Scene It?&quot;, was founded in 2001 by two entrepreneurs, Craig Kinzer and David Long. Craig Kinzer served as the majority shareholder and chairman of the board, while David Long assumed the role of CEO.

The game&#x27;s inception came from David&#x27;s use of VHS tapes for Halloween parties, which sparked Craig&#x27;s idea of utilizing DVDs and DVD players as game machines. They devised a code to embed on DVDs that transformed any DVD player into a random game machine. With hundreds of millions of DVD players already distributed worldwide, &quot;Scene It?&quot; quickly gained popularity.

The secret to their success, apart from the innovative DVD code, was their ability to secure licensing agreements with major studios and associated actors and writers. Through persuasive negotiations, Dave and Craig convinced these studios to reduce their licensing costs to a share of a small pool based on the game&#x27;s gross revenue. To this day, &quot;Scene It?&quot; stands as the only product boasting involvement from all of the major studios including Universal Pictures, 20th Century Studios, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Sony Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Walt Disney Pictures, and DreamWorks Pictures. These studios were among the most prominent and influential in the film industry at that time.

Their first breakthrough came when Angela Lansbury agreed to be featured in the game, followed by Tom Cruise. With studios, Universal and Fox, plus a few notable actors on board, Screenlife&#x27;s licensing business flourished. The company established two royalty pools—one for studios and one for actors—encompassing thousands of individuals or entities.

To enhance gameplay, they incorporated elements from other popular games like Trivial Pursuit, Concentration, and Pictionary, creating unique play scenarios that challenged participants with movie-themed questions. For instance, Craig&#x27;s youngest son, Austin, conceived the idea of using Concentration by displaying a spinning top on the screen, followed by an image of a gun after a few seconds, prompting players to guess the movie. These innovative additions were provided free of charge, incurring no additional expenses to Screenlife.

One of their additional secrets to success was the transition from selling mere discs to creating an entire board game in a large game box. This strategic move boosted the retail price from $10 to $50, further solidifying their market position and profitability. &quot;Scene It?&quot; debuted during Christmas 2002 through Wizards of the Coast and Nordstrom. Its initial season of sales exceeded all expectations, surpassing the competition, despite the countless games that fail to gain traction each year.

Recognizing the game&#x27;s potential, Mattel secured a licensing agreement, leading to its availability in Walmart and stores nationwide. On October 7, 2008, Paramount Pictures, a division of Viacom, closed on its acquisition of Screenlife, marking a significant monetization for the company. Screenlife&#x27;s establishment coincided with the widespread adoption of DVD players, and its sale occurred just before the rise of streaming and other digital media. The series was discontinued in 2012 when Paramount closed the studio.

In 2022, Paramount revived &quot;Scene It?&quot; as a streaming board game.

==Gameplay==
Players choose either a short or full game by adjusting the &quot;Flextime&quot; game board: For a short game, the board is folded so fewer spaces show. Each player throws a six-sided die to see who goes first. Then, the player rolls both the ordinary die and a customized eight-sided &quot;category die&quot; to see how far they move, and what challenge they face. The challenge can range from a trivia card question, a DVD challenge, (&quot;My Play&quot; (where a selected clip is shown and the player who is on their turn answers the question) or &quot;All Play&quot; (where all players can answer a non-clip question)), or they may have to draw a &quot;Buzz card&quot; where they follow it&#x27;s instructions and the turn ends. (Cards are often renamed in special editions, such as a &quot;Prime Directive&quot; card in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; edition). If the roller wins the challenge, they can go again, but if they lose, the dice are handed to the next player (except in &quot;all play&quot; as the first player to answer the question is not the player who is on their turn they can give another player a buzz card or move forward one space, if a tie occurs a tie-breaker from the DVD is used). This process keeps going until someone hits the All Play to Win stop sign, in which that player must win one final All Play, in which everyone participates, in order to win. If not, they go to ring 3 of the zone called Final Cut and the other player who answers the question can move forward three spaces or give another player a buzz card (though players in final cut are immune from them.) There, they must answer 3 questions right. If that falls through, then on the next turn they only have to answer 2 questions, and if they fail that as well, they answer 1 question on every following turn. If a Final Cut challenge is won, then they win the game, and they get to watch a victory scene on the DVD.

All DVDs of &quot;Scene It?&quot; use Optreve DVD Enhancement Technology, designed to reshuffle itself every time it is inserted into the DVD player. In some instances, the DVD player may reset the system, and in this case, the DVD will reshuffle itself before returning players to the game menu. If a question from a previous game is shown in the same session, players can hit the &quot;Return&quot; button on their remote in order to start a new question. In addition, some my play clips from previous games may be reused though may show a different question. Some DVD players do not support this technology, but players can choose from 20 to 25 (depends on version) pre-set games to play. As their title suggests, these game sets are not random, and stay constant, no matter how many times the DVD is reset.

=== Video games ===

A video game version of &quot;Scene It?&quot;, entitled &quot;Scene It? Lights, Camera, Action&quot; was released for the Xbox 360 on November 6, 2007. It featured 20 new game modes/categories and special game show-style &quot;Big Button Controllers&quot;. The first sequel, &quot;Scene It? Box Office Smash&quot; was released on October 28, 2008, featuring the new Xbox 360 Avatars. A second sequel, &quot;Scene It? Bright Lights! Big Screen!&quot; was released on November 17, 2009, for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii. Opting for a multi-platform approach, this title abandoned the avatars in favor of more generic characters. After &quot;Scene It? Twilight&quot; two sequels were released: on November 18, 2010, &quot;Scene It? Harry Potter HD&quot; for iOS and on November 30, 2011, &quot;Scene It? Movie Night&quot; for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

Two unsuccessful, web-only versions of the game, &quot;Scene It? Online&quot;, and &quot;Scene It? Daily&quot;, were made available online, on Facebook, and on mobile platforms. &quot;Scene It? Online&quot; borrowed strongly from the DVD games&#x27; format, including video clips, sound clips, and puzzles. &quot;Scene It? Daily&quot; was predominantly text based, and represented a major departure from the multimedia-centric roots of the series.

A sampler disc was made for the Harry Potter Scene It? game which had the same content as the game disc in the full game, but it didn’t come with the board, the cards, or the dice. It also came with a bonus feature which was a behind the scenes featurette of the making of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.

<doc id="1202642" wikidata="Q5419863" url="?curid=1202642" title="Executive Order 12148">
<text>Executive Order 12148 was an executive order enacted by President Jimmy Carter on July 20, 1979, to transfer and reassign duties to the newly formed agency, known as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), created by Executive Order 12127. The order combined several federal agencies tasked with emergency preparedness and civil defense spread across the executive departments into a unified entity that was established as an independent agency, free of Cabinet interference, with authority as the lead federal agency in a presidentially-declared disaster.

The agency&#x27;s place within the governmental structure was changed on March 1, 2003, when FEMA became part of the Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate.

==Revocations==
E.O. 12148 also revoked the following Executive Orders or parts thereof: (E.O. Numbers)

<text>Ian Gordon Campbell (born 22 May 1959) is an Australian former politician who served as a Senator for Western Australia from 1990 to 2007, representing the Liberal Party. He was a minister in the Howard government from 2003 to 2007.

==Early life==
Campbell was born in Perth, Western Australia and lived for a time in Brisbane where he attended Brisbane Grammar School. He was a commercial and industrial property consultant and company director before entering politics.

==Politics==
Campbell was chosen by the parliament of Western Australia on 16 May 1990 to replace retiring Senator Fred Chaney. He was elected in his own right in 1993, 1998 and 2004. He was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry 1994–96.

In government, he served in numerous roles: Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (1996); Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (1996); Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the Senate (1996); Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (1996–98); Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (1998–2001); and Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (2001–03). He was responsible for overseeing the federal government&#x27;s preparations for the Y2K bug.

He was involved in presenting the bill that became the &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot;.

Campbell also later served as Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads (2003–04), Minister for the Environment and Heritage (2004–07), and Minister for Human Services (2007).

===Minister for the Environment and Heritage (2004–07)===
In July 2004, a pre-election reshuffle saw Campbell become Minister for the Environment and Heritage. In this role, he acknowledged the need for action on climate change but argued that it was important to consider environmental issues in an economic context. Amid growing community concern over the issue, he also argued for a &quot;post-Kyoto arrangement that is effective&quot; and a &quot;portfolio approach&quot; to the issue, rejecting the notion of &quot;silver bullet&quot; solutions.

Campbell was a vigorous critic of whaling. Through the International Whaling Commission, he actively campaigned against commercial and &quot;scientific&quot; whaling.

In 2006, Campbell drew criticism for blocking a wind farm project in south-eastern Victoria on the basis that it may pose a risk to the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot. Commentators and the opposition rejected the decision as inconsistent and politically motivated.

In 2006, Campbell was criticised for the approval of the Cloud Break mine in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, because of the number of endangered species in the area of the future mine, among them the incredibly rare night parrot.

===Minister for Human Services (2007)===
In January 2007, a cabinet reshuffle saw Campbell appointed Minister for Human Services, which was elevated to a cabinet position. However, on 3 March 2007, Campbell resigned after revelations he had met disgraced former Western Australian Premier Brian Burke. The resignation came in the midst of Liberal Party attacks on Opposition leader Kevin Rudd for also having met with Mr Burke, and was seen as a strategy to pressure and undermine Rudd. Prime Minister John Howard defended Campbell from charges of any moral wrongdoing, despite deputy leader Peter Costello&#x27;s claim in Parliament that anyone who dealt with Brian Burke was morally compromised.

Campbell announced his retirement from politics on 4 May 2007, saying that the Prime Minister had told him the door was still open for a return to the cabinet, but that he had decided to pursue a career in the private sector. The Liberal Party in Western Australia chose Mathias Cormann to take his place. Campbell formally resigned his Senate seat on 31 May 2007.

Campbell stated on Sky News in 2021 Mark Mcgowan and his Labor government deserved to be re elected at the 2021 WA state election. https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=424488945446584&amp;id=57886636727&amp;locale=he_IL

<doc id="1202646" wikidata="Q190512" url="?curid=1202646" title="Tear gas">
<text>Tear gas, also known as a lachrymatory agent or lachrymator (), sometimes colloquially known as &quot;mace&quot; after the early commercial self-defense spray, is a chemical weapon that stimulates the nerves of the lacrimal gland in the eye to produce tears. In addition, it can cause severe eye and respiratory pain, skin irritation, bleeding, and blindness. Common lachrymators both currently and formerly used as tear gas include pepper spray (OC gas), PAVA spray (nonivamide), CS gas, CR gas, CN gas (phenacyl chloride), bromoacetone, xylyl bromide, chloropicrin (PS gas) and Mace (a branded mixture).

While lachrymatory agents are commonly deployed for riot control by law enforcement and military personnel, its use in warfare is prohibited by various international treaties. During World War I, increasingly toxic and deadly lachrymatory agents were used.

The short and long-term effects of tear gas are not well studied. The published peer-reviewed literature consists of lower quality evidence that do not establish causality. Exposure to tear gas agents may produce numerous short-term and long-term health effects, including development of respiratory illnesses, severe eye injuries and diseases (such as traumatic optic neuropathy, keratitis, glaucoma, and cataracts), dermatitis, damage of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems, and death, especially in cases with exposure to high concentrations of tear gas or application of the tear gases in enclosed spaces.

==Effects ==
Tear gas generally consists of aerosolized solid or liquid compounds (bromoacetone or xylyl bromide), not gas. Tear gas works by irritating mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, mouth and lungs. It causes crying, sneezing, coughing, difficulty breathing, pain in the eyes, and temporary blindness. With CS gas, symptoms of irritation typically appear after 20 to 60 seconds of exposure and commonly resolve within 30 minutes of leaving (or being removed from) the area.

===Risks===
As with all non-lethal or less-lethal weapons, there is a risk of serious permanent injury or death when tear gas is used. This includes risks from being hit by tear gas cartridges that may cause severe bruising, loss of eyesight, or skull fracture, resulting in immediate death. A case of serious vascular injury from tear gas shells has also been reported from Iran, with high rates of associated nerve injury (44%) and amputation (17%), as well as instances of head injuries in young people. Novel findings suggest that menstrual changes are one of the most commonly reported health issues in women.

While the medical consequences of the gases themselves are typically limited to minor skin inflammation, delayed complications are also possible. People with pre-existing respiratory conditions such as asthma are particularly at risk. They are likely to need medical attention and may sometimes require hospitalization or even ventilation support. Skin exposure to CS may cause chemical burns or induce allergic contact dermatitis. When people are hit at close range or are severely exposed, eye injuries involving scarring of the cornea can lead to a permanent loss in visual acuity. Frequent or high levels of exposure carry increased risks of respiratory illness.

Venezuelan chemist Mónica Kräuter studied thousands of tear gas canisters fired by Venezuelan authorities since 2014. She concluded that the majority of canisters used the main component CS gas, but that 72% of the tear gas used was expired. She noted that expired tear gas &quot;breaks down into cyanide oxide, phosgenes and nitrogens that are extremely dangerous&quot;.

In the 2019–20 Chilean protests various people have had complete and permanent loss of vision in one or both eyes as result of the impact of tear gas grenades.

The majority (2116; 93.8%) of protestors who reported exposure to tear gas during the 2020 protests in Portland, Oregon (USA) reported physical (2114; 93.7%) or psychological (1635; 72.4%) health issues experienced immediately after (2105; 93.3%) or days following (1944; 86.1%) the exposure. The majority (1233; 54.6%) of respondents who reported exposure to tear gas during the 2020 protests in Portland, Oregon (US) have also reported receiving or planning to seek medical or mental healthcare for their tear gas-related health issues. It has been shown that health issues associated with the exposure to tear gas are often require medical attention.

===Site of action===

TRPA1 ion channels expressed on nociceptors have been implicated as the site of action for CS gas, CR gas, CN gas (phenacyl chloride), chloropicrin and bromoacetone in rodent models.

==Use==

===Warfare===

During World War I, various forms of tear gas were used in combat and tear gas was the most common form of chemical weapon used. None of the belligerents believed that the use of irritant gases violated the Hague Convention of 1899 which prohibited the use of &quot;poison or poisoned weapons&quot; in warfare. Use of chemical weapons escalated during the war to lethal gases, after 1914 (during which only tear gas was used).

The US Chemical Warfare Service developed tear gas grenades for use in riot control in 1919.

Use of tear gas in interstate warfare, as with all other chemical weapons, was prohibited by the Geneva Protocol of 1925: it prohibited the use of &quot;asphyxiating gas, or any other kind of gas, liquids, substances or similar materials&quot;, a treaty that most states have signed. Police and civilian self-defense use is not banned in the same manner.

Tear gas was used in combat by Italy in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, by Japan in the Second Sino-Japanese War, by Spain in the Rif War and by the United States in the Vietnam War, and Israel Israel–Palestine conflict.

Tear gas exposure is an element of military training programs, typically as a means of improving trainees&#x27; tolerance to tear gas and encouraging confidence in the ability of their issued protective equipment to prevent chemical weapons exposure.

===Riot control===

Certain lachrymatory agents, most notably tear gas, are often used by police to force compliance. In some countries (e.g., Finland, Australia, and United States), another common substance is mace. The self-defense weapon form of mace is based on pepper spray which comes in small spray cans. Versions including CS are manufactured for police use. Xylyl bromide, CN and CS are the oldest of these agents. CS is the most widely used. CN has the most recorded toxicity.

Typical manufacturer warnings on tear gas cartridges state &quot;Danger: Do not fire directly at person(s). Severe injury or death may result.&quot; Tear gas guns do not have a manual setting to adjust the range of fire. The only way to adjust the projectile&#x27;s range is to aim towards the ground at the correct angle. Incorrect aim will send the capsules away from the targets, causing risk for non-targets instead.


===Counter-measures===
A variety of protective equipment may be used, including gas masks and respirators. In riot control situations, protesters sometimes use equipment (aside from simple rags or clothing over the mouth) such as swimming goggles and adapted water bottles, as well as covering as much skin as possible.

Activists in United States, the Czech Republic, Venezuela and Turkey have reported using antacid solutions such as Maalox diluted with water to repel effects of tear gas attacks, with Venezuelan chemist Mónica Kräuter recommending the usage of diluted antacids as well as baking soda. There have also been reports of these antacids being helpful for tear gas, and for capsaicin-induced skin pain.

During the 2019 Hong Kong protests, frontline protesters became adept at extinguishing tear gas: they formed special teams that sprang into action as soon as it was fired. These individuals generally wore protective clothing, including heat-proof gloves, or covered their arms and legs with cling film to prevent the painful skin irritation. Canisters were sometimes picked up and lobbed back at police or extinguished straight away with water, or neutralized using objects such as traffic cones. They shared information about models of 3M respirator filters which had been found to be most effective against tear gas, and where those models could be purchased. Other volunteers carried saline solutions to rinse the eyes of those affected. Similarly, Chilean protesters of Primera Línea had specialized individuals collecting and extinguishing the tear gas grenades. Others acted as tear gas medics, and another group, the &quot;shield-bearers,&quot; protected the protesters from the direct physical impact of the grenades.

==Treatment==

There is no specific antidote to common tear gases. At the first sign of exposure or potential exposure, masks are applied when available. People are removed from the affected area when possible. Immediate removal of contact lenses has also been recommended, as they can retain particles.

Decontamination is by physical or mechanical removal (brushing, washing, rinsing) of solid or liquid agents. Water may transiently exacerbate the pain caused by CS gas and pepper spray but is still effective, although fat-containing oils or soaps may be more effective against pepper spray. Eyes are decontaminated by copious flushing with sterile water or saline or (with OC) open-eye exposure to wind from a fan. Referral to an ophthalmologist is needed if slit-lamp examination shows impaction of solid particles of agent. Blowing the nose to get rid of the chemicals is recommended, as is avoiding rubbing of the eyes. There are reports that water may increase pain from CS gas, but the balance of limited evidence currently suggests water or saline are the best options. Some evidence suggests that Diphoterine, a hypertonic amphoteric salt solution, a first aid product for chemical splashes, may help with ocular burns or chemicals in the eye.

Bathing and washing the body vigorously with soap and water can remove particles that adhere to the skin. Clothes, shoes and accessories that come into contact with vapors must be washed well since all untreated particles can remain active for up to a week. Some advocate using fans or hair dryers to evaporate the spray, but this has not been shown to be better than washing out the eyes and it may spread contamination.

Anticholinergics can work like some antihistamines as they reduce lacrymation and decrease salivation, acting as an antisialagogue, and for overall nose discomfort as they are used to treat allergic reactions in the nose (e.g., itching, runny nose, and sneezing).

Oral analgesics may help relieve eye pain.

Most effects resulting from riot-control agents are transient and do not require treatment beyond decontamination, and most patients do not need observation beyond 4 hours. However, patients should be instructed to return if they develop effects such as blistering or delayed-onset shortness of breath.

=== Home remedies ===
Vinegar, petroleum jelly, milk and lemon juice solutions have also been used by activists. It is unclear how effective these remedies are. In particular, vinegar itself can burn the eyes and prolonged inhalation can also irritate the airways. Vegetable oil and vinegar have been reported as helping relieve burning caused by pepper spray, Kräuter suggests the usage of baking soda or toothpaste, stating that they trap the particles emanating from the gas near the airways that are more feasible to inhale. A small trial of baby shampoo for washing out the eyes did not show any benefit.

<doc id="1202655" wikidata="Q641211" url="?curid=1202655" title="Ahmadiyya Caliphate">
<text>The Ahmadiyya Caliphate is a non-political caliphate established on May 27, 1908, following the death of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, who claimed to be a Prophet, a Messenger, the promised Messiah and Mahdi, the expected redeemer awaited by Muslims. It is believed by Ahmadis to be the re-establishment of the Rashidun Caliphate that commenced following the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The caliphs are entitled &quot;Khalīfatul Masīh&quot; (; ), sometimes simply referred to as &quot;Khalifa&quot; (or Caliph). The caliph is the elected spiritual and organizational leader of the worldwide Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and is the successor of Ghulam Ahmad. He is believed by the Community to be divinely ordained and is also referred to by its members as &quot;Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin&quot; (Leader of the Faithful) and &quot;Imam Jama&#x27;at&quot; (Imam of the Community). The 5th and current Caliph of the Messiah of the Ahmadiyya Community is Mirza Masroor Ahmad.

After the death of Ghulam Ahmad, his successors directed the Ahmadiyya Community from Qadian, India which remained the headquarters of the community until 1947 with the creation of Pakistan. From this time on the headquarters remained in Rabwah, a town built on land bought in Pakistan by the community in 1948. In 1984, Ordinance XX was promulgated by the government of Pakistan which prohibited Ahmadi Muslims from any public expression of the Islamic faith, rendering the caliph unable to perform his duties as the leader of the community. Due to these circumstances, the 4th caliph left Pakistan and migrated to London, England, provisionally moving the headquarters to the Fazl Mosque.

Since the Ahmadiyya is widely viewed as a heterodox movement by the mainstream of Sunni and Shia Islam, most Muslims outside the movement do not recognise Ahmadi claims to a caliphate.

== Overview ==

Ahmadi Muslims believe the system of caliphate (Arabic: &quot;Khilāfah&quot;) to be an ancillary to the system of prophethood, continuing to strive for the objectives for which a prophet is sent and to carry to completion the tasks of reformation and moral training that were seeded by the prophet. The caliphs, as successors to the prophets, lead the community of believers after a prophet&#x27;s death.

Ahmadis maintain that in accordance with Quranic verses (such as Q) and numerous hadith on the issue, the caliphate can only be established by God Himself and is a divine blessing given to &quot;those who believe and work righteousness&quot;, upholding the Unity of God. Therefore, any movement to establish the caliphate centered around human endeavours alone is bound to fail, particularly when the condition of the people diverges from the ‘precepts of Prophethood’ (&quot;minhājin nabūwwah&quot;) and they are as a result disunited. Although the caliph (Arabic: &quot;khalifa&quot;) in Ahmadiyya is elected, it is believed that God Himself directs the hearts and minds of believers through visions, dreams and spiritual guidance towards a particular individual. No campaigning, speeches or speculation of any kind are permitted. Thus the caliph is designated neither necessarily by right (i.e. the rightful or competent one in the eyes of the people at that time) nor merely by election but primarily by God.

According to Ahmadiyya thought, just as it is not essential for a prophet to be the head of a state, it is not essential for a caliph to be the head of a state, rather the religious and organisational significance of the caliphate is emphasised. It is above all a religious office, with the purpose to uphold, strengthen and spread Islam and maintain the high moral standards within the Muslim community established by Muhammad, who was not merely a political leader but primarily a religious leader. The caliphate is understood as a system dealing with the organisation of believers and relating to the administration (&quot;nizām&quot;) of the Muslim community whether or not it involves a governmental role. Being based on the &#x27;precept of Prophethood&#x27;, the institution of caliphate can therefore, like prophethood, exist and flourish without a state. If a caliph does happen to bear governmental authority as a head of state, it is incidental and subsidiary in relation to his overall function as caliph which is applicable to believers transnationally and not limited to one particular state or political entity. The system of caliphate in Islam, thus understood, transcends national sovereignty and ethnic divide, forming a universal supra-national entity and the role of a caliph as the leader of the Muslim community, in such an understanding, surpasses that of a monarch.

Because Muhammad became the head of state at Medina, the Rightly Guided successors after him also happened to be heads of state and – similar to the successors of Moses who led the Israelites after his death and, following the conquest of Canaan, gained control over a territory– functioned as political and military as well as religious leaders. Since Ghulam Ahmad, whom Ahmadis hold to be the promised Mahdi, was, like Jesus, not the head of a state, his successors after him – like the successors of Jesus did – function without attaching themselves to any state, seeking no political role and having no territorial ambition. In terms of the political aspect of the caliphate as envisioned within the Ahmadiyya community, since God&#x27;s sovereignty is seen as extending over the universe, the ideal polity within Islam is one where the caliph is the spiritual head guiding, in accordance with Islamic principles, a federation or confederation of autonomous states (functioning under any political system or form of government) associated together for the maintenance of peace and cooperating in promoting human welfare throughout the world. Such a framework allows the caliph to relegate, if he sees fit, most or all his secular authority to the elected representatives of the members of such a confederation.

== Basis in Qur&#x27;an and Hadith ==
According to Ahmadiyya belief, God has promised in the Qur&#x27;an to appoint a successor among the righteous. In this respect, verse 56 (55 if the Basmallah isn&#x27;t counted) of Surah Al-Nur says: 
A prophecy by Muhammad about the reestablishment of righteous Khilafat is narrated in Musnad Ahmad: 
== The second Manifestation of God’s power ==

The succession of the caliph is believed by the Ahmadis to be the second manifestation of God&#x27;s power that Ghulam Ahmad wrote about in his last testament &quot;Al-Wassiyyat&quot; (The Will).

The Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement however does not subscribe to this belief and follow the concept of Anjuman (Council) that was described in the same book.

<text>The Tanzania national football team () represents Tanzania in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Tanzania Football Federation, the governing body for football in Tanzania, Tanzania&#x27;s home ground is Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium in Dar es Salaam and their head coach is Adel Amrouche from Algeria. They are colloquially known as the &quot;Taifa Stars&quot;. Tanzania has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup. Before uniting with Zanzibar, the team played as the Tanganyika national football team, The team represents both FIFA and Confederation of African Football (CAF).

The island of Zanzibar, part of Tanzania (and once an independent nation), is also an associate member of CAF and has played matches with other nations, but is not eligible to enter the World Cup or Africa Cup of Nations. See &quot;Zanzibar national football team&quot;.

Tanzania is currently ranked 121st in the FIFA World Rankings.

==History==
Since qualifying for the 1980 Africa Cup of Nations, Tanzania endured nearly 40 years without major success, struggling in both African and World Cup qualifiers. Their best effort was in 2008 Africa Cup of Nations qualification, where the &quot;Taifa Stars&quot; defeated Burkina Faso twice and only finished three points behind group winners Senegal. In 2010 Tanzania won the CECAFA Cup for the third time.

A recent achievement was a 1–0 win against South Africa in the 2017 COSAFA Cup Quarter-finals. But afterwards, Tanzania lost the Semi-finals 2–4 to Zambia. Then, in the Third-place playoff, Tanzania managed to win the match against Lesotho 4–2 in a penalty shootout after the extra time ended in a goalless draw. This Third place was considered Tanzania&#x27;s biggest football achievement in many years.

On 24 March 2019, Tanzania beat East African rivals Uganda 3–0 to reach the finals of the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time in 39 years. At the Finals the &quot;Taifa Stars&quot;, being the weakest team in the group, lost all three Group C matches, as predicted. A few months later, Tanzania qualified for the African Nations Championship for only the second time, as well as defeating Burundi in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers. 

On 19 November 2024 Tanzania won a narrow victory of 1–0 against Guinea which secured their fourth times Afcon qualification since 1980. A decisive goal by Simon Msuva sent them to the tournament in 2025. The Afcon finals are scheduled to take place from 21 December 2025 to 18 January 2026 in Morocco.

<text>Quintessential Player (also called QMP and formerly QCD) was a freeware, multi-format media player developed by Paul Quinn.

Quintessential Player began life in 1997 as a CD-only player for Windows, when it was known as Quintessential CD Player (hence the &#x27;QCD&#x27; moniker associated with the player). Over the years, Quintessential Player gained support for playing MP3s and other audio formats, video playback, and an optional media library was added to the player. This latter addition gave rise to the use of the name Quintessential Media Player, or QMP for short. PC World Magazine named Quintessential Player as one of their choices for &#x27;Best Media Player&#x27;, and it was also selected for inclusion in the Pricelessware list of best freeware.

It was the only way of submitting audio metadata (on CD tracks, artists, etc. as created by a tag editor) to Gracenote&#x27;s CD database other than iTunes, and was still listed as such even in 2019.

==Features==
Quintessential Player natively supported:

*MP3, Ogg, WAV, and CD Playback
*Video Playback with the aid of External Codecs
*Full Speed CD Ripping
*MP3 Encoding
*Streaming Audio
*Tag Editing
*Gracenote CDDB
*Crossfading &amp; EQ
*Multiple Visualizations
*Skins and Plugins

A wide range of audio formats playable via the use of &quot;plugins&quot;, Audioscrobbler support (also supplied via a plugin) and many more skins allowing the customization of the players interface were obtainable from the Quinnware site.

Quintessential Player also had fully functional Windows profile support and did not require administrator user access to run properly.

<text>Rhinichthys, known as the riffle daces, is a genus of freshwater fish in the carp family (Cyprinidae) of the order Cypriniformes. The type species is &quot;Rhinichthys atratulus&quot;, the blacknose dace. &quot;Rhinichthys&quot; species range throughout North America.

The genus contains eight living species, one of which (the loach minnow) is considered Vulnerable. It also includes the extinct Las Vegas dace, which was only first described in 1984 and had disappeared by 1986. The cheat minnow (&quot;Pararhinichthys bowersi&quot;), a natural hybrid of the longnose dace (&quot;R. cataractae&quot;) and the river chub (&quot;Nocomis micropogon&quot;), was formerly placed in this genus, but is now valid under &quot;Pararhinichthys&quot;.

The riffle daces are a basal lineage in an insufficiently resolved clade of American Leuciscinae. Such a group had been proposed on anatomical evidence, and was verified using mtDNA 12S rRNA sequences.(Simons &amp; Mayden 1997)

==Species==
There are currently 9 valid species;
* &quot;Rhinichthys atratulus&quot; (Eastern blacknose dace)
* &quot;Rhinichthys cataractae&quot; (Longnose dace)
* &quot;Rhinichthys cobitis&quot; (Loach minnow)
* &quot;Rhinichthys deaconi&quot; (Las Vegas dace)
* &quot;Rhinichthys evermanni&quot; (Umpqua dace)
* &quot;Rhinichthys falcatus&quot; (Leopard dace)
* &quot;Rhinichthys obtusus&quot; (Western blacknose dace)
* &quot;Rhinichthys osculus&quot; (Speckled dace)
* &quot;Rhinichthys umatilla&quot; (Umatilla dace)

<doc id="1202669" wikidata="Q6768899" url="?curid=1202669" title="Mark Minenko">
<text>Mark Minenko (born March 29, 1957) is a former politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 to 1990, representing the Winnipeg riding of Seven Oaks for the Manitoba Liberal Party.

==Early years and education==
He was born in New York City, New York. Minenko&#x27;s father was the Very Rev. Tymofiy Minenko, a Ukrainian-born priest in the Ukrainian Orthodox Church; his mother was Anastasia Krywonos. He was raised in Winnipeg, and was educated at the University of Winnipeg and the University of Manitoba. He worked as a lawyer, and also joined the Canadian Forces Medical Services in 1976, eventually reaching the rank of captain. He was awarded the Canada Forces Decoration in 1988.

==Political career==
In 1981, Minenko worked as an assistant to MLA June Westbury, who was at the time the only Liberal representative in the provincial legislature.

Minenko first ran for provincial office in the election of 1988, scoring an upset victory over outgoing New Democratic Finance Minister Eugene Kostyra in Seven Oaks. Minenko won the election by 332 votes at a time when provincial support for the NDP was at its lowest ebb since the 1960s. He was named as Deputy Speaker on July 21, 1988, but resigned on May 18, 1989.

In the provincial election of 1990, redistribution forced him to run in the riding of St. Johns against another incumbent, New Democrat Judy Wasylycia-Leis. He lost, by almost two thousand votes, amid a general decline in support for the Liberal Party. He has not sought a return to provincial politics since this time.

Minenko later became active in the Ukrainian Canadian Congress and has sought a formal apology from the federal government for the detainment of Ukrainians in concentration camps during the First World War. He also continued his education at the University of Alberta, working towards a Master of Laws degree.

<doc id="1202670" wikidata="Q445823" url="?curid=1202670" title="Brian Schweitzer">
<text>Brian David Schweitzer (born September 4, 1955) is an American farmer and politician who served as the 23rd Governor of Montana from 2005 to 2013. Schweitzer served for a time as chair of the Western Governors Association as well as the Democratic Governors Association. He also served as President of the Council of State Governments.

==Early life, education and early career==
Schweitzer was born in Havre, Montana, the fourth of six children of Kathleen Helen (née McKernan) and Adam Schweitzer. His paternal grandparents were ethnic Germans from Kuchurhan in the Odesa Oblast (then in Russian Empire, now in Ukraine); his maternal grandparents were Irish. He is a first cousin, once removed, of entertainer Lawrence Welk (Schweitzer&#x27;s paternal grandmother was Welk&#x27;s aunt).

Following his high school years at Holy Cross Abbey, Canon City, Colorado in 1973, Schweitzer earned his Bachelor of Science degree in international agronomy from Colorado State University in 1978 and a Master of Science in soil science from Montana State University, Bozeman in 1980.

Upon finishing school, Schweitzer worked as an irrigation developer on projects in Africa, Asia, Europe and South America. He spent several years working in Libya and Saudi Arabia, and speaks Arabic. He returned to Montana in 1986, settling in Whitefish.

In 1993, the Clinton administration appointed Schweitzer to the United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Farm Service Agency committee for Montana; he worked there for seven years.

==2000 U.S. Senate election==
In 2000, Schweitzer ran for the U.S. Senate to challenge Republican incumbent Conrad Burns. Burns faced a difficult re-election campaign. In February 1999, he announced that he would break his 1988 promise to only hold office for two terms, claiming &quot;Circumstances have changed, and I have rethought my position.&quot; Later that same month, while giving a speech about U.S. dependence on foreign oil to the Montana Equipment Dealers Association, Burns referred to Arabs as &quot;ragheads&quot;. Burns soon apologized, saying he &quot;became too emotionally involved&quot; during the speech. Burns faced trouble regarding deaths from asbestos in Libby, Montana. While he initially supported a bill to limit compensation in such cases, he withdrew his support for the bill, under public criticism, and added $11.5 million for the town to an appropriations bill.

While Burns attempted to link Schweitzer with presidential candidate Al Gore, Schweitzer &quot;effectively portrayed himself as nonpolitical&quot;. Schweitzer primarily challenged Burns on the issue of prescription drugs, organizing busloads of senior citizens to take trips to Canada and Mexico for cheaper medicine. Burns charged that Schweitzer favored &quot;Canadian-style government controls&quot; and claimed that senior citizens went to doctors to have &quot;somebody to visit with. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with them.&quot;

Schweitzer lost narrowly to Burns, with a 51% to 47% margin, despite being outspent two-to-one. Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore received just 33% of the vote in Montana in 2000.

==Governor of Montana (2005–2013)==
===Elections===

When incumbent Governor Judy Martz announced she would not run for re-election in 2004, Schweitzer announced his candidacy. His running mate was John Bohlinger, a Republican state senator. He won the general election by defeating Montana Secretary of State Bob Brown 50% to 46%.

In 2008, Schweitzer and Bohlinger won re-election to a second term by a landslide over Republican State Senator Roy Brown and his running mate Steve Daines; Schweitzer recurred 318,670 votes (65.4%), Brown received 158,268 votes (32.5%), and Libertarian candidate Stan Jones received 9,796 votes (2.0%).

===Policy and public image===
As governor, Schweitzer was described as having a mixture of &quot;progressive values, populist rhetoric, and Western self-reliance.&quot; Commentator Brink Lindsey classified Schweitzer as a mixture of liberal and libertarian, espousing &quot;anti-NAFTA, Wal-Mart-bashing economic populism.&quot; Both while campaigning and as governor, Schweitzer became known for a folksy public persona; his dog, a Border Collie named Jag, regularly accompanied him on work days at the Capitol, as well as some other official occasions.

Schweitzer was known for his unsparing use of the veto, a power exercised 95 times during his tenure. He vetoed 74 bills in the 2011 legislature, none of which were overridden. For instance, in April 2011, Schweitzer made news with his unconventional use of a branding iron to publicly veto several bills passed by the Republican-controlled legislature. He denounced them as &quot;frivolous, unconstitutional and just bad ideas&quot; that were &quot;in direct contradiction to the expressed will of the people of Montana.&quot; The bills vetoed by Schweitzer including anti-abortion legislation and legislation that would have repealed Montana&#x27;s 2004 legalization of medicinal marijuana.

Schweitzer has pointed out that Montana has had the highest ending fund balances in the state&#x27;s history under his administration, with an average ending fund balance of $414 million. The average balance of the eighteen years prior was $54 million.

Schweitzer consistently held one of the highest approval ratings among governors in the nation, with polls regularly showing a rating of above 60 percent.

Schweitzer was elected chair of the Democratic Governors Association in 2008.

As governor, Schweitzer emphasized early childhood education, and in 2007 signed into law a voluntary full-time kindergarten program.

In 2005, Schweitzer signed into law &quot;Indian Education for All&quot; funding, which provided for the first time funding for schools to fulfill a mandate passed in 1999 to teach tribal history in Montana schools.

Under Schweitzer, from 2009 to 2012, Montana achieved the country&#x27;s highest rate of increase in the proportion of its population with college degrees. The increase was attributed to a variety of initiatives backed by Schweitzer, including increased investments in the state&#x27;s two-year community college system (including an increase in state funding, allowing two-year colleges to freeze tuition), better skills and practical training, additional online courses, a dual enrollment program for high school students, and reforms to make it easier for students to transfer academic credits, such as from a two-year to a four-year college.

During his term as governor, Schweitzer focused on expanding Montana energy production, including both fossil fuels such as coal and oil and renewables such as wind. Schweitzer helped arrange financing for the Rim Rock Wind Farm, which opened in September 2012 as the state&#x27;s largest wind farm. He strongly supported the proposed Keystone XL pipeline project, which was opposed by environmentalists. In 2008, Schweitzer expressed support for a &quot;25x&#x27;25&quot; proposal to transition at least 25% of U.S. energy production to renewable sources by the year 2025.

In 2009, after General Motors voided its contracts with Stillwater Mining Company for the development of platinum and palladium mines in Montana following GM&#x27;s reorganization in bankruptcy, Schweitzer strongly criticized GM&#x27;s decision to withdraw from the project. Schweitzer called upon the Obama administration to force GM to continue with the project and expressed concern that the cancellation would harm Montana&#x27;s mining industry and create a national security risk, as platinum and palladium were mined in only two other nations (Russia and South Africa).

As governor, Schweitzer was an outspoken opponent of gun control proposals, and enjoyed the endorsement of the NRA Political Victory Fund.

In April 2009, Schweitzer signed into law the Montana Firearms Freedom Act, a bill that attempted to declare guns manufactured and possessed in Montana as exempt from federal gun regulation. This attempted nullification legislation was emulated by several other states, which passed similar legislation, but never went into effect, because the federal courts struck down the law on federal preemption grounds.

During his tenure in office, Schweitzer proposed the introduction of state-level single-payer health care in Montana, based on the Canadian model. Under Schweitzer, Montana opened a government-owned but privately contracted primary care clinic for state employees, but did not succeed in obtaining HHS permission for the state to import prescription drugs from Canada as a cost-savings measure. Schweitzer was critical of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the federal health care reform legislation championed by President Barack Obama, saying it did not go far enough in controlling health-care costs, and describing it as a &quot;corporatist&quot; policy, but did not outright oppose the ACA.

In May 2006, Schweitzer granted posthumous pardons to 78 persons convicted in 1918 and 1919 of sedition during World War I for making comments critical of the war. These were the first posthumous pardons in Montana history. The individuals had been convicted under Montana&#x27;s 1918 Sedition Act (which was subsequently repealed), one of the broadest and harshest of its time: one man went to prison for calling food rationing a joke, while others were targeted because they refused to kiss a U.S. flag or to buy Liberty Bonds. Schweitzer described his pardons as an important reminder of the importance of individual rights in wartime.

Following the suicide of Iraq war veteran Chris Dana in 2007, Schweitzer started the Yellow Ribbon Program, a joint program between the Montana National Guard and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs that helps military personnel returning home from overseas to transition back to civilian life.

In a 2008 biography, Schweitzer expressed support for some form of same-sex civil unions, and in 2013 he expressed support for legal recognition of same-sex marriage.

On foreign policy and national security, Schweitzer took positions to the left of Hillary Clinton. In a series of speeches in Iowa in 2013, Schweitzer criticized Clinton and other Democrats who supported the 2002 Iraq War Resolution and called on Democrats to &quot;keep the Iraq war vote in mind&quot; when nominating a presidential candidate in 2016. Schweitzer also occasionally criticized the Obama administration&#x27;s foreign policy, referring to it as supportive of the &quot;military-industrial complex.&quot; In 2014, Schweitzer expressed opposition to domestic surveillance, asserted that &quot;a lot of people that are working within the CIA and the NSA&quot; of &quot;spying illegally on American citizens,&quot; and called for Edward Snowden to be granted clemency.

==Post-governorship==
The same year Schweitzer completed his term as Montana Governor he was named to the board of directors of Stillwater Mining Company on May 2, and subsequently chosen as non-executive chairman on May 17, 2013.

==Presidential and vice-presidential speculation==
During his gubernatorial tenure, Schweitzer was mentioned by some political pundits as a potential running mate for Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election. Schweitzer spoke in a prime-time slot at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, addressing the topic of American energy independence.

After leaving office at the end of 2012, Schweitzer was mentioned as a possible candidate for president. In February 2013, the &quot;National Journal&quot; reported that he indicated he was leaning towards a run for president in 2016 instead of running for the U.S. Senate in 2014; a Senate bid would have involved challenging Democratic U.S. Senator Max Baucus in a primary election. In April 2013, Baucus decided to retire. Soon thereafter, a Democrat associated with Schweitzer stated that Schweitzer was leaning toward a Senate bid in 2014. After Baucus&#x27; announcement, Schweitzer stated that he was concentrating on helping a dissident investor group take control of the Stillwater Mining Co. in south-central Montana. He subsequently became the chair of the Board of Stillwater Mine. When asked about the Senate race in June 2013, Schweitzer expressed uncertainty; however, Montana political analysts generally believed that he was considering a Senate run.

On July 13, 2013, Schweitzer stated he would not seek the U.S. Senate seat in Montana in 2014. In February 2015, Schweitzer stated that he has &quot;no plans&quot; to run for president in 2016. In October 2015, Schweitzer endorsed former Maryland Governor Martin O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s campaign for the Democratic nomination for president and was named a national co-chair for O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s campaign.

==Personal life==
Schweitzer married Nancy Hupp in 1981. The Schweitzers are the parents of three children: Ben, Khai, and Katrina.

<doc id="1202679" wikidata="Q2320084" url="?curid=1202679" title="Jimmy McMullan">
<text>James McMullan (26 March 1895 – 28 November 1964) was a Scottish football player and manager. He won 16 Scotland caps as a player at half-back and was part of the famous &quot;Wembley Wizards&quot; side of 1928.

==Playing career==
===Early life and Third Lanark===
McMullan was born in Denny, Stirlingshire in 1895. He began his football career with junior side Denny Hibernian in 1911 before graduating to the Scottish League with Third Lanark the next year. Initially considered an inside left, by the time he left in 1913 he was playing predominantly as a left half.

===Partick Thistle and Maidstone United===
He joined &quot;Thirds&quot;&#x27; Glasgow rivals Partick Thistle in 1913. He stayed eight seasons with Thistle but missed out on participating in their Scottish Cup-winning side of 1921 through injury.

In the close season of 1921 McMullan became embroiled in controversy. Partick turned down a £5,000 offer from Newcastle United for his signature and the player, determined to play in English football, signed for non-league Maidstone United as player-manager. He returned to the Glasgow club in the summer of 1923. In February 1926 he eventually earned his long-desired move to the Football League aged 30, when Manchester City signed him for £4,700.

===Manchester City===
McMullan made his debut for his new team in a 1–1 draw with Liverpool on 27 February 1926. Tommy Browell scored the goal for City in that game. Despite containing a number of England players such as Frank Roberts, Billy Austin, Sam Cowan and Tommy Johnson, City finished in twenty-first place in the First Division that season and were relegated into the second division. McMullan played in the 1926 FA Cup Final defeat to Bolton Wanderers. McMullan scored his first goal for Manchester City in a 3–4 defeat to Southampton in the 1926–27 football season. City came third in the second division and were unable to earn promotion. In the 1927–28 football season McMullan helped City into first place in the second division, earning the team promotion. The team had been strengthened by the acquisition of both Eric Brook and Fred Tilson from Barnsley.

McMullan reached an FA Cup final with City again in 1933 but the team were defeated by Everton 3–0. Many of his teammates would be part of the City team which won the FA Cup the following year. However, after 242 League and Cup appearances, McMullan departed Manchester City in May 1933.

===International===
In 1920 he won the first of his sixteen caps for Scotland against Wales in a 1–1 draw in the 1920 British Home Championship, having made unofficial appearances in the years prior during wartime. McMullan is considered to have been the greatest Scottish half-back of his day; he was an ever-present in the 1921 British Home Championship which was won by Scotland.

McMullan helped Scotland to victory in the 1925 British Home Championship and was part of the Scotland team which defeated England 2–0. He was also part of the team which won the 1926 British Home Championship appearing in the 1–0 victory against England at Old Trafford and in the 3–0 victory against Wales at Ninian Park. In the 1927 British Home Championship, McMullan featured twice for Scotland in a 3–0 victory against Wales and a 2–1 defeat to England at Hampden Park. Despite this defeat, Scotland won the championship again that season.

In the 1928 British Home Championship, McMullan captained Scotland as they defeated England 5–1 at Wembley Stadium with a hat-trick from Alex Jackson and a brace from Alex James. As a result of the resounding victory, the Scotland team were dubbed the &quot;Wembley Wizards&quot;. Despite this victory Wales won the championship that season. McMullan captained Scotland to victory the following season in the 1929 British Home Championship.

==Managerial career==
McMullan joined Oldham Athletic as a player-manager in 1933.

After a brief spell there, he was appointed the first-ever manager of Aston Villa in 1934 (before his appointment, the team was selected by a committee). However, the move proved disastrous, resulting in Villa&#x27;s first ever relegation in 1935–36 after 61 years in the top flight.

McMullan later managed Notts County (1936–37) and Sheffield Wednesday (1937–1939). He died on 28 November 1964 (the same day as another former Sheffield Wednesday manager, Billy Walker).

==Legacy==
McMullan is regarded as one of Manchester City&#x27;s best ever players. In 1977, Manchester City Council named eleven streets in a new estate in Moss Side after famous City players including McMullan, Frank Swift, Fred Tilson, Sam Cowan, Horace Barnes, Max Woosnam, Tommy Browell, Eric Brook, Sam Cookson, Billy Meredith and Tommy Johnson.

<doc id="1202680" wikidata="Q94835" url="?curid=1202680" title="Coconut jam">
<text>Coconut jam, also known as kaya jam or simply kaya, is a sweet spread made from a base of coconut milk, eggs, sugar and sometimes pandan leaves as a flavouring. It is popular throughout Southeast Asia.

==Origin==
The origins of kaya are subject to various interpretations. Some sources suggest it is a Eurasian jam unique to Singapore and Malaysia, adapted from a Portuguese egg jam. Others propose that Hainanese immigrants created kaya toast by adapting what they had previously prepared while serving on British ships during the Straits Settlements period. 

In Thailand, a similar spread is known as sangkhaya, while in the Philippines, an eggless version called matamís sa báo is made from coconut cream and sugar. 

The spread&#x27;s widespread popularity across these regions has led to various adaptations and flavors, making kaya a versatile and beloved component of Southeast Asian cuisine.

==Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore==

The word for coconut jam in the Malay language, kaya, means rich, referencing the texture of the popular food. It is also called srikaya. In Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, kaya has a creamy texture. It is made from coconut milk (locally known as &#x27;santan&#x27;) and duck or chicken eggs, flavored with pandan leaves and sweetened with sugar. The resulting color varies depending on the color of the egg yolks, the amount of pandan, and the extent of the caramelization of the sugar. As a popular local spread, kaya is typically spread on toast to make kaya toast and eaten in the morning, but is also enjoyed throughout the day. Kaya can be found in most kopitiam and night markets.

Different varieties available include the nyonya kaya, which is of a lighter-green color, and Hainanese kaya, which is of a darker brown and uses caramelized sugar, and is often further sweetened with honey.

In this region, kaya is also used as a topping for several desserts including &quot;pulut taitai&quot; or &quot;pulut tekan&quot;, a dessert of sweet glutinous rice colored blue with butterfly pea flowers (&quot;bunga telang&quot;), and &quot;pulut seri muka&quot;, a similar dessert but colored green due to adding pandan leaves. It is also used with glutinous rice to make &quot;kuih seri kaya&quot;.

==Philippines==

Philippine coconut jam is known as matamís sa báo (also matamís na báo or minatamís na báo, among other names). The names literally mean &quot;sweetened coconut&quot;. It is different from other Southeast Asian versions in that it uses coconut cream (&quot;kakang gata&quot;, the first and second press of grated coconut meat) and cane sugar extract or molasses (treacle). It also does not use eggs and thus is more like syrup rather than custard. It is often eaten on toast or pandesal or used as a filling for pan de coco. When it is mixed with ground glutinous rice paste, it becomes a popular dessert known as kalamay. 

A less viscous version made with coconut milk (&quot;gata&quot;) is known as &quot;latik&quot; (anglicized as &quot;coconut caramel&quot;), and is used in place of syrup in numerous native Filipino desserts.

==Thailand==
The kaya of Thailand is called sangkhaya (, ) in Thai. There are two major types of kaya eaten in Thailand. One type is more liquid than the other, while the less thick kaya is similar to what is eaten in Malaysia and Indonesia. People either spread it on steamed or toasted bread or dip the bread into kaya. This kind of kaya is commonly sold by street vendors but has recently been brought into tea and coffee shops.

Another type is a concoction that has a less sticky and more custard-like texture. It is sometimes called &quot;coconut custard&quot; in English and is used to make &quot;sangkhaya fakthong&quot; (, ; &quot;sangkhaya maryu&quot; in Lao), sangkhaya pumpkin or custard pumpkin, &quot;khao niao sangkhaya&quot; (, ), glutinous rice topped with sangkhaya, and &quot;sangkhaya maphrao&quot; (, ), sangkhaya served in a coconut.

==Samoa==
Coconut jam is known in Samoa as siamu popo. The word &quot;siamu&quot; in Samoan is loaned from English &quot;jam&quot; and &quot;popo&quot; refers to a mature coconut that is used for eating, usually for the extraction of coconut cream. The preparation of &quot;siamu popo&quot; doesn’t require eggs, the sugar is caramelised and coconut cream and citrus leaves are added. It has a consistency resembling a mixture of syrup and caramel. &quot;Siamu popo&quot; is often used as a spread on toast and is used in desserts, most often used as a filling for a doughnut called german bun.

<doc id="1202681" wikidata="Q764909" url="?curid=1202681" title="Thor-Able">
<text>The Thor-Able was an American expendable launch system used for a series of re-entry vehicle tests and spacecraft launches between 1958 and 1960. 

It was a two-stage rocket, consisting of a Thor IRBM as a first stage and a Vanguard-derived Able second stage. For satellite or space probe launches, an Altair solid rocket motor was added as a third stage. It was a member of the Thor family and an early predecessor of the Delta. 

The Able upper stage name represents its place as the first in the series, from the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet.

==Launches==
Sixteen Thor-Able were launched, nine on sub-orbital re-entry vehicle test flights, four on probe and three on orbital satellite launch attempts. Six of the launches resulted in failures, in which three of those were the result of the additional Altair upper stage, added to the rocket to allow it to launch spacecraft beyond a sub-orbital trajectory. All sixteen launches occurred from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 17A.

==Airframes==
The Thor-Able vehicle had a stronger airframe than the standard Thor IRBM and had the inertial guidance system replaced by a radio guidance package mounted on the Able stages. It saw its first test on 23 April 1958 when Thor-Able 116 was launched from LC-17A with a biological nose cone containing a mouse named MIA (Mouse In Able). At 19:10 EST, the Thor&#x27;s engine ignited and drove the Able stage and its passenger into the sky. Two minutes and fifteen seconds after launch, at an altitude of 50 miles (80 km), the Thor exploded and sent the hapless rodent into the Atlantic Ocean instead of space. The cause of the failure was traced to a turbopump bearing coming loose and resulting in pump shutdown and instant loss of thrust. With no attitude control, the Thor pitched down and its LOX tank ruptured from aerodynamic loads. On 9 July, Thor-Able 118 lifted off for a second attempt with a mouse named MIA II. The booster, including the unproven Able stage, performed successfully and the biological nose cone was driven back into the atmosphere for a splashdown in the South Atlantic, but recovery crews failed to locate the capsule and it sank into the ocean. A third attempt was made on 23 July. The press refused to call the mouse by the name of MIA III, so she was instead christened &quot;Wickie&quot;, after a local female news reporter who had covered the space program at Cape Canaveral. Unfortunately, Wickie was no luckier than her predecessors when recovery crews once again failed to locate the capsule after splashdown, but telemetry data confirmed the mouse&#x27;s survival from liftoff through reentry and proved comprehensively that living organisms could survive space travel. 

Attention now turned to Thor-Able 127 and Pioneer 0, the world&#x27;s first lunar probe. This flight took place on 17 August, but ended embarrassingly when the Thor exploded 77 seconds into the launch due to another turbopump malfunction. After an Atlas missile test a month later also failed due to the turbopumps, the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division quickly replaced the pumps in all of their missiles and this problem did not repeat itself again.

On 10 October, Pioneer 1 was launched on Thor-Able 130. The second stage shut down too early and the probe did not have sufficient velocity to escape Earth&#x27;s gravity. It re-entered the atmosphere and burned up 43 hours after launch.

Pioneer 2 was launched on 8 November (Thor-Able 129) and reentered the atmosphere less than an hour after launch when the third stage failed to ignite.

The next six Thor-Able flights were suborbital tests for the Air Force (23 January, 28 February, 21 March, 8 April, 20 May, and 11 June 1959). All of these were successful except the first one, which failed to stage due to an electrical problem and fell into the Atlantic Ocean.

On 7 August, Explorer 6 (a scientific satellite) was launched on Thor-Able 134 and successfully orbited.

On 17 September, Transit 1A on Thor-Able 136 failed to orbit due to the third stage again failing to ignite.

On 3 November, Pioneer 5 was successfully launched on Thor-Able 219. Intended originally as a Venus probe, technical delays caused it to be launched after the 1959 Venus window had closed so that it was instead sent into a heliocentric orbit.

The final Thor-Able launch was Thor-Able 148, orbiting Tiros-1 on 1 April 1960.

<text>Jill Crossland is an English pianist, born in Yorkshire. She studied with Ryszard Bakst (a Heinrich Neuhaus pupil) at Chetham&#x27;s School of Music and the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, and with Paul Badura-Skoda in Vienna. She has a preference for Baroque and Classical periods of the repertoire, with a focus on the music by Johann Sebastian Bach, playing it on the piano. She has performed his &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; from memory since her student years.

Crossland made her Wigmore Hall solo debut in 2004. She recorded in 2003 Bach&#x27;s English Suite No 2, BWV 807, Partita No 1, BWV 825, and his Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue, BWV 903. She also recorded his Goldberg Variations, and piano sonatas by Mozart and Beethoven. In 2005, she recorded works by Bach, Handel and Scarlatti on a historic fortepiano, built by Jirikowsky in 1824, at Restoration House in Rochester. She recorded Parts I and II of the &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;, and a reviewer of &quot;Gramophone&quot; noted in 2008 the &quot;warm, rounded and perpetually singing sonority&quot; of her playing.He described her approach as &quot;intimately scaled and sensitively nuanced&quot;.

<text>New Zealand photography first emerged in the mid-nineteenth century, and over time has become an important part of New Zealand art. A number of photography associations exist to support photographers in New Zealand.

==Origins of New Zealand photography==
New Zealand photography began in the mid-19th century when photographers first documented the country&#x27;s natural beauty and people. The first photographs of the world-famous Pink and White Terraces were taken in 1859 by Bruno Hamel on Ferdinand Hochstetter&#x27;s expedition. Local photographers embellished, staged and sometimes faked early tourist prints to ensure sales. Alfred Burton, of the Dunedin Burton Brothers, also travelled through many of the Pacific islands near New Zealand with the P&amp;O Shipping line, in the early days of tourism through the region. The photographic collections at Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, the national museum, hold many of the surviving images from this era, including images by Thomas Andrew, Leslie Adkin, James Bragge, Leslie Hinge and Spencer Digby in addition to archives of the Burton Brothers, Alfred James Tattersall and John McGarrigle&#x27;s American Photographic Company. The Alexander Turnbull Library in Wellington also hosts a significant catalogue of historic images, many of which can be viewed online and browsed by location, name, and more. The seminal development history of New Zealand photography was written by medical photographer and historian Hardwicke Knight in 1971. Archives New Zealand hold photos from government departments such as the National Publicity Studios and some individuals employed by government such as Leslie Hinge.

George D. Valentine was a Scottish photographer, who relocated to New Zealand due to his health, and documented much of the country at a time of great transition – his images of the Pink and White Terraces, taken in 1885, show scenes of incredible beauty that were buried less than a year later by 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera. An exhibition of his work was mounted by the Christchurch Art Gallery in 2004.

==Contemporary photography==
Contemporary New Zealand photographers include Laurence Aberhart, Mark Adams, Brian Brake, Ben Cauchi, Marti Friedlander, Anne Geddes, Anne Noble, Fiona Pardington, Patrick Reynolds, Yvonne Todd, Christine Webster, Rita Dibert, Yvonne Westra and Ans Westra. Luit Bieringa has curated a number of influential New Zealand photography exhibitions.

==Photography associations==
The New Zealand Institute of Professional Photography has a membership of 250 professional photographers, and the Advertising &amp; Illustrative Photographers Association comprises another hundred or more.

Many amateur and professional New Zealand photographers are members of PhotoForum NZ, a non-profit society that publishes &quot;PhotoForum&quot; magazine, organises exhibitions, workshops and lectures, and maintains a website.

The Photographic Society of New Zealand is also a popular group for amateurs, representing camera clubs throughout the country.

New Zealand has two locally produced publications for the photographic community: &quot;The Photographer&#x27;s Mail&quot; (focuses on the professional and industry) and &quot;D-Photo&quot; (focuses on the consumer and enthusiast).

<doc id="1202690" wikidata="Q3306117" url="?curid=1202690" title="Vahan Tekeyan">
<text>Vahan Tekeyan (; January 21, 1878 – April 4, 1945) was an Armenian poet and public activist. In his lifetime he was the most famous poet of the Armenian diaspora, and he remains a significant symbol of Armenian identity and cultural heritage.

==Early life and education==
Born in the Ortaköy district of Constantinople, Tekeyan attended primary education in that neighborhood. He attended the Nersisyan School, the Berberian School, and Getronagan Armenian High School.

==Career==
Beginning in 1896, he worked as trading official, a job that involved a good deal of travel in Europe. He worked for a time as a newspaper editor in Beirut and, later, in Cairo. He also worked as a teacher and became involved in political and social activism.

In addition, he began to write and publish poetry. His first collection of poems, &quot;The Wonders&quot;, was published in Paris in 1901. From his base in Cairo, he wrote frequently for Armenian periodicals in the West, and in 1905 he founded the periodical Shirak, which published the work of many writers in the Armenian diaspora.

After the collapse of the dictatorial regime of Abdul Hamid II, the sultan of the Ottoman Empire, in 1909, Tekeyan moved from Cairo to Constantinople, where he continued to publish &quot;Shirak&quot; and became an established public figure in Constantinople. When the First World War began in 1914, Tekeyan happened to be in Egypt, which enabled him to escape the bloodshed. Eventually, however, he did return to Constantinople, where he edited a newspaper, &quot;Voice of the People&quot;, then served as director of the Central School. Political tumult in Constantinople ultimately drove him back to Egypt, where he edited the daily newspaper &quot;Arev&quot; until the end of his life.

Tekeyan&#x27;s poems include: &quot;The Armenian Church&quot;, &quot;A Prayer on the Eve of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Your Memory Tonight&quot;, &quot;When the Day Finally Comes&quot;, and &quot;Your Name&quot;.

His later collections of poetry include &quot;The Wonderful Renaissance&quot; (1914), &quot;Midnight to the Dawn&quot; (1919), &quot;Love&quot; (1933), &quot;Hayerghutyun&quot; (1943), and &quot;Tagharan&quot; (1944). He also translated works by Shakespeare, Victor Hugo, and Oscar Wilde into Armenian.

He died in 1945 in Cairo, where he is buried at the Armenian cemetery.

==Legacy==
He has been called the &quot;Prince of Armenian Poetry.&quot; Tekeyan&#x27;s themes in poetry revolved mostly around love, such as compassionate love, love for one&#x27;s homeland, or love for humanity.

Another Armenian intellectual and poet, Vahe Vahian, was heavily influenced by Vahan Tekeyan&#x27;s work, from where his pen name came from.

His complete works, in nine volumes, were published in Cairo in 1949–50. Volumes of selected works were issued in Beirut in 1954 and in Yerevan in 1970. A collection of his letters was published in Los Angeles in 1983.

The Tekeyan Cultural Association was founded in 1947 in Beirut, and now has branches around the world.

<text>Joseph Anthony Fatone Jr. (born January 28, 1977) is an American singer, dancer, actor, and television host. He is best known as a member of the boy band NSYNC, in which he sings baritone. The band has sold over 70 million records, becoming one of the best-selling boy bands of all time.

In 2007, he came in second place on the ABC reality show &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He was the host of the U.S. and Australian versions of &quot;The Singing Bee&quot;, which aired on NBC in the United States. Fatone was the announcer for the game show &quot;Family Feud&quot; from 2010 to 2015. Fatone has hosted on Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Rewrapped&quot;, Game Show Network&#x27;s &quot;Common Knowledge,&quot; Live Well Network&#x27;s &quot;My Family Recipe Rocks&quot;, &quot;The Price Is Right Live!&quot; at Bally&#x27;s Las Vegas; and appeared as &quot;Rabbit&quot; on the first season of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; in 2019.

==Early life and education==
Fatone was born in Brooklyn, New York City, to Joe and Phyllis Fatone. He has a brother, Steven, and a sister, Janine, and was raised at 2140 84th Street in the Bensonhurst neighborhood. His father had sung in a doo-wop group called the Orions. At 13, he moved with his family to Orlando, Florida, where he attended Dr. Phillips High School. 

==Career==
===NSYNC===

After high school, Fatone played &quot;Wolfie&quot; in &quot;Beetlejuice&#x27;s Rock and Roll Graveyard Revue&quot; at Universal Studios Florida in Orlando. There, in the summer of 1995, he befriended fellow park performer Chris Kirkpatrick who recruited him as the fourth member of a new vocal group that included Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez. They were later joined by Lance Bass and the band NSYNC was formed. Fatone sang baritone with the band from their formation to 2002, when they went on an indefinite hiatus, during which time they sold more than 70 million records worldwide. He performed lead vocals on the single &quot;Together Again&quot; and the &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; album track &quot;I Thought She Knew&quot;. While a member of NSYNC, Fatone co-starred with bandmate Bass in the 2001 romantic comedy film &quot;On the Line&quot; and guest-starred with the band on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode, &quot;New Kids on the Blecch&quot;.

On August 25, 2013, NSYNC regrouped for a one-off performance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. They performed a medley of &quot;Girlfriend&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye Bye&quot;; after the performance Lance Bass said that the group had no plans for a reunion tour or new music. In April 2019 the band reunited without Timberlake for a one-off performance with Ariana Grande at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. NSYNC have long been subject to speculation of a reunion, to which Fatone has given the answer: &quot;Never say never&quot;.

On September 12, 2023, following weeks of teasers and speculation regarding a potential reunion, all five members appeared together at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards to present the Best Pop Award. On September 14, it was confirmed the group recorded a new song entitled &quot;Better Place&quot; for the DreamWorks Animation film &quot;Trolls Band Together&quot;. The song was released on September 29, 2023, reaching No. 1 on the US and Canadian iTunes Charts, No. 4 on the Global and European iTunes Charts and No. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In the wake of the new single&#x27;s release, Fatone said there were no immediate plans for more music from NSYNC, but the band could release a new album within the next two years, subject to the success of &quot;Better Place&quot; and the involvement of Timberlake.

===Acting===
In 2002 Fatone played Cousin Angelo in the comedy film &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot;, a role he reprised in the TV spin-off &quot;My Big Fat Greek Life&quot; and the 2016 sequel. In the same year he made his Broadway debut, playing the lead in &quot;Rent&quot; at the Nederlander Theatre in New York. He went on to act in the critically acclaimed movie &quot;The Cooler&quot; and had minor roles in the experimental film &quot;Red Riding Hood&quot; and &quot;Homie Spumoni&quot;, the latter alongside Jamie-Lynn Sigler. He returned to Broadway in 2004 in a revival of &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; and later appeared in productions of &quot;The Producers&quot; and &quot;42nd Street&quot; in Pittsburgh and &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; at Bally&#x27;s Las Vegas.

Fatone played himself in the kung fu skit &quot;Enter the Fat One&quot; in the first season of &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, later making more appearances on the show including the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; episode. He also played himself in the Syfy film &quot;Jersey Shore Shark Attack&quot;, the TV series &quot;Return of the Mac&quot; and the Comedy Central feature &quot;Cursed Friends&quot;. Fatone has guest-starred in the Disney Channel series &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;, &quot;Imagination Movers&quot; and &quot;Kim Possible&quot; in addition to various other TV shows and horror films, including &quot;Inkubus&quot; (2011) and &quot;Dead 7&quot; (2016).

===Presenting===
Fatone was the &quot;ringmaster&quot; for NBC&#x27;s reality series Celebrity Circus in 2005. In 2007 he hosted NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Singing Bee&quot; and the Australian version of the show on Nine Network. The same year he became a red carpet host for TV Guide along with Lisa Rinna. In 2009 Fatone co-hosted the live pre-show for TNA Wrestling&#x27;s biggest annual pay-per-view event, TNA Bound for Glory, alongside Jeremy Borash.

From 2010 to 2015, Fatone served as the announcer for host Steve Harvey on the show &quot;Family Feud&quot;. At the same time he hosted the Live Well Network series &quot;My Family Recipe Rocks&quot;, the Food Network cooking competition &quot;Rewrapped&quot;, and &quot;Parents Just Don&#x27;t Understand&quot; series on the Hub Network. He also was a celebrity guest host of &quot;The Price Is Right Live!&quot; at Bally&#x27;s Las Vegas. In January 2012, Fatone was one of eight celebrities participating in the Food Network reality series &quot;Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off&quot;. Though eliminated in week six, he secured a $5,000 award for his charity, the Fatone Family Foundation.

In February 2014 Fatone made an appearance on the hidden camera show &quot;Impractical Jokers&quot;, standing in for show regular Brian Quinn, during a challenge. He made repeat appearances on the show as host or featured guest in a number of specials, including a 2017 episode based at his Orlando hot dog restaurant, Fat One&#x27;s. Fatone is the permanent host of the spin-off series &quot;Impractical Jokers: After Party&quot; and he made a cameo in &quot;Impractical Jokers: The Movie&quot; in 2020.

Fatone portrayed &quot;Rabbit&quot; on the first season of the singing competition show &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;, tying with Rumer Willis as &quot;Lion&quot; for fourth place overall. Currently he is presenter of the game show &quot;Common Knowledge&quot;, which premiered on January 14, 2019, on the Game Show Network. In 2021 he served as a panelist on the Irish talent show &quot;Last Singer Standing&quot;.

===&quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;===
On February 1, 2007, the ABC television network announced that Fatone would participate in season 4 of the American version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, which debuted March 19, 2007. He ended up placing second, losing the mirror ball to Apolo Anton Ohno and Julianne Hough. He competed with professional partner Kym Johnson. Fatone participated in the 15th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; for a second chance to win a mirror ball trophy, again dancing with Kym Johnson. They were the second couple eliminated. He later returned in season 27 during Trio Week as a trio partner to John Schneider and Emma Slater.

In February 2013, Fatone appeared on Holland America Line&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars at Sea&quot;, aboard the MS &quot;Eurodam&quot;. He returned to Dancing with the Stars at Sea on Holland America Line&#x27;s MS &quot;Nieuw Amsterdam&quot; in January 2014. He was paired with Lacey Schwimmer and appeared alongside Mark Ballas, Sabrina Bryan, and a dance ensemble. Unlike the TV show, this was not a competition and there were no eliminations.

==Personal life==
Fatone met his wife, Kelly Baldwin, while they were still in high school in 1993. After joining NSYNC two years later, their relationship was off-and-on.

It was a much speculated rumor that Fatone had briefly dated singer Pink in early 2000, to which Pink stated, &quot;[Joey] took me to Friendly&#x27;s as a casual date, not like a date-date. I just wanted ice cream. We were in the friend zone.&quot; The singer has stated that although they did technically go on a date, it was more platonic and that Fatone was &quot;a total sweetheart.&quot;

After rekindling his romance with Baldwin shortly after the same year, she became pregnant in the spring of 2000 with their first child, Briahna, who was born exactly a year after the release of NSYNC&#x27;s hit sophomore album, &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;. They became engaged in the fall of 2002.

On September 9, 2004, Fatone married Baldwin at Oheka Castle on Long Island, New York, in a ceremony that was attended by all his NSYNC bandmates. Fatone and his wife have two daughters: Briahna Joely, born March 21, 2001, and Kloey, born January 2010. Fatone&#x27;s best friend, Lance Bass, is their godfather.

<text>David Todd Rawlings (born December 30, 1969) is an American guitarist, singer, and record producer. He is known for his partnership with singer and songwriter Gillian Welch. He and Welch were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 91st Academy Awards for &quot;When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings&quot; from &quot;The Ballad of Buster Scruggs&quot;. In 2020, Welch and Rawlings released &quot;All the Good Times (Are Past &amp; Gone)&quot;, which won the 2021 Grammy Award for Best Folk Album. In 2024, Welch and Rawlings released &quot;Woodland&quot;, which won the 2025 Grammy Award for Best Folk Album, currently making Welch and Rawlings the only duo to win the award more than once. 

== Life and career ==
Rawlings attended the Berklee College of Music and studied with Lauren Passarelli. He produced albums by Gillian Welch, Willie Watson, Dawes, and Old Crow Medicine Show. In the mid-2010s he led a band called the Dave Rawlings Machine, composed of Rawlings, Gillian Welch, Willie Watson, Paul Kowert, and Brittany Haas. John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin has been known to play mandolin with the band occasionally. Rawlings contributed to the albums &quot;Cassadaga&quot; by Bright Eyes, &quot;Spooked&quot; by Robyn Hitchcock, and &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; by Ryan Adams, with whom he wrote two songs, &quot;To Be Young (Is to Be Sad, Is to Be High)&quot; and &quot;Touch, Feel and Lose&quot;. His vocal style has often been compared to that of Bob Dylan.

== Recordings ==
=== &quot;A Friend of a Friend&quot; (2009) ===
The Dave Rawlings Machine album &quot;A Friend of a Friend&quot; was released on November 17, 2009. Rawlings recorded the album in Nashville, and produced it himself. Gillian Welch is credited as a co-writer on five of the album&#x27;s songs as well playing in the band with members of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Old Crow Medicine Show, and Bright Eyes. The album features a medley of a Neil Young and Bright Eyes song, as well as songs Rawlings co-wrote with Ryan Adams and Old Crow Medicine Show. Morgan Nagler (of the band Whispertown) is credited with co-writing the song &quot;Sweet Tooth&quot;.

=== &quot;Nashville Obsolete&quot; (2015) ===
In 2015 Dave Rawlings Machine released a second album, &quot;Nashville Obsolete&quot;. The album was named to Rolling Stone&#x27;s list of the top 40 country albums of 2016. In late 2016 Acony issued &quot;Boots No 1: The Official Revival Bootleg&quot;, a deluxe version of the 1996 Welch album considered a &quot;modern Americana classic&quot; and the first collaboration for the duo.

=== &quot;Poor David&#x27;s Almanack&quot; (2017) ===
&quot;Poor David&#x27;s Almanack&quot;, released on August 11, 2017, via Acony Records, is the eighth collaborative LP for Rawlings and Welch and the first under the name David Rawlings. In addition to Welch and Watson, the backup band includes Brittany Haas, Paul Kowert, Ketch Secor of Old Crow Medicine Show, and Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith of Dawes. The album was recorded with Ken Scott and Matt Andrews at the Rawlings/Welch duo&#x27;s Woodland Sound Studios in Nashville. The album features an original woodcut piece by Gillian Welch on the cover and was notably the first vinyl release on Welch and Rawlings&#x27; Acony record label.

&quot;Cumberland Gap&quot; was used as the opening song to Guy Richie&#x27;s 2019 film, &quot;The Gentlemen&quot;. It was nominated for Best American Roots Song at the 2018 Grammy Awards.

=== &quot;All the Good Times (Are Past and Gone)&quot; (2020) ===
In July 2020, Rawlings and Welch announced &quot;All the Good Times (Are Past &amp; Gone)&quot;, an album of covers and traditional songs recorded at their home during the COVID-19 lockdowns of 2020. &quot;All the Good Times&quot; is notably the first album in their decades-long history of collaboration to be released jointly in both of their names. The album won the 2021 Grammy Award for Best Folk Album.

== Instrument ==
Rawlings achieves his signature guitar sound flatpicking a small archtop guitar. The 1935 Epiphone Olympic that has been his primary instrument was a mid-priced guitar for its time, with a carved arched solid sprucewood top, carved arched solid mahogany back and mahogany sides. It sold for about $35 in 1935 (). The guitar&#x27;s lower bout measures 13 5/8 inches wide, and it has three piece f-holes.

Rawlings &quot;scavenged&quot; the guitar from a friend&#x27;s garage and is now hardly seen playing anything else. As he states, &quot;I just picked it up. It was filthy, and it didn&#x27;t have strings. You could just see the shape of it under the sawdust.&quot; Rawlings had a new one piece bridge made for it and brought it to a recording session for Welch&#x27;s first record. &quot;As soon as I heard it through the microphone and through the speakers I was like, &#x27;I love this guitar&#x27;.&quot; he says.

<text>The Watson ministry (Labour) was the 3rd ministry of the Government of Australia, and the first national Labour government formed in the world. It was led by the country&#x27;s 3rd Prime Minister, Chris Watson. The Watson ministry succeeded the First Deakin ministry, which dissolved on 27 April 1904 after Labour withdrew their support and Alfred Deakin was forced to resign. The ministry was replaced by the Reid ministry on 17 August 1904 after the Protectionist Party withdrew their support over the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill.

Billy Hughes, who died in 1952, was the last surviving member of the Watson ministry; Hughes was also the last surviving member of the First Fisher ministry, Third Fisher ministry, Second Hughes ministry and Third Hughes ministry.

<text>The Reid ministry (Free Trade) was the 4th ministry of the Government of Australia. It was led by the country&#x27;s 4th Prime Minister, George Reid. The Reid ministry succeeded the Watson ministry, which dissolved on 17 August 1904 after the Protectionist Party withdrew their support and Chris Watson was forced to resign. Due to having to rely on the Protectionists to retain office, half of the ministry was forced to accommodate conservative Protectionists - leading to the government to sometimes be referred to as the Reid-McLean Ministry. The ministry was replaced by the Second Deakin ministry on 5 July 1905 after the Protectionists withdrew their support and returned to office with the support of the Labour Party.

James Drake, who died in 1941, was the last surviving member of the Reid ministry; Drake was also the last surviving minister of the Barton government and the First Deakin ministry. Sir Josiah Symon was the last surviving Free Trade minister.

<doc id="1202706" wikidata="Q2703030" url="?curid=1202706" title="Kilsby">
<text>Kilsby is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire, England. It is situated a short distance south of the border with Warwickshire approximately five miles southeast of Rugby. The parish of Kilsby, which includes Barby Nortoft, was estimated to have a population of 1,268 in 2020.

==History==
Kilsby&#x27;s name comes from Anglo-Saxon + old Norse , literally meaning &quot;child&#x27;s dwelling&quot;, but &quot;child&quot; here probably means &quot;young nobleman&quot;. Its church, St Faith&#x27;s, may originally have been the daughter chapel of the neighbouring parish of Barby.

The parish&#x27;s eastern side is bounded by the old route of the Roman Watling Street, and the village itself is sited on the crossing of two former mediaeval drove-routes.

One of the earliest armed confrontations of the English Civil War took place at Kilsby in August 1642: The Royalist Captain Sir John Smith led a group of soldiers to disarm the villagers, after the news was heard that they were Parliamentarian supporters. The villagers put up resistance, and in the ensuing fight, several villagers were killed.

Kilsby gives its name to the Kilsby Tunnel; a railway tunnel on the West Coast Main Line. The construction of the tunnel between 1835 and 1838 caused considerable disruption to the village, as more than 1,200 navvies lived in a shanty town on the edge of the village, using 200 horses and thirteen steam engines to construct it. The navvies were known for their heavy drinking in the local inns, and on one occasion, troops from the nearby Weedon barracks were called in to quell a riot. The tunnel measures 1 mile 666 yards (2,216 m).

&quot;Kilsby Jones&quot; is the name by which James Rhys Jones is usually known. He was a Welsh congregationalist minister and writer in Kilsby from 1840 to about 1850, when he moved to Birmingham.

The village has grown moderately since the 1960s, with a mix of new housing developments and a degree of in-filling. It retains a historic core of attractive buildings including some fine examples of Northamptonshire rubble stone construction, and a number of thatched properties. A Conservation area was designated in the village in 2018, and many of the village&#x27;s more attractive properties are listed for their historic interest.

==Landmarks and amenities==

Amenities in the village include an Ofsted &quot;Good&quot; rated primary school, two pubs, The Red Lion and The George and two churches - Church of England and URC.

The Village also has a volunteer-run, community-owned shop in the car park of the Red Lion pub. This warm community spirit is also evident in a number of thriving community groups, including Womans Institute, Brownies, Girl Guides, as well as a good neighbour community support scheme born out of the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown and the Kilsby Kronicle village newspaper.

The two 1830s ventilation shafts of the Kilsby Tunnel designed by Robert Stephenson are topped with circular crenelated turrets. These structures, visible from the A5 road, are listed buildings.

==Transport==
The village is circa 10 minutes from both Long Buckby and Rugby stations, the latter offering direct services into London Euston in 49 minutes. Between 1881 and 1960, the village used to have a railway station Kilsby and Crick station but this was on the Northampton Loop about a mile (1.5 km) from the village.

One of the village&#x27;s more unusual claims to fame is that the A361 road terminates here at a junction with the A5. The A361 runs to Ilfracombe in Devon making it the longest &#x27;three-digit&#x27; road in Britain. A consequence of these roads is that the majority of through traffic bypasses the heart of the village ensuring the main road through the village is relatively quiet.

==Notable residents==
Frank Whittle briefly lived at &#x27;Laurelcroft&#x27;, 1 North Street, until 1949.

<text>The Third Deakin ministry (Liberal) was the 7th ministry of the Government of Australia. It was led by the country&#x27;s 2nd Prime Minister, Alfred Deakin. The Fourth Deakin ministry succeeded the First Fisher ministry, which dissolved on 2 June 1909 after the Protectionist Party and the Anti-Socialist Party merged into the Liberal Party &quot;fusion&quot; and withdrew their support in order to form what became the first majority government in federal Australian history. The ministry was replaced by the Second Fisher ministry on 29 April 1910 following the federal election that took place on 13 April which saw the Labour Party defeat the Liberals.

Joseph Cook, who died in 1947, was the last surviving member of the Third Deakin ministry.

<doc id="1202712" wikidata="Q2140849" url="?curid=1202712" title="Mark 81 bomb">
<text>The Mark 81 is a general-purpose bomb (nicknamed &quot;Firecracker&quot;). It&#x27;s the smallest of the Mark 80 series of low-drag general-purpose bombs.

==Development and deployment==
Developed for United States military forces in the 1950s, it was first used during the Vietnam War. The bomb consists of a forged steel case with of Composition H6, Minol or Tritonal explosive. The power of the Mk 81 was found to be inadequate for U.S. military tactical use, and it was quickly discontinued, although license-built copies or duplicates of this weapon remain in service with various other nations.

Development of a precision guided variant of the Mk 81 bomb (GBU-29) was started due to its potential to reduce collateral damage compared to larger bombs, but this program has now been cancelled in favor of the Small Diameter Bomb.

==Variants==
*Mark 81 Snakeye fitted with a Mark 14 TRD (Tail Retarding Device) to increase the bomb&#x27;s drag after release. The bomb&#x27;s increased air-time, coupled with its (relatively) forgiving safe drop envelope, allowed for very low-level bombing runs at slower speed. Used commonly in the close air support role in Vietnam (prior to wider availability of GBU-series precision ordnance). Nicknamed &quot;snake&quot;, as in the typical Vietnam support loadout of &quot;snake and nape&quot; (250 lb Mk 81 Snakeye bombs and 500 lb M-47 napalm canisters).
*GBU-29 Joint Direct Attack Munition, a precision guided version of the Mark 81 (cancelled).

<doc id="1202713" wikidata="Q2026055" url="?curid=1202713" title="Bonnie McKee">
<text>Bonnie Leigh McKee (born January 20, 1984) is an American singer and songwriter. Her debut album &quot;Trouble&quot; was released in 2004 by Reprise Records. After being dropped, she took a musical hiatus and established herself as a songwriter. She has written 10 singles that have reached number one in either the United States or the United Kingdom, which have sold more than 30 million copies worldwide combined. In 2013, she made a return to music with the single &quot;American Girl&quot;. In 2015, she independently released the EP &quot;Bombastic&quot;.

In 2024, after 11 years of anticipation by her fans expressed on social media and internet forums, she released a rerecorded version of what was meant to be her second LP, &quot;Hot City&quot;, originally supposed to be released through Epic Records, but, after several delays, her label cancelled it. Right after the cancellation of her album, some tracks meant to be featured on it leaked on the internet, and since then have been cherished by her fans, prompting McKee to rerecord them, after getting inspired over the Taylor Swift masters dispute, then dropping several tracks originally meant for her shelved 2013 album as singles from mid-2023 to early 2024, and finally independently releasing the 16-track album on music streaming platforms.

McKee is particularly known for collaborating with singer Katy Perry. The duo wrote &quot;California Gurls&quot;, &quot;Teenage Dream&quot;, &quot;Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)&quot;, &quot;Part of Me&quot;, &quot;Wide Awake&quot;, and &quot;Roar&quot;. McKee also co-wrote &quot;Dynamite&quot; by Taio Cruz, which became the second-best-selling song by a British artist in the digital era. McKee co-wrote other songs including &quot;Hold It Against Me&quot; by Britney Spears and &quot;C&#x27;Mon&quot; by Kesha. She additionally has written for Cher, Christina Aguilera, Kelly Clarkson, and Adam Lambert. McKee also has collaborated with Canadian acapella singer Mike Tompkins.

==Early life==

McKee was born in Vacaville, California, and raised in Seattle. She studied classical piano and became a member of the Seattle Girls Choir Prime Voci at age 12; she toured with the choir throughout North America and Europe. She recorded two albums with the choir, titled &quot;Jackson Berkey Meets The Seattle Girls&#x27; Choir&quot; and &quot;Cantate 2000&quot;. She briefly attended The Bush School during her freshman year of high school, where she recorded a demo album with other student musicians as part of an experiential class project with The President’s musician Dave Dederer, an alumnus and former English teacher at the school; unrelatedly, she was kicked out soon afterward. At age 12, McKee&#x27;s mother gave a demonstration CD featuring her singing Bette Midler and Fiona Apple songs to a friend of hers who is the co-founder of the Sub Pop label, Jonathan Poneman. Poneman was intrigued by her songwriting talents. According to McKee, this was the moment when she realized she had to be &quot;more than just a singer.&quot; She knew she had to be a songwriter as well.

==Career==
===2004–2005: Career beginnings and &quot;Trouble&quot;===

McKee wrote songs and performed in the Seattle area when she was 15. Her demo tape which was raw got to Colin Filkow, an ex-Priority Records label executive. Filkow recognized that she was a rare talent and signed her to his management company, Platinum Partners Artist Management in Beverly Hills. He flew her to Los Angeles and welcomed her into his family; she was only 17 at the time. He inspired her to sing and write songs and to trust her instincts. Filkow took Bonnie&#x27;s demo to dozens of labels, publishers, agents, and entertainment lawyers. After more than a year, Filkow signed Bonnie to Warner Bros. Records in one of the most lucrative signings ever for a new artist.

Her debut album &quot;Trouble&quot; was recorded across a period of two years by producers Bob Power and Rob Cavallo, and commercially released on September 28, 2004. Reprise Records was unsure on how to sell McKee, so the label settled a partnership with internet radio website LAUNCHcast, which would promote the lead single &quot;Somebody&quot;. &quot;Somebody&quot; soon became one of the most played tracks on the website, and its popularity with young females led to a strategy where McKee would be a subversive alternative to the teen pop demographic. &quot;Somebody&quot; was performed on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, included in the motion picture &quot;Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!&quot;, and had a music video featured on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Buzzworthy&quot; and VH1&#x27;s &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;. &quot;Trouble&quot; received positive reviews in &quot;Blender&quot;, &quot;Nylon&quot;, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, and &quot;Teen People&quot;, but was commercially unsuccessful. McKee spoke about the album being unsuccessful, saying, &quot;It was devastating when the album didn&#x27;t happen,&quot; she said. &quot;I realized there are so many steps from getting a deal to having a hit... and I didn&#x27;t get there. It was a huge letdown.&quot; McKee began work on a second studio album which never came to existence. According to McKee, she &quot;downward-spiraled&quot; and began to abuse crystal meth, an addiction with which she struggled for several years. She was dropped from the label after defacing the CEO&#x27;s car with lipstick during the middle of the night.

===2006–2013: Songwriting and Epic records releases===

Following her release from Reprise Records, McKee managed to get a job at Pulse Recordings&#x27; publishing arm, Check Your Pulse, through her boyfriend and longtime collaborator, Oliver &quot;Oligee&quot; Goldstein. She lived in poverty, without hot water, a cell phone, or a car while spending many hours in the recording studio, learning how to use Pro Tools and crafting new songs alongside Elliott Yamin and Leighton Meester. In 2009, McKee was introduced to music producer Dr. Luke by her manager Josh Abraham, who signed her to his production label Prescription Songs. Dr. Luke had collaborated with McKee&#x27;s longtime friend Katy Perry on her second album &quot;One of the Boys&quot;. About this time, Perry expressed interest in having &quot;a co-writer I could volley with&quot;, adding that &quot;Bonnie and I are on the same zeitgeist tip.&quot;

Perry and McKee (along with Max Martin and Benny Blanco) began writing songs, eventually producing the hits that would appear on Perry&#x27;s third album, &quot;Teenage Dream&quot;. McKee co-wrote three singles from the album, &quot;California Gurls&quot;, &quot;Teenage Dream&quot;, and &quot;Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)&quot;, the last of which was inspired by McKee and Perry&#x27;s misadventures in their teenage years. Each of the singles topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and they earned McKee several BMI Pop Awards in 2011 and 2012 for her role as a songwriter. McKee also co-wrote two more chart-toppers for Perry, &quot;Part of Me&quot; and &quot;Roar&quot; as well as four other songs which hit number one on either the Hot 100 or the UK Singles Chart, Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;Hold It Against Me&quot;, Taio Cruz&#x27;s &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Rita Ora&#x27;s &quot;How We Do (Party)&quot;, and Cheryl&#x27;s &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot;. On June 22, 2017, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) announced that &quot;Roar&quot; had received an RIAA Diamond certification award for 10 million copies sold.

In 2012, McKee co-wrote two songs that appeared on Adam Lambert&#x27;s album &quot;Trespassing&quot;, which debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Album Chart. She appeared as a featured performer on &quot;Thunder&quot; from Rusko&#x27;s album &quot;Songs&quot;, released on Mad Decent. During this time she signed a recording contract with Epic Records. She had garnered attention for her fashion sense, appearing on E!&#x27;s &quot;Fashion Police&quot;, and appearing on the pages of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;New York Post&quot;, and &quot;Schön! Magazine&quot;. In 2013, McKee was awarded three more BMI Pop awards for her songwriting work on Katy Perry&#x27;s &quot;Wide Awake&quot; and &quot;Part of Me&quot;, as well as Britney Spears&#x27;s &quot;Hold It Against Me&quot;.

McKee&#x27;s first single under Epic Records was &quot;American Girl&quot;, which was released on July 23, 2013. She posted a promotional video for &quot;American Girl&quot; on YouTube in June 2013 which garnered 2.3 million views. The official music video for the song was released on July 22, 2013. In October, McKee released a new song titled &quot;Sleepwalker&quot;. McKee confirmed that the song was not a single, but rather an &quot;inbetweengle&quot;, a &quot;portmanteau&quot; meaning &quot;in between single&quot;, meant to tide fans over until her next official release. The music video premiered on October 17, 2013, and starred McKee and Kelsey Chow. McKee had spent several years under a joint deal between Epic and Kemosabe Records and had planned to release her second studio album in the summer of 2014. A second single titled &quot;S.L.A.Y.&quot; was performed at multiple venues and while she was on tour with Karmin on their Pulses Tour, but was delayed many times and eventually not released, until being re-recorded ten years later. McKee left Epic and Kemosabe Records after feeling she had a lack of control over her career and the creative direction that she wanted to take.

===2014–2020: Independent career, standalone singles and &quot;Bombastic&quot;===

On December 18, 2014, McKee released a song called &quot;California Winter&quot; on to her SoundCloud and iTunes. On April 12, 2015, in an interview with Ultimate Music, she announced she had departed from Epic Records. McKee stated that this was because she favors her being an independent artist because she felt controlled and like she had no creative freedom. She said that she is releasing her second extended play in June. She also stated her intentions for it to be a visual EP. One song titled &quot;Wasted Youth&quot; has been announced and has already had its music video filmed. At the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards 2015, McKee revealed in an interview that Charlie Puth, with whom she had previously worked on her song &quot;California Winter&quot;, had co-written her next single, which she also said would be released in the next week. This single is believed to be called &quot;Bombastic&quot; as teased on her Instagram page. The video for &quot;Bombastic&quot; released onto Bonnie&#x27;s VEVO account on May 26, 2015. McKee appears in Eden xo&#x27;s music video for her single &quot;The Weekend&quot; as Cinderella. The &quot;Bombastic&quot; EP was released on June 30, being her first album release since her 2004 debut &quot;Trouble&quot;.

On July 1, McKee announced on a live stream she was trying to get back the rights to the songs she had previously recorded with her former label Epic Records, so she could finally get to release them; she also confirmed physical copies of the &quot;Bombastic&quot; EP were being released in the coming months. For Christmas, McKee released a special called &quot;California Winter Extravaganza&quot; on her YouTube account on December 16, which features Ferras, Sarah Hudson, Lindsey Stirling, Todrick Hall, Karmin, Eden xo, Paper Pilots, and Bridget Marquardt.

On January 12, 2016, McKee released the music video for &quot;Wasted Youth&quot; on her VEVO channel. She uploaded a cover of Prince&#x27;s song, &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; on her YouTube channel on April 28, 2016, as a tribute to Prince following his death on April 21, 2016. Off the cover, she said, &quot;Prince has been and always will be one of my favorite artists and songwriters of all time. I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say that I ask myself nearly every time I sit down to write a song, &quot;What would Prince do?&quot; &quot;Doves Cry&quot; is perfection and I know I could never even hope to touch his brilliance, but in his passing, I realized how much this song really means to me, and was inspired to pay homage to the late, great, genius who taught me to take musical risks, to act my age and not my shoe size, and how to get through this thing called life&quot;. On June 21, 2016, McKee released a remix for &quot;I Want It All&quot; featuring Vicetonr as the third single from the EP and published a music video for the original version on her VEVO account.
In September 2016, in collaboration with Quest Nutrition brand, McKee released the video for the song &quot;Stud Muffin&quot; inspired by the movie &quot;Grease&quot;. On November 2, 2016, McKee released &quot;Easy&quot;&#x27;s music video on her VEVO account. On December 16, 2016 McKee released her single called &quot;Stars in Your Heart&quot;, alongside the shelved music video from 2013, as a gift for her fans.

On August 18, 2017, McKee released the single called &quot;Thorns&quot;. She was featured on Norwegian DJ Kygo&#x27;s track &quot;Riding Shotgun&quot; from his album &quot;Kids in Love&quot;, which was released on November 3, 2017.

On May 10, 2018, McKee released the single called &quot;Mad Mad World&quot;, which premiered in &quot;Billboard&quot; Magazine. The song was released on streaming day later.

On February 15, 2019, McKee featured on Armin van Buuren single called &quot;Lonely For You&quot;. She released a cover of Billie Eilish song called &quot;Lovely&quot;, featuring AUGUST 08 on June 28, 2019. McKee released her collaboration with Eden xo called &quot;Bad Girls Go To Heaven&quot; on October 25, 2019.

In 2020, McKee directed and starred in her first short film, &quot;April Kills The Vibe&quot;.

===2022–present: &quot;Hot City&quot;===
During 2022 and 2023, McKee re-recorded songs that were intended for her 2013 album with Epic Records, after joining TikTok and receiving from her followers many questions about the scrapped project, that have been recurrent on social networks and internet forums over the years. For some interviews, McKee talked about finding an internet forum which had a thread to about 500 pages discussing that era and songs corespondent, where it was found to have been titled &quot;Hot City&quot;. In June 2023, she released &quot;SLAY,&quot; a song originally recorded ten years prior for this project, and then leaked online after being performed live on Karmin&#x27;s Pulses Tour, for a then upcoming album, to the remaining &quot;Hot City&quot; title, officially announced on April 24, 2024, alongside another single release, &quot;Jenny&#x27;s Got a Boyfriend.&quot; In the time between &quot;SLAY&quot; and &quot;Jenny&#x27;s Got a Boyfriend,&quot; two other singles were released by McKee, &quot;Hot City&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Mad Get Famous,&quot; attached to the 2013 era and present in the rerecorded album. The LP includes 15 songs from the Epic sessions, as well as a new song titled &quot;Snatched,&quot; recorded in 2018, featuring drag queen artist Priyanka. The re-recorded project, which includes the original version of McKee&#x27;s 2013 single &quot;American Girl,&quot; what was supposed to be the lead single to the original album, as well as two other standalone singles later released, &quot;Sleepwalker,&quot; and &quot;Stars In Your Heart,&quot; was released independently on May 31, 2024 as her second studio album. &quot;Forever 21,&quot; another track sung in 2013 on Karmin&#x27;s Pulses Tour that also leaked online, and has been since promptly hyped by McKee&#x27;s fans too, was offered as a ready-to-download track during the preorder for &quot;Hot City&quot;, exclusively through Apple Music, whilst it was revealed the album version for &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Mad Get Famous,&quot; released earlier as a solo single, features Canadian artist Sophie Powers. Since its release, &quot;Hot City&quot; was met with positive reviews, being described as a &quot;treasure trove for pop fans.&quot;

McKee stated that the main goal behind the process to re-record and release &quot;Hot City&quot;, besides the constant asking from fans of an official release to the demos from the discarded era, which led her to &quot;give the people what they want,&quot; was her own desire to see the scrapped tracks get such treatment. In her words, &quot;I was so heartbroken when I had to shelve this album and I really didn&#x27;t think there was any hope for it to see the light of the day, which is devastating because they were some of my favorite songs I had ever written for myself.&quot; She informed too that Epic Records, noticed by her as being nowadays &quot;all different people there now from where [she] signed to,&quot; has not made any objection to her independent release, but rather have been &quot;very cooperative and cool&quot; to her, adding that &quot;now we&#x27;re kinda partnering on [the album].&quot; Still during the &quot;Hot City&quot; press interviews, she stated there is already a successor to her sophomore LP, at &quot;written probably 75% percent of it&quot; stage, that is currently set to be a &quot;left turn from &quot;Hot City&quot;,&quot; &quot;darker&quot; and &quot;really raw and emotional,&quot; according to McKee&#x27;s own description for it.

Still during &quot;Hot City&quot; promotional campaign, McKee released, on July 4, 2024, a reedited EP for her 2013 single, American Girl, including a remix by duo of DJs Oliver, previously released through Soundcloud and also uploaded to McKee&#x27;s official YouTube account. Four days after the release of &quot;American Girl EP&quot;, the singer released a music video for longtime fan-favourite track &quot;Forever 21,&quot; premiering it through Nylon, and then uploaded to her official YouTube account. To promote &quot;Hot City&quot;, McKee will serve as a supporting act to most dates of Canadian artist Kiesza&#x27;s &quot;Dancing and Crying Tour&quot;, with concerts to be held on theatres across the Pacific Coast of the United States and Canada during October 2024. One day before McKee joins this trek, she performs at &quot;No Creeps! Another F*cking Music Industry Event&quot;, an event presented at the Bourbon Room in Hollywood, Los Angeles, in order to advocating for safety, mental health and inclusivity in the music industry. On October 9, 2024, McKee made available for pre-order both CD and vinyl formats off &quot;Hot City&quot;, the former through her official webstore, and the latter through Graffiti Records website. After the vinyl got sold out, a second batch has been made available, also through McKee&#x27;s official webstore.

On Halloween&#x27;s Eve of 2024, McKee released an EP to her 2013 single, &quot;Sleepwalker,&quot; including a remix featuring American indie artist Mothica. The EP, named &quot;Sleepwalker (Resurrected)&quot;, features also five previously released McKee&#x27;s collaborations under collective musician band project LVCRFT. Following that, on December 18, 2024, a Christmas EP titled after her 2014 single, &quot;California Winter,&quot; featuring the track in its original form and also as a re-recorded duet with American singer, actor, and comedian Matt Rogers, plus other four Christmas tracks, including a cover of Canadian singer and songwriter Leonard Cohen&#x27;s 1984 single and posterior signature hit, &quot;Hallelujah,&quot; got released on streaming music services. Among the other tracks from &quot;California Winter&quot; EP, there are two cover versions of the 1944 Christmas classic ballad first introduced by Judy Garland, &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,&quot; one close to Garland&#x27;s original version, and another with expletive lyrics, that also appear on that version title.

On February 21, 2025, in the same vein of her previously released &quot;American Girl&quot; EP (see above), McKee released a correspondent extended play for longtime fan-favourite leaked demo turned rerecorded and officially released album track and subsequently issued as a single for &quot;Hot City&quot;, &quot;Forever 21.&quot; Following the same pattern of the EP off her only one single released through Epic Records, &quot;Forever 21&quot; EP features several different versions of this single, such as instrumental, a cappella, unplugged, sped up and slow down ones.

McKee is bisexual, saying on an episode of &quot;In Bed with Joan&quot;, &quot;I think it&#x27;s one of those things where, you know, I think all little girls kind of play &#x27;doctor&#x27; with their girlfriends, and then I kind of never grew out of it.&quot;

<text>Jicarilla Apache (, Jicarilla language: Jicarilla Dindéi), one of several loosely organized autonomous bands of the Eastern Apache, refers to the members of the Jicarilla Apache Nation currently living in New Mexico and speaking a Southern Athabaskan language. The term &quot;jicarilla&quot; comes from Mexican Spanish meaning &quot;little basket&quot;, referring to the small sealed baskets they used as drinking vessels. To neighboring Apache bands, such as the Mescalero and Lipan, they were known as &quot;Kinya-Inde&quot; (&quot;People who live in fixed houses&quot;).

The Jicarilla called themselves also &quot;Haisndayin,&quot; translated as &quot;people who came from below&quot; because they believed themselves to be the sole descendants of the first people to emerge from the underworld. The underworld was the home of Ancestral Man and Ancestral Woman, who produced the first people. The Jicarilla believed &quot;Hascin&quot;, their chief deity, created Ancestral Man and Ancestral Woman, as well as all the animals, the sun, and the moon.

The Jicarilla Apache led a seminomadic existence in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and the plains of southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. They also ranged into the Great Plains starting before 1525 CE. For years, they lived a relatively peaceful life, traveling seasonally to traditional sites for hunting, gathering, and cultivation along river beds. The Jicarilla learned about farming and pottery from the Puebloan peoples and about survival on the plains from the Plains Indians. Their diet and lifestyle were rich and varied. The Jicarilla&#x27;s farming practices expanded to the point where they required considerable time and energy. As a result, the people became rather firmly settled and tended to engage in warfare less frequently than other Eastern Apache groups. Starting in the 1700s, the Jicarilla experienced encroachment by colonial New Spain, pressure from other Native American tribes such as the Comanches, and subsequent westward expansion of the United States. These factors led to significant loss of property, expulsion from their sacred lands, and relocation to lands unsuited for survival.

The mid-1800s to the mid-1900s were particularly difficult for the Jicarilla. Their tribal bands were displaced, treaties were made and broken with them, and they experienced a significant loss of life due to tuberculosis and other diseases. Additionally, they lacked opportunities for survival. By 1887, they received their reservation, which was expanded in 1907 to include more suitable land for ranching and agriculture. Over several decades, they discovered the rich natural resources of the San Juan Basin beneath the reservation land.

Tribal members transitioned from a seminomadic lifestyle and are now supported by various industries on their reservation, including oil and gas, casino gaming, forestry, ranching, and tourism. The Jicarilla are renowned for their pottery, basketry, and beadwork.

==History==

===Early history===
The Jicarilla Apaches are one of the Athabaskan linguistic groups that migrated out of Canada by 1525 CE, possibly several hundred or more years earlier. They eventually settled on what they considered their land, bounded by four sacred rivers in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado–the Rio Grande, Pecos River, Arkansas River, and Canadian River–and containing sacred mountain peaks and ranges. The Jicarilla also ranged out into the plains of northwestern Texas and the western portions of Oklahoma and Kansas. By the 1600s, they inhabited the Chama Valley in present-day New Mexico and the western part of present-day Oklahoma. Before contact with the Spanish, the Apache people lived in relative peace.

The Jicarilla people of the 1600s were seminomadic, engaging in seasonal agriculture they learned from the Pueblo people and Spaniards of New Spain, along the rivers within their territory.

The Apache have historical connections to the Dismal River culture of the western Plains. This culture is often associated with the Paloma and Quartelejo (also known as Cuartelejo) Apaches. Jicarilla Apache pottery has also been found at several Dismal River complex sites. Over time, some of the people from the Dismal River culture joined the Kiowa Apache in the Black Hills of present-day South Dakota. Due to pressure from the west by the Comanche and from the east by the Pawnee and French, the Kiowa and the remaining people of Dismal River culture migrated south, where they eventually joined the Lipan Apache and Jicarilla Apache nations.

By the 1800s, the Jicarilla were planting a variety of crops along the rivers, especially along the upper Arkansas River and its tributaries, sometimes using irrigation to aid in growing squash, beans, pumpkins, melons, peas, wheat, and corn. They found farming in the mountains safer than on the open plains. They primarily hunted buffalo into the 17th century, and, thereafter, hunted antelope, deer, mountain sheep, elk, and buffalo. Jicarilla women gathered berries, agave, honey, onions, potatoes, nuts, and seeds from the wild.

===Sacred land and creation story===
In the Jicarilla creation story, the land enclosed by the four sacred rivers was provided to them by the Creator. It included select places for communicating with the Creator and spirits, as well as sacred rivers and mountains to be respected and conserved. Additionally, there were very specific places for obtaining items for ceremonial rituals, such as the white clay found southeast of Taos, red ochre north of Taos, and yellow ochre on a mountain near Picuris Pueblo. The Jicarilla people believe the &quot;heart of the world&quot; is located near Taos.

Traditional Jicarilla stories, such as White Shell Woman, Killer of the Enemies, Child of the Water, and others, feature people and places that are special to them. These places include the Rio Grande Gorge, Picuris Pueblo, the spring and marsh near El Prado, Hopewell Lake, and particularly the Taos Pueblo and the four sacred rivers. Additionally, the Jicarilla created shrines in locations that held spiritual significance, some of which were shared with the Taos Pueblo in the Taos area.

In 1865, Father Antonio José Martínez, a priest from New Mexico, documented a connection between the Jicarilla people and Taos. He wrote that the Jicarilla had a long history of living between the mountains and the villages, with pottery making being an important source of income. The clay used for the pottery came from the Taos and Picuris Pueblo areas.

===Pressures for Jicarilla Apache land===
The Apaches&#x27; traditional culture, economy, and lifestyle became strained by the arrival and growth of other populations, Manifest Destiny, and the Indian Wars. Many people died due to famine, the Indian Wars, including the Battle of Cieneguilla, and diseases not indigenous to the American continent, to which they had no resistance.

When the Comanche, who had obtained guns from the French, and their close allies and kin, the Ute, were expanding onto the plains, they pillaged the various eastern Apache peoples (Jicarilla, Mescalero, and Lipan) who occupied the southern plains in a bid for control. As they were pushed off the plains, the Jicarilla moved to the mountains and near the pueblos and Spanish missions, where they sought alliance with the Puebloan peoples and the Spanish settlers. In 1724, several Apache bands were annihilated by the Comanches, who forced them to &quot;give up half their women and children, and then they burned several villages, killing all but sixty-nine men, two women, and three boys.&quot; The Jicarilla people were forced to seek refuge into the eastern Sangre de Cristo Mountains north of the Taos Pueblo in New Mexico. Some moved to the Pecos Pueblo in New Mexico or joined the Mescalero and Lipan bands in Texas. In 1779, a combined force of Jicarilla, Ute, Pueblo, and Spanish soldiers defeated the Comanche, who, after another seven years and several more military campaigns, finally sued for peace. After that, the Jicarilla reestablished themselves in their old tribal territory in southern Colorado.

===Ollero and Llanero bands===
The geography of the Jicarilla tribal territory consists of two fundamental environments that helped shape the tribe&#x27;s basic social organization into two bands: the &quot;Llaneros&quot;, or plains people, and the &quot;Olleros&quot;, or mountain valley people.

Beginning in the 19th century, after being pushed out of the plains, the Jicarilla split into two bands:
* The &quot;Olleros&quot;, the mountain people - pottery making clan, a.k.a. &quot;Northern Jicarilla&quot;, lived west of the Rio Grande along the Chama River of New Mexico and Colorado, settled down as farmers, became potters and lived partly in Pueblo-like villages. They began subsidizing their livelihood through sales of micaceous clay pottery and basketry and learned to farm from their Pueblo neighbors. Ollero is Spanish for &quot;potters.&quot; Their name for themselves is &quot;Saidindê&quot; for &quot;Sand People,&quot; &quot;Mountain People,&quot; or &quot;Mountain Dwellers.&quot; The Spanish rendering is &quot;Hoyeros&quot; meaning &quot;mountain-valley people.&quot; The Capote Band of Utes (&quot;Kapota&quot;, &quot;Kahpota&quot;) lived east of the Great Divide south of the Conejos River and east of the Rio Grande, west towards the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, in the San Luis Valley, along the headwaters of the Rio Grande and the Animas River, centering in the vicinity of present-day Chama and Tierra Amarilla of Rio Arriba County. They formed an alliance with the Olleros, similar to the Muache alliance with the Llanero, against the Southern Plains Tribes such as the Comanche, Southern Arapaho, Southern Cheyenne, and Kiowa, their former allies. They maintained trade relations with Puebloan peoples.
* The &quot;Llaneros&quot;, the plains people clan, a.k.a. &quot;Eastern Jicarilla&quot;, lived as nomads in tipis, called &quot;kozhan&quot; by the Jicarilla. They hunted buffalo on the plains east of the Rio Grande, centering along the headwaters of the Canadian River. During the winter, they lived in the mountains between the Canadian River and the Rio Grande. They camped and traded near Picuris Pueblo, New Mexico, Pecos, New Mexico, and Taos, New Mexico. Their name for themselves is &quot;Gulgahén&quot; for &quot;Plains People&quot;; the Spanish picked it up as &quot;Llaneros&quot; - &quot;Plains Dwellers&quot;.

===Battle of Cieneguilla===
The Battle of Cieneguilla (pronounced sienna-GEE-ya; English: small swamp) was an engagement of a group of Jicarilla Apaches, their Ute allies, and the American 1st Cavalry Regiment on March 30, 1854, near what is now Pilar, New Mexico.

====Background====
By the mid-1800s, tensions between the Spanish, multiple Native American nations, and westward expanding United States settlers erupted as all sought and laid claim to land in the southwest. Diseases to which Native Americans had no immunity &quot;decimated&quot; their tribes, creating greater pressure for their lands to be taken from them. As tensions among Native Americans grew and with numerous attempts to relocate them from their traditional hunting and gathering land and sacred homelands, the Jicarilla became increasingly hostile in their efforts to protect their lands. The United States military developed a defense system of forts and troops to restrict attacks on westward travelers. Fort Union was established, in part, to provide protection from the Jicarillas. The disruption and &quot;mutual incomprehensions&quot; of one another&#x27;s culture led to warfare among the Spanish, Native American nations, and Americans.

Leo E. Oliva, author of &quot;Fort Union and the Frontier Army in the Southwest&quot;, notes that: &quot;The three cultural groups in the Southwest had different concepts of family life, personal values, social relations, religion, uses and ownership of land and other property, how best to obtain the provisions of life, and warfare.&quot;

Fort Union was established by Colonel Edwin Vose Sumner, who ordered Major James Henry Carleton&#x27;s Company K 1st Dragoons on August 2, 1851, to protect westward travelers between Missouri and New Mexico Territory on the Santa Fe Trail. New Mexico Territory&#x27;s Governor William Carr Lane made treaties with the Jicarilla and other Native American tribes of New Mexico to relocate them to reservations where they would peacefully take up agriculture on new lands. Both parties agreed to payments to compensate the Native Americans for their loss of access to hunting, gathering, and sacred homeland. The U.S. government, however, pulled the funding for this agreement, betraying the Native American tribal members. Further complicating the situation, all the crops planted by the tribal members failed and the people continued raiding for survival.

====Battle and aftermath====

In March 1854, Lobo Blanco, a Jicarilla chief, led a band of 30 warriors to raid the horse herd of a contractor for Fort Union. A detachment of 2nd U.S. Dragoons, led by Lieutenant David Bell, pursued the raiders. They engaged in a fight on the Canadian River and killed many of the Jicarilla, including the chief, who was repeatedly wounded and finally crushed to death under a boulder.

In late March, Major George A. Blake, commanding officer at Burgwin Cantonment, sent a detachment of 1st U.S. Dragoon of 60 men (company I and part of company F) to patrol along the Santa Fe trail. On March 30, 1854, a combined force of about 250 Apaches and Utes fought the U.S. dragoons, led by Lieutenant John Wynn Davidson, near Pilar, New Mexico, then known as Cieneguilla. The battle lasted for two or four hours, according to surviving soldier James A. Bennett (aka James Bronson). The Jicarilla, led by their principal chief, Francisco Chacon, and Flechas Rayadas, fought with flintlock rifles and arrows, killing 22 and a wounding another 36 of 60 dragoon soldiers, who then retreated to Ranchos de Taos lighter by 22 horses and most of the troops&#x27; supplies.

Lieutenant Colonel Philip St. George Cooke of the 2nd Dragoons Regiment quickly organized an expedition to pursue the Jicarilla with the help of 32 Pueblo Indian and Mexican scouts under Captain James H. Quinn, with Kit Carson as the principal guide. After a winter pursuit through the mountains, Cooke caught up with the Jicarilla. Jicarilla leader, Flechas Rayadas, offered an agreement for peace in exchange for the horses and guns that the Jicarilla acquired from the Battle, but the offer was not accepted. On April 8, Cooke&#x27;s forces fought tribal members at their camp in the canyon of Ojo Caliente. The Jicarilla dispersed in small groups to evade further pursuit, but many died from the harsh cold weather.

A large unit under Major James H. Carleton fought again the Jicarillas near Fisher&#x27;s Peak in the Raton Mountains, killing several of them. Francisco Chacon replied by trying an ambush against the soldiers with 150 warriors, but his group was bypassed. Subsequently, five warriors were killed, six wounded, and seventeen women and children were scattered and may have died of cold and hunger during the flight. In May, Francisco Chacon sent word to Santa Fe for peace and surrendered at Abiquiu.

===Jicarilla reservation===
Beginning in the mid-1850s, following the westward expansion of the U.S. and its impact on their livelihoods, attempts began to relocate the Jicarilla Apache, who became increasingly hostile to these pressures. In addition, relations with the Spanish also became hostile when they captured and sold Apache tribal members into slavery. After years of warfare, broken treaties, relocation, and being the only southwestern tribe without a reservation, the Jicarilla Llanero and Ollero bands united in 1873. They sent a delegation to Washington, D.C., to request a reservation. Eventually, U.S. President Grover Cleveland created the Jicarilla Apache Reservation through an executive order signed on February 11, 1887.
After finally securing a reservation, it was spiritually disheartening for them to accept that they would no longer roam on their traditional holy lands and have access to their sacred places. When they arrived, the two bands settled in separate areas of the Reservation. The animosities stemming from this period have persisted into the twentieth century, with the Olleros generally identified as progressives and the Llaneros as conservatives.

The land on the reservation, except that held by non-tribal members, was not suitable for agriculture. As a means of survival, the tribe sold timber from the reservation. In 1907, additional land was secured for the reservation, totaling , suitable for sheep ranching, which became profitable in the 1920s. Until that time, many people suffered from malnutrition, and up to 90% of the tribe members had tuberculosis in 1914. By the 1920s, it seemed likely that the Jicarilla Apache nation may become extinct due to trachoma, tuberculosis, and other diseases. After several difficult ranching periods, many of the previous sheep herders relocated to the tribal headquarters in Dulce, New Mexico. The Jicarilla suffered due to a lack of economic opportunities for decades.

Oil and gas development began on the reservation after World War II, generating up to $1 million annually. Some of this revenue was set aside for a tribal scholarship fund and to develop the Stone Lake Lodge facility. In 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe&quot;, that the tribe had the authority to impose severance taxes on oil companies drilling for oil and natural gas on reservation land.

As a means of repayment for lost tribal lands, the Jicarilla received a settlement in 1971 for $9.15 million. The Jicarilla Apache made a claim for compensation to the U.S. Government when the Indian Claims Commission was created. A two-volume technical report was submitted to the Commission on Spanish and Mexican grants, both unconfirmed and confirmed as part of the case. The tribe was awarded $9,150,000 in the commission&#x27;s final judgment on April 20, 1971.

In 2019, the census showed that there were 3,353 people living on the reservation. The New Mexico Tourism Department reports that there are approximately &quot;2,755 tribal members, most of whom live in the town of Dulce.&quot;

==Tribal government==

The Jicarilla Apache are a federally recognized tribal entity that, in 1937, organized a formal government and adopted a constitution. Traditional tribal leaders were elected as their first tribal council members. In 2000, the tribe officially changed their name to the Jicarilla Apache Nation.

Veronica E. Velarde Tiller, author of &quot;Culture and Customs of the Apache Indians,&quot; writes: &quot;All the powers of the tribal governments reflected the traditional values of the Apache people. The protection, preservation, and conservation of the bounty of &#x27;Mother Earth&#x27;, and all its inhabitants is sacred value shared by all Indian people, and the Apaches were most eager to have this concept incorporated into their tribal constitution.&quot;

The Apache Indians integrated the important value of sharing into their constitution by declaring that the resources of the reservation are &quot;held for the benefit of the entire tribe&quot; Further, all land on the reservation is held by the Jicarilla Apache Reservation. It is one of only two reservations in the United States where land is not owned by individuals but by the tribal nation as a whole. Tribal members are individuals who are at least 3/8 Jicarilla Apache.

The government is made up of the following branches:
* executive, with a president and vice-president serving four-year terms;
* legislative, with eight members serving staggering four-year terms; and
* judicial, tribal court and appellate court judges assigned by the president.

Dulce, a city near the extreme north border of New Mexico, serves as the capital of the Jicarilla Apache Nation, with over 95 percent of the reservation&#x27;s population residing there. Most tribal offices are located in Dulce.

==Reservation==

The Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation, at , is located within two northern New Mexico counties:
* Rio Arriba County
* Sandoval County.
from the Colorado border south to Cuba, New Mexico. The reservation sits along U.S. Route 64 and N.M. 537.

In 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that the reservation has a land area of 1,316.1 sq mi (3525,232 km2) and had a population of 2,596.

The southern half of the reservation is open plains and the northern portion resides in the treed Rocky Mountains. Mammals and birds migratory paths cross the reservation seasonally, including mountain lion, black bear, elk, Canada geese, and turkey. Rainbow, brown and cutthroat trout are stocked in seven lakes on the reservation, but annual conditions such as low precipitation result in high pH-levels. From 1995 to 2000, the lake levels were severely low due to drought. As a result, most of the fish were killed off during those years. The reservation sits on the San Juan Basin, which is rich in fossil fuels. The basin is the largest producer of oil along the Rocky Mountains and the second largest producer of natural gas in the United States.

==Culture==
The Jicarilla are traditionally matrilocal and are organized into matrilineal clans. They have incorporated some practices of their Pueblo neighbors into their own traditions. They are renowned for their fine basket making of distinctive diamond, cross, zig-zag designs, or representations of deer, horses or other animals. They are also known for their beadwork and for keeping Apache fiddle-making alive.

As of 2000, about 70% of the tribe practice an organized religion, many of whom are Christians. The Jicarilla language is spoken by about one half of the tribal members, most by older men and women.

Ceremonial practices consist of:
* Puberty feast, called &quot;keesta&quot; in Jicarilla, is a rite of passage ceremony for girls or young women.

Annual events include:
* Little Beaver Celebration with a pow-wow, rodeo, draft horse pull, and a five-mile race in mid-July.
* Stone Lake Fiesta with ceremonial dances, rodeo, and footraces each September 14 and 15.

==Economy==
The Jicarilla Apache Nation&#x27;s economy is based upon mining, forestry, gaming, tourism, retail, and agriculture, including:
* oil and gas wells, owned and operated by the tribe 
* solar farms on tribal lands
* timber
* cattle and sheep ranching
* reservation government employees, which include about 50% of tribal members
* Dulce business employees
* traditional arts, including basketry and pottery
* Tribe-owned Apache Nugget Casino north of Cuba, New Mexico and the Best Western Jicarilla Inn and Casino in Dulce
* operation of tribe-owned radio station KCIE (90.5 FM) in Dulce, NM.

Although the mid twentieth century brought additional economic opportunities, high unemployment and a low standard of living prevails for tribal members. From the &quot;Tiller&#x27;s Guide to Indian Country: Economic Profiles of American Reservations&quot;, 2005 edition:

:Unemployment rate – 14.2%
:Labor force – 1,1051

The Jicarilla people live in houses with a lifestyle similar to that of other Americans. The cost of food at local grocery stores is higher than in larger U.S. cities nearby. They have access to all modern conveniences and use them based on their preferences and financial means. High unemployment and poverty-level income rates have led to high crime rates. This is largely due to a high incidence of [alcohol] abuse, which averages 1.7% in the Native American population and reaches 30% in some rural areas or reservations.

==Education==
Children attend a public school on the reservation. Until the 1960s, few children graduated high school. However, since the 1960s, the Bureau of Indian Affairs&#x27; educational programs and the Chester A. Faris scholarship programs, funded by oil and gas revenues, provide opportunities for higher education. In the 1970s, some tribal members obtained graduate degrees. Educational assistance offices were created by Apache tribes in the 1980s to help students navigate their educational career.

Portions of the reservation in Rio Arriba County are zoned to Dulce Independent Schools, Chama Valley Independent Schools, and Jemez Mountain Public Schools. Portions of the reservation in Sandoval County are zoned to Cuba Independent Schools.

<text>The Cook ministry (Liberal) was the 9th ministry of the Government of Australia. It was led by the country&#x27;s 6th Prime Minister, Joseph Cook. The Cook Ministry succeeded the Second Fisher ministry, which dissolved on 24 June 1913 following the federal election that took place in May which saw the Liberals defeat Andrew Fisher&#x27;s Labor Party - albeit with a one-seat majority. The ministry was replaced by the Third Fisher ministry on 17 September 1914 following the federal election that took place on 5 September which saw Labor defeat the Liberals.

Willie Kelly, who died in 1960, was the last surviving member of the Cook ministry.

<text>Kopitiam Investment Pte Ltd, more commonly known as Kopitiam, is a Singaporean food court chain focused on local cuisine. Under the FairPrice group along with NTUC FairPrice, NTUC Foodfare and Link, the group serves more than 2 million customers with over 100 million meals annually through its 100+ outlets located islandwide. Founded in 1988, it operates around 80 outlets at many locations across Singapore, including Changi Airport, Plaza Singapura, VivoCity and Jem. Kopitiam also owns three subsidiary food court companies, Bagus, Cantine, and Sedap. 

==Etymology==
The name derives from the generic portmanteau term &quot;kopi tiam&quot;. &quot;Kopi&quot; means coffee in Hokkien, and &quot;tiam&quot; is the Hokkien word for shop. 

==History==
On 21 September 2018, it was announced that NTUC Enterprise would acquire Kopitiam by the end of 2018. The acquisition was approved by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore on 20 December 2018.

In November 2019, NTUC FairPrice, NTUC Foodfare, Kopitiam, and Link joined forces under the FairPrice Group to collectively serve the people of Singapore under the philosophy of &quot;Everything Food Made Easy.&quot; As part of this partnership, Kopitiam and NTUC Foodfare were merged to form a single Food Services business unit. The aim of this unit is to provide nourishing meals through various formats, such as food courts in malls, coffee shops, hawker centers, quick-service cafes, and kiosks.

<text>The Second Hughes ministry (National Labor) was the 12th ministry of the Government of Australia. It was led by the country&#x27;s 7th Prime Minister, Billy Hughes. The Second Hughes ministry succeeded the First Hughes ministry, which dissolved on 14 November 1916 following the split that took place within the governing Labor Party over the issue of conscription. This led to Hughes and his supporters leaving the party to form the National Labor Party, which swiftly received parliamentary support from Joseph Cook and the Liberal Party. The ministry was replaced by the Third Hughes ministry on 17 February 1917 after National Labor and Commonwealth Liberal merged into the Nationalist Party.

Billy Hughes, who died in 1952, was the last surviving member of the Second Hughes ministry; Hughes was also the last surviving member of the Watson ministry, First Fisher ministry, Third Fisher ministry and Third Hughes ministry.

<doc id="1202722" wikidata="Q545901" url="?curid=1202722" title="Wayne Dyer">
<text>Wayne Walter Dyer (May 10, 1940 – August 29, 2015) was an American self-help author and a motivational speaker. Dyer earned a Bachelor’s degree in History and Philosophy, a Master’s degree in Psychology and an Ed.D. in Guidance and Counseling at Wayne State University in 1970. Early in his career, he worked as a high school guidance counselor, and went on to run a successful private therapy practice. He became a popular professor of counselor education at St. John&#x27;s University, where he was approached by a literary agent to put his ideas into book form. The result was his first book, &quot;Your Erroneous Zones&quot; (1976), one of the best-selling books of all time, with an estimated 100 million copies sold. This launched Dyer&#x27;s career as a motivational speaker and self-help author, during which he published 20 more best-selling books and produced a number of popular specials for PBS. Influenced by thinkers such as Abraham Maslow and Albert Ellis, Dyer&#x27;s early work focused on psychological themes such as motivation, self actualization and assertiveness. By the 1990s, the focus of his work had shifted to spirituality. Inspired by Swami Muktananda and New Thought, he promoted themes such as the &quot;power of intention,&quot; collaborated with alternative medicine advocate Deepak Chopra on a number of projects and was a frequent guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show.
==Early life==
Dyer was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Melvin Lyle Dyer and Hazel Irene Vollick. He spent much of his first ten years in an orphanage on the east side of Detroit, after his father walked out on the family, leaving his mother to raise three small boys. Dyer was later adopted by a loving but strict couple. After graduating from Denby High School, Dyer served in the United States Navy from 1958 to 1962. He received his Ed.D. degree in counseling from Wayne State University. His dissertation was titled &quot;Group Counseling Leadership Training in Counselor Education&quot;.

== Career ==
Dyer, a Detroit native, worked as a high school guidance counselor there and as a professor of counseling psychology at St. John&#x27;s University in New York City. He pursued an academic career, published in journals, and established a private therapy practice. His lectures at St. John&#x27;s University, which focused on positive thinking and motivational speaking techniques, attracted many students. Literary agent Arthur Pine persuaded Dyer to document his theories in his first book, called &quot;Your Erroneous Zones&quot; (1976). Dyer quit his teaching job and began a publicity tour of the United States, doggedly pursuing bookstore appearances and media interviews (&quot;out of the back of his station wagon&quot;, according to Michael Korda, making the best-seller lists &quot;before book publishers even noticed what was happening&quot;). After &quot;Your Erroneous Zones&quot; dozens more books followed, many of them also best-sellers. Among them were &quot;Wishes Fulfilled&quot;, &quot;Excuses Begone&quot; and &quot;The Sky’s the Limit&quot;. The success of these books eventually led to national television talk show appearances including &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;.

Dyer proceeded to build on his success with lecture tours, a series of audiotapes, PBS programs, and regular publication of new books. Dyer&#x27;s message resonated with many in the New Thought Movement and beyond. He often recounted anecdotes from his family life and repeatedly used his own life experience as an example. His success story was a part of his appeal. Dyer told readers to pursue self actualization, calling reliance on the self a guide to &quot;religious&quot; experience, and suggested that readers emulate Jesus Christ, whom he termed both an example of a self-actualized person and a &quot;preacher of self-reliance&quot;. Dyer criticized societal focus on guilt, which he saw as an unhealthy immobilization in the present due to actions taken in the past. He encouraged readers to see how parents, institutions, and even they, themselves, had imposed upon themselves.

Although Dyer initially resisted the spiritual tag, by the 1990s he had altered his message to include more components of spirituality when he wrote the book &quot;Real Magic&quot; and discussed higher consciousness in the book &quot;Your Sacred Self&quot;.

== Influences ==
Wayne Dyer claimed Nisargadatta Maharaj as his teacher and cited the quotation: &quot;Love says: &#x27;I am everything&#x27;. Wisdom says: &#x27;I am nothing&#x27;&quot;, from a compilation of talks on Advaita Vedanta (Nondualism) philosophy I Am That. He was influenced by Abraham Maslow&#x27;s concept of self-actualization and by the teachings of Swami Muktananda, whom he considered to be his Master. In his book, &quot;Wishes Fulfilled; Mastering the Art of Manifesting&quot;, Dyer also credited Saint Francis of Assisi and the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu as foundational influences in his work.

== Books ==

&quot;Pulling Your Own Strings&quot; (Copyright 1978) was Dyers&#x27; second work as sole author. It developed the idea of habitual &quot;belief systems&quot; hampering our personal effectiveness. Chapter 7, &quot;Never Place Loyalty to Institutions and Things Above Loyalty to Yourself,&quot; included &quot;Strategies for eliminating institutional victimisation.&quot;

&quot;The Sky is the Limit&quot; (copyright 1980) was the third work by Dyer as sole author. In it, Dyer introduced the concept of the &quot;critical inch&quot;, that portion of life in which the ultimate meaning of our lives is considered. He was critical of the &quot;hurry up&quot; Western world. In Chapter 8, &quot;Cultivating a sense of Purpose,&quot; he recommended such strategies as &quot;Do something you have never done before,&quot; &quot;Make a point to talk to a stranger today,&quot; and &quot;Stop defending things as they have always been.&quot;

== Criticism ==
Psychologist Albert Ellis wrote that Dyer&#x27;s book &quot;Your Erroneous Zones&quot; was probably &quot;the worst example&quot; of plagiarism of Ellis&#x27;s Rational Emotive Therapy (RET). In a 1985 letter to Dyer, Ellis claimed that Dyer had participated in an Ellis workshop on RET before he published &quot;Your Erroneous Zones&quot;, in which Dyer appeared to understand RET very well. Ellis added that &quot;300 or more people have voluntarily told me... that [the book] was clearly derived from RET.&quot; Dyer never apologized nor expressed any sense of wrongdoing. Ellis admonished Dyer for unethically and unprofessionally failing to credit Ellis&#x27;s work as the book&#x27;s primary source, but he never took legal action as ultimately he felt overall gratitude for Dyer&#x27;s work, writing: &quot;&quot;Your Erroneous Zones&quot; is a good book, ... it has helped a great number of people, and ... it outlines the main principles of RET quite well... with great simplicity and clarity.&quot;
In &quot;Your Erroneous Zones&quot;, Dyer makes reference to Albert Ellis in chapter seven. However, Dyer claimed (on pages 150–155 of his memoir &quot;I Can See Clearly Now&quot;, which was published by Hay House Publishing in 2014, one year before Dyer&#x27;s death) that the entire premise of &quot;Your Erroneous Zones&quot; was principally derived from three years of audio tapes of the lectures that he gave while acting as a professor at St. John&#x27;s University in New York. 

In 2010, writer Stephen Mitchell filed a lawsuit against Dyer and his publisher, Hay House, for copyright infringement for taking 200 lines, without permission, from his version of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; for Dyer&#x27;s books &quot;Living the Wisdom of the Tao&quot; and &quot;Change Your Thoughts – Change Your Life&quot;. The suit was dismissed in 2011 after Dyer and Mitchell agreed to a settlement.

==Personal life==

Dyer was married three times. With his first wife, Judy, he had a daughter. With his second wife, Susan Casselman, he had no children. With his third wife, Marcelene, he had five children, and two stepchildren from Marcelene&#x27;s prior marriage. Wayne and Marcelene legally separated in 2001, after 20 years of marriage. After their separation period they reunited and remained married until his death.

===Credos===
Regarding his personal philosophical outlook, Dyer stated that:


==Death==
Dyer died from a heart attack on Maui, Hawaii, on August 30, 2015, at age 75. He had been diagnosed with leukemia in 2009.

<text>Straton of Sardis (; better known under his Latin name Strato) was a Greek poet and anthologist from the Lydian city of Sardis. 

== Life ==

Straton is thought by some scholars to have lived during the time of Hadrian, based on authorship of a poem about the doctor Artemidorus Capito, a contemporary of Hadrian, being ascribed to him. Not all accept this identification; in the 1980s, a first-century date was proposed for Straton and, more recently, a Neronian or Flavian period has been suggested. Diogenes Laërtius, at the beginning of the 3rd century AD, mentions an epigrammatist by the name of Straton, who some believe was Straton of Sardis.

== Works ==
Straton assembled the anthology of erotic and amorous epigrams called Μοῦσα Παιδική (&quot;Mousa Paidikē&quot;, &quot;The Boyish Muse&quot; or &quot;Musa Puerilis&quot;).

=== Transmission ===
Around 900 AD, a Byzantine scholar named Constantine Cephalas compiled pieces of several Greek anthologies, including &quot;The Boyish Muse&quot;, to make a comprehensive collection of Greek epigrams. Since there is no other textual proof, we do not know if &quot;The Boyish Muse&quot; was taken whole, or if a selection was made from it, or if Cephalas maintained the order of the original anthology, or how much of it is original.

Cephalas&#x27;s collection was revised, divided into specialized anthologies, adapted for school use, and generally much copied. In 1301 AD, a scholar named Maximus Planudes put together a bowdlerized version of the Cephalan book, which became very popular in the Greek-speaking world. When the Ottomans conquered the remains of the Byzantine empire, many Greek scholars brought versions of Planudes&#x27;s version with them into exile in Italy. The Greeks became teachers to Italian scholars. In 1494 they printed an edition of the Planudean book, the &quot;Florilegium Diversorum Epigrammatum&quot;, in Florence.

Most of what we know of Straton&#x27;s work comes instead from a manuscript copied around 980 AD, which preserved many of the poems from the earlier Cephalan anthology. This manuscript was discovered in the library of the Counts Palatine in Heidelberg in 1606 or 1607, by a young visiting scholar named Claudius Salmasius, now called the Palatine Anthology. There is no clear record of how it got there, but a visiting Italian scholar probably left it. About the middle of the 16th century, the Roman scholar and antiquarian Fulvio Orsini (1529–1600) had seen and mentioned such a manuscript, then in the possession of Angelo Colloti.

The newly discovered poems in the Palatine version were copied out by Salmasius, and he began to circulate clandestine manuscript copies as the &quot;Anthologia Inedita&quot;. His copy was later published: first in 1776 when Richard François Philippe Brunck included it in his &quot;Analecta&quot;; and then the full Palatine Anthology was published by F. Jacobs as the &quot;Anthologia Graeca&quot; (13 vols. 1794–1803; revised 1813–1817). The remains of Straton&#x27;s &quot;The Boyish Muse&quot; became Book 12 in Jacob&#x27;s critical &quot;Anthologia Graeca&quot; edition.

=== Translations ===
Because of its taboo subject matter, until the mid-20th century Straton&#x27;s work was generally left untranslated, translated only into Latin, published in censored forms, or translated only in private editions. These translations helped form the Greek core of influential homosexual poetry anthologies, such as Elisar von Kupffer&#x27;s &quot;Lieblingminne und Freundesliebe in der Weltliteratur&quot; (1899) and Edward Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Iolaus&quot; (1908). New translations of Straton&#x27;s &#x27;Book 12&#x27; were later published by poets such as Roger Peyrefitte and Salvatore Quasimodo.

Straton&#x27;s surviving anthology of poems was translated as part of W. R. Paton&#x27;s translation of the entire &quot;Greek Anthology&quot; in the Loeb series in 1918, by Dennis Kratz in 1995, and by Daryl Hine. This last translation was published by Princeton University in 2001 as &quot;Puerilities&quot;, containing 258 surviving poems (omitting one, an obvious later forgery), translated by Daryl Hine, with Greek originals facing. The title is a pun on the one-time title of the work, the &quot;Musa Puerilis&quot;. &quot;Alessandria: Edizioni dell&#x27;Orso&quot; recently published in 2007 Lucia Floridi&#x27;s &quot;Stratone di Sardi. Epigrammi. Testo critico, traduzione e commento&quot;, a book incorporating 105 epigrams into a single edition with commentary.

An article by James Jope in the journal &quot;Mouseion&quot; (2005) compares the translations by Hine and Peyrefitte and discusses how the poems can be reshaped in a modern context. 

Scholars have noted Straton&#x27;s anthology as a strong influence on the work of 20th-century Greek poet C. P. Cavafy.

<text>The Third Hughes ministry (Nationalist) was the 13th ministry of the Government of Australia. It was led by the country&#x27;s 7th Prime Minister, Billy Hughes. The Third Hughes ministry succeeded the Second Hughes ministry, which dissolved on 17 February 1917 after the governing National Labor Party merged with the Liberal Party to form the Nationalist Party. The National Labor Party itself formed as a consequence of the split that took place within the then-governing Labor Party over the issue of conscription. The ministry was replaced by the Fourth Hughes ministry on 8 January 1918 following the resignation of Hughes as prime minister after a vote of no-confidence within the Nationalist Party in the wake of a failed second referendum on conscription. However, due to a lack of alternative leaders, Hughes was immediately re-commissioned as prime minister by Governor-General Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson.

Billy Hughes, who died in 1952, was the last surviving member of the Third Hughes ministry; Hughes was also the last surviving member of the Watson ministry, First Fisher ministry, Third Fisher ministry and Second Hughes ministry.

<doc id="1202725" wikidata="Q3999775" url="?curid=1202725" title="Trouble (Bonnie McKee album)">
<text>Trouble is the debut album of American singer-songwriter Bonnie McKee, released in September 2004. The songs were written when she was aged 14–15, and reflect events in her life at the time. McKee had produced six of these in demo form in 2001, and they were broadcast on Seattle radio stations as well as the National Public Radio network.

McKee had essentially completed the album in New York City with Bob Power as producer, when Reprise asked her to record &quot;Somebody&quot; with Rob Cavallo in California. Pleased with the more layered sound, she decided to re-record all but &quot;January&quot; and &quot;I Hold Her&quot;. This delayed the album&#x27;s release by a year.

==Production and release==
McKee first recorded her album in New York City with producer Bob Power across eight months. Then she was introduced to producer Rob Cavallo, who served as Reprise artists and repertoire man, and went to Los Angeles with him, first to record &quot;Trouble&quot; lead single &quot;Somebody&quot;. The result was enough for them to re-record the whole album, taking a whole year in the process.

Reprise was unsure on how to promote McKee, with the singer herself admitting that &quot;I was a teenage rebel rock star-but writing these heartfelt singer/songwriter songs. I was given a dress code because everyone thought I was &#x27;too sexy.&#x27; No one knew what to do with me.&quot; The label at first considering to showcase her in adult contemporary radio, based on her life history and style influenced by Fiona Apple. To determine how successful this would be, Reprise had a partnership with internet radio website LAUNCHcast, which would include &quot;Somebody&quot; into the adult contemporary playlists, as well as showcasing the song to other listeners. The result had &quot;Somebody&quot; being popular more with a younger audience than the adult females that the label expected, with the song eventually becoming the tenth most played on LAUNCHcast and McKee entering the 50 most searched terms on the website&#x27;s owner Yahoo!. A new strategy was devised, trying to make McKee appeal to the teen pop demographic while showcasing a subversive attitude. This was illustrated by the album cover with McKee blowing a bubble gum, which the singer describes as &quot;a bit of a play on the bubblegum pop thing, except it looks kind of like a mug shot.&quot; The album title was an allusion to McKee&#x27;s wild life: &quot;&#x27;Trouble&#x27; was my middle name. It was such a hard time for me. Before I got the deal, I had a very difficult teen life as a drug addict and a runaway.&quot; Along with &quot;Somebody&quot;, which was featured on the soundtrack album of &quot;Win a Date With Tad Hamilton!&quot; (2004).

==Reception==
Johnny Loftus of AllMusic gave a lukewarm review, saying &quot;McKee&#x27;s lyrics about adolescent empowerment and the ways of the heart aren&#x27;t too different from what&#x27;s already out there. But the songs still share the album&#x27;s affected quality. It&#x27;s as if the quirkier arrangements are intended as image builders, designed to add a spunky flair to the tousled, sassy McKee. Pop music doesn&#x27;t require very much substance -- it&#x27;s meant to be inviting, familiar, and easily accessible. But while Bonnie McKee&#x27;s debut features an ultra-modern sound that&#x27;s been proven successful, its homogenization ends up working against it. Pretty but ultimately empty, Trouble doesn&#x27;t establish McKee as anything more than another hopeful&quot; Tom Lanham of &quot;Paste&quot; magazine praised &quot;Trouble&quot;, which he considered &quot;a great little folk-pop-punk album&quot;. MTV News reviewer Sam Lansky would later describe &quot;Trouble&quot; as &quot;an astonishingly precocious (and criminally underrated) set of soulful pop-rock gems&quot;.

==Sales==
The album disappointed commercially, moving fewer than 17,000 copies. McKee was subsequently dropped from Reprise Records. McKee spoke about the album being unsuccessful, saying &quot;It was devastating when the album didn&#x27;t happen,&quot; she said. &quot;I realized there are so many steps from getting a deal to having a hit...and I didn&#x27;t get there. It was a huge letdown.&quot; Reflecting on the album&#x27;s underperformance considering her eventual success as a songwriter, McKee stated in 2011 that &quot;had &quot;Trouble&quot; done what I wanted it to, I may have been caught in Hot AC land forever, which is just not my style.&quot;

<text>The First Bruce ministry (Nationalist–Country Coalition) was the 16th ministry of the Government of Australia. It was led by the country&#x27;s 8th prime minister, Stanley Bruce. The First Bruce ministry succeeded the Fifth Hughes ministry, which dissolved on 9 February 1923 following the December 1922 federal election and the subsequent resignation of Billy Hughes as prime minister. The Nationalists had lost their majority in the election, and had no choice but to negotiate a Coalition deal with the Country Party. However, Country leader Earle Page let it be known that no deal could be made unless Hughes resigned. It is the first ministry that consists of a centre-right Coalition between the senior conservative party and the junior rural party - this Coalition has more or less endured to this day with the modern-day Liberal Party and National Party. The ministry was replaced by the Second Bruce ministry on 18 December 1925 following the 1925 federal election.

Stanley Bruce, who died in 1967, was the last surviving member of the First Bruce ministry; Bruce was also the last surviving member of the Fifth Hughes ministry and the Second Bruce ministry. Earle Page was the last surviving Country minister.

<text>The sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) is a parasitic lamprey native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is sometimes referred to as the &quot;vampire fish&quot;. In its original habitats, the sea lamprey coevolved with its hosts, and those hosts evolved a measure of resistance to the sea lampreys. 

It was likely introduced to the Great Lakes region through the Erie Canal in 1825 and the Welland Canal in 1919 where it has attacked native fish such as lake trout, lake whitefish, chub, and lake herring. Sea lampreys are considered a pest in the Great Lakes region as each individual has the potential of killing 40 pounds of fish through its 12–18 month feeding period.
==Description==

The sea lamprey has an eel-like body without paired fins. Its mouth is jawless, round and sucker-like, and as wide or wider than the head; sharp teeth are arranged in many concentric circular rows around a sharp, rasp-like tongue. There are seven branchial or gill-like openings behind the eye. Sea lampreys are olive or brown-yellow on the dorsal and lateral part of the body, with some black marblings, with lighter coloration on the belly. Within their seven-year lifespans, adults can reach a length of up to and a body weight up to .

===Etymology===
The etymology of the genus name &quot;Petromyzon&quot; is from &quot;petro-&quot; &quot;stone&quot; and &quot;myzon&quot; &quot;sucking&quot;; &quot;marinus&quot; is Latin for &quot;of the sea&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is found in the northern and western Atlantic Ocean along the shores of Europe and North America, in the western Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, and as an invasive species in the Great Lakes. They have been found at depths up to 4000 meters and can tolerate temperatures of . 

In North America, they are native to the Connecticut River basin in the United States, and invasive to the inland Great Lakes and Lake Champlain in New York and Vermont.
The largest European populations of sea lampreys are located throughout the southwestern areas of Europe (north-central Portugal, north-northwest of Spain, and west–southwest of France). These countries also support the main fisheries of the species.

==Ecology==
Sea lampreys are anadromous; from their lake or sea habitats, they migrate up rivers to spawn. Females deposit a large number of eggs in nests made by males in the substrate of streams with moderately strong current. Spawning is followed by the death of the adults. Larvae burrow in the sand and silt bottom in quiet water downstream from spawning areas and filter-feed on plankton and detritus.

After several years in freshwater habitats, the larvae undergo a metamorphosis that allows young, post-metamorphic lampreys to migrate to the sea or lakes, and start the adult hematophagous method of feeding. Some individuals start hematophagous feeding in the river before migrating to the sea, where sea lampreys prey on a wide variety of fish.

The lamprey uses its suction cup-like mouth to attach itself to the skin of a fish and rasps away tissue with its sharp, probing tongue and keratinized teeth. A fluid produced in the lamprey&#x27;s mouth, called &quot;lamphredin&quot;, prevents the victim&#x27;s blood from clotting. Victims typically die from excessive blood loss or infection. After one year of hematophagous feeding, lampreys return to the river to spawn and die, a year and a half after the completion of metamorphosis.

Lampreys are considered a delicacy in some parts of Europe, and are seasonally available in France, Spain, and Portugal. They are served pickled in Finland. Mostly known for preparing cooked or grilled river lamprey, the sea lamprey occasionally is caught in the rivers of Latvia as well together with river lampreys.

== Physiology ==
Due to its lifecycle that switches between fresh and salt water, the sea lamprey is adapted to tolerate a wide range of salinities. Cell membranes on the surface of the gills are major contributors to ionoregulation. Changes in membrane composition influence the movement of different ions across the membrane, changing amounts of components to change the membranes&#x27; environment. In some instances, the sea lamprey has adapted to living exclusively in fresh water, as evidenced by the population in the Great Lakes.

As the larvae (called ammocoetes) move towards the oceans, the ratio between saturated fatty acids (SFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the gills shifts towards higher amounts of SFA, as they affect the fluidity of the membrane, and higher levels of SFA lead to a decrease in permeability compared to PUFA. Lamprey ammocoetes have a relatively narrow range of salinity tolerance, but become better able to withstand wider ranges of salinity concentrations as they reach later stages of life. Tight regulation of Na/K-ATPase and an overall decrease in expression of H-ATPase assists in regulating the lamprey&#x27;s internal fluid and ion balance as it moves to areas of higher salinity.

Lampreys also maintain acid-base homeostasis. When introduced to higher levels of acids, they are able to excrete excess acids at higher rates than most other saltwater fishes, and in much shorter times, with the majority of the transfer of ions occurring at the gill surface.

Sea lampreys parasitize other fishes for their diet, including elasmobranchs such as sharks and rays, which have naturally high levels of urea in their blood. Urea is toxic to most fishes in high concentrations, and is usually excreted immediately. Lampreys are able to tolerate much higher concentrations than most other fish and excrete it at extremely high rates, obtained from ingested blood. Trimethylamine oxides present in ingested elasmobranch blood aid in counteracting the detrimental effects of high urea concentration in the lamprey&#x27;s bloodstream as it feeds.

===Immunology===
Two presumptive apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC)s expressed in lymphocytes—CDA1 and CDA2—have been discovered in &quot;P. marinus&quot;.

==Genetics==
The genome of &quot;Petromyzon marinus&quot; was sequenced in 2013. This sequencing effort revealed that the lamprey has unusual guanine-cytosine content and amino acid usage patterns compared to other vertebrates. The full sequence and annotation of the lamprey genome is available on the Ensembl genome browser.

The lamprey genome may serve as a model for developmental biology and evolution studies involving transposition of repetitive sequences. The lamprey genome undergoes drastic rearrangements during early embryogenesis in which about 20% of the germline DNA from somatic tissues is shed. The genome is highly repetitive. About 35% of the current genome assembly is composed of repetitive elements with high sequence identity. Northern lampreys have the highest number of chromosomes (164–174) among vertebrates.

Two genes important to immune function—CDA1 and CDA2—were first discovered in &quot;P. marinus&quot; and then found to be conserved across lampreys. See §Immunology above.

==Invasive species==
Sea lampreys are considered a pest in the Great Lakes region. Whether it is native to Lake Ontario, where it was first noticed in the 1830s, or whether it was introduced through the Erie Canal which opened in 1825 was not clear as of 2007. The species was first contained to Lake Ontario due to the natural barrier formed by Niagara Falls. However, after the Welland Canal was built in the late 1800s - early 1900s, they were able to bypass Niagara Falls and invade the remaining Great Lakes: Lakes Erie (1921), Michigan (1936), Huron (1937), and Superior (1938), where it decimated indigenous fish populations in the 1930s and 1940s.

In its original habitats, the sea lamprey coevolved with its hosts, and those hosts evolved a measure of resistance to the sea lampreys. However, in the Great Lakes, the sea lamprey attacks native fish such as lake trout, lake whitefish, chub, and lake herring, which historically did not face sea lampreys. Elimination of these predators allowed the alewife, another invasive species, to explode in population, with adverse effects on many native fish species.

The lake trout plays a vital role in the Lake Superior ecosystem. The lake trout has traditionally been considered an apex predator, which means that it has no predators. The sea lamprey is an aggressive predator by nature, which gives it a competitive advantage in a lake system where it has no predators and its prey lacks defenses against it. The sea lamprey played a large role in the destruction of the Lake Superior trout population. Lamprey introduction along with poor, unsustainable fishing practices caused the lake trout populations to decline drastically. The relationship between predators and prey in the Great Lakes ecosystem then became unbalanced. Each individual sea lamprey has the potential of killing 40 pounds of fish through its 12–18 month feeding period.

===Efforts at control===

Control efforts, including electric current and chemical lampricides have met with varied success. The control programs are carried out under the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, a joint Canada–U.S. body, specifically by the agents of the Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

Genetic researchers have mapped the sea lamprey&#x27;s genome in the hope of finding out more about evolution; scientists trying to eliminate the Great Lakes problem are coordinating with these genetic scientists, hoping to find out more about its immune system and fitting it into its place in the phylogenetic tree.

Researchers from Michigan State University have teamed up with others from the Universities of Minnesota, Guelph, and Wisconsin, and others in a research effort into newly synthesized pheromones. These are believed to have independent influences on the sea lamprey behavior. One group of pheromones serves a migratory function in that when they are made by larvae, they are thought to lure maturing adults into streams with suitable spawning habitat. Sex pheromones emitted from males are capable of luring females long distances to specific locations. These pheromones are both several different compounds thought to elicit different behaviors that collectively influence the lampreys to exhibit migratory or spawning behaviors. Scientists are trying to characterize the function of each pheromone, and each part of the molecules, to determine if they can be used in a targeted effort at environmentally friendly lamprey control. However, as of 2017, the most effective control measures still involve the application of (3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol), or TFM, a selective pesticide, into rivers. no lampricide resistance has been detected in the Great Lakes. Further research and combined use of multiple control methods are needed to forestall future development of resistance.

Another technique used in the prevention of lamprey population growth is the use of barriers in major reproduction streams of high value to the lamprey. The purpose of the barriers is to block their upstream migration to reduce reproduction. The issue with these barriers is that other aquatic species are also inhibited by this barrier. Fish that use tributaries are impeded from traveling upstream to spawn. To account for this, barriers have been altered and designed to allow the passage of most fish species, but still impede others.

====Restoration====
The intent of lamprey control programs is a safer habitat and a healthier population growth for vulnerable native fish species such as lake trout. The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) has taken a different path to this same goal by introducing sea lampreys to freshwater rivers and lakes of the Connecticut River watershed, and providing easier access around dams and other barriers for the lampreys to reach spawning sites high upstream. After preying on larger fish at sea, the adult lampreys migrate up the rivers to spawn, whereupon they quickly die of natural causes and decompose, thus providing a food source for the native freshwater fish species.

<text>The Scullin ministry (Labor) was the 19th ministry of the Government of Australia. It was led by the country&#x27;s 9th Prime Minister, James Scullin. The Scullin ministry succeeded the Third Bruce ministry, which dissolved on 22 October 1929 following the federal election that took place on 12 October which saw Labor defeat Stanley Bruce&#x27;s Nationalist–Country Coalition. The ministry was replaced by the First Lyons ministry on 6 January 1932 following the federal election that took place in December which saw the United Australia Party defeat Labor. , it remains the most recent government to have lost an election after a single term in office.

Frank Forde, who died in 1983, was the last surviving member of the Scullin ministry; Forde was also the last surviving minister of the Curtin government, the Forde government, and the First Chifley ministry.

<doc id="1202740" wikidata="Q4591320" url="?curid=1202740" title="1996 Democratic National Convention">
<text>The 1996 Democratic National Convention was held at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, from August 26 to August 29, 1996. President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were nominated for reelection. It was the first national convention of either party to be held in Chicago since the riots of the 1968 Democratic convention, and until 2024, was the most recent presidential convention held in the city by either major party.

==Site selection==

Chicago, Kansas City, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York, and San Antonio were originally considered as possible host cities. Los Angeles withdrew its bid after the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Kansas City would also withdraw.

On August 4, 1994, it was announced that Chicago had beaten out the other finalist, San Antonio, for the right to host the convention. This would mark the first time that Chicago hosted a major presidential year political convention since the violent 1968 Democratic National Convention, and the first time a political convention was held in the United Center, which had been recently completed.

During the bidding for the convention, Chicago was seen as a frontrunner. One dynamic in Chicago&#x27;s favor was that chairman of the Democratic National Committee David Wilhelm had strong connections to the city. Also seen as helpful to Chicago&#x27;s odds was the goodwill that Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley had earned with President Clinton by helping to lobby Chicago-area congressmen to support the North American Free Trade Agreement. The fact that First Lady Hillary Clinton was raised in the Chicago suburbs was seen as helpful. Bill Clinton&#x27;s close relationship with Mayor Daley&#x27;s brother William M. Daley and Clinton&#x27;s appreciation of Mayor Daley&#x27;s endorsement of him during the 1992 Democratic Party presidential primaries were also seen as aiding Chicago&#x27;s chances. Additionally, heading into 1996, Illinois was projected to be a key &quot;battleground state&quot;.

Of the bid cities, Chicago&#x27;s proposed the largest funding package, proposing that its host committee would raise $32 million for the convention.

This was the 25th major party convention to be held in Chicago. Chicago has held more major party conventions than any other city.

===Bids===
==Preparations and logistics==
Ahead of the convention, in order to project a positive image of the city, Mayor Daley dedicated a large amount funding towards planting new trees and decorative potted flowers throughout the West Loop area in which the convention would be held as well as in the city&#x27;s downtown. The convention came at a time where changes and beautification were underway in the West Loop, including the repaving of roads, the addition of decorative planters, and the installation of ornate street lamps. The Madison Street overpass above the Kennedy Expressway was decorated with red white and blue stars. Greektown underwent a streetscape enhancement project. In the weeks ahead of the convention, a demolition project on five buildings of the Henry Horner Homes near the venue was completed. City officials claime that the timing of some of the enhancements to the West Loop was coincidental. Temporary decorations were also added, including stickers advertising the convention on 2,000 street signs.

A temporary convention-oriented bus route was established between the United Center and locations in The Loop. Events related to the convention were held in venues throughout Chicago in order to showcase the city. Hundreds of events related to the convention were held.

The convention introduced a new style four-screen speech prompting system for speakers consisting of two glass teleprompters, accompanied by an inset lectern monitor, and for the first time, a large under-camera confidence monitor.

==Notable speakers==
The convention&#x27;s keynote speaker was Governor Evan Bayh of Indiana. The nomination speech was given by Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut. Other notable speakers included former New York governor Mario Cuomo, First Lady of the United States Hillary Rodham Clinton, actor Christopher Reeve, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, and other Senators Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, and John Kerry and Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts.

With Clinton&#x27;s wife, Hillary, speaking at the Democratic convention, and his opponent Bob Dole&#x27;s wife Elizabeth Dole having spoken at the Republican convention, 1996 became the year in which it became established practice that both major party candidates spouses speak at their party&#x27;s convention.

==Clinton&#x27;s renomination speech==
Clinton&#x27;s speech on August 29 included his vision for the next decade, included tax cuts for the middle-class, 20 million more jobs, a strong defense with cuts in the military, but a strong presence of peacemaking troops, new military weapons and tanks, welfare reform goals for states and communities, and a peaceful transition for the Middle East.

==Refusal of delegates to Lyndon LaRouche==
Lyndon LaRouche had run for president through multiple parties over multiple election cycles. In 1996, he ran for the nomination of the Democratic party, despite the Chair of the Democratic National Party ruling that Lyndon LaRouche &quot;is not to be considered a qualified candidate for nomination of the Democratic Party for President&quot; before the primaries began. In subsequent primaries LaRouche received enough votes in Louisiana and Virginia to get one delegate from each state. When the state parties refused to award the delegates, LaRouche sued in federal court, claiming a violation of the Voting Rights Act. After losing in the district court, the case was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which sustained the lower court.

==Voting==
Clinton was nominated unanimously for a second term and Vice President Al Gore by voice vote.

The Balloting:
Clinton and Gore went on to defeat Bob Dole and Jack Kemp in the November general election in an Electoral College landslide with a substantial popular vote margin.

==Notable events==
On August 28, Civil Rights Movement historian Randy Kryn and 10 others were arrested by the Federal Protective Service while doing a demonstration.

In the middle of the convention, many of the delegates danced to the song &quot;Macarena&quot;. Al Gore famously danced to the song while standing still.

The original Broadway cast of &quot;Rent&quot; performed &quot;Seasons of Love&quot; at the end of the convention.

Taste of Chicago, a group of restaurants who have an annual street festival, catered the press area.

==Reception==
Chicago&#x27;s performance as a convention host city was regarded to have been successful.

<doc id="1202743" wikidata="Q950810" url="?curid=1202743" title="Lamport, Northamptonshire">
<text>Lamport is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire, England. The village is on the A508, about south of Market Harborough and north of Northampton. Nearby is Lamport Hall. At the time of the 2001 census, the parish&#x27;s population was 207 people, including Hanging Houghton and increasing to 225 at the 2011 Census.

The name of the village means &#x27;Long town&#x27;.

Between 1859 and 1960, the village was served by Lamport railway station just north of the village running trains south to Northampton and north to Market Harborough. This is now part of the heritage Northampton &amp; Lamport Railway, but as of 2018 the tracks have not yet been rebuilt as far as Lamport.

The parish Church of All Saints is a Grade I listed building. It has a medieval tower but the remainder was built in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. The 19th century part is the south vestry, designed by G.F. Bodley. The church contains monuments to members of the Isham family who lived at Lamport Hall from 1560 to 1976. Lamport Hall, the seat of the Isham baronets for around 350 years, stands opposite the church.

The Carnegie Medal-winning children&#x27;s author Denys Watkins-Pitchford, who wrote under the pseudonym BB, was born in Lamport.

== Iron Ore Quarrying ==
The first iron ore quarry at Lamport was north of the village. It was close to the Draughton Road, on the west side of that road. It was connected to the railway by a standard gauge steam operated tramway. The junction was at the north end of the station. The ore was taken by the tramway and railway to blast furnaces at Finedon. This quarry operated from 1882 to 1890. Its position is marked by a crescent shaped depression in a field. The tramway&#x27;s engine shed remains.

Ore was quarried close to Hanging Houghton and Scaldwell from about 1912. By 1924 these quarries were working close to the junction of the main Northampton to Lamport road and the road to Scaldwell. The ore was at that time taken a short distance by narrow gauge (3 feet) tramway and then aerial ropeway to sidings on the railway between Brixworth and Hanging Houghton. This quarry to the north and east of the road junction operated until 1927 and again from 1936 to 1963. The narrow gauge tramway was replaced by a standard gauge line in 1942 which operated direct to the sidings without the need to tranship the ore onto the aerial ropeway. During this time the working face moved gradually northwards just to the east of the main road and Lamport Hall until the final workings were close to the village. In 1963 the final gullet was actually in the parish of Scaldwell, but it was very close to Lamport village to the west of the Lamport to Scaldwell road. Steam and later diesel quarrying machines were used and in 1942 an electric dragline was introduced. The tramways were worked by steam locomotives. The tramways and quarries have been landscaped and little is now visible except that the level of the fields quarried is lower than the roads.

== Fitness programme ==
In 2017 a 3-step fitness programme was launched at Lamport Manor for people over-50.

<doc id="1202747" wikidata="Q188879" url="?curid=1202747" title="Atlantic salmon">
<text>The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae. It is the third largest of the Salmonidae, behind Siberian taimen and Pacific Chinook salmon, growing up to a meter in length. Atlantic salmon are found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and in rivers that flow into it. Most populations are anadromous, hatching in streams and rivers but moving out to sea as they grow where they mature, after which the adults seasonally move upstream again to spawn.

When the mature fish re-enter rivers to spawn, they change in colour and appearance. Some populations of this fish only migrate to large lakes, and are &quot;landlocked&quot;, spending their entire lives in freshwater. Such populations are found throughout the range of the species. Unlike Pacific species of salmon, &quot;S. salar&quot; is iteroparous, which means it can survive spawning and return to sea to repeat the process again in another year with 5–10% returning to the sea to spawn again. Such individuals can grow to extremely large sizes, although they are rare. The different life stages of the fish are known by many different names in English: alevin, fry, parr and smolt.

Atlantic salmon meat is a particularly nutritious food and is considered one of the more refined types of fish meat in many cultures. As such it features in numerous popular traditional cuisines and can fetch a higher price than some other fish. It has thus long been the target of recreational and commercial fishing, and this, as well as habitat destruction, has impacted the population in some areas. As a result, the species is the subject of conservation efforts in several countries, which appear to have been somewhat successful since the 2000s. Techniques to farm this species using aquacultural methods have also been developed, and at present it is farmed in great numbers in many countries, with Norway producing over 50% of the farmed world supply.Although this is now a viable alternative to wild-caught fish, farming methods have attracted criticism from environmentalists.

==Nomenclature==
The Atlantic salmon was given its scientific binomial name by Swedish zoologist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The name, &quot;Salmo salar&quot;, derives from the Latin &quot;salmo&quot;, meaning salmon, and &quot;salar&quot;, meaning leaper, according to M. Barton, but more likely meaning &quot;resident of salt water&quot; . Lewis and Short&#x27;s Latin Dictionary (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1879) translates &quot;salar&quot; as a kind of trout from its use in the &quot;Idylls&quot; of the poet Ausonius (4th century CE). Later, the differently coloured smolts were found to be the same species.

Other names used for the Atlantic salmon are: bay salmon, black salmon, caplin-scull salmon, fiddler, sebago salmon, silver salmon, outside salmon and winnish. At different points in their maturation and life cycle, they are known as parr, smolt, grilse, grilt, kelt, slink, and spring salmon. Atlantic salmon that do not journey to sea are known as landlocked salmon (or in North America).

==Description==
Atlantic salmon are the largest species in their genus, &quot;Salmo&quot;. After two years at sea, the fish average in length and in weight. But specimens that spend four or more winters feeding at sea can be much larger. An Atlantic salmon netted in 1960 in Scotland, in the estuary of the river Hope, weighed , the heaviest recorded in all available literature. Another netted in 1925 in Norway measured in length, the longest Atlantic salmon on record.

The colouration of young Atlantic salmon does not resemble the adult stage. While they live in fresh water, they have blue and red spots. At maturity, they take on a silver-blue sheen. The easiest way of identifying them as an adult is by the black spots predominantly above the lateral line, though the caudal fin is usually unspotted. When they reproduce, males take on a slight green or red colouration. The salmon has a body, and well-developed teeth. All fins, except the adipose fin, are bordered with black.
==Distribution and habitat==
The natural breeding grounds of Atlantic salmon are rivers in Europe and the northeastern coast of North America. In Europe, Atlantic salmon are still found as far south as Spain, and as far north as Russia. Because of sport-fishing, some of the species&#x27; southern populations in northern Spain are growing smaller. The species distribution is easily influenced by changes in freshwater habitat and climate. Atlantic salmon are a cold-water fish species and are particularly sensitive to changes in water temperature.

The Housatonic River, and its Naugatuck River tributary, hosted the southernmost Atlantic salmon spawning runs in the United States. However, there is a 1609 account by Henry Hudson that Atlantic salmon once ran up the Hudson River. In addition, fish scale evidence dating to 10,000 years BP places Atlantic salmon in a coastal New Jersey pond.

Two publications from 1988 and 1996 questioned the notion that Atlantic salmon were prehistorically plentiful in New England, when the climate was warmer as it is now. This argument was primarily based on a paucity of bone data in archaeological sites relative to other fish species, and the assertion that historical claims of abundance may have been exaggerated. This argument was later challenged in another paper which claimed that lack of archaeological bone fragments could be explained by salmon bones being rare at sites that still have large salmon runs and that salmonid bones in general are poorly recovered relative to other fish species.

Atlantic salmon populations were significantly reduced in the United States following European settlement. The fur trade, timber harvesting, dams and mills and agriculture degraded freshwater habitats and lowered the carrying capacity of most North American streams. Beaver populations were trapped to near-extinction by 1800, and log drives and clear-cutting further exacerbated stream erosion and habitat loss. As timber and fur gave way to agriculture, freshwater Atlantic salmon habitat was further compromised. According to historian D.W. Dunfield (1985) &quot;over half of the historical Atlantic salmon runs had been lost in North America by 1850&quot;. As early as 1798, a bill for the preservation of Atlantic Salmon was introduced in Canadian Parliament, to protect populations in Lake Ontario. In the Gulf Region of Nova Scotia it was reported that 31 of the 33 Atlantic salmon streams were blocked off by lumber dams, leading to the extirpation of early-run fish in many watersheds. The inshore Atlantic salmon fishery became a major export of the New World, with major fishing operations establishing along the shores of major river systems. The southernmost populations were the first to disappear.

Young salmon spend one to four years in their natal river. When they are large enough (c. ), they smoltify, changing camouflage from stream-adapted with large, gray spots to sea-adapted with shiny sides. They also undergo some endocrinological changes to adapt to osmotic differences between fresh water and seawater habitat. When smoltification is complete, the parr (young fish) now begin to swim with the current instead of against it. With this behavioral change, the fish are now referred to as smolt. When the smolt reach the sea, they follow sea surface currents and feed on plankton or fry from other fish species such as herring. During their time at sea, they can sense the change in the Earth magnetic field through iron in their lateral line.

When they have had a year of good growth, they will move to the sea surface currents that transport them back to their natal river. It is a major misconception that salmon swim thousands of kilometres at sea; instead they surf through sea surface currents. It is possible they find their natal river by smell, although this is not confirmed; only 5% of Atlantic salmon go up the wrong river. The range of an individual Atlantic salmon can thus be the river where they are born and the sea surface currents that are connected to that river in a circular path.

Wild salmon continued to disappear from many rivers during the twentieth century due to overfishing and habitat change.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
Young salmon begin a feeding response within a few days. After the yolk sac is absorbed by the body, they begin to hunt. Juveniles start with tiny invertebrates, but as they mature, they may occasionally eat small fish. During this time, they hunt both in the substrate and in the current. Some have been known to eat salmon eggs. Plankton such as euphausiids are important food for pre-grilse but amphipods and decapods are also consumed. The most commonly eaten foods include caddisflies, blackflies, mayflies, stoneflies, and chironomids, as well as terrestrial insects.

As adults, the salmon prefer capelin as their meal of choice. Capelin are elongated silvery fish that grow up to long. Other fish consumed include herring, alewives, smelts, scomberids, sand lance, and small cod.

===Behavior===
Fry and parr have been said to be territorial, but evidence showing them to guard territories is inconclusive. While they may occasionally be aggressive towards each other, the social hierarchy is still unclear. Many have been found to school, especially when leaving the estuary.

Adult Atlantic salmon are considered much more aggressive than other salmon, and are more likely to attack other fish than others.

===Life stages===

Most Atlantic salmon follow an anadromous migration pattern, in that they undergo their greatest feeding and growth in saltwater; however, adults return to spawn in native freshwater streams where the eggs hatch and juveniles grow through several distinct stages.

Atlantic salmon do not require saltwater. Numerous examples of fully freshwater (i.e., &quot;landlocked&quot;) populations of the species exist throughout the Northern Hemisphere, including a now extinct population in Lake Ontario, which has been shown in recent studies to have spent its entire life cycle in the watershed of the lake. In North America, the landlocked strains are frequently known as &quot;ouananiche&quot;.

====Freshwater phase====
The freshwater phases of Atlantic salmon vary between two and eight years, according to river location. While the young in southern rivers, such as those to the English Channel, are only one year old when they leave, those further north, such as in Scottish rivers, can be over four years old, and in Ungava Bay, northern Quebec, smolts as old as eight years have been encountered.

The first phase is the alevin stage, when the fish stay in the breeding ground and use the remaining nutrients in their yolk sacs. During this developmental stage, their young gills develop and they become active hunters. Next is the fry stage, where the fish grow and subsequently leave the breeding ground in search of food. During this time, they move to areas with higher prey concentration. The final freshwater stage is when they develop into parr, in which they prepare for the trek to the Atlantic Ocean.

During these times, the Atlantic salmon are very susceptible to predation. Nearly 40% are eaten by trout alone. Other predators include other fish and birds. Egg and juvenile survival is dependent on habitat quality as Atlantic salmon are sensitive to ecological change.

====Saltwater phases====
When parr develop into smolt, they begin the trip to the ocean, which predominantly happens between March and June. Migration allows acclimation to the changing salinity. Once ready, young smolt leave, preferring an .

Having left their natal streams, they experience a period of rapid growth during the one to four years they live in the ocean. Typically, Atlantic salmon migrate from their home streams to an area on the continental plate off West Greenland. During this time, they face predation from humans, seals, Greenland sharks, skate, cod, and halibut. Some dolphins have been noticed playing with dead salmon, but it is still unclear whether they consume them.

Once large enough, Atlantic salmon change into the grilse phase, when they become ready to return to the same freshwater tributary they departed from as smolts. After returning to their natal streams, the salmon will cease eating altogether prior to spawning. Although largely unknown, odor – the exact chemical signature of that stream – may play an important role in how salmon return to the area where they hatched. Once heavier than about 250 g, the fish no longer become prey for birds and many fish, although seals do prey upon them. Grey and common seals commonly eat Atlantic salmon. Survivability to this stage has been estimated at between 14 and 53%.

===Breeding===

Atlantic salmon breed in the rivers of Western Europe from northern Portugal north to Norway, Iceland, and Greenland, and the east coast of North America from Connecticut in the United States north to northern Labrador and Arctic Canada.

The species constructs a nest or &quot;redd&quot; in the gravel bed of a stream. The female creates a powerful downdraught of water with her tail near the gravel to excavate a depression. After she and a male fish have eggs and milt (sperm), respectively, upstream of the depression, the female again uses her tail, this time to shift gravel to cover the eggs and milt which have lodged in the depression.

Unlike the various Pacific salmon species which die after spawning (semelparous), the Atlantic salmon is iteroparous, which means the fish may recondition themselves and return to the sea to repeat the migration and spawning pattern several times, although most spawn only once or twice. Migration and spawning exact an enormous physiological toll on individuals, such that repeat spawners are the exception rather than the norm. Atlantic salmon show high diversity in age of maturity and may mature as parr, one- to five-sea-winter fish, and in rare instances, at older sea ages. This variety of ages can occur in the same population, constituting a &#x27;bet hedging&#x27; strategy against variation in stream flows. So in a drought year, some fish of a given age will not return to spawn, allowing that generation other, wetter years in which to spawn.

====Hybridization====
When in shared breeding habitats, Atlantic salmon will hybridize with brown trout (&quot;Salmo trutta&quot;). Hybrids between Atlantic salmon and brown trout were detected in two of four watersheds studied in northern Spain. The proportions of hybrids in samples of salmon ranged from 0 to 7-7% but these proportions were not significantly homogeneous among locations, resulting in a mean hybridization rate of 2-3%. This is the highest rate of natural hybridization so far reported and is significantly greater than rates observed elsewhere in Europe.

===Beaver impact===
The decline in anadromous salmonid species over the last two to three centuries is correlated with the decline in the North American beaver and European beaver, although some fish and game departments continue to advocate removal of beaver dams as potential barriers to spawning runs. Migration of adult Atlantic salmon may be limited by beaver dams during periods of low stream flows, but the presence of juvenile salmon upstream of the dams suggests they are penetrated by parr. Downstream migration of Atlantic salmon smolts was similarly unaffected by beaver dams, even in periods of low flows.

In a 2003 study, Atlantic salmon and sea-run brown trout spawning in the Numedalslågen River and 51 of its tributaries in southeastern Norway was unhindered by beavers. In a restored, third-order stream in northern Nova Scotia, beaver dams generally posed no barrier to Atlantic salmon migration except in the smallest upstream reaches in years of low flow where pools were not deep enough to enable the fish to leap the dam or without a column of water over-topping the dam for the fish to swim up.

The importance of winter habitat to salmonids afforded by beaver ponds may be especially important in streams of northerly latitudes without deep pools where ice cover makes contact with the bottom of shallow streams. In addition, the up to eight-year-long residence time of juveniles in freshwater may make beaver-created permanent summer pools a crucial success factor for Atlantic salmon populations. In fact, two-year-old Atlantic salmon parr in beaver ponds in eastern Canada showed faster summer growth in length and mass and were in better condition than parr upstream or downstream from the pond.

==Relationship to humans==

Atlantic salmon is a popular fish for human consumption and is commonly sold fresh, canned, or frozen.

Wood and stone weirs along streams and ponds were used for millennia to harvest salmon in the rivers of New England. European fishermen gillnetted for Atlantic salmon in rivers using hand-made nets for many centuries and gillnetting was also used in early colonial America.

In its natal streams, Atlantic salmon are considered prized recreational fish, pursued by fly anglers during its annual runs. At one time, the species supported an important commercial fishery, but having become endangered throughout its range globally, wild-caught Atlantic salmon are now virtually absent from the market. Instead, nearly all are from aquaculture farms, predominantly in Norway, Chile, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Faroe Islands, Russia and Tasmania in Australia.

===Aquaculture===

Adult male and female fish are anaesthetised; their eggs and sperm are &quot;stripped&quot; after the fish are cleaned and cloth dried. Sperm and eggs are mixed, washed, and placed into freshwater. Adults recover in flowing, clean, well-aerated water. Some researchers have even studied cryopreservation of their eggs.

Fry are generally reared in large freshwater tanks for 12 to 20 months. Once the fish have reached the smolt phase, they are taken out to sea, where they are held for up to two years. During this time, the fish grow and mature in large cages off the coasts of Canada, the US, or parts of Europe.

There are many different commercially available cage designs built to operate in a wide variety of aquatic conditions. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) cages are widely used, with HDPE pipes forming a floating collar ring onto which the fish net pen is secured and suspended in the water below.

Advancements in cage technologies have allowed for reduction in fish escapes, improvement in growing conditions, and maximization of aquaculture production volume per unit area of growing space.

====Controversy====
Farmed Atlantic salmon are known to occasionally escape from cages and enter the habitat of wild populations. Interbreeding between escaped farm fish and wild fish decreases genetic diversity and introduces &quot;the potential to genetically alter native populations, reduce local adaptation and negatively affect population viability and character&quot;. A study in 2000 demonstrated that the genes of farmed Atlantic salmon intrude wild populations mainly through wild males breeding with farmed females, though farmed specimens showed reduced capacity for breeding success overall compared to their wild counterparts. Further study in 2018 discovered extensive cross-breeding of wild and farmed Atlantic salmon in the Northwest Atlantic, showing that 27.1% of fish in 17 out of 18 rivers examined are artificially stocked or hybrids. Farming of Atlantic salmon in open cages at sea has also been linked, at least in part, to a decline in wild stocks attributed to the passing of parasites from farmed to wild individuals.

On the west coast of the United States and Canada, aquaculturists are generally under scrutiny to ensure that non-native Atlantic salmon cannot escape from their open-net pens, however occasional incidents of escape have been documented. During one incident in 2017, for example, up to 300,000 potentially invasive Atlantic salmon escaped a farm among the San Juan Islands in Puget Sound, Washington. Washington went on in 2019 to implement a gradual phase out of salmon farming to be completed by 2025.
Despite being the source of considerable controversy, the likelihood of escaped Atlantic salmon establishing an invasive presence in the Pacific Northwest is considered minimal, largely because a number of 20th century efforts aimed at deliberately introducing them to the region were ultimately unsuccessful. From 1905 until 1935, for example, in excess of 8.6 million Atlantic salmon of various life stages (predominantly advanced fry) were intentionally introduced to more than 60 individual British Columbia lakes and streams. Historical records indicate, in a few instances, mature sea-run Atlantic salmon were captured in the Cowichan River; however, a self-sustaining population never materialized. Similarly unsuccessful results were realized after deliberate attempts at introduction by Washington as late as the 1980s. Consequently, environmental assessments by the US National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and the BC Environmental Assessment Office have concluded the potential risk of Atlantic salmon colonization in the Pacific Northwest is low.

====Future prospects====
A study of Næve et al. (2022) estimated the impact of 50 years of genetic selection and tried to predict the impact it could have until 2050. In order to do this, a common garden experiment was used to model and simulate past and future effects for 11 generations of genetic selection of increased growth rate in Atlantic salmon. To model the contribution that breeding has made in the industry from generation 0 (harvested in 1975– 1978) to generation 11 (harvested in 2017 – 2019), and to simulate growth until 2050 (generation 24), the Norwegian salmon aquaculture production between 2016 and 2019 was used as a base case. The simulation of the expected growth until 2050 (generation 24) gave five different scenarios : Historical (H1), Forecast 1 (F1), Forecast 2 (F2), Forecast 3 (F3) and Forecast 4 (F4). Changes in thermal growth coefficient (TGC) per generation were used in the model to simulate the differences in the five scenarios. The genetic data, H1, and the most conservative forecast scenario, F1, simulate what can be expected in 2050 if the trend from generation 0 through 11 is maintained. The following forecast scenarios assume a greater increase in genetic growth with a larger increase in the TGC in the generations to come. In the next two generations, more advanced selection methods such as marker assisted selection (from generation 10) and genomic selection (from generation 11) were implemented. This resulted in increased gain in selection for growth and simulated F2 and F3. The most progressive scenario, F4, aimed at exploring the effect in the industry when the full genetic potential is utilized. This assumes a further development of advanced techniques in the years to come.
The authors of the article found that the daily yield of the biomass increased with increasing generations in the historic and forecast scenarios. Further, the production time in seawater to reach the harvest weight of 5100 g is expected to be reduced by 53% in 2050. When production time can be reduced, this will also reduce e.g. time at risk of diseases. In the most progressive scenario, mortality in seawater was expected to be reduced by up to 50%. Further, the authors found that production per license can increase by up to 121%. Additionally, 77% of the new volume needed to achieve five million tonnes in 2050, may be provided by genomic selection. However, one should keep in mind that this article was published by the firm Aquagen, and can possibly be biased and too optimistic.

==Conservation==
The IUCN rates this as a common species with a conservation status of &quot;least concern&quot;, however it has been 25 years since the IUCN has released this status. A more recent regional assessment revealed that the European population of this species is vulnerable, and this might be the same or a similar status globally. Location-specific assessments have shown population declines across parts of the Atlantic Salmon&#x27;s natural range, with populations along the coast of Maine and the Inner Bay of Fundy now listed as &quot;endangered&quot; under the Endangered Species Act, and the Canadian Species at Risk Act, respectively.

Human activities have impacted salmon populations across parts of its range. The major threats are from overfishing and habitat change. Salmon decline in Lake Ontario goes back to the 18th–19th centuries, due to logging and soil erosion, as well as dam and mill construction. By 1896, the species was declared extirpated from the lake.

In the 1950s, salmon from rivers in the United States and Canada, as well as from Europe, were discovered to gather in the sea around Greenland and the Faroe Islands. A commercial fishing industry was established, taking salmon using drift nets. After an initial series of record annual catches, the numbers crashed; between 1979 and 1990, catches fell from four million to 700,000.

Beginning around 1990, the rates of Atlantic salmon mortality at sea more than doubled in the western Atlantic. Rivers of the coast of Maine, southern New Brunswick and much of mainland Nova Scotia saw runs drop precipitously, and even disappear. An international effort to study the increased mortality rate was organized by the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization. In 2000 the numbers of Atlantic salmon dropped to very low levels in Newfoundland, Canada. In 2007 at least one sport fishing organization from Iceland and Scandinavia blamed less fish caught by recreational anglers on overfishing at sea, and thus created the North Atlantic Salmon Fund to buy commercial quotas in the Atlantic from commercial fishermen in an effort to preserve wild &quot;Salmo salar&quot; stocks.

Possibly because of improvements in ocean feeding grounds, returns in 2008 were very positive. On the Penobscot River in Maine, returns were about 940 in 2007, and by mid-July 2008, the return was 1,938. Similar stories were reported in rivers from Newfoundland to Quebec. In 2011, more than 3,100 salmon returned to the Penobscot, the most since 1986, and nearly 200 ascended the Narraguagus River, up from the low two digits just a decade before.

Recreational fishing of stocked, landlocked Atlantic salmon is now authorized in much of the US and Canada where it occurs in large numbers, but this is subject to regulations in many states or provinces which are designed to maintain the continuity of the species. Strict catch limits, catch and release practices and forced fly fishing are examples of those regulations. However, catch and release angling can be an additional stressor on Atlantic salmon populations, especially when its impacts are combined with the existing pressures of climate change, overfishing, and predation.

===Restoration efforts===

Around the North Atlantic, efforts to restore salmon to their native habitats are underway, with slow progress. Habitat restoration and protection are key to this process, but issues of excessive harvest and competition with farmed and escaped salmon are also primary considerations. In the Great Lakes, Atlantic salmon have been reintroduced, but the percentage of salmon reproducing naturally is very low. Most areas are re-stocked annually. Since the extirpation of Atlantic salmon from Lake Ontario in the late 19th century, the state of New York has stocked its adjoining rivers and tributaries, and in many cases does not allow active fishing.

The province of Ontario started the Atlantic Salmon Restoration Program in 2006, which is one of the largest freshwater conservation programs in North America. It has since stocked Lake Ontario and surrounding tributaries with upwards of 6,000,000 young Atlantic salmon, with efforts growing each year. In New England, many efforts are underway to restore salmon to the region by knocking down obsolete dams and updating others with fish ladders and other techniques that have proven effective in the West with Pacific salmon. There is some success thus far, with populations growing in the Penobscot and Connecticut Rivers. Lake Champlain now has Atlantic salmon. The Atlantic Salmon Federation is involved in restoration efforts along the eastern United States and Canada, where their projects are focused on removing barriers to fish passage and eradicating invasive species.

Recent documented successes in the reintroduction of Atlantic salmon include the following:
* In October 2007, salmon were video-recorded running in Toronto&#x27;s Humber River by the Old Mill.
* A migrating salmon was observed in Ontario&#x27;s Credit River in November 2007.
* As of 2013, there has been some success in establishing Atlantic salmon in Fish Creek, a tributary of Oneida Lake in central New York.
* In November 2015, salmon nests were observed in Connecticut in the Farmington River, a tributary of the Connecticut River where Atlantic salmon had not been observed spawning since &quot;probably the Revolutionary War&quot;. However, both state and federal experts indicated that this find likely represented a dwindling wave of returning stocked fish from massive salmon restoration efforts that had concluded years earlier in 2012. Significant doubt was cast on fish returning to spawn in meaningful numbers after 2017, when the last generation of stocked salmon would return.

===NASCO===
The North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization is an international council made up of Canada, the European Union, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, and the United States, with its headquarters in Edinburgh. It was established in 1983 to help protect Atlantic salmon stocks, through the cooperation between nations. They work to restore habitat and promote conservation of the salmon. In December 2021, NASCO published an updated interactive map of their Rivers Database, showing the stock status of wild Atlantic salmon populations across the species range.

==Legislation==
===England and Wales===
Edward I instituted a penalty for collecting salmon during certain times of the year. His son Edward II continued, regulating the construction of weirs. Enforcement was overseen by those appointed by the justices of the peace. Because of confusing laws and the appointed conservators having little power, most laws were barely enforced.

Based on this, a royal commission was appointed in 1860 to thoroughly investigate the Atlantic salmon and the laws governing the species, resulting in the 1861 Salmon Fisheries Act. The act placed enforcement of the laws under the Home Office&#x27;s control, but it was later transferred to the Board of Trade, and then later to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. Another act passed in 1865 imposed charges to fish and catch limits. It also caused the formation of local boards having jurisdiction over a certain river. The next significant act, passed in 1907, allowed the board to charge &#x27;duties&#x27; to catch other freshwater fish, including trout.

Despite legislation, board effects decreased until, in 1948, the River Boards Act gave authority of all freshwater fish and the prevention of pollution to one board per river. In total, it created 32 boards. In 1974, the 32 boards, which by then were integrated into regional river authorities, were reduced to 10 regional water authorities (RWAs). Although only the Northumbrian Water Authority, Welsh National Water Development Authority, Northwest Water Authority and Southwest Water Authority had significant salmon populations, all ten also regulated and conserved trout and freshwater eel fisheries

The Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act was passed in 1975. Among other things, it regulated fishing licences, seasons, and size limits, and banned obstructing the salmon&#x27;s migratory paths.

===Scotland===
Salmon was greatly valued in medieval Scotland, and various fishing methods, including the use of weirs, cruives, and nets, were used to catch the fish. Fishing for salmon was heavily regulated in order to conserve the resource. In 1318, King Robert I enacted legislation setting a minimum size for cruives, &quot;so that no fry of fish are impeded from ascending and descending...&quot; Laws on catching fish upon royal lands were frequently updated, demonstrating their importance. Because the fish were held in such high regard, poachers were severely punished; a person twice convicted of poaching salmon on a royal estate could be sentenced to death. The export of salmon was economically important in Aberdeen; beginning in the 15th century, the fish could be preserved through salting and barreling, allowing them to be exported abroad, including as far away as the Baltic. The volume of the early Scottish salmon trade is impossible to determine, since surviving custom records date only from the 1420 onward, and since Aberdeen burgesses enjoyed an exemption on salmon customs until the 1530s.

During the 15th century, many laws were passed; many regulated fishing times, and worked to ensure smolts could safely pass downstream. James III even closed a meal mill because of its history of killing fish attracted to the wheel.

More recent legislation has established commissioners who manage districts. Furthermore, the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act in 1951 required the Secretary of State be given data about the catches of salmon and trout to help establish catch limits.

===United States===
Commercial and recreational fishing of wild, anadromous Atlantic salmon is prohibited in the United States. Several populations of Atlantic salmon are in serious decline, and are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Currently, runs of 11 rivers in Maine are on the list – Kennebec, Androscoggin, Penobscot, Sheepscot, Ducktrap, Cove Brook, Pleasant, Narraguagus, Machias, East Machias and Dennys. The Penobscot River is the &quot;anchor river&quot; for Atlantic salmon populations in the US. Returning fish in 2008 were around 2,000, more than double the 2007 return of 940.

Section 9 of the ESA makes it illegal to take an endangered species of fish or wildlife. The definition of &quot;take&quot; is to &quot;harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct&quot;.

===Canada===
The federal government has prime responsibility for protecting the Atlantic salmon, but over the last generation, effort has continued to shift management as much as possible to provincial authorities through memoranda of understanding, for example. A new Atlantic salmon policy is in the works, and in the past three years, the government has attempted to pass a new version of the century-old Fisheries Act through Parliament.

Federal legislation regarding at-risk populations is weak. Inner Bay of Fundy Atlantic salmon runs were declared endangered in 2000. A recovery and action plan is in place.

Nongovernmental organizations, such as the Atlantic Salmon Federation, constantly demand for improvements in management, and for initiatives to be considered. For example, the ASF and the Nova Scotia Salmon Association desire the use of technology for mitigation of acid rain-affected rivers such as used in Norway is in 54 Nova Scotia rivers and managed to raise the funds to get a project in place in one river.

In Quebec, the daily catch limit for Atlantic salmon is dependent on the individual river. Some rivers are strictly catch and release with a limit of 3 released fish. Each catch must be declared. Some rivers allow you to keep between 1 or 2 grilse (30 cm to 63 cm), while some of the more prolific rivers (mainly on the north coast) will allow you to keep 1 salmon over 63 cm. The annual catch limit is 4 Atlantic salmon of small size and only 1 of those may be bigger than 63 cm.

In Lake Ontario, the historic populations of Atlantic salmon became extinct, and cross-national efforts have been under way to reintroduce the species, with some areas already having restocked naturally reproducing populations.

<text>The Page ministry (Country–United Australia Coalition) was the 24th ministry of the Government of Australia. It was led by the country&#x27;s 11th Prime Minister, Sir Earle Page. The Page ministry succeeded the Fourth Lyons ministry, which dissolved on 7 April 1939 following the death of former Prime Minister Joseph Lyons - the first of three occasions where a sitting Prime Minister died in office. Since Page was the head of the Country Party, it was a caretaker ministry until the senior partner in the Coalition, the United Australia Party, could elect a new leader. Former Attorney-General Robert Menzies was ultimately elected on 18 April 1939. However, due to the Country Party withdrawing from the Coalition after relations between Page and Menzies broke down, Menzies along with his ministry was not sworn in until 26 April 1939.

John McEwen, who died in 1980, was the last surviving member of the Page ministry; McEwen was also the last surviving member of the Fourth Lyons ministry. Robert Menzies was the last surviving UAP minister.

<text>Lilbourne is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire in England. It is close to the M1 motorway which runs east of the village, and the A5 road, west of the village which marks the boundary with Warwickshire, slightly to the north is the River Avon which marks the boundary with Leicestershire (the three counties meeting at Dow Bridge). At the time of the 2001 census, the parish&#x27;s population was 254 people, increasing to 273 at the 2011 Census, and further to 305 at the 2021 census.

==History==
The villages name means &#x27;Lilla&#x27;s stream&#x27;. Alternatively, the first element might be a stream-name, Lille.
Just outside Lilbourne is the River Avon and the remains of a Norman motte-and-bailey castle. To the west of the castle is the local church, All Saints, which is Grade I listed building dating from the 12th century. A, smaller, motte and bailey castle lies 0.9 km to the north west of the village, at Lilbourne Gorse.

No. 73 Squadron RAF was stationed at nearby RAF Lilbourne during World War I. Lilbourne once had a railway station on the former London and North Western Railway line from Rugby to Market Harborough which closed in 1966 - one of hundreds of rural stations and lines which were closed by the Beeching Axe. The station was situated away from the main part of the village, in fact across the River Avon county border, just within the parish of Catthorpe, Leicestershire.

==Amenities==
Greenhaven Woodland Burial Ground, the first privately owned natural burial ground in the UK, is in Lilbourne.
As with most villages it has its own park which is part of a large Village Hall that is used for Fetes, jumble sales and general meetings as well as private hire events.

Percy Spender, who died in 1985, was the last surviving member of the First Menzies ministry; Spender was also the last surviving minister of the Second Menzies ministry, Third Menzies ministry, Fadden ministry, and the Fourth Menzies ministry.

<text>Little Brington is a village in Brington and civil parish, in West Northamptonshire, England. It has one little school that currently holds around 50 children.

The villages name means &#x27;Farm/settlement connected with Bryni&#x27;.

==Little Brington church==

Little Brington church is notable for having a spire but no nave. Frederick Spencer, 4th Earl Spencer (1798–1857) built the church of St John as a chapel of ease and a memorial to his first wife, the former Elizabeth Georgina Poyntz whom he had married in 1830.

The church consisted of a chancel, nave and tower with a tall spire and was built in the local brown ironstone of the area. In the 19th century and early in the 20th services were held on a regular basis. The Earl had provided the church for the convenience of villagers from Little Brington and Nobottle, who found it difficult to attend St. Mary&#x27;s in Great Brington (almost 1 mile distant). St John&#x27;s could seat approximately 150 people and was licensed for baptisms and marriages; funerals and burials were held in Great Brington St Mary&#x27;s.

By the 1940s, the church had fallen into a state of disrepair, mainly because of a leaking roof. The main body of the church was demolished after the war in 1947. At the request of the Air Ministry, however, the distinctive tower with its octagonal spire was spared. It had become a landmark to navigators and likely serves the same purpose today. The spire, at , can be seen for many miles in every direction and is invariably a mystery to passersby; the narrow entrance to the circular staircase within the tower has been sealed up to deter vandals.

==Persons of note==

The Australian cricket umpire Ted Wykes was born in Little Brington in 1921.

<text>The Third Menzies ministry (United Australia–Country Coalition) was the 27th ministry of the Government of Australia. It was led by the country&#x27;s 12th Prime Minister, Robert Menzies. The Third Menzies ministry succeeded the Second Menzies ministry, which dissolved on 28 October 1940 following the federal election that took place in September. However, as a result of that election the government was reduced to minority status, and were forced to rely on the votes of independent crossbenchers Alexander Wilson and Arthur Coles to survive. The ministry was replaced by the Fadden ministry on 28 August 1941 following the resignation of Menzies.

Percy Spender, who died in 1985, was the last surviving member of the Third Menzies ministry; Spender was also the last surviving minister of the First Menzies ministry, Second Menzies ministry, Fadden ministry, and the Fourth Menzies ministry. John McEwen was the last surviving Country minister.

<text>Lower Catesby is a hamlet in the civil parish of Catesby, Northamptonshire, about southwest of Daventry. Lower Catesby is beside the nascent River Leam, which rises about to the south in the parish of Hellidon. The Jurassic Way long-distance footpath passes through Lower Catesby. The population of the hamlet is included in the civil parish of Hellidon.

The hamlets name means &#x27;Katr&#x27;s/Kati&#x27;s farm/settlement&#x27;.

==Archaeology==
Roman coins of the Empress Faustina I (early 2nd century) and Emperor Maximian (late 3rd century) are said to have been found in Catesby Park near Lower Catesby before 1720.

==Manor==
The Domesday Book of 1086 records a manor of four hides at Catesby, and that one Sasfrid held it of William Peveral. The same four hides held of William Peverel &quot;(sic)&quot; is recorded again in the 12th century. In about 1175 it was held by Sasfrid&#x27;s grandson Robert de Esseby (&quot;i.e.&quot; &quot;Ashby&quot;, referring to Robert&#x27;s &quot;caput&quot; at Canons Ashby).

==Priory==

Robert de Esseby founded a priory of Cistercian nuns at Lower Catesby in about 1175. In the 1230s Edmund Rich, Archbishop of Canterbury, committed his sisters Margaret and Alice to be nuns at the priory. Edmund was canonized in 1247, Margaret was elected prioress in 1245 and she served until her death in 1257. In 1267 William Maudit, 8th Earl of Warwick died and his heart was buried at Catesby Priory.

In 1535 Parliament passed the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535. Thomas Cromwell&#x27;s commissioners inspected the priory in September 1535 and May 1536, and reported that the prioress and her nine nuns were of good faith and blameless character. Henry VIII nonetheless ordered the commissioners to suppress the priory, which they did before the end of 1536. The last prioress was pensioned off, her nuns and dependents were evicted, all the priory&#x27;s furnishings were seized, its hand-bells were scrapped, and the lead from the roofs of the priory church and buildings was taken and sold for scrap.

==Catesby House and parish church==

In 1537 the Crown sold the remains of the priory to John Onley, who had at least part of the building turned into his family mansion. Early in the 17th century it passed from the Onley family to a family called Parkhurst. Also in the 17th century a church was built or rebuilt in Lower Catesby. An engraving made in about 1720 and drawings made in 1844 suggest a 16th-century house arranged around a central courtyard and a symmetrical west front rebuilt about 1700, with a very formal garden around the house and extending to the east of it. The central courtyard could have been derived from the priory courtyard.

In Catesby churchyard is the tomb of John Parkhurst (1701–65). One of his sons was the Revd. John Parkhurst (1728–97), who was a biblical lexicographer.

In 1861 the 17th-century church was demolished and replaced by the present Church of England parish church of SS Edmund and Mary, which was designed by Gillet of Leicester and completed in 1862. The present church includes a Decorated Gothic sedilia and piscina dating from about 1300, almost certainly carved for the priory church when it was rebuilt in about 1301. The present church also includes Jacobean woodwork from its 17th-century predecessor: a communion rail with barley-twist balusters, and a pulpit and tester.

In 1863 the Catesby House was demolished and a new one was built above lower Catesby, about half-way up the hill to Upper Catesby. The new Catesby House is Jacobethan and incorporates items from previous buildings at Lower Catesby: 16th-century linenfold panelling said to come from the priory, and 17th-century panelling, doorcases and a stair with barley-sugar balusters, all from the old Catesby House.

In 1894 Catesby House was enlarged and a vestry and west porch were added to the church.

A long, rectangular formal pond survives from the gardens of the old Catesby House. There are earthworks, many of them rectilinear, indicating house or priory walls and further formal ponds. It is not entirely clear which walls are from the house and which are from the priory.

==Village==

The hamlet of Lower Catesby is a shrunken village. The modern hamlet has only a handful of houses, all of which are 17th-century or later. It is surrounded by numerous earthen features showing where cottages and the main village street had been. Most of the fields around the former village still have clear ridge and furrow marks from the ploughing of the medieval arable farming with an open field system divided into narrow strips.

Just north of the church is a row of four early 17th-century cottages. Pevsner and Cherry commented that the row &quot;looks as if it were built as almshouses&quot;.

Stone House in Upper Catesby, about east of the ruins of Upper Catesby church, is early 18th-century. Its porch incorporates a 13th-century Early English Gothic arch said to be from the priory.

The ministry was replaced by the Forde ministry on 6 July 1945 following the death of Curtin - the second of three occasions where a sitting Prime Minister died in office.

Frank Forde, who died in 1983, was the last surviving member of the Second Curtin ministry; Forde was also the last surviving minister of the Scullin government, First Curtin ministry, Forde government, and the First Chifley ministry.

<text>The Forde ministry (Labor) was the 31st ministry of the Government of Australia. It was led by the country&#x27;s 15th prime minister, Frank Forde. The Forde Ministry succeeded the Second Curtin ministry, which dissolved on 6 July 1945 following the death of former prime minister John Curtin - the second of three occasions where a sitting prime minister died in office. Since Forde was the deputy Labor leader, it was a caretaker ministry until the Labor caucus could elect a new leader. Treasurer Ben Chifley was ultimately elected over Forde on 12 July 1945, and he was sworn in as prime minister along with his ministry the following day.

Frank Forde, who died in 1983, was the last surviving member of the Forde Ministry; Forde was also the last surviving minister of the Scullin government, the Curtin government, and the First Chifley ministry.

<text>Kelmarsh is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire, England. The population (including Haselbech) of the civil parish at the 2011 Census was 208. The village is on the A508, close to its junction with the A14 about south of Market Harborough and north of Northampton.

The village&#x27;s name probably means, &#x27;marsh marked out by poles or posts&#x27;. The place-name is identical to Chelmarsh, Shropshire; the initial K- reflects Old Norse influence.

==Buildings==
Kelmarsh Hall is its principal building.

Kelmarsh Tunnel is a former railway tunnel at Kelmarsh now open as part of the Brampton Valley Way.

Between 1859 and 1960 the village was served by Kelmarsh railway station about north-east of the village running trains south to Northampton and north to Market Harborough.

<doc id="1202776" wikidata="Q3916489" url="?curid=1202776" title="Individual ministerial responsibility">
<text>In Westminster-style governments, individual ministerial responsibility is a constitutional convention that a cabinet minister bears the ultimate responsibility for the actions of their ministry or department. Individual ministerial responsibility is not the same as cabinet collective responsibility, which states members of the cabinet must approve publicly of its collective decisions or resign. This means that a Parliamentary motion for a vote of no confidence is not in order should the actions of an organ of government fail in the proper discharge of its responsibilities. Where there is ministerial responsibility, the accountable minister is expected to take the blame and ultimately resign, but the majority or coalition within parliament of which the minister is part, is not held to be answerable for that minister&#x27;s failure.

This means that if waste, corruption, or any other misbehaviour is found to have occurred within a ministry, the minister is responsible even if the minister had no knowledge of the actions. A minister is ultimately responsible for all actions by a ministry because, even without knowledge of an infraction by subordinates, the minister approved the hiring and continued employment of those civil servants. If misdeeds are found to have occurred in a ministry, the minister is expected to resign. It is also possible for a minister to face criminal charges for malfeasance under their watch.

The principle is considered essential, as it is seen to guarantee that an elected official is answerable for every single government decision. It is also important to motivate ministers to closely scrutinize the activities within their departments. One rule coming from this principle is that each cabinet member answers for their own ministry in parliament&#x27;s question time. The reverse of ministerial responsibility is that civil servants are not supposed to take credit for the successes of their department, allowing the government to claim them.

In recent years some commentators have argued the notion of ministerial responsibility has been eroded in many Commonwealth countries. As the doctrine is a constitutional convention, there is no formal mechanism for enforcing the rule. Today ministers frequently use ignorance of misbehaviour as an argument for lack of culpability, or argue that actions were instigated by a previous minister, or even a previous government. While opposition parties rarely accept this argument, the electorate is often more accepting. In most other Commonwealth countries such cases are today hardly ever brought to trial.

==Australia==
The doctrine of ministerial responsibility in the Australian Government was inherited in its adoption of the Westminster system. Commonwealth ministers are obliged to report failings of departments under their control to the Parliament, and to actively seek solutions to problems in their jurisdiction. A minister who fails to properly do either of these is expected to resign.

However, in practice, resignations rarely occur for a number of reasons. Although public opinion remains strongly in favour of ministers resigning regardless of their personal involvement in departmental failings, the need for such actions has been eroded by the introduction of alternative mechanisms ensuring executive accountability, such as freedom of information laws and more powerful parliamentary committees.

==Canada==
For organizational purposes there are Cabinet Ministers who are responsible for all activity within their department. In Canada ministerial responsibility has been reduced as it has become increasingly common for top level civil servants to be called before Parliament, bypassing the minister. 

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, ministerial responsibility has tended to follow British practice. Ministers have resigned in cases of personal misconduct, but more rarely in cases of maladministration. Ministers have refused to resign in some cases when they have been asked to account for departmental errors. A famous case was Minister of Works Bob Semple, who refused to resign in 1944 over engineering failures in the construction of a railway tunnel. He was quoted as saying &quot;I am responsible, but not to blame.&quot; Other departures from normal convention have included the refusal of a minister&#x27;s resignation in the 1980s over compromised security of budget documents, and a minister resigning his portfolio (but not leaving Cabinet) over the 1995 Cave Creek disaster.

==United Kingdom==
It is currently unclear what individual action a minister ought to take when a civil servant within his department is guilty of maladministration. The formulation of some guidelines took place during the Crichel Down Affair in 1954 in which the Minister of Agriculture, Thomas Dugdale, resigned, despite an inquiry suggesting that all mistakes were made within his department without his knowledge and in some cases due to deliberate deceit by civil servants. Later details suggested that he resigned because he supported the civil servants&#x27; actions and because he disagreed with the government accepting the inquiry&#x27;s conclusions.
The government announced that ministers must defend civil servants who act properly and in accordance with policies set out by the minister. Furthermore, it was stated that &quot;where an official makes a mistake or causes some delay, but not on an important issue of policy and not where a claim to individual rights is seriously involved, the Minister acknowledges the mistake and he accepts the responsibility although he is not personally involved.&quot;

In 1982, Lord Carrington (then Foreign Secretary) and two other Foreign Office ministers resigned shortly after the invasion of the Falkland Islands. Later official reviews stated that, although there had been misjudgments within the Foreign Office, no responsibility attached to any individual within the government. However, in 1983, when 38 IRA prisoners broke out of the Maze prison, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Prior, did not resign, explaining that the break-out was not caused by any policy initiative originating from him. This latter position has become the norm in British politics. An exception might be Estelle Morris, who resigned as Secretary of State for Education in 2002, saying she had not done well enough after a scandal over A-level marking.

Some recent resignations due to personal errors of judgment or impropriety include the resignation of Ron Davies, the Secretary of State for Wales, for sexual misconduct in 1998, and the resignation of Peter Mandelson, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, for failing to disclose a substantial loan by a Cabinet colleague in 1999.

An argument put forward during the Scott Inquiry into the Arms-to-Iraq affair in the 1980s was a distinction between political responsibility and political accountability.

<doc id="1202782" wikidata="Q2063426" url="?curid=1202782" title="The Winter of Our Discontent">
<text>The Winter of Our Discontent is John Steinbeck&#x27;s last novel, published in 1961. The title comes from the first two lines of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III: &quot;Now is the winter of our discontent / Made glorious summer by this sun [or son] of York&quot;&quot;. It is Steinbeck&#x27;s only work to take place entirely on the East Coast of the United States; it is primarily set in Sag Harbor, New York.

==Plot summary==
The story mainly concerns Ethan Allen Hawley of New Baytown, New York, a former member of Long Island&#x27;s aristocratic class. Ethan&#x27;s late father lost the family fortune and thus Ethan works as a grocery store clerk in the store his family once owned. His wife Mary and their children resent their mediocre social and economic status and do not value the honesty and integrity that Ethan struggles to maintain amidst a corrupt society. These external factors and his own psychological turmoil lead him to abandon his inherent integrity in order to reclaim his former status and wealth.

Ethan&#x27;s decision to gain wealth and power is influenced by criticisms and advice from people he knows. His acquaintance Margie urges him to accept bribes and the bank manager (whose ancestors Ethan blames for his family&#x27;s misfortunes) urges him to be more ruthless. Ethan&#x27;s friend Joey, a bank teller, even gives Ethan a lesson on how to rob a bank and get away with it.

On discovering that the current store owner, Italian American Alfio Marullo, may be an illegal immigrant, Ethan makes an anonymous tip to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. After Marullo is taken into custody, he transfers ownership of the store to Ethan because he believes Ethan is honest and deserving. Ethan also considers, plans and mentally rehearses a bank robbery, failing to perform it only because of external circumstances. He gives Danny Taylor, the town drunk and his childhood friend, money to drink himself to death and Danny leaves an important piece of land to him in his will.

In this manner, Ethan becomes able to control the covert dealings of the corrupt town businessmen and politicians, but he is confident that he will not be corrupted himself. He considers that while he had to kill enemy soldiers in the war, he was never a murderer thereafter.

Ethan learns that his son won honorable mention in a nationwide essay contest by plagiarizing classic American authors and orators, but when Ethan confronts him, the son denies having any guilty feelings, maintaining that everyone cheats and lies. Perhaps after seeing his own moral decay in his son&#x27;s actions, and experiencing the guilt of Marullo&#x27;s deportation and the death of Danny, Ethan resolves to commit suicide. His daughter, intuitively understanding his intent, slips a family talisman into his pocket during a long embrace. When Ethan decides to commit the act, he reaches into his pocket to find razorblades and instead finds the talisman. As the tide comes into the alcove in which he has sequestered himself, he struggles to get out in order to return the talisman to his daughter.

Edward Weeks of the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; reviewed the book as a Steinbeck classic, writing, &quot;His dialogue is full of life, the entrapment of Ethan is ingenious, and the morality in this novel marks Mr. Steinbeck&#x27;s return to the mood and the concern with which he wrote &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;.&quot; The Swedish Academy agreed and awarded Steinbeck the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962. The presentation speech by Anders Österling, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, remarked specifically on five books from 1935 to 1939 and continued thus:

In this brief presentation it is not possible to dwell at any length on individual works which Steinbeck later produced. If at times the critics have seemed to note certain signs of flagging powers, of repetitions that might point to a decrease in vitality, Steinbeck belied their fears most emphatically with The &quot;Winter of Our Discontent&quot; (1961), a novel published last year. Here he attained the same standard which he set in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. Again he holds his position as an independent expounder of the truth with an unbiased instinct for what is genuinely American, be it good or bad.
Saul Bellow also lauded the book, writing, &quot;John Steinbeck returns to the high standards of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; and to the social themes that made his early work so impressive, and so powerful.&quot; However, many reviewers in America were disappointed. A few years later, Peter Lisca called &quot;Winter&quot; &quot;undeniable evidence of the aesthetic and philosophical failure of [Steinbeck&#x27;s] later fiction&quot;.

In letters to friends before and after its publication, Steinbeck stated that he wrote the novel to address the moral degeneration of American culture during the 1950s and 1960s. American criticism of his moralism started to change during the 1970s after the Watergate scandal. Reloy Garcia, describing his reassessment of the work when asked to update his original Study Guide to &quot;Winter&quot;, wrote, &quot;The book I then so impetuously criticized as somewhat thin, now strikes me as a deeply penetrating study of the American condition. I did not realize, at the time, that we had a condition,&quot; and he attributes this change of heart to &quot;our own enriched experience&quot;.

In 1983, Carol Ann Kasparek condemned the character of Ethan for his implausibility and still called Steinbeck’s treatment of American moral decay superficial, although she went on to approve the story&#x27;s mythic elements.

The professor of literature and Steinbeck scholar Stephen K. George wrote, &quot;With these authors [Saul Bellow, Brent Weeks, and Ruth Stiles Gannett] I would contend that, given its multi-layered complexity, intriguing artistry, and clear moral purpose, &quot;The Winter of Our Discontent&quot; ranks in the upper echelon of Steinbeck’s fiction, alongside &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, &quot;Cannery Row&quot;, &quot;East of Eden&quot;, and, of course, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;.&quot;

The novel was the last that Steinbeck completed before his death in 1968. &quot;The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights&quot; and the screenplay for &quot;Zapata&quot; were both published posthumously in unfinished forms.

==Narrative point of view==
Steinbeck makes use of an unusual structural device in &quot;Winter&quot;, switching between three different styles of narrative points of view. The novel is presented in two halves, Part One and Part Two, and each half starts with two chapters written in third person narration. After these two chapters in each half, the point of view changes to first person, narrated by the protagonist, Ethan Hawley. The four chapters in third person narrative are mostly presented from the point of view of Ethan, but not in first person, a technique known as free indirect discourse, or free indirect speech. There are two exceptions to this: the first is an interlude at the start of chapter 12 where the point of view switches to that of Margie: &quot;when a more intimate view is needed of the seductress Margie Young-Hunt . . . the third person narrative reappears&quot;. The second exception is the interlude at the start of chapter 11 which is presented by the author as an omniscient narrator, before the chapter reverts to Ethan&#x27;s point of view. The three different narrative styles are therefore: omniscient narrator (chapter 11 part), free indirect discourse from multiple points of view (chapters 1, 2, 11 and 12) and first person narrative from a single point of view (the rest of the book).

==Themes==
A major theme found in &quot;The Winter of Our Discontent&quot; is the effect of societal pressure. At the beginning of the novel, Ethan Hawley is unhappy with his job as a grocery store clerk, but it is the complaints from his wife and children about their social and economic status that drive his character to change his beliefs about wealth and power. He is also influenced by close acquaintances who encourage him to accept bribes and speak in ways indicating that money is the most important thing in their lives. For example, Ethan’s banker friend Joey Morphy exemplifies how important money is by saying &quot;your only entrance is money&quot; (144), and “we all bow down to the Great God Currency” (132). This man’s life revolved around money and making more of it. Later in the novel, Ethan plans out a bank robbery and would have acted on it had it not been for a last minute distraction. In the land situation with Danny, Ethan plays the role of the kind friend, but ultimately receives the important piece of land that other men were competing for as well. His greed and lust for power catch up with Ethan at the end of the novel when he realizes his own son plagiarized for the “Why I Love America” contest. But the son&#x27;s purpose in entering the contest was not to show love for his country, but rather to gain materialistic rewards from it like a watch and trip, in addition to appearing on TV (Chapters 5, 11, 21). Ethan feels guilty for his actions and as a result, becomes suicidal.

==Film adaptation==
The novel was made into a television movie for the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; in 1983, featuring Donald Sutherland, Teri Garr, and Tuesday Weld.

<doc id="1202784" wikidata="Q570955" url="?curid=1202784" title="Hollowell">
<text>Hollowell is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire, in Northamptonshire, England. At the time of the 2001 census, the parish&#x27;s population, including the nearby hamlet of Teeton, was 353 people, increasing to 385 at the 2011 Census. The village was originally a hamlet of Guilsborough, becoming a separate parish from 1850. Hollowell is mentioned in the Domesday Survey of 1086 as belonging the Bishop of Lincoln having &quot;... 4 villeins with 1 bordar having 1 plough. It was, and is worth, 10 schillings. Bardi held (it) freely.&quot;

==Geography==
The village is north-west of the town of Northampton and just off a side road west of the village of Creaton on the A5199, formerly the A50, trunk road. About north on the A5199 there is a junction with the A14 trunk road, a dual carriageway connecting the M1 and M6 motorway interchange at Catthorpe with Kettering, Cambridge, Ipswich and the port of Felixstowe.

==Landmarks==
Hollowell Reservoir is a reservoir between Northampton and Market Harborough and just north of the village. It has a sailing club and is also used for fishing. It is the scene of a number of double-figure tench catches during the 2004 season, with a record of over .

Within the boundaries of the parochial parish stood the Northampton County Sanatorium (also known locally as Creaton Hospital), a tuberculosis hospital in operation between 1910 and 1979. In the 1980s it was converted to 13 private houses and is now called Highfield Park.

==History and events==
The villages name means &#x27;hollow spring/stream&#x27;.

Being at the bottom of a valley, the village was vulnerable to icy and snow-filled roads before the use of council gritting. In the winter of 1947, Hollowell and Guilsborough were cut off from the main (Welford) road for several weeks. A Mr J Smith, who lived in Guilsborough, was recorded as delivering bread to the inhabitants on horseback during this time.

Hollowell Steam is a steam and heavy horse show held annually near the village on the first full weekend of July. The event was first held in 1986 to raise funds to repair the village&#x27;s church roof. It is now one of the largest steam rallies in the country, with 45 engines expected in 2007. Over £75,000 in funds were raised in 2004, distributed to local charities and groups. The event is run by Allen Eaton MBE.

From 1974 to 2021 it was in Daventry district.

==Sports Clubs==
Hollowell Reservoir is home to Hollowell Sailing Club and Hollowell Scullers Rowing Club

<doc id="1202785" wikidata="Q1026436" url="?curid=1202785" title="Qadian">
<text>Qadian (; ) is a town and a municipal council in Gurdaspur district, north-east of Amritsar, situated north-east of Batala city in the state of Punjab, India. Qadian is the birthplace of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement within Islam. It remained the headquarters of the movement until the Partition of India in 1947.

==History==
Qadian was established in 1530 by Mirza Hadi Baig, a religious scholar dedicated to Islam and the first Qazi in the area. Mirza Hadi Baig was from a royal household of Mirza of the Mughal Empire. He migrated from Samarkand and settled in Punjab where he was granted a vast tract of land comprising 80 villages by the emperor Babur. Because of his religious beliefs, he named the center of the 80 villages &quot;Islam Pur Qazi&quot; and governed from there. Over time, the name of the town changed to &quot;Qazi Maji&quot;, then &quot;Qadi&quot;, and eventually it became known as &#x27;Qadian&#x27;.

Qadian and the surrounding areas later fell to the Ramgarhia Sikhs under the leadership of Jassa Singh Ramgarhia who offered the ruling Qazis, two villages which they refused. In 1834, during the rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the region consisting of Qadian and five adjoining villages was given to Mirza Ghulam Murtaza, father of Ghulam Ahmad in return for military support in Kashmir, Mahadi, the Kulu valley, Peshawar and Hazara.

===As the home of the Ahmadiyya Movement===
A remote and unknown town, Qadian emerged as a centre of religious learning in 1889, when Mirza Ghulam Ahmad established the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. In 1891 it became the venue for the Community&#x27;s annual gatherings. Qadian remained the administrative headquarters and capital of the Ahmadiyya Caliphate until the partition of India in 1947, when much of the Community migrated to Pakistan. Following the partition, Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmud Ahmad, the second Khalifa of the Community, carefully oversaw the safe migration of Ahmadis from Qadian to the newly founded state, instructing 313 men, including two of his own sons, to stay in Qadian and guard the sites holy to Ahmadis, conferring upon them the title &quot;darveshān-i qādiyān&quot; (the dervishes of Qadian) and eventually moving the headquarters to Rabwah, Pakistan.

The term &quot;Qadiani&quot; is used as a slur to refer to Ahmadi Muslims, primarily in Pakistan.

==Geography==

=== Languages ===
Most of the residents of Qadian are speakers of the Punjabi language. A significant minority, about a 1/10 of the population, also speak the Urdu language. In areas like &quot;Mohallah Ahmadiyya&quot;, Urdu signs are a common sight.

Qadian is connected through its railway station, which was built back in November 1928. It is located in the Darul Barakat area and served by the &#x27;Mela special line&#x27;, a 55-kilometer track, linking it to Amritsar via Batala, with a proposed Qadian-Beas Line which was sanctioned back in 2011.

<text>The Fourth Menzies ministry (Liberal–Country Coalition) was the 34th ministry of the Government of Australia. It was led by the country&#x27;s 12th Prime Minister, Robert Menzies. The Fourth Menzies ministry succeeded the Second Chifley ministry, which dissolved on 19 December 1949 following the federal election that took place on 10 December which saw the Coalition defeat Ben Chifley&#x27;s Labor Party. The ministry was replaced by the Fifth Menzies ministry on 11 May 1951 following the 1951 federal election.

Percy Spender, who died in 1985, was the last surviving member of the Fourth Menzies Ministry; Spender was also the last surviving minister of the first Menzies government and the Fadden government. John McEwen was the last surviving Country minister.

<doc id="1202788" wikidata="Q1433428" url="?curid=1202788" title="Battle cry">
<text>A battle cry or war cry is a yell or chant taken up in battle, usually by members of the same combatant group.
Battle cries are not necessarily articulate (e.g. &quot;Eulaliaaaa!&quot;, &quot;Alala&quot;..), although they often aim to invoke patriotic or religious sentiment. Their purpose is a combination of arousing aggression and esprit de corps on one&#x27;s own side and causing intimidation on the hostile side. Battle cries are a universal form of display behaviour (i.e., threat display) aiming at competitive advantage, ideally by overstating one&#x27;s own aggressive potential to a point where the enemy prefers to avoid confrontation altogether and opts to flee. In order to overstate one&#x27;s potential for aggression, battle cries need to be as loud as possible, and have historically often been amplified by acoustic devices such as horns, drums, conches, carnyxes, bagpipes, bugles, etc. (see also martial music).

Battle cries are closely related to other behavioral patterns of human aggression, such as war dances and taunting, performed during the &quot;warming up&quot; phase preceding the escalation of physical violence. From the Middle Ages, many cries appeared on speech scrolls in standards or coat of arms as slogans (see slogan (heraldry)) and were adopted as mottoes, an example being the motto &quot;Dieu et mon droit&quot; (&quot;God and my right&quot;) of the English kings. It is said that this was Edward III&#x27;s rallying cry during the Battle of Crécy. The word &quot;slogan&quot; originally derives from &quot;sluagh-gairm&quot; or &quot;sluagh-ghairm&quot; (&quot;sluagh&quot; = &quot;people&quot;, &quot;army&quot;, and &quot;gairm&quot; = &quot;call&quot;, &quot;proclamation&quot;), the Scottish Gaelic word for &quot;gathering-cry&quot; and in times of war for &quot;battle-cry&quot;. The Gaelic word was borrowed into English as &quot;slughorn&quot;, &quot;sluggorne&quot;, &quot;slogum&quot;, and &quot;slogan&quot;.

==History==

===Antiquity===
* The war cry is an aspect of epic battle in Homer: in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Diomedes is conventionally called &quot;Diomedes of the loud war cry.&quot; Hellenes and Akkadians alike uttered the onomatopoeic cry &quot;alala&quot; in battle.
* The troops of ancient Athens, during the Medic Wars and the Peloponnesian War were noted for going into battle shouting &quot;Alala!&quot; or &quot;Alale!&quot;, which was supposed to emulate the cry of the owl, the bird of their patron goddess Athena.
* The Western Huns attacked with terrifying battle cries.
* One of the common Hindu war cry was &quot;Hara Hara Mahadeva&quot; meaning, &quot;&quot;Hail to Mahadeva!&quot; (Shiva).&quot; 
* Another common war cry in India was &quot;Jai Bhavani&quot; meaning, &quot;&quot;Hail goddess Bhavani!”&quot;
* A common war cry used in ancient Tamilakam was &quot;Vetrivel, Veeravel&quot;, meaning, &quot;Victorious vel, courageous vel.&quot; Vel is the spear of Murugan, the regional form of Kartikeya, the Hindu war deity. In the contemporary period, the battle cry &quot;Vetrivel, Veeravel&quot; is being used in the 191 Field Regiment of the Indian Army based in Madukkarai, Coimbatore.

===Middle Ages===

* During the Scottish wars of independence, Scottish soldiers used Alba gu bràth as a battle-cry, a phrase that means &#x27;Scotland for ever&#x27; (literally, &#x27;Scotland until judgement&#x27;.) This was depicted in the film &quot;Braveheart&quot; during which Mel Gibson, playing William Wallace, shouts the phrase to rally his soldiers just before a battle commenced.
* Each Turkic tribe and tribal union had its distinct tamga (seal), totemic &quot;ongon&quot; bird, and distinct &quot;uran&quot; (battle cry) (hence the Slavic &quot;urah&quot; &quot;battle cry&quot;). While tamgas and &quot;ongons&quot; could be distinct down to individuals, the hue of horses and &quot;uran&quot; battle cries belonged to each tribe, were passed down from generation to generation, and some modern battle cries were recorded in antiquity. On split of the tribe, their unique distinction passed to a new political entity, endowing different modern states with the same &quot;uran&quot; battle cries of the split tribes, for example Kipchak battle cry among Kazakhs, Kirgizes, Turkmens, and Uzbeks. Some larger tribes&#x27; &quot;uran&quot; battle cries:
** Kipchak – &quot;ay-bas&quot; (&quot;lunar head&quot;).
** Kangly (Kangars) – &quot;bai-terek&quot; (&quot;sacred tree&quot;).
** Oguzes – &quot;teke&quot; (&quot;mount&quot;)
* Desperta ferro! (&quot;Awake iron!&quot; in Catalan) was the most characteristic cry of the Almogavar warriors during the Crown of Aragon military campaigns across the Mediterranean from the 12th through to the 14th centuries.
* Deus vult! (&quot;God wills it!&quot; in Latin) was the battle cry of the Crusaders.
* Montjoie Saint Denis!: battle cry of the Kings of France since the 12th century.
* Santiago y cierra, España! was a war cry of Spanish troops during the Reconquista, and of the Spanish Empire.
* On 14 August 1431, the whole Army of the Holy Roman Empire (of the 4th anti-Hussite crusade) was defeated by the Hussites in the Battle of Domažlice. Attacking imperial units started to retreat after hearing Ktož jsú boží bojovníci (&quot;Ye Who Are Warriors of God&quot;) choral and were annihilated shortly after.
* &quot;Allāhu Akbar&quot; (الله أكبر, &quot;God is [the] Greatest&quot;) and &quot;Allāhu Allāh&quot; (الله الله, &quot;God! God!&quot;) were used by Muslim armies throughout history. &quot;Al-naṣr aw al-shahāda&quot; (النصر أو الشهادة, &quot;Victory or martyrdom&quot;) was also a common battle cry; the At-Tawbah 9:52 says that God has promised to the righteous Muslim warrior one of these two glorious ideals.
* &quot;Óðinn á yðr alla&quot; (&quot;Odin owns you all&quot;) – A reference to Odin&#x27;s self sacrifice at Yggdrasil. Attributed to Eric the Victorious.

===Pre-modern===
* When suppressing peasants&#x27; rebellions in Germany and Scandinavia around 1500, such as in the Battle of Hemmingstedt, the Dutch mercenaries of the Black Guard yelled &quot;Wahr di buer, die garde kumt&quot; (&quot;Beware, peasants, the guards are coming&quot;). When the peasants counterattacked, they responded with &quot;Wahr di, Garr, de Buer de kumt&quot; (&quot;Beware, Guard, of the peasant, [who is] coming&quot;).
* The Spanish cried &quot;Santiago&quot; (&quot;Saint James&quot;) both when reconquering Spain from the Moors and during conquest in early colonial America.

** &quot;Waheguru ji ka Khalsa&quot; (the Community of the Pure belongs to the Wondrous Enlightener) – &quot;Waheguru ji ki Fateh&quot; (Victory belongs to the Wondrous Enlightener)
** &quot;Raj Karega Khalsa&quot; – (The Khalsa will rule) Aaakki Rahe Na Koye (And no opponent will remain)
** &quot;Gaj ke jaikara gajaave fateh paave nihaal ho jaavae, Sat Sri Akaal gurbaar akaal hee akaal&quot;|| (excerpt from ardas of &quot;Buddha Dal&quot; prayerbook (gutka) praising the blessing of uttering jaikara proclaiming supreme truth).

===Modern===
* During World War II, &quot;Tennōheika Banzai&quot; (天皇陛下万歳, &quot;May the Emperor live for ten thousand years&quot;) served as a battle cry of sorts for Japanese soldiers, particularly in a &quot;banzai charge&quot;. The most popular battle cry is &quot;Ei ei oh&quot; (エイエイオー), which is usually used at the start of battle.
* &quot;Avanti Savoia!&quot; (English: Go Savoy!) was the patriotic battle cry of the Italian Royal Army during World War I and to a lesser extent, World War II. Infantrymen would scream this motto when launching an offensive attack, namely against the Austro-Hungarians.

* During the Korean War, the Korean People&#x27;s Army used the phrase &quot;김일성 수령님 만세&quot; (transliterated &quot;gim-ilseong sulyeongnim manse&quot;, translated as &quot;Long live the Great Leader Kim Il Sung&quot;).

* Croatian armed forces during the Croatian War of Independence would use &quot;Za dom spremni&quot;. One would start by saying &quot;Za dom!&quot; and the rest would follow with &quot;Spremni!&quot;. It translates loosely to &quot;For home – ready!&quot; or &quot;For homeland – ready!&quot;.
* Leeroy Jenkins is an internet meme, which has often served the purpose of an ironic or fatalistic parody of a battle cry, originating from a famous video of a World of Warcraft clan creating an intricate battle plan, before being party-wiped as a result of Leeroy Jenkins, who had been AFK at the time, charging in head-first. This gave rise to the phrase in first-person shooter games, where players will shout &quot;LEEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY JEEEEEENKIIIIIIIIIINS!&quot; as they charge at the enemy. The phrase has gained notoriety, making appearances in various non-World of Warcraft media.
* Sangh Parivar and other Hindu nationalist organizations use the Hindu religious slogan Jai Shri Ram (Victory to Lord Rama) as a war cry during communal violence.

* During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, &quot;Slava Ukraini&quot; (Слава Україні! English: Glory to Ukraine!), often accompanied by a reply of &quot;Heroiam Slava&quot; (Героям слава! English: Glory to the heroes!), became an internationally-known battle cry not only among domestic forces, but also among Western, mostly NATO allies.

<text>Kukatush is a rail siding and ghost town in Unorganized North Part of Sudbury District, Ontario, Canada. It is located approximately west of Timmins (via Highway 101). The elevation is .

The main reason for its existence has been the presence of the Canadian National Railway siding that still functions. Only a few buildings associated with the railway remain and the area is no longer populated. However, the area has a varied history of fur trading, railway activities, mining exploration, which took place from as early as 1903 until the Kukatush Mining Corporation in the 1950s-60s, logging operations, etc. At one time there was even a basic landing strip for small aircraft arriving for local tourist outfitters camps.

<text>Raise Your Voice is a 2004 American teen musical drama film directed by Sean McNamara and starring Hilary Duff. Canadian rock band Three Days Grace makes a cameo appearance in the film, performing the songs &quot;Are You Ready&quot; and &quot;Home&quot;. Upon release, the film received negative reviews and grossed $14.9 million against a $15 million budget.

==Plot==
Terri Fletcher is a Flagstaff, Arizona teenager who dreams of becoming a professional singer. She wants to participate in a music program that could give her a $10,000 scholarship. Her overprotective father Simon, a second-generation restaurateur, disapproves of Terri&#x27;s plans, wanting her to run the family business.

Terri is very close to her elder brother Paul, who supports her dream. At Paul&#x27;s graduation-day barbecue, he has a fight with Simon and is grounded. That night, Terri sneaks Paul out of the house to attend a Three Days Grace concert. On their way home, they are hit by a drunk driver. Terri awakens in the hospital and learns that Paul was killed.

Terri blames herself for Paul&#x27;s death and decides to quit singing, but her mother Frances says that Paul&#x27;s death is not her fault, and that Paul would have wanted Terri to attend the program. She eventually convinces Terri to go, telling Simon that Terri plans to stay with her aunt Nina in Palm Desert, California for the summer while she actually goes to Los Angeles.

Terri arrives in Los Angeles and has a few difficulties: her jacket is stolen, her cab driver is crabby, and initially can&#x27;t get into the music school. While in the program, Terri makes new friends, including fun-loving DJ Kiwi, quiet pianist Sloane, and talented violinist Denise. Terri learns a great deal about music but has flashbacks of the car crash.

Terri also develops a mutual fondness for British songwriter Jay, but she faces competition from Robyn Childers, who was with Jay the previous summer. Robyn still harbors feelings for Jay, but he does not reciprocate. Jay tries to get Robyn to leave him and Terri alone. On one occasion, Robyn kisses Jay just as Terri walks in. Jay pushes Robyn away, but Terri runs off in tears, ignoring Jay&#x27;s insistence that the kiss meant nothing. Later, finding him drunk, Terri and Denise take Jay to the roof to sober up. When he does, Jay apologizes, and Terri agrees to finish the song they have been working on for the scholarship contest.

In the meantime, Simon learns of Terri&#x27;s ruse, and drives to Los Angeles to bring her home. On the final day, Simon comes to the school and chastises Terri for deceiving him, as well as accuses her of turning his sister and wife against him, but Terri begs her father not to make same mistake he did with Paul and make her run, and not ruin the summer. Ultimately, realizing how selfish he had been, Simon changes his mind.

Terri and Jay perform the song they wrote, dedicating it to Paul. Even though Denise wins the scholarship prize, Simon is proud of his daughter and her talents, and is also glad that her last memory of Paul is one worth having (the concert), as opposed to Simon&#x27;s own (their argument). Terri&#x27;s teachers hope to see her next year; Simon replies that they just might. The students perform together.

<text>Major General Sir Nevill Maskelyne Smyth, (14 August 1868 – 21 July 1941) was a senior officer in the British Army and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Born the son of Warington Wilkinson Smyth, a noted geologist, his grandfather was Admiral William Henry Smyth. His father&#x27;s sister, Henrietta Grace Powell, was Robert Baden-Powell&#x27;s mother making Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scout Movement, Smyth&#x27;s first cousin.

Smyth was educated at Westminster School and graduated from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1888. He was posted to the Queen&#x27;s Bays (2nd Dragoon Guards) in India as a second lieutenant on 22 August 1888. In 1890 he was attached to the Royal Engineers to assist with a railway survey during the Zhob Valley expedition.

==Sudan==
In 1895 he was stationed in Cairo with his regiment, being promoted lieutenant on 26 April of that year. From December 1895 until March 1896 he was attached to Theodore Bent’s explorations in the Northern Sudan, being “kindly attached to our expedition by Colonel Sir F. Wingate…” For his services in the initial stages of the Mahdist War he was mentioned in dispatches on 3 November 1896, and awarded the Order of the Medjidieh, Fourth Class in 1897.

On 8 December 1897 Smyth was promoted captain. On 2 September came the Battle of Omdurman. Near to the end of the battle, a dervish tried to spear two war correspondents; Smyth galloped forward and, though severely speared through the arm, shot the man dead. This action saw him awarded the Victoria Cross. The citation was gazetted on 15 November 1898, and read:

Smyth was also Mentioned in Despatches. In November 1899 he was Intelligence officer and ADC to Colonel Lewis, commanding the Infantry Brigade during the operations leading to the defeat of the Khalifa in the Battle of Umm Diwaykarat. He was Mentioned in Despatches, and was awarded the Order of Osmanieh, Fourth Class in 1900.

Smyth rejoined the Queens Bays for active service in South Africa in the Second Boer War. He was awarded a brevet majority on 22 August 1902 for his South African service.

Smyth was promoted to substantive major on 27 October 1903 when he transferred to the Carabiniers (6th Dragoon Guards), who were then in India and returned to South Africa in 1908. He was promoted lieutenant colonel on 1 May 1909, and became commanding officer of the Carabiniers. The regiment returned to England in 1912. According to the &quot;London Gazette&quot;, he completed the standard four-year period as a regimental commander on 1 May 1909, and was placed on half-pay. However the same issue, carried notice of his promotion to colonel backdated to 4 December 1912. He was seconded to the Egyptian Army, and in 1913–14 he was commandant of the Khartoum district where he was active in combating the slave trade.
==First World War==
Smyth was dispatched to Gallipoli by Lord Kitchener, arriving there in May 1915. Promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier general that same month, he took command of the 1st Australian Infantry Brigade after its previous commander, Brigadier General Henry Normand MacLaurin, had been killed. He led the brigade during the Gallipoli campaign at the Battle of Lone Pine and was one of the last officers to leave the peninsula during the evacuation from Gallipoli in late 1915. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) on 1 January 1916, and received a further mention in dispatches on 28 January 1916.

Smyth led the brigade in action on the Western Front later in 1916, and on 28 December was given command of the 2nd Australian Division, for which he was made a temporary major general. He was mentioned in dispatches twice more, on 15 May 1917 and 11 December 1917, and was promoted substantive major general on 1 January 1918 as a &quot;reward for distinguished service in the field.&quot; He was transferred back to the British Army in May 1918 and briefly commanded the 58th (2/1st London) Division and then the 59th (2nd North Midland) Division from August 1918, leading the latter during the liberation of Lille in October 1918. He had learned to fly in 1913 and was known for borrowing aircraft to look at the lines for himself. He was yet again mentioned in dispatches on 20 December 1918.

Smyth was promoted Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 1919 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours. On 30 July 1919 was appointed GOC 47th (1/2nd London) Division (Territorial Force). During the war he had also been awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre, and the French Legion of Honour in the grade of Officer. In all, he was Mentioned in Despatches eleven times during his career. He was appointed colonel of the 3rd Dragoon Guards on 1 October 1920. He relinquished command of his division on 30 July 1923. Smyth retired from the British Army on 5 July 1924, and relinquished the colonelcy of the 3rd Dragoon Guards on 16 October 1925.

Smyth served as the Honorary Colonel of the South African Natal Carbineers from 1920 to 1925 and then of the 37/39 Battalion, Australia.

In London in July 1918, Smyth married Evelyn Olwen Williams, daughter of Colonel Sir Osmond Williams, baronet and lord lieutenant of Merionethshire. Their three children were born in Britain before the family migrated to Australia.

==Australia==
After his retirement he and his family migrated to Australia in 1925 to live on a farm at Balmoral, Victoria. He took to politics in the Nationalist Party of Australia and stood unsuccessfully for a Victorian casual vacancy in the Australian Senate. He died at home in 1941 and was buried in Balmoral Cemetery.

One of his sons, Dacre Smyth, followed a military career in the Royal Australian Navy rising to commodore.

<text>The Seventh Menzies ministry (Liberal–Country Coalition) was the 37th ministry of the Government of Australia. It was led by the country&#x27;s 12th Prime Minister, Robert Menzies. The Seventh Menzies ministry succeeded the Sixth Menzies ministry, which dissolved on 11 January 1956 following the federal election that took place in the previous December. It is the first ministry to consist of a two-tier ministry, with only senior ministers being members of Cabinet, while the other ministers are in the outer ministry. With the exception of the Whitlam government and the caretaker First Fraser ministry, this practice has endured to this day. The ministry was replaced by the Eighth Menzies ministry on 10 December 1958 following the 1958 federal election.

Allen Fairhall, who died in 2006, was the last surviving member of the Seventh Menzies Ministry; Fairhall was also the last surviving member of the Ninth Menzies ministry. Hugh Roberton was the last surviving Country junior minister, and Paul Hasluck and John McEwen were the last surviving Liberal and Country Cabinet ministers respectively.

<doc id="1202806" wikidata="Q1771983" url="?curid=1202806" title="Hellidon">
<text>Hellidon is a village and civil parish about south-west of Daventry in Northamptonshire, England. The parish area is about . It lies – above sea level on the north face of an ironstone ridge, its highest point, at Windmill Hill, being south-east of the village. The Leam and tributaries rise in the parish. The 2011 Census gave a population (with Lower and Upper Catesby) of 256, estimated at 286 in 2019. The long-distance Jurassic Way footpath linking Banbury, Oxfordshire, and Stamford, Lincolnshire, passes through. The origin of the name is unclear. &quot;Holy Valley&quot;, &quot;Haegla&#x27;s Valley&quot; and &quot;Unstable valley&quot; have been suggested, with the Old English &quot;dun&quot;, meaning hill.

==Manors==
The Domesday Book of 1086 omits Hellidon. In the 12th century a manor of four hides (about 49 ha) at &quot;Eliden&quot; was recorded in the fee of Berkhamsted. From the 13th century Hellidon had two manors: Baskervilles and Giffords.

The present manor house at the north-west end occupies the site of the Baskervilles. Giffords Manor was on the north-east side – there are substantial rectilinear earthworks where the house is said to have stood. It had been abandoned by the time of Hellidon&#x27;s 18th-century land surveys.

==Church and chapel==
===Church of England===
The Church of England parish church of St John the Baptist is Decorated Gothic in style, and so from late 13th or early 14th century. The west tower survives in its medieval condition, but in 1845–1847 the nave and chancel were heavily restored for the Rev C. S. Holthouse under the Gothic Revival architect William Butterfield. Twenty years later Butterfield designed the north aisle and the parish school, both were built in 1867. In 1897 a north aisle was added to the chancel, designed by Matthew Houlding. There is also a north transept. St John&#x27;s is a Grade II* listed building.

The west tower has a ring of five bells. Hugh II Watts, who had foundries at Bedford and Leicester, cast the fourth bell in 1615 and the second, third and tenor in 1635. The Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the treble bell in 1993.

===Nonconformist===
Hellidon had a Nonconformist chapel in Berry Lane. The building is now a private house.

==Economic and social history==
Until the 1770s an open field system of farming prevailed. There were five such fields, mapped in 1726 as Further Field, Lower Field, Middle Field, Upper Field and Short Attle Field. Parliament passed an inclosure act, the (14 Geo. 3. c. &quot;108&quot; ), for which it was surveyed in 1775. There the earlier Middle Field was marked as Hill Field and Short Attle Field simply as Attle Field.

On Windmill Hill a tower mill was built in the late 18th or early 19th century. By 1973 it was derelict, but it has since been restored as an ancillary building for the Windmill Vineyard planted around it.

A Hellidon friendly society called the Institute, founded in 1805 still existed to mark its centenary in 1905.

The earliest record of a post office is from 1847. The first postmaster was John Wells, who described himself as a shoemaker in the 1841 Census, but a shopkeeper in 1849. By 1854 he appeared as &quot;Postmaster and Letter Receiver&quot;.

The Grange, designed by William Butterfield and built for Rev. C. S. Holthouse, has a small core of an older house that Holthouse bought. The enlargement took place in 1850 and again in 1861. It is a Grade II* listed building.

Hellidon&#x27;s highest recorded population was 449 in 1861.

In August 1904 a fire in Cox&#x27;s Lane destroyed three thatched cottages.

===Railways===
The Great Central Main Line from Yorkshire to was built in the 1890s. It passed through the eastern edge of the parish in the Catesby Tunnel, and was completed in 1897. One of the tunnel&#x27;s five air shafts is in the parish. Goods traffic commenced in 1898 and the nearest passenger station opened in March 1899 at , about south-east of Hellidon. The station was closed in March 1963 and the line in September 1966.

From 1917 until 1961 the Park Gate Iron and Steel Company had a quarry about south of the village, on the boundary with Charwelton parish. From there it ran a mineral railway down the Cherwell valley to take ironstone to the main line at Charwelton station. A steam locomotive called &quot;Charwelton&quot; was built for the line in 1917, worked it until 1942, and is now preserved on the Kent and East Sussex Railway.

===Notable person===
*George Harry Dury (1916–1996), geographer and hydrologist, was born at Hellidon.

==Amenities==

Hellidon has a public house, the &quot;Red Lion&quot;. In January 2019 it still had a post office.

<text>Forrest Reid (24 June 1875, Belfast, Ireland; 4 January 1947, Warrenpoint, County Down, Northern Ireland) was an Irish novelist, literary critic and translator. He was a leading pre-war novelist of boyhood and is still acclaimed as a noted Ulster novelist, being awarded the 1944 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his novel &quot;Young Tom&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born in Belfast, he was the youngest son of a Protestant family of twelve, six of whom survived. He was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution. His father, Robert Reid (1825–1881), was the manager of a felt works, having failed as a shipowner at Liverpool, and came from a well-established upper-middle-class Ulster family; his mother, Frances Matilda, was his father&#x27;s second wife. She was the daughter of Captain Robert Parr, of the 54th Regiment of Foot, of the landed gentry Parr family of Shropshire, related to Catherine Parr, last wife of King Henry VIII. Reid entered Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1905, graduating BA in medieval and modern languages in 1908. He returned to Belfast, and met E. M. Forster, who remained a lifelong friend, in February 1912. After graduation Forster continued to visit Reid, who was then settled back in Belfast. In 1952, Forster traveled to Belfast to unveil a plaque commemorating Forrest Reid&#x27;s life (at 13 Ormiston Crescent).

==Works and influences==
As well as his fiction, Reid also translated poems from the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot; (&quot;Greek Authors&quot; (Faber, 1943)). His study of the work of W. B. Yeats (&quot;W. B. Yeats: A Critical Study&quot; (1915)) has been acclaimed as one of the best critical studies of that poet. He also wrote the definitive work on the English woodcut artists of the 1860s (&quot;Illustrators of the Sixties&quot; (1928)); his collection of original illustrations from that time is housed in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.

He was a close friend of Walter de la Mare, whom he first met in 1913, and about whose fiction he published a perceptive book in 1929. Reid was also an influence on novelist Stephen Gilbert, and had good connections to the Bloomsbury Group of writers. Reid was a founding member of the Imperial Art League (later the Artists League of Great Britain). Reid was also a close friend of Arthur Greeves, the artist known to be C. S. Lewis&#x27;s best friend. Greeves painted several portraits of Reid, now all in the possession of the Royal Belfast Academical Institution.

==Critical standing==
A &quot;Forrest Reid Collection&quot; is held at the University of Exeter, consisting of first editions of all his works and books about Reid. Many of his original manuscripts are in the archives of the Belfast Central Library. In 2008, Queen&#x27;s University Belfast catalogued a large collection of Forrest Reid documentary material it had recently acquired, including many letters from E.M. Forster.
