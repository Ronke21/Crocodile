<text>Trina Schart Hyman (April 8, 1939 – November 19, 2004) was an American illustrator of children&#x27;s books. She illustrated over 150 books, including fairy tales and Arthurian legends. She won the 1985 Caldecott Medal for U.S. picture book illustration, recognizing &quot;Saint George and the Dragon&quot;, retold by Margaret Hodges.

==Biography==
Born in Philadelphia to Margaret Doris Bruck and Albert H. Schart, she grew up in Wyncote, Pennsylvania and learned to read and draw at an early age. Her favorite story as a child was &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;, and she spent an entire year of her childhood wearing a red cape. She enrolled at the Philadelphia Museum College of Art (now part of the University of the Arts) in 1956, but moved to Boston, Massachusetts, in 1959 after marrying Harris Hyman, a mathematician and engineer. She graduated from School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in 1960. The couple then moved to Stockholm, Sweden, for two years, where Trina studied at the Konstfackskolan (Swedish State Art School) and illustrated her first children&#x27;s book, titled &quot;Toffe och den lilla bilen&quot; (&quot;Toffe and the Little Car&quot;).

In 1963, the couple&#x27;s daughter, Katrin Tchana (&quot;née&quot; Hyman), was born, but in 1968, they divorced, and Trina and Katrin moved to Lyme, New Hampshire. Trina lived for some time with children&#x27;s writer and editor Barbara Rogasky (with whom she collaborated on several projects). For about the last decade of her life, her romantic partner was teacher Jean K. Aull.
She was the first art director of &quot;Cricket&quot; Magazine, from 1973 to 1979, and contributed illustrations regularly until her death.

Many of her illustrations can be quite complex. For example, in one scene in &quot;Saint George and the Dragon&quot;, the dragon&#x27;s tail stretches into the border artwork of the next page.

==Awards and honors==
Hyman won the annual Caldecott Medal from the American Library Association, recognizing the year&#x27;s best-illustrated U.S. children&#x27;s picture book, for &quot;Saint George and the Dragon&quot;, published by Little, Brown in 1984. Margaret Hodges wrote the text, retelling Edmund Spenser&#x27;s version of the Saint George legend. She also won the Boston Globe–Horn Book Award for picture books, recognizing &quot;King Stork&quot; (Little, Brown, 1973), text by Howard Pyle (1853–1911).She won the Golden Kite Award for her illustration of &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; in 1984.

She received three Caldecott Honors, for her own retelling of &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; in 1984, &quot;Hershel and the Hanukkah Goblins&quot; by Eric Kimmel in 1990, and &quot;A Child&#x27;s Calendar&quot; by John Updike in 2000. And she was a Boston Globe–Horn Book picture book runner-up twice, for &quot;All in Free but Janey&quot; by Elizabeth Johnson in 1968 and &quot;On to Widecombe Fair&quot; by Patricia Gauch in 1978.

&quot;The Golem&quot; by Barbara Rogasky and illustrated by Hyman won the 1997 National Jewish Book Award in the Children&#x27;s Literature category.

<text>The Longchamp Racecourse (, ) is a 57 hectare horse-racing facility located on the Route des Tribunes at the Bois de Boulogne in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, France. It is used for flat racing and is noted for its variety of interlaced tracks and a famous hill that provides a real challenge to competing thoroughbreds. It has several racetracks varying from 1,000 to 4,000 metres in length, with 46 different starting posts.

The course is home to more than half of the group one races held in France, and it has a capacity of 50,000. The highlight of the calendar is the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe. Held on the first weekend in October, the event attracts the best horses from around the world.

The leather fashion goods company Longchamp got its name from the facility.

==History==

The first race run at Longchamp was on Sunday 27 April 1857, in front of a massive crowd. The Emperor Napoleon III and his wife Eugénie were present, having sailed down the Seine River on their private yacht to watch the third race. Until 1930, many Parisians came to the track down the river on steamboats and various other vessels, the trip taking around an hour to the Pont de Suresnes. The royal couple joined Prince Jérôme Bonaparte and his son Prince Napoleon in the Royal Enclosure alongside the Prince of Nassau, Prince Murat and the Duke of Morny, an avid racegoer. Non-aristocratic members of the upper classes were not permitted into the Royal Enclosure and had to be content with watching from their barouche carriages on the lawn.

A number of prominent artists have painted horse racing scenes at Longchamp, including the one seen here by Édouard Manet in 1867, and another four years later by Edgar Degas titled &quot;Race Horses at Longchamp&quot;.

Racing continued during WW2.

Longchamp also hosts Solidays music festival.

Lollapalooza Paris festival occurred on 16–17 July 2022

The Rolling Stones performed here on 30 June and 1 July of 1995 during their Voodoo Lounge Tour, and they played again on 23 July 2022 as part of the SIXTY tour.

<doc id="1204260" wikidata="Q1057792" url="?curid=1204260" title="Thundersnow">
<text>Thundersnow, also known as a winter thunderstorm or a thundersnow storm, is a thunderstorm in which snow falls as the primary precipitation instead of rain. It is considered a rare phenomenon. It typically falls in regions of strong upward motion within the cold sector of an extratropical cyclone. Thermodynamically, it is not different from any other type of thunderstorm, but the top of the cumulonimbus cloud is usually quite low. In addition to snow, graupel or hail may fall as well. The heavy snowfall tends to muffle the sound of the thunder so that it sounds more like a low rumble than the loud, sharp bang that is heard during regular thunderstorms.

Thundersnow can occur during a normal snowstorm that sustains strong vertical mixing which allows for favorable conditions for lightning and thunder to occur. It can also occur from the lake effect or ocean effect thunderstorm which is produced by cold air passing over relatively warm water; this effect commonly produces snow squalls over the Great Lakes.

==Occurrence==

===Americas===
Within the United States, thundersnow is relatively rare but most common in &quot;eastern Nevada and Utah, the central plains, and the Great Lake states&quot;. Thundersnow also occurs in Nova Scotia and in the Northeastern United States, especially in New England and New York, sometimes several times per winter season. On December 30, 2019, a severe thunderstorm warning was issued for parts of Massachusetts for a thunderstorm cell that was producing &quot;lightning, thundersnow, thundersleet, and thunderice&quot;. A &quot;really rare&quot; thundersnow storm occurred near Vancouver, British Columbia on December 17–18, 2022.

The South Region of Brazil registered episodes of thundersnow in 1984 and 2005, in the state of Santa Catarina, and in August 2011, in some municipalities of the highland region of Serra Gaúcha, in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul.

===Europe===
The British Isles and other parts of northwestern Europe occasionally report thunder and lightning during sleet or (usually wet) snow showers during winter and spring. Scotland registered an episode of thundersnow in the early hours of 4 December 2020, the unusual noise causing alarm among local people. The Met Office warned of thundersnow in Scotland, Wales and northern England in early January 2022.

Western Europe has rare occurrences of thundersnow, as on 8 March 2010, when northeastern Catalonia, including Barcelona, experienced a heavy snowfall accompanied by lightning, with snow depths surpassing in low altitude areas.

In Central Europe, a large-area (non-local) thundersnow occurred on 17 January 2022, when a strong synoptic-scale squall line passed north to south over whole central and eastern Poland, precipitating both granular snow and snowflakes, with discharge intensity exceeding 100 per minute. Other recent occurrences were in Poland and the Czech Republic in January 2023, Germany in January 2021, and Norway and Netherlands as well as Austria in April 2021, with previous occurrences in Norway in January 2019 and January 2020. Stockholm experienced thundersnow on 21 November 2022.

===Asia===
Low-pressure events in the eastern Mediterranean that originate from polar origin cause copious thundersnow occurrences during winter storms, especially over the elevated provinces of Israel and Jordan, including Amman and Jerusalem. When such storms happen at areas intended for skiing, the mountains are often evacuated for safety.

Thundersnow is also common around Kanazawa and the Sea of Japan, and even around Mount Everest.

==Formation==
Thundersnow is caused by the same mechanisms as regular thunderstorms, but it is much more rare because cold dense air is less likely to rise.

===Lake effect precipitation===

Lake effect thundersnow occurs after a cold front or shortwave aloft passes over a body of water. This steepens the thermal lapse rates between the lake temperature and the temperatures aloft. A difference in temperature of or more between the lake temperature and the temperature at about (the 850 hPa level) usually marks the onset of thundersnow, if surface temperatures are expected to be below freezing. However several factors, including other geographical elements, affect the development of thundersnow.

The primary factor is convective depth. This is the vertical depth in the troposphere that a parcel of air will rise from the ground before it reaches the equilibrium (EQL) level and stops rising. A minimum depth of is necessary, and an average depth of or more is generally accepted as sufficient. Wind shear is also a significant factor. Linear snow squall bands produce more thundersnow than clustered bands; thus a directional wind shear with a change of less than 12° between the ground and in height must be in place. However, any change in direction greater than 12° through that layer will tear the snow squall apart. A bare minimum fetch of is required so that the air passing over the lake or ocean water will become sufficiently saturated with moisture and will acquire thermal energy from the water.

The last component is the echo top or storm top temperature. This must be at least . It is generally accepted that at this temperature there is no longer any super cooled water vapour present in a cloud, but just ice crystals suspended in the air. This allows for the interaction of the ice cloud and graupel pellets within the storm to generate a charge, resulting in lightning and thunder.

===Synoptic forcing===
Synoptic snow storms tend to be large and complex, with many possible factors affecting the development of thundersnow. The best location in a storm to find thundersnow is typically in its NorthWest quadrant (in the Northern Hemisphere, based on observations in the Midwestern United States), within what is known as the &quot;comma head&quot; of a mature extratropical cyclone. Thundersnow can also be located underneath the TROWAL, a trough of warm air aloft which shows up in a surface weather analysis as an inverted trough extending backward into the cold sector from the main cyclone. In extreme cases, thunderstorms along the cold front are transported towards the center of the low-pressure system and will have their precipitation change to snow or ice, once the cold front becomes a portion of the occluded front. The 1991 Halloween blizzard, Superstorm of 1993, and White Juan are examples of such blizzards featuring thundersnow.

===Upslope flow===
Similar to the lake effect regime, thundersnow is usually witnessed in terrain in the cold sector of an extratropical cyclone when a shortwave aloft moves into the region. The shortwave will steepen the local lapse rates, allowing for a greater possibility of both heavy snow at elevations where it is near or below freezing, and occasionally thundersnow.

==Hazards==
Thundersnow produces heavy snowfall rates in the range of per hour. Snowfall of this intensity may limit visibilities severely, even during light wind conditions. However, thundersnow is often a part of a severe winter storm or blizzard. Winds of above tropical storm force are frequent with thundersnow. As a result, visibilities in thundersnow are frequently under 2/5th of a mile. Additionally, such wind creates extreme wind chills and may result in frostbite. Finally, there is a greater likelihood that thundersnow lightning will have a positive polarity, which is associated with a greater destructive potential than the more common negatively-charged lightning. That said, lightning is far less frequent in a thundersnow storm than in a summertime storm, and is usually of the cloud-to-cloud variety, rather than a strike that travels to the ground.

<text>Bruce Mau (born October 25, 1959) is a Canadian designer and educator. He began his career a graphic designer and has since applied his design methodology to architecture, art, museums, film, eco-environmental design, education, and conceptual philosophy. Mau is the chief executive officer of Massive Change Network, a Chicago-based design consultancy he co-founded with his wife, Bisi Williams. In 2015, he became the Chief Design Officer at Freeman, a global provider of brand experiences. Mau is also a professor and has taught at multiple institutions in the United States and Canada.

From 1985 to 2010, Mau was the creative director of Bruce Mau Design (BMD). In 2003, while still at BMD, he founded the Institute Without Boundaries in collaboration with the School of Design at George Brown College, Toronto. In 2010, Mau left the company and went on to co-found Massive Change Network in Chicago with his wife, Bisi Williams. Mau founded Bruce Mau Studio in 2020.

==Early life and education==
Mau was born in Pembroke, Ontario, on 25 October 1959 and spent his early years in Sudbury, Ontario. He attended Sudbury Secondary School. Mau chose to study art at the advice of the high school art teacher, Jack Smith, who mentored him in his early studies. He then studied at the Ontario College of Art &amp; Design in Toronto, and he studied advertising under Terry Isles. However, before graduation, he left the school to join the Fifty Fingers design group in 1980.

== Career ==
Mau stayed at Fifty Fingers for two years, before crossing the ocean for a brief sojourn at Pentagram in the UK. Returning to Toronto a year later, he became part of the founding triumvirate of Public Good Design and Communications. Soon after, the opportunity to design Zone 1/2 presented itself and he left to establish his own studio, Bruce Mau Design.

&quot;Zone 1/2: The Contemporary City&quot;, a complex compendium of critical thinking about urbanism from philosophers such as Gilles Deleuze and Paul Virilio, architects Rem Koolhaas and Christopher Alexander remains one of his most notable works. The firm has produced work for the Andy Warhol Museum, the Art Gallery of Ontario and the Gagosian Gallery. Mau remained the design director of Zone Books until 2004, to which he has added duties as co-editor of Swerve Editions, a Zone imprint. From 1991 to 1993, he also served as creative director of I.D. magazine.

He is a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts and served on the Herman Miller Design Council from 2008 to 2012.

He has lectured widely across North America and Europe. He served on the International Advisory Committee of the Wexner Center in Columbus, Ohio.

In 1998, Mau produced a 43-point program called an &quot;Incomplete Manifesto for Growth&quot; that attempts to help designers and creative folks think about their design process, the manifesto has been widely circulated on the web.

In 2006, he participated in the Stock Exchange of Visions.

In 2010 Bruce Mau and Bisi Williams founded the Massive Change Network.

In the 2010s, Bruce Mau Design was involved in the redevelopment and redesign of Ontario&#x27;s ONroute service centres.

As of November 19, 2015, Bruce Mau is the Chief Design Officer for Freeman, a brand experience company and service contractor.

In September 2022, Bruce Mau and Bisi Williams undertook a collaboration with the University of New South Wales through the Massive Change Network (MCN). This was called &#x27;Massive Action Sydney&#x27; and saw staff and students from the Faculty of Arts, Design and Architecture (ADA) form five &#x27;Renaissance Teams&#x27; to collaborate on ways to create Massive Action across some of the most perplexing and wicked challenges of our time. The project and its outcomes are ongoing. 

== Awards ==
He was awarded the Chrysler Award for Design Innovation in 1998, and the Toronto Arts Award for Architecture and Design in 1999. He is a Senior Fellow of the Design Futures Council, since 2006. Mau was awarded the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) Medal in 2007. In 2007, Mau was in residence at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, in the Architecture, Interior Architecture, and Design Objects department.

He received the Philadelphia Museum of Art&#x27;s Collab Design Excellence Award in 2015, in conjunction with an exhibition of his designs. Mau received the Cooper Hewitt 2016, National Design Award for Design Mind, for his impact on design theory, design practice and/or public awareness.

<text>The Cascades Lakes Scenic Byway (Forest Route 46) is a National Scenic Byway in central Oregon in the United States. It runs for in the rugged country of Deschutes and Klamath counties on the east side of the Cascade Range. It offers particularly good views of Mount Bachelor, Broken Top, and the Three Sisters (Oregon) mountains and provides access to many recreational facilities in central Oregon. The route is so named because it weaves past a number of small natural lakes along the Cascades as well as several reservoirs on the upper Deschutes River.

==Route description==
The northern terminus of the route is in Bend where it changes into NW Century Drive. It follows the two-lane Century Drive Highway west into the Deschutes National Forest and past the Mt. Bachelor Ski Area, then south along the Cascades into northern Klamath County, where it terminates on its southern end at its junction with Oregon Route 58, approximately 40 mi (64 km) southeast of Oakridge. Along the way, Century Drive (not the Century Drive Highway) turns east to Sunriver.

The Century Drive Highway begins at an interchange with US 97 (the Bend Parkway) in Bend. It heads west along Colorado Avenue and Century Drive, which it follows to the entrance to the Mount Bachelor Ski Resort, where Century Drive Highway ends.

The Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway continues south along the west side of Mount Bachelor. Beyond Mount Bachelor Ski Area, the byway passes Todd Lake, Sparks Lake, Devils Lake, Elk Lake, Hosmer Lake, Lava Lake, Little Lava Lake, and Cultus Lake. South of Crane Prairie Reservoir, the two routes split, with the scenic byway continuing to head south towards its terminus at Oregon Route 58. Century Drive instead heads back to the east, north of the Wickiup Reservoir, and then heads northeast parallel to the western shore of the Deschutes River. It eventually crosses the river, runs north for several miles, and then terminates at an intersection with US 97 near the resort community of Sunriver.

<doc id="1204272" wikidata="Q447058" url="?curid=1204272" title="Pietro Longhi">
<text>Pietro Longhi (5 November 1701 – 8 May 1785) was a Venetian painter of contemporary genre scenes of life.

==Biography==
Pietro Longhi was born in Venice in the parish of Saint Maria, first child of the silversmith Alessandro Falca and his wife, Antonia. He adopted the Longhi last name when he began to paint. He was initially taught by the Veronese painter Antonio Balestra, who then recommended the young painter to apprentice with the Bolognese Giuseppe Maria Crespi, who was highly regarded in his day for both religious and genre painting and was influenced by the work of Dutch painters. Longhi returned to Venice before 1732. He was married in 1732 to Caterina Maria Rizzi, by whom he had eleven children (only three of which reached the age of maturity).

Among his early paintings are some altarpieces and religious themes. His first major documented work was an altarpiece for the church of San Pellegrino in 1732. In 1734, he completed frescoes in the walls and ceiling of the hall in Ca&#x27; Sagredo, representing the &quot;Death of the giants&quot;. In the late 1730s, he began to specialize in the small-scale genre works that would lead him to be viewed in the future as the Venetian William Hogarth, painting subjects and events of everyday life in Venice. Longhi&#x27;s gallant interior scenes reflect the 18th century&#x27;s turn towards the private and the bourgeois, and were extremely popular.
Many of his paintings show Venetians at play, such as the depiction of the crowd of genteel citizens awkwardly gawking at a freakish Indian rhinoceros. This painting, on display at the National Gallery in London, chronicles Clara the rhinoceros brought to Europe in 1741 by a Dutch sea captain and impresario from Leyden, Douvemont van der Meer. This rhinoceros was exhibited in Venice in 1751. There are two versions of this painting, nearly identical except for the unmasked portraits of two men in Ca&#x27; Rezzonico version. Ultimately, there may be a punning joke to the painting, since the young man on the left holds aloft the sawed-off &quot;horn&quot; (metaphor for cuckoldry) of the animal. Perhaps this explains the difference between the unchaperoned women. 

Other paintings chronicle the daily activities such as the gambling parlors (&quot;Ridotti&quot;) that proliferated in the 18th century. Nearly half of the figures in his genre paintings are faceless, hidden behind Venetian Carnival masks. In some, the insecure or naive posture and circumstance, the puppet-like delicacy of the persons, seem to suggest a satirical perspective of the artists toward his subjects. That this puppet-like quality was an intentional conceit on Longhi&#x27;s part is attested by the skillful rendering of figures in his earlier history paintings and in his drawings. Longhi&#x27;s many drawings, typically in black chalk or pencil heightened with white chalk on colored paper, were often done for their own sake, rather than as studies for paintings.

In the 1750s, Longhi—like Crespi before him—was commissioned to paint seven canvases documenting the seven Catholic sacraments. These are now in Pinacoteca Querini Stampalia along with his scenes from the hunt (&quot;Caccia&quot;).

From 1763 Longhi was Director of the Academy of Drawing and Carving. From this period, he began to work extensively with portraiture, and was actively assisted by his son, Alessandro. Longhi died on 8 May 1785, following a short illness.

==Legacy==

Celebrated genre canvases were produced by other contemporary artists in Italy such as Gaspare Traversi and Giuseppe Maria Crespi. Longhi had not only departed the world of grand mythology of history that often allured the Venetian nobility, but also taken residence in its intimate present, as few painters in Venice had ever done. If Canaletto and Guardi are our window to the external rituals of the republic, Longhi is our window to what happened inside rooms. The critic Bernard Berenson states that: Longhi painted for the picture-loving Venetians their own lives in all their ordinary domestic and fashionable phases. In the hair-dressing scenes, we hear the gossip of the periwigged barber; in the dressmaking scenes, the chatter of the maid; in the dancing-school, the pleasant music of the violin. There is no tragic note anywhere. Everybody dresses, dances, makes bows, takes coffee, as if there were nothing else in the world that wanted doing. A tone of high courtesy, of great refinement, coupled with an all-pervading cheerfulness, distinguishes Longhi&#x27;s pictures from the works of Hogarth, at once so brutal and so full of presage of change.

==Masks==

In numerous paintings, Longhi depicts masked figures engaging in various acts from gambling to flirting. For example, in the foreground of Longhi&#x27;s painting &quot;The Meeting of the Procuratore and His Wife&quot; is a woman being greeted by a man that is presumed to be her husband. The setting is of a type of gathering place usually for masked people to engage in private matters such as romantic encounters. The woman and her husband are unmasked, but at the left, a seated woman is unmasking herself to address a masked man leaning over her shoulder. This act may suggest that the woman&#x27;s Moretta mask, which lacks an opening for the mouth, requires her to unmask herself in order to speak; another interpretation is that the woman is interested enough in the masked man to remove her mask in order to reveal her true identity to him.
In &quot;The Charlatan&quot; (1757) the charlatan is relegated to the background, where he stands on top of a table surrounded by admiring women and a young boy. In the foreground, a masked woman seems to fiddle with her fan and slyly look at a masked man who lifts part of her dress. There is a sense of duality as the ordinary event of the man on the top of the table is contrasted with the reality of Venetian life represented by the couple indulging themselves; this is similar to the duality of the mask used by his subjects to hide physically, but to expose their unconscious desires.
In &quot;The Ridotto in Venice&quot; (ca. 1750s), Longhi depicts one of the main gambling halls in Venice. The scene is crowded with masked and unmasked figures. The focal point in this work depicts a now-familiar scene of a shy woman and an aggressive man who lifts her dress. Repeating the figures of the flirtatious couple, Longhi displays the Ridotto as a place where the social elite— who would not exhibit such behavior in public nor unmasked—would abandon all inhibitions and pursue their actual desires.

<text>Christopher Mitchum (born October 16, 1943) is an American film actor, screenwriter, and businessman. He was born in Los Angeles, California, the second son of film star Robert Mitchum and Dorothy Mitchum. He is the younger brother of actor James Mitchum.

==Film career==

Mitchum appeared in more than 60 films in 14 countries. He appeared with John Wayne in the motion pictures &quot;Chisum&quot; (1970), &quot;Rio Lobo&quot; (1970), and &quot;Big Jake&quot; (1971). He was cited by Box Office magazine as one of the top five stars of the future and the recipient of Photoplay&#x27;s Gold Medal Award for 1972. He won both The Golden Horse Award (1981) and The Golden Reel, Best Actor award (1988, Indonesia). He has been a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1978. He was the Screen Actors Guild national first vice president, in 1987–89 and a member of the SAG board of directors, in 1983–89.

==Personal life==
Mitchum married Cynthia &quot;Cindy&quot; Davis in 1964. Together, they had children Bentley, Carrie, Jennifer, and Kian before divorcing in 1996. For four years in the 1990s, Mitchum was father-in-law to Carrie&#x27;s husband, Casper Van Dien. Mitchum is the grandfather of Cappy Van Dien, Grace Van Dien, Allexanne Mitchum, Carrington Mitchum, and Wyatt Mitchum Cardone.

Mitchum has resided in the Santa Barbara, California area (Central Coast) since 1984. A Republican, he ran for the California State Assembly in 1998, losing the general election to Democrat Hannah-Beth Jackson. In 2012 and 2014, he ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 24th Congressional District; he lost the primary in 2012 to former lieutenant governor Abel Maldonado, and the general in 2014 to 16-year Democratic incumbent Lois Capps.

==State and federal office candidacies==
Mitchum has run once for the California State Assembly (35th District), and twice for the U.S. House of Representatives (California&#x27;s 24th District). Since January 1, 2011, under California law, candidates are voter-nominated for state and federal offices; political parties cannot nominate candidates for office.

=== California Assembly ===
In 1998, Mitchum was the Republican nominee in the general election for the California State Assembly in the 35th district, which included portions of Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties, where he served on the Republican Central Committee (1998–2000). His opponents were Democrat Hannah-Beth Jackson and Natural Law Party candidate Eric Dahl. Mitchum came in second behind Jackson with 44.5 percent of the vote to Jackson&#x27;s 53 percent.

=== U.S. Congress ===

In 2012, Mitchum ran for the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican candidate in California&#x27;s 24th district (San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and part of Ventura counties), challenging incumbent Democratic Congresswoman Lois Capps. In the June 5, 2012 primary, he came in third, behind Republican Abel Maldonado and Capps, and ahead of Independent candidate Matt Boutté.

In 2014, Mitchum ran again for the U.S. congressional seat held by Representative Capps. He won the June 3, 2014, primary (running alongside four other Republicans, two additional Democrats, and an Independent candidate), coming in second behind Capps with 15.8 percent of the vote, and narrowly defeating Republican Justin Fareed by slightly over 600 votes. In the November 4 general election, Mitchum received 48.1 percent of the vote to Capps&#x27;s 51.9 percent, in the closest race of Capps&#x27;s entire congressional career.

Despite the close margin by which Mitchum lost to Capps, as well as the announcement that Capps would retire in 2016, Mitchum ultimately declined a third run for the same seat again, and instead endorsed Assemblyman Katcho Achadjian for the race to succeed Capps.

<text>Alessandro Longhi (12 June 1733 – November 1813) was a Venetian portrait painter and printmaker in etching (mostly reproductions of paintings). He is known best for his oil portraits of Venetian nobles of state. His father was the famed genre painter Pietro Longhi. He trained under his father and Giuseppe Nogari (1699–1763). Like Sebastiano Bombelli in the prior century, Alessandro Longhi is noted for his zealous full-length depictions of robes and emblems of office. His &quot;tumultuous and unusual (etching) technique shows first-hand knowledge of Rembrandt&#x27;s etchings&quot;, according to Olimpia Theodoli.

<text>Augustus Baldwin Longstreet (September 22, 1790 – July 9, 1870) was an American lawyer, minister, journalist, educator, and humorist, known for his book &quot;Georgia Scenes&quot;. He held strong pro-slavery and pro-secessionist views which he publicly advocated for in his various positions. He personally owned dozens of slaves throughout his life. He held the presidency of several southern universities, including the University of Mississippi (twice), South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina), and Emory College (now Emory University).

Longstreet was the uncle of the senior Confederate General James Longstreet, whom he helped raise, and to whom he was a mentor.

==Life and career==
Longstreet was born in Augusta, Georgia, a son of the inventor William Longstreet. He graduated from Yale University in 1813, studied law in Litchfield, Connecticut, and was admitted to the bar in Richmond County, Georgia. He soon moved and rose to eminence as a lawyer in Greensboro, Georgia. He represented Greene County in the state legislature in 1821, and in 1822 became a district judge in Ocmulgee. After several years as a judge, he declined re-election and resumed his legal practice in Augusta, Georgia, did editorial work, and established the &quot;Augusta Sentinel&quot;, which soon merged with &quot;The Augusta Chronicle&quot; (1838).

Longstreet had begun to write for the press at an early age, and his pen was never idle. His chief periodical contributions are to be found in &quot;The Methodist Quarterly&quot;, &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot;, &quot;The Southern Field and Fireside&quot;, &quot;The Magnolia&quot;, and &quot;The Orion&quot;, and include &quot;Letters to Clergymen of the Northern Methodist Church&quot; and &quot;Letters from Georgia to Massachusetts.&quot;

Longstreet&#x27;s literary fame is based on his authorship of &quot;Georgia Scenes, Characters, Incidents, &amp;c. in the First Half Century of the Republic&quot; (1835), originally published in newspapers, then gathered into a volume in the South, and finally published in New York in 1840. It featured realistic sketches of Southern humor, and, according to historian Elizabeth R. Varon, &quot;helped give rise to the literary genre of Southwestern humor and &#x27;local color&#x27; stories featuring the customs and dialects of rural folk and thus creating an antecedent for Mark Twain.&quot; It is said that Longstreet sent out men in an attempt to collect and destroy all copies of the first edition and that he disavowed the second, published in 1867.

In 1838, Longstreet became a Methodist minister. During the period of his ministry, the town was struck by yellow fever, and he ministered to the sick and dying.

During his years as a minister, Longstreet preached a doctrine of secession and defended slavery. He was conspicuous in the turmoil that led to the breakup of the Methodist Church into Northern and Southern branches. In a pamphlet published in 1845, he told Northern abolitionist &quot;What you believe to be sinful, we believe to be perfectly innocent.&quot; He portrayed blacks as a &quot;tribe of self-infuriated madmen, rushing through the country with the Bible in one hand and a torch in the other – preaching peace, and scattering the flames of civil war,&quot; and said that they were creating a &quot;system of warfare against Slavery.&quot;

In 1839, Longstreet was made president of Emory College. After nine years he accepted the presidency of Centenary College, Louisiana, then of the University of Mississippi, where he stayed for six years, after which he resigned, and became a planter. Four years later, in 1857, he became president of South Carolina College. Just before the Civil War, he returned to his old presidency in Mississippi.

As an educator, Longstreet urged Southerners to &quot;elevate and purify the education of the South&quot; by creating their own pro-slavery literary culture and rejecting &quot;polluted&quot; Northern literature and journals. He warned one graduating class in 1859 to expect to be &quot;condemned for your patriotism, and tormented for your benefactions&quot; by Northerners.

In 1860, Longstreet was a delegate to the prestigious International Statistical Conference in London, but conspicuously withdrew himself because of the presence of a Black delegate, Martin Delany, a physician and an abolitionist, claiming that Delany&#x27;s presence was an insult to the South. In December, Longstreet published a polemic on the incident, &quot;An Appeal to the South&quot;, in which he wrote &quot;I do not believe there exists on the face of the earth two nations who more cordially detest each other than the slaveholding and nonslaveholding states of this Republic&quot;, and urged the South to&quot;declare war against [their] oppressors&quot;.

In politics Longstreet – a life-long Democrat – belonged to the Jeffersonian school of strict construction and states rights. He made speeches on all occasions through his life. Scholar Lewis M. Purifoy notes that [I]n a baccalaureate address to the University of South Carolina graduating class of 1859, [Longstreet] urged the young men of his audience to defend Southern rights to the utmost. While they should not strive to break up the Union, they should not &#x27;make a dishonorable surrender of the thousandth part of the mill more to save it.&#x27; He defended slavery mainly on the ground that freeing [slaves] would be ruinous to Southern society; and the burden of his speech was that the South had suffered long and grievously at the hand of the North. Longstreet assured the class that secession would not lead to war, but, if it should, a united South would win.

&quot;I have heard him,&quot; writes a person who knew Longstreet, &quot;respond to a serenade, preach a funeral sermon, deliver a college commencement address, and make a harangue over the pyrotechnic glorifications of seceding states. He could never be scared up without a speech.&quot;

Following the Civil War, Longstreet continued to be an unrepentant and unreconstructed advocate of white supremacy, and a fierce critic of Reconsruction and the administration of President Ulysses S. Grant, despite the fact that his nephew, former Confederate General James Lonstreet, supported both the Republican Party and Grant, an antebellum friend. In two essays published in 1869-1870, Augustus cited the &quot;barbarism&quot; of the Union&#x27;s war-making and of Grant&#x27;s generalship, and complained that Northerners were putting &quot;[the] bright Caucasian under the stupid African&quot;, making &quot;slaves freemen and freemen slaves.&quot;

Longstreet died in Oxford, Mississippi and is buried in section one of St. Peter&#x27;s Cemetery.

Longstreet was a long-time friend and associate of John C. Calhoun, who was his classmate at Yale.

==Family==
Longstreet was a mentor for his nephew James Longstreet, a future high-ranking Confederate general, who lived with him on his plantation, Westover, from 1830 to 1838 in order to attend a nearby school.

Longstreet&#x27;s daughter Virginia married the future Supreme Court justice Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar in Oxford, Georgia in 1847, while Augustus was president of Emory College. They were married in the &quot;President&#x27;s House&quot; at Emory, which is today the Dean&#x27;s residence for Oxford College of Emory University. The newlywed couple would later follow him to Mississippi when he became president of The University of Mississippi.

American actress Lara Parker is his third-great-granddaughter.

==Legacy==
Longstreet Theater on the University of South Carolina campus is named in his honor; in July 2021, the university&#x27;s Presidential Commission on University History recommended removing his name from the building.

Kahn has worked with various artists such as Taylor Swift, Britney Spears, Eminem, Backstreet Boys, Imagine Dragons, Lady Gaga, Rob Thomas, Snoop Dogg, Chris Brown, Kelly Clarkson, Ava Max, Mariah Carey and Destiny&#x27;s Child.

==Early life==
Kahn was born Ahn Jun-hee () in Busan, South Korea. His family spent part of his childhood there and in Livorno, Italy until moving to Jersey Village, Texas, a suburb of Houston, when Joseph was seven. After graduating from Jersey Village High School in 1990, Kahn went to New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts but dropped out after a year. Returning to Houston, began to direct hip hop music videos.

==Career==
===Music videos===
Kahn&#x27;s videography spans thirty years. In the mid-1990s he directed music videos for artists including Aaliyah, Ice Cube, Backstreet Boys and Snoop Dogg. In 2003, Kahn won his first Grammy for Eminem&#x27;s &quot;Without Me&quot; video which also won the MTV VMA&#x27;s Best Video of the Year, as well as Best Direction. His video for Katy Perry &quot;Waking Up in Vegas&quot; won the MVPA 2009 Best Video of the Year.

Kahn&#x27;s usage of Japanese pop culture in music videos first began with Janet Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Doesn&#x27;t Really Matter&quot; video. The video was also the most expensive video Kahn has directed and is among the most expensive of all time, costing over $2.5 million.

In 2014, Kahn was given The Icon Award by the UK Music Video Awards. In 2015, Kahn directed MTV&#x27;s choices for Video of the Year, Best Pop Video, Best Female Video, and Best Collaboration for multiple videos from American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;1989&quot;, including &quot;Blank Space&quot;, &quot;Bad Blood&quot;, &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; and &quot;Out of the Woods&quot; and her sixth studio album &quot;Reputation&quot;, including &quot;Look What You Made Me Do&quot;, &quot;...Ready for It?&quot;, &quot;End Game&quot; and &quot;Delicate&quot;.

In 2022, Kahn directed a music video for Chris Brown&#x27;s &quot;Iffy&quot;.

===Film===

Kahn also directed the 2004 action film &quot;Torque&quot; starring Ice Cube. In May 2007, it was announced that he would direct an adaptation of William Gibson&#x27;s science fiction classic &quot;Neuromancer&quot; for producer Peter Hoffman. On May 7, 2010, &quot;Fangoria&quot; reported that Vincenzo Natali, the director of &quot;Cube&quot; and &quot;Splice&quot;, had taken over directing duties and would also rewrite the screenplay. In 2011, Kahn directed the low-budget self-financed horror comedy &quot;Detention&quot;. After winning a number of audience favorite awards on the film festival circuit, &quot;Detention&quot; was picked up for theatrical distribution by Sony for a release in 2012.
In July 2016, test footage for the DC Comics character Swamp Thing was released which was directed by Kahn for the potential Justice League Dark film.

The film was produced by Eminem and premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, where it won the People&#x27;s Choice Award in the Midnight Madness section. &quot;Bodied&quot; continued to pick up the Audience Awards at both AFI Fest and Austin&#x27;s Fantastic Fest.

<text>Alfred Malherbe (14 July 1804 – 14 August 1865) was a French magistrate and amateur naturalist born in Mauritius to Pierre Marie François Malherbe and Rosalie Le Meusnier Molineuf. The family originally came from Metz. Alfred became the administrator of the Museum of Metz (being its director until 1863).

He devoted his spare time to botany and zoology (especially ornithology). He conducted studies of birds of Algeria (describing numerous species) and Sicily.

Malherbe was the author of &quot;Monographie des picidées&quot; (1859–62, 4 vols.), the first global survey of the woodpeckers. He described and named Levaillant&#x27;s woodpecker, after French ornithologist François Le Vaillant. In addition to &quot;Monographie des picidées&quot;, he was the author of several other ornithological works:
* &quot;Faune ornithologique de la Sicile : avec des observations sur l&#x27;habitat ou l&#x27;apparition des oiseaux de cette île&quot;, etc. (1843) - Ornithological fauna of Sicily.
* &quot;Description de dix espéces nouvelles du genre Picus, Linné.&quot;, (1845) - Description of ten new species from the genus &quot;Picus&quot;.
* &quot;Faune ornithologique de l&#x27;Algérie&quot; (1855) - Ornithological fauna of Algeria.

Parts of his collections of birds from Algeria and Europe were donated to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in Calcutta. The main collections were acquired by Hercules Turati and then gifted to the natural history museum at Milan.

<text>Dynamite Headdy is a platform video game developed by Treasure and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis in 1994. The game follows a puppet named Headdy in his efforts to stop an evil puppet king from taking over his world. Headdy can throw his head at enemies to defeat them and use it to pull himself to various areas and move objects. The player can find a wide variety of &quot;heads&quot; which act as power-ups that provide different effects and alter gameplay.

Critical reception to &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot; was positive. Critics highlighted the game&#x27;s originality and creativity in distinguishing it among other games in the platform genre. They also commended Treasure for demonstrating their technical expertise with impressive graphical effects and building on the success of their earlier game &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; (1993). In reviews from the time and in retrospect, &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot; is cited as one of the best games on the Genesis, and has since been included in multiple compilations of classic Genesis games. An 8-bit port was released for Game Gear, which itself served as the basis for a Master System port released in Brazil.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot; is a platform game in which the player controls Headdy, a puppet with a detachable head. The story follows Headdy in his adventures to save his world from the evil puppet King Dark Demon, who is transforming all the puppets of the world into his evil minions. To succeed, Headdy must overcome the King&#x27;s army, which features the likes of Trouble Bruin and the key masters which serve as stage bosses. Headdy can jump and throw his head in any direction to attack enemies. His head can also be used to grab hooks and pull himself up to other platforms. Headdy&#x27;s health is represented by a spotlight in the corner of the screen which changes colors. If the player does not pick up restorative items to heal themselves after suffering damage from enemies, they will lose a life.

During his adventure, Headdy will find power-ups which change the design and function of his head. These 17 power-ups range from increasing damage, such as spinning fireballs around his head, to providing invincibility, restoring health, increasing speed, etc. Some of these power-ups last for only a short time. Other than heads, the player can also find health restoratives, extra points, and extra lives throughout the levels. By finding the Liberty Head, players can enter a Bonus Stage in which the player must shoot basketballs into the correct hoops. Unlike other platform games where falling into a bottomless pit results instant death, if Headdy falls off, he will bounce back up which allows the player to put him back on a platform, though Headdy will still sustain some damage.

==Development and release==
After developing &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot;, Treasure was divided into four teams to work on four separate projects: &quot;Alien Soldier&quot;, &quot;Light Crusader&quot;, &quot;Yū Yū Hakusho Makyō Tōitsusen&quot;, and &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot;. Development of &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot; started in August 1993. Inspiration for the game came from Koichi Kimura, who wanted to work on an original project. Up to this point in his five-year career, Kimura had only worked on projects using the pre-existing works of others. Kimura lead development, and president of Treasure, Masato Maegawa, served as head programmer.

Kimura designed &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot; to be commercially viable. He wanted the main character to attack with a part of its body, so he felt a puppet that could throw its head would be appealing. Not wanting Headdy to be a stereotypical lone hero, Kimura added support characters that appear in every stage. The game&#x27;s visual design was inspired by Western animation and the work of film director Terry Gilliam. After deciding to publish a localized version for overseas markets, Maegawa was told by Sega of America to make the game more difficult. This was because Sega did not want customers completing the game too easily on rental. Maegawa happily obliged, and the North American release was made about twice as difficult. In addition to changes in difficulty, most of the dialogue in the game was removed, and several of the character and boss sprites were changed.

&quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot; was originally released in Japan on 5 August 1994 for the Sega Genesis, with North American and European releases following in September and October respectively. A port was released for the Game Gear, and a Master System port based on the Game Gear version was released exclusively in Brazil. A 32X conversion was planned but canceled. The game was included along with &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; and &quot;Alien Soldier&quot; in &quot;Sega Ages 2500: Gunstar Heroes Treasure Box&quot;, a compilation released for the PlayStation 2 in 2006 in Japan. The compilation includes all versions of &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot; released on all three Sega platforms across all regions. The game saw a digital re-release on the Wii via the Virtual Console in July 2007. It was also included in &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and was released on Steam on 2 May 2012. In 2018, it was included in the multi-platform compilation &quot;Sega Genesis Classics&quot;. In 2021, &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot; was added to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.

==Reception==
&quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot; received critical acclaim, with some believing it to be one of the best games on the Genesis. Journalists repeatedly highlighted the game&#x27;s creativity as a strong point. Rik Skews of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; said it &quot;breathes new life&quot; into the platform genre and stood up to the likes of the &quot;Sonic&quot; series. The staff at &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; found the game innovative and liked how each stage introduced new concepts to keep gameplay fresh. Tim Tucker at &quot;GamesMaster&quot; believed that Treasure was doing more innovation in the genre than any of its rivals. In addition to the game&#x27;s originality, critics praised Treasure&#x27;s programming expertise and &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot;&#x27;s technical prowess. The staff of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; complimented the game&#x27;s visual effects and colorful stages. Tucker said &quot;&quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot; is full of classic Treasure overstatement&quot; and cited the impressive colors, big explosions, large sprites, and rapidly changing backgrounds—which all together were perhaps a little too overwhelming. The &quot;Mean Machines&quot; staff believed that &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot; followed in the footsteps of Treasure&#x27;s previous games and therefore confirmed the studio&#x27;s technical expertise. The gameplay drew some criticism, with Tucker finding it somewhat disjointed and &quot;patchy&quot; and &quot;Mean Machines&quot; stating that it takes a few stages to truly find its footing.

Critics found the Game Gear port to be well done given the system&#x27;s less powerful technology. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; staff called it one of the best portable action games. Richard Leadbetter of &quot;Sega Magazine&quot; believed that since much of the Genesis version&#x27;s playability came from the system&#x27;s technical capabilities, the Game Gear version suffers in that sense, but still believed Treasure was able to create a fun 8-bit port.

In retrospective reviews of the Genesis version, &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot; has continued to receive considerable praise. Critics agreed that the game is excellent despite not receiving the same legendary status as some of Treasure&#x27;s other works such as &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot;, &quot;Ikaruga&quot; and &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot;. Lucas M. Thomas of &quot;IGN&quot; said the game is overload on the eyes, but it makes sense with respect to Treasure&#x27;s chaotic design. Frank Provo of &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted the game&#x27;s impressive graphical effects, large bosses, and bizarre premise providing the same level of excitement as &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot;. Damien McFarren of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; called it one of the best Treasure games of the Genesis era and one of the best platformers on the system.

<doc id="1204294" wikidata="Q5572389" url="?curid=1204294" title="Gluing axiom">
<text>In mathematics, the gluing axiom is introduced to define what a sheaf formula_1 on a topological space formula_2 must satisfy, given that it is a presheaf, which is by definition a contravariant functor

:formula_3

to a category formula_4 which initially one takes to be the category of sets. Here formula_5 is the partial order of open sets of formula_2 ordered by inclusion maps; and considered as a category in the standard way, with a unique morphism

:formula_7

if formula_8 is a subset of formula_9, and none otherwise.

As phrased in the sheaf article, there is a certain axiom that formula_10 must satisfy, for any open cover of an open set of formula_2. For example, given open sets formula_8 and formula_9 with union formula_2 and intersection formula_15, the required condition is that

:formula_16 is the subset of formula_17 With equal image in formula_18

In less formal language, a section formula_19 of formula_10 over formula_2 is equally well given by a pair of sections :formula_22 on formula_8 and formula_9 respectively, which &#x27;agree&#x27; in the sense that formula_25 and formula_26 have a common image in formula_18 under the respective restriction maps

:formula_28

and

:formula_29.

The first major hurdle in sheaf theory is to see that this &quot;gluing&quot; or &quot;patching&quot; axiom is a correct abstraction from the usual idea in geometric situations. For example, a vector field is a section of a tangent bundle on a smooth manifold; this says that a vector field on the union of two open sets is (no more and no less than) vector fields on the two sets that agree where they overlap.

Given this basic understanding, there are further issues in the theory, and some will be addressed here. A different direction is that of the Grothendieck topology, and yet another is the logical status of &#x27;local existence&#x27; (see Kripke–Joyal semantics).

==Removing restrictions on &quot;C&quot;==
To rephrase this definition in a way that will work in any category formula_4 that has sufficient structure, we note that we can write the objects and morphisms involved in the definition above in a diagram which we will call (G), for &quot;gluing&quot;:

:formula_31

Here the first map is the product of the restriction maps

:formula_32

and each pair of arrows represents the two restrictions

:formula_33

and

:formula_34.

It is worthwhile to note that these maps exhaust all of the possible restriction maps among formula_8, the formula_36, and the formula_37.

The condition for formula_1 to be a sheaf is that for any open set formula_8 and any collection of open sets formula_40 whose union is formula_8, the diagram (G) above is an equalizer.

One way of understanding the gluing axiom is to notice that formula_8 is the colimit of the following diagram:

:formula_43

The gluing axiom says that formula_1 turns colimits of such diagrams into limits.

==Sheaves on a basis of open sets==
In some categories, it is possible to construct a sheaf by specifying only some of its sections. Specifically, let formula_2 be a topological space with basis formula_46. We can define a category formula_47 to be the full subcategory of formula_5 whose objects are the formula_49. A B-sheaf on formula_2 with values in formula_4 is a contravariant functor

:formula_52

which satisfies the gluing axiom for sets in formula_53. That is, on a selection of open sets of formula_2, formula_1 specifies all of the sections of a sheaf, and on the other open sets, it is undetermined.

B-sheaves are equivalent to sheaves (that is, the category of sheaves is equivalent to the category of B-sheaves). Clearly a sheaf on formula_2 can be restricted to a B-sheaf. In the other direction, given a B-sheaf formula_1 we must determine the sections of formula_1 on the other objects of formula_5. To do this, note that for each open set formula_8, we can find a collection formula_61 whose union is formula_8. Categorically speaking, this choice makes formula_8 the colimit of the full subcategory of formula_53 whose objects are formula_61. Since formula_1 is contravariant, we define formula_67 to be the limit of the formula_68 with respect to the restriction maps. (Here we must assume that this limit exists in formula_4.) If formula_8 is a basic open set, then formula_8 is a terminal object of the above subcategory of formula_53, and hence formula_73. Therefore, formula_74 extends formula_1 to a presheaf on formula_2. It can be verified that formula_74 is a sheaf, essentially because every element of every open cover of formula_2 is a union of basis elements (by the definition of a basis), and every pairwise intersection of elements in an open cover of formula_2 is a union of basis elements (again by the definition of a basis).

==The logic of &quot;C&quot;==
The first needs of sheaf theory were for sheaves of abelian groups; so taking the category formula_4 as the category of abelian groups was only natural. In applications to geometry, for example complex manifolds and algebraic geometry, the idea of a &quot;sheaf of local rings&quot; is central. This, however, is not quite the same thing; one speaks instead of a locally ringed space, because it is not true, except in trite cases, that such a sheaf is a functor into a category of local rings. It is the &quot;stalks&quot; of the sheaf that are local rings, not the collections of &quot;sections&quot; (which are rings, but in general are not close to being &quot;local&quot;). We can think of a locally ringed space formula_2 as a parametrised family of local rings, depending on formula_82 in formula_2.

A more careful discussion dispels any mystery here. One can speak freely of a sheaf of abelian groups, or rings, because those are algebraic structures (defined, if one insists, by an explicit signature). Any category formula_4 having finite products supports the idea of a group object, which some prefer just to call a group &quot;in&quot; formula_4. In the case of this kind of purely algebraic structure, we can talk &quot;either&quot; of a sheaf having values in the category of abelian groups, or an &quot;abelian group in the category of sheaves of sets&quot;; it really doesn&#x27;t matter.

In the local ring case, it does matter. At a foundational level we must use the second style of definition, to describe what a local ring means in a category. This is a logical matter: axioms for a local ring require use of existential quantification, in the form that for any formula_86 in the ring, one of formula_86 and formula_88 is invertible. This allows one to specify what a &#x27;local ring in a category&#x27; should be, in the case that the category supports enough structure.

==Sheafification==
To turn a given presheaf formula_89 into a sheaf formula_1, there is a standard device called sheafification or sheaving. The rough intuition of what one should do, at least for a presheaf of sets, is to introduce an equivalence relation, which makes equivalent data given by different covers on the overlaps by refining the covers. One approach is therefore to go to the stalks and recover the sheaf space of the &quot;best possible&quot; sheaf formula_1 produced from formula_89.

This use of language strongly suggests that we are dealing here with adjoint functors. Therefore, it makes sense to observe that the sheaves on formula_2 form a full subcategory of the presheaves on formula_2. Implicit in that is the statement that a morphism of sheaves is nothing more than a natural transformation of the sheaves, considered as functors. Therefore, we get an abstract characterisation of sheafification as left adjoint to the inclusion. In some applications, naturally, one does need a description.

In more abstract language, the sheaves on formula_2 form a reflective subcategory of the presheaves (Mac Lane–Moerdijk &quot;Sheaves in Geometry and Logic&quot; p. 86). In topos theory, for a Lawvere–Tierney topology and its sheaves, there is an analogous result (ibid. p. 227).

==Other gluing axioms==
The gluing axiom of sheaf theory is rather general. One can note that the Mayer–Vietoris axiom of homotopy theory, for example, is a special case.

<text>Longwy (; older , ; ) is a commune in the French department of Meurthe-et-Moselle, Lorraine, administrative region of Grand Est, northeastern France.

The inhabitants are known as &quot;Longoviciens&quot;.

In 2008, the &quot;ville neuve&quot; (&quot;New Town&quot;) was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as part of the &quot;Fortifications of Vauban&quot; group for its contributions to the development of military architecture and engineering.

==Economy==
Longwy has historically been an industrial center of the Lorraine iron mining district. Factories lined the river in historic postcards.

The town is also known for its artistic faience, produced there since 1798. It is produced today by the Société des faïenceries de Longwy et Senelle, often in cooperation with artists and ceramists. Overglaze enamel decoration, known as &quot;émaux&quot; and often in a manner similar to cloisonné, has been produced in Longwy ceramics since 1872. Initially produced under the direction of Amadeo de Carenza, this style reached a peak in the Art Deco style, retailed by the Parisian department store Printemps.

==Transport==

Route nationale 52 (part of European route E411) passes through Longwy. Longwy station has rail connections to Luxembourg, Charleville-Mézières and Nancy.

==History==
Longwy initially belonged to Lotharingia. After the division of that kingdom, the town became part of Upper Lorraine and ultimately the Duchy of Bar. Longwy was ceded to Wenceslaus I of Luxembourg in 1368, but was returned to Bar in 1378. The Duchy of Bar was then annexed into the Duchy of Lorraine in 1480.

From 1648 to 1660 Longwy was part of the Kingdom of France, returning to the Duchy of Lorraine afterwards. It was made part of France again in 1670, a situation which was finalized in the Treaties of Nijmegen in 1678. Vauban fortified the town during the reign of Louis XIV, having demolished the medieval Château de Longwy, of which one tower remains.

After the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, almost all of the Moselle department, along with Alsace and portions of the Meurthe and Vosges departments, was ceded to the German Empire by the Treaty of Frankfurt on the ground that the population in those areas spoke German dialects. Only one fifth of Moselle, including Longwy, was spared annexation. Otto von Bismarck later bitterly regretted his decision when it was discovered that the region of Briey and Longwy was rich with iron ore, exploited by the Aciéries de Longwy among other members of the cartel Comptoir Métallurgique de Longwy.

After the Battle of the Ardennes in August 1914, Longwy was occupied by the Imperial German army until the 1918 Armistice. At the start of the war the fort at Longwy was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Natalis Constant Darche. With a force of 3,500 men he was able to hold up the German 5th Army for three weeks.

<text>Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC; ) is the department within the Government of Canada with responsibility for pensions, benefits and services for war veterans, retired and still-serving members of the Canadian Armed Forces and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), their families, as well as some civilians.

==History==

=== Creation ===
During World War I, it became clear that a coordinated approach was needed to deal with ill and injured soldiers. On February 21, 1918, the Department of Civil Re-establishment was created for that purpose. Subsequently, on June 11, 1928, the Government for Canada created the Department of Pensions and National Health, which took over responsibility for caring for ill and injured soldiers Following World War II, the volume of soldiers returning home made it clear that the Government of Canada would require a department dedicated entirely to serving ill and injured veterans. Consequently, in 1944 Prime Minister Mackenzie King&#x27;s government passed a motion that officially created the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Canada operated a benefits program similar to the American G.I. Bill for its World War II veterans, with a strong economic impact similar to the American case. A war veteran&#x27;s eligibility for certain benefits depended on the veteran&#x27;s &quot;overseas&quot; status, defined by Veterans Affairs as having served at least two miles offshore from Canada. In the Second World War (1939–45) Canada did not yet include Newfoundland, which became a Canadian province in 1949. Thus, World War I and World War II veterans who served in Newfoundland (with Royal Newfoundland Regiment and Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve) are considered by Veterans Affairs to be &quot;overseas veterans&quot; (and as such may be referred to the British Service Personnel and Veterans Agency).

In the late 1970s, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau undertook an initiative to decentralize government away from Ottawa. He and his Minister of Veterans Affairs, Daniel J. MacDonald (Member of Parliament for Cardigan) devised the plan to move the headquarters of the Department of Veterans Affairs from Ottawa to Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. The department&#x27;s head office has been located in the Daniel J. MacDonald Building in PEI&#x27;s capital since 1980. In the early 21st century, a second building two blocks from the DJM, the Jean Canfield Building, was constructed to house Veterans Affairs and other federal government offices. The department has become a major economic contributor to PEI, and has had an important impact on Charlottetown&#x27;s cultural landscape. Veterans Affairs Canada is the only major federal department whose headquarters is located outside of Ottawa.

=== Programs ===
The department is largely responsible for medical care, rehabilitation, commemoration, and disability pensions and awards for Veterans. Appeals from departmental decisions on disability pensions and awards are presented by Veterans to the Veterans Review and Appeal Board; mainly with the assistance of lawyers from the semi-autonomous Bureau of Pensions Advocates free of charge.

=== &quot;Veterans&#x27; Bill of Rights&quot; ===
In 2007, the &quot;Veterans&#x27; Bill of Rights&quot; was passed by the Harper government. The bill included a statement that Veterans Affairs Canada must show veterans respect.

=== 2010 Privacy Breach ===
In her October 2010 report, resulting from formal complaints made by a veteran of the 1991 Gulf War in Afghanistan, who had become a vocal critic of Veterans Affairs, federal Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart uncovered evidence of widespread privacy issues at the VAC. Her report found that the privacy former Captain Sean Bruyea, who had been medically-released from the military, had been violated by VAC when his &quot;medical and financial details had been circulated&quot; to numerous departmental officials, after he had criticized the New Veterans Charter and the way Afghanistan veterans were being treated by the government. Stoddart said that this was &quot;deeply concerning&quot; and a violation of the Privacy Act. A 2010 VFC conference call transcript revealed that a senior veterans official had responded to Bruyea&#x27;s actions by saying, &quot;It&#x27;s time to take the gloves off.&quot;

Veterans Affairs Minister Jean-Pierre Blackburn, apologized on behalf of the Government of Canada for its privacy breach and settled the suit in November 2010.

===Christopher Garnier case===
In 2018, controversy arose when it was discovered that convicted murderer, Christopher Garnier, was receiving Veterans Affairs Canada funded treatment for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Garnier had been convicted of the 2015 murder of off-duty Police Constable Catherine Campbell in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The controversy stemmed from the fact Garnier had never served in the Canadian armed forces or RCMP and the PTSD was said to be brought on by the murder for which he was convicted. Garnier was eligible for Veterans Affairs Canada benefits as his father had served in the armed forces.

==Remembrance initiatives==

The Canada Remembers program is responsible for all war commemoration activities, such as Remembrance Day, and coordinates and funds various &quot;pilgrimages&quot; for Canadian war veterans to foreign battlefields and international ceremonies (e.g. the 50th anniversary of the Liberation of the Netherlands in early 1995, the 60th anniversary of D Day on June 6, 2004).

The Government of Canada declared 2005 the Year of the Veteran. Its purpose was to teach, remember, thank, honour and celebrate. The image of a poppy overlapping a gold maple leaf became a special symbol during the campaign, on posters, pamphlets, bookmarks and documents.

On November 9, 2008, the Honourable Greg Thompson, the-then Minister of Veterans Affairs, attended a Service of Remembrance at the Canada Memorial in Green Park, London, England, which Canada had recently assumed responsibility for; the memorial pays tribute to the nearly one million Canadian men and women who served in the United Kingdom during the First and Second World Wars.

==Issues==

===New Veterans Charter===
The benefits program administered by Veterans Affairs Canada to ill and injured soldiers was rarely changed since its creation after World War I. The result was a number of out-dated policies that no longer suited the needs of Canada&#x27;s veterans. This program gave a life-time pension to an individual who was ill or injured due to military service.

In 2005, all parties in the House of Commons passed the New Veterans Charter. This Charter replaced the life-time pension award with a lump sum payment award and used life-time pension payments much more sparingly. The Charter came into force on 1 April 2006 under Prime Minister Stephen Harper&#x27;s minority government.

Under the New Veterans Charter, an ill or injured member may receive a lump sum payment of a maximum of $550,000 tax-free, ($300,000 lump sum and $250,000 disbursement insurance) as well as a maximum monthly, taxable pension of $9685.

In July 2013, Prime Minister Stephen Harper appointed Julian Fantino as the Minister of Veterans Affairs. Fantino quickly indicated that he was open to amending the New Veterans Charter to ensure veterans received the benefits and support they deserved.

In the spring of 2014, the all-party Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs met to discuss updates to the New Veterans Charter. The result was the unanimously-supported report titled &quot;The New Veterans Charter: Moving Forward,&quot; which was tabled in Parliament in June 2014. The committee made 13 recommendations to update the New Veterans Charter to close loopholes and ensure Canada&#x27;s veterans would continue to receive the support and care that they deserve. In October 2014, the government responded, saying they agreed with the &quot;spirit and intent&quot; of all 13 recommendations and would begin working on the recommendations immediately.

===Mobile Application===
Veterans Affairs Canada has recently launched a suite of mobile applications aimed at aiding Veterans with accessing services offered by VAC. These include Veterans Matter, OSI Connect, and PTSD Coach Canada.

<text>In concurrent programming, an operation (or set of operations) is linearizable if it consists of an ordered list of invocation and response events, that may be extended by adding response events such that:

# The extended list can be re-expressed as a sequential history (is serializable). 
# That sequential history is a subset of the original unextended list.

Informally, this means that the unmodified list of events is linearizable if and only if its invocations were serializable, but some of the responses of the serial schedule have yet to return.

In a concurrent system, processes can access a shared object at the same time. Because multiple processes are accessing a single object, a situation may arise in which while one process is accessing the object, another process changes its contents. Making a system linearizable is one solution to this problem. In a linearizable system, although operations overlap on a shared object, each operation appears to take place instantaneously. Linearizability is a strong correctness condition, which constrains what outputs are possible when an object is accessed by multiple processes concurrently. It is a safety property which ensures that operations do not complete unexpectedly or unpredictably. If a system is linearizable it allows a programmer to reason about the system.

== History ==
Linearizability was first introduced as a consistency model by Herlihy and Wing in 1987. It encompassed more restrictive definitions of atomic, such as &quot;an atomic operation is one which cannot be (or is not) interrupted by concurrent operations&quot;, which are usually vague about when an operation is considered to begin and end.

An atomic object can be understood immediately and completely from its sequential definition, as a set of operations run in parallel which always appear to occur one after the other; no inconsistencies may emerge. Specifically, linearizability guarantees that the invariants of a system are &quot;observed&quot; and &quot;preserved&quot; by all operations: if all operations individually preserve an invariant, the system as a whole will.

== Definition ==
A concurrent system consists of a collection of processes communicating through shared data structures or objects. Linearizability is important in these concurrent systems where objects may be accessed by multiple processes at the same time and a programmer needs to be able to reason about the expected results. An execution of a concurrent system results in a &quot;history&quot;, an ordered sequence of completed operations.

A &quot;history&quot; is a sequence of &quot;invocations&quot; and &quot;responses&quot; made of an object by a set of threads or processes. An invocation can be thought of as the start of an operation, and the response being the signaled end of that operation. Each invocation of a function will have a subsequent response. This can be used to model any use of an object. Suppose, for example, that two threads, A and B, both attempt to grab a lock, backing off if it&#x27;s already taken. This would be modeled as both threads invoking the lock operation, then both threads receiving a response, one successful, one not.

A &quot;sequential&quot; history is one in which all invocations have immediate responses; that is the invocation and response are considered to take place instantaneously. A sequential history should be trivial to reason about, as it has no real concurrency; the previous example was not sequential, and thus is hard to reason about. This is where linearizability comes in.

A history is &quot;linearizable&quot; if there is a linear order formula_1 of the completed operations such that:
# For every completed operation in formula_1, the operation returns the same result in the execution as the operation would return if every operation was completed one by one in order formula_1.
# If an operation op1 completes (gets a response) before op2 begins (invokes), then op1 precedes op2 in formula_1.
In other words:
* its invocations and responses can be reordered to yield a sequential history;
* that sequential history is correct according to the sequential definition of the object;
* if a response preceded an invocation in the original history, it must still precede it in the sequential reordering.

Note that the first two bullet points here match serializability: the operations appear to happen in some order. It is the last point which is unique to linearizability, and is thus the major contribution of Herlihy and Wing.

Consider two ways of reordering the locking example above.

Reordering B&#x27;s invocation after A&#x27;s response yields a sequential history. This is easy to reason about, as all operations now happen in an obvious order. However, it does not match the sequential definition of the object (it doesn&#x27;t match the semantics of the program): A should have successfully obtained the lock, and B should have subsequently aborted.

This is another correct sequential history. It is also a linearization since it matches the sequential definition. Note that the definition of linearizability only precludes responses that precede invocations from being reordered; since the original history had no responses before invocations, they can be reordered. Hence the original history is indeed linearizable.

An object (as opposed to a history) is linearizable if all valid histories of its use can be linearized. This is a much harder assertion to prove.

=== Linearizability versus serializability ===
Consider the following history, again of two objects interacting with a lock:

This history is not valid because there is a point at which both A and B hold the lock; moreover, it cannot be reordered to a valid sequential history without violating the ordering rule. Therefore, it is not linearizable. However, under serializability, B&#x27;s unlock operation may be moved to &quot;before&quot; A&#x27;s original lock, which is a valid history (assuming the object begins the history in a locked state):

This reordering is sensible provided there is no alternative means of communicating between A and B. Linearizability is better when considering individual objects separately, as the reordering restrictions ensure that multiple linearizable objects are, considered as a whole, still linearizable.

=== Linearization points ===
This definition of linearizability is equivalent to the following:
* All function calls have a &quot;linearization point&quot; at some instant between their invocation and their response.
* All functions appear to occur instantly at their linearization point, behaving as specified by the sequential definition.

This alternative is usually much easier to prove. It is also much easier to reason about as a user, largely due to its intuitiveness. This property of occurring instantaneously, or indivisibly, leads to the use of the term &quot;atomic&quot; as an alternative to the longer &quot;linearizable&quot;.

In the examples below, the linearization point of the counter built on compare-and-swap is the linearization point of the first (and only) successful compare-and-swap update. The counter built using locking can be considered to linearize at any moment while the locks are held, since any potentially conflicting operations are excluded from running during that period.

== Primitive atomic instructions ==
Processors have instructions that can be used to implement locking and lock-free and wait-free algorithms. The ability to temporarily inhibit interrupts, ensuring that the currently running process cannot be context switched, also suffices on a uniprocessor. These instructions are used directly by compiler and operating system writers but are also abstracted and exposed as bytecodes and library functions in higher-level languages:
* atomic read-write;
* atomic swap (the RDLK instruction in some Burroughs mainframes, and the XCHG x86 instruction);
* test-and-set;
* fetch-and-add;
* compare-and-swap;
* load-link/store-conditional.

Most processors include store operations that are not atomic with respect to memory. These include multiple-word stores and string operations. Should a high priority interrupt occur when a portion of the store is complete, the operation must be completed when the interrupt level is returned. The routine that processes the interrupt must not modify the memory being changed. It is important to take this into account when writing interrupt routines.

When there are multiple instructions which must be completed without interruption, a CPU instruction which temporarily disables interrupts is used. This must be kept to only a few instructions and the interrupts must be re-enabled to avoid unacceptable response time to interrupts or even losing interrupts. This mechanism is not sufficient in a multi-processor environment since each CPU can interfere with the process regardless of whether interrupts occur or not. Further, in the presence of an instruction pipeline, uninterruptible operations present a security risk, as they can potentially be chained in an infinite loop to create a denial of service attack, as in the Cyrix coma bug.

The C standard and SUSv3 provide codice_1 for simple atomic reads and writes; incrementing or decrementing is not guaranteed to be atomic. More complex atomic operations are available in C11, which provides codice_2. Compilers use the hardware features or more complex methods to implement the operations; an example is libatomic of GCC.

The ARM instruction set provides codice_3 and codice_4 instructions which can be used to implement atomic memory access by using exclusive monitors implemented in the processor to track memory accesses for a specific address. However, if a context switch occurs between calls to codice_3 and codice_4, the documentation notes that codice_4 will fail, indicating the operation should be retried. In the case of 64-bit ARMv8-A architecture, it provides codice_8 and codice_9 instructions for byte, half-word, word, and double-word size.

== High-level atomic operations ==
The easiest way to achieve linearizability is running groups of primitive operations in a critical section. Strictly, independent operations can then be carefully permitted to overlap their critical sections, provided this does not violate linearizability. Such an approach must balance the cost of large numbers of locks against the benefits of increased parallelism.

Another approach, favoured by researchers (but not yet widely used in the software industry), is to design a linearizable object using the native atomic primitives provided by the hardware. This has the potential to maximise available parallelism and minimise synchronisation costs, but requires mathematical proofs which show that the objects behave correctly.

A promising hybrid of these two is to provide a transactional memory abstraction. As with critical sections, the user marks sequential code that must be run in isolation from other threads. The implementation then ensures the code executes atomically. This style of abstraction is common when interacting with databases; for instance, when using the Spring Framework, annotating a method with @Transactional will ensure all enclosed database interactions occur in a single database transaction. Transactional memory goes a step further, ensuring that all memory interactions occur atomically. As with database transactions, issues arise regarding composition of transactions, especially database and in-memory transactions.

A common theme when designing linearizable objects is to provide an all-or-nothing interface: either an operation succeeds completely, or it fails and does nothing. (ACID databases refer to this principle as atomicity.) If the operation fails (usually due to concurrent operations), the user must retry, usually performing a different operation. For example:
* Compare-and-swap writes a new value into a location only if the latter&#x27;s contents matches a supplied old value. This is commonly used in a read-modify-CAS sequence: the user reads the location, computes a new value to write, and writes it with a CAS (compare-and-swap); if the value changes concurrently, the CAS will fail and the user tries again.
* Load-link/store-conditional encodes this pattern more directly: the user reads the location with load-link, computes a new value to write, and writes it with store-conditional; if the value has changed concurrently, the SC (store-conditional) will fail and the user tries again.
* In a database transaction, if the transaction cannot be completed due to a concurrent operation (e.g. in a deadlock), the transaction will be aborted and the user must try again.

== Examples ==

=== Counters ===
To demonstrate the power and necessity of linearizability we will consider a simple counter which different processes can increment.

We would like to implement a counter object which multiple processes can access. Many common systems make use of counters to keep track of the number of times an event has occurred.

The counter object can be accessed by multiple processes and has two available operations.
# Increment - adds 1 to the value stored in the counter, return acknowledgement
# Read - returns the current value stored in the counter without changing it.
We will attempt to implement this counter object using shared registers.

Our first attempt which we will see is non-linearizable has the following implementation using one shared register among the processes.

==== Non-atomic ====
The naive, non-atomic implementation:

Increment:
# Read the value in the register R
# Add one to the value
# Writes the new value back into register R
Read:

Read register R

This simple implementation is not linearizable, as is demonstrated by the following example.

Imagine two processes are running accessing the single counter object initialized to have value 0:
# The first process reads the value in the register as 0.
# The first process adds one to the value, the counter&#x27;s value should be 1, but before it has finished writing the new value back to the register it may become suspended, meanwhile the second process is running:
# The second process reads the value in the register, which is still equal to 0;
# The second process adds one to the value;
# The second process writes the new value into the register, the register now has value 1.
The second process is finished running and the first process continues running from where it left off:
# The first process writes 1 into the register, unaware that the other process has already updated the value in the register to 1.
In the above example, two processes invoked an increment command, however the value of the object only increased from 0 to 1, instead of 2 as it should have. One of the increment operations was lost as a result of the system not being linearizable.

The above example shows the need for carefully thinking through implementations of data structures and how linearizability can have an effect on the correctness of the system.

==== Atomic ====
To implement a linearizable or atomic counter object we will modify our previous implementation so each process P will use its own register R

Each process increments and reads according to the following algorithm:

Increment:
# Read value in register R.
# Add one to the value.
# Write new value back into R
Read:
# Read registers R R R.
# Return the sum of all registers.
This implementation solves the problem with our original implementation. In this system the increment operations are linearized at the write step. The linearization point of an increment operation is when that operation writes the new value in its register R The read operations are linearized to a point in the system when the value returned by the read is equal to the sum of all the values stored in each register R

This is a trivial example. In a real system, the operations can be more complex and the errors introduced extremely subtle. For example, reading a 64-bit value from memory may actually be implemented as two sequential reads of two 32-bit memory locations. If a process has only read the first 32 bits, and before it reads the second 32 bits the value in memory gets changed, it will have neither the original value nor the new value but a mixed-up value.

Furthermore, the specific order in which the processes run can change the results, making such an error difficult to detect, reproduce and debug.

=== Compare-and-swap ===

Most systems provide an atomic compare-and-swap instruction that reads from a memory location, compares the value with an &quot;expected&quot; one provided by the user, and writes out a &quot;new&quot; value if the two match, returning whether the update succeeded. We can use this to fix the non-atomic counter algorithm as follows:

:# Read the value in the memory location;
:# add one to the value;
:# use compare-and-swap to write the incremented value back;
:# retry if the value read in by the compare-and-swap did not match the value we originally read.

Since the compare-and-swap occurs (or appears to occur) instantaneously, if another process updates the location while we are in-progress, the compare-and-swap is guaranteed to fail.

=== Fetch-and-increment ===

Many systems provide an atomic fetch-and-increment instruction that reads from a memory location, unconditionally writes a new value (the old value plus one), and returns the old value.
We can use this to fix the non-atomic counter algorithm as follows:

:# Use fetch-and-increment to read the old value and write the incremented value back.

Using fetch-and increment is always better (requires fewer memory references) for some algorithms—such as the one shown here—than compare-and-swap, even though Herlihy earlier proved that compare-and-swap is better for certain other algorithms that can&#x27;t be implemented at all using only fetch-and-increment.
So CPU designs with both fetch-and-increment and compare-and-swap (or equivalent instructions) may be a better choice than ones with only one or the other.

=== Locking ===

Another approach is to turn the naive algorithm into a critical section, preventing other threads from disrupting it, using a lock. Once again fixing the non-atomic counter algorithm:

:# Acquire a lock, excluding other threads from running the critical section (steps 2–4) at the same time;
:# read the value in the memory location;
:# add one to the value;
:# write the incremented value back to the memory location;
:# release the lock.

This strategy works as expected; the lock prevents other threads from updating the value until it is released. However, when compared with direct use of atomic operations, it can suffer from significant overhead due to lock contention. To improve program performance, it may therefore be a good idea to replace simple critical sections with atomic operations for non-blocking synchronization (as we have just done for the counter with compare-and-swap and fetch-and-increment), instead of the other way around, but unfortunately a significant improvement is not guaranteed and lock-free algorithms can easily become too complicated to be worth the effort.

<text>An autopen (or signing machine) is a device used for the automatic signing of a signature. Prominent individuals may be asked to provide their signatures many times a day, such as celebrities receiving requests for autographs, or politicians signing documents and correspondence in their official capacities. Consequently, many public figures employ autopens to allow their signature to be printed on demand and without their direct involvement. 

Though manual precursors of the modern autopen have existed since at least 1803, 21st-century autopens are machines that are programmed with a signature, which is then reproduced by a motorized, mechanical arm holding a pen.

Given the exact verisimilitude to the real hand signature, the use of the autopen allows for a small degree of wishful thinking and plausible deniability as to whether a famous autograph is real or reproduced, thus increasing the perception of the personal value of the signature by the lay recipient. However, known or suspected autopen signatures are also vastly less valuable as philographic collectibles; legitimate hand-signed documents from individuals known to also use an autopen usually require verification and provenance to be considered valid.

Early autopens used a plastic matrix of the original signature which is a channel cut into an engraved plate in the shape of a wheel. A stylus driven by an electric motor followed the x- and y-axis of a profile or shape engraved in the plate (which is why it is called a matrix). The stylus is mechanically connected to an arm which can hold almost any common writing instrument, so the favourite pen and ink can be used to suggest authenticity. The autopen signature is made with even pressure (and indentation in the paper), which is how these machines are distinguishable from original handwriting where the pressure varies.

==History==
The first signature duplicating machines were developed by Englishman John Isaac Hawkins. Hawkins received a United States patent for his device in 1803, called a polygraph (an abstracted version of the pantograph), in which the user may write with one pen and have their writing simultaneously reproduced by an attached second pen. Thomas Jefferson used the device extensively during his presidency. This device bears little resemblance to today&#x27;s autopens in design or operation. The autopen called the Robot Pen was developed in the 1930s, and became commercially available in 1937 (used as a storage unit device, similar in principle to how vinyl records store information) to record a signer&#x27;s signature. A small segment of the record could be removed and stored elsewhere to prevent misuse. The machine would then be able to mass-produce a template signature when needed.

While the Robot Pen was commercially available, the first commercially successful autopen was developed by Robert M. De Shazo Jr., in 1942. De Shazo developed the technology that became the modern autopen in reference to a Request For Quote (RFQ) from the Navy, and in 1942, received an order for the machine from the Secretary of the Navy. This was the beginning of a significant market in government for the autopen, as the machines soon ended up in the offices of members of Congress, the Senate and the Executive branches. At one point, De Shazo estimated there were more than 500 autopens in use in Washington, D.C.

==Use==
Individuals who use autopens often do not disclose this publicly. Signatures generated by machines are valued less than those created manually, and perceived by their recipients as somewhat inauthentic. In 2004, Donald Rumsfeld, then the U.S. Secretary of Defense, incurred criticism after it was discovered that his office used an autopen to sign letters of condolence to families of American soldiers who were killed in war. 

Outside of politics, it was reported in November 2022 that some copies of &quot;The Philosophy of Modern Song&quot;, a book by singer-songwriter Bob Dylan that had been published earlier that month, had been signed with an autopen, resulting in criticism. Autographed editions had been marketed as &quot;hand-signed&quot; and priced at US$600 each. Both Dylan and the book&#x27;s publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster, issued apologies; refunds were also offered to customers who had bought autopen-signed editions. In addition, Dylan also said that some prints of his artwork sold after 2019 had been signed with an autopen, which he further apologized for and attributed his use of the machine to vertigo and the COVID-19 pandemic, the latter of which prevented him from meeting with staff to facilitate signing the works in question.

===U.S. Presidents===

It has long been known that the president of the United States uses multiple autopen systems to sign many official documents (e.g., military, diplomatic, and judicial commissions; some Acts of Congress, executive directives, letters and other correspondence), due to the volume of such documents requiring their signature per the U.S. Constitution. Some say Harry Truman was the first president to use the autopen as a way of responding to mail and signing checks. Others credit Gerald Ford as the first president to openly acknowledge his use of the autopen, but Lyndon Johnson allowed photographs of his autopen to be taken while he was in office, and in 1968 the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; ran them along with the front-page headline &quot;The Robot That Sits In For The President.&quot;

While visiting France, Barack Obama authorized the use of an autopen to create his signature which signed into law an extension of three provisions of the Patriot Act. On January 3, 2013, he signed the extension to the Bush tax cuts, using the autopen while vacationing in Hawaii. In order to sign it by the required deadline, his other alternative would have been to have had the bill flown to him overnight. Republican leaders questioned whether this use of the autopen met the constitutional requirement for signing a bill into law, but the validity of presidential use of an autopen had not been actually tested in court. In 2005, George W. Bush asked for and received a favorable opinion from the Department of Justice regarding the constitutionality of using the autopen, but did not use it himself.

In May 2024, Joe Biden directed an autopen be used to sign legislation providing a one-week funding extension for the Federal Aviation Administration. Biden was traveling in San Francisco at the time, and wished to avoid any lapse in FAA operations, while a five-year funding bill was being voted on by Congress.

==Similar devices==
Further developing the class of devices known as autopens, Canadian author Margaret Atwood created a device called the LongPen, which allows audio and video conversation between the fan and author while a book is being signed remotely.

<text>Ulf Michael Widenius (born 3 March 1962), also known as Monty, is a Finnish software programmer. He is the main author of the original version of the open source MySQL database, a founding member of the MySQL AB company, founding member of the MariaDB Foundation and CTO of the MariaDB Company. Additionally, he is a founder and general partner at venture capital firm OpenOcean.

== Biography ==
===Early years===
Born in Helsinki, Finland, Widenius went to the co-educational school Broban, which was first merged into Minervaskolan and later to Lönnbeckska gymnasiet. After dropping out of Helsinki University of Technology, Widenius started working for Tapio Laakso Oy in 1981. In 1985 he founded TCX DataKonsult AB (a Swedish data warehousing company) with Allan Larsson. In 1995 he began writing the first version of the MySQL database with David Axmark, released in 1996. He is the co-author of the &quot;MySQL Reference Manual&quot;, published by O&#x27;Reilly in June 2002; and in 2003 he was awarded the Finnish Software Entrepreneur of the Year prize.

Until MySQL AB&#x27;s sale to Sun Microsystems in 2008, he was the chief technical officer of MySQL AB. After the acquisition, he remained one of the primary forces behind the ongoing development of MySQL.

===MySQL acquired by Sun===
Widenius sold MySQL to Sun in January 2008, earning about €16.6 million in capital gains in 2008 (€16.8 million total income), making him one of the top 10 highest earners in Finland that year.

===After Sun===
In 2008, Widenius established venture capital firm OpenOcean with his MySQL AB colleague Patrik Backman and early advisors Tom Henriksson and Ralf Wahlsten.

On 5 February 2009, he announced that he was leaving Sun in order to create his own company.

On 12 December 2009, Widenius asked MySQL customers to lobby the European Commission (EC), regarding Oracle&#x27;s acquisition of Sun, citing concerns about potential Oracle control of MySQL; this resulted in an online petition campaign called &quot;Save MySQL&quot;.

After leaving Sun, he formed Monty Program Ab and forked MySQL into MariaDB, named after his youngest daughter, Maria. It includes several patches and plugins developed by the company itself or the community. One of these plugins is the Aria storage engine, which was renamed from Maria to avoid confusion with MariaDB. Monty Program Ab merged with SkySQL, who later renamed themselves MariaDB Corporation. In 2012, he was a founding member of the MariaDB Foundation, a non-profit organisation charged with promoting, protecting and advancing the MariaDB codebase, community, and ecosystem.

The Open Database Alliance, also known as ODBA, was founded in 2009 by the Monty Program and Percona. According to its first announcement, &quot;the Open Database Alliance will comprise a collection of companies working together to provide the software, support and services for MariaDB, an enterprise-grade, community-developed branch of MySQL&quot;.

==Personal life==
Widenius lives in Kauniainen, Finland with his second wife Anna and his youngest daughter, Maria. Widenius has three children – My, Max, and Maria – who inspired the names for MySQL, MaxDB and the MySQL-Max distribution, and MariaDB.

<text>Paul Motwani (born 13 June 1962) is a Scottish chess grandmaster. He was the first Scottish player to become a grandmaster.

==Chess career==
Born in Glasgow and raised in Dundee, he became World Cadet (Under 17) Champion in 1978, and won the first of his seven Scottish Championship titles that year. He was a secondary school mathematics teacher at St Saviour&#x27;s RC High School in Dundee for a number of years after studying mathematics and physics at the University of Dundee. In 1990, he took time out to pursue his final Grandmaster norm.

Motwani has been a regular member of the Scottish Olympiad, never having had a performance rating below 2500. He made his first two Grandmaster norms at the 1986 and 1988 Olympiads, then faced a race against time to achieve his third before the first one expired in 1991. (Although norms now last a lifetime, the FIDE rule in place at the time saw them expiring after five years.) He just failed to reach the required number of points in a hastily organised tournament in Dundee days before the deadline. Ironically, FIDE changed the rules shortly after this, and reset the expiry time for norms at six years. He duly achieved his final norm in 1992, and starred in a Grampian Television documentary called &quot;The Grandmasters of Dundee&quot; along with Colin McNab, who had also achieved the title by then.

Motwani is a regular contributor to &quot;Scottish Chess&quot; (the magazine of Chess Scotland), &quot;The Scotsman&quot; (for whom he writes a weekly column) and has written for many other chess publications. He has written five chess books - &quot;H.O.T. Chess&quot;, &quot;C.O.O.L. Chess&quot;, &quot;S.T.A.R. Chess&quot;, &quot;Chess Under the Microscope&quot; and &quot;The Most Instructive Games of the Young Grandmasters&quot;. His writings are known for his use of acronyms to remember key concepts and some of the non-chess &#x27;general puzzle&#x27; content (including &#x27;Mr Fab&#x27; the alien).

==Personal life==
Motwani is of Scottish and Indian descent. He currently lives in Belgium with his wife Jenny and son Michael. He teaches third grade and organizes an elementary school chess club at St. John&#x27;s International School in Waterloo, Belgium and teaches mathematics in the Musica Mundi School in Waterloo, Belgium.
His favorite number is the prime 3.

<text>Sean Patrick Reiley (born June 15, 1976), better known as Seanbaby, is an American writer and video-game designer best known for his comedy website and frequent contributions to video game media outlets &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; and 1UP.com, as well as the humor website Cracked.com.

==Writing career==
Seanbaby&#x27;s original website houses many reviews of old video games, a substantial section on the old &quot;Super-Friends&quot; cartoon, critiques on old DC comics, a collection of Hostess Pie ads (with commentary), sarcastic commentary on Christian fundamentalists and hipsters, examples of poorly translated English, reviews of bad movies and comics, ineffective or overblown self-defense techniques, current events, and a photo gallery of himself with friends.

Seanbaby was a frequent writer for &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;. In addition to his reviews and other content, he wrote a monthly column concerning bad games entitled &quot;Rest of The Crap.&quot; He was a frequent contributor on the popular gaming website 1UP.com, where his &quot;EGM&quot; work was posted. He provides commentary on bad games for 1UP&#x27;s Broken Pixels show. He also writes a column called &quot;The Final Last Word&quot; for &quot;The Wave&quot; magazine of Silicon Valley.

He was also a writer for the short-lived MTV2 animated comedy show &quot;The Adventures of Chico and Guapo&quot;. He has returned to regularly updating seanbaby.com and began writing as a columnist for Cracked.com. Apart from the typical &quot;listicles&quot; of Cracked.com, Seanbaby&#x27;s articles also include parodical comics, usually golden-age comicbooks with altered dialogue, and the running gag of 1930&#x27;s ice-cream mascot &quot;Popsicle Pete&quot; being characterized as a supernatural monster. In 2020, he and fellow Cracked veteran Robert Brockway began publishing comedy articles on the Patreon-supported 1-900-HOTDOG where they also produce a weekly podcast, &quot;the Dogg Zzone 9000&quot;. Seanbaby and Brockway and Jason Pargin also created the &#x27;Bigfeets&#x27; podcast, recapping the television show &quot;Mountain Monsters&quot;.

==Calculords==

Seanbaby is the creator of the mobile game &quot;Calculords&quot;, which combines elements of lane attack, collectible card games, and math puzzles. According to Sean, &quot;Calculords is a weird idea that I’d never get to see unless I made it&quot;.

A sequel, &quot;Calculords 2: Rise of the Shadow Nerd&quot;, has been announced.

<doc id="1204329" wikidata="Q966002" url="?curid=1204329" title="Coaching inn">
<text>The coaching inn (also coaching house or staging inn) was a vital part of Europe&#x27;s inland transport infrastructure until the development of the railway, providing a resting point (layover) for people and horses. The inn served the needs of travellers, for food, drink, and rest. The attached stables, staffed by hostlers, cared for the horses, including changing a tired team for a fresh one. Coaching inns were used by private travellers in their coaches, the public riding stagecoaches between one town and another, and (in England at least) the mail coach. Just as with roadhouses in other countries, although many survive, and some still offer overnight accommodation, in general coaching inns have lost their original function and now operate as ordinary pubs.

Coaching inns stabled teams of horses for stagecoaches and mail coaches and replaced tired teams with fresh teams. In America, stage stations performed these functions. Traditionally English coaching inns were seven miles (11 km) apart but this depended very much on the terrain. Some English towns had as many as ten such inns and rivalry between them was intense, not only for the income from the stagecoach operators but for the revenue for food and drink supplied to the passengers. Barnet, Hertfordshire still has an unusually high number of historic pubs along its high street due to its former position on the Great North Road from London to Scotland.

==Historic coaching inns==
The Black Lion in Cardigan (established 1105) is probably the oldest Welsh coaching inn. Other historic inns in Wales include the Black Boy Inn (built 1522) and the Groes Inn (1573).

The Bear, Oxford, was founded in 1774 as &#x27;The Jolly Trooper&#x27; from the house of the stableman to the coaching inn &#x27;The Bear Inn&#x27;, on High Street. It acquired the name The Bear, and the history of the coaching inn, when The Bear Inn was converted into a private house in 1801.

There were many coaching inns in what is now central London. The only remaining one with the galleries to the bedrooms above is The George Inn, Southwark, owned by the National Trust and still run as a pub. Many have been demolished and plaques mark their location. The Nomura building close to the Museum of London on London Wall commemorates the &quot;Bull and Mouth&quot; Inn. The Golden Cross House, opposite St Martin&#x27;s in the Fields recalls the Golden Cross, Charing Cross coaching inn.

Other coaching inns lost their customers when the railway replaced the mail coach routes, and were closed down. Chockerup Inn in Western Australia is one example: it was abandoned when the Great Southern Railway opened in 1889, replacing the coach route between Albany and Perth.

==Cock and Bull==

A pair of coaching inns along Watling Street in Stony Stratford are claimed to have given rise to the term &quot;&quot;. The claim is that stories by coach passengers would be further embellished as they passed between the two hostelries, &quot;The Cock&quot; and &quot;The Bull&quot;, fuelled by ale and an interested audience. Hence any suspiciously elaborate tale would become a cock and bull story. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this is where the phrase originated. The phrase, first recorded in 1621, may instead be an allusion to Aesop&#x27;s fables, with their incredible talking animals.

<text>Robert Allan Humphreys (1930–1988), known as Laud Humphreys, was an American sociologist and Episcopal priest. He is noted for his research into sexual encounters between men in public bathrooms, published as &quot;Tearoom Trade&quot; (1970) and for the questions that emerged from what was overwhelmingly considered unethical research methods. He influenced generations of scholars who research issues related to sexuality and sexual identity.

==Biography==
Robert Allan Humphreys was born on October 16, 1930, in Chickasha, Oklahoma, to Ira Denver Humphreys and Stella Bernice Humphreys. &quot;Laud&quot; was chosen as his first name when he was baptized again upon entering the Episcopal Church.

=== Education ===
Humphreys graduated from Chickasha High School (Chickasha, Oklahoma) in 1948. He then attended Colorado College, graduating with his BA in 1952. He attended Seabury-Western Theological Seminary (in Evanston, Illinois), graduating with the MDiv degree in 1955. In 1965, he entered graduate school at Washington University to pursue a PhD in sociology. His dissertation adviser was Lee Rainwater. Humphreys obtained two pre-doctoral research fellowships from the National Institute of Mental Health to fund his dissertation research. He completed his dissertation in 1968, graduated with his PhD in that year. He published the dissertation as &quot;Tearoom Trade: Impersonal Sex in Public Places&quot; in 1970. His book won the C. Wright Mills Award from the Society for the Study of Social Problems in 1969. Due to the controversy around his research methods and the topic of his research, there was a failed attempt by the chancellor of Washington University to rescind his PhD.

=== Personal life and career ===
After graduating with his PhD from Washington University, Humphreys was an assistant professor of sociology at Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville, Illinois, from 1968 to 1970. He was associate professor of sociology at the School of Criminal Justice, State University of New York in Albany 1970–1972. He was associate professor of sociology at Pitzer College, in Claremont, California, from 1972 to 1975; he earned full professorship at Pitzer in 1975, where he worked until about 1980, when he began to focus on his psychotherapist practice.

Humphreys belonged to several sociological professional organizations, including the American Sociological Association (ASA), the Society for the Study of Social Problems, the Pacific Sociological Association, and the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences. He was a charter member of the International Academy of Sex Research. During his academic career, he served on a number of editorial boards and served as chair of multiple professional society committees. He was an invited speaker at more than a dozen symposia and other events, and was a guest on four TV shows.

Humphreys married Nancy Wallace, a woman from a prominent Tulsa family in 1960. The couple had two children, Claire and David. In 1974, Humphreys came out as a gay man during a discussion at a conference session at the ASA. Humphreys was a co-founder of the Sociologists&#x27; Gay Caucus, (now the Committee on the Status of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer People in Sociology), established in 1974 as a response to a presentation by Edward Sagarin that criticized homosexual sociologists as hiding in the closet.

Humphreys separated from his wife in 1980 and began living with Brian Miller, a graduate student at the University of Alberta. That same year, he was certified to practice as a psychotherapist in California. For most of the rest of his life, he was in private practice, although he and Miller co-authored articles about gay subcultures and victims of violent homophobia.

He was professor of sociology at Pitzer College in Claremont, California, from 1972 to 1988 and died of lung cancer on August 23, 1988, aged 57.

=== Biography and papers ===
His biography, written by John F. Galliher, Wayne H. Brekhus, and David P. Keys, was published in 2004, under the title &quot;Laud Humphreys: Prophet of Homosexuality and Sociology&quot;. The authors establish the case that Humphreys was an extremely complex person and that he was professionally marginalized in the discipline of sociology. The book also heralds his contributions to the discipline of sociology, as well as his advocacy for African-American civil rights, gay rights, and against war.

The University of Southern California houses the Laud Humphreys Papers Collection, as part of the ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives.

==&quot;Tearoom Trade&quot;==

Humphreys is best known for his published PhD dissertation, &quot;Tearoom Trade: Impersonal Sex in Public Places&quot; (1970), an ethnographic study of anonymous male-male sexual encounters in public toilets (a practice known as &quot;tea-rooming&quot; in US gay slang and &quot;cottaging&quot; in British English). Humphreys asserted that the men participating in such activity came from diverse social backgrounds, had differing personal motives for seeking sexual partners in such venues, and variously self-perceived as &quot;straight,&quot; &quot;bisexual,&quot; or &quot;gay.&quot; Because Humphreys was able to confirm that over 50% of his subjects identified as heterosexual men who were married to women, a primary thesis of &quot;Tearoom Trade&quot; is the incongruence between the private self and the social self for many of the men engaging in this form of homosexual activity. Specifically, they put on a &quot;breastplate of righteousness&quot; (social and political conservatism) in an effort to conceal their sexual behavior and prevent being exposed as deviants. Humphreys tapped into a theme of incongruence between one&#x27;s words and deeds that has become a primary methodological and theoretical concern in sociology throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.

Humphreys&#x27; study has been criticized by sociologists and other social and behavioral scientists on ethical grounds in that he observed sexual acts by masquerading as a voyeur, &quot;did not get his subjects’ consent, tracked down names and addresses through license plate numbers, and interviewed the men in their homes in disguise and under false pretenses.&quot;

According to Jack Nusan Porter, a sociologist who knew Humphreys and studied under Howard S. Becker at Northwestern University from 1967 to 1971, &quot;Humphreys was enormously influential on graduate students and younger scholars in the field of deviance, ethnography, and what we called &#x27;participant observation&#x27;. True, today one could not do such research because there was no &#x27;informed consent&#x27; but then again, in many cases, when doing research on deviant behavior, one will never get &#x27;informed consent&#x27; so we miss out on a lot of important findings. He was a true pioneer and a hero to all of us in these fields.&quot;

Humphreys&#x27; research materials, including detailed diagrams and maps of tearoom activity he observed, are housed in the collections at ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives.

By 2004, &quot;Tearoom Trade&quot; had sold more than 300,000 copies. Steven P. Schacht notes that this fact &quot;makes it one of the best selling books ever written by a sociologist.&quot; The book was also published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. in British English, and in German by Ferdinand Enke Vertag. Both of these versions were published in 1974.

== Humphreys&#x27; influence ==
Humphreys influenced generations of sociologists and other social and behavioral scientists in complex ways. He is often studied in research methods classes for the ethical questions that his works raised. However, Earl Babbie, who writes about sociological research methods, notes that the controversy about &quot;sociological snoopers&quot; and research ethics was likely the result of societal homophobia and disgust with the research topic, and not due to real problems with research methods.

Schacht credits Humphreys with pioneering research on impersonal sex, now a common topic of research and advocacy in the context of HIV/AIDS. Tewksbury writes about the multiple studies that were inspired by Humphrey&#x27;s work, calling his work a rich legacy for future sex researchers. According to Brekhus, Humphrey&#x27;s contribution to sociological theory, in particular to the development of the concept of identity politics, is often overlooked, but should be hailed as an important forerunner to modern queer theory. Nardi also lauds Humphreys&#x27; theoretical work, especially his concept of the breastplate of righteousness. Humphreys developed this idea to explain the apparent contradiction of presumably straight, married men holding a public conservative stance against homosexuality, yet engaging in impersonal sex with men in public settings.

In 2003, the presidential session at the Society for the Study of Social Problems (SSSP) was devoted to honoring Humphrey&#x27;s pioneering work on sexuality. In 2004, a special issue of &quot;The International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy&quot; was published that was edited by Steven P. Schacht, who participated in the SSSP session. The special issue contained ten articles analyzing his research and his multiple contributions as a social activist and scholar. The authors of these articles call for sociologists and others to move beyond criticism of Humphrey&#x27;s research methodologies in the tearoom study, and instead to focus on his pioneering contributions to the study of sexuality, participant-observation as method, development of sociological theory, and his work as a social activist and advocate for marginalized sexual identities.

<text>Juan Lembeye (1816 in Ferrol – 1889 in Culleredo) was a Spanish naturalist.

Lembeye was the author of &quot;Aves de la Isla de Cuba&quot; (1850), the only book of bird illustrations to be published in Cuba. Born in Galicia, Lembeye lived in Cuba from the 1830s to the 1860s, and became interested in birds while he was there. The majority of the 38 drawings in Lembeye&#x27;s book were copied from the royal octavo plates of John James Audubon; in some cases, he even copied the plants depicted in the background. Bee hummingbird was described in his book first time, &quot;Mellisuga helenae&quot; Gundlach

Lembeye discovered Cuban solitaire (&quot;Myadestes elisabeth&quot;) and yellow-headed warbler (&quot;Teretistris fernandinae&quot;), and is commemorated in the specific name of Cuban gnatcatcher, &quot;Polioptila lembeyei&quot;.

<text>Otto Albert Blehr (17 February 1847 – 13 July 1927) was a Norwegian statesman, attorney and newspaper editor who was the prime minister of Norway from 1902 to 1903 during the Union between Sweden and Norway and from 1921 to 1923 following the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden. He represented the Liberal Party.

==Biography==
Blehr grew up at a farm at Stange in Hedmark, Norway. His parents were Albert Blehr (1805–1872) and Maren Wilhelmine Ludovica Kathinka Stenersen (1818–1877).
His father was a doctor and physicist at Sanderud Hospital.

He graduated in 1865 and then began studying the University of Christiania. Blehr graduated cand.jur. in 1871. He served as parliamentary reporter for the newspapers &quot;Dagbladet&quot; and &quot;Bergens Tidende&quot;. In 1874, he was one of the founders of the &quot;Fjordabladet&quot; where he served as the first editor-in-chief until 1882. In 1878, he also started and served as the first editor of the &quot;Sogns Tidende&quot;. Blehr was the governor of Nordre Bergenhus (1883–1888) and for Nordland (1895–1900).

In 1877, he established himself as a prosecutor at Lærdal in Sogn. In 1879 Blehr was elected as first deputy representative to the Storting for Nordre Bergenhus amt (now Sogn og Fjordane) and from 1883 to 1888 he was a permanent representative. In the fall of 1888 he was not re-elected to the Storting. 
He became a prosecutor () in Sunnfjord and Nordfjord. In 1889 a lawyer in Hålogaland. He held this assignment until he became a judge () at Kristiania in 1893. In 1894 Blehr was again elected to the Storting, now for Nordland. Blehr was re-elected as parliamentary deputy for Nordland in 1898. On 21 April 1902, he took over as Prime Minister of the Norwegian government in Kristiania.

In October 1903, Blehr resigned as a result of an election defeat. In 1905 he was appointed as County Governor () at Christiania (now Oslo), an office he held until 1921. On 21 June 1921, Otto Blehr became prime minister and at the same time also chief of the Ministry of Finance. He was also a member of the Norwegian delegation to the League of Nations 1920 and 1922–1925. On 3 March 1923 the government resigned.

==Personal life==
He married women&#x27;s rights activist Randi Blehr (1851–1928) in 1876. Both were co-founders of the Norwegian Association for Women&#x27;s Rights, where his wife later became president. Otto Blehr was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav in 1898. He was also the auditor of the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 1903 to his death in Oslo during 1927. He was the father of Eivind Blehr, a minister in the Quisling regime in World War II.

<text>Bertrand Hollis Snell (December 9, 1870 – February 2, 1958) was an American politician who represented upstate New York in the United States House of Representatives.

== U.S. Congressman ==
Elected in 1915 to the House of Representatives from upstate New York&#x27;s Thirty-first district, Snell, a Republican, served in Congress until he retired in 1939. He was intensely loyal to the regular Republican leaders, only deviating from this fidelity when constituent interests were at stake. Early in his congressional service he offered a bill to make the St. Lawrence River more navigable, which he pursued unsuccessfully for the rest of his days in Congress. When the Saint Lawrence Seaway finally came to fruition during the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration, one of its locks was named after Snell. According to his biographer, Louis A. Barone, Snell, throughout his congressional career, generally opposed federal regulatory interference in the private sector and big spending programs.

== House Committee Chairman ==
In 1923 Snell became chairman of the important House Rules Committee. This position gave him great power in Congress and the Republican party, because he was in a position to frame legislation and legislative strategy. When Nicholas Longworth ascended to the Speakership and John Q. Tilson became majority floor leader in 1925, they, along with Snell, effectively controlled in concert the House of Representatives. Snell&#x27;s first job as chairman of the Rules Committee was to fend off a challenge by insurgent Republicans and Democrats to ease restrictions on discharge petitions. Snell helped fashion a compromise that allowed regular Republican leaders a modicum of control.

When Longworth became Speaker in 1925, the Old Guard reestablished its dominance in the lower chamber. In this, the regular Republicans were aided by Snell&#x27;s Rules Committee in restricting Democrats and insurgent Republicans from interfering with President Calvin Coolidge&#x27;s program of spending cuts and tax reduction. To Democrats&#x27; complaints that Snell was too restrictive with the rules, the New Yorker responded that the opposition would undoubtedly do the same if and when they came back to power in the House—which they did. During these years Snell also played a role as a go-between for Congress and his college friend from Amherst, President Coolidge. This was not always a popular job, especially when differences arose between the president and Congress.

Snell backed Herbert Hoover for the 1928 GOP presidential nomination, albeit somewhat unenthusiastically. He would have preferred for President Calvin Coolidge to run for another term. Snell&#x27;s relations with the engineer president soured slightly when Hoover tried unsuccessfully to seize the initiative in New York patronage. Snell&#x27;s dream of eventually becoming Speaker was dashed with the onset of the Great Depression. In the wake of the 1930 midterm elections, the Republicans lost control of the House. After Longworth died in April 1931, Tilson and Snell tussled for the job of minority leader. Despite being favored by the president, Tilson lost the race to Snell, who appealed to both the Old Guard and to the insurgents. Tilson was too closely associated with the increasingly unpopular Hoover, and Snell had made some concessions to the progressive Republicans.

== Later career ==
With Hoover&#x27;s landslide defeat and the advent of the New Deal, Snell spent the rest of his days in Congress fighting the liberal programs of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

His initial reaction to the New Deal was one of cautious but critical cooperation. Snell, in the midst of the economic crisis, supported some early measures of the New Deal, such as the 1933 Emergency Banking Act and the 1933 Economy Act, but he came out in cautious, conservative opposition to most of the president&#x27;s program. He opposed the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the Elmer Thomas amendment favoring inflation, the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, and other early New Deal measures.

During the Court-packing battle of 1937, Snell agreed with Senate GOP leaders to allow the overwhelming Democratic majority to fight amongst themselves, which they did, sinking the plan. The so-called Roosevelt recession of 1937 also encouraged Snell and other conservatives to step up their resistance to the New Deal. In late 1937, Snell introduced legislation for a tax cut, and during the special session of Congress in the same year, Republicans and southern Democrats combined to recommit Roosevelt&#x27;s Fair Labor Standards Bill, although it was enacted in the next session.

In 1938 Snell and the GOP minority successfully opposed Roosevelt&#x27;s original executive branch reorganization plan, and the midterm elections that year were a triumph for the GOP, as they flipped 82 Democratic seats and nearly doubled the size of the Republican House delegation. However, because of declining eyesight and hearing, and his belief that the Republicans would be unable to retake the House in the near future (this would not happen until 1946), Snell decided to retire.

After his retirement in 1939, he became publisher of the Potsdam &quot;Courier-Freeman&quot;, which he had bought five years earlier, and in 1941 became owner and manager of the New York State Oil Company, of Kansas. After his death in Potsdam, New York, in 1958, he was interred in Bayside Cemetery.

Bertrand H. Snell Hall at Clarkson University is named in his honor.

<text>The United States Commission on Ocean Policy (sometimes known as the Watkins Commission, after the chairman of the commission during its first gathering, James Watkins) was created by an act of the 106th United States Congress known as the Oceans Act of 2000. The commission&#x27;s mandate was to establish findings and develop recommendations for a new and comprehensive national ocean policy. The final report was delivered in September 2004, and shortly afterwards the commission was terminated, as scheduled by the Oceans Act.

== Working groups ==

In the course of its work, the commission established four working groups to address the following issues:
* Governance
* Research, Education and Marine Operations
* Stewardship
* Investment and Implementation

== History ==
The previous review of U.S. ocean policy had been conducted thirty-five years before by the Stratton Commission, published in 1969. To account for changes in the intervening years, the U.S. Congress decided to form the Commission on Ocean Policy to conduct a new review, and develop recommendations for future ocean policy. The Oceans Act of 2000 was passed in the Senate June 6, 2000, and become effective on January 20, 2001.

The commission is composed of 16 members. Per the Act, the House of Representatives and Senate Majority each nominated eight people, and the President appointed four from each list.

The commission began its work in September 2001 with a series of nine regional meetings and 18 additional site visits in every coastal region of the United States and the Great Lakes. The Commission heard testimony from 445 experts, including many of the nation&#x27;s top ocean scientists and researchers, environmental organizations, industry, citizens, and government officials, as well as receiving written testimony from countless others.

The Commission released its Preliminary Report on April 20, 2004, for review by the nation&#x27;s Governors and other stakeholders.

On September 20, 2004, the Commission submitted its Final Report to the President and Congress, &quot;An Ocean Blueprint for the 21st Century&quot;. On December 19, 2004, the Commission officially expired as called for under the Oceans Act of 2000.

<doc id="1204345" wikidata="Q7299323" url="?curid=1204345" title="Rayner Heppenstall">
<text>John Rayner Heppenstall (27 July 1911 in Lockwood, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England – 23 May 1981 in Deal, Kent, England) was a British novelist, poet, diarist, and a BBC radio producer.

==Early life==
Heppenstall was a student at the University of Leeds, where he read English and Modern Languages, graduating in 1932. He had a brief teaching career, in Dagenham.

Coming to London in 1934, he rapidly made initial contacts in the literary world. A short study, &quot;Middleton Murry: A Study in Excellent Normality&quot; (1934) brought him for a time into John Middleton Murry&#x27;s &quot;Adelphi&quot; commune at &quot;The Oaks&quot;, where in 1935 he worked as a cook. Also in 1935 he met Dylan Thomas, sent to meet him by Sir Richard Rees of the &quot;Adelphi&quot; magazine. In short order he became a Catholic convert, and married Margaret Edwards in 1937 (with whom he later had two children: Adam Heppenstall and Lindy Heppenstall, later Foord). In the mid-1930s he was influenced by Eric Gill.

He was a friend of George Orwell, whom he first encountered in 1935 through Thomas and Rees, and later wrote about him in his memoir &quot;Four Absentees&quot;. Heppenstall, Orwell and the Irish poet Michael Sayers shared a flat in Lawford Road, Camden. Heppenstall once came home drunk and noisy, and when Orwell emerged from his bedroom and asked him to pipe down, Heppenstall took a swing at him. Orwell then beat him up with a shooting-stick, and the following morning told him to move out. Friendship was restored, but after Orwell&#x27;s death, Heppenstall wrote an account of the incident called &quot;The Shooting-Stick&quot;.

During World War II he was in the British Army, but with a Pay Corps posting at Reading, close enough to remain in touch with literary Fitzrovia. He was also posted to Northern Ireland.

In an interview for the book &quot;World Authors&quot;, Heppenstall stated he had once been a left-winger, but since the 1960s had become politically more conservative. Heppenstall also said he was especially opposed to &quot;Progressivism&quot; and World Government. He listed Jorge Luis Borges, Samuel Beckett, and Vladimir Nabokov as the writers he most admired.

==Novelist==
Heppenstall&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Blaze of Noon&quot; (1939), was critically acclaimed. Much later, in 1967, it received an Arts Council award. He was Francophile in literary terms, and his non-fiction writing reflects his tastes.

Critical attention has linked him to the French &quot;nouveau roman&quot;, in fact as an anticipator, or as a writer of the &quot;anti-novel&quot;. Several critics (including, according to his diaries, Hélène Cixous) have named Heppenstall in this connection. He is sometimes therefore grouped with Alain Robbe-Grillet, or associated with other British experimentalists: Anthony Burgess, Alan Burns, Angela Carter, B. S. Johnson, Ann Quin, Stefan Themerson and Eva Figes. &quot;The Connecting Door&quot; (1962) is singled out as being influenced by the &quot;nouveau roman&quot;.

He was certainly influenced by Raymond Roussel, whose &quot;Impressions of Africa&quot; he translated. Later novels include &quot;The Shearers&quot;, &quot;Two Moons&quot; and &quot;The Pier&quot;. He also wrote a short study of the French Catholic writer Léon Bloy (Cambridge: Bowes &amp; Bowes, 1953).

Heppenstall&#x27;s book &quot;The Fourfold Tradition&quot; was praised by V. S. Pritchett, who expressed admiration for &quot;its pleasure in literature&quot;.

==Radio work==
From 1945 to 1965, he worked for the British Broadcasting Corporation on radio as a feature writer and producer, and then for two further years as a drama producer. His contemporaries in the department included the fellow poets Louis MacNeice, W R Rodgers and Terence Tiller. One of his early adaptations was of Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Animal Farm&quot; in 1947.

In his journals, Heppenstall mentions problems he had with Evelyn Waugh regarding a radio broadcast in the 1940s. Waugh apparently felt that Heppenstall purposely insulted him when he was sent to take him to the broadcast.

==Later life==
Later in life Heppenstall moved to the town of Deal. During this time he took a strong dislike to his working-class neighbours and began deliberately lighting bonfires in order to antagonise them. Heppenstall&#x27;s final novel, &quot;The Pier&quot;, depicts a writer resembling himself murdering a similar family living next door to him.

After his death, Heppenstall&#x27;s journals were published: they caused some controversy by revealing his hostility to fellow writers such as Alan Sillitoe, and also expressing prejudices against black people, Irish people, Arabs and lesbians.

<text>DHP1, meaning Diesel Hydraulic Prototype number 1, was a prototype Type 3 mainline diesel locomotive built between 1962 and 1963 by Clayton to demonstrate their wares to British Railways. It was designed for mixed traffic work, being equipped with steam heating facilities for working passenger trains. It was painted red, with the cab area above bonnet-level height painted cream.

Visually similar to their Class 17 Type 1 product, though longer, and with the radiator grilles in the ends of the engine covers rather than the sides. The locomotive saw little service, mainly around the International Combustion works in Derby. The locomotive was broken up by Clayton&#x27;s in April 1967.

<text>George Francis Hagerup (22 January 1853 – 8 February 1921) was a Norwegian law professor, diplomat, politician for the Conservative Party and women&#x27;s rights advocate. He was the prime minister of Norway from 1895 to 1898 and from 1903 to 1905, and leader of the Conservative Party from 1899 to 1902. As a legal scholar, he is known for his contributions to the development of public international law, and was chairman of the Institut de Droit International. He was his party&#x27;s most active supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage, and was a co-founder, board member and honorary member of the Norwegian Association for Women&#x27;s Rights.

==Biography==
Francis Hagerup grew up at Horten in Vestfold, Norway. He was a son of admiral and cabinet minister Henrik Steffens Hagerup (1806–1859) and Nicoline Christine Jenssen (1808–1862). He graduated with the cand.jur. degree at the Royal Frederick University in 1876, received a grant to study abroad, and became a research fellow at the Royal Frederick University in 1879. He obtained the dr.juris degree in 1885, and was professor of law at the Royal Frederick University from 1887 to 1906. He was minister of justice in the Second cabinet Stang from 2 May 1893 to 14 October 1895. In August 1895 he was Finance minister. He was a member of the Storting from 1901 to 1906.

He served as Prime Minister of Norway for two terms. First from October 14, 1895; secondly from October 22, 1903. In social policy, Hagerup&#x27;s time as Prime Minister saw the passage of a child care law in 1896 that increased the power of local authorities and courts over neglected and abused children. Following his two bouts as Prime Minister, he served as ambassador to Copenhagen, The Hague, and Brussels. From 1916 he was ambassador in Stockholm.

Hagerup was passionately involved in the development of public international law. From 1897 he was member of the Institut de Droit International, of which he became the chairman in 1912. In 1907 he headed the Norwegian delegation at the second peace conference in The Hague. He was also delegate at international conferences regarding admiralty law. In 1920 he led the Norwegian delegation when the League of Nations convened for the first time in Geneva. The same year he was elected to the Law committee under the League council. In 1888, he founded &quot;Tidsskrift for Retsvidenskab&quot; (Journal of Jurisprudence), and served as its editor until his death.
Hagerup was also member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 1 January 1907 until his death in 1921.

Hagerup was the most prominent Conservative Party politician to support women&#x27;s suffrage and was active in the women&#x27;s rights movement. In 1884 he was a co-founder of the Norwegian Association for Women&#x27;s Rights and he was also a member of the first board of the association. In 1914 he became an honorary member of the association.

==Personal life==
He was married in 1880 to Frederikke Dorothea Bødtker (1853-1919). He died in Kristiania (now Oslo) and was buried at Vår Frelsers gravlund.

<text>HS4000 Kestrel was a prototype high-powered mainline diesel locomotive that was built in 1967 by Brush Traction, Loughborough, as a technology demonstrator for potential future British Rail and export orders. The locomotive number is a combination of the initials of Hawker Siddeley (the owners of Brush Traction) and the power rating of its Sulzer diesel engine (4,000 hp), making it the most powerful locomotive built by the company.

It was of Co-Co wheel arrangement and was fitted with a Sulzer 16LVA24 engine rated at providing a maximum speed of and weighed 133 tonnes. It was painted in a livery of yellow ochre with a broad chocolate-brown band around the lower bodyside separated by a thin white line running around the body.

==Background and design==
In the mid-1960s British rail produced specifications for type 5 locomotives weighing less than 126 tonnes with more than of power for both passenger and freight working. Brush Electric Engineering Ltd. (&quot;Brush Traction&quot;) in association with Sulzer Brothers Ltd. responded with a locomotive for British Rail&#x27;s appraisal. The body, exterior details, control console, and colours were designed by E.G. M. Wilkes of &quot;Wilkes &amp; Ward&quot; (later Wilkes &amp; Ashmore, industrial design firm based on Horsham, West Sussex). The design principle was that a single engine would require less maintenance than twin-engined vehicles, and that the very high power would mean that double heading for freight trains would be unnecessary.

===Diesel engine===
Brush employed Sulzer&#x27;s 16-cylinder Vee 16LVA24 engine made in Winterthur. Previous experience with Sulzer&#x27;s 12-cylinder twin parallel-bank dual-crank 12LDA28 engine had gone well, but the highest power available from Sulzer in this form was the 12LDA31 of . Not only did the V engines provide over , but being single-crank with the consequently lighter engine block (over the dual-bank design) gave a better power-to-weight ratio.

The engine is a four-stroke turbocharged oil-cooled design, with the oil being cooled by water in a heat exchanger, and the water cooled in radiators. The piston was . A smaller auxiliary generator (~) was used to charge the batteries or start the engine etc.

===Electrical transmission and auxiliary electrical system===
To transmit this power to the rail Brush utilised a brushless salient pole three phase alternator connected to a rectifying circuit of 84 silicon diodes producing ~2,500 kW of power for electric traction from the diesel engine. An auxiliary alternator, also brushless and producing three phase electrical power gave ~500 kW for electrical train heating, and also supplied power to electrical fans etc. in the locomotive. The armatures/rotors for both alternators were electrically energised by DC produced by the rectified output of brushless alternators.

Each of the 6 axles was powered by an individual traction motor which was a four pole force ventilated type. Connection of the axle to the motor was via a reduction gear (giving top speed), then through a flexible hollow shaft drive to the axle.

The fans (blowers) to cool the traction motors and engine radiators were of the three phase asynchronous type, the motors driving the compressors, pumps, fans for the dynamic (resistive) brake etc. were DC motors.

===Braking system===
Locomotive braking was by vacuum, air (high pressure) or dynamic (electrical regenerative resistive braking), the dynamic brakes were preferentially used at high speeds, with the air brake being activated at lower speeds where dynamic braking was less effective; speed sensors automatically determined the braking type to be used. Additionally a hydraulically activated parking brake was fitted.

===Electronic devices===
Plug-in solid state modules were used for voltage and power control including monitoring wheelslip and monitoring engine temperature.

===Superstructure construction===
A Warren truss body construction with welded, stressed steel skin was used on the sides of the locomotive which supported the transverse load of the main engine entirely.

===Bogies===
The bogie side frames were of one piece cast construction with coil spring suspension, connected by 4 transverse members; two internal and two at either end

After the Hither Green rail crash, British Rail issued a directive that all locomotives should have an axle weight of no-more than 21 tons. In an attempt to comply with this, Brush fitted the locomotive with modified British Rail Class 47 bogies. The lighter construction and traction motors helped but the attempt was ultimately unsuccessful leaving Kestrel at 22.5 tons per axle. Kestrel continued to be used but the axle-weight problem contributed to the decision to sell the locomotive and prior to this, in March 1971, the original bogies were refitted.

===Cabs===

The driver&#x27;s cab is attached to the frame below by rubber fittings. Driver controls were similar to that of Class 47.

==Career==

===British Rail===

Construction of the locomotive (Brush works No. 711 of 1967) started in 1966 and was complete by 1967. However the locomotive was considerably over the 20t axle-load limit specified by British Rail for its procurement requirements. The locomotive was officially handed over to BR on 29 January 1968 at Marylebone Station. Test runs were performed with both passenger and freight stock; the locomotive was primarily used to haul heavy freight trains - including a coal train of over 2000t weight - the locomotive achieved an 88% availability figure after .

Following the fitting of its new bogies the locomotive was used on express passenger trains. On a London King&#x27;s Cross to Newcastle service diagrammed for British Rail Class 55 (&#x27;Deltic&#x27;) operation the unit was 14mins faster than required even though the new traction motors meant reduced power at the rail.

In March 1971 it was withdrawn from service in the UK and sent back to Brush for refitting.

===Sale to Soviet Union===
The locomotive was sold to the Soviet Union in 1971 for £127,000, being shipped from Cardiff Docks to Leningrad docks by the MV &quot;Krasnokamsk&quot; in July 1971. On arrival in Russia, Kestrel was exhibited at the Moscow Rolling Stock Exhibition and then was moved to the All-Union Rail Transport Scientific Research Institute at Shcherbinka where it was re-gauged to , and tested on a circular test railway as well as being used on some parts of the Russian rail network.

After testing of the locomotive the engine was removed for static testing, and the locomotive body ballasted for use in high load tests of other vehicles.

The remains of the vehicle are believed to have been scrapped in 1993.

==Conclusions==

===United Kingdom===
The locomotive did not result in any further orders.

===Russia===
Some of the observations of Russian railway engineers relate to different practices between Russian and British locomotive design, specifically:
* Due to the smaller loading gauges in Great Britain, the cab windows were set too low for signals to be seen if the driver is standing.
* The passages were too narrow.
* The bogies were considered overly large.
* The requirement to sling the engine and compressor below the main frame was considered unusual.
* The stressed skin construction was noted as being not suitable due to corrosion increasing the susceptibility to structural weakening, as the load-bearing skin is thin and point welded.

The axle bearings, traction transmission and spherical rubber metal joints in the suspension were considered of interest.

===Developments===
Some of the HS4000&#x27;s technology was used to form the basis of, or improvements in, subsequent locomotives built in the Soviet Union.

==Models==
HS4000 &quot;Kestrel&quot; is made as a kit and ready-to-run in OO gauge by Silver Fox Models.

Heljan of Denmark have produced a highly detailed OO scale model of the Kestrel, as part of a limited run of 4000 units.

The Swanley New Barn Railway, in Swanley, Kent, operates a 7 1/4 inch gauge overscale version of the &#x27;kestrel&#x27; which was built by Mardyke Miniature Railways. Unlike the full size, this model is a diesel-hydraulic.

<text>Rishonim (; ; sing. , &quot;Rishon&quot;) were the leading rabbis and &quot;poskim&quot; who lived approximately during the 11th to 15th centuries, in the era before the writing of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; (, &quot;Set Table&quot;, a common printed code of Jewish law, 1563 CE) and following the &quot;Geonim&quot; (589–1038 CE).

The distinction between the and the is meaningful historically; in &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law) the distinction is less important. According to a widely held view in Orthodox Judaism, the Acharonim generally cannot dispute the rulings of rabbis of previous eras unless they find support from other rabbis in previous eras. On the other hand, this view is not formally a part of &quot;halakha&quot; itself, and according to some rabbis is a violation of the halakhic system. In &quot;The Principles of Jewish Law&quot;, Orthodox rabbi Menachem Elon writes that:

<text>PRAM consistency (pipelined random access memory) also known as &quot;FIFO consistency&quot;.

All processes see memory writes from one process in the order they were issued from the process. 

Writes from different processes may be seen in a different order on different processes. Only the write order needs to be consistent, thus the name &quot;pipelined&quot;.
PRAM consistency is easy to implement. In effect it says that there are no guarantees about the order in which different processes see writes, except that two or more writes from a single source must arrive in order, as though they were in a pipeline.

 P1:W(x)1 
 P2: R(x)1W(x)2
 P3: R(x)1R(x)2
 P4: R(x)2R(x)1
 Time ----&gt;
Fig: A valid sequence of events for PRAM consistency.

The above sequence is not valid for Causal consistency because W(x)1 and W(x)2 are causal, so different processes must read it in the same sequence.

<text>MapleStory () is a free-to-play, 2D, side-scrolling massively multiplayer online role-playing game, developed by South Korean company Wizet. Several versions of the game are available for specific countries or regions, published by various companies (such as Nexon).

Players travel the &quot;Maple World&quot;, defeating monsters and developing their characters&#x27; skills and abilities as is typical in role-playing video games. Players can interact with others in many ways, including chatting and trading. Groups of players can band together in parties to hunt monsters and share rewards, and can also form guilds to interact more easily with each other. Players additionally have the option to visit the in-game &quot;Cash Shop&quot; to purchase a variety of character appearances or gameplay enhancements with real money.

In July 2010, the Korean version of the game was revised in a patch named the &quot;Big Bang&quot;. Other versions followed suit and have since received the Big Bang update. Later in the year, the Korean version received the Chaos update which introduced player versus player (PvP) and professions to the game. Its sequel, &quot;MapleStory 2&quot;, was released in July 2015 and features updated 3D graphics and a similar storyline. As of 2020, &quot;MapleStory&quot; has reached over 180 million registered users worldwide and grossed over in lifetime revenue.

==Plot==
The plot of &quot;MapleStory&quot; takes place across several different worlds, such as Maple World, Arcane River, and Grandis. Created by these people with powers called the Overseers, they assigned each world with three guardians to look over both worlds: the Transcendent of Time, the Transcendent of Life and the Transcendent of Light. The first major arc revolves around the antagonist of Maple World, the Black Mage. The Black Mage was once the Transcendent of Light and was called the White Mage until an experiment went wrong and his pure light core was corrupted. The six heroes managed to seal the Black Mage for the next few centuries at the cost of being sealed away themselves. In the present day, the Black Mage&#x27;s forces called the Black Wings, began resurfacing and attempted to revive him. Fearing his resurrection, Empress Cygnus created the Cygnus Knights in order to stop the Black Wings and the Black Mage&#x27;s Commanders. As the seal on the Black Mage began weakening, the heroes of legend began returning as well. After the Black Mage broke free of his seal, Cygnus created the Maple Alliance, which banded together the free-spirited Explorers, the Cygnus Knights, the Resistance against the Black Wings, the six Heroes of Maple, and several brave adventurers from other worlds. 

The Alliance continued fighting the Black Wings and won a decisive victory in the battle of Black Heaven, during which time, a hero of the Alliance awakened as the Adversary, a champion imbued with divine energy. Soon after, the Black Mage created a dimension called the Arcane River in an attempt to destroy the world and recreate it in his image. The Adversary journeyed through the Arcane River and battled the last of the Black Mage&#x27;s Commanders before the Alliance launched a final offensive to stop the Black Mage from ending their world. The Adversary successfully killed the Black Mage and saved Maple World from annihilation.

With the Black Mage&#x27;s death, the second major arc began in the realm of Grandis, which had slowly fused with Maple World due to the Black Mage&#x27;s machinations. The antagonist of Grandis, Gerand Darmoor, believed that his race, the High Flora, was superior to all others, and so he sought to remake all life in his image. In order to stop him, several factions of Grandis had joined the Maple Alliance. After the Black Mage&#x27;s death, the Alliance sent its forces to battle Darmoor and his Apostles.

==Gameplay==
&quot;MapleStory&quot; is a 2D scrolling platform game. The controls for the game are executed using the keyboard and mouse. The keyboard is used for many game functions, and much of it can be rearranged to suit users&#x27; needs. The mouse is mainly used to trigger non-player characters and manipulate items. Gameplay centers on venturing into dungeons and combating monsters in real time. The players combat monsters and complete quests, in the process acquiring in-game currency called &quot;Mesos&quot;, experience points, and various items. Players are able to acquire in-game professions, allowing them to craft equipment, accessories or potions.

Players have a variety of options when interacting with others online: they can form parties where loot and experience are distributed from a monster; in-game marriages where the game will recognize the two players as a heterosexual couple; guilds which is indicated with a guild&#x27;s name listed under their character name; or families, an architecture gathering of juniors and seniors. Players are able to raise or lower the in-game popularity stat entitled Fame of other players and compete with other players in minigames, such as Gomoku or Concentration. They may engage in trading activities for &quot;Mesos&quot; or other in-game items.

There is small content that differs depending on the country it is serviced in. Recently, Korea Maple Story (KMS)&#x27;s artifact update was completed and is receiving a lot of attention.

===Characters===
&quot;MapleStory&quot; characters exist in worlds or servers. Players are able to create multiple characters in each world, though the characters in different worlds can not interact with each other. Each world is similar in content with each other. The worlds are divided into channels, among which characters are allowed to freely switch. The ability to transfer entire characters between worlds was added in December 2007 to Global &quot;MapleStory&quot;, with restrictions placed on items. In May 2012, this option was removed as it caused a negative impact on character gameplay.

When creating a new character, there are eight branches of classes currently available to choose from with three classes that have no specific branches currently: Explorers, Cygnus Knights, Heroes, Resistance, Sengoku, Nova, Flora, and Anima. Beast Tamer, Child of God and Kinesis are classes that currently have no specific branches. Some classes are currently not available in other regions while others are only available at certain times of year.

Explorer characters start on Maple Island and begin as a Beginner class. The Beginner is able to advance into one of the five classes: Warrior, Bowmen, Magician, Thief, and Pirate. After choosing their class, further class progression is only allowed within the scope of the first class advancement with advancements at level 30, 60, 100, and 200. Three separate classes, under the adventurer branch, are created differently from normal Adventurers: Dual Blade (Thief), Kinesis (Magician) and Cannoneers (Pirate).

Cygnus Knight characters begin as Noblesse class and begin their journey on Ereve. At level 10, they are allowed to class advance into five Cygnus Knight classes, each one parallels to the Explorer class. Upon reaching the level limit of 120, Cygnus Knights are able to change into a level 50 explorer with benefits.

Six Hero classes are available: Aran, Evan, Mercedes, Phantom, Luminous and Shade. The Hero classes are characters with background stories related to the antagonist of the game, the Black Mage. Aran has the Combo System, a unique feature to the class, allowing them to generate combo counts by hitting monsters, giving them buffs and allowing them to cast combo-consuming skills. Evan is similar to Magicians, but uses a dragon, which fights alongside them. Mercedes is an elven archer who uses Dual Bowguns. Phantom is a Thief character with the ability to mimic skills from Adventurer characters. Luminous is a magician of light who can also use dark magic which they absorbed from the Black Mage. Shade is the sixth and forgotten hero, whose existence was erased during the sealing of the Black Mage. They use spirits to aid them in battle.

Resistance characters begin in Edelstein, a town taken over by the Black Mage&#x27;s followers, the Black Wings. The characters created under the Resistance branch begin as Citizens and have four available job advancements: Battle Mage, Wild Hunter, Blaster and Mechanic. A Battle Mage uses a staff for physical attacks, a Wild Hunter rides a jaguar while wielding a crossbow, a Blaster uses an arm cannon and a Mechanic uses a robotic suit to fight. Demon, a separate class, under the resistance branch, is created differently from the normal Resistance. A Demon character can become a Demon Slayer, who uses one-handed blunt weapons and axes, or the Demon Avenger, who uses a specialised weapon called the Desperado. Xenon, another separate resistance character, is a human-turned-cyborg who escaped from the Black Wings&#x27; laboratories who uses Whip Blades in combat.

There are three main continents common to all versions in the &quot;MapleStory&quot; world: Maple Island, Victoria Island, and Ossyria. Maple Island is where adventurers start off their characters. Victoria Island contains eight cities, and is where most classes begin. Ossyria features seven distinct regions with varying environments: El Nath Mountains, Ludus Lake, Aqua Road, Minar Forest, Mu Lung Garden, Nihal Desert, and Temple of Time. Ereve and Rien are separated from another land which is the beginning of another job of the game.

The Cash Shop is an in-game shop where players use real-life currency to purchase unique virtual goods such as avatars, digital pets and other in-game items. Most Cash Shop items expire after a period of time. The Cash Shop also offers a shop permit, allowing players to set up a store in the in-game market location called the Free Market.

== Music ==
The current main composer for &quot;MapleStory&quot; is NECORD (ASTERIA). In 2016, Nexon established its own music production team, ASTERIA, and sound team, NECORD, and started producing music and releasing albums on its own. In 2017, they recorded music with an orchestra in Budapest, Hungary.

The game&#x27;s music received positive reviews, and as the game has been on the service for a long time, it has stimulated memories for those who have stopped playing. Some music such as Lith Harbor village music, Eos Tower/Helios Tower of Ludibrium music, Blockbuster: Black Heaven music, Chu Chu Island music, Lachelein the Dreaming City music has been played in South Korean broadcast programs. The &quot;Aquarium&quot; music in the Aquarium which is a village of Aqua Road has been included in some South Korean music textbooks.

The music from 2006 to 2015 was composed by Studio EIM, and since 2014, official sound sources began to be released starting with FriendStory and Blockbuster: Black Heaven. At this time, M2U, who was outsourced from Studio EIM, composed Ariant Coliseum music and Ereve music.

In 2010, Kim Eun-bi, who was in the top 6 of Superstar K 2, became a Maple Girl, a promotional model for &quot;MapleStory&quot;, and unlike other Maple Girls, she released a song called I&#x27;m My Fan. In 2015, incumbent professional singer Taru sang a song, and from 2017, Second Moon began to play songs in offline events related to &quot;MapleStory&quot;, because they were in charge of music for the hologram musical &quot;Comic MapleStory&quot; in 2016. From 2018, Ha Hyun-woo of Guckkasten and the Guckkasten band themselves began to sing songs related to that game. In 2021, Bewhy also sang a song.

S.I.D-Sound composed some music such as &quot;MapleStory&quot; 8th anniversary event in 2011, the RED theme song in 2013, and the OST for FriendStory in 2014.

In 2015, SQUARE MUSIQ composed some songs such as Violeta Over Flowers which is a promotion song and vocal of &quot;Promise of Heaven&quot;, which is a song of Blockbuster: Black Heaven.

In 2020, ESTIMATE and ESTi composed some music such as some Yum Yum Island music, theme of Adele&#x27;s music, some Ristonia music, some Grand Athenaeum Episode VI: Sharenian Knights music and some Hotel Arcus music.

==Development==
&quot;MapleStory&quot; was originally developed and released in South Korea and was localized to ten different regions as of 2003. As other publishers license the game for their region, proxy blocks are put in place (excluding the Korean version, it requires a KSSN), forcing players to play their localized version. In 2011, LevelUp! Games did not renew the contract for localization in Brazil.

An update entitled &quot;Big Bang&quot; was released in Korean &quot;MapleStory&quot; in July 2010 with other regional servers following suit soon after. &quot;Big Bang&quot; changed the game&#x27;s core coding, and changed many aspects of the game. An update entitled &quot;Chaos&quot; features the introduction of professions, and PvP.

An update for &quot;Master&quot;″s North American server was released on March 11, 2015, entitled &quot;Black Heaven&quot;. Players that registered prior to the update and before March 9 received a free Ignition Pack if they logged in before March 14 and after the update went live.

Nexon released the &quot;MapleStory Reboot&quot; update for its North American server in December 2015, which allows access to the Reboot world. This world has disabled trading, increased Meso drop rates, and weapon/equipment drops that are specific to the player&#x27;s class. Reboot has the same monsters as other worlds, but with increased stats and experience points awarded.

Another update to the game, the 5th Job Advancement, was released in December 2016. When players reach Level 200 in the game, they would need to complete their job advancement quests before they are able to fully access their 5th Job skills. Different from the first four Job skills, the 5th Job skills come in three types of skills. The first one called the Shared Skills are skills that all characters share and have that they are able to use. The second one is called the Class-Specific, which are skills that only specific classes can use and the third one called the Job Skills which are skills that only that specific Job can use.

In July 2022, Nexon released the &quot;Destiny: Remastered&quot; update for its North American server. This update revamped all the Explorer classes (excluding the newest Explorer class, Pathfinder) by updating their skills and adding new storyline content for them while streamlining their original storylines. A new boss, Kalos, was also added to the game.

Nexon released an update named 6th Job Advancement in October and November 2023, featuring new skills for all classes.

==Players and revenue==
In Global &quot;MapleStory&quot; (GMS), more than a million players bought items in the Cash Shop, by 2010. By 2006, &quot;MapleStory&quot; had a combined total of 39 million user accounts worldwide. &quot;MapleStory&quot; Global had over 8 million users by 2011. As of 2014, it was among the top ten MMOs by worldwide revenue. As of 2020, the game has reached over 180 million registered users worldwide.

Up until 2011, the game grossed $1.8 billion. Between 2013 and 2017, the game grossed $1.181 billion, including $326 million in 2013, $240 million in 2014, $253 million in 2015, $83 million in 2016, and $279 million in 2017. As of 2020, the game has grossed over worldwide in lifetime revenue.

== Microtransactions legal penalties ==

In 2024, Nexon was fined US$8.9 million for a violation of South Korea&#x27;s Consumer Protection in Electronic Commerce Act, allegedly for changing the appearance rate of certain items in &quot;MapleStory&quot; without notifying players. At the time, this was the largest penalty issued for a violation of the act and the company&#x27;s second violation of the act, following a 2018 fine connected to its game &quot;Sudden Attack&quot;.

<text>Woodley is a suburb in the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport, Greater Manchester, England. It is situated mostly on the east side of the Peak Forest Canal, next to Bredbury, Romiley and the boundary with Tameside, at Gee Cross. Historically part of Cheshire, the name means &quot;a clearing in the wood&quot; because the area contains much woodland.

Woodley is situated close to J25 of the M60 Manchester orbital motorway. The A560 passes through the suburb, which runs between Altrincham, Stockport, Gee Cross and Hattersley.

===Canal===

The Peak Forest Canal runs through Woodley, which features a long tunnel under the A560. It was completed in 1805. Although much of the canal fell into disuse by the early 1960s, it was restored and reopened subsequently in April 1974.

==Education==
Woodley has two primary schools:
* Woodley Primary School, previously called Woodley Infant and Junior schools. The school also ran a nursery which was next to (and connected to) Woodley Methodist Church.
* Greave Primary School, in Greave, on the border with Romiley.

Primary school aged children can also attend a nearby school in neighbouring Bredbury: St. Mark&#x27;s Church of England Primary School on Redhouse Lane; this was the original infant and junior school for the locality.

Most students then feed to either Werneth School, Marple Hall School or Harrytown Catholic High School for their secondary education.

Woodley is home to four pubs: The White Hart, The Railway, The Navigation and The Woodley Arms. They form the start of the &quot;Ring of Death&quot;, a pub crawl that takes in Woodley, Bredbury, Romiley and ends in Greave; it used to consist of twenty pubs in total and was a traditional marathon undertaken by locals at Christmas.

Woodley was also home to a snooker hall which, following the removal of its snooker tables, became the &quot;Palace Bar&quot;; it has now closed.

<doc id="1204391" wikidata="Q174181" url="?curid=1204391" title="James Hanley (novelist)">
<text>James (Joseph) Hanley (3 September 1897 – 11 November 1985) was a British novelist, short story writer, and playwright from Kirkdale, Liverpool, Lancashire, of Irish descent. Hanley came from a seafaring family and spent two years at sea himself, during World War I. He published his first novel &quot;Drift&quot; in 1930. In the 1930s and 1940s his novels and short stories focussed on seamen and their families, and included &quot;Boy&quot; (1931), the subject of an obscenity trial. After World War II there was less emphasis on the sea in his works. While frequently praised by critics, Hanley&#x27;s novels did not sell well. In the late 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s he wrote plays, mainly for the BBC, for radio and then for television, and also for the theatre. He returned to the novel in the 1970s. His last novel, &quot;A Kingdom&quot;, was published in 1978, when he was eighty. His brother Gerald was also a novelist.

==Biography==
Born in Kirkdale, Liverpool, Lancashire, in 1897 (not Dublin, nor 1901 as he generally implied) to a working-class family. Both his parents were, on the other hand, born in Ireland, his father Edward Hanley around 1865, in Dublin, and his mother, Bridget Roache, in Queenstown, County Cork, around 1867. However, both were &quot;well established in Liverpool by 1891&quot;, when they were married. Hanley&#x27;s father worked most of his life as a stoker, particularly on Cunard liners, and other relatives had also gone to sea. James also grew up living close to the docks. He left school in the summer of 1910 and worked for four years in an accountants&#x27; office. Then early in 1915, aged 17 he went to sea for the first time (not 13 as he again implied). Thus life at sea was a formative influence and much of his early writing is about seamen.

Then, in April 1917, Hanley jumped ship in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, and shortly thereafter joined the Canadian Army in Fredericton, New Brunswick. Hanley fought in France in the summer of 1918, but was invalided out shortly thereafter. After the war he worked as a railway porter in Bootle and he devoted himself &quot;to a prodiguous range of autodidactic, high cultural activities – learning the piano, regularly attending […] concerts […] reading voraciously and, above all, writing.&quot; However, it was not until 1930 that his novel &quot;Drift&quot; was accepted.

Hanley moved from Liverpool to near Corwen, North Wales in 1931, where he met Dorothy Enid &quot;Timothy&quot; Thomas, née Heathcote, a descendant of Lincolnshire nobility. They lived together and had a child, Liam Powys Hanley, in 1933, but did not marry until 1947.
As World War II was approaching, in July 1939, Hanley moved to London, to write documentaries and plays for the BBC, but he moved back to Wales, to Llanfechain, the other side of the Berwyn Mountains from Corwen, in the early years of the war, where he remained until 1963, when the Hanleys moved to North London, close to their son Liam.

Hanley published an autobiographical work, &quot;Broken Water: An Autobiographical Excursion&quot; in 1937, and while this generally presents a true overall picture of his life, it is seriously flawed, incomplete and inaccurate. Chris Gostick describes it as &quot;a teasing palimpsest of truth and imagination&quot;.

Hanley&#x27;s brother was the novelist Gerald Hanley and his nephew the American novelist and playwright William Hanley. James Hanley&#x27;s wife also published three novels, as Timothy Hanley. She died in 1980. James Hanley himself died in 1985. He was buried in Llanfechain, Wales.

Hanley&#x27;s first publication, the novel &quot;Drift&quot; (1930), was written under the influence of James Joyce. While &quot;Drift&quot; is about an Irish Catholic family, the setting is Liverpool, and in the 1930s Hanley wrote largely about the Irish community in Liverpool, especially with the semi-autobiographical novels about the Fury family, &quot;The Furys&quot; (1935), &quot;The Secret Journey&quot; (1936), and &quot;Our Time is Gone&quot; (1940), as well as &quot;Ebb and Flood&quot; (1932). Hanley&#x27;s novels of the 1930s and 1940s also focus on life at sea. Hanley wrote two further novels about the Furys of Liverpool, &quot;Winter Song&quot; (1950), and &quot;An End and a Beginning&quot; (1958), though Irish and especially Roman Catholic characters continue to have a significant role throughout most of Hanley&#x27;s career.

James Hanley consistently explored the lives of men and women &quot;in extremes&quot;, that is in dramatically precarious states of fear and isolation, which tend to lead to violence and madness. A grim early example is in the novella &quot;The Last Voyage&quot; (1931). John Reilly is a fireman who is still working only because he has lied about his age, and now faces his last voyage. Reilly although he is in his mid-sixties has a young family, and therefore the family will have to live on his inadequate pension. In another sense this is Reilly&#x27;s last voyage, because despairing as to the future he throws himself into the ship&#x27;s furnace: &quot;Saw all his life illuminated in those flames. &#x27;Not much for us. Sweat, sweat. Pay off. Sign on. Sweat, sweat. Pay off. Finish. Ah, well!&quot;.

In &quot;Boy&quot; (1931) young Fearon&#x27;s isolation and suffering arise because no one cares for him. The story of &quot;Boy&quot; is &quot;sordid and horrible&quot;. The young protagonist&#x27;s parents are only interested in the wages he can earn, and encourage him to leave school as soon as possible. Likewise society is unconcerned about the harsh, unhealthy conditions he endures cleaning ships&#x27; boilers. Then, when he goes to sea, he is sexually abused by his fellow seamen. Finally, when young Fearon is dying in agony from a venereal disease caught in a Cairo brothel, his Captain smothers him.

&quot;Boy&quot; was reprinted in 1931, and 1932, when an American first edition was also published. Then, when it was reprinted in 1934, in a cheap (second) edition with a &quot;scantily dressed&quot; belly dancer on its cover, &quot;Boy&quot; was prosecuted for obscenity. The court case followed a complaint to the police in Bury, near Manchester, Lancashire: &quot;The prosecution suggested that the cover of the book and extracts from reviews just inside were most suggestive, and that the purpose was to pollute young people&#x27;s minds&quot;. The publishers Boriswood &quot;were advised that, owing to the book&#x27;s reference to &#x27;intimacy between members of the male sex&#x27;, any defence against prosecution was futile&#x27;&quot;. In March 1935 Boriswood pleaded guilty of &quot;uttering and publishing an obscene libel&quot; and paid a substantial fine.

Subsequently &quot;Boy&quot; was republished by the Obelisk Press in Paris in 1935 and 1946. Jack Kahane owner of this company was a noted publisher of banned books in English, including Henry Miller&#x27;s &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; and &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;. Other editions followed, including one by Penguin Books in 1992, with an introduction by Anthony Burgess and most recently, in 2007, by Oneworld Classics.

It is not surprising that Hanley should show an interest in extreme situations, given his early awareness of the precariousness of life in the working class world that he came from. Hanley would also have sensed, very early in his life, that individual lives of the working poor and their children was of little value in a modern industrial city like Liverpool. All this encouraged his exploration not only of working class life but also the emotional life of characters on the periphery of society.

There is an exploration of another type of extreme situation in those works of Hanley which deal with a shipwreck, such as &quot;Narrative&quot; (1931), and the World War II novels &quot;The Ocean&quot; (1941), &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Song&quot; (1943), though these extreme situations are undergone by groups of men, and &quot;were primarily inspiriting in their representation of maritime heroism&quot;.

===After World War II===

In the 1950s he wrote some of &quot;his finest novels&quot;, &quot;Closed Harbour&quot; (1952), &quot;The Welsh Sonata&quot; (1954), &quot;Levine&quot; (1956), and &quot;An End and a Beginning&quot; (1958), the final volume of the Furys sequence. Characters in extreme situations is also the subject these novels of Hanley&#x27;s maturity, where the male protagonists, following some trauma, are both unemployed and isolated from family and society.

Hanley&#x27;s protagonists tend to be solitary figures and his concern is with loneliness, rootlessness, violence and madness and &quot;he was never a political novelist or propagandist&quot;. He described himself as an anarchist, in a statement sent to International Pen. &quot;I have been labelled a &#x27;Proletarian writer&#x27; [… which] is to be party to more than one quite absurd theory, one of which is that only one section society is evil, and only one section capable of soaring; this message comes out of Communist vacuums […] My whole attitude is anarchial (sic), I do not believe in the State at all &quot;.

In the 1960s, because of his lack of financial success as a novelist, Hanley turned to writing plays for radio, television, and occasionally the theatre. While he wrote mostly for the BBC, his plays were also produced in several other countries, including the CBC in Canada. Hanley&#x27;s play &quot;Say Nothing&quot; was on stage for a month at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East in 1962 and off Broadway, New York, in 1965, while &quot;Inner Journey&quot; was on stage in Hamburg in 1966, as well as New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center for a month in 1969.

Hanley returned to the novel form in the 1970s, publishing &quot;Another World&quot;, &quot;A Woman in the Sky&quot; (1973), &quot;A Dream Journey&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Kingdom&quot; (1978), all of which &quot;were positively received&quot;. Several of Hanley&#x27;s later novels were derived from earlier plays.

Hanley also frequently published short stories and book reviews, throughout his career, and some of these stories were subsequently collected and published in book form.

==Subject matter==

===War fiction===
Hanley experienced both World Wars. He served in the merchant navy during World War I from early in 1915 until he deserted to join the Canadian Army late April 1917. He was demobilized in the Spring of 1919. Hanley only briefly experienced frontline conflict in 1918 and was soon after invalided out. He was also in London at the beginning of the World War II during the Blitz of 1940–1. Hanley deals with his First World War experiences, on the battlefield, in his novella, &quot;The German Prisoner&quot;, and his experience in the merchant navy, on a ship commandeered by the British Admiralty to serve as a troopship, in works like the novella &quot;Narrative&quot; (1931), and his novel &quot;The Hollow Sea&quot; (1938). These experiences are also dealt with in Hanley&#x27;s non-fiction work, &quot;Broken Water: An Autobiographical Excursion&quot; (1937). 

He uses both his earlier merchant navy experience, as well as the Blitz, in subsequent novels and short stories in the 1940s and 1950s. The Hanleys left Wales in July 1939 and led &quot;an unsettled, almost nomadic existence&quot; part of which was spent in London, and, while living in Chelsea, in August 1940 they &quot;experienced the Blitz at first hand&quot;. Finally, January 1941, they returned to Wales, taking up residence in Llanfechain, Powys.

The third novel in Hanley&#x27;s The Furys Chronicle, &quot;Our Time is Gone&quot;, was published in 1940, and takes place in middle of the First World War, between in November 1915, and September 1916&quot;. The action takes place mostly in Gelton. The father Denny Fury has returned to the sea, &quot;as a stoker on a liner that has been taken over as a troopship,&quot; and Desmond Fury is a captain in the army. Peter Fury is serving a fifteen-year prison sentence for his murder of Mrs Ragner. However, John Fordham comments on the fact that &quot;Our Time is Gone&quot; &quot;discloses a surprisingly non-belligerent tone for a Second World War novel&quot; and the &quot;unprecedented&quot; for a novel published during a war &quot;central heroism of Joseph Kilkey&quot; who is a conscientious objector.

Two other works published during World War II, &quot;The Ocean&quot; (1941) and &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Song&quot; (1943), explore &quot;virtually identical&quot; situations, that involve ships that have &quot;been torpedoed and sunk mid-ocean&quot;. This is a similar plot to that of the conclusion of the earlier novella &quot;Narrative&quot;, which is set during the previous war. Hanley also published, in 1943, &quot;No Directions&quot;, which is set during the London Blitz, a work that has been commented on by several literary critics. He later re-used this novel, to form the middle section of &quot;A Dream Journey&quot; (1976). Hanley had initially planned on turning &quot;No Directions&quot; into a trilogy.

War also has a role in several of his post Second World War novels, including &quot;Emily&quot; (1948), &quot;The Closed Harbour&quot; (1952), and &quot;Levine&quot; (1956). The eponymous protagonist of &quot;Emily&quot; meets her husband, who is on leave after spending four years away fighting the Japanese in Burma, at Paddington Station. Their home and all their possessions were destroyed in the Blitz, while it has &quot;mentally shattered&quot; their elder son. &quot;The Closed Harbour&quot; is set in Marseilles during World War II, after Germany&#x27;s defeat of France, and the protagonist Eugene Marius has lost a ship in a minefield, and all but one of his crew, including his nephew drowned. As a result of this he has lost his captain&#x27;s ticket and cannot find work. After months of unemployment Marius eventually descends into madness. &quot;Levine&quot; is set in Poland during the same war and Levine witnesses the murder of his mother and abduction of his sister by invading soldiers. Subsequently he becomes a sailor. Then he is shipwrecked and spends time in an internment camp in southern England, before escaping. Levine then encounters Grace, who has been freed from her controlling parents when they are killed by a German bomb. This novel, like &quot;The Closed Harbour&quot; and many of Hanley&#x27;s novels, has a tragic climax, with Levine murdering Grace.

Edward Stokes also notes that two post-war short stories collections, &quot;Crilley and Other Stories&quot; (1945) and &quot;A Walk in the Wilderness&quot; (1950), deal with the impact of war on peoples lives.

===Works set in Wales===
Hanley lived a large part of his writing life, from 1931 until 1963, in Wales, and wrote several works with a Welsh setting and subject matter. The first full length work was &quot;Grey Children: A Study in Humbug and Misery&quot; (1937). The subject matter of this non-fiction work, unemployment in industrial South Wales, though has more in common with Hanley&#x27;s novels of the 1930s about the struggles of working class Liverpudleians. In genre &quot;Grey Children&quot; belongs with George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot;, published earlier in 1937.

However, Hanley lived in Wales for over twenty years before he wrote at length about rural Wales, where he lived. This came in 1953, with the publication of &quot;Anatomy of Llangyllwch&quot;, in &quot;Don Quixote Drowned&quot;. Here Hanley uses the fictional name &quot;Llangyllwch&quot; for his fictional portrait of the village Llanfechain, where the Hanleys moved in the early 1940s. This is on the other side of the Berwyn Mountains from Corwen, close to the English border.

A local character from Llanfechain was also the source of the central character, Rhys, in &quot;The Welsh Sonata&quot; (1954), which was Hanley&#x27;s first full-length novel with a Welsh setting. This novel marks an important step forward in Hanley&#x27;s attempt to give form to his feelings about Wales. &quot;The Welsh Sonata&quot; is narrated from the perspective of Welsh characters, and Hanley occasional uses Welsh words, and he employs, at times, a poetic style.

Almost twenty years after &quot;The Welsh Sonata&quot;, in 1972, Hanley&#x27;s second Welsh novel, &quot;Another World&quot; appeared. Hanley&#x27;s third Welsh novel, &quot;A Kingdom&quot; (1978), published &quot;remarkably&quot; when he was 80, was his last novel. As he had been living in North London since 1963, this is very much written at a distance. There is a suggestion of the influence of the austere poetry of Hanley&#x27;s friend, Welsh poet-priest, R. S. Thomas in this &quot;elegiac evocation of hill-farm life&quot;.

==Reputation==
Following Hanley&#x27;s death in 1985 there has been the occasional reprinting, including, by Harvill &quot;The Last Voyage and Other Stories&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Ocean&quot; (1999); and more recently by OneWorld Classics, &quot;Boy&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Closed Harbour&quot; (2009), both with new biographical information provided by Chris Gostick. Several titles are also available from Fabers reprints on demand service. In 2013 Parthian Books published &quot;A Kingdom&quot; in their series &quot;Library of Wales&quot;.

Hanley&#x27;s works have been translated into a number of languages, including French, German, Dutch, Spanish and Swedish.
This includes his play &quot;Inner Journey&quot; that was performed in Hamburg, Germany with the title &quot;Für Immer und Ewig&quot; in September 1966. A Finnish version of his play &quot;Say Nothing&quot; was produced by the Finnish National Theatre.

In September 2001, to mark what was then believed to be the centennial of James Hanley&#x27;s birth, a one-day symposium was held at Jesus College, Cambridge. Another important landmark was the publication in 2002 of John Fordham&#x27;s &quot;James Hanley: Modernism and the Working Class&quot; by the University of Wales Press, which amongst other things suggests that Hanley is not simply a realist or naturalist, but because of his use of expressionistic techniques, should be seen as a modernist. Fordham&#x27;s study also contains new biographical material.

Hanley never achieved major success as a writer, even though he often received favourable reviews, both in Britain and America and counted amongst his admirers E.M. Forster, T. E. Lawrence, Anthony Burgess, and Henry Green. In 1999 Doris Lessing described &quot;The Ocean&quot; as &quot;a great novel&quot;. John Cowper Powys in his &quot;Preface&quot; to James Hanley&#x27;s &quot;Men in Darkness&quot; (1931), comments: &quot;There are few people who could read these powerful and terrible tales without being strongly affected&quot; (ix). And more recently Alberto Manguel questions: &quot;Why one of the major 20th-century writers should have suffered such a fickle fate is a question to which, no doubt, modern readers will have to answer to the sound of the Author&#x27;s final trumpets&quot;.

A dramatised version of &quot;Boy&quot; was broadcast on BBC Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Play&quot; on 16 March 1996, and &quot;The Furys&quot; was serialized on BBC Radio, February/March 2001. It was dramatized for radio and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 FM, 2 March 2001. In 2016 BBC Cymru Wales broadcast in the series 15 Minute Drama, titled &quot;Writing the Century: The Hanleys&quot; on James Hanley and his wife, dramatised by Lizzie Nunnery and directed by Janine H. Jones. The five episodes were based on almost weekly letters from the Hanleys to their son Liam.

<doc id="1204401" wikidata="Q303618" url="?curid=1204401" title="Diplomatic rank">
<text>Diplomatic rank is a system of professional and social rank used in the world of diplomacy and international relations. A diplomat&#x27;s rank determines many ceremonial details, such as the order of precedence at official processions, table seatings at state dinners, the person to whom diplomatic credentials should be presented, and the title by which the diplomat should be addressed.

== International diplomacy ==

=== Ranks ===
The current system of diplomatic ranks was established by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961). There are three top ranks, two of which remain in use:

* &quot;Ambassador&quot;. An ambassador is a head of mission who is accredited to the receiving country&#x27;s head of state. They head a diplomatic mission known as an embassy, headquartered in a chancery usually in the receiving state&#x27;s capital.
** A papal nuncio is considered to have ambassadorial rank, and presides over a nunciature.
** Commonwealth countries send a high commissioner who presides over a high commission and has the same diplomatic rank as an ambassador.
* &quot;Minister&quot;. A minister was a head of mission who was accredited to the receiving country&#x27;s government. A minister headed a legation rather than an embassy. After World War II, the embassy became the standard form of diplomatic mission, and the rank of minister is now obsolete. Many countries use the title minister-counsellor to refer to the deputy head of a mission, but does not hold the rank of minister.
** An envoy or an internuncio is also considered to have the rank of minister.
* &quot;Chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot;:
** A chargé d&#x27;affaires &quot;en pied&quot; is a permanent head of mission who is accredited by their country&#x27;s foreign minister to the receiving nation&#x27;s foreign minister, in cases where the two governments have not reached an agreement to exchange ambassadors.
** A chargé d&#x27;affaires &quot;ad interim&quot; is a diplomat who temporarily heads a diplomatic mission in the absence of an ambassador.

The body of diplomats accredited to a country form the diplomatic corps. Ambassadors have precedence over chargés, and precedence within each rank is determined by the date on which diplomatic credentials were presented. The longest-serving ambassador is the dean of the diplomatic corps, who speaks for the entire diplomatic corps on matters of diplomatic privilege and protocol. In many Catholic countries, the papal nuncio is always considered the dean of the diplomatic corps.

=== Historical ranks, 1815–1961 ===

The ranks established by the Vienna Convention (1961) modify a more elaborate system of ranks that was established by the Congress of Vienna (1815):

* &quot;Ambassadors&quot;, legates and nuncios were personal representatives of their sovereign.
* &quot;Envoys&quot; and ministers represented their government and were accredited to the receiving sovereign. 
* &quot;Ministers resident&quot; formed an intermediate class between ministers and chargés. This rank was created by the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818) 
* &quot;Chargés d&#x27;affaires&quot; were accredited by their foreign minister to the receiving foreign minister.

The rank of &quot;envoy&quot; was short for &quot;envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary&quot;, and was more commonly known as &quot;minister&quot;. For example, the &quot;envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States to the French Empire&quot; was known as the &quot;United States Minister to France&quot; and addressed as &quot;Monsieur le Ministre&quot;.

An Ambassador was regarded as the personal representative of his sovereign as well as his government. Only major monarchies would exchange Ambassadors with each other, while smaller monarchies and republics only sent Ministers. Because of diplomatic reciprocity, Great Powers would only send a minister to a smaller monarchy or a republic. For example, in the waning years of the Second French Empire, the United Kingdom sent an ambassador to Paris, while Sweden-Norway and the United States sent ministers.

The rule that only monarchies could send ambassadors was more honored in the breach than the observance. This had been true even before the Congress of Vienna, as England continued to appoint ambassadors after becoming a republic in 1649. Countries that overthrew their monarchs proved to be unwilling to accept the lower rank accorded to a republic. After the Franco-Prussian War, the French Third Republic continued to send and receive ambassadors. The rule became increasingly untenable as the United States grew into a Great Power. The United States followed the French precedent in 1893, and began to exchange ambassadors with other Great Powers.

Historically, the order of precedence had been a matter of great dispute. European powers agreed that the papal nuncio and imperial ambassador would have precedence, but could not agree on the relative precedence of the kingdoms and smaller countries. In 1768, the French and Russian ambassadors to Great Britain even fought a duel over who had the right to sit next to the imperial ambassador at a court ball. After several diplomatic incidents between their ambassadors, France and Spain agreed in 1761 to let the date of arrival determine their precedence. In 1760, Portugal attempted to apply seniority to all ambassadors, but the rule was rejected by the other European courts.

The Congress of Vienna finally put an end to these disputes over precedence. After an initial attempt to divide countries into three ranks faltered on the question of which country should be in each rank, the Congress instead decided to divide &quot;diplomats&quot; into three ranks. A fourth rank was added by the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818). Each diplomatic rank had precedence over the lower ranks, and precedence within each rank was determined by the date that their credentials were presented. The papal nuncio could be given a different precedence than the other ambassadors. The Holy Roman Empire had ceased to exist in 1806, so the Austrian ambassador would accumulate seniority along with the other ambassadors.

=== Bilateral diplomacy ===
In modern diplomatic practice, there are a number of diplomatic ranks below Ambassador. Since most missions are now headed by an ambassador, these ranks now rarely indicate a mission&#x27;s (or its host nation&#x27;s) relative importance, but rather reflect the diplomat&#x27;s individual seniority within their own nation&#x27;s diplomatic career path and in the diplomatic corps in the host nation:

*Ambassador (High Commissioner in Commonwealth missions to other Commonwealth countries); ambassador at large
*Minister
*Minister-counsellor
*Counsellor
*First secretary
*Second secretary
*Third secretary
*Attaché
*Assistant attaché

The term &quot;attaché&quot; is used for any diplomatic agent who does not fit in the standard diplomatic ranks, often because they are not (or were not traditionally) members of the sending country&#x27;s diplomatic service or foreign ministry, and were therefore only &quot;attached&quot; to the diplomatic mission. The most frequent use is for military attachés, but the diplomatic title may be used for any specific individual or position as required, generally related to a specific or technical field. Since administrative and technical staff benefit from only limited diplomatic immunity, some countries may routinely appoint support staff as attachés. Attaché does not, therefore, denote any rank or position (except in Soviet and post-Soviet diplomatic services, where attaché is the lowest diplomatic rank of a career diplomat). Note that many traditional functionary roles, such as press attaché or cultural attaché, are not formal titles in diplomatic practice, although they may be used as a matter of custom.

===Multilateral diplomacy===
Furthermore, outside this traditional pattern of bilateral diplomacy, as a rule on a permanent residency basis (though sometimes doubling elsewhere), certain ranks and positions were created specifically for multilateral diplomacy:
*An ambassador-at-large is equivalent to an ambassador and assigned specific tasks or region in which they are assigned various assignments aimed at multi track diplomacy.
*A permanent representative is the equivalent of an ambassador, normally of that rank, but accredited to an international body (mainly by member—and possibly observer—states), not to a head of state.
*A resident representative (or sometimes simply &quot;representative&quot;) is also a member of the diplomatic corps, but is below the rank of ambassador. A representative is accredited by an international organization (generally a United Nations agency, or a Bretton Woods institution) to a country&#x27;s government. The resident representative typically heads the country office of that international organization within that country.
*A &quot;special ambassador or honorary ambassador&quot; is a government&#x27;s specialist diplomat in a particular field, not posted in residence, but often traveling around the globe.
*The U.S. trade representative (USTR) is an ambassador of Cabinet rank, in charge of U.S. delegations in multilateral trade negotiations (since 1962). The USTR&#x27;s special agricultural negotiator also typically holds an ambassadorial appointment.

====Special envoy====
Special envoys have been created &quot;ad hoc&quot; by individual countries, treaties and international organizations including the United Nations. A few examples are provided below:

* Belgium: In 2005, former cabinet member Pierre Chevalier served as &quot;Special Envoy of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe presidency&quot; to mediate in the Gazprom natural gas-pipeline crisis involving Russia, Ukraine, and the European Union. In addition, Princess Astrid of Belgium has served as &quot;Special Envoy of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention or Ottawa Treaty,&quot; to promote the formal prohibition of landmines and the rights of the survivors of said weapons.
* India: During the 2006 democracy movement in Nepal, India sent on April 18 Karan Singh, who is related to royalty in both predominantly Hindu countries, as &quot;Special Envoy&quot; to neighbouring Nepal, where increasingly violent opposition started its successful challenge of the king&#x27;s autocratic rule. Another instance was during the 2009 Copenhagen climate change summit, India appointed senior diplomat Shyam Saran as a special envoy to coordinate the negotiating position of the BASIC countries.
* United Kingdom: Appointed special envoys from time to time.
* European Union: appointed various &quot;special representatives&quot; (some regional, some thematic); e.g., in 2005—as a response to events in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan—the Council of the EU appointed Jan Kubis as its &quot;Special Representative for Central Asia&quot;.
* Pakistan: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif appointed ambassador Javed Malik as Pakistan&#x27;s special envoy for trade and investment based in the GCC Gulf region with a diplomatic rank of an ambassador
* United States: appointed numerous special envoys including a special envoy for Northern Ireland with the diplomatic rank of ambassador to help with the Northern Ireland peace process. Special envoys have also been appointed for Afghanistan, Yemen, Sudan, Syria, Middle East peace, Eurasian energy, climate change, and human rights in North Korea. Other posts include special representative, special advisor, and special coordinator.
* The Secretary-General of the United Nations personally mandates special envoys for a particular field, including:
** United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa
** United Nations Special Envoy on Climate Change
** United Nations Special Envoy for Kosovo
** United Nations Special Envoy for Darfur
** United Nations Special Envoy for Refugees
* The director-general of UNESCO appoints special envoys who can use their talents and renown to further the organization&#x27;s ideals and action. Envoys include:
** Special Envoy for Basic and Higher Education Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser al-Missned of Qatar
** Special Envoy for Water Prince Talal bin Abdulaziz al Saud
** Special Envoy on Literacy for Development Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands
* A &quot;sui generis&quot; case is the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina
* The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a variety of special interest ambassador and envoy positions including the ambassador for counter-terrorism and the ambassador for the environment.
* The Niue Government appoints special envoys to expand Niue&#x27;s presence internationally. Envoys include 
** Special Envoy to Niue for COP26 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference 
** Special Envoy to Niue for the 2022 Japan State Funeral for the former Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe

==Usage worldwide==
Most countries worldwide have some form of internal rank, roughly parallel to the diplomatic ranks, which are used in their foreign service or civil service in general. The correspondence is not exact, however, for various reasons, including the fact that according to diplomatic usage, all Ambassadors are of equal rank, but Ambassadors of more senior rank are typically sent to more important postings. Some countries may make specific links or comparisons to military ranks.

===Australia===
Officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) are graded into four broad bands (BB1 to BB4), with the Senior Executive Service (SES Band 1 to SES Band 3) following above.

Ambassadors, High Commissioners and Consuls-General usually come from the Senior Executive Service, although in smaller posts the head of mission may be a BB4 officer. Generally speaking (and there are variations in ranking and nomenclature between posts and positions), Counsellors are represented by BB4 officers; Consuls and First and Second Secretaries are BB3 officers and Third Secretaries and Vice Consuls are BB2 officers. DFAT only posts a limited number of low-level BB1 staff abroad. In large Australian missions an SES officer who is not the head of mission could be posted with the rank of Minister.

===Brazil===
The Brazilian Foreign Service (&quot;Serviço Exterior Brasileiro&quot;) is made up of three careers: the Diplomat Career, the Chancery Officer Career and the Chancery Assistant Career.

* Assistente de Chancelaria (&quot;Chancery Assistants / Attaché&quot;) are career civil servants with a minimum high-school degree who provide technical and administrative support in Brazil and in Brazilian representations abroad. 
* Oficial de Chancelaria (&quot;Chancery Officers / Attaché&quot;) are career civil servants with a minimum university degree who contribute for the formulation, implementation and execution of acts of technical analysis and administrative management, necessary for the development of Brazilian foreign policy.
* Diplomata (&quot;Diplomat&quot;) are career civil servants responsible for diplomatic and consular activities, in their specific aspects of representation, negotiation, information and protection of Brazilian interests in the international field.
&lt;br&gt;
There are no ranks in the Chancery Assistant or Chancery Officer careers, nor a hierarchy between careers. However, when working abroad, it is common for Chancery Assistants and Chancery Officers to be assigned to sensitive functions, such as the Vice-Consul, and/or as Head of Sectors such as administration, accounting, communications, processing of political, commercial, diplomatic or consular information.

There are six ranks in the Diplomat career, in hierarchical order:
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Third secretary&quot;)
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Second secretary&quot;)
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;First secretary&quot;)
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Counsellor&quot;)
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Minister, second class&quot;)
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Minister, first class&quot;, usually referred to as &#x27;Ambassador&#x27;)
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;&quot; is the honorary dignity conceded permanently when a Minister of First Class assumes a Post overseas. It can also be a temporary assignment, when carried on by a lower-rank diplomat or Brazilian politician of high level.

===China===
The ranks of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People&#x27;s Republic of China are defined by the Law on Diplomatic Personnel Stationed Abroad, passed in 2009 by the National People&#x27;s Congress:
* Attaché (Simplified Chinese: 随员; Pinyin: &quot;suíyuán&quot;)
* Third Secretary (三等秘书; &quot;sānděng mìshū&quot;)
* Second Secretary (二等秘书; &quot;èrděng mìshū&quot;)
* First Secretary (一等秘书; &quot;yīděng mìshū&quot;)
* Counselor (参赞; &quot;cānzàn&quot;)
* Minister (公使; &quot;gōngshǐ&quot;)
* Ambassador (大使; &quot;dàshǐ&quot;)

===Egypt===
The following ranks are used in the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs:

* Diplomatic Attaché
* Third Secretary
* Second Secretary
* First Secretary
* Counselor
* Minister Plenipotentiary
* Ambassador

===France===

There are five ranks in the French Diplomatic Service:
(in ascending order)
* &quot; (&quot;du cadre général&quot; or else &quot;du cadre d&#x27;Orient&quot;)
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;du cadre général&quot; or else &quot;du cadre d&#x27;Orient&quot;)
* &quot;, the most common rank for heads of mission, but it also applies to some ministers-counsellors in important embassies
* &quot;, an honorary dignity

There are two additional ranks for ICT specialists (also in ascending order):
* &quot;

=== Germany ===

The German Foreign Service uses a rank system that is connected to that of the rest of the civil administration and to military ranks through a common pay table. All ranks also occur in female form.

=== Hungary ===
The ranks at the Hungarian Foreign Service are the following.:

* Segédattasé – Assistant Attaché
*Attasé – Attaché
*III. osztályú titkár- Third Secretary
* II. osztályú titkár – Second Secretary
*I. osztályú titkár – First Secretary
*II. osztály tanácsos – Second Counsellor
*I. osztályú tanácsos – First Counsellor
*Rendkívüli követ és meghatalmazott miniszter – Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary
* Nagykövet - Ambassador

=== Italy ===
In Italy, ranks and functions are not exactly connected: each rank can cover several functions. Moreover, several exceptions apply.

* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Secretary of Legation in probation period&quot;): 9-month training period at the beginning of the career (no other functions)
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Secretary of Legation&quot;): second secretary at an embassy, head of vice-consulate, vice-consul
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Counsellor of Legation&quot;): counsellor at an embassy, consul (head of a first-class general consulate)
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Counsellor of Embassy&quot;): first counsellor at an embassy, consul
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Minister Plenipotentiary&quot;): ambassador (as for functions), minister-counsellor at an embassy, head of a Directorate at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Ambassador&quot;): ambassador (thus both as for the rank and for the functions), General Secretary or head of a Directorate at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

There are about 30 people who hold the rank of Ambassador. Therefore, most of the about 150 Italian embassies or permanent representations are held by a Minister Plenipotentiary: traditionally, ambassadors are appointed to the most important representations, such as London, Paris, Washington, New Delhi and Peking embassies and representations to the UN in New York City and the EU in Brussels.

=== Mexico ===
After the merger of the Consular and Diplomatic Corps, the current grades of Mexican career diplomats are (in ascending order)

* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Diplomatic Attaché&quot;): title held during the one-year training program at the Diplomatic School and an internship in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Embassy Secretary, Third Secretary&quot;).
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Embassy Secretary, Second Secretary&quot;).
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Embassy Secretary, First Secretary&quot;).
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Counsellor&quot;).
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Minister&quot;).
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Ambassador&quot;).

There are additional ranks for Administrative specialists and Staff, this civil servants are also part of the Mexican Foreign Service.

* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Administrative Coordinator&quot;)
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Administrative Attache A&quot;).
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Administrative Attache B&quot;).
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Administrative Attache C&quot;).
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Administrative Attache D&quot;).

=== Portugal ===
In ascending order, the five ranks of the Portuguese diplomatic career are, as defined in the Statute of the Diplomatic Career (&quot;Estatuto da Carreira Diplomática&quot;):

* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Embassy Attaché&quot;)
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Embassy Secretary&quot;)
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Embassy Counsellor&quot;)
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Minister Plenipotentiary&quot;)
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Ambassador&quot;)

Ministers Plenipotentiary who have been in that rank for three or more years are called &quot;Minister Plenipotentiary, First Class&quot; (&quot;ministro plenipotenciário de 1.ª classe&quot;), those who have been in the rank for less than three years are called &quot;Minister Plenipotentiary, Second Class&quot; (&quot;ministro plenipotenciário de 2.ª classe&quot;). Embassy Secretaries who have been in that rank for six years or more and in the diplomatic career for eight years or more are called &quot;First Embassy Secretary&quot; (&quot;primeiro-secretário de embaixada&quot;), those who have been in the rank for three years or more and for five years or more in the diplomatic career are called &quot;Second Embassy Secretary&quot; (&quot;segundo-secretário de embaixada&quot;), and those who have been in that rank for less than three years are called &quot;Third Embassy Secretary&quot; (&quot;terceiro-secretário de embaixada&quot;).

=== Russia ===
The diplomatic ranks in Russian Federation were introduced with enactment of the Federal Law of 27 July 2010 No.205-FZ. Diplomatic ranks are not to be confused with diplomatic positions (posts).

=== Singapore ===
The Singapore Foreign Service also has a merged Diplomatic and Consular Corps. 

Its career diplomats and diplomatic support staff are split across two discrete career schemes, namely: (a) Foreign Service Officers; and (b) Foreign Service Administration Specialists. 

Foreign Service Officers (FSOs) 

FSOs are selected through multiple rounds of highly competitive written and observational psychometric and neuropsychological evaluations. Being one of the most exclusive and sought-after roles in the entire Singapore Civil Service, FSO candidates are typically drawn from graduates of the world&#x27;s top universities. This is especially the case for candidates vying to be emplaced on the extremely competitive Political Track, of which only around 20 are recruited nationwide annually. 

Regardless, most candidates who are eventually selected, possess degrees with First Class Honours from the world&#x27;s top fifty universities (e.g. the University of Oxford or the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, many of the Ivy League institutions in the United States, or Singapore&#x27;s two most prestigious universities - the National University of Singapore and the Nanyang Technological University). 

Foreign Service Administration Specialists (FSASes)

FSASes, on the other hand, while still selected through some manner of written and observational assessments, are typically those bearing more conventional educational qualifications. These include graduates from top universities but without &quot;good&quot; honours, or from private and mainstream universities. A large number of FSASes also include Polytechnic graduates (who possess Diplomas).

Given the above, FSOs typically occupy the managerial positions, while FSASes generally perform more operational roles. [Note: FSOs are typically the diplomats, while FSASes serve as support staff.] 

Officials from both schemes occupy billets at both the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as Singapore&#x27;s Overseas Missions (Embassies/High Commissions/Consulates-General/Consulates) - which number over 50.

Rank on Post

FSOs are posted to Singapore&#x27;s overseas missions at the rank of Second Secretary, while FSASes are posted according to their substantive grades (typically ranging from Assistant Mission Support Officer to Attache - although in rare cases some senior FSASes may be promoted up to the rank of Third/Second/First Secretary). [Note: FSOs and FSASes are on discrete career tracks. Hence, even the rare FSAS who holds a senior diplomatic rank on post, will not enjoy a similar substantive grade or pay to that of an FSO.]

Regardless of rank, personnel are typically split across three tracks: (a) Political, (b) Administration and Consular, (c) Administration and Technical. Officers on the Political track take precedence over the rest, as all Heads of Mission (HOMs) or Deputy Chiefs of Mission (DCMs) are generally Political Officers. [Note: The Political track is reserved exclusively for FSOs.]

Other ministries and agencies 

Personnel seconded from other government agencies receive different protocol-based suffixes and titles from those in the Foreign Service, which differ from the wider public and military services&#x27; ranks/grades and titles. For instance, a First Secretary (Economic) would represent a middle-manager of Senior Assistant Director-rank from the Ministry of Trade and Industry. While such persons may hold diplomatic status temporarily, they are not considered to be part of the career Foreign Service.


=== Spain ===

After the merger of the Consular and Diplomatic Corps, the current eight grades of Spanish career diplomats are (in ascending order):
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Trainee Diplomat&quot;): title held during the one-year training program at the Diplomatic School.
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Embassy Secretary, Third Class&quot;) or Secretary.
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Embassy Secretary, Second Class&quot;)
* &quot;&quot;. (&quot;Embassy Secretary, First Class&quot;)
* &#x27; or &#x27;, lowest grade to be appointed Consul-General.
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Minister Plenipotentiary, Third Class&quot;) commonly known as Minister, lowest grade to be appointed Ambassador.
* &quot;&quot;. (&quot;Minister Plenipotentiary, Second Class&quot;)
* &quot;&quot;. (&quot;Minister Plenipotentiary, First Class&quot;)
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Ambassador of Spain&quot;): not all Spanish Ambassadors hold this grade, which is limited by law to 3% of the total Corps.

===United Kingdom===
His Majesty&#x27;s Diplomatic Service differentiates between officers in the &quot;Senior Management Structure&quot; (SMS; equivalent to the Senior Civil Service grades of the Home Civil Service) and those in the &quot;delegated grades&quot;. 
SMS officers are classified into four pay-bands, and will serve in the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in London as (in descending order of seniority) Permanent Under-Secretary (O-10), Directors-General (O-9), Directors (O-8), and Heads of department or deputy directors (O-7).

Overseas Ambassadors and High Commissioners (in Commonwealth countries) are generally drawn from all four SMS bands (and the D7 delegated grade) depending on the size and importance of the mission, as are Consuls-General, Deputy Heads of Mission, and Counsellors in larger posts. (Deputy Heads of Mission at the most significant Embassies, for example those in Washington and in Paris, are known as Ministers.)

In the &quot;delegated grades&quot;, officers are graded by number from 1 to 7; the grades are grouped into bands lettered A‑D (A1 and A2; B3; C4 and C5; and D6 and D7).

Overseas, A2 grade officers hold the title of Attache; B3‑grade officers are Third Secretaries; C4s are Second Secretaries; and C5s and D6s are First Secretaries. D7 officers are usually Counsellors in larger posts, Deputy Heads of Mission in medium-sized posts, or Heads of Mission in small posts.

===United States===
In the United States Foreign Service, the personnel system under which most U.S. diplomatic personnel are assigned, a system of personal ranks is applied which roughly corresponds to these diplomatic ranks. Personal ranks are differentiated as &quot;Senior Foreign Service&quot; (SFS) or &quot;Member of the Foreign Service&quot;. Officers at these ranks may serve as ambassadors and occupy the most senior positions in diplomatic missions. The SFS ranks, in order from highest to lowest, are:
Members of the Foreign Service consist of five groups, including Foreign Service Officers and Foreign Service Specialists. Like officers in the U.S. military, Foreign Service Officers are members of the Foreign Service who are commissioned by the President. Foreign Service Specialists are technical leaders and experts, commissioned by the Secretary of State. Ranks descend from the highest, FS‑01, equivalent to a full Colonel in the military, to FS‑09, the lowest rank in the U.S. Foreign Service personnel system. (Most entry-level Foreign Service members begin at the FS‑05 or FS‑06 level.) Personal rank is distinct from and should not be confused with the diplomatic or consular rank assigned at the time of appointment to a particular diplomatic or consular mission.

In a large mission, several Senior Diplomats may serve under the Ambassador as Minister-Counselors, Counselors, and First Secretaries; in a small mission, a diplomat may serve as the lone Counselor of Embassy.

== Consular counterpart ==
Most countries&#x27; consular corps are composed of career diplomats who are simply posted to Consulates/Consulates-General. In such situations, these career diplomats will hold consular ranks instead (ranking in descending order: consul-general, consul, vice-consul, consular agent; equivalents with consular immunity limited to official acts only include honorary consul-general, honorary consul, and honorary vice-consul. Other titles, including &quot;vice consul-general&quot;, have existed in the past.) – although they are usually also given a diplomatic rank by the country. Consular ranks and responsibilities differ from country to country, and may also be used concurrently with diplomatic titles if the individual is assigned to an embassy. Diplomatic immunity is generally more limited for consular officials without other diplomatic accreditation, and is broadly limited to immunity with respect to their official duties.

While in the past, consular officials have often been more distant from the politically sensitive aspects of diplomacy, this is no longer necessarily the case, and career diplomats in consulates often perform the same roles as those in an embassy would. Some countries also routinely provide their embassy officials with consular commissions, including those without formal consular responsibilities, since a consular commission allows the individual to legalize documents, sign certain documents, and undertake certain other necessary functions.

Depending on the practice of the individual country, &quot;consular services&quot; may be limited to services provided for citizens or residents of the sending country, or extended to include, for example, visa services for nationals of the host country.

Sending nations may also designate incumbents of certain positions as holding consulary authority by virtue of their office, while lacking individual accreditation, immunity and inviolability. For example, 10 U.S.C. §§ 936 and 1044a identify various U.S. military officers (and authorize the service secretaries to identify others) who hold general authority as a notary and consul of the United States for, respectively, purposes of military administration and those entitled to military legal assistance. A nation may also declare that its senior merchant sea captain in a given foreign port—or its merchant sea captains generally—has consulary authority for merchant seamen.

<text>Zolile Hector Pieterson (19 August 1963 – 16 June 1976) was a South African schoolboy who was shot and killed at the age of 12 during the Soweto uprising in 1976, when the police opened fire on black students protesting the enforcement of teaching in Afrikaans, mostly spoken by the white and coloured population in South Africa, as the medium of instruction for all school subjects. The students wanted to learn in their native languages, Xhosa and Zulu. A news photograph by Sam Nzima of the mortally wounded Pieterson being carried by another Soweto resident while his sister ran next to them was published around the world. The anniversary of his death is the designated Youth Day in South Africa.

==Soweto Uprising==

On 16 June 1976, school children protested the implementation of Afrikaans and English as dual medium of instruction in secondary schools in a 50:50 basis. This was implemented throughout South Africa regardless of the locally-spoken language and some exams were also written in Afrikaans. Students gathered to peacefully demonstrate, but the crowd soon became intimidated when the police arrived, and started to throw stones.

The police arrived and fired tear gas into the crowd in order to disperse them. There are conflicting accounts of who gave the first command to shoot, but soon children were turning and running in all directions, leaving some children lying wounded on the road.

Although the media often named as the first child to die that day, another boy, Hastings Ndlovu, was actually the first child to be shot. But in the case of Hastings, there were no photographers on the scene, and his name was not immediately known.

When Pieterson was shot, he fell on the corner of Moema and Vilakazi Streets. He was picked up by Mbuyisa Makhubo who, together with Pieterson&#x27;s sister Antoinette (then 17 years old), ran towards Sam Nzima&#x27;s car. They bundled him in, and journalist Sophie Tema drove him to a nearby clinic where he was pronounced dead. Mbuyisa and Nzima were harassed by the police after the incident and both went into hiding. Mbuyisa&#x27;s mother told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that she received a letter from Mbuyisa in 1978 from Nigeria but she has not heard from him since. Pieterson and Hastings Ndlovu are buried at the Avalon Cemetery, Soweto. Ten people died as well and 250 people were injured.

==Surname==

Since June 1976, Pieterson&#x27;s surname has often appeared in the media as &quot;Peterson&quot; and &quot;Pietersen&quot;, the latter being the spelling engraved on the tombstone. According to the family, the correct spelling is &quot;Pieterson&quot;.

==Lawsuit==
On 9 August 2002 U.S. lawyer Ed Fagan led a $50bn class action suit by apartheid-era victims against international firms and banks who profited from dealings with the Apartheid regime. Among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit was Dorothy Molefi, Pieterson&#x27;s mother. The South African government distanced themselves from the lawsuit. Fagan had filed a string of lawsuits over human-rights issues brought in order to force companies to settle. The cases were thrown out in 2004.

==Memorial and museum==
On 16 June 2002, the Hector Pieterson Museum was opened near the place he was shot in Orlando West, Soweto, to honour Pieterson and those who died around the country in the 1976 uprising. Funded by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (R16 million) and the Johannesburg City Council (R7.2 million), it has become a major tourist attraction. The start of the museum begins with pictures of Pieterson&#x27;s death. The museum fuses memorabilia with modern technology and cultural history. As of 2010, Pieterson&#x27;s sister Antoinette, who is seen in the photograph, works at the museum as a tour guide.

<doc id="1204405" wikidata="Q462662" url="?curid=1204405" title="Raymond Roussel">
<text>Raymond Roussel (; 20 January 1877 – 14 July 1933) was a French poet, novelist, playwright, musician, and chess enthusiast. Through his novels, poems, and plays he exerted a profound influence on certain groups within 20th century French literature, including the Surrealists, Oulipo, and the authors of the nouveau roman.

==Biography==
Roussel was born in Paris, the third and last child in his family, with a brother named Georges and a sister named Germaine. In 1893, at age 15, he was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire for piano. A year later, he inherited a substantial fortune from his deceased father and began to write poetry to accompany his musical compositions. At age 17, he wrote &quot;Mon Âme&quot;, a long poem published three years later in &quot;Le Gaulois&quot;. By 1896, he had commenced editing his long poem &quot;La Doublure&quot; when he suffered a mental crisis. After the poem was published on 10 June 1897 and was completely unsuccessful, Roussel began to see the psychiatrist Pierre Janet. In subsequent years, his inherited fortune allowed him to publish his own works and mount luxurious productions of his plays. He wrote and published some of his most important work between 1900 and 1914, and then from 1920 to 1921 traveled around the world. He continued to write for the next decade, but when his fortune finally gave out, he made his way to a hotel in Palermo, where he died of a barbiturate overdose in 1933, aged 56. He is buried in Père-Lachaise cemetery in Paris.

Roussel&#x27;s most famous works are &quot;New Impressions of Africa&quot; and &quot;Locus Solus&quot;, both written according to formal constraints based on homonymic puns. Roussel kept this compositional method a secret until the publication of his posthumous text, &quot;How I Wrote Certain of My Books&quot;, where he describes it as follows: &quot;I chose two similar words. For example &quot;billard&quot; (billiard) and &quot;pillard&quot; (looter). Then I added to it words similar but taken in two different directions, and I obtained two almost identical sentences thus. The two sentences found, it was a question of writing a tale which can start with the first and finish by the second. Amplifying the process then, I sought new words reporting itself to the word billiards, always to take them in a different direction than that which was presented first of all, and that provided me each time a creation moreover. The process evolved/moved and I was led to take an unspecified sentence, of which I drew from the images by dislocating it, a little as if it had been a question of extracting some from the drawings of rebus.&quot; For example, &quot;Les lettres du blanc sur les bandes du vieux billard/The white letters on the cushions of the old billiard table…&quot; must somehow reach the phrase, &quot;…les lettres du blanc sur les bandes du vieux pillard/letters [written by] a white man about the hordes of the old plunderer.&quot; Although Roussel does state in his posthumous book &quot;How I Wrote Certain of My Novels&quot; that &quot;It goes without saying that this method was nowhere employed in my other works &quot;La Doublure, La Vue&quot; and &quot;Nouvelles Impressions d&#x27;Afrique&quot;&quot;; and here could be added the two plays &quot;L&#x27;étoile au front&quot; and &quot;La Poussière de soleil&quot;.

John Ashbery summarized &quot;Locus Solus&quot; thus in his introduction to Michel Foucault&#x27;s &quot;Death and the Labyrinth&quot;: &quot;A prominent scientist and inventor, Martial Canterel, has invited a group of colleagues to visit the park of his country estate, Locus Solus. As the group tours the estate, Canterel shows them inventions of ever-increasing complexity and strangeness. Again, exposition is invariably followed by explanation, the cold hysteria of the former giving way to the innumerable ramifications of the latter. After an aerial pile driver which is constructing a mosaic of teeth and a huge glass diamond filled with water in which float a dancing girl, a hairless cat, and the preserved head of Danton, we come to the central and longest passage: a description of eight curious tableaux vivants taking place inside an enormous glass cage. We learn that the actors are actually dead people whom Canterel has revived with &#x27;resurrectine,&#x27; a fluid of his invention which if injected into a fresh corpse causes it continually to act out the most important incident of its life.&quot;

&quot;New Impressions of Africa&quot; is a 1,274-line poem, consisting of four long cantos in rhymed alexandrines, each a single sentence with parenthetical asides that run up to five levels deep. From time to time, a footnote refers to a further poem containing its own depths of brackets.
This impressive nest of brackets carries an assertion — or a recommendation ? — buried by Roussel within a 644 alexandrine poem. In &quot;A study on Raymond Roussel&quot;, Jean Ferry suggested the notion of a hidden message and transcribed the succession of brackets of Cantos II into the alphabet invented by the painter Samuel Morse : considering each bracket as a dot and the included text as a dash. But due to the missing spaces which separate letters the ensemble of dots and dashes as well as a concealed message remained an hypothesis... until it was deciphered by Jean-Max Albert (another painter), revealing (at least partially) the rousselienne formula, which can&#x27;t be fortuitous : « RELIVE YOUR DREAMS AWAKE » ( Revis tes rêves en éveil).

==Criticism and legacy==
Perhaps not surprisingly, Roussel was unpopular during his life and critical reception of his works was almost unanimously negative. Nevertheless, he was admired by the Surrealist group and other avant-garde writers, particularly Michel Leiris, André Breton, and Marcel Duchamp.

He began to be rediscovered in the late 1950s by the Oulipo and Alain Robbe-Grillet. His most direct influence in the Anglophonic world was on the New York School of poets; John Ashbery, Harry Mathews, James Schuyler and Kenneth Koch briefly edited a magazine called &quot;Locus Solus&quot; after his novel. French theorist Michel Foucault&#x27;s only book-length work of literary criticism is on Roussel.

French philosopher Gilles Deleuze uses Raymond Roussel&#x27;s works as one of many examples of &quot;repetition&quot; in his 1968 work &quot;Difference and Repetition&quot;.

A comprehensive exhibition of Roussel&#x27;s achievements entitled &quot;Locus Solus&quot; was exhibited within the Fundação de Serralves in Porto opening on 24 March 2012. Special attention was granted to his personal connections with Man Ray, Salvador Dalí and Marcel Duchamp, who observed that Roussel was &quot;he who pointed the way&quot;. Indeed, Duchamp claims in his writings &quot;The Trouble with Great Art&quot; that “it was fundamentally Roussel who was responsible for my large glass The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even”.

References to &quot;New Impressions of Africa&quot; are central to the science-fiction novel &quot;The Embedding&quot; by Ian Watson (winner of the Prix Apollo in 1975). Roussel (or a version of him) is a major character in the novel &quot;The Vorrh&quot; by B. Catling.

In 2016, The Raymond Roussel Society was founded in New York by John Ashbery, Michel Butor, Joan Bofill-Amargós, Miquel Barceló, Thor Halvorssen and Hermes Salceda.

<doc id="1204411" wikidata="Q2892622" url="?curid=1204411" title="Oliver Lyttelton, 1st Viscount Chandos">
<text>Oliver Lyttelton, 1st Viscount Chandos (15 March 1893 – 21 January 1972) was a British businessman from the Lyttelton family who was brought into government during the Second World War, holding a number of ministerial posts.

==Background, education and military career==
Born in Mayfair, London, Lord Chandos was the son of the Rt. Hon. Alfred Lyttelton, younger son of George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton. His mother was his father&#x27;s second wife Edith, daughter of Archibald Balfour. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. He served in the Grenadier Guards in the First World War, where he met Winston Churchill, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and Military Cross. The citation for his MC appeared in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; in October 1916 and reads as follows:

From 1947 to 1955 he served as the first President of Farnborough Bowling Club, Hampshire, in his Aldershot parliamentary constituency.

==Business career==
According to the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;:
In August 1920 Lyttelton was invited to join the British Metal Corporation, a firm established at the instigation of the British government with the long-term strategic objective of undermining Germany&#x27;s domination of the metal trade and making the British Empire self-supporting in non-ferrous metals. After a brief apprenticeship Lyttelton served as general manager of the corporation and subsequently as managing director. He also became chairman of the London Tin Corporation and joined the boards of a number of foreign companies, including that of the German firm Metallgesellschaft. He became one of a small group of individuals who through their multiple, interlocking directorships, effectively controlled the global metal trade. . . . On the outbreak of war in September 1939 he was appointed controller of non-ferrous metals. He set about exploiting his extensive network of personal contacts and his intimate knowledge of the mining industry in order to secure for Britain vital supplies of metals at highly advantageous rates. His unconventional methods caused some anxiety at the Treasury, but over the course of the war they saved Britain a substantial amount of money.
After the Conservative Party left office in 1945, Lyttelton became the chairman of Associated Electrical Industries.

==Political career==
Chandos entered Parliament as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Aldershot in a wartime by-election in 1940 and was sworn of the Privy Council the same year. He entered Winston Churchill&#x27;s war coalition as President of the Board of Trade in 1940, a post he held until 1941, and then served as Minister-Resident for the Middle East from 1941 to 1942, and as Minister of Production from 1942 to 1945. He was again President of the Board of Trade in Churchill&#x27;s brief 1945 caretaker government. After the Conservatives&#x27; 1951 election victory, he was considered for the job of Chancellor of the Exchequer. He fully expected the job, but was seen as too linked to business and the City of London, so it was given to Rab Butler. Instead he became Secretary of State for the Colonies, a position which he held until 1954. The latter year he was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Chandos, of Aldershot in the County of Southampton.

Lyttelton was strongly anti-communist and in 1953 said &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Government are not prepared to tolerate the setting up of Communist states in the British Commonwealth&quot;.

During the 1963 Conservative Party leadership contest, Lyttelton favoured Rab Butler, but he no longer carried much influence in the party.

==Family home==
In 1948, the 5th Earl Nelson sold Trafalgar Park, Wiltshire, to John Osborne, 11th Duke of Leeds, whose brother-in-law Oliver Lyttelton, 1st Viscount Chandos, lived there while he was an MP. Eventually Lyttleton bought the estate and lived there until 1971, when Jeremy Pinckney bought the house.

==Later career==
After ending his career as an MP, Chandos returned to Associated Electrical Industries, and steered it to become a major British company. In 1961 he was invited to deliver the MacMillan Memorial Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. He chose the subject &quot;Jungle – or Cloister? – Some Thoughts on the Present Industrial Scene&quot;.

===National Theatre===
In 1962, Chandos became the first chairman of the National Theatre, serving until 1971. He then served as president until his death. His parents had been active campaigners for its development, and the Lyttelton Theatre, part of the National&#x27;s South Bank complex, was named after him.

During Laurence Olivier&#x27;s tenure as director of the National, Chandos was a central figure in the controversy over a proposed production of Rolf Hochhuth&#x27;s &quot;Soldiers&quot;. The production had been championed by Olivier&#x27;s dramaturg, Kenneth Tynan. Though Olivier, a great admirer of Winston Churchill (who essentially is accused of assassinating Polish Prime Minister General Władysław Sikorski by Hochhuth) did not particularly like the play or its depiction of Churchill (whom Tynan wanted him to play), he backed his dramaturg. There was a potential problem with the Lord Chamberlain, who might not have licensed the play due to its controversial stand on Churchill. The National&#x27;s board vetoed the production and Lord Chandos damned the play as a &quot;grotesque and grievous libel&quot;.

===Order of the Garter===
In 1970 he was made a Knight Companion of the Garter. His Garter banner, which hung in St George&#x27;s Chapel in Windsor Castle during his lifetime, is now on display in the Church of St John the Baptist, Hagley.

==Marriage and children==
Lord Chandos married Lady Moira Godolphin Osborne, a daughter of George Osborne, 10th Duke of Leeds on 30 January 1920. They had three sons and one daughter:

* Antony Alfred Lyttelton, 2nd Viscount Chandos (born 23 October 1920, died 28 November 1980)
* The Hon Rosemary Lyttelton (born 30 May 1922, died 21 October 2003), married Anthony Chaplin, 3rd Viscount Chaplin in 1951.
* Lieutenant Julian Lyttelton (born 30 August 1923, killed in action in Italy on 11 October 1944 during World War II
* The Hon Nicholas Adrian Oliver Lyttelton (born 26 March 1937)

Lord Chandos died in Marylebone, London, in January 1972, aged 78, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Antony. Lady Chandos died in May 1976, aged 84.

<doc id="1204412" wikidata="Q1392666" url="?curid=1204412" title="Train stop">
<text>Part of a railway signalling system, a train stop, trip stop or tripcock (sometimes called a tripper) is a train protection device that automatically stops a train if it attempts to pass a signal when the signal aspect and operating rules prohibit such movement, or (in some applications) if it attempts to pass at an excessive speed.

== Basic operation ==
The train stop system comprises two basic components. One is the trip arm mechanism, mounted on the ground adjacent to the rail, which essentially consists of a spring-loaded arm connected to an electric motor (or pneumatic cylinder in electro-pneumatic systems). The other is the train-mounted trip cock, which is connected either directly or electrically to the train&#x27;s braking system.

The trip arm is raised automatically whenever a train should be brought to a halt. When the signalling system determines it is safe for the train to proceed, the motor drives the trip arm down to the lowered position. The spring ensures that the trip arm is raised in all other situations, which is an essential fail-safe provision in case of failure of the electric or pneumatic power supply or of the motor driving the trip arm. If a train attempts to pass the signal with the trip arm in the raised position, the trip arm makes mechanical contact with the trip cock on the train, causing the train&#x27;s brakes to be automatically applied, thereby bringing the train to a halt.

Wayside trip arms are adjusted so that they rise to a point approximately above the top of the running rail when in the stop position, and lower to approximately below the top of the running rail when clear. The time taken for the arm to rise or be lowered is approximately two seconds.

=== Restrictions ===
The mechanical train stops have been found to be relatively safe with their historic models from the 19th century to be still in use in the 21st century. Because of the quadratic force increments in relation to speed these mechanical systems are restricted to low speed applications. Their continued usage can be found in urban rapid transit systems with trains making no more than . Whereas later contactless train stops require a working receiver on the train to initiate the emergency stop (as for PCCS or Indusi) the mechanical stops have initially been kicking the brakes directly.

Because the trip arm may hit the brake lever directly, there have been installations where every wagon of a train has a separate trip cock on each bogie that has brakes. Hence in some installations the trip arm will be folded back to the safe position only a few seconds after a signal has turned red in order to reduce wear (which is an actual security risk as shown in the 1995 Russell Hill subway accident). Because of wear the trip arms for the opposite direction on the same rail will be actuated along with the trip arm for the nominal direction.

Like many early systems a mechanical train stop does not inherently control speed. There were accidents where trains had overrun the overlap due to excessive speed. In order to externally control the speed of a train the operation of timed train stops has been deployed as it is widely used on the New York City Subway, where a second trip arm at a distance is folded down only a few seconds after a train has passed a check point. These expensive speed control systems are generally phased out in favour of a cab control computer that can continuously check a braking curve while approaching a signal.

==Types of train stops==
There are three types of train stops:
*Trip stop - stops train trying to pass red signal
*Timed train stop - stops train moving too fast
*Fixed train stop - prevents any trains from passing a point

===Trip stops===

The trip arm is raised whenever the signal is not displaying a proceed aspect. If a train tries to pass the signal, the trip cock on the train strikes the raised trip arm and the train is brought to a halt. When the signal indicates it is safe to proceed &quot;(clear or caution)&quot;, the trip arm is lowered, and a train is able to proceed without further hindrance. In some cases, the trip arm will not be lowered when the signal to which it applies is exhibiting a proceed indication, e.g. when subsidiary signals are cleared, forcing a train to trip before proceeding, thus ensuring that movements are conducted at safe speeds.

===Timed train stops===
With a timed train stop, the trip arm stays raised until the approaching train has a track circuit on the approach for a period of time corresponding to a set speed. If the train approaches at a speed higher than the one that is set, the trip arm remains raised and trips the train to a stop. If the train approaches at a speed equal to or lower than the set speed, the trip arm lowers before the train arrives, and the train is able to proceed without further hindrance.

Some timed train stops require the driver to acknowledge a stimulus before the trip arm is lowered on a yellow signal.

For sections of track with lower speed limits () a simpler construction is also used. The trip arm rotates freely on a horizontal axis with a counterbalance attached to its lower end. If a train&#x27;s speed is low, the arm will be rotated by the trip cock with a force insufficient to initiate braking. But if its speed is too high, force will be large due to the counterbalance inertia, causing the brakes to be applied.

=== Fixed train stops ===
With fixed train stops, the trip arm cannot be lowered. Fixed stops are positioned close to the end of a dead-end track, to stop a train before it runs out of track. They may also be used at the end of track sections beyond which certain trains should not pass, such as the end of electrified territory (e.g. Hamilton, NSW), or to test the automatic brake and tripgear of trains departing certain locations, e.g. storage sidings, near buffer stops.

A fixed train stop that is the last one on a running line in the reverse direction may, despite its name, be suppressed, as is the case with the associated &quot;Fixed Signals&quot; on the Sydney network. Suppression is needed because in Sydney, the rear trip cock on a train is always lowered, while in Melbourne, by contrast, suppression is not required because the trip cock at the rear of a train is always raised clear of any wayside trip arm.

Some railways and rail transit agencies use fixed train stops to protect workers in work zones by temporarily applying them at either end of the zone, preventing trains from incorrectly entering the work zone.

==Installations==
In 1901, Union Switch and Signal Company developed the first automatic train stop system for the Boston Elevated Railway. This system was soon adopted by the New York City Subway and other transit systems in the United States. Similar systems were installed around this time on the London Underground system.

Because of its mechanical nature, the train stop has certain limitations in application. Severe snow and ice conditions, for example, could interfere with operation of the wayside trip arm. Its widest application, therefore, is on underground rapid transit lines, where conditions that might interfere with proper operation are readily controlled. It is also not suitable for high-speed operation, as the maximum speeds permitted often do not exceed 115 km/h (61 mph), citing risk of high impact forces breaking the arms.

Train stops on London Underground lines are gradually being phased out in favour of ATP and distance-to-go signalling. Train stops remain standard equipment on all Sydney Trains metropolitan passenger lines in New South Wales, and on the electrified suburban railway system in Melbourne, Australia.

The Train stops at the Berlin S-Bahn were first installed in the late 1920s. They are named &quot;&quot; (or ) because of their testing and first installation on the Stettin Railway to the suburban town of Bernau. This was the first heavy rail rapid transit system with third-rail electrification in Germany. They are being phased out in favour of the ZBS system based on Eurobalises until 2025.

=== Trackside installation ===
* Berlin S-Bahn rapid transit uses a metal bar as the trip arm, positioned at the height of the first bogie, on which the trip cock is placed. The metal bar (also named &quot;Streckenanschlag&quot; / track stop collar) folds away to allow passing. It is being replaced by ZBS until 2025. 
* Berlin U-Bahn small profile underground railway used a metal stick as a trip arm, which hung over the track horizontally like a semaphore signal. The trip cock was on the roof of the first wagon (near the first door) almost looking like a lightning rod. The system was phased out in the 1960s (West), respectively 1990s (East) and replaced by an inductive train stop system.
* Berlin U-Bahn large profile underground railway used a mushroom-shaped swivel next to the right rail as a trip arm. The trip cock was mounted on the first bogie. This system was replaced likewise.
* London Underground uses a square-shaped metal plate that functions similarly to that on the New York City Subway system.
* Several lines on the Moscow Metro use a semi-circle that rotates into position when signals are red. All of them are on the right side of tracks as trains&#x27; trip cocks are fitted on the right side. 
* New York City Subway uses a T-shaped metal bar rising from the floor as a trip arm; on the right side of the track for the A Division (numbered trains) and left side for the B Division (lettered trains). To allow trains to proceed it pivots down. A trip cock is mounted on the corner of the truck (bogie) of each car. The placement of the trip cock depends on the division the train runs on; some rolling stock is equipped with a trip cock on both sides. The train stop can be identified on the tracks because they are painted yellow for evidence if it has ever tripped a train.
* Sydney now uses the London Underground type J trip arm called the JA, except that it is mirror-image mounted on the left hand side of the track instead of the right hand side. A nearly identical system is used in Wellington.
* Toronto Subway also uses a T-shaped metal bar that rises from the floor except it is always on the right side of the track for all rolling stock because the trip cock is placed on the right side for all rolling stock.

== Reverse direction ==
When trains operate in the reverse direction, they may &quot;back trip&quot; on train stops applying to the normal direction, which is a nuisance. This may be avoided in one of three ways:
#In Melbourne the rear trip cock is raised, although this runs the risk of runaways from terminal stations at high elevations.
#In Sydney, the rear trip is always lowered, and trip arms in the opposite direction are &quot;suppressed&quot; so that they do not engage the rear trip cock. Trip cocks on intermediate cars, if any, are always raised.
#In New York, when the signalling system clears motion in one direction (on bi-directional track or through an interlocking), it will automatically drive the trip arms which apply to the other direction. This is necessary because trip cocks are located along the entire length of trains in New York, not just the lead car.

On the London Underground there are many train stops on the Piccadilly line facing the opposite direction of travel. This is because they protect engineer&#x27;s trains that often travel in opposite direction during engineering works.

== Proving ==
The mechanical trip arm is proved in the lowered position before the red light of its associated signal is extinguished. The trip arm is proved in the raised position before the track circuit following that signal is indicated as unoccupied. The proving switch detects the actual arm of the train stop, and breakage of that arm centres the switch neither depressed nor normal thus alerting operators to its failure.

== Tripping past, and accidents ==
When the signalling fails, etc., it may be necessary to &quot;trip past&quot; a train stop in the danger position, in accordance with the rules. With the train now working &quot;on sight&quot; it is important to travel at a low speed. If low speed is not maintained, then accidents can occur, such as
* Roseville collision, 1950
* Berala train collision, 1952
* Glenbrook rail accident, 1999

== Depiction ==

The car chase scene in the motion picture &quot;The French Connection&quot; shows a train stop being struck by a New York City elevated subway train as it approaches the train ahead of it on the same track. Although the moving train hits the train stop and begins to slow down, for the purposes of the film sequence, it was supposedly traveling too fast to reach a full stop before colliding with the train ahead.

<doc id="1204416" wikidata="Q7241138" url="?curid=1204416" title="President's Commission on the HIV Epidemic">
<text>The President&#x27;s Commission on the HIV Epidemic was a commission formed by President Ronald Reagan in 1987 to investigate the AIDS pandemic. It is also known as the Watkins Commission for James D. Watkins, its chairman when the commission issued its final report in 1988.

== Organization ==
President Reagan issued creating the President&#x27;s Commission on the HIV Epidemic on June 24, 1987. On June 26, he appointed Dr. W. Eugene Mayberry, CEO of the Mayo Clinic, to chair the commission. Jeff Levi, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force objected to the appointment of someone with no experience with the disease, but others praised Mayberry&#x27;s experience in both medical research and clinical services. Administration officials said it would resist pressure from gay rights activists to include a representative of the gay community on the commission. Gary Bauer, the assistant to the President for policy development who would soon become head of the Family Research Council, said: &quot;I would be very surprised if an administration opposed to making appointments on the basis of race or sex would agree to make an appointment based on bedroom habits&quot;. The commission was charged with producing a preliminary report in 3 months and a final report within a year.

The president named the other commission members on July 23. Saying AIDS needed to go &quot;the way of smallpox and polio&quot;, President Reagan announced the appointments at the commission&#x27;s first meeting. They included:
* Dr. Colleen Conway-Welch, dean of nursing at Vanderbilt University
* John J. Creedon, CEO of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company
* Dr. Theresa L. Crenshaw, a sex educator and opponent of condoms as a means of preventing the spread of HIV
* Richard M. DeVos, president of Amway
* Dr. Burton J. Lee III, a physician at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
* Dr. Frank Lilly, a geneticist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Lilly had served on the board of the Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis (GMHC) from 1984 to 1986. He was &quot;one of the first openly gay Presidential appointees&quot;. 
* Dr. Woodrow A. Myers Jr., an African American and the health commissioner of Indiana and president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers; named vice-chairman by Mayberry.
* Cardinal John O&#x27;Connor
* Penny Pullen, an Illinois legislator and advocate of mandatory premarital HIV testing and later founder of the Illinois Family Institute
* Corinna &quot;Cory&quot; SerVaas, editor of the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;
* Dr. William B. Walsh, president of Project HOPE, a medical relief organization
* James D. Watkins, a retired admiral

At the commission&#x27;s first meeting, Lilly and O&#x27;Connor, seated side by side, &quot;chatted cordially&quot;, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported. When the meeting ended, reporters and television cameras surrounded Lilly leaving him, he said, &quot;shell-shocked&quot; and &quot;scared to death&quot;. Senator Gordon Humphrey, a New Hampshire Republican, attacked Lilly&#x27;s appointment, said the President &quot;should strive at all costs to avoid sending the message to society—especially to impressionable youth—that homosexuality is simply an alternative lifestyle&quot; and said the President should have named heterosexual experts to the commission.

The commission planned visits to review activities in several localities, beginning with a two-day visit to New York City by 5 commissioners in August/September. They visited hospitals and met with volunteers, health-care providers, and representatives of gay organizations.

The commission&#x27;s executive director was forced to resign in September &quot;after a power struggle and allegations of inadequate performance,&quot; wrote the &quot;New York Times&quot;, in which Mayberry yielded to the demands of some members of the commission for better staff support than they felt they were receiving. Lee said: &quot;For whatever reason, lack of staff or whatever, things just weren&#x27;t happening. With Gene Mayberry out in Rochester, Minnesota, most of the time, the commission felt we had to get a really good, high-powered, full-time person&quot; to manage the commission staff. On October 7, Mayberry and Myers quit, as did the commission&#x27;s senior staff adviser for medical and research affairs, Dr. Franklin Cockerill 3d, a Mayo Clinic physician specializing in AIDS. Lilly said he was considering resigning but would wait to see who replaced the chairman and vice-chairman. The administration immediately announced the appointment of James D. Watkins, a retired admiral who had been Chief of Naval Operations. The &quot;New York Times&quot; said Mayberry had been &quot;viewed as a moderating influence on the views of other members who are considered more ideological in their approach&quot; and that &quot;[b]y virtually all accounts, the commission has got off to a slow start in recruiting staff and organizing for its task.&quot; Myers said that &quot;The personalities are intense&quot; and that &quot;I don&#x27;t feel the commission as currently constituted would be effective.&quot; Comments from those familiar with the commission and its responsibilities expressed dismay at the resignations. Richard Dunne, executive secretary of GMHC, said: &quot;The AIDS epidemic is out of control, and it seems, so is the Presidential Commission on AIDS.&quot; On October 9, DeVos said that the president needed to avoid naming commissioners who were &quot;emotionally&quot; involved in the commission&#x27;s work and that, in one newspaper&#x27;s account of his statement, &quot;some homosexuals want to &#x27;capture the agenda&#x27;&quot;.

Years later, Watkins&#x27; wife reported that Watkins told Reagan &quot;I&#x27;m a sailor and a submariner, and I know nothing about medicine&quot;, and that Reagan replied: &quot;You&#x27;re exactly who we&#x27;re looking for.&quot; On October 11, Watkins announced plans to move quickly with reorganizing the commission staff. Noting that he was speaking to reporters on the day of a political march and rally in Washington, he said, &quot;We have in Washington today one of the largest gay rights activist demonstrations that we have had—we are sensitive to them as human beings and to their issues&quot;. He continued: &quot;We haven&#x27;t done the job to date, I am sorry to say, but I feel comfortable and the other members of the commission feel comfortable that I can take it and mold them together and bring all of our prima donnas, including me, into a nice, neat, unified package.&quot; He named a new executive director on October 13.

Without Bauer&#x27;s approval, Watkins later added two commission members who had track records as critics of the Reagan administration: Kristine Gebbie, Oregon public health commissioner and president of the AIDS Task Force of the American Society of State and Territorial Health Officers and Dr. Benny J. Primm, director of a New York City treatment program for addicts. Primm was the only African American on the commission and the only one with expertise on the intravenous drug use. Of the challenge of heading the commission, Watkins later said: &quot;I really wasn&#x27;t sure I could pull it out of the swamp.&quot;

==Reports==
In February 1988, the commission released an interim report focused on IV drugs that called for a $20-billion, 10-year effort to fight AIDS. Watkins described it as &quot;only seven-tenths of a percent of the defense budget.&quot; William B. Rubenstein, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) who earlier sued the commission anticipating that its membership would bias its findings, found Watkins&#x27; work &quot;a pleasant surprise&quot;.

On June 2, 1988, Watkins described the commission&#x27;s draft report and called for state and federal laws to provide anti-discrimination protection for AIDS patients. He called that discrimination &quot;the rule, not the exception.&quot; He explained that testing and the identification of sexual partners could not be successful without such protections against discrimination: &quot;So, once those with HIV are treated like anyone else with a disability, then we will find that what is best for the individual is also best for the public health.&quot; He said &quot;Semen, blood, and ignorance surround this epidemic, and we were in that last category&quot; when starting work.

In an initial review, Dr. Mathilde Krim, founder of the American Foundation for AIDS Research thought the commission&#x27;s work both more expert than she expected and free of ideology. Tim Sweeney, executive director of GMHC call the draft report &quot;courageous, aggressive and compassionate&quot; and added: &quot;We challenge the President, Congress and presidential candidates to respond to this report by implementing its recommendations&quot;. The American Public Health Association called it &quot;an aggressive first step towards developing an integrated national strategy to deal with the AIDS epidemic.&quot;

The commission produced its final report on June 24, 1988. The commissioners approved it by a vote of 7 to 6. Its recommendations surprised observers by arguing against every measure advocated by conservative observers, such as mandatory testing, and characterizing partner notification as an inappropriate activity for medical professionals. Its principal findings and recommendations were designed to provide a national strategy for managing the epidemic. It made more than 500 recommendations, which it summarized under these headings:

# replacement of the obsolete term &quot;AIDS&quot; (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) with the term &quot;HIV infection&quot;;
# early diagnosis of HIV infection;
# increased testing to facilitate understanding of the incidence and prevalence of HIV infection;
# treatment of HIV infection as a disability under federal and state law;
# stronger legal protection of the privacy of HIV-infected persons;
# immediate implementation of preventive measures such as confidential partner notification;
# prevention and treatment of intravenous drug abuse;
# implementation of drug and alcohol abuse education programs;
# establishment of federal and state scholarship and loan programs to encourage nurses to serve in areas of high HIV impact;
# extension and expansion of the National Health Service Corps;
# aggressive biomedical research;
# more equitable and cost-effective financing of care for HIV-infected persons;
# addressing the concerns of health care workers;
# federal assurance of the safety of the blood supply;
# undertaking all reasonable efforts to avoid transfusion of another person&#x27;s blood;
# development and implementation of education programs;
# addressing the problem of HIV-infected &quot;border babies&quot;;
# addressing the problem of high-risk adolescents;
# addressing ethical issues raised by the HIV epidemic; and
# support and encouragement of international efforts to combat the spread of HIV infection.

Vice President George Bush, who was running for president at the time, immediately endorsed both an executive order and legislation to meet the commission&#x27;s call for the extension of Federal anti-discrimination protection to those with AIDS and those who test positive for HIV. He emphasized children in his discussions with reporters: &quot;My conscience has been advising me on AIDS... I&#x27;d hate it if a kid of mine got a blood transfusion and my grandson had AIDS and the community discriminated against that child, that innocent child&quot;. Reagan said his drug policy advisor would review the report and make recommendations to him in 30 days. President Reagan later said he opposed such discrimination in principle but took no action before his term as president ended in January 1989. The administration took small steps. It acted to inform recipients of blood transfusions that they were at risk, made plans to speed FDA drug approvals, and developed proposals to add facilities for the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health.

Dr. Anthony Fauci later described the significance of Watkins&#x27; military background to the debate over the nation&#x27;s response to AIDS: &quot;To have a presidential commission chairman with his background to come out so strongly against stigma and discrimination was a very, very important step&quot;. Randy Shilts called the report &quot;a sweeping battle plan... AIDS was war, Watkins reasoned, and in a war &quot;somebody must be in charge&quot;; that&#x27;s how you &quot;get things done&quot;.&quot;

Congress passed legislation sponsored by Representative Roy Rowland, a Georgia Democrat and the only physician in Congress, that created the National Commission on AIDS. The legislation specified that commission&#x27;s members must be &quot;individuals with experience and/or expertise pertinent to the AIDS epidemic&quot;. It produced several reports over the next 4 years.

<text>HMS &quot;Kite&quot; (U87) was a Modified sloop of the Royal Navy, once commanded by the famous U-boat hunter Captain Frederic John Walker. She was one of several ships of that class that took part in the famous &quot;six in one trip&quot; in 1944 (in which six U-boats were sunk in one patrol).

Named after the bird of the same name, she was built at Cammell Laird shipyard, Birkenhead, on the banks of the river Mersey (she was to later to be based across the river in Gladstone Dock, Bootle). She was launched on 13 October 1942 and commissioned on 1 March 1943.

==Operational Service==
&quot;Kite&quot; took part in the sinking of five U-boats together with several sister ships:

* On 24 June 1943 was sunk near Cape Ortegal, Spain by the sloops , , &quot;Kite&quot; and .
* On 30 July 1943 was sunk in the Bay of Biscay by a Handley-Page Halifax aircraft and &quot;Wren&quot;, &quot;Kite&quot;, &quot;Woodpecker&quot;, &quot;Wild Goose&quot; and .
* On 30 July 1943 was sunk near Cape Ortegal by &quot;Kite&quot;, &quot;Woodpecker&quot;, &quot;Wren&quot; and &quot;Wild Goose&quot;.
* On 6 November 1943 was sunk east of Newfoundland by , &quot;Woodcock&quot; and &quot;Kite&quot;.
* On 9 February 1944 was sunk south-west of Ireland by &quot;Kite&quot;, and &quot;Starling&quot;.

On 20 August 1944 &quot;Kite&quot; was escorting the aircraft carriers and , which in turn were escorting convoy JW 59 to Northern Russia when the convoy was sighted in the Barents Sea by German aircraft. Soon a pack of U-boats attacked the convoy and one U-boat was sunk by Fairey Swordfish aircraft from one of the carriers. Two more were sunk by other destroyers.

At 06:30 on 21 August, &quot;Kite&quot; slowed to to untangle her &quot;foxers&quot; (anti acoustic torpedo noise makers, towed astern). The decision to do so, rather than severing the foxers&#x27; cables and abandoning them, was made by her temporary commander, Lt Cdr Campbell, a submariner. At that speed &quot;Kite&quot; was a sitting duck, and she was hit by two torpedoes from (commanded by Oberleutnant Ulrich Pietsch) and sank.

Of &quot;Kite&quot;″s crew of 10 officers and 207 ratings, 60 survived the attack, but from the freezing Arctic water only 14 sailors were picked up alive by . Five of the rescued died on board &quot;Keppel&quot; leaving only nine to make it to shore.
&quot;U-344&quot; was sunk the next day by a single patrolling Swordfish from &quot;Vindex&quot;, piloted by Gordon Bennett, which dropped out of the cloud, surprising the U-boat on the surface, a single depth charge exploded beneath the U-boat, sinking her with all hands.

==Six in One==
The U-boats sunk in the 6 in 1 patrol were as follows:
 - 31 January (Type VIIC)
 - 8 February (Type VIIC)
 - 9 February (Type VIIC)
 - 9 February (Type VIIC)
 - 11 February (Type VIIC)
 - 19 February (Type VIIC)

==HMS &quot;Kite&quot; Memorial==
On 21 August 2004, the 60th anniversary of &quot;Kite&quot;″s sinking a memorial stone was unveiled in the Braintree and Bocking Public Gardens.

<doc id="1204419" wikidata="Q7241411" url="?curid=1204419" title="Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS">
<text>The Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS (PACHA) advises the White House and the Secretary of Health and Human Services on the US government&#x27;s response to the AIDS epidemic. The commission was formed by President Bill Clinton in 1995 and each president since has renewed the council&#x27;s charter.

== History ==
The Council was not the first presidential inquiry into HIV. In 1987, Ronald Reagan appointed the President&#x27;s Commission on the HIV Epidemic (1987–88) to investigate the AIDS epidemic. This was followed by the National Commission on AIDS (1989–1993).

Six members resigned in protest of President Donald Trump&#x27;s health policies in June 2017, and the remaining ten members were dismissed by Trump on 28 December 2017. While PACHA did not meet in 2018, it was restaffed in 2019 and reconvened in March, June, and October 2019.

== Members ==
=== Current members ===
On Dec. 11, 2018, Secretary Alex Azar of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services nominated Carl Schmid and John Weisman to serve as PACHA co-chairs when the council reconvened on March 14–15, 2019. Schmid is deputy executive director of The AIDS Institute, and a longtime leader and activist on HIV issues. Weisman is the secretary of health for Washington state and past president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers.

The current PACHA members are:

== Criticism ==

Critics have said they lack confidence in PACHA and note that the council as reorganized under President Bush held only two meetings in 2002 and issued only five recommendations to the White House. By comparison, the President&#x27;s Commission on the HIV Epidemic (Watkins Commission) submitted 597 recommendations to the Reagan Administration.

The Union of Concerned Scientists released a report in February 2004 entitled Scientific Integrity in Policymaking that said that President Bush intentionally appointed under-qualified individuals to PACHA as part of a broader effort to manipulate the government&#x27;s scientific advisory system by providing the appearance of expert advice while controlling the advice given.

Critics pointed to the appointment of Dr. Joseph McIlhaney, a Texas-based doctor known for rejecting the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases and for his advocacy of abstinence-only programs despite negligible evidence that they reduce pregnancy rates among young people.

Six members of the committee resigned in June 2017, citing as the reason that the president, &quot;has no strategy to address the ongoing HIV/AIDS epidemic, seeks zero input from experts to formulate HIV policy, and—most concerning—pushes legislation that will harm people living with HIV and halt or reverse important gains made in the fight against this disease&quot;.
In December 2017 Trump dismissed all the remaining 16 members.
Gabriel Maldonado, a former member of PACHA, said in a Washington Post article &quot;Like any administration, they want their own people there,&quot; identifying &quot;ideological and philosophical differences&quot; and that many of the remaining members, including her, were appointed by former president Barack Obama. &quot;I was co-chair of the disparities committee,&quot; Maldonado added, &quot;so much of my advocacy and policy references surrounded vulnerable populations, addressing issuing of diverse communities, specifically looking at the impacts of the LGBT community, namely, the disproportionate impact of HIV and AIDS to people of color, gay men, transgender women...and a lot of those key vulnerable populations are not being prioritized in this administration.&quot;
Newsweek stated that there were fears that &quot;the charter for PACHA will be re-written with renewed focus on abstinence and religious, non-evidence based public health approaches.&quot;

<text>Neath Rugby Football Club () is a Welsh rugby union club which plays in the Indigo Premiership for Season 2024/25. The club&#x27;s home ground is The Gnoll, Neath. The team is known as the All Blacks because of the team colours: black with only a white cross pattée as an emblem. Neath RFC is the oldest rugby club in Wales, having been formed in 1871. They are feeder club to the Ospreys regional team.

==History==

===Early history===
Neath Rugby Football club was established in 1871 by a consortium of ten enthusiasts, their captain at the time, T. P. Whittington would later play international rugby for Scotland in 1873.

The club&#x27;s nickname, &#x27;The Welsh All Blacks&#x27;, comes from their iconic strip of black jersey, shorts and socks with a white cross pattée. The origin of the team colours is not known for sure. Originally the club&#x27;s players represented the team in various dark kits and the Cross pattée was introduced by one of their players, thought to have been E.C. Moxham, &quot;to break the monotony&quot;. Neath&#x27;s cross pattée is often incorrectly referred to as a Maltese Cross. It is believed that the strip was later switched to the pure black kit as a mark of respect to player Dick Gordon, who died from injuries sustained on the field of play against Bridgend RFC in 1880.

On 12 June 1881, eleven teams met in the Castle Hotel, Neath to form what would be accepted as a Welsh rugby union. The founding clubs of the WFU (Welsh Football Union), as it was originally known, were Swansea C &amp; FC, Pontypool RFC, Newport RFC, Merthyr RFC, Llanelli RFC, Bangor RFC, Brecon RFC, Cardiff RFC, Lampeter College, Llandovery College and Llandeilo RFC. Strangely Neath RFC was not recorded as being present, even though the meeting took place in the town. It is unknown if this was an oversight by the committee to record the presence of the club, or if Neath RFC did not actually attend. One theory put forward is that the president, John Llewellyn and secretary, Sam Clark of the South Wales Football Union were both Neath men. By attending this new union they would be destroying the SWFU and therefore their own influence in the game. These wounds would soon heal and Neath joined the newly formed WFU in the 1882–83 season and would eventually become pivotal in the union&#x27;s development, monopolizing the secretaryship from 1896 to 1955. Sam Clark would in turn become the first Welsh international from Neath RFC, playing in the second Wales game on 28 January 1882. In December 1882 it was decided to amalgamate Neath FC and Neath Abbey FC.

In 1887/88 Neath RFC undertook their first tour of the northern English clubs, including Hartlepool, Manningham and Wortley. The next season Neath played host to Widnes on Christmas Day before undertaking a further northern tour taking on a further five teams in six days. During the 1890/91 season a South West England tour was introduced, which would later become an annual fixture facing clubs such as Bristol and London Welsh.

Martyn Davies holds a very special place in Welsh rugby history because he was captain of Neath in the club&#x27;s centenary year of 1971/72 and it was he who became the first captain to hold aloft the Welsh Cup and to then carry it on its now customary &quot;lap of honour&quot; around the old Cardiff Arms Park.

===2007/08 season===
Their 2007/08 championship season, their fourth in succession, was overshadowed by the death of scrum-half of Gareth Jones, on 16 June 2008. Jones had been injured in a match against Cardiff RFC on 20 April.

===2008/09 season===
Their 2008/09 cup winning season, in which they claimed a victory over Llanelli at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff. This was the first year since the cup name changed from Konica Minolta Cup to Swalec Cup.

==Club records==
Neath RFC hold the world record for the number of points (1,917) and tries (345) accumulated in one season (47 Games). This record was set during the 1988/89 season, it is also worth noting that a try was worth 4 points at the time the record was broken.

The record for the most tries scored in a game in the post-regional era (post 2002) is held by Richard Smith. In January 2010 against Kidwelly RFC Smith scored 7 tries. The pre-regional record of 6 tries is jointly held by Howie Jones (v Aberavon 1928/29), W.D. Williams (v B.P.Llandarcy 1949/50), Keith Maddocks (v Ebbw Vale 1956/57), Alan Edmunds (v Cross Keys 1989/90).

==Organisation and finance==
The company that runs Neath RFC is Neath Rugby Ltd.
On 4 June 2015, Geraint Hawkes (Current chairman of Neath RFC and 50% owner of the club) was found to be &quot;unfit to be concerned in the management of a company&quot; by Judge Keyser Q.C. sitting as a Judge of the High Court (see para 68 of the judgement document) He also decided that the evidence given by Hawkes was &quot;deliberately false&quot; (para 48 - see image).

On 1 July 2015 the judge confirmed the length of the disqualification, as reported by the BBC: &quot;The owner of Neath RFC and his mother have been banned from being company directors for 10 years after failing to declare more than £1.5m in VAT. Geraint Hawkes, 48, and Janis Hawkes, 75, were given the ban at a hearing in Cardiff on Wednesday. Judge Andrew Keyser QC said the pair had been involved in a &quot;serious case&quot; of unpaid VAT. The decision followed a hearing in the High Court Chancery Division sitting in Cardiff last month.&quot;

In an effort to generate more income at their home stadium The Gnoll, the club announced in late 2008, plans to share it with the town&#x27;s football club Neath Athletic. This football team ceased trading at the end of the 2011-12 season due to financial difficulties.

Jardine Norton Ltd became the owners of Neath Rugby Ltd in January 2019.

<text>Johannes Wilhelm Christian Steen (22 July 1827 – 1 April 1906) was a Norwegian statesman and educator who served as the prime minister of Norway from 1891 to 1893 and from 1898 to 1902.

==Background==
He was born in Christiania (now Oslo, Norway). He grew up in Vesteraalen as the son of John Svaboe Steen (1798– 1872), a judge and member of Parliament, and Christine Fleischer (1805–1851). His brother Frederik Steen was also a member of Parliament.

He took his examen artium at Tromsø in 1844. From 1844, he was a student at the University of Christiania and received his cand.philol. in 1848. Over the next 42 years, Steen combined his profession as teacher and educationist with a political career. He served as a teacher in Bergen (1850–55) and Tromsø (1855–1866). He was mayor of Tromsø (1856–1862) and (1864–1866). From 1866 he was Rector of Stavanger Cathedral School.

==Career==
Steen was mayor of Stavanger (1872–1883) and (1885–1890). In 1859 he was first elected member of the Storting for Tromsø. In 1868, Steen was elected to the Storting for Stavanger. From 1871, the Storting became increasingly marked by political debate and struggle between liberal and conservative forces. Steen first served as the President of the lower house (&quot;Odelstinget&quot;) 1871–1873 and 1877–1881. He served as Prime Minister of Norway for two terms. Steen first became Prime Minister from 6 March 1891 – 2 May 1893. In 1894, Steen was re-elected to the Storting from Trondheim. Steen became Prime Minister again from 17 February 1898 – 21 April 1902.

Steen&#x27;s final administration was responsible for the , which limited the buying or leasing of state-owned land to fluent Norwegian speakers, barring the Saami people from the purchase of their traditional hunting and grazing grounds.

In 1884 he was a co-founder of the Norwegian Association for Women&#x27;s Rights.

==Personal life==
He was married in 1849 to Elise Henriette Stoltenberg (1826–1896). He was made a Knight in the Order of St Olav in 1887. He died in 1906 at Voss in Hordaland and was buried at Vår Frelsers gravlund in Kristiania.

<text>The Atari Portfolio (Atari PC Folio) is an IBM PC-compatible palmtop PC, released by Atari Corporation in June 1989. It was the first palmtop computer compatible with the IBM PC ever released.

==History==
DIP Research Ltd. based in Guildford, Surrey, UK released a product in the UK called the &quot;DIP Pocket PC&quot; in 1989. Soon after its release, DIP licensed this product to Atari for sale as the &quot;Portfolio&quot; in the UK and US. In Italy, Spain and Germany, it was originally marketed as &quot;PC Folio&quot; instead. DIP officially stood for &quot;Distributed Information Processing&quot;, although secretly it actually stood for &quot;David, Ian and Peter&quot;, the three founding members of the company who were former employees of Psion. The original founder of the company (first called &quot;Crushproof Software&quot;) was Ian H. S. Cullimore, and the other two David Frodsham and Peter Baldwin. Cullimore was involved in designing the early Organiser products at Psion before the DIP Pocket PC project. The technologic successor of the Portfolio was the also DIP-developed Sharp PC-3000/3100. DIP Research was later acquired by Phoenix Technologies in 1994.

The Portfolio uses an Intel 80C88 CPU running at 4.9152 MHz and runs &quot;DIP Operating System 2.11&quot; (DIP DOS), an operating system mostly compatible to MS-DOS 2.11, but with some DOS 2.xx functionality lacking and some internal data structures more compatible with DOS 3.xx. It has 128 KB of RAM and 256 KB of ROM which contains the OS and built-in applications. The on-board RAM is divided between system memory and local storage (the C: drive). The LCD is monochrome without backlight and has pixels or 40 characters × 8 lines.

The sound is handled by a small Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency speaker capable of outputting tones between 622 and 2,489Hz, the same range as touch-tone telephones, so users could not only use the address book app to store phone numbers, but actually speed-dial them too by holding the device up to a telephone handset.

Power is supplied by three AA size removable alkaline batteries. The computer&#x27;s memory is preserved during battery changes. There is also an optional AC adapter (120V: HPC-401, 230V: HPC-402).

There is an expansion port on the right side of the computer for parallel (HPC-101), serial (HPC-102), modem or MIDI expansion modules. It uses a Bee Card expansion port for removable memory (aka Credit Card Memory or CCM), which is not compatible with PC card as it predated that standard. Expansion cards were available in sizes of 32 KB (HPC-201), 64 KB (HPC-202), and 128 KB (HPC-203) initially, and later were available in capacities up to 4 MB. The expansion cards were backed up by a replaceable battery, which last approximately two years. Built-in applications include a text editor, spreadsheet (Lotus 1-2-3 compatible), phone book and time manager. Expansion cards contain programs such as a chess game (HPC-750), a file manager (HPC-704), and a finance manager (HPC-702). Most text-based DOS applications can run on the Portfolio as long as they did not directly access the hardware and could fit into the small memory.

Other expansion modules include a floppy drive, and a memory expansion unit (HPC-104). The memory expansion unit gives the Portfolio an additional 256 KB of RAM, which can be partitioned into several drives. It also features a pass-through expansion connector, allowing the use of more than one expansion unit. In theory, multiple memory expanders can be attached, increasing the available storage to over 640 KB.

A card reader (HPC-301) connects to a desktop PC to read and write to the expansion cards. The kit contains an ISA card, a special cable, the card reader, and software distributed on floppy disk.

A modem expansion module converts the portfolio into a miniature computer terminal. The modem is powered from the portfolio and came with an acoustic coupler consisting of two round shells that could be mounted over both ends of a handset with the aid of velcro strips. A direct connection to a telephone with a standard telephone lead is also possible. The complete terminal and coupler are portable, weighing only a few hundred grams.

Also, using the parallel port expansion module (HPC-101), a standard parallel cable and the software supplied (DOS-based), the Portfolio can be connected to a PC for transferring files to and from the unit.

Credits for the development of the product can be found in an easter egg if one selects Setup, then Help, and then presses + (&quot;Alt&quot; plus &quot;left square bracket&quot;).

<text>Emil Stang (14 June 1834 – 4 July 1912) was a Norwegian jurist and politician. He served as the prime minister of Norway from 1889–1891 and again from 1893–1895. He also served as the first leader of the Conservative Party from 1884–1889, 1891–1893 and 1896–1899.

==Biography==
Emil Stang was born and died in Christiania (now Oslo, Norway). He was the son of former Prime Minister Frederik Stang. Stang became cand.jur. in 1858 and established his own legal practice in 1861. Starting that year he also took part in the editing of &quot;Ugeblad for Lovkyndighed&quot; (&quot;Weekly magazine for Law knowledge&quot;). From 1871 to 1907 he was the editor of &quot;Norsk Retstidende&quot; (the annals of Norwegian courts), except for the years when he was Prime Minister.

He was the first chairman of the Conservative Party from 1884–1889, and lead the party again 1891–1893, and again 1896–1899. He was Prime Minister from 1889 to 1891 and from 1893 to 1895. From 1889 to 1891 he was President of the Storting. In 1891 he was appointed judge at Kristiania Stiftsoverrett, however, he never acceded this office. He became presiding judge (&quot;lagmann&quot;) for Borgarting and Agder regional courts in 1895 and Supreme Court Justice in 1901. He retired in 1904.
==Personal life==
In 1890, Stang was appointed as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav. He was the father of Emil Stang and Fredrik Stang. He died in Christiania.

<doc id="1204438" wikidata="Q5388807" url="?curid=1204438" title="Erik Routley">
<text>Erik Reginald Routley ( ; 31 October 1917, Brighton, UK – 8 October 1982, Nashville TN) was an English Congregational churchman, theologian, musician, and prominent hymnologist. 

==Career==
His nearly 40 books on theological thought and music of the Christian church are renowned. Raised in Brighton in a Congregational family, he spent his formative years at Lancing College in West Sussex. In 1936, he received an exhibition to Magdalen College, Oxford, and afterward ministerial training at Mansfield College, Oxford. Ordained in 1943, Routley held pastorates in Wednesbury and Dartford before returning to Mansfield in 1948 as Chaplain, Lecturer, Librarian, and Director of Music. In 1953, he was named to the Mackennal Chair of History. It was during these years that he became visible as an historian and hymn expert. He was also Chaplain of the Oxford Congregationalist Society and left a significant positive imprint on those he worked with. He joined the Hymn Society of Great Britain and Ireland in 1943 and became Editor of the &quot;Bulletin&quot;, their quarterly newsletter, for 27 years. He also wrote regularly for &quot;The British Weekly&quot; and the &quot;Congregational Monthly&quot;. His Oxford DPhil thesis (1951), &quot;The Church and Music: An enquiry into the history, the nature and scope of Christian judgement on music&quot; became the source for much of his writing for the rest of his life.

In 1945, Routley was placed on the committee for producing a new hymnal, &quot;Congregational Praise&quot; and eventually wrote its musical companion. The hymnal was launched in 1951 and was the first of over 15 hymnals and supplements that he either edited, co-edited, or consulted over the next thirty years. His first book, &quot;I&#x27;ll Praise My Maker&quot; (1951) was quickly followed by &quot;Hymns and Human Life&quot;, and &quot;Hymns and the Faith&quot;. These became classics almost immediately amongst clergy and church musicians. Because of this, he was in strong demand as a lecturer at universities, seminaries, and music societies in the US and Great Britain. In 1959, Routley returned to congregational ministry in Edinburgh at Augustine-Bristo Congregational Church, where he remained until 1967. While in Scotland, he and Ian Fraser(2017-2018) organized the Dunblane Music Consultations out of which sprung the seminal methods and possibilities for structuring hymnody in the US and UK until the present. In 1965, Routley was named a Fellow of The Royal School of Church Music, the first non-Anglican to receive this honor.

In 1967, Routley became the minister at St. James&#x27;s Congregational Church in Newcastle, continuing his prolific writing and speaking output, and was elected President of the Congregational Union of England and Wales in 1970. That same year, Routley was made a Fellow of Westminster Choir College in Princeton, NJ. The Princeton Theological Seminary brought Routley to the US in 1975 as a lecturer and Director of Chapel. In September of that year, Routley became a Professor of Church Music and Director of Chapel at Westminster Choir College. In September 1982, Routley completed his last editorial project, the hymnal &quot;Rejoice in the Lord&quot; commissioned by the Reformed Church in America. After giving an introductory lecture on the hymnal, he flew to Nashville on 7 October to address a church music conference. He died in his sleep that same night. Routley was posthumously named a Fellow of the Hymn Society in the United States and Canada, in 1985

== Personal ==
In 1944, he married Margaret Scott in the Chapel at Mansfield College. They had three children.

== Works ==
Routley wrote compositions for piano, violin, and organ; over 120 hymn tunes and 40 texts. For comprehensive lists of Routley&#x27;s works see:

<doc id="1204439" wikidata="Q1411451" url="?curid=1204439" title="Transporter wagon">
<text>A transporter wagon, in railway terminology, is a wagon (UIC) or railroad car (US) designed to carry other railway equipment. Normally, it is used to transport equipment of a different rail gauge. In most cases, a transporter wagon is a narrower gauge wagon for transporting a wider gauge equipment, allowing freight in a wider gauge wagons to reach destinations on the narrower gauge network without the expense and time of transshipment into a narrower gauge wagons.

This is an attempt to overcome one of the primary problems with differing gauge systems—gauge incompatibility. However, it means that the narrower gauge network must be built to a structure gauge large enough to accommodate the loading gauge of the wider gauge equipment, negating one of the cost advantages of a narrower gauge construction. Additionally, a large wider gauge wagon balanced on a narrower gauge transporter wagon is not very stable, and is generally restricted to low speeds of or so.

Transporter wagons have seen varying popularity. They were quite common in Germany (where they are called &#x27;), Austria, Switzerland (here called&#x27; in German and &quot;&quot; in French) and Sweden.

Transporter wagons were uncommon in North America, where the practice of exchanging trucks was more common, as was at one time the case on CN&#x27;s Newfoundland Railway at Port aux Basques. They were used on the Paw Paw Railroad of Paw Paw, Michigan for a short time, and on a short stretch of track of the defunct Bradford, Bordell and Kinzua Railroad by lumberman Elisha Kent Kane.
They were used in the United Kingdom on the Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway.

==Transporter flatcar==
Transporter wagons were used extensively for a great many years in Germany, Austria (gauge ), Switzerland ( Brünigbahn) and Sweden (gauges , , and ). This was a boon especially to exchange traffic on the extensive Swedish network, which once comprised almost - in fact a number of local country areas in southern Sweden had nearly no lines at all, just narrow gauge ones. On the other hand, &quot;Rollböcke&quot; were not much used there.

An interesting development of the original transporter wagon concept (with bar couplers between each wagon) was that the bar couplers were discarded in favour of connecting all standard gauge wagons directly with each other by means of their ordinary buffers and chain coupler. This was tried for a few years in Sweden just before the last narrow gauge freight lines were closed in the 1980s.

Special adaptors could be employed to couple a set of transporter wagons onto the end of an &quot;ordinary&quot; narrow gauge freight train. Continuous braking was no problem, either, as the train air line could be incorporated into the bar couplers, too.

Judging from early literature, the transporter wagon idea came about in Germany sometime around 1880 or 1890 (where in fact, later, &quot;Rollböcke&quot; were used a lot more than transporters). Transporter wagons with the unique &quot;Heberlein-&quot;type friction brake system were in daily use in the old GDR (East Germany) well into the late 1980s.

In Britain, they were introduced to the Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway in 1904 by Everard Calthrop, who also introduced them to the Barsi Light Railway in India of 1897. They carried the bulk of the freight traffic on the Leek and Manifold Valley.

Transporter wagons are widely used to get rolling stock including locomotives from gauge-isolated branch lines to main maintenance centres.

=== Crocodile wagons ===
The South Australian and Victorian Railways used broad gauge transporter wagons to carry narrow gauge rolling stock and locomotives to workshops and other isolated narrow-gauge sections. In South Australia, these were called crocodile wagons.

The GWR also had crocodile wagons. One is in the Didcot Railway Centre

===Transporter train in Australia===

In 1955, during an intermediate phase of the replacement of the narrow-gauge () Port Pirie to Marree railway with a standard gauge line, train-lengths of standard-gauge flat wagons were fitted with narrow-gauge rails, allowing narrow-gauge trains carrying coal (from Leigh Creek coalfield), livestock or general freight to travel more quickly by standard gauge on the new, well-engineered alignment. The rails on the flat wagons were continuous, so that the upper train could be rolled on and off in one piece. The leading wagon on the narrow-gauge train was also secured to anchoring on the front wagon on the standard gauge train. Air brakes on the narrow-gauge train were connected to the standard-gauge train&#x27;s air brakes. A narrow-gauge locomotive pushed the narrow-gauge train up an earthen ramp to the deck of the standard gauge train. There were no overhead structures to restrict operation of the trains.

=== Train on Train ===

&quot;Train on Train&quot; was a Japan Railways concept, similar to the South Australian scheme above, for hauling narrow-gauge container wagons at speeds of up to on standard-gauge Shinkansen track through the long, undersea Seikan Tunnel.

=== Transporter transfer stations ===
Between c1900 and c1950 transporter trains were used to carry narrow gauge () rolling stock between four separate narrow gauge branchlines and the workshops. The main lines were gauge. A ramp joined the narrow and broad gauge track end to end in a straight line and the ramp lifted the narrow gauge track by about one metre to the level of the rails on the broad gauge flat waggons.

==Transporter trailer==

Also common on German and eastern European narrower gauge are transporter trailers, which are small-wheeled full trailers that fit beneath each pair of the wagon&#x27;s wheels or each bogie of the car and are hauled by a drawbar. These are &quot;Rollböcke&quot; in German. Some times &quot;one long&quot; small-wheeled full trailer carries the entire rail car. 

== Road Transporter Trains ==
Transporter Trains are also used to carry road vehicles such as cars, lorries and buses through long rail tunnels.
For long distance freight transport, trucks with trailers or semi-trailers (without tractor) are loaded on specialized rail vehicles. See articles about

<doc id="1204440" wikidata="Q931427" url="?curid=1204440" title="Ernest Barnes">
<text>Ernest William Barnes (1 April 1874 – 29 November 1953) was a British mathematician and scientist who later became a liberal theologian and bishop.

He was educated at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was Master of the Temple from 1915 to 1919. He was made Bishop of Birmingham in 1924, the only bishop appointed during Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s first term in office. His modernist views, in particular objection to Reservation, led to conflict with the Anglo-Catholics in his diocese. A biography by his son, Sir John Barnes, &quot;Ahead of His Age: Bishop Barnes of Birmingham&quot;, was published in 1979.

==Birth and education==
Barnes was the eldest of four sons of John Starkie Barnes and Jane Elizabeth Kerry, both elementary school head-teachers. In 1883 Barnes&#x27; father was appointed Inspector of Schools in Birmingham, a position that he occupied throughout the rest of his working life. Barnes was educated at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, and in 1893 went up to Cambridge as a Scholar of Trinity College. He was bracketed Second Wrangler in 1896 and was placed in the first division of the first class in Part II of the Mathematical Tripos in 1897. In the following year he was awarded the first Smith&#x27;s Prize and was duly elected to a Trinity Fellowship. During his time as a Fellow he served on the committee of Cambridge University Liberal Club from 1899 to 1901. He was appointed a lecturer in mathematics in 1902, junior dean in 1906–1908 and a tutor in 1908. He graduated ScD of the University of Cambridge in 1907 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1909. In the years that followed, Barnes was assigned to be Ramanujan&#x27;s tutor and agreed with G. H. Hardy&#x27;s assessment of his brilliance.

==Ministry==
In the same year he became a lecturer in mathematics, Barnes was made deacon by the Bishop of London and from 1906 to 1908 was Junior Dean of Trinity. In 1915, Barnes left Cambridge, and his career as a professional mathematician, upon his appointment as Master of the Temple in London. This was followed in 1918 by a canonry of Westminster Abbey and finally, in 1924, by consecration to the Bishopric of Birmingham, an office he held until April 1953, when he had to retire on account of ill-health. He died at his home in Sussex at the age of 79, survived by his wife and two sons. A bronze memorial tablet to him, as the third bishop of Birmingham, was erected in the south aisle of Birmingham Cathedral, near where his ashes, together with those of his wife, are placed under the pavement marked by a slab with the initials &quot;EWB&quot;.

==Controversies==
Barnes was perhaps the best known liberal bishop of his time, identified with the modernist or broad church movement. His episcopate was marked by continual controversy.

His book &quot;The Rise of Christianity&quot; (1947) attacked many Christian claims, including the Virgin Birth and the bodily resurrection of Christ. This led to calls that he should resign as a bishop. This Barnes refused to do. Earlier he had written &quot;Should Such a Faith Offend?&quot; (1927) and &quot;Scientific Theory and Religion&quot; (1933), and he was a contributor to 18 other books. His attack on Francis of Assisi as &quot;probably verminous&quot; drew a rebuke in verse from G. K. Chesterton.

He was also politically active. In 1940, he lost a libel case in which he had attacked the Cement Makers&#x27; Federation for allegedly holding up the supply of cement, for their own profit at a time of great national need, in the construction of air-raid shelters. Undaunted by this set-back, Barnes returned to his accusations on the cement ring in a speech he delivered in the House of Lords the following year.

==Pacifism and eugenics==
He was an uncompromising pacifist, and spoke out against British participation in the Second World War. He also expressed eugenic views. Though a member of the Eugenic Society from 1924 until his death in 1953, it was not until after the Second World War that he openly argued in favour of voluntary sterilisation as a means to overcome the apparent prevalence of &quot;mental deficiency&quot; in society. Several of these eugenic-themed lectures gained significant newspaper coverage in &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, sparking a fervent public debate in which inevitable – if not entirely justifiable – parallels were drawn between Barnes&#x27; arguments and Nazi ideology. In his latter years Barnes was thus a pacifist, religious leader and campaigner for the perceived declining cause of eugenics.

==Personal life==
In 1916, Barnes married Adelaide Caroline Theresa Ward, daughter of Sir Adolphus Ward. Together they had two sons: John was a diplomat, who served as ambassador to Israel and the Netherlands; and William, a public servant and philanthropist.

<doc id="1204441" wikidata="Q7553840" url="?curid=1204441" title="SoftMan Products Co. v. Adobe Systems Inc.">
<text>SoftMan Products Co. v. Adobe Systems Inc. was a lawsuit heard in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in 2001 by Judge Dean D. Pregerson.

Adobe Systems contended in a counterclaim that the original plaintiff, SoftMan, distributed unauthorized Adobe software, specifically Adobe Educational software and sold individual units the software titles that were purchased from Adobe as a single boxed &quot;Collection&quot;. Adobe claimed that these actions are infringing Adobe&#x27;s copyright and violate Adobe&#x27;s terms of service. Adobe also alleged SoftMan of trademark violation by distributing incomplete versions of their software.

Judge Pregerson ruled that Adobe has sold its software instead of licensed the software. Thus under the first-sale doctrine, Adobe can not control how SoftMan resells those particular copies of Adobe software after the initial sale. The Court also found that SoftMan had not infringed on the EULA because SoftMan had never run the program and therefore never assented to the terms. In addition, the Court found that factual disputes exist on whether the separately sold copies are materially different from the original copies, which is central to Adobe&#x27;s trademark claim. Since Adobe was unable to demonstrate a likelihood of success on both copyright and trademark claims, the Court denied Adobe&#x27;s application for a preliminary injunction against SoftMan.

==Background==
Adobe produces a suite of publishing software. SoftMan sells various software through its website, including individual copies of Adobe software that was originally part of a bundle. Adobe claims such sales are unauthorized and SoftMan is infringing both Adobe&#x27;s copyright and violating terms of service that is embedded in each Adobe Software. The users need to agree to these EULA to install the software. In addition, Adobe claims that SoftMan is distributing Adobe software that is not genuine, because unbundled software does not give the customers access to Adobe&#x27;s support services. Based on the aforementioned claims, Adobe applied for a preliminary injunction.

==Copyright and EULA claim==
In response to Adobe&#x27;s claim, SoftMan argues that first sale doctrine allows SoftMan to unbundle and sell the Adobe software without Adobe&#x27;s restrictions. Adobe asserts that it does not sell any software, rather it licenses its end users the software. Furthermore, the EULA attached to each copy of the software prohibits the &quot;licensee&quot; to unbundle the software.

The court disagrees with Adobe&#x27;s assertion. Since the purchaser pays a fixed fee to obtain the rights to use the software for an indefinite period of time and also accepts the risk commonly associated with a sale, the court determines the transactions between Adobe and SoftMan are sales. Thus, the first sale doctrine applies and Adobe&#x27;s copyright claims are rejected.

In response to Adobe&#x27;s claim that SoftMan violated terms of service described in the EULA, the court decides that SoftMan is not bound by the EULA because there was no assent. However, the court declines to comment on the general issue of shrinkwrap licenses.

==Trademark claim==
Adobe claims that the software sold by SoftMan is not genuine and is infringing on its trademark. SoftMan admits that it repackages the unbundled Adobe Software using Adobe logo. This is not considered trademark infringement under the first sale doctrine. However, the first sale doctrine does not protect any product that is &quot;materially different&quot; from the genuine product. Adobe argues that the resold software lacks customer and technical support that comes with the original bundle. SoftMan disputes this and claims individual software can be registered separately and receive support. Since this dispute exists and not issuing an injunction is likely not going to cause irreparable injury to Adobe, the preliminary injunction is denied.

The western area of the island of Java, namely the provinces of West Java, Banten, and Jakarta, as well as the westernmost part of Central Java, is called by the Sundanese people &quot;Tatar Sunda&quot; or &quot;Pasundan&quot; (meaning Sundanese land).

Sundanese migrants can also be found in Lampung, South Sumatra, and, to a lesser extent, in Central Java and East Java.
The Sundanese people can also be found on several other islands in Indonesia such as Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Bali and Papua.

==Origins==
===Migration theories===
The Sundanese are of Austronesian origins and are thought to have originated in Taiwan. They migrated through the Philippines and reached Java between 1,500 BC and 1,000 BC. Nevertheless, there is also a hypothesis that argues that the Austronesian ancestors of contemporary Sundanese people originally came from Sundaland, a massive sunken peninsula that today forms the Java Sea, the Malacca and Sunda Straits and the islands between them. According to a recent genetic study, Sundanese, together with Javanese and Balinese, has an significant admixture of Austroasiatic and Austronesian ancestries.

===Origin myth===
The &quot;Sunda Wiwitan&quot; belief contains the mythical origin of Sundanese people; Sang Hyang Kersa, the supreme divine being in ancient Sundanese belief created seven bataras (deities) in &quot;Sasaka Pusaka Buana&quot; (The Sacred Place on Earth). The oldest of these bataras is called Batara Cikal and is considered the ancestor of the Kanekes people. The other six bataras ruled various locations in Sunda lands in Western Java. A Sundanese legend of Sangkuriang contains the memory of the prehistoric ancient lake in Bandung basin highland, which suggest that Sundanese already inhabit the region since the Mesolithic era, at least 20,000 years ago. Another popular Sundanese proverb and legend mentioned the creation of Parahyangan (Priangan) highlands, the heartland of the Sundanese realm; &quot;When the hyangs (gods) were smiling, the land of Parahyangan was created&quot;. This legend suggested the Parahyangan highland as the playland or the abode of gods, as well as suggesting its natural beauty.

==History==

===Hindu-Buddhist Kingdoms era===

The earliest historical polity that appeared in the Sundanese realm in the Western part of Java was the kingdom of Tarumanagara, which flourished between the 4th and 7th centuries. Hindu influences reached the Sundanese people as early as the 4th century AD, as is evident in Tarumanagara inscriptions. The adoption of this dharmic faith in the Sundanese way of life was, however, never as intense as their Javanese counterparts. It seems that despite the central court beginning to adopt Hindu-Buddhist culture and institution, the majority of common Sundanese still retained their native natural and ancestral worship. By the 4th century, the older megalithic culture was probably still alive and well next to the penetrating Hindu influences. Court cultures flourished in ancient times, for example, during the era of Sunda Kingdom. However, the Sundanese appear not to have had the resources nor desire to construct large religious monuments. The traditional rural Sundanese method of rice farming, by &quot;ladang&quot; or &quot;huma&quot; (dry rice farming), also contributed to small populations of sparsely inhabited Sundanese villages.
Geographic constraints that isolate each region also led Sundanese villages to enjoy their simple way of life and their independence even more. That was probably the factor that would contribute to the carefree nature, egalitarian, conservative, independent and somewhat individualistic social outlook of the Sundanese people. The Sundanese seems to love and revere their nature in spiritual ways, leading to them adopting some taboos to conserve nature and maintain the ecosystem. The conservative tendency and their somewhat opposition to foreign influences are demonstrated in extreme isolationist measures adopted keenly by Kanekes or Baduy people. They have rules against interacting with outsiders and adopting foreign ideas, technology, and ways of life. They have also set some taboos, such as not cutting trees or harming forest creatures, to conserve their natural ecosystem.

One of the earliest historical records that mention the name &quot;Sunda&quot; appears in the Kebon Kopi II inscription dated 854 saka (932 AD) discovered in Bogor. In 1225, a Chinese writer named Chou Ju-kua, in his book &quot;Chu-fan-chi&quot;, describes the port of &quot;Sin-t&#x27;o&quot; (Sunda), which probably refers to the port of Banten or Kalapa. By examining these records, it seems that the name &quot;Sunda&quot; started to appear in the early 11th century as a Javanese term used to designate their western neighbours. A Chinese source more specifically refers to it as the port of Banten or Sunda Kelapa. After the formation and consolidation of the Sunda Kingdom&#x27;s unity and identity during the Pajajaran era under the rule of Sri Baduga Maharaja (popularly known as King Siliwangi), the shared common identity of Sundanese people was more firmly established. They adopted the name &quot;Sunda&quot; to identify their kingdom, their people and their language.

===Dutch colonial era===

Inland Pasundan is mountainous and hilly, and until the 19th century, it was thickly forested and sparsely populated. The Sundanese traditionally live in small and isolated hamlets, rendering control by indigenous courts difficult. The Sundanese, traditionally engage in dry-field farming. These factors resulted in the Sundanese having a less rigid social hierarchy and more independent social manners. In the 19th century, Dutch colonial exploitation opened much of the interior for coffee, tea, and quinine production, and the highland society took on a frontier aspect, further strengthening the individualistic Sundanese mindset.

===Contemporary era===

There is a widespread belief among Indonesian ethnicities that the Sundanese are famous for their beauty. In his report &quot;Summa Oriental&quot; on the early 16th century Sunda Kingdom, Portuguese apothecary Tomé Pires mentioned: &quot;The (Sundanese) women are beautiful, and those of the nobles chaste, which is not the case with those of the lower classes&quot;. Sundanese women are, as the belief goes, one of the most beautiful in the country due to the climate (they have a lighter complexion than other Indonesians) and a diet featuring raw vegetables (they are said to possess especially soft skin). Bandungite ladies, popularly known as &quot;Mojang Priangan&quot; are reputedly pretty, fashion smart and forward-looking. Probably because of this, many Sundanese people today pursue careers in the entertainment industry.

==Language==

The Sundanese language is spoken by approximately 36 million people in 2010 and is the second most widely spoken regional language in Indonesia. The 2000 Indonesia Census put this figure at 30.9 million. This language is spoken in the southern part of the Banten province, and most of West Java and eastwards as far as the Pamali River in Brebes, Central Java.Sundanese is also closely related to Malay and Minang as it is to Javanese, as seen by the Sundanese utilising different language levels denoting rank and respect – a concept borrowed from the Javanese. It shares similar vocabularies with Javanese and Malay. There are several dialects of Sundanese, from the Sunda–Banten dialect to the Sunda–Cirebonan dialect in the eastern part of West Java until the western part of Central Java Province. Some of the most distinct dialects are from Banten, Bogor, Priangan, and Cirebon. In Central Java, Sundanese is spoken in some of the Cilacap region and some of the Brebes region. It is known that the most refined Sundanese dialect — which is considered as its original form – are those spoken in Ciamis, Tasikmalaya, Garut, Bandung, Sumedang, Sukabumi, and especially Cianjur (The dialect spoken by people living in Cianjur is considered as the most refined Sundanese). The dialect spoken on the north coast, Banten and Cirebon are considered less refined, and the language spoken by Baduy people is considered the archaic type of Sundanese language, before the adoption of the concept of language stratification to denote rank and respect as demonstrated (and influenced) by Javanese.

Today, the Sundanese language is primarily written in Latin script. However, there is an effort to revive the Sundanese script, which was used between the 14th and 18th centuries. For example, street names in Bandung and several cities in West Java are now written in both Latin and Sundanese scripts.

==Religion==
The initial religious systems of the Sundanese were animism and dynamism with reverence to ancestral (&quot;karuhun&quot;) and natural spirits identified as &quot;hyang&quot;, yet bears some traits of pantheism. The best indications are found in the oldest epic poems (&quot;wawacan&quot;) and among the remote Baduy tribe. This religion is called &quot;Sunda Wiwitan&quot; (&quot;early Sundanese&quot;). The rice agriculture had shaped the culture, beliefs and ritual system of traditional Sundanese people, among other the reverence to Nyai Pohaci Sanghyang Asri as the goddess of rice and fertility. The land of Sundanese people in western Java is among the earliest places in the Indonesian archipelago that were exposed to Indian Hindu-Buddhist influences. Tarumanagara followed by Sunda Kingdom adopted Hinduism as early as the 4th century. The Batujaya stupa complex in Karawang shows Buddhist influences in West Java, while Cangkuang Shivaic temple near Garut shows Hindu influence. The 16th-century sacred text Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian contains the religious and moral rules, guidance, prescriptions and lessons for ancient Sundanese people.
Around the 15th to 16th centuries, Islam began to spread among the Sundanese people by Indian Muslim traders, and its adoption accelerated after the fall of the Hindu-animist Sunda Kingdom and the establishment of the Islamic Sultanates of Banten and Cirebon in coastal West Java. Numerous ulama (locally known as &quot;kyai&quot;) penetrated villages in the mountainous regions of Parahyangan and established mosques and schools (pesantren) and spread the Islamic faith amongst the Sundanese people. Small traditional Sundanese communities retained their indigenous social and belief systems, adopting self-imposed isolation, and refused foreign influences, proselytism and modernisation altogether, such as those of the Baduy (Kanekes) people of inland Lebak Regency. Some Sundanese villages such as those in Cigugur Kuningan retained their Sunda Wiwitan beliefs, while some villages such as Kampung Naga in Tasikmalaya, and Sindang Barang Pasir Eurih in Bogor, although identifying themselves as Muslim, still uphold pre-Islamic traditions and taboos and venerated the &quot;karuhun&quot; (ancestral spirits). Today, most Sundanese are Sunni Muslims.
After western Java fell under the control of Dutch East India Company (VOC) in the early 18th century, and later under the Dutch East Indies, Christian evangelism towards the Sundanese people was started by missionaries of Genootschap voor In- en Uitwendige Zending te Batavia (GIUZ). This organisation was founded by Mr F. L. Anthing and Pastor E. W. King in 1851. However, it was Nederlandsche Zendelings Vereeniging (NZV) that sent their missionaries to convert the Sundanese peoples. They started the mission in Batavia, later expanding into several towns in West Java such as Bandung, Cianjur, Cirebon, Bogor and Sukabumi. They built schools, churches and hospitals for native people in West Java. Compared to the large Sundanese Muslim population, the numbers of Christian Sundanese are scarce. Today, Christians in West Java are mostly Chinese Indonesians residing in West Java, with only small numbers of native Sundanese Christians.

In contemporary Sundanese social and religious life, there is a growing shift towards Islamism, especially amongst urban Sundanese. Compared to the 1960s, many Sundanese Muslim women today have decided to wear hijab. The same phenomenon was also found earlier in the Malay community in Sumatra and Malaysia. Modern history saw the rise of political Islam through the birth of Darul Islam Indonesia in Tasikmalaya, West Java, back in 1949, although this movement was later cracked down by the Indonesian Republic. In modern contemporary political landscapes, the Sundanese realm in West Java and Banten also provides widespread support for Islamic parties such as the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) and the United Development Party (PPP). There are numbers of Sundanese ulama and Islamic preachers who have been successful in gaining national popularity, such as Kyai Abdullah Gymnastiar, Ustadz Adi Hidayat and Mamah Dedeh who have become TV personalities through their &quot;dakwah&quot; show. There is an increasing number of Sundanese people who consider the Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) as something that enjoys social prestige. On the other hand, there is also a movement led by the minority Sundanese conservative traditionalist &quot;adat&quot;, the &quot;Sunda Wiwitan&quot; community, who are struggling to achieve wider acceptance and recognition of their faith and way of life.

==Culture==

===Family and social relations===

Sundanese culture is similar to that of Javanese culture. However, it differs in that it has a much less rigid system of social hierarchy. The Sundanese, in their mentality and behavior, greater egalitarianism and antipathy to yawning class distinctions, and community-based material culture, differ from the feudal hierarchy apparent among the people of Javanese principalities. Central Javanese court culture nurtured an atmosphere conducive to elite, stylised, impeccably polished forms of art and literature. Sundanese culture bore few traces of these traditions.

Culturally, the Sundanese people adopt a bilateral kinship system, with male and female descent of equal importance. In Sundanese families, the important rituals revolved around life cycles, from birth to death, adopting many previous Animist and Hindu-Buddhist, as well as Islamic, traditions. For example, during the seventh month of pregnancy, there is a prenatal ritual called &quot;Nujuh Bulanan&quot; (identical to Naloni Mitoni in Javanese tradition) which traces its origins to Hindu ritual. Shortly after the birth of a baby, a ritual called &quot;Akekahan&quot; (from Arabic word: Aqiqah) is performed; an Islamic tradition in which the parents slaughter a goat for a baby girl or two goats for a baby boy, the meat later being cooked and distributed to relatives and neighbors. The circumcision ceremony is performed on prepubescent boys and celebrated with Sisingaan (lion) dance.

The wedding ceremony is the highlight of Sundanese family celebration involving complex rituals from &quot;naroskeun&quot; and &quot;neundeun omong&quot; (marriage proposal and agreement conducted by parents and family elders), &quot;siraman&quot; (bridal shower), &quot;seserahan&quot; (presenting wedding gifts for the bride), &quot;akad nikah&quot; (wedding vows), &quot;saweran&quot; (throwing coins, mixed with flower petals and sometimes also candies, for the unmarried guests to collect and believed to bring better luck in romance), &quot;huap lingkung&quot; (bride and groom feed each other by the hand, with arms entwined to symbolize love and affection), &quot;bakakak hayam&quot; (bride and groom ripping a grilled chicken through holding each of its legs; a traditional way to determine which one will dominate the family which is the one that gets the larger or head part), and the wedding feast inviting whole family and business relatives, neighbours, and friends as guests. Death in a Sundanese family is usually performed through a series of rituals in accordance with traditional Islam, such as the &quot;pengajian&quot; (reciting Al Quran) including providing &quot;berkat&quot; (rice box with side dishes) for guests. The Quran recitation is performed daily, from the day of death through the seventh day following; later performed again on the 40th day, a year, and the 1,000th day after the passing. This tradition today, however, is not always closely and faithfully followed since growing numbers of Sundanese are adopting a less traditional Islam which does not maintain many of the older traditions.

===Artforms===
Sundanese literature was basically oral. Their arts (such as architecture, music, dance, textiles, and ceremonies) substantially preserved traditions from an earlier phase of civilization, stretching back even to the Neolithic, and never overwhelmed (as eastward, in Java) by aristocratic Hindu-Buddhist ideas. The art and culture of Sundanese people reflect historical influences by various cultures that include prehistoric native animism and shamanism traditions, ancient Hindu-Buddhist heritage, and Islamic culture. The Sundanese have very vivid, orally-transmitted memories of the grand era of the Sunda Kingdom. The oral tradition of Sundanese people is called Pantun Sunda, a chant of poetic verses employed for story-telling. It is the counterpart of the Javanese &quot;tembang&quot;, similar to but independent from Malay pantun. The Pantun Sunda often recount Sundanese folklore and legends such as Sangkuriang, Lutung Kasarung, Ciung Wanara, Mundinglaya Dikusumah, the tales of King Siliwangi, and popular children&#x27;s folk stories such as Si Leungli.

=== Music ===
Traditional Sundanese arts include various forms of music, dance, and martial arts. The most notable types of Sundanese music are angklung bamboo music, kacapi suling music, gamelan degung, reyog Sunda and rampak gendang. The Angklung bamboo musical instrument is considered one of the world heritages of intangible culture.

The most well known and distinctive Sundanese dances are Jaipongan, a traditional social dance which is usually, but mistakenly, associated with eroticism. Other popular dances such as the Merak dance describe colourful dancing peafowls. Sisingaan dance is performed mainly in the Subang area to celebrate the circumcision ritual where the boy is seated upon a lion figure carried by four men. Other dances such as the Peafowl dance, Dewi dance and Ratu Graeni dance show Javanese Mataram courtly influences.

Wayang golek puppetry is the most popular wayang performance for Sundanese people. Many forms of &quot;kejawen&quot; dance, literature, gamelan music and shadow puppetry (&quot;wayang kulit&quot;) derive from the Javanese. Sundanese puppetry is more influenced by Islamic folklore than the influence of Indian epics present in Javanese versions.

The Pencak silat martial art in Sundanese tradition can be traced to the historical figure King Siliwangi of the Sunda Pajajaran kingdom, with Cimande as one of the most prominent schools. The recently developed Tarung Derajat is also a popular martial art in West Java. Kujang is the traditional weapon of the Sundanese people.

===Architecture===
The architecture of a Sundanese house is characterised by its functionality, simplicity, modesty, uniformity with little details, its use of natural thatched materials, and its quite faithful adherence to harmony with nature and the environment.

Sundanese traditional houses mostly take basic form of gable roofed structure, commonly called &quot;kampung&quot; style roof, made of thatched materials (&quot;ijuk&quot; black &quot;aren&quot; fibers, &quot;kirai&quot;, &quot;hateup&quot; leaves or palm leaves) covering wooden frames and beams, woven bamboo walls, and its structure is built on short stilts. Its roof variations might includes hip and gablet roof (a combination of gable and hip roof).

The more elaborate overhanging gablet roof is called &quot;Julang Ngapak&quot;, which means &quot;bird spreading wings&quot;. Other traditional Sundanese house forms including &quot;Buka Pongpok, Capit Gunting, Jubleg Nangkub, Badak Heuay, Tagog Anjing&quot;, and &quot;Perahu Kemureb&quot;.

Next to houses, rice barn or called &quot;leuit&quot; in Sundanese is also an essential structure in the traditional Sundanese agricultural community. &quot;Leuit&quot; is essential during &quot;Seren Taun&quot; harvest ceremony.

===Cuisine===
Sundanese cuisine is one of the most famous traditional food in Indonesia, and it is also easily found in most Indonesian cities. The Sundanese food is characterised by its freshness; the famous &quot;lalab&quot; (raw vegetables salad) eaten with &quot;sambal&quot; (chili paste), and also &quot;karedok&quot; (peanuts paste) demonstrate the Sundanese fondness for fresh raw vegetables. Similar to other ethnic groups in Indonesia, Sundanese people eat rice for almost every meal. The Sundanese like to say, &quot;If you have not eaten rice, then you have not eaten at all.&quot; Rice is prepared in hundreds of different ways. However, it is simple steamed rice that serves as the centerpiece of all meals.

Next to steamed rice, the side dishes of vegetables, fish, or meat are added to provide a variety of tastes as well as for protein, mineral and nutrient intake. These side dishes are grilled, fried, steamed or boiled and spiced with any combination of garlic, galangal (a plant of the ginger family), turmeric, coriander, ginger, and lemongrass. The herb-rich food wrapped and cooked inside banana leaf called &quot;pepes&quot; (Sundanese: &quot;pais&quot;) is popular among Sundanese people. &quot;Pepes&quot; are available in many varieties according to their ingredients; carp fish, anchovies, minced meat with eggs, mushroom, tofu or oncom. &quot;Oncom&quot; is a fermented peanut-based ingredient that is prevalent within Sundanese cuisine, just like its counterpart, Tempe, which is popular among Javanese people. Usually, the food itself is not too spicy, but it is served with a boiling sauce made by grinding chilli peppers and garlic together. On the coast, saltwater fish are common; in the mountains, fish tend to be either pond-raised carp or goldfish. A well-known Sundanese dish is &quot;lalapan&quot;, which consists only of raw vegetables, such as papaya leaves, cucumber, eggplant, and bitter melon.

In general, Sundanese food tastes rich and savoury, but not as rich as Padang food, not as sweet as Javanese food.

In Sundanese culture, there is a culture of eating together known as &quot;Cucurak&quot; in the Bogor area or &quot;Munggahan&quot; in the Priangan area. This tradition is usually carried out together with extended family or colleagues when approaching Ramadan.

===Occupations===

The traditional occupation of Sundanese people is agricultural, especially rice cultivation. Sundanese culture and tradition are usually centred around the agricultural cycle. Festivities such as the &quot;Seren Taun&quot; harvest ceremony are held in high importance, especially in the traditional Sundanese community in Ciptagelar village, Cisolok, Sukabumi; Sindang Barang, Pasir Eurih village, Taman Sari, Bogor; and the traditional Sundanese community in Cigugur Kuningan. The typical Sundanese &quot;leuit&quot; (rice barn) is an important part of traditional Sundanese villages; it is held in high esteem as the symbol of wealth and welfare. Since early times, the Sundanese have predominantly been farmers. They tend to be reluctant to be government officers or legislators.

Next to agriculture, Sundanese people often choose business and trade to make a living although most are traditional entrepreneurs, such as travelling food or drink vendors, establishing modest &quot;warung&quot; (food stalls) or restaurants, as the vendor of daily consumer&#x27;s goods or open a modest barber shop. Their affinity for establishing and running small-scale entrepreneurship is most likely contributed by the Sundanese tendency to be independent, carefree, egalitarian, individualistic and optimistic. They seem to abhor the rigid structure and rules of government offices. Several traditional travelling food vendors and food stalls such as &quot;Siomay, Gado-gado&quot; and &quot;Karedok, Nasi Goreng, Cendol, Bubur Ayam, Roti Bakar&quot; (grilled bread), &quot;Bubur kacang hijau&quot; (green beans congee) and Indomie instant noodle stall are notably run by Sundanese.

Nevertheless, there are numbers of Sundanese that successfully carved their career as intellectuals or politicians in national politics, government offices and military positions. Some notable Sundanese has gained positions in the Indonesian government as governor, municipal major, vice president and state ministers, also as officers and general in the Indonesian military.

Sundanese is also popularly known as cheerful and mercurial folks, as they love to joke and tease around. The wayang golek artform of Cepot, Dawala, and Gareng punakawan characters demonstrate the Sundanese quirky side. Some Sundanese might find art and culture as their passion and become artists, either in fine art, music or performing art. Today, there are several Sundanese involved in the music and entertainment industry, with some of Indonesia&#x27;s most famous singers, musicians, composers, cinema directors, film and sinetrons (soap opera) actors being of Sundanese origin.

==Notable people==
Notable Sundanese that has been recognised as Indonesian national heroes include Dewi Sartika that fought for equality for women&#x27;s education, and statesmen such as Oto Iskandar di Nata and Djuanda Kartawidjaja. Former governor of Jakarta Ali Sadikin and Anies Baswedan, former vice president Umar Wirahadikusumah, and former defence minister Agum Gumelar, and ministers of foreign affairs such as Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, Hassan Wirajuda and Marty Natalegawa, Meutya Hafid are among notable Sundanese in politics. Ajip Rosidi and Achdiat Karta Mihardja are among Indonesian distinguished poets and writers.

The modern Indonesian entertainment industry employs large numbers of Sundanese artists that have become Indonesia&#x27;s most famous singers, musicians, composers, cinema directors, film and sinetron actors. Famous dangdut singers Rhoma Irama, Elvy Sukaesih and, musicians and composers such as Erwin Gutawa and singers such as Adhisty Zara, Roekiah, Hetty Koes Endang, Vina Panduwinata, Nicky Astria, Nike Ardilla, Poppy Mercury, Rossa, Gita Gutawa and Syahrini, Indonesian sinetrons actors such as Raffi Ahmad, Jihan Fahira and Asmirandah Zantman, also stunt choreographer, movie action star Kang Cecep Arif Rahman, also film director Nia Dinata, are among artists of Sundanese background. Famous wayang golek puppet master was Asep Sunandar Sunarya, while Sule, Jojon and Kang Ibing are a popular comedians. In sports, Indonesian athletes of Sundanese background include badminton Olympic gold medalists Taufik Hidayat, Ricky Subagja and Rizki Juniansyah.

<text>James Christopher Belich (born 1956) is a New Zealand historian, known for his work on the New Zealand Wars and on New Zealand history more generally. One of his major works on the 19th-century clash between Māori and Pākehā, the revisionist study &quot;The New Zealand Wars&quot; (1986), was also published in an American edition and adapted into a television series and DVD.

In 2011, Belich was appointed the Beit Professor of Imperial and Commonwealth History, and he is a co-founder and former director of the Oxford Centre for Global History at the University of Oxford.

==Background==
Of Croatian descent, Belich was born in Wellington in 1956, the son of Jim Belich, who later became the mayor of Wellington. Educated at Onslow College, he went on to study at Victoria University of Wellington, where he earned a Master of Arts degree in history. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship in 1978 and went to the University of Oxford to complete his DPhil at Nuffield College.

==Academic career==
Belich lectured at Victoria University of Wellington for several years before moving to the University of Auckland. His book &quot;The New Zealand Wars&quot; won the international Trevor Reese Memorial Prize in 1987. Based on his Dphil thesis, it was later turned into a major documentary series for Television New Zealand. &quot;The New Zealand Wars&quot; was a five-part series with Belich presenting that was released in 1998. It was controversial for the startling claim that northern Maori invented trench warfare.

&quot;I Shall Not Die&#x27;: Titokowaru&#x27;s War&quot; (1990), based on his MA thesis, was also highly praised, winning the Adam Award for New Zealand literature. Belich has written a two-volume work &quot;A History of the New Zealanders&quot;, consisting of &quot;Making Peoples&quot; (1996) and &quot;Paradise Reforged&quot; (2001).

In 2007, he moved from the University of Auckland to a professorship at Victoria University, and was appointed professor of history at the Stout Research Centre for New Zealand Studies. He expanded his area of research to colonial societies in general and the place of settler colonialism in world history with &quot;Replenishing the earth&quot; (2009). The book was the choice of Maya Jasanoff in a list of the 11 best scholarly books of the 2010s by &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education.&quot;

In 2011, he remained professor of history at Victoria University&#x27;s Stout Research Centre for New Zealand Studies. That year, Belich was appointed Beit Professor of Commonwealth History at the University of Oxford, where he is a former director and co-founder of the Oxford Centre for Global History. In 2023, he remained Professor of Global and Imperial History at Baliol College, Oxford. His book &quot;The World the Plague Made: The Black Death and the Rise of Europe&quot; was shortlisted for the Wolfson History Prize in 2023.

==Honours and awards==
In the 2006 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Belich was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for service to historic research.

Belich was the winner of the non-fiction category at the 2011 Prime Minister&#x27;s Awards for Literary Achievement His book, &quot;The World the Plague Made&quot;, was shortlisted for the 2023 Wolfson History Prize.

<text>Braeriach or Brae Riach (, &#x27;the brindled upland&#x27;) is the third-highest mountain in Scotland and all of the British Isles, after Ben Nevis and Ben Macdui, rising above sea level. It is in the Scottish Highlands and is the highest point in the western massif of the Cairngorms, separated from the central section by the Lairig Ghru pass. The summit is a crescent-shaped plateau, overlooking several corries.

Probably the most commonly used route up Braeriach starts from Sugar Bowl car park, on the road leading to the Cairn Gorm ski area. From here a path leads over the hillside to a steep-sided rocky ravine known as the Chalamain Gap, before descending around to the Lairig Ghru. After crossing this pass the route heads for the summit via Braeriach&#x27;s north ridge, crossing a subsidiary peak, Sròn na Lairige. The summit is about from the car park by this route.

== Snow patch ==
The lingering snows of Braeriach are amongst the most persistent snow patches in Scotland and the whole British Isles. &quot;Sphinx&quot; is a remote patch of snow in Cairngorms National Park on Braeriach, which is historically known for its semi-permanent year-round longevity; the north-facing corrie of Garbh Coire Mor has entirely melted only in 1933, 1959, 1996, 2003, 2006, 2017, 2018, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. The rate and occurrence of melting appears to be increasing. Named for a nearby climbing route, it was first noted by members of the Scottish Mountaineering Club in the 1840s, and is thought by scientists to have fully melted in the 18th century, given the climatic and meteorological records. More generally, Garbh Choire Mor is Scotland&#x27;s snowiest corrie, where snow typically persists into the summer months. Declining snow cover has persisted in the area since the winter of 1983–1984.

<doc id="1204462" wikidata="Q1157554" url="?curid=1204462" title="Daihatsu Charmant">
<text>The is a subcompact car built by Daihatsu. It was succeeded by the Applause two years after Charmant production ended. The Charmant was heavily based on the E20/E70 Toyota Corolla platforms; model changes paralleled those of the Corolla. All Charmants were fitted with Toyota inline-four engines, ranging from 1.2 to 1.6 litres. The word &quot;charmant&quot; is French for &quot;charming.&quot;

When it was introduced, it was the largest Daihatsu passenger vehicle sold in Japan (until the introduction of the Delta Wide minivan in 1982), with the Charade supermini in the middle, and the Mira &quot;kei car&quot; as the smallest.

==First generation (A10/A20/A30/A40; 1974–1981)==
First presented in November 1974, the first generation Daihatsu Charmant was based on the E20 Corolla platform. The Charmant was marketed with luxury orientation by the use of dual headlights which was only available for higher class cars at the time. Initially only three grades were offered; Deluxe, Custom and Hi-Custom. It came with 1.2-litre &quot;3K-H&quot; engine producing and 1.4-litre &quot;T&quot; engine producing , both in SAE gross rating. These vehicles were coded as A10 (1.2-litre) and A20 (1.4-litre) and came with a four- or five-speed manual transmission, as well as a two-speed automatic option.

Unique to the first generation, an estate was also available. This was called &quot;van&quot; in the Japanese domestic market, where it was classed as a commercial vehicle. The van was introduced in December 1974, a month after the saloons debuted. These vans were given A10V and A20V codes. These vans were only available with a standard four-speed manual transmission and an additional base grade called Standard, while the top grade Hi-Custom was exclusive for the saloons.

In 1975, the engines were improved with the implementation of DECS-C (Daihatsu Economical Cleanup System-Catalyst) emission control to pass 1975 Japanese emission regulation. A minor facelift appeared in November 1976 with a refreshed front grille, two new grades for the saloons; Grand Custom (GC) and Sporty Custom (SC), combined with another engine tweak for the saloons to pass the 1976 emission regulation (the vans had less stringent emission standards). The engines were now called &quot;3K-U&quot; and &quot;T-U&quot;, producing and SAE gross, respectively.

The 1.2- and 1.4-litre engines were replaced by the 1.3-litre &quot;4K-U&quot; (A30) and the 1.6-litre DECS-L lean-burn &quot;12T-U&quot; (A40) in March 1978, along with big changes to the exterior and interior, including a boxier face, taillights and dashboard. A protective side strip was also added. In July 1978, a three-speed automatic with overdrive version of the 1.6-litre engine appeared. The older engines were remained for the vans, but were renamed &quot;3K-HJ&quot; and &quot;T-J&quot; because of another round of modifications to pass the 1978 emission regulation. Theses engines generate and respectively. The 1.3- and 1.6-litre engines for the vans arrived in 1979, called &quot;4K-J&quot; () and &quot;12T-J&quot; (), still with a standard four-speed manual transmission. The model codes were changed to A30V and A40V.

===Export===
This model was exported to a fair number of countries, mostly markets without their own automobile industry. Generally, it was only offered with a single unnamed grade. These export specification Charmants were fitted with the general specification of &quot;3K&quot; and &quot;T&quot; engines, generating and in DIN net form, respectively. It only came with a four-speed manual transmission. These engines remained in the 1978 facelift, until a bigger 1.6-litre &quot;2T&quot; engine was added to the line up in 1979, it produced . This engine was available with additional five-speed manual or three-speed automatic options.

It was the first Daihatsu to be sold in Iceland, where a large number of surplus cars from the Netherlands were brought in the summer of 1979. Sold at a very low price, it became one of Iceland&#x27;s most popular cars that year. For the export model, the conventional 1.6-litre was fitted in the Charmant, instead of the learn-burn &quot;12T-U&quot; version used for the domestic Japanese market.

==Second generation (A35/A45/A55/A60; 1981–1987)==

A new Charmant was launched at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 1981 with new squarer bodywork that was somewhat outmoded already when being introduced, as was its front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout. Due to Daihatsu&#x27;s unfamiliarity with the process of presenting new cars in Frankfurt, the car was omitted from most official press releases and several automobile writers overlooked the fact that there was a new car on Daihatsu&#x27;s stand. The only bodywork available was a four-door saloon.

In Japan, the biggest engine was now an SOHC with at 5600 rpm. In the export, the 1.6-litre 2T engine was also available; power outputs ranged from depending on compression ratios and intended markets. For the 1984 model year, the larger engine was changed to the overhead cam 4A unit, with an alloy head. Performance improved marginally while the fuel mileage was considerably better. The smaller 1.3-litre engine, of , produced between depending on market. Trim levels were LD, LC, LE, and LGX; these continued until 1987 when the range was discontinued in the United Kingdom and most other export markets. All the engines were carburetted. In Japan, the top trim package (with available climate control) was called &quot;Altair&quot;.

The Charmant had an independent front suspension (struts), and a live four-link rear axle. Suspension settings were soft, for maximum comfort. The car then underwent a minor facelift in autumn 1984. The original leaf springs at the rear were replaced by coilovers at this time.

European market models became available with a catalyzed version of the 4A engine for the last few years; this fuel injected engine produces . The Charmant production ended in late 1987, while the shared Toyota Corolla platform changed to front-wheel drive in 1983 (although the estate/van continued until 1987, also built by Daihatsu from September 1984). When the Charmant stopped production, it left Daihatsu without a compact saloon until 1989, when the Applause was introduced.

<doc id="1204468" wikidata="Q917851" url="?curid=1204468" title="River Lee">
<text>The River Lee () is a river in Ireland. It rises in the Shehy Mountains on the western border of County Cork and flows eastwards through Cork, where it splits in two for a short distance, creating an island on which Cork&#x27;s city centre is built, then passes through Cork Harbour on the south coast, one of the largest natural harbours in the world, to empty into the Celtic Sea. The catchment area of the River Lee is 1,253 km2. The long-term average flow rate of the River Lee is 40.4 cubic metres per second (m3/s).

A hydro-electric scheme was built on the river, upstream from Cork City, and this part of the river now contains the Carrigadrohid and Inniscarra reservoirs. The river is crossed by 42 bridges, 29 of which are in Cork City, and one tunnel. The river also provides an stretch of salmon fishing.

==Name==
Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; (2nd century AD) described a river called Δαβρωνα (&quot;Dabrona&quot;) or Λαβρωνα (&quot;Labrona&quot;), which is sometimes considered to refer to the River Lee. Though unconfirmed, the Irish name for the river, &quot;Laoi&quot;, may derive from &quot;Corca Luighe&quot;, which in turn derives from &#x27;Luighe&#x27;, the son of a quasi-mythical Milesian noble.

There is also the Λουρ (&quot;Lour&quot;), a separate river which passes through Tralee.

==Description==
===Sources===
The River Lee has its source in the Shehy Mountains near Gougane Barra, where there is a forest park, chapel, hotel, and shop.

===Course===

The Lee flows from the lake of Gougane Barra as a fast-paced torrent, but by the town of Ballingeary it eases and flows into Lough Allua. Departing the lough, running east, it again becomes a rapid flow before running into The Gearagh, and Carrigadrohid feeder reservoirs, and then into the large Inniscarra reservoir created by Inniscarra Dam. Moving on, it flows down from the dam, in normal conditions a gentle river until it comes to Ballincollig Weir in Ballincollig Park; here it is dangerous to swimmers when in high water. The Lee then flows into the city under Inniscarra Bridge and flows parallel to the Carrigrohane road. Along this section gauges monitor the water levels from the Inniscarra Dam. The river flows over the Lee weir and then is split into the north and south channels at a sluice (it historically occupied the city area as a maze of channels). This area is popular for recreation, kayaking and fishing. The two channels join again at the Cork docks and enter the extensive estuary and harbour, south of Glanmire, passing either side of Great Island (Cobh lies on the south coast) to fill the outer harbour, and reaching the open sea between Whitegate and Crosshaven.

===Tributaries===
====Upper course (above Inchigeela)====
High tributaries include the Owenagariff, the Bunsheelin, the Paudeen and the Garrifowa.

====Middle course (to the Dripsey)====
Tributaries joining below Lough Allua and Inchigeela include the River Toon, the extensive Sullane River system, from near Ballyvourney (tributaries include the Douglas, Finnow, Foherish and Laney or Laine Rivers) via Macroom, the smaller Buinea and Glashagariff Rivers, and the River Dripsey and its tributaries the Rylane and the Delaghinagh.

====Near Cork city====
Below the last ESB dam, tributaries joining include the River Bride from Slievowen via Crookstown, Killumney and Ovens, and the River Shournagh (formed from the Blarney and Martin Rivers, and the Owennagearagh River; historically may have been the Awbeg River).

====City area====

City area tributaries include the combined Maglin (from Ballincollig) and Curraheen (occasionally Curragheen) Rivers, capturing the Glasheen River also and joining at the western end of the UCC complex, and the Kiln River (sometimes Bride River) which joins by the Christy Ring Bridge in the city centre, a little west of St. Patrick&#x27;s Bridge (formed in turn from a Bride River and the Kilnap or Glennamought River, later joined by the Glen River). 

====Tidal area====
Estuarine tributaries include the Glashaboy River, passing Glanmire (main tributaries the Black Brook, Cloghnageshee River and Butterstown River), the Douglas or Tramore River (joined by the Trabeg River as it flows into the Douglas Channel, its estuary) which drains parts of the southern city, Owennacurra River (joined by the Dungurney River at Midleton), and the Owenaboy River almost at the final mouth of the outer Lee estuary (the Liberty Stream joins this river, with significant flows from Cork Airport).

==Recreation==
Recreation activities on the Lee include sailing, swimming, kayaking, water skiing. Several rowing clubs are based on the Lee including the &quot;Lee Rowing Club&quot;, &quot;Shandon Boat Club&quot; and “Cork Boat Club”. Naomhoga Chorcai is also based on the Marina, and is Ireland&#x27;s largest Currach (traditional canvas fishing boat) rowing club. Angling is also common from the banks of the Lee Fields.

==Flooding==
Tidal considerations, combined with low-lying urban developments, and later dam management contribute to repeated flooding events on the Lee. Specific streets in Cork city centre have been affected by floods more than 100 times since the mid-19th century.

===2009 flooding===
In late 2009 the river flooded, causing some of the most significant damage in Cork city for a number of centuries. The Lee Water Station was forced to shut down after being submerged under six metres of water, and resulted in 40% of Cork City (50,000 people) being without running water for over a week. 
 Lower-lying parts of the University College Cork campus were also flooded extensively, resulting in lectures being cancelled throughout the week. There was severe damage to the university&#x27;s then newly built IT building, the Western Gateway Building, situated next to the river on a known floodplain, where, for example, a 300-seat auditorium was flooded to near ceiling height. To prevent issues upstream, the ESB made a controversial decision to release water from the Inniscarra hydro-electric dam. This released 535 tonnes of water per second into the already flooded river, raising the flood to 1.5 metres in parts of the city centre. The ESB insisted this was an essential move, and if water had not been released, the flooding would have been much worse.

<doc id="1204471" wikidata="Q4181026" url="?curid=1204471" title="Roadworks">
<text>Roadworks, also called road construction or road work, occur when part of the road, or in rare cases, the entire road, has to be occupied for work relating to the road, most often in the case of road surface repairs. In the United States road work could also mean any work conducted in close proximity of travel way (thoroughfare) such as utility work or work on power lines (i.e. telephone poles). The general term of road work is known as work zone.

Roadworks can, however, also happen when a major accident occurs and road debris from the crash needs to be cleared.

Roadworks are often signposted, although it is possible that the signage comes too late or too sudden or is missing.
Typical road work traffic controls are temporary signs, traffic cones, barrier boards and t-top bollards as well as other forms of warning devices. There are standards of temporary traffic control established in each country for various type of road work.

Roadworks are frequently carried out throughout the night so as to minimize traffic disruption.

Currently there are very few sources of accurate roadworks information sites available that report on the status of current works and future works. In the United Kingdom, the government roadworks.org website aims to provide a national and live dataset of roadworks for the purpose of coordination and reporting. It includes roadworks information supplied by Local Authorities and national agencies like the Highways Agency.

== Health effects ==


=== Mitigation ===
== Signage ==
Typically, roadworks signs are indicated by an orange diamond in most MUTCD-influenced countries.

The 1948 edition of the &quot;Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; specified the legend &quot;MEN WORKING&quot; to indicate roadworks. For most European countries, the roadworks sign includes a red-bordered triangular sign with a symbol of roadworks.

The Federal Highway Administration (since 1990) and the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals (since 1968) prohibit the use of the &quot;MEN WORKING&quot; legend, replacing with the legend &quot;ROAD WORK&quot; and the symbolic roadworks sign (typically using a gender-neutral silhouette) respectively.

The worded legend of the warning sign upcoming roadworks, which is prohibited by the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals because UN-compliant signs must make use of more pictograms, is allowed in the United States by the 2009 MUTCD.

== Lane markings ==
In some countries, where lanes must be altered so as to accommodate roadworks, the new lanes (or interim lanes) are marked with a different colour and take precedence over the previous lanes. In Germany, Poland and many other European countries, it is yellow; in Switzerland and in Ireland, it is orange.

<doc id="1204479" wikidata="Q1424810" url="?curid=1204479" title="Thai Industrial Standard 620-2533">
<text>Thai Industrial Standard 620-2533, commonly referred to as TIS-620, is the most common character set and character encoding for the Thai language. The standard is published by the Thai Industrial Standards Institute (TISI), an organ of the Ministry of Industry under the Royal Thai Government, and is the sole official standard for encoding Thai in Thailand.

The descriptive name of the standard is &quot;Standard for Thai Character Codes for Computers&quot; (Thai: รหัสสำหรับอักขระไทยที่ใช้กับคอมพิวเตอร์). &quot;2533&quot; refers to year 2533 of the Buddhist Era (1990), the year the present version of the standard was published; a previous revision, TIS 620-2529 (1986), is now obsolete. The code page layout is the same between the two editions.

TIS-620 is the IANA preferred charset name for TIS-620, and that charset name is used also for ISO/IEC 8859-11 (which adds a no-break space character at 0xA0, which is unassigned in TIS-620). When the IANA name is used the codes are supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429.

==Structure==
TIS-620 is a conventionally structured Extended ASCII national character set that retains full compatibility with 7-bit ASCII and uses the 8-bit range hex A1 to FB for encoding the Thai alphabet. Due to the complex combining nature of Thai vowels and diacritics, TIS-620 is intended for information interchange only, and an additional display engine is required to compose characters correctly.

==Variants==
A nearly identical version of TIS-620 has been adopted as ISO/IEC 8859-11 in 2001, the sole difference being that ISO/IEC 8859-11 defines hex A0 as a non-breaking space, while TIS-620 leaves it undefined but reserved. (In practice, this small distinction is usually ignored.)

The ISO/IEC 8859-11 set has also been registered as ISO-IR-166 by Ecma International, but this variation adds explicit escape codes for signaling the beginning and end of Thai character sequences.

The TIS-620 character set ordering has been used essentially as is within Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) as well. Unicode&#x27;s Thai block is U+0E01 through U+0E7F, and TIS-620 Thai characters can be converted to UTF-16 simply by prefixing each byte with 0E and subtracting hex A0 from the value.

==Character set==
In the table above, 20 is the regular SPACE character. Code values 00-1F, 7F, 80-9F, A0, DB-DE and FC-FF are not assigned to characters by TIS-620.

Code values D1, D4-DA, E7-EE are combining characters.

<doc id="1204482" wikidata="Q407131" url="?curid=1204482" title="Sorbic acid">
<text>Sorbic acid, or 2,4-hexadienoic acid, is a natural organic compound used as a food preservative. It has the chemical formula and the structure . It is a colourless solid that is slightly soluble in water and sublimes readily. It was first isolated from the unripe berries of the &quot;Sorbus aucuparia&quot; (rowan tree), hence its name.

==Production==
The traditional route to sorbic acid involves condensation of malonic acid and crotonaldehyde. It can also be prepared from isomeric hexadienoic acids, which are available via a nickel-catalyzed reaction of allyl chloride, acetylene, and carbon monoxide. The route used commercially, however, is from crotonaldehyde and ketene. An estimated 30,000 tons are produced annually.

==History==
Sorbic acid was isolated in 1859 by distillation of rowanberry oil by A. W. von Hofmann. This affords parasorbic acid, the lactone of sorbic acid, which he converted to sorbic acid by hydrolysis. Its antimicrobial activities were discovered in the late 1930s and 1940s, and it became commercially available in the late 1940s and 1950s. Beginning in the 1980s, sorbic acid and its salts were used as inhibitors of &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot; in meat products to replace the use of nitrites, which can produce carcinogenic nitrosamines.

==Properties and uses==
With a p&quot;K&quot;a of 4.76, sorbic acid is about as acidic as acetic acid.

Sorbic acid and its salts, especially potassium sorbate and calcium sorbate, are antimicrobial agents often used as preservatives in food and drinks to prevent the growth of mold, yeast, and fungi. In general the salts are preferred over the acid form because they are more soluble in water, but the active form is the acid. The optimal pH for the antimicrobial activity is below pH 6.5. Sorbates are generally used at concentrations of 0.025% to 0.10%. Adding sorbate salts to food will, however, raise the pH of the food slightly so the pH may need to be adjusted to assure safety. It is found in foods such as various kinds of cheese, bread, muffins, donuts, pies, cookies, protein bars, syrups, lemonades, fruit juices, dried meats, sausages, nuggets, burgers, sandwiches, tacos, pizzas, smoked fish, margarine, sauces, soups, and more.

The E numbers are:
* E200 Sorbic acid
* E201 Sodium sorbate
* E202 Potassium sorbate
* E203 Calcium sorbate

Some molds (notably some &quot;Trichoderma&quot; and &quot;Penicillium&quot; strains) and yeasts are able to detoxify sorbates by decarboxylation, producing &quot;trans&quot;-1,3-pentadiene. The pentadiene manifests as a typical odor of kerosene or petroleum. Other detoxification reactions include reduction to 4-hexenol and 4-hexenoic acid.

Sorbic acid can also be used as an additive for cold rubber, and as an intermediate in the manufacture of some plasticizers and lubricants.

==Safety==
Sorbic acid and sorbate salts have a very low mammalian toxicity and carcinogenicity. Its is estimated to be between 7.4 and 10 g/kg.

<doc id="1204489" wikidata="Q976990" url="?curid=1204489" title="James D. Watkins">
<text>James David Watkins (March 7, 1927 – July 26, 2012) was a United States Navy admiral and former Chief of Naval Operations who served as the United States Secretary of Energy during the George H. W. Bush administration, also chairing U.S. government commissions on HIV/AIDS and ocean policy. Watkins also served on the boards of various companies and other nongovernmental organizations and as the co-chair of the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative.

==Early life and education==
Watkins was born March 7, 1927, in Alhambra, California. His grandfather George Clinton Ward was president of Southern California Edison during the 1930s. His father, Edward Francis Watkins, owned the Southern California Winery Co. His mother, Louise Watkins, unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Senate in 1938; he described his mother as &quot;a woman ahead of her time.&quot;

Watkins attended Webb School of California in Claremont, California; he subsequently graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1949 and received his master&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering from the Naval Postgraduate School in 1958.

==Career==

Watkins spent 37 years in the United States Navy, serving on destroyers, cruisers and submarines, and shore assignments in personnel management. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Combat &#x27;V&#x27; as a result of combat operations that occurred in May and June 1968, in the Gulf of Tonkin, while serving as executive officer of . In those operations, the ship participated in events leading to the shoot-down of five North Vietnamese MiG aircraft, two by air intercept with her air controllers (1967), and three by long range surface-to-air missiles (first in US Naval history) (1967 and 1968). The longest kill was at eighty miles.

During his tenure in the Navy, Watkins served as Chief of Naval Operations, Commander of the Sixth Fleet, Vice Chief of Naval Operations, and commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet.

Watkins&#x27;s ties to oceans as a graduate of the Naval Academy, a submariner and former Chief of Naval Operations, contributed to his commitment to ocean policy reform. When the Oceans Act of 2000 was passed, President George W. Bush established the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, and appointed Watkins to chair the commission. The 16-member commission presented recommendations for a new and comprehensive national ocean policy. Their final report, &quot;An Ocean Blueprint for the 21st Century&quot;, was released in 2004.

Concurrently, the Pew Charitable Trusts established the Pew Oceans Commission, which was led by President Bill Clinton&#x27;s former Chief of Staff Leon Panetta. The 18-member group presented its own recommendations on ocean policy to Congress and the administration. Their final report, &quot;America&#x27;s Living Oceans: Charting a Course for Sea Change&quot;, was released in 2003.

The two reports listed strikingly similar recommendations. As a result, Congress and the administration began to recognize the importance of ocean policy reform. To further these recommendations, and to act as one unified force, the two commissions came together in 2004 to establish the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative. Watkins co-chaired the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative with Leon Panetta, and was called on as an expert to advise and testify before Congress on ocean governance reform. He was also cited in the media as an expert on ocean issues and penned a number of opinion pieces calling for ocean reform that were published in national outlets.

===Reagan administration===
President Ronald Reagan appointed Watkins as chairman of his President’s Commission on the HIV Epidemic. Watkins surprised many AIDS-awareness advocates when his conservative panel unexpectedly recommended supporting antibias laws to protect HIV-positive people, on-demand treatment for drug addicts, and the speeding of AIDS-related research.

===George H. W. Bush administration===

On March 9, 1989, Watkins was sworn in as Secretary of Energy by President George H. W. Bush. He remained as Energy Secretary until 1993.

On June 27, 1989, Watkins announced the Ten-Point Plan to strengthen environmental protection and waste management activities at the United States Department of Energy&#x27;s production, research, and testing facilities. In September 1989, he established the Modernization Review Committee to review the assumptions and recommendations of the 2010 Report. On November 9, 1989, Watkins established the Office of Environmental Restoration and Waste Management within the Department of Energy. On August 15, 1990, Secretary Watkins announced plans to increase oil production and decrease consumption to counter Iraqi-Kuwaiti oil losses caused by the Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait. On March 4, 1991, he transmitted the administration&#x27;s energy bill to the House and Senate. On May 10, 1992, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee he reported that, for the first time since 1945, the United States was not building any nuclear weapons.

===George W. Bush administration===
Watkins was appointed to what would be the second presidential commission to be known as the &quot;Watkins Commission&quot; when named Chairman of the United States Commission on Ocean Policy in 2001.

==Personal life==
Watkins married Sheila Jo McKinney in 1950. They had six children: Katherine Marie Watkins Coopersmith, RNCS; Laura Jo Watkins Kauffmann; Charles Lancaster Watkins; Susan Elizabeth Watkins, Reverend Monsignor James David Watkins, Ph.D., Catholic priest and pastor of Saint Ann Roman Catholic Church in northwest Washington, D.C., and Edward Francis Watkins, Ph.D.

==Death==
Watkins died of congestive heart failure on July 26, 2012, at the age of 85. He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Awards and decorations==
===U.S. military awards and decorations===

===U.S. civilian awards===
===Foreign awards===

Watkins also received decorations from Italy, France, Spain, Pakistan, and Sweden.

In March 2001, Watkins was given the title of President Emeritus of the Consortium for Ocean Research and Education (CORE), and was awarded the Navy&#x27;s Distinguished Public Award by the Secretary of the Navy. On April 21, 2005, the Naval Postgraduate Mechanical Engineering Building was renamed Watkins Hall, after Watkins. He was also a member of the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) Hall of Fame.

In June 1983, Watkins was inducted as a Knight of Malta. In 1991 he was awarded the AAES Chairs&#x27; Award from the American Association of Engineering Societies.

<doc id="1204490" wikidata="Q542069" url="?curid=1204490" title="Orlando Jones">
<text>Orlando Jones (born April 10, 1968) is an American stand-up comedian and actor. He is known for being one of the original cast members of the sketch comedy series &quot;MADtv&quot;, for his role as the 7 Up spokesman from 1999 to 2002, and for his role as the African god Anansi on Starz&#x27;s &quot;American Gods&quot;.

==Early life==
Jones was born in Mobile, Alabama, in 1968. His father was a professional baseball player in the Philadelphia Phillies organization. He moved to Mauldin, South Carolina, when he was a teen and graduated from Mauldin High School in 1985. One of his early acting experiences involved playing a werewolf in a haunted house to help raise money for the junior/senior prom. Jones enrolled in the College of Charleston, South Carolina. He left in 1990 without finishing his degree.

To pursue his interest in the entertainment industry, Jones, together with comedian Michael Fechter, formed a production company, Homeboy&#x27;s Productions and Advertising. Together Jones and Fechter worked on several projects including a McDonald&#x27;s commercial with basketball superstar Michael Jordan for the McDonald&#x27;s specialty sandwich the &quot;McJordan&quot;.

He scored his first Hollywood job in 1987, writing for the NBC comedy &quot;A Different World&quot;, on which he had a small guest role in the season five finale. During 1991–92, Jones penned the Fox series &quot;Roc&quot; and, in 1993, he co-produced &quot;The Sinbad Show&quot;. He also made a brief appearance on the FOX sitcom &quot;Herman&#x27;s Head&quot; in 1992.

==Career==

===MADtv===
After hosting Fox&#x27;s music series &quot;Sound FX&quot;, in 1994, Jones became one of the original nine cast members of &quot;MADtv&quot;. Unlike some of his fellow original repertory performers on &quot;MADtv&quot;, Jones came to the show with limited sketch comedy experience.

Throughout the first two seasons of &quot;MADtv&quot;, Jones performed as characters like the Cabana Chat band leader Dexter St. Croix and Reverend LaMont Nixon Fatback, the vocal follower of Christopher Walken. He was also noted for his impressions of Thomas Mikal Ford, Temuera Morrison, Warwick Davis, Danny DeVito, Michael Jai White, Eddie Griffin, and Ice Cube.

After two seasons on &quot;MADtv&quot;, Jones left the show to pursue a movie career. However, Jones returned to &quot;MADtv&quot; in 2004 to celebrate its 200th episode.

===Other television projects===
Aside from &quot;MADtv&quot;, Jones made many other television appearances. Perhaps his most popular and enduring television appearance was in a series of humorous commercials as the spokesperson for 7 Up where he gained wide recognition. Notably, one commercial had him wear a t-shirt that had 7 Up&#x27;s then-slogan &quot;Make 7 Up Yours&quot; divided between the front and back with the double entendre on the back that featured the &quot;Up Yours&quot; part; 7 Up would sell the shirt through specialty retailer Spencer Gifts for many years.

This exposure led to a plethora of opportunities for Jones. First, he hosted an &quot;HBO First Look&quot; special in 2000 and then, in 2003, was given his own late night talk show on FX called &quot;The Orlando Jones Show&quot;. Although his talk show was short lived, Jones continued to make additional television appearances. In 2003, he appeared on &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot; and on &quot;Girlfriends&quot;. In 2006, Jones decided to return to television as one of the lead characters of ABC&#x27;s crime drama &quot;The Evidence&quot;, as Cayman Bishop. He has also appeared in two episodes of &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot;, the first in 2007 as Chris&#x27;s substitute teacher and the second in 2008 as Clint Huckstable, an allusion to the character Cliff Huxtable played by Bill Cosby on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;.

In 2008, he appeared as Harold Wilcox, a violent veteran with PTSD, on &quot;New Amsterdam&quot;. In the first season of the show, Jones also starred on &quot;Wild &#x27;N Out&quot;. Jones was the first guest star on the show. Jones was the co-host of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Crash Course&quot; (which was canceled after 4 episodes). On November 16, 2009, it was announced in &quot;TV Guide&quot; that Jones had been cast as Marcus Foreman, Eric Foreman&#x27;s brother on &quot;House&quot;, appearing in the season six episode &quot;Moving the Chains&quot;. In 2013, he was hired as a principal actor in the FOX television series &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;. The freshman drama opened to FOX&#x27;s highest fall drama premiere numbers since the premiere of &quot;24&quot; in 2001.

From 2016 through 2019, Jones portrayed Mr. Nancy, aka the African god Anansi, in the Starz series &quot;American Gods&quot;.

===Film projects===
After leaving &quot;MADtv&quot;, Jones expanded his cinema resume. He appeared in a bit part in his first big screen film, &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot; (1997), then joined Larry David in the feature &quot;Sour Grapes&quot; (1998), playing the character of an itinerant man. Subsequently, he appeared in &quot;Woo&quot; (1998), Mike Judge&#x27;s &quot;Office Space&quot; (1999), alongside fellow &quot;MADtv&quot; alumnus David Herman, and in Barry Levinson&#x27;s praised drama, &quot;Liberty Heights&quot; (1999). Since then, Jones has appeared in &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999), &quot;New Jersey Turnpikes&quot; (1999) and in Harold Ramis&#x27; &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (2000).

During the 2000s, Jones&#x27; career began to branch out. In addition to his appearances in the 7 Up campaigns, Jones played the role of Clifford Franklin in &quot;The Replacements&quot; (2000) and the horror film &quot;From Dusk till Dawn 3: The Hangman&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2003). In 2002, Jones landed the lead role of Daryl Chase in the action-dramedy &quot;Double Take&quot; (2001), alongside Eddie Griffin, and worked with David Duchovny, Seann William Scott and Julianne Moore in Ivan Reitman&#x27;s sci-fi comedy, &quot;Evolution&quot; (2001). Jones was also in the 2009 film &quot;Cirque du Freak: The Vampire&#x27;s Assistant&quot; and he appeared as the computer Vox 114 in &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (2002). His other more recent films includes &quot;Drumline&quot; (2002), &quot;Biker Boyz&quot; (2003), &quot;Runaway Jury&quot; (2003) and &quot;Primeval&quot; (2007). Jones appeared in an uncredited cameo and played in &quot;Grindhouse Planet Terror&quot; (2007).

In 2011 Jones appeared in the documentary film &quot;Looking for Lenny&quot;, in which he talks about Lenny Bruce and freedom of speech. In 2012, Jones starred in Joe Penna&#x27;s original interactive thriller series &quot;Meridian&quot; created in conjunction with Fourth Wall Studios.

In April 2013, Jones reported that he would be taking Tyler Perry&#x27;s place as Madea, and posted a photograph of himself impersonating the character, causing some outcry among Madea fans. However, this was later revealed to be a prank played by Jones; Perry stated &quot;That was an April Fools&#x27; joke that &quot;HE&quot; did. Not true. And not funny. When I&#x27;m done with Madea, she is done.&quot;

===Voice acting===
Jones has been featured in many voice acting projects over the years. In 1993, he appeared in &quot;Yuletide in the &#x27;hood&quot; and in 1998, he made a guest appearance in the animated comedy TV series, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. He then lent his voice to two more animated TV series, &quot;Father of the Pride&quot; and &quot;Yin Yang Yo!&quot;, as well as the video games &quot;Halo 2&quot; (where he voiced Marine Sergeant Banks and other black marines) and &quot;L.A. Rush&quot;. In 2006, he co-created, produced and voice acted for the MTV2 animated series &quot;The Adventures of Chico and Guapo&quot;.

==Personal life==
Jones married former model Jacqueline Staph in 2009. They have a daughter. 

In October 2011, Jones provoked controversy when he joked on Twitter that someone should kill former Governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. He apologized for the comment several days later.

<text>Russell Reid is a retired consultant psychiatrist who specialized in sexual and gender-related conditions. He is particularly known for his work with gender identity disorder patients. Richard Curtis took over his practice after his retirement. Reid grew up in New Zealand and worked privately in the United Kingdom. Britain&#x27;s best-known expert on gender reassignment, he was a member of the parliamentary forum on transsexualism.

In 2006–2007, Reid was investigated by the General Medical Council (GMC), the regulatory body for doctors in the UK. A serious professional misconduct hearing opened following complaints brought by four doctors from the main NHS Gender Identity Clinic at Charing Cross hospital, west London, and some of his former patients. It is alleged that he breached international standards of care, set by the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (HBIGDA) by inappropriately prescribing cross-gender hormones to patients and referring them for sex reassignment surgery without adequate assessment.

Britain&#x27;s primary lobbying organization for transgender and transsexual people, Press for Change, was quoted as saying that Reid received support during the process from more than 150 patients as well as additional experts in the area. Ultimately, the enquiry found Reid guilty of Serious Professional Misconduct, mostly for failing to communicate fully with patients GPs and not documenting his reasons for departing from the HBIGDA Standards of Care guidelines sufficiently. However, the panel &quot;determined that it would be in the public interest as well as your own interests if you were to return to practice under strict conditions.&quot; and allowed him to return to practice, subject to some restrictions on his practice and hormone prescriptions for the next 12 months.

Reid was a member of an expert committee set up by the Royal College of Psychiatrists to draw up new UK care guidelines on the treatment of Gender identity disorder. He stepped down as a member of the group in the wake of the GMC inquiry.

Reid was also interviewed as part of a BBC documentary, &quot;Complete Obsession&quot;, dealing with patients seeking limb amputations.

<text>David Terrell Reid (born September 17, 1973) is a former boxer from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==Amateur career==
Reid had a stellar amateur boxing career, culminating with a come-from-behind, one-punch knock out win to secure a gold medal at the 1996 summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. This followed Reid&#x27;s title victory a year earlier at the 1995 Pan American Games in Mar del Plata. Because he was, like Oscar De La Hoya four years before, the only Olympic gold medalist in boxing for the United States, comparisons by writers and critics to de la Hoya were practically inevitable. De la Hoya&#x27;s nickname is &quot;The Golden Boy&quot;; Reid was dubbed as &quot;The American Dream&quot;.

===Amateur highlights===
*1993 National Golden Gloves Welterweight champion
*1994 United States Amateur Welterweight champion
*1996 United States Amateur Light middleweight champion
*Won the Light Middleweight gold medal for the United States at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, United States. His results were:
*Defeated Wan-Kyun Lee (South Korea) 20-4
*Defeated Pavol Polakovič (Czech Republic) 12-5
*Defeated Mohamed Marmouri (Tunisia) 13-8
*Defeated Karim Tulaganov (Uzbekistan) 12-4
*Defeated Alfredo Duvergel (Cuba) KO 3 (0:36)

==Pro career==
Reid began his professional career, with much attention from boxing magazines, when he defeated Sam Calderon on March 21, 1997, by a unanimous four round decision, in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

He followed his debut victory with four knockout wins in a row, before meeting former world Welterweight champion Jorge Vaca, on October 3 of the same year, also at Atlantic City. He knocked Vaca out in the first round.

His next bout, against Dan Conolly, was showcased on HBO Boxing, and it was also covered, round by round, by &quot;The Ring&quot;. Reid earned his sixth victory in a row, knocking out Conolly (who was described by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine as a &quot;game opponent&quot;) in five rounds.

On January 31, 1998, he dropped Robert Frazier in the first round. Despite losing a point in round six due to what the referee thought was dirty tactics, Reid went on to beat Frazier by an eight round unanimous decision.

After two more wins, he faced former world champion Simon Brown, knocking him out in four rounds on June 27, at Reid&#x27;s hometown. On October 24, he claimed his first belt, defeating James Cocker by a twelve round unanimous decision, to win the WBC&#x27;s Continental Americas light middleweight title.

===WBA light middleweight champion===

After that victory, he was deemed as ready for a world title try by his management team, and so, on March 6, 1999, Reid became a world champion in only his tenth professional bout (making him one of the boxers to win a world title in the fastest time, also like the second Davey Moore), by beating WBA light middleweight champion Laurent Boudouani by a twelve round unanimous decision in Atlantic City.

Reid would defend his title successfully twice, one of them, a twelve round unanimous decision over Keith Mullings in Las Vegas.

By then, Reid had already made Las Vegas his new home. There was much talk about facing him against a number of opponents, including Roy Jones Jr., Bernard Hopkins, De La Hoya and Félix Trinidad.

===Trinidad vs Reid Bout===

The only fight out of those four possible match-ups came on March 3, 2000, when he defended his crown against Trinidad in Las Vegas. Reid enjoyed some advantage during the first six rounds, having dropped Trinidad in the third, and with the fight being close on all three judges&#x27; scorecards. He was dropped in round seven, however, and subsequently suffered a detached retina and three more knockdowns in round eleven, before losing the world title by a twelve round unanimous decision.

Many fans then questioned his management&#x27;s judgment by letting Reid defend his title against a veteran like Trinidad in only his fifteenth professional bout, a fact that reminded many of the case of the second Davey Moore 17 years before, when he defended the same WBA title, in only his thirteenth bout, against the far more experienced, boxing hall of famer Roberto Durán. Many critics say that the reason for Reid&#x27;s falldown after his defeat to Trinidad could be due to a psychological break-down, but the fact is that his detached retina affected him for the rest of his short career.

==Professional boxing record==


==Retirement==
He returned to the boxing ring for four bouts. He won three fights against insignificant opposition, then lost to Sam Hill by a knockout in nine rounds, in what would turn out to be his last bout, on November 11, 2001, at Elizabeth, Indiana. His retina was causing him more trouble, and he retired before losing his eyesight. Reid had first suffered an eye injury in the 1995 Olympic Trials, and after several surgeries as a professional, he continued to suffer from ptosis.

<text>Cultural diplomacy is a type of soft power that includes the &quot;exchange of ideas, information, art, language and other aspects of culture among nations and their peoples in order to foster mutual understanding&quot;. The purpose of cultural diplomacy is for the people of a foreign nation to develop an understanding of the nation&#x27;s ideals and institutions in an effort to build broad support for economic and political objectives. In essence &quot;cultural diplomacy reveals the soul of a nation&quot;, which in turn creates influence. Public diplomacy has played an important role in advancing national security objectives.

== Definition ==
In a 2006 article in the &quot;Brown Journal of World Affairs&quot;, Cynthia P. Schneider wrote: &quot;Public diplomacy consists of all a nation does to explain itself to the world, and cultural diplomacy – the use of creative expression and exchanges of ideas, information, and people to increase mutual understanding – supplies much of its content.&quot;

Culture is a set of values and practices that creates meaning for society. This includes both high culture (literature, art, and education, which appeals to elites) and popular culture (appeals to the masses). This is what governments seek to show foreign audiences when engaging in cultural diplomacy. It is a type of soft power, which is the &quot;ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion or payments. It arises from a country&#x27;s culture, political ideals and policies.&quot; This indicates that the value of culture is its ability to attract foreigners to a nation. Cultural diplomacy is also a component of public diplomacy. Public diplomacy is enhanced by a larger society and culture, but simultaneously public diplomacy helps to &quot;amplify and advertise that society and culture to the world at large&quot;. It could be argued that the information component of public diplomacy can only be fully effective where there is already a relationship that gives credibility to the information being relayed. This comes from knowledge of the other&#x27;s culture. Cultural diplomacy has been called the &quot;linchpin of public diplomacy&quot; because cultural activities have the potential to demonstrate the best of a nation.

Richard T. Arndt, a former State Department cultural diplomacy practitioner, said: &quot;Cultural relations grow naturally and organically, without government intervention – the transactions of trade and tourism, student flows, communications, book circulation, migration, media access, inter-marriage – millions of daily cross-cultural encounters. If that is correct, cultural diplomacy can only be said to take place when formal diplomats, serving national governments, try to shape and channel this natural flow to advance national interests.&quot; It is important to note that, while cultural diplomacy is, as indicated above, a government activity, the private sector has a very real role to play because the government does not create culture, therefore, it can only attempt to make a culture known and define the impact this organic growth will have on national policies. Cultural diplomacy attempts to manage the international environment by utilizing these sources and achievements and making them known abroad. An important aspect of this is listening- cultural diplomacy is meant to be a two-way exchange. This exchange is then intended to foster a mutual understanding and thereby win influence within the target nation. Cultural diplomacy derives its credibility not from being close to government institutions, but from its proximity to cultural authorities.

== Objectives ==

Ultimately, the goal of cultural diplomacy is to influence a foreign audience and use that influence, which is built up over the long term, as a good will reserve to win support for policies. It seeks to harness the elements of culture to induce foreigners to:
* have a positive view of the country&#x27;s people, culture and policies,
* induce greater cooperation between the two nations,
* aid in changing the policies or political environment of the target nation,
* prevent, manage and mitigate conflict with the target nation.

In turn, cultural diplomacy can help a nation better understand the foreign nation it is engaged with and it fosters mutual understanding. Cultural diplomacy is a way of conducting international relations without expecting anything in return in the way that traditional diplomacy typically expects. Cultural exchange programs work as a medium to relay a favourable impression of the foreign country in order to gain outsiders&#x27; understanding and approval in their cultural practices and naturalize their social norms among other cultures.

Generally, cultural diplomacy is more focused on the longer term and less on specific policy matters. The intent is to build up influence over the long term for when it is needed by engaging people directly. This influence has implications ranging from national security to increasing tourism and commercial opportunities. It allows the government to create a &quot;foundation of trust&quot; and a mutual understanding that is neutral and built on people-to-people contact. Another unique and important element of cultural diplomacy is its ability to reach youth, non-elites and other audiences outside of the traditional embassy circuit. In short, cultural diplomacy plants the seeds of ideals, ideas, political arguments, spiritual perceptions and a general view point of the world that may or may not flourish in a foreign nation. Therefore, ideologies spread by cultural diplomacy about American values enables those that seek a better life to look towards the Western world where happiness and freedom are portrayed as desirable and achievable goals.

== Connections to national security ==
Cultural diplomacy is a demonstration of national power because it demonstrates to foreign audiences every aspect of culture, including wealth, scientific and technological advances, competitiveness in everything from sports and industry to military power, and a nation&#x27;s overall confidence. The perception of power has important implications for a nation&#x27;s ability to ensure its security. Furthermore, because cultural diplomacy includes political and ideological arguments, and uses the language of persuasion and advocacy, it can be used as an instrument of political warfare and be useful in achieving traditional goals of war. A Chinese activist was quoted as saying &quot;We&#x27;ve seen a lot of Hollywood movies – they feature weddings, funerals and going to court. So now we think it&#x27;s only natural to go to court a few times in your life.&quot;

In terms of policy that supports national security goals, the information revolution has created an increasingly connected world in which public perceptions of values and motivations can create an enabling or disabling environment in the quest for international support of policies. The struggle to affect important international developments is increasingly about winning the information struggle to define the interpretation of states&#x27; actions. If an action is not interpreted abroad as the nation meant to it be, then the action itself can become meaningless.

Participants in cultural diplomacy often have insights into foreign attitudes that official embassy employees do not. This can be used to better understand a foreign nation&#x27;s intentions and capabilities. It can also be used to counter hostile propaganda and the collection of open-source intelligence.

==Tools and examples==

Cultural diplomacy relies on a variety of mediums, including:
* Arts including films, dance, music, painting, sculpture, among others.
* Exhibitions which offer the potential to showcase numerous objects of culture
* Educational programs such as universities and language programs abroad
* Exchanges – scientific, artistic, educational etc.
* Literature – the establishment of libraries abroad and translation of popular and national works
* Broadcasting of news and cultural programs
* Gifts to a nation, which demonstrates thoughtfulness and respect
* Religious diplomacy, including inter-religious dialogue
* Promotion and explanation of ideas and social policies
* Goodwill tours

All of these tools seek to bring understanding of a nation&#x27;s culture to foreign audiences. They work best when they are proven to be relevant to the target audience. The tools can be utilized by working through NGOs, diasporas and political parties abroad, which may help with the challenge of relevance and understanding.

=== Arts ===
In the 1950s the Soviet Union had a reputation that was associated with peace, international class solidarity and progress due to its sponsorship of local revolutionary movements for liberation. The United States was known for its involvement in the Korean War and for preserving the status quo. In an effort to change this perception, the United States Information Agency (USIA) sponsored a photographic exhibition titled The Family of Man. The display originally showed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, but then USIA helped the display to be seen in 91 locations in 39 countries. The 503 photographs by 237 professional and amateur photographers were curated and put together by Edward Steichen. The images showed glimpses of everyday human life in its various stages; courtship, birth, parenting, work, self-expression, etc., including images from the Great Depression. The images were multi-cultured and only a few were overtly political serving to show the eclecticism and diversity of American culture, which is America&#x27;s soft power foundation. The display was extremely popular and attracted large numbers of crowds, in short America &quot;showed the world, the world and got credit for it&quot;.

A similar effort was carried out by the United States Department of State in February 2002 entitled Images from Ground Zero. The display included 27 images, detailing the September 11 attacks by Joel Meyerowitz that circulated, with the backing of embassies and consulates, to 60 nations. The display was intended to shape and maintain the public memory of the attack and its aftermath. The display sought to show the human side of the tragedy, and not just the destruction of buildings. The display was also intended to show a story of recovery and resolution through documenting not only the grief and pain, but also the recovery efforts. In many countries where the display was run, it was personalized for the population. For example, relatives of those who died in the Towers were often invited to the event openings.

=== Dance ===
The positioning of the performing arts throughout history shows that dance was a tool for showing power, promoting national pride, and maintaining international relations. During the Cold War, the plot and choreography choices used in dance demonstrated Socialist vs. Capitalist values. Through this, countries were able to share their ideas. In 1955, the United States state department sent the Martha Graham Dance Company to many countries affected by the Cold War. Some of these countries included Burma, India, Pakistan, Japan, the Philippines, and Thailand which were all a concern to the United States because they could be easily lost to Communism as predicted in Eisenhower&#x27;s Domino Theory. The choreography mixed Asian aesthetics with American values, creating an innovative performance that showed what the United States and a capitalist society was capable of producing. Her performances were received with praise and repositioned the image of the United States in the eyes of the international community.

Cultural diplomacy through the arts was also used by the Soviet Union due to the high value they placed on culture and the belief it could unite people. The &quot;New Soviet Man&quot; was expected to have an understanding of the arts and be able to contribute to society. In 1959, the Soviet Union decided to send one of its highly regarded ballet companies, the Bolshoi, to tour the United States. Their goal was to demonstrate the artistic and physical abilities of their citizens. The repertoire included Romeo and Juliet, Swan Lake, Giselle, and The Stone Flower. There were also two mixed bills that included both pre and post-revolutionary content. Swan Lake and its composer, P. I. Tchaikovsky, were considered Russian classics that fit into Marxist ideology and were therefore accepted in the Communist repertoire. Other classic ballets were redesigned to demonstrate this ideology. While Americans were extremely excited to see the ballets and praised the ballerinas, the repertoire was not received as well. This was a tool critics used to express the joy of seeing the ballet company while critiquing Soviet politics. The complaint that Communism was an old-fashioned ideology was given life as most of the ballets performed were classical pieces. Dance produced in the United States, for example Balanchine and Martha Graham, was seen as modern with an individualistic style.

A later example of dance during the Cold War was the Soviet Union and the United States exchanging ballet companies for a time in order to improve cultural relations. In October 1962, the New York City Ballet (NYCB) toured the Soviet Union. In New York City, the Bolshoi was performing Spartacus by Aram Khachaturian. This ballet was meant to excite American audiences and prove that the Soviet Union could produce new, action-packed performances. The Soviet Union&#x27;s creation was still not considered innovative because the Hollywood film Spartacus by Stanley Kubrick had been released prior to this performance. At the same time, seventeen ballets by George Balanchine, who is considered a very influential figure in American ballet though he was born in Russia, were being performed in the Soviet Union. Once again ballet was used to showcase artistry and power while bettering international affairs. Many factors made this tour a pinnacle in Cold war exchanges. The tour occurred at the same time as the Cuban Missile Crisis. Also, NYCB making an appearance in the Soviet Union was questionable because reviews of Balanchine&#x27;s ballets had been censored. Instead of feelings of hostility, the company received a warm welcome. Both the United States and the Soviet Union agreed with Balanchine&#x27;s decision to emphasize music throughout his choreography. There was still a fundamental disagreement to this as Balanchine often declared that music has no meaning and Soviet society did not have the same ideology. Because each company&#x27;s ballets were being judged with preconceived notions about society and the arts, opinions clashed and interpretations were different. The United States was mainly known for producing abstract modern pieces which align with Capitalist and individualistic thinking. On the other hand, the Soviet Union was producing narrative ballets which were meant to reeducate citizens and emphasize the importance of society. These exchanges were also seen as a battle between Capitalism and Communism, with each showing off its values and power. These are only a few examples of dance being used to showcase artistry and power while bettering international affairs.

=== Exhibitions ===

Exhibitions were often used during the Cold War to demonstrate culture and progress by both the United States and the Soviet Union.
In 1959, the American National Exhibition was held on Sokolniki Park in Moscow. The exhibition was opened by Vice President Richard Nixon and attended by Walt Disney, Buckminster Fuller, William Randolph Hearst, and senior executives from Pepsi, Kodak and Macy&#x27;s. It featured American consumer goods, cars, boats, RCA color TVs, food, clothing, etc., and samples of American products such as Pepsi. There was a typical American kitchen set up inside in which spectators could watch a Bird&#x27;s Eye frozen meal be prepared. An IBM RAMAC computer was programmed to answer 3,500 questions about America in Russian. The most popular question was &quot;what is the meaning of the American Dream?&quot; The Soviets tried to limit the audience by only giving tickets to party members and setting up their own rival exhibition. But ultimately people came, and the souvenir pins that were given out turned up in every corner of the country. The Soviets banned printed material, but the Americans gave it out anyway. The most popular items were the Bible and a Sears catalogue. The guides for the exhibition were American graduate students, including African Americans and women, who spoke Russian.
This gave Russians the ability to speak to real Americans and ask difficult questions. The ambassador to Moscow, Llewellyn Thompson, commented that &quot;the exhibition would be &#x27;worth more to us than five new battleships.&quot;

===Exchanges===

The usefulness of exchanges is based on two assumptions- some form of political intent lies behind the exchange and the result will have some sort of political effect. The idea is that exchanges will create a network of influential people abroad that will tie them to their host country and will appreciate their host country more due to their time spent there. Exchanges generally take place at a young age, giving the host country the opportunity to create an attachment and gain influence at a young impressionable age.

An example of exchanges is the United States&#x27; Fulbright Program.

The US and Soviet Union hosted a range of educational exchange programs during the Cold War.

===TV, music, film===

Popular entertainment is a statement about the society which it is portraying. These cultural displays can carry important messages regarding individualism, consumer choices and other values. For example, Soviet audiences watching American films learned that Americans owned their own cars, did not have to stand in long lines to purchase food, and did not live in communal apartments. These observations were not intended to be political messages when Hollywood created the films, but they nonetheless carried them.

Cultural programming featuring Latin Jazz music and the Bolero was already recognized by the United States Department of State as an important diplomatic tool during the World War II period. In the early 1940s, Nelson Rockefeller at the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs collaborated with Edmund A. Chester of the CBS to showcase leading musicians from both North and South America for audiences on both continents. Musical artists such as Alfredo Antonini, Terig Tucci, John Serry Sr., Miguel Sandoval, Juan Arvizu, Elsa Miranda, Eva Garza, Manuolita Arriola, Kate Smith and Nestor Mesta Chayres participated in this truly international effort to foster peace throughout the Americas through shared musical performances &quot;(See Viva América)&quot;.

In the post World War II era, the United States Army also acknowledged the importance of cultural programming as a valuable diplomatic tool amidst the ruins in Europe. In 1952 the U.S. Seventh Army enlisted the expertise of the young conductor Samuel Adler to establish the Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra in Stuttgart, Germany in order to demonstrate the shared cultural heritage of America and Europe. Performances of classical music by the orchestra continued throughout Europe until 1962. They showcased the talents of several noted conductors and musicians including: James Dixon, John Ferritto, Henry Lewis and Kenneth Schermerhorn.

As the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union escalated in the 1950s, the Department of State also supported the performance of classical music as an indispensable diplomatic tool. With this in mind, President Dwight D. Eisenhower established an Emergency Fund for International Affairs in 1954 to stimulate the presentation of America&#x27;s cultural achievements to international audiences in the realms of dance, theatre and music. In 1954, the State Department&#x27;s Cultural Presentations program established a cooperative relationship with the Music Advisory Panel of the American National Theatre and Academy (ANTA) to evaluate potential musical performers who could best represent America at performance venues throughout the world. Members of the advisory panel included such noted American composers and academics as: Virgil Thomson, Howard Hanson at the Eastman School of Music, William Schuman at the Juilliard School, Milton Katims, and the music critic Alfred Frankenstein. In addition, the State Department selected Hanson&#x27;s Eastman Philharmonia Orchestra to perform during a sweeping international cultural exchange tour in 1961. Concert performances by this elite group of students from the Eastman School of Music were received to critical acclaim by enthusiastic audiences in thirty four cities in sixteen countries throughout Europe, the Middle East and Russia. Similarly, the bass-baritone William Warfield was recruited by the Department of State to perform in six separate European tours during the 1950s which featured productions of the opera Porgy and Bess

Jazz played a critical role during the Cold War in establishing political ties. Producer Willis Conover explained jazz as an embodiment of an anti-ideology or an alternative way of living by introducing a new style of music with a loose structure and improvisation. In November 1955, &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared Louis Armstrong as America&#x27;s most effective ambassador. What American diplomats could not do, Armstrong and his jazz music did. This article claimed that musicians, such as Armstrong, created a universal language to communicate.

Jazz originally surfaced in the Soviet Union during the 1920s and 1930s, but quickly faded. After World War II, jazz began to reemerge, but was condemned by Andrei Zhdanov. He considered jazz as corrupt and capitalistic due to the fact that it grew out of the United States during a time of political unrest. During the 1950s to 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement, the decolonization of Africa and Asia, and the cultural and political rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union created the need for cultural exchange. As a result, the United States government sent a jazz band composed of African American musicians abroad to tour places, including the Middle East and Africa, with the goal of the black musicians establishing connections with their African heritage.

Duke Ellington, B.B. King, and Dizzy Gillespie all made trips to Africa that fostered connections with the African diaspora. In 1956, Dizzy Gillespie took on the role as a musical ambassador during his trip to the Middle East. He reported to President Eisenhower that he and his jazz band were effective against Red propaganda. With their interracial group, the jazz band was able to communicate across social and language barriers. During the band&#x27;s trip to Athens, Greece, a performance transformed an audience of Anti-American students angered by the U.S. stance on Greece&#x27;s right-wing dictatorship. By the end of the performance, Gillespie said the audience loved the music and threw him up on their shoulders after the performance. Diplomats emphasized the positive effects of musical diplomacy on the public.

From 1955 to 1996, jazz producer Willis Conover hosted a music program called &quot;Music USA,&quot; for the Voice of America to assist in the emergence of jazz musicians as U.S. ambassadors. Conover explained: &quot;Jazz is a cross between total discipline and anarchy,&quot; for the way the musicians agree on tempo, key, and chord, but is distinguishable by its freedom of expression. As many as thirty million listeners worldwide, including millions in the Soviet Union, listened to the forty-five minutes of pop music and forty-five minutes of jazz with a newscast preceding each. Many critics have stated that Conover&#x27;s program played a major role in the resurgence of jazz within the Soviet Union after the WWII.

The effect The Beatles had in Russia during the Cold War is an example of how music artists and their songs can become political. During this time, rock music channelled liberal &quot;Western&quot; ideas as a progressive and modernized art form. The Beatles symbolized the Western culture in a way that introduced new ideas that many believe assisted in the collapse of communism. As a result, the Beatles served as cultural diplomats through their popularity in the Soviet Union. Their music fostered youth communication and united people with a common spirit of popular culture.

Kolya Vasin, the founder of The Beatles museum and the Temple of Love, Peace and Music in St. Petersburg, commented that The Beatles &quot;were like an integrity test. When anyone said anything against them, we knew just what that person was worth. The authorities, our teachers, even our parents, became idiots to us.&quot; Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union&#x27;s government to prevent the spread of the Beatles&#x27; popularity amongst their citizens, the band proved to be as popular in the USSR as it was in Britain. The government went as far as censoring the expression of all Western ideals, including the Beatles&#x27; bourgeois eccentricity, limiting the Soviet citizens&#x27; access to their music. Leslie Woodland, a documentary film maker, commented regarding what the Russian people were told about the West – &quot;Once people heard the Beatles&#x27; wonderful music, it just didn&#x27;t fit. The authorities&#x27; prognosis didn&#x27;t correspond to what they were listening to. The system was built on fear and lies, and in this way, the Beatles put an end to the fear, and exposed the lies.&quot; Pavel Palazchenko, Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s conference interpreter, stated that the Beatles&#x27; music was a &quot;source of musical relief. They helped us create a world of our own, a world different from the dull and senseless ideological liturgy that increasingly reminded me of Stalinism...&quot;. Like Gorbachev, many Russian youth agreed that the Beatles were a way to overcome the cultural isolation imposed by the Cold War and reinforced by their current political system.

In this way the music of The Beatles struck a political chord in the Soviet Union, even when the songs were not meant to be political.
This contact went both ways. In 1968, when the song &quot;Back in the USSR&quot; was released, the album included a quote on the cover from Paul McCartney that read &quot;In releasing this record, made especially and exclusively for the USSR, I am extending a hand of peace and friendship to the Soviet people.&quot; During Paul McCartney&#x27;s first trip to Russia in May 2003, nearly half a million fans greeted him. One Russian critic reported, &quot;The only person in Red Square who wasn&#x27;t moved was Lenin&quot;. This is an example of how products of culture can have an influence on the people they reach outside of their own country. It also shows how a private citizen can unintentionally become a cultural ambassador of sorts.

In September 2023, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken launched the Global Music Diplomacy Initiative in partnership with The Recording Academy at the U.S. Department of State.

There are growing calls for Australia to strengthen its music diplomacy activities.

=== Food ===
The US Embassy in Beijing leveraged food as a tool of diplomacy in 2023, when its public affairs section collected lunch photos from officers posted across the country and created a &quot;photo montage video titled &quot;What American Diplomats Have for Lunch,&quot; which became one of the most-viewed and most-engaged posts on its WeChat and Weibo accounts.

===Place branding===

This Image and reputation has become an essential part of a &quot;state&#x27;s strategic equity&quot;. Place branding is &quot;the totality of the thoughts, feelings, associations and expectations that come to mind when a prospect or consumer is exposed to an entity&#x27;s name, logo, products, services, events, or any design or symbol representing them.&quot; Place branding is required to make a country&#x27;s image acceptable for investment, tourism, political power, etc. As Joseph Nye commented, &quot;in an information age, it is often the side which has the better side of the story that wins&quot;, this has resulted in a shift from old style diplomacy to encompass brand building and reputation management. In short, a country can use its culture to create a brand for itself which represents positive values and image.

===Museum diplomacy===
Museum diplomacy is a subset of cultural diplomacy concerned with museums and the cultural artifacts they exhibit. This can take the form of building/supporting museums, gifting art/antiquities, and travelling exhibitions.

France has led the way in using the return on art and artifacts looted during their colonial past to its home country for diplomatic means.

In 1974, People&#x27;s Republic of China organized its first archaeological exhibition in the United States, &quot;The Exhibition of Archaeological Finds of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;, held at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. during the Cold War. This exhibition, showcasing 385 artifacts, was a strategic act of cultural diplomacy, aimed at improving China–United States relations while also promoting China&#x27;s state ideology.

=== Panda diplomacy ===
China has been using panda diplomacy to advance its national interests.

=== Goodwill tours ===
A goodwill tour is a tour by someone or something famous to a series of places, with the purpose of expressing benevolent interest or concern for a group of people or a region, improving or maintaining a relationship between parties, and exhibiting the item or person to places visited.

Goodwill tours are meant to be friendly; however, in some cases, they may be intimidating to the people or the government at the place visited. At the same time, a visit by a goodwill tour might be used as a way of &quot;reminding&quot; the place and government visited of a friendship previously established or assumed.

Notable goodwill tours include the Latin America goodwill tour by President-elect Herbert Hoover in November–December 1928, the goodwill tour to Japan by the San Francisco Seals (baseball) in 1949,Jacqueline Kennedy&#x27;s 1962 goodwill tour of India and Pakistan, and the worldwide GIANTSTEP-APOLLO 11 Presidential Goodwill Tour by the Apollo 11 astronauts in 1969.

== Complications ==

Cultural diplomacy presents a number of unique challenges to any government attempting to carry out cultural diplomacy programs. Most ideas that a foreign population observes are not in the government&#x27;s control. The government does not usually produce the books, music, films, TV programs, consumer products, etc. that reaches an audience. The most the government can do is try to work to create openings so the message can get through to mass audiences abroad. To be cultural relevant in the age of globalization, a government must exercise control over the flows of information and communication technologies, including trade. This is also difficult for governments that operate in a free market society where the government does not control the bulk of information flows. What the government can do is work to protect cultural exports where they flourish, by utilizing trade agreements or gaining access for foreign telecommunication networks.

It is also possible that foreign government officials may oppose or resist certain cultural exports while the people cheer them on. This can make support for official policies difficult to obtain. Cultural activities may be both a blessing and a curse to a nation. This may be the case if certain elements of a culture are offensive to the foreign audience. Certain cultural activities can also undermine national policy objectives. An example of this was the very public American dissent to the Iraq War while official government policy still supported it. Simultaneously the prevalence of the protest may have attracted some foreigners to the openness of America.

<text>Bernhard Baron (5 December 1850 – 1 August 1929) was a tobacco manufacturer and philanthropist.

He was born in Brest-Litovsk in the Russian Empire (now in Belarus), to Jewish parents. He lived in Rostov as a child, and immigrated to the United States at an early age with his father. Following work at a tobacco factory in the United States, and time spent making cigarettes by hand, he invented a cigarette-making machine. From 1890 to 1895 he was managing director of the National Cigarette Tobacco Company of New York, which he had set up with the backing of a group of financiers to challenge the powerful tobacco trusts.

In 1895 he visited England to sell the patent rights to his cigarette machine. However, he was attracted by the commercial opportunities and moved to England, where he established the Baron Cigarette Machine Company Limited in Aldgate, London. The patent was later sold to the United Cigarette Machine Company for £120,000. He expanded into the production of cigarettes and tobacco and in 1903 he joined the board of the Carreras Tobacco Company, becoming its managing director in 1904 and chairman in 1905. He retained these posts until his death.

Following his business success he engaged in philanthropy, focusing on hospitals and hospital patients, including the creation of a trust. Amongst the projects supported by the trust was a cradle-to-grave school in the East End of London, originally established as the St George&#x27;s Jewish Settlement and run by Basil Henriques and Rose Henriques. With a capacity of over 1,000 pupils it provided everything from kindergarten to adult literacy classes. The school building at 71 Henriques Street in Shadwell is now named Bernhard Baron House and has been converted to flats.

While living in the US he married Rachel Schwartz of Washington, who died in 1920. They had three daughters and one son. His son Louis succeeded him as chairman of Carreras and was created a baronet in 1930.

Bernhard Baron died at Brighton in 1920, and his estate was valued at £5 million.

<doc id="1204548" wikidata="Q566910" url="?curid=1204548" title="Hartz concept">
<text>The Hartz concept, also known as Hartz reforms or the Hartz plan, is a set of recommendations submitted by a committee on reforms to the German labour market in 2002. Named after the head of the committee, Peter Hartz, these recommendations went on to become part of the German government&#x27;s &quot;Agenda 2010&quot; series of reforms, known as Hartz I – Hartz IV. The committee devised thirteen &quot;innovation modules&quot;, which recommended changes to the German labour market system. These were then gradually put into practice: The measures of Hartz I – III were undertaken between 1 January 2003, and 2004, while Hartz IV was implemented on 1 January 2005.

The &quot;Hartz Committee&quot; was founded on 22 February 2002, by the federal government of Germany led then by Gerhard Schröder. Its official name was &quot;Kommission für moderne Dienstleistungen am Arbeitsmarkt&quot; (Committee for Modern Services in the Labour Market). The 15-member committee was chaired by Peter Hartz, then Volkswagen&#x27;s personnel director. 

In 2023, the Hartz concept was replaced by the Citizens’ Basic Income (Bürgergeld).

==Hartz I, II, and III==
Hartz I and II both came into effect on 1 January 2003, aiming at making new types of jobs easier to create, and covered, for example:

Hartz I
*The foundation of &quot;Staff Services agencies&quot; (&quot;Personal-Service-Agenturen&quot; or PSAs).
*Support for vocational further education from the German Federal Labour Agency.
*Subsistence payments by the Federal Labour Agency.

Hartz II
*New types of employment, Mini job and Midi job, with lower or gradually rising taxes and insurance payments.
*A grant for entrepreneurs, known as the &quot;Ich-AG&quot; (&quot;Me, Inc.&quot;).
*Introduction of Jobcenters, local government facilities for providing public employment services

Hartz III
*Hartz III came into effect on 1 January 2004. This measure was aimed at restructuring and reforming the federal public employment services agency, whose name was changed from the &quot; Bundesanstalt für Arbeit&quot; or &quot;Arbeitsamt&quot; (Federal Labour Institution), to the &quot;Bundesagentur für Arbeit&quot; or &quot;Agentur für Arbeit&quot; (Federal Labour Agency).

==Hartz IV==
The fourth stage of the reform was voted in by the &quot;Bundestag&quot; on 16 December 2003, and by the &quot;Bundesrat&quot; on 9 July 2004, to take effect by 1 January 2005.

This part of the reforms brought together the former unemployment benefits for long-term unemployed (&#x27;Arbeitslosenhilfe&#x27;) and the welfare benefits (&#x27;Sozialhilfe&#x27;), leaving them both at approximately the lower level of the former &quot;Sozialhilfe&quot; (social assistance). The level for a single person was €374 per month (known as the &quot;Regelsatz&quot;). This has risen since, reaching €563 per month in 2024. Added to this is the financial assistance with housing and health care. Couples can receive benefits for each partner plus their children.

Prior to 2005, between 12 and 36 months (depending upon the claimant&#x27;s age and work history) of their full unemployment benefit (60 to 67% of the previous net salary) were followed by the &quot;Arbeitslosenhilfe&quot; (unemployment assistance), amounting to 53 to 57% of the last net salary. Since 2008, eligibility for the full unemployment benefit (renamed &quot;Arbeitslosengeld&quot; in 2005 and commonly referred to as &quot;Arbeitslosengeld I&quot; in everyday German to contrast it with the lower benefits discussed below) has been restricted to 12 months in general, 15 months for those aged 50 or older, 18 months for those 55 or older and 24 months for those 58 or older.

This is now followed by the (usually much lower) &quot;Arbeitslosengeld II&quot; (Hartz IV) benefits if the claimant meets eligibility requirements.

Whether or not a claimant is eligible for &quot;Arbeitslosengeld II&quot; depends on his or her savings, life insurance and the income of spouse or partner. If these assets are below a threshold level, a claimant can get money from the state. The threshold level in July 2008 was €150 for free assets (at least €3,100) and €250 for fixed retirement assets, both calculated per capita and lifetime year. Additionally, every employable individual in a communal household (persons living in and depending on the resources of the claimant), can have one car worth about €7,500 and a self-used house of 130 square meters living space (more if there are other people in the common household).

To receive payments, a claimant must agree to a contract subject to public law. This contract outlines what they are obliged to do to improve their job situation, and when the state is obliged to help. An unemployed person may be required to accept any kind of legal job. This compulsion is restricted by constitutional rights, like freedom of movement, freedom of family, marriage and human dignity. If taking on a specific placement is deemed reasonable by the responsible agency, not applying will result in a reduction or even complete suspension of the appropriate payment.

Within the &quot;Arbeitslosengeld II&quot; schemes, the state covers the health insurance of the unemployed. Until the end of 2010, payments towards the pension scheme of the claimant were also made.

It is possible to earn income from a job and receive &quot;Arbeitslosengeld II&quot; benefits at the same time. Job income is debited from &quot;Arbeitslosengeld II&quot; payments according to a formula that leaves a certain amount of the additional revenue untouched. These revenues are: a certain amount of savings (which increases with age); €100 plus 20 percent of the wage up to €800 plus 10% of the wage up to €1200 (up to €1500 if there are children). Through this mechanism &quot;Arbeitslosengeld II&quot; can be regarded as a sort of minimum wage floor for employees without assets, where the minimum wage is not fully paid by the employer but assured by the state. There are criticisms that this defies competition and leads to a downward spiral in wages and the loss of full-time jobs.
The Hartz IV reform merged the federal level unemployment agency with the local level welfare administration. This facilitated a better, case-oriented approach to helping unemployed people find work and improve their situations. The plan&#x27;s objective is to reduce caseloads from 400 unemployed persons per agent to not more than 75 (aged 25 or less), or not more than 150 persons over the age of 25. For difficult cases, dedicated case managers may be deployed. Legally, however, the agencies remain separate.

The Hartz IV reforms continue to attract criticism in Germany, despite a considerable reduction in short- and long-term unemployment. This reduction has led to some claims of success for the Hartz reforms. Others say the actual unemployment figures are not comparable because many people work part-time or are not included in the statistics for other reasons, such as the number of children that live in Hartz IV households, which has risen to record numbers.

About 7 million people get Hartz IV benefits, of which 2.2 million are unemployed. The budget is estimated to be €20 billion per year.

In April 2018, 55% of the recipients had a migration background. According to the Federal Employment Agency (German: &quot;Bundesagentur für Arbeit&quot;) this was due to the migrants lacking either employable skills or knowledge of the language.

In a November 2019 ruling the Federal Constitutional Court prohibited controversial harsh sanctions against benefit recipients. It outlawed complete payment cuts and decided that 30-percent cuts would only be permissible under specific conditions, as such punishments endangered jobseekers&#x27; minimum standard of living.

== Successor ==
In November 2022, the Bundestag decided to replace Hartz IV with the so-called Bürgergeld on 1 January 2023, which reduces conditionalities and increases the standard unemployment benefit () of ALG II to a monthly 503 euros. It is one of the main projects of the social democrat, green, and liberal coalition under Olaf Scholz.

==Cultural impact==
Although the official term for long-term unemployment benefits is still &quot;Arbeitslosengeld II&quot;, most Germans, even news programmes and politicians in parliament, refer to it as &quot;Hartz IV&quot;. The term was voted German Word of the Year 2004 by the Society for the German Language. Earlier, in 2002, the term &quot;Ich-AG&quot; (another Hartz measure, see above) had been chosen as the German Un-Word of the Year by a jury of linguistic scholars. In 2010, a solitary activist pretending to be a movement, Bewegung Morgenlicht threatened and executed attacks in protest against government policy symbolized by Hartz IV.

Meanwhile, &quot;Hartz IV&quot; has become a synonym for the class of non-working poor and is used as a prefix in multiple contexts (e.g. low-brow daytime television programmes are called &quot;Hartz IV TV&quot; by critics).

==Death==
On the night of 1920 April 1943 at Djebel Garci, Tunisia, the advance of a battalion of the 5th Indian Infantry Brigade was held up by machine-gun and mortar fire. He gave the rallying cry [Jats and Muslims, there must be no withdrawal! We will advance! Advance!] while attacking. Company Havildar-Major Chhelu Ram dashed forward with a Tommy-gun, killed the occupants of a machine-gun post, and then went to the aid of his company commander who had become a casualty. While doing so he was himself wounded, but taking command of the company, he led them in hand-to-hand fighting. He was again wounded, but continued rallying his men until he died.
