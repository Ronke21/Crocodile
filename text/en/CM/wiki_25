<text>C. Mayer is a lunar impact crater that is located at the northern edge of the Mare Frigoris, due north of the prominent crater Aristoteles. Also to the south, but only a third as distant, is the smaller crater Sheepshanks. Due east of C. Mayer is the flooded crater Kane.

C. Mayer is a relatively young formation, with a sharp-edged and well-defined outer rim. The rim is not quite circular, and appears somewhat polygonal-shaped with outward bulges along the edge, most notably to the west. The inner walls have a system and the interior is somewhat rough and irregular. The central peak lies just to the north of the midpoint, and extends in a northerly direction.

The lava-flooded formation C. Mayer D is attached to the southeastern rim of the crater, and a gap in the southeastern rim joins it to the Mare Frigoris. Thus the lunar mare extends up to the outer of C. Mayer.

== Satellite craters ==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to C. Mayer (See the C Mayer D crater that is very similar in shape to the map of Brazil). » [(:pt:C. Mayer D (Cratera) )]

<text>Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi (, 11 April 1938 – 21 April 2015) was a popular Egyptian poet, and later a children&#x27;s books writer. He was one of a generation of poets who favored to write their work in the Egyptian dialect (in Abnudi&#x27;s case, Upper Egyptian dialect) rather than Standard Arabic, the formal language of the state. This literary stance was associated with a militant political engagement: Abnudi and other Egyptian writers of this school sought to make their literary production part of the process of political development and movement towards popular democracy in Egypt.

== Life ==
He was born in the village Abnud in Upper Egypt. He wrote his first poetry when he was a high school student. In 1958, he traveled to Cairo. First of his works were published in the weekly magazine . In 1961, he moved to Cairo where he worked as a songwriter.
He married the former President of the Egyptian Television Network and television presenter and interviewer Nehal Kamal, and they had two children: Aya and Nour.

== Works ==
Many of his works have been set to music by composers including Ezz Eddin Hosni and performed by popular singers such as Abd El Halim, Nagat el Saghera, Shadia, Sabah, Majida El Roumi, Mohamed Mounir and others.

*&quot;El-Mot ala el-Asfalt&quot; () – named in the top 100 African books of the 20th century at the 2001 Zimbabwe International Book Fair.
*&quot;Jawabat Haraji il-Gutt&quot; (; 2001) – written in the form of an epistolary novel the work comprises letters exchanged between the cat Haraji, a worker on the Aswan Dam and his wife at home.
*&quot;El Siral Hilaliyah&quot; (; 1980s) -it is the great Arabic Saidi Epic Poem Recollected in 5 Volumes and edited by him from different poets of Upper Egypt and for this work He was claimed as (Homer of Arabs) by some of his biographers, this work is not all of his Collection but a sum of it because his Manuscripts of Epic are about 15 Volumes every one has 700 pages(as the largest Arabic Poetic Work) and war transisted to the Sīra museum of his house by government.

== Most famous poetry ==
*The allowed and prohibited
*Death on the asphalt
*Charged with forest cat
*Earth and the children
*The silence of the bell

<doc id="1200093" wikidata="Q331728" url="?curid=1200093" title="Larry the Cable Guy">
<text>Daniel Lawrence Whitney (born February 17, 1963), known professionally as Larry the Cable Guy, is an American stand-up comedian, actor, and former radio personality. He was one of the members of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, a comedy troupe which included Bill Engvall, Ron White, and Jeff Foxworthy (with whom he has starred on &quot;Blue Collar TV&quot;).
Whitney has released seven comedy albums, two of which have been certified platinum by the RIAA for shipments of 1,000,000 copies and one of which has been certified gold for shipments of 500,000 copies. He has starred in three Blue Collar Comedy Tour related films, alongside &quot;Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector&quot;, &quot;Delta Farce&quot; and &quot;Witless Protection&quot;, and provides the voice of Mater in Disney/Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Cars&quot; franchise. Whitney&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;Git-R-Done!&quot; is also the title of his book.

==Early life==
Dan Whitney was born in Nebraska to Tom and Shirley Whitney, and grew up on an 80-acre farm outside Pawnee City, Nebraska. His father was a Christian minister. When he was 16, his family moved to West Palm Beach, Florida. Whitney attended high school at The King&#x27;s Academy in West Palm Beach, Florida, in the late 1970s through 1980 where his father was the elementary school principal. He graduated from Berean Christian School in West Palm Beach in 1982 where he played football. He went to college at Baptist University of America in Georgia, and the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. He majored in drama and speech. He credits his roommates from Texas and Georgia for inspiring his Southern accent impression. He dropped out after his junior year after trying his hand at comedy.

==Career==
===Radio career===
Whitney started his career in radio in the early 1990s when he made regular radio appearances on the nationally syndicated program, &quot;The Ron and Ron Show&quot;, as well as other radio shows such as &quot;The Bob &amp; Tom Show&quot;, &quot;Wakin&#x27; Up with the Wolf&quot; on WPDH, &quot;The Chris Baker Show&quot; on KDGE and KEZO&#x27;s &quot;The Todd and Tyler Radio Empire&quot; in Omaha, Nebraska, as well as the &quot;Kirk, Mark, and Lopez&quot; morning show on WIYY in Baltimore, Maryland. He was also a frequent guest on &quot;The Johnny Dare Morning Show&quot; on 98.9/KQRC, Kansas City, Missouri.

He also appeared on WJRR in Orlando, Florida. He was brought to New England on &quot;Greg and the Morning Buzz&quot; on WHEB 100.3 and WGIR-FM 101.1 in Portsmouth and Manchester, New Hampshire, respectively, doing two commentaries a week.

===Stand-up career===

Initially performing stand-up under his real name with limited success, he became famous after developing the Cable Guy character, a personality that he now maintains throughout his stage act. The Cable Guy character has a stereotypical redneck appearance and a thick Southern accent, recounts stories about his &quot;family&quot;, and uses, among other common expressions, his own catchphrase &quot;Git-R-Done!&quot;

He says in interviews and in his autobiographical book &quot;GIT-R-DONE&quot; that he deliberately &quot;turns on&quot; the accent both on and off stage, because he may forget it if he kept his normal accent intact. He uses catchphrase humor, including &quot;Lord, I apologize for that, there, and be with the starvin&#x27; Pygmies in New Guinea. Amen,&quot; after telling jokes of questionable taste; and, &quot;I don&#x27;t care who ya are, that&#x27;s funny right there,&quot; after jokes that evoke raucous laughter.

His first two comedy albums, &quot;Lord, I Apologize&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Right to Bare Arms&quot; (2005), have both been certified gold by the RIAA. A third album, &quot;Morning Constitutions&quot;, and its accompanying TV special were released in 2007.

===Other work===
Whitney was roasted in a Comedy Central special on March 15, 2009.

On February 8, 2011, the premiere of his newest travelogue series, &quot;Only in America with Larry the Cable Guy&quot;, was broadcast on the History Channel. A total of 4.1 million viewers, 1.7 million adults 25–54, tuned in, nearly doubling the total for the &quot;Top Shot&quot; season 2 opener. During season two in the episode &quot;Larry Goes To Washington&quot;, Whitney was the first on-air talent from a non-news crew allowed in the War Room, also known as the Command Center, as he explained during the program. The series finale aired August 28, 2013.

In June 2012, Disneyland&#x27;s California Adventure theme park&#x27;s &quot;Cars Land&quot; features a ride called &quot;Mater&#x27;s Junkyard Jamboree&quot; that features Whitney&#x27;s voice as his character Mater from the Disney/Pixar &quot;Cars&quot; films.

Bektrom Foods of North Dakota developed a line of Larry the Cable Guy food products, such as boxed hamburger dinners, with some of the proceeds from its sales benefiting the &quot;Git-R-Done Foundation&quot;.

Whitney competed in season six of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as the wild card contestant &quot;Baby&quot; which was the show&#x27;s first human character.

==Personal life==
Whitney and his wife Cara married in 2005. They have a son, Wyatt, and a daughter, Reagan. The Whitney family resides in Lincoln, Nebraska, on a 180-acre (73 ha) farm. The couple started the Git-R-Done Foundation in 2009 to provide assistance to those that have experienced hardships beyond their control. Whitney is a Christian who re-committed to his faith in 2014.

Whitney&#x27;s hometown of Pawnee City, Nebraska, has a street named after him. Whitney also donated money to buy new theatrical equipment for the local high school.

Whitney is an avid Nebraska Cornhuskers football fan. His signature camouflage hat has the University of Nebraska–Lincoln nickname &quot;HUSKERS&quot; emblazoned on it, as seen in the 2007 film &quot;Delta Farce&quot;. He is also frequently seen with a gold Nebraska &quot;N&quot; on a chain around his neck. On October 1, 2016, in his luxury suite at Memorial Stadium during the Nebraska vs. Illinois football game, Whitney was challenged to an arm wrestling match by an Army veteran and Nebraska Army National Guard member, John O&#x27;Connell, who lost the match in less than one minute with his arm (humerus) broken by Whitney.

Whitney is also an avid REO Speedwagon fan. In 2013, he appeared with the group, including a benefit concert in Bloomington, Illinois, for tornado disaster relief.

In September 2010, Whitney donated $5 million to the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, Florida. The gift was for further development of the International Hip Dysplasia Institute at the Orlando hospital. After Dr. Chad Price at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children helped cure their son, Wyatt, of his dysplasia when he was an infant, Whitney and his wife, Cara, made private donations to the hospital and Whitney raised money through appearances on &quot;Family Feud&quot; and &quot;Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?&quot;.

The hospital opened a new wing called the Wyatt Whitney Wing in May 2012.

Whitney is also the proud owner of a George Strait neon sign that he bought backstage at Billy Bob&#x27;s Texas in Fort Worth, Texas.

Whitney endorsed Donald Trump for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

==Radio shows==
Whitney currently works as a radio personality for Sirius XM&#x27;s Jeff &amp; Larry&#x27;s Comedy Roundup channel.

<text>The moa-nalo are a group of extinct aberrant, goose-like ducks that lived on the larger Hawaiian Islands, except Hawaii itself, in the Pacific. They were the major herbivores on most of these islands until they became extinct after human settlement.

==Description==
The moa-nalo (the name literally means &quot;lost fowl&quot;; the plural and the singular are the same) were long unknown to science, having been wiped out before the arrival of James Cook (1778). In the early 1980s, their subfossil remains were discovered in sand dunes on the islands of Molokai and Kauai. Subsequently, bones were found on Maui, Oahu, and Lānai, in lava tubes, lake beds, and sinkholes. They represent four species in three genera so far:

* &quot;Chelychelynechen quassus&quot; (turtle-jawed moa-nalo) from Kauai
* &quot;Ptaiochen pau&quot; (small-billed moa-nalo) from Maui
* &quot;Thambetochen xanion&quot; (O&#x27;ahu moa-nalo) from Oahu
* &quot;Thambetochen chauliodous&quot; (Maui Nui large-billed moa-nalo) from Maui, Lānai and Molokai (Maui Nui)

&quot;Chelychelynechen&quot;, meaning turtle-jawed goose, had a large, heavy bill like that of a tortoise, while the other two genera, &quot;Thambetochen&quot; and &quot;Ptaiochen&quot;, all had serrations in their bills known as pseudoteeth, similar to those of mergansers. All species were flightless and large, with an average mass of .

==Evolution==
Some moa-nalo fossils have been found to contain traces of mitochondrial DNA which were compared to living duck species in order to establish their place in the duck family, Anatidae. Contrary to the expectations of some scientists, the moa-nalo were not related to the large geese (Anserinae), such as the surviving nēnē, but instead to the dabbling ducks of the genus &quot;Anas&quot;, which includes the mallard. The present DNA analysis&#x27; resolution is not high enough to determine their relationships to different species of &quot;Anas&quot;, but biogeography strongly suggests that their closest living relative is the widespread Pacific black duck.
==Ecology==
The unusual bill shape and size of the moa-nalo can be attributed to their role in the ecology of prehistoric Hawaii. A study of coprolites (fossil dung) of &quot;Thambetochen chauliodous&quot; found in Puu Naio Cave on lowland Maui has shown they were folivorous, at least in dry shrub or mesic forest habitats eating particularly fronds from ferns (possibly &quot;Asplenium nidus&quot; or &quot;Dryopteris wallichiana&quot;). This conclusion is backed up by the shapes of their beaks (James &amp; Burney 1997). This indicates they were the principal browsers on the island.
The presence of prominent spines on the leaves and soft young stems of several Hawaiian lobelioids in the genus &quot;Cyanea&quot;—unusual in an island flora where such defenses are frequently lost, as in the &quot;ākala&quot; (Hawaiian raspberry)—suggests that the &quot;Cyanea&quot; evolved these thornlike prickles on new growth because they protect against browsing by the moa-nalo. The moa-nalo themselves filled the niche of herbivore usually filled by mammals such as goats and deer, or the giant tortoises of Galápagos and other archipelagoes. This has implications for the ecology of Hawaiian Islands today, as a major group of species have been lost.

Like island taxa from Mauritius, New Zealand and Polynesia, the moa-nalo were unused to mammals and were easily predated on by hunters or the animals that were introduced and became feral, such as domestic pigs.

<text>In geometry, the augmented truncated tetrahedron is a polyhedron constructed by attaching a triangular cupola onto an truncated tetrahedron. It is an example of a Johnson solid.

== Construction ==
The augmented truncated tetrahedron is constructed from a truncated tetrahedron by attaching a triangular cupola. This cupola covers one of the truncated tetrahedron&#x27;s four hexagonal faces, so that the resulting polyhedron&#x27;s faces are eight equilateral triangles, three squares, and three regular hexagons. Since it has the property of convexity and has regular polygonal faces, the augmented truncated tetrahedron is a Johnson solid, denoted as the sixty-fifth Johnson solid formula_1.

== Properties ==
The surface area of an augmented truncated tetrahedron is:
formula_2
the sum of the areas of its faces. Its volume can be calculated by slicing it off into both truncated tetrahedron and triangular cupola, and adding their volume:
formula_3

It has the same three-dimensional symmetry group as the triangular cupola, the pyramidal symmetry formula_4. Its dihedral angles can be obtained by adding the angle of a triangular cupola and an augmented truncated tetrahedron in the following:
* its dihedral angle between triangle and hexagon is as in the truncated tetrahedron: 109.47°;
* its dihedral angle between adjacent hexagons is as in the truncated tetrahedron: 70.53°;
* its dihedral angle between triangle and square is as in the triangular cupola&#x27;s angle: 125.3°
* its dihedral angle between triangle and square, on the edge where the triangular cupola and truncated tetrahedron are attached, is the sum of both triangular cupola&#x27;s square-hexagon angle and the truncated tetrahedron&#x27;s triangle-hexagon angle: approximately 164.17°; and
* its dihedral angle between triangle and hexagon, on the edge where triangular cupola and truncated tetrahedron are attached, is the sum of the dihedral angle of a triangular cupola and truncated tetrahedron between that: approximately 141.3°;

<doc id="1200132" wikidata="Q3142391" url="?curid=1200132" title="Prometheus (DC Comics)">
<text>Prometheus is a name used by multiple supervillains appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writer Grant Morrison and penciller Arnie Jorgensen, the most recognized version first appeared in &quot;New Year&#x27;s Evil: Prometheus&quot; (February 1998). Commonly an adversary of the Justice League and a villainous foil personality to Batman (similar to villains Killer Moth, Wrath, and Hush), Prometheus would serve as an enemy to superheroes including Batman, Green Arrow and Midnighter.

In 2009, Prometheus was ranked as IGN&#x27;s 80th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time. On The CW&#x27;s live-action Arrowverse TV series &quot;Arrow&quot;, the character was portrayed by Josh Segarra and voiced by Michael Dorn.

== Publication history ==
Curt Calhoun debuted in &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; (vol. 6) #3 (August 1986). A new version of Prometheus debuted in &quot;New Year&#x27;s Evil: Prometheus&quot; (February 1998) and returned in &quot;JLA&quot; #16–17 (March–April 1998) and #36–41 (December 1999–May 2000). The character was then impersonated for a time by Chad Graham, but returned in &quot;Faces of Evil: Prometheus&quot; #1 (March 2009). Prometheus starred as the villain in the limited series &quot;Justice League: Cry for Justice&quot; #1–7 (September 2009–April 2010), and was killed at the conclusion of the story.

Writer Mike Conroy noted &quot;...with his technologically advanced armor and weapons arsenal, which can download the fighting techniques of the world&#x27;s top martial artists...he (Prometheus) turned out to be a formidable foe, as the JLA found out&quot;.

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Curt Calhoun ===
The original version, Curt Calhoun, debuted in &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; (vol. 6) #3 (August 1986), followed by appearances in issues #4 (September 1986); #6 (November 1986); #8–9 (January–February 1987) and #11–13 (April–June 1987). Calhoun is a small-time criminal working for supervillain Doctor Alchemy and is hired to steal a quantity of the metal promethium from KORD Inc., an organization owned by Ted Kord. Although successful, both Calhoun and Dr. Alchemy are captured by the Blue Beetle. On release from prison, Calhoun aids the Blue Beetle against the Calculator and is offered a position as a foreman at KORD Inc. by Kord. While saving Kord from an industrial accident, Calhoun is covered with metals laced with promethium. En route to the hospital, Calhoun&#x27;s ambulance is attacked by members of the supervillain team known as Hybrid. The leader, Mento, transforms the metal covering Calhoun into a permanent metallic shell. Assuming the &quot;Prometheus&quot; alias, the reluctant Calhoun fights alongside Hybrid in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat the New Teen Titans. Although Mento eventually directs Hybrid against the Titans once again, they rebel and Mento is apparently cured of his insanity by Titan member Raven. Calhoun is never seen again, until the superhero JSA team learns that Hybrid died in the gladiatorial games staged by villainess Roulette. The original version possesses a metal epidermis, which confers superior strength and durability. Calhoun is also capable of raising the temperature of his armored form to several hundred degrees Celsius.

=== Unnamed version ===
The most well-known version is the unnamed son of two hippie spree killers, who traveled across the United States with them until they were gunned down by police in a shootout. This traumatic experience causes their son&#x27;s hair to turn white, and he vows to &quot;annihilate the forces of justice&quot; to get revenge for his slain parents.

Using his parents&#x27; hidden caches of money, the son travels the world and develops his skills, becoming an underground pit-fighter in Brazil and a mercenary in Africa, and joining terrorist groups in the Middle East. After avenging his parents&#x27; deaths by murdering the police officer who shot them, he locates the Himalayan city of Shambhala, inhabited by a sect of monks that worshiped the concept of evil. Prometheus discovers the monastery has been built on an alien spaceship, and the leader of the sect is one of the creatures from the vessel. He kills the alien and obtains the &quot;Ghost Key&quot;, which opens a portal to the &quot;Ghost Zone&quot;.

Prometheus builds a house in the void as his headquarters, which is warped by the dimensional effects to become &quot;crooked&quot;. He relates his origin to a young man, with the alias &quot;Retro&quot;, who has won a competition to be part of the JLA for a day. Prometheus kills Retro, copies the young man&#x27;s mannerisms (courtesy of his advanced helmet), and joins the tour group at the JLA transporters, intending to masquerade as Retro to gain access to the JLA Watchtower.

Initially, the plan appears to be successful, with Prometheus infecting Steel&#x27;s armor with a virus, hitting the Martian Manhunter with a dart containing a toxin that destabilizes his ability to control his shape, knocking out Huntress, trapping Zauriel in the Ghost Zone, beating Batman senseless using downloaded skills, using neural chaff to disrupt Green Lantern&#x27;s will, and manipulating the Flash into believing that the tower is rigged with bombs that will detonate if he moves too fast. He then tries to force Superman to kill himself after admitting that the hero is too powerful for him to kill, stating that he will murder the rest of the tour group otherwise. Prometheus is then caught off guard by the anti-hero Catwoman (who is disguised as journalist Cat Grant), allowing the heroes time to recover. Steel is able to restore his suit and transfer the virus to Prometheus&#x27; suit. Admitting he lied about the bombs, Prometheus switches places with Zauriel in the Ghost Zone and escapes capture.

Prometheus appears briefly during an encounter between the JLA and the Avengers and skirmishes with Captain America while using Batman&#x27;s skills, but Captain America easily defeats him by exploiting the villain&#x27;s overconfidence and his own enhanced physique.

Prometheus returns as a member of Lex Luthor&#x27;s second Injustice Gang. During the confusion caused by the arrival of the weapon Mageddon, Prometheus is able to use a White Martian space vessel abandoned in the Ghost Zone to infiltrate the Watchtower and attack Oracle. Oracle escapes, with Prometheus&#x27;s helmet being damaged in the process. The villain retrieves his original helmet (lost during the first battle with the JLA) and battles Batman once again. Prometheus is neutralized when Batman sabotages his helmet, overriding the information on the disc Prometheus uses to upload his combat skills and replacing the data with the physical skills and coordination of Professor Stephen Hawking. Batman prevents fellow member Huntress from killing the now-helpless Prometheus. Batman and Martian Manhunter take Prometheus into custody and use the latter&#x27;s telepathy to reduce Prometheus to a mentally disabled adult, reasoning that his skills and training mean that no jail could hold him under conventional circumstances. Upon Martian Manhunter&#x27;s death at Libra&#x27;s hands, Prometheus&#x27;s mind was restored and he tracked down Chad Graham, killing his would-be protégé and maiming/murdering members of the Blood Pack super-hero team.

==== Cry for Justice ====
A spate of superhero deaths (Freedom Beast and Gloss) and attacks on others (Barry Allen, Batwoman, and Crimson Avenger) is revealed to be the work of the true Prometheus. The villain impersonates Freddy Freeman and gains access to the JLA satellite, which in turn allows Prometheus to place teleportation devices in the home cities of various heroes which will &quot;strand&quot; them in various places in the past and future, as revenge for the years that he spent with his mind damaged. Prometheus also maims Roy Harper after Harper realizes his foe is not Freddy Freeman. After defeating the JLA and the Teen Titans by reading files on them, Prometheus is captured by Donna Troy and beaten brutally, until being stopped by the Shade. Prometheus offers to reveal the location of the devices in exchange for his release, after they malfunction and begin destroying the cities. With Star City suffering massive casualties (including Roy&#x27;s daughter), Prometheus&#x27;s ultimatum is met and he returns to his lair, but is murdered by Green Arrow by shooting an arrow through his head.

==== &quot;The New 52&quot; ====
In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the DC universe. Prometheus shows up to torment Midnighter using stolen technology from the God Garden that he sells to various individuals around the world. In addition, he acquires the Gardener&#x27;s secret files on Midnighter&#x27;s true identity and origin. When confronted by Midnighter, Prometheus uses God Garden technology to block Midnighter&#x27;s tactical computer, eliminating the edge Midnighter has in analyzing an opponent&#x27;s fighting techniques. Prometheus also reveals that he has downloaded all of Midnighter&#x27;s own skills into his brain to use against his enemy. Pretending to be an ordinary man, he uses the alias Matt Dell to seduce and have a romantic relationship with Midnighter to achieve his goals.

=== Chad Graham ===
The third version, Chad Graham, debuted in &quot;&quot; #52 (June 2004), as part of the &quot;Pushback&quot; storyline from issues #50–55 (April–September 2004). The villain reappeared in &quot;Batman: Gotham Knights&quot; #66 (August 2005); &quot;Villains United&quot; #1–6 (July–September 2005); &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; #1–7 (December 2005–June 2006); &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; #94 (June–August 2006); &quot;Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 3) #51–54 (November 2007–February 2008) and &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #1–7 (July 2008–March 2009). He was not initially established as a different version from the second version until the &quot;Faces of Evil&quot; issue that featured the second version&#x27;s return. It was later revealed that his former apprentice assumed the Prometheus identity after the well-known version went into a mentally disabled state; Graham had been taken in by Prometheus to serve as an evil sidekick years earlier, but proved too impulsive and ended up leaving Prometheus (under unknown circumstances). Graham appears in Star City, battling Green Arrow and local law enforcement. Almost killed by Green Arrow, Graham is saved by Hush. Hush forms an alliance with the impostor but abandons him due to his incompetence. Talia al Ghul leads Kobra in search of Prometheus in a bid to secure his Ghost Key. Graham, poisoned by Poison Ivy, is saved once again by Hush. Graham is then recruited to join another version of the Secret Society of Super Villains and participates in a massive attack by the Society on Metropolis. During the battle, Graham kills Peacemaker. Graham also has an encounter with the Birds of Prey and defeats Lady Shiva in seconds. He eventually falls under the alien Starro&#x27;s control but is freed once Starro is defeated. Graham is later murdered when the true Prometheus regains himself; he expresses contempt for Graham&#x27;s impersonation but is satisfied that the damage Graham has done to Prometheus&#x27;s reputation would lead to the heroes underestimating him in the future. The third version relies on the use of two pistols, although he also possesses his mentor&#x27;s helmet and artificial skills, giving him the training to defeat even Lady Shiva in a matter of seconds.

== Powers and abilities ==
Prometheus possesses no superhuman abilities, but has undergone intense physical and mental training and utilizes an extensive range of equipment and technology like the hero Batman. Common tools include body armor, gauntlets that fire various projectiles, a side-handle baton with several technological features, and a helmet that in addition to emitting strobe lighting capable of disorientation and hypnotism, can download the knowledge and physical skills of others directly into his brain via a compact disc, his default disc including the skills of thirty of the world&#x27;s greatest martial artists. Where Prometheus obtains this information is not known, but his combat skills include the duplicated abilities of Batman and Lady Shiva, although it is unclear how much combat training he would possess if he had to fight without the helmet. The &#x27;battlesuit&#x27;/helmet combination is also equipped with an artificial Intelligence that can rapidly calculate and deploy a variety of strategies and countermeasures that have allowed Prometheus at various times to incapacitate entire groups of the Justice League singlehandedly and simultaneously.

Finally, the unnamed version possesses the &quot;Ghost Key&quot; which allows the villain to teleport himself and other objects and persons to and from a dimension called the &quot;Ghost Zone&quot;. It can also be used to inflict total molecular disintegration on a target, but Prometheus only employed this function once, when he eliminated the unsuspecting Retro. The helmet can be hacked by external sources, but Batman had to study the helmet for a month to learn how to hack it in that manner, and it is unclear if this would allow him to hack other versions of the helmet.

== Other versions ==
=== JLA/Avengers ===
Prometheus appears in &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot; #4 as a brainwashed minion of Krona.

=== Power Rangers/Justice League ===
In &quot;Justice League/Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, Billy Cranston temporarily wields Prometheus&#x27; armor after Lord Zedd and Brainiac steal his powers.

== In other media ==
=== Television ===

* Two original incarnations of Prometheus appear in media set in the Arrowverse, with Michael Dorn providing his disguised voice: 
** The Earth-1 incarnation, Simon Morrison, appears in &quot;Arrow&quot;, portrayed by Josh Segarra. He is a polymath, having become an expert in law, engineering, and various forms of armed and unarmed combat. Primarily appearing in the fifth season and following his father Justin Claybourne&#x27;s death, he vowed revenge on and conducted research into Oliver Queen. After seeking out Talia al Ghul to train him in the League of Assassins&#x27; ways, Morrison assumes the alias of Starling City&#x27;s District Attorney &quot;Adrian Chase&quot; before targeting Queen and the latter&#x27;s allies, manipulating Artemis, and recruiting Black Siren to his cause. While Team Arrow eventually deduce his identity, Morrison kidnaps William Clayton and captures Queen&#x27;s teammates to lure him to the island Lian Yu, where he has rigged explosives connected to a neural interface that will detonate them should he die. In the ensuing fight with Queen, Morrison kills himself, though Queen and most of the captives survive. Additionally, a hallucination of Morrison makes a minor appearance in the sixth season.
** The Earth-X incarnation, Tommy Merlyn, appears in the crossover &quot;Crisis on Earth-X&quot;, portrayed by Colin Donnell.

<text>Biratnagar () is a metropolitan city in Nepal, which serves as the capital of Koshi Province. With a Metropolitan Urban Agglomeration population of 244,750 as per the 2021 census, it is the largest city and fastest growing city in the province and also the headquarters of Morang district. As per the preliminary report of 2022 Nepal census, Biratnagar Metropolitan has an estimated city population of 243,927 excluding the suburban areas which are now very well connected to the old town. It is the administrative center of the &quot;Greater Birat Development Area&quot; which incorporates the cities of Biratnagar and its suburbs and towns of-Itahari-Gothgau-Biratchowk-Dharan primarily located on the Koshi Highway in Eastern Nepal, with an estimated total urban agglomerated population of 804,300 people in 159,332 households including the town of Ithari. Biratnagar is located east of the capital, Kathmandu, and north of the bordering town of Jogbani in the Indian state of Bihar which is very well connected through Rani Path (Old Highway) and Koshi Path (New Highway). It is one of the major entry point in Nepal for Businessmen as well as Tourists who come to visit Nepal for various purposes. A customs duty is required to be paid for Indian vehicles in Nepal and vice versa.

Biratnagar was declared a metropolitan city on 22 May 2017, a merger with additional wards pushing the total population to over 240,000. It is the sixth largest city of Nepal, with 244,750 inhabitants as per 2021 Nepal census. 

The city is home to various large and medium scale industries including the Biratnagar Jute Mills, the first large-scale industry of Nepal. Besides being considered as the industrial capital of Nepal, the city has contributed actively to the Nepalese democracy movement by being the birthplace of five prime ministers of democratic Nepal. The latter claim is also evident from the fact that the first labor strike leading to the anti-Rana movement started from Biratnagar.

Modern-day Biratnagar serves as an entry point to eastern Nepal as well as north-eastern India. It is the second Nepalese city, after Janakpur, to have a connection with the Indian Railways and the only city other than Birgunj to operate an integrated check post (ICP) on the Indian border.

==History==
In 1914, Colonel Jit Bahadur Khatri, the then district governor, laid the foundations of modern Biratnagar by moving the hospital, post office, prison and the customs, land registry, forestry and auditor offices to Gograha Bazaar from Rangeli, the then district capital of Morang.

The recorded history of Biratnagar dates back to the beginning of the 7th century, when King Mung Mawrong Hang came to prominence in the terai lands of Limbuwan (present-day Sunsari, Morang, and Jhapa areas). He cleared much of the forest area in present-day Rangeli, east of Biratnagar, and built a town there. He named his Kingdom Morang after his name and rose to power.

The old name of Biratnagar was &quot;Gograha Bazaar&quot;. The ruins of temples, palaces, and ponds are scattered in a vast area to the south of the current city, in Vedhyari, Buddhanagar. The preservation of this heritage has been a major problem citing the encroachment of newcomers into the city.

The town was named Biratnagar in 1919 (1976 BS) by Keshar Shamsher Rana after the ruins of a palace, thought to be of King Virat (not proved), and other objects of historical importance were found. Kingdom of Virata mentioned in Mahabharata is however believed to be Viratnagar, located in present-day Rajasthan. King Virata was the king of the Matsya Kingdom, in whose court the Pandavas spent a year in concealment during their &quot;Agyaata Vaasa&quot; in the exile. According to the Markandeya Purana, the famous seven Kirata kingdoms during the Mahabharat time were Aswakut or Kabul, Kulya or Kulu Valley, Matsya or North Bihar Paundra or Bengal, Sumer or Assam, Malak or Mlek or Lohit, Kinner Kirat or Garhwal and Nepal. In those days, the Kirat people were ruling all the lands from Himalayan Mountains to the sea shores of the Bay of Bengal.

In Nepali, &quot;Birat&quot; () refers to King &quot;Virata&quot; of the Matsya Kingdom and &quot;Nagar&quot; () means &quot;City&quot;; Literally &quot;King Virata&#x27;s City&quot;. still the raja birat durbar in Biratnagar 18 near the icp gate , tole name is vedyari .

On 4 March 1947, the first anti-Rana movement in Nepal started in Biratnagar at the Biratnagar jute mills under the leadership of Girija Prasad Koirala and B. P. Koirala. This sparked a countrywide anti-Rana demonstration that eventually led to the abolishment of Rana rule in Nepal.

<doc id="1200145" wikidata="Q5122791" url="?curid=1200145" title="Citizenship in a Republic">
<text>Citizenship in a Republic is the title of a speech given by Theodore Roosevelt, former President of the United States, at the Sorbonne in Paris, France, on April 23, 1910.

One notable passage from the speech is referred to as &quot;The Man in the Arena&quot;:

It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

Someone who is heavily involved in a situation that requires courage, skill, or tenacity, as opposed to someone sitting on the sidelines and watching, is often referred to as &quot;the man in the arena&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The &quot;Man in the Arena&quot; passage was quoted by another U.S. president, Richard Nixon, both in his victory speech on November 6, 1968, and in his resignation address to the nation on August 8, 1974:

Sometimes I have succeeded and sometimes I have failed, but always I have taken heart from what Theodore Roosevelt once said about the man in the arena, &quot;whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood [...]&quot;

Nelson Mandela gave a copy of this speech to François Pienaar, captain of the South African rugby team, before the start of the 1995 Rugby World Cup, in which the South African side eventually defeated the heavily favoured All Blacks of New Zealand. In the film based on those events, the poem &quot;Invictus&quot; is used instead.

Mark DeRosa, an American professional baseball utility player then with the Washington Nationals, read the passage to teammates prior to the Nationals&#x27; pivotal Game Four versus the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2012 National League Division Series which was won on a walk-off home run by the Nationals&#x27; Jayson Werth. Since his days at the University of Pennsylvania, DeRosa would turn to those words before important games.

American scholar Brené Brown quotes the excerpt in the Netflix special &quot;The Call to Courage&quot;; she also used a somewhat abbreviated version of the quote in her March 2012 TED talk &quot;Listening to Shame,&quot; and subsequently as the inspiration for the title of her book, &quot;Daring Greatly&quot; (2012).

When then Ferrari Formula One driver Jean Alesi was about to start the last lap of the 1995 Canadian Grand Prix (which would become his only Grand Prix win), then ESPN commentator Bob Varsha used parts of Roosevelt´s speech, saying that Alesi looked a while like being the man Roosevelt had talked about.

The &quot;Man in the Arena&quot; passage was used in a 2015 ad for Cadillac, ending with &quot;dare greatly&quot;.

At the 2016 Democratic National Convention President Barack Obama cited the speech in his endorsement speech of Hillary Clinton.

Lindsey Stirling&#x27;s 2016 album release &quot;Brave Enough&quot; features a song titled &quot;The Arena&quot;. The inspiration for this song comes from this speech. The music video for the track also starts out with a quotation from this speech.

LeBron James has #ManInTheArena written on his shoes.

During the United States Naval Academy&#x27;s Plebe Summer, incoming freshmen are encouraged to memorize &quot;The Man in the Arena&quot;.

At the annual CaseIT MIS Case Competitions, Dr. Peter Tingling, Associate Dean at Simon Fraser University&#x27;s Beedie School of Business, retold the story of the &quot;Man in the Arena&quot; in the opening ceremony to inspire competitors.

Tom Brady named his ESPN+ docuseries “Man in the Arena,” drawing directly from the famous passage in Theodore Roosevelt’s “Citizenship in a Republic”. The series has 10 episodes with each focused on one of Tom Brady’s 10 Super Bowl game appearances.

<text>The Columbus Day storm of 1962 (also known as the big blow of 1962, and originally in Canada as Typhoon Freda) was a Pacific Northwest windstorm that struck the West Coast of Canada and the Pacific Northwest coast of the United States on October 12, 1962. Typhoon Freda was the twenty-eighth tropical depression, the twenty-third tropical storm, and the eighteenth typhoon of the 1962 Pacific typhoon season. Freda originated from a tropical disturbance over the Northwest Pacific on September 28. On October 3, the system strengthened into a tropical storm and was given the name &quot;Freda&quot;, before becoming a typhoon later that day, while moving northeastward. The storm quickly intensified, reaching its peak as a Category 3-equivalent typhoon on October 5, with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of and a minimum central pressure of . Freda maintained its intensity for another day, before beginning to gradually weaken, later on October 6. On October 9, Freda weakened into a tropical storm, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on the next day. On October 11, Freda turned eastward and accelerated across the North Pacific, before striking the Pacific Northwest on the next day. On October 13, the cyclone made landfall on Washington and Vancouver Island, and then curved northwestward. Afterward, the system moved into Canada and weakened, before being absorbed by another developing storm to the south on October 17. 

The Columbus Day storm of 1962 is considered to be the benchmark of extratropical wind storms. The storm ranks among the most intense to strike the region since at least 1948, likely since the January 9, 1880 &quot;Great Gale&quot; and snowstorm. The storm is a contender for the title of the most powerful extratropical cyclone recorded in the U.S. in the 20th century; with respect to wind velocity, it is unmatched by the March 1993 &quot;storm of the century&quot; and the &quot;1991 Halloween Nor&#x27;easter&quot; (&quot;the perfect storm&quot;). The system brought strong winds to the Pacific Northwest and southwest Canada, and was linked to 46 fatalities in the northwest and Northern California resulting from heavy rains and mudslides.

==Meteorological history==

On the morning of September 28, a tropical disturbance formed south of Eniwetok Atoll. After moving westward and making a large bend around the island, the new system slowly gained strength, and on the morning of October 3, the system became a tropical storm about from Wake Island, over the central Pacific Ocean. Now named &quot;Freda&quot;, the system rapidly intensified as it proceeded northeastward over the open Pacific waters. On that afternoon, Freda intensified into a typhoon, with 1-minute sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). On October 4, the typhoon quickly intensified, reaching its peak of 115 mph (185 km/h) on the next day, with a minimum central pressure of , making the storm the equivalent of a Category 3 typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson scale. After stabilizing to the north, Freda maintained its strength through the Pacific, before beginning to weaken slowly on October 6. Making a turn to the northeast, Freda maintained typhoon-status winds for several more days, before weakening into a tropical storm on October 9, as it started experiencing the effects of cold air.

Moving northeastward at a steady rate of , the storm slowly underwent an extratropical transition, becoming extratropical operationally on the morning of October 10, still with winds of 45 mph (65 km/h). The system became an extratropical cyclone as it moved into colder waters and interacted with the jet stream. However, post-season analysis concluded that the system continued weakening as it continued northeastward, crossing the 180th meridian later that afternoon, before completing the transition that evening.

The extratropical low redeveloped intensely off the coast of Northern California, due to favorable upper-level conditions, producing record rainfall across the San Francisco Bay Area that delayed some games in the 1962 World Series between the San Francisco Giants and the New York Yankees. The low moved northeastward, and then hooked straight north, as it neared southwest Oregon. The storm then raced nearly northward at an average speed of , with the center situated just off the Pacific Coast. There was little central pressure change until the cyclone passed the latitude of Astoria, Oregon, at which time the low began to degrade. On October 13, the center passed over Tatoosh Island, Washington, before making landfall on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, where it weakened rapidly. The cyclone then curved northwestward, before turning back eastward and moving into Canada. As the cyclone moved through Canada, another cyclone formed on its southern periphery, which absorbed the original cyclone by October 17.

The extratropical cyclone deepened to a minimum central pressure of at least , and perhaps as low as , a pressure which would be equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS). Since the system was an extratropical cyclone, its wind field was neither as compact nor as strong as a tropical cyclone, though its wind field was significantly larger. All-time record-low land-based pressures (up to 1962) included at Astoria, at Hoquiam, Washington, and at North Bend, Oregon. The Astoria and Hoquiam records were broken by a major storm on December 12, 1995 (which measured at Astoria); however, this event did not generate winds as intense as the Columbus Day Storm of 1962.
==Wind speed highlights==
The peak winds were felt as the storm passed close by on October 12. At Cape Blanco on the southern Oregon coast, an anemometer that lost one of its cups registered wind gusts in excess of ; some reports put the peak velocity at . The north Oregon coast Mt. Hebo radar station reported winds of .

At the Naselle Radar Station in the Willapa Hills of southwest Washington, a wind gust of was observed.

In Salem, Oregon, a wind gust of was recorded.

At Corvallis, Oregon, an inland location in the Willamette Valley, one-minute average winds reached , with a gust to , before the station was abandoned due to &quot;power failure and instruments demolished&quot;. Observations at the weather station resumed the next day.

About to the north, at Portland, Oregon&#x27;s major metropolitan area, measured wind gusts reached at the Morrison Street Bridge in downtown Portland.

A peak gust of was recorded at Pearson Field in Vancouver, Washington, around 10 miles north of downtown Portland.

Many anemometers, official and unofficial, within the heavily stricken area of northwestern Oregon and southwest Washington were damaged or destroyed before winds attained maximum velocity. For example, the wind gauge atop the downtown Portland studios of KGW radio and TV recorded two gusts of , just before flying debris knocked the gauge off-line shortly after 5 p.m.

For the Willamette Valley, the lowest peak gust officially recorded was at Eugene. This value, however, is higher than the maximum peak gust generated by any other Willamette Valley windstorm in the 1948–2010 period.

In the interior of western Washington, officially measured wind gusts included at Olympia, at McChord Air Force Base, at Renton at and at Bellingham. In the city of Seattle, a peak wind speed of was recorded; this suggests gusts of at least . Damaging winds reached as far inland as Spokane.

Wind gusts of , the National Weather Service minimum for &quot;High Wind Criteria,&quot; or higher were reported from San Francisco, to Vancouver, British Columbia.

==Impact==
At least 46 fatalities were attributed to this storm, more than for any other Pacific Northwest weather event. Injuries went into the hundreds. In terms of natural disaster-related fatalities for the 20th century, only Oregon&#x27;s Heppner Flood of 1903 (247 deaths), Washington&#x27;s Wellington avalanche of 1910 (96 deaths), the Great Fire of 1910 (87 deaths), and Eruption of Mount St. Helens of 1980 (57 deaths) caused more. For Pacific Northwest windstorms in the 20th century, the runner up was the infamous October 21, 1934, gale, which caused 22 fatalities, mostly in Washington.

In less than 12 hours, more than 11 billion board feet (26,000,000 m3) of timber was blown down in northern California, Oregon and Washington combined; some estimates put it at 15 billion board feet (35,000,000 m3). This exceeded the annual timber harvest for Oregon and Washington at the time. This value is above any blowdown measured for East Coast storms, including hurricanes; even the often-cited 1938 New England hurricane, which toppled 2.65 billion board feet (6,300,000 m3), falls short by nearly an order of magnitude.

Estimates put the dollar damage at approximately $230 million to $280 million for California, Oregon, and Washington combined. Those figures in 1962 US dollars translate to $1.8 to $2.2 billion in 2014 US dollars. Oregon&#x27;s share exceeded $200 million in 1962 US dollars. This is comparable to land-falling hurricanes that occurred within the same time frame (for example, Audrey, Donna, and Carla from 1957 to 1961).

The Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. (now MetLife) named the Columbus Day Storm the nation&#x27;s worst natural disaster of 1962.

===California===
In Central and Northern California, all-time record rains associated with the atmospheric river along the cold front caused major flooding and mudslides, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area. Oakland set an all time calendar day record with of rain on the 13th, as did Sacramento with . More than of rainfall were recorded in the Bay area.

Heavy rain forced Game 6 of the 1962 World Series at San Francisco&#x27;s Candlestick Park to be postponed from its originally scheduled date of October 11 to Monday, October 15.

===Oregon===

In the Willamette Valley, it is said the undamaged home was the exception. Livestock suffered greatly due to the barn failures: the animals were crushed under the weight of the collapsed structures, a story that was repeated many times throughout the afflicted region. At the north end of the Valley, two high voltage transmission towers were toppled.

Radio and TV broadcasting were affected in the Portland area. KGW-TV lost its tower at Skyline and replaced the temporary tower with a new one on January 28, 1963. KOIN radio lost one of two AM towers at Sylvan. KPOJ-AM/-FM lost much of its transmitting equipment, plus one of two towers was left partially standing at Mount Scott. KPOJ-FM was so badly damaged it wouldn&#x27;t return to the air until February 9, 1963. KWJJ-AM lost one of its towers and a portion of its transmitter building at Smith Lake. KISN-AM also lost a tower at Smith Lake. Seven-month-old TV station KATU did not receive any damage at its Livingston Mountain site, north of Camas, Washington. However, KATU didn&#x27;t have a generator and power was cut off. The heavy-duty design of the radio towers on Portland&#x27;s West Hills today, with extensive and robust guy cables, is a direct result of the lessons learned from the 1962 catastrophe.

For northwest Oregon, the entire power distribution system had to be rebuilt from the ground up. Some locations did not have power restored for several weeks. This storm became a lasting memory for local power distributors. Indeed, a number of high wind related studies appeared in the years after the storm in an attempt to assess the return frequency of such potentially damaging winds.

The state capitol grounds at Salem, and the state&#x27;s college campuses, resembled battlefields with heavy losses of trees.

The Campbell Hall tower at Oregon College of Education (now Western Oregon University) in Monmouth crashed to the ground, an event recorded by student photographer Wes Luchau in the most prominent picture-symbol of the storm.

East of Salem, the wind destroyed a historic barn that served as a clandestine meeting place by pro-slavery Democratic members of the state Legislature in 1860.

The Oregon State Beavers–Washington Huskies college football game went on as scheduled Saturday, October 13 in Portland, in a heavily damaged Multnomah Stadium. Much of the roof was damaged and seats damaged by falling debris were replaced by portable chairs. Crews cleared debris from the grandstand and playing field right up to kickoff. Most of the electricity, including the scoreboard and clock, was still out and players dressed by candlelight in the locker rooms. The Huskies came from behind to beat the Beavers 14–13, despite a strong performance by quarterback Terry Baker, who would win the Heisman Trophy later that year.

===Washington===
The storm caused 9 fatalities in Washington, some from falling trees or downed power lines. The Willapa Hills and southern portion of the Olympic Peninsula incurred the worst damage in the state, losing entire stands of trees. The Department of Commerce estimated damage in six western counties at more than $20 million.

===British Columbia===
The storm weakened as it traveled north into British Columbia, with peak gusts measured at . Five people in British Columbia were killed in the storm, and the area suffered $80 million in damages. Stanley Park lost 3,000 trees. A Victoria resident described it as &quot;Just general devastation everywhere you went. There were trees breaking off and flying across the roads. Wind was just blowing the rain horizontal and trees were weaving all over the place. You didn&#x27;t know if you were going to get hit or not.&quot; At Victoria airport, a Martin Mars waterbomber (&quot;Caroline Mars&quot;) was hurled and irreparably damaged.

<text>The monumental complex of the Basilica and Convent of San Francisco of Lima, also known as &quot;San Francisco el Grande&quot; or &quot;San Francisco de Jesús&quot;, is located in the Historic Center of Lima, Peru. This church together with the Sanctuary Nuestra Señora de la Soledad and the Church del Milagro set up one of the welcoming and artistic corners of Lima. Ramón Menéndez Pidal, Spanish philologist and scholar in this regard commented: &quot;It is the largest and noblest monument that the conquest erected in these prodigious lands&quot;. 

The church and convent are part of the Historic Centre of Lima, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1991.

==Location in the city==

The Church of San Francisco de Jesús is located in the intersection of the third block of the Jirón Ancash (Calle San Francisco) with the first block of the Jirón Lampa (Calle Soledad).

==History==
This set of religious precincts is one of the most important and best architectural centers of the city. It is also one of the most extensive and beautiful legacies of the viceroyalty era, consequently becoming one of the cultural centers of Peru that generates increased interest in visitors. The buildings of the Sanctuary of Nuestra Señora de la Soledad, with a Neoclassical façade; the Convent of San Francisco itself, with a Baroque façade, and the Chapel del Milagro, with a Neoclassical façade, make up the monumental complex.

Once Lima was founded on January 18, 1535, by Francisco Pizarro, as is generally known, the plan of the city was drawn up and the lots were distributed. To the Franciscan Order of the Twelve Apostles, one of them next to Santo Domingo was ceded, on which Friar Francisco de la Cruz built a small ramada that he used as a chapel. After a while, Father De la Cruz had to leave, and since there was no other Franciscan in the valley, the lot was abandoned. Pizarro added it then to the one that had been given to the Dominicans and allocated another one for the Franciscans in the place that the Chapel del Milagro occupies today. In 1546, Francisco de Santa Ana arrived in Lima, who after recovering the land managed to build a modest and small church, which was later improved and expanded together with the convent by the Viceroy of Peru Andrés Hurtado de Mendoza, Protector of the Order. During the following century, the convent underwent a series of repairs and decorations that ended up turning it into a marvel of art in the colonial era. Its construction was not very solid at that time, so in 1614, the architect and major worker of the convent, Friar Miguel de Huerta, noticed that the pillars of the building had poor foundations and were placed on gravel.

On February 4, 1655, an earthquake occurred in Lima that brought down the Franciscan Convent, destroying its artistic riches and collapsing the entire effort of a century.

Francisco de Borja, general commissioner of the Order, was the one who contracted the services of the Portuguese architect Constantino de Vasconcellos, who drew up the plans, and the Liman master builder, Manuel Escobar, to commission them to build a new convent on the same site. And so it happened that the first stone was laid by the then-viceroy, Luis Enríquez de Guzmán, Count of Alba de Liste, on May 8, 1657, and then in 1669, the new general commissioner of the order, Friar Luis de Cervela, who managed to complete it.

The new convent was inaugurated with great pomp on October 3, 1672, with repairs inside the convent continuing until 1729. Inside today, the convent has attractions that will be described, together with its courtyards and gardens, which are surrounded by arcades with Sevillian azulejos plinths by the Hernando de Valladares workshop. According to the traditions written by Ricardo Palma, these azulejos were placed by Alonso Godínez, a native of Guadalajara, Spain, who had been sentenced to hang for having killed his wife, the same as being confessed by the guardian of the Basilica of San Francisco the same day of his execution, he communicated this ability to him. Without wasting time, the confessor immediately went to the Government Palace to request Godínez&#x27;s pardon, which he obtained on the condition that he would wear the habit of a lay brother and never again set foot outside the convent door. These Sevillian azulejos, brought directly from Seville, were donated by people like the famous Catalina Huanca, who was Francisco Pizarro&#x27;s goddaughter, who went from Huancayo to Lima with 50 packhorses loaded with gold and silver. On the other hand, the large amount of cedarwood, with which the different works of art presented by the convent were made, was sold by Pedro Jiménez Menacho, who was a wood importer, who received as payment according to Palma a small cup of chocolate. When savoring it, he left the canceled receipts on the table without waiting for his retribution. The wood was used in the coffered ceilings of the main cloister.
== Description of the facade and determination of its style ==

The facade is in a Liman Baroque style, with grace and monumentality. A rhythmic bossage runs through its walls that in its upper part is adorned by a wooden balustrade.

==Description of its interior==
The main altar is in a Neoclassical style. The interior also features the catacombs and the museum, the portal, the chapter house and the cloister. Crossing the threshold of its main doorway and to the left side is a memorial plaque of marble, with the emblem of the Holy See, with the following words engraved:


===Sacristy===
The sacristy of the main temple is one of the current jewels of the Franciscan temple. The works of the sacristy were completed in 1729, highlighting its portal, made in 1729 by the ensign Lucas de Meléndez. Its vault was deteriorated as a result of the 1966 earthquake. It was restored in the 1990s with the help of the Spanish government. It has a chest of drawers made in 1650 with reliefs of saints in its interior, intended to store clothing and liturgical vestments, and houses an important series of paintings of the &quot;apostolado&quot; attributed to the Francisco de Zurbarán Workshop.

===Anteportal===
Crossing the door of the convent, there is a spacious room, with baseboards adorned with azulejos, whose main attraction is a triptych of the Crucified Lord, whose side paintings are works by the Italian Angelino Medoro. There are also paintings from the Lima School, of great value.

===Portal===
The portal includes a wooden sculpture of Crucified Jesus; paintings of saints from the Catholic Church, from the 17th-century Lima School; as well as paintings from the Cusco School, and two paintings in the form of a medallion, which represent passages in the life of Francisco Solano, made to celebrate his canonization.

===Vestibule===
It is a spacious room with a carved wooden ceiling with baseboards featuring Sevillian azulejos. There are four paintings by famous artists, depicting Catholic saints; in the central part, the main attraction is an 18th-century Rococo-style pavilion, worked in wood and decorated in gold leaf. The pavilion was formerly used for the Corpus Christi festival; in it, a custody of the Cusco School was placed; today there is an image of Christ the Savior in Baroque style from the 18th century, which belongs to the sacristy of the temple.

===Main cloister===

It is a quadrilateral courtyard, surrounded by galleries in the form of semicircular arches, eleven per side, all of them supported by pilasters. The walls are decorated with Sevillian azulejos on the plinth, dating from 1642, the theme of the decorations being Franciscan saints.
This main cloister has a collection of 39 paintings made in 1671: They represent scenes from the life of Saint Francis of Assisi, the same ones that were painted by Liman artists. When the canvases were taken down in 1974, in order to restore them, mural paintings with mixed technique, tempera and oil, corresponding to the Italian Mannerist School, dating from the first third of the 17th century, were discovered by chance. They were made on the wall of walls; they are currently under investigation by professional restorers. In the corners of the cloister there are four altarpieces carved in wood, representing four moments in the life of Saint Francis of Assisi, altarpieces that were made between 1638 and 1640. The ceilings are in Mudéjar style, made entirely of cedar wood brought from Nicaragua.

===Chapter house===
It is where the Franciscans met to celebrate their conventual chapters and elect a new superior or discuss matters of major importance. There are two rows of seats with raised backs that surround the room and have in the center as a union of the two rows, the chair, main or tribune, which is crowned by the shield of the Order; In the center there is a high-relief wood carving with the image of Friar John Duns Scotus, as well as the image of the Immaculate Conception Patron Saint of the Franciscans, before whom they prayed before holding their meetings, in which they often took place. various problems between them, so the presence of the Viceroy&#x27;s guard was necessary.
The chapter house of this convent is a historical room, because in it the regular clergy signed the Act of Independence, while in the cathedral it was signed by members of the secular clergy. Another of the artistic values that we must highlight in this room is the presence of a canvas that represents Our Lady of la Antigua, a virgin with a dark complexion.

===Room of Biers===
Different biers are preserved in the room that serve for the processions of the saints of the Catholic Church. The following can be differentiated: one of embossed silver, which is used on the first Sunday of November of every year for the procession of the image of Jude the Apostle; another, carved in wood, and covered in gold leaf with fine openwork, made in 1732 on the occasion of the celebrations for the canonization of San Francisco Solano; and a third, destined for Saint Francis of Assisi, also worked in wood and covered in gold leaf, was made in 1672. It has been used for many years in the traditional &quot;Procesión del Paso&quot;, between the basilica of San Francisco and that of Santo Domingo.

=== Museum or Room of Profundis ===
Environment intended for the exhibition of a collection of eleven paintings of approximately three meters; each one represents the &quot;Passion of Christ&quot; and belong to the workshop of the great Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens, all of them of great execution, harmony of color and great expression in their characters. Like any teacher, Rubens dedicated himself only to making the sketch and his students continued working on it, often limiting themselves to giving the final touches. Also, the way in which a balcony with Mudéjar-style latticework is preserved here, called the &quot;balcony of Pizarro&quot;, because it was in the Government Palace. There are other important attractions such as the fact that, at the back of the room, there is an ivory crucifix, which was brought from the city of Manila, Philippines. There is a crypt in the center of the room where the protectors of the Order were buried.

===Refectory===

It is the location that was formerly used for the dining room. In this place is the famous collection of fifteen paintings that represent the Twelve Apostles, Christ the Redeemer, the Virgin Mary and Saint Paul, imposing paintings that belong to the artistic work of the Spanish master Francisco de Zurbarán. Zurbarán was a painter who made his works in the Baroque style, mostly on religious themes, in which the composition and color are totally fantastic, giving the impression of observing a natural image. The works of this artist are in the best museums in the world. Accompanying this Zurbarán collection is the outstanding collection of ten canvases representing the Apostles, which are a 19th-century copy of Rubens&#x27; Apostolate that is in the Prado Museum. At the back of this room there is a huge canvas of the Last Supper, made in 1658 by a Belgian Jesuit that only his name was registered as Diego de la Puente. He lived in this church.

===Antesacristy===
Here there is an immense canvas of five by six meters, which represents the family tree of the Franciscan Order, a work that dates from 1734; it is a Liman painting by an unknown author.

===Upper cloister===
Upon reaching it is the top of the convent, from where the garden with the five bronze fountains can be seen. In the corners there are four of the 27 alabaster crosses that were initially located on the perimeter of the atrium or square of the building complex. In this part of the Convent are also the rooms of the Franciscans. Its primitive columns were made of black stone brought from Panama. Subsequently, they were withdrawn due to deterioration due to strong seismic movements and replaced by the current ones of greater consistency. There are also paintings on the walls here with images of Catholic saints.

===Choir===
The choir was made in 1658 by the Quitoan-Franciscan-builder Antonio Rodríguez. In earlier times, the Franciscans used to gather here for their services or religious ceremonies. It is a rectangular piece, measuring long by wide, where an impressive Baroque choir stalls, carved in cedar, which extends on both sides, are preserved. It also consists of 130 seats, having in the central part, as a union of the two rows, the main seat of the Guardian of the Order, the same one that has on its back a carving of the embrace of Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Dominic.

The stalls are preciously carved and engraved. In the second row, the figures of 71 images of the Christian religion can be seen in high relief, which are separated by small corbels in the form of caryatids. In the center is the lectern, a revolving piece of furniture where the songbooks were placed. All the wood that was used for the work of this chairs is totally cedar, brought from Costa Rica during the 17th century and made in total Baroque style.

===Library===

In the library, there are approximately 25,000 volumes, some dating to the 16th century. There are very rare editions, incunabulas and Franciscan chronicles from the 15th to the 18th century, as well as some volumes published in the early days of printing in Peru, as well as more than six thousand parchments, numerous works by Jesuits, Augustinians, Benedictines, etc. There are also books on theology, philosophy, history, literature, music, canon law, ecclesiastical law; Bibles written in Latin, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian and some written in very rare languages.

===Conventual archive===
The San Francisco Archive is the place where the historical documents of the Franciscan province of the 12 apostles of Peru are preserved. Here are the handwritten proofs of the negotiations carried out with Spain and Rome by the Franciscan Order since its arrival in the Americas, especially in Peru. There is also graphic material such as maps, photographic plans, musical material and a small auxiliary library. They are currently organizing it in a systematic way to be more useful to its users, starting these works in 1983, and counting since 1987 with the help of UNESCO.

===Dome===

Halfway up to the second floor on the woven brick staircase that is on the left hand side is the Mudéjar dome, which, by its finish and dimensions has no comparison on the entire American continent. It was initially built in 1546 and after an earthquake was finally re-built in 1655 with wood brought from Costa Rica by Friar Miguel de Huerta. In addition, on the wall there are two canvases with scenes from the life of Saint Didacus of Alcalá, patron saint of the nurses of the Franciscan Order.

===Cloister of Holy Land===
It is so named because the coat of arms of the Holy Land can still be seen there. It was the preferred lodging of the Father General Commissioner, who is inside.

===Catacombs===
The building includes catacombs, which were the old cemetery in colonial times. It operated as such until 1810 and it is estimated that at that time it must have housed up to 70,000 people. Today the different rooms contain a good number of bones classified by type and arranged on some occasions in a rather artistic fashion, such as those in the mass grave. Some doors of this crypt, according to some hypotheses, lead to corridors that communicate with other churches and even with the Government Palace. The catacombs were discovered in 1951.

<text>Jaime Sabines Gutiérrez (March 25, 1926 – March 19, 1999) was a Mexican contemporary poet. Known as “the sniper of Literature” as he formed part of a group that transformed literature into reality, he wrote ten volumes of poetry, and his work has been translated into more than twelve languages. His writings chronicle the experience of everyday people in places such as the street, hospital, and playground. Sabines was also a politician.

==Biography==
Jaime Sabines Gutiérrez was born on March 25, 1926, in Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas. He was of Lebanese and Spanish descent.

Before he devoted himself to the study of literature, he spent three years studying medicine before moving on to his real vocation:literature, studying at UNAM Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. Sabines was an outstanding member of the Mexican Writers Centre from 1964 to 1965 and part of the jury for the Casa de las Americas prize. In addition to his literary activity, he participated in politics and became a federal deputy for the First District of Chiapas from 1976 to 1979, and for the Federal District in 1988. Sabines was awarded the Chiapas Award (1979), the Xavier Villaurrutia Award (1972), the Elias Sourasky Award (1982) and the National Literature Award (1983).

A collection of his work, &quot;Nuevo recuento de poemas&quot;, was issued by the publisher Joaquín Mortiz in 1977, and the Secretariat of Public Education in 1986. In 1994 he received from the Senate of Mexico the Belisario Domínguez Medal of Honor; in 1995, his selected poems, &quot;Pieces of Shadow&quot; (trans. W.S. Merwin), was brought out in a bilingual edition by Papeles Privados; and in 2004 Exile Editions (Toronto, Canada) published a bilingual volume of two early Sabines books, Adam and Eve &amp; Weekly Diary and Poems in Prose (trans. Colin Carberry.) Octavio Paz considered him “one of the greatest contemporary poets of our [Spanish] language.”

Sabines died on March 19, 1999.

<text>Homologies are &quot;structural &#x27;resonances&#x27;...between the different elements making up a socio-cultural whole.&quot; (Middleton 1990, p. 9)

Examples include Alan Lomax&#x27;s cantometrics, which:
:Distinguishes ten musical styles, dealing most fully with Eurasian and Old European styles. These are correlated with sexual permissiveness, status of women, and treatment of children as the principal formative social influences. The musical styles are at the same time symbolic or expressive of such social influences, especially in the various musical communities of Spain and Italy, and are stable, persistent. Lomax states his expectation that further study and refinement of methods of measurement will increase our understanding of the relationships of musical style and culture in a way that Western European musical notation cannot adequately accomplish.

Richard Middleton (1990, p. 9-10) argues that &quot;such theories always end up in some kind of reductionism – &#x27;upwards&#x27;, into an idealist cultural spirit, &#x27;downwards&#x27;, into economism, sociologism or technologism, or by &#x27;circumnavigation&#x27;, in a functionalist holism.&quot; However, he &quot;would like to hang on to the notion of homology in a qualified sense. For it seems likely that some signifying structures are more easily articulated to the interests of one group than are some others; similarly, that they are more easily articulated to the interests of one group than to those of another. This is because, owing to the existence of what Paul Willis calls the &#x27;objective possibilities&#x27; (and limitations) of material and ideological structures, it is easier to find links and analogies between them in some cases than in others (Willis 1978: 198-201).&quot;

<text>Jean-Baptiste-Louis Gros (1793–1870), also known as Baron Gros, was a French diplomat and later senator, as well as a notable pioneer of photography.

==Life and career==
He entered the French diplomatic service in 1823 and was given the title of baron in 1829 during the Bourbon Restoration. He was dispatched to Bogotá (1838–1842) as &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; during the Colombian Civil War, and later elsewhere in Latin America, before being recalled to Europe and then sent as Minister Plenipotentiary to Athens in 1850.

He served as Ambassador to London (1852–1863), traveling extensively, including to China and Japan in 1857 and 1858. He was an ambassador during the Anglo-French expedition to China (1856-1860). On 9 October 1858, the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between France and Japan was concluded at Edo, to which he was a signatory; this treaty established diplomatic relations between the two imperial nations.

In September 1858, he was named to the French Senate, where he served until his death in 1870.

He produced many famous photographs — chief among them those of the Acropolis in Greece. While he is best known for his daguerreotypes, he painted a few Latin American landscape paintings which are quite striking for their realism. Baron Gros, a member of The Photographic Society, also photographed The Great Exhibition of 1851 in London.

==Honours==
 Baron (1829) &lt;br&gt;
 Knight, Order of Santiago (1839) &lt;br&gt;
 Grand-croix, Légion d&#x27;honneur (1861)

<text>The California Academy of Mathematics and Science (CAMS) is a public magnet high school in Carson, California, United States focusing on science and mathematics. Its California API scores are fourth-highest in the state.

Located on the campus of California State University, Dominguez Hills, CAMS shares many facilities with the university, including the gymnasium, the student union, the tennis courts, the pool, the library and a few of the parking lots. It is a National &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; Blue Ribbon (2011) and California Distinguished school. The No Child Left Behind blue ribbon was only presented to 32 public schools nationwide. Newsweek states in its top 1200 High Schools in the USA, CAMS is in the top 4% taking number 281 in 2006.

In the December 2007, Newsweek released the results of a two-year study to determine the 100 best High Schools in the United States of America. Out of the 18,000+ schools reviewed, CAMS made it into the top 100 as number 21. As of August 24, 2016, CAMS moved up in ranking to the 100th best high school in the nation. In California CAMS is ranked 10th in the state.

According to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, as of November 2019 CAMS is rated as the 46th best high school in the nation, and the 5th best in California. It also ranks as the best magnet high school in California.

==General information==
The California Academy of Mathematics and Science (CAMS) opened on the California State University at Dominguez Hills (CSUDH) campus in 1990, the product of partnerships among CSUDH, the California State University’s Chancellor’s Office, a consortium of eleven local school districts, and defense industries. Long Beach Unified School District serves as the managing school district fiscal agent. Today, CAMS ranks in the top ten schools in California on the NCLB Academic Performance Index; its students score well above state and national averages on the math and verbal SATs. Average student daily attendance in 2003-04 was 98%. Attrition is less than 5% for all reasons, as opposed to a 50% drop-out rate in some local high schools. 95% of CAMS students go on to four-year colleges and universities, including the most selective and prestigious in the nation. (Approximately 5% attend community colleges.)

Although CAMS winnows about 175 students from about a thousand of 9th grade applicants each year, CAMS does not rank its applicants for acceptance, but accepts students from each of its 75 feeder schools including predominately inner-city middle schools. Its mission is to “defy the odds” and prove that students, especially those from academically deprived environments, can excel in math and science, given a setting that features integrated curriculum, teamwork, and real world applications of learning. Faculty refer to CAMS as a “talent development program.”

Class size is relatively large, between 30-40 students. The school receives about $5,500 per student annually, placing CAMS is on par with the state average for high schools. (CAMS’s base funding is $4,400 per student; private donations and special legislative funding make up the rest.)

==Campus==
Because CAMS is on the CSUDH campus, juniors and seniors may enroll in university courses (and some CAMS teachers teach at CSUDH). In the past, students were able to begin taking courses on CSUDH campus as early as their sophomore year. CAMS students may graduate with as many as 20 college credits—an advantage for students applying to selective colleges and/or advancing to early college graduation, particularly with CSUDH summer classes through a Honda-sponsored program.

In 1993 the school placed 11 students in university dormitories so they could better focus on their studies. Three of the teachers also used dormitories. Two foundations funded the use of the dormitories.

==History==
Created in 1990 by Dr. Kathleen Clark, CAMS was originally composed of the Southern Academic Complex (SAC) and was relatively small in comparison to now. About six years ago new buildings were constructed to help accommodate the students population. Now phase II is complete. The last building was finished midway through the 2007-2008 school year. Only CAMS seniors are currently granted access to CSUDH&#x27;s newly completed student union during lunch hours. Dr. Clark retired at the end of the 2006-2007 school year after having been principal for as long as the graduating class of 2007 had been alive. Dr. Filer, previously vice-principal, became the new principal beginning with the 2007-2008 school year. Dr. Filer retired at the beginning of the 2013-2014 school year, and Mr. Brown became the principal.

==Athletics==
California Academy of Math &amp; Science beat Animo 2-1 in a CIF Southern Section Division VII semifinal on 3/3/2010 at Beckham Field at the Home Depot Center. After its third Delphic League Championship in a row under 4th-year Head Coach Jim Watwood (2010 LB Press Telegram Coach of the year) and reaching a semifinal last year, top seed CAMS (17-2-1) advanced to its first CIF final, where it faced No. 2 seed Sierra Vista. In the last seconds of the game, Sierra Vista scored on a controversial cross to tie the game 1-1. The Royals went on to lose in penalty kicks 5-4. It marked the first CIF final for CAMS soccer and the school&#x27;s second CIF team title game. The CAMS girls tennis team won the school&#x27;s first CIF team title in 2006.

<text>Cape Turnagain is a prominent headland on the east coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, part way between Hawke Bay and Cook Strait, between the mouths of the Pōrangahau and Ākitio Rivers.

The cape was named by Captain James Cook in 1769. On his journey of discovery, he sailed south to this point where he was met with atrocious sea conditions, typical of the area. Being unable to safely proceed, he decided to turn and head north and sailed anticlockwise around the North Island of New Zealand and upon reaching the same place turned again southwards &amp; named the point as a result of his decision.

The Māori name for Cape Turnagain is Te Aho a Māui, which means “Māui’s fishing line”, in reference to the Māori mythology story of Māui and his brothers fishing up the land mass now known as the North Island.

Cape Turnagain is north-west of Chatham Island, making it the nearest point of mainland New Zealand to Chatham Island.

The cape is one of the windiest places in New Zealand, frequently recording annual extremes for wind speed. Winds gusts of were recorded at the cape on 10 September 2021, on 14 June 2022, and on 17 September 2023.

<text>Adventures in Foam is the first album by Brazilian electronic musician Amon Tobin, and the only one to be released under the name Cujo (Portuguese for &quot;whose&quot;). It was first released in September 1996 on the small south London label Ninebar records. This was around when Tobin signed with Ninja Tune to record under his name.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Stranger&quot;, in a retrospective article on Tobin, called the album a &quot;triphop classic.&quot;

Peter Shapiro, in &quot;Drum &#x27;n&#x27; Bass: The Rough Guide&quot;, called the album &quot;a further exercise in jazz-based sampladelic quirkiness that was a bit too clever, a bit too blunted and bit too broad-minded to really work.&quot;

== Track listing ==

=== Original Ninebar edition ===
The track lists of the original CD and LP versions, as released in the UK on 16 September 1996, were as follows:



=== US (Shadow Records) edition ===

The album was released in the United States, with an altered track listing and artwork unapproved by Tobin, by Shadow Records on 27 May 1997 – after the release of Tobin&#x27;s first Ninja Tune album, &quot;Bricolage&quot;.
=== Ninja Tune reissue ===
The Ninja Tune edition adds six tracks to the original Ninebar edition.

<text>Pōrangahau is a small township close to the Pacific Ocean coast in the south-east of the North Island of New Zealand. It lies in the southernmost part of Hawke&#x27;s Bay, 45 kilometres south of Waipukurau, and close to the mouth of the Pōrangahau River. The settlement includes a marae and a school.

The Māori name &quot;Pōrangahau&quot; expresses the idea of a night (&quot;pō&quot;) of pursuit or of retreat (&quot;rangahau&quot;).

Six kilometres southwest of the township stands an insubstantial hill, with the longest place name in the world: .

The area west of the main township, known as Mangaorapa, was used for sheep farming during the 20th century. The area has more recently been used for cattle farming and wine growing. The 2370 hectare Mangaorapa Station was the most expensive farm in Central Hawke&#x27;s Bay when it was sold in 2005.

<doc id="1200251" wikidata="Q1035922" url="?curid=1200251" title="Bombing of Kassa">
<text>The bombing of Kassa took place on 26 June 1941, when still unidentified aircraft conducted an airstrike on the city of Kassa, then part of Hungary, today Košice in Slovakia. This attack became the pretext for the government of Hungary to declare war on the Soviet Union the next day, 27 June.

On 26 June 1941, four days after Germany attacked the Soviet Union in violation of the Molotov–Ribbentrop non-aggression treaty as a part of Operation Barbarossa, three unidentified planes bombed the city, killing and wounding over a dozen people and causing minor material damage. Numerous buildings were hit, including the local post and telegraph office.

Hours after the attack, the Hungarian cabinet &quot;passed a resolution calling for the declaration of the existence of a state of war between Hungary and the USSR.&quot; The local military investigators at the time believed that the attackers were Soviet, but the true identity of the attacking nation has never been established. The official explanation preferred by Soviet historians was the idea of a attack by Germany to provoke Hungary into attacking the Soviet Union, employing Soviet planes captured on conquered airfields. Another possibility is that the Soviet bombers mistook Kassa for a nearby city in the First Slovak Republic, which was already at war with the Soviet Union. Captain Ádám Krúdy, the commander of the Kassa military airfield, identified the attackers as German Heinkel He 111 bombers in his official report but was ordered to keep silent about it. Another problem with the German conspiracy theory was the fact that German planes did not have bomb racks capable of holding Soviet bombs. According to Dreisziger, &quot;it seems that the bombs dropped on Kassa were 100 kg bombs while the standard stock of the Luftwaffe were the 50 and 250 kg bombs.&quot; During the Nuremberg trials, the USSR brought forth a statement allegedly taken from Hungarian Major General István Újszászy. According to the testimony, &quot;the Kassa &#x27;plot&#x27; was hatched by German and Hungarian officers and carried out by &#x27;German planes with Russian markings&#x27;.&quot; This theory was introduced because he found that, following the Kassa bombings, certain officers behaved suspiciously, not due to concrete evidence. The reliability of his testimony was devalued due to the nature of his interrogation, which may have been under duress.

In his memoirs, Admiral Miklós Horthy, Hungary&#x27;s head of state in the interwar period, stated that Hungary&#x27;s entry into World War II had been provoked by the &quot;staged&quot; bombing of Kassa carried out by German pilots. He also accused General Henrik Werth, the Hungarian Chief of Staff, of being a part of the conspiracy.

The most plausible explanation for the bombing was that Kassa was accidentally targeted by Soviet bombers attempting to bomb Prešov following the Slovak declaration of war against the USSR.

<doc id="1200252" wikidata="Q1092510" url="?curid=1200252" title="First Red Scare">
<text>The first Red Scare was a period during the early 20th-century history of the United States marked by a widespread fear of far-left movements, including Bolshevism and anarchism, due to real and imagined events; real events included the Russian 1917 October Revolution, German Revolution of 1918–1919, and anarchist bombings in the U.S. At its height in 1919–1920, concerns over the effects of radical political agitation in American society and the alleged spread of socialism, communism, and anarchism in the American labor movement fueled a general sense of concern.

The scare had its origins in the hyper-nationalism of World War I as well as the Russian Revolution. At the war&#x27;s end, following the October Revolution, American authorities saw the threat of communist revolution in the actions of organized labor, including such disparate cases as the Seattle General Strike and the Boston Police Strike and then in the bombing campaign directed by anarchist groups at political and business leaders. Fueled by labor unrest and the anarchist bombings, and then spurred on by the Palmer Raids and attempts by United States Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer to suppress radical organizations, it was characterized by exaggerated rhetoric, illegal searches and seizures, unwarranted arrests and detentions, and the deportation of several hundred suspected radicals and anarchists. In addition, the growing anti-immigration nativist movement among Americans viewed increasing immigration from Southern Europe and Eastern Europe as a threat to American political and social stability.

Bolshevism and the threat of a communist-inspired revolution in the U.S. became the overriding explanation for challenges to the social order, even for such largely unrelated events as incidents of interracial violence during the Red Summer of 1919. Fear of radicalism was used to explain the suppression of freedom of expression in the form of display of certain flags and banners. In April 1920, concerns peaked with J. Edgar Hoover telling the nation to prepare for a bloody uprising on May Day. Police and militias prepared for the worst, but May Day passed without incident. Soon, public opinion and the courts turned against Palmer, putting an end to his raids and the first Red Scare.

==Origins==

In reaction to subversive and militant leftist actions in the United States, the United States Congress passed the Espionage Act in 1917, the Sedition Act of 1918, and the Immigration Act of 1918. The Espionage Act made it a crime to interfere with the operation or success of the military, and the Sedition Act forbade Americans to use &quot;disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language&quot; about the United States government, flag, or armed forces of the United States during war. The Immigration Act of 1918 targeted anarchists by name and was used to deport Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman and Luigi Galleani, among others.

== Progression of events==

===Seattle General Strike===

On January 21, 1919, 35,000 shipyard workers in Seattle went on strike seeking wage increases. They appealed to the Seattle Central Labor Council for support from other unions and found widespread enthusiasm. Within two weeks, more than 100 local unions joined in a call on February 3 for a general strike to begin on the morning of February 6. The 60,000 total strikers paralyzed the city&#x27;s normal activities, like streetcar service, schools, and ordinary commerce, while their General Strike Committee maintained order and provided essential services, like trash collection and milk deliveries.

Even before the strike began, the press tried to persuade the unions to reconsider. In part they were frightened by some of labor&#x27;s rhetoric, like the labor newspaper editorial that proclaimed: &quot;We are undertaking the most tremendous move ever made by labor in this country  ... We are starting on a road that leads – NO ONE KNOWS WHERE!&quot; Daily newspapers saw the general strike as a foreign import: &quot;This is America – not Russia,&quot; one said when denouncing the general strike. The non-striking part of Seattle&#x27;s population imagined the worst and stocked up on food. Hardware stores sold their stock of guns.

Seattle Mayor Ole Hanson announced that he had 1500 police and 1500 federal troops on hand to put down any disturbances. He personally oversaw their deployment throughout the city. &quot;The time has come&quot;, he said, &quot;for the people in Seattle to show their Americanism  ... The anarchists in this community shall not rule its affairs.&quot; He promised to use them to replace striking workers, but never carried out that threat.

Meanwhile, the national leadership of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and international leaders of some of the Seattle locals recognized how inflammatory the general strike was proving in the eyes of the American public and Seattle&#x27;s middle class. Press and political reaction made the general strike untenable, and they feared Seattle labor would lose gains made during the war if it continued. The national press called the general strike &quot;Marxian&quot; and &quot;a revolutionary movement aimed at existing government&quot;. &quot;It is only a middling step&quot;, said the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;from Petrograd to Seattle.&quot;

As early as February 8 some unions began to return to work at the urging of their leaders. Some workers went back to work as individuals, perhaps fearful of losing their jobs if the Mayor acted on his threats or in reaction to the pressure of life under the general strike. The executive committee of the General Strike Committee first recommended ending the general strike on February 8 but lost that vote. Finally on February 10, the General Strike Committee voted to end the strike the next day. The original strike in the shipyards continued.

Though the general strike collapsed because labor leadership viewed it as a misguided tactic from the start, Mayor Hanson took credit for ending the five-day strike and was hailed for it by the press. He resigned a few months later and toured the country giving lectures on the dangers of &quot;domestic bolshevism&quot;. He earned $38,000 in seven months, five times his annual salary as mayor. He published a pamphlet called &quot;Americanism versus Bolshevism&quot;.

===Overman Committee===

The Overman Committee was a special five-man subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary chaired by North Carolina Democrat Lee Slater Overman. First charged with investigating German subversion during World War I, its mandate was extended on February 4, 1919, just a day after the announcement of the Seattle General Strike, to study &quot;any efforts being made to propagate in this country the principles of any party exercising or claiming to exercise any authority in Russia&quot; and &quot;any effort to incite the overthrow of the Government of this country&quot;. The Committee&#x27;s hearings into Bolshevik propaganda, conducted from February 11 to March 10, 1919, developed an alarming image of Bolshevism as an imminent threat to the U.S. government and American values. The Committee&#x27;s final report appeared in June 1919.

Archibald E. Stevenson, a New York attorney with ties to the Justice Department, probably as a &quot;volunteer spy&quot;, testified on January 22, 1919, during the German phase of the subcommittee&#x27;s work. He established that anti-war and anti-draft activism during World War I, which he described as pro-German activity, had now transformed itself into propaganda &quot;developing sympathy for the Bolshevik movement&quot;. America&#x27;s wartime enemy, though defeated, had exported an ideology that now ruled Russia and threatened America anew. &quot;The Bolshevik movement is a branch of the revolutionary socialism of Germany. It had its origin in the philosophy of Marx and its leaders were Germans.&quot; He cited the propaganda efforts of John Reed and gave many examples from the foreign press. He told the senators that &quot;We have found money coming into this country from Russia.&quot;

The senators were particularly interested in how Bolshevism had united many disparate elements on the left, including anarchists and socialists of many types, &quot;providing a common platform for all these radical groups to stand on&quot;. Senator Knute Nelson, Republican of Minnesota, responded by enlarging Bolshevism&#x27;s embrace to include an even larger segment of political opinion: &quot;Then they have really rendered a service to the various classes of progressives and reformers that we have here in this country.&quot; Other witnesses described the horrors of the revolution in Russia and the consequences of a comparable revolution in the United States: the imposition of atheism, the seizure of newspapers, assaults on banks, and the abolition of the insurance industry. The senators heard various views of women in Russia, including claims that women had been made the property of the state.

The press reveled in the investigation and the final report, referring to the Russians as &quot;assassins and madmen&quot;, &quot;human scum&quot;, &quot;crime mad&quot;, and &quot;beasts&quot;. The occasional testimony by some who viewed the Bolshevik Revolution favorably lacked the punch of its critics. One extended headline in February read:

On the release of the final report, newspapers printed sensational articles with headlines in capital letters: &quot;Red Peril Here&quot;, &quot;Plan Bloody Revolution&quot;, and &quot;Want Washington Government Overturned&quot;.

===Anarchist bombings===

There were several anarchist bombings in 1919.

====April 1919 mail bombs====
In late April 1919, approximately 36 booby trap bombs were mailed to prominent politicians, including the Attorney General of the United States, judges, businessmen (including John D. Rockefeller), and a Bureau of Investigation field agent, R. W. Finch, who happened to be investigating the &quot;Galleanist&quot; organization.

The bombs were mailed in identical packages and were timed to arrive on May Day, the day of celebration of organized labor and the working class. A few of the packages went undelivered because they lacked sufficient postage. One bomb intended for Seattle Mayor Ole Hanson, who had opposed the Seattle General Strike, arrived early and failed to explode as intended. Seattle police in turn notified the Post Office and other police agencies. On April 29, a package sent to U.S. Senator Thomas W. Hardwick of Georgia, a sponsor of the Anarchist Exclusion Act, exploded injuring his wife and housekeeper. On April 30, a post office employee in New York City recognized sixteen packages by their wrapping and interrupted their delivery. Another twelve bombs were recovered before reaching their targets.

====June 1919 bombs====
In June 1919, eight bombs, far larger than those mailed in April, exploded almost simultaneously in several U.S. cities. These new bombs were believed to contain up to twenty-five pounds of dynamite, and all were wrapped or packaged with heavy metal slugs designed to act as shrapnel. All of the intended targets had participated in some way with the investigation of or the opposition to anarchist radicals. Along with Attorney General Palmer, who was targeted a second time, the intended victims included a Massachusetts state representative and a New Jersey silk manufacturer. Fatalities included a New York City night watchman, William Boehner, and one of the bombers, Carlo Valdinoci, a Galleanist radical who died in spectacular fashion when the bomb he placed at the home of Attorney General Palmer exploded in his face. Though not seriously injured, Attorney General Palmer and his family were thoroughly shaken by the blast, and their home was largely demolished.

All of the bombs were delivered with pink flyers bearing the title &quot;Plain Words&quot; that accused the intended victims of waging class war and promised: &quot;We will destroy to rid the world of your tyrannical institutions.&quot; Police and the Bureau of Investigation tracked the flyer to a print shop owned by an anarchist, Andrea Salcedo, but never obtained sufficient evidence for a prosecution. Evidence from Valdonoci&#x27;s death, bomb components, and accounts from participants later tied both bomb attacks to the Galleanists. Though some of the Galleanists were deported or left the country voluntarily, attacks by remaining members continued until 1932.

===May Day 1919===
The American labor movement had been celebrating its May Day holiday since the 1890s and had seen none of the violence associated with the day&#x27;s events in Europe. On May 1, 1919, the left mounted especially large demonstrations, and violence greeted the normally peaceful parades in Boston, New York, and Cleveland. In Boston, police tried to stop a march that lacked a permit. In the ensuing melee both sides fought for possession of the Socialists&#x27; red flags. One policeman was shot and died of his wounds; a second officer died of a heart attack. William Sidis was arrested. Later a mob attacked the Socialist headquarters. Police arrested 114, all from the Socialist side. Each side&#x27;s newspapers provided uncritical support to their own the next day. In New York, soldiers in uniform burned printed materials at the Russian People&#x27;s House and forced immigrants to sing the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot;.

Cleveland, Ohio saw the worst violence. Leftists protesting the imprisonment of Eugene V. Debs and promoting the campaign of Charles Ruthenberg, the Socialist candidate for mayor, planned to march through the center of the city. A group of Victory Loan workers, a nationalist organization whose members sold war bonds and thought themselves still at war against all forms of anti-Americanism, tried to block some of the marchers and a melee ensued. A mob ransacked Ruthenberg&#x27;s headquarters. Mounted police, army trucks, and tanks restored order. Two people died, forty were injured, and 116 arrested. Local newspapers noted that only 8 of those arrested were born in the United States. The city government immediately passed laws to restrict parades and the display of red flags.

With few dissents, newspapers blamed the May Day marchers for provoking the nationalists&#x27; response. The Salt Lake City &quot;Tribune&quot; did not think anyone had a right to march. It said: &quot;Free speech has been carried to the point where it is an unrestrained menace.&quot; A few, however, thought the marches were harmless and that the marchers&#x27; enthusiasm would die down on its own if they were left unmolested.

===Race riots===
More than two dozen American communities, mostly urban areas or industrial centers, saw racial violence in the summer and early fall of 1919. Unlike earlier race riots in U.S. history, the 1919 riots were among the first in which blacks responded with resistance to white attacks. Martial law was imposed in Charleston, South Carolina, where men of the U.S. Navy led a race riot on May 10. Five white men and eighteen black men were injured in the riot. An official investigation found that four U.S. sailors and one civilian—all white men—were responsible for the outbreak of violence. On July 3, the 10th U.S. Cavalry, a segregated African American unit founded in 1866, was attacked by local police in Bisbee, Arizona. Two of the most violent episodes occurred in Washington, D.C., and Chicago. In Washington, D.C., white men, many in military uniforms, responded to the rumored arrest of a black man for rape with four days of mob violence, rioting and beatings of random black people on the street. When police refused to intervene, the black population fought back. When the violence ended, ten whites were dead, including two police officers, and 5 blacks. Some 150 people had been the victims of attacks. The rioting in Chicago started on July 27. Chicago&#x27;s beaches along Lake Michigan were segregated in practice, if not by law. A black youth who drifted into the area customarily reserved for whites was stoned and drowned. Blacks responded violently when the police refused to take action. Violence between mobs and gangs lasted 13 days. The resulting 38 fatalities included 23 blacks and 15 whites. Injuries numbered 537 injured, and 1,000 black families were left homeless. Some 50 people were reported dead. Unofficial numbers were much higher. Hundreds of mostly black homes and businesses on the South Side were destroyed by mobs, and a militia force of several thousand was called in to restore order.

In mid-summer, in the middle of the Chicago riots, a &quot;federal official&quot; told the &quot;New York Times&quot; that the violence resulted from &quot;an agitation, which involves the I.W.W., Bolshevism and the worst features of other extreme radical movements&quot;. He supported that claim with copies of negro publications that called for alliances with leftist groups, praised the Soviet regime, and contrasted the courage of jailed Socialist Eugene V. Debs with the &quot;school boy rhetoric&quot; of traditional black leaders. The &quot;Times&quot; characterized the publications as &quot;vicious and apparently well financed,&quot; mentioned &quot;certain factions of the radical Socialist elements&quot;, and reported it all under the headline: &quot;Reds Try to Stir Negroes to Revolt&quot;.

In mid-October, government sources again provided the &quot;New York Times&quot; with evidence of Bolshevist propaganda targeting America&#x27;s black communities that was &quot;paralleling the agitation that is being carried on in industrial centres of the North and West, where there are many alien laborers&quot;. Vehicles for this propaganda about the &quot;doctrines of Lenin and Trotzky&quot; included newspapers, magazines, and &quot;so-called &#x27;negro betterment&#x27; organizations&quot;. Quotations from such publications contrasted the recent violence in Chicago and Washington, D.C., with &quot;Soviet Russia, a country in which dozens of racial and lingual types have settled their many differences and found a common meeting ground, a country which no longer oppresses colonies, a country from which the lynch rope is banished and in which racial tolerance and peace now exist.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot; cited one publication&#x27;s call for unionization: &quot;Negroes must form cotton workers&#x27; unions. Southern white capitalists know that the negroes can bring the white bourbon South to its knees. So go to it.&quot;

===Strikes===
====Boston police strike====

The American Federation of Labor (AFL) began granting charters to police unions in June 1919 when pressed to do so by local groups, and in just 5 months had recognized affiliate police unions in 37 cities. The Boston Police rank and file went out on strike on September 9, 1919 in order to achieve recognition for their union and improvements in wages and working conditions. Police Commissioner Edwin Upton Curtis denied that police officers had any right to form a union, much less one affiliated with a larger organization like the AFL. During the strike, Boston experienced two nights of lawlessness until several thousand members of the State Guard supported by volunteers restored order, though not without causing several deaths. The public, fed by lurid press accounts and hyperbolic political observers, viewed the strike with a degree of alarm out of proportion to the events, which ultimately produced only about $35,000 of property damage.

The strikers were called &quot;deserters&quot; and &quot;agents of Lenin.&quot; The Philadelphia &quot;Public Ledger&quot; viewed the Boston violence in the same light as many other of 1919&#x27;s events: &quot;Bolshevism in the United States is no longer a specter. Boston in chaos reveals its sinister substance.&quot; President Woodrow Wilson, speaking from Montana, branded the walkout &quot;a crime against civilization&quot; that left the city &quot;at the mercy of an army of thugs&quot;. The timing of the strike also happened to present the police union in the worst light. September 10, the first full day of the strike, was also the day a huge New York City parade celebrated the return of General John J. Pershing, the hero of the American Expeditionary Force.

A report from Washington, D.C., included this headline: &quot;Senators Think Effort to Sovietize the Government Is Started&quot;. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge saw in the strike the dangers of the national labor movement: &quot;If the American Federation of Labor succeeds in getting hold of the police in Boston it will go all over the country, and we shall be in measurable distance of Soviet government by labor unions.&quot; The &quot;Ohio State Journal&quot; opposed any sympathetic treatment of the strikers: &quot;When a policeman strikes, he should be debarred not only from resuming his office, but from citizenship as well. He has committed the unpardonable sin; he has forfeited all his rights.&quot;

Samuel Gompers of the AFL recognized that the strike was damaging labor in the public mind and advised the strikers to return to work. The Police Commissioner, however, remained adamant and refused to re-hire the striking policemen. He was supported by Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, whose rebuke of Gompers earned him a national reputation. Famous as a man of few words, he put the anti-union position simply: &quot;There is no right to strike against the public safety, anywhere, anytime.&quot;

The strike proved another setback for labor and the AFL immediately withdrew its recognition of police unions. Coolidge won the Republican nomination for Vice-President in the 1920 presidential election in part due to his actions during the Boston Police Strike.

==== 1918–1920 New York City rent strikes ====
Following a housing and coal shortage caused by the mobilization for World War I, a wave of rent strikes occurred across all of New York City and Jersey City from 1918 to 1920. While it is unclear exactly how many tenants were involved, at least tens of thousands and likely hundreds of thousands tenants struck. 

In response to the strikes, which was marked heavily by the Red Scare, rhetoric accusing tenant leaders of being Bolsheviks and comments that claimed a fear that there would be a mass uprising were commonly invoked by political officials at the time. Repression by the government was also prevalent; two examples include the Palmer Raids and Lusk Committee raids. The period was also marked by anti-Semitic rhetoric.

In 1920, the five Socialist members of the New York state assembly were expelled from it by a vote of 140 to 6, partially in response to their support for the strikes.

By its end, the wave of strikes had led to the passage of the first rent laws in the country and fundamentally shifted tenant-landlord relations. However, the more radical tenant groups largely were destroyed by raids or slowly dwindled as a result of the new laws addressing the crisis.

====Steel strike of 1919====

Though the leadership of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) opposed a strike in the steel industry, 98% of their union members voted to strike beginning on September 22, 1919. It shut down half the steel industry, including almost all mills in Pueblo, Colorado; Chicago, Illinois; Wheeling, West Virginia; Johnstown, Pennsylvania; Cleveland, Ohio; Lackawanna, New York; and Youngstown, Ohio.

The owners quickly turned public opinion against the AFL. As the strike began, they published information exposing AFL National Committee co-chairman William Z. Foster&#x27;s radical past as a Wobbly and syndicalist, and claimed this was evidence that the steelworker strike was being masterminded by radicals and revolutionaries. The steel companies played on nativist fears by noting that a large number of steelworkers were immigrants. Public opinion quickly turned against the striking workers. State and local authorities backed the steel companies. They prohibited mass meetings, had their police attack pickets and jailed thousands. After strikebreakers and police clashed with unionists in Gary, Indiana, the U.S. Army took over the city on October 6, 1919, and martial law was declared. National Guardsmen, leaving Gary after federal troops had taken over, turned their anger on strikers in nearby Indiana Harbor, Indiana.

Steel companies also turned toward strikebreaking and rumor-mongering to demoralize the picketers. They brought in between 30,000 and 40,000 African-American and Mexican-American workers to work in the mills. Company spies also spread rumors that the strike had collapsed elsewhere, and they pointed to the operating steel mills as proof that the strike had been defeated.

Congress conducted its own investigation, focused on radical influence upon union activity. In that context, U.S. Senator Kenneth McKellar, a member of the Senate committee investigating the strike, proposed making one of the Philippine Islands a penal colony to which those convicted of an attempt to overthrow the government could be deported.

The Chicago mills gave in at the end of October. By the end of November, workers were back at their jobs in Gary, Johnstown, Youngstown, and Wheeling. The strike collapsed on January 8, 1920, though it dragged on in isolated areas like Pueblo and Lackawanna.

====Coal strike of 1919====

The United Mine Workers under John L. Lewis announced a strike for November 1, 1919. They had agreed to a wage agreement to run until the end of World War I and now sought to capture some of their industry&#x27;s wartime gains. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer invoked the Lever Act, a wartime measure that made it a crime to interfere with the production or transportation of necessities. The law, meant to punish hoarding and profiteering, had never been used against a union. Certain of united political backing and almost universal public support, Palmer obtained an injunction on October 31 and 400,000 coal workers went on strike the next day. He claimed the President authorized the action, following a meeting with the severely ill President in the presence of his doctor. Palmer also asserted that the entire Cabinet had backed his request for an injunction. That infuriated Secretary of Labor Wilson who had opposed Palmer&#x27;s plan and supported Gompers&#x27; view of the President&#x27;s promises when the Act was under consideration. The rift between the Attorney General and the Secretary of Labor was never healed, which had consequences the next year when Palmer&#x27;s attempts to deport radicals were frustrated by the Department of Labor.

Samuel Gompers, President of the American Federation of Labor, protested that President Wilson and members of his Cabinet had provided assurances when the Act was passed that it would not be used to prevent strikes by labor unions. He provided detailed accounts of his negotiations with representatives of the administration, especially Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson. He also argued that the end of hostilities, even in the absence of a signed treaty, should have invalidated any attempts to enforce the Act&#x27;s provisions. Nevertheless, he attempted to mediate between Palmer and Lewis, but after several days called the injunction &quot;so autocratic as to stagger the human mind&quot;. The coal operators smeared the strikers with charges that Lenin and Trotsky had ordered the strike and were financing it, and some of the press echoed that language. Others used words like &quot;insurrection&quot; and &quot;Bolshevik revolution&quot;. Eventually Lewis, facing criminal charges and sensitive to the propaganda campaign, withdrew his strike call, though many strikers ignored his action. As the strike dragged on into its third week, coal supplies were running low and public sentiment was calling for ever stronger government action. Final agreement came on December 10.

===Reactions===

====Palmer Raids====

Despite two attempts on his life in April and June 1919, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer moved slowly to find a way to attack the source of the violence. An initial raid in July 1919 against a small anarchist group in Buffalo failed when a federal judge tossed out his case. In August, he organized the General Intelligence Division within the Department of Justice and recruited J. Edgar Hoover, a recent law school graduate, to head it. Hoover pored over arrest records, subscription records of radical newspapers, and party membership records to compile lists of resident aliens for deportation proceedings. On October 17, 1919, just a year after the Immigration Act of 1918 had expanded the definition of aliens that could be deported, the U.S. Senate demanded Palmer explain his failure to move against radicals.

Palmer launched his campaign against radicalism with two sets of police actions known as the Palmer Raids in November 1919 and January 1920. Federal agents supported by local police rounded up large groups of suspected radicals, often based on membership in a political group rather than any action taken. Undercover informants and warrantless wiretaps (authorized under the Sedition Act) helped to identify several thousand suspected leftists and radicals to be arrested.

Only the dismissal of most of the cases by Acting United States Secretary of Labor Louis Freeland Post limited the number of deportations to 556. Fearful of extremist violence and revolution, the American public supported the raids. Civil libertarians, the radical left, and legal scholars raised protests. Officials at the Department of Labor, especially Post, asserted the rule of law in opposition to Palmer&#x27;s anti-radical campaign. Post faced a Congressional threat to impeach or censure him. He successfully defended his actions in two days of testimony before the House Rules Committee in June 1919 and no action was ever taken against him. Palmer testified before the same committee, also for two days, and stood by the raids, arrests, and deportation program. Much of the press applauded Post&#x27;s work at Labor, while Palmer, rather than President Wilson, was largely blamed for the negative aspects of the raids.

====Deportations====
On December 21, 1919, the &quot;Buford&quot;, a ship the press nicknamed the &quot;Soviet Ark&quot;, left New York harbor with 249 deportees. Of those, 199 had been detained in the November Palmer Raids, with 184 of them deported because of their membership in the Union of Russian Workers, an anarchist group that was a primary target of the November raids. Others on board, including the well-known radical leaders Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, had not been taken in the Palmer Raids. Goldman had been convicted in 1893 of &quot;inciting to riot&quot; and arrested on many other occasions. Berkman had served 14 years in prison for the attempted murder of industrialist Henry Clay Frick in 1892. Both were convicted in 1917 of interfering with military recruitment. Some of the 249 were leftists or anarchists or at least fell within the legal definition of anarchist because they &quot;believed that no government would be better for human society than any kind of government&quot;. In beliefs they ranged from violent revolutionaries to pacifist advocates of non-resistance. Others belonged to radical organizations but disclaimed knowledge of the organization&#x27;s political aims and had joined to take advantage of educational programs and social opportunities.

The U.S. War Department used the &quot;Buford&quot; as a transport ship in the Spanish–American War and in World War I and loaned it to the Department of Labor in 1919 for the deportation mission. A &quot;strong detachment of marines&quot; numbering 58 enlisted men and four officers made the journey and pistols were distributed to the crew. Its final destination was unknown as it sailed under sealed orders. Even the captain only learned his final destination while in Kiel harbor for repairs, since the State Department found it difficult to make arrangements to land in Latvia. Finland, though chosen, was not an obvious choice, since Finland and Russia were at war.

The notoriety of Goldman and Berkman as convicted anti-war agitators allowed the press and public to imagine that all the deportees had similar backgrounds. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called them all &quot;Russian Reds&quot;. Most of the press approved enthusiastically. The Cleveland &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; wrote: &quot;It is hoped and expected that other vessels, larger, more commodious, carrying similar cargoes, will follow in her wake.&quot; The &quot;New York Evening Mail&quot; said: &quot;Just as the sailing of the Ark that Noah built was a pledge for the preservation of the human race, so the sailing of the Ark of the Soviet is a pledge for the preservation of America.&quot; Goldman later wrote a book about her experiences after being deported to Russia, called &quot;My Disillusionment in Russia&quot;.

=====Concentration camps=====
As reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, some communists agreed to be deported while others were put into a concentration camp at Camp Upton in New York pending deportation hearings.

===Expulsion of Socialists from the New York Assembly===

On January 7, 1920, at the first session of the New York State Assembly, Assembly Speaker Thaddeus C. Sweet attacked the Assembly&#x27;s five Socialist members, declaring they had been &quot;elected on a platform that is absolutely inimical to the best interests of the state of New York and the United States&quot;. The Socialist Party, Sweet said, was &quot;not truly a political party&quot;, but was rather &quot;a membership organization admitting within its ranks aliens, enemy aliens, and minors&quot;. It had supported the revolutionaries in Germany, Austria, and Hungary, he continued, and consorted with international Socialist parties close to the Communist International. The Assembly suspended the five by a vote of 140 to 6, with just one Democrat supporting the Socialists.

A trial in the Assembly, lasting from January 20 to March 11, resulted in a recommendation that the five be expelled and the Assembly voted overwhelmingly for expulsion on April 1, 1920. The expulsion was partially in response to their support for and involvement in the wave of rent strikes occurring in NYC.

Opposition to the Assembly&#x27;s actions was widespread and crossed party lines. From the start of the process, former Republican Governor, Supreme Court Justice, and presidential candidate Charles Evans Hughes defended the Socialist members: &quot;Nothing ... is a more serious mistake at this critical time than to deprive Socialists or radicals of their opportunities for peaceful discussion and thus to convince them that the Reds are right and that violence and revolution are the only available means at their command.&quot; Democratic Governor Al Smith denounced the expulsions: &quot;To discard the method of representative government leads to the misdeeds of the very extremists we denounce and serves to increase the number of enemies of orderly free government.&quot; Hughes also led a group of leading New York attorneys in a protest that said: &quot;We have passed beyond the stage in political development when heresy-hunting is a permitted sport.&quot;

==Coverage==

===Newspaper coverage===
America&#x27;s newspapers continually reinforced their readers&#x27; pro-American views and presented a negative attitude toward the Soviet Union and communism. They presented a threat of imminent conflict with the Soviet Union that would be justified by the clash with American ideals and goals.

In addition, when &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported positively about the Soviet Union, it received less attention from the public than when it reported antagonistically about it. This did not hold true when Soviet interests agreed with American ones. As a result of this, the &quot;Times&quot; had a tendency to use exaggerated headlines, weighted words, and questionable sources in order to create a negative slant against the Soviets and communism. The tendency was to be very pro-American and theatrical in their coverage.

The Red Scare led to the Western popularization of &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;. The text was purportedly brought to the United States by a Russian army officer in 1917; it was translated into English by Natalie de Bogory (personal assistant of Harris A. Houghton, an officer of the Department of War) in June 1918, and White Russian expatriate Boris Brasol soon circulated it in American government circles, specifically diplomatic and military, in typescript form, It also appeared in 1919 in the &quot;Public Ledger&quot; as a pair of serialized newspaper articles. But all references to &quot;Jews&quot; were replaced with references to &quot;Bolsheviki&quot; as an exposé by the journalist – and subsequently highly respected Columbia University School of Journalism dean – Carl W. Ackerman. Shortly thereafter it was adapted as &quot;The International Jew&quot; series in &quot;The Dearborn Independent&quot;, establishing the myth of Jewish Bolshevism.

===Film===
America&#x27;s film industry reflected and exploited every aspect of the public&#x27;s fascination with and fear of Bolshevism. &quot;The German Curse in Russia&quot; dramatized the German instigation of Russia&#x27;s October Revolution. The Soviet nationalization of women was central to the plot of &quot;The New Moon&quot;, in which women between the ages of 23 and 32 are the property of the state and the heroine, Norma Talmadge, is a Russian princess posing as a peasant during the Russian Revolution. Similarly, in &quot;The World and Its Woman&quot; starring Geraldine Farrar, the daughter of an American engineer working in Russia becomes an opera star and has to fend off attempts to &quot;nationalize&quot; her.

Several films used labor troubles as their setting, with an idealistic American hero and heroine struggling to outwit manipulative left-wing agitators. &quot;Dangerous Hours&quot; tells the story of an attempted Russian infiltration of American industry. College graduate John King is sympathetic to the left in a general way. Then he is seduced, both romantically and politically, by Sophia Guerni, a female agitator. Her superior is the Bolshevik Boris Blotchi, who has a &quot;wild dream of planting the scarlet seed of terrorism in American soil&quot;. Sofia and Boris turn their attention to the Weston shipyards that are managed by John&#x27;s childhood sweetheart, May. The workers have valid grievances, but the Bolsheviks set out to manipulate the situation. They are &quot;the dangerous element following in the wake of labor as riffraff and ghouls follow an army&quot;. When they threaten May, John has an epiphany and renounces revolutionary doctrine.

A reviewer in &quot;Picture Play&quot; protested the film&#x27;s stew of radical beliefs and strategies: &quot;Please, oh please, look up the meaning of the words &#x27;bolshevik&#x27; and &#x27;soviet&#x27;. Neither of them mean &#x27;anarchist&#x27;, &#x27;scoundrel&#x27; or &#x27;murderer&#x27; – really they don&#x27;t!&quot;

Some films just used Bolsheviks for comic relief, where they are easily seduced (&quot;The Perfect Woman&quot;) or easily inebriated (&quot;Help Yourself&quot;). In &quot;Bullin the Bullsehviks&quot; an American named Lotta Nerve outwits Trotsky. New York State Senator Clayton R. Lusk spoke at the film&#x27;s New York premiere in October 1919. Other films used one feature or another of radical philosophy as the key plot point: anarchist violence (&quot;The Burning Question&quot;), assassination and devotion to the red flag (&quot;The Volcano&quot;), utopian vision (&quot;Bolshevism on Trial&quot;).

The advertising for &quot;Bolshevism on Trial&quot; called it &quot;the timeliest picture ever filmed&quot; and reviews were good. &quot;Powerful, well-knit with indubitably true and biting satire&quot;, said &quot;Photoplay&quot;. As a promotion device, the April 15, 1919, issue of &quot;Moving Picture World&quot; suggested staging a mock radical demonstration by hanging red flags around town and then have actors in military uniforms storm in to tear them down. The promoter was then to distribute handbills to the confused and curious crowds to reassure them that &quot;Bolshevism on Trial&quot; takes a stand against Bolshevism and &quot;you will not only clean up but will profit by future business&quot;. When this publicity technique came to the attention of U.S. Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson, he expressed his dismay to the press: &quot;This publication proposes by deceptive methods of advertising to stir every community in the United States into riotous demonstrations for the purpose of making profits for the moving picture business&quot;. He hoped to ban movies treating Bolshevism and Socialism.

==Legislation==

In 1919, Kansas enacted a law titled &quot;An act relating to the flag, standard or banner of Bolshevism, anarchy or radical socialism&quot; in an attempt to punish the display of the most common symbol of radicalism, the red flag. Only Massachusetts (1913) and Rhode Island (1914) passed such &quot;red flag laws&quot; earlier. By 1920 they were joined by 24 more states. Some banned certain colors (red or black), or certain expressions (&quot;indicating disloyalty or belief in anarchy&quot; or &quot;antagonistic to the existing government of the United States&quot;), or certain contexts (&quot;to overthrow the government by general strike&quot;), or insignia (&quot;flag or emblem or sign&quot;). The &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; mocked the Connecticut law against symbols &quot;calculated to  ... incite people to disorder&quot;, anticipating its enforcement at the next Harvard-Yale football game. Ohio exempted college pennants and Wisconsin made an exception for historical museums. Minnesota allowed red flags for railroad and highway warnings. Setting patriotic standards, red flag laws regulated the proper display of the American flag: above all other flags, ahead of all other banners in any parade, or flown only in association with state flags or the flags of friendly nations. Punishment generally included fines from $1,000 to $5,000 and prison terms of 5 to 10 years, occasionally more.

At the federal level, the Espionage Act of 1917 and the amendments to it in the Sedition Act of 1918 prohibited interference with the war effort, including many expressions of opinion. With that legislation rendered inoperative by the end of World War I, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer, supported by President Wilson, waged a public campaign in favor of a peacetime version of the Sedition Act without success. He sent a circular outlining his rationale to newspaper editors in January 1919, citing the dangerous foreign-language press and radical attempts to create unrest in African American communities. At one point Congress had more than 70 versions of proposed language and amendments for such a bill, but it took no action on the controversial proposal during the campaign year of 1920.

Palmer called for every state to enact its own version of the Sedition Act. Six states had laws of this sort before 1919 usually aimed at sabotage, but another 20 added them in 1919 and 1920. Usually called &quot;anti-syndicalist laws&quot;, they varied in their language, but generally made it a crime to &quot;destroy organized government&quot; by one method or another, including &quot;by the general cessation of industry&quot;, that is, through a general strike. Many cities had their own versions of these laws, including 20 in the state of Washington alone.

==Demise==

===May Day 1920===
Within Attorney General Palmer&#x27;s Justice Department, the General Intelligence Division (GID) headed by J. Edgar Hoover had become a storehouse of information about radicals in America. It had infiltrated many organizations and, following the raids of November 1919 and January 1920, it had interrogated thousands of those arrested and read through boxes of publications and records seized. Though agents in the GID knew there was a gap between what the radicals promised in their rhetoric and what they were capable of accomplishing, they nevertheless told Palmer they had evidence of plans for an attempted overthrow of the U.S. government on May Day 1920.

With Palmer&#x27;s backing, Hoover warned the nation to expect the worst: assassinations, bombings, and general strikes. Palmer issued his own warning on April 29, 1920, claiming to have a &quot;list of marked men&quot; and said domestic radicals were &quot;in direct connection and unison&quot; with European counterparts with disruptions planned for the same day there. Newspapers headlined his words: &quot;Terror Reign by Radicals, says Palmer&quot; and &quot;Nation-wide Uprising on Saturday&quot;. Localities prepared their police forces and some states mobilized their militias. New York City&#x27;s 11,000-man police force worked for 32 hours straight. Boston police mounted machine guns on automobiles and positioned them around the city.

The date came and went without incident. Newspaper reaction was almost uniform in its mockery of Palmer and his &quot;hallucinations&quot;. Clarence Darrow called it the &quot;May Day scare&quot;. The &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; asked the Attorney General to cease his alerts: &quot;We can never get to work if we keep jumping sideways in fear of the bewiskered Bolshevik.&quot; The &quot;Boston American&quot; assessed the Attorney General on May 4:

Palmer&#x27;s embarrassment buttressed Louis Freeland Post&#x27;s position in opposition to the Palmer raids when he testified before a Congressional Committee on May 7–8.

===Collapse===
Once Palmer&#x27;s warnings of a May Day attempt to overthrow the government proved false, the anti-Bolshevik hysteria wound down quickly. In testimony before Congress on May 7–8, Louis Freeland Post defended his release of hundreds seized in Palmer&#x27;s raids so successfully that attempts to impeach or censure him ended. Later in the month, a dozen prominent lawyers including Felix Frankfurter and Roscoe Pound endorsed a report that condemned Palmer&#x27;s Justice Department for the &quot;utterly illegal acts committed by those charged with the highest duty of enforcing the laws&quot; including entrapment, police brutality, prolonged incommunicado detention, and violations of due process in court.

In June, Massachusetts Federal District Court Judge George W. Anderson ordered the discharge of twenty more arrested aliens and effectively ended the possibility of additional raids. The conservative &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; found itself unable to support Palmer any longer, writing on June 25, 1920: &quot;What appeared to be an excess of radicalism ... was certainly met with ... an excess of suppression.&quot; Leaders of industry voiced similar sentiments, including Charles M. Schwab of Bethlehem Steel, who thought Palmer&#x27;s activities created more radicals than they suppressed, and T. Coleman du Pont who called the Justice Department&#x27;s work evidence of &quot;sheer Red hysteria&quot;.

At the Democratic National Convention in July, Palmer never had a chance at winning the nomination. Coolidge, famous for his opposition to the right of police to strike, won a place on the Republican ticket, but the party&#x27;s nominee and the eventual winner of the 1920 election was the U.S. Senator from Ohio, Warren G. Harding. He sounded a very different note in mid-August. An interviewer wrote that &quot;his jaws fairly snapped&quot; when he said that &quot;too much has been said about Bolshevism in America. It is quite true that there are enemies of Government within our borders. However, I believe their number has been greatly magnified. The American workman is not a Bolshevik; neither is the American employer an autocrat.&quot;

When another anarchist bomb exploded on Wall Street in September 1920, newspaper response was comparatively restrained. &quot;More bombs may be exploded&quot;, wrote the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;Other lives may be taken. But these are only hazards of a war which  ... must be faced calmly.&quot; If anarchists sought to make people fearful, &quot;By keeping cool and firm we begin their defeat.&quot;

Nevertheless, the after-effects of the First Red Scare were a major factor in the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924.

<text>The Ruahine Range is the largest of several mountain ranges in the North Island of New Zealand that form a ridge running parallel with the east coast of the island between East Cape and Wellington. The ridge is at its most pronounced from the central North Island down to Wellington, where it comprises the Ruahine, Tararua and Remutaka Ranges.

The Ruahines run northeast–southwest for 110 kilometres from inland Hawke&#x27;s Bay to near Woodville. It is separated in the south from the northern end of the Tararua Range by the Manawatū Gorge.

The highest point in the Ruahines is Mangaweka, situated along the Hikurangi Range, which at 1733 metres (5686 feet) is the second highest non-volcanic mountainous peak in the North Island after Mount Hikurangi (1754 metres/5755 feet) in the Raukumara Range.

The other notable peak is Wharite (920 metres/3017 feet), which visually marks the southern end-point of the Ruahine Range. The dominant geographical landmark in the Manawatū and Tararua District, Wharite is perhaps better known in the region for its highly-visible television transmission tower. The first transmitter at Wharite was commissioned in 1963, relaying Wellington&#x27;s WNTV1 channel (now part of TVNZ 1). The current main transmitter was commissioned in 1966.

==Name==
Ruahine is a Māori name believed to mean &quot;wise woman&quot;, with reference to the migrant leader&#x27;s granddaughter on the Aotea canoe. A local Māori says &quot;Kaua e whakakoria te kuku o Ruahine, kei wera!&quot; (Don&#x27;t disturb the forest of Ruahine, or it will burst into flames!), referring to the fact that attacking tribes often came down into Hawke&#x27;s Bay through the passes of the Ruahine Range.

<text>Calamus is a genus of flowering plants in the palm family Arecaceae that is one of several genera known as rattan palms. There are an estimated 400 species in this genus, all native to tropical and subtropical Asia, Africa, and Australia.

==Description==
They are dioecious, mostly leaf-climbing lianas with slender, reedy stems. To aid scrambling some species have evolved hooks on the underside of the midrib, or more commonly by modified &quot;pinnae&quot; or tendrils in the form of stout, backward-pointing spines. These stems may grow to lengths of 200 metres.

The fruits of certain species, in particular &quot;Calamus draco&quot;, produce a red resin known as &quot;Dragon&#x27;s blood&quot;.

<text>Belianís of Greece is the eponymous hero of a Spanish chivalric romance novel, &quot;The honour of chivalry&quot;, following in the footsteps of the influential Amadis de Gaula. An English abridgement of this novel was published in 1673.
It is best known today because it was one of the books spared during the expurgation of Don Quixote&#x27;s library in Chapter 6 of Part I of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

This book was known by the English man of letters Samuel Johnson; see Eithne Henson, &quot;“The Fictions of Romantick Chivalry”: Samuel Johnson and Romance&quot;, London and Toronto 1992, and John Hardy, &quot;Johnson and Don Bellianis [sic],&quot; &quot;Review of English Studies&quot;, new series, vol. 17 (1966), pp. 297–299. It is also mentioned by Edmund Burke in the general introduction to his work &quot;On Taste&quot; where it is contrasted with the Aeneid (referred to as the &quot;Eneid&quot;) as being a lower form of literature: The type of reader who &quot;is charmed with Don Bellianis... is not shocked with the continual breaches of probability, the confusion of times, the offences against manners, the trampling upon geography; for he knows nothing of geography and chronology, and he has never examined the grounds of probability.&quot;

<text>Quillaja saponaria, the soap bark tree or soapbark, is an evergreen tree in the family Quillajaceae, native to warm temperate central Chile. In Chile it occurs from 32 to 40° South Latitude approximately and at up to 2000 m (6500 ft) above sea level. It can grow to 15–20 m (50–65 ft) in height. The tree has thick, dark bark; smooth, leathery, shiny, oval evergreen leaves 3–5 cm long; white star-shaped flowers 15 mm diameter borne in dense corymbs; and a dry fruit with five follicles each containing 10–20 seeds. The tree has several practical and commercial uses.

==Habitat==

This tree occurs at elevations up to 2000 metres. The species is drought resistant, and tolerates about −12 °C (10 °F) in its natural habitat. Examples of specific occurrences are in central Chile in the forests of La Campana National Park and Cerro La Campana, in which locales it is associated with the Chilean wine palm, &quot;Jubaea chilensis&quot;. It is often used for reforestation on arid soils.

The plant has been introduced as an ornamental in California, and has been acclimatized in Spain but is rarely cultivated there.

==Etymology==
&quot;Quillaja&quot; is derived from the Chilean vernacular name for this species, &quot;culay&quot;.

&quot;Saponaria&quot; means &#x27;soap-like&#x27;.

==Uses==
The wood is used in cabinetry, and scents derived from the tree are used in perfumes and cosmetics. The inner bark of &quot;Quillaja saponaria&quot; can be reduced to powder and employed as a substitute for soap, since it forms a lather with water, owing to the presence of a glycoside saponin, sometimes distinguished as quillaia saponin. The same, or a closely similar substance, is found in soapwort (&quot;Saponaria officinalis&quot;), in senega root (&quot;Polygala senega&quot;) and in sarsaparilla; it appears to be chemically related to digitonin, which occurs in &quot;digitalis&quot;. 

===Uses of the saponins===
Soap bark tree has a long history of medicinal use with the Andean people who used it as a treatment for various chest problems. The saponin content of the bark helps to stimulate the production of a more watery mucus in the airways, thus facilitating the removal of phlegm through coughing. The bark is the source of quillaia, the extract of which is used as a food additive and as an ingredient in pharmaceuticals, pesticides, personal care products, fire-fighting foam, and applied as an agricultural spray adjuvant. It is used as an additive in photographic films and as a foaming agent for drinks. 

The saponins in Quillaja Extract are also used as the active ingredient in commercial pesticides to inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungi and nematodes in ornamental plants, food crops and turfgrass.

The saponins of this tree are also considered to have adjuvant properties for vaccine solutions. QS21 adjuvant is a saponin obtainable from &quot;Quillaja saponaria&quot; extract. The Novavax vaccine for COVID-19 uses this adjuvant, the zoster vaccine &quot;Shingrix&quot; also contains QS21 as well as the RSV vaccine &quot;Arexvy&quot;.

<text>Trivial objections (also referred to as hair-splitting, nothing but objections, barrage of objections and banal objections) is an informal logical fallacy where irrelevant and sometimes frivolous objections are made to divert the attention away from the topic that is being discussed. This type of argument is called a &quot;quibble&quot; or &quot;quillet&quot;. Trivial objections are a special case of red herring.

The fallacy often appears when an argument is difficult to oppose. The person making a trivial objection may appear ready to accept the argument in question, but at the same time they will oppose it in many different ways. These objections can appear in the form of lists, hypotheticals, and even accusations.

Such objections themselves may be valid, but they fail to confront the main argument under consideration. Instead, the objection opposes a small, irrelevant part of the main argument. The fallacy is committed because of this diversion; it is fallacious to oppose a point on the basis of minor and incidental aspects, rather than responding to the main claim.

These objections are often used to not address the merit of an argument but rather to oppose them from a technicality.

Example:
:&quot;Amy&quot; is using a barrage of objections:

:&quot;Tom&quot;: Tomatoes are fruit, not vegetable.
:&quot;Amy&quot;: Tomatoes can&#x27;t be fruit. They don&#x27;t grow on trees.
:&quot;Tom&quot;: But pineapples also don&#x27;t grow on trees and are fruit.
:&quot;Amy&quot;: Tomatoes still can&#x27;t be fruit. They are used in salads.
:&quot;Tom&quot;: Apples are also used in salads and are fruit.
:&quot;Amy&quot;: Tomatoes still can&#x27;t be fruit. They are of botanical order Solanales.

<text>Alexander George &quot;Killer&quot; Kaleta (November 29, 1919 – July 9, 1987) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Chicago Black Hawks and New York Rangers between 1941 and 1951 and is best known for his part in originating hockey&#x27;s hat trick tradition.

==Playing career==
After playing in the Alberta Senior Hockey League (ASHL), Kaleta joined the NHL with the Chicago Black Hawks in 1941–42. He recorded 28 points in 47 games as a rookie that season. During his tenure with the Black Hawks, he is credited with having begun the tradition of the hat trick during the 1945–46 season, when he entered a shop in Toronto looking for a new hat. Without enough money to buy one, he reached an agreement with shop owner Sammy Taft that if he scored three goals that night in a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs, he would earn a free hat. In fact, that night, on January 26, 1946, he scored four goals against the Leafs. While there are other accounts of the hat trick&#x27;s origin in hockey, Kaleta&#x27;s story is the one recognized by the Hockey Hall of Fame. Kaleta went on to complete the season that year with an NHL career-high 46 points.

After four seasons with the Black Hawks, Kaleta joined the New York Rangers in 1948–49. He recorded consecutive 31-point seasons in two seasons with the Rangers before ending his NHL career by joining the Saskatoon Quakers of the minor pro Pacific Coast Hockey League (PCHL) in 1951–52. The next season, the PCHL was absorbed by the Western Hockey League (WHL), where Kaleta played with the Quakers for three more seasons before retiring in 1954–55.

<doc id="1200292" wikidata="Q231552" url="?curid=1200292" title="Ayesha Gaddafi">
<text>Ayesha Gaddafi (; born December 25, 1977), also known as Aisha Gaddafi, is a Libyan former mediator and military official, former UN Goodwill Ambassador, and lawyer by profession. 

She is the fifth child and only biological daughter of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi from his second wife Safia Farkash. 

==Education==
Gaddafi was educated at the Paris Diderot University, and studied law at the University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne.

==Military service==
She trained with the Libyan military, reaching the rank of Lieutenant-colonel.

==Diplomacy==
In 2000, after sanctions were imposed on Iraq, she arrived in Baghdad with a delegation of 69 officials. Shortly before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, she met with Saddam Hussein.

In 2000, Ayesha gave a speech at Speakers&#x27; Corner in Hyde Park, London in support of the Provisional Irish Republican Army. When questioned about her support for the IRA in 2010, she stated &quot;I have always been a supporter of all liberation movements. Britain is Britain and Ireland is Ireland.&quot; She also supported the Iraqi insurgents, stating &quot;When you have an occupying army coming from abroad, raping your women and killing your own people, it is only legitimate that you fight them.&quot;

In 2011, she strongly denounced the policies of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. President Barack Obama, calling for a mediation of the Libyan Civil War through an international organization which would exclude them.

Ayesha has served as a mediator on behalf of the government with European Union corporations.

===UN Goodwill Ambassador===
Ayesha Gaddafi was appointed as the United Nations Development Program National Goodwill Ambassador for Libya on 24 July 2009, primarily to address the issues of HIV/AIDS, poverty and women&#x27;s rights in Libya, all of which are culturally sensitive topics in the country. 

In February 2011 the United Nations stripped Ayesha of her role as a Goodwill Ambassador.

==Legal affairs==
In July 2004, she joined the legal defense team of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

Gaddafi is also the head of the charity Wa Attassimou, which defended Muntadhar al-Zaidi when he faced charges stemming from the shoe-hurling incident.

==Libyan civil war==
===Travel ban===
She was placed under a travel ban under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970 from 26 February 2011 to 16 October 2023.

===Legal petitions===
Gaddafi sued NATO over the bombing of a building in her father&#x27;s compound which she alleged killed her brother, Saif al-Arab Gaddafi, and her own infant daughter. She claimed that the attack was illegal because it targeted civilian buildings. Gaddafi&#x27;s lawyers filed the petitions in Brussels and Paris in June 2011. However, on 27 July 2011, it was reported that Belgian prosecutors had declined to investigate the war crimes complaint filed by Gaddafi against NATO, stating that the courts of Belgium lacked jurisdiction to deal with the matter. 

On 3 June 2012, through her lawyer Nick Kaufman, Ayesha Gaddafi also petitioned the judges of the International Criminal Court requesting that they order the prosecutor - Fatou Bensouda to disclose what steps she had taken to investigate the murder of her father and brother Mutassim Gaddafi. This application was opposed by the prosecutor who stated that requiring her to disclose the requested information would intrude on prosecutorial independence and discretion and potentially impede the investigation itself.

===Battle of Tripoli===
As the Battle for Tripoli reached a climax in mid-August, the Gaddafi family were forced to abandon their fortified compound. On 22 August, Libyan rebels captured her house in the Battle of Tripoli. Among her possessions was a golden sofa shaped like a mermaid with the face of Ayesha, designed by an Egyptian artist.

===Flight to Algeria===
On 27 August 2011, it was reported by the Egyptian news agency Mena that Libyan rebel fighters had seen six armored Mercedes-Benz sedans, possibly carrying top Gaddafi regime figures, cross the border at the south-western Libyan town of Ghadames towards Algeria, which at the time was denied by the Algerian authorities. On 29 August, the Algerian government officially announced that Safia Farkash together with Ayesha and her brothers Muhammad and Hannibal (along with his wife Aline Skaf), had crossed into Algeria early on 29 August. An Algerian Foreign Ministry official said all the people in the convoy were now in Algiers, and that all of them had been named in warrants issued by the International Criminal Court for possible war crimes charges. Mourad Benmehidi, the Algerian permanent representative to the United Nations, later confirmed the details of the statement. The family had arrived at a Sahara desert entry point, in a Mercedes and a bus at 8:45 a.m. local time. The exact number of people in the party was unconfirmed, but there were “many children” and they did not include Colonel Gaddafi. The group was allowed in on humanitarian grounds, because Ayesha was pregnant and near her term. The Algerian government had since informed the head of the National Transitional Council. Libya&#x27;s rebels said sheltering Gaddafi family members was an act of aggression, and called for their extradition.

On 30 August 2011 it was announced that Ayesha had given birth to a girl in the city of Djanet. 

They were reportedly being confined by the Algerian government to a villa in Staoueli near Algiers, and were being cut off from outside communications. 

=== Life in exile ===

In October 2012 she, along with two of her brothers and other family members, left Algeria to go to Oman, where they were granted political asylum. She had been kicked out for repeatedly setting fire to her safe house in Algeria. Ennahar newspaper reported that &quot;she had blamed Algeria for her many problems.&quot; The last straw was when she burned a portrait of the country&#x27;s President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.

The EU amended their sanctions list in 2014, but did not include Ayesha, and rejected her requests to be removed from the list. She then sued on the basis that after the death of her father, there was now no reason for any bans. In May 2016, her mother and some of her family were allowed to return to Libya, still they were rejected and also went back to Oman as asylum seekers, but Ayesha Gaddafi remained in Oman. In January 2017, European Union&#x27;s General Court announced that her appeal had been successful, and that all sanctions and travel bans had been withdrawn. The court directed that EU governments pay court costs. As of March 2017, she reportedly was no longer in Oman and was living in Amman, Jordan. However, as of 2023, she was still reported to reside in the Sultanate of Oman.

In April 2021, the EU court ruled on removing Ayesha Gaddafi from the European blacklist. According to the court, she no longer represented a threat to peace and security in the region.

On 17 October 2024, the State Museum of Oriental Art in Moscow opened a six-week exhibit of dozens of Ayesha Gaddafi’s artworks, including a painting of a crowd hovering over the corpses of her father and her brother who was killed alongside him. The painting shows members of the crowd using smartphones to snap pictures of the bodies. Ayesha Gaddafi attended the exhibition of her artworks in Moscow, Russia.

==Personal life==
Ayesha was dubbed in the Arab press as the &quot;Claudia Schiffer of North Africa,&quot; because of her dyed hair. On 16 April 2006, she married Ahmed al-Gaddafi al-Qahsi, a grandson of her father&#x27;s uncle and an army colonel. Her husband was killed in the 26 July bombing of Gaddafi&#x27;s compound. They had three children prior to the fall of the regime, one of whom was killed along with one of her brothers in a NATO airstrike and another killed along with her husband in the bombing of Gaddafi&#x27;s compound. Algerian authorities confirmed that she gave birth to her fourth child in the hospital of Djanet, a baby girl, on 30 August 2011, who was named Safia-Djanet after her grandmother and the city she was born in, shortly after arriving there after fleeing Libya with other members of the Gaddafi family. Shortly after arriving in Algeria, they moved to Oman. 

While living in Oman, she has done two art exhibits there. On 18 October 2024, the State Museum of Oriental Art exhibited her artwork for six weeks in Moscow. The exhibition included a painting depicting a crowd taking photos of her dead father and brother with smartphones.

<doc id="1200293" wikidata="Q3275789" url="?curid=1200293" title="Sakuma Nobumori">
<text>was a Samurai retainer of Oda Nobuhide.
He was treated as Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s most important retainer and would come to fight in every important battle under Nobunaga&#x27;s command such as the 1567 Siege of Inabayama Castle, the 1571 and 1573 Siege of Nagashima.

==Early life==
Nobumori was head of the &quot;Sakuma clan&quot;. He was born in what is now Minami-ku, Nagoya (situated in contemporary Aichi District, Owari Province) and served under Oda Nobuhide. Sakuma was entrusted with the care of the young Oda Nobunaga, although he briefly supported Oda Nobuyuki in his failed attempt at rebellion in 1557.

Sakuma was called Noki Sakuma (退き佐久間) or &quot;Shirizoki Sakuma&quot;, which literally means &quot;retreating Sakuma&quot;, for his excellence in directing the rear guard.

==Military life==
In 1554, Nobumori took part in the Battle of Kiyosu Castle against Oda Nobutomo, uncle of Nobunaga.

In 1555, Nobumori took part in the Battle of Ino against Oda Nobuyuki, younger brother of Nobunaga.

In 1560, he led one of Nobunaga main forces at the Battle of Okehazama against Imagawa Yoshimoto.

In 1567, he fought in the Siege of Inabayama Castle against Saito Tatsuoki from the Saitō clan where he was in the reserve division.

In 1570, he was successful in attacking Mitsukuri castle in the campaign against the Rokkaku clan and helped to suppress rebellions caused by Buddhist sects in Echizen Province.

In 1571, Nobumori fought against the Ikkō-ikki rebellion in the Sieges of Nagashima. He also set fire and burnt down Enryakuji at the Siege of Mount Hiei. Nobumori was given Kurita County, Omi Province as chigyo-chi (household territory) in November, 1571.

In 1572, he and Takigawa Kazumasu led a 3,000-man unit as part of the reinforcements dispatched by Nobunaga to aid Tokugawa Ieyasu&#x27;s approximately 8,000 soldiers against the 30,000 led by Takeda Shingen in the Battle of Mikatagahara. Sakuma retreated after a preliminary engagement. His fellow commander Hirate Hirohide, however, who fought alongside the Tokugawa troops, lost his life, and the conflict ended with a crushing defeat of the Tokugawa-Oda alliance.

In 1573, he participated in the Siege of Ichijōdani Castle against the Asakura clan and the second Siege of Nagashima.

In 1574, he participated in the third Siege of Nagashima.

In 1575, he participated in the Battle of Nagashino against the Takeda clan.

In 1576, after Harada Naomasa&#x27;s death during the campaign against the heavily fortified and well-supplied Honganji temple in Osaka, Sakuma was chosen as Harada&#x27;s replacement as commander of the Siege of Ishiyama Hongan-ji and given troops from seven provinces placing him in command of the largest Oda-clan army among the Oda retainers. However, unlike his colleagues Akechi Mitsuhide, Shibata Katsuie or Hashiba Hideyoshi who all won battles on the fronts to which they were assigned, Nobumori made no progress against the Buddhist zealots.

In 1580, after ten years of warring in the Ishiyama Hongan-ji War, Nobunaga had the emperor mediate a truce to end the war. 
That same year, Nobunaga drafted a document containing a nineteen-point accusation against Sakuma, including past failures against the Honganji. Nobunaga banished Sakuma and his son Sakuma Nobuhide to the temple on Mount Koyasan, where they were forced to spend their days in the monk lifestyle. 
The man who came to lead the largest force in the Kinki area (Kansai) after Nobumori&#x27;s banishment was Akechi Mitsuhide, and along with the severe human affairs which brought unrest to the vassals, this banishment was often said to be linked to Nobunaga&#x27;s death at the Honnoji Incident.

==Death==
Nobumori&#x27;s banishment has widely been regarded as representative of Nobunaga&#x27;s cold-blooded treatment against even his longest-serving retainers underscoring the clan leader&#x27;s shortcomings as a military commander.

Nobumori, however, had reportedly held frequent tea parties and seemed more interested in these rather than focusing on military affairs. He never devised any overarching military measures against the Honganji, even though their war had remained in a stalemate. It has also been recorded that since childhood, Nobumori had been openly critical of Nobunaga. Sakuma died in 1582 at Totsugawa in Yamato Province. He was posthumously named Doumu Keigan (洞無桂巌) and Souyu (宗佑).

<doc id="1200324" wikidata="Q1129355" url="?curid=1200324" title="Convective available potential energy">
<text>In meteorology, convective available potential energy (commonly abbreviated as CAPE), is a measure of the capacity of the atmosphere to support upward air movement that can lead to cloud formation and storms. Some atmospheric conditions, such as very warm, moist, air in an atmosphere that cools rapidly with height, can promote strong and sustained upward air movement, possibly stimulating the formation of cumulus clouds or cumulonimbus (thunderstorm clouds). In that situation the potential energy of the atmosphere to cause upward air movement is very high, so CAPE (a measure of potential energy) would be high and positive. By contrast, other conditions, such as a less warm air parcel or a parcel in an atmosphere with a temperature inversion (in which the temperature increases above a certain height) have much less capacity to support vigorous upward air movement, thus the potential energy level (CAPE) would be much lower, as would the probability of thunderstorms.

More technically, CAPE is the integrated amount of work that the upward (positive) buoyancy force would perform on a given mass of air (called an air parcel) if it rose vertically through the entire atmosphere. Positive CAPE will cause the air parcel to rise, while negative CAPE will cause the air parcel to sink. 
Nonzero CAPE is an indicator of atmospheric instability in any given atmospheric sounding, a necessary condition for the development of cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds with attendant severe weather hazards.

== Mechanics ==

CAPE exists within the conditionally unstable layer of the troposphere, the free convective layer (FCL), where an ascending air parcel is warmer than the ambient air. CAPE is measured in joules per kilogram of air (J/kg). Any value greater than 0 J/kg indicates instability and an increasing possibility of thunderstorms and hail. Generic CAPE is calculated by integrating vertically the local buoyancy of a parcel from the level of free convection (LFC) to the equilibrium level (EL):
formula_1

Where formula_2 is the height of the level of free convection and formula_3 is the height of the equilibrium level (neutral buoyancy), where formula_4 is the virtual temperature of the specific parcel, where formula_5 is the virtual temperature of the environment (note that temperatures must be in the Kelvin scale), and where formula_6 is the acceleration due to gravity. This integral is the work done by the buoyant force minus the work done against gravity, hence it&#x27;s the excess energy that can become kinetic energy.

CAPE for a given region is most often calculated from a thermodynamic or sounding diagram (e.g., a Skew-T log-P diagram) using air temperature and dew point data usually measured by a weather balloon.

CAPE is effectively positive buoyancy, expressed &quot;B+&quot; or simply &quot;B&quot;; the opposite of convective inhibition (CIN), which is expressed as &quot;B-&quot;, and can be thought of as &quot;negative CAPE&quot;. As with CIN, CAPE is usually expressed in J/kg but may also be expressed as m2/s2, as the values are equivalent. In fact, CAPE is sometimes referred to as &quot;positive buoyant energy&quot; (&quot;PBE&quot;). This type of CAPE is the maximum energy available to an ascending parcel and to moist convection. When a layer of CIN is present, the layer must be eroded by surface heating or mechanical lifting, so that convective boundary layer parcels may reach their level of free convection (LFC).

On a sounding diagram, CAPE is the &quot;positive area&quot; above the LFC, the area between the parcel&#x27;s virtual temperature line and the environmental virtual temperature line where the ascending parcel is warmer than the environment. Neglecting the virtual temperature correction may result in substantial relative errors in the calculated value of CAPE for small CAPE values. CAPE may also exist below the LFC, but if a layer of CIN (subsidence) is present, it is unavailable to deep, moist convection until CIN is exhausted. When there is mechanical lift to saturation, cloud base begins at the lifted condensation level (LCL); absent forcing, cloud base begins at the convective condensation level (CCL) where heating from below causes spontaneous buoyant lifting to the point of condensation when the convective temperature is reached. When CIN is absent or is overcome, saturated parcels at the LCL or CCL, which had been small cumulus clouds, will rise to the LFC, and then spontaneously rise until hitting the stable layer of the equilibrium level. The result is deep, moist convection (DMC), or simply, a thunderstorm.

When a parcel is unstable, it will continue to move vertically, in either direction, dependent on whether it receives upward or downward forcing, until it reaches a stable layer (though momentum, gravity, and other forcing may cause the parcel to continue). There are multiple types of CAPE, &quot;downdraft CAPE&quot; (&quot;DCAPE&quot;), estimates the potential strength of rain and evaporatively cooled downdrafts. Other types of CAPE may depend on the depth being considered. Other examples are &quot;surface based CAPE&quot; (&quot;SBCAPE&quot;), &quot;mixed layer&quot; or &quot;mean layer CAPE&quot; (&quot;MLCAPE&quot;), &quot;most unstable&quot; or &quot;maximum usable CAPE&quot; (&quot;MUCAPE&quot;), and &quot;normalized CAPE&quot; (&quot;NCAPE&quot;).

Fluid elements displaced upwards or downwards in such an atmosphere expand or compress adiabatically in order to remain in pressure equilibrium with their surroundings, and in this manner become less or more dense.

If the adiabatic decrease or increase in density is &quot;less&quot; than the decrease or increase in the density of the ambient (not moved) medium, then the displaced fluid element will be subject to downwards or upwards pressure, which will function to restore it to its original position. Hence, there will be a counteracting force to the initial displacement. Such a condition is referred to as &quot;convective stability&quot;.

On the other hand, if adiabatic decrease or increase in density is &quot;greater&quot; than in the ambient fluid, the upwards or downwards displacement will be met with an additional force in the same direction exerted by the ambient fluid. In these circumstances, small deviations from the initial state will become amplified. This condition is referred to as &quot;convective instability&quot;.

Convective instability is also termed &quot;static instability&quot;, because the instability does not depend on the existing motion of the air; this contrasts with dynamic instability where instability is dependent on the motion of air and its associated effects such as dynamic lifting.

== Significance to thunderstorms ==
Thunderstorms form when air parcels are lifted vertically. Deep, moist convection requires a parcel to be lifted to the LFC where it then rises spontaneously until reaching a layer of non-positive buoyancy. The atmosphere is warm at the surface and lower levels of the troposphere where there is mixing (the planetary boundary layer (PBL)), but becomes substantially cooler with height. The temperature profile of the atmosphere, the change in temperature, the degree that it cools with height, is the lapse rate. When the rising air parcel cools more slowly than the surrounding atmosphere, it remains warmer and less dense. The parcel continues to rise freely (convectively; without mechanical lift) through the atmosphere until it reaches an area of air less dense (warmer) than itself.

The amount, and shape, of the positive-buoyancy area modulates the speed of updrafts, thus extreme CAPE can result in explosive thunderstorm development; such rapid development usually occurs when CAPE stored by a capping inversion is released when the &quot;lid&quot; is broken by heating or mechanical lift. The amount of CAPE also modulates how low-level vorticity is entrained and then stretched in the updraft, with importance to tornadogenesis. The most important CAPE for tornadoes is within the lowest 1 to 3 km (0.6 to 1.9 mi) of the atmosphere, whilst deep layer CAPE and the width of CAPE at mid-levels is important for supercells. Tornado outbreaks tend to occur within high CAPE environments. Large CAPE is required for the production of very large hail, owing to updraft strength, although a rotating updraft may be stronger with less CAPE. Large CAPE also promotes lightning activity.

Two notable days for severe weather exhibited CAPE values over 5 kJ/kg. Two hours before the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak occurred on May 3, 1999, the CAPE value sounding at Oklahoma City was at 5.89 kJ/kg. A few hours later, an F5 tornado ripped through the southern suburbs of the city. Also on May 4, 2007, CAPE values of 5.5 kJ/kg were reached and an EF5 tornado tore through Greensburg, Kansas. On these days, it was apparent that conditions were ripe for tornadoes and CAPE wasn&#x27;t a crucial factor. However, extreme CAPE, by modulating the updraft (and downdraft), can allow for exceptional events, such as the deadly F5 tornadoes that hit Plainfield, Illinois on August 28, 1990, and Jarrell, Texas on May 27, 1997, on days which weren&#x27;t readily apparent as conducive to large tornadoes. CAPE was estimated to exceed 8 kJ/kg in the environment of the Plainfield storm and was around 7 kJ/kg for the Jarrell storm.

Severe weather and tornadoes can develop in an area of low CAPE values. The surprise severe weather event that occurred in Illinois and Indiana on April 20, 2004, is a good example. Importantly in that case, was that although overall CAPE was weak, there was strong CAPE in the lowest levels of the troposphere which enabled an outbreak of minisupercells producing large, long-track, intense tornadoes.

== Example from meteorology ==
A good example of convective instability can be found in our own atmosphere. If dry mid-level air is drawn over very warm, moist air in the lower troposphere, a hydrolapse (an area of rapidly decreasing dew point temperatures with height) results in the region where the moist boundary layer and mid-level air meet. As daytime heating increases mixing within the moist boundary layer, some of the moist air will begin to interact with the dry mid-level air above it. Owing to thermodynamic processes, as the dry mid-level air is slowly saturated its temperature begins to drop, increasing the adiabatic lapse rate. Under certain conditions, the lapse rate can increase significantly in a short amount of time, resulting in convection. High convective instability can lead to severe thunderstorms and tornadoes as moist air which is trapped in the boundary layer eventually becomes highly negatively buoyant relative to the adiabatic lapse rate and escapes as a rapidly rising bubble of humid air triggering the development of a cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud.

== Limitations ==
As with most parameters used in meteorology, there are some caveats to keep in mind, one of which is what CAPE represents physically and in what instances CAPE can be used. One example where the more common method for determining CAPE might start to break down is in the presence of tropical cyclones (TCs), such as tropical depressions, tropical storms, or hurricanes.

The more common method of determining CAPE can break down near tropical cyclones because CAPE assumes that liquid water is lost instantaneously during condensation. This process is thus irreversible upon adiabatic descent. This process is not realistic for tropical cyclones. To make the process more realistic for tropical cyclones is to use Reversible CAPE (RCAPE for short). RCAPE assumes the opposite extreme to the standard convention of CAPE and is that no liquid water will be lost during the process. This new process gives parcels a greater density related to water loading.

RCAPE is calculated using the same formula as CAPE, the difference in the formula being in the virtual temperature. In this new formulation, we replace the parcel saturation mixing ratio (which leads to the condensation and vanishing of liquid water) with the parcel water content. This slight change can drastically change the values we get through the integration.

RCAPE does have some limitations, one of which is that RCAPE assumes no evaporation keeping consistent for the use within a TC but should be used sparingly elsewhere.

Another limitation of both CAPE and RCAPE is that currently, both systems do not consider entrainment.

<text>Ben Mayer (1925 in Germany – 28 December 1999) was an amateur astronomer perhaps best known for the invention of the projection blink comparator (PROBLICOM), a low-cost version of the blink comparator. This inexpensive tool allowed amateur astronomers to contribute to some phases of serious research. Professionally, Mayer worked as an interior designer.

Mayer was the first ever to photograph a nova in its brightening phase. On the night of August 29, 1975, Mayer was using an automatic camera to photograph the sky, hoping to track meteors large enough to survive entry into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. After learning of the nova, he realized it was in the part of the sky he was photographing. He retrieved his negatives from the trash (there were no meteors on the photographs) and found a series of images of Nova Cygni 1975 in several stages of brightening.

Mayer was a member of the American Association of Variable Star Observers and a frequent lecturer at the Riverside Telescope Makers Conference. In 1982 he won the Amateur Achievement Award of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. Perhaps the best words summarizing Mayer&#x27;s contributions and style appeared in The Griffith Observer memorial as written by Ed Krupp, Director of the Griffith Observatory in the June, 2000 edition (Vol 64, No. 6).

== Death ==
Mayer died on December 28, 1999 at the age of 74.

<text>The Remutaka Range (spelled Rimutaka Range before 2017) is the southernmost range of a mountain chain in the lower North Island of New Zealand. The chain continues north into the Tararua, then Ruahine Ranges, running parallel with the east coast between Wellington and East Cape.

The 555-metre summit of the road over the range at its northern saddle is named Remutaka Pass. The pass was formally named on 17 December 2015 when the Minister of Land Information confirmed the decision of the New Zealand Geographic Board. Following the passage of the Rangitāne Tū Mai Rā (Wairarapa Tamaki nui-ā-Rua) Claims Settlement Act 2017, the name of the range officially changed to Remutaka Range.

==Geography==

The Remutaka Range runs north-east to south-west for 55 kilometres from the upper reaches of the Hutt Valley (where the range&#x27;s northern saddle abuts the southern end of the Tararuas) to Turakirae Head at the western end of Palliser Bay. The highest peak is Mount Matthews, at 940 metres, near the southern end of the range.

Narrow and winding, State Highway 2 crosses the range from the Hutt Valley to Featherston at the saddle where it meets the Tararuas. At the road&#x27;s summit is a lookout point where there were usually tea rooms and well-guarded facilities maintained by residents. More recently there was a café. After disputes over toilets and land ownership between the then still new Greater Wellington Regional Council and a series of tenants the building sat empty, was severely damaged by fire in April 2009 and later demolished.

Taking a quite separate route the Wairarapa Line railway used to climb across the Remutakas, including the famous Rimutaka Incline, a rare example of the Fell mountain railway system. It opened on 12 August 1878 and closed on 30 October 1955, when it was replaced by the Rimutaka Tunnel. The former route is now the popular Remutaka Rail Trail and part of the Remutaka Cycle Trail.
The Rimutaka Incline Railway Heritage Trust has plans to rebuild the railway from Maymorn, including the Incline, as a tourist and historical attraction.

== History ==
During World War I over 30,000 New Zealand soldiers marched between military camps at Trentham, Upper Hutt and Featherston via the Rimutaka Hill Road, in a three-day trek of 27 miles (43.5 km). There were 23 marches of 500 to 1800 men between September 1915 and April 1918, at the end of their training as reinforcements for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. The march was re-enacted in 2015.

==Conservation==
Much of the range is protected as the Remutaka Forest Park and Wainuiomata Water Collection Area.

<doc id="1200336" wikidata="Q497196" url="?curid=1200336" title="Tararua Range">
<text>The Tararua Range, often referred to as the Tararua Ranges or Tararua, is one of several mountain ranges in the North Island of New Zealand.

The Tararua Range runs northeast–southwest for from near Palmerston North to the upper reaches of the Hutt Valley, where the northern tip of the Remutaka Range begins. It is separated in the north from the southern end of the Ruahine Range by the Manawatū Gorge. Most of the Range is wilderness, protected as the Tararua Forest Park.

The highest peak in the Tararua Range is Pukeamoamo / Mitre (not to be confused with Mitre Peak) at . Other prominent peaks include Mount Bannister at and Mount Hector at , which is named after the scientist Sir James Hector. Its Māori name is Pukemoumou, or &#x27;hill of desolation&#x27;.

==Geography==
The Tararua Range is divided into two distinct northern and southern regions. Each of these is dominated by a central mountain peak: Arete in the north and Hector in the south. A total of ten rivers rise on the mountain slopes, providing water for the surrounding rural and urban areas from Palmerston North to Wellington. A number of ranges radiate out from the mountains, the largest of which is the Main Range linking the twin clusters of northern and southern peaks. The summits of the ranges average between 1,300 and 1,500 metres in height. This consistency indicates that the region was once part of a level plain. About 10 million years ago parts of this relatively low-lying area were thrust up, creating a mountainous backbone for the southern part of the North Island. Subsequent erosion contributed to the present pattern of parallel ranges divided by deep river valleys. The ranges provide a back-drop for the Kāpiti coastal plain.

=== Mountain peaks===
The 15 peaks in the Tararua Range of 1,500 m or higher are (from north to south):
Other notable peaks in the range are Jumbo Peak (1,405 m) and Mount Holdsworth (1,470 m).

==Climate and vegetation==
The western slopes of the ranges are subject to prevailing moisture-carrying winds, channelled by Cook Strait to the south. These are the source of an annual rainfall of approximately 5,000 mm, resulting in the dominance of conifers, ferns and shrubs on the western side of the ranges. By contrast, the pattern on the eastern side is one of open beech forest in a drier environment.
In spite of a reputation of being composed of gloomy bush, impenetrable leatherwood, and wet snow tussocks on mist-shrouded tops, the Tararua Range has a wide diversity of vegetation, ranging from alpine tussock grasslands and subalpine shrublands to forests of montane miro/kāmahi, or beech or lowland broadleaf forests with emergent podocarps and kāmahi.

The forest in the northern part of the Tararua Range consists mainly of tawa and miro indigenous woodlands. Further south species such as beech are widely seen. Finally, along the west slopes of the ranges facing the Tasman Sea, mixed native species such as rimu, tarrier, mataī, tōtara and kahikatea are dominant.

==History==
The rugged terrain and frequently harsh weather of the Tararua Range served to discourage any substantial attempt at penetration by early Māori. Although there is archaeological evidence of exploration by moa hunters as early as the twelfth century, the mountains remained a massive physical divide between the tribal settlements located along rivers, lakes and coastlines to the east and west. Some of the Kāti Māmoe (early Māori settlers on the neighbouring Kāpiti Coast) are reputed to have taken refuge in the Tararua mountains after they were displaced by the Rangitāne and Muaūpoko iwi (tribal groups). The Kāti Māmoe survivors attained a mythical status as the patupaiarehe (fairy folk) of the Tarurua Range. In the 1820s the Muaūpoko in turn were forced to flee to the ranges when under attack by the Ngāti Toa led by Te Rauparaha. In spite of such intrusions, the mountain range remained the home of distant gods or hostile wild men (maero). As such, it was a special place to be respected but avoided.

In the 1870s a large portion of the ranges was sold to the New Zealand Government by a coalition of the Iwi in possession of the surrounding region. Specifically excluded from this &quot;Tararua Block&quot; purchase was an area of 1,000 acres reserved to protect the sacred lake Hapuakorari, the exact location of which remained uncertain. European settlers, like their Māori counterparts, found the steep ridges and deep valleys of the Tararua Range difficult of access and intimidating in scale. The range accordingly escaped the development of the fertile plains that bordered on it. In 1881 36,000 acres of the Tararua Block, including key catchment areas for four rivers, was classified as State Forest, subject to protection. Additional watersheds were added over the following decades, to create a Crown conservation reserve in excess of 250,000 acres. The scenic beauty of the Tararua Range made the mountains a popular subject for paintings during the Victorian period – though largely romanticized and usually undertaken from a distance. By the 1920s, with the neighbouring countryside largely settled, the potential of the range as an area for outdoor recreation rather than for exploitation began to be recognised.

==Tararua Forest Park==

The 116,535 hectare Tararua Forest Park covers more than three-quarters of the Tararua Range. It is administered by the New Zealand Department of Conservation and extends from the Pahiatua Track in the north, to the Rimutaka Saddle in the south. The main entrance on the eastern side of the ranges is at Holdsworth, and on the west side from Ōtaki Forks.

==Roads==
The only all-weather road right across the range is the Pahiatua Track, which joins Palmerston North and Pahiatua. It is now used more heavily since the Manawatū Gorge road was permanently closed in 2017 due to recurring large landslides.

==Recreation==
The Tararua Range serves as a popular tramping location for the greater Wellington district. It is one of the most frequently entered ranges in the country, with between 120,000 and 150,000 people visiting each year. Among the many tramping tracks is the well-known Southern Crossing running from Ōtaki Forks in the west, over Mount Hector and exiting via Kaitoke.

===Camping===

The hills include 6 campsites. They are accessible by car, although visitors may need to travel over gravel roads that contain occasional fords. Campsites are generally located within the foothills of the range, alongside a river or stream.

===Tramping===

The Tararua Range is significant in the history of tramping in New Zealand, due to its accessibility for people in Wellington and nearby towns. Two of the most popular tracks are the Northern Crossing from Levin to the Wairarapa, and the Southern Crossing from Ōtaki Forks to near Masterton.

===The Sutch Search===
In April 1933, the Tararua Range was the focus of what later came to be known as &quot;The Sutch Search&quot; when Mr. Eric Hill, Miss Morva Williams, Mr. Bert O’Keefe and Dr. Bill Sutch went missing for more than two weeks during an attempt to traverse from Te Matawai Hut to Mount Holdsworth during winter. An accident while sidling the Broken Axe Pinnacles prevented the group getting to Mt Holdsworth in a day as planned. Then bad weather forced them off the ridge tops. It took more than two weeks for them to find a route down the untracked Waiohine River. The group was noticed to be missing after a week, at which time a search developed that eventually involved roughly 200 people and solicited many donations from members of the public. The search was the first in New Zealand to involve radio communications and aircraft, and is generally considered to be one of the major contributing events towards the formation of New Zealand&#x27;s voluntary Land Search and Rescue service (LSAR). It was covered intensely by media at the time, and when the group finally returned they sparked strong public debate regarding the responsibilities of those who enter the wilderness.

===Tramping fatalities===
A combination of steep terrain, dense bush, difficult river crossings and changeable winter weather conditions has caused over twenty-two tramping deaths in the Tararua Range since 1970, most recently one in January 2023.

Other deaths included those of the Chief Executive of the National Museum of New Zealand Te Papa: Dr Seddon Bennington and a friend Marcella Jackson, who died of hypothermia in June 2009.

===Mountain running racing===
The Tararua Mountain Race, following a track of , from Kaitoke to Ōtaki Forks, has been held annually since 1990. The running race involves a total ascent of plus a slightly longer descent, and requires the deployment of 50 volunteers as marshals, search and rescue teams, first aid helpers, and support staff. It frequently encounters adverse weather and is not regarded as a suitable event for inexperienced participants.

<text>Fitch Ratings Inc. is an American credit rating agency. It is one of the three nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSRO) designated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and is considered as being one of the &quot;Big Three credit rating agencies&quot;, along with Moody&#x27;s and Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s.

== History ==
Fitch Ratings is dual headquartered in New York and London. Hearst owns 100 percent of the company following its acquisition of an additional 20 percent for $2.8 billion on April 12, 2018. Hearst had owned 80 percent of the company after increasing its ownership stake by 30 percent on December 12, 2014, in a transaction valued at $1.965 billion. Hearst&#x27;s previous equity interest was 80 percent following expansions on an original acquisition of 20 percent interest in 2006.

Hearst had jointly owned Fitch with FIMALAC SA, which held 20 percent of the company until the 2018 transaction. Fitch Ratings and Fitch Solutions are part of the Fitch Group.

The firm was founded by John Knowles Fitch on December 24, 1914, in New York City as the Fitch Publishing Company. In 1989, the company was acquired by a group including Robert Van Kampen. In 1997, Fitch was acquired by FIMALAC and was merged with London-based IBCA Limited, a FIMALAC subsidiary. In 2000, Fitch acquired both Chicago-based Duff &amp; Phelps Credit Rating Co. (April) and Thomson Financial BankWatch (December).

Fitch Ratings is the third largest NRSRO rating agency, covering a more limited share of the market than S&amp;P and Moody&#x27;s, though it has grown with acquisitions and frequently positions itself as a &quot;tie-breaker&quot; when the other two agencies have ratings similar, but not equal, in scale.

In September 2011, Fitch Group announced the sale of Algorithmics (risk analytics software) to IBM for $387 million.

In June 2022, Fitch Group acquired GeoQuant, an AI-driven data and technology company.

==Operations==
Fitch Ratings is a subsidiary of Fitch Group, a holding company wholly owned by Hearst Communications. Fitch Group also operates Fitch Solutions, a distribution channel for Fitch Ratings products and a provider of credit market data and financial analytics. Fitch Group employs approximately 5,000 people, including over 1,600 analysts. Paul Taylor is president and chief executive officer of Fitch Group. Fitch Ratings is registered as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO). The firm has more than 2,400 employees. Ian Linnell is president of Fitch Ratings.

==Criticism==

The main credit rating agencies, including Fitch, were accused of misrepresenting the risks associated with mortgage-related securities, which included the collateralized debt obligation (CDO) market. There were large losses in the CDO market that occurred despite being assigned top ratings by the CRAs.

For instance, losses on $340.7 million worth of collateralized debt obligations (CDO) issued by Credit Suisse Group added up to about $125 million, despite being rated AAA by Fitch.
However, differently from the other agencies, Fitch was warning the market on the constant proportion debt obligations (CPDO) with an early and pre-crisis report highlighting the dangers of CPDOs in 2007.

==Career==

As marquis de La Force, he served Henri IV, whose confidence he enjoyed. He was governor of Béarn from 1593 to 1621 and then viceroy of Navarre. After the assassination of Henry IV in 1610, he fought with the Huguenots against Louis XIII. He plotted with Henri de Rohan and participated in the successful defence of Montauban in 1621, after an 86-day siege by the king, although he was reconciled with Louis XIII the following year. La Force was made a marshal of France on 27 May 1622, to be employed as the Lieutenant-General of the Army of Piedmont. He campaigned in Piedmont in 1630, taking Pinerolo as well as Saluzzo and defeated the Spaniards at Carignano.

In 1631, he served in the Languedoc and between 1631 and 1634 he invaded Lorraine, and took La Mothe after a siege of 141 days in which Turenne first distinguished himself and La Force&#x27;s grandson Jacques was killed. In Germany, in 1634, he also raised the siege of Philippsburg in Baden and captured the general Colloredo. In the following year, he relieved Heidelberg and took Speyer.

He was created Duc de La Force and a peer on 3 August 1637.

In 1638 he besieged Saint-Omer in Flanders, but was defeated by Louis Thomas of Savoy-Carignan. It was his last battle.

La Force died in Bergerac on 10 May 1652 and was buried in Milandes. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Armand-Nompar. His memoirs were published in 1843.

<text>The Honda Pilot is a mid-size crossover SUV with three-row seating manufactured by Honda since 2002. Primarily aimed at the North American market, the Pilot is the largest SUV produced by Honda. Pilots are currently manufactured in Lincoln, Alabama, and the Pilot was produced in Alliston, Ontario until April 2007. The first generation Pilot was released in April 2002 as a 2003 model.

The Pilot shares its platform with the Acura MDX, as well as the North American market Odyssey minivan. The Pilot&#x27;s unibody construction and independent suspension are designed to provide handling similar to that of a car, and it has integrated perimeter frame rails to permit towing and light off-road use.

Prior to the introduction of the Pilot, Honda marketed the compact crossover CR-V and the Honda Passport (a rebadged Isuzu Rodeo). The Honda Passport that was sold between 1993 and 2002 was a truck-based design. The Pilot is Honda&#x27;s largest SUV, although the 2010 Crosstour surpassed the Pilot in length.

The Pilot is sold in North America and the Middle East, while the Honda MDX (first generation Acura MDX) was marketed in Japan and Australia for several years. The second-generation Pilot was also sold in Russia, Ukraine, South Korea, Latin America, and the Philippines. 

== First generation (YF1/2; 2002) ==
===Specifications===
The first-generation Pilot was unveiled in December 2001 and later released for sale on June 3, 2002. 
The 2003 and 2004 model year Pilots featured the J35A4 engine, an all-aluminum 3.5L V6 SOHC with VTEC, producing and of torque.

The 2005 Pilot received a new engine, the J35A6, which added drive-by-wire throttle and produced and of torque. Other changes included the transmission with revised 4th and 5th gear ratios providing a smoother transition between gears, along with a new fuel tank design, increasing the Pilot&#x27;s driving range by over . All Pilots from 2003-2005 feature VTM-4, Honda&#x27;s four-wheel drive system.

The Pilot received more updates in 2005 starting with the 2006 model year, engines were either the J35Z1 (FWD) or the J35A9 (4WD). Both engines were rated at and of torque; the power reduction is because Honda used the updated SAE net power standard. This was the first time 4WD was not standard on the Pilot.

The new FWD models featured Honda&#x27;s Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system, which can deactivate up to three cylinders under light load to increase fuel economy, to help control noise from the system Honda added Active Control Engine Mount System (ACM) and Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). Further, this version of the J35 featured updated iVTEC and the automatic transmission a shorter 1st gear ratio. With powertrain updates and the lack of VTM-4 the FWD version had improved fuel economy of 18-city/24-highway, an increase of +1/+2 mpg versus the 4WD.

All Pilots from this generation feature a 5-speed automatic transmission. The Pilot has front struts with a coil-spring, multilink rear suspension for a flat rear load floor. The front track is 66.3 in (1,684 mm) and 66.5 in (1,689 mm) at the rear. The Pilot has a 4,500 lb (2,041 kg) boat/3,500 lb (1,588 kg) trailer towing capability with the optional dealer-installed towing package.

Pilots with Honda&#x27;s Variable Torque Management 4WD system (VTM-4) sent most power to the front wheels under normal driving conditions. Under acceleration or if wheel slippage is detected at the front wheels, up to 50% of power can be sent to the rear wheels. The system also features a VTM-4 lock button on the dashboard which locks the rear differential and sends 25% of the power to each rear wheel. However, the VTM-4 lock function only operates in first gear, second gear and reverse, and automatically disengages above , then re-engages when the speed drops below .

===Design===
Design of the Pilot was by Honda&#x27;s Ricky Hsu through 1999, when styling was approved. The Pilot can accommodate eight passengers in three rows configured as stadium seating as a standard feature. The third row can seat three, but the limited legroom makes it suitable only for small children or adults on short trips. Similar to the Honda Odyssey, the rear seats can be folded into flat surfaces for larger cargo. Options include a DVD entertainment system or a navigation system for EX-L models, but both cannot be installed simultaneously on the same car.

Other features include ABS-equipped four-wheel disc brakes, rack-and-pinion steering, four-wheel independent suspension, and 282° of outward visibility.

====Model year changes====
In 2003, for the 2004 model year, Honda increased adjustability on second-row seats and added heated front seats and side mirrors to EX-L models.

In 2004, for the 2005 model year, Honda added tire pressure monitoring, electronic stability control, revised steering, and upgraded the airbags. The front passenger airbag featured occupant-sensing deactivation. 
Honda revised the Pilot in October 2005 for the 2006 model year. Changes to the exterior included a new fascia with a different grille insert and halogen projector headlights, and tail lights with clear lenses. The EX trim level received redesigned wheels, and the original EX wheels were featured on the LX trim. For the first time, body colored door handles are introduced to the Pilot on the EX trim, and a powered moonroof is introduced to the Pilot on the EX-L trim. On the inside, side airbags were provided in the C pillar, the gauge cluster was updated and the center console featured chrome trim and redesigned storage compartments and cup holders. For the 2006 model year, Honda added Variable Cylinder Management to the two-wheel-drive models. This VCM tech proved to be problematic in some cases, which led to a class action lawsuit for Honda Motor Co.
In 2006, for the 2007 model year, Honda added Nimbus Gray Metallic, Dark Cherry Pearl, Aberdeen Green Metallic, and Formal Black as four new colors to all models.

In 2007, for the 2008 model year of the first generation Pilot added two new trims. The VP (Value Package) replaces the LX as base trim and SE (special edition) goes in between the EX and EX-L trim.

== Second generation (YF3/4; 2008) ==
The larger second generation Pilot was unveiled as a prototype in January 2008 at the North American International Auto Show, and was released for sale on May 22, 2008. Assembled at Honda Manufacturing of Alabama in Lincoln, Alabama, it was offered in five trims; LX, EX, EX-L, Touring and SE (2015 only). All second generation Pilots used a new J35Z4 3.5-liter V6 i-VTEC engine producing SAE net at 5700 rpm and of torque at 4800 rpm. EPA fuel economy is rated at city / highway with front-wheel-drive and 16 mpg city / 22 mpg highway for all-wheel-drive. Competing with the Toyota 4Runner, it became popular for its truck-like look, which was designed with influences from GM&#x27;s full-size Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon. However it was downsized for better fuel efficiency in the third generation. 

Both drivetrains were equipped with five-speed automatics. The second generation&#x27;s wheelbase is , with a length of , a width of , a height of and interior space of . The redesigned headlights lost the previous generation&#x27;s halogen projectors and return to standard halogen reflectors. Features included new two-position memory settings for the driver&#x27;s seat, a new power tailgate, and the gear shift was relocated from the steering column to the center console between the front seats. The Touring trim included special &quot;Touring&quot; badging on the right side of the back door, a 120-volt power outlet, and a satellite-linked Honda navigation system.

===Model year changes===
In 2010, for the 2011 model year had minimal changes. The voice-activated navigation system which was previously exclusive to the Touring trim became available on the EX-L trim and rear entertainment system became standard equipment on the Touring trim.

In 2011, for the 2012 model year introduced a redesigned front fascia, new alloy wheels, and updates to the interior along with changes to the bumper.

In 2012, for the 2013 model year included a standard rearview backup camera, i-MID central dashboard 8-inch LCD screen, USB connector, Bluetooth hands-free calling and wireless audio streaming, and tri-zone climate control.

In 2014, for the 2015 model year, the SE (special edition) trim was added which came standard with a power moonroof, satellite radio, LED headlights(on Touring models), and rear seat entertainment system.

===Safety===
The Pilot uses Honda&#x27;s Advanced Compatibility Engineering front bracket. For the 2013 model year a rearview backup camera was made standard. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) found the Honda Pilot&#x27;s driver death rate of 2 deaths per million registered among the ten lowest released in their report
*vehicle structure also rated &quot;Poor&quot;

:†Because of more stringent tests, 2011 and newer model ratings are not comparable to pre–2011 ratings.

== Third generation (YF5/6; 2015) ==
The third-generation 2016 Pilot debuted at the Chicago Auto Show in February 2015, and production began in May. It was made available for sale on June 18, 2015.

The exterior is sleeker in appearance compared to its boxier predecessor with a 10 percent reduction in drag area. Added to the exterior are standard LED brake and tail lights, LED daytime running lights (DRLs) on EX trims and above, and LED headlamps with automatic high-low beam switching the on new Elite model with special &quot;Elite&quot; badging. The Elite trim level also gained features that were new to the Pilot, including ventilated front seats, heated rear captain&#x27;s chairs which reduced the seating capacity to seven from eight, and a panoramic roof. Alloy wheels became standard.

Newly available safety features include Honda&#x27;s LaneWatch passenger-side mirror camera or Blind Spot Information (BSI) and rear Cross Traffic Monitor. Additional options, including Forward Collision Warning (FCW) with Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS), Lane Departure Warning (LDW) with Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS) and Road Departure Mitigation (RDM), and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) are available as part of the Honda Sensing suite. A tri-angle backup camera is standard with dynamic guidelines optional.

The revised 3.5-liter V6 engine has direct-injection and a start-stop system (on the Touring and Elite trims) with improved power at , a 6-speed automatic is standard on the LX, EX, and EX-L trims while a ZF 9-speed automatic is standard on the Touring and Elite trims. With all-wheel drive models the amount of engine torque sent to each rear wheel is variable. EPA-estimated fuel economy is improved with front-wheel drive (FWD) 6-speed models registering //, and all-wheel drive (AWD) models registering // (city/highway/combined). 9-speed models see fuel economy of // mpg in FWD configuration and // (city/highway/combined) in AWD configuration.

Though overall dimensions are smaller, the interior becomes more spacious modelled after the Odyssey, and weight is down approximately with noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) reduced. Structurally 21.3% of the Pilot&#x27;s body is composed of 980, 1300 and 1,500 MPa ultra-high-strength steels, 5% is from aluminum or magnesium, an additional 34.5% is 270 MPa mild strength steel used in areas to minimize repair costs.

=== Model year changes ===
In 2016, for the 2017 model year, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto were added to all trims except for the base LX trim.

In 2018, for the 2019 model year, Honda refreshed the Pilot inside and out.

<doc id="1200356" wikidata="Q951034" url="?curid=1200356" title="Alec Lindsay">
<text>Alec Lindsay (born 27 February 1948) is an English former footballer who played in the Football League for Bury, Liverpool and Stoke City.

==Career==
Born in Bury, Lancashire, England, Lindsay played 139 matches for Bury, helping the club gain promotion in 1967–68. Manager Bill Shankly signed him for Liverpool in March 1969 for £67,000. He made his debut against Irish side Dundalk in the European Fairs Cup, on 16 September 1969. Liverpool won by an emphatic 10-0 scoreline, a record win until Liverpool thumped Norwegian side Strømsgodset I.F. 11–0 in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, on 17 September 1974.

After an initial settling in period in which Lindsay played seven times, he was the selected as first choice left back during the 1970–71 season, which included the 1971 FA Cup Final at Wembley. League champions and double hunting Arsenal lay in wait. After the allotted 90 minutes the scores were level 0–0; during extra time the Reds took the lead, the Gunners scored a scrappy equaliser and went on to win the game 2–1 thus completing the league and FA Cup double. Arsenal were victorious that day - Lindsay would be back for another go in 1974 - but first Liverpool won a double of their own in 1973, winning the League championship and UEFA Cup, against Borussia Mönchengladbach in the final. He played in the 1974 FA Cup Final against Newcastle United and despite him having a goal ruled out for offside, Lindsay got his winners medal as Liverpool beat the Magpies 3–0.

This was to be the peak of Lindsay&#x27;s Liverpool career. Shankly, the man who brought Lindsay to Merseyside, decided to retire in the summer of 1974. Unfortunately, for Lindsay, new manager Bob Paisley selected Phil Neal as his regular left-back the following season and even after Neal then moved to his favoured right back role, Lindsay was still rarely selected with Paisley preferring Welshman Joey Jones. He had already played four times for the England team, but was not selected for England again after falling out of favour at Anfield.

Liverpool won two more League titles during the next three years but Lindsay did not play enough games on either occasion to collect a league title medal. He also missed out on the 1976 UEFA Cup success and the 1977 FA Cup final when Liverpool, in search of a &quot;treble&quot;, lost narrowly to rivals Manchester United. However, he was named as one of the five substitutes for the European Cup final in Rome three days later, when Liverpool beat Borussia Mönchengladbach 3–1. He left Anfield in the summer of 1977 and joined Stoke City.

He made a good start to his Stoke career converting three penalties in his first five matches for the club under George Eastham. However, with the expectation at the Victoria Ground to gain an instant return to the First Division Eastham was sacked in early January 1978 with the club languishing in mid-table. New manager Alan Durban decided to play the younger Geoff Scott at left back and Lindsay was allowed to make a move to America.

In 1978, Lindsay moved to the Oakland Stompers of the North American Soccer League (NASL). Following the 1978 season, the Stompers moved to Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and Lindsay moved to the Toronto Blizzard, also of the NASL. He played four times for Toronto Blizzard in 1979 before hanging up his boots at the age of 31.

==International career==
Alec was given his first cap, and subsequently all of his caps, by caretaker manager Joe Mercer on 22 May 1974, England were playing host, at Wembley, to a friendly with Argentina, he was in good company as fellow Reds Kevin Keegan and the England captain Emlyn Hughes were in the starting line-up, the game was played in front of 68,000 people and ended in a 2–2 draw.

==Post-retirement==
Lindsay is placed at 85 in the 2006 poll 100 Players Who Shook The Kop. He is now retired and lives with his partner in Scotland. He remains an avid Liverpool supporter and was a contributor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group&#x27;s (HFSG) &quot;Project 96&quot; in August 2009. After his retirement he became a publican.

<doc id="1200360" wikidata="Q17073908" url="?curid=1200360" title="Panelák">
<text>is a colloquial term in Czech and Slovak for a large panel system panel building constructed of pre-fabricated, pre-stressed concrete, such as those extant in the former Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic &amp; Slovakia) and elsewhere in the world. Paneláks are usually located in housing estates (, ).

 (plural: ) is derived from the standard &quot;panelový dům&quot; or &quot;panelový dom&quot; meaning, literally, &quot;panel house / prefabricated-sections house&quot;. The term &quot;panelák&quot; is used mainly for the elongated blocks with more sections with separate entrances – simple panel tower blocks are called &quot;věžový dům&quot; (tower house) or colloquially &quot;věžák&quot; . The buildings remain a towering, highly visible reminder of the Communist era. The term &quot;panelák&quot; refers specifically to buildings in the former Czechoslovakia, however, similar buildings were a common feature of urban planning in communist countries and even in the West.

==History==

Interwar Czechoslovakia saw many constructivist architects in the country, such as Vladimír Karfík and František Lydie Gahura, many of whom would maintain prominence following the establishment of the Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Republic in 1948. In the years following 1948, the Czechoslovakian architectural scene favored Stalinist architecture over more modern architecture. However, a 1954 speech by Nikita Khrushchev encouraging the construction of panel buildings, coupled by post-war housing shortages faced throughout both eastern and western Europe, encouraged the country&#x27;s architectures to construct more simplistic, modernist buildings. Throughout the mid 1950s, the country&#x27;s designers applied a modernist aesthetic known as the , named after the international attention it attracted during the 1958 World’s Fair held in Brussels. By the late 1960s, the country&#x27;s paneláks often reached up to 16 stories in height.

Between 1959 and 1995, paneláks containing 1.17 million flats were built in what is now the Czech Republic. As of 2005, they housed about 3.5 million people, or about one-third of the country&#x27;s population.

In Prague and other large cities, most paneláks were built in a type of housing estate known as a &quot;sídliště&quot; or &quot;sídlisko&quot; . Such housing developments now dominate large parts of Prague, Bratislava and other cities and towns. The first such housing development built in Prague was Petřiny in the 1950s; the largest in Prague is Jižní Město (about 100,000 inhabitants), with 200 buildings and 30,000 flats built since the 1970s. The Slovak Petržalka however, is the largest such housing development in Central Europe, with its population exceeding 110,000.
Following the Velvet Revolution in 1989, there was widespread speculation that the country&#x27;s paneláks would fall out of favor, due to their simplicity and small size. The Czech and Slovak government sold individual panelák apartments to their tenants for cheap prices, furthering speculation that the apartments would be undesirable. However, these fears have not materialized.

==Characteristics==


A typical panelák apartment has a foyer, bathroom, kitchen, a living room (also used for dining), and a bedroom. All paneláks in the Czech Republic were constructed to follow one of sixteen design patterns.

Paneláks have been criticized for their simplistic design, poor-quality building materials, and their tendency to become overcrowded. In 1990, Václav Havel, who was then the president of Czechoslovakia, called paneláks &quot;undignified rabbit pens, slated for liquidation&quot;. Panelák housing estates as a whole are said by some to be mere bedroom communities with few conveniences and even less character.

However, paneláks have also been praised by many. Upon their introduction, paneláks offered more reliable heating, hot water, and plumbing than existing buildings, especially those in rural locations. The buildings typically offered large amounts of natural light, compared to their older counterparts.

==Today==
Paneláks remain commonplace today, and have attracted a wide diversity of social classes. Fears that paneláks would become undesirable and be subject to middle class flight, commonplace following the Velvet Revolution, have not materialized. Panelák apartments have risen in value more than brick apartments, have been praised for housing people from a wide variety of incomes, and have been subject to a number of positive cultural depictions including magazines and TV shows.

Areas with high shares of its population living in paneláks include the city of Karviná (where approximately 97% of people live in them), Petržalka, and the city of Most (approx. 80%). Most&#x27;s historical city was largely torn down due to the spread of coal mining and the majority of its population was moved into paneláks.

=== Renovations ===
In March 2005, the director of the Czech Ministry of Regional Development expressed concerns that the country&#x27;s paneláks were near the end of their lifespan, citing an increasing number of structural incidents. He estimated that his agency would need 400 billion Czech koruna to modernize paneláks in the Czech Republic, and 1.5 trillion to tear them down entirely.

In recent years, many paneláks have been repainted, renovated, and repaired if needed, with funding mainly from the government, partially thanks to funds from the European Union (EU). A sizable renovation market has formed in recent years, and even a home magazine, &quot;Panel Plus&quot;, exists to give renovators ideas.

=== Ownership ===
Following the Velvet Revolution, most panelák apartments were sold to their tenants at low costs. Many panelák flats are now the property of their inhabitants, though they are also rented out through real estate agents and private landlords, The buildings and surrounding areas are often owned and managed by the government, administrative divisions, housing cooperatives, authorities, self-governing (non-profit) organizations, owners of apartments (individual blocks), and/or through public–private partnerships and such, or a combination thereof.

==Other countries==

Buildings similar to &quot;paneláks&quot; were built also in other communist countries, and they are a common feature of cityscapes across Central and Eastern Europe, and to some degree Northern Europe.

In Bulgaria, buildings similar to paneláks are colloquially known as &quot;panelki&quot;, and are the predominant type of en masse housing throughout the country. In Hungary, similar buildings are called panelház. In Poland, they are called &quot;bloki&quot; (blocks), or &quot;wielka płyta&quot; (the great panel). In Germany they are known as Plattenbau. Most buildings in Soviet-era Microdistricts are panel buildings.

In the EU, among former communist countries, a majority of the population lives in flats in Latvia (65.1%), Estonia (63.8%), Lithuania (58.4%), Czech Republic (52.8%) and Slovakia (50.3%) (as of 2014, data from Eurostat). However, not all flat dwellers in Eastern Europe live in Communist era blocks of flats; many live in buildings constructed after the fall of communism, and some in buildings surviving from the era before communism.

In the United States, some housing estates have buildings that are similar to paneláks or are built from the same or similar material.

==Popular culture==
* The movie &quot;Panelstory&quot; from Věra Chytilová shows the life of several inhabitants in a real unfinished communist-bloc apartment. Awarded a Great Prize in San Remo in 1980.
* Béla Tarr&#x27;s film &quot;Panelkapcsolat&quot; tells a doomed love story set in a similar housing estate in Hungary. Special Mention at the 1982 Locarno Film Festival.
* Polish director Krzysztof Kieślowski&#x27;s celebrated &quot;Dekalog&quot; series is set in a &quot;wielka płyta&quot; housing estate in Warsaw, Poland.
* The long-running Slovak soap opera &quot;Panelák&quot; focused on the residents of a single block in Bratislava. 
* Other popular TV series set largely within the confines of a panelák include the long running sitcom Susedia (&quot;Neighbours&quot;), focusing on the relationships between the ethnically Slovak and Slovak-Hungarian families living within the building, as well as some episodes of the stop-motion animation series &quot;Pat &amp; Mat&quot;.

<doc id="1200366" wikidata="Q2729463" url="?curid=1200366" title="Calamus (fish)">
<text>Calamus is a genus of marine ray-finned fishes belonging to the family Sparidae, the seabreams and porgies. Most of the species in this genus are found in the Western Atlantic Ocean, with 2 species occurring in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Calamus&quot; was first proposed as a monospecific genus in 1839 by the English zoologist William Swainson when he described &quot;Calamus megacephalus&quot; as its only species. The type locality of &quot;C. megacephalus&quot; was given as Martinique, it was later found to be a junior synonym of &quot;Pagellus calamus&quot;, described by Achille Valenciennes in 1830. This genus is placed in the family Sparidae within the order Spariformes by the 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot;. Some authorities classify this genus in the subfamily Sparinae, but the 5th edition of Fishes of the World does not recognise subfamilies within the Sparidae.

==Etymology==
&quot;Calamus&quot; means &quot;quill&quot;, an allusion to what Swainson described as “the second anal-fin spine, hollow, shaped as a pen&quot;. The name of the senior synonym of the type species is, therefore, not a tautonym.

== Species ==
&quot;Calamus contains the fiollowing recognized species:
* &quot;Calamus arctifrons&quot; (Grass porgy)
* &quot;Calamus bajonado&quot; (Jolthead porgy)
* &quot;Calamus brachysomus&quot; {Pacific porgy)
* &quot;Calamus calamus&quot; (Saucereye porgy)
* &quot;Calamus campechanus&quot; (Campeche porgy)
* &quot;Calamus cervigoni&quot; (Spotfin porgy)
* &quot;Calamus leucosteus&quot; 
* &quot;Calamus mu&quot; (Flathead porgy)
* &quot;Calamus nodosus&quot; (Knobbed porgy)
* &quot;Calamus penna&quot; (Sheepshead porgy)
* &quot;Calamus pennatula&quot; (Pluma porgy)
* &quot;Calamus proridens&quot; (Littlehead porgy)
* &quot;Calamus taurinus&quot; (Galápagos porgy)

==Characteristics==
&quot;Calamus&quot; porgies are characterized by having deep, compressed bodies and deep heads which has a steep dorsal profile and deep cheeks. The posterior nostrils are slits. The large mouth has fleshy lips and a large lower jaw. The suborbital bone overlaps the rear of the maxilla. There are 2 rows of teeth in the jaws, the teeth at the front are canine like and those in the rear resemble molars. The preoperculum has no serrations or spines on its margin. The dorsal fin is low and contains 13 spines while the anal fin is contains 3 spines. The pectoral fins are markedly longer than the pelvic fins. The cheeks and gill cover are scaled but the snout and space in front of the eyes are naked. The largest species in the genus is the jolthead porgy (&quot;C. bajonado&quot;) which has a maximum published fork length of while the smallest is the spotfin porgy (&quot;C. cervigoni&quot;) with a maximum published total length of .

==Distribution==
&quot;Calamus&quot; porgies are found in the Americas, 11 of the 13 species being found in the Western Atlantic Ocean and the other 2, &quot;C. brachysomus&quot; and &quot;C. taurinus&quot;, in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

==Fisheries==
Calamus porgies are valued as food fishes and are important quarry species for both commercial and recreational fisheries.

<text>Elixir (Joshua &quot;Josh&quot; Foley) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is usually depicted as a student at the Xavier Institute.

==Publication history==
Elixir first appeared in &quot;New Mutants&quot; vol. 2 #5 and was created by Nunzio DeFilippis, Christina Weir, and Keron Grant.

==Fictional character biography==
Joshua Foley was originally a member of the Reavers. However, after he learns that he is a mutant and his parents disown him, he instead joins the X-Men, becoming Prodigy&#x27;s roommate at the Xavier Institute. After Wolfsbane loses control of her powers and mortally wounds him, Elixir manages to heal himself, which turns his skin gold. He is later among the 198 mutants who retain their powers after M-Day, when the Scarlet Witch depowers most mutants on Earth.

Elixir later joins the Five, a group of mutants who live on Krakoa and combine their powers to resurrect others.

== Powers and abilities ==
Elixir is an Omega-level mutant, capable of controlling the biological structure of any organic matter including his own body. He must be in proximity to whomever he uses his power on. Besides healing, he is capable of boosting and restoring mutant abilities, and possesses a death touch that can swiftly kill others and temporarily turns his skin black. Elixir is also capable of cleansing the effects of drugs and curing the Legacy Virus and M-Pox. He also used his healing abilities to enable Wolfsbane to survive the birth of her and Hrimhari&#x27;s child. The Stepford Cuckoos later transfer the Beast&#x27;s scientific knowledge to Elixir, giving him the knowledge to heal virtually any malady.

Because of his control over his own biology, Elixir has proven to be difficult to treat medically. He usually passes out after pushing his powers too far and remains in a coma for some time. Elixir is also virtually immortal due to his healing abilities enabling him to regenerate his body and resurrect himself if killed.

Elixir later develops the ability to resurrect others. Monet and Magneto speculate that could do so to millions of people at once, but would lose his sanity in the process.

He is also able to detect abnormalities in living beings: he detected techno-organic cells in Angel&#x27;s body, detected Emplate in Monet&#x27;s body, and even sensed a magical inversion in Sabretooth.

==Other versions==

* An alternate universe variant of Joshua Foley from Earth-600123 appears in &quot;New X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #10. This version worked with Prodigy to develop cures for various diseases at the cost of his life.
* An alternate universe variant of Joshua Foley from Earth-58163 appears in &quot;New X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #17. This version is an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

<text>The Maliboomer was an attraction at the Paradise Pier section of Disney California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, US. Manufactured by S&amp;S Power, Mailboomer was a Space Shot attraction, meaning it launched guests from the bottom of the tower instead of slowly lifting them to the top and dropping them from there. The ride was pneumatically powered, with three connected towers, each with its own independent ride system. It also contained &quot;Scream Shields&quot;, used to block the screams from reaching residents of Anaheim and neighboring Garden Grove as the park is located near a residential area.

==History==

In the late 1990s, Disney wanted to build a low-cost theme park next to Disneyland with the use of off-the-shelf rides. One of these attractions would be a drop tower named Maliboomer. The concept came from a space-themed version of the High striker attraction on many boardwalks and carnivals. The name also hinted at this theme, since it alludes to the beach town of Malibu, California. In 1998, Disney revealed more details about the new park, including the name Disney&#x27;s California Adventure. Maliboomer would be a Space Shot ride built by S&amp;S Power and feature three towers. Construction of Maliboomer would begin one year later in 1999.

Maliboomer officially opened to the general public on February 8, 2001, along with the park. With a max height of , it was the park&#x27;s tallest attraction upon opening.

As part of the park&#x27;s multi-year, $1.1 billion expansion, it was announced that Maliboomer would be removed. On August 6, 2010, Disney California Adventure announced that Maliboomer would be closing. The ride&#x27;s last operating day was September 6, 2010, and the dismantling of the attraction began shortly afterwards.

The ride&#x27;s former concrete pad and railings remained for several years and its spot was used for character meet and greets and a smoking area. On June 28, 2019, the Inside Out Emotional Whirlwind attraction, inspired by Pixar&#x27;s 2015 film &quot;Inside Out&quot;, opened in the space where Maliboomer once stood.

<doc id="1200377" wikidata="Q1988436" url="?curid=1200377" title="Center for Security Policy">
<text>The Center for Security Policy (CSP) is a US far-right, anti-Muslim, Washington, D.C.–based think tank. The founder and former president of the organization was Frank J. Gaffney Jr. (now Executive Chairman). The current president since January 1, 2023, is Tommy Waller, a former US Marine. CSP sometimes operates under its DBA name Secure Freedom. The organization also operates a public counter-jihad campaign and the website counterjihad.com.

==History and programs==
In April 1987, Frank Gaffney, Jr. was nominated to serve as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs during the Reagan Administration, having served in that role for seven months until being removed in November of that same year. In a meeting with former Department of Defense officials after Gaffney&#x27;s ouster, Richard Perle, for whom Gaffney had previously served as a top deputy, said, &quot;What we need is the Domino’s Pizza of the policy business. ... If you don’t get your policy analysis in 30 minutes, you get your money back.&quot; Gaffney founded the CSP a year later in 1988. One of the center&#x27;s annual reports later echoed Perle&#x27;s words calling the CSP &quot;the Domino&#x27;s Pizza of the policy business.&quot;

In 2010, there were 19 co-authors of the CSP &quot;Team B II&quot; report &quot;&quot; that claimed sharia law was a major threat to the national security of the United States. In 2012, Gaffney released a 50-page document titled, &quot;The Muslim Brotherhood in the Obama Administration&quot;. The document questioned the Obama administration’s approach to the Muslim Brotherhood in the Middle East. The CSP has since accused a number of US officials of having ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, including Huma Abedin and Grover Norquist.

In 2013, CSP received donations from Boeing ($25,000); General Dynamics ($15,000); Lockheed Martin ($15,000); Northrop Grumman ($5,000); Raytheon ($20,000); and General Electric ($5,000). The group has also received $1.4 million from the Bradley Foundation.

The CSP helped to organize a rally on Capitol Hill on September 9, 2015, against the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal. Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Donald Trump spoke at the rally. In a separate report about Iran, the CSP declared that Susan Rice, Richard Haass, and Dennis Ross were being secretly controlled by a covert &quot;Iran lobby&quot;.

On March 16, 2016, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said he would appoint Gaffney to be his National Security Advisor. Cruz also said his foreign policy team would also include three other employees of Gaffney&#x27;s think tank: Fred Fleitz, Clare Lopez, and Jim Hanson. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump cited a CSP poll in support of his restrictions on travel from several Muslim countries.

===Trump administration===
Since 2017 several people with ties to the CSP have joined the Trump administration, including Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway in 2017, chief of staff for the National Security Council Fred Fleitz in 2018, and Deputy National Security Advisor Charles Kupperman in 2019. Kupperman served on the board of directors for CSP between 2001 and 2010.

The Trump administration used reports released by the CSP when it proposed to ban all Muslims from entering the United States.

==Controversy==
The Center and Gaffney have been criticized for propagating conspiracy theories by Dana Milbank of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Simon Maloy of Salon, CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen, Grover Norquist, Jonathan Kay, Georgetown University&#x27;s Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim–Christian Understanding, Center for American Progress, Media Matters for America, the Southern Poverty Law Center, &quot;The Intercept&quot;, the Anti-Defamation League, and the Institute for Southern Studies, among others. Gaffney has been described as an influential member of the counter-jihad movement, and the CPS has been described as &quot;arguably the most important&quot; counter-jihad advocacy group.

In 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) labeled the CSP as a hate group and a &quot;conspiracy-oriented mouthpiece for the growing anti-Muslim movement&quot;, a characterization disputed by the CSP. SPLC representatives have characterized the CSP as &quot;an extremist think tank&quot; and suggested that it is led by an &quot;anti-muslim conspiracy theorist.&quot; The SPLC further criticizes CSP&#x27;s &quot;investigative reports&quot;, saying that they are designed &quot;to reinforce [Frank] Gaffney&#x27;s delusions&quot;. 

One of the CSP&#x27;s &quot;Occasional Papers&quot; accused Huma Abedin, then Hillary Clinton&#x27;s aide, of being an undercover spy for the Muslim Brotherhood. On June 13, 2012, Republican members of Congress Michele Bachmann, Trent Franks, Louie Gohmert, Thomas Rooney and Lynn Westmoreland, sent a letter to the State Department Inspector General including accusations against Abedin cited to the CSP. The letter and the CSP&#x27;s accusation were widely denounced as a smear, and achieved &quot;near-universal condemnation&quot;, including from several prominent Republicans such as John McCain, John Boehner, Scott Brown, and Marco Rubio.

Writing in Religion Dispatches, Sarah Posner described the organization as &quot;a far-right think tank whose president, Frank Gaffney, was banned from the CPAC [Conservative Political Action Conference] ... because its organizers believed him to be a &#x27;crazy bigot&#x27;&quot;. The Center for Democratic Values at Queens College, City University of New York has said the center is among the &quot;key players in the Sharīʿah cottage industry&quot;, which it describes as a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; that claims the existence of &quot;secretive power elite groups that conspire to replace sovereign nation-states in order to eventually rule the world&quot;.

In March 1995, William M. Arkin, a reporter and commentator on military affairs, criticized the CSP&#x27;s Gaffney as a &quot;maestro of bumper-sticker policy&quot; who &quot;specializes in intensely personal attacks&quot; and who has &quot;never met a flag-waving, pro-defense, anti-Democratic idea he didn&#x27;t like.&quot; Gaffney has also generated controversy for writing in 2010 that the logo of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency &quot;appears ominously to reflect a morphing of the Islamic crescent and star with the Obama campaign logo&quot; and was part of a &quot;worrying pattern of official U.S. submission to Islam&quot;.

<text>Rethel () is a commune in the Ardennes department in northern France. It is a sub-prefecture and third-most important city and economic center in the department. It is situated on the river Aisne, near the northern border of Champagne and 37 km from Reims.

Its inhabitants are called &quot;Rethélois&quot;.

==History==

According to legend, the city was founded by Julius Caesar, who established a camp on the site of the city during his campaigns.

The parents of St. Arnulf of Metz were said to have given all they owned &quot;in villa Reistete&quot; (in the city of Rethel) to St. Remigius, bishop of Reims, so that their prayers for a child would be answered.

The city belonged to the Abbey of Saint-Remi and was administered by its advocati. One of them, Manasses I, became the first Count of Rethel. In 1481 the county, with Rethel as its seat, was elevated to the Peerage of France; it was elevated to a duchy in 1581 and in 1663 it became the Duchy of Mazarin.

During the Franco-Spanish War it was captured by Spanish forces under Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé on 30 October 1652 after a four-year siege, but was retaken by the French in July 1653.

In 1814 Spanish prisoners of war from the Napoleonic Wars introduced typhus to the city. Jean-Baptiste Reberotte-Labesse cared for the soldiers who were ill. Cholera epidemics occurred in 1832 and 1849, while typhoid fever ravaged the city in 1839, with an average of thirty deaths a day.

During World War II Rethel was the site of heavy combat from May to June 1940 during the Battle of France. French troops under Jean de Lattre de Tassigny repelled German assaults on the town for a month before it fell.

In 1974, Rethel absorbed the former commune Pargny-Resson.

==Population==
==Personalities==
Rethel was the birthplace of:
* Jacques Boucher de Crèvecœur de Perthes (1788–1868), archeologist and antiquary
* Louis Christophe François Hachette (1800–1864), publisher.
* Maurice Maillot (1906–1968), film and theater actor.

<doc id="1200401" wikidata="Q163409" url="?curid=1200401" title="Pensacola Ice Pilots">
<text>The Pensacola Ice Pilots were a professional ice hockey team located in Pensacola, Florida. The team was previously affiliated with the Tampa Bay Lightning, Toronto Maple Leafs, New York Islanders (2006–07), and the Chicago Blackhawks. They have also had a working agreement with the Houston Aeros of the AHL for the 04–05 season. On June 23, 2008, the ECHL announced that it had terminated the Ice Pilots&#x27; membership, effective immediately.

The team&#x27;s colors (navy blue and gold) and nickname were a tribute to the long history of Naval aviation in Pensacola (Naval Air Station Pensacola is home to the legendary Blue Angels and the National Museum of Naval Aviation).

The home of the Pensacola Ice Pilots was the Pensacola Civic Center, which was referred to as &quot;The Hangar&quot;, and has a capacity of 8,150.

The Ice Pilots were formerly the Nashville Knights but moved to Pensacola following the 1995–96 season.

==Notable achievements and players==
===Team===
* The 1997–98 Ice Pilots finished the season with a record of 36-24-10 and won the ECHL Southern Conference championship. The Ice Pilots advanced to their only Kelly Cup appearance against the Hampton Roads Admirals. The Ice Pilots took a 2–1 lead in the best-of-seven Kelly Cup Final. But a scheduling conflict at the Norfolk Scope, the Admirals&#x27; home arena, forced a delay of nine days between Games 3 and 4. The Ice Pilots elected to stay in Virginia, rather than return to Pensacola for the week. The Admirals won Games 4 and 5 at home, then clinched the series in Game 6, in Pensacola.
* The 2004–2005 Pensacola Ice Pilots won the Brabham Cup for the most points overall in the league during the regular season.

===Players===
* Glen Metropolit played 54 games for Pensacola in 1996-97 and scored 82 points. He would later join the Washington Capitals (1999–2001; 2001–03), Tampa Bay Lightning (2001), Atlanta Thrashers (2006–07), St. Louis Blues (2007), Boston Bruins (2007–08), Philadelphia Flyers (2008–09), and Montreal Canadiens (2009–10). Metropolit&#x27;s NHL career spanned eight seasons and 407 games.
* Raitis Ivanans played 59 games for Pensacola in 1999–2000, scoring ten points and accumulating 146 penalty minutes. He would later join the Montreal Canadiens, Los Angeles Kings, and Calgary Flames as an enforcer, playing 282 games in the NHL from 2005 to 2012.
* Kevin Colley played 23 games with Pensacola during the 2000–01 season. He also played 16 games for the New York Islanders during the 2005–06 NHL season until a career ending neck injury forced Colley into retirement at the age of 27. In his lone season with the Islanders, Colley won the Bob Nystrom Award, an award given to the Islander &quot;who best exemplifies leadership, hustle and dedication&quot; as voted on by the fans. Colley was named assistant coach of the Utah Grizzlies for the 2007–08 season and later held the position of head coach with the team from 2008 to 2013.
* Ryan Craig played five games with the Ice Pilots during the 2003–04 season before going on to play for the Tampa Bay Lightning, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Columbus Blue Jackets. Craig retired as a player after the 2016–17 AHL season and later joined the Vegas Golden Knights as an assistant coach during their inaugural 2017–18 NHL season.
* Evgeny Artyukhin played six games for the Ice Pilots in 03–04 before playing 72 games for the Tampa Bay Lightning in 05–06, where he scored 17 points in 72 games. Artyukhin would later return the Lightning for the 2008-09 NHL season. He also split time between the Anaheim Ducks and Atlanta Thrashers for the 2009–10 NHL season.
* John Tripp played in 85 games for the Ice Pilots between 2000 and 2002. He appeared in 43 NHL games from 2002 to 2004; 9 games with the New York Rangers during the 2002–03 NHL season, and 34 games with the Los Angeles Kings during the 2003–04 NHL season. Tripp played the next ten seasons in the DEL from 2005 to 2015 and represented Team Germany in the 2010 Olympic Games.
* Evgeny Konstantinov had two separate stints with the Ice Pilots. He played 24 games with the team during the 2001–02 ECHL season and later rejoined the team in 2003–04 and played another 12 games. Konstantinov also had two very brief appearances in the NHL. On December 8, 2000, Konstantinov was played into a game vs the Colorado Avalanche for 24 seconds but did not record any saves. Konstantinov made his second appearance with the Lightning on November 21, 2002, a 6–1 loss to the New York Islanders. Konstantinov allowed a goal on six shots in 20 minutes of play.
* Brian Eklund played 81 games with the Ice Pilots from 2002 to 2004 and set league records during the 2003–04 ECHL season for minutes played (3,724), saves (2,194), saves in a single game (83, in a 2-1 double OT loss) and tied the league record for wins (38).

==Future==
===Transfer to a new league===
After the 2007–08 season, when the Ice Pilots had finished dead last for three consecutive years, team owner Mario Forgione announced he had no intention of fielding a team in Pensacola for the ECHL during the 2008–09 season. Forgione announced plans to keep a team in Pensacola, but one in an unnamed, lower-level league. The ECHL then stated that it would revoke the franchise if need be, and the ECHL made it official on Monday, June 23, 2008. On April 4, 2009, the SPHL announced discussions between potential investors, key government officials, local fans and business leaders in Pensacola, Florida relative to the award of a franchise for the 2009–10 SPHL season. However, the press release stopped short of explicitly stating that this expansion team would not be the Ice Pilots franchise owned by Mario Forgione. Instead the league formed a new team, the Pensacola Ice Flyers, owned by former NHL player Tim Kerr.

===Hockey returns to Nashville in 1998===
Once the Nashville Knights had moved to their new location in 1996, Nashville was left with no ice hockey team to follow. However, this was changed in 1998 when the Knights&#x27; successors, the National Hockey League&#x27;s Nashville Predators were founded in the 1998 NHL expansion. The Predators have stayed in Nashville since their inaugural season in 1998, spending 24 seasons in the city and league with their 25th season currently in progress. Despite being their successors, the Predators do not actually have any kind of affiliation or tribute to the Knights.

The Predators have yet to win a Stanley Cup title. They did, however, make an appearance in the 2017 Stanley Cup Finals, but ultimately lost to their opponent, the Pittsburgh Penguins in the span of six games. Despite having almost always first round exits since then, the Predators have had great consistency with making the playoffs, clinching eight times in a row as of the 2022-23 season. Out of their 24 seasons, 15 of them ended with playoff appearances.

==Former Ice Pilots who have gone on to represent their country internationally==

* Evgeny Artyukhin () - Artyukhin represented Russia on the U17, U18, and U20 teams but has only played sparingly for the Russian National Team due to his size and style of play not fitting the typical European style of hockey.

* Greg Chambers (/) - Canadian-born Chambers first played in the United Kingdom during the 2005–2006 season after spending 2004–2005 in Italy. He has played there ever since and acquired British citizenship and is now a member of the British National Team.

He will make his IIHF debut for the Belarusian National Team at the 2018 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships.
* Glen Metropolit () - Metropolit played for the Ice Pilots in 1996-1997 before making it to the NHL 3 seasons later. Despite playing mostly a journeyman&#x27;s career, Metropolit represented his home nation in the 2006 IIHF World Championship playing for the Canadian National Team.
* Corey Neilson (/) - Neilson is Canadian born and even represented Canada for two games in a non-IIHF event during the 1999–2000 season. He moved to the United Kingdom prior to the 2006–2007 season and has lived there ever since. He waited some time to get his British Citizenship but has done so and is now a member of the British National Team and will compete with them for the first time in the 2011 IIHF World Championship Division I Group B in Kyiv, Ukraine.
* John Tripp (/) - Canadian-born Tripp started his professional career in North America before signing with Adler Mannheim of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. He acquired German citizenship and represented the German National Team in the 2010 Winter Olympics.

<text>Palliser Bay is at the southern end of the North Island of New Zealand, to the southeast of Wellington. It runs for 40 kilometres along the Cook Strait coast from Turakirae Head at the southern end of the Remutaka Ranges to Cape Palliser, the North Island&#x27;s southernmost point. The coastline is exposed to the weather and winds.

Inland from the bay is the plain of the Ruamahanga River, which has its outflow in the bay. This river flows through Lake Wairarapa, 10 kilometres from the coast.

There are several notable geographical features in the area, including the Pūtangirua Pinnacles, Kupe&#x27;s Sail and the Whatarangi Bluff, the erosion of which has had dramatic effects on the coastline. Some of these cliffs are made of mudstone and are therefore easily eroded, and sometimes collapse.

<text>Celldweller is an electronic rock project by American multi-musician Klayton. Celldweller&#x27;s songs have been featured in many films, movie trailers, television shows and video games.

==Career==
===Precursors: Circle of Dust and Angeldust (1992–1999)===
The name Celldweller was derived from a nickname his mother gave him when he was a teenager, dubbed &quot;Cellar Dweller&quot;, as he made all of his music in his parents&#x27; basement. Klayton had gained a devoted cult following in the mid 90s because of his industrial metal band Circle of Dust. After the dissolution of Circle of Dust, Klayton concurrently released both a posthumous collection of reworked Circle of Dust leftovers titled &quot;Disengage&quot; and an album for a new project, Angeldust, created in conjunction with illusionist Criss Angel. Both albums demonstrated Klayton&#x27;s shift away from industrial metal and towards more electronic-modern industrial rock influences, incorporating richer electronic instrumentation and greater emphasis on melody. This change in style was a major step toward the sound that would come to define Celldweller&#x27;s output. Klayton began creating songs for the Celldweller project in 1998/1999 and released a limited edition EP of three early Celldweller demos and two solo trance tracks, which quickly sold out. Klayton and Chriss Angel parted ways in May of 2000 after three albums&#x27; worth of material had been completed, allowing Klayton to devote all of his time to Celldweller.

===Eponymous debut period (1999–2004)===
Klayton worked in earnest with producer Grant Mohrman (formerly of Leaderdogs for the Blind and Full on the Mouth) on the debut &quot;Celldweller&quot; album, which was slated for release in February 2001. Unfortunately, various delays kept pushing the release date back. During this time, Klayton kept fans up to date with numerous Celldweller Logs through his website and via email and, in 2001, released raw files of the song &quot;Symbiont&quot; to give fans and fellow musicians a chance to remix Celldweller&#x27;s music. Eight remixes were chosen and uploaded to the original Mp3.com, most of them making it to the top of the Electronic and the Electro-Industrial charts. All the exposure led to over 500,000 song plays on Mp3.com. The &quot;Symbiont&quot; remixes became a digital EP six years later.

The self-titled debut album saw release in early 2003 and debuted at No. 17 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Internet Sales Chart. &quot;Celldweller&quot; included a guest appearance by Taproot drummer Jarrod Montague. In 2004, the album took home seven awards at the Just Plain Folks Music Awards, winning Album of the Year, Producer of the Year, Industrial Album of the Year, Metal Song of the Year (&quot;One Good Reason&quot;) and Best Industrial Rock Song (&quot;Switchback&quot;), and also took runner-up in Best Industrial Song with &quot;Stay with Me (Unlikely)&quot; and Best Rock Song with &quot;I Believe You&quot;. Later, the songs &quot;Birthright&quot; and &quot;Switchback&quot; were included in the list of Hard and Extreme Mode songs respectively for the popular iPhone OS game &quot;Tap Tap Revenge&quot;.

In 2004, Klayton put together a double disc release called &quot;The Beta Cessions&quot;. The first disc contained a re-recording of the last Circle of Dust song, &quot;Goodbye&quot;, alternate mixes of &quot;Switchback&quot;, the Klayton tracks from the initial Celldweller EP, and demo versions of debut &quot;Celldweller&quot; songs. The second disc contained the full debut album in instrumental form, with a few of the instrumentals being slightly edited. Klayton stated that he plans to release Beta Cessions to coincide with each of his major albums to collect outtakes, demos, and other rarities.

In the years following the release of the first Celldweller album, various remix EPs were released, culminating in the conception of the Take It &amp; Break It Celldweller Remix Competition in 2006. Expanded off the fan remix concept that Klayton first toyed with in 2001 with the Symbiont remixes, the Take It &amp; Break It competition saw the creation of its own website on which unlimited numbers of fans could register, download and remix the individual recording files of various Celldweller songs, and then submit their remixes. Three rounds of the competition were completed, with compilations of Celldweller remixes being released at the end of each round. In 2008, the Celldweller Remix Competition evolved into the FiXT Remix Competition where fans, remixers, and musicians have the opportunity to remix songs of not only Celldweller but other FiXT Music artists as well.

In December 2008, Klayton released &quot;Soundtrack for the Voices in My Head Vol. 01&quot;, a collection consisting primarily of short, instrumental score-based compositions. He selected and reworked demos from his extensive archives that he felt would suit for film, TV and video game licensing. Additionally, some songs were from the (then work in progress) second main Celldweller album sessions. Celldweller&#x27;s management has sought to have these songs placed in media, like those on the debut album, and several have already been heard on film and television and in video games.

===&quot;Wish Upon a Blackstar&quot; period (2004–2012)===

Writing and recording for the second Celldweller album has been underway since 2004. Originally slated to come out in the summer of 2006, the album has been delayed numerous times. In March 2009, Klayton announced that the title of the album is &quot;Wish Upon a Blackstar&quot;. Of 50 songs, he has narrowed it down to the 10 that will comprise the album. In a blog post on his website, he elaborated on wanting to release the album in &quot;Chapters&quot; with each Chapter consisting of two songs.

In April 2009, Klayton revealed the tracks &quot;Wish Upon a Blackstar&quot; would contain, and has also stated that many of the leftovers will be on the second volume of The Beta Cessions.

During the recording of &quot;Wish Upon a Blackstar&quot;, Klayton also began work on his follow-up to &quot;Soundtrack for the Voices in My Head Vol. 01&quot; (SVH). &quot;Soundtrack for the Voices in My Head Vol. 02&quot; will be released in the same manner as &quot;Wish Upon a Blackstar&quot;: as handfuls of tracks are completed, Chapters of the full album will be released digitally until the full collection is complete and the album is released on physical media. Chapter 01 of &quot;SVH Vol. 02&quot; featured four songs, including a 20-minute ambient piece titled &quot;Adrift on Celestial Seas&quot; (a first for Celldweller). Additionally, a Limited Edition CD of Chapter 01 was released on December 7, 2010 that contained a bonus short ambient track, &quot;Distants&quot;.

In addition to working on &quot;Wish Upon a Blackstar&quot; and &quot;SVH Vol. 02&quot;, Celldweller kept busy on other fronts. He produced the remainder of the debut Blue Stahli album, appeared on the soundtrack of the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 game &quot;Dead Rising 2&quot; with a new original song, &quot;Kill the Sound&quot;, as well as a selection of previously released Celldweller songs, and also remixed songs for BT and JES.

Klayton confirmed in April 2010 that, for the first time in five years, he would be taking Celldweller on the road. The live band would consist of Klayton and fellow FiXT recording artist Blue Stahli. The first leg of the tour, in the fall of 2010, included shows at Triton Fest in New York City, Dragoncon in Atlanta, Georgia, and EBM Fest in Toronto. In November 2010, Klayton announced that he is planning to release studio recordings of the alternate live versions of Celldweller songs played on the tour. The first of these releases, &quot;Cellout EP 01&quot;, is available as an iTunes exclusive, released on January 25, 2011.

On May 4, 2011, a four-EP bundle was released via Groupees in a 72-hour only exclusive online sale with 20% of the benefits going to Red Cross for Tornado Relief. The EPs in the promotion were &quot;Cellout EP 01&quot;, Chapter 01 of &quot;Soundtrack for the Voices in My Head Vol. 02&quot;, Chapter 03 of &quot;Wish Upon a Blackstar&quot; and the &quot;Unreleased EP&quot; which contained previously unreleased songs and remixes including a song titled &quot;Senorita Bonita&quot; from the Chapter 02 of &quot;SVH Vol. 02&quot; and a Beta Cessions demo, &quot;Atmospheric Light&quot;.

In May 2011, in a Ustream broadcast Klayton mentioned that he was planning to launch a Celldweller VIP Membership, which would give &quot;access to unreleased demos, video, news, discounts &amp; more&quot;. It was to be launched in &quot;early/mid July&quot;, 2011.

On November 24, 2011, Klayton announced that he is planning to release &quot;Wish Upon a Blackstar&quot; on March 27, 2012.

Chapter 02 of &quot;Soundtrack for the Voices in My Head Vol. 02&quot; was released on February 14, 2012 and pre-orders of &quot;Live Upon a Blackstar&quot; began on the same day along with an announcement about the delay of &quot;Wish Upon a Blackstar&quot; to May 22, 2012. On March 2, 2012, Klayton released a new SVH song, &quot;Elara&quot; as a single.

The MP3 Album version of &quot;Live Upon a Blackstar&quot; was released on March 26, 2012, one day early. However, the &quot;Live Upon a Blackstar&quot; Blu-ray DVD was delayed to April 17, 2012 and was delayed again, to May 22, 2012. The release date of &quot;Wish Upon a Blackstar&quot; was also moved.

On May 22, 2012, the &quot;Live Upon a Blackstar&quot; DVD/Blu-ray was delayed to June 12, 2012.

On June 12, 2012, &quot;Wish Upon a Blackstar&quot; was released alongside the &quot;Live Upon a Blackstar&quot; Blu-ray DVD. The next day, Klayton released a new &quot;SVH Vol. 02&quot; song as a single and he also announced the release date of July 24, 2012 for the full &quot;Soundtrack for the Voices in My Head Vol. 02&quot; album. On July 16, 2012, a new vocal song titled &quot;Tough Guy&quot; was released for free download on Dubstep.net. Klayton stated that this song is &quot;towards the next Celldweller album&quot;.

On September 14, 2012, a new Klash-Up, &quot;Miss Murder&#x27;s Personal Jesus&quot; was premiered Alternative Press&#x27;s website. It contains elements of AFI&#x27;s &quot;Miss murder&quot; and Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;.
On October 19, 2012, another Klash-Up titled &quot;Cry Little Sister Vs. Hello Zepp&quot; was released on Bloody Disgusting&#x27;s website. It contains elements of Gerard McMahon&#x27;s &quot;Cry Little Sister&quot; and &quot;Hello Zepp&quot; from &quot;Saw&quot;.

On October 22, 2012, Klayton announced International Tour, including shows in Estonia, Latvia, Russia and Ukraine.

On October 26, 2012, Celldweller launched another Groupees campaign, selling &quot;Soundtrack for the Voices in My Head Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;Vol. 2&quot;, &quot;Live Upon a Blackstar&quot;, &quot;Wish Upon a Blackstar&quot;, &quot;The Complete Cellout&quot; as well as offering the &quot;Live Upon a Blackstar&quot; DVD for digital download with a portion of all the sales were donated to the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund. Through the campaign, donors unlocked a new 3-song &quot;Unreleased EP 2&quot; with demo songs that were intended for &quot;Wish Upon a Blackstar&quot;.

On December 11, 2012, the &quot;Space &amp; Time EP&quot; was released containing remixes of various songs from &quot;Wish Upon a Blackstar&quot;.

===&quot;Blackstar&quot; and &quot;End of an Empire&quot; (2013–2015)===

On the February 11, 2013, which marked the 10th anniversary of the release of his debut album, Klayton announced that he was working on a re-issue of the debut album, along with a two-disc Deluxe Edition due out in May. The finished version of the unreleased song, &quot;Uncrowned&quot;, was also released with the re-issue. It was originally written for the debut album, but never made it on there. The re-issue also contains remastered versions of the tracks released during the Groupees promotions, alongside never heard before tracks. On May 1, 2013, Klayton posted an announcement video on his social networking pages that the re-issue of his debut album was available for pre-order from the FiXT website. The re-issue was released on June 10, 2013, one day before the original release date.

On March 29, 2013, he released a previously unreleased song entitled &quot;Younger&quot;, featuring Kenzie as a free download. The song was written approximately four years ago.

Klayton also released two songs with James Dooley, entitled &quot;Black Sun&quot; and &quot;Rise from the Underworld&quot;. &quot;Black Sun&quot; appeared in the film &quot;I, Frankenstein&quot;.

Klayton announced, in February 2013, that he would be publishing a new novel, titled &quot;Blackstar&quot;, based upon/inspired by his album &quot;Wish Upon a Blackstar&quot;. The novel was being written by five-time award-winning author Josh Viola (director of the &quot;Unshakeable&quot; music video) of &quot;The Bane of Yoto&quot; and renowned author Keith Ferrell of &quot;Bloodmoon: Birth of the Beast&quot;. The first act was released on December 3, 2013.

&quot;Soundtrack for the Voices in My Head Vol. 03&quot; was also announced on his Facebook. Chapter 01 of &quot;SVH Vol. 03&quot; was revealed by The Orchard. It was released earlier exclusively on iTunes on July 2, 2013. On other online stores, including FiXT Store, it was released on July 16, 2013.

Klayton also announced a new project with music producer Varien, called Scandroid. A website was created with a preview of a new song. The full song, &quot;Salvation Code&quot;, was released on August 6, 2013.

On August 23, 2013, Celldweller posted an image of him and what he described on the post as a set for a music video shoot. The song it is for is currently unknown, but details about the video were posted a day later, with an image of a forest and with a quote &quot;I am here shooting a Celldweller music video (feat @bluestahli.)&quot; with Blue Stahli playing a guest role in the video, and in another post, that they are wearing space suits in the woods. In a post on the next day after that, he commented to say that he and Blue Stahli are celebrating the wrap of the music video, along with &quot;#theluckyones&quot;, possibly meaning that the song will be &quot;The Lucky One&quot;.

On November 22, 2013, Celldweller released &quot;Zombie Killer&quot;, an EP consisting of the tracks he composed for the official soundtrack of &quot;Dead Rising 3&quot;.

On December 6, 2013, Celldweller released the official music video to &quot;Unshakable&quot; a week earlier to its initial release date due to fans making over 100 reviews on &quot;Blackstar&quot; Ebook and score on iTunes and Amazon. On January 5, 2014, he released a short song called &quot;Snowcore&quot; on his SoundCloud page.

In February 2014, Celldweller announced the &quot;Sonix Producer Pack Vol. I&quot;, which features sounds that Klayton created for music production. It was released to the public on February 11, 2014.

On April 12, 2016, Celldweller released an album containing remixes of his 2012 extended play &quot;Space &amp; Time&quot;. Most remixes were produced by popular electronic music artists such as KJ Sawka, Zardonic and Katfyr among others.

The fourth full-length vocal album (and seventh overall album), &quot;Offworld&quot;, was released on July 28, 2017, containing 11 songs (one is a remix of &quot;Awakening With You&quot; by Ulrich Schnauss). The songs are in contrast to the project&#x27;s aggressive guitars and beats, containing lighter variations of instruments and slower tempos. It peaked on &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Albums chart at no. 17, and &quot;Billboard&quot; Independent Albums at no. 35.

===&quot;Satellites&quot; (2019present)===
On February 20, 2019, Celldweller released a new single from his upcoming fifth studio album, &quot;Satellites&quot;, called &quot;My Disintegration&quot;. The full-length album will include the latest single, &quot;Into the Void&quot; as well, and was scheduled for release in 2020.

On August 23, 2022, Celldweller announced that &quot;Satellites&quot; would be released on October 14.

==YouTube==

While he has owned a YouTube account since 2006, Klayton started up a YouTube career in 2014 when he started six shows on his YouTube channel.

The show &quot;Demo Vault&quot; consists of demos that Klayton stored away, with the first release &quot;Klay Out West&quot; on February 28, 2014. On May 30, 2014, he released the first in a series of compilations, &quot;Demo Vault Vol. 01&quot;. Followed by &quot;Demo Vault Vol. 02&quot; on September 5. On October 17, 2014, Klayton released the final episode of &quot;Demo Vault&quot;, stating that he didn&#x27;t really run out of material but thinks the rest just isn&#x27;t good enough to be published.

The show &quot;Ask Klayton&quot; (formerly &quot;Ask Celldweller&quot;) is a question &amp; answer show where questions are submitted by fans via comments and video responses. Each episode was previously uploaded every second and fourth Tuesday of the month. They later changed to being uploaded monthly, though the series is now being uploaded more irregularly, in the form of &quot;One Off&quot; uploads.

&quot;Cellevision&quot; involved Klayton contacting and meeting with other FiXT artists. The episodes were uploaded every first and third Thursday. No episodes have been uploaded since April 5, 2017.

&quot;Celldweller Production&quot; has him showing off the equipment he uses to make music. The episodes were uploaded every other month, though they are uploaded more infrequently now.

&quot;Recording Cessions&quot; has him creating, recording and mastering music in his studio. The episodes were uploaded every fourth Thursday, though now they seem to be uploaded before the release of a single or album.

The final show, &quot;Transmissions&quot; (previously &quot;Because I Can&quot;) has Klayton creating experimental tracks with his modular system, like &quot;Snowcore&quot;, &quot;A Storm on Saturn&quot;, &quot;Metropolitan&quot; and &quot;The Halls of Valhalla&quot;, a compilation of these experiments, &quot;Transmissions: Vol. 01&quot;, was released on December 23, 2014, followed by Volumes 2 and 3 released on May 5, 2015 and May 6, 2016, respectively. &quot;Transmissions: Vol 4&quot; was later released August 18, 2017. The &quot;Transmissions&quot; series was later moved to his FreqGen project.

<text>Turakirae Head is a promontory and scientific reserve on the southern coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is located at the western end of Palliser Bay, 20 kilometres southeast of Wellington, at the southern end of the Remutaka Range. The headland is notable for a series of marine terraces and beach ridges that record uplift from past earthquakes. Turakirae Head is also home to a seal colony and southern bull kelp.

Turakirae also marks the southernmost coastal boundary point for the Ngāti Kahungunu tribe which extends as far north as Paritu which is just south of Gisborne.

== Geology ==
Four Holocene marine terraces are visible at Turakirae Head, providing a record of earthquake-caused uplifting of the land over the last 7000 years. The lowest ridge was raised by the 1855 Wairarapa earthquake, which caused a maximum uplift of 6.4 m. The next ridge, with a maximum uplift of 9.1 m, was previously thought to have formed as a result of the Haowhenua earthquake around 1460 AD, but is now believed to have formed around 110–430 BC. The third ridge is estimated to have been uplifted by up to 6.8 m after an earthquake between 2164–3468 BC, and the highest and oldest ridge, with a maximum uplift of 7.3 m, occurred after a seismic event in 4660–4970 BC. After the uplift caused by each earthquake, a new terrace and beach ridge formed below the previous one at sea level. All four storm-beach ridges are tilted relative to the sea level which has changed little in 7000 years, with a greater tilt to westward.

== Scientific reserve ==
During the 1960s, thousands of tonnes of boulders were removed from Turakirae Head to be used in construction of the Wellington Urban Motorway. In 1970 the government bought 240 acres of land at Turakirae Head from the Riddiford Estate, in order to protect and preserve the geologic record shown by the raised beaches along the shoreline which were in danger of being destroyed by further possible removal of rock for public works. A fur seal colony became established at Turakirae Head in 1950, and up to 500 seals, mostly juvenile males, overwinter at the colony each year. The reserve is also home to skinks and geckos, and birds such as the banded dotterel, Caspian tern and variable oystercatcher. Fire and grazing by sheep, cattle and rabbits have affected vegetation in the area. In 1998, a new population of shrubby tororaro – classified as a nationally threatened plant – was established at Turakirae Head to bolster an existing population of the shrub at the reserve.

== Ship scuttling area ==
Between 1905 and 1952, 29 ships were scuttled in the waters off Turakirae Head. The scuttling ground was an area approximately five kilometres south-east of the headland, where the water is about 700 metres deep. Although the ships were usually stripped of their fittings before disposal, the deep water is likely to have preserved the hulls. The site is archaeologically significant because the vessels sunk there include a range of ships dating from the 1830s to the early twentieth century, built of wood or iron and powered by sail or steam and thus representing changes in technology. After 1952, ships were scuttled in deeper water further out in Cook Strait, south-west of Cape Palliser.

== Access ==
Access to Turakirae Head is via the Coast Road from Wainuiomata, which ends 3 km from the reserve, and then by foot across private land. There is also a track which runs from the Corner Creek campsite in Wairarapa around the coast to the end of the Coast Road.

<text>Caba, officially the Municipality of Caba (; ; ), is a coastal municipality in the province of La Union, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 23,119 people.

Caba is notable as the birthplace of Diego Silang, a prominent Filipino revolutionary leader who led an uprising against Spanish colonial rule in the Ilocos Region in 1762. The municipality is known for its thriving bamboo industry and its scenic beaches. As of 2022, Caba had 17,787 registered voters.

==Etymology==
The town has historically been referred to by three names: &quot;Caba, Cava,&quot; and &quot;Caua&quot;. According to local historian Pedro Manongdo, two main theories explain the origin of the town&#x27;s name.

One theory suggests that the name originated from an incident when a Spaniard asked an inhabitant for the name of the place. The youth, misunderstanding the question as referring to the animal he was herding, responded with “Cava.” The name was subsequently repeated and evolved into Cava, and later Caba.

Another theory posits that the name Caba was adopted by a group of immigrants from Barrio Caba in San Carlos, Pangasinan, who settled in the area during the later years of the 16th century. In recognition of their place of origin, they named their new settlement Caba.

==History==

=== Early History ===
The town of Caba was historically part of the ancient region of Pangasinan, known as &quot;Alingay&quot; or &quot;Alinguey&quot; (modern-day Aringay). The area was initially settled by Pangasinans along the coastal regions, accompanied by smaller communities of Samtoys (Ilocanos). These early inhabitants practiced animism, a belief system attributing spiritual significance to natural objects and phenomena, which played a significant role in shaping their cultural and religious traditions.

The coastal settlement was an active trading hub, engaging with neighboring coastal and highland communities, including the Pangasinans along Lingayen Gulf, Ilocanos (Samtoys) to the north and the Ibalois, Kankanaey, and Ifugao from the Cordillera mountains following the Aringay trail. The settlement also traded with foreign merchants from China, Japan, and other Maritime Southeast Asian countries. Frequently traded goods included gold, jars, silk, woven fabrics, ceramics, and glass beads and others, reflecting the region&#x27;s economic vitality.

=== Spanish Colonization ===
In 1572, Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo and his soldiers arrived in the area after pacifying the nearby settlement of &quot;Aroo&quot; or &quot;Agoho&quot; (modern-day Agoo), which had a significant Japanese trading presence. As part of his mission to subjugate northern regions following the Spanish conquest of Manila, Salcedo named the area &quot;El Puerto de Japon&quot; (&quot;Japanese Port&quot;) due to the active trade conducted by Japanese and Chinese merchants. Although Salcedo attempted to persuade the locals to pay tribute to Spain, he continued his journey northward, eventually founding Vigan as &quot;Villa Fernandina de Vigan&quot; in honor of Prince Ferdinand, the late son of King Philip II.

By 1598, Augustinian friars formally established the settlement, with Don Agustin de la Cruz appointed as its first leader. The area became a barrio in 1692, led by Don Luis Manongdo as the cabeza de barangay. The settlement operated under the encomienda system, where local inhabitants were entrusted to Spanish encomenderos, friars, and native nobles in exchange for tribute and governance. The name &quot;Cava&quot; or &quot;Caba&quot; has two conflicting origins: one theory attributes it to immigrants from Barrio Caba in San Carlos, Pangasinan, while another suggests it derived from a Spaniard’s interaction with a local boy who responded &quot;cava&quot; when asked the name of the place.

During the 1700s, Ilocano immigrants from Ilocos provinces and nearby towns began settling in the coastal areas. Seeking to escape oppressive conditions imposed by Spanish colonizers, they cultivated the land through agriculture and fishing, further contributing to the settlement&#x27;s development.

In 1745, Caba, initially a barrio of Aringay, was established as a municipality under the jurisdiction of the Province of Pangasinan and the Bishopric of Nueva Segovia. Don Pablo Vergara was the first gobernadorcillo, as noted by Father Jose Braganza, SVD. However, historian Julian Martin claims that Caba was founded in 1844. By 1783, under Don Domingo Aragon’s leadership as gobernadorcillo, Caba had developed into a town.

==== Silang Revolt ====
Diego Silang, a native of Caba, emerged as a prominent leader during the Ilocos Revolt of 1762-1763. Historians recognize him as the &quot;“guiding genius of the Iloco war of independence”&quot; and an able military leader. Silang established an independent rebel government in Northern Luzon and advocated for reforms within the colonial government. However, on May 28, 1763, he was assassinated by one of his followers in a treacherous act orchestrated by Spanish authorities. His wife, Gabriela Silang, took up the cause and continued the rebellion until her capture and public execution in Vigan on September 20, 1763. Despite their tragic deaths, their resistance left a lasting legacy.

==== Creation of La Union ====
On October 29, 1849, Governor-General Narciso Zaldua Clavería issued a decree merging eight towns from Pangasinan, three from Ilocos Sur, and territories in the Cordillera to form the province of La Union. On March 2, 1850, Governor-General Antonio María Blanco signed the &quot;Superior Decreto&quot;, officially establishing La Union as a province and Captain Toribio Ruiz de la Escalera as the first Gobernador Military y Politico. Among its founding towns were Caba, San Fernando (the cabecera), Santo Tomas, Rosario, Tubao, Agoo, Aringay, Naguilian, Bauang, San Juan, Balaoan, Luna, Bangar, and Bacnotan. On April 18, 1854, Queen Isabella II of Spain issued the royal decree (real orden) from Madrid confirming Blanco&#x27;s &quot;Superior Decreto&quot;.

==== Philippine Revolution ====

During the Philippine Revolution, Caba’s residents actively participated in the struggle for independence from Spain. Under the leadership of General Manuel Tinio y Bondoc, allied with Emilio Aguinaldo, they engaged in battles against Spanish forces in Northern Luzon. The town served as a strategic passageway and refuge for Aguinaldo and his troops during their movements northward.

=== American Colonization ===
During the Philippine-American War, American forces set foot on La Union soil on November 20, 1899. Filipino guerrillas were prepared for action, with the town becoming a center of resistance led by Guerrilla Unit No. 1 under the leadership of Captain Rivera. The unit operated in Caba and nearby areas, including Naguilian and Galiano (now part of Burgos). These guerrilla efforts played a crucial role in resisting American forces and defending the town&#x27;s autonomy during the conflict.

In 1903, the Philippine Commission reorganized the administrative and territorial structure of municipalities across the country. Due to a sparse population and financial challenges, smaller municipalities were merged. As a result, Caba was integrated with Aringay, while Santo Tomas was merged with Agoo.

In 1907, Executive Order No. 41 was issued, mandating the separation of Caba from Aringay. This order took effect on January 1, 1908, officially restoring Caba as a regular municipality, with Francisco Sobredillo serving as its Chief Executive.

=== Japanese Occupation ===
Caba, along with the nearby towns of Agoo and Bauang were the first places the Japanese invasion force sought to control during the main effort to capture Luzon at the beginning of World War 2 - now known as the Japanese Invasion of Lingayen Gulf. Capturing the three towns which were connected by a high quality road, but protected on one side by the ocean and the other by the sea, meant that the Japanese forces were easily able to establish a secure beachhead. Once they had done so, they launched attacks against defense forces at San Fernando, La Union and Rosario, La Union, and from there they deployed southwards across the plains of Pangasinan and Tarlac to take Fort Stotsenburg in Pampanga, then Bulacan, and finally Manila.

=== During the Marcos dictatorship ===

The beginning of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines because Ferdinand Marcos had used foreign debt to fund too many public works projects as he headed his 1969 reelection campaign, which led to the 1969 Philippine economic crisis and the First Quarter Storm protests. La Union residents mostly did not speak up about the economic stresses they were experiencing, but when Marcos declared martial law in 1972, Caba was included with the rest of the country.

Marcos&#x27; efforts to consolidate political power did not get much resistance in the La Union, including Caba, and La Union residents mostly did not speak up about the economic stresses they were experiencing. This was because Marcos took advantage of strong political ties to La Union, and allowed the powerful family factions (which had dominated La Union politics since before the American colonial era) to stay in place.

=== Later 20th Century ===

After Marcos fled into exile after the civilian-led 1986 People Power revolution, Edgar T. Bacungan was appointed OIC mayor under the new Provisional Revolutionary Government. He was then properly elected into office when the Fifth Philippine Republic was established, serving until 1992.

In 1990, Caba was heavily affected by the 1990 Luzon earthquake.

<doc id="1200424" wikidata="Q914119" url="?curid=1200424" title="Cape Palliser">
<text>Cape Palliser is a promontory on the southern coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island and is the southernmost point of the North Island; it is in fact considerably farther south than Nelson or Blenheim in the South Island.

It is located at the eastern end of Palliser Bay, 50 kilometres southeast of Wellington – 100 kilometres by road.
A small settlement, Ngawi, is situated near Cape Palliser, where the main income comes from crayfish (southern rock lobster) fishing. Fishing boats are pushed into the sea on their trailers by bulldozers.

Ngā Rā-a-Kupe, previously known as Kupe&#x27;s Sail, is a nearby triangular upthrust of sedimentary rock shaped like a sail. Māori history and the Kupe legend both feature Cape Palliser. Cape Palliser was named in 1770 by Captain James Cook in honour of his friend Admiral Sir Hugh Palliser of the British Royal Navy. On 7 March 2023, the name of the cape was officially gazetted as Cape Palliser / Mātakitaki-a-Kupe, following the enactment of the Ngāti Kahungunu ki Wairarapa Tāmaki nui-a-Rua Claims Settlement Act 2022. The Māori-language portion of the name refers to Kupe gazing out to sea from the location.

The Cape Palliser Lighthouse is located here; it was first lit in 1897 but became automated in 1986. It flashes twice every 20 seconds.

== Biodiversity ==

Cape Palliser is home to a permanent fur seal colony. The rookery was found there in 1991, the first one found in the North Island in the 20th century, indicating that the seals are recovering from previous exploitation.

Cape Palliser is also a breeding site for red-billed gulls. This species has the conservation status of &quot;Nationally at risk&quot; and is &quot;Regionally Vulnerable&quot; in the Wellington region.

<text>Blinky Bill is an anthropomorphic koala and children&#x27;s fictional character created by author and illustrator Dorothy Wall. The character of Blinky first appeared in Brooke Nicholls&#x27; 1933 book, &quot;Jacko – the Broadcasting Kookaburra&quot;, which was illustrated by Wall. Wall then featured Blinky Bill in a series of her own books, including &quot;Blinky Bill: The Quaint Little Australian&quot;, &quot;Blinky Bill Grows Up&quot;, and &quot;Blinky Bill and Nutsy&quot;. The books are considered quintessential Australian children&#x27;s classics, and have never been out of print in Australia.

==Themes and writing style==
While telling the adventures of Blinky Bill, a cheeky little boy in the form of a koala, the stories also present messages of conservation. Blinky Bill is known for his mischievousness and his love for his mother. His friends include his supposed girlfriend Nutsy, his kangaroo friend Splodge, and his mentor Mr. Wombat, or &#x27;Wombo&#x27;, as Blinky prefers to call him. In general, throughout the stories, he does things that are realistic for koalas as well as things that child readers would like to do. Wall tells the stories directly to the children and Blinky often interacts with the readers in an introduction. Her dedications are often to &#x27;All the Kind Children&#x27;, with her own son Peter and other common Australian names of the 1930s appearing. The books are also fully illustrated by Dorothy Wall herself.

==History==
The first book, &quot;Blinky Bill: The Quaint Little Australian&quot;, was published in 1933 by Angus &amp; Robertson and was based on stories told to her only child, Peter. The book is 69 pages long, with 15 pages of illustrations. The second book, &quot;Blinky Bill Grows Up&quot;, was published in 1934 and is 82 pages long with 16 pages of illustrations. The third book, &quot;Blinky Bill and Nutsy: Two Little Australians&quot;, was published in 1937 and is 115 pages long. &quot;The Complete Adventures of Blinky Bill&quot;, first published in 1939, was reprinted 26 times between 1940 and 1965.
Wall drew Blinky Bill comic strips, most notably one in 1937 called &quot;Blinky Bill&#x27;s Escapades&quot;, which told of the adventures of Blinky, Nutsy and Splodge as they left Australia for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. Angus &amp; Robertson made plates of four strips to entice publishers, but, after considerable procrastination, the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; turned it down. She persisted with the &quot;Herald&quot; for years along with the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;. Wall also drew some full-page strips, in full colour, of Blinky Bill, Splodge and friends in the army, called &quot;Our Squad&quot;. Largely because of the cost and rarity of paper during the war, none was ever published.

In 1940, Wall decided her priority was a new Blinky Bill book with Angus &amp; Robertson. In a letter to her publisher, she wrote: &quot;I&#x27;ll have to do my utmost to get a new Blinky book out for next Christmas. I could do a good story with Blinky on National Service, providing the war continues – but I am not that wicked to wish such a thing&quot;. In February she sent her publisher the completed text for &quot;Blinky Bill Joins the Army&quot;. The publisher was unimpressed by her story of Blinky as an enlisted soldier, calling it &#x27;heavy going&#x27; and a too obvious exploitation of &#x27;patriotic fervour&#x27;. Wall apparently tore up the manuscript and wrote an entirely new version where Blinky remains in his familiar bush setting until the final pages then goes off to join the army – as a mascot. The new version was finished by the end of April, less than a month after the first had been rejected; it was published for Christmas 1940.

In December 1942 the &quot;Blinky Bill&#x27;s Dress-Up Book&quot; was published by Offset Printing Company, which was released after Wall&#x27;s death, in January the same year. This was followed in 1947 by &quot;Blinky Bill&#x27;s ABC Book&quot; and &quot;A Tiny Story of Blinky Bill&quot;, also published by Offset. In 1971, Angus &amp; Robertson published &quot;Blinky Bill and the Rabbit&#x27;s Birthday Party&quot;, based on Dorothy Wall&#x27;s &quot;Complete Adventures of Blinky Bill&quot;, which was adapted by Carol Odell and illustrated by Walter Stackpool. In 1977 Angus &amp; Robertson published the &quot;Blinky Bill Cookbook&quot;, a series of recipes for children to make for themselves by Mary Coleman, which included Wall&#x27;s original illustrations redrawn by Trevor Hood.

==Adaptations and cultural references==
Blinky Bill has been adapted for television and cinema. The first television series, titled &quot;The New Adventures of Blinky Bill&quot;, aired in the 1980s on ABC TV and combined live-action actors with puppetry for the animal characters. The franchise was also made into an animated film, &quot;Blinky Bill: The Mischievous Koala&quot;, released by Yoram Gross Films Studio in 1992. The following year, a second television series was aired, &quot;The Adventures of Blinky Bill&quot;. This was also produced by Yoram Gross, with the series acting as a sequel to their film, and ran for three seasons, with the first two airing on ABC in 1993 and 1995 respectively, and the third originally airing on Seven Network in 2004, before being rerun on ABC along with the first two seasons in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The Yoram Gross series is by far the most well-known incarnation of the franchise, both in its native Australia, and internationally.

A CGI film based on the series, &quot;Blinky Bill the Movie&quot;, was released in 2015, produced as a coproduction between Screen Australia, Flying Bark Productions (being a rebranded Yoram Gross), Assemblage Entertainment and Studio 100 Animation, and featured an all-star cast, including Ryan Kwanten, Robin McLeavy, Richard Roxburgh, Deborah Mailman, Barry Otto, Rufus Sewell, Toni Collette, David Wenham and Barry Humphries. While the reboot film received mixed reviews from critics, it was lambasted by fans of both the original books and the Yoram Gross series from the 1990s and early 2000s, with particular criticism given to the redesigns of the characters, a lack of familiar characters from the original animated series despite introducing new ones, and apparent disrespect to both the original books and the Yoram Gross series as a whole. Despite this, the film was financially successful enough to gain a follow-up TV series of its own, &quot;The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill&quot;, that began airing in 2016 on Seven Network, and ran for one season. 

&quot;Blinky Bill&quot; is also the nickname of the light at the top of Sydney Harbour Bridge.

In 1985, a postage stamp honouring both Blinky and Dorothy Wall herself was issued by Australia Post as part of a set of five commemorating children&#x27;s books. .

In 1986, Australian singer John Williamson released a single titled &quot;Goodbye Blinky Bill&quot;, in order to raise awareness of decline in koala numbers in Australia.

In 1993, the same year that the Yoram Gross series debuted, the Australian republican movement used the character as a symbol in the referendum the following year.

==Reception==
Blinky Bill received critical acclaim, and has become a national icon for Australia. Both the books and TV series are recognised internationally and regarded as children&#x27;s classics.

<doc id="1200436" wikidata="Q2002703" url="?curid=1200436" title="University of Tabriz">
<text>The University of Tabriz (, &quot;Dāneshgāh-e Tabriz&quot;) is a public university located in Tabriz, East Azerbaijan, with the fundamental aim of creating a center of excellence in higher education and research. It is one of the top five high-ranked universities in Iran and one of the ten most selective universities in the country. The University of Tabriz is the second-oldest university in Iran after the University of Tehran, and has the second largest campus area in the country which is the biggest academic institution in northwest of the country. The university is also a member of the Caucasus University Association.

Today, Funding for the University of Tabriz is provided by the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology. Admission to the university for Iranian applicants is through national entrance examination which is administered annually by the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology and for international applicants through some exclusive regulations.

==History==

The history of the higher education in Tabriz, well known for being a cradle of civilization for centuries, goes back to 720 years ago when the Rab&#x27; l-Rashidi international complex was founded. Inheriting this background, the University of Tabriz, founded in 1947, is the second oldest university in Iran. The university started its activities under the name of the University of Azarabadegan with Faculties of Medicine, Agriculture, and Pedagogy in 1946, after legislation of the Establishment of the Universities in the Cities act by the National Parliament of Iran. The University of Azarabadegan was renamed as the University of Tabriz following the 1979 Islamic Revolution. In 1985 and following the approval of Islamic parliament all the faculties and centers affiliated to medical sciences in Iran were separated and started their work independently under the title of medical universities. Thereafter, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences was separated from the University of Tabriz and continued its activities under the supervision of the ministry of health and medical education.

==Academic profile==
It is now educating more than 24,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students, with over 800 academic staff of whom about 750 are Ph.D. holders. Out of this teaching staff, 195 are full professors, 315 are associate professors, 270 are assistant professors and the remaining are instructors. A body of over 1,000 personnel is supporting academic activities. Today, the university provides both undergraduate and graduate programs in 22 main departments. The student body consists of about 14,000 undergraduate students and 7,000 graduate students from all over the country.

===University entrance exam===

Undergraduate admission to the University of Tabriz is limited to the top 3 percent of students who pass the national entrance examination administered annually by the Iranian Ministry of Science, Research, and Technology. For some competitive fields, it has to be between 1 percent. The participants of this exam must answer the questions of physics, mathematics and chemistry well in order to get admission. The master and doctorate exams are similar and the participants answer the specialized questions of their fields.

===Reputation===

<doc id="1200443" wikidata="Q6303716" url="?curid=1200443" title="Judith Troeth">
<text>Judith Mary Troeth AM (; born 3 August 1940) is a former Australian politician. She was a Senator for Victoria from 1993 to 2011, representing the Liberal Party. She served as a parliamentary secretary in the Howard government from 1997 to 2004. Prior to entering politics she was a schoolteacher and farmer.

==Early life==
Troeth was born on 3 August 1940 in Brighton, Victoria. She is the daughter of Eileen Mary and Keith Malcolm Ralston.

Troeth was educated at Methodist Ladies&#x27; College, Melbourne. She later completed the degree of Bachelor of Arts at the University of Melbourne, as well as a diploma in education. She worked as a schoolteacher from 1962 to 1965 and from 1980 to 1987, teaching at schools in Portland and Heywood. She farmed cattle and sheep with her husband near Heywood for three decades.

==Politics==
Troeth became an officeholder in the Liberal Party in the early 1980s, serving as president of her local branch and holding various positions on committees within the state branch of the party.

===Senate===
Troeth was elected to the Senate at the 1993 federal election, to a term beginning on 1 July 1993. She established offices in Warrnambool and the Melbourne suburb of Broadmeadows.

In 1994, Troeth was appointed as a shadow parliamentary secretary under opposition leader Alexander Downer, retaining the role following Downer&#x27;s replacement by John Howard in 1995. She also served as chair of the Senate&#x27;s scrutiny of bills committee from 1994 to 1996.

Following the Coalition&#x27;s victory at the 1996 election, Troeth was appointed chair of the foreign affairs, defence and trade legislation committee. She was appointed as a parliamentary secretary in the Howard government in 1997, initially under John Anderson in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. In 1998 she moved to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, working under ministers Mark Vaile and Warren Truss until 2004. She was the first woman to hold a ministerial position within the agriculture portfolio, and also served as chair of the parliamentary Liberal Party&#x27;s regional and rural committee from 1996 to 2002.

In her final term in the Senate, Troeth served as chair of the Senate&#x27;s education, employment and workplace relations committee. She supported the Howard government&#x27;s WorkChoices legislation, although the Australian Labor Party (ALP) minority on the committee issued a dissenting report. In January 2009, Troeth announced she would not be contesting the next election and would retire at the end of her term in June 2011.

===Political positions===
Troeth was regarded as a moderate within the Liberal Party and in 2009 stated the party needed to embrace moderate and progressive views if it were to return to government. She came into conflict with Peter Costello&#x27;s faction on a number of occasions and faced preselection challenges prior to the 1998 and 2004 elections. In 2007 she stated that a cult of personality had developed around Costello within the Victorian branch of the Liberals.

Troeth supported &quot;free and unfettered access&quot; to abortion. In 2006 she was part of a bipartisan working group which succeeding in passing a private member&#x27;s bill removing the power of the health minister to veto importation of the abortifacient RU-486, thereby increasing the accessibility of abortion.

Troeth was &quot;a vocal advocate for the humane treatment of refugees and asylum seekers&quot;, although she also spoke of &quot;the necessity for strong border protection&quot;. In 2006, she played a key role in defeating the Howard government&#x27;s plan to mandate offshore processing for all asylum seekers arriving by vote, with Howard ultimately withdrawing the legislation after Troeth stated she could not support its passage. In 2009, she was the only Liberal senator to cross the floor to vote in favour of ending the practice of charging immigration detainees for their time in detention, stating &quot;these punitive sort of charges and the putting up of these barriers should never be happening and I will be proud to be in a legislature that legislates to take this law off the statute books&quot;.

Troeth supported Malcolm Turnbull against Tony Abbott in the November 2009 leadership spill and Turnbull&#x27;s stance in favour of the Rudd government&#x27;s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Following Abbott&#x27;s victory over Turnbull, the Liberal Party reversed its position and decided to oppose the scheme. Troeth and fellow Liberal senator Sue Boyce subsequently crossed the floor to vote in favour of the scheme in December 2009.

==Later activities==
In 2012, Troeth was appointed chair of the board of Austin Health, which runs Melbourne&#x27;s Austin Hospital. In the same year, she unsuccessfully sought election to the board of Methodist Ladies&#x27; College, after publicly criticising the existing board for its dismissal of the incumbent school principal.

Troeth remained involved in the Liberal Party after leaving parliament and has advocated for the introduction of quotas for female candidates.

<doc id="1200465" wikidata="Q1671731" url="?curid=1200465" title="Inverse agonist">
<text>In pharmacology, an inverse agonist is a drug that binds to the same receptor as an agonist but induces a pharmacological response opposite to that of the agonist.

A neutral antagonist has no activity in the absence of an agonist or inverse agonist but can block the activity of either; they are in fact sometimes called &quot;blockers&quot; (examples include alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers). Inverse agonists have opposite actions to those of agonists but the effects of both of these can be blocked by antagonists.

A prerequisite for an inverse agonist response is that the receptor must have a constitutive (also known as intrinsic or basal) level of activity in the absence of any ligand. An agonist increases the activity of a receptor above its basal level, whereas an inverse agonist decreases the activity below the basal level.

The efficacy of a full agonist is by definition 100%, a neutral antagonist has 0% efficacy, and an inverse agonist has &lt; 0% (i.e., negative) efficacy.

==Examples==
Receptors for which inverse agonists have been identified include the GABAA, melanocortin, mu opioid, histamine and beta adrenergic receptors. Both endogenous and exogenous inverse agonists have been identified, as have drugs at ligand gated ion channels and at G protein-coupled receptors.

=== Ligand gated ion channel inverse agonists ===
An example of a receptor site that possesses basal activity and for which inverse agonists have been identified is the GABAA receptors. Agonists for GABAA receptors (such as muscimol) create a relaxant effect, whereas inverse agonists have agitation effects (for example, Ro15-4513) or even convulsive and anxiogenic effects (certain beta-carbolines).

=== G protein-coupled receptor inverse agonists ===

Two known endogenous inverse agonists are the Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and its associated peptide Agouti signalling peptide (ASIP). AgRP and ASIP appear naturally in humans and bind melanocortin receptors 4 and 1 (Mc4R and Mc1R), respectively, with nanomolar affinities.
The opioid antagonists naloxone and naltrexone act as neutral antagonists of the mu opioid receptors under basal conditions, but as inverse agonists when an opioid such as morphine is bound to the same channel. 6α-naltrexo, 6β-naltrexol, 6β-naloxol, and 6β-naltrexamine acted neutral antagonists regardless of opioid binding and caused significantly reduced withdrawal jumping when compared to naloxone and naltrexone.

Nearly all antihistamines acting at H1 receptors and H2 receptors have been shown to be inverse agonists.

The beta blockers carvedilol and bucindolol have been shown to be low level inverse agonists at beta adrenoceptors.

== Mechanisms of action ==

Like agonists, inverse agonists have their own unique ways of inducing pharmacological and physiological responses depending on many factors, such as the type of inverse agonist, the type of receptor, mutants of receptors, binding affinities and whether the effects are exerted acutely or chronically based on receptor population density. Because of this, they exhibit a spectrum of activity below the Intrinsic activity level. Changes in constitutive activity of receptors affect response levels from ligands like inverse agonists.

To illustrate, mechanistic models have been made for how inverse agonists induce their responses on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Many types of Inverse agonists for GPCRs have been shown to exhibit the following conventionally accepted mechanism.

Based on the Extended Ternary complex model, the mechanism contends that inverse agonists switch the receptor from an active state to an inactive state by undergoing conformational changes. Under this model, current thinking is that the GPCRs can exist in a continuum of active and inactive states when no ligand is present. Inverse agonists stabilize the inactive states, thereby suppressing agonist-independent activity. However, the implementation of &#x27;constitutively active mutants&#x27; of GPCRs change their intrinsic activity. Thus, the effect an inverse agonist has on a receptor depends on the basal activity of the receptor, assuming the inverse agonist has the same binding affinity (as shown in the figure 2).

<text>Lake Wairarapa is a lake at the southern end of the North Island of New Zealand, east of Wellington. The lake covers an area of , and at its deepest is . It is the third largest in the North Island, fractionally smaller than Lake Rotorua. The nearest town to the lake is Featherston, which is located five kilometres from its northern shore.

The lake forms part of the Wairarapa Moana Wetlands, a regional park administered by Wellington Regional Council, in collaboration with Kahungunu ki Wairarapa, the Department of Conservation, South Wairarapa District Council, and Rangitāne o Wairarapa. The wetland is the largest in the lower North Island, one of the largest in New Zealand, and was recognised as a wetland of international significance under the Ramsar Convention in August 2020.

==Geography==

The lake&#x27;s catchment area is large, and includes the eastern slopes of the Remutaka and Tararua Ranges. The lake takes water from several rivers and was originally the main outflow for the Ruamahanga. This in turn drained slowly into Palliser Bay and Cook Strait ten kilometres south near the settlement of Lake Ferry, via what is now Lake Ōnoke. The river, however, was diverted in the 1960s to assist flow, thereby reducing flooding for farmers. The lake today therefore covers an area significantly smaller than its historical size of around .

The area around the lake is low-lying and swampy, and recent efforts have been made to preserve its important wetland features and restore wildlife habitat that has been degraded through human use. Agriculture and river development, flood control, and waterway diversions have resulted in the drainage of large areas of the wetlands, reducing their ecological values.

Lake Wairarapa is classed as supertrophic on the trophic level index, meaning that it is highly polluted with nitrates which leach from intensified agriculture surrounding the lake. This is in line with the wider trend of agriculture polluting New Zealand rivers and lakes.

==History==

The name &quot;Wairarapa&quot; means &quot;glistening waters&quot; in te reo Māori. According to some oral histories, the Polynesian explorer Kupe named the wetlands after touching down in the area several times. According to other oral histories, explorer Haunui named the wetlands after the way the lake appeared to glisten from the Remutaka Ranges to the west.

The lake has long been used by Māori as a source of readily available food, and many species of waterfowl and fish uncommon elsewhere in New Zealand can be found in or around the lake.

<text>The were branches of the Japanese imperial family (皇族 &quot;Kōka&quot;) created from branches of the Fushimi-no-miya house, the last surviving &quot;Shinnōke&quot; cadet branch. All but two (the Kan&#x27;in-no-miya and Nashimoto-no-miya) of these ōke (王家 &quot;Royal Houses&quot;) were formed by the descendants of Prince Fushimi Kuniie. The &quot;ōke&quot; were stripped of their membership in the imperial family by the American Occupation Authorities in October 1947, as part of the abolition of 11 collateral branches (imperial houses) with 51 members. After that point, only the immediate family of Emperor Shōwa and those of his three brothers retained membership in the imperial family. However, unofficial heads of these collateral families still exist for most and are listed herein.

In recent years, as a solution to the Japanese succession controversy, conservatives have proposed to reinstate several of the former imperial branches or else to allow the imperial family to adopt male members of the former imperial princely houses.

== List of &quot;ōke&quot; ==
The member houses until 1947 were, in order of founding:

* Fushimi (伏見)
* Kan&#x27;in (閑院) - extinct in 1988
* Yamashina (山階) - extinct in 1987
* Kitashirakawa (北白川) - extinct in 2018
* Nashimoto (梨本) - extinct in 1951
* Kuni (久邇) 
* Kaya (賀陽)
* Higashifushimi or Komatsu (東伏見 / 小松) - extinct in 1922
* Asaka (朝香)
* Higashikuni (東久邇)
* Takeda (竹田)

Unless otherwise stated, all princes listed herein are the sons of their predecessor.

=== Fushimi-no-miya ===

The Fushimi-no-miya house was formed in 1409 by Prince Yoshihito.

The Fushimi-no-miya house is the ancestor of all the kyū-miyake families except Kan&#x27;in-no-miya.

=== Kan&#x27;in-no-miya ===

The Kan&#x27;in-no-miya house was formed in 1718 by Prince Naohito.

=== Nashimoto-no-miya ===
The Nashimoto-no-miya house was formed by Prince Moriosa, son of Prince Fushimi Sadayoshi (father of Prince Fushimi Kuniye)

=== Kuni-no-miya ===

The Kuni-no-miya house was formed by Prince Asahiko, fourth son of Prince Fushimi Kuniye

=== Yamashina-no-miya ===

The Yamashina-no-miya house was formed by Prince Akira, eldest son of Prince Fushimi Kuniye.

The Yamashina-no-miya became extinct with the death of Yamashina Takehiko.

=== Kitashirakawa-no-miya ===

The Kitashirakawa-no-miya house was formed by Prince Satonari, thirteenth son of Prince Fushimi Kuniye.

The Kitashirakawa-no-miya became extinct with the death of Kitashirakawa Michihisa without heirs on 20 October 2018.

=== Higashifushimi-no-miya / Komatsu-no-miya ===

The Higashifushimi-no-miya or the Komatsu-no-miya house was formed by Prince Yoshiaki, seventh son of Prince Fushimi Kuniye.

In 1931, Emperor Shōwa directed his brother-in-law, Prince Kuni Kunihide, to leave Imperial Family status and become Count Higashifushimi Kunihide (&quot;hakushaku&quot; under the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system), to prevent the Higashifushimi name from extinction. Dowager Princess Higashifushimi Kaneko became a commoner on 14 October 1947. She died in Tokyo in 1955.

=== Kaya-no-miya ===

The Kaya-no-miya house was formed by Prince Kuninori, second son of Prince Kuni Asahiko (first Kuni-no-miya, see above)

=== Asaka-no-miya ===

The Asaka-no-miya house was formed by Prince Yasuhiko, eighth son of Prince Kuni Asahiko.

=== Higashikuni-no-miya ===

The Higashikuni-no-miya house was formed by Prince Naruhiko, ninth son of Prince Kuni Asahiko.

Prince Higashikuni Nobuhiko became simply &quot;Higashikuni Nobuhiko&quot; after the abolition of the Japanese aristocracy during the American occupation of Japan in 1947.

=== Takeda-no-miya ===

The Takeda-no-miya house was formed by Prince Tsunehisa, eldest son of Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa (second Kitashirakawa-no-miya).

== Proposal for reinstatement ==

In January 2005, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi set up a panel consisting of 10 experts from various fields to discuss the succession law and possible ways to ensure stable succession in the imperial family. At that point, no male heir had been born to the Imperial family in 40 years, prompting concerns that there wouldn&#x27;t be anyone to succeed Crown Prince Naruhito after he became emperor. The panel recommended giving eligibility to females and their descendants, that the first child, regardless of sex, be given priority in ascension, and that female family members who marry commoners be allowed to retain their imperial family member status. Itsuo Sonobe, deputy chairman of the 10-member government panel and a former Supreme Court justice, said that one of the panel&#x27;s main concerns had been to find a solution that would win the people&#x27;s support.

Media opinion polls showed an overwhelming majority favoring the change, but the proposed revision was met with fierce opposition from conservatives, who held that the imperial dynasty, which had survived in an unbroken line stretching for nearly 2700 years, could not be dismissed and ended by a wave of deracinated modernity and uncaring recentism. They proposed instead that the government take recourse to ancient traditions under which such situations had been handled in the past. They pointed out that various branches of the old imperial family do still exist in Japan, and that the constitutional definition of the &quot;imperial family&quot; which prevails today was imposed by the occupying western forces as recently as 1947. They maintained that, rather than ending the ancient imperial dynasty, it would be more sensible and less radical to end the recent, western-imposed restrictions. , a member of the former Takeda-no-miya collateral house (nephew of the current family head and son of Tsunekazu Takeda) and author of a book entitled &quot;The Untold Truth of Imperial Family Members&quot;, proposed to maintain the male line by restoring the former princely houses or by allowing imperial family members to adopt males from those families. Although Takeda has written that such men should feel a responsibility to maintain the royal house, he said he would find it daunting if asked to play that role himself. According to Takeda, the heads of the former court families agreed in late 2004, just before Koizumi&#x27;s advisory panel started its discussions, not to speak out on the issue and some of them told him to &quot;not get involved in political issues&quot;. Opponents of the reinstatement of former collateral branches, like Liberal Democratic Party politician Yōichi Masuzoe, argued that it would favor members of families with tenuous blood links to long-ago emperors over contemporary female descendants of recent sovereigns.

During a series of hearings on the succession problem in early 2012, Yoshiko Sakurai and Akira Momochi, conservative members of the panel of experts, rejected proposals for female members of the imperial family to be allowed to retain their royal status after marriage and create new branches of the imperial family, and instead suggested revising the Imperial Household Law so that male descendants of former imperial families which renounced their royal status in 1947 be allowed to return to the imperial family as adoptees. Another proposal was to reinstate four of the former imperial families, a solution opposed by the government on the grounds that it would not enjoy public support. Government sources told the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; in May 2012 that the suggestion to reinstate men from the former princely houses as imperial family members through adoption had been unexpected.

In September 2021, it was considered to amend the Imperial Household Law and allow the 85-year old Prince Hitachi to adopt a male member of the collateral branches of the imperial family.

<text>Bunco (also spelled bunko or bonko or buncko) is a dice game with twelve or more players, divided into groups of four, trying to score points while taking turns rolling three dice in a series of six rounds. A bunco is achieved when a person rolls three-of-a-kind and all three numbers match the round number which is decided at the beginning of the round.

==History==
Bunco was originally a confidence game similar to three-card monte. It originated in 19th-century England, where it was known as &quot;eight dice cloth&quot;. It was imported to San Francisco as a gambling activity in 1855, where it gave its name to gambling parlors, or &quot;bunco parlors&quot;, and more generally to any swindle. After the Civil War, the game evolved into a popular parlor game. During the 1920s and Prohibition, bunco was re-popularized as a gambling game, often associated with speakeasies. Law-enforcement groups raiding these parlors came to be known as &quot;&quot;. Bunco saw a resurgence in popularity as a family game in the 1980s.

According to the World Bunco Association, the game saw a resurgence in popularity in the United States in the early 21st century; in 2006, it was claimed that during the previous year &quot;over 59 million women have played bunco and over 27 million play regularly&quot;. Members of bunco clubs often take turns hosting, providing snacks, refreshments and the tables to set up the games. Small amounts of money can be involved as well. Bunco is sometimes referred to as the &quot;housewife&#x27;s drinking game&quot;.

==Rules==
Each game consists of six rounds, numbered one to six in the order played. Players take turns rolling three dice. One point is awarded for each die rolled that matches the current round number, 5 points are awarded if all three dice match each other, but do not match the current round number, and 21 points if all three dice match the current round number (a &quot;bunco&quot;). If any points are scored, the player gets to roll again, continuing to add to their score. If no points are awarded, the player&#x27;s turn ends and the dice are passed to the next player at the table. Each round ends when a player has scored 21 points, which makes rolling a bunco an instant win. The game ends when all six rounds are complete. The player with the most rounds won is the overall game winner, with ties typically broken by comparing total points scored.

In larger-scale tournaments, the game will typically be played in teams of two, and multiple tables will play simultaneously, with the highest-ranked table known as the &quot;head table&quot; or &quot;queen&#x27;s table&quot;. After each round, the winning team at a table will move to the next-highest-ranked table while the loser at the head table will move down to the lowest-ranked table.

==World championship==
The first bunco World Championship was held in 2006; it was broadcast on the Oxygen Network and sponsored by Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s (P&amp;G) anti-heartburn medicine Prilosec OTC, benefiting the National Breast Cancer Foundation. In October 2008, P&amp;G discontinued its association with the Championship after three years.

<doc id="1200496" wikidata="Q16106114" url="?curid=1200496" title="Kathy Sullivan (Australian politician)">
<text>Kathryn Jean Martin Sullivan AM (born 8 March 1942) is an Australian former politician. A member of the Liberal Party, she was a Senator for Queensland from 1974 to 1984 and a member of the House of Representatives from 1984 to 2001, holding the seat of Moncrieff. She broke Dorothy Tangney&#x27;s record for the longest period of service in federal parliament by a woman, which was later surpassed by Bronwyn Bishop. She was the first woman to have served in both houses of parliament.

==Early life==
Sullivan was born Kathryn Jean Martin on 8 March 1942 in Brisbane, Queensland. She was the second of two daughters born to Edna (née Sproul) and Ian Martin. Her mother was a nurse and post office worker and her father was a bank officer. She grew up in country Queensland, attending primary schools in Mount Morgan, Kingaroy, Humpybong, and Camp Hill. Her secondary education was completed at Somerville House in Brisbane. She went on to complete a Bachelor of Arts (Hons.) degree in political science at the University of Queensland.

==Politics==
Martin joined the Young Liberals in 1960 during her first year at university. She served as state secretary in 1961 and vice-president in 1963, and had received life membership by the time she graduated.

===Senate (1974–1984)===
Martin was elected to the Senate at the 1974 federal election, a double dissolution. She was ranked in fifth position on the Liberal Party&#x27;s joint ticket with the Country Party. At the time of her preselection she was asked to use the name &quot;Kathy&quot; rather than her full name as it was &quot;friendlier&quot;, and also &quot;to stop wearing knee-high boots and smoking cigars&quot;.

In April 1975, Martin was chosen as the Liberal Party&#x27;s assistant whip in the Senate. She was &quot;a linchpin in keeping the Opposition senators in line&quot; during the 1975 constitutional crisis, and retained the position after the Coalition won the 1975 federal election. She resigned as assistant whip in February 1977 after crossing the floor with nine other Liberal senators to oppose a procedural motion to expedite the government&#x27;s constitutional amendment bills. Martin subsequently led the &quot;No&quot; campaign in Queensland against the simultaneous elections amendment, which was the only one of four not to pass. Her relationship with Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser deteriorated as a result and &quot;destroyed her prospects for promotion while he remained party leader&quot;.

Prior to the 1983 election, Martin offered to resign her place on the Liberal Senate ticket in favour of Neville Bonner, who had been demoted to the third position. Her offer was rejected and Bonner unsuccessfully stood as an independent. In the last years of the Fraser government she had increasingly aligned herself with opposition to Fraser&#x27;s leadership, supporting Andrew Peacock for the party leadership. Fraser resigned as leader after losing the 1983 election and was replaced by Peacock, who appointed Martin as Shadow Minister for Home Affairs and Administrative Services. She resigned from the Senate in November 1984 to seek a lower-house seat at the upcoming federal election, which followed an expansion in the number of House of Representatives seats. After her marriage the previous year she was known as Kathy Sullivan or Kathy Martin Sullivan.

In 2021, Sullivan stated that a male colleague sexually assaulted her in her office in about 1983 or 1984. She said that the party&#x27;s leader Andrew Peacock &quot;clearly didn&#x27;t believe&quot; her account of the incident when she informed him, and that it was &quot;one of the most devastating experiences of my life&quot;.
Sullivan made this allegation publicly known on 9 July 2021, almost three months after Peacock&#x27;s death on 16 April.

===House of Representatives (1984–2001)===
At the 1984 election, Sullivan won the newly created Division of Moncrieff for the Liberal Party. She was the first woman to serve in both houses of federal parliament. She was also the first female Coalition MP to serve in the House since Kay Brownbill in 1969.

Sullivan was not retained in Andrew Peacock&#x27;s shadow ministry after the 1984 election. She returned as a shadow parliamentary secretary in 1993 under John Hewson, holding the position until Hewson lost the leadership the following year. In the same year she received national attention when ALP Treasurer John Dawkins taunted her by calling her &quot;sweetheart&quot; in parliament, which outraged female MPs from Dawkins&#x27; own party. She returned to her former position as a deputy whip later in 1994, holding the position until the 1996 election. Sullivan hoped to become Speaker of the House of Representatives when the Coalition won the 1996 federal election, but was defeated by Bob Halverson in an internal ballot. She was instead elected to the speaker&#x27;s panel. Following a ministerial reshuffle, Sullivan was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in October 1997. She held the position until February 2000 when she announced her decision not to re-contest her seat at the 2001 federal election.

She has been a vocal advocate for an increase in the number of women in parliament.

==Recognition ==
In 2003, Sullivan was made a Member of the Order of Australia, for service to the Parliament of Australia and to the community, particularly as an advocate for improved services and conditions affecting women.

According to a study by the Parliamentary Library, Sullivan crossed the floor 20 times during her career, the most out of any woman during the period from 1950 to 2019. Each of those occasions occurred during her service in the Senate.

==Personal life==
From 1965 to 1969 Sullivan was married to Donald Maher. In 1972, he was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a Brisbane hotel manager; he was released in 1987.

Sullivan re-married in 1975 to Jim Gray, continuing to use her maiden name in parliament. They divorced in 1978 and in 1983 she married Bob Sullivan, a former U.S. Marine. She was widowed in 2008.

After the conclusion of her political career, Sullivan has used the name &quot;Kate&quot; rather than &quot;Kathy&quot;.

<doc id="1200499" wikidata="Q1363803" url="?curid=1200499" title="Juan Cole">
<text>John Ricardo Irfan &quot;Juan&quot; Cole (born October 23, 1952) is an American academic and commentator on the modern Middle East and South Asia. He is Richard P. Mitchell Collegiate Professor of History at the University of Michigan. Since 2002, he has written a weblog, &quot;Informed Comment&quot; (&quot;juancole.com&quot;).

== Background ==
Cole was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico. His father served in the United States Army Signal Corps. When Cole was age two, his family left New Mexico for France. His father completed two tours with the U.S. military in France (a total of seven years) and one 18-month stay at Kagnew Station in Asmara, Eritrea (then Ethiopia). Cole was schooled at twelve schools in twelve years, at a series of dependent schools on military bases but also sometimes in civilian schools. Some schooling occurred in the United States, particularly in North Carolina and California.

===Baháʼí studies===
Cole converted to the Baháʼí Faith in 1972 and spent 25 years writing and travelling in support of the religion. He had several works published through Baháʼí publishers and co-edited an online journal (&quot;Occasional Papers in the Shaykhi, Babi, and Baha&#x27;i Religions&quot;). Some of these were unofficial translations, and two volumes by/about early Baháʼí theologian Mírzá Abu&#x27;l-Fadl.

In 1994 Cole participated in a discussion group that became a forum for dissent among Baháʼí academics against the Baháʼí administration. Cole was perceived as leading a dissident faction, and resigned his membership in 1996 after being confronted by Baháʼí leadership. He declared himself a Unitarian Universalist. Soon after his resignation, Cole created an email list and website called H-Bahai, which became a repository of both primary source material and critical analysis on the religion. Cole went on to critically attack the Baháʼí Faith in several books and articles written from 1998–2002, describing a prominent Baháʼí as &quot;inquisitor&quot; and &quot;bigot&quot;, and accusing Baháʼí institutions of cult-like tendencies.

=== Appointments and awards ===
Cole was awarded Fulbright-Hays fellowships to India (1982) and to Egypt (1985–1986). In 1991 he held a National Endowment for the Humanities grant for the study of Shia Islam in Iran. From 1999 until 2004, Juan Cole was the editor of &quot;The International Journal of Middle East Studies&quot;. He has served in professional offices for the American Institute of Iranian Studies and on the editorial board of the journal &quot;Iranian Studies&quot;. He is a member of the Middle East Studies Association of North America, and served as the organization&#x27;s president for 2006. In 2006, he received the James Aronson Award for Social Justice Journalism administered by Hunter College. He is a member of the Community Council of the National Iranian American Council (NIAC).

==Notable work==

Cole founded the Global Americana Institute to translate works concerning the United States into Arabic. The first volume was selected works of Thomas Jefferson, and the second was a translation of a biography of Martin Luther King Jr. along with selected speeches and writings.

===Current affairs history===
After September 11, 2001, Cole turned increasingly to writing on radical Muslim movements, the Iraq War, United States foreign policy, and the Iran crisis. He calls his work not &quot;contemporary history&quot; but &quot;current affairs history&quot;. 

Cole testified on Iraq before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in 2004.

===&quot;Informed Comment&quot; blog===
Since 2002, Cole has published the blog &quot;Informed Comment&quot;, covering &quot;History, Middle East, South Asia, Religious Studies, and the War on Terror&quot;. Cole&#x27;s prominence quickly rose through his blog, and &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; commented in 2004, &quot;Cole&#x27;s transformation into a public intellectual embodies many of the dynamics that have heightened the impact of the blogosphere. He wanted to publicize his expertise, and he did so by attracting attention from elite members of the blogosphere. As Cole made waves within the virtual world, others in the real world began to take notice&quot;.

In 2006 National Journal called Cole &quot;the most respected voice on foreign policy on the left&quot; and his blog ranked the 99th most popular in 2009, but it has since fallen off the list.

==Views==
Leading up to the 2008 United States presidential election, Cole chastised several candidates, including Hillary Clinton, Rudy Giuliani, and Mitt Romney, for making bellicose statements about Iran in order to present themselves in a tougher or more conservative light. 

In 2002, Cole rejected the Bush administration&#x27;s early claims of Iraqi cooperation with Al-Qaeda, commenting that Saddam Hussein had &quot;persecuted and killed both Sunni and Shiite fundamentalists in great number&quot;, as well as claims to the effect that Ba&#x27;athist Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction. Rather than making America safer, he says, the war has ironically had the opposite effect: inspiring anti-U.S. militants.

In 2004, Cole pointed out that he was against boycotting Israeli professors: &quot;I have stood with Israeli colleagues and against any attempt to marginalize them or boycott them&quot;.

In a 2005 speech at the Middle East Policy Council, Cole was critical of the U.S. allying itself with offshoots of the Islamic Dawa Party in the Iraq War but vehemently opposing Hezbollah in Lebanon.

According to Efraim Karsh, Cole has done &quot;hardly any independent research on the twentieth-century Middle East&quot;, and characterized Cole&#x27;s analysis of this era as &quot;derivative&quot;. He has also responded to Cole&#x27;s criticism of Israeli policies and the influence of the &quot;Israel lobby&quot;, comparing them to accusations that have been made in anti-semitic writings. Cole replied directly to Karsh in his blog. 

Jeremy Sapienza of &quot;Antiwar.com&quot; has criticized Cole for what he deems as partisan bias on issues of war and peace, citing his support for wars supported by the U.S. Democratic Party as the Yugoslav Wars and the 2011 military intervention in Libya, while opposing wars supported by the U.S. Republican Party such as the wars in Iraq.

===Ahmadinejad&#x27;s remarks on Israel===
Cole and Christopher Hitchens traded barbs regarding the translation and meaning of a passage referring to Israel in a speech by Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Fathi Nazila of &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s Tehran bureau translated the passage as &quot;Our dear Imam Khomeini] said that the occupying regime must be wiped off the map.&quot;

In an article published at the &quot;Slate&quot; website, Hitchens accused Cole of attempting to minimize and distort the meaning of the speech, which Hitchens understood to be a repetition of &quot;the standard line&quot; that &quot;the state of Israel is illegitimate and must be obliterated.&quot; Hitchens also denigrated Cole&#x27;s competence in both Persian and &quot;plain English&quot; and described him as a Muslim apologist.

Cole responded that while he personally despised &quot;everything Ahmadinejad stands for, not to mention the odious Khomeini&quot;, he nonetheless objected to the &quot;New York Times&quot; translation. Cole wrote that it inaccurately suggested Ahmadinejad was advocating an invasion of Israel (&quot;that he wants to play Hitler to Israel&#x27;s Poland&quot;). He added that a better translation of the phrase would be &quot;the occupation regime over Jerusalem should vanish from the page of time,&quot; a metaphysical if not poetic reference rather than a militaristic one. He also stated that Hitchens was incompetent to assess a Persian-to-English translation, and accused him of unethically accessing private Cole e-mails from an on-line discussion group.

==CIA harassment allegations==
In 2011, James Risen reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Glenn Carle, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer who was a top counterterrorism official during the administration of President George W. Bush, &quot;said the White House at least twice asked intelligence officials to gather sensitive information&quot; on Cole &quot;in order to discredit him&quot;. &quot;In an interview, Mr. Carle said his supervisor at the National Intelligence Council told him in 2005 that White House officials wanted &#x27;to get&#x27; Professor Cole, and made clear that he wanted Mr. Carle to collect information about him, an effort Mr. Carle rebuffed. Months later, Mr. Carle said, he confronted a CIA official after learning of another attempt to collect information about Professor Cole. Mr. Carle said he contended at the time that such actions would have been unlawful.&quot;

== Lack of Yale appointment ==
In 2006, Cole was nominated to teach at Yale University and was approved by both Yale&#x27;s sociology and history departments. A

Yale historian Paula Hyman commented that the deep divisions in the appointment committee were the primary reasons that Cole was rejected: &quot;There was also concern, aside from the process, about the nature of his blog and what it would be like to have a very divisive colleague.&quot; Yale political science professor Steven B. Smith commented, &quot;It would be very comforting for Cole&#x27;s supporters to think that this got steamrolled because of his controversial blog opinions. The blog opened people&#x27;s eyes as to what was going on.&quot; Another Yale historian, John M. Merriman, said of Cole&#x27;s rejection: &quot;In this case, academic integrity clearly has been trumped by politics.&quot;

In an interview on &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, Cole said that he had not applied for the post at Yale: &quot;Some people at Yale asked if they could look at me for a senior appointment. I said, &#x27;Look all you want.&#x27; So that&#x27;s up to them. Senior professors are like baseball players. You&#x27;re being looked at by other teams all the time. If it doesn&#x27;t result in an offer, then nobody takes it seriously.&quot; He described the so-called &quot;scandal&quot; surrounding his nomination as &quot;a tempest in a teapot&quot; that had been exaggerated by &quot;neo-con journalists&quot;: &quot;Who knows what their hiring process is like, what things they were looking for?&quot;

<text>The Ruamahanga River runs through the southeastern North Island of New Zealand.

The river&#x27;s headwaters are in the Tararua Range northwest of Masterton. From there it runs firstly south and then southwest for before emptying into the Cook Strait. The towns of Masterton and Martinborough are close to the banks of the river. It is joined by many other rivers, including the Tauweru River near Gladstone.

In its lower reaches, the river meanders across a large floodplain, culminating in the wetlands around the edges of Lake Wairarapa. The river once flowed into the lake, but has now been diverted. The river drains at Palliser Bay further south.

The river has now become generally polluted from sewage and farming that prevents people from swimming in the river or its tributaries.

<text>The Central Cross-Island Highway () or Provincial Highway 8 is one of three highway systems that connect the west coast with the east of Taiwan.

==Construction==

The construction of the Central Cross-Island Highway began on July 7, 1956 and was first opened to traffic on May 9, 1960.

==Route==

The route of the highway begins in the west at Dongshi District in Taichung. The highway originally continued up into the Central Mountain Range following the Dajia River valley through the townships of Guguan (谷關) and Qingshan (青山). However, the section between Guguan and Lishan is permanently closed to non-residents due to earthquake and typhoon damage. At Lishan there is a branch that heads north to Yilan City. Passing through the mountains it reaches Dayuling (大禹嶺) which is the highest point of the route. Here another branch of the highway runs south from Dayuling to Puli via Wuling (武嶺). Continuing east from Dayuling the highway route now begins its descent into the Taroko National Park. It passes through Guanyuan (關原), Ci’en (慈恩), Luoshao (洛韶) and before entering Taroko Gorge. After the gorge the route then connects with the eastern coastal Suhua Highway.

==Highway damage and closure==
The highway route runs through exceedingly rugged and unstable terrain. Heavy rain from typhoons often dislodge soil and rocks onto the highway making sections of it impassable. As well, the area is prone to seismic activity which can have disastrous effects on the highway. On September 21, 1999 the Jiji earthquake caused massive damage to the highway and cut the highway in multiple places between Guguan and Lishan.

Following the unprecedented damage to the highway in 1999, there was strong debate on the feasibility and desirability of maintaining and repairing the highway. Extensive and costly repairs proceeded, and earthquake-damaged sections of the highway were due to be re-opened in 2004. However, torrential rains from Typhoon Mindulle caused further damage to the highway, forcing the affected section between Guguan and Lishan to be closed to non-residents indefinitely. While Provincial Highway 8 no longer provides a continuous route across the island, travelers from the west can use Provincial Highway 14 and Provincial Highway 14A to connect with Provincial Highway 8 in the east.

On November 16, 2018, the section between Guguan and Lishan re-opened to limited traffic. 3 medium-sized busses are scheduled to run the route (back and forth) each day but no ordinary private vehicle traffic is allowed.

<doc id="1200509" wikidata="Q1483529" url="?curid=1200509" title="Burl">
<text>A burl (American English) or burr (British English) is a tree growth in which the grain has grown in a deformed manner. It is commonly found in the form of a rounded outgrowth on a tree trunk or branch that is filled with small knots from dormant buds. Burl formation is typically a result of some form of stress such as an injury or a viral or fungal infection. More scientifically, a burl is “the result of hyperplasia, a greatly abnormal proliferation of xylem production by the vascular cambium”.

Burls yield a very peculiar and highly figured wood sought after in woodworking, and some items may reach high prices on the wood market. Poaching of burl specimens and damaging the trees in the process poses a problem in some areas.

==Description==
A burl results from a tree undergoing some form of stress. It may be caused by a virus, fungus or agrobacterium tumefaciens entering the plant through an injury. Most burls grow beneath the ground, attached to the roots as a type of malignancy that is generally not discovered until the tree dies or falls over. Such burls sometimes appear as groups of bulbous protrusions connected by a system of rope-like roots. Almost all burl wood is covered by bark, even if it is underground.

In some tree species, burls can grow to great size. The largest, at , occur in coast redwoods (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;) and can engirdle the entire trunk; when moisture is present, these burls can grow new redwood trees. One of the world&#x27;s largest burls can be found in Port McNeill, British Columbia.

==Use==

Burls yield a very peculiar and highly figured wood, prized for its beauty and rarity. It is sought after by furniture makers, artists, and wood sculptors. There are a number of well-known types of burls (each from a particular species); these are highly valued and sliced into veneers for furniture, inlay in doors, picture frames, household objects, automobile interior paneling and trim, musical instruments, and woodturning.

==Working the Wood==
The prized &quot;&quot; is not a species of a maple, but wood from a maple&#x27;s burl (burr).
The famous birdseye maple of the sugar maple (&quot;Acer saccharum&quot;) superficially resembles burr maple, but it is something else entirely.
Burl wood is very hard to work with hand tools or on a lathe, because its grain is twisted and interlocked, causing it to chip and shatter unpredictably. This &quot;wild grain&quot; makes burl wood extremely dense and resistant to splitting, which made it valued for bowls, mallets, mauls and &quot;beetles&quot; or &quot;beadles&quot; for hammering chisels and driving wooden pegs.

==Poaching==

Because of the value of burls, ancient redwoods in national parks in the Western United States have recently been poached by thieves for their burls, including at Redwood National and State Parks. Poachers often cut off the burls from the sides of the trunks using chainsaws, which exposes the tree to infection and disease, or fell the entire tree to steal burls higher up. Because of the risk of poaching, Jeff Denny, the state park&#x27;s redwood coast sector supervisor, encourages those buying burl to inquire where it came from and to ensure it was obtained legally. Legal acquisition methods for burl include trees from private land cleared for new development and from lumber companies with salvage permits.

<doc id="1200518" wikidata="Q7640157" url="?curid=1200518" title="Sungai Lembing">
<text>Sungai Lembing is a small town in Kuantan District, Pahang, Malaysia. It is about northwest of Kuantan. The town was founded in the 1900s as a tin mining community when the British company Pahang Consolidated Company Limited (PCCL) set up the tin mining industry there after mining activities had begun in 1886. Sungai Lembing had electricity, schools, a cinema, its own petrol station, and a hospital.

In 1926, flooding damaged caused mining activities to be suspended for three months. The Great Depression and the Japanese occupation of Malaya greatly affected the town&#x27;s tin mining industry. Since the independence of Malaya, Sungai Lembing has gone into decline as global demand and prices of tin dropped, resulting in the closure of the mines in 1987. Many residents moved away, causing facilities such as shops and petrol stations to close.

After 2001, Sungai Lembing was revitalized as a heritage tourism attraction with the opening of Sungai Lembing Museum. Subsequent government investment has made this area one of the important tourist attractions in Pahang. In 2014, the town had a population of around 5,000. A large fire in 2019 raised concern for the preservation of historical buildings.

==Etymology==
There are two suggested etymologies of the Malay name (&quot;Spear River&quot;). One suggestion is based on a local legend in which a ruler saw a vision of a spear in the nearby river and named his town after this vision. Another involves an incident in which a group of &quot;Orang Asli&quot; threw a spear over a deer that escaped by jumping over the (&quot;Kenau River&quot;). The town has been nicknamed the &quot;El Dorado of the East&quot; because this area is rich in natural resources.

==History==
===Foundation===
The tin mining area at Sungai Lembing was the largest and deepest of its time in the world; the tunnel spans around and is between and deep. Mining activity in the area was begun in 1886 by British firm Pahang Consolidated Company Limited (PCCL), which were headquartered in London and employed approximately 1,500 miners to mine tin. At its peak, the mine employed 5,000 workers who produced 4,000 tons of tin annually.

The development of the town to support the tin mining industry led to the creation of facilities and amenities such as electricity, housing for workers, schools, shops, a cinema and a hospital. Tin mines in Pahang and neighbouring states were the first places in Malaya to receive electricity. Initially such power was only available for 12 hours each day. Imported products were sold in a duty-free shop. Non-residents were usually not allowed to enter Sungai Lembing without permission and a security checkpoint was set up at the entrance to the town. Some buildings catering to the wealthy prohibited entry to lower class workers.

In 1926, flooding in the area caused damage to of railway track, a hospital and 250 homes, and the mining operation was suspended for three months. Mining was also affected by the Great Depression of the 1920s, during which quotas were imposed on tin production. During the 1942-1945 Japanese occupation of Malaya, mining stocks were hidden and mines were destroyed with flooding by British mine managers to prevent Japanese army from being able to access the tin resources, and European personnel fled the country.

===Post independence and decline===
After the war mining continued, and by the 1960s the town&#x27;s private diesel generator was producing 7 MW, over three times more than that of the public generator in Kuantan, the nearby state capital. In 1979, PCCL transferred ownership of the company from Britain to Malaysia and renamed itself Pahang Consolidated Public Limited Company (PCPLC). As worldwide demand for tin and prices of tin fell, the mine was temporarily shut down in 1986. The closure of mines caused around 800 miners to become unemployed and the company entered receivership after financial losses. No parties were interested in taking over the mining activity and the mine was permanently closed by the Government of Pahang in 1987. After the mine closure, many residents moved elsewhere to seek employment and some facilities such as shops and petrol stations were forced to shut down, although some shops continued to operate. Prior to 2001, the area&#x27;s main industry shifted from mining to agriculture; deforestation caused by this change led to flooding becoming more frequent.

In December 1988, there were proposals to revive the town, then supporting 14,000 residents, and redevelop it into a tourist attraction. One suggestion was to convert the former mining general&#x27;s bungalow into either a resthouse or a museum; the bungalow was converted into the Sungai Lembing Museum. The proposals included plans to convert former workers&#x27; quarters into chalets to mitigate a lack of accommodations for visitors, improve the infrastructure in the town and open a health clinic.

===Revitalization===
The Sungai Lembing Museum was opened in 2001; this led the town to focus on the tourism sector. The museum exhibits the mining history of Sungai Lembing. It is currently managed by the Department of Museum Malaysia.

On 27 March 2004, as part of a national five-year economic plan, the federal government allocated RM 7 million for improving the town; this includes improvement to the museum, which was visited by 193,000 visitors as of 2004, revival of a mining tunnel for tourism purpose, restoration of the cinema and upgrading the road that connects the town to the tin mining area. On 16 April 2005, another RM 6.3 million was allocated to restoring buildings with historic values such as clubhouses, administration buildings, factories and mining tunnels.

Revitalisation funds were allocated to rebuild the town&#x27;s central hawker centre. The 50 year old wooden building was demolished in 2006, and the new building opened on 27 September 2008. An arch was constructed at the entrance to the town on 6 February 2009. In 2012, three bridges were built would allow access from nearby settlements.

On 31 August 2019, a fire burnt several century-old buildings including 20 shophouses, 11 terrace houses and a library. The fire displaced 53 residents and resulted in the death of an elderly couple. The fire prompted the Malaysian Institute of Architects (PAM) to advise officials to upgrade safety measures on historic buildings to preserve them from destruction by fire. Residents claimed that the fire was especially destructive as most of the buildings had been made of wood, and that a lack of water hampered efforts to contain the fire. The town&#x27;s water is supplied from Kuantan and is turned off at night. Four months after the fire, reconstruction of one of the damaged buildings took place with a budget of RM 10 million, with advice from Kyoto University; the money was also used to upgrade existing facilities in Sungai Lembing.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, following the relaxation of the movement control order and the re-opening of border crossings, tourism began to recover to pre-pandemic levels; 80 per cent of stalls in the food court reopened and some hostels in the area were fully booked. Most of the visitors during that time arrived by car rather than the more usual tourist buses. Despite the relaxation of the movement control order, social distancing and other infection control measures continued to be practised, and the mining tunnel and museum remained closed until 16 June 2020.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Sungai Lembing&#x27;s has a tropical rainforest climate, with significant rainfall occurring throughout the year. The average annual temperature is and the average annual rainfall is . Precipitation is lowest in February, with an average of . With an average of , the most precipitation falls in December. At an average temperature of , May is the hottest month of the year. January and December have the lowest average temperature of the year. It is . In measurements taken from 2005 to 2015, between the driest and wettest months the difference in precipitation averages .

===Environmental issues===
Since the 1990s, the frequency and intensity of floods in this area has increased due to changes in land use in the river basin area, especially an increase in agriculture and potentially due to illegal logging. One potential cause is an increase in silt in the rivers as a result of these land use changes The floods in 2012 and 2014 caused the road that connects Sungai Lembing with the rest of Malaysia to be cut off. Waste materials from abandoned mines were found to be polluting the area&#x27;s rivers and groundwater with harmful elements such as arsenic, iron, copper, lead, manganese, nickel and zinc.

Since 2014, much of the rainforest surrounding the popular Rainbow Waterfall has been cleared to make way for a palm oil plantation. Local villagers blamed the pollution of their water catchment area on the logging activity involved. While the link between logging and pollution was denied by the Pahang Forestry Department in May 2018, in December 2018 several fines were issued to the Mentiga Corporation by the Pahang Department of Environment, due to substandard waste disposal practices.

==Tourism==
As of July 2017, locals estimated around 2,000 to 3,000 tourists visited the town on every weekend, and the number peaks during school holidays in both Malaysia and Singapore. In addition to the Sungai Lembing Museum and mining tunnel, the area&#x27;s tourist attractions include a museum dedicated to crystals, a hot spring, Panorama Hill, and Rainbow Waterfall. Places of worship include Gua Charas, where Buddhist and Hindu temples were located inside a cave.

==In popular culture== 
* A Malaysian-Singaporean co-produced drama, &quot;Kampong Ties&quot; is set in Sungai Lembing during 1960s and 1970s.

<text>The Caballerial was originally a skateboarding trick performed in a half pipe, but has now been adopted in styles other than vert, and is also performed in BMX. The original trick is a fakie backside 360 ollie, or in BMX, a fakie 360. The Caballerial can also be done frontside (Frontside Cab etc.) The Caballerial was named after professional skateboarder Steve Caballero, who invented the trick in 1981, originally doing the trick backside. With input from Caballero and the skateboard community as a whole, this trick is a skateboard and snowboard only trick. It shall be known in the BMX community as a backwards 180/360 from now on. 

The Half-cab is a variation of the Caballerial where the rider only rotates 180 degrees rather than the full 360. This trick can be learned before the regular 180, if the rider has trouble landing switch. Invented by Kevin Staab.

<text>In mathematics, a comodule or corepresentation is a concept dual to a module. The definition of a comodule over a coalgebra is formed by dualizing the definition of a module over an associative algebra.

== Formal definition ==
Let &quot;K&quot; be a field, and &quot;C&quot; be a coalgebra over &quot;K&quot;. A (right) comodule over &quot;C&quot; is a &quot;K&quot;-vector space &quot;M&quot; together with a linear map

:formula_1

such that
# formula_2
# formula_3,
where Δ is the comultiplication for &quot;C&quot;, and ε is the counit.

Note that in the second rule we have identified formula_4 with formula_5.

== Examples ==
* A coalgebra is a comodule over itself.
* If &quot;M&quot; is a finite-dimensional module over a finite-dimensional &quot;K&quot;-algebra &quot;A&quot;, then the set of linear functions from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;K&quot; forms a coalgebra, and the set of linear functions from &quot;M&quot; to &quot;K&quot; forms a comodule over that coalgebra.
* A graded vector space &quot;V&quot; can be made into a comodule. Let &quot;I&quot; be the index set for the graded vector space, and let formula_6 be the vector space with basis formula_7 for formula_8. We turn formula_6 into a coalgebra and &quot;V&quot; into a formula_6-comodule, as follows:
:# Let the comultiplication on formula_6 be given by formula_12.
:# Let the counit on formula_6 be given by formula_14.
:# Let the map formula_15 on &quot;V&quot; be given by formula_16, where formula_17 is the &quot;i&quot;-th homogeneous piece of formula_18.

=== In algebraic topology ===
One important result in algebraic topology is the fact that homology formula_19 over the dual Steenrod algebra formula_20 forms a comodule. This comes from the fact the Steenrod algebra formula_21 has a canonical action on the cohomologyformula_22When we dualize to the dual Steenrod algebra, this gives a comodule structureformula_23This result extends to other cohomology theories as well, such as complex cobordism and is instrumental in computing its cohomology ring formula_24. The main reason for considering the comodule structure on homology instead of the module structure on cohomology lies in the fact the dual Steenrod algebra formula_20 is a commutative ring, and the setting of commutative algebra provides more tools for studying its structure.

== Rational comodule ==
If &quot;M&quot; is a (right) comodule over the coalgebra &quot;C&quot;, then &quot;M&quot; is a (left) module over the dual algebra &quot;C&quot;∗, but the converse is not true in general: a module over &quot;C&quot;∗ is not necessarily a comodule over &quot;C&quot;. A rational comodule is a module over &quot;C&quot;∗ which becomes a comodule over &quot;C&quot; in the natural way.

== Comodule morphisms ==
Let &quot;R&quot; be a ring, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; be &quot;R&quot;-modules, and
formula_26
be right &quot;C&quot;-comodules. Then an &quot;R&quot;-linear map formula_27 is called a (right) comodule morphism, or (right) C-colinear, if
formula_28
This notion is dual to the notion of a linear map between vector spaces, or, more generally, of a homomorphism between &quot;R&quot;-modules.

<text>Mats Torsten Näslund (born 31 October 1959), nicknamed &quot;Le Petit Viking&quot;, is a Swedish former ice hockey player. He played as a left winger. Despite his small size at only five feet and seven inches, Näslund is best known for being one of the top forwards with the National Hockey League&#x27;s Montreal Canadiens from 1982 to 1990. In addition to the Canadiens, Näslund played for Timrå IK, Brynäs IF, and Malmö IF of the Swedish Elite League, and HC Lugano of the National League A between 1975 and 1994. He made a short NHL comeback attempt in 1995 with the Boston Bruins following the 1994–95 NHL lockout, and retired after the season&#x27;s conclusion.

In 1986, he won the Stanley Cup with the Canadiens, and he won the Lady Byng Trophy in 1988. He is a three-time Le Mat Trophy champion, once with Brynäs in 1980, and leading Malmö to its only championship wins in 1992 and 1994. Internationally, he won gold medals at the 1991 World Championship in Finland and the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, making him a member of the prestigious Triple Gold Club. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2005.

==NHL career==
Näslund was selected in the second round as the 37th overall pick in the 1979 NHL Entry Draft, by the Montreal Canadiens. After playing for three more years in Sweden, he joined the Canadiens for the 1982–83 NHL season. He was the first European-born player to play for the Canadiens.

In his rookie season of 1982–83, Näslund scored 71 points in 74 games, becoming the Canadiens&#x27; third leading scorer behind Guy Lafleur and Ryan Walter, who had 76 and 75 points respectively. That year, he was recognized as the left winger on the NHL All-Rookie Team.

His offensive abilities quickly endeared him to Montreal fans, and he was given the nickname of &quot;Le Petit Viking&quot; (The Little Viking), a reference to his Nordic heritage and his short stature. Teammate Mario Tremblay jokingly said when Näslund arrived that the Habs only received half of a player and the other half would arrive later.

Näslund had his best NHL season in . He scored 43 goals and 67 assists (110 points, eighth in the NHL that season), the first Montreal player to top 100 points since Lafleur had 125 in , and the last Canadien to reach 100 points or finish among the league&#x27;s top ten scorers as of . His 67 assists were an NHL record for a left winger until Kevin Stevens of the Pittsburgh Penguins scored 69 in . In the 1986 Stanley Cup playoffs, the speedy Näslund was Montreal&#x27;s top point-getter (with 19), as the Canadiens won their twenty-third Stanley Cup, their first since 1979. He also led the Montreal Canadiens in scoring in , albeit with 30 points fewer than he had the preceding season.

During his NHL career, Näslund was an infrequent visitor to the penalty box. Never logging more than 19 penalty minutes in any season during his career, his gentlemanly play was recognized when he was voted the winner of the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, beating Wayne Gretzky in the voting. (He is the latter of only two Habs to win the Lady Byng, following Toe Blake in .) During the 1988 NHL All-Star Game, his five assists established a record, and he was instrumental in helping Mario Lemieux set the All-Star Game record with six points.

After a sub-par season, worn down by the relatively long NHL seasons, Näslund left the Canadiens to return to Europe. He played one year in Switzerland, followed by three seasons in his native Sweden. He returned to the NHL to play for the Boston Bruins in the lockout shortened season, and retired from hockey thereafter.

Näslund ranks twelfth on the Canadiens all-time scoring list, with 612 points in 617 regular season games.

Despite both playing ice hockey and coming from Västernorrland County, he is not related to Markus Näslund.

== International career ==




Näslund is one of Swedish hockey&#x27;s all-time great players, and as such represented his country at numerous international tournaments. As a junior, he represented Sweden at the 1978 and 1979 World Junior Hockey Championship, winning a silver medal in 1978 and a bronze medal the following year.

Näslund would go on to participate in five World Championships, winning a bronze in 1979, a silver in 1981 and a gold in 1991, his last appearance at the event. Because the World Championships occur at the same time as the Stanley Cup playoffs, Näslund was often not available for the event during his best years in Montreal. His sole appearance as an active NHL player came in 1983.

Näslund did get the chance to play for Sweden against the NHL&#x27;s best players at the 1984, 1987 and 1991 Canada Cup, the forerunner to the World Cup. The Swedes lost to Canada in the finals of the 1984 event. They reached the semifinal game in both 1987 and 1991, losing to the USSR and Canada respectively.

Näslund also participated in two Winter Olympics, in 1980 and 1994. Sweden won the bronze medal in 1980 and the gold medal in 1994, that year defeating Canada in a memorable shootout. The gold medal in 1994 gave Näslund the distinction of having won the Stanley Cup, World Championship and Olympic Championship in his career, and (along with Håkan Loob and Tomas Jonsson) becoming the first member(s) of the Triple Gold Club.

As general manager for the Swedish national men&#x27;s ice hockey team, Näslund helped construct the gold medal-winning team at the 2006 Winter Olympics.

<text>The Isle of Axholme is an area of Lincolnshire, England, adjoining South Yorkshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire. It is located between Scunthorpe and Gainsborough, both of which are in the traditional West Riding of Lindsey, and Doncaster, in South Yorkshire.

==Description==
The name &quot;Isle&quot; is given to the area since, prior to the area being drained by the Dutchman Cornelius Vermuyden in the 17th century, each town or village was built on areas of dry, raised ground in the surrounding marshland. The River Don used to flow to the north and west (it has since been diverted), dividing the Isle from Yorkshire; the River Idle separates the Isle from Nottinghamshire; and the River Trent separates the Isle from the rest of Lincolnshire. Three towns developed here: Epworth, Crowle and Haxey.

The boundaries of the Isle of Axholme usually match with those of the ancient &quot;wapentake&quot; of Epworth and its 17 communities as listed in the Domesday Book of 1086: Belton, Crowle, Epworth, Haxey, Beltoft, (High and Low) Burnham, Owston Ferry, (East) Lound and (Graise)lound, Garthorpe, Luddington, Amcotts, (West) Butterwick, Althorpe, The Marshes, Waterton, Upperthorpe, and Westwoodside. Other settlements on the Isle include Eastoft, Sandtoft – home to Europe&#x27;s largest trolleybus museum – and Wroot.

Much of the northern part of the Isle has flat topography, with rich farmland used mainly to grow wheat and sugar beet. The land is particularly fertile due to its history of annual flooding from the Trent and peat soil which was created by dense ancient woodland which covered much of the Isle. Even today, in many parts of the northern Isle, petrified wood can be found at about six feet below ground; relics from this woodland, these are locally called &quot;bog oaks&quot;.

A long-distance walking route, the &quot;Peatlands Way&quot;, traverses the Isle.

==Etymology==
&quot;Axholme&quot; means &quot;island by Haxey&quot;, from the town name + Old Norse &quot;holmr&quot; &quot;island&quot;. The name was recorded as &quot;Hakirhomle&quot; in 1196. The Old English suffix &quot;ey&quot; in &quot;Haxey&quot; also indicates an island.

==Historical descriptions==

===1911 description===
==Land drainage history==

The Isle is known for the early influence of Cornelius Vermuyden, a Dutch engineer who initiated the realignment of several of the highland carriers flowing through the district. To carry out the work he brought in a large number of Flemish workers, many of whom settled permanently despite violent opposition from the established population. The drainage allowed increased agricultural production, and has left a legacy in the unique strip farming which survives in the 21st century around Epworth. The watercourses of the Isle and the surrounding area are managed by the Isle of Axholme Internal Drainage Board which maintains 188 miles (302 km) of watercourse and 18 pumping stations, and manages the water levels of the adjacent Thorne Moors and Hatfield Moors, both environmentally sensitive areas.

==Road and railway==
The Axholme Joint Railway traversed the area, but the line has now been abandoned. There are still railway stations in and on the line between Scunthorpe and Sheffield. The M180 motorway now crosses the centre of the area, dividing &#x27;South Axholme&#x27;, centred on Epworth, from &#x27;North Axholme&#x27;, centred on Crowle. The A161 road crosses the Isle from north to south.

==Governance==
There was an Isle of Axholme Rural District from 1894 to 1974, which covered the entire Isle after 1936. This became part of the Boothferry district of Humberside in 1974, and since 1996 has been in the North Lincolnshire unitary authority.

Following boundary changes in 2023, the isle became part of the new Doncaster East and the Isle of Axholme parliamentary constituency in 2024.

<text>Mary Ritter Beard (August 5, 1876 – August 14, 1958) was an American historian, author, women&#x27;s suffrage activist, and women&#x27;s history archivist who was also a lifelong advocate of social justice. As a Progressive Era reformer, Beard was active in both the labor and women&#x27;s rights movements. She also authored several books on women&#x27;s role in history including &quot;On Understanding Women&quot; (1931), &quot;America Through Women&#x27;s Eyes&quot; (editor, 1933), and &quot;Woman as Force in History: A Study in Traditions and Realities&quot; (1946), her major work. In addition, she collaborated with her husband, historian Charles Austin Beard, as coauthor of seven textbooks, most notably &quot;The Rise of American Civilization&quot; (1927), two volumes, and &quot;America in Midpassage: A Study of the Idea of Civilization&quot; (1939) and &quot;The American Spirit&quot; (1942), the third and fourth volume of &quot;The Rise of American Civilization&quot; series. A standalone book, &quot;Basic History of the United States&quot;, was their best-selling work.

During the early decades of the twentieth century, Beard actively supported passage of the Nineteenth Amendment and was involved with several women&#x27;s suffrage organizations that included the Women&#x27;s Trade Union League, the Equality League of Self-Supporting Women (later renamed the Women&#x27;s Political Union), the New York City Suffrage Party, and the Wage Earners&#x27; Suffrage League. She was also a member of the advisory board of the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (later called the National Woman&#x27;s Party. For a time, she edited suffrage publications, &quot;The Woman Voter&quot; and &quot;The Suffragist.&quot;

Beard&#x27;s interest in women&#x27;s history led to her work in establishing the World Center for Women&#x27;s Archives in 1935 in New York City. Although the center closed in 1940, largely due to internal issues and lack of funding, her efforts encouraged several colleges and universities to begin collecting similar records on women&#x27;s history. Beard was a consultant on the early development of women&#x27;s history archives at Radcliffe and Smith Colleges, which eventually led to establishment of the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University, and the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College.

==Early life==
===Family background===
Mary Ritter was born on August 5, 1876, in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Narcissa (Lockwood) and Eli Foster Ritter. She was the family&#x27;s fourth child and the eldest daughter.

Mary&#x27;s mother was born in Paris, Kentucky, and graduated from Brookville Academy in Thornton, Kentucky. She worked as a teacher in Kentucky before moving with her family in 1861 to Greencastle, Indiana (home to Asbury, now DePauw University).

Her father was the son of Rachel (Jessup) and James Ritter. He was born and grew up on his parents&#x27; farm west of Indianapolis in Hendricks County, Indiana. After attending Northwestern Christian University (present-day Butler University) in Indianapolis from 1859 to 1861, he enlisted in the Union Army in April 1861, joining the 16th Indiana Infantry Regiment shortly after the outbreak of the American Civil War. Eli Ritter was later transferred to the 79th Indiana Infantry Regiment before being honorably discharged from the army in June 1863. Following his military service, he enrolled at Asbury University, graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1865. He married Narcissa Lockwood, a Greencastle resident, in June 1866. Due to weak eyesight, resulting from exposure during the war, Eli Ritter relied on his wife, Narcissa, to read to him during his legal studies. After he passed the Indiana bar in 1866, the Ritters moved to Indianapolis, where Eli established a law practice. In addition, he was active in the temperance movement and in 1883 became a colonel in the Indiana National Guard.

===Education and intellectual development===
Mary Ritter attended public schools in Indianapolis and graduated from Shortridge High School in 1893 as valedictorian of her class. Around the age of sixteen, she enrolled in 1893 at DePauw University, the alma mater of her father and her other siblings, and became a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority. She also served as president of her class.

Ritter graduated from DePauw in 1897 with a Bachelor of Philosophy (PhB) degree. Ritter later claimed to be influenced by two sorority sisters at DePauw who refused to limit themselves to conventional coursework and activities for women. Another early influence on Ritter was her German professor, Henry B. Longden, who incorporated culture, literature, and philosophy into his teaching of the German language, asking his students to view their studies in a much broader context.

While attending college, Ritter met and began a relationship with Charles Austin Beard, a fellow student and her future husband. Beard, a native of Henry County, Indiana, was the son of a wealthy farmer and real-estate investor. After attending Spiceland Academy (a Quaker school in Henry County), Beard enrolled at DePauw University in 1894, and became a Phi Beta Kappa graduate in 1898.

===Marriage and family life===
After graduating from DePauw in 1897, Ritter found employment in Greencastle as a public high school German language teacher, while Beard, then her fiancé, traveled to England in August 1898 to pursue graduate studies at the University of Oxford. He also helped to establish Ruskin Hall (present-day Ruskin College), a free university for working-class men, before returning to the United States in late 1899.

The couple married in March 1900. A month later, they moved to England, where they initially lived at Oxford, then relocated to Manchester while Charles continued his studies and worked as director of Ruskin Hall&#x27;s extension department. Their daughter, Miriam, the first of their two children, was born at Manchester in 1901.

In 1902, after deciding to return to the United States, the Beards settled in New York City, where they both enrolled as graduate students in the School of Political Science at Columbia University. By 1904, Mary Ritter Beard had discontinued her studies in sociology and became more active in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. The Beards&#x27; son, William, was born in 1907, the same year they bought a sixteen-room home in New Milford, Connecticut, where they frequently entertained guests.

Charles Beard completed his doctor of philosophy (PhD) degree in history, and became a faculty member at Columbia University. He resigned his professorship in 1917 as a protest, following the dismissal of three anti-war faculty members during World War I, but continued his career as a writer and historian.

==European influences==
While living in England from 1900 to 1902, Mary Beard studied history and taught German. She also observed the plight of the working class in British industrial society. Beard became involved in the British labor and women&#x27;s suffrage movements through her friendships with radical suffragists and socialist reformers Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters, Christabel Pankhurst and Sylvia Pankhurst, who were members of the Independent Labour Party, and other leaders. Beard&#x27;s acquaintances with European intellectuals also influenced her interests in the struggles of the working class, progressive politics, social reform, and social injustice.

==Suffrage movement==

Beard became involved with radical supporters of the women&#x27;s in the suffrage movement in England through her friendship with Emmeline Pankhurst, a neighbor in Manchester, and Pankhurst&#x27;s daughters. Beard also began to support issues affecting working-class women. After the Beards returned to the United States in 1902, Mary continued her activism in labor organizations such as the New York Women&#x27;s Trade Union League (WTUL), where she hoped to improve the conditions under which women labored. In addition to WTUL, Beard was active in the Equality League of Self-Supporting Women (later the Women&#x27;s Political Union).

Beard came to believe that suffrage would give women a tool to elect political leaders who would, in turn, implement social justice reforms and governmental regulations to improve economic conditions and the lives of the working class. By 1910 she was active in women&#x27;s suffrage activities in New York as a member of the New York City Suffrage Party (NYCSP), led by Carrie Chapman Catt. From 1910 to 1912, Beard also edited its publication &quot;The Woman Voter&quot;, before focusing more of her efforts on the Wage-Earners&#x27; Suffrage League.

Beard left the NYCSP in 1913 to join the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (CU) (later called the National Woman&#x27;s Party) under the leadership of Alice Paul and Lucy Burns. As a member of this radical faction of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, Beard helped to organize women&#x27;s suffrage rallies and served as editor of its weekly magazine. &quot;The Suffragist&quot;. At Paul&#x27;s request, Beard became a member of the Union&#x27;s congressional committee. She was among the organizers of a major woman&#x27;s suffrage parade in Washington, D.C., on March 3, 1913, and served as a marshal for a section of the parade that included many African American women, who Beard insisted should participate. Beard&#x27;s contributions to the Congressional Union also included strategy planning, organizingd and participatind in demonstrations, delivering lectures, writing articles, and testifying before Congress, including an appearance before a U.S. House of Representatives congressional committee on women&#x27;s suffrage in 1914. Shortly before her resignation from the National Woman&#x27;s Party&#x27;s Advisory Council, Beard lead a New York delegation to Washington, D.C., in November 1917 to show support for the women&#x27;s suffrage activists (Silent Sentinels) who were picketing in front of the White House.

==Writings==
===Collaborations with Charles Beard===

From their home in Connecticut, Mary and Charles Beard co-authored seven books together, beginning with &quot;American Citizenship&quot; (1914), a high school textbook. Although they are named as coauthors, their contemporaries, including book reviewers and fellow historians, overlooked Mary&#x27;s contributions. Historians Barbara Turoff, Ann Lane, and Nancy Cott, in their assessment of Mary Beard&#x27;s works, and Ellen Nore, in her research on Charles Beard, have concluded that the Beards&#x27; collaboration was a full partnership, as the couple confirmed, but the Beards did not fully describe their individual contributions to their published works.

===Individual and edited works===
Mary Beard&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Work in Municipalities&quot; (1915), the first of six books that she wrote as a solo author, argued that women&#x27;s social reform efforts could be considered political activities as well. She also urged women to pursue leadership positions in municipal government. Beard&#x27;s book, &quot;A Short History of the American Labor Movement&quot; (1920), concerns social reform and the working class, but she is best known for her authored and edited works on women&#x27;s history, especially &quot;On Understanding Women&quot; (1931), &quot;America Through Women&#x27;s Eyes&quot; (editor, 1933), and her major work, &quot;Woman as Force in History: A Study in Traditions and Realities&quot; (1946) her most influential publication. To increase interest in research on women&#x27;s history, Beard used multiple channels of communication, including pamphlets, radio shows, articles, speeches, and books.

Beard&#x27;s &quot;Woman as Force in History&quot; (1946) challenges the traditional feminists&#x27; view and argues that women had always been active agents in history alongside men. She further contends that focusing on women as victims instead of their impact in the world was distorted and inaccurate. Beard also believed that a woman&#x27;s social class and her gender play important roles in her achievements.

Beard rejected the feminist idea that women had been subjugated by men and &quot;deliberately played down the very real constrictions on women through the centuries.&quot; She believed strongly in encouraging women through her writing about the importance of women&#x27;s history, declaring: &quot;We cannot know how our own society has been built up without known women&#x27;s share in establishing free speech, free assembly, freedom of worship, all civil liberties, all humanism, all the branches of learning and everything else we value.&quot; Beard also wrote a 56-page pamphlet, &quot;A Changing Political Economy as it Affects American Women&quot; (1934), sponsored by the American Association of University Women, that was a prototype for a course on women&#x27;s studies. Despite her efforts, she was unable to gain its adoption for college- or university-level courses.

Beard also wrote and edited other books on women&#x27;s history: &quot;Laughing Their Way: Women&#x27;s Humor in America&quot; (coedited with Martha Bensley Bruère, 1934), and &quot;The Force of Women in Japanese History&quot; (1953). Her final book was a tribute to her husband, &quot;The Making of Charles Beard&quot; (1955).

===Women&#x27;s history scholar===
With the successful passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920, Beard began to concentrate more on her writing and to further develop her philosophy concerning women in history, which frequently set her at odds with the feminist movement.

Mary and Charles Beard were active supporters of the &quot;New History&quot; movement, which sought to include social, cultural, and economic factors in written history—an important step towards including the contributions of women. Mary Beard expanded on this concept, contending that the proper study of women&#x27;s &quot;long history&quot;, from primitive pre-history to the present, would reveal that women have always played a central role in all civilizations. She also emphasized that women were different from men, but that did not make their contributions of any less value, only that their significance was simply not being recognized.

In the 1930s, Beard disagreed with feminists of the era, who she believed viewed their history as one of oppression. She also created a controversy over her rejection of the feminist goal of equality with men, feminists sought to achieve through passage of an Equal Rights Amendment, which Beard opposed, among other activities. To Beard, the traditional feminist view of women&#x27;s oppression was not only inaccurate but unhelpful, and that striving for equality with men was an inadequate goal, especially in relation to education. Beard felt the women can and should offer something different and more socially beneficial to society, and that women should be providers of &quot;culture and civilization&quot;.

===Archivist===
In 1935, international peace activist and feminist Rosika Schwimmer suggested the idea to Beard of establishing the World Center for Women&#x27;s Archives (WCWA), which held its first organizational meeting in New York City in October 1935. As director of the center for the next five years, Beard broadened the scope of the project beyond collecting the documents related to women in the peace movement. She hoped to collect in a central repository any and all manner of women&#x27;s published and unpublished records and other archival materials related to women&#x27;s history at an international level. She also planned to establish an institution for women&#x27;s research, education, and political initiatives, as well as supporting efforts to aid in the writing of history. Beard chose the center&#x27;s motto, &quot;No documents, no history,&quot; from a quote by French historian Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges.

Through Beard&#x27;s contacts, the center accumulated project sponsors. In addition, Carrie Chapman Catt, Jane Addams, Harriet Stanton Blatch, and other prominent women such as Alice Paul, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Fannie Hurst, and Inez Haynes Irwin also offered their support. Schwimmer resigned from the center&#x27;s board of directors in 1936, but Eleanor Roosevelt and Frances Perkins endorsed the WCWA, which was officially launched in New York City on December 15, 1937. The center initially gained publicity and support for its efforts to collect materials, preserve records, and generate interest in women&#x27;s history. However, as director of the center, Beard dealt with a multitude of competing interests, a result of long-standing differences within the women&#x27;s movement, as well as insufficient funding and disagreements among its leadership. The Center never lived up to Beard&#x27;s expectations and she resigned in 1940. The WCWA closed later that year, largely because of internal strife and a lack of funding, without fully achieving its goals.

Beard&#x27;s work with the WCWA encouraged several colleges and universities to begin collecting similar records on women&#x27;s history. She is credited with helping to develop a women&#x27;s history archives at Radcliffe and Smith colleges, which eventually led to establishing the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University and the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith. In addition, some of the WCWA&#x27;s records were transferred to smaller collections such as the New Jersey Historical Society. Beard&#x27;s efforts at the WCWA also inspired the later work of the Women&#x27;s Project of New Jersey, Inc.

===Critique of Britannica===
After the dissolution of the World Centre for Women&#x27;s Archives in 1940, Beard&#x27;s next project, beginning in 1941, was an analysis of Encyclopædia Britannica&#x27;s representation of women, produced following the suggestion of Walter Yust, chief editor of the &quot;Britannica&quot;. Beard convened a team of fellow female scholars (Dora Edinger, Janet A. Selig, and Marjorie White) to produce &quot;A Study of the Encyclopædia Britannica in Relation to its Treatment of Women&quot;. Beard and her colleagues collaborated on the project over an 18-month period, and in November 1942 delivered the 42-page report to Yust. Despite Yust&#x27;s expressed interest and assurances that the &quot;Britannica&quot; would include improvements, the report&#x27;s recommendations were ignored. Beard was disappointed with the result, and in 1947 correspondence she suggested that women should no longer write for the publication.

The report included significant recommendations on existing articles, as well as suggestions for new articles. For example, the authors noted that the treatment of abortion was not comprehensive. Arguing that it was more than a moral question, the researchers proposed that abortion was also relevant to population, political, health, medical, and social issues. The study also noted that the article on education was too masculine; questioned why there was no article on &quot;Queen;&quot; and why women were not included in the &quot;Britannica&#x27;s&quot; treatment of health and medicine. Additionally, from the article on &quot;Song&quot; the report noted: &quot;No women sang in Europe, it appears from this review. The contributions of nuns, in choir composition and singing, is not recognized at all.&quot; Topics that the authors recommended for inclusion included bathing, breadmaking, dyeing, hospital, hunger, laundrying, and salons, among others.

==Later years==
Mary Beard became an active member of the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom. Mary and Charles Beard, both of whom were pacifists, also opposed the United States&#x27; involvement in World War II.

After Charles&#x27;s death in 1948, at North Haven, Connecticut, Mary continued to write and remain active into her late seventies. Her final books were &quot;The Force of Women in Japanese History&quot; (1953), published two decades after she and her husband had visited Japan in 1922–23, and &quot;The Making of Charles Beard&quot; (1955), a tribute to her late husband. After becoming ill around the age of eighty, she moved to Scottsdale, Arizona, to live near her son, William.

==Death and legacy==
Mary Beard died of kidney failure on August 14, 1958, at the age of eighty-two, at Phoenix in Maricopa County, Arizona. Her remains are interred in Ferncliff Cemetery at Hartsdale in Westchester County, New York, beside those of her husband, Charles, who had died on September 1, 1948, at 73.

Despite Beard&#x27;s efforts to acquire the personal papers of women throughout the world and from all time periods in history for the World Center for Women&#x27;s Archives, she did not consider her own manuscripts, letters, and her other documents of value. Before their deaths, she and her husband, whose pacifist stance proved controversial in the last decade of his life, destroyed nearly all of their personal correspondence and papers that they considered confidential. Mary Beard did not plan to publish any of their letters and did not want others to do so; however, some of the surviving letters found in the collections of other individuals were later published.

Mary and Charles Beards&#x27; legacy stems from their published works. The couple&#x27;s co-authorship of broad and inclusive textbooks was innovative for their time. In addition to incorporating social, economic, and political history, they included contemporary issues and women&#x27;s contributions to civilization. Margaret Crocco points out that the interdisciplinary approach the Beards used in their textbooks encouraged the development of academic programs in American society in the 1930s and 1940s at colleges and universities including Yale University, Brown University, the University of Minnesota, and the University of Pennsylvania. Mary was retroactively elected to membership in Phi Beta Kappa in 1939. (In 1897, when she graduated from DePauw University, only males were awarded this academic honor.)

In &quot;History and Feminism: A Glass Half Full&quot; (1993), Judith Zinsser argues that beginning in the 1930s, Mary Beard &quot;was the most well-known authority and advocate for women&#x27;s history in the United States.&quot; Beard&#x27;s writings and the actions she took during her life on behalf of women&#x27;s suffrage, labor issues, and establishment of women&#x27;s archives also helped to illuminate the contributions that women made throughout history. By end of twentieth century, other historians began to consciously integrate women&#x27;s contributions to history in their publications such as Howard Zinn&#x27;s revision of &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot; (rev. 1995). Margaret Crocco concluded that Mary Beard&#x27;s perspectives on women&#x27;s history, in general, and Beard&#x27;s contention that women have also been active agents in history &quot;remain at the forefront of the field today.&quot; In &quot;The Majority Finds Its Past: Placing Women in History&quot; (1979), historian Gerda Lerner described the ongoing efforts to write about women&#x27;s history as continuing the work that Beard had begun.

Although Beard&#x27;s work to establish a women&#x27;s archive in New York City was unsuccessful, she consulted on other women&#x27;s archive initiatives that eventually lead to the establishment of the Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University, as well as the Sophia Smith Collection at the Neilson Library at Smith College, and other women&#x27;s history projects such as those in New Jersey.

One of Mary Beard&#x27;s indirect legacies was the development of women&#x27;s history courses, which have become standard offerings on American college campuses. Her work &quot;A Changing Political Economy as It Affects American Women&quot; is an early example of a women&#x27;s history course syllabus. Women&#x27;s history has evolved into an academic field of study. In 1970, the Indiana University-South Bend campus began what is the oldest continuing women&#x27;s studies program in the United States.

<doc id="1200597" wikidata="Q7045238" url="?curid=1200597" title="No liability">
<text>A no-liability company in Australia (suffix NL) is a company which, under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), must have as its stated objects that it is solely a mining company and that it is not entitled to calls on the unpaid issue price of shares. It is a company which is restricted to mining activities and is the only sort of corporation which is entitled to this form of liability, given the sometimes financially risky business of mining. Most of the usual rules in the Act apply to no-liability companies, save that a mining company must adopt a constitution which states their objects as mining.

No-liability companies should not be confused with the concept of limited liability.

No-liability companies are differentiated from other companies as their shareholders are not liable to pay calls on unpaid shares. This differs from traditional company structure where the purchase of shares is a binding contract. Should the shareholder choose not to pay when there is a call, the shareholder forfeits both the unpaid and paid shares. This encourages investment in potentially risky mining ventures, as a shareholder with unpaid shares can choose to withdraw from the company with no legal consequences. A successful mining company usually converts to a limited liability company when advantageous.

== Forfeiture ==

Shares upon which calls had not been paid were forfeit and offered for sale by auction after 14 days. Former owners could redeem their forfeited shares by paying the call and perhaps a fee to cover expenses.

== Company names ==

Early on in the life of the No Liability system, such companies were identified as
* ABC Mining (registered)

Then the &quot;No Liability&quot; tag took over, such as
* ABC Mining (no liability)
* DEF Mining no liability

And finally
* GHI Mining N.L.

The word &quot;mining&quot; does not have to appear in the name of the company. Oil exploration is a form of mining.
* Poseidon NL

== Timeline ==
* No Liability companies were introduced at a time when there were six colonies, and therefore six sets of laws.
* 1845 – South Australian Mining Association was founded as a &quot;no responsibility&quot; (with the same meaning) company.
* 1869 – no liability companies introduced in Victoria
* 1877 – No-liability Mining Companies Bill introduced in New South Wales
* 1895 – No-liability Mining Companies Bill; in New South Wales

== Conversions ==

Ordinary mining and exploration companies could convert to No Liability status, subject to approval of shareholders and approval of creditors. This was particularly useful when NL status was first introduced.

No Liability companies which discovered a payable deposit of ore would normally convert to Limited status as this facilitated the financing of that mine.

== Stock exchange ==

Companies in Australia listed on the ASX have a three-character symbol. NL companies may have more than one class of contributing shares. A typical set of symbols might be:

* XYZ – fully paid
* XYZCA – contributing shares class A
* XYZCB – contributing shares class B

The code does not distinguish between No Liability companies and ordinary companies, only the full company name does that.

<text>Jiangnan is a geographic area in China referring to lands immediately to the south of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, including the southern part of its delta. The region encompasses the city of Shanghai, the southern part of Jiangsu Province, the southeastern part of Anhui Province, the northern part of Jiangxi Province and Zhejiang Province. The most important cities in the area include Anqing, Changzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Wenzhou, Yangzhou and Zhenjiang.

Jiangnan has long been regarded as one of the most prosperous regions in China due to its wealth in trade and very high human development. Most people of the region speak Wu Chinese dialects as their native languages.
==Etymology==
The name Jiangnan is the pinyin romanization of the Standard Mandarin pronunciation of , meaning &quot;[Lands] South of the [Yangtze] River&quot;. Although &quot;jiang&quot; () is now the common Chinese word for any large river, it was historically used in Ancient Chinese to refer specifically to the Yangtze River, which defines the Jiangnan region. 

In older and non-standard romanization systems, Jiangnan was historically written as Chiang-nan, Kiangnan, and Keang-nan in English and other European languages.

== History ==
The earliest archaeological evidences were of the Majiabang and of the Hemudu cultures. The later Liangzhu culture, from around 2600–2000 BC, created complex and beautiful jade artifacts. Their economy was based on rice cultivation, fishing and constructed houses on stilts over rivers or lakes. During the Zhou dynasty, the Wu and Baiyue peoples inhabited the area with heavy aquaculture and stilt houses, but became increasingly sinicized through contact with northern Chinese states. They adopted the Chinese writing system and created excellent bronze swords. The Chu state from the west (in Hubei) expanded into this area and defeated the Yue state. After Chu was conquered by the Qin state, China was unified. It was not until the fall of the Western Jin dynasty during the early 4th century AD that northern Chinese moved to Jiangnan in significant numbers. The Yellow River valley was becoming barren due to flooding (lack of trees after intensive logging to create farmland) and constant warfare during the upheaval of the Five Barbarians.

Although Chinese civilization originated in the North China Plain around the Yellow River, natural climate change and continuous harassment from nomadic enemies damaged North China&#x27;s agricultural productivity throughout the 1st millennium AD. Many people settled in South China, where the Jiangnan area&#x27;s warm and wet climate were ideal for supporting agriculture and allowed highly sophisticated cities to arise. As early as the Eastern Han dynasty (circa 2nd century AD), Jiangnan areas became one of the more economically prominent areas of China. Other than rice, Jiangnan produced highly profitable trade products such as tea, silk, and celadon porcelain (from Shangyu). Convenient transportation – the Grand Canal to the north, the Yangtze River to the west, and seaports such as Yangzhou – contributed greatly to local trade and also trade between ancient China and other nations.

Several Chinese dynasties were based in Jiangnan. After the Qin dynasty fell, the insurgent state of Chu took control. Its ruler, Xiang Yu, was born here. During the Three Kingdoms period, Jianye (present-day Nanjing) was the capital of Eastern Wu. In the 3rd century, many northern Chinese moved here after nomadic groups controlled the north. In the 10th century, Wuyue was a small coastal kingdom founded by Qian Liu who made a lasting cultural impact on Jiangnan and its people to this day. After the Jurchen completely overran northern China in the Jin–Song war of the 1120s, the exiled Song dynasty government retreated south, establishing the new Southern Song capital at Hangzhou in 1127. 
During the last years of the Yuan dynasty, Jiangnan was fought for by two major rebel states: Zhu Yuanzhang&#x27;s Ming faction, based in Nanjing, and the Suzhou-centered Wu faction led by Zhang Shicheng. A ten-year rivalry ended with Zhu&#x27;s capture of Suzhou in 1367; having thus reunified Jiangnan, Zhu proclaimed himself the first emperor of the Ming dynasty on Chinese New Year&#x27;s Day (20 January) of 1368, and a few months later expelled the Mongols from Northern China as well. Nanjing remained the capital of the Ming dynasty until the early 15th century, when the third Ming ruler, the Yongle Emperor, moved the capital to Beijing.

When the Qing dynasty first took over China, they renamed the &quot;Southern Directly-Controlled Area&quot; around the Ming&#x27;s southern capital Nanjing to be their Jiangnan Province, which was later divided into the separate provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui overseen by the Viceroy of Liangjiang. Besides assisting the Southern Ming as long as possible, Jiangnan&#x27;s gentry offered initial resistance to the Manchu Qing by interrupting tax collection in the area.

The Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty made many visits to Jiangnan (), which have been the popular subject of numerous Chinese operas and television dramas. Earlier, the Kangxi Emperor visited the region as well. Jiangnan, specifically Shaoxing, was actually the southern terminus of Kangxi&#x27;s so-called Southern Inspection Tour.

During the 19th century Taiping Rebellion, the regime established by the Taiping rebels occupied much of Jiangnan and eventually made Nanjing its capital. The area suffered much damage as the rebellion was quelled and Qing imperial rule restored.

After the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, and Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Northern Expedition, the Republic of China (ROC), following the wishes of Sun Yat-sen, made Nanjing the national capital. From the late 1920s until the Second World War, the Jiangnan area was the focus of Chinese economic development. Much of the Kuomintang&#x27;s ruling elite and the ROC&#x27;s economic elite hailed from the Jiangnan area.

===Geographical identity===
Dialect has also been used as a tool for regional identity and politics in the Jiangbei and Jiangnan regions. While the city of Yangzhou was a flourishing and prosperous centre of trade, it was considered part of Jiangnan (south of the river), which was known to be wealthy, even though Yangzhou was north of the Yangtze River. Once Yangzhou&#x27;s wealth and prosperity began to wane, it was then considered to be part of Jiangbei (literally &quot;north of the river&quot;), the &quot;backwater&quot;. 

In Yangzhou, the Yangzhou massacre during the transition from Ming to Qing dynasty has resulted in drastic decline of Wu speaking population in the city and the demographic change eventually made Taihu Wu dialects extinct in Yangzhou, while Jianghuai Mandarin becomes the more prominent dialect since then. This also made Yangzhou no longer perceived as part of Jiang Nan by some of the Wu speaking population. In the Jiangnan region itself, multiple subdialects of Wu fought for the position of the prestige dialect.

<text>Jean-Pierre Gorin (born 17 April 1943) is a French filmmaker and professor, best known for his work with &quot;Nouvelle Vague&quot; luminary Jean-Luc Godard, during what is often referred to as Godard&#x27;s &quot;radical&quot; period.

Jean-Pierre Gorin was a student of Louis Althusser, Michel Foucault and Jacques Lacan. He was a radical leftist well before meeting Godard in 1966. Godard relied on some of his discussions with Gorin while writing the script of 1967&#x27;s &quot;La Chinoise&quot;. Gorin played a role in making &quot;Le Gai Savoir&quot;, which was released in 1969. In 1968, Gorin and Godard founded the collective Dziga Vertov Group and together produced a series of overtly political films including &quot;Vent d&#x27;est&quot; (1970), &quot;Tout va bien&quot; (1972), and &quot;Letter to Jane&quot; (1972).

Gorin left France in the mid-1970s to accept a teaching position at the University of California, San Diego at the urging of the film-critic and painter Manny Farber. Gorin remained on the Visual Arts faculty thereafter, teaching film history and film criticism. He continued to make films—most notably a &quot;Southern California tetralogy&quot; of essay films: &quot;Poto and Cabengo &quot;(1978), &quot;Routine Pleasures &quot;(1986), &quot;My Crasy Life&quot; (1991), and &quot;Letter to Peter&quot; (1992). Gorin describes his concept of &quot;Poto and Cabengo&quot; in 1988:
The film is about an unstructured discourse—the language of the twins—surrounded by structured discourses—the discourse of the family, the discourse of the media, the discourse of therapy, the discourse of documentary filmmaking... [The twins&#x27; language] erupts as a subversive act which has not been authorized by any social or ideological establishment. In a sense its special threat is that its &quot;unauthorized&quot; nature relativizes the arbitrary nature of those institutionalized discourses. The singsong of the twins reveals the shaky grounds of institutional power. It relativizes discursive authority from the family to the scientific community in their competitive and ineffectual attempts to &quot;define&quot; the twins who spontaneously flit about the screen exceeding any definition.

<text>The following table indicates declared Indonesian government national holidays. Cultural variants also provide opportunity for holidays tied to local events. Beside official holidays, there are the so-called &quot;&quot;libur bersama&quot; or &quot;cuti bersama&quot;&quot;, or joint leave(s) declared nationwide by the government. In total there are 16 public holidays every year.

==List of national public holidays==
==Other observances==
In addition to the official holidays, many religious, historical, other traditional holidays, and even United Nations observances populate the calendar, as well as observances proclaimed by officials and lighter celebrations. These are often observed by businesses and schools as holidays.

Since the presidency of Joko Widodo, the government often give &quot;national themes&quot; to commemorate these observances, even if these are United Nations observances with a UN-designated theme.

<text>Casavant Frères () is a Canadian organ building company in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, which has been building pipe organs since 1879. As of 2014, the company has produced more than 3,900 organs.

== Company history ==

Brothers Joseph-Claver (1855–1933) and Samuel-Marie (1859–1929) got their start in organ building in the shop of their father, Joseph Casavant, under his successor Eusèbe Brodeur. Claver worked with Brodeur during 1874–1878, then went to France for a 14-month apprenticeship with the firm of John Abbey in Versailles. He and Samuel then visited many organs and workshops in western Europe before establishing their factory in 1879 on the site of their father&#x27;s workshop on rue Girouard in Saint-Hyacinthe.

== Technical innovations ==
Casavant&#x27;s instruments boasted many innovations unique for that time, such as concave pedalboards, balanced expression pedals, keyboard improvements, and other enhancements. Their reputation as organ builders of international status was cemented in 1891 with their construction of the organ for the Notre-Dame de Montréal Basilica, a four-manual organ of eighty-two stops. This organ features adjustable combinations and speaking pipes of thirty-two foot length in the façade.

They won the Grand Prix at the International Exhibition held in Antwerp, Belgium, in 1930. They built organs around the world, including Canada, the United States, France, the West Indies, South and Central America, South Africa, and Japan. Their organs have been praised by many well-known organists over the last 100 years, including Guilmant, Vierne, Widor, Bonnet, Lemare, Dethier, Courboin, Bingham, and many others who inaugurated and played Casavant organs. Casavant organs are also found in colleges, universities and conservatories throughout the United States and Canada.

After the death of the Casavant brothers, the company continued to add innovations to their instruments. These include a particularly reliable key contact and tracker touch mechanism, which is a feature of the Casavant playing action.

During the 1960s, Casavant developed new electronic technology to the capture system of combination actions. In 1960, the company returned to mechanical action technology (while continuing to build electropneumatic action instruments as well) and has since built over two hundred tracker action instruments ranging in size from a single manual portable Continuo of four stops to two, three, and four manual organs.

New technology, such as solid-state coupling and switching systems, multiplex, multi-memory combination actions and MIDI have been adopted. Other improvements, such as more effective expressive enclosures, continue to be made.

The sound and style of Casavant organs has varied throughout the company&#x27;s history. The Casavant brothers themselves, Samuel and Claver Casavant, reflected mostly influences from contemporary France, but they traveled widely and visited many European instruments. They later brought in an Englishman, Stephen Stoot, under whose direction the tonal palette reflected additional influences from England. Later tonal directors, Lawrence Phelps and Gerhard Brunzema, contributed styles from the German &quot;Organ Reform Movement&quot;. The most recent tonal directors, Jean-Louis Coignet and Jacquelin Rochette, are rooted in but not limited to the various French organ building traditions.

Celebrated Canadian pianist Glenn Gould recorded his 1962 album &quot;The Art of the Fugue&quot; by Bach (Columbia Records) on a 1960 Casavant Frères organ in All Saints&#x27; Kingsway Anglican Church in Toronto – available with other &quot;Art of Fugue&quot; recordings on Sony 87759. The organ was destroyed by fire in 1966. A new Casavant organ, opus 3874 (2009), replaced it.

<doc id="1200668" wikidata="Q1042465" url="?curid=1200668" title="Carlo Rustichelli">
<text>Carlo Rustichelli (24 December 1916 – 13 November 2004) was an Italian film composer whose career spanned the 1940s to about 1990. His prolific output included about 250 film compositions, as well as arrangements for other films, and music for television.

==Life==
Born in Carpi, Emilia-Romagna to a family of music lovers, he gained a diploma in piano at the Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini in Bologna, going on to Rome where he studied composition at the Santa Cecilia Academy.

He had a wife (Evi), a son (Paolo, also a composer), and a daughter (Alida).

==Career==
He met Federico Fellini in post-war Rome, and probably through him met Pietro Germi, for whom he composed his first major film score for &quot;Gioventù perduta&quot; (&quot;Lost Youth&quot;), and with whom he was most associated. He composed music for many Germi films in the 1940s, 50s and 60s.

In 1972 he was commissioned by Billy Wilder to compose the music for &quot;Avanti!&quot;.

<text>Joseph Casavant (; 18071874) was a French Canadian manufacturer of pipe organs.

Casavant was born 23 January 1807 in Saint-Hyacinthe, Lower Canada to Dominique Casavant and Marie-Desanges Coderre. Originally a blacksmith, Casavant gave up his trade at age 27 to pursue classical studies in . While at Father Charles-Joseph Ducharme&#x27;s college in 1834, he happened upon a treatise by . The 1766 work on organ building was titled &quot;&quot; (The Art of Organ Building). He subsequently used it to restore the unfinished and abandoned school&#x27;s organ. News spread throughout the region with the vestry from the Ville de Laval ordering an organ. He set up business in Saint-Hyacinthe and received his first contract in 1840.

In 1850, he received an order for a church organ from Bytown, Canada West. While living there temporarily, he married his second wife Marie-Olive Sicard de Carufel.

By the time he retired in 1866, he had built 17 organs, including the ones for the Catholic cathedrals of Ottawa and Kingston, and the village church in Mont-Saint-Hilaire.

Casavant died in Saint-Hyacinthe on 9 March 1874. His work was carried on by his sons, Joseph-Claver and Samuel-Marie, under the firm name of Casavant Frères. Little of Casavant&#x27;s work survives today, however the company his two sons established retains the copy of work.

<text>The New American is a right-wing (sometimes described as far-right) print magazine published twice a month and a digital news source published daily online by American Opinion Publishing, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the John Birch Society. The magazine was created in 1985 from the merger of two John Birch Society publications: &quot;American Opinion&quot; and &quot;The Review of the News&quot;.

==History==
In February 1956, before founding the John Birch Society over two years later, Robert W. Welch Jr. created his first publication, a monthly entitled &quot;One Man&#x27;s Opinion&quot;, which became known two years later as &quot;American Opinion&quot;. Additionally, in 1965, he established a John Birch Society-affiliated publication known as &quot;The Review of the News&quot;, which was intended for a larger readership and covered news.

In September 1985, &quot;American Opinion&quot; was merged with &quot;The Review of the News&quot; to create &quot;The New American&quot;, with the aim of attracting a readership large enough to &quot;make the saving of our country possible.&quot; The magazine&#x27;s name was inspired by Robert Welch&#x27;s &quot;New Americanism&quot; essay. It was first headquartered in Belmont, Massachusetts.

The version of anticommunism espoused by the John Birch Society in &quot;The New American&quot; has alleged that American sovereignty and freedom are threatened by a conspiracy of powerful &quot;Insiders&quot; who are purportedly moving toward control of a world government in a new world order. As described by the academic Charles J. Stewart, articles in the magazine in the 1980s and 1990s argued that the collapse of communism in the Eastern Bloc at the end of the Cold War was a tactical move in the conspiracy and a &quot;jump forward in the development of socialism&quot;. The magazine has alleged that such a conspiracy also animates the United Nations, the European Union, and the North American Free Trade Agreement.

In 2006, &quot;The New American&quot; launched a mobile edition. In 2007, &quot;The New American&quot; published a special issue devoted to opposing a purported North American Union, and approximately 500,000 copies were distributed; Political Research Associates and the Southern Poverty Law Center described such descriptions of an imminent loss of American sovereignty in a merger with Canada and Mexico as a conspiracy theory.

In September 2019, during the Trump–Ukraine scandal, Hunter Biden&#x27;s Wikipedia article included dubious claims about his business dealings in Ukraine and his father Joe Biden&#x27;s motivations for going after a Ukrainian prosecutor; the claims were sourced to &quot;The Epoch Times&quot; and &quot;The New American&quot;.

==Editorial stance and notable coverage==
&quot;The New American&quot; has described what it sees as American moral decline, including abortion, drugs, homosexuality, crime, violence, teenage pregnancy, teen suicide, feminism, and pornography—all of which, it has said, are undermining the family and by extension the American republic. Such emphases have made the John Birch Society attractive to the religious right in the United States.

&quot;The New American&quot; publishes the Freedom Index, which rates members of Congress and state legislators “based on their adherence to constitutional principles of limited government, fiscal responsibility, national sovereignty and a traditional foreign policy of avoiding foreign entanglements.”

Contributors have included Hilaire du Berrier, Samuel Blumenfeld, Larry McDonald, and Ron Paul. The magazine has interviewed members of Congress including Andy Biggs, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Ronny Jackson.

<text>Köke Temür (; Mongolian: ᠬᠥᠬᠡᠲᠡᠮᠦᠷ, Köketemür, Хөхтөмөр; died 1375), sinicized name Wang Baobao (), was a prominent general of the Yuan dynasty of China.

==History==
He was born in Henan province. His paternal line originated in Central Asia, probably of recent Bayad Mongol descent. His mother was of Naiman origin, and was the sister of Chaghan Temür. Köke Temür was adopted by his maternal uncle Chaghan Temür, a Mongol warlord who fought against the Red Turban Rebellion. When his uncle died in war in Shandong in 1362, he succeeded Chaghan Temür&#x27;s post and corps, and soon demonstrated military talent in battles with the Red Turban Rebels in Shandong.

He intensified a feud with Bolad Temür a Datong-based warlord, and entered Taiyuan to confront him. He took the side of Crown Prince Ayushiridara (future Emperor Zhaozong) against the faction of Toghon Temür (Emperor Huizong) in a factional dispute in Dadu since Bolad Temür supported the anti-crown prince faction.

In 1364, Bolad Temür advanced from Datong on Dadu and seized the reins of the central government under the khan. Crown Prince Ayushiridara fled to Taiyuan to seek support from Köke Temür. The Crown Prince struck back with Köke Temür, and Bolad Temür was betrayed when Köke Temür attacked Dadu in 1365. He reinstated the Crown Prince, and was appointed as vice minister of the Secretariat and the king of Henan in return. However, this conflict helped Zhu Yuanzhang&#x27;s rise to power in southern China.

Köke Temür commanded the Yuan army against anti-Yuan rebels, but faced betrayal by subordinates including ethnic Han officers who had followed him since the very early stage. What was worse was that he got alienated from Ayushiridara, who was given political and military controls by Toghon Temür. After two major defeats (he fled alone in both occasions), he lost Henan and Taiyuan to the rising Ming corps and fled to Gansu. The Yuan dynasty was forced to retreat from China proper in 1368.

In 1370 when Toghon Temür died and Ayushiridara succeeded to the throne, Koke Temur entered the Mongolian Plateau from Gansu and joined the new khan, who was based in Karakorum. He undertook the defense of the khan. The Hongwu Emperor invited him seven times and offered bribes. But Koke Temur did not abandon his khagan in his misfortune. The most notable service was an overwhelming desert victory over a Ming army led by Xu Da in 1372. It is said that he killed 20,000 Ming soldiers. But in a further encounter against Xu Da in Gansu, Köke Temür&#x27;s army was badly mauled by the Ming dynasty and forced to flee across the Gobi desert.

Köke Temür&#x27;s sister was married to prince Zhu Shuang, the second son of the Hongwu Emperor.

He advanced southward with the Yuan troops to take China proper back for the Yuan remnants (known as the Northern Yuan in historiography), and expanded his influence to Shanxi. However, he died in 1375 and was followed by Ayushiridara in 1378. Their deaths radically weakened the Northern Yuan dynasty, extinguishing any hope of recapturing China proper.

==In popular culture==
He is featured in Jin Yong&#x27;s wuxia novel &quot;The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber&quot; and its television and movie adaptations as the older brother of one of the heroines, Zhao Min.

He is featured in some Zhu Yuanzhang drama television series such as &quot;The Legend of Beggar Emperor and the Big Foot Empress Consort&quot;.

<text>Clayton Daniel Bellinger (born November 18, 1968) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees and the Anaheim Angels, winning the World Series twice as a member of the Yankees. He was also on the 2002 Angels team, which won the 2002 World Series, but did not receive a championship ring as he only appeared in 2 regular season games.

His son, Cody Bellinger, is also a professional baseball player who won the 2019 National League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) award and won the 2020 World Series.

==Early life==
A native of Oneonta, New York, Bellinger played shortstop for Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida.

==Career==
Bellinger was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the second round (44th overall pick) in the 1989 draft. His first 10 seasons of professional baseball were spent in the minor leagues, six in Triple-A. Before his first call-up as a 30-year-old in 1999, he played more than 1,000 minor league games. Bellinger played for the New York Yankees in , , and . He played every position (including designated hitter) except for catcher and pitcher.

In the ninth inning of Game 2 of the 2000 World Series, Bellinger was inserted in left field in place of David Justice. Bellinger reached up with his arm fully extended to rob the Mets&#x27; Todd Zeile of a two-run home run and preserve a victory for the Yankees. The Yankees released him when he became eligible for arbitration; Bellinger then signed with the Anaheim Angels. He played two games at first base for the Angels in , had one at-bat in which he struck out, and was eventually demoted to the minor leagues.

==International career==
While playing in the Baltimore Orioles system in 2004, he was recruited by owner Peter Angelos to play for the Greek baseball team in the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens. Bellinger has Greek grandparents, and Angelos was in charge of the Greek national baseball team. In order to field a competitive team in the Olympics, Angelos made the decision to use experienced American players with mostly distant Greek ancestry (players&#x27; ancestry eligibility was allowed to date as far back as great-grandparents), as opposed to native Greeks due to their inexperience in a country where baseball was almost never played. Bellinger agreed as he hoped it would earn him a September call-up to the Orioles&#x27; roster when the Olympics were over. The Greek team went 1–6 and failed to advance to the medal round. Bellinger was one of a handful of players on the roster with Major League experience, and the only player to have won a World Series ring. He was not promoted to the Orioles&#x27; roster after the games concluded.

== After baseball ==
Bellinger was the assistant coach of the Chandler, Arizona, Little League All-Stars, who advanced to the 2007 Little League World Series.

As of 2017, Bellinger has been working for several years as a firefighter in Gilbert, Arizona.

==Personal life==
Bellinger and his wife Jennifer have a daughter and two sons: Ashli, Cody, who plays for the New York Yankees, and Cole, who was drafted by the San Diego Padres in 2017. Clay pitched to Cody in the 2017 Home Run Derby.

<text>Robert Earl Brenly (born February 25, 1954) is an American baseball sportscaster and a former professional baseball player, coach and manager. He played the majority of his Major League Baseball career as a catcher with the San Francisco Giants. After retiring as a player, Brenly worked as a broadcaster with the Chicago Cubs, then as a coach with the Giants, then as a broadcaster for Fox. He was hired to manage the Arizona Diamondbacks for the 2001 season, and won the franchise&#x27;s only championship his first year, becoming the fourth rookie manager to win a World Series and first since 1961. In 2004, Brenly was released by the Diamondbacks and again became a broadcaster with the Cubs until 2012. He now serves as a color commentator for Diamondbacks broadcasts.

==Early life==
Brenly was born on February 25, 1954, in Coshocton, Ohio.

==College career==
Brenly attended Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, and was a member of the Bobcats baseball team. By the time he graduated in 1976, Brenly had earned All-America honors and matched Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt&#x27;s school record of 10 home runs in a single college season. Brenly was inducted to the Kermit Blosser Ohio Athletics Hall of Fame in 1987.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Brenly was not drafted but signed as an amateur free agent by the San Francisco Giants in 1976.

===San Francisco Giants (1981–1988)===
Brenly made his major league debut in 1981 at the age of 27. Brenly replaced Milt May as the Giants starting catcher in 1983 and posted a .224 batting average along with 7 home runs and 34 runs batted in. Brenly had his best season offensively in 1984 when, he was hitting for a .318 batting average at mid-season to earn a spot as a reserve player for the National League in the 1984 All-Star game. He finished the season with a career-high .291 batting average with 20 home runs and 80 runs batted in. Brenly won the 1984 Willie Mac Award for his spirit and leadership.
In 1986, Brenly led National League catchers with a .995 fielding percentage, committing only 3 errors as a catcher in 101 games as the Giants improved from last place the previous season to finish third in the National League Western Division. Also in 1986, Brenly broke up a perfect game attempt by pitcher Don Carman on August 20 by leading off the ninth inning with a double.

Although Brenly was a good defensive catcher, he also has the dubious distinction of committing 4 errors in one inning while playing as a substitute third baseman during a game on September 14, 1986, against the Atlanta Braves. Already suited up to catch, he was asked to man third base when the regular player was unavailable. Three errors were on ground balls and one on a throw, with the throwing error coming on the same play as one of the ground ball errors. Brenly atoned for his mistakes by hitting a fifth-inning home run. He then hit a two-out, two-run single in the seventh inning to tie the game and finally hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to win the game.

Brenly was playing first base during a Giants-Mets game on September 3, 1986, when Keith Hernandez hit a sharp grounder to pitcher Terry Mulholland. The ball got stuck in Mulholland&#x27;s glove so Mulholland tossed the glove with the baseball to Brenly for the out.

Brenly led National League catchers in 1987 with 83 assists and posted a .267 batting average with 18 home runs and 51 runs batted in as, the Giants won the National League Western Division title. In the only post-season appearance of his career in the 1987 National League Championship Series, Brenly hit .235 with 1 home run and 2 runs batted in as the Giants were defeated by the St. Louis Cardinals in a seven-game series.

During the 1988 season, Brenly caught only 69 games and was released at the end of the season.

===Toronto Blue Jays (1989)===
In 1989, Brenly became a free agent and signed a contract to play for the Toronto Blue Jays. After half a season with the Blue Jays, he was released.

===Second stint with San Francisco Giants (1989)===
On July 18, Brenly re-signed to play for the Giants. After 12 more games with the Giants, he retired at the end of the 1989 season at the age of 35.

===Career statistics===
In a 9-year career, Brenly played in 871 games, accumulating 647 hits in 2615 at bats for a .247 career batting average along with 91 home runs and 333 runs batted in. He ended his career with a .984 fielding percentage as a catcher.

==Coaching career==
After serving a year as an analyst in Chicago, Brenly served as a coach for the Giants under manager Roger Craig, beginning in 1992. When Craig was fired at the end of the season in favor of Dusty Baker, Brenly stayed on the staff for three more years.

==Broadcasting career==
Brenly worked for Fox and worked alongside Joe Buck and Tim McCarver for the 1996 World Series, 1998 World Series, and the 2000 World Series to go along with the ALCS and All-Star Game in 1997 and 1999. In 1998, Brenly was hired as a broadcaster for the new expansion team in the Arizona Diamondbacks for Fox Sports Net Arizona. He was at the position for three years, which included broadcasts across national Fox platforms.
Brenly later returned to being a baseball analyst for Fox after leaving the Diamondbacks managerial position. He was then hired in November 2004 to replace Steve Stone as a color analyst for televised Chicago Cubs games. Brenly teamed with play-by-play announcer Len Kasper. He had previously teamed with Harry Caray, Thom Brennaman, and Ron Santo during the 1990 and 1991 seasons on radio. He often jokes about his mediocre playing career. Brenly is often referred to by his nickname, &quot;BB&quot; and was rumored to be in the running for several managerial positions for the 2008 season, though nothing materialized. Brenly was in the running for the 2009 Milwaukee Brewers managerial position and was said to be the favorite, but the job went to Ken Macha instead.

In 2007, Brenly served as a game analyst during postseason broadcasts on the TBS cable television network. He covered the Yankees–Indians series in the ALDS and the Rockies–Diamondbacks series in the NLCS alongside Chip Caray and Tony Gwynn. On September 13, 2008, Brenly signed a four-year extension worth $3.5&amp; million to continue his role as color analyst for Cubs games.

Brenly again worked Division Series post-season coverage for TBS in 2009-2013 with Dick Stockton as his play-by-play partner each year.

He opted out of an extension to his contract with the Cubs and WGN television on October 17, 2012.

On October 18, 2012, Brenly signed a five-year deal as the TV color commentator for the Diamondbacks. On June 3, 2021, Brenly announced in a statement that he&#x27;d be stepping away from broadcasting temporarily to reflect on comments he had made the day before on-air about New York Mets pitcher Marcus Stroman, which Aramis Ramirez said was discriminatory. In June 2022, he was called out by San Diego Padres pitcher Mike Clevinger to &quot;find out who the people are instead of just running his mouth up there&quot;, referring to Brenly and his habitual negative comments about the Padres on air, such as suggesting a player could run the bases easier without a &quot;bike chain around his neck&quot; or advocating for Diamondback pitchers to throw at Padre batters during a blowout.

==Managerial career==
===Arizona Diamondbacks (2001–2004)===
The firing of Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter a day after the 2000 season lent an opportunity for Brenly, who was one of the seven candidates interviewed by Arizona alongside Chris Chambliss, Carlos Tosca, Clint Hurdle, Tom Spencer, Ron Hassey, and Terry Francona; Brenly and Francona were the final two considered. On October 30, he was signed to a three-year, $2 million contract. He was cited by general manager Joe Garagiola Jr and managing partner Jerry Colangelo for his &quot;baseball knowledge, work ethic and attitude&quot;, which contrasted with the &quot;micromanaging&quot; Showalter, who had won 250 of 486 games but had failed to reach past the National League Division Series.

With veteran stars such as Luis Gonzalez, Randy Johnson, and Curt Schilling, expectations were good for the team to win when they still had a chance to do so. The Diamondbacks won 92 games in his rookie season, finishing two games ahead of the San Francisco Giants, the defending NL West champion. In the 2001 National League Division Series, they played against the St. Louis Cardinals. The two teams split the first four games before Arizona won on a walk-off by Tony Womack for their first postseason series win. In the 2001 National League Championship Series against the Atlanta Braves, they split the first two games against each other before they rolled the next three games over Atlanta (with Schilling and Johnson winning three of the four games) to clinch the National League pennant. In the 2001 World Series, they were matched against the New York Yankees, who had won the last three World Series matchups and were looking for a four-peat with heavy odds in their favor. As per the tradition of the time for home-field advantage in the World Series having the National League host in odd-number years, Arizona hosted the first two games. They outscored the Yankees 13-1 in those games with Johnson and Schilling coming through with decisive victories. When the Series shifted to New York, Brenly&#x27;s team dealt with adversity. Game 3 saw them held to three hits and one run while New York narrowly won. Schilling was sent out for Game 4, but it was the bullpen that proved noteworthy. With a two-run lead in the eighth inning, closer Byung-hyun Kim was sent out by Brenly to pitch not only the 8th but also the 9th inning. He had a clean 8th, but the lineup in the 9th proved his undoing. Paul O&#x27;Neill got on base with one out before Tino Martinez lined a home run to tie the game and send it to extras. Kim was sent out for another inning to try and preserve the tie, but Derek Jeter hit a two-out walk-off home run to tie the series. For Game 5, Brenly went to Miguel Batista, who hadn&#x27;t pitched in twelve days, to the mound. He had a scoreless 7.2 inning performance, and the Diamondbacks lead 2-0 into the 9th inning. Brenly sent out Byung-hyun Kim to try and save the game despite what happened the previous night. With two outs and a runner on, Scott Brosius hit a home run to tie the game and send it to extras. In the 12th, the Yankees walked the game off on a RBI single to send the Yankees one victory away from a title going into Arizona. In Game 6, the Diamondbacks rode Johnson to a dominant victory 15-2 before Schilling was sent out to try and win the Series in the 7th game, once again pitching on three days rest. When Schilling was taken out after trailing 2-1 in the 7th, Brenly put in Batista to get a crucial out before putting in Johnson (104 pitches the night before) to get outs in the 8th and 9th inning. A 9th inning rally would end with Gonzalez lining a soft shot into the outfield to deliver a championship for Arizona.

Although the team repeated as Western Division champions in 2002, they lost in the Division Series. The 2003 team had exactly two winning months (June and September) and went 84-78 for a 3rd place finish in the West. The 2003 offseason saw them trade away Schilling. The team had a terrible start to the 2004 season and never recovered, winning just nine games each in the first two months of the year while dealing with injuries. When they were 29-50, Brenly was fired, with Colangelo stating it was not a &quot;change of reflection&quot; on him.

==Personal life==
Bob Brenly married Joan Brenly on August 10, 1974; they have two children. Their son Michael was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in 2004 (out of high school) and 2008 (out of UNLV) as a catcher. He played in the Cubs and Boston Red Sox minor league systems in all or parts of eight seasons spanning 2008–2015. After retiring from the Portland Sea Dogs in May 2015, the younger Brenly took a position as the assistant bullpen catcher in the Boston organization.

<text>The Little Sugar River is a tributary of the Sugar River in the U.S. state of Wisconsin.

It rises in Dane County, just north of New Glarus, and flows southeasterly, joining the Sugar River at the mill pond in Albany. The river above New Glarus is considered a class II trout stream by the DNR (1980).

The river widens below New Glarus, and some large wetlands exist bordering it, along the Sugar River State Trail.

<doc id="1200745" wikidata="Q1743993" url="?curid=1200745" title="Kivu">
<text>Kivu was the name for a large &quot;region&quot; in the Democratic Republic of the Congo under the rule of Mobutu Sese Seko that bordered Lake Kivu. It included three &quot;Sub-Regions&quot; (&quot;Sous-Régions&quot; in French): Nord-Kivu, Sud-Kivu and Maniema, corresponding to the three current provinces created in 1986. The capital of the Kivu Region was in Bukavu, and the capitals of the three Sub-Regions were in Goma, Uvira and Kindu.

Kivu has been repeatedly subjected to major conflicts since the early 20th century. Under Belgian colonial rule, it was the site of several religious revolts such as the 1944 Kivu uprising. Following independence, it was a battleground of the Simba rebellion, First Congo War, and Second Congo War, and has been the site of an ongoing military conflict since the early 2000s. In addition, an Ebola epidemic affected the region from August 2018 to June 2020.

==Geography==
Kivu is also the name for the entire region surrounding Lake Kivu, including the portions in Rwanda which contain the vast majority of the lake area&#x27;s population (the contiguous towns of Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Gisenyi in Rwanda, with a combined population approaching 1,000,000, form the largest urbanised area in the Lake Kivu area). The area is characterized by lush vegetation and an extended growing season due in part to its high elevation (1500 m or 4900 ft at the lakeshore) and the volcanic nature of its soil. The Kivu region represents the high point of the East African Rift Valley.

The lake itself contains a massive amount of carbon dioxide in its depths, and there is some concern that tectonic activity (rifting) and/or volcanic activity might cause a limnic eruption, a sudden release of this captured carbon dioxide. If this were to happen it would devastate the population around the lake; however, the likelihood of this occurring is in dispute.

<text>:&quot;See also Prince Katsura, the second son of Prince Mikasa.&quot;
The  was one of the four &quot;shinnōke&quot;, branches of the Imperial Family of Japan which were eligible to succeed to the Chrysanthemum Throne in the event that the main line should die out. It was founded by Prince Toshihito, a grandson of Emperor Ōgimachi and brother of Emperor Go-Yōzei. It is the second oldest of the &quot;shinnōke&quot;, after the Fushimi-no-miya.

The Katsura-no-miya house has died out several times, and has undergone a number of changes in name. It was originally titled Hachijō-no-miya. Prince Hachijō-no-miya Toshihito lived at the Katsura Imperial Villa in Kyoto, hence he and all of his lineage are referred to as &quot;Katsura-no-miya&quot;.

Prince Yoshihito of Mikasa, the second son of Prince Mikasa received the title &quot;Katsura-no-miya&quot; in 1988. However, this title is connected to his , &quot;Katsura&quot; (Cercidiphyllum) and thus is not related to the &quot;shinnōke&quot; title.

Unless otherwise stated, all Princes listed here are the sons of their predecessors.
